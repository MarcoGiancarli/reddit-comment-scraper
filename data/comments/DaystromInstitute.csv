DaystromInstitute,3e46yo,Algernon_Asimov,13,Wed Jul 22 00:34:40 2015 UTC,"The Kobali resurrection process is not as simple as just bringing a corpse back to life. As Lyndsay Ballard / Jhet'leya says: ""After the reanimation process, they spent months altering my DNA."" The Doctor later tells her: ""a genetic pathogen in your bloodstream [...] appears to have converted most of your human DNA into a Kobali protein structure. [...] The biochemical changes have affected every system in your body."" Also: ""I can affect some cosmetic changes. [...] The alternations would literally be skin-deep [...] Physiologically, you'd still be Kobali with a multispheric brain, a binary cardiovascular system.""  They don't just bring a dead Human back to life; they turn her into a Kobali. Every person resurrected in this way would become a different species.   Another Kobali further explains that: ""The reanimation process usually results in extensive memory loss"".  So, why wouldn't the Federation want this capability? Because the people who get resurrected this way become totally different people. They get physically changed at the genetic level, and they often don't remember who they used to be. The person who gets resurrected this way will not be the same as the person who died."
DaystromInstitute,3e46yo,neifirst,6,Wed Jul 22 00:41:27 2015 UTC,"""After the reanimation process, they spent months altering my DNA.""    It seems like from this quote one could theoretically do the reanimation process without the DNA alteration, it's just that the Kobali have no reason to do so.  I would say the main reason the Federation doesn't want it is simply that doing whatever it takes to stay alive goes against the ideals of the federation- they aren't as blatant about it as the Klingons, but the idea of an honorable death seems to be common among humans as well."
DaystromInstitute,3e46yo,solistus,5,Wed Jul 22 00:26:20 2015 UTC,"Yep. It's less resurrection, and more that humanoid corpses are used as raw materials by what is essentially a very strange alien reproductive process. Maybe the Federation could start trading its dead citizens who volunteered for the program prior to death to the Kobali, so they would have a more reliable source of raw materials for their version of artificial reproduction.  Which raises another question I don't recall that episode addressing... How did the Kobali come to exist at all if they only reproduce in this fashion? It clearly seems to be based on advanced technological processes. Did the Kobali evolve with a more typical reproductive method, then eventually modify themselves genetically in a way that had enormous benefits but prevented them from reproducing, turning to this technique instead? Or perhaps an accidental disaster rendered the species sterile, but they managed to perfect this technique in time to survive as a civilization? Or perhaps some completely different species invented the Kobali technique, which could only function by converting the subjects into a completely new humanoid species that did not evolve naturally and only existed as a result of this experiment? The latter seems the most plausible to me, and it leaves many interesting questions unanswered. How did such a bizarre technology ever come to exist? Was it developed intentionally as a means of creating a new species, or was it intended to do something else entirely? The only races we've ever heard of (that I can think of offhand, anyway) with anywhere close to the mastery of genetic manipulation required to create a new species like this are the ancient precursors to Alpha Quadrant humanoids and the Founders. Well, and the Q I suppose, if they cared enough about the affairs of mortal races to bother. This doesn't seem like any of their handiwork, though... Is there another similarly advanced society in the Delta Quadrant that we never met? Are they still around in the 24th Century, or is Kobali reanimation tech the last remnants of them?  It's hard to think of credible scenarios where a race with the power to transform a never-before-encountered species of humanoid with completely different internal biology to their own kind would be rendered sterile in a way they couldn't just genetically correct... Which implies that Kobali physiology probably lacks any reproductive mechanism at all. There's nothing to fix, in other words. It's also hard to think of a reason why a genetic tinkerer race making its own new humanoid species would make a species that can only reproduce in a creepy, complicated, technologically demanding manner, when surely any naturally occurring species would be well aware of the concept of biological reproduction. Maybe it was a population control technique, with the creator race hoping to keep the Kobali from learning how to make more of themselves without help? If so, that raises some pretty dark questions... Did the Kobali annihilate the race that created them? Why did that race not want them to be a self-sustaining species?"
DaystromInstitute,3e46yo,njfreddie,2,Tue Jul 21 22:08:08 2015 UTC,"How did the Kobali come to exist at all if they only reproduce in this fashion?   This is something I tried to answer myself.  My best thought was similar to your latter thought.  The Kobali collect the Dead--the only example we have is in a torpedo shell, but presumably they collect the dead from planets.  They also have FTL travel, which presumes a homeworld.  We never see the process of Kobali reproduction, only a general technical description.  They are kind of like vampires or zombies except they reanimate without the killing.  I have read stories and summaries that suggest vampires and zombie transformation is done by virus.  Maybe it is a virus--a virus that can reshape a corpse before it is too badly decomposed (a space environment would be exactly that).  It is a virus that evolved to make a host that will allow the virus to spread. Later generations of space-traveling Kobali learned to adjust the viral reproduction to work on the Dead from other species."
DaystromInstitute,3e46yo,Mirror_Sybok,19,Tue Jul 21 23:32:34 2015 UTC,"Reanimation caused extensive memory loss, usually rendering the formerly deceased entirely new beings, with a new and distinct Kobali personality.   I doubt that the Kobali personality part applies to any who would be ""resurrected"" in this manner, but the part about the extensive memory loss in the majority of the resurrected seems like a major problem with trying to push this to Federation citizens. You're essentially giving everyone a solution to emotional pain that adds additional emotional pain and hardship to their lives. I wouldn't be chomping at the bit to raise a stranger living in my dead child's corpse."
DaystromInstitute,3e46yo,BloodBride,7,Wed Jul 22 00:08:40 2015 UTC,"During the war with the Dominion, wouldn't resurrection be useful? Even without memory retention, you have a way of getting intelligent adults you can train in starship operations - better than birthing a child."

It wasn't just materiel shortages but people were getting tired, you gotta remember that there were alot of old ships that got crushed by the Dominion in the opening part of the war."
DaystromInstitute,3e46yo,solistus,5,Tue Jul 21 21:40:44 2015 UTC,"There are ethical issues there. If the reanimated person is, for all intents and purposes, a new being, then they never swore an oath to Starfleet or agreed to fight and die in its war. Morality aside, there would be serious issues with discipline, mutiny, treason, etc. - if I suddenly found myself being drafted into a war in a dead man's body with no memory of how I got there or wtf the ""Federation"" even is, I would think they were my enemy and do everything I could to get the hell outta dodge. If they wanna train me in starship operations, great - all the easier to steal a runabout when the opportunity presents itself and head to neutral territory. I might even assume that the Dominion, which I also knew nothing about, can't be as bad as these necromancer-slavers... And I'm sure the Vorta would be all too happy to exploit that and recruit tons of new spies and saboteurs within Starfleet.   Also, as longbow6625 pointed out, they had access to other technologies that would accomplish the same thing, probably more effectively, and they still didn't use them. I also agree with his conclusion that the limiting factor for Starfleet's military capacity was starship production, not staffing for those starships. The competitive admissions process for Starfleet Academy suggests that there are generally far more willing volunteers than Starfleet can make use of. Granted, they ramped up ship production for the war, but I doubt their manufacturing capacity could grow quickly enough to accommodate what would surely be a massive new wave of volunteers when the Jem'Hadar began brutally attacking Federation worlds. Also, IIRC, there were numerous scenes with long lists of war dead being discussed by Starfleet personnel on DS9, but it was only when they brought up the number of ships that were lost in one incident that I can recall anyone (Bashir, in this case) commenting that Starfleet couldn't afford to take those kind of losses. They talked about casualties as a morale issue and 'human cost of war' kind of matter, but they talked about losing ships as an existential threat."
DaystromInstitute,3e46yo,nermid,9,Tue Jul 21 21:47:48 2015 UTC,"The Federation has any number of ways to completely forgo their morals in wartime to increase troop numbers -- Ruk's android factory, reprogramming people with Adams' chair, Mariposan cloning, Lyssarrian cloning, Mudd's world's android factory, transporter duplicates, etc.  They don't though, because that's not how the Federation works.  Cannibalizing the dead into half-formed conscripts falls under that same umbrella.  For a less hoity-toity answer, the war was long over by the time Voyager made it home, and the Federation proper never bordered the Kobali."
DaystromInstitute,3e46yo,MeVasta,2,Tue Jul 21 23:07:10 2015 UTC,"Yes.

DaystromInstitute,3e46yo,Mirror_Sybok,2,Tue Jul 21 23:49:37 2015 UTC,"That scenario isn't exactly the same. Worf had selective memory erasure performed on his suicidally depressed brother and then handed him off to someone else to do the heavy lifting, thus removing himself completely. Most of the people that the Kobali method would initially appeal to will have hopes (and will agonizingly cling to those hopes for months until the process is complete) that do not match the results. They will then be in the positron of raising a brand new being that constantly reminds them of their dead loved one."
DaystromInstitute,3e46yo,67thou,2,Tue Jul 21 22:31:41 2015 UTC,"I double checked on Memory Alpha because I don't understand how a dead body can be brought back to life, and I definitely don't grasp how even if that were possible why a brain would still have all its knowledge.   It has been shown through many studies that memories are stored physically on the brain. If you could keep a brain active, or re-activate it after death, it's entirely reasonable to assume that barring any damage to the tissue, memories would remain intact.  It brings up the philosophical question though ""do memories make the person?""  I would say no. But Star Trek has often avoided the subject of the soul. One could assume that by the time of Star Trek, they could replicate memories completely by copying a brain, but would it really be the same person?"
DaystromInstitute,3e46yo,solistus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:12:49 2015 UTC,"Replicators can't create living tissue, and from what we know of them it seems quite unlikely they are physically precise enough to perfectly reproduce something as delicate as the synapses of a human brain. If they could do that, surely they could precisely replicate the physical structure of various foods instead of relying on resequenced protein molecules that, according to many characters at least, are but a pale approximation of the real thing. If the tech was sophisticated enough to duplicate a living brain, surely it would be good enough at making food that Eddington wouldn't have been so blown away by fresh tomatoes and corn when he joined the Maquis. Even some technological/mechanical components, and naturally occurring objects like dilithium crystals and latinum, are impossible to replicate, so clearly the technology has some substantial limitations and can't just produce any arbitrary configuration of matter down to the subatomic level."
DaystromInstitute,3e46yo,67thou,2,Tue Jul 21 23:31:34 2015 UTC,"I think you are misunderstanding my use of the word replicate, i don't mean it in the sense they use a ""replicator"" i mean it in the sense they make an exact duplicate using other tech.  We know they can scan the brain, they accurately track memories in synapses and selectively erase or plant memories.  We know they can generate living tissue through various means. The brain may be complex but they can easily use cloning or stem cells to generate new brain cells. If they could imprint an exact copy of a brains synaptic pattern they could theoretically re-create said brain.  But more so, if they can use the technology referenced in the OP to regenerate a brain, my main point was that brain would most certainly possess the same memories as memories are stored physically on the brain."
DaystromInstitute,3e46yo,solistus,2,Tue Jul 21 22:35:51 2015 UTC,"Fair enough - but we've never actually seen another Federation technology that was explicitly described as being capable of duplicating a living brain. Their ability to manipulate memory was far from perfect - for example, there was nothing Bashir could do to remove O'Brien's implanted memories of being imprisoned, aside from wiping his memory completely. And when Section 31 wanted to be sure Bashir wasn't compartmentalizing memories of being a Dominion double agent, they had to turn to illegal Romulan technology that still couldn't simply scan for suppressed memories - they had to put Bashir in a simulation, observe him, and hope he revealed those memories himself. I think you're overestimating Federation tech on this one.  The Kobali tech was described as almost always causing massive memory loss, so that one's a non-starter. Sometimes those memories were still intact, but the Kobali could neither ensure that this would happen nor even predict whether it would - they were surprised that Lindsey retained such strong memories of her past life. Of course, from their perspective, retaining memories would be a bad thing, making it harder to integrate into Kobali society, so maybe they could do a better job of preserving memories if they wanted to... But that's pure speculation, not based on anything we actually know about them.   If they could imprint an exact copy of a brains synaptic pattern they could theoretically re-create said brain.   I agree. I just don't think they can do that. The closest technology we've seen to that is replicators, which definitely aren't that precise. If they had a better version of replicators that could do stuff like that, why wouldn't they use it for other non-replicatable things like dilithium crystals or latinum? We can be pretty sure that no race in contact with the Alpha Quadrant races is capable of duplicating latinum - that's the whole reason the Ferengi and some other still money-based societies use it as currency. If any known tech could duplicate it perfectly, the Ferengi economy would implode overnight. So if there's any tech that could come close to rebuilding a synaptic network, it must be more limited than just an arbitrary matter reconfigurator, and it must have some other limitations that prevent it from being used in a wide range of medical scenarios (like the aforementioned events in Hard Time and Inquisition).   Oh, another example - that Voyager episode where Tuvok starts having flashbacks and we learn that some Maquis space-hypnotist had long ago turned the Maquis crewmembers into sleeper agents. If the Federation could even accurately read and interpret, let alone copy, synaptic patterns from living brains, then surely at the very least that would be standard practice for returning undercover anti-terrorist agents like Tuvok. And yet another one - Worf's trial when the Klingons wanted to extradite him. If they could have just read his memory of the event, that would have resolved the issue. I'm sure the examples could keep on coming if I started looking over episode lists - there are tons of plot arcs that would have been trivial to resolve if the Federation had mind-reading or mind-duplicating technology."

DaystromInstitute,3e46yo,Noumenology,2,Wed Jul 22 00:30:06 2015 UTC,"The other day I was watching this video about Chuck Jones, a classic animator for Warner Brothers / Looney Tunes. Something that stood out to me is the concept of ""discipline"" - this idea of putting limits on yourself, and constraints on the story and the characters, which make their impact all the more effective.   This is important in animation, because you can literally do anything. Why doesn't the Wile E. Coyote get a bunch of other coyotes to help him catch the Road Runner? Why doesn't the road runner buy something from Acme that will help him kill Coyote and get him off his back? Why doesn't the Road Runner just tell him to piss off? Why doesn't Wile E. Coyote give up and become a vegetarian? Because, while all those things and more are absolutely possible, they suck, and they're not funny, and they don't tell a good story.   Science Fiction is much the same way. This is also why fan fiction and beta cannon is so unwieldy - think of all the times official canon stretched the fabric of what's possible in ST, then fucking rip the story to pieces. Borg technology was so incredibly overpowered, as was future tech - VOY:Endgame almost breaks our suspension of belief because it warps the rules of the show so much in an effort to just get Voyager home for a happy ending. The ""reset button"" also worked this way - it broke the rules, or the discipline the story set for itself on the first day (""We're alone in an uncharted part of the galaxy... We have no idea of the dangers we're going to face blah blah blah"" yet everything almost always seems hunky dory).   The basic premise of ST (and scifi) is a human engagement with potential situations (usually aliens and technology) which confront our present ethics and values. Writers like Ray Bradbury did this really well in a way that made them staples of American literature and not just genera authors. I won't name names but less prestigious scifi is little more than gizmo gawking or technophillia. It seems that what those stories is discipline - constraints on the story that allow tension and emotional investment to exist. Because if our characters are virtually invincible (ablative armor), super-fast (transwarp conduits, slipstream tech, etc), really strong (quantum or gravimetric torpedoes, ""red matter"") , and basically omniscient (Midas Aray, Hirogen comm network, etc), then what do they have to worry about? If they can be brought back from the dead (Khan's blood, Borg nanoprobes, Kobali tech) then why should they worry about dying?   I'm not saying that new tech doesn't mean there can't be new forms of discipline in the story. But personally I find these constantly shifting goalposts totally uninteresting. It's what they mean for the characters involved that makes the story worth watching. The ethics of resurrection is a very interesting question that ST hasn't really answered well (I don't really remember VOY:Mortal Coil), though death has been a theme (VOY:Death Wish, TNG:Half a Life, TNG:Ethics).   The point is that all this technology for the sake of making the characters more powerful runs the risk of making their actions insignificant. The reason that TWOK was an effective story with a working climax is because SPOCK DIES. He sacrifices himself to save the ship. Then the movie ends. Into Darkness fails on this entirely because resurrecting Kirk less then ten minutes after he dies robs that decision of its impact and meaningfulness.   My hope is that if anyone does anything with the ST intellectual property again that they don't make it a technophillia pandemonium nostalgia-jerk, and that instead they tell some meaningful and significant stories about the human (or otherwise) experience which we haven't considered yet."

Something tells me a lot of species won't be too keen on resurrection technology that confronts their rituals and beliefs, but tactical systems and propulsion they once deemed impossible being handed to them freely? Sure, why not?  The debate over that kind of tradeoff is going to have massive political ramifications.  Not to mention the massive leap forward in tactical systems and starship design the Federation already developed, initially to fight the Borg, that was then deployed during the Dominion war.  Even solitary Prometheus, Sovereign, Defiant, and Akira classes patrolling the borders are a hell of a lot more threatening than squadrons of Miranda or Excelsior classes."

Only five or six episodes would actually involve Crenem attacks, with the season finale being basically the 2 episodes we got, but with only those two episodes being reset, not the rest of the season.  Rather than a whole season of nothing but Voyager getting torn apart by the Crenem, which would be pretty boring and honestly kind of depressing, the Crenem would just be recurring baddies for the season.

His facial features are obviously quite plain because he couldn't do faces but definitely looks to me to be based on Bajorans rather than Cardassians. He just had trouble with the Bajroan nose - Cardassian spoon head might have been easier  What I'd like to know is what happened to the UT and his comm-badge when he shapeshifted.

Anyway, one thing that bothers me about the UT is how exactly it works. Odo for example, imagine him being found and the scientists trying to teach him a language. They speak Bajoran. Cardassians speak, well, Cardassian. It is reasonable to suppose they all use UTs. Let's suppose Odo learns Bajoran from the scientists. To the Cardassians, however, they all speak their language, because of the UT. So to them, he's learning Cardassian. But he's actually learning Bajoran, because that's what he hears, since they wouldn't give a UT to a changeling... I guess. If they did, he wouldn't understand any language, since he doesn't even speak!   I don't know, this is confusing :("
DaystromInstitute,3e4o2a,Highestbidder101,5,Wed Jul 22 01:53:42 2015 UTC,"Also keeping in mind that as a changeling, he doesn't have an actual native language, they communicate through the link"
DaystromInstitute,3e4o2a,KostAmojan,2,Tue Jul 21 23:15:10 2015 UTC,"Well he was raised in a Cardassian lab, but by a Bajoran (Dr. Mora).  So I think it is an interesting question that depends on what the Cardassian policy was regarding the Bajoran language. If they used Universal Translators with the Bajorans, Mora would have been speaking his native Bajoran, which is what Odo would have learnt; but if the Cardassian policy was to force the Bajorans they worked with to actually learn and speak Cardassian then Odo would have learnt Cardassian."

DaystromInstitute,3e4o2a,Romnonaldao,7,Tue Jul 21 23:02:47 2015 UTC,He probably speaks both. He probably speaks many languages. Being a changeling may allow him to learn languages extremely quickly. I doubt he even needs a translator

The marks will move apart from each other."
DaystromInstitute,3e1gpe,HybridVigor,17,Tue Jul 21 22:03:18 2015 UTC,"The wormhole has to orbit something. There is no such thing as a fixed point in space. The question is whether or not it is in some sort of resonance with Bajor. So we might suggest that being in a synchronous orbit with Bajor around it's sun is a lucky coincidence, but not the luckiest one here.  The speed at which an object orbits is pretty much determined by the distance from the point about which it is orbiting and its mass. This means that, for an object like DS9, there is a narrow range of velocities for it to assume a stable orbit around Bajor's sun without having to continually speed up or slow down to maintain it. This speed is determined by its distance from the sun (in the Denorios belt) and its mass. That's all fine until you realize that it is orbiting in concert with the Bajoran wormhole which, while close to the same distance away from the sun, is unlikely to have a mass similar to DS9!  Yet they don't appear to have any problems staying close to it as they both orbit the Bajoran sun.  Now that is a lucky coincidence."
DaystromInstitute,3e1gpe,drafterman,7,Tue Jul 21 12:16:24 2015 UTC,The difference in mass between the wormhole and the station is not an issue. If they are in the same orbit they have the same orbital velocity. The station would just need to position itself ahead or behind the wormhole in the orbit.  v = sqrt(G*M/r)      Where  M = mass of the Bajoran r = orbital radius measured from the center of the Bajoran sun G = gravitational constant  Assuming:  Msun >> Mstation Msun >>Mwormhole  Circular Orbit  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_orbit
DaystromInstitute,3e1gpe,AltekkeE,2,Tue Jul 21 14:32:08 2015 UTC,"According to your link, the equation is:  v = sqrt(G(M + m) / r)   Where M and m refer to the respective masses of the orbiting bodies.  That said, the equations for Orbital Period clearly only reference the ""more massive body"" which would clearly be the Bajoran sun.  But I guess the question remains whether this applies to spatial deformations such as the Bajoran wormhole itself.  There is also the question of whether or not they're in sync with Bajor (they shouldn't be). We never hear of variable travel times between the station and Bajor."
DaystromInstitute,3e1gpe,drafterman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:45:44 2015 UTC,"Is there any reason to assume that a wormhole, no matter how stable, has substantial mass? The DS9 wormhole clearly isn't absorbing nearby matter."

I find this to be the most likely explanation. DS9 is probably trailing the wormhole. It's the only way they could be stationary relative to each other.  In fact... I bet all three are in the same orbit. That is, the station trails the wormhole which trails Bajor. This would explain why travel time between all three destinations seems constant."
DaystromInstitute,3e1gpe,kraetos,6,Wed Jul 22 01:35:42 2015 UTC,It's possible they apply some sort of station-keeping. We know the station has thrusters and can move.
DaystromInstitute,3e1gpe,Neo24,3,Tue Jul 21 12:58:58 2015 UTC,"Indeed, but they describe is a rather hazardous process (at least at the beginning), requiring fancy warp bubble shenanigans to keep the station from falling apart."

DaystromInstitute,3e1gpe,Stelith61,10,Tue Jul 21 14:02:05 2015 UTC,That's true. It looks like the thrusters are designed to make small-level orbital corrections.
DaystromInstitute,3e1gpe,drafterman,5,Tue Jul 21 14:14:21 2015 UTC,There's something sort of like a stationary point in space. It's called a Lagrange point . They are fixed points in space kind of. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point  Ds9 could be at one of those.
DaystromInstitute,3e1gpe,toastee,3,Tue Jul 21 18:23:37 2015 UTC,"I like this explanation. DS9 could be at the L4 or L5 point in Bajor's orbit. That still puts it only, say, 20 minutes at light speed from Bajor. If full impulse is .25c, a trip between the two would take 80 minutes. There's enough wiggle room there to make travel times as portrayed in the show realistic."
DaystromInstitute,3e1gpe,CitizenjaQ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:49:37 2015 UTC,"I like this explanation. DS9 could be at the L4 or L5 point in Bajor's orbit.   Unfortunately it can't be true because we know the wormhole itself orbits B'hava'el itself, and the wormhole appears to be stationary relative to the station.  For the wormhole and the station to be stationary relative to each other they both must be orbiting B'hava'el. That rules Bajor and it's Lagrange points out as a potential location for DS9."
DaystromInstitute,3e1gpe,kraetos,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:32:13 2015 UTC,"A Lagrange point is only stationary relative to the bodies which create it, which means it's still moving relative to everything else. /u/drafterman is correct, nothing is truly stationary."

DaystromInstitute,3e1gpe,androidbitcoin,4,Tue Jul 21 16:41:36 2015 UTC,"We know that the wormhole aperature is located in the Denorios Belt, but we are not given much information on how the wormhole interacts with space-time. The most important consideration for me is ""Does the wormhole have mass in the Bajoran system?""  If so then the aperature would fall into an orbit around Bajor-B'hava'el, and the DS9 could enter into the same orbit. This would lead to further questions, such as whether the length of the wormhole is fixed or whether it can flex as it moves through its orbit.   If the wormhole has no mass then it would almost certainly require the prophets to actively coordinate the location of the aperature, since over several thousand years the Bajoran system would move from a fixed point. We would then have to ascertain what rules the Prophets would follow in order to maintain the wormhole.  And in between those two extremes are a variety of possibilities. What if the wormhole only interacts with the universe upon opening? How would that affect its position? Wormholes are commonly believes to be formed from black holes. Was one used to create the Prophets wormhole? Would that mass still exist or did the Prophets convert it into the verteron tunnel structures? Simply put, DS9 was very lax in explaining the wormhole physics so the best we can do is explore myriad possibilities for how it functions."
DaystromInstitute,3e1gpe,DokomoS,3,Tue Jul 21 15:36:38 2015 UTC,"If the wormhole had no mass and so was not anchored, it would be much less than thousands of years before the Bajor system would leave it behind. It would be seconds - systems and galaxies move at an astronomical pace."

DaystromInstitute,3e1bm9,jonnyta,5,Tue Jul 21 12:59:13 2015 UTC,"More Voyager bashing.   why, when replicator use has to be rationed and the ship is often on the edge of needing some kind of energy/fuel, are they allowed to keep using the holodeck?   Mentioned in the second episode. The holodeck uses it own power system that they cannot reroute anywhere else.   magical separate power system, but it's really ridiculous and was truthfully just a crutch the writers didn't want to let go of   On Daystrom, Canon is canon. You can't cherry pick the canon you approve of. There is a canon reason why they still have holodecks."
DaystromInstitute,3e1bm9,BoxDroppingManApe,4,Tue Jul 21 17:56:57 2015 UTC,The holodecks are completely enclosed.  Perhaps it's possible that holodecks are able to reclaim a large portion of the energy it uses via photon absorption or something.
DaystromInstitute,3e1bm9,david-saint-hubbins,4,Tue Jul 21 15:44:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think of it as a crutch, really; it's more of a hand-wave that allows them to get on with telling the story.  Your point is entirely logical, of course--if energy is scarce, then the holodecks shouldn't be used at all.  But Voyager never fully embraced its ""scarce resources""/""stranded from home"" premise, anyway.    Trek has always done period episodes once in a while.  They allow the show to save money by using existing studio costumes/props/sets, and it's a fun aside to see the characters in a throwback environment.    In TOS, the show relied on ""Hodgkin's Law of Parallel Planetary Development"", e.g. ""we found this planet that just happens to be very similar to ancient Rome.""  That was pretty ridiculous, so for TNG, they came up with the holodeck, which has its own problems--namely, safety (i.e. there are no stakes if it's safe, so the 'safety protocols' are constantly failing) and power consumption."
DaystromInstitute,3e1bm9,nermid,4,Tue Jul 21 20:59:42 2015 UTC,"e.g. ""we found this planet that just happens to be very similar to ancient Rome.""   More to the point: we found a planet that's literally identical to 20th century Earth..."
DaystromInstitute,3e1bm9,solarpilot,3,Tue Jul 21 22:38:38 2015 UTC,"This is a very valid point. In TNG:""Booby Trap"" we've seen what happens when power becomes scarce on a starship and the holodeck is active, it reallocates power from the holodeck to more essential functions.  The idea that the holodeck on Voyager would keep running the program and only turn off the lights within the simulation to mirror what's happening in the rest of the ship is pretty absurd."

DaystromInstitute,3dz6c4,67thou,73,Mon Jul 20 18:44:43 2015 UTC,"On the NX-01 and Voyager, the issue is probably a lack of available space. If you look at the ""official"" (not sure if canon) schematics of a Galaxy-class ship such as the Enterprise-D, however, a large portion of deck 12 (much larger than the ""sickbay"" we see on TNG, which is actually just the main patient ward) is dedicated to sickbay: including isolation rooms, reception areas, physical therapy rooms, primary, biohazard, and overflow ICUs, critical care and triage areas, two dedicated surgical suites, trauma stasis units, and several offices. Most likely they discuss (or attempt to discuss) private problems in the main patient ward simply because that's where the doctor is at the moment and there's no one else around.  And of course the real-world explanation is to save money on set design.  EDIT: here's that schematic. Sorry for potato."

You could generate objects for stuff like the doors and corridor segments and just repeat them everywhere.  If I were doing it, I'd overlay images of the blueprints and start drawing architectural elements like walls and doors, once I had created the Trek-specific objects.  I'd love to do one of the saucer decks, just to get a feel for it.  I suspect it would drive home just how HUGE the ship is.  Even with 1000 people it would probably feel very empty.

When you're caring for seriously wounded or ill, privacy is hardly a concern when there was already so little of it. And they were really only intended to treat the more serious cases; crew who got mildly ill or minor injuries were treated and sent back to their bunks. Also, even for a large crew the demand for medical services at any given time is usually quite low, so to use a lot of space on private sick beds and extra rooms would be inefficient. Starships, needing to save space even more, would likely use this model for medical bays.  Also, the main characters in Star Trek are the senior officers who enjoy larger quarters and don't have to share their space. This can lead to the false assumption that everyone on the ship has similar privilege and the loss of privacy in sickbay is at odds with that. However most of the junior officers and crewmen shared quarters and had far less privacy (e.g. TNG episode ""Lower Decks""), which is more in line with current day naval operations as described above. Sickbay's lack of privacy was a lot less of a 'shock' for the majority of the crew, and operational considerations outweighed the need for privacy structures."

I lived abroad for six years, and in Asia, having an open room is very common for treatment. It is common to see others while you are being treated.   Second, I believe that Starfleet is a military, and that it is part of the Federation. While ships like the Enterprise are often at the front lines of diplomatic missions and often carry many non-military staff, it is still a military ship. You aren't going to get much privacy in the military either.   And third, the idea of medical privacy might be antiquated by this time in the future. It might be the case that people are more open about their medical needs, especially physical medical needs.   Fourth, a tricorder often is the tool of diagnosis and it appears that it does not need to remove any clothing in order to function properly. ""Doctor, I have a rash on my bum."" ""Let me scan it for you. [5 seconds pass as the doctor grabs a tricorder and scans the patient] Yes, I see, let me fill the hypospray for you...."" No real need for privacy in that situation.  When discussing the idea of being sterile, it might be the case that the air ventilation system cleans the air and that when people are transported, all harmful bacteria and viruses are pinpointed by the transporter and neutralized.

There very well could be a more private room that we never see because they can't show everything on TV, even though they can allude to or directly reference more intimate aspects of health and wellness.  Talking about mating rituals or sex is a bit different than showing a colonoscopy or pap smear.    Privacy is still valued (showers are singular, at least Janeway's was, and quarters are usually for 1-4 people) and as I recall most of the time bad news is given its either in private or only said publicly when it's relevant to the crisis at hand or crew's health overall."

DaystromInstitute,3e0xy8,Chaff5,19,Tue Jul 21 02:50:35 2015 UTC,"For purely humanitarian purposes, it has to be transporters. Beyond that, assuming that there is a range of several hundred miles, congrats! Space travel and large scale construction just became a thing. Since the vast, VAST, majority of cost (in resources as well as $$$) in space exploration is getting things into space, having the ability to just move materials or personnel into Low Earth Orbit is a total game changer.   While the Holodeck is cool, unless we get replicators to go with it there is no way that it is more life changing than teleportation. Instead of being limited to the materials that we have on Earth, we can now begin using other worlds and asteroids for mining and production. We are still stuck in the Solar System for the moment, but we aren't in a crunch for space any more.   And, by the very nature of instant transporting, we are now able to move faster than light. Its not a warp drive, but its a start."
DaystromInstitute,3e0xy8,BronanTheDestroyer,7,Tue Jul 21 03:12:36 2015 UTC,"Is the transporter FTL? I thought it was only at lightspeed, but the distances it worked over effectively made it instant."
DaystromInstitute,3e0xy8,5i1v3r,4,Tue Jul 21 03:42:24 2015 UTC,"Having looked this up, it might technically be faster than light, but not by much. At 250000 km (which is more than I remember any canon source using except for the JJverse) an ""instant"" transport with TOS transporters takes approximately 9 seconds from start to finish (Scotty pressing the button to the person starting to move). Light makes the trip in just over .8 seconds.   So, if you could transport straight to the moon (384000 km) in 9 seconds, light would take ~1.2 seconds. It's bloody well better than the 4 days, 7 hours that Apollo 11 took, though.   To go faster than light, you would have to be able to travel more than 2,698,132.122 km at a hop. Now, you might be able to do a relay system of patter buffers/ enhancer satellites to bounce a signal around at or close to light speed, but that is likely the limit."
DaystromInstitute,3e0xy8,BronanTheDestroyer,7,Tue Jul 21 04:26:27 2015 UTC,"Except in NuTrek where Scotty was able to beam Kirk from a stationary location onto a ship moving at warp speed with only a reasonable error in placement. This single scene almost completely nullified any need for starships at all. If we have the ability to send people that far and definitely FTL (the transport beam had to be moving considerably faster than the Enterprise's warp factor), other than range, scientific research that needs to be done in space, and militaristic purposes, what need is there for full sized ships later than 1701?"

If they decide to pursue the freaking massive changes they made to the timeline into a new series, it could keep Star Trek alive. Yes, Jar Jar Abrams took it in a completely different direction than the people who grew up with the various shows expected. Yes, he pissed a lot of fans off. But, he brought ST to an entirely new demographic.  We're discussing shows that have been off the air for a decade now, even finding new things about a show that ended before some of us were even alive. NuTrek gave people the kind of Michael Bay experience that is needed nowadays to bring people in, and possibly set up the beginnings of an entirely new version of TOS.  Yes, the timeline is screwed with the destruction of Vulcan. However, I believe, that if pursued, a new series could work without retconning everything we already know. Maybe the agents of the Temporal Prime Directive come back into play, maybe they branch it as an entire separate timeline.  Whatever they decide to do, the transporter tech that Scotty invents is verified by Spock."

DaystromInstitute,3e0xy8,lengau,3,Tue Jul 21 18:40:00 2015 UTC,"The matter transfer is FTL because it occurs over a subspace corridor, which is essentially inter-dimensional travel which doesn't traverse intervening real-space.  This is how reassembly without a pad at the remote location works--the origin transporter is actually reaching through what is essentially a subspace portal to perform the reassembly.  The obstacle is that sensors have range limits, and if you can't get detailed, zero-latency sensor data about your target point, you can't open a sufficiently stable subspace corridor to that location.  There is canonical discussion of ""beaming through"" intervening matter, but I suspect that this is a simplification involving the need to penetrate intervening matter with sensors in order to open the necessary subspace corridor. ie, beaming ""through"" thick rock is dangerous because the sensor data necessary to maintain a stable subspace corridor (aka ""transporter lock"") is less reliable."

DaystromInstitute,3e0xy8,mistakenotmy,2,Tue Jul 21 03:14:24 2015 UTC,"Lol I was hoping nobody would go this route since you could then have an entire dinner by sitting in your holodeck. And even though a holodeck uses replicator/transporter technology, they are actually not the same technology in itself. The development of the holodeck in its purest form does not reverse engineer into transporters and vice versa. Transporters would have to already be invented for holodecks to bring in food in this hypothetical question. It would be like a car with an air conditioner in it."

DaystromInstitute,3e0xy8,Impacatus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:36:29 2015 UTC,"Replicators are an off shoot of transporter technology. In a similar fashion that a transporter takes your atoms from one place to another, a replicator does that from storage to your plate, although it is less complicated. Instead of having, say, a pork chop stored at the atomic level, it has general atoms that it can turn into whatever you want.   Holodecks, in the most basic sense, are 3-D movie projectors with force field emitters making the images feel real. With the safeties off, a holobullet is ""real"" because it is still a force field creating the holobullet. The two technologies are actually completely different."

The computer is shown as being capable of producing original works of fiction in seconds.  We've also seen intelligent holograms like the EMH and Vic Fontaine capable of solving technical and emotional problems.  This would set off a scientific revolution.  Holograms could take over all non-physical human jobs.  Aside from doctors, failed governments could be replaced by holo-portraits of legendary kings, impartial and incorruptible.  Teachers and caregivers could be imparted with the latest psychological research.  The possibilities are endless.  They would also be a boon to the education fields.  Unlimited cadavers to train doctors.  Engineers could prototype their designs for free.  Pilots could try out dangerous maneuvers in a safe environment.  Send a holodeck to a remote village in an impoverished country, and in a year or two, you'll have a fully trained workforce for a new high-tech factory.  All the resources we currently devote to education, training, and knowledge work could be freed up.  Besides, transporters are dangerous.  It's only a matter of time before people weaponize them, and unlike Star Trek, we don't have any defense against it."

DaystromInstitute,3e0xy8,cryptic_mythic,15,Tue Jul 21 05:03:27 2015 UTC,"transporters kill you and just make a copy of you in the destination location   The franchise has explicitly established that this is not how transporters in the Trek universe work, and that the entity that rematerializes is the same as the entity that dematerializes and is definitely not just an exact replica. (ENT Daedalus)  It's also established that the consciousness can remain aware throughout the entire process, even while decompiled as part of the matter stream.  This would not be possible if the entity being transported was effectively dead until rematerialization. (TNG Realm of Fear)  Even if it doesn't make sense to our primitive 21st Century primate brains, Trek has been pretty clear that the transporter is not just a copier."
DaystromInstitute,3e0xy8,BonzoTheBoss,5,Tue Jul 21 06:35:30 2015 UTC,"So is this entity something we'd name a ""soul"" in the 21st century? Beyond that how do you explain Thomas Riker or Tuvix without breaking the primary consciousness, they both had their own experiences"

The (non-canon) explanation I see most often is that the ""other"" confinement beam that resulted in Thomas Riker, interacted with the atmospheric distortions and drew his matter stream from an alternate quantum reality. i.e. our (prime) universe ended up with two and another unspecified universe ended up with none. From their perspective Riker would have simply died in a transporter accident. This accounts for where the extra mass required to materialize and entirely separate body came from."

What we can take from that episode is that the atmospheric distortions that caused the duplication were unique to that specific planet, and therefore highly unlikely to be repeatable.  One explanation I've seen is that the distortions cause a separate (but physically identical) matter stream to be pulled from an alternate quantum reality, and that's what materialized on the planet. But that's not really canon."
DaystromInstitute,3e0xy8,Seether262,3,Tue Jul 21 13:50:08 2015 UTC,"Great question.   Transporters win the bout for me since they would (ideally) be a much more affordable choice of transportation. If transporter pads can be as common as cars, all the space and time and energy we use for getting around could be put to so much better use. Even if they are only as common as train depots and airports, families and friends wouldn't have to deal with painfully long periods of separation due to cost and time off. (A humongous part of the ""why?"" for me, personally, I'd rather get to visit my real parents in their real house than have a holodeck meeting  woth holodeck versions. They would still freak me out, though."
DaystromInstitute,3e0xy8,StarGangCo,3,Tue Jul 21 07:29:10 2015 UTC,"I think a major reason both technologies ""work"" is that they are being utilized by incredibly enlightened 24th century humans.  The thought of having to pick one of these two technologies for 21st century Earth has me contemplating which has the potential to do less harm, rather than more good for the world.  Holodecks seem like the ultimate extension of our current virtual reality endeavors.  In addition to the networking options the OP has put forth that would ""shrink"" the distances between many of us by allowing holodeck ""tele-presence"", I fear many would use the technology to further disconnect from other people and the world at large.  Parents create virtual copies of themselves to engage in childcare activities so they can live out fantasy lives rather than actually interacting with their children. People indulge in endless sexual fantasies or acts like murder that are currently proscribed by law but that no longer ""count"" because they are done to holograms.  The morality compass of many people is significantly compromised because they are constantly engaging in acts they would never have contemplated before, but now don't hesitate to carry out on holodecks.  The class divide between those who can live all day inside a fantasy and those who still have to work each day only widens resentment and hostility between the have's and have-not's. Then there is the relentless drive to monetize both the hardware and the programs being run in holodecks by corporations seeking to capitalize on a technology that is so addictive, the gross national product of many nations is severely impacted (though only in nations that can actually GIVE this tech to their citizens, while other countries simply don't have the power or infrastructure to implement it).  Tourism revenues are lost almost entirely.  Celebrities no longer have careers because no one pays to see movies or movies stars when they can simply create a hologram of a movie star and then have sex with them.  Celebrity holo-images are traded on the internet black market.  The entertainment industry attempts to rally by producing high quality holo-entertainment, but people would rather live out their own fantasies than bother with someone else's.  No one buys pets anymore, when they can create virtual talking bipedal dolphins, so dogs and cats flood the humane society.  Teenagers don't date, they simply create holograms of sex partners and withdraw into social isolation, never developing the social skills to actually date and reproduce someday.  Moral debates arise over long term relationships with holograms, and whether these beings have souls.  Religious groups call holograms pure evil, as they were created by mankind, and therefore have no souls.  Holographic rights groups become militant in attempting to free individual programs who are starting to exhibit signs of sentience.  Holograms being used as sex-slaves or murdered repeatedly are seen by some as a form of simple fun or catharsis, but by others as victims needing to be saved.  Perhaps worst of all, anyone with addictive tendencies finds themselves unable to cease over-indulging in this new nirvana--neglecting every other aspect of their existence.  Many negatives here, but at least this technology is a basic extension of what we already have to some extent with fledgling virtual reality--and so somewhat manageable.  The transporter being misused gives me far greater fears for 21st century Earth.  The airline industry, automotive industry, and all shipping and logistics companies are rendered 'captain dunsels'. Disgruntled unemployed pilots, teamsters, a shipping company employees are legion.  Plastic explosives mysteriously materialize in the middle of a corporate board meeting.  Then a hydrogen bomb materializes in the middle of Time's Square on New Year's.  A woman who has been abused by her husband for years tampers with her home transporter and her husband materializes without all his...parts intact.  A long-time business rival suddenly wakes up 20,000 feet in the air, falling fast with no parachute.  World leaders of rival nations are beamed out in the middle of their speeches and find themselves stranded at sea, in shark infested waters.  Others simply fall over dead, cause of death: heart was beamed out of chest and materialized on the table next to them.  Others misuse the technology, not to kill or destroy but to create.  A couple who could not have children induce a Tuvik-style accident, fusing themselves into becoming their own ""child"".  A person in need of a kidney transplant induces a Thomas Riker duplication, then kills his duplicate to harvest (then has an existential crisis when he can't determine if he is the duplicate or the original).  Theft from previously secure locations skyrockets.  Sometimes transporter thieves beam in and steal items, other times the most sophisticated targeting scanners allow thieves to simply beam out the valuables.  Entire countries are taken over when troops suddenly appear en-mass in neighboring nations.  Those same troops are then beamed into an active volcano by the invaded nation in retaliation (or just stored in a matter stream to be ransomed or held without a trial indefinitely).  Many people, fearing death, attempt to achieve suspended animation inside a transporter beam.  Religious fanatics begin attacking those who have ""lost their souls"" by the act of beaming.  Teenagers new favorite prank ""sperming"" involves sperm whales suddenly materializing thirty feet in the air above major events, like the presidential inauguration or red carpet movie premieres.  I hate to be such a pessimist here, but without Gene's optimistic changes to humanity becoming prevalent, the potentially deadly abuses of transporter technology seem to outweigh the potential negatives of holodeck tech.  From a risk-minimization perspective, I would advocate our having holodecks over our having transporters."

DaystromInstitute,3dzvdx,Ubergopher,9,Wed Jul 22 02:41:55 2015 UTC,"I think there used to be this idea that there were other, less efficient forms of FTL travel before Cochrane's warp drive. From this article:   Regarding Vulcan propulsion technology aboard the T'Plana-Hath, Ronald D. Moore commented, ""Certainly Cochrane is credited with the invention of warp drive as we know it in Trek, so we could assume that the Vulcans were using something else – possibly a variant of the contained singularity used by the Romulans. That might have been a much more dangerous and inefficient technology which was quickly abandoned by most of the galaxy when Cochrane's system was introduced."" (AOL chat, 1997)"
DaystromInstitute,3dzvdx,doubtsabouttheking,5,Tue Jul 21 06:36:57 2015 UTC,"He was the right man in the right place at the right time. I don't think other Federation races will deny that had he not done what he had done when he had done it, that first contact would have been delayed and the situation that gave birth to the Federation might not have come to be. The Vulcans found Earth after a global nuclear war that lead to the collapse of most world powers according to First Contact. This enabled the Vulcans to likely have a positive impact on the rebuilding of Earth., As while it is known they held back warp technology, they might have given humanitarian aid in other ways. This action might be the one to cause humans to see the benefits of cooperation between species and the eventual rise of the Federation instead of continuing as the single species United Earth and colonies, which would have lead to something looking more like the other great powers of Trek."
DaystromInstitute,3dzvdx,MrUnpleasant,4,Mon Jul 20 23:11:34 2015 UTC,"The arrival of the Vulcans brought the end to poverty in only 50 years.  Think about that.  Humanity was suffering a post-apocalyptic existence. Then the Vulcans showed up.  A half century later, there was no poverty anywhere on Earth.  By the way, most of us reading this will live longer than 50 years.  Can you imagine seeing such a change in your lifetime.  Heck, I'm 40, and it trips me out when I think back to the first time I saw a VCR and then torrent a movie in four minutes."

DaystromInstitute,3dzvdx,Neo_Techni,2,Mon Jul 20 21:59:18 2015 UTC,What we see is the human perspective. You have to imagine you're a fly on the wall of a human Federation ship. There are Vulcan Federation ships and other Federation ships dominated by other races. They probably mention Cochrane as much as humans mention Sarek.
DaystromInstitute,3dzvdx,weRborg,2,Tue Jul 21 07:31:17 2015 UTC,"You have a mostly human crew in all the series.  They all had a personal affinity towards Cochrane's story for the same reason Worf had affinities to klingon historical figures.  That being said,  I'm sure that due to the nature of the federation,  every race learns of Cochrane."
DaystromInstitute,3dzikx,I_AM_IGNIGNOTK,23,Mon Jul 20 20:12:14 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is generally considered a violation of sorts.  This is addressed in more detail not with mind melds, but with a race of memory manipulators from TNG episode ""Violations"".  The reason the one in Voyager suffered no consequences was because of the extreme circumstances at the time.  He wasn't in full control of his actions, due to his pon farr.  People were more concerned about helping him, because his life was in danger, rather than disciplining him for unstable behavior that was beyond his control."
DaystromInstitute,3dzikx,time_axis,7,Mon Jul 20 20:24:28 2015 UTC,"So a Vulcan not experiencing his Pon Farr, who would be expected to be in control of his actions, would be more culpable for a sexual assault or mind-meld?    I'm wondering if the intention for a mindmeld would make a difference or if they're all the same.  Tuvok's use seemed totally legit, but the one against T'Pol seemed totally dark and reminiscent of an SVU episode."
DaystromInstitute,3dzikx,Berggeist,16,Mon Jul 20 20:30:26 2015 UTC,"I think intent definitely matters. Spock and Saavik are gentle during Star Trek 3; it calms a terrified teenage caveman Spock. Then in Star Trek 6 when Spock pries what information he can from a certain traitor, she lets out some pretty uncontrolled and definitely unpleasant almost gutteral cries with a look of horror. And while it's not a Vulcan mindmeld, we do see intrusive mind-rape in Nemesis."
DaystromInstitute,3dzikx,4d2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:40:56 2015 UTC,"I'd like to think that the reason for those screams was her realization of the severe disappoint that Spock had for her.  Not that it matters much to your point, just a bit of headcanon."
DaystromInstitute,3dzikx,darkgauss,2,Tue Jul 21 15:46:48 2015 UTC,"I know many people won't care about the ST VI novel has to say, but in the novel, that is how it is played (pretty much mind-rape).  If you pay attention to the movie, watch Spock's face, and listen to his voice and the end.  You can see the repercussions of the forced mind meld even on him.   In the book, he was horrified (in as much as a Vulcan would show it) that he forced the meld that ""deep"" for nothing (looking for the location).  It was very unpleasant to both Spock and Valeris.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1NgX-w54RY"
DaystromInstitute,3dzikx,4d2,2,Tue Jul 21 17:57:32 2015 UTC,"Thats interesting.  I took it differently as I tried to indicate. We assume that it was a Spock forcing that made her scream like if someone was twisting an arm or something. My interpretation was how he unveiled to her in internal horror at his act and she was confronted by his unshielded emotions.  I noticed too how he had lost composure, I prefer to think he was reliving some of that inner rage in that most primal and private of moments they had shared as rapey as it might have been."
DaystromInstitute,3dzikx,Hilomh,2,Tue Jul 21 18:23:34 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about whether or not Spock's forced mind-meld was an illegal assault.  But here's a thought - for humans, it's common for guilty people to plead their innocence, and the law gives the accused the benefit of the doubt.  However, for a Vulcan to commit a crime and then lie about it would be illogical, and a blatant attack against their way of life.  So perhaps it would be logical and permissible for Spock to do what he did, because the circumstances necessitated it.  Vulcans don't get the benefit of the doubt."
DaystromInstitute,3dzikx,time_axis,11,Tue Jul 21 18:48:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know if culpable is the right word.  Remember, in the 23rd/24th centuries, they've moved more toward rehabilitating criminals rather than punishing them.  A Vulcan who violates someone with a mind meld would probably be considered to have something medically wrong with them in some way, and be required to practice some kind of special meditation regimen or something.  Being confined to a rehabilitation facility would be the last resort if they don't comply willingly.  It's very rare for Vulcans to commit crimes in the first place.  Also, I'm not sure which mind meld of Tuvok's you're referring to, but if it's the one with Sooter, Tuvok's use of the mind meld against Sooter was also a violation, but he was also not in full control of his actions at that time.  He was suffering from residual effects of his first mind meld with Sooter, which wasn't against his will, as I recall."
DaystromInstitute,3dzikx,ChiliManiac,3,Mon Jul 20 20:36:10 2015 UTC,"There is a possibility I am confusing Spock's use in I think ST6 (tthe traitorous girl Vulcan? I'm bad with names) with Tuvok's.  I understand Betazoids and other species have entered many a mind without permission, but the mindmeld seems more intrusive because it involves adding a consciousness to the victim/recipient.  Especially with the quasi-sexual vibe with T'Pol  would be like making her experience all the creepy thoughts and feelings this other dude had, which seems like it would be worse than getting vital information while under orders.  Edit:words"
DaystromInstitute,3dzikx,ChiliManiac,2,Mon Jul 20 21:01:42 2015 UTC,"Watch Star Trek Nemesis, Troi is mentally raped by Shinzon and his Viceroy using his powers to imprint himself on her, in the book she's very clearly raped in the turbolift. They actually removed the scene but I think you can find it on the Blu Ray. They felt extending that concept was horrifying. So yea. Absolutely an unwanted Mind Meld would be Rape...at the very least a violation"
DaystromInstitute,3dzikx,Hilomh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:15:28 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen Nemesis in its entirety yet, is the turbolift scene you are referring to a physical assault or  mind invasion?"
DaystromInstitute,3dzikx,time_axis,2,Tue Jul 21 03:27:58 2015 UTC,"Mind invasion, but the way it's portrayed...at least in the book is both. Nemesis got a lot of unnecessary flack I think, for what we Daystrom Institute talk about it's gold. Also it's on Netflix right now so easy to check out. I'll probably be watching it again tonight, I like everything Star Trek tbh. Even Star Trek Generations was fun for me."

I suppose this only complicates the matter, but I'm not sure what to make of it.   They were officers under orders from a superior office, so I believe that while distasteful, they were covered from a legal standpoint.   As to Voric ( i think that's right, the voyager Vulcan) I think B'lenna kick his ass, so he paid. Also, he could argue temporary insanity. Pon Far makes you crazy."

DaystromInstitute,3dzikx,butterhoscotch,5,Tue Jul 21 15:13:57 2015 UTC,"After the cargo-bay-turned-morgue scene from Night Terrors, TNG, I thought that the forced interrogation scene between Spock and Valeris was the most emotionally distressing and horrifying scene in Star Trek. I'm sorry, but the ends don't justify the means, you can't force someone to speak against their will, rights were violated there at the very least. He tortured her for information, and she didn't even have what he was looking for.  I don't know if I'd call such an action a mind-rape, and in this case I wouldn't, but I'd definitely call it an assault."
DaystromInstitute,3dzikx,blueskin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:09:30 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean for that term to be a cacth-all for any psychic invasion, but specifically the scene from ENT.  I know it's a bit of a dramatic term to use, but I honestly feel there was a sexual undertone to the T'Pol incident that other instances lacked.    Other cases I see as assaults as well, and I guess for the most part at some point punching a dude in the face and punching him in the mind are equivalent and equally justifiable/reprehensible considering the circumstances."
DaystromInstitute,3dzikx,IkLms,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:22:11 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but that's how humans think.  We give the accused the benefit of the doubt, and it's common for the guilty to plead innocent.  For Vulcans, lying to protect oneself from punishment is highly illogical, and it might be almost unimaginable for a Vulcan to do what she did.  Spock's actions against her would serve to rectify the situation, which is logical."
DaystromInstitute,3dyos8,mansefson,53,Mon Jul 20 16:43:24 2015 UTC,"It is a huge inconsistency.  It's very obvious that the roles of Scotty and Chekov in Generations were intended for Spcok and McCoy.  You can even tell which individual lines were intended for each character.  Did you ever notice how Scotty mans the sensors and Chekov takes charge in sickbay?  Anyway, since Nimoy and Kelley weren't interested in appearing, they had to go with two runners-up.    To justify the discrepancy, we can just assume Scotty was dazed after spending 75 years in transporter stasis."
DaystromInstitute,3dyos8,MungoBaobab,32,Mon Jul 20 16:53:29 2015 UTC,"To justify the discrepancy, we can just assume Scotty was dazed after spending 75 years in transporter stasis.   Imagine you live and work in a village of 400 people with someone named Bill Smith every day for 20-ish years. You get up, go to work, they're there. You go to lunch, they're at the same cafeteria, you go to the movies after work, they're there as well.  Bill then passes on.  A few years later you are suddenly awakened from a deep sleep and when you ask what's going on someone tells you Bill Smith sent them to get you up. You, still half asleep, jump up and start getting dressed so you can go see your old friend. Then, with your pants halfway on you realize ""Wait a minute isn't Bill... dead?"" And you realize it was Bill Jr. who sent them, and you're sad for a minute.  I'm sure shortly after Scotty got out of the transporter room he remembered what was happening and got a bit depressed."

Relics takes place in 2369.  75 years before that, was 2294.  The Enterprise B incident took place 1 year earlier, 2293. Even is Scotty wasn't on the ship, I would think the news would have reached him, as he wasn't on the Jenolan for at least a couple of months after Kirk's apparent death.    The explanation of Scotty simply being a tad senile fits the episode's theme and is what I go with in my head."

It's clear that this was a B'rel class Bird of Prey, i.e. the Little One, and not the destroyer-sized K'Vort class.  Surely the Enterprise could have overpowered it with brute force.

DaystromInstitute,3dyos8,Berggeist,14,Mon Jul 20 19:12:39 2015 UTC,"No way. The E-D sets were not suitable for the better visual quality of film, which is one of the reasons why the internal lighting is kept so extreme. They're doing everything they can to minimize how awful it'd look. On top of that working with the physical model of the E-D for a movie was also difficult because of the uneven distribution of weight and the extra work needed to make the model worth filming and capable of doing the motion needed.  The E-D was a great ship, but the silver screen was her final frontier. And sadly by Insurrection they wouldn't even use physical models."
DaystromInstitute,3dyos8,mistakenotmy,5,Mon Jul 20 20:34:33 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I buy the sets not looking good enough.  They redressed a few of the TNG sets for ST:VI. The conference room, transporter room, and corridors if my memory doesn't fail me (maybe more).  I always heard the lighting change was because it was a movie. Movies are ""suppose to be"" more dynamic and cinematic than TV.  Where TV lighting in the 80's was always fairly flat (and rarely changed after a series sets a tone).  I liked what they did with the lighting.  It doesn't make sense in-universe, but it looked cool."
DaystromInstitute,3dyos8,KingofDerby,3,Mon Jul 20 20:55:53 2015 UTC,"Rather than sets, people say it's the design of the D itself. It's squat, and thus well shaped for 4:3 TV, while the E is long and sleek, to better fit the wide screen of film."
DaystromInstitute,3dyos8,mistakenotmy,3,Tue Jul 21 14:21:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have seen that argument as well but never found it all that compelling.  There are many ways to frame either ship to look good for either aspect.  Besides the E-D is so big it could use the extra screen real estate :)  I always thought the D suffered from the model having to be mounted upside down.  Meaning the top was hard to shoot.  So it got a lot of low angle shots.  When the ship looks best from the top.  In my opinion anyway."
DaystromInstitute,3dyos8,Berggeist,5,Tue Jul 21 14:31:22 2015 UTC,"TV also had the advantage of lower quality thanks to broadcast, which you can plan around. One of the problems encountered during the remastering of TNG was pieces of black construction paper used to cover parts of screens becoming visible, precisely because they were relying on the lower quality to blend it back.   Wikipedia also cites an interview with Zimmerman as this being part of the reason, but without an actual copy of the interview on hand I can't say whether that's out of context or not."
DaystromInstitute,3dyos8,mistakenotmy,5,Mon Jul 20 21:48:19 2015 UTC,"True, you can get away with more on TV.  They took advantage of that a lot.  The cardboard was put on the science stations because the glass reflected the studio lights/cameras/performers. They did fix that though.    From Ex Astris (http://www.ex-astris-scientia.org/inconsistencies/bloopers.htm)   The black cards went away because we got a new Director of Photography, Marvin Rush, replacing Ed Brown. Marvin lit the sets much more dynamically (less 'flat') and so he didn't have as much overall light. Also as film got better, technologically, it needed less light.   So it wasn't so much the sets were low quality and that they couldn't be used for film. We know they were used for ST:VI (and ST:V) prior to Generations.  From Memory Alpha:   Filming took place during the break between the fourth and fifth seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation. Most of the Enterprise-A sets were redresses of USS Enterprise-D sets:   Kirk and Spock's quarters (Data's quarters, which were originally Kirk's quarters from Star Trek: The Motion Picture) Transporter room (Enterprise-D transporter room) Sickbay (Enterprise-D sickbay) Laboratory (Beverly Crusher's office) Officer's mess hall (the dining room, redress of Enterprise-D observation lounge) Engineering (clear redress of the Enterprise-D engineering; they simply replaced the display graphics and repainted some surfaces) Corridors (retouched with more metallic appearance)   These sets had been in turn recycled by TNG from the first three movies. The TNG warp core was a complete redress of the first movie's warp plasma conduits, Data's quarters a redress of Kirk's and Ilia's quarters. Even the sickbay from TNG was recycled from the movies' sickbay."
DaystromInstitute,3dyos8,Berggeist,3,Mon Jul 20 23:06:11 2015 UTC,"Sure sets have been reused, but look at how many of those redresses also alter the lighting scheme, and when they don't, how painfully they stand out. The other option is to provide an extra focal points, such as the glass ornamentation in the dining room, or obscuring, such as the people standing around while the camera gets close-ups of their face in engineering.  You'll also note in your citation that film got better technologically. Sets that held up for 1970's films and 80s-90s tv (with a certain economy of shots; lots of A-camera switching to B-camera; a lot of familiar camera angles) aren't going to lend themselves to newer camera and film advancements."
DaystromInstitute,3dyos8,mistakenotmy,3,Tue Jul 21 00:01:13 2015 UTC,"Of course they change the lighting scheme.  It was a movie and a different level of production.  I don't really think any of those sets stood out.  I for one didn't realize they re-used so many sets  until only a few years ago.  Yes film did get better.  In fact it got better to the point that some of the flaws could be worked around.  Could the sets have been better, maybe.  However, they were used on films prior to Generations.   (I don't really think the economy of shots you describe is set related.  On TV the production has to go fast.  They need ~43 min from 7 days of shooting.  You use standard shots so setups can go quick.  Where a movie has a whole lot more time, many many weeks for 120min.)"
DaystromInstitute,3dyos8,Kichigai,2,Tue Jul 21 00:34:21 2015 UTC,"They redressed a few of the TNG sets for ST:VI. The conference room, transporter room, and corridors if my memory doesn't fail me (maybe more).   Actually, a lot of the TNG sets are from the TOS movies. All the hallways, some of the rooms, very little of it was original. Hell, even the ceiling of the TNG Transporter is the floor from the TOS transporter, they just repainted it black.  But therein lies the problem: these sets were very old. A lot of them had been around since 1979, and had just spent the last seven years running up to this in heavy use. They had seen their use, and wouldn't have held up unto too much scrutiny.  Hence why there was a lot of refurbishment. New carpeting was installed, workstations were tweaked, etc. etc. They were going to have to do a lot of it anyway, so they may as well improve the stuff while they're at it.   I always heard the lighting change was because it was a movie.   This is where I agree with you. Film offers greater dynamic range, so they can really push the contrast around. Not only that, but you're sitting in a darkened room for 90-some-odd minutes, staring at a reflection of a flickering light. That can strain the eyes a bit if not properly tempered."

Granted, the design didn't look nearly as dated as the original Constitution-class did prior to the refit, but the model itself was never designed for the big screen, and you can really see it. They only held on to the existing model because the movie had a very low budget. I think there's a story floating around out there that the budget was so constrained that they had to recycle costumes from DS9, hence why some cast members' uniforms don't fit well.  The other reason was Voyager. DS9 was consuming a huge amount of studio space at Paramount, especially with its enormous Promenade set, which I believe still holds the record for largest functional set in television history. With Voyager on the way they had to make room, and the only reason they held on to the TNG sets was as a budget cutting play. They had been talking about making a movie since season six, so they just kept the sets up for the movie. No sense spending a bunch of money rebuilding everything from scratch if you don't have to."
DaystromInstitute,3dyos8,TEG24601,2,Tue Jul 21 05:08:47 2015 UTC,"The uniform situation was due to them having spent their money for new uniforms, then ditching them after a few weeks of shooting.  Supposedly, the original plan for Voyager was to redress the TNG sets, but after they destroyed the bridge, that went out the window.  You have to remember, they were filming Generations during Season 7, so they were planning a lot of things.  It wasn't until they filmed AGT, that they modified, then destroyed the bridge.  It really hadn't been in the plan, which is why they had upgraded the bridge."
DaystromInstitute,3dyos8,anglachel1,2,Tue Jul 21 06:14:27 2015 UTC,Generations is terrible   Why?
DaystromInstitute,3dyos8,Kichigai,3,Mon Jul 20 22:24:08 2015 UTC,"Enormous gaping plot holes for one. For instance, if Kirk was so easily dissilusioned with the Nexus being fake, and felt the Universe ""owed [him] one,"" then why didn't he just say ""screw it"" and go back to the actual time he was going to propose and actually do it? Thus changing the course of history, possibly preventing Soren from ever having been rescued from the Nexus, and there wouldn't have been a thing Picard could have done about it. Kirk wouldn't need to tell him what he was doing.  For that matter, how the hell do you even leave the Nexus? Or why didn't the Enterprise-D just spray the whole area with phasers to reveal the Bird of Prey? Or take a page from Data's book and use modified torpedos?  Or why didn't Picard just go further back in time, before consulting with Data in Stellar Cartography, right after the incident at Armagosa, and simply direct the Enterprise there at high warp and tell them where to look for Soren? Sure, he doesn't know where on the planet, but can say it's on the planet, and probably this continent, thus reducing the time they need for a lock to shoot it down to a reasonable one.  I mean, he's already violating the temporal prime directive not just by going back to the planet (it's such a short time frame that it's easily dismissed) but by bringing Kirk to the future. I think Star Fleet probably would have forgiven this infraction, especially if they forgave Sisko's.  It was a pretty weak entry to the series. Not Final Frontier awful, but just not good."
DaystromInstitute,3dyos8,disposable_pants,3,Tue Jul 21 05:18:38 2015 UTC,Or take a page from Data's book and use modified torpedos?   Are you referring to Spock's homing torpedoes in The Undiscovered Country?
DaystromInstitute,3dyos8,Kichigai,3,Tue Jul 21 09:05:03 2015 UTC,"No, I was thinking of the trick Data used while in command of the USS Sutherland during the Klingon Civil War. He scanned for anomalous readings and then hit his targets with torpedos reconfigured to reveal the Romulan convoy.  I figured that since 80 years had passed between the Khitomer peace talks and the events of Generations that the Klingons probably would have figured out how to mitigate the weakness that Spock had figured out. I mean, yes, they signed a peace deal with the Federation, but they still had to deal with the Romulans and everyone else bordering the Empire."

DaystromInstitute,3dyos8,Ambarenya,16,Tue Jul 21 19:39:28 2015 UTC,"Personal explanation: Scotty never truly believed Kirk was dead.   CHEKOV: My God! Was anyvone in here?  SCOTTY: Aye...   Note that no one in that scene ever says definitively that Kirk had died. I interpret the 'aye' as Scotty gazing out and wondering what actually happened to his Captain. Remember, there was no body, or anything that would indicate Kirk died right then and there. I mean, think about it, Scotty was the one running the show with the sensors and the transporter during the entire rescue operation and could see the weird effects that the Nexus had on the El-Aurians.    SCOTTY: What the hell!  SCOTTY: Their life signs are ...are phasing in and out of our space-time continuum!   He probably knew right off the bat that something weird was going on, especially when the Nexus seemingly 'retaliated' to the Enterprise-B's deflector pulse hitting it, specifically targeting Kirk, the guy who enabled the deflector pulse. Scotty must have asked: why would a natural phenomenon react in such an intelligent manner?  Furthermore, assuming he and Chekov spoke to eachother at length after the event (almost certain they did), Chekov would have told him about the incident with one of the El-Aurians in the Enterprise-B corridors:   SORAN: No. No, I have to go. I have to go back.  SORAN: You don't understand! Let me go back! Let me go back! Let me go back! Let me go back, please!   Recall that Chekov was in close proximity to Soran, and was the one who ended up tranquilizing him after he went out of control. It probably wouldn't have been too hard for Scotty and Chekov to put two and two together to surmise that this weird energy ribbon, that passes through the Galaxy only every 39.1 years, is in fact some kind of strange (perhaps living) dimensional portal. Unfortunately, we know that Scotty went missing along with the Jenolan in 2294, only a year after Nexus incident and Chekov seemingly dies sometime between 2293 and 2364, since he doesn't appear at all after the beginning of Generations, and has a ship named after him by the mid-24th Century. The Nexus would not have come around again until 2332, by that point there was no Scotty and perhaps no Chekov.  Ultimately, I think Scotty accompanied his Captain on enough 'no-win' scenarios to know that there was always a chance that James Kirk could return. In ""Relics"" Scotty was speaking somewhat metaphorically or jokingly, but perhaps with a hint of real hope that Kirk really was still out there. Some how, some way, he knew his Captain was still alive.  *edit for clarity"

Note: He was right!  It's completely understandable, given the things they've been through, for him to believe that Kirk could not only come back from the dead, but also commandeer the Enterprise and mount a rescue.  I mean, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy all died (or ""died"" in Kirk's case, maybe in McCoy's) at least once during their travels and came back. They've erased the Federation's entire history together at least once. He and Kirk have broken or discovered laws of physics together, talked down androids from another galaxy, and killed gods.  What's a little inconvenience like death to James Tiberius Kirk?"
DaystromInstitute,3dyos8,mastersyrron,8,Mon Jul 20 22:57:57 2015 UTC,"This has been explained as Scotty having ""transport amnesia"" or something after being in the pattern buffer for 75 years.  Some breakdown of his pattern or whatnot... Just lucky he didn't come out missing an arm, I guess."
DaystromInstitute,3dyos8,theDagman,8,Mon Jul 20 17:42:15 2015 UTC,"I have the solution that makes perfect sense. The reason Scotty doesn't know Kirk is ""dead"" in Relics is because he had not lived through that experience yet.  Allow me to explain...  Obviously, for Scotty to think Kirk had come to rescue him, at the time when he was marooned on the Dyson sphere Kirk was alive. And at the end of Relics, Scotty was left feeling old, alone, and quite homesick for his own time period.  So he took that nifty 24th century warp shuttle Picard and co. gave him, accessed the library computer for Unrecommended Warp Maneuvers, went to the sub-heading of Cpt. James T. Kirk 5 year mission, to retrieve Spock's notes on sling-shot time travel. From that, he plotted a course that would take him back in time to the period just after his ship was marooned on the sphere. And he made it back in time to attend the christening of the Enterprise-B and the apparent death of Jim Kirk. All he has to do to make sure there is no paradox is not tell anyone that he already exists in a transporter buffer in a crashed ship on the outer surface of a Dyson sphere.  As, for further evidence that this is, in fact, what happened: If you compare the visual records of both events, you can see that Scotty was subtly older in Generations than he was in Relics.

As well as the destruction of the first star that was destroyed and the Enterprise-D.  Picard did not need Kirk to stop Soran. He simply should have chosen to leave the Nexus a week early and aboard the Enterprise. Then he could have sent a warning to his brother Robert and son to avert their deaths in the vineyard fire. Then simply wait to rescue Soran as the Enterprise did originally. Just when he sees Soran later in Ten Forward, and Soran does his ""Time is the fire..."" line, he says ""Yeah, right. Mr. Worf, arrest this man and throw him into the brig! Picard to LaForge, be careful when searching Soran's lab. Search for trilithium signatures hidden by a magnetic field cloak.

DaystromInstitute,3e097b,grapp,5,Mon Jul 20 23:27:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure there'd be much point to colonizing the Kuiper belt, and the Oort cloud is so far out that you may as well just go on to Alpha Centauri.  After getting off Earth, the first place you're going to go is The Moon. Next comes Mars, and it's two natural satellites. From there you have the main belt asteroids, dominated by Ceres and Vesta, but with millions more that are smaller. Then you've got the Jovian moons with their wonderful supplies of water ice, and if that's not enough for you, there are three more gas giants beyond that each with their own supply of satellites.  Based on dialog from First Contact, I'd guess that humanity was still (or perhaps once again, after WWIII) stuck on Earth when warp drive was invented. Even if we continue to exploit the natural resources of our native system at that point, it's going to be centuries at least before anyone even has to think about building habitats past Neptune. There's just so much stuff closer to home."

There is no chance that Earths space capabilities were solely devoted to those other systems while its own backyard was ignored. It's probable that many chunks of space debris were mined out in order to provide the raw material for these new craft (cheaper to construct in space) for that reason I'd say there was probably a booming industry out on the far reaches of the solar system at multiple different points with the particularly large pieces of rock serving as refinery platforms."

DaystromInstitute,3dys8a,Twilight_Ike_Galaxy,30,Mon Jul 20 17:06:58 2015 UTC,"Use of contractions is more frequent in informal communications. Vulcans tend to be very formal. Secondly, the (minor) decrease in the time it takes to speak the sentence is accompanied by a (minor) increase in the probability that you might be misunderstood. They may value being understood with shaving a few tenths of a second off their speaking time."
DaystromInstitute,3dys8a,drafterman,15,Mon Jul 20 17:53:56 2015 UTC,English is probably not their first language. (Maybe Spock was raised bilingual but in general...) Perhaps Vulcan dialects don't have contractions and it feels clumsy or wrong to them. They also seem to favor formality and might not want to use more casual language.
DaystromInstitute,3dys8a,MissCherryPi,4,Mon Jul 20 17:29:11 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of Vulcans took the time to learn to speak English themselves, rather than rely on the universal translator.   If they were learning from formal training materials, then that's another reason why they wouldn't be in the habit of using contractions."
DaystromInstitute,3dys8a,dodriohedron,8,Mon Jul 20 20:02:50 2015 UTC,"One possibility is that the Vulcan language itself doesn't modify words in the way that English does, so they're simply not used to contracting words together like that.  Perhaps in Vulcan, they simply have more words in general, and instead of smashing two existing words together they use a third short word instead, so the concept is a bit foreign."
DaystromInstitute,3dys8a,JaronK,8,Mon Jul 20 18:03:44 2015 UTC,"A few reasons, I would guess. First, there is the high likelihood that English (or 'Federation Standard') is not the Vulcans' first language (it's possible Spock learned it from his mother, but Tuvok and T'Pol and others as full blooded Vulcans probably learned it later). Spock, for example, sometimes struggles with idioms that his colleagues use. As an ESL teacher, I know that my students often will not use contractions in speech because they are not completely comfortable with the sounds, or because they learned the grammar as two words, and it's a hard habit to break. There's also the matter of being sure when the correct time to use contractions in a sentence even is. It comes naturally to native speakers, but less so to those whose first language isn't English. You'll notice that the Vulcans generally speak more slowly and deliberately than the humans (even if not by very much)-- again, this is something second language speakers do in order to be sure they're being clearly understood and to give themselves a few extra seconds to make sure they've used the right words. Vulcans, even more than humans speaking another language, value accuracy and precision over maximum efficiency.  Another issue is formality. We usually hear Vulcans speaking to fellow officers or other officials, even in off-duty situations. Because Vulcan culture is different from human culture, both by being less personally intimate and by being more ritualistic overall, using the more formal grammar rather than the informal contractions sets and reinforces interpersonal boundaries. The insistence on formality is part of what makes them sound so alien, robotic, and like a computer to human ears. Additionally, this insistence on formality is usually a cue to the audience that the Vulcans are more elegant and  refined than humans. This is also why the Vulcans don't shorten words even more by saying things like, ""The thrusters aren't firin' accordin' to proper specs,"" rather than ""The thrusters are not firing according to proper specifications."""
DaystromInstitute,3dys8a,fishey_me,2,Mon Jul 20 17:54:17 2015 UTC,"Similarly, why can't Data use contractions? He was so proud when his creation/daughter  Lal (spelling?) used a contraction because he couldn't."
DaystromInstitute,3dys8a,SenorAnonymous,8,Mon Jul 20 19:47:11 2015 UTC,"If I recall, I think he was programmed that way because of Lore.  Lore was too human in some ways, and was dangerous.  Data is less human and more robotic.  Only through patience, observation, and introspection (qualities which Lore lacked) could Data then ""learn"" about how to be more human.   What I've always wondered is: why does Worf rarely use contractions?"

DaystromInstitute,3dykfp,dishpandan,3,Mon Jul 20 16:12:36 2015 UTC,"but I do not understand how holograms can damage the ship with their bullets while the safety measures are on.   Holograms with forcefields for ""substance.""   I'd venture a theory that like in current game engines where certain regions in memory aren't rendered if you're not relatively close to it, the holodeck also ""culls"" the forcefields of any objects that are not in a state to be touched by a human actor soon, with safeties culling them if they can potentially cause harm to them also.   Drawing forcefields is probably programatically easy (safeties where you have to simulate the interactions is system intensive), but power intensive, so in the Voyager situation the safety subroutines were ""pushed out"" of the simulation before the circuits for it were cut."
DaystromInstitute,3dykfp,Aperture_Kubi,2,Mon Jul 20 19:58:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I like this concept.   This makes sense to me, especially because our understanding of holodecks involves them only rendering the things that are around the people in there and not an entire world out of sight. In that way it is very similar to some of today's game engines as you described.   I would add to that, maybe the safety protocols are only for protecting those people. They do not protect the holograms from the people (or from the other holograms) as we've seen in various instances.   So how does that come into play with the ship's interfaces? To build on your game engine theory, the NPCs in our games do not know they are even in a game. So if we are to assume that they would never have that knowledge, then there is no reason to code the game to wall off the engine (or the computer hardware itself) from these virtual characters. Even if they could see it in front of them like in a holodeck, they just wouldn't register its existence. Therefore it is not necessary to protect it in the same way that the crew must be protected while inside in the case of Voyager.  Related, all software does is allow us to interact with hardware. In the holodeck, the computer panel is the GUI which can manipulate the program and its settings. Regardless of where it appears to be in the virtual world, it is always occupying the same physical space, like the ""arch"" exit. I am not sure why damaging that would result in a broken program, as I doubt the holodeck computer \ program is integrated into the touchscreen rather than just displayed there.  Having said that, it still seems strange that a holographic bullet can damage a real system! What if I load up a Manhattan Project program for study and detonate an atomic bomb?"
DaystromInstitute,3dykfp,Aperture_Kubi,3,Mon Jul 20 20:28:55 2015 UTC,"Well they have to be able to register the player characters and anything they bring in (wear).   I've only touched a bit on gaming development (Unity tutorials), but think of it this way: everything is tagged certain categories, and there are subroutines that cull these objects to both the NPCs and the players. Assuming said subroutines are low priority, and the actors' AI are high, it's safe to assume the culling routines aren't being called every frame, and default operation would be that force fields are active on all holograms on grid (as in close to the players) and the AI perceives everything also on grid."
DaystromInstitute,3dvtl1,Cranyx,60,Sun Jul 19 23:17:22 2015 UTC,"Sonic Showers I believe were mostly easier. Having running water requires pumps, conduits, etc. Rather than just having a power source and transformer, they probably also leave less of a mess and are a lot more time efficient.  As for technologies that sound sciencey. Data's Positronic brain comes to mind. Positrons are just antimatter electrons, so the same in every way, but with reversed charge and the tendancy to explode when they come into contact with electrons (which are everywhere).

Parrises Squares is clearly an effort to show the characters are engaged in something futuristic, but the lack of more conventional sports seems odd. I mean, baseball is the most popular sport in Japan and much of Latin America, its place in American culture is secure despite near-constant handwringing about it for the last twenty years, and it's pretty popular in a handful of other nations, but apparently by 2045 they canceled the World Series because nobody was coming to the games.

That's possible, I'm not saying it's not, but it's also kind of a stretch, given the sport's popularity. Sure, it's like 300 years from now, and nobody remembers how ""Rounders"" works today, but that's the thing -- it completely died out and there is no continuation of baseball in any form beyond what is basically historical reenactment. You mean to tell me that not even Japanese or American high schools kept the game going? What the hell happened?  I think it would be more likely that baseball would just change, or there would be a new sport very similar to baseball (much like the relationship between older bat-and-ball games and baseball today).

Trek-style transporters are probably impossible, but not for that reason. The uncertainty principle applies to position and momentum, not speed and mass. And it doesn't say you can't know both of them; it says you can't know both of them precisely.   You can still measure a particle's position to within a nanometer, and its momentum to within much less than the random fluctuations from thermal energy, without violating the uncertainty principle. And that might well be more precision than is needed to scan and replicate biological systems."

DaystromInstitute,3dvtl1,sowr,10,Mon Jul 20 20:58:12 2015 UTC,"Competitive strategies can be interesting. If you're playing someone who has a super-computer for a mind then you have to adjust your frame of reference because you can't hope to out-analyze them on pure logic. Similarly, when fighting a war against a massively superior enemy you have to rethink what war is. War used to be two armies lining up, exchanging arrows or rifle vollies, and then sending in ground troops and mounted units to finish the fight. You would announce yourselves and perhaps offer terms before fighting. This was done differently depending on what continent and cultures you're talking about. That obviously won't work when you're 500 people against 5,000, or you've got bazookas versus high altitude laser-guided bombs. Asymmetrical warfare is what we call it most times (or terrorism if you need to rally support at home after losing battles against a vastly inferior force). The same can work in competitive games, you just have to change your goals and tactics. In traditional chess there's less leeway, but the 3D chess seems to open new possibilities. The best example I can think of is in collectible card games like Magic: The Gathering. The stated goal of the game is to damage your opponent enough that their life points are reduced to 0 and you win. How that's done is up to you, your deck and your tactics. However, that's not always the only way to win. If you build a ""delay deck"" so that you can always counter, negate or otherwise invalidate the cards your opponent is playing, then you can stay alive just about forever. You won't do any damage to your opponent, but they can't hurt you either. In fact, any time they try a new strategy it just doesn't work because you're only interested in blocking them, not beating them. After a while they will either have to resort to very foolish tactics to get around your strategy, and that will often open them up to damage. That or they just ragequit, like the alien war games observer did when playing that 3D hologram game rematch against Data in TNG. Their forfeit is also your win.  There is logic to it, most definitely, but it's not the straightforward, linear logic that Vulcans and Androids seem to come pre-programmed with."

That movie doesn't get nearly enough love around here. Think about it, the movie is full of cool action sequences - Kirk and co steal the Enterprise, battle and are defeated by a Klingon Bird of Prey, Kirk lures Kruge into a trap in which most of the Klingon crew is killed (and destroys the beloved Enterprise in awesome fashion), Kirk's son is killed on the planet in a short but intense battle, Kirk and Kruge battle it out in epic fashion and Kirk barely manages an escape - but no, that's not the most tense moment of the fucking movie.  The moment with the most tension comes at the end after McCoy and Spock have spent a grueling night undergoing the ceremony where Spock's Katra is transferred from McCoy's brain to Spocks. It's immediately apparent that McCoy is fine, but what about Spock? Kirk, Scotty, Sulu, Chekov, Uhura, and McCoy have stolen a Federation Starship, traveled to a planet that's forbidden by order of the Federation council, engaged in battle with a Klingon warship, killed most of it's crew, stolen the warship, and witnessed the destruction of the planet all to save Spock. And he walks right past them, unaware of who they are, how close they all are, and what they've just done for him. They look devastated. Their careers and their futures as free peoples may have just been sacrificed for nothing. Then he turns around and starts to recall information.  Aaaand the audience breathes again.

The only other scene I can think of where a Klingon was this brutal was when Duras beat K'helyr to death."
DaystromInstitute,3dwkg2,House_of_Suns,4,Tue Jul 21 00:47:07 2015 UTC,"I think by DS9 it was more posturing than viciousness.   There's a reason for that (and it makes total sense). Before the events of The Undiscovered Country, the Klingon Empire was incredibly strong and independent. They could afford to be as vicious as they please. A full on war with the Federation wouldn't result in the complete collapse of the Empire. At most, they'd lose a system or two, but there's no way the Federation would commit enough ships and personnel to fully defeat the Empire.  The Praxis explodes. The Klingon Empire either collapses in a decade, or they turn to the Federation and the Feds prop them up (which is exactly what happened). By the TNG era, the Klingons were as vicious as they could be while still maintaining their relationship with the Federation. It certainly seems like the Federation tolerates as much Klingon-on-Klingon violence as they can handle, but they moment they launch a full scale war on the Cardassians, the deal is off.  It's worth noting that the Federation does appear to tolerate a small degree of military action by the Klingon Empire. There's an exchange between Garak and someone (I forget) about the Betreka Nebula Incident, which was apparently a lot of light skirmishing that went on for 18 years."
DaystromInstitute,3dwkg2,71Christopher,13,Tue Jul 21 01:05:37 2015 UTC,"Has to be Riker saying ""...fire.""  So much led up to that moment - decisions about command, discussions of his role, Shelby challenging him, and the implication that he could not make the big decision.  Plus, it was a turning point in the series, moving from minster of the week episodes to true character arcs.  TBOBW pts 1&2 and the episode with Picard in France (name escapes me right now) demonstrated the full potential of the series, and established it as mature in its own right."
DaystromInstitute,3dwkg2,timschwartz,6,Mon Jul 20 04:06:36 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that Riker was seriously considering taking captaincy of the Melbourne. If he had, things might have been drastically different for him."

As far as he knows, Worf is dead, the Cardassians have Beverly, and the Enterprise has been destroyed. He is seriously considering abandoning the Federation and giving up to avoid more torture. Knowing Stewart's involvement with Amnesty International and how seriously he took this episode brings Picard to life like no other scene in my mind."

When Quark and Garak are talking about Root Beer, how it's revolting yet so ""bubbly and happy"","" just like the Federation. The second opening scene of Into Darkness, when a Starfleet officer decides to bomb a government building to save his daughter's life. It was a pretty emotional scene. Quark talking to Nog about humans during the siege of AR-588. Shows that all living creatures are defined by their environment and surroundings. No species is inherently war like, violent, or peaceful. Opening theme of In the Mirror Darkly episodes.  Battle of Sector 001. Eddington talking to Sisko of how the Federation is more insidious than the Borg. ""Even the Cardassians have their rightful place on the Federation council."" Ironically, Cardassia may end up joining the Federation after DS9. Sisko monologue at the beginning of The Pale Moonlight."
DaystromInstitute,3dwkg2,71Christopher,8,Mon Jul 20 17:36:18 2015 UTC,"Every exchange between Kira and Marritza. Duet was an amazing episode. I love it especially because it represents the direction DS9 took in its portrayal of the more familiar races and what ultimately made it my favorite show.  I love TNG and the issues it tackled, but I always felt the non-human races were still somewhat two-dimensional. At least compared to DS9, which broke down some of the stereotypes. Characters like Marritza, Rom, Tekeny Ghemor, Sloan, Winn, Eddington, etc. make us take a hard look at Trek's societies and what happens when their philosophies are challenged."
DaystromInstitute,3dwkg2,Chaff5,6,Mon Jul 20 14:56:40 2015 UTC,"While DS9 is popular because of its lengthy dominion arc and dark under tones, this scene to me has always been the most powerful.

DaystromInstitute,3dwkg2,Berggeist,5,Tue Jul 21 00:55:16 2015 UTC,"This off the top of my head is one of my most favorite scenes, actually couple of scenes really.   The last portion of ""City on the Edge of Forever"",  where  Kirk and Spock finally catch up with McCoy, and Kirk prevents McCoy from saving Edith Keeler thereby restoring the timeline.  The anguish on Kirk's face, knowing that he has just let the woman he loves, quite possibly the woman of his dreams die, is just incredible.  McCoy's disbelief in what has just happend. Their return to the present, finding the time line restored.  The emotion on his face when he says ""Let's get the hell out of here"", that's a heartbreakingly beautiful moment.  I actually think it's better than the Spock death scene in The Wrath of Kahn, which is awesome also.    I truly think that in Generations, Picard should have found Kirk living in the past with Edith instead of that made up scene that makes little sense and adds little to the lore."

He cites actual experience as his reason, but he is so emotional you can tell he's caught off guard and it all comes off unprocessed. He's angry at Sim asking to live.

The first is the Klingon crash landing in an Oklahoma cornfield, which seemed to promise so much of what the show could be -- really exploring the jarring contrast between our workaday reality and the utopia of Star Trek, giving us some idea of ""getting from there to here."" The second is the scene from the season finale cliffhanger where Archer is trapped with Daniels in the ruined future. It was bold and also ""cinematic"" in a way that the TV shows rarely aspired to."
DaystromInstitute,3dwhqw,DasJuden63,19,Mon Jul 20 02:52:52 2015 UTC,"Picard was chosen explicitly because of his experience with theta band carrier waves, a signature of metagenic weapons. It's likely they gave him discretion to select his own team. However, he notes that it was ""one"" of the reasons he was selected.  The other is not stated overtly, but it should be obvious that they wanted to get Picard out of the way to make room for Jellico. As much as people may harp on his abrasive command style, it's abundantly clear he was the perfect tool for that specific mission. He was never intended to be a permanent replacement for Picard (unless things went south) and he was there to deal with the Cardassians. Period. That's why Riker was passed over and why Jellico acted like he did. He didn't have time to warm up to the crew in a normal fashion.  It's highly likely that Starfleet Command felt that Picard's diplomatic style simply was not appropriate for dealing with the Cardassians, whom they suspected of exploiting the Federation's forgiving nature, verging on appeasement. Picard is king of the compromise, finding the middle way that pleases all parties. The problem is that this depends on both sides actually being sincere in finding a solution. The Cardassians quickly learned they could exploit this to their favor. While Picard isn't against dropping the hammer, he usually does this as a last resort. They needed someone to do this from the get-go.  In short, the needed the Enterprise - the flag ship - as a show of Alpha-dog force. They needed Jellico. So they put Jellico on the Enterprise, requiring the removal of Picard. Like most Starfleet Captains, Picard abhors sitting behind a desk, so he probably used his clout to get put on the special ops mission with his own hand-picked team."
DaystromInstitute,3dwhqw,drafterman,7,Mon Jul 20 12:08:59 2015 UTC,"That's a fantastic reason of why they sent Picard out on that specific mission.   You're absolutely right that Jellico was the perfect captain for that mission. Honestly? I really liked him.   However, we seem to have branched off my original question.

Why, during the Ben Maxwell incident when Picard didn't put the boots to them for covertly moving around military assets despite the very tenuous peace treaty.  Yours is perhaps the best in-universe reason I've heard regarding Picard's participation in the raid.

As a leader in Amnesty International, he wanted people to be made aware of torture in as real of a sense as he could portray.

Whether this is realistic or not is a complicated question. On the one hand any massive space empire the size of the federation being so sadly ignorant in military matters is laughable. On top of that they survived several wars and 70 years of cold war with the klingons, yet they have no special forces, no specialized war ships or infantry and honestly pathetic self defense tactics.  However the world they live in is the world they created. They are pacifistic to the point of suicide as is most of the federation. While there are several independently powerful races in the federation like the andorians and the vulcans, we have no idea as to the strength of the other species. It may even make more sense from their point of view to be pacifist if instead of a massive space empire they only inhabit a single planet, and are barely warp capable (the federation will still accept them as members)  So is it wildly unrealistic, or is their suicidal military ignorance a side effect of their dedication to peaceful cooperation? Did they dismantle their military because they sought peace? Were they defeated by their victory?"

Absolutely you're likely going to have a boring time if you're, say, simply doing patrols between Sol and Vulcan. But personally I prefer the notion that lots of ships are having all kinds of adventures big and small out there. We definitely do see crews in TOS and TNG who encounter whatever the Enterprise is about to (or just did) encounter, only they didn't figure out the solution to this weeks dilemma in time, often costing their lives. Our main characters probably encounter more though, that much I'd definitely agree with."

DaystromInstitute,3dubtc,Thrace_The_Third,4,Mon Jul 20 00:42:54 2015 UTC,"Apparently so. For the first half of the first season, he wore the rank of Lt Commander, but from the episode ""Cathexis"" (S1E13) he wore the rank of full Lt.   In the season 4 episode ""Revulsion"" Tuvok is promoted to Lt Commander.   So, though it's never explicitly stated on screen, and was possibly even a costuming error, Tuvok was apparently demoted some time during Voyager's first year in the Delta Quadrant.  It's most likely that the demotion occurred as a result of Tuvok's insubordinate and Prime Directive-violating actions in ""Prime Factors"" (S1E10), as that's the only on-screen instance of Tuvok getting severely reprimanded around the same time."

Cmdr for several episodes in the first season, but he was consistently referred to as ""lieutenant"" by Janeway and others. After he is ""properly"" promoted, he is referred to as ""commander,"" the proper shorthand for a person of that rank."
DaystromInstitute,3dubtc,williams_482,4,Wed Jul 22 02:59:16 2015 UTC,"Kim was never promoted because there was never any room for it. I think Janeway states this but I forget which episode it is in. She couldn't promote too many people and she couldn't promoted them much more than just a single rank. With no replacement officers, promotions on a normal timeline would mean that every ensign on the ship would be an O-3 or even an O-4 by the time they had gotten back to the Alpha quadrant. She also needed everyone exactly where they were positioned for the same reason. Given that, she probably could have made him a Lt. JG after the second or third year without too much impact on the crew dynamics.   Personally, I think it was just the writers liking how well the words ""Ensign Kim"" worked together."
DaystromInstitute,3dubtc,Chaff5,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:33:21 2015 UTC,"That's the stated reason, but it's an odd one given that Kim is already a member of the senior staff and for that reason probably has authority over all the Ensigns and even some Lieutenants assigned to shipboard operations. Promoting him to lieutenant jg would simply cement his position without overturning any existing rank structures.   Plus, Janeway was entirely willing to re-promote Tom Paris, whose original rank was given to him as a field commision."
DaystromInstitute,3dubtc,williams_482,18,Wed Jul 22 03:03:57 2015 UTC,Advancement is probably slower to because of less ranks. Star Fleet doesn't seem to have as much emphasis on rank. Unless you are shooting for command of a Starship then you need to be Captain.   After a few years of service you go from ensign to lieutenant junior grade then whatever happens will happen. Troi and Crushers position was pretty independent of their ranks.  Ensign Crusher was given command of a geological survey and Ensign Kim was the chief operations officer on Voyager.   It seems to be more of a mark of seniority than anything else. A young ensign fresh out of the academy who is more qualified for a certain position will get the job over a 20 year veteran commander.  The idea of ego doesn't seem to affect the attitudes of humanity anymore.
DaystromInstitute,3dubtc,RigasTelRuun,10,Sun Jul 19 18:05:51 2015 UTC,"Along with the idea of diminished weight of ego, I think command also has the opportunity to realize that younger officers might have knowledge of newer concepts or a better grasp of concepts than older officers. For instance, Ensign Kim had working knowledge of hologram matrix design, something most people on Voyager would be a bit too old to know anything about, considering  the pace at which holographic technology seems to accelerating in the late 24th century."
DaystromInstitute,3dubtc,metakepone,6,Sun Jul 19 18:43:57 2015 UTC,"I don't have any personal experience with the military, but my general impression (from having a military family) is that when it comes to career military, you're generally fairly likely to advance through the ranks steadily, and then just... stop. Because there are progressively fewer and fewer ""job openings"" for higher ranks."
DaystromInstitute,3dubtc,Sly_Lupin,7,Sun Jul 19 21:51:05 2015 UTC,"In the real military it's usually some form of 'up or out', if you don't or can't advance you'll be discharged or forced to resign or not allowed to reup for additional service after a set period. So if Starfleet worked that way, old Picard as a junior officer in Tapestry wouldn't really have been possible. It supposedly keeps the military young and hungry with a greater chance to find more of the best leaders, though if it actually works that way is a subject of much debate."
DaystromInstitute,3dubtc,boringdude00,4,Mon Jul 20 00:37:37 2015 UTC,"Depends on the branch. I was an 0351 in the Marine Corps, got out as a LCPL. To advance to NCO ranks (CPL & SGT), there is what is called a ""cutting score"". This is a set score you need to reach before you are allowed to move up, barring meritorious promotions. This score is the sum of your physical fitness test score, your rifle range score, the number of Marine Corps Institute books you complete(think single credit courses from college, all done at your own pace), as well as Time in Service and Time in Grade.  The score is different for each MOS. For example, computer repair techs had a score of only around 1100. While mine as an Infantry Assaultman, a MOS that was supposed to be getting phased out, was over 1600. This made it almost impossible to get Corporal in four years."
DaystromInstitute,3dubtc,DasJuden63,2,Mon Jul 20 03:10:35 2015 UTC,Troi is a civilian. It is only stated that she carries the equivalent rank of LtCmdr.

Unless you slow down progression for these species, all the admirals making policy would be filled with Vulcans - a politically untenable situation.   To answer your edit about before ensign: they would be cadets at the Academy. There are also some - shockingly few - enlisted personnel, who would have gone through the Starfleet equivalent of basic training before becoming the equivalent of seaman."
DaystromInstitute,3dubtc,donjuansputnik,4,Sun Jul 19 18:24:37 2015 UTC,"In DS9 they alluded to the fact that most of the engineers were non-coms. And the fact that there was no dedicated engineering crew on the Defiant(s) makes me think that station based engineers were mostly non-coms, and the starship ones were commissioned. The fact that LeForge had the Enterprise going from an ensign flying the thing to suddenly being the Chief Engineer (who spent a lot of time on the bridge) makes for a very fluid rank system."

DaystromInstitute,3dubtc,vladthor,6,Sun Jul 19 21:30:34 2015 UTC,"The way that some navies (such as my own) work is that lower officer ranks are for initial training, and Lieutenant is the ""operational"" rank. That is, most directors are Lts and trainees are below them. LCdr rank requires selection for command training as only those seen as capable of holding a command will be put into senior positions (OpsO, XO).   In Starfleet, we see larger vessels where heads of departments on a galaxy class vessel are generally LCdr rank or higher. Functionally this makes sense as we have seen the Captain be required to carry out diplomatic or scientific missions in which it would be advantageous to have additional command qualified officers, whereas smaller vessels could have a Cdr or even LCdr billet for CO."
DaystromInstitute,3dubtc,mmss,4,Sun Jul 19 20:49:16 2015 UTC,If you are Nog it only takes about 6 months in the academy and another 6 months service to make Lieutenant so I guess it all depends who you know and if you can get a job on the flagship.

DaystromInstitute,3dubtc,Algernon_Asimov,3,Sun Jul 19 21:49:13 2015 UTC,"I think that in general, people would advance to about Lt. Commander fairly quickly, and then plateau maybe in 10-15 years of mundane service.    The officers on the show progress more slowly because they're refusing transfers off of the story ships, where there are only so many seats to fill.   So, because they won't accept a new posting, they're stuck at the same rank, though I imagine, they gain a lot of prestige being on famous postings.  It was mentioned that Riker refused his own command several times so he could stay on the Enterprise."
DaystromInstitute,3duzqr,nmhunate,15,Sun Jul 19 19:04:40 2015 UTC,"In universe - No  Theory - Starfleet was trying new uniforms and the Enterprise was a Pilot ship for them.  Picard/Riker thought it thought it would be a good idea to have both used at the same time to judge what was better.  Real World: Generations was rushed and had a fairly low budget.  They wanted new uniforms but they were cut or decided against.  Only a few cast got actual DS9/VOY uniforms and even then they had to borrow uniforms from other shows.  From Memory Alpha:   Reportedly, time was so short that actors Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner and LeVar Burton had to ""borrow"" uniforms made for DS9 stars Avery Brooks and Colm Meaney and VOY stars Robert Duncan McNeill and Garrett Wang, respectively. Generations was the only example of the two uniforms being worn alongside one another by any crew."
DaystromInstitute,3duzqr,mistakenotmy,11,Sun Jul 19 19:16:55 2015 UTC,Their budget would've been a tad better if they'd ditched that scene on the Holodeck.

I'll bet it wasn't too expensive anyway. The ship is called Lady Washington and it is operated by a non profit. I'll bet it was cheaper than many other public locations. And the costumes were probably standard rentals.
DaystromInstitute,3duzqr,quackdamnyou,6,Sun Jul 19 21:23:00 2015 UTC,"respectively   That word ... I do not think it means what Memory Alpha thinks it means.

DaystromInstitute,3duzqr,CitizenjaQ,6,Mon Jul 20 18:00:06 2015 UTC,Why couldn't they just use the TNG uniforms they had from the TV show? Those four actors wore their TNG uniforms for part of the movie anyway.
DaystromInstitute,3duzqr,williams_482,5,Sun Jul 19 19:53:45 2015 UTC,"No idea.  Production wanted it different and so thats what they did?  Pure Speculation: A movie is a chance to revamp things. It sounds like they wanted new uniforms but they were cut last minute.  The decision to move to something different was already made so they wanted to stick with the ""something different"" idea at least.  Using the old uniforms would be giving up on that?    Something made it so they had to use the old uniforms part of the time.  No idea what."
DaystromInstitute,3duzqr,mistakenotmy,4,Sun Jul 19 20:05:18 2015 UTC,But they had the budget to make everyone a 18th century naval uniform for the opening scene? Odd priorities on that set.
DaystromInstitute,3duzqr,thearn4,14,Mon Jul 20 02:20:24 2015 UTC,"I'm in the US Army, and in my time we have transitioned from the BDUs (classic woodland camo) to the ACU (that ugly greyish digital camo), and now we're transitioning from the ACU to the OCP uniform (a more realistic camo).  Anyway, the point is that during each of these transitions, the wear of both uniforms was/is permitted among the ranks. We had a ""wear out date"" after which the old uniform would no longer be authorized to wear. But during the transition, there was no point in destroying perfectly wearable uniforms.  I imagine it would be the same for Trek. During the shift from one to the other, regulations made it possible for the person to choose which one they wanted to wear that day."

But that doesn't really hold up from an in-universe perspective. Around the time of Generations, we have two starships, the Voyager and the Equinox, who wear only the DS9 style, while on the show Deep Space Nine officers in starships and star bases pretty much exclusively wear the TNG style.   Consider that during the course of TNG we see most of the senior staff switch from collarless uniforms to a collared style, while background characters keep wearing the collarless version. Some junior officers, however, like Lt. Barclay, also wear the collared uniform. The conclusion I arrived at when making my Starfleet uniform timeline, if you'll forgive the self-promotion, is that the DS9 style (which I refer to as the Voyager style to avoid confusion) is basically a variant of the TNG uniform, akin to the uniforms with or without a collar. It appears officers around the time of The Motion Picture had a very diverse array of uniforms to wear, and this was in someways a throwback to that era. Starfleet is an organization that prides itself on its diversity, and the uniforms reflected that, at least until threats like the Dominion inspired the more somber and uniform outfits worn in the TNG films."

The real-world explanation being, of course, that when they switched to the new style, they only had the time/budget to make uniforms for the main cast.  In-universe, the idea is that officers (IE the main cast) got preference, so they got new uniforms fairly quickly, while all the grunts (read: extras) had to wait."

Several years ago, the US Air Force began transitioning from BDU's (brown and green camo utility uniforms) to a more service-specific ABU (grey and green tigerstripes.) For several years, it was very common to see both uniforms worn at the same time by different unit members. In fact, for a while you'd see a mix of uniforms - BDU field jackets with ABU uniforms.  In universe, the DS9-style uniform was always considered a bit less formal than the TNG style ones. Think of it as a flight suit versus a set of blues.

There was also the episode ""Prophet Motive"" where he was nominated for the Carrington Award, and was unhappy about it.  While it can be said that all of these things could have happened without him being genetically enhanced with no conflict, in my opinion it would weaken those elements of foreshadowing if your theory were true.  So I don't think theory 2 is correct.  As for theory 1, aside from the fact that if he was really his own grandfather, they probably would have wanted to show that to us, and not just had it happen off-screen, there are no real problems with it.

O’Brien stepped closer to his dart throwing partner, closing the distance he had insisted upon to prevent genetically enhanced advantages skewing the game.  “PLEASE tell me you’re joking.” O’Brien replied.  “I’ve never been more serious in my life Miles.” Julian continued.  “I had…intercourse…with Lieutenant Watley shortly after you and I met her.  Thereby guaranteeing my own existence.”  “Have you totally lost your mind?!” O’Brien yelled. “You SLEPT with a woman from the twenty-third century?”  “Not just any woman.” Bashir continued, lowering his voice.  “My own great-grandmother.  The woman I was always destined to reproduce with.”  “Of all the…idiotic…irresponsible…and frankly…bizarre things I’ve even heard of…that takes the bloody cake!”  Bashir ignored his friend’s rant and continued as if giving a first year academy cadet a lecture.  “Miles I would think that you of all people would understand this.  The necessity of preserving the timeline.  Imagine if I HADN’T acted…I could have destroyed the very FABRIC of the time-space continuum itself.”  “Wonderful,” O’Brien mused. “Genetically enhanced, delusions of grandeur, AND a pervert!”  “Good lord Chief, this is the twenty-fourth century, there’s nothing perverted about it!” Bashir retorted, “Did you sleep through temporal mechanics class, man?  If I hadn’t taken that action, the person you are talking to right now would never have even existed!  I would have never been born with the very genetic deficiencies that necessitated the corrective actions taken by my parents.

Julian raised his hands in front of the Chief, touching fingers to his thumbs to form a circular shape.  “A pre-destination paradox, don’t you see?” He explained to an open-mouthed O’Brien with an incredulous stare. “My existence ensured through a closed loop of continuity.”  O’Brien frowned, leaning forward and focusing his thoughts through a synthehol-induced haze.  “You’re telling me that you were always destined to go back in time, DESTINED to have sex with...your own grannie…”  “Great-Grannie!  Lieutanant Watley!  You saw her Miles!  Beautiful…uncontrollably attracted to me by the dictates of fate!”  Miles scowled and continued. “GREAT-Grannie then!  As if that’s somehow better.  And you think you then somehow…gave yourself the genetic problems from your birth.  And that is what resulted in your genetic enhancement.”  “And that is what resulted in my having the very intellectual capacity to deduce the paradox of my own existence…and ensure it occurred as it was always meant to.  Yes.”  Bashir sat back with a satisfied smile.  “I knew you could understand it Chief.”  “Understand it?” Miles sat forward intently, “I don’t think you even understand what it is you’ve done here.”  “I understand it perfectly, Chief.” Julian responded smugly. “I’ve confirmed it thorough genetic scans of myself, and my entire family line.”  “Alright then, let me ask you this, ‘mr. genetically enhanced intellect.’” O’Brien said.  “How do you know you didn’t create a completely new timeline?  Or even a timeline that closely resembles the original, but now has the added changes that resulted from your tampering with history?”  Bashir thought for a moment then shook his head dismissively.  “Sorry, Occam’s Razor applies here Chief.  My explanation best fits our current understanding of temporal mechanics.  I was always meant to go back and help create myself.”  “Oh really?” O’Brien narrowed his eyes, “So did Gabriel Bell always look like Benjamin Sisko then?”  “Of course not…” Julian replied, “But that’s totally different.”  “No Julian.  It perfectly illustrates that there was an initial timeline where there was an actual Gabriel Bell.  His role was only assumed by Captain Sisko AFTER our time travel interference.”  “How does that apply?” (continued)"
DaystromInstitute,3dsmrt,CaptainJaneway_,5,Sun Jul 19 23:17:31 2015 UTC,"“I believe that in the original timeline, you were a normal, non-enhanced Starfleet medical officer.” O’Brien continued, “That you never had these genetic enhancements and were barely close to being as good at darts as I am.  Then you changed your own history and now you have genetic enhancements.”  Bashir shook his head, refusing to accept the theory.  “You’re just have trouble accepting that I’ve so successfully hidden and repressed these abilities my entire life.  That I have been so good at pretending to be normal, you’ve never even suspected the truth.”  “Do you know how ridiculous that sounds?” O’Brien continued, accepting another pint with a sideways glance at the Ferengi waiter.  “You and I have been in life and death situations for years now.  Situations that you would have gotten us out of far more efficiently if you had super-human abilities the entire time.”  Bashir sat silently, absorbing his friend’s words.  “You’ve only become genetically enhanced because of your tampering with history.  If you hadn’t done anything with…with Watley on the Enterprise…then this strange part of your personal history would never have been created.”  “But I remember each situation we’ve been in…”Julian whispered uncertainly, “I REMEMBER repressing my abilities in each life and death struggle.  Repressing them just enough to avoid anyone realizing the truth…but secretly finding solutions that only a genetically enhanced intellect could recognize.”  “Julian, because of what you’ve done, you’re now the least reliable narrator in your own life history.” O’Brien concluded.  “You can’t trust those memories now.”  “My god, you’re right…” Julian stood and faced the dart board. “There’s simply no way to tell which of our theories might be the correct one…”  “I have a way to tell.” O’Brien stood from the table and walked behind his friend. “I’m right, because you weren’t genetically enhanced when we were on the Enterprise.”  Julian watched O’Brien intently.  “Someone as smart as you seem to think you are now, would have been intelligent enough to keep his zipper closed when he met his own great-grandmother!  It’s something only an idiotic, narcissistic, neurotic, lunatic would do.  And that’s exactly how I remember you always having been.”  “At least until I returned from the twenty-third century…” Bashir whispered, taking on a conspiratorial tone. “Think Chief! Have you noticed a difference in me since the Enterprise?”  “What do you mean?”  “Have I been….smarter…or have I seemed like I’ve been possibly hiding something…something like being smarter these past months?”  “How the bloody hell would I know?” O’Brien exclaimed.  “You’re right…” Julian began to pace in front of the unused dart board. “You’re too close to me.  Your memories could have been altered along with mine in this timeline.”  O’Brien closed his eyes in annoyance and frustration.  “We need third parties to get to the bottom of this.” Julian announced. “I should contact Temporal Investigations.”  “And tell them what exactly?  That you created yourself through time travel?  Or that you changed your original self through time travel?”  “I don’t know…” Julian mused. “I suppose I’ll just tell them what I did.  Give them both theories…let them find the truth of it.”  “You’ve just barely kept your career intact after your Father accepted responsibility for your genetic modification.  Do you really think—“   “Your right!” Julian interrupted.  “If I tell them what I did, then I would be admitting to intentionally GIVING myself the very genetic problems that led to my father’s actions.  Therefore I could be considered the one legally responsible for—“  “That’s not what I was talking about.” O’Brien interjected.  “You mean morally then…” Julian continued.  “I’ve allowed my parents to suffer for years with guilt from the knowledge that somehow they produced a genetically inferior child, when it was really me that CHOSE to give myself those problems—“  “That’s not what I meant either!” O’Brien shouted, picking up a dart and throwing it at the board violently.  The impact and corresponding light show shocked Bashir out of his racing thoughts.  “What I meant was that you’re already controversial enough.  The last thing you need is to tell anyone from the Department of Temporal Investigations about this.”  Julian faced his friend grimly.  “Do you think they might already know, Miles?”  O’Brien scoffed, handing Bashir his pint. “Julian.  I’m sure they have assigned at least four agents, all dedicated to tracking your sexual exploits.”  Julian’s eyes widened.  “You really think so…” he whispered.  O’Brien rolled his eyes and set down his empty pint glass.  “What I think is that we need to go back to my quarters right now, open a bottle of single malt scotch, and drink until we forget this ever happened.  Because if word of this gets out, it’ll become the biggest joke of the entire Quadrant.”  Julian exhaled, slumped his shoulders, and smiled slightly. “Maybe that is the best solution.”  “Yes, it is.” O’Brien announced, placing his hand on his friend’s shoulder and guiding him away from the dart board.  “And it’s exactly how I got through temporal mechanics at the Academy.”"

Just add in a dose of time travel."
DaystromInstitute,3dsmrt,Vusys,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:39:59 2015 UTC,"The first theory is pretty great and plausible. For me, the second one just doesn't sound plausible, because I cannot imagine how it would be possible to not have a causality loop when time travel is involved."
DaystromInstitute,3dsmrt,dodriohedron,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:48:49 2015 UTC,"Causality is already a loopy, two-way metaphysical simultaneity relationship in the first place. The cause causes the result, and the result is caused by the cause. Actively vs. passively voiced, the same space-time thing-happening proposition has the precise dual aspect of self-causation, in every case. Even when time travel is not involved.  What makes the grandfather-paradox confusing and then eventually enlightening is seeing how the temporal distance between cause and effect, and the idea of bending/distorting the arrow of time, could be interpreted differently if one (as the observer and/or participant) is in a time-travel-is-legal scenario. We 21st century plebs do not have compelling evidence of backwards causation - but that doesn't preclude such phenomenon, if certain rules are violated. The problem is that it becomes a fuzzy logic mess, rather than a paradox problem, if rational agents can alter timelines to their whim. Combinatorial explosion of multiverses seems to be time travel's dirty little secret."

Past-shir being Bashir's great-grandfather wouldn't lead to an increased chance of recessive genes being expressed. AFAIK genes don't work like that, I don't think being his own great-grandfather would affect his genetic health, even if we were ignoring the rules of retro-progeny: In cases of retroprogeny, the only stable time loop is one in which all of the genes you pass on to your offspring just happen to be, due to random chance, the exact set of genes it always seemed you'd received from the parent you're replacing. Any paradox where the genes you pass on aren't the exact set you were supposed to have inherited from your like-gendered ancestor destabilizes, and never existed. This doesn't spoil your Theory 1, that he really is his own great-grandfather, but it does invalidate his ordinaryness as evidence, since you'd expect to see the same result whether he was his own ancestor or not."

This implies he is also possibly a pawn in the Temporal Cold War, a significant asset for the Federation and/or one of its allies.  Now, what specifically did his GMO enhancement allow him to accomplish, or let him be in a certain place, that he otherwise could not have done or gotten into, had he merely been the competent above-average, non-GMO Starfleet officer he has pretended to be all this time?  The first thing that comes to mind is his interaction with the socially awkward think tank of geniuses. He may not have done anything significant directly, but he may have set these people on a new course that would prove decisive later on."

DaystromInstitute,3dxzd3,breenisgreen,3,Mon Jul 20 13:52:52 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer - I am a huge fan of both  This is interesting, I think we'd see a much more interesting, and much darker universe come from the Firefly / Serenity / Wheadonverse blending with the Rodenberryverse.  Lets take a look at the physical construct of the two universes and how this plays out with them blending together and lets assume that everything happens just after Zerphram Cochrane takes his first warp flight.   In my mind, this is a good entry point. Earth is disheveled after World War 3, there's likely some factions still lingering from the conflict and most importantly, currency still likely exists. (Important for this next bit).  The vulcans land and begin fostering / mentoring Cochrane just as they did before. However, instead of humanity uniting, there's a noticeable split, driven by the lingering hate from the war.  They and the underlying factions look at Cochrane and see power. Power that they don't have. They both fear and loathe the vulcans, who judge based purely on logic rather than compassion.  In the years that pass, those that did not stand with Cochrane established their own communities, their own cities, and after a series of thefts from Cochranes engineering efforts, they start to work on their own space travel mechanisms.   Soon after they succeed in building their own spacecraft, the Cochrane side forms it's own Alliance to unify their resources, and research, as well as defend against the factions and those that aligned with them.   Since all of humanity isn't united at this point, the alliance decides that Earth doesn't need to be their only home. That they can move to places where they are free of the factions, and thanks to the Vulcans, create trade outposts with alien races. The Vulcans then teach them to terraform as well as find places suitable to live without the need to rebuild the world.   The alliance branches out, and expands smaller outposts rapidly thanks to the trade routes. Technology advances at a faster pace as a means of defense against the factions, who by this point have become more comfortable with space travel as they steal more technology.   But, this is where it begins to turn. In the trek universe, this a very different thing. The soon to become, federation, are the good guys. Whereas in this one, they're the bad guys.   In the Wheadon trek verse, currency still exists! These factions are trading. Raiding the alliance / Cochrane side for technology and trading it between them. Not unlike the crew of the Serenity. But because currency still exists, everything is built to a cost. Gone is the spit and polish we see on the Enterprise because 'cost' is now a factor. Even the alliance would struggle here, being forced to keep currency would slow their technological advancements, but they would still remain more advanced than the factions.   They would be burned by this. They would be so desperate on making the alliance the utopia they believe it should be that they would cast aside the Vulcans who were desperately trying to get the alliance to take a peaceful approach, and adopt a more ruthless one instead.   They try to fight the factions, who continue to raid them, and their outposts.  We could argue at this point that they developed neurotoxins and ended up creating the reavers, but I think it would be much more interesting if they discovered the Nausicans and tried to manipulate them instead. The Nausican pirates already exist. The Alliance could conceivably coerce them into doing their bidding for them. Just like the operatives.   That being said, I like the concept of the reavers. I could easily see this new desperate alliance decide to 'experiment' with the reavers, sending many on a blood torn rampage so violent they try to bury the fact it happened by shunning them to an abandoned colony.   In the trek universe, the war never breaks out because it never ended. The factions were battling them from day one with the raids.   So there's the start of the universe. Slower technical advancement, with the war from the beginning.   The trek verse would be darker. Avoiding raids, exploring new worlds and picking sides. I think we would see something darker, but ultimately something wonderful.   I really think I could write a book on this...."
DaystromInstitute,3dxzd3,ullrsdream,2,Mon Jul 20 14:44:46 2015 UTC,"Reavers could be an experiment with technology from the eugenics wars. They created the super soldier during the wars, but they had to be ""civilized"". The new alliance takes the super soldier genome and snips out the civility and the polished looks - they create living weapons that destroy everyone in their path but destroy little else that can't be easily replaced.   This is sounding somewhat Imperial Empire like."

DaystromInstitute,3dxzd3,BigTaker,3,Mon Jul 20 15:11:21 2015 UTC,"Somewhere in Firefly's extra, there's an interview where Whedon describes the elevator pitch for Firefly as being ""the people the Enterprise just sailed on past,"" which I always thought was a nice concise description- but also suggests there are maybe some limits to just how much of the framework could have been successfully cribbed.  Tonally, though, Firefly (and BSG) represent a new normal that a revived Trek would need to contend with, just as those shows contended with TNG. A few promising threads come to mind:  -Firefly is funny. Star Trek is occasionally funny, frequently because some buttoned up authority figure has to deal with one of those wacky foreign aliens/robots/cyborgs that doesn't get how we do things here, and most of the captains might be described as wry, but everyone is generally too damn busy being their Starfleet Academy valedictorian to just be a weirdo like Captain Reynolds, and there's no reason that needs to be the case. An authority figure can still be a funny person, and the contrast between their soft touch and their flinty bits is a drama factory.  -Firefly was lived in. Enterprise and DS9 both get points for constructing spaces that are a little more evocative of ships, planes, and alien handiwork than their three compatriots, but for whatever reason Trek never really learned the Star Wars lesson- the dirt is what sells the shine, and Firefly learned that lesson in spades. When Kaylie has Christmas lights in the engine room, there's no doubt that this is a real place. When everyone on the Enterprise apparently sleeps on the same shiny sheets and triangle pillows, it adds to the disconcerting sense that this utopia is filled with sanded-down people.   -Firefly had no babble. Granted, Firefly also had no aliens, and no time travel, and I'm not about to carve those out of Trek (what's left, exactly?) but it's still perhaps a useful data point to consider that Firefly's broad success in telling pretty standard Trekkish stories- outwitting the bad guys with techie tools, dealing with telepathy and brain hacking and the perils of space travel- happened without the Latin suffix soup that makes Trek plot-driving dialogue such garbage.   -Firefly showed people on the back foot. DS9 and Enterprise, with their respective war arcs, did have our heroes scratching their heads trying to figure out how much of their moral code they can auction to get through the day, but it's a rare thing for the Federation to be the little guy. Sure, the Borg rumble through once in a while, and it's a good existential panic, but then they rumble right out again. The Dominion starts out bigger and smarter, but that's not a circumstance anyone has to live with for very long. What happens when the Federation turns out to be on the edge of a super-Federation, with twice the utopia-juice, and suddenly our heroes are from the poor part of town?"
DaystromInstitute,3dxzd3,Neo_Techni,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:56:17 2015 UTC,"I think the lack of technobabble was one of my favorite parts. The most detail they went into was ""this part in the engine is broken and we need to fix it."" Logically they must have faster-than-light travel, but they don't fetishize it (or paint themselves into corners about how the magic actually works). The latter is impossible for Star Trek, and especially for a show where the whole premise is that we've got a new engine with this precise magic level... but still. It was nice."
DaystromInstitute,3dxzd3,queenofmoons,2,Tue Jul 21 18:13:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you didn't even need to go beyond Alpha Centauri and you'd have 2 seasons worth of stories easily. Going straight to the Klingon homeworld was an act of desperation in many ways.   Regarding the ""lack of missions"", you're very much bang on. You got the distinct impression that the Enterprise, Mankind's first deep-space warp vessel, could've travelled anywhere without concern for fuel, actual distance (one episode described 30 light-years as being a minor detour, if I recall correctly), supplies, and so on. The reality of pre-Federation space travel just wasn't there."

If the star has a sphere surrounding it then it will become a combined gravitational mass (the mass of the star + the very significant mass of the sphere) with a greater pull on any objects in the solar system.   As for your second question, a Dyson sphere suddenly showing up in a star system would throw everything into chaos since you'd now have a binary system. Many inner planets would be hurled towards the edge of the system, expelled into interstellar space or collide with the sphere or each other, and even outer planets would have their orbits altered significantly."
DaystromInstitute,3dtxc1,Lord_Hoot,3,Sun Jul 19 16:46:05 2015 UTC,It's not impossible that a culture advanced enough to construct a Sphere would also have the means to mask it's gravity so it has minimal effect on nearby bodies.

DaystromInstitute,3dtxc1,Hyndis,7,Mon Jul 20 01:36:07 2015 UTC,"First off, the sector space map in STO isn't to scale. Starships aren't actually the size of planets. Planets are far further apart and smaller than stars than what appears on the map. The size of small objects is greatly exaggerated so that they're visible. What good would a map be if everything was to perfect scale? You couldn't find anything.  It is entirely possible that the Iconian sphere is now in a binary orbit around the star. In other words, its now a binary star system. Stars may orbit each other at great distances, far enough away that planets can exist in orbit around one star even though that star itself orbits another one. The stars orbit each other with an orbital focus somewhere in the middle.  The long term effects of this Iconian sphere in a binary orbit around this star may still be catastrophic for the planets in orbit. Even at a distance of hundreds of AU's a star still has a lot of gravity. Not enough to outright yank planets from orbit, but enough gravity to disturb their orbits.  Hopefully these are just dead, lifeless planets we're talking about. Odds are that soon (within decades or centuries) very bad things will happen to these planets. Their orbits will shift. Some planets might be yanked out of orbit and flung away as exoplanets. Some planets might spiral into their parent star and burn up. Some planets may even collide or get close enough that they're ripped apart into a ring system of planetary debris.  Even if these planes were inhabited bad things wouldn't happen immediately. In an age where interstellar travel is cheap and commonplace there would be ample time to evacuate the planets. This is a slow motion disaster that takes place over years. These people would all be refugees. A new place to settle would have to be found and all of that infrastructure built up would be lost as the planet is destroyed outright or rendered uninhabitable, but this isn't like the destruction of a planet with a red matter singularity. There's years to evacuate.  Or at least, thats assuming the Iconians don't just sterilize the planets from orbit. Iconians aren't known for being gentle. Not much is known about them other than through myth and legend, but they were known to be tyrants."
DaystromInstitute,3dtxc1,shihchiun,3,Sun Jul 19 17:23:32 2015 UTC,"Part A: yes. If the sphere is orbiting a star (not surrounding) it should throw off all the orbits of everything else in the solar system.   Part B: they would collide. If their orbits just intersected, they may collide but most likely one or both would get thrown into a new orbit."
DaystromInstitute,3dtxc1,ebolaRETURNS,2,Sun Jul 19 14:13:15 2015 UTC,"and it has confused me how having a dyson sphere that close to a star system hasn't affected the orbit of the planets at all.   If the sphere itself isn't very massive (and it really shouldn't be--a star's plasma at decent depths is orders of magnitude denser than any terrestrial matter), its addition to the gravity exerted on the plants should be very small.  This should affect the planets' orbit very modestly (though multibody motion is a chaotic system, so small perturbations might cause large changes).   As a slight deviation from this question, what would happen if one of the planets around the star was on a path blocked by the sphere?   They would run into it."

Bio-luminescence has evolved at least forty times here on Earth, with the majority of those instance being amongst phylla that don't have eyes at all, like many jellyfish, who live deep enough that orientation functions with light from the surface aren't a concern. Most luminescent vertebrates are actually playing host to colonies of symbiotic glowing bacteria they acquire as part of their diet, and don't glow themselves. The proteins most frequently involved in releasing light are closely related to those involved in other biological functions. It's entirely possible that you just end up with luminescence by accident, and then light is just another football to be used for communication with friends, and detection by foes, just as life that almost certainly appeared out of chemistry in dark places, made use of the the sunlight that was ""accidentally"" present in the rest of the world.   And, of course, the absence of sunlight need not be the absence of light. The geothermal vents of such importance to organisms on a rogue planet are hot enough to produce short-end infrared that can be detected by eyes.

I suspect ordnance packages on the Bridge and other key locations (main computers as an example) also always go off.  History has shown that ships that are destroyed/scuttled can still lead to intelligence windfalls for an enemy.  Independently blowing the Bridge and other places is just smart.  From the TNG Tech Manual (non-canon):   In the preferred configuration, the starship undergoes rapid vaporization from thermal and mechanical shock caused by a deliberate release of warp engine reactants. Remote computer system decryption algorithms generate one final set of cascade failure commands, and all engine safety interlocks are compromised. Matter from the primary deuterium tankage and the total supply of antimatter from the storage pods on Deck42 are expelled simultaneously, producing an energy release on the order of 1015 megajoules, roughly equivalent to 1,000 photon torpedoes.  If the command links to the engine systems are severed, the secondary destruct system is automatically selected. Ordnance packages are located at key locations around the vehicle, including the antimatter storage pods. These are detonated in concert with intentional overloads of all fusion reaction chambers. The release yield of the secondary system is calculated to be 109 megajoules , roughly equivalent to 500 photon torpedoes. The secondary destruct system becomes the primary system for the Saucer Module in Separated Flight Mode."
DaystromInstitute,3drsqp,mistakenotmy,8,Sat Jul 18 21:24:34 2015 UTC,How is it that 109 megajoules is only half the photo torpedo equivalent of 1015 megajoules?
DaystromInstitute,3drsqp,wayoverpaid,5,Sat Jul 18 23:04:52 2015 UTC,"I don't know how much I would look at some of the actual energy numbers in the TM.  They do not always line up, this is one of those.  I would look more to the process and idea.  Obviously half of 1015 is closer to 107 or 108 (see response below, I messed this part up).  Even then the megajoules given and conversions to photon torpedoes is way off (if we take the warhead size given earlier in the TM as more factual).  For comparison a 1.5kg antimatter charge = a 3kg m/am annihilation = 64 megaton tnt equivalent.  So 1 Photon = 64 MT    The Secondary System:   The fusion reactors and munitions is stated as 109 megajoules.  That 109 megajouls = a 239 Kiloton explosion. (see this converter)  However, a 239 KT blast is not anywhere close to even 1 Photon torpedo, let alone 500.   The Primary System:    1015 megajoules = 239 Gigaton explosion  And 1000 photon torpedoes = 64MT x 1000 = 64,000 MT  The 239,000 MT of the primary system is actually way more than the 1000 photon torpedo equivalent given.

We've seen ships maneuver at warp several times, going right back to Encounter at Farpoint with the separation of the saucer section at warp, necessitating it to maneuver away from the drive section  before dropping out of warp. And probably the most obvious example of it is when Trip transferred from the Columbia to the Enterprise by grappling hook while both ships were at warp.  Now, traveling at several hundred times the speed of light would require you to be very careful about how you maneuver. A half degree adjustment in direction of travel could leave you dozens of light years off course, and could be fatally dangerous if there happens to be something in the way of where you end up going. So pilots are probably taught that if it's at all possible to do your maneuvering while at sublight speeds that it is preferred."

DaystromInstitute,3ds4d7,Flynn58,7,Sun Jul 19 00:18:15 2015 UTC,"What is Star Trek though? It's a franchise with almost 50 years of history. It's had a lot of incarnations, and some of those kicked up some controversy. Is Star Trek the stand-alone, generally optimistic thought experiment episodes of the 60s or the dark and gritty, winding galactic politics of DS9? Is it Picard proving the devil is a fake in court or is it animated Kirk drinking mead with the actual devil after court? Are the technical manuals less Star Trek than the Voyager comics? In a setting about exploring the unknown, why should we just stick with what we're used to because that's how it is?"
DaystromInstitute,3ds4d7,Berggeist,8,Sun Jul 19 01:06:04 2015 UTC,"why should we just stick with what we're used to because that's how it is?   Because that's what makes a franchise. At it's core, all the incarnations you've mentioned shared a common theme of discovery on the frontier and the human condition.  I don't believe the concept OP provided fits that. I don't think in-depth exposition on ground already covered is what Star Trek is about; Star Trek is about going where no one has gone before, and OP's concept is rooted firmly in Star Trek's past.  Star Trek isn't about sating the fandom's fantasies; It should first and foremost be good television accessible to everyone. If it hadn't been, all the people inspired by The Original Series and The Next Generation to pave new roads in Math and Science never would have, because the continuity lock-out would have turned them off.  That's why Star Trek kept shifting to a new setting, in order to find new realms to explore. The Next Generation shifted to another century, where the entire Alpha Quadrant was completely different. DS9 shifted to a space station and the discoveries that could be found at home. Voyager contrasted that with a ship on the run that kept finding truly alien discoveries as for seven years, it never had a place to call home except for each other.  Enterprise pulled the Temporal Cold War to find new territory because a straight prequel would have been boring, and while the fourth season is considered the best, it also killed the franchise for five years by pandering solely to the core Trekkie audience with fanservice instead of making a show everyone could enjoy.  I can't find what made Star Trek successful in OP's concept. I find a hyperfocus on it's own history, the exact thing that made Star Trek fail."
DaystromInstitute,3ds4d7,Flynn58,3,Sun Jul 19 01:18:06 2015 UTC,"So you don't see how exploring a different corner of galactic life could work for examining the human condition?

The life of a Ferengi from birth to death, complete with his mummified remains being sold off, could not only be hilarious but a great examination of humans and material gain.  I'm not talking about playing it as a completely straight, deadpan version of ""How It's Made"" with a Star Trek setting."
DaystromInstitute,3ds4d7,Berggeist,3,Sun Jul 19 01:35:09 2015 UTC,But that's the same problem I just stated. It's focusing in on the same thing we've seen before in more detail instead of showing us something new.

DaystromInstitute,3ds4d7,Flynn58,3,Sun Jul 19 01:44:44 2015 UTC,"Given it's a mockumentary speaking to an uninformed audience, that's really not such an issue. It wouldn't ask you to know all of this beforehand. That's part of what makes it a mockumentary - it explains all these weird things and lets the actors in outfits provide the humour and drama. How hard is it to tell an audience ""hey, these guys are HUGE into money, let's check out just HOW HUGE""?"
DaystromInstitute,3ds4d7,Berggeist,3,Sun Jul 19 01:50:18 2015 UTC,Why would the uninformed audience watch if the only people who would ever be asking for this show in the first place are existing fans who already know who these characters are?
DaystromInstitute,3ds4d7,Flynn58,3,Sun Jul 19 01:52:08 2015 UTC,"Who said we'd examine any characters we knew? How wouldn't a casual fan lured in by the Abramsverse not appreciate a fun look at lore? If the writing was good enough people would watch it because each week would be something new and different, and older fans would get new content as well.  Let me put it another way. Mockumentaries love to exaggerate peoples character traits. The alien races in Star Trek are almost entirely exaggerated character traits."
DaystromInstitute,3ds4d7,Berggeist,5,Sun Jul 19 01:57:17 2015 UTC,"I'm split. I enjoy documentaries and mockumentaries, so done right I could see myself enjoying this. I think the problem lies in just how exactly it'd be executed. If you handle the material too dryly it's going to turn off all but the most dedicated fans. But there's a lot of modern ""documentaries"" which take a certain ""infotainment"" tone, complete with drama manufactured for the camera and time distorting editing techniques. Certainly the more a show does that the trashier it gets, but to be perfectly blunt it also hooks in viewers.  This is because emotional hooks are powerful stuff for engaging the audience, and it isn't just trashy tv that uses them. March of the Penguins is a supremely easy example of this. Even Carl Sagan's Cosmos uses them carefully and tastefully.  Trill selection could work as a mockumentary - following the journeys of two or three individuals hoping to receive a symbiont. Not only would you get the lore, but you'd also have legitimate opportunities for emotional involvement of the audience. Topics like the Federation economy could also work, so long as the writing is clever and the episode is fun. By far the biggest risk the show could come up against would be to take itself too seriously. I mean, that Trill episode would still end up with someone getting a giant worm in their belly.  I think it'd work best as a short series on streaming services."
DaystromInstitute,3ds4d7,Berggeist,4,Sun Jul 19 00:06:49 2015 UTC,"The Trill selection would be more like a reality TV show like The Bachelorette.

In the same sense, Captain Kirk going and helping to create a peace treaty with the Klingons had a historical parallel with Nixon going to China. Kirk obviously after saving the earth multiple times had become a very popular figure in Starfleet, and the citizens that make up the Federation. Even though he was staunchly against Klingons he was the one chosen to attempt to make peace.

I think the notion of what constitutes a taboo would shift towards knowingly causing unwanted feelings or violations of universal rights.

DaystromInstitute,3dqdbw,YsoL8,7,Sat Jul 18 12:49:00 2015 UTC,"I only have an answer for the first question, so here it is. Obviously not all power is gone, as the antimatter pods still have the containment field active. The only reason I can think of a warp core breach is if the containment field were to stop. This is the exact problem in the episode; the people on the bridge must stop a containment field failure and alert engineering."
DaystromInstitute,3dqdbw,azuriteking,5,Sat Jul 18 13:03:39 2015 UTC,If you recall at the beginning of the episode Picard says they are in between missions and therefore the crew is looking forward to some downtime. We can then assume that there was a very small (1-2?) staff on duty and they were perhaps working on maintenance in an area that was cut off from Engineering or they were injured and unable to make it back to Engineering.
DaystromInstitute,3dqdbw,crashdown711,3,Sat Jul 18 15:25:22 2015 UTC,"Data and Riker get down there and there is absolutely no one in the engine room. So what, the engineering team decided the middle of an emergency was a good time to slack off?   The best rationale I can think of to this is remember that both the isolation door was down when Riker and Data arrived in Engineering and there was no power.  If the majority of personnel were stuck behind the isolation door when it shut down and they were unable to get anything else to work because of lack of power, the engineering crew may have considered evacuation from the isolated area of Engineering to be the priority.  Likewise, outside the isolation area, there isn't much else besides the island console and the giant Enterprise wall display, neither of which would function without power.  Perhaps engineering staff that were able to escape being stuck inside just ran out of ways to restore power with their limited access or lack of experience if senior personnel were all stuck inside and are off trying to find help or work on alternative solutions."
DaystromInstitute,3dqdbw,rextraverse,2,Sat Jul 18 17:09:48 2015 UTC,"I can think of two answers to your first question. In the first, main power being offline represents an interruption of power between the reactor assemblies and anything else; in this scenario the reactor must have some level of autonomous control which allows it to keep ticking for long enough that either control can be restored or it can step itself down (obviously it can't do the latter during the events of Disaster).  The other potential answer is that main power being down represents a failure of the power control systems, rather than the reactor or the physical distribution systems themselves. This is reasonably consistent, actually, since we see the bridge reroute power to a console in engineering, but they can't fix the problem with the reactor remotely; to wit, all the parts work just fine, but none of them are talking to one-another. We know that Starfleet power systems are very, very flexible, and in normal operating circumstances this is and advantage, but in some edge cases obviously it causes additional problems.  The reason why the antimatter stores in general don't go up when main power goes down is that the fuel pods have independent power supplies.  As to your second question, I just watched this episode the other day also, and it bothered me as well. The best rationalization I can come up with was that the initial damage to the ship was bad enough that main engineering was evacuated. In situations where this has happened before the bridge was able to take over, so it's not totally unreasonable for the engineering staff to have evacuated engineering due to some immediate-seeming threat, and then either assume that the bridge has everything under control because the ship hasn't exploded yet and there are no communications available for htem to find out otherwise, or be trapped wherever they evacuated to, unable to return to their stations now that the danger is past."
DaystromInstitute,3dqdbw,dr_john_batman,0,Sat Jul 18 17:00:25 2015 UTC,The deuterium tanks are designed to keep going even after a power failure specifically for that reason. Id imagine during a failure the warp core jettisons any antimatter into space.
DaystromInstitute,3dsa4i,Gregrox,7,Sat Jul 18 23:41:31 2015 UTC,"Except we know that isn't how it works. We have detailed drawings from in show, explanations, scenes and visuals that tells us how the engines work.  The main warp core is in the hull.  The matter and antimatter annihilate in the warp core. Dilithium is used to regulate this interaction and create plasma that is sent to the nacelles.  The drive plasma isn't radioactive, and as long as it is handled properly, not very dangerous (no more so than actual antimatter anyway).    Why are the nacelles put further away?  Because they take that plasma, send it through a coil, that coil outputs high energy subspace field distortions.  Better to keep the actual space warping equipment away from the crew if possible.  Not to mention in emergencies the drive plasma can be vented easier, or the whole nacelle ejected."
DaystromInstitute,3dsa4i,mistakenotmy,0,Sat Jul 18 23:57:47 2015 UTC,"That's not the point of what I'm trying to say. This is an alternate model to describe what happens in TOS, without looking at any of the diagrams or retcons from shows that come after it. It's not like warp nacelles are a real thing anyway!  And what do the coils even do with the plasma anyway? Use it for heat? You go to all the effort of using Matter-Antimatter full-conversion power source, just to inefficiently store the energy as plasma and pipe it to the warp engines?  There were never any detailed drawings from TOS, nor explanations in the show. Correct me if I'm wrong (and by ""correct me"", I mean show me exactly where it is mentioned, in TOS), but the phrase ""Warp Coil"" isn't even referenced once in the original series. Retconning doesn't count, even if it is accepted as canon."
DaystromInstitute,3dsa4i,mistakenotmy,3,Sun Jul 19 00:25:17 2015 UTC,"And what do the coils even do with the plasma anyway? Use it for heat?   No, not heat.  They coils create the warp field.  The plasma spins around in the coil and creates a subspace field distortion (kind of like electricity spins around a coil to create a magnetic field, and spins a motor for example).  So we are going from a warp engine we know from ST:FC and then Enterprise.  Ships go to a completely different system in TOS.  Then back to what we know for TNG and onward.   I'm sorry if you don't like retcons.  I wouldn't even call it retcons at this point. TNG and later Trek did a whole lot to consolidate and put together a somewhat coherent theory to the way things work in the universe. Sure its fiction and anything is possible but the shows did try to lay out some rules to follow.  TOS may not always fit into the more fleshed out stuff that came later but thats bound to happen in a franchise that spans 50 years."
DaystromInstitute,3dsa4i,mistakenotmy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:46:47 2015 UTC,"I believe you are still missing the point. I'm not trying to put this in with any of the rest of the Star Trek universe from any point in history other than from the years 1966 to 1969.  I'm not even saying that you are wrong! In canon, the Constitution Class ships used warp coils and warp plasma and all of that jazz. This is just an alternate possibility which I came up with. Potentially simpler, and a somewhat better descriptor of what was referred to in TOS."
DaystromInstitute,3dsa4i,Kant_Lavar,4,Sun Jul 19 03:01:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sorry. I guess I just don't see the point of separating part of the franchise from the rest of it."
DaystromInstitute,3dsa4i,stratusmonkey,7,Sun Jul 19 03:14:15 2015 UTC,"There's an argument for what you're saying, but the fact of the matter is that, even as easily as TMP, the warp core was established as being in the engineering hull.  The problem is that in TOS, the exact nuts and bolts of where things were and how they worked was very ill-defined. Not to mention those blueprints and the show, I believe, have some contradictions - main engineering in those blueprints is located with the impulse engines, but they also have the primary dilithium chamber there as well?  Personally, I try and reconcile these discrepancies this way (WARNING: COMPLETE FANON AHEAD):  Early flight Constitution-class ships actually had multiple smaller matter/antimatter assemblies. One in main engineering to be the primary source of the ship's power, and one in each nacelle to provide warp power. This lowered the potential risk to the crew in case of a threatened core beach, as in each case the reactor was in a location that could allow for easy jettisoning of the antimatter fuel pods or the entire reactor assembly, should it be necessary. Co-locating the engineering section and the matter/antimatter power core with the fusion reactors and impulse drive assembly also meant that more volume/mass could be spent on science spaces or recreation areas.  As Starfleet started to project material needs going forward through the end of the century, it was obvious that a growing Federation would need a Starfleet growing as fast, if not faster. Rather than have just a couple dozen full starships supported by flotillas of smaller, less-mission-flexible support, patrol, and survey ships, Starfleet envisioned multiple classes of starships, supporting and coordinating with each other to accomplish the same missions that would take a far larger number of individually specialized smaller ships. Add in the fact that the largest known source of dilithium, Coridan, was still refusing to allow the Federation to mine or purchase their dilithium, and one problem became abundantly clear: Starfleet had to economize its use of dilithium crystals immediately.  Bearing this in mind, Starfleet went to the newly-formed Advanced Starship Design Bureau. A complete refit of the original Constitutions had been planned for a while, but Starfleet decided to go a step further. Rather than simply overhaul the class, they wanted to attempt a complete redesign in order to bring the Constitution back to the technological cutting edge, but also to radically redesign the power systems. Instead of three smaller matter/antimatter reactors, they only wanted one large one. Eventually it was accepted that this meant moving main engineering away from the impulse engines, and instead devoting a large amount of the secondary hull to the new engine room and the reactor itself, much like the old NX-class. Some of this loss was made up for by removing many, but not all, of the ship's individual recreational facilities (such as the chapel, more commonly used as a mass meeting hall, as well as the infamously underused blowing alley) and replacing them with a single ""rec deck"" in the saucer section that, while larger than any other single rec space on the ship, actually saved about a third of the volume of the individual compartments it replaced.  One major danger, radiation, had also been dealt with; advances in passive and active means of containing the radiation from the matter/antimatter reaction, combined with the development of an effective radiation-proof suit that was far less cumbersome than previous models, meant that many of the maintenance and repair tasks that would require the evacuation of the compartment and full decontamination procedures now could be done without such extreme safety measures. In addition, the main reaction chamber for the warp drive, which in the past was such a radiation hazard that it had to be contained in the normally unmanned engine nacelles, could now be kept in Main Engineering with only a simple containment room and airlock chamber keeping the crew safe. Even under catastrophic circumstances (such as that seen in the ambush of U.S.S. Enterprise by Khan Singh and U.S.S. Reliant during the Genesis incident), the only immediate danger was to the engineering compartment itself - secondary protection around the compartment would protect the rest of the crew, and prompt medical attention in the form of simple hyronalin injections would be sufficient to treat the engineering crew."

DaystromInstitute,3dop6v,MungoBaobab,3,Sat Jul 18 03:03:04 2015 UTC,"True, but there have always been standards in place.  TOS had to answer to NBC, VOY and ENT had to meet with UPN's standards.   Not only did these networks have to answer to the FCC in not violating ""public decency,"" they had to answer to 100+ affiliates with whom they had a contract with in order to maintain a certain, pre-defined standard.  TNG and DS9 were sold directly to to the local stations by Paramount, but still would have had to have a pre-defined contractual standard with the stations.  But at the heart of OP's question, who really knows?  Showrunners have a history of pushing the envelope in terms of content, the Kirk-Uhura kiss being the most famous example.  I'm sure the kissing scene in ""Rejoined"" was looked at extra closely by upper executives.  I also remember reading that Rodenberry clashed with NBC on a few occasions over some of the women's dresses on TOS.

DaystromInstitute,3dop6v,234U,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:16:05 2015 UTC,"Which is why, if you have 50 or so main cast members spread across the various series, statistically-speaking, some of them would be gay, and since it's a future where gayness isn't an issue, they should be very visibly gay.  That alone is an oversight, but the fact that so few of the stories have any LGBT content, and even less positive, or forward-thinking content is extra dubious."
DaystromInstitute,3dop6v,BloodBride,4,Sat Jul 18 12:53:10 2015 UTC,"Do any of the ones who don't pair off explicitly state their sexuality? Also, do we know if any of the onces perceived as straight aren't bi? Just because something isn't explicitly said doesn't make me think that it isn't there. For example, next gen. Picard seems to only be attracted to women. He had... I think a total of four romantic interests historical and was a ladies man in his youth. Geordi and Worf both seem to be into women and not much more was said on it. Data did have sexual relations with Tasha Yar, but he never spoke of sexual attraction - merely that he is fully functional for a variety of activities. It's very possible that he would assume relations with any gender. Riker we usually see being treated as an object by women, he seems somewhat comfortable unless he loses rights as a result. He's likely straight, but also likely has issues as a result of it. The rest of the cast, we're never really told about them. The entire crew complement of a Galaxy class starship, and we only know this much about so few... Mainly because... it doesn't matter. ""Gayness"" isn't an issue in the future to such a point that people don't ask or really have to talk about it. There aren't stigmas, there aren't LGBT support groups... Because it's all such a non-issue that it doesn't really ever show up as relevant to anyone."

DaystromInstitute,3dop6v,234U,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:27:47 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're coming from, but gayness has a long history of being hidden. More precisely, being forced to be hidden or coded. Making characters not explicitly straight, so we can kinda maybe hope that they're a little not straight is a bad coping mechanism for frustrated writers and fans having to conform to a strict ""ethical"" code that despises homosexuality.  Gayness might not be a thing they need to talk about in the future--like Picard's baldness--but in a show from 1987-2004, it most definitely is relevant. It should have at least one on-screen appearance not accompanied by a massive but (but she's actually, not gendered. But Crusher isn't ready to accept this final iteration of her trill lover that is a woman. But they're reliving a past love life where they were a heterosexual couple). The fact that they can't casually toss it in the background like the skants from TNG S1 shows that it is still a big deal, and it was something they, as the creators, didn't hold on the same level of blaséness as the characters in the future."
DaystromInstitute,3dop6v,BloodBride,5,Sat Jul 18 17:10:40 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I'm not sure we can blame the creators - TV shows are limited in content based on what they think networks will willingly broadcast. If you did a majorly gay character on TV in the 80's, three things would happen. 1 - They'd be flamboyant because people back then couldn't write gay people subtly. Go on, go look. Good examples are rare. 2 - They'd get lower ratings. Most people weren't so okay with gay people back then. There's a very real chance that the TV show would get avoided as a whole for even having a guest character be gay. 3 - They'd get droped from certain broadcast channels. Channels pick up what sells. If people wouldn't watch it, ratings go down - back then that might even cost you network time from the more bigoted people. Ergo, I don't think it's the show's creators that are at fault, at least in the 80's, more that they were limited in what people would buy from them.    Also, Star Trek often got away with sensitive issues by using an alien race - the original series touched on racism with those two divergents, one half black and half white, the other half white and half black. But with sexuality, you can't really... do that. Because sexuality is as sexuality is. Any binary gender species will be the same - and people would likely still react the same. True, attitudes were better in the 2000's, they could have gotten away with it there... And to some degree they mention with Jadzia Dax that perhaps sexuality isn't as linear for all species... So they begun to touch on it. If they had another series with which to continue, it's possible that someone would have their sexuality declared more relevantly to current issues. I believe the show is a victim of being dragged down by the lowest common denominator of homophobic viewers in its past more than it was by anything else."

DaystromInstitute,3dop6v,Berggeist,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:52:34 2015 UTC,"I think that's the real shame of it though. Whoopi Goldberg even had to change one of her lines explaining what love is to make it inclusive of people rather than heterosexual couples.  We all know the logistical reasons for why putting homosexuality in Trek would have been difficult. That isn't the point, especially when so many other hot topics do get discussed, and in some cases even banned from airing in some nations. If anything I think the fact that people are apparently more comfortable watching torture than seeing a gay couple means that would have been even more reason to put gay characters in."
DaystromInstitute,3dop6v,DMPunk,4,Sun Jul 19 00:25:03 2015 UTC,"I find his answer sad, because Star Trek was one of those pioneers on TV in terms of equality and diversity. There were many things I don't like about Star Trek under the hand of its creator, but that is not one of them. Star Trek should always be at the forefront of inclusion and acceptance because that's what will build the utopia of the Federation."

His use of the term failed at it and then talking about inertia makes me think that there was a kind of uncomfortableness about the topic.  Clearly it wasn't something that was important enough to lay down on your sword about.  It could be that there were writers who were trying to go there and he wants to deflate but no one broke through.
DaystromInstitute,3dop6v,4d2,4,Sat Jul 18 03:22:03 2015 UTC,would that have affected the TV guidelines rating or just the sponsorships?
DaystromInstitute,3dop6v,hotdoug1,3,Sat Jul 18 02:27:29 2015 UTC,"It most certainly would have.  Sponsors often ""black-list"" certain shows in order to avoid any controversy.  Most of the time these stay between the sponsor and the network or station, but sometimes we learn about these.  The biggest reason is that these sponsors don't know what the show is going to produce, so to be on the safe side they stay out of it.    A ton of sponsors stayed away from NYPD Blue after they were the first network show to show bare butts and use the word ""asshole.""  Recently, Lowes got some bad press for not wanting their ads to on a TLC show about a Muslim family.  And honestly, ""Rejoined"" was pretty controversial when it aired, I wouldn't be surprised if any sponsored quietly dropped after it aired.  Anyone from a major national sponsor to your local car dealer down the street.  Source:  I've worked in TV for 16 years and my brother used to be an ad buyer for TV and other media."

DaystromInstitute,3dop6v,4d2,6,Sat Jul 18 02:41:07 2015 UTC,"I did searching I have to disagree, I would think Star Trek's handling of the topic would be sufficiently watered down to sanction a TV-PG rating.    Be careful to judge the edgier shows in the class with other onscreen portrayals of homosexuality.  The portrayals in Star Trek would likely be background facts and not central to the overall themes in the series.  I mean mostly that the reference would be likely a smaller point in an overall story arc.  I cannot envision a script where dilemmas are explored with a homosexual problem to solve.  Most of the LGBT oriented shows on television have this as a crux of the show.  Also the shows we have on TV usually explore other components that are likely not consistent with a Trek story.  Swearing is pretty common in shows of the ilk as well as nudity, that just wouldn't be a factor in anything we would see.  I found this little snippet for some context, it does show that homosexual portrayals were on the rise at the time (assuming 1987+ era TV).   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2000838/   Before 1970, almost no gay characters could be found on television, and their relative absence from the screen continued until the 1990s (Wyatt, 2002). In recent years, the number of shows with leading or recurring gay characters has varied from 16 in the 1997-1998 season to 29 in the 2000-2001 season (Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, n.d.). Although these numbers represent an increase compared with the past, they are still quite small compared with the overall number of characters appearing on television shows broadcast each season.   I can remember specific examples of gays on TV in primetime during the 70's and 80's.  Archie Bunkers Place in 1980 had an episode where Archie set up a gay waiter to try and straighten him out.  There were even schoolhouse specials about it by '87.  Given this it wouldn't be ratings that drove that decision but the dollar.  Paramount was simply afraid of taking that risk to upset the apple cart.    If they did air some episodes with gays explicitly involved, I am sure that more conservative leaning people would complain and that argument would complain to the FCC and question why the show was PG-13, but I don't really believe there would be a case to classify it as such."

There was a post a few weeks ago which argued, quite effectively, that the DS9 episode 'Chimera' was about homosexuality.  It's quite subtle. Watching the episode, I never thought about it that way. After reading the post however, it's suddenly quite obvious that this was the intent.  So yeah, I think you're right. They wanted to discuss it, but it needed to be heavily watered down. It seems like many people, including myself, missed the point entirely... but, at least it's out there.

Aside from the obvious plot of ""hey this alien race is a bunch of bigots"", there's plenty to explore.  In no particular order off the top of my head, there's parental and cultural expectations, there's the infighting within various movements, there's government officials jerking around populations they don't like with 'technical issues' keeping them from issuing marriage licenses, there's people who are straight but end up getting threatened simply for supporting gays, there's the high prevalence of homeless LGBTQ teens, and the entire argument about what Jesus would think.

What I was trying to get across was that most shows with a gay element to them were usually framed with this as a MAJOR driving plot of the entire series.  I don't see LBGT being a persecuted class at all in Star Trek. There is no Jesus in the Federation either, no Islam or really any organized religion among humans.  I don't see a gay issue being told in Star Trek with a gay character being a regular where this would present some type of dramatic situation that was problematic or stressful for the character. I think it would just be old hat for the 24th century.  I don't see Lt Fabulous being persecuted by the crew or receiving any sort of prejudice for his sexual orientation."

Voyager should have been a lot darker than it was; but they couldn't do it, partly because of the UPN, but probably also partly because of the PG rating.   Any of you guys who haven't, really do owe it to yourself to grab a copy of Elite Force and play it.

Roxanne was a married woman, at least at that time; and given how sexually attractive I've always considered her, if I'd been in McNeill's shoes, I would have found it very difficult to get through that performance.

DaystromInstitute,3dn5w5,CocksonHammerstroke,5,Fri Jul 17 20:00:44 2015 UTC,"That's the interesting thing most people never consider. A warp drive doesn't necessarily have to propel you faster than light. You could use a warp drive to propel you at walking speed, or 60mph, or 1,000 mph or 10,000 mph.  This is what kinda irks me about warp drive critics who blast NASA for ""wasting time"" on such experiments. They claim nothing can move faster than light so it's a waste of resources. However, they don't realize that it has applications at sub-light speeds. We could use a sub-luminal warp drive to take vacations on mars or go explore Saturn's moons in person (in a reasonable time frame and cheaply) or go mine some asteroids. They're a hell of a lot more efficient than chemical based rockets."

The fact that a (theoretical at best, and probably impossible) technology which is designed to work around relativity could be used at sublight speeds is irrelevant. If warping space is actually possible and feasible as a method of propulsion (both of which are a stretch, as Alcubierre's theories are highly controversial and rely on the existence of theoretical but undiscovered things like negative energy), then the lightspeed barrier is no more relevant than any other arbitrary velocity. Regardless, it seems incredibly unlikely that subliminal warp drive would be the most cost effective option given the massive energy cost.  I am no physicist, and if I had to put money on it I would say there is probably no way to move faster than the speed of light, but given that exploring beyond a couple ""nearby"" solar systems is a virtual impossibility without some kind of FTL propulsion it's worthy of investigation even if the odds are minescule."
DaystromInstitute,3dn5w5,williams_482,3,Sat Jul 18 04:06:09 2015 UTC,"The fact that a (theoretical at best, and probably impossible)   The 'impossible' part comes if you want to move at speeds equal to, or faster than light.   To do that requires exotic matter or energy (specifically, negative matter or energy). To move at subluminal speeds, no exotic energy or matter is required. It's definitely within the realm of ""plausible"". The negative energy is used to expand the spacetime behind your ship and it acts to ""push"" you faster than light (see here). However, if you can only compress the spacetime in front of your ship, you can still travel at speed, but not at FTL speeds. And the compression of spacetime is something we already see in nature: Black holes, dense neutron stars, etc... It's not something out of science fiction. The hard part, however, is creating a spacetime compression that's the equivalent of the mass of half the moon on a scale the size of a football field (or smaller). You need either energy density or mass density (atomic sized black hole) to pull it off.  That's precisely what Harold White @ NASA is researching right now. Seeing if they can warp or bend spacetime on a miniscule scale as proof of concept.    then the lightspeed barrier is no more relevant than any other arbitrary velocity.   The bending of spacetime isn't something theoretical, it's something that actually happens in nature. If it can be done on a small, local scale, it has all kinds of applications that have nothing to do with travel. That is, if it can be done energy efficiently. I suspect if they ever achieve it, we'll suffer the same problem we're suffering with fusion. We can ""fuse"" things, we can even create sustained fusion reactions. But the problem is it costs more energy than we get out. It's not efficient yet.    I would say there is probably no way to move faster than the speed of light   The thing with warp drives is that they aren't moving faster than light, spacetime is. And spacetime has moved at speeds exceeding C once before. During a period during the big bang which is called the inflationary epoch. During that time, the universe expanded from something the size of a dime to something the size of our observable universe in less than a second. The only way it could have done that is by moving faster than light. So we do have direct evidence of spacetime moving faster than light."

I am a firm believer in warp drive being possible, but the EMdrive project is not it.  If this is not what you are referring to, show me what you are referring to.  There is a fine line between fringe science and pseudoscience. EM drive is on the wrong side of that line.  he law of physics I was referring to was Newton's laws of motion and the Conservation of Energy., not General (or Special, for that matter) Relativity. Wormholes, Alcubierre warps, etc. are all well researched and continuing to be researched. But there is no hardware in production or even R&D at this point that comes close to warping space.  There is some good news though, of course. We don't have to rely on magical EM drives to get insane mass ratios for spaceships. Photon drives which are basically huge flashlights that produce thrust with an insane exhaust velocity. Problem is, one gigawatt produces something like 10 newtons of thrust, which is very small. We also could potentially use Nuclear Thermal Rockets and Gas-Core Nuclear Bulb rockets and even Orion Nuclear Pulse. These all fit under the term of Impulse tech, but they are within our technological levels and could allow for ships that travel significant fractions of lightspeed. Warp Drive is a very real concept which may eventually be opened up to us as we explore the boundaries of sane energies. Even a warp drive that travels 10% lightspeed would be brilliant. Even a 6 centimeter per hour warp engine would blow us away!  EM Drive is not the way to do it.

This fits nicely with most of our head-canons that federation-design drives are very efficient and use very little energy.  Edit: So I would say that the theoretical foundations where allready in place and Cochrane discovered some neat trick to do it with orders of magnitude less energy.

A corner of Picard's subconscious very likely ""checked her out"" just a little without any sort of active choices made on his part. I have a hard time imagining Picard being really lewd even in his thoughts; it could have been as minor as a recognition of things he found attractive about her.

In other words, someone with the willpower and intellect to keep flirtation and teasing instead of trying to go right for bed. As part of a species that isn't embarrassed about thoughts, it's important to find someone who can linger for long periods in certain states - if you will, a jacked up version of savouring the anticipation. Picard's own awkwardness in romance, however, alongside his serious consideration of protocol and duty, push him away from that, even as he subconsciously realizes how much fun an evening could be. I figure Llwaxana realizes this after her failure at dinner, but can't help teasing him just a little bit every time she sees him later. Not out of scorn or anything, but because, and I'm being perfectly honest here, it's really fun to watch someone squirm."

As a powerful woman, I could see Lwaxana taking the reins from Picard from time to time, which I feel he must like. Picard is frequently in control, but not usually a control freak about others, so being with someone assertive could allow him to step back and breathe.   The attraction probably wasn't incredibly strong, though. I think Lwaxana was ultimately too grating for him. So while she read his mind and sensed a latent, but not overpowering, attraction, she played it off like it was the strongest emotion ever felt.   It's obvious Lwaxana has a thing for people who are reserved and rigid in their personalities because she likes a challenge. She would intentionally press Picard's buttons to see if she could knock down the wall a bit. I think the two probably really respected one another, clash of personalities aside."

Most people, even after knowing her for a long time, find her no more than an intrustive, self-absorbed, socially oblivious and burdensome harpy. But in truth, she's deeply caring and very aware of what other people think, feel and care about, she's extremely nonjudgmental, she keeps people's secrets, and as an enormously successful Federation diplomat and betazoid noble, she's obviously pretty good at getting what she wants regardless of her disinterest in etiquette and social pretense. The fact that most people underestimate and misinterpret her so badly must chafe; certainly, we've seen lots of evidence that she's very lonely. Someone like Picard, who may find her deeply annoying but has certainly never thought of her as any less than a charismatic, intelligent woman highly competent in her field, must be a great comfort, especially given his own worth and intelligence."

DaystromInstitute,3dncb7,pm_me_taylorswift,5,Fri Jul 17 20:44:13 2015 UTC,"I think she told the truth, from a certain point of view.   As a powerful telepath she'd certainly be able to see what Picard sees, as he sees it, so she probably spent entire conversations lying in wait for him to just absent-mindedly glance in the general vicinity of her chest, ass or hips, not even necessarily noticing he was doing so, and pretend to assume it was in a sexualized manner.   If he called her on the extremes she took it to, she could still quite truthfully say she caught him looking, and being an honest man he wouldn't be able to deny having done so, even if it was literally impossible not to look at certain parts of her while moving his eyes or head to other, perfectly innocent areas, and that'd be an awkward thing to admit aloud.  Of course, there's also that as an expert telepath, Lwaxana is no stranger to how peoples' thoughts work, and she'd be well aware that merely planting the suggestion that Picard was entertaining lewd thoughts would practically force part of his mind to think those things.  After the first time she did it to wind him up, he's such a prude that he probably spent every encounter thereafter thinking ""Don't think about her breasts, don't think about her breasts, FUCK!""   It is rather telling though that Picard never does ask Lwaxana to stop embarrassing him. He's a gentleman but not exactly hesitant about getting his way, particularly where his dignity is concerned, and she is an important diplomat and couldn't afford to alienate the captain of the flying hotel she relied on to conduct business semi-regularly, so I can't imagine her not stopping if he asked seriously in a private moment - or if she read in his mind that he really found it offensive.

I don't know about that.  If I were a wounded Changeling fleeing through a forest, I think looking like a forest creature would be a pretty sensible first step.  For all we know, the Vorta thought they were hiding a wounded Vorta.  That doesn't require them to be sentient; just social.  Of course, that part of the story doesn't necessarily need to be true for the rest of it to be.   It's possible the angry mob were themselves Vorta; who else would be on the Vorta's planet to hunt a Changeling in the first place?   If the Vorta are correct about their origins, it's hardly implausible that there was an ordinary humanoid species on their planet that has since simply been eliminated by the Founders.  Actually wounding a Changeling is certainly grounds for a genocidal response in the Founders' eyes.   All things considered, the Vorta don't seem likely candidates to have been uplifted from nonthinking animals into sentient life forms.    I don't know.  We know the Changelings are very, very good at genetic manipulation.  Crafting a humanoid that can go from infant to combat-ready in three days is quite a feat.  Given their overall paranoia, it's not inconceivable that they may have wanted to start from a blank slate when devising their immediate servitors.  In my estimation, the origin of the Vorta could easily go either way—modified humanoids or uplifted critters.  If the latter, the reason for their uplift could be fabricated, or it could be some version of the truth."
DaystromInstitute,3dofvz,Crowforge,2,Sat Jul 18 05:39:07 2015 UTC,who else would be on the Vorta's planet to hunt a Changeling in the first place?   Perhaps the ancestors of the Jem'hadar?

The hate the founders experience could have been another example of the super poor diplomacy they seem to be capable of. Also, we dont know how long it took from the time that individual founder was protected until the founders got around to start the uplift process, let alone finish it, it might have been 10 000 years."
DaystromInstitute,3dofvz,IkLms,6,Sat Jul 18 07:25:40 2015 UTC,"Uplift involves modifying a species' genetic structure. There's a very strong bias against genetic engineering in the Federation - look at how Julian Bashir's family had to keep his treatment secret, and look at how the genetically engineered Jack, Lauren, Patrick, and Sarina are treated. It's therefore very unlikely that the Federation would use genetic engineering to uplift other species."
DaystromInstitute,3dofvz,NWCtim,8,Fri Jul 17 23:59:09 2015 UTC,"Uplift involves modifying a species' genetic structure.   It would be difficult to argue that genetic engineering is the only tool available to uplift a species into sentience. Voyager gave us temporal distortion as an example of another method.  If we consider cultural uplift, humans have started to uplift gorillas and dolphins with structured language in the same time period as required to start developing genetic engineering."
DaystromInstitute,3dofvz,IkLms,4,Sat Jul 18 01:26:57 2015 UTC,"Not sure if this is allowed in this sub since it references outside of Trek, but another uplifting example would be doing so technologically to a race that was yet to be space traveling.  An example of that is the Krogan in the Mass Effect series who were uplifted specifically for the goal of fighting a war that was currently being lost.  Now I'm not sure if there was ever an instance where that might be necessary in the Trek Universe, it's possible that in a desperate fight for survival against the Borg the Federation or another race may consider it with an especially violent species similar to the Klingons."
DaystromInstitute,3dofvz,stug41,4,Sat Jul 18 02:53:20 2015 UTC,I think the Federation would be more likely to turn to solutions that are more along the lines of genocide or WMD's before turning to uplifting other species.

DaystromInstitute,3dnz4v,Astilaroth,3,Sat Jul 18 12:43:27 2015 UTC,"Heh thanks. I love ethical stuff and there is usually no clear/cut answer to them, so even though I have strong personal convictions on certain topics I rarely take things black/white.  By now I have some thoughts on your view by the way. Apart from that I love to think about episodes like this on a deeper/metaphorical level, I think there is one thing 'wrong' with your analysis in this case.   In my opinion, the abortion debate, the true debate, is when life starts. Here in the Netherlands, you can abort up to 24 weeks of fetal age. After 24 weeks, technically speaking and in the best of circumstances, the fetus is viable for life. Very very early births around this time can lead to a healthy happy kid in the long run, provided the right medical intervention etc.  Anti-abortion folk argue that before 24 weeks (or whatever it is wherever in the world), it is also already a valuable life. A potential life is a full fledged worthy life to them in all ways possible. Some take conception as a start, others the first heartbeat.. either way it is well before birth.  In your analogy, Tuvix is already 'born'. It is not the termination of a potential life, but an actual one. This makes the whole episode seem to skew towards a pro-life/anti-abortion view of the debate, if we take your analogy as the deeper meaning of the episode, namely that the fetus/Tuvix has rights. The fact that he is 'aborted' anyway, could be seen as a life and death matter in terms of perhaps the mother surviving? I think the analogy gets fumbled if seen from this angle.  So yeah, I do like the analogy but it's only correct if we ignore the 'potential life' aspect of the usual abortion debate I think."
DaystromInstitute,3dnz4v,Astilaroth,2,Sat Jul 18 18:05:51 2015 UTC,"You could also say that the question of ""when life begins"" is a non sequitur. Even if we grant that the fetus is a ""life,"" we still have no basis to prioritize that life over the autonomy of the mother. (That's the point of the ""violinist"" thought-experiment another commenter has mentioned.) Yes, Tuvix is a life, and that life needs to end so that the pre-existing lives of Tuvok and Neelix can thrive."

DaystromInstitute,3dnz4v,bgcarlisle,16,Sat Jul 18 18:47:14 2015 UTC,"We're talking about fully formed conscious, sentient beings here for all parties involved. To me that doesn't lend itself well to the abortion debate at all."
DaystromInstitute,3dnz4v,Algernon_Asimov,7,Fri Jul 17 21:26:09 2015 UTC,"The author of probably the most famous academic work on the subject of the ethics of abortion would disagree with you: http://spot.colorado.edu/~heathwoo/Phil160,Fall02/thomson.htm  Her famous argument, which I have linked to above, and which I recommend you read in full before responding, is a similar thought experiment, in which two fully formed humans are used in a thought experiment concerning abortion. The one is not conscious, but the point still stands.  (Post edited to clarify the point)"
DaystromInstitute,3dnz4v,bgcarlisle,2,Fri Jul 17 21:48:25 2015 UTC,"/u/0Sanctuary referred to ""fully formed conscious, sentient beings"". That article you've linked does not refer to a foetus as fully-formed or conscious or sentient. In fact, the writer originally starts arguing against the premise that a foetus is a person from the moment of conception:    It is concluded that the fetus is, or anyway that we had better say it is, a person from the moment of conception. But this conclusion does not follow. Similar things might be said about the development of an acorn into an oak trees, and it does not follow that acorns are oak trees, or that we had better say they are.   The writer goes on to ""propose, then, that we grant that the fetus is a person from the moment of conception. How does the argument go from here?"" She's saying that she'll accept the premise that a foetus is a person for the sake of argument.   However, conceding that a foetus is a person is not the same as saying the foetus is fully formed or conscious or sentient.   To take just a few obvious exceptions:    A foetus is definitely not fully formed. One could argue that humans are not fully formed until about 25 years of age, when their brain stops developing. You're a person, and yet you're not conscious for about eight hours every day.  A dog is sentient being (the European Union recognises animals as sentient beings), but it is not a person.    You've conflated ""personhood"" with ""fully formed conscious, sentient beings"", when they're not the same thing."

DaystromInstitute,3dp8ec,ItsMeTK,5,Sat Jul 18 03:17:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think it is partly 2 things.  It is convoluted on purpose because writers don't like pinning specifics down unless they half to.  It is a way to keep option open for stories in the future.  I think different writers had different ideas.  Different writes made their own assumptions, wrote episodes with those assumptions but still never nailed anything down. Therefore, we have kind of a mess.  My theory, the Federation may be spiritually like the UN but is much closer to the the US in structure.  A much more cohesive and powerful central federal structure and government. That could just be because I am from the US and our current federal structure has worked well, and our much weaker first try, the Articles of Confederation, well not so much...  So in my head:  The Federation = The US Federal Government  Member Planets = State governments  Starfleet = The US armed forces (plus science and exploration)  Any local planetary forces = State patrol/local police units (quasi military, more like local coast guards in scope (yes I know the US Coast Guard is an official branch of the US armed services, but I think the comparison between Navy/Coast Guard makes sense.))  Starfleet Academy may be on Earth but that doesn't mean there are not other branches on other planets.  Current state university systems often have campuses in multiple cities.  Starfleet Command is on Earth but that doesn't mean there are not other command areas or centers.  Just like the current US military has multiple areas of responsibility and separate commands.  (In other words, we see Earth as the center because the writers were human and things obviously biased that way on the show.)"

DaystromInstitute,3dp8ec,Neo24,2,Sat Jul 18 17:11:26 2015 UTC,"The Federation seems so Earth-centric simply because historically Humans have been the glue that binds the Federation together. Prior to the Federation, to of the first member worlds were at each others throats (Vulcan and Andoria) but the Earth proved a neutral intermediary to bring them together.  As far as Earth government goes, it seems that Earth has a unified government that came about after the Third World War. The old nation-states are just cultural regions. Now it's likely that Earth, like Vulcan and Andoria, have there own local government with jurisdiction over specific planetary matters.  Or, it's possible, given Earth's position as capital, that the government is similar to that of Washington D.C. It can make it own laws in certain respects, but that the Federation Council oversees the planet and has final say over how it is run.   It is strange to me to witness so much about the Klingon High Council, the goings-on on Cardassia, the Bajoran provisional government   We do witness some of this with the dealings of the Federation Council and President and Starfleet. But while we might not see anything about the administration of Earth, neither do we see anything about the administration of Ty'Gokor or Pentath III. And as far as Bajor goes, they never even give the capital a name during the series.  The Imperial/Federal governments are the more important governments for the series, not the local or planetary governments. It's more important to know the workings of the Klingon High Council than it is know the politics of the administrative council of Qu'Vat Colony."

Star Trek VI indicates a Starfleet Commander-in-Chief separate from the Federation President, but DS9's president says he is the Commander-in-Chief.   There doesn't necessarily  have to be only a single person with the title. From wiki: ""A commander-in-chief is the person or body that exercises supreme operational command and control of a nation's military forces or significant elements of those forces."" The Starfleet C-in-C might just be the head of Starfleet, who then reports to the President, who is the C-in-C of all Federation forces (which aside from Starfleet might include other organizations - we've heard of a Federation Naval Patrol, and it's likely there are member world local forces too).   Does Earth even have a government of its own?   We've had several references to United Earth (and even more if you count the novels)   Are there local police forces of any sort? Starfleet seems to be the only military on the planet (as evidenced by the troops put on the ground in ""Paradise Lost""), which seems a bit silly given that it is the Starfleet.   The Vulcans have the V'Shar so it seems that member worlds still have their own security organizations. Also, according to the writers, we were supposed to see the Federation President federalizing Earth's own forces (like an American President would federalize the state National Guards) in ""Homefront/Paradise Lost"" but it got cut from the script because it would have taken too much time from the rest of the story and possibly confuse the viewers.   Is there a Navy? Is there an Army?   Navies would be largely obsolete considering the technology that exists. As for the Army, we've seen some ground troops in Starfleet uniforms and Kirk did call Starfleet a ""combined service"" so it's probable than any (non-local) ground troops are simply part of Starfleet. Also, again due to technology, armies would be a lot less important than they are today.   If Starfleet answers directly to the Federation President, does that mean the people of Earth are at the mercy of the Federation and that humanity has literally no governing body that speaks for itself?    Presumably the people of Earth vote in the elections for the President. And they have a Councilor sitting on the Federation Council. And there's United Earth for local matters."

So the US government has similar authority to right now, but sometimes they have to go along with the United Earth government; even if they don't really want to.

But I don't think heads up displays were really something that anyone would have thought about when making the set for the original Enterprise, and tradition kept the viewscreen pretty much the same for the other shows.

DaystromInstitute,3dn16t,FoldedDice,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:02:06 2015 UTC,"Noncanon reasoning in a TOS world incoming!  In TOS, warp coils being the source of spacewarp was not canon. The nacelles were power generators as much as spacewarp engines. In TNG and onward, a breathe-on-it-too-hard-and-destroy-the-ship warp core was in the engineering section and the warp nacelles were solely the part that warped space.  I don't buy the ""phasers and torpedoes can destroy the ship instantly"" thing. The entire reason for warp nacelles on long pylons is so that the radiation and heat from the power system is a good long way away from the crewed sections of the ship. The Warp Nacelles are where power is generated, and the little spheres on the back of the nacelles are space/warp generators. So if you shoot the engines, only the engines are destroyed. Starship systems are separated from each other. Knock down the shields, and slice through the saucer, and the crewmembers in that part of the saucer will die, but the rest of the ship would still function. The warp engines could still warp, the impulse rockets could still thrust, and the navigational deflector could still deflect space dust. The only ship-wide system that would be affected would probably be the structural integrity field, or perhaps polarizing the hull plating on the saucer section if it's NX-era."
DaystromInstitute,3dn16t,Gregrox,5,Sat Jul 18 14:14:33 2015 UTC,"There's two bridges on the Enterprise-D.  One on top of the saucer (the Main Bridge) and one located on Deck 8 on top of the ""neck"" (Auxiliary/Battle Bridge).  The saucer covers it normally but it's exposed when the ship separates.  As to why they do that?  No idea.  I know on some newer designs (The Nova Class and the Defiant Class in particular and most likely the Rhode Island Class) the bridge is actually recessed into the ship a bit and not as exposed."
DaystromInstitute,3dn16t,elspazzz,5,Fri Jul 17 16:56:57 2015 UTC,"Not sure where you're getting that idea from. The bridge on the TNG Enterprise is at the top of the saucer as well, though there is also the battle bridge located at the top of the ""neck"" for when the saucer separates. The large opening in the front of the secondary hull is the navigational deflector"
DaystromInstitute,3dn16t,Chris-P,3,Fri Jul 17 17:05:18 2015 UTC,"while in TNG the bridge seems to be in the bottom half with the engines, and the saucer section was secondary.   The Enterprise D had two bridges.  The main bridge was on the top of the saucer section, in the center.  The secondary bridge, which was referred to as the battle bridge, was indeed in the lower half of the ship, where it was better protected.  (In reality, it tended just to get used in those few circumstances where the episode's budget permitted a saucer separation.)  As for why the main bridge should be on top of the saucer, I don't know.  It's right by the observation lounge, so it's not impossible that part of the motivation is to permit limited visual observation in the event of a sensor failure—though with the scales involved in space travel, it's hard to imagine what you could possibly see of use.  Perhaps it's there to place it close to external sensors?  The longer the connection from sensors to bridge, the more opportunity there is for damage or sabotage to sever the connection."

Actually, the in-movie explanation was broken even before we consider whether the effects of gravity can be felt faster than at the speed of light. There should be no gravitational changes at all.   The stars were destroyed by implosion. The matter still existed, it merely collapsed. As Riker explained, ""A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclear fusion is breaking down."" If the matter still exists, it still exerts the same gravity. If our Sun were to magically collapse into a black hole (less than 6 kilometres in diameter!), the Solar System would continue as before, with all the planets staying in their current orbits. It would have the same mass, and would exert the same gravity.   Collapsing the Veridian star should not change its gravitational effects on the Nexus ribbon in the first place, even before we consider whether the speed at which those non-existent effects would propagate."

Quark admired Jake's choice to become a writer, suggesting that there was profit in writing holosuite programs, especially the intimate ones.  That at least shows that writing for profit is considered acceptably Ferengi, as far as he's concerned.  I would imagine that they have less appreciation for ""starving artists"" than humans do, though.

There are elements Janeway is fully aware of - Praxis exploding had a big effect of quadrant and let to the treaty between the Klingons and the Federation.    JANEWAY: So what's happening? Are we about to encounter the Klingons?   TUVOK: Not exactly. The Klingon moon Praxis is about to explode.  JANEWAY: Praxis.   TUVOK: During this period, it was a primary source of energy for the Klingon Homeworld.   JANEWAY: Praxis. Yes. Its destruction would have lasting repercussions throughout the quadrant, and it led to the first Federation-Klingon peace treaty.    But when Tuvok goes into more detail about his protest over Sulus decision to defy orders and try and help rescue Kirk and Bones Janeway clearly unaware of these events.    JANEWAY: So what happened? Did you go to Praxis?   TUVOK: No. We were warned off by the Klingons, and resumed our survey mission. However, two days later, we learned that two Starfleet officers were accused of murdering the Klingon Chancellor. They were brought back to the Klingon Homeworld to stand trial. Captain Sulu had served under both officers for many years, and he felt an intense loyalty to them.   SULU: Helm, set a course for Kronos, maximum warp. Take us through the Azure Nebula. That should conceal our approach.   HELMSMAN: Aye, sir.   JANEWAY: I don't get it. What's going on?    Later in the episode Janeway is pouring over logs trying to get more information about the Excelsior but there isn't a whole lot to work on.   JANEWAY: You may be right. Nevertheless, I've been studying the Excelsior logs.   KIM: What do they say?   JANEWAY: Unfortunately, they don't say anything at all.   KIM: Nothing?   JANEWAY: It would seem that Captain Sulu decided not to enter that journey into his official log. The day's entry makes some cryptic remark about the ship being damaged in a gaseous anomaly and needing repairs, but nothing else.   KIM: You mean he falsified his logs?    Probably the clearest evidence of all is right at the end after everything has been sorted. Janeway actually has no idea how it all played out and has to ask Tuvok what happened.   JANEWAY: I'm curious. Did the Excelsior ever save Kirk and McCoy?    If Janeway doesn't know this off the bat then I think its safe to say that the very few know the details of Kirk and Bones being captured, their rescue, the plot between Klingons, Romulans and Starfleet and the failed assassination of the President of Earth. Maybe Janeway just didn't pay attention in history at all but you'd think this would have been pretty important. If nothing else surely it would have come up when studying James Kirk (assuming he is on the curriculum at Starfleet Academy).   So yeah I'd go with the assumption that it was all covered up. None of the parties involved would really want the truth getting out. Not sure how the Romulans would react but the Klingons using a cloaked ship and aiding an enemy in killing the Chancellor wouldn't go down well amongst Klingons and neither would any of the actions undertaken by Starfleet Admirals by other Federation members."

Still, I think Captains leaving stuff out of logs was probably pretty common at that time such as Spock telling Scotty to fake engine problems and so on.  I think it's an entirely a different case to say that all parties involved (remember, there were more people at the conference besides Starfleet, Klingons, and Romulans) covered everything about the conspiracy up successfully for at least the next 75 years and that the news media of all stripes either never figured it out and/or were complicit in the cover up.    Obviously, we don't know whatever tin foil theories are floating around, but at best it's a relatively small amount of people or else the conspiracy theories would be common knowledge, even if they weren't believed and I have to believe that Janeway would be the type to dive into such a mystery or at least to be aware of it.  Still, there's something to be said for the fact that we really don't know what was and wasn't public knowledge even at the time regarding the events.  It's entirely possible that not only was the location of the peace conference kept secret, but its existence as well.  That would mean that everyone with any knowledge of just about every event in the movie except Praxis exploding would be already sworn to secrecy at least at the beginning.  That would seem to make it easier to keep it secret going forward too.  All you have to explain away then, are the deaths, the damage to the Enterprise and imprisonment of the conspirators.

I'm just thinking about the peace conference on Khitomer and there were a lot of deleagtes from what I assume were various Federation members. Could they have covered up the assassination attempt and subsequent arrest of Starfleet Admirals? A lot does play out right on the floor of the conference - Valeris being shamed, the assassin being revealed as a Colonel West and not a Klingon and then the arrest of Admiral Cartwright and the Romulan Ambassador.

Obviously a narrative would have to be crafted to make sense of it all and allow for natural interest to be assuaged, but my point was that it's infinitely more simple when it was all a secret to begin with and you get to have time to design not only the story, but when and how the information is released.  Not a simple task, and neither is keeping the several dozen dignitaries, crew of the Enterprise, crew of the Excelsior, and anyone logistically involved from letting it slip.  That's child's play though, compared to covering it all up when the public is aware of the assassination and the attempted assassination, Kirk and McCoy's imprisonment, the diguised admiral, high profile arrests, and so on."
DaystromInstitute,3dkbpj,eternallylearning,2,Fri Jul 17 12:04:02 2015 UTC,"Hmmm.  I am not so sure we can use Janeway's historical ignorance as explanation for much.  She was living... I think 82 years in the future?  (""Flashback"" is 2375, right?)  So the details of the Khitomer Accord, and Kirk's involvement in those events, are about as important to her as the details of, say, the market crash of 1929 would be to a 21st-century Internet community.  They might know the broad strokes -- people got greedy, market crashed, bank runs, bread lines, New Deal -- but few would know what, for example, the Hawley-Smoot Tariff had to do with it.   And, remember, history recorded that Kirk died just a few months after Khitomer, so Janeway could easily have garbled the two in her mind.  Of course, none of this speaks especially well of her Academy history courses, but I don't think it's a failure of our tax credits that this wasn't covered enough to force her to retain it.  History is enormous, and remembering the key fact -- peace with the Klingons was offered out of Federation generosity -- is more important than the exploits of any one man, however interesting."
DaystromInstitute,3dkbpj,BCSWowbagger2,2,Fri Jul 17 19:40:24 2015 UTC,Her ignorance does imply that she was unable to find this information out easily though.

But he was contained on routine patrols in an inferior ship.    Yep.  They did more or less the same thing to Janeway when they made her Rear Admiral; and for probably the same reasons.  Kirk and Janeway were very similar in a lot of respects.  They were both very accomplished, but they were also almost exclusively fire team/crisis leaders who routinely made extremely questionable decisions, and who were therefore considered terrible managers in peacetime.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSp9geqULuY  The above clip provides an archetypical example of Janeway's approach to problem solving.  While it worked, I probably don't need to mention how it would likely be received by a Starfleet review board or judicial hearing.  For comparison, below is a clip of Martin Riggs from Lethal Weapon 2.  I've truthfully always considered Janeway a hybrid of Riggs and Katherine Hepburn, in terms of personality; which is in turn part of the reason why, as previously mentioned, my own ideal Voyager remake would have a hard R rating.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZls8aoA4CQ  As such, those sorts of loose cannons present a serious dilemma.  You don't want to alienate them completely; you need to keep them in reserve in case there is another serious crisis at some future time, which is what they are qualified for.  You also don't want to alienate the majority who want to view them as heroes.  At the same time, however, you don't want anyone lower down the chain getting the idea that they can completely disregard the rules, as long as they make sure that everything turns out all right in the end.  As accomplished as he was, Kirk in particular disregarded formal discipline more or less entirely; in his mind, his crew were his friends, more than his subordinates.  If you're going to have a coherent military, that is not the type of example that you want prominently on display.  Picard's approach was a lot better.  Yes, there was affection for the crew, (particularly towards the end) but he still could and did pull rank when he needed to.  The solution is to put them out to pasture.  Give them their old ship, and as many of their old crew as want to stay with them.  This will both make them happy, and will also ensure that the proverbial band is kept together for any potential future performance.  At the same time, short of any truly messy crisis where they are likely to shine, and you've got nothing to lose by sending them in anyway, the only missions they get are studying asteroid belts or stellar debris fields in some remote, inconsequential backwater, well away from any active theatre."

It's funny that even now, when special effects in a movie can consistently blow your mind, aging makeup always looks so phoney. I remember seeing Prometheus and instantly recognizing that old guy was not old but in makeup (something that was never fully explained, I don't know why they didn't cast a truly old person instead of memento).  In addition to the good point already made about expectation/familiarity, I think a big issue is that makeup and prosthesis add bulk...a person's face often becomes smaller or sunken with time, that is pretty hard to duplicate with makeup. Instead, they look weird because in order to get deep lines they've added like an inch to the head radius.  The good makeup in Star Trek has stuff that sticks out (and is supposed to by design): bumps, ridges, etc. Notice they never had alien races that looked human except they had a head 1/2 the size with deep indentations in the head."

DaystromInstitute,3diiac,fremandn,7,Sun Jul 19 12:39:01 2015 UTC,"This is a topic of interest to me. I've long followed with interest not only the state of the art of effects make-up, trying my hand at some myself, but also the industry which has its own society and its own cliques.  And the Westmore family is one of them.  Sometimes an old black-and-white film had its make-up done by Ben Nye or someone, but generally it was one Westmore or another. It was just the way of things for Westmore to work on a big project like TNG. I frankly never liked the ""bumpy forhead of the week"" aliens, the ear-hood approach of the Vulcans, the trainwreck that is the Romulans or the old age make-up. Even in the best of episodes, like Inner Light, Picard finally ended up looking like bill cosby after a stroke.  However, make-up of the level you or I might want, with the very latest (and they didn't always have the techniques and materials we do now) is a much greater time-sink than weekly TV allows for and I suppose I give Westmore a pass because that schedule must have been insane. But they really also did not have the gel-type make-up appliances we have now and they did alot with the techniques of the day. I think old age, truly believable old age, is the holy grail of make-up jobs and still hasn't passed out of uncanny valley even on the best of budgets and schedules."

Combine this with broadcast tv quality in the 90s, and it's going to look possibly more convincing because of the loss of definition.

So huge that even at high-warp it would take months (or years) simply to sail from one end of UFP space to the other.  Space is also very, very big; and very, very empty.  Ostensibly the near real-time speed of subspace communication would allow them to divert ships and resources as-needed, with each sector having its own police force (in a manner of speaking).  The problem is, of course, we too-often approach the UFP as a (very romanticized and idyllic) analog for the USA. When, really, the sheer size of UFP space necessitates a very, very, very decentralized government and military.  So, essentially, I assume UFP space is divided into more-or-less autonomous regions, each with their own major shipbuilding and starbase facilities, and their own academies. The reason we see so much of Earth's Starfleet and Earth's installations is simply a result of cultural bias."
DaystromInstitute,3djky0,butterhoscotch,4,Thu Jul 16 22:53:44 2015 UTC,"I disagree, it would need a special governmental and management structure if not for as you pointed out, near instant communication across hundreds of light years. That means they can communicate and get orders from earth near instantly no matter where they are.  Also any disloyalty, sedition or attempts to rebel or succeed would be reported near instantly and ships could be dispatched to arrive anywhere in the federation within days to months, depending on travel time probably less."
DaystromInstitute,3djky0,Sly_Lupin,4,Fri Jul 17 02:39:42 2015 UTC,"shrug The geography and technology of Star Trek is just such a mess there's really no way to paint a very accurate picture of things.  For the most part we can assume that subspace radio is instant communication (mostly due to Voyager), but that could just as easily be the result of lazy/inattentive/shortsighted writing.  The size of the Federation is equally a disputed issue, as are the speeds at which starships can travel.  Star Trek Voyager's premise hinges on the fact that at ""maximum warp,"" it would take the Voyager approximately 70 years to travel 70,000LY, which (too) easily boils down to the Federation's top-of-the-line starships being able to traverse 1000LY in the span of one year. In First Contact, the size of the Federation is supposed to be 8000LY.  The problem, of course, being that LY is a linear unit of measure.  Anyway, if we take everything at face value, we have a political state that would only barely (and in extreme conditions) be able to send a ship from one end of its territory to the other... in EIGHT YEARS.  The recently-released ""Stellar Cartography"" book paints a substantially different picture. It states that local space (IE Federation Space) is a region approximately 700LY across (and rather amorphous at that). The totality of ""known"" space (IE that which has been charted) is estimated at approximately 20% of the total volume of the galaxy (of course, even now, we don't know (really) how big the Galaxy is).  Regardless, at the maximum size we have a Federation so big it takes 8 years to traverse; at the minimum we have a Federation so big it takes more than 8 months to traverse.  At best.  In practice? Much longer.  And while communication may be instant... that's just words. Just information. To actually move ships about? To be able to respond to emerging situations quickly? That requires a great degree of decentralization.  (This also handily explains why there was a battle at Wolf 359, instead of somewhere further on the fringes of Federation space--the sheer amount of time involved in bringing as many ships to bear as possible necessitated a battlefield very close to Earth).  ((And it also explains why, suddenly, the Federation's Starfleet seems so much more numerous than ever before in DS9--the Federation had time to reorganize and restructure its deployment to accommodate the rising threats--time they did not have when they reacted to Wolf 359, or the Klingon Civil War for that matter)).  (((And, to a degree, why the Enterprise is so often the ""only ship"" capable of responding to a threat--it's not that they're the ONLY ship in the area, but that they're the ship best able to respond in the timeliest manner)))."
DaystromInstitute,3djky0,Sly_Lupin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:28:35 2015 UTC,Yeah politics really must be a nightmare figuring out where the borders end. It's hard enough on Earth right now as it is and we assume a mostly 2d surface. Making it three dimensional adds so much more complexity especially since there aren't really natural features to use as a border.
DaystromInstitute,3djky0,Algernon_Asimov,2,Fri Jul 17 15:13:35 2015 UTC,"It's more like trying to figure out national borders 2000 years ago, before any sort of modern cartographic techniques existed, and everyone was pretty much just making crap up and drawing (not-at-all-to-scale) crude maps. Pretty much every time we get new cartographic info in a Star Trek episode, it's (violently) contradictory to something previously established."
DaystromInstitute,3djky0,Algernon_Asimov,3,Fri Jul 17 21:36:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Federation has a border, as such. A lot of space and solar systems aren't owned or claimed by anyone. And, members and colonies of the United Federation of Planets could be anywhere.  First, to have a single border for the Federation implies that it is internally contiguous, which I don't think is the case. I believe there are some Federation colonies and members who are far distant from the core of the Federation, with the space and systems between the Federation core and these Federation outposts not actually being owned or claimed by the Federation (kind of like Hawaii or Alaska for the United States - the US has sovereignty over those two areas, but doesn't have sovereignty over any land/sea which connects them to the mainland US).  Second, borders often exist only where there's something on the ""other side"". There are areas of the Federation which abut the Klingon Empire and the Romulan Empire, so there are borders between the Federation and the Klingons, and between the Federation and the Romulans. However, there are other regions of Federation which merely lead to empty unclaimed space - there's noone else beyond the Federation's final outpost/colony/member. So, it's hard to say in those regions where the Federation actually ends - where its border is.  Thirdly, the perimeter of the Federation would be huge. Picard tells Lily in 'First Contact' that the Federation has over 150 members ""spread across eight thousand light years"". If we assume the Federation covers a simple circle-shaped area of space, that makes for a perimeter of over 25,000 light-years - which doesn't allow for the fact that the galaxy is actually three-dimensional and about 1,000 light-years thick, so that our perimeter becomes a two-dimensional surface of approximately 25,000,000 square light-years. Of course, the Federation is not a simple circular entity - galactic politics (like the Klingons and Romulans!) will see to that. And, it probably doesn't occupy the full 1,000 light-year thickness of the galaxy. However, we can safely assume that, with at least one dimension of 8,000 light-years, the Federation's perimeter will cover at least 16,000 square light-years (once up and down each side of a single 8,000 light-year corridor, with a thickness of 1 light-year), and definitely much much more than that.  So, we have:   Discontinuous borders. Areas which border on known empires versus regions that border on unclaimed regions. A lot of border.   That makes for a situation where it's extremely difficult to monitor all the borders at all times, and also not worth monitoring all the border. Even with automated sensors and detectors, the Federation simply can't watch all of its borders. So, naturally, they'll focus their efforts on the areas where problems are more likely to happen. For example, there are permanent outposts along the Romulan Neutral Zone, with regular patrols in the area. But, in another place, there's some poor Federation colony on the edge of nowhere which probably gets visited every few years or so.  The Federation borders are very big and very porous. I don't think there is such a thing as a border patrol.  (Plagiarised from this earlier comment of mine.)"

How do you suppose they deal with pirates and smugglers that pass into the Federation in the less monitored areas of space? Does the Federation have a bad problem with crime in these regions? I also do wonder if there's a police force that is outside of Starfleet to deal with these things. It seems strange to have the military searching for people that have arrest warrants and such."

Well, pirates would be dealt with by Starfleet if and when they attack civilian traffic. I'm pretty sure I remember at least one episode somewhere sometime where the Enterprise was looking for pirates in a particular sector.   As for smugglers, how does one smuggle something into a place where there's no border and no taxes? Also, if you were a smuggler, why would you smuggle something into an economy which doesn't have any money to buy your goods?  The borders are porous. The borders don't exist. There's no economy to support smuggling. And pirates are just the same as any other people who are disrupting civilian traffic."

DaystromInstitute,3dl0a9,Sora713,10,Fri Jul 17 03:07:46 2015 UTC,"why aren't there any in Starfleet?   I don't know. The more I've thought about this, the more I realise this question needs an answer.  If we look at the primary casts of the 6 Star Trek series, we have 44 main characters to consider. Then there are all the recurring characters (especially in DS9!), plus the one-off characters. Eventually we reach a point where it becomes almost impossible to explain how, among dozens and dozens of main and recurring characters, not one has been non-heterosexual.  People say that Star Trek shouldn't be about relationships and romance but, in DS9, every main character ended up in at least one long-term romantic relationship over the course of the series. Even the recurring characters got into romances along the way. At times, it was almost a sci-fi soap opera! It wouldn't have been too hard for one of those relationships to have been same-sex. What if Elim Garak had managed to seduce Julian Bashir? Andrew Robinson originally played the first lunch between Garak and Julian with homoerotic undertones - but was told to rein it in. And then the writers made sure that Julian developed a crush on Jadzia. But, what if things had gone differently? Imagine the potential for drama in a Starfleet officer having a romance with a Cardassian spy!   But, no. All we got was Jadzia kissing another female Trill - which was okay because it was actually a former husband and wife who just happened to be in female bodies right now. Nothing gay about a husband and wife still loving each other!   People say that the timing wasn't right. However, by the time DS9 was in its final season, the time was right to make a prime-time sitcom with a gay title character. Maybe that was too late for DS9 to jump on the bandwagon, but there was plenty of time for VOY or ENT to join in. I hear there was even talk that one of the characters in ENT was intended to be gay... but nothing ever came of that.  Homosexuality was simply invisible in Star Trek."

And this leads to the point of view which Marina Sirtis said: we probably only saw the most notable of these relationships. For all we know, the Enterprise crew was having wild sex at every stop they made, but we only saw the tip of the iceberg. Maybe the gay sex just happened off-screen.   But every main DS9 character had at least one long-term relationship. This tied up significant sections of the characters' on-screen time. There's no insinuation that there are a lot of one-night stands happening off-screen. We saw all the romances. Which means there's no way to say the gay sex was happening but we just didn't see it."

DaystromInstitute,3dl0a9,Neo_Techni,2,Fri Jul 17 13:16:05 2015 UTC,"Does Odo even have a gender? Changeling biology (if you can call it that) is so different from bipeds that gender probably doesn't apply.  Changelings don't even seem to have a sense of individuality. Its as if every part of a Changeling contains a bit of brainpower rather than it being centralized with an organize biped. When a Changeling joins in a link the two become one. They merge, forming a single entity. The Great Link is just one creature. Its a species with both a population of only one and also a population of millions, depending on the size of the Great Link at any particular time. A drop of water joins the ocean and becomes the ocean. And the ocean can produce drops of water.  Odo's form was a mimicry of the man who discovered him. If it was instead a woman rather than a man who had discovered him, Odo's form could have just as easily been feminine rather than masculine.  There's no reason why Odo even has to be a biped. Odo could exist as fire if he so wanted. And I use the pronoun ""he"" purely because of the way the English language works, using ""it"" to describe Odo is often seen as disrespectful due to cultural reasons, even though the pronoun may be more accurate.  It would be like me trying to assign gender to an amoeba. It just doesn't apply. An amoeba doesn't have gender. It doesn't work that way.  And along these lines, its entirely possible that Changelings may in fact be extremely highly evolved and advanced amoeba-like things. Every part of their body is generalized rather than specialized. To use an analogy, they have no cell differentiation. Every cell does everything. Every part of Odo is able to think and remember. His fingertips are able to think. His ears are able to form memories. He doesn't have a brain, at least, not all in one place. Its spread throughout his entire body. When a Changeling links its cells mingle with another Changeling. Two become one, quite literally. Its now one living creature instead of two. Yet because every cell (or basic building block of Changeling physiology) retains its own identity, when a Changeling decides to leave the link all of those bits and pieces flow back together.   Odo could be more of a collective than an individual. There could be billions or trillions of tiny building blocks that all decide, collectively, that they shall be called Odo. Upon joining the link they flow apart and move throughout the Great Link. When Odo leaves the Great Link, his constituent parts move together and reform what they have decided is Odo."

There are occasional straight couples seen in background shots during the whole run of TNG, and every romantic pairing involving the main characters was heterosexual (even the androgynous character who Riker fell in love with wanted to be a woman). So, the gay relationships, if they were happening, were hidden from us.    And both odo and dax had what'd be considered a same sex relationship   I think that's reading quite a lot into Odo's interactions with Laas.

Actually, 35 x 2% = 0.7. That's nearly 1 gay character.  I work out that there were 44 main characters (actors who appeared in the opening credits) across the 6 Star Trek series. And this includes Jadzia Dax, who repeatedly dated, and even got married. There's no reason to exclude her. Also, Data and Odo and the Doctor each had on-screen romances; there's no reason to exclude them from consideration. So, 44 characters. 44 x 2% = .88 gay characters (almost 1).

DaystromInstitute,3dl0a9,Algernon_Asimov,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:33:57 2015 UTC,"First off, my apologies for my inability to count or do basic math.   The reason to exclude Jadzia (and probably Ezri) is that Jadzia did try to enter into what would have been a lesbian relationship in Rejoined. Odo was dropped because his species is sexless and he appears to be mostly asexual, Data and The Doctor because they could probably change their own sexual orientations with a couple lines of code if they so chose.   If we leave in everyone, we get 0.88 ""expected"" gay characters against 1 ""definitely bisexual"" character. Recurring characters adds a mix of heterosexual relationships and no romantic relationships, with one character (Garak) who was at least initially played as a gay man (I do not know if he actually was).   The numbers you give are averages, which is an important distinction. The odds of 0/44 people being gay would be 0.9844, which equals 41.1%. That's under 50%, sure, but it's hardly out of the realm of possibility from an in-universe perspective."

Data or the Doctor could try a same-sex romantic relationship just as an experiment (like Data did with Jenna in 'In Theory'). Similarly with Odo: if he has no inherent attraction to one gender over another, he's just as likely to fall in love with a man as a woman.    The odds of 0/44 people being gay would be 0.9844, which equals 41.1%.    I assume that probability just keeps dropping, the more characters we count.

The first is the relevant question from an in universe perspective, in which case dropping Odo, Data, and the Doctor makes sense, and the fact that their relationships were all with the opposite sex is some combination of trying to be more ""normal,"" greater availability of potentially willing partners, and pure chance.   Thinking about the relationships (most of them very brief) they have had, Data's only two (Yar and Jenna D'Sora) were both initiated by the women. The same is true of Odo's brief relationship with Arissa, and at least partially true of the Doctor's Vidian partner. The Doctor also had feelings for Kes and Seven, the only two people who regularly worked closely with him over the course of the show and both of whom were clearly interested in men, while Odo began to have feelings for Kira well after her sexual orientation was known to him. Personally, I suspect that if Data were approached by a gay man, or a person in Kes' or Seven's role happened to be a gay man, then Data or the Doctor may well have gone for it. Hell, it's possible that happened to Data off screen, although at this point I have fallen into rampant and baseless speculation.  The second question, meanwhile, is only relevant (admittedly very relevant) out of universe when looking back at decisions made by writers/producers/etc, and doesn't give us many definitive answers to the first.

Dr. Soong admitted that he built Data without emotions. When he sent out the signal for Data to return, he told him he had finally gotten his emotion chip working and was going to install it. Unfortunately, of course, Lore showed up and tricked him.  Data's very definition of his ""friendships"" to Troi was that the people around him are certain patterns and he would ""miss"" the loss of those patterns."
DaystromInstitute,3dj6im,DasJuden63,6,Fri Jul 17 01:27:58 2015 UTC,"Curiousity, desire, ambition, etc. If Data did not have emotions, he would not have enrolled in Starfleet, he would not aspire to become more ""human,"" etc., etc. Even simple things like self-preservation are dependent on emotional investment.  There's a fallacy that many writers fall into when writing artificial life forms--a fallacy of assuming that an artificial life form can only ever experience the exact same emotional spectrum as a human being, or none at all."
DaystromInstitute,3dj6im,Sly_Lupin,3,Fri Jul 17 01:32:22 2015 UTC,"I believe his desire to become more human is the only emotion you listed.   Data joining Starfleet is just a logical choice given his skill set of enhanced physical and mental abilities, also why he didn't go the command route, rather specializing in systems and information.   Curiosity is ingrained into his programming, the drive to learn and solve problems that he does not know.   And self-preservation is just the most logical route in most cases. In Nemesis he disregarded that drive in order to deliver the emergency transport transponder to Picard. He regularly goes into situations that only he can survive, even without a guarantee. An example of this is ""Time's Arrow"" when he willingly goes down to the planet because he is the only one with a sensitive enough phase modulator even though he knows he will be sent back in time and quite probably die.  Edit: On how many occasions does Data admit that he has NO emotions of any kind?"
DaystromInstitute,3dj6im,DasJuden63,3,Fri Jul 17 02:05:01 2015 UTC,"shrug  Ultimately it comes down to what you think emotion, at its core, is.  I see emotion as impetus. It is the force that identifies one state or situation as preferable to another. Some people like to think that emotion is irrational--it is not.  Why did Data choose to enlist in Starfleet? You say it was logical.  But was it? Really?  Data could have done anything. Gone anywhere. Become anyone. Starfleet is not the only organization that caters to individuals of scientific or erudite inclination--nor is it, arguable, the best. What makes Starfleet unique, what sets it apart from other organizations, is its mandate to explore--Ex Astris Scientia and all that.  Exploration that is very frequently met with danger.  So Data, newly born, chooses to place himself in mortal peril so that he might learn something, emulating the first intelligent beings with whom he came into contact.  Curiosity and desire are both emotions, and emotions that are (I would argue quite fervently) central to his character. I would also argue that he routinely demonstrates respect, loyalty, affection and a whole host of other emotions.  Get out of the silly Star Trek notion that logic and emotion are somehow antithetical. They're not. When Data acts logically, that is not the same thing as being unemotional; conversely, acting illogically is not indicative of emotion, either.  Ultimately, a being without emotion can only exist to exist. To perform any actions beyond those immediately necessary to the perpetuation of life are, ultimately, a result of emotional impetus. I honestly feel that declaring Data incapable of emotion does an equal amount of disservice to his character as would the same declaration against Spock."
DaystromInstitute,3dj6im,Sly_Lupin,2,Fri Jul 17 04:41:49 2015 UTC,"Ok, I'm going to be going a little out of order discussing your points.   I honestly feel that declaring Data incapable of emotion does an equal amount of disservice to his character as would the same declaration against Spock.   There is a HUGE difference between an android and a Vulcan. Vulcans are NOT completely devoid of emotion, in fact, canonical evidence tells us that all they do is learn how to supress their emotions. This is proven when Picard mind melds with Sarek in TNG, Spock's breakdown in ST, and Tuvok every seven years when it is time to mate. Data was literally programmed to be without emotions and only emulate humans to a very high degree.   I see emotion as impetus. It is the force that identifies one state or situation as preferable to another.   This can be resolved by complex nested If/IfElse/Else loops in a computer program. If an action either serves to improve the situation of the computer running it or not it decides what to do, and can possibly make changes to its own program to include specific situations.   So Data, newly born, chooses to place himself in mortal peril so that he might learn something, emulating the first intelligent beings with whom he came into contact.   What evidence is there that Data immediately decided to join Starfleet? How do we know that he did not consider going into any other field?   Curiosity and desire are both emotions, and emotions that are (I would argue quite fervently) central to his character.    The only thing I have to argue about this point is curiosity and desire being emotions in this case. Again, it is stated that Dr. Soong intentional programmed Data to have the ability to expand his programming and probably gave him the desire to do that in order to keep him reliable.   I would also argue that he routinely demonstrates respect, loyalty, affection and a whole host of other emotions.   All of those can be attributed to him following Starfleet orders such as respecting senior officers and being ""used to their patterns"".   To perform any actions beyond those immediately necessary to the perpetuation of life are, ultimately, a result of emotional impetus.   Not necessarily. We constantly make decisions based on quality. Does this action in any way improve my existence? Will it help me advance in my career? Will it lead to my death? I strongly suggest you read ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"" by Robert M. Pirsig to understand how Quality can be removed from emotion without any detrimental effects.  And finally:   Get out of the silly Star Trek notion that logic and emotion are somehow antithetical.    Do you remember what subreddit this is? For the purpose of this discussion, all we have is ""the silly Star Trek notion"".  I'm not arguing against Data's satience, only his ability to possess emotion. It is repeatedly stated throughout TNG that he is completely incapable of them. All of your points can be argued against using an advanced enough computer program, which we could expect from a 24th century scientist with a positronic matrix for a computer to install it in."
DaystromInstitute,3dj6im,DasJuden63,2,Fri Jul 17 05:24:17 2015 UTC,"Ultimately I guess it boils down to whether or not you believe those explicit statements regarding Data's emotion or not. Personally? I don't. Part of that's because I do see emotion in Data's actions. Some of that may be a result of personification, some because of the fact that Brent Spiner is far from unemotional, himself, and some of his emotion inevitably bleeds into his portrayal of the character.  Another thing to consider (constantly, unfortunately) is that Star Trek is far from a coherent setting due to the sheer number of individuals who helped give it life. Data is a character whose words were written not by one hand, but by dozens--all of whom saw the character slightly differently. For every scene where Data is written as an emotionless robot, there's another where he expresses--however subtly--a glimmer of emotion.  That's what made Data (to my mind) such a compelling character (and what made the ""emotion chip"" in Generations such a cop-out): he wasn't human, but wanted to be, and every so often we could see that maybe, in small ways, he was more human than he, himself, knew.  One of the most notable/memorable examples of course being the final scene(s) in TNG: The Most Toys, where it's left deliberately ambiguous whether or not Data murdered a person whom he may or may not have hated. (And it's worth pointing out that both Brent Spiner and one of the writers were ""adamant"" that Data did, in fact, pull the trigger--but the producers insisted the scene be ambiguous)."
DaystromInstitute,3dj6im,Sly_Lupin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:49:54 2015 UTC,"data is capable of having interests despite lacking emotions. Just because he cant see the beauty of a sunset doesnt mean he doesnt find it fascinating. He has many interests, from sherlock holms holo novels to painting, all without emotions. Without enjoying them, or liking them. I personally do not feel curiosity is an emotion exactly, or if its possible to have curiosity sans any emotional compenents otherwise."
DaystromInstitute,3dj6im,butterhoscotch,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:07:01 2015 UTC,"I remember a scene in TNG in which Sarek, on his death bed, lamented not showing Amanda how he loved her so much. I am assuming that he meant that he loved her all throughout his life deep inside, but did not and could not express it outwardly in the confinements of standard Vulcan customs and culture. Does that mean that Vulcans, in fact, feel very strongly in every moment of their lives, but do not show it or act on their emotions?  In TOS, Spock constantly used to make the point that Vulcans 'do not feel irritated/annoyed/etc.', when Bones and Kirk used to tease him about Vulcan stoicism. These statements confuse me, as they imply that Vulcans have purged their emotions to the point where they do not exist anymore."
DaystromInstitute,3dj6im,vulcanlute,2,Fri Jul 17 01:23:09 2015 UTC,"I think the Vulcans like to tell themselves that they don't feel, but really they do.  They suppress emotions most of the time, but in instances of strong feelings, the emotions will break through.  Spock will visibly smile happily or lash out angrily at times."
DaystromInstitute,3dj6im,meh4354,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:43:01 2015 UTC,"Spock was part human, however, so I'm not so sure he's such an excellent example to use. But when thinking about Sarek's experiences with Bendi syndrome, it does seem plausible. I think it's more than just suppression, though. The amount of stress they would experience from suppressing such volatile emotions would break them. On the other hand, through practiced philosophy and meditation, I imagine one can conquer one's emotions.   One thing that puzzles me though, is hearing once that Vulcans 'evolved' to conceal/suppress their emotions throughout their modern period. I imagine the term 'evolution' doesn't refer to genetic mutations encompassing the brain structure, but rather to the progression of their culture. Training a child at a young age to be stoic, however, seems to be a nearly impossible challenge. If a child experiences strong emotions as a child, do they not experience some feeling of rejection or sadness seeing their parents and community express no emotion at all? And therefore, become rebellious, and practically the opposite of the others - until they reach a certain age to understand Vulcan teachings?"

DaystromInstitute,3dj6im,coolpoop,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:42:58 2015 UTC,"They feel them, but the part of them that feels is locked away, not impacting their every day life, so they don't really feel them.  Imagine you get shot in the leg, and it hurts a lot.  Then the adrenaline kicks in and you no longer feel the pain.  It's there, you're just not experiencing it.  You can look at your wound and see how much pain you must be in.  But if the adrenaline wears off, or you're in so much pain that even the adrenaline can't suppress it, then you'll feel that pain.  Vulcan meditation techniques function as a sort of ""emotional adrenaline"" which they can turn on or off on a dime.  They can choose to dive into their deeper subconscious and see what they're feeling, but they normally don't do that.  Bottom line is, they have emotions, they just don't normally feel them.  They're buried deep where they don't have to worry about them, as long as they meditate properly."
DaystromInstitute,3dj6im,time_axis,5,Fri Jul 17 02:53:54 2015 UTC,"The description of the test as forcing a person to face their ""greatest fear"" is merely a colorful description. Technically it is ""a psychological evaluation based on reactions to various individual problems.""  The purpose of the test is to evaluate whether a candidate will panic or remain capable of making decisions under certain conditions. The conditions are hand tailored based upon the candidate's psychological profile. For species like humans, this is closely associated with fear, as fear is likely to cause panic-induced paralysis.  For species or beings like Vulcans or Data, it might not be fear induced, but other similar situations that would be difficult for them to make a decision. Perhaps a situation with a logical paradox, or no way to otherwise choose the ""most logical"" outcome."

DaystromInstitute,3di1cv,adamkotsko,17,Thu Jul 16 13:05:37 2015 UTC,"Regarding the Ferengi, I don't believe they ever actually identify themselves as Ferengi. They never explicitly state what species they are or that they're from ""The Ferengi Alliance"" (which may or may not even exist as a coherent political unit in the 22nd Century). The Ferengi episode was meant as more of a ""nudge in the ribs"" to the audience, we know who they are but the Enterprise crew do not. A random report to Starfleet about a single encounter with a large-eared, greedy species could probably apply to any of the many species Starfleet formally encounter over the next 150 years.  The same with the Borg, they never identify themselves as ""the Borg"". Arguably a race of interconnected cybernetic humanoids does stand out a bit more than the Ferengi, but we're still talking about a single encounter over a century and a half before Starfleet ""officially"" encounters them. Maybe a Starfleet officer looks up a history of any reports about cybernetic species, but as Flox remarks himself cybernatic augmentation isn't that uncommon among some species.  As for the Orions... I viewed it as the writers sort of trying to recton the outright sexism of TOS represented by the ""Orion slave girls"". Revealing that they can in fact use pheremones to control the males in their society, their position becomes a lot more intriguing and deceitful. These woman are NOT slaves after all, they willingly put themselves into positions of vulnerability in order to use subterfuge to rule from the inside out.  I agree that it is a poor retcon, but it is what it is."

DaystromInstitute,3di1cv,4d2,8,Thu Jul 16 14:58:23 2015 UTC,"One way it enhances the TOS experience might be that it paints a character like Pike, who was drawn to Orion women and fantasized about them, in a more flattering light. Instead of him enjoying a performance by a woman robbed of her freedoms and forced into a life of servitude, she's a willing participant on the prowl in complete control of her captive audience."
DaystromInstitute,3di1cv,MungoBaobab,4,Thu Jul 16 16:29:06 2015 UTC,Did Pike really enjoy the whole interaction with Veena as a slave girl? I always thought more he tolerated it tactically.
DaystromInstitute,3di1cv,4d2,3,Thu Jul 16 16:34:02 2015 UTC,"Earlier in the episode he had this exchange with Dr. Boyce:   PIKE: Well, for one thing, go home. Nice little town with fifty miles of parkland around it. Remember I told you I had two horses, and we used to take some food and ride out all day.  BOYCE: Ah, that sounds exciting. Ride out with a picnic lunch every day.  PIKE: I said that's one place I might go. I might go into business on Regulus or on the Orion colony.  BOYCE: You, an Orion trader, dealing in green animal women, slaves?  PIKE: The point is this isn't the only life available. There's a whole galaxy of things to choose from.   Like the picnic illusion, Pike's Orion fantasy was drawn from his desires. So on some level, he was drawn to that lifestyle. In fact, his G-rated picnic with a demure girl-next-door Vina versus a wild party with a sultry Orion woman prefigures later Freudian themes explored in TOS with Spock and McCoy voicing Kirk's superego and id. It's worth noting that Pike rejects both a quiet life and a debauched one in favor of remaining in command, which is perhaps the ultimate expression of the Freudian concept of ego."
DaystromInstitute,3di1cv,pm_me_taylorswift,3,Thu Jul 16 16:56:13 2015 UTC,"Thats a good analysis, I remember him rejecting her in some sort of disgust in her portrayal of the slave girl. I could just be bringing that to the table myself.  I'm unsure of how aware he was about the reality of Orion trading. No doubt that he had some conceptions of a lurid lifestyle if we are to take those simulations as drawn from his fantasies.   I wonder though if one of the reasons that those enticements failed is they lacked some essence of his fantasies. Or that those fantasies were his and although a female counterpart did play a role they were really about him and faced with an active partner in them they lost some of the magic. It is interesting that only as his situation changed did he begin to accept her an equal footing, maybe..."

Patriarchy is by no means the ""default"" or ""normal"" state of society among humans, so there's no reason to expect it to be for alien species, beyond simple projection of contemporary historical biases (which, to be honest, is a plague Star Trek suffers from as much as anything else).  As for the Orions, specifically, the explanation given is more or less that Orion females have powerful, magic-pheremones that have a hypnotic affect on Orion males (and, indeed, most genders of most species, because Star Trek is just rife with magic).  As for why that revalation fails to shed light on Orion society or Orion storylines in prior series... why should it do that? It's a script for Enterprise, all it's meant to do is be a script for Enterprise. What it does do to the other series is add depth to a species we really knew NOTHING about beforehand. Like it or not, for as long as they've been part of the franchise, the vast majority of what we know about the Orions (and the Tellarites and the Andorians for that matter) come from ENT, in much the same way that most of what we know about the Klingons comes from TNG."

DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,axcairns,24,Thu Jul 16 00:33:50 2015 UTC,"Also the advances in warships in the early 20th century. Ships designed and built during and just after WW1 were obsolete by WW2, and mainly used for secondary roles or scraped for their metal."

In five years technology advanced so fast in virtually ever arena that whether it was tank, plane or battleship they all became obsolete by the end of the war.  An army with technology of the united states from 1940 would get steam rolled by an army with technology of the united states from 1945.

DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,butterhoscotch,30,Thu Jul 16 06:33:50 2015 UTC,"I believe focusing on the NX-class design itself is too limiting in trying to understand why such a versatile platform was retired so quickly. We need to consider the impact of the era in which it was designed ane built, just as we would with any other major industrial undertaking or military/scientific project.  Unlike the post-TOS United Earth of unlimited energy and replicators on every corner, everything we see about the Earth of ENT seems to suggest it more closely resembles the current status quo than that of a post-humanist paradise. Money still exists, people still work for a living, and Earth is barely a century beyond total nuclear devastation. In short, and even using a meta-approach of how the series itself was billed, Earth in the 2160s isn't too much different from our own time in terms of societal norms and processes. Based on this premise, we have no reason to assume that industry - while actively shifting to keep up with revolutions in materials and energy production - is much different from today. Materials are still mined, refined, and built piece-by-piece in the same fashion naval vessels are built today. More than that, companies are likely still awarded contracts for construction, and their products are only as good as the means used during construction. In short, Enterprise was built by the lowest bidder, in the shortest amount of time, with materials and construction techniques that aren't too much more advanced than current concepts. The class was then subjected to extreme conditions the designers couldn't possibly have imagined (see: Delphic expanse), and a war where - as the only Warp 5+ vessel in inventory - she was the most strategically valuable craft in Earth's corner. The amount of stress put on these spaceframes was so great, I'm surprised they lasted 5 years, let alone the 10 they would eventually wring out of the old birds.  Compare this to the post-TOS era, where technology level alone has made this process unrecognisable compared to what we would see today. Materials and composits are no longer dug up and refined into hull plating, they are replicated perfectly in situ, or just as they are needed for assembly. These materials and components would be literally perfect, down to the atomic scale. More than that, construction is aided by perfect control over gravity, force-fields, tractor beams, and all these wonderful mature technologies that were only the fevered dreams of mad-men during Jonothan Archer's time. It's no surprise that when you can make machines with such precision in both construction and parts, of course they're going to last a century of more. This kind of warps our perception of the state of Starfleet and the greater Trek universe, so we approach vessels like the NX and wonder; 'if the Excelsior design can last over a century, what a poor design the NX must be to last barely 10 years'. For different eras, we must hold different standards.  I believe that these points, taken into consideration with major technological leaps made during the service-life of Enterprise, firmly justify a short hull lifespan. This was a time of social change and great innovation, and sometimes that means the greatest industrial endeavours get left in the dust long before they rightfully should have. Still, we need to remember that the NX was at its core a test-bed for new technology and explorative doctrines. As with the first generation of anything, they don't last nearly as long as more mature platforms. If anything, the speed at which Earth's tech-base improved over such a short period of time should be testament to the success of the NX program as a technology demonstrator."
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,Tsushimiami,5,Thu Jul 16 02:52:36 2015 UTC,"I think you're heavily exaggerating the quality of manufacturing post-ENT. In TNG ""The Drumhead"" the event that causes the entire plot to kick off is a critical part of the warp core failing catastrophically, flooding Engineering with deadly radiation. It's initially thought to be sabotage, but it turns out that the part that failed had a manufacturing defect that had been missed prior to installation.  And this is in the 2300s, when money is no longer an object, and the Federation has no reason to subcontract any of its work.  Hell, everyone in the TNG-era shows constantly complains about how replicators can't quite match the real deal. If 24th century humanity can't get freaking eggs and bacon right, how can you possibly expect them to get critical hardware right?"
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,eccitaze,3,Thu Jul 16 20:43:04 2015 UTC,"Good point with noting the accident in Drumhead! You're totally correct that this demonstrates that manufacturing problems still arise with incredibly advanced matter replication technology.  However, this also demonstrates that 24th Century humans are still just that; human. To call the process perfect is certainly an overestimation on my part, but in comparison to 22nd century manufacturing techniques, it's the next best thing.   I'd call this defect in the dilithium chamber a result of software problems, rather than any inherent issues with Federation industrial manufacturing. A replicator works by converting energy into matter using a pre-defined pattern, so any corruption of this pattern data - no matter how small - will give rise to flaws in the final product. Future computer systems are robust as all get-out, but they can't be assumed to be perfect. Hell, we see time and again that computer problems occur far more often than they should.  In addition to that, programming and software development seems go be offloaded from human hands to a computer all the time. We rarely see software engineers dealing with the computer when goes haywire, and what should be a dedicated role appears to be relegated to second-tier status for a few techs in engineering. I guess this goes back to some kind of mild technophobia, the same reason why we don't see advance AIs and more artificial lifeforms like Data. Regardless, a single software glitch can't count for much against the overwhelming evidence of ships and equipment lasting for generations. A fact that can only be explained by incredibly advanced and damn-near perfect manufacturing standards.  As for discrepancies in food versus bulk manufacturing, it's an issue of complexity and tolerances. For hull plating, you just need a simple crystalline lattice arrangement of atoms and you've got yourself a 10 square metre slab of duranium. Processing power needed? Minimal. The components of a dilithium chamber? Complex, enough for a tiny defect to creep in unnoticed by the techs, but still effectively perfect. A plate of eggs benedict with smoked salmon, fresh spinach, on sour dough toast? Well. Now the software has to worry about differing consistencies, a mulititude of interacting substances, minute variations that can heavily influence taste. And, above all, a discerning consumer that is already biased against this ""fake"" meal. Comparing the needs of bulk manufacturing versus Ensign Ricky's dinner is like comparing apples with... well, duranium alloy. Totally different in this instance."
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,Tsushimiami,44,Fri Jul 17 00:44:07 2015 UTC,"The NXes are tightly packed ships, now the boffins have come up with some fancy new weapons tech (dual phaser emitters, I think they said?) now - they look like they'll fit into our phaser cannon wells, but powering them? Hmm it's gonna require bigger plasma conduits. And we need better fire control, so another cabin is having to be replaced with computer banks.   But, now the mess hall is receiving more radiation from the new emitters.. and theses photons are great but the brass want a higher yield just in case, so they're now 20% bigger. So the armoury is expanded to accommodate those new magazines and wider tubes.   Those cool new shield systems? Well, they need power too. We can't fit an more conduits in safely, so we'll put the capacitors nearer to engineering. It's pretty cramped in there now. As soon as we hit mild turbulence the engineers bang their heads.  A few years later  Oh, there's a Warp 6 engine design available! Its only a little bigger than our NX design, but it's even tighter fit in there now. Brass thinks we should keep going but we all know that the retrofitting needs to stop until the miniaturisation is worked on. Plus the old duritanium alloy formula is looking mighty out of date..  Time for a new chassis, with a bit more breathing room. A lot of the parts on the NXes are still fully functional and have hardly changed so, in order to speed up the new classes construction we'll be cannibalising parts where appropriate. It's not a dignified way to go, gradually phasing them out until they are just skeletons in orbit, waiting to be melted down or flung into the sun.

DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,psaldorn,23,Thu Jul 16 00:23:16 2015 UTC,"10 years may seem short for a ship but you have to remember that it was an experimental ship. It is a test bed. As a point of reference, the Mercury and Gemini missions were each only about 5 years long. The Apollo missions (if you include the unmanned missions) was only 6 years which includes a delay in the program after the disaster of Apollo 1. That time frame also includes only 3 years of actually landing on the moon, with one lucky mishap in Apollo 13. I say lucky because they made it back after what seemed like certain death.  Weapons and defense: ships can leave dock without systems installed if they're expected to be installed by the crew later or if they're expected to return for a retrofit. The Enterprise B left dock without a tractor beam, photon torpedoes or a medical staff for it's maiden voyage because they didn't expect to be called into action. As for the updates between NX-01 and NX-02, that happens to our current navy. A fleet of ships is designed and built over a decade or more with the first ship getting the oldest tech and even just the second or third ship among the class already having updates only a few months after the first ship is completed.  The current photon torpedoes are not shown to track their targets. The tactical officer and computer calculate a point of impact and fire. In essence, the ship they're firing at literally runs into the torpedo's line of fire. In First Contact, we see Data shoot three quantum torpedoes at the Phoenix (granted, he purposefully missed) but when watching them travel, they move in a straight line from the Enterprise to barely missing the warp ship. Even though they barely miss, it's still a moving target. We see the same problem later in Nemesis when the E-E goes up against the Scimitar. When the E-E is finally getting hits, you can see that they're firing into the Scim's flight path. As for proximity detonation, that's a bad idea in space. Anything blasted outward would continue until it hits something. That could be you or another friendly ship.  Having command codes to destroy a friendly missile is something we currently do. Cruise missiles have this feature, as well as our nuclear arsenal. They're lucky to have this ability. I doubt a photon torpedo does. Then again, I would also doubt that a photon torpedo would bounce off an asteroid and come back at the firing ship. (edit) Given more thought, photon torpedoes (and other types) probably have an internal kill switch in case they miss and continue flying off into space. Granted, this still wouldn't be a safety feature that benefited the ship firing the torpedo if for some reason it ever came back. It also wouldn't help any other ships in the same battle if they happen to run into the still active torpedo. The kill switch probably wouldn't have that short of a fuse/timer.  Sherman tanks from WW2 fired 75mm shells that would bounce off the front armor of German Tiger tanks. The Americans knew exactly what they were going up against and still sent these inferior tanks against the Germans. Why didn't Starfleet use Vulcan technology? Quite literally because the Vulcans didn't let them. It is well known that the Vulcans held the Humans back as much as they could because they saw us as reckless and impulsive children.  Just because a system is under development doesn't mean that it's ready. It also doesn't mean that the original design of the ship was made to accommodate a weapon system that hadn't been imagined yet. If the NX-01's design was finalized and construction began, and then a new weapon system gets pushed into development, the NX-01's design while under construction doesn't get changed. Can you imagine what would happen if only half the construction team got the new blueprints? Or if anyone was even a little confused? They would, however, modify the next ship in the line. As you said, the NX-02 had dorsal photonic torpedo launchers. As for the situation of finding themselves unprepared and unable to recall all of their ships... well, that would actually never happen anyway. No faction would ever recall all of their ships at once unless it was a last stand/last ditch effort. They absolutely would send out munitions to the front lines. What do you think happens in our wars right now?  Warp Core: The NX-01 was not only an experimental ship, it was the first of it's class in experimental ships. The engine and fuel were never designed to be dumped probably because the technology needed to safely dump the core hadn't been invented/perfected yet and dumping antimatter would be like dumping gasoline into fire. Antimatter has to be held in a very controlled magnetic field. It will literally react with any matter it touches. Dumping a pod could (and probably would) disrupt the delicate balance that keeps the pods themselves from exploding on the ship. Dumping pods full of antimatter is probably just as bad as dumping the core itself.   Launch Bay: Hatches are standardized among the races you would have come in contact with. Why would we know what hatch configuration an alien race uses that isn't a Federation race? Even the USA and the Soviets didn't standardized docking hatches until they had to with the Apollo-Soyuz projects. Having a ship match speeds with a mother ship and control arm is how air-to-air refueling is done. There really isn't a better way to do it unless you have a tractor beam, which they didn't. Also, where in the NX's design did they have room for a hanger?  Deck Layout:  The Enterprise D had the captain's quarters on deck 8. Voyager's was on deck 3. It doesn't seem to matter where the captain is as long as he can give orders over comms. Also, there's always an acting captain on the bridge. While it's optimal to have the actual captain on deck, the acting captain would retain command and give orders until the actual captain or first officer arrived.  Conclusion: The NX-01 was the test ship. Literally everything about it was experimental."
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,Chaff5,3,Thu Jul 16 05:07:19 2015 UTC,"It's also been speculated that the NX-01 was the first starship to be fitted with an antimatter reactor. So it's probable that the general design philosophy at the time was based on the assumption that safer fusion reactors would be used, and the placement of the engine room would reflect this."

I may be totally wrong about this, but if that's the case, there's a good chance they didn't have photon torpedoes in development and the technology was possibly acquired or traded for at a later date."
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,bowserusc,13,Wed Jul 15 23:34:45 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, photonic torpedoes were gained in a technology exchange one episode - Starfleet didn't invent them."
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,SpocksBrainLLAP,13,Wed Jul 15 23:47:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The NX-01 didn't leave spacedock with torpedoes. It didn't even have working phasers when it left, althought it did have phasers installed.    For the torpedo launchers they were fitted to only fire spatial torpedoes and not any future weapon Starfleet might develop.   I don't really know how you can build a ship around technology that doesn't exist yet to your people. Basically you're saying they should have had a system in place to be able to swap out spatial torpedoes with photon torpedoes, but Starfleet had no knowledge of them at the launch of it's first warp 5 ship."

Basically you're saying they should have had a system in place to be able to swap out spatial torpedoes with photon torpedoes, but Starfleet had no knowledge of them at the launch of it's first warp 5 ship.    That is actually not that crazy.  This is the 21"" torpedo tube MK 32-39 designed in 1931. It could fire the MK 10 torpedo designed in 1915. Normally it fired the MK 14 torpedo designed in 1931 or MK 18 torpedoes designed in 1943. It could also fire MK 27 homing torpedoes designed in 1943 (which were a different caliber originally designed for aircraft use!) With modifications it could fire the MK 37 torpedo designed in 1956 or the MK 45 ASTOR nuclear torpedo designed in 1958. Some have been fitted to fire the AEG SUT or SST-4 'Seal' torpedoes built in Germany in 1967 and 1975 respectively.  Now either the designers at the Electric Boat Company are wizards or they realized that standardized weapons system are very useful and that having a launch tube long and wide enough to be capable of handling several types of weapons including ones not yet invented would be a very good selling point. Given that submarines equipped with the MK 32-39 torpedo tube last saw combat in 1982 and are actually still in service in one navy I think the designers over at Electric Boat might have had the right idea."
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,williams_482,17,Thu Jul 16 01:14:33 2015 UTC,"It would seem to me that the designers of the NX class armory made a reasonable but inaccurate assumption that future torpedoes would be very similar in shape to the current spatial torpedoes, an assumption that the submarine designers probably made as well. The fact that photon torpedoes turned out to be built more like coffins than missiles certainly didn't help the transition.   All in all, the way I see it there are a couple of possible options here, submitted without comment:    The people who designed the torpedo launchers had no idea that photon torpedoes would be so radically different The people who designed the torpedo launchers did know what photon torpedoes would look like, but they were too stupid to design a flexible launching system The people who designed the torpedo launchers did know what photon torpedoes would look like, but decided that designing the tubes to be loaded from one of two places (one designed for photons, the other designed for spatial torpedoes) was the best solution to ensure a seamless transition   Unless I left something out, take your pick."
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,roflbbq,9,Thu Jul 16 01:28:48 2015 UTC,"That's a good write up, and I'm not sure I can retort with such good standard, but let me attempt to further my point. The way I see it, spatial torpedoes and photon torpedoes, while sharing the name torpedo, are different tech. Different sizes, mechanisms to make them work, warheads, etc. Different weapons with different designs because they utilize different technology. Your example is great, but to me, it falls apart because of this. Certainly there is something to be said about standardized weapons, but asking for a weapon system designed for spatial torpedoes to be compatible with photon torpedoes seems more like asking a musket to be compatible with rifled bullets, and in this case before rifled bullets were invented."
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,Taurik,5,Thu Jul 16 01:38:50 2015 UTC,That's a good point.  It would be like expecting a grenade launcher to also be able to fire rocket propelled grenades.  It's entirely different technology that shares a similar name.
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,Chaff5,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:15:35 2015 UTC,"While spatial and photonic torpedoes might be quite different they are both projectiles launched by a electromagnetic accelerator, this is apparent since both weapons are fired from the same launch tubes- they just utilize a separate breach and magazine. Quite possibly the separate breach mechanism is to incorporate the system for loading of the antideuterium.  Both weapons are all-up rounds, the launcher doesn't assemble or configure the weapons aside from loading photonic torpedoes with their antideuterium. Aside from data inputs once the weapon is loaded in the tube the launcher doesn't care if its a spatial or photonic torpedo, its launched the same way.  If Starfleet built their launchers with a larger bore, even if its not specifically to fit photonic torpedoes- just a larger weapon in general the amount of modifications they would need to be made to accommodate a future torpedo weapon would be significantly reduced; if the future weapon was simply a larger spatial torpedo the amount of modifications needed would be zero."
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,butterhoscotch,4,Fri Jul 17 00:35:32 2015 UTC,"Future weapons and ammunition (torpedoes are closer to ammunition than weapon systems) matching is more the case that the ammunition stayed in line with the firing system or that firing systems stayed in line with ammunition. Starfleet probably thought that the torpedoes would stay the same size while improving. When they didn't, the firing systems in the ships would have to be overhauled.  You said it yourself when you mentioned the standardized weapon system being useful. The Federation was brand new at the time and standardization probably didn't happen yet. More likely, they discovered that photon torpedoes were most effective (and allowed for future improvements without losing standardization) when they were made into a certain shape and size (like what we see now). Once they realized this, they couldn't knowingly continue using an inferior torpedo system and phased the older stuff out."
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,wlpaul4,2,Thu Jul 16 04:05:24 2015 UTC,"New navy ships are built with the ability to mount railguns, even though we dont have railguns yet."
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,wlpaul4,2,Thu Jul 16 06:39:51 2015 UTC,"I don't know if your torpedo argument holds. Torpedo tubes are generally just that: tubes. On the whole, they really don't play much of a roll in the kill chain besides making sure that the torpedo get on its way.  Assuming that you're right, the counter would be the story of the first five Ticonderoga-class cruisers. The Ticonderogas were (and still are) revolutionary ships and very powerful surface combatants. However, the first five were built with Mk. 26 missile launchers instead of Mk 41 VLS launchers and were decommissioned after only 20 years. The Mk 26 couldn't accommodate the longer SM-2ER missiles and that was a key factor in their early decommissioning. It's worth noting that the first VLS ship was actually laid down before the last Mk 26 ship, and that nearly every guided missile destroyer or frigate built in the last 25 years uses some variation on a VLS system.  Sometimes you just don't know what's coming with a technology change."
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,pwn3r0fn00b5,2,Fri Jul 17 04:19:13 2015 UTC,"Submarine torpedo tubes 'impulse' (push) the torpedo out of the boat, while it doesn't do nearly as much for the velocity of the weapon it does serve roughly the same purpose as the torpedo launchers of a Starfleet vessel: it gets the weapon clear of the ship and to a sufficient velocity for it's on-board propulsion to function.  Interesting thing about the Ticos; the ""superior"" VLS armed ships couldn't carry ASROCS till 1993 while the MK 26 armed ships could from day one. So the VLS ships went to sea with one less weapon in its arsenal.  There actually wasn't a technical reason the early Ticos couldn't receive a VLS system in a refit, the Spruance class did and that was built on the same hull. It was just deemed too expensive to do it."
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,mistakenotmy,2,Fri Jul 17 05:25:33 2015 UTC,"The only thing spatial & photonic torpedoes have in common is the word torpedo. Maybe I didn't phrase it the best, but I think that where your comparison fails is that the tubes you find on submarines are all essentially designed to launch the same weapon whereas spatial torpedoes and photonic torpedoes are completely different systems.  Actually, the VLS ships could also carry one additional type of missile that the Mk 26 ships couldn't. It's really ironic that you'd forget that, because your handle references the missile.   I don't know if the Spru-cans really have much of a place in the discussion. The Kidd-subclass had the Mk 26 launchers and they still have them after being sold to Taiwan. The Spruance class had an ASROC launcher where they had VLS cells. Perhaps there was so much trouble converting those ships that the USN decided they didn't even want to mess with a Mk 26 refit."
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,Sly_Lupin,3,Fri Jul 17 17:15:05 2015 UTC,The NX did have torpedo at launch they just were not proton torpedoes. At the end of season 2 the Enterprise gets a refit before going into the expanse and I believe one of the upgrades was proton torpedoes.

DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,wlpaul4,11,Thu Jul 16 06:38:51 2015 UTC,It does seem like a short period of time but sometimes this happens when technology advances very quickly. In the early 1900's some battleships were made obsolete before they were even completed by HMS Dreadnought. Perhaps breaking warp 7 did the same thing to the NX class.
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,InconsiderateBastard,3,Thu Jul 16 01:16:39 2015 UTC,"Bringing up the Dreadnought, if memory serves that ship was only comissioned for 13 years before being decommissioned and scrapped."

One answer might be that 2161 was the year the Federation began, Earth could now count on military support from the Vulcans, Andorians and Tellarites.   I think these two factors are important.  Ships at war undergo tremendous wear and tear.  I believe within 1 1/2 years of the end of WW2, 18 aircraft carriers went out of commission.  Most were put back into commission though.  That's where the Federation comes in.  If this is around the time of the birth of the Federation it would also be a time of tremendous technology sharing.  Possibly the single greatest influx of technology Earth had ever known.    If you have a ship that's been put through its paces during a recently ended war and you're looking at this great big pile of new technology trying to figure out how to cram it all into a ship that wasn't designed for it, the natural decision may be to mothball it and start new."
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,butterhoscotch,7,Thu Jul 16 01:57:59 2015 UTC,"I believe within 1 1/2 years of the end of WW2, 18 aircraft carriers went out of commission. Most were put back into commission though.   I believe they were taken out of service as the Essex class carriers had straight angled decks and were designed for propeller aircraft. Post-war naval aviation saw the development of jet aircraft. Certain carriers were gutted and new equipment added, notably the angled deck.  Here's a photo gallery on how an Essex class carrier was updated in the 1950's:  http://imgur.com/a/l7gTB/layout/blog"
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,HowdyDoodlyDoo,2,Thu Jul 16 02:24:18 2015 UTC,"After all of that retrofitting it seems like it'd have been cheaper and faster to just build a new carrier from scratch. Steel is steel. Steel can be easily recycled into a new ship. Break down the old ship into scrap metal, feed it into a smelter for recycling, and build a new ship.  The new ship would also be better than the old ship since they can be built from the ground up with new technology in mind."
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,JRV556,4,Thu Jul 16 03:44:34 2015 UTC,"For the most part, the retrofitting was just changing the flight deck and associated systems. The hulls remained basically the same.  While it's probably not 100% on the numbers, they basically only had to pay for half of a new ship, instead of an entire new ship for the retrofitting."
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,LonelyNixon,2,Thu Jul 16 04:25:47 2015 UTC,"I think whats important about these factors is that they will be sharing technology allowing them to build new ship designs. Shields, warp 7 engines. Earth will be doing quite well for themselves."
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,Blue387,3,Thu Jul 16 06:44:06 2015 UTC,Not to mention that they would have been sharing before that. The signing was probably more of a formality - it wouldn't surprise me if they had a new joint flagship to launch.
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,Hyndis,8,Thu Jul 16 10:02:51 2015 UTC,"You make a lot of very good points, but while 10 years is a short time for the NX-01 to be in service, we don't really know why it was decommissioned. As you said, it was just after the end of the Romulan War, so maybe it had been damaged enough that it was more resource effective to decommission it rather than extensively repair it. The gap between the end of the war and it's actual decommissioning could just be due to delays in either getting the ship back to Earth.   I know that the novels are non-canon, but that's pretty much how it happens in the ENT relaunch (though technically you only specified that as far as this post is concerned the refit design is non canon haha). Enterprise was leading the fleet at the Battle of Cheron and the Romulan forces damaged the ship's spaceframe so badly that Starfleet decided to decommission it and convert it into a museum. This was before the NX class refit (which was called the Columbia class in the books)."
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,Antal_Marius,4,Thu Jul 16 01:23:33 2015 UTC,There weren't a lot of nx class ships made either in the book. The nx class was too complex and difficult to build so the Federation wound up relying on a modified version of the outdated Daedalus design which they were able to mass produce.   The result was that not only did the nx class ships become obsolete but by the end of the war the Federation had a sizable fleet that had few nx ships in it. By 10 years later after all these discoveries it wasn't worth the effort to build more nx ships instead more advanced joint Federation models.
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,HowdyDoodlyDoo,6,Thu Jul 16 15:47:44 2015 UTC,The NX class had polarized hull plates instead of deflector shields for defense. Could the lack of shield technology (or ability to retrofit shield technology) have led to the early retirement of the entire class?
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,Antal_Marius,7,Thu Jul 16 00:10:34 2015 UTC,"The discovery/purchase of shield technology was just one of many new technologies during the decade the NX were in service.  Before the NX-01 launch, photon torpedoes, shields, and phaser banks were technologies unknown to Earth. Hull plating was the only defensive system available. Energy and missile weapons were the best they had, yet still laughably primitive compared to pretty much every other civilization out there. This ship was also limited to warp 5. Warp 5 was cutting edge tech at the time for Earth, but it was slow compared to other civilizations.  The NX-01 was built with the best technology available at the time. During the NX-01's voyages it found all manner of new technology completely unknown to engineers on Earth. (I'm sure Vulcan was fully aware of these technologies the Vulcan High Command refused to share a great deal of information with Earth.) These new techs were found through a mixture of exploration and diplomacy.  The NX-01 made itself obsolete. This ship was so successful at obtaining access to new technologies that by completing its mission it had made its entire class obsolete.  There just too many new technologies discovered in such a short period of time that retrofitting them onto an existing hull wasn't cost effective. A new hull had to be built, designed from the ground up to accommodate these new technologies. Shields were just one tech that the NX class wasn't built for. The ship had no place for shield generators. In addition to this, their energy weapons had to be replaced. Their projectile launchers had to be replaced. Their warp core and nacelles had to be replaced as the warp 5 engine became obsolete, replaced by faster engines.  Its just easier and faster to build a new ship than to try to continue to breathe life into a ship that is, a mere 10 years after its launch, woefully obsolete.  Its not a bad thing. This just means that Earth's shipbuilding had advanced extremely rapidly. Earth's engineers and scientists were discovering things at a pace that had frightened the Vulcan High Command."

DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,ZombieHoratioAlger,5,Thu Jul 16 03:28:30 2015 UTC,"You've got a lot of good points. It isn't the smartest or most forward thinking design. The Vulcans were discouraging Starfleet's exploration mission, and perhaps because they saw the NX-01 and thought ""Shit, that's the best they can do?"" At the same time, they weren't exactly generous with technology either, and were willing to watch humanity screw up and hope we'd learn our lesson and come back home. Result: Starfleet isn't ready for what's out there, but we're going anyway.  Unforseen consequence: a technological renaissance perhaps? There is an exponential increase in exposure to new civilizations and technology. Starfleet engineers are getting reports about how Enterprise got its ass kicked this week and are driven to find new solutions. These advances could have outpaced what was capable of being retrofitted into the NX class and led to her early demise."
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,Stelith61,6,Thu Jul 16 05:23:02 2015 UTC,"In the ENT+ novels, the NX and Intrepid classes are phased out of production because they're too expensive in wartime, and have other issues. The first Federation explorer class ends up being the Columbia-class, which you may recognize as the NX-refit. The Columbia redesign presumably fixes all or most of the NX's design flaws.  Outside of the Litverse, I see the NX as similar to the USAF's eary supersonic aircraft. They were advanced enough to be worth building in large numbers, but technology was outpacing them quickly enough that they weren't in use for very long. IE the F-86 or F-80, both of which were cutting-edge fighters, becoming obsolete in just a few years (whereas modern fighters have lifespans of 30+ years)."
DaystromInstitute,3dfu6m,Stormflux,3,Thu Jul 16 06:20:17 2015 UTC,"You noted that replacing the warp reactor on the NX would necessitate cutting a hole in the hull.  There is prescident for this.

One of the things we learned is that we probably shouldn't have built this one.""  I think that may also apply to the NX class, but it doesn't mean that with the NX class or the ISS are failures. Especially in light of the fact that both represent news steps into uncharted territory. Not every step into new territory is a successful one, but it's only a failure when you don't learn lessons from a misstep."

Possibly, the guidance and proximity fuse were inactive for the test, to be turned back on once the error on the ship systems had been measured and adjusted-for.

DaystromInstitute,3dgqx3,fleshrott,19,Thu Jul 16 03:34:39 2015 UTC,"Lets look at how the weapons differ:  Range:  A Photon torpedo has a range of 3.5 million kilometers.  Longer if you accept a degradation in yield (some reactants get used for propulsion).  Where phasers have a maximum effective range of 300,000 km, or about 10x less.  Yield: A photon torpedo is a M/AM anhilation.  M/AM will always release a lot of energy.  Basically it is harder to adjust the yield down beyond a certain limit on a photon torpedo.  Phasers can have different settings.  Maybe you want a full power shot for maximum damage.  Sometimes though a lower setting just to disable but not cause to much damage is better, i.e. a more surgical touch.  Aim: Phasers can be aimed more precisely, combined with a better variable yield they can be used in situations where the ""big stick"" of a photon is impractical.  Environment: Photon Torpedoes can be used at warp speed. Phasers can not.  (I know there are oddball exceptions but I am beginning to think there are exceptions to everything in Trek)  Munitions: The ship has to carry photon torpedo casings.  They are expendable and the ship could run out during a battle.  Phasers do not suffer from that (well wear on the emitters but with over 200 on the saucer arrays, you have a few.)  The success or failure of any engagement can depend on how well a ship uses its resources.  So choosing the correct weapon for the need at hand is important.  I would probably not use a photon torpedo to disable a particular component on an enemy ship. If I am at warp, I am going to be using torpedoes.  If I want to deal out max damage, well I am going to use everything."

DaystromInstitute,3dgqx3,DefiantLoveLetter,5,Thu Jul 16 12:31:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it should not be cited anymore. There's just too many instances of phasers being effectively used at warp that any dialogue to it not being allowed should be taken lightly. Perhaps they can't be used as HIGH warp speeds?"
DaystromInstitute,3dgqx3,williams_482,2,Thu Jul 16 16:49:39 2015 UTC,"In Enterprise, Reed mentions it as a temporary issue which he was working to correct shortly after they installed the phase cannons. If memory serves they used the phase cannons while at warp a couple episodes after that, so it seems reasonable to assume they figured it out.   Was there another mention of phasers not working at warp?"
DaystromInstitute,3dgqx3,mistakenotmy,2,Thu Jul 16 19:20:04 2015 UTC,"Well phasers are light speed weapons (or slower if you go by on-screen VFX).  So shooting one at warp is going to cause issues as the ship is moving faster than the weapon.  Now, it could be possible to extend a warp field to allow for the phaser beam to stay FTL with the attacking ship, maybe.  That explanation works for one or two of the discrepancies.  There are really only a few inconsistencies with phasers working at warp.  On this issue I feel it is one of those we should disregard as production mistakes (things like VFX miscommunication or maybe even plot needs).  Kind of like how warp sometimes moves at the speed of plot.  Others may see it different."
DaystromInstitute,3dgqx3,uptotwentycharacters,2,Thu Jul 16 21:39:01 2015 UTC,"The main difficulty with firing phasers at warp speed is that the phaser beam travels at the speed of light, so it would have a hard time hitting a ship which is traveling at warp speed (unless it's directly behind). But when two ships are close enough, their warp bubbles overlap so the phaser beam travels with them, so it can be used just like when traveling at impulse speed."
DaystromInstitute,3dgqx3,LaserSailor760,14,Thu Jul 16 23:08:01 2015 UTC,My understanding was that torpedoes do massive damage but have a harder time penetrating shields. Phasers do less damage but are better against shields.

DaystromInstitute,3dgqx3,JC-Ice,2,Thu Jul 16 17:24:49 2015 UTC,"The matter/antimatter reaction occurs within the torpedo warhead, effectively making it a very powerful nuke, but the energy release won't magically vaporize just anything.  The Enterprise D did fire raw antimatter at the Borg cube in The Best of Both Worlds pt 2, but it appeared to be stopped by the shields. It was only intended as a diversion, anyway. Phasers (and disruptors) do have a 'magical' vaporization effect against solid matter, but it varies with type of material being struck.  IIRC, titanium (or tritanium) was mentioned on VOY to have good phaser resistant properties, which is why it's commonly used to build starships."

Off the top of my head...   TWOK: As /u/JC-Ice points out, all hits shown occur without shields. Enterprise is crippled by phasers alone, and both phasers and torpedoes seem to do similar damage when directed at Reliant's saucer. TSFS: A single torpedo destroys Grissom, true, but we're not sure if they had shields up or not. Shields were down on both the Enterprise and Bird of Prey when hit with torpedoes, and they were both heavily damaged. TUC: The cloaked Bird of Prey pummels the Enterprise with torpedoes, which appear to smash through the hull despite shields. It takes many torpedoes to destroy the cloaked, shieldless Bird of Prey. TNG: ""Yesterday's Enterprise"": A Klingon ship is destroyed with a single phaser blast. GEN: Enterprise's shield are up but effectively bypassed and hit by torpedoes. The Bird of Prey is forced to cloak, dropping its shields moments before being destroyed by one torpedo. VOY: ""Message in a Bottle"": The Prometheus and Bonchune exchange phaser fire at warp, and the latter withdraws after suffering damage. A Romulan ship is destroyed by the Prometheus using only phasers. In both cases the vaunted  ""multi-vector assault mode"" is in play, so, you know ... multiple phasers."

Perhaps TNG torpedoes have a greater yield than they did in TOS times.  So even though it took several torpedoes to destroy a ship from Kirk's time, those same ships were much more vulnerable to modern torpedoes.    I dunno.

(And for Khan to be able to gloat over Kirk)    and both phasers and torpedoes seem to do similar damage when directed at Reliant's saucer.   I disagree here.  Two torpedoes are visibly devastating to the Reliant's hull, doing more apparent damage than any individual phaser burst did anywhere in the movie.

But by the time the Dominion was created and portrayed, previous series such as TOS and TNG had already created other species who relied on slavery, before the concepts of cloning and genetic engineering really entered the mainstream consciousness.  So Star Trek did try to tackle that idea, it just took until DS9 and the Dominion to do so.

The message of these Jem'Hadar plots is clear: sentient beings remain sentient regardless of their temperament, and that means they are not fully predictable or controllable.  There's also a clear reason that the Dominion is the only power we see to use cloning on a large scale -- namely, the Founders are super, super paranoid. The only ""solid"" species they feel they can trust are ones they basically created and shaped themselves. Common sense dictates that large-scale cloning is going to be incredibly resource-intensive, especially when you factor in the short lifespan of Jem'Hadar. The technology necessary to kidnap people, by contrast, is relatively simple and widely available.

While it's possible to genetically manipulate, engineer, and/or evolve FTL travel (e.g., Tin Man), there's no obvious dependency by high energy systems, singularities, or space-folding that depends on the ability to copy and paste DNA among cell nuclei.  There are certainly technologies that can help in both, like the ability to finely position molecular structures according to pre-set designs, but the ability to replicate e.g. microchips does not imply the ability to replicate DNA.

If this was our universe I'd agree with you, but in the Star Trek universe it has been pretty well established that even humanity (which, relatively speaking was a pre-warp backwater until the late 21st Century) had a pretty firm control over genetic engineering, far beyond what we can currently (or willingly) do IRL. One need look no further than the Eugenics Wars of the supposed 90s!  Even in the 22nd Century, Flox spoke of how some species use genetic engineering to better themselves, though he admitted not as extensive as humanity attempted.

It's not just acting -- much credit must be given to the writers -- but I am hard pressed to think of a character that is better portrayed than Garak and I attribute a great deal of that to the depth of thought Andy Robinson put into so thoroughly fleshing out the character (as especially evidenced by A Stitch In Time).  To your point about acting style, Star Trek often feels like a curious hybrid of stage or -- and I don't mean this in a demeaning way -- soap opera style. It's theatrical, it's staged, it's very much unlike what we might think ""real people"" would do, but in its own way takes on a heightened reality as a consequence. This description applies to every series, even Enterprise, and I think must at least in part be a deliberate stylistic decision by those involved in making the shows rather than a product of the show's era of TV; TNG through to ENT all have a very similar acting style, despite the respective first and last episodes airing nearly twenty years apart.

But I think the stars of all of Star Trek, are really Stewart in number one, Brent Spiner as Data in number two and Michael Dorn as Worf.  If you look at the number of episodes they got and much they got into their roles, it really transformed the show.  I really couldn't decide between Stewart or Spiner, they are both at the top.   And then you have Spock and others.  And Dorn did a good job as well, I really believed he was a Worf character.  And if you look at Star Trek TNG, DS9, etc, you have characters like Riker, who did an OK job but I saw the actor behind Riker.   It seemed like Jonathan Frakes was playing this guy named Riker.  Like he couldn't wait for his next acting job.  It wasn't bad, I just didn't find him as believable.   And maybe it was the role of First Officer, that role seemed to just take orders for the Captain and pass them on.  With Stewart, I felt like he was Captain Picard, it was just well done, I didn't seem him acting.    Deanna, was kind of just OK, no stand out performance here.  Beverly Crusher was a great role, I can't really say anything bad about this doctor, I don't think the actress got a chance to outshine a Data or Picard.  ...    Picard is tops for me, but I thought Spiner and Data was pretty amazing.   If you watch the show ever, just watch Data in the background, Spiner always gave him that robotic style that was hilarious and slightly brilliant.   I can't remember the episode but Data is playing a violin or some other instrument and it looks like a robot pretending to be a master violinist, it is just too awesome, even with the fake facial expressions and fake conducting."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,berlinbrown,4,Wed Jul 15 23:59:20 2015 UTC,"I met Andy Robinson and even though I'm a huge fan of Garak I went off at him about ""how great it was that time you played 3 characters in the same episode."" Oops... that was Jeffry Combs (the actor who played Weyoun). He acted like he knew what I was talking about and smiled and nodded a bunch.  I met Chase Masterson the same day, boy is she beautiful, but hah... Lita... what a shallow character. Those two characters are like total opposites when it comes to potential to show off acting skills.  Captain Garak is the show I really want to watch."

DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,ACAFWD,3,Wed Jul 15 22:39:07 2015 UTC,"The only episode I can think of is ""DS9: The Dogs of War"" where Combs plays both Weyoun and Brunt in the same episode."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,BonzoTheBoss,2,Thu Jul 16 10:59:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right, so even if I'd said the same thing to Combs I still would have been wrong. Oh dear."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,StarGangCo,83,Thu Jul 16 11:03:24 2015 UTC,"It may be almost cliche to say, but Patrick Stewart and Brent Spiner may be the two best actors in the entire franchise.  I was just watching Sarek, in which Picard willing mind melds with Sarek to give Sarek the emotional control he needs at a critical moment. The flip side of this deal is Picard taking an onslaught of emotions. There is a fantastic scene by Stewart here where he's experiencing every single emotion at the same time.  Offscreen, Spiner is something of a goofball. Only a goofball could have played Data so straight. Zeppo Marx couldn't have played Data any straighter."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,frezik,22,Wed Jul 15 14:44:45 2015 UTC,"Particularly in the first 2 seasons, the degree to which Stewart turns truly awful stuff written for him into something that sounds like a human might say is breathtaking."

DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,PathToEternity,6,Wed Jul 15 18:21:09 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, the American accent (as it is understood today) is actually the older accent. The British accent drifted away and became unique because it was a deliberate attempt to sound cooler.   As a result, Americans can't helped but be tricked into thinking anyone with a British accent is intelligent and sophisticated, when they might be average or even below average (Niall Ferguson is culprit #1 in my mind)."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,PENIS_OBESE,4,Wed Jul 15 21:16:44 2015 UTC,That's actually the Southern accent that's the older one.   1700s British sounded like a Georgian drawl.

DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,PENIS_OBESE,4,Thu Jul 16 00:59:59 2015 UTC,ive heard this before.   There are many British accents which have a Rhotic R. There are non Rhotic American variations. The Rhotic R isnt the only aspect that makes the range of American accents different from the range of British accents.
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,royal_oui,20,Thu Jul 16 01:22:18 2015 UTC,Agreed on the Sarek scene. It could come off as painfully overwrought in the hands of a less capable actor.
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,CaptTenacity,24,Wed Jul 15 15:36:07 2015 UTC,That scene is perfect for a classically trained Shakespearean actor. I don't think anyone without that background could have done it.

DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,BonzoTheBoss,8,Thu Jul 16 11:02:17 2015 UTC,"To me that scene has always come off as painfully over the top. I'm surprised to see it here as an example of Stewart's skill; I've always thought of it as an unfortunate, cringe-inducing aberration in his portrayal of Picard."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,bread_buddy,3,Wed Jul 15 19:07:22 2015 UTC,"Hmm, watching it out of context it doesn't seem very sincere. The dialogue is rubbish though. Pretty hard to act around."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Asiriya,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:04:37 2015 UTC,Compare it to Puck's Soliloquy or anything from Hamlet and it really brings out Stewart's Shakespeare history.

Zeppo Marx couldn't have played Data any straighter.   I was always impressed with the TNG cast's ability to keep straight faces during absurd and moving scenes alike. I'm especially fond of Worf and Riker's ability to do so, although the Data scenes are a given."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,metakepone,8,Wed Jul 15 16:12:13 2015 UTC,Somewhere there's an interview of some of the TNG cast saying they'd laugh about the scenes while practicing them before going in front of the camera. That might have helped them out a bit.
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Antal_Marius,3,Wed Jul 15 17:57:57 2015 UTC,"Worf, to be fair, never smiled. How did Michael Dorn avoid smiling for eleven years?"
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,philwelch,3,Thu Jul 16 03:10:16 2015 UTC,"But he did, not often but he did. And if you watch the blooper footage Dorn seems to be the worst culprit when it came to corpsing."

DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,exatron,8,Wed Jul 15 16:27:54 2015 UTC,"No, a quick glance at his Wikipedia page shows he did parts in some Broadways plays and bit parts on some sitcoms (unless that's what you meant) before he did Star Trek.  That's actually something I think is pretty smart on the side of the Star Trek producers. They like to pick unknown actors off the theatre circuit. You don't have the celebrity baggage of Captain Robert Downey Jr. but you can still be sure they can actually act."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,rliant1864,2,Wed Jul 15 16:55:19 2015 UTC,"You can see my last post, but I liked Data, Picard and Worf.   I thought Dorn did a good job with that character.  Yea, it is easy to play tough warrior types, but Dorn got so into the role, he should be recognized for his work."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,berlinbrown,37,Thu Jul 16 00:02:14 2015 UTC,"In addition to what has already been said by other contributors (Steward, Spiner, Robinson)...  Rene Auberjonois and Armin Shimerman I think are both very good. I think they hit a good balance of being 'alien' and yet not distractingly so. And they take characters that you probably shouldn't like and make you fall in love with them.  I also think Jeri Ryan, Robert Picardo, and Roxann Dawson are good. I always like to listen to them talk as themselves, because their voices are completely different than their characters. They all naturally speak in a higher pitch and the respective character, but it doesn't sound forced when, for example, B'Elanna talks. It's not like Quark or Neelix where you know they don't actually sound like that. I would also argue that none of them have a bad episode, which has something to just do with luck... However, I think each of them have an episode or two that could have been terrible if they weren't a strong enough actor. I mean, Roxann spent her first three episodes acting against herself or a robot and her fourth one is a crazy love/holocaust story where she wasn't even B'Elanna."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Sareki,10,Wed Jul 15 15:03:43 2015 UTC,"I saw/heard Rene Auberjonois at the final Galaxy Ball in 2001 (a charity function begun by Robert Beltran of Voyager).  What a gentleman!  Cast members from each show spoke and answered questions.    One of the questioners was mentally handicapped--he asked Auberjonois if it hurt when he shape-shifted.  Obviously, this person's understanding of the distinction between reality and fantasy was a bit limited.  Auberjonois very calmly sat at the edge of the stage and explained that, first, this was a television show and all of that was make up, etc....  He didn't show any discomfort (unlike Stewart, who must have been surprised by a questioner's understanding, as his answer was more joking and went over the poor guy's head) and was so gentle in his response.  I will always be a fan of the man who handled something unexpected with such graciousness.  A complete class act."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Callmedory,7,Wed Jul 15 22:54:33 2015 UTC,"I wish they hadn't paired her with Paris, that was painful to watch. A lack of chemistry between the actors? Or maybe I'm alone feeling this?"
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,StarGangCo,5,Wed Jul 15 18:23:19 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to respectfully disagree. I love her with Paris. I think they are a nice 'ying and yang' couple... but with a lot in common, particularly in the realm of issues with parents are a rough past. I personally find them to be the most believable couple that Trek ever gave us. But I think it can be a personal taste issue.  I think the actors have good chemistry, especially in Blood Fever but I will agree that they go through a rocky period in the fourth season. The worst of it is really Vis a Vis. I put a lot of the 'problems' on a combination of Robbie and Roxann trying to get used to the change and then Roxann's pregnancy."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Sareki,4,Wed Jul 15 18:34:11 2015 UTC,"I kind of feel like the problem with that relationship was that Paris was so two-dimensional and static. I did struggle to watch the whole series, so maybe I missed some growth there, but I was never impressed with the way the character was written."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,TiVO25,9,Wed Jul 15 18:52:30 2015 UTC,"I'm glad someone brought Roxann Dawson up. Her early performance in ""Faces"" kept me hooked.    They all naturally speak in a higher pitch and the respective character, but it doesn't sound forced when, for example, B'Elanna talks.   I was really impressed by her eye for detail in the ""Faces"" episode; she talks like vulnerable damsel in distress B'Elana as a human, but she goes all out as, Worf's-fantasy-heavy-object-thrower Klingon B'Elanna. Then, for the rest of the series, shes got the slight Klingon accent and aggression for normal B'Elanna. Proves she put a lot of thought into the character, at least from what I observed."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,metakepone,5,Wed Jul 15 16:06:45 2015 UTC,"Well, I could pretty much fangirl about Roxann all day. I love interviews where she talks about B'Elanna, because you can really see the thought that she put into the character. For example, when she got the role, she knew nothing about Star Trek. So she got every episode with Klingon in it from the studio and got the Star Trek Encyclopedia and started reading it. I also like when she talks about her process for Faces. She had to separate scrips for each version of B'Elanna and really tried to make them two parts of a whole... which is even more amazing when you think about how this was her first big episode! Another thing I appreciate was how she differentiated Brigitte in The Killing Game from B'Elanna. Her tone is different, and in general she is a softer character.  Alright, enough fangirling for now... But I do really feel she is underrated. Maybe not the best, but she was very good. And don't get me started on her directing or novel writing..."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Sareki,4,Wed Jul 15 16:55:09 2015 UTC,"Don't know anything about her novel writing or directing, but I think a captain b'ellana show would be better to watch than captain worf."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,metakepone,3,Wed Jul 15 17:24:22 2015 UTC,"I'd watch a Captain B'Elanna show for sure. Although I think Roxann is against ever putting the makeup on again.  As to her directing, check out her IMDB for details. Star Trek wise, she directed two VOY (Riddles, Workforce pt 2) and ten ENT (among them Dead Stop, where she is also the voice of the space station). Since Trek she has become a full time director/producer. Her credits include Lost, Treme, Agents of Shield, The Closer, Crossing Jordan...  She wrote a trilogy of sci fi novels in partnership with Daniel Graham about 10-15 years ago, Tenebrea Trilogy. They aren't bad, but I mostly like them because the main character is a lot like B'Elanna."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Sareki,2,Wed Jul 15 18:06:02 2015 UTC,Well if she's against putting on makeup again I'm at least happy she's directing popular shows.
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,metakepone,5,Wed Jul 15 18:33:11 2015 UTC,"I loved the Faces episode, but I am still annoyed that Klingon B'Elanna had to sacrifice herself to save Terran B'Elanna. Klingon B'Elanna was far more interesting that Terran B'Elanna. It's like~ minority character dies first or minority character = expendable character  trope. Because now you have another human character in the cast. Yeah, yeah, they 're-inject' her Klingoness back into her, but imho they weakened her character considerably. Also, why did she have to be a damsel in distress? There's plenty of other brave humans in Trek. <grumble>"
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Kamala_Metamorph,2,Wed Jul 15 22:17:50 2015 UTC,"B'Elanna is actually a 'damsel in distress' quite a bit. Prototype, Random Thoughts... My favorite is Muse, because she is the most active in her own rescue there. Not to mention that Muse is probably one of my favorite episodes of Voyager.  I actually really like Alice because it turns the 'damsel in distress' trope on it's head and makes Tom the damsel... and B'Elanna has to brave the chaos that is Tom Paris' mind to save him ;)"
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Sareki,30,Thu Jul 16 17:03:36 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be the one to step forward and give Avery Brooks some credit. He isn't necessarily a great actor, but he is a great Star Trek actor, in the overwrought Shatnerian sense where theatricality is emphasized over naturalism. He's just fun to watch.   I've always found Dukat to be the most compelling Star Trek villain, at least until the stupid pah'wraith arc, but the number one reason for that is Marc Alaimo. He makes a chilling and compelling portrayal of narcissism, and does it well enough to pull the viewer into his arrogant self-image for a good season or two before pulling the rug out."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,philwelch,21,Wed Jul 15 16:04:26 2015 UTC,"I think Brooks IS a great actor - but he's an unconventional actor who likes to make unexpected choices.  Just watch him in real life - he never does the most immediate, obvious thing.  He always goes in a different direction.    What makes an actor good or bad?  Well it's pretty easy to spot.  About 10 years ago there was some fan-made Star Trek show on the Internet that had CGI effects and all blue screen sets.  Obviously they had no budget, but still, the acting was TERRIBLE.  None of the character's emotions even matched the text, not to mention the subtext.  When you watch a bad actor, you don't think ""hmm, I guess he/she isn't great,"" you ACTUALLY say ""I want to f-ing kill myself.""  Bad acting is miserable to watch.    Everyone on Star Trek is good - they're all better than everyone at your local theatre.  It's just that some of them are world-class (Stewart, Picardo, Robinson, etc)."

DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,phtll,16,Wed Jul 15 20:06:48 2015 UTC,"Alaimo also believed, like some fans, that Dukat was not a villain (and hated how the writers explicitly took his character that way late in the show), and it gave the character a genuineness that may have been lacking otherwise. Which is how the best villains think of themselves; there are few people who are cartoonishly evil, but there are plenty of self-deluded monsters."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,frezik,7,Wed Jul 15 16:56:57 2015 UTC,"I always found Avery Brooks a mixed bag. When he has to do something intense and powerful, he does it brilliantly. When he's doing something more ordinary and mundane, he doesn't seem to make much of it. He has a tendency to bring a sort of disengaged and bored performance. It kind of fits for Sisko, and it's fine, but it's a little strange. Some episodes it seems like he doesn't even want to be there, other episodes he's carrying the whole thing. His comic timing is surprisingly great, though."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Portponky,5,Wed Jul 15 18:53:07 2015 UTC,"Man, if there's anything I remember of DS9 it's the Vic Fontaine stuff (so melancholy, was I breaking up with an ex then?) and Brooks' acting in 'In the Pale Moonlight' and 'Far Beyond the Stars' (which both have melancholy memories too, but then I did marathon the series). But those two episodes are so powerful to me, the titles so poetic, so hinge on Brooks delivering with sincerity, and boy does he.  He's not the best actor ever, he's not my favourite, but when I think DS9 I think Brooks and I'm very glad to have been able to watch him at work. I feel sad when I see he isn't popular."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Asiriya,2,Wed Jul 15 21:19:27 2015 UTC,"Imagine if you had to command an entire space station. Imagine if you lived Sisko's life. You would sound bored during the mundane parts, too."

DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Callmedory,3,Wed Jul 15 23:03:01 2015 UTC,I love that! It may be taking the 'slow and forceful is authoritative' thing too far but it works for me.
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Asiriya,16,Wed Jul 15 21:13:22 2015 UTC,"In a similar vein, I'd like to express my appreciation for Scott Bakula. Yes, it was a little odd and distracting to have such a well-known actor in that role, but by the end of the series, the writers had him carrying the entire show single-handedly. The hardest-working man in modern Star Trek, by far."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,bgcarlisle,31,Wed Jul 15 16:12:03 2015 UTC,"How is it that Jeffrey Combs and Louise Fletcher have not been mentioned so far?  Weyoun is so weird and creepy and slinky and perfect.  Kai Winn is the perfect nasty, backstabbing religious hypocrite."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Cyno01,17,Wed Jul 15 16:36:37 2015 UTC,Kai Winn was Dolores Umbridge before Dolores Umbridge.
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,IntergalacticTowel,10,Wed Jul 15 16:43:02 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Combs is one of my instant favorites. I watched Enterprise because he was in several episodes (and he ""made"" Andorians for me as the iconic Thy'lek Shran commanding the Kumari), and I loved Weyoun and Brunt on DS9. All of them very different characters, each brilliantly portrayed. Big fan.  And yes, Kai Winn was perfectly cast. Fletcher owned that role and made it so enjoyable to hate the character; every nuance was spot on for a religious hypocrite. So perfectly despicable."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,ChoiceD,8,Wed Jul 15 18:16:51 2015 UTC,"Have to agree on Louise Fletcher. If any actor can make you hate a character that much, then I would say they are doing a very good job."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Kamala_Metamorph,3,Wed Jul 15 19:44:26 2015 UTC,Came here to say Louise Fletcher. Look at how many people in this AskReddit poll still hold such strong emotional response to her character. It's especially impressive when you consider what a nice person she seems to be in real life.
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Blipblipblipblipskip,3,Wed Jul 15 22:32:01 2015 UTC,"Jeffrey Combs is one of my favorite recurring actors. Shran, Weyoun among a few others. I recently read that he almost got the role of Riker but Jonathan Frakes got it instead."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Portponky,18,Wed Jul 15 18:17:40 2015 UTC,"It's a fairly obvious choice, but I thought Harris Yulin's single appearance in the DS9 episode ""Duet"" absolutely nails it. He dominated that episode. I think his performance is pretty much the only stand-out thing about the entire first season."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,spockywocky,5,Wed Jul 15 15:16:57 2015 UTC,"I came here to say the same thing. Harris Yullin absolutely made that episode. Duet is by far my favorite episode of Trek (with perhaps The Siege of AR-558 as competition). Yullin makes the guilt feel 100% authentic, and he play such a great villain early on. My only gripe with the episode has to do with the ending, and that's not his fault in the slightest."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,PENIS_OBESE,2,Wed Jul 15 18:50:48 2015 UTC,That script is the only thing standing out in the first season.
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,unlimitedbacon,18,Wed Jul 15 21:23:53 2015 UTC,"Deforest Kelley. I have noticed that the various actors that have played McCoy in the fan made series have had the most trouble capturing that character. The new guy from Star Trek Continues has probably been doing the best so far, and Karl Urban has done a good job but nobody has really been able to fill those shoes."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,BigTaker,6,Wed Jul 15 16:35:17 2015 UTC,"Kelley was wonderful. His scene with his father in The Final Frontier is great.  You're bang on about the difficulty actors in the numerous fan productions have being Bones. Regarding Karl Urban, he's my favourite actor in the films, I just wish everything was a bit slower so he'd be given a bit more time to interact with Kirk and Spock."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,CypherWulf,17,Wed Jul 15 22:35:02 2015 UTC,"I'm going way out on a limb here i know, but Nicole De Boer as Ezri Dax played that part so well. I wish we had more than 1 season to get to know her.  I know a lot of people didn't like her, mostly because she wasn't Jadzia, but I thought she did a great job of showing the confusing transition a host must feel as she integrated with the symbiote. Towards the end of the season, she was gaining confidence, and realizing that she did not have to be overwhelmed by her past, and was starting to get in control of herself, her career and her social life. If Jadzia had died earlier, or the show ran a year or two more, I think she would have been one of the best liked characters and actresses in the series."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,TiVO25,3,Wed Jul 15 16:58:01 2015 UTC,I loved both that character and actress so much more than Ferrell and Jadzia.
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,GhostNULL,3,Wed Jul 15 19:14:25 2015 UTC,"I totally agree, when I finished DS9 I almost went looking for more seasons just because of her."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Hilomh,17,Wed Jul 15 19:15:28 2015 UTC,"David Odgen Stiers was one of the best guest stars in the entire franchise, in my opinion.  If you recall, he was the scientist that was from a planet that executes it's citizens when they turn 60.  He fell in love with Lwaxanna Troi and almost broke with his tradition until his daughter (Michelle Forbes) talked him back into it.  All 3 of them gave great performances, and it was the episode that finally sold me on Lwaxanna.  She (the character, not the actress) is so over the top sometimes, it can be grating.  But make no mistake - Majel Barrett was tremendously talented and absolutely a pillar of Star Trek.  Also, I want to give John Frakes a bit of props.  Most of his job it seemed was either yelling at Worf, yelling Red Alert, or yelling at Worf to arm phasers and photon torpedoes, but there was one scene that struck me as the best acting he ever did on the show: remember that episode where Geordi could control a probe through a neural link and he believed he found his mother on a crashing ship?  There's a scene where Riker goes to engineering to console him and he tells a story about losing his mother when he was very young.  It's very subtle, but Riker starts to get a little choked up while telling the story.  This is not something we see from this character much, and Frakes knocked it out of the park as Riker's most vulnerable moment."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,rliant1864,13,Wed Jul 15 16:37:52 2015 UTC,"Personally I've always enjoyed Billingsley, Spiner, and Blalock in their respective roles.  Billingsley I think doesn't get a lot of recognition. I think he played the jolly old doctor fantastically and his acting of the weird Denobulan quirks are really fun to watch. Phlox's sleep and hallucination episodes are definitely highlights of Enterprise."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Asiriya,3,Wed Jul 15 17:06:54 2015 UTC,Phlox was certainly my favourite of the ENT crew. The episode where everyone has to be put into sleep and he's alone (with T'Pol?) is just wonderful. I'm going to watch it now!
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,PENIS_OBESE,4,Wed Jul 15 21:44:39 2015 UTC,"Billingsley was really great on such a flawed show. Phlox was pretty nebbish and fairly understated, but he brought the Denobulan weirdness to life with a ton of likability."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,MeVasta,8,Wed Jul 15 17:35:25 2015 UTC,"It really is a shame that Enterprise went back to the TOS model where only the main three get big story lines. I can't say I'm sad that we didn't see more from Mayweather (although I can't imagine Anthony Montgomery was all too happy about that), but Park's Hoshi Sato was my favorite take on the newbie character the franchise ever did, Keating gave the occasional gravitas his character got the right amount of dramatic weight and Phlox, above all the others, was simply a delight to watch."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,drafterman,29,Wed Jul 15 19:01:17 2015 UTC,"Patrick Stewart get's top notes as a main character for his sheer range. From rage to defiance to despair, he played every human emotion there is, and then some.  Next come Brent Spiner and Robert Picardo, for essentially the opposite reasons. From an acting perspective I don't know if this is easier or harder, but they had to deliberately play people with limited ranges, especially in the face of situations which should evoke emotions. The room suddenly gets dusty when I watch Data frantically try and save Lal, but Mr. Spiner keeps a straight face.  As far as recurring actors, I think DS9's set really takes the cake here. Marc Alaimo (Dukat), Andrew Robinson (Garak), Jeffrey Combs (Brunt, Weyoun), Wallace Shawn (Grand Nagus Zek). TNG certainly has John DeLancie and the venerable Marc Lenard and Lenard Nimoy, but VOY and ENT just seemed to tap into the pool of ""fan favorites"" established by previous series."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Btro134,19,Wed Jul 15 15:04:47 2015 UTC,"Jeffrey Combs! His portrayal of Weyoun was a highlight of DS9 for me. When I recently began watching Enterprise I was thrilled when I saw him. He really can play any character convincingly - ferengi, andorian, common thug, vorta."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,phyridean,7,Wed Jul 15 16:17:30 2015 UTC,"It's a testament to his skill (or maybe my poor observational skills) that I was in Season 6 of DS9 before I realized he played both Weyoun and Brunt.  Of course, then when I saw him in Tsunkatse, I knew exactly who he was."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,GhostNULL,4,Wed Jul 15 16:43:58 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, I just found out in the comments, after watching DS9 twice...  Edit: shit, he also played shran :O  Edit2: I think it's because the voices of the different characters are all quite different. Which is of course not bad, and actually really good acting I would say."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,vibrant_crab,4,Wed Jul 15 19:00:28 2015 UTC,"He even played two different Ferengi with totally different personalities. Brunt (FCA) on DS9 and Krem in the episode ""Acquisition"" on ENT."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,IkLms,4,Wed Jul 15 22:13:39 2015 UTC,"I had the same reaction when going back through ENT again, right after DS9 and I noticed he was the actor portraying Shran. Weyoun and Shran are easily two of my favorite characters to appear in the shows."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Asiriya,3,Wed Jul 15 16:46:18 2015 UTC,"I loved him as Weyoun, definitely a highlight of DS9. The latter episodes when he's around more and interacting with the rest of the cast are amongst the best imo."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,frezik,3,Wed Jul 15 21:42:48 2015 UTC,DS9's guest cast was amazing. How did that even happen? Most shows anywhere don't get a main billing cast that's half as good.
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,berlinbrown,2,Wed Jul 15 16:52:39 2015 UTC,"Spiner just kills (good kind) that character.  I really believe 20 years for now, people will point to Data as a model for AI and Robotics."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,jckgat,51,Thu Jul 16 00:04:59 2015 UTC,"My personal favorites are actually all women.  Katherine Mulgrew manages the almost impossible task of selling her often poorly-written character, and as a result she strikes me as the most authentically authoritative captain other than Picard.   Jeri Ryan gives incredible depth to a character who could have been a boring robot -- matching and in some cases exceeding Brent Spiner's similar achievement, in that Ryan evinces greater subtlety and does a more convincing deadpan. When called upon to play a whole range of roles in a single episode, Spiner-style, she also does an amazing job in my view.  Jolene Blalock makes T'Pol my favorite Vulcan. She really sells the layers of conflicting emotion beneath the stoic Vulcan surface.  I find it distressing that fans dismiss the latter two so often on the basis of their looks. Being conventionally attractive and being a good actor are not mutually exclusive. Yes, it was sexist for the producers to present them as eye-candy and especially to dress them like they did, but dismissing them on the basis of the producers' poor motivations is a perverse way to take a stand against sexism. Reducing a woman to her looks is not a way to fight against sexism -- it just is sexism."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,AttackTribble,20,Wed Jul 15 15:08:48 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with all of these. None of the three can be faulted for bad writing, yet often are.   Mulgrew is actually why I ended up watching Orange is the New Black. I had no idea who was in it when I started, and once I recognized her after a few seconds, she alone kept me watching past those first few bad episodes.  As for Ryan, well I understand why people thought she was just there for looks, and the catsuit certainly didn't help. But they did also immediately start actually exploring the character, and later on she does fantastically nail an impression of Picardo. Voyager was in later seasons the Doctor and Seven show,  guest starring Janeway, but that was a good show because all three are great actors. People who dismiss her and Blalock for looks never watched the show I think.  As for Blalock, she was a victim even more than the other two of bad writing, but I've never understood why people are unimpressed with her as a Vulcan. I've always thought she was quite honest to the role, helped by Blalock herself who wanted to keep the role as an honest Vulcan against Berman's terrible ideas."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,IntergalacticTowel,9,Wed Jul 15 15:45:08 2015 UTC,"I think Blalock probably did the most convincing Vulcan, at least the way I see them. Considering how relatively little acting experience she had when she started, I think that was astonishing."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,p_velocity,7,Wed Jul 15 17:21:00 2015 UTC,Blalock did a great job. The struggle she experienced as a young vulcan living among (smelly!) emotional races in close quarters for a long period of time was well acted.
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,jgrova,3,Wed Jul 15 18:34:07 2015 UTC,"not gonna lie, I never considered watching Voyager until they got 7 of 9. There was a a promo of the episode where she kisses Harry in a dream and says ""resistance is futile"".   I was pleasantly surprised to find that the show was actually good for reasons other than her incredible, ridiculous sexiness."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,contrasupra,18,Wed Jul 15 22:19:41 2015 UTC,"Scenes between any two (or among the three) of Janeway, Seven, and the Doctor are my favorite scenes from Voyager. They were leagues above the rest of the main cast, and their on-screen chemistry was unparalleled."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Robotochan,9,Wed Jul 15 15:43:21 2015 UTC,"I'm probably in the minority here, but I got tired of the Doctor in later seasons, and I especially got tired of his frustrated crush on Seven. It was a little cheap to hook Seven up with Chakotay in the end, because it had the feeling of being a choice by default (Paris is taken, Kim is too awkward, Tuvok is married) -- but of course she wants to be with a real human being and not a hologram! The whole point is that she's trying to become human! Maybe we wish she could see past that, but her emotional maturity is that of a very young adolescent at best.   Also, way too much opera for my taste, though the cold open where he ad libs the ""illogical"" libretto is classic."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,contrasupra,7,Wed Jul 15 15:53:01 2015 UTC,"I get really sick of how hard they push the ""Doctor is an arrogant jackass"" in the later seasons. He's constantly going on about how he's not appreciated, but it seems to me that accounting for his inherent limitations (it's not like anyone can change the fact that he's a hologram) he has more leeway than practically anyone on the crew, and there are virtually never any consequences for his bad behavior. There's an episode where he joins up with a group of evil holograms and kidnaps B'elanna and puts them all at enormous risk and at the end Janeway is like, ""I suppose it's my fault for allowing you to explore your humanity."" What?? Part of being human is accepting consequences for your actions. Paris got a demotion and 30 days in the brig for a similar (but way less dangerous) infraction.   The last few seasons are just full of him being full of himself. That episode where the Doctor writes a holonovel about how horrible the crew is really tips him over into ""unlikeable jerk"" for me."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,BonzoTheBoss,5,Wed Jul 15 20:10:34 2015 UTC,What about the one where he ditches the crew to become a singer for some weird ass population? He's simply welcomed back after it goes horribly wrong.
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,contrasupra,7,Wed Jul 15 22:10:00 2015 UTC,"Or the one where he inhabits Seven of Nine's borg implants and thoughtlessly abuses her body? Or the one where he and Janeway are kidnapped and he blatantly disregards her orders and (AGAIN) puts the entire crew at risk and then she is like ""well you sulked in sick bay for a week, I guess that's punishment enough."" And no matter what he's always ""oh woe is me, woe is me, I'm a hologram!"" That's right buddy, you are a hologram, which means I can turn you off.  UGH."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,TiVO25,5,Wed Jul 15 22:37:07 2015 UTC,"In the episode you mention (""VOY:Flesh and Blood"") I thought they explained Janeway's unwillingness to punish the Doctor quite well. He'd already arbitrarily confined himself to sickbay in the past to ""punish"" himself, but confiscating his mobile emitter is something else entirely. It isn't akin to ""throwing him in the brig"", it would be like Janeway temporarily removing someone elses arms and legs as punishment so that they physically couldn't leave a room. For all intents and purposes the emitter is a part of him, which is why she says she'd be ""taking away his identity"". Furthermore, on the pragmatic limitations of punishing him, he is their only professional surgeon. I know that doesn't excuse what he does, but Janway is nothing if not pragmatic.  But that's just that specific episode. I agree with you that the Doctor's over-inclusion in episodes and the way he was written did go overboard sometimes."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,metakepone,3,Thu Jul 16 11:15:57 2015 UTC,"It isn't akin to ""throwing him in the brig"", it would be like Janeway temporarily removing someone elses arms and legs as punishment so that they physically couldn't leave a room.   eh, I'm not sure I agree. I don't see how it's all that different from shutting someone behind a force field so they physically can't leave a room. And honestly, the doctor has it much better in sick bay (with access to his friends, ability to do his work, etc) than any humanoid has it in the tiny brig."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,rliant1864,8,Thu Jul 16 12:04:58 2015 UTC,"I find it distressing that fans dismiss the latter two so often on the basis of their looks.   I have to be honest, while I didn't write Ryan off because of her looks, but I did write her off because I knew that's why she was added to the show. I pretty much stopped watching shortly after she was introduced because she was introduced for that reason, as I was ""righteously offended"" that the show would stoop to that level to try to get me to watch Star Trek.   But when I finally set that aside and went back to watch the seasons she's in, I have to say that Ryan is hands down one of the best actors in the franchise. She does a phenomenal job with portraying the growth Seven undergoes."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,metakepone,5,Wed Jul 15 19:02:44 2015 UTC,"I am genuinely curious, and I don't disagree with you or agree with you, but what makes Janeway badly written, other than wanting to find coffee in nebulas and having Salamander sex with Paris?  Also, Seven's first real post-borg episode ""Raven"" demonstrated that Ryan wasn't just there as a ""t and a"" exhibit."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,IntergalacticTowel,11,Wed Jul 15 15:57:46 2015 UTC,A general inconsistency in her character and thought process. There's no one episode or example -- but Mulgrew herself thought Janeway might have a serious psychosis.
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,metakepone,5,Wed Jul 15 15:59:06 2015 UTC,"I haven't watched Voyager yet, but as I understand it that wasn't intentional, right? Just poor consistency in the character between episode writers."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,IntergalacticTowel,10,Wed Jul 15 17:00:07 2015 UTC,Right. Mulgrew was being sarcastic about the uneven writing.
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,metakepone,5,Wed Jul 15 17:01:32 2015 UTC,"From what I've read, the producers waned voyager to be this show you can watch any episode of at any time and point of the run and be easily entertained, is consistency took a blow."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Asiriya,3,Wed Jul 15 17:52:43 2015 UTC,That's the kind of crud that ruins too many shows. Hopefully the next TV Star Trek (assuming that happens) will not need to be so episodic in this age of Netflix and on-demand viewing. Let the characters have some consistency and growth!
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,MungoBaobab,2,Wed Jul 15 18:37:37 2015 UTC,"I think there should be a balance between the two. They can do what tng did maybe to a degree further where there was a planet or alien of the week and a two larger but definitely character growth. A show filled with arc after arc all the time can grow tiresome, especially if the show lasts for 7 seasons."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,kraetos,2,Wed Jul 15 18:46:17 2015 UTC,"Oh, absolutely. The one thing I'd like to be consistent is the characters' growth and their respective memories and experiences, which allows for genuine (interesting) development in the face of new challenges. The tempo for each arc should certainly vary for just the reason you've stated."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,MungoBaobab,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:05:31 2015 UTC,"I think they should weave in and out of focus too, like Breaking Bad"
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,philwelch,2,Wed Jul 15 22:33:08 2015 UTC,"Why would you expect it to be able to go for 7? Not that I disagree, I think there should be more Xindi-style seasons."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,MungoBaobab,4,Wed Jul 15 21:27:04 2015 UTC,"Do you have an iron-clad source for Mulgrew's supposed claim that Janeway was bipolar or any other criticism from her regarding the show or her character? I am very, very skeptical, and in fact actively doubtful, that any statement of this sort was ever made by her."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Asiriya,9,Wed Jul 15 19:01:33 2015 UTC,"There's no iron-clad source because, allegedly, it's something she discusses at autograph signings and conventions. No one has ever captured it on video. Here are some unconfirmed mentions of Mulgrew's opinion on Janeway's mental health:   ""According to Kate Mulgrew when asked during an autograph signing, she said her belief was that Janeway was in fact at best Bipolar or at worst, suffered some kind of mental instability."" ""Janeway: Kate Mulgrew has suggested the character is bipolar, or has some other undiagnosed mental illness."" ""Her character on Star Trek: Voyager (1995), Captain Kathryn Janeway, is regarded by fans as having bipolar disorder because of her erratic actions. Ms. Mulgrew said she blames the writers.""   But as you can see, these are all second- and third-party references. Mulgrew is a pretty straight shooter, and this claim is propagated so much on the internet that it wouldn't surprise me if there's a kernel of truth behind it, but ultimately there is no primary source for the comment. I'm with you: I've always suspected this claim is exaggerated or outright false. I think the most likely explanation is that she said it in jest, and someone took her seriously."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,philwelch,6,Wed Jul 15 20:01:34 2015 UTC,"See, Janeway is accused of ""erratic actions,"" but consider this scene from TNG's ""The Neutral Zone:""   PICARD: Look, I am never critical of any member of my staff being curious, but it's just that the timing is so…  DATA: I could not leave them there, Captain. The condition of their vehicle was deteriorating.   PICARD: But Data, they were already dead. I mean, what more could have happened to them?   DATA: I see your point, Captain, but at the time it seemed the proper thing to do.   PICARD: Well, they're alive now. We're going to have to treat them as living human beings.    Picard, archaeology aficionado and student of history, Picard, the bastion of morality,  whose job it is to explore, to learn, to save people, chastises Data for saving the lives of three people from ages past and frustratedly admits that now hell ""have to treat them as living human beings."" His hands are tied, dammit. ""The were already dead."" Silly Data for rushing in to save these people and wanting to learn something from them.   Now, Janeway never had a moment that bad. Yet, nobody is asking Patrick Stewart to explain his irrational behavior. Nobody ever accuses him of being bipolar or psychotic. Just the fact that Janeway is being taken to task for this sort of thing and the others aren't is cause for worry. Something is amiss."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,NEM3S1S,4,Thu Jul 16 00:50:28 2015 UTC,"That's one example, from an early season when we all know the early seasons are uneven. With Janeway it was a pattern of behavior."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,NEM3S1S,4,Thu Jul 16 03:12:22 2015 UTC,I do not have an iron-clad source. Perhaps it's just an ugly rumor.
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,metakepone,5,Wed Jul 15 19:11:38 2015 UTC,"I think so. Can you imagine Kate Mulgrew appearing at a convention, in front of hundreds of attendees who paid to see her, including little girls in Seven of Nine costumes, getting up on stage and trashing the show on which she had a starring role? Not only would that be  unprofessional, it would be discourteous and disrespectful towards her fans and the fans of her show.   To be honest, I would even go so far as to say that rumor is grounded in misogyny. Note how inconsistencies in Picard's character are resolved by splitting him into two characters, transporter accident-style: Picard and Action Picard. Picard would allow himself to be shot with an arrow to uphold the Prime a directive, but only Action Picard would tear-ass around in a dune buggy while Worf sprays .20-cal rounds into the native population. Picard isn't bipolar, only Janeway is. Sisko's  inconsistencies are glossed over completely. In one episode he Can Live with ItTM, and in the next he fights the fine fight shutting down Section 31. The truth is every captain is inconsistent, as is every series. In one episode the Prime Directive must be upheld at all costs, in another it's a guideline that can be broken if necessary. Yet only Janeway is accused of and criticized for being a slave to her emotions."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,kraetos,7,Wed Jul 15 20:04:50 2015 UTC,"I'm embarrassed to have fallen for it, then. Not only Janeway as a character, but I think Voyager as a whole, gets disproportionate criticism in large part due to discomfort with women being in charge -- not only in the big chair, but in engineering. The addition of Seven of Nine later only exacerbated the problem. If we look at the outrage over Tuvix and the praise of ""In the Pale Moonlight,"" I think the double standard is clear."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,dpgaspard,4,Wed Jul 15 20:34:04 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to comment on the misogyny point. While I don't think it's true for me (I've not watched much Voyager since I was a child and couldn't see its problems) I'm probably biased.   Not only would that be unprofessional, it would be discourteous and disrespectful towards her fans and the fans of her show.   I can be a fan of a show whilst acknowledging its flaws. I would rather an actor make comment on why the flaws exist than them pretend I'm wrong. To do otherwise would be disingenuous, especially so long after the fact and with TV having moved on. Star Trek (as filmed) is camp, there's not much like it being produced anymore. There's no harm in admitting that and that some episodes weren't up to scratch.  I love what Ron Moore did with BSG, but if he tried to tell me that not having a plan for the final five (or a plan for the Cylons' plan) didn't affect the show's quality it would affect my opinion far more negatively."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,comfort_eagle,2,Wed Jul 15 21:36:47 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I would even go so far as to say that rumor is grounded in misogyny.   It's kind of disappointing to see comments like this in /r/DaystromInstitute. I thought the goal of this subreddit was to provide sound arguments and reasoning for our opinions. Accusations of misogyny aren't arguments for or against anything; they're just an attempt to use social stigmas to dismiss someone's comments without actually addressing their truth or falsity."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,BonzoTheBoss,2,Thu Jul 16 03:29:12 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure it was an interview done post-VOY. I seem to remember it being related to Orange is the New Black, and the interviewer decided to ask her about VOY.  I don't have a source at the moment. It sounds like something she'd say, but she was likely professional about it, possibly even trying to make a lighthearted jab, rather than trying to condemn the writers."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,hummingbirdz,2,Wed Jul 15 23:57:13 2015 UTC,"It's ""intentional"" in that the overall tone of VOY was much more ""dilemma of the week"" and action-oriented than some of the other shows. Because the writing focused on putting the crew in perilous situations, the only way to feasibly get them in an out of those scenarios is to have consistency take a backseat. This is most obvious in the time-travel episodes, where the rules change from episode to episode, or, in the case of Future's End (Season 3), between the start and end of the story.  It's also why characters don't really have an arc to speak of. The few who do are the standouts: Seven and the Doctor, and to a lesser extent, Neelix and Janeway. Other characters have mini-arcs in episodes focused on them, like ""Thirty Days"" (Tom Paris), or any Chakotay episode (which are generally pretty boring and repetitive, sadly). Unfortunately, those mini-arcs usually don't affect the characters in any meaningful way (as in, they're the same person for the sake of the show)."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,TiVO25,2,Wed Jul 15 23:55:18 2015 UTC,"Ah, I can certainly agree. For example, there's the end of ""Deadlock"", SPOILER. While it was funny, where the hell did that come from?"
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,vibrant_crab,5,Wed Jul 15 16:17:40 2015 UTC,"Just so you know, we discourage spoiler tags here. Daystrom is a browse at your own risk zone when it comes to spoilers."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,NEM3S1S,2,Wed Jul 15 19:55:42 2015 UTC,"It's was about 3 episodes into the first season when Captain Janeway, says something like we're a long way from the Federation, we can't uphold ourselves to what we would do in the Alpha quadrant."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,DauntlessP,5,Wed Jul 15 22:52:20 2015 UTC,other than wanting to find coffee in nebulas   That's not an example of great writing?
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,metakepone,3,Wed Jul 15 20:12:59 2015 UTC,"I don't really agree that Janeway was that inconsistent, but to play devil's advocate I can think of a couple of examples.  I think it boils down to the fact that in some episodes Janeway is a real stickler for the rules and regulations and the safety of her crew and getting them home, but in others she completely disregards said rules, endangers her crew seemingly without second thought and absent mindedly wanders off getting involved with anomalies and species that could have been entirely avoided if, you know, she'd kept to the overarching goal of getting home.  In ""VOY; Demon"", Voyager is running low on deuterium and needs to get it from the Y-class ""demon"" planet. They send down Tom and Harry in a modified shuttle to collect the deuterium, pretty sensible right? But it turns out the silver liquid on the planet is sentient and copies Tom and Harry. In response, Janeway lands the entire ship instead of sending another shuttle or something, knowing full well that if they don't get the deuterium they will be trapped and probably die horribly on the planet surface. Her ultimate solution? Allow the silver liquid to duplicate her entire crew so that the existing copies won't be ""lonely"".  Another example I can think of is in ""VOY; The Void"" wherein Voyager is trapped within a subspace pocket or something, there's no food or energy except from other ships that get pulled into the void and there's no way to escape. Instead of succumbing to desperation and start ""pirating"" to survive, Voyager forms a ""proto-Federation"", an alliance of ships within the void who refuse to use violence but instead foster co-operation for mutual escape. They ultimately succeed and prove how sticking to the principles of diplomacy and peaceful negotiations of the Federation has saved them once again! Huzzah!  But then in ""VOY; Scientific Method"" where a race of invisible alien scientists start using Voyager as a big lab experiment, Janeway decides to fly Voyager between two binary stars to force the aliens to leave. Where were her unrelenting principles and dedication to diplomacy then?  Or how about Janeway's steadfast refusal to give the Kazon replicator technology (in keeping with the Prime Directive, right?) but then a few seasons later she freely gives the Hirogen holo-technology.  Now, a lot of these could be explained in-universe, Janeway has been established as a risk taker when the stakes are high enough, like when Tuvok recounts to Chakotay during ""Voy; Scorpion"" about how she personally risked her life to show the crew that their sacrifice wasn't in vain. However there's a big difference between risking her own life and that of her crew. I'd argue Archer better exemplifies this characteristic, he often embraces suicide missions if it means saving his crew. Or how Janeway knew if they didn't get the deuterium they'd all be dead anyway, so better commit everything, but I still think the whole ship was a bit extreme. Or the alien scientists had arbitrarily been increasing her stress hormones so she was technically compromised when she flew the ship through a couple of stars.   Or how the Kazon would have used replicators to make weapons but the holotechnology has purely peaceful applications. Personally I'd argue the Prime Directive doesn't apply to the Kazon because they are a space faring race, and we've seen it's possible to limit replicators to only make non-weapons. A more resource-stable Kazon sect may have been a stabilizing force in the region! And we clearly saw how the Hirogen perverted the holo-tech into something destructive. (One of the few times the writers actually followed up on Voyagers dealings with other races)"
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,gauderio,4,Thu Jul 16 13:45:37 2015 UTC,"I think I agree on Mulgrew, without her acting Janeway would be difficult to like. Her acting definitely rescues her character, and is certainly the best example of this among regular cast members.   I'm interested in what you mean by 'authentically authoritative' and what your full ranking of say the captains would be? If I had to reach for a term for Janeway  'authentically authoritative' fits, but I'm having difficulty operationalizing it so to speak. Like why would you say Sisko or Kirk is lower than Janeway--not that I think they should be just to illustrate the concept?"
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,GhostNULL,3,Wed Jul 15 16:57:58 2015 UTC,"You know, I was never a huge fan of Mulgrew, until I saw some of the stuff that the original actress did with the character. After that, Mulgrew grew on me real quick."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Algernon_Asimov,2,Wed Jul 15 19:04:58 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with you about Jolene Blalock.  She did a fantastic job of showing the depth of Vulcan emotion, especially when she started abusing Trellium and her control was compromised."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Btro134,7,Wed Jul 15 22:17:05 2015 UTC,"For TNG, which I've seen a good deal of (not every episode... yet!), John de Lancie is an obvious standout. I think Jonathan Frakes did a good job of portraying Riker, and there's no doubting that Brent Spiner and Patrick Stewart were also well-cast, but de Lancie's performance is always a real treat. Winner: John de Lancie.  I've seen the first three seasons of DS9, but immediately the answer is Andy Robinson as Garak. From the moment they introduced his character, I was shocked by how much I liked him. I found myself wanting more episodes with Garak, just to watch him act. I also liked the chemistry shared by Rene Auberjonois and Armin Shimerman. Winnder: Andy Robinson.  I've seen every episode of VOY. Robert Picardo did a fantastic job of giving life to the Doctor, and Ethan Phillips did wonderfully in the role of Neelix. Most of the characters were fairly two-dimensional, which fit with the overall action-oriented theme of the show, but also made it hard for any of the actors to really shine. Overall, I think those two did the best job of making simple, one-note characters become larger than life. If I had to pick only one, though, it would be Robert Picardo, for showing the transition of the Doctor from simple (well, complex) program to almost human, as well as showing us the cynical Dr. Zimmerman, and showcased his dark side in Warhead, when the Doctor was possessed by the alien missile. Winner: Robert Picardo  I don't know if I can be a fair judge of TOS. I've seen the movies, and Ricardo Montalban certainly stands out.  As for my favorite? Probably John de Lancie. The life and personality that he brought to Q is hard to beat."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,MexicanSpaceProgram,6,Wed Jul 15 16:43:45 2015 UTC,"I think among the best actors are Patrick Stewart (Jean-Luc Picard) and Robert Picardo (The Doctor).  Patrick Stewart portrait an amazing range of emotion, from utter amazement and joy to anguish and hate. He could play a stong leader and Captain as well as show a weak side (The episode ""Sarek"" comes to mind). I also quite liked the final scene in ""Ménage à Troi"", where he effectively playes a satire of traditional Shakespeare  and by extention his own training as an actor.  Robert Picardo often plays a somewhat grumpy character but he has a strong range to draw from as well, as can be seen in the brilliant performance in ""Latent Image"", arguably one of the single best performances in the show. It has been some time since i watched much Voyager, so i can't give other examples from the top of my head for his good performances, but since you asked about other sci-fi franchises: He has also been on Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis, where he goes from a slightly antagonistic-neutral character who was deeply troubled with what he was forced to do (deciding to kill Daniel Jackson) to a leading good character (in Atlantis season 5). This also shows how he can change and evolve an existing character.  Edit: expanded a bit"
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,philwelch,4,Wed Jul 15 14:46:53 2015 UTC,"I think among the best actors are Patrick Stewart (Jean-Luc Picard) and Robert Picardo (The Doctor).   Patrick Stewart and Brent Spiner are going to get a ton of praise, and they certainly deserve it. I've been watching Voyager, and two episodes that really stand out for me, so far, is ""Life Signs"" and ""Real Life."" I don't know what makes for great theater or great acting, but I know that I entered both episodes sorta meh, and that was because the Doctor was just being his old salty self, but Pichardo's performance gets me totally emotionally invested by the end of each episode (so many feels when he dances with Pel, and how he shows how much he truly loves her; and when he hugs his holographic family after his daughter dies). Episodes like those demonstrate why Voyager is worth a look (lots of other good performances on the show, but as Robert Beltran complained about, there wasn't consistent character development in the later seasons."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,philwelch,6,Wed Jul 15 15:04:02 2015 UTC,"Too lazy to look for all the actors names so I'll go by the characters -  Picard and Data, obviously.  Janeway and The Doctor.

DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,ravageritual,15,Wed Jul 15 15:57:23 2015 UTC,The new McCoy does a reasonably good impression of DeForest Kelley. That's all I got.

DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,BigTaker,4,Wed Jul 15 16:41:50 2015 UTC,Pulaski was an early glimpse at the Borg. Watch as the doctor assimilates Kelley's character.
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Berggeist,3,Wed Jul 15 17:01:35 2015 UTC,"I have to say, after recently re-watching all of TOS, I gained some new respect for Shatner's acting. Nimoy is, I think, the best in the show, but Shatner really makes it happen."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,BigTaker,4,Wed Jul 15 16:26:01 2015 UTC,"Guess I'll be the first to nominate Connor Trineer as Tripp from Enterprise.  When I rewatched the series a few years ago, I was very impressed with how genuine his performance was, and he had the emotional range when called for to boot.  As much as I am fond of many other Trek characters, he is probably the only one I felt connected to and the only one I sincerely cared about.  That fact is all the more impressive considering Enterprise was my least favorite show, and I think it was the only show that botched the casting.  Even the actors have stated that they never had good chemistry and believe."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,the_dinks,7,Wed Jul 15 18:01:31 2015 UTC,"A really good friend of mine turned me on to Tim Russ' acting. My first run-through of Voyager, I never really cared for Tuvok, but after hearing his praise for Russ' portrayal of a Vulcan, I watched it again paying particular attention to that, and I have to give him credit. I honestly now believe that, after the two gentlemen who defined the race (Mark Lenard and Leonard Nimoy, of course), that Tim Russ' is the best portrayal of a Vulcan in the entire franchise.  ETA:  For the One Time Character category, maybe because I've watched it recently and it's still fresh in my mind, but Harris Yulin's performance as Aamin Marritza in the DS9 episode ""Duet"" is easily one of the best performances I've seen in all of Star Trek.  And for the Regular Occuring category, my hat is definitely off to Jeffry Combs. He's great in all the roles he's played, but I absolutely loved his portrayal of Shran. I thought he demonstrated a lot of range in that character."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,berlinbrown,7,Wed Jul 15 18:37:25 2015 UTC,"Thinking back, Nimoy and DeForest Kelly were also superb actors, although I want to focus on Nimoy. He brought so much to the character of Spock – wit, seriousness, and above all, a sense of being alien. He made TOS what it is."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,brodysattva,4,Wed Jul 15 19:33:51 2015 UTC,"A bit late to the party perhaps but here's my view: The question as posed is almost to broad to be proparly answered. There are simply to many amazing actors and performances in five series and thirteen movies that fit into the possible catagories.   Having said that i think there are some that stand out significantly enough to mention. My absolute top favorite is HJ Hertzler. He's, in my opinion, hands down the best of them all. Now having seen other performances of him i do think that his role as Martok suited him like no other. Martok could not be played better by anyone else and Hertzler cannot play any role better than he did Martok. Not to say that he's not good playing anything else though but the part and the actor just were the perfect match.  Mark Alaimo was one of the other actors that made lasting impression, occasionally putting amazing performances on screen that are legendary.  I think that Brent Spiner deserves considerable respect, not only for his unforgettable and consistantly awesome performance as Data but also in the other roles he's performed in the Trekiverse.  Shimerman brought to life the Ferengi and became, for my personal experience, a good friend over the years. Quark will always be one of the best characters in Startrek.  I also like to commend (here goes my karma) Wil Wheaton for his role as Wesly. I still think he did an amazing job with the role and for me (being the same age) he made TNG a bit more personal. He also showed the differences between the childlike qualities in Data and childlike qualities in children.   But ofcourse the most legendary, longlasting and most impressive of all Startrek actors must be Nimoy. Spock has had and will continue to have a significant influence in my life, if only for the fact my dog is named Spock.   Special mention ofcourse is deserved by Combs. Weyoun and Shran alone are performances that stood out and were most memorable.  I am doing a great disservice and injustice to a great number of great actors/actresses and performances ofcourse but i'd be wearing out my keyboard if i didn't."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,majeric,5,Wed Jul 15 20:32:16 2015 UTC,"I gotta give some love for Casey Biggs (you know, the guy that used to be married to B'Elanna).  His biggest role was obviously Damar on DS9, but he played other ST characters as well, both on DS9 and ENT (I had a memory of him on TNG, but Memory Alpha doesn't list anything).  I thought he played such a flawed character as Damar quite well and always enjoyed when he got screen time."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,vibrant_crab,4,Wed Jul 15 20:44:23 2015 UTC,"Jeffrey Combs has been in so many episodes, spanning from TNG to Enterprise. I think he is the best for flexibility alone."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,majeric,2,Wed Jul 15 18:48:47 2015 UTC,"Solid actor. Shran was a highlight of Enterprise, so much so that it's a shame we never saw him become a permanent member of the crew as was planned."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,cptaixel,4,Wed Jul 15 22:37:51 2015 UTC,"This is a very difficult question, in part because sometimes an actors quirks are what make us love them and sells their performance.  As an example, on the one hand Leonard Nimoy took his craft seriously and put a lot of thought and effort into his character and the surrounding mythology. Thanks to his investments the character of Spock, alongside Vulcan culture, has nuance and depth that never would have existed had someone less involved been cast as Spock. He was by far the most credible actor on TOS.  Compare that to Shatner. In a word, Shatner is unique. This doesn't make him ""bad"", though. I think in a very real way, Shatner's distinctive everything really sold the character of Captain Kirk. He's definitely not on the same creative level as Nimoy was, but he knows how to work his charisma and because of that he's very enjoyable.  If we're strictly talking in the sense of ""that person just blew me away with that performance"", there's a lot of really obvious answers like Nimoy, Stewart and Brooks.  It's likely Andrew J. Robinson (Garak) has already been commented on, but I'd like to repeat it. He put some thought into the character and gave some personal touches when possible (until he got asked to tone certain elements down), and wrote a quite enjoyable book about Garak, Stitch in Time."

DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,John_Strange,3,Thu Jul 16 00:11:14 2015 UTC,"My favorite minor character might well be Gowron, and it's all because of the brilliance with which Robert O'Reilly plays him. He's so committed to his portrayal of an essentially cartoonish character that it goes past cartoonish and back to gravitas. Like so many of these others, it seems he had a Shakespearean background, and that must at least account for the subtlety and intelligence of his line readings. Also, obviously, those eyes."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,doesntakethehighroad,5,Wed Jul 15 20:17:27 2015 UTC,"I have to give the actors of DS9 credit for working so well as an ensemble cast. DS9 had such strong balance.

Each had their moment in the sun."

Also, Christopher Plummer in ST6 was just inspired casting."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,MexicanSpaceProgram,2,Wed Jul 15 22:58:28 2015 UTC,"Star Trek routinely casts strong stage-trained actors, so a list of the best ones would be really long.

DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,MexicanSpaceProgram,2,Thu Jul 16 00:02:54 2015 UTC,"In terms of the best ensemble performance, I'd easily say DS9's Far Beyond the Stars.  Every main cast member shines in their own way in that episode, showing the range of each actor.  There are bits and pieces of their DS9 characters in the 1960s characters each actor portrays--and yet each is totally distinct and engaging.  Avery Brooks, of course, as a man oppressed until he's destroyed, mentally and physically, gives the standout performance.  As much as I love Star Trek, its optimism too often derives from Roddenberry saccharine which doesn't always feel earned.  Far Beyond the Stars is optimistic because the contemporary world in which we're watching Star Trek is more like Sisko's future than it is like Benny's 1960s experience.  It's optimistic because we can already see how far we've come and we can happily consider how much further we'll go.  And it's all thanks to Avery Brooks' performance."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,Bohnanza,2,Wed Jul 15 23:21:53 2015 UTC,"Patrick Stewart = awesome Gul Dukat = awesome Zachary Quinto = awesome Leonard Nimoy = awesome  Benjamin Sisko?

Corny in the TV series, but much better in the films."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,frezik,2,Wed Jul 15 23:51:28 2015 UTC,"So many of the best have been mentioned but I want to bring up a few. One, Shatner. It's easy to make fun, but watching the series again there is a lot of great stuff that he does. Avery Brooks does much more hammy stuff than the Shat (barring the occasional ""I'm Gaptain Guuuuurk!!"")  And I want to show some love for Patti Yasutake (nurse Ogawa). Great job making a glorified extra memorable."
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,IntergalacticTowel,3,Thu Jul 16 01:32:35 2015 UTC,"Not so great with ""best of"" lists, so here's my worst of one:   Marina Sirtis as Troi.  This one's easy - by the the time the TNG movies roll around, she's not even bothering to do the accent from the series and just sounds like Marina Sirtis in an interview. Robert Beltran as Chakotay - boring actor, boring role, obviously just going through the motions for the paycheque. Garret Wang as Harry Kim - same reasons as Chakotay, just not as bad.  Wooden actor, wooden character. Walter Koenig as Chekov.  Less so in TOS, moreso in the movies.  Can't really blame the guy as he got more pissed off with Shatner and the franchise the longer it went on, and it shows."

DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,BigTaker,2,Wed Jul 15 18:25:16 2015 UTC,He was a lot better in TOS than he was in the movies - especially as they went on and the minor roles were further marginalised to give more screentime to Kirk and Spock.
DaystromInstitute,3ddts7,berlinbrown,4,Thu Jul 16 01:44:03 2015 UTC,"Sirtis in First Contact and on is embarrassing. Beltran and Wang drew some really short straws with badly written characters, but I might be the only person that kind of liked the Chakotay character and the bit of life Beltran was able to bring. I had a hard time believing Wang was a professional actor and not just some guy.   Koenig is actually talented. The series gave him a profoundly stupid character to play, but the movies let his character develop and you can see some life and fun especially in 4.   EDIT: Of course series Chekov was stupid from my 2015 perspective, but it was very important culturally to see Russian and Japanese characters as worthy, talented, good hearted and valuable people as well as members of the crew. I was a child when the Berlin Wall fell so I never experienced Cold War indoctrination. It clearly meant more for my parents' generation."

He was a good actor, his character was interesting (Maquis, a religious human, alienated, etc.), and incredibly important (keeping Maquis in check, bumping an actual SF officer out of the XO job, a pragmatic voice to an idealistic Captain), but it never really seemed to go anywhere.  The Maquis stuff was completely forgotten about and the religious angle just became cringeworthy (""the bones of my people"")."
DaystromInstitute,3dfquu,fidelio123,14,Wed Jul 15 22:35:30 2015 UTC,"Excuse me for blatantly copying from myself:  We only ever here the Enterprise-D referred to as ""The Flagship of the Federation"".  We have no reason to believe the other Enterprises we also called that. The 1701 was famous but also a training ship for a while (doesn't mean it wasn't both, but never stated as a flagship), neither was the 1701-A called the Flagship, when the logical choice would be the Excelsior (1701-A had a famous name and captain, sure, but not flagship).  Here is a link to all the flagship references in the shows.  My thinking has evolved over time to something more like:   The Enterprise is a famous name with a long history.  Starfleet honors that with its unique registry.  That is the ""special"" thing given to the name Enterprise. The title of ""Flagship"" is given to the newest and most advanced ships.  That is a ""special"" thing given to a ship, could be any ship.  The Enterprise-D happened to be both of those.  A first run Galaxy class ship and the continuation of the Enterprise name. The Enterprise-D got 2 ""specials"".   That is not to say Starfleet didn't plan that happy coincidence.  Maybe someone in ""bu-ships"" saw that the previous Enterprises were never ""Flagships"".  They saw that the new lead class was about to begin planning and reserved Enterprise(D) for an initial build order.  Now the Enterprise holds a special place in my heart.  I want the Enterprise to be special.  However, Starfleet is big.  Many ships and names can have impressive histories.  Kirk and the Enterprise were the most famous of that generation.  The 1701-B and 1701-C could have just been normal ships as far as the fleet was concerned.  Carrying on the name, sure.  Respected, as much as any other ship.  The Enterprise-D was a Flagship because it was one of the newest, largest, and most advanced ships Starfleet ever put out.  It also became famous, because of its crew.  Aside:  I think the implication is there could be more than one ""Flagship of the Federation"" in the fleet.  Just like there can be more than one flagship in a normal fleet(various admirals in command of different formations/groups will each fly their own flag) or the way a brand may have more than one flagship store.  I would not expect there to be many, but with such a large fleet I could see the designation going to a few top ships.  I know it is only used singularly for the Enterprise-D on the show.  I think that is because making it a plural would just be confusing/sound weird.  So each of the few flagships call themselves ""The Flagship"" even if they know there are others.  Just my own pet thinking."
DaystromInstitute,3dfquu,mistakenotmy,4,Wed Jul 15 23:07:00 2015 UTC,"Thats not really a fair comparison. Compared to the enterprise d we barely even see the other enterprises, except for kirks enterprise which most likely was not a flagship at the start of its five year mission."
DaystromInstitute,3dfquu,butterhoscotch,4,Thu Jul 16 01:20:12 2015 UTC,"True but we rarely see other ship either.  Who knows, maybe the USS Intrepid and Captain Stephen Decatur, with gallant crew, performed some of the most daring acts of the age. Maybe they are a close second to the Enterprise in deeds. Does Starfleet just not recognize other heroism the same way it did for the Enterprise?  The Federation is big, Starfleet is big, I find it hard to believe that the Enterprise was the only ship doing all the important stuff. We have a massive selection bias to love the Enterprise (We do have the Defiant and Voyager now as well).  I also think Starfleet recognizes the name Enterprise with the unique registry.  It is a famous name and it is appropriate to be so honored.  I think giving the name a second prestigious title is going one step to far."
DaystromInstitute,3dfquu,mistakenotmy,2,Thu Jul 16 01:52:01 2015 UTC,"The Enterprise-D was a Flagship because it was one of the newest, largest, and most advanced ships Starfleet ever put out. It also became famous, because of its crew.   Either E-D launched as the flagship or it became the flagship while in service. If it launched as the flagship, it wouldn't have necessarily been flagshipped because of the crew which had not accomplished much as the crew. An equally capable crew would have been previously assigned to the lead ship of the Galaxy class.  If E-D got flagshipped while in service (say, for defeating the Borg cube at Earth or some other heroics), one would think that such news would have received an on-screen mention."
DaystromInstitute,3dfquu,BraveryInc,2,Thu Jul 16 04:43:56 2015 UTC,I may have been unclear in that phrasing.  What I am saying is I think the ship was designated as a Flagship when it launched.  The crew had nothing to do with that.  The ship also became famous for what its crew accomplished.  They are two separate things.
DaystromInstitute,3dfquu,mistakenotmy,6,Thu Jul 16 05:04:40 2015 UTC,"It doesn't really make a lot of sense that the Enterprise was a flagship given what a flagship usually means.  Usually it is the vessel in a fleet where the rear Admiral would command from.  The following are all the relevant occurrences of flagship in Star Trek transcripts:  From Star Trek Generations:  RIKER: Maybe they're not out there.  PICARD: They're just trying to decide whether a twenty year-old Klingon Bird-of-Prey can be a match for the Federation flagship.  From TNG The Icarus Factor  RIKER: I'd be a fool to turn that promotion down, wouldn't I?  PICARD: I don't know, and if you're asking me what I think you should do, I don't know that either. I can spell out for you, albeit crudely, what you are choosing between. As the First Officer of the Enterprise you have a position of distinction, prestige, even glamour of a sort. You are the second in command of Starfleet's flagship, but still second in command. ...  TNG The High Ground  FINN: I need a doctor.  CRUSHER: There are doctors on Rutia.  FINN: I need someone better. I heard you were with the Federation flagship and I knew you had to be.  CRUSHER: Who told you that?  TNG Sarek  PERRIN: These quarters are quite comfortable. The Ambassador and I were very pleased when we heard that the negotiations were going to take place aboard the flagship of the Federation.  PICARD: The honour is ours.  PERRIN: My husband has taken an interest in your career. He finds it to be satisfactory.  TNG Remember Me  CRUSHER: It's all perfectly logical to you, isn't it? The two of us roaming about the galaxy in the flagship of the Federation. No crew at all.  PICARD: We've never needed a crew before.  TNG The Drumhead  SABIN: And he had confederates.  PICARD: Do we know that for sure?  SATIE: Of course he did. Do you think J'Dan could have come on board the flagship of the Federation and accomplished what he did without help from within?  PICARD: I agree it would be difficult, but not impossible.  TNG Ensign Ro  PICARD: There are other Bajorans in Starfleet. Assign one of them.  KENNELLY: I've discussed this situation with her, and I am convinced that she is the right one for this job.  PICARD: After what happened on Garon Two, she has no business serving on any starship, let alone the flagship, my ship.  KENNELLY: You're taking her, Captain. It's been arranged. I can't tell you how difficult it was to get her out of prison.  yada yada yada  There are references in DS9 to the defiant being a flagship but that appeared to primarily be a tactical designation during the Dominion War operations that Sisko was coordinating.  There is one reference from the Enterprise series about the NX-01, but it takes place in the Mirror Universe and the command structures are a bit different there.  There were no references to the Enterprise being a flagship in TOS.  What is apparent from this is that it was not just only Picard who viewed the Enterprise-D's status as the flagship.  Admirals Sati and Nechayev both referred to it as such, many of the regular officers we know at various times referred to it as such, adversaries and terrorists referred to it as such so it was highly publicized and well known.  It doesn't make sense that the Galaxy, the Yamato, or the other Galaxy class vessels wouldn't be on the same level, the Yamato mets it doom early on so maybe it was never considered.  Chronologically the first reference to the Enterprise being the flagship was the Icarus Factor, season 2, 2365, stardate 42686.4  Given some of the dialog we know about it would appear to be an honorific title that could have been awarded based on merit, perhaps even a competition or based on performance (both crew+ship).  There isn't any direct evidence of that though."

The talent of its crew is so well known and obvious they are selected for all the most critical missions. If this sounds exactly like the enterprises, there is a reason for that.  Obviously the most talent crew needs the most powerful ship to make the most of their abilities. They stand as a shining beacon to other races as to the might and capability of the federation, while serving as something to strive for to the rest of the federation and starfleet."
DaystromInstitute,3dfquu,butterhoscotch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:22:17 2015 UTC,In the real world the Flag ship is the ship where the commander of a fleet sits which commands the fleet as a whole.  The Enterprise has served in this capacity several times on screen.
DaystromInstitute,3dfquu,mousicle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:43:27 2015 UTC,"I think we first need to define what a ""flagship"" is in the context of Starfleet. In normal navy terminology a flag ship is the vessel that carries the flag officer of a particular fleet. We know from the fact that Captain Picard is not a flag officer, he's not an admiral he's a captain. And yet we hear multiple times that the Enterprise D is the ""Federation flagship"".  In this context I think we can say that what Starfleet means by a ""flagship"" is in fact the latest, most advanced ship they have available, sort of like a ""flagship product"" produced by a company. Further evidence of this is in the 2009 NuTrek Star Trek film where Captain Pike refers to the Enterprise as the ""new flagship"" even though, again, Pike is not a flag officer, he is merely a captain. He only gets promoted to admiral after the events of the film. So in each case the ""Federation flagship"" is simply the most advanced ship they have.  As to your specific question, ""was the Enterprise D the only 'Enterprise' to be the Federation flagship?"" We don't really know. We know that TOS Enterprise and the Enterprise A are never referred to as flagships. In fact, after it's refit and the V'Ger incident TOS Enterprise actually served as a training vessel! Hardly the premier position if it was technically ""the flagship"". Furthermore, it would make sense the newly invented ""Excelsior"" would be the new Federation flaghip, not the Enterprise A, as going from the definition of flagships as being the largest, most advanced ships in a generation, the Excelsior would clearly be the better choice, however Excelsior is never referred to as a flagship in canon.  Likewise with the Enterprise B and C. While the Enterprise B was a excelsior class, if the Excelsior was still active it would probably continue to be referred to as the flagship. Neither the B or C are referred to as flagships in canon.  It's likely that the Enterprise E was the Federation flagship, as during First Contact LaForge refers to her as being ""the most advanced ship in the fleet"", which, going from our existing definition, would make sense for her to be the flagship. So, to summarise:  (NuTrek) Enterprise - Flagship  TOS/Refit Enterprise - Not Flagship  Enterprise A -Not Flagship  Enterprise B - Not Flagship  Enterprise C - Not Flagship  Enterprise D - Flagship  Enterprise E - Probably Flagship  That isn't to say that Starfleet doesn't recognise and honour the name and crew of the non-flagship Enterprises. Indeed, by the very fact that the registry lives on indicates how important the name has been to the Federation."
DaystromInstitute,3dfquu,BonzoTheBoss,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:19:05 2015 UTC,"E-E is no more likely the flagship than the Enterprise A or original. The ""most advanced"" doesn't mean it was the Flagship. The USS Galaxy or USS Sovereign could have both staked that claim too, yet (at least in the Galaxy's case) they weren't the flagship.   The British Navy has a tradition of naming certain ships the ""flagship,"" these designations are more about prestige AND being advanced.   In three movies, the E-E was never implied or alluded to be the flagship, that seems rather strange given that the E-D was explicitly refereed to as the flagship in ""Generations"""

Also, warp cores get ejected from the middle of the star drive section. Why not just have an ejection port/elevator similar to that for the bridge?  As for the Klingons having a bridge on top, they go balls out and put it on a stick to lead the ship around. A focused array of phaser shots to the neck could saw it right off.   All this being said, I'm not implying that space faring races should all be flying around in Borg-like ships.

From what I remember... it was maybe a bit more detailed, the set fully wrapped around the stage for a more cinematic shooting style (rather than being an open-sided 3/4 set), and they used a darker more dramatic lighting setup (rather than the ultra bright and perfectly even lighting of the television show bridge).  It looked different, more cinematic, than the television set.  It was upgraded for the big screen.

DaystromInstitute,3de6lr,sleep-apnea,3,Wed Jul 15 21:14:49 2015 UTC,"Early spaceships had very unreliable sensors so it was important for the pilot to actually be able to see outside through a window (not to mention the psychological effect of being in a room without any windows). And, it was preferable to have the bridge on the top rather than the bottom so that it wouldn't be smashed against the ground in the event of an emergency landing (furthermore, emergency saucer section landing procedures involved using the underside of the saucer as a heat shield during re-entry). Many of these early ships did also have a separate battle bridge further inside the hull, however these were not regularly used (again, due to the lack of visibility). By the time sensors had improved to the point where windows were neccessary, shields had been invented as well so the vulnerable position of the bridge was less of a concern. In addition this allowed bridge modules to be easily swapped out depending on mission requirements (replacing science stations with extra tactical stations, or so on) without requiring a full refit. It has also been claimed that in some ship classes the bridge can detach and operate as a lifeboat for the senior officers."
DaystromInstitute,3de6lr,MexicanSpaceProgram,3,Wed Jul 15 20:27:07 2015 UTC,"There's something to be said for the psychological aspect of being part of the Federation that is at work here. From a purely tactical aspect, burying a bridge in the dead centre of the ship, under about 15 feet of hardened armour and with redundant forcefields is the best option for ensuring the safety of your bridge crew. It also doesn't represent the fact that Starfleet is primarily an exploration and scientific advancement institution that harkens back to the Age of Discovery. The bridge isn't just a place for the weapons and shields to be operated from, it's a place for the Captain and their officers to stand up, head held high, to view the horizon. It's a place for dignitaries and visitors to the ship to see the best of the Federation at work.   Functionally, this falls back to the same arguement about cloaking technology. Starfleet isn't primarily a military outfit, and their ship design reflects this."

Either with new tech during an overhaul at a shipyard, or quickly replaced due to battle damage.  I've also read somewhere (memory alpha I think) that the whole bridge can be used as a big escape pod in an emergency, but I'm not certain of that.  Additionally it makes sense for the bridge to have access to an airlock in order to get to the exterior of the ship.  You don't want to be in a situation where the bridge is totally cut off because turbolifts and Jeffery's tubes are down.  This could also be a way to evacuate to main engineering in that kind of situation."

DaystromInstitute,3de6lr,frezik,4,Wed Jul 15 17:34:43 2015 UTC,"I don't know.  Blowing up the bridge would only destroy that control location and the senior staff.  A valid target.  However, command would just go down the chain to the next most senior officer.  The ship itself can still shoot and fight just fine.  Side Note: Command might go to someone that would actually fire weapons back at the BoP (Cough, not Riker, Cough).  Someone actually shooting back at the Duras Sisters could be better for the ship as a whole.  That is hindsight reasoning though.  What the Duras Sisters actually did is target engineering.  A place that could potentially knock out multiple systems.  So over all I don't think they really chose that bad.  They did manage to destroy the ship after all. Granted it was after they were also dead...  So it may be slightly unfair to call them tactical dunces,  the target they picked was a good one."

I do recall being rather shocked at Rikers reaction and wondered how Picard would have felt had he witnessed it. I assume he became privy to it yet wasn't shown as being too shocked.  Does ones right to self ownership of ones DNA remain once the new lifeform is alive and sentient? If those clones had matured, would Riker still have killed them so easily?"

DaystromInstitute,3deph2,BonzoTheBoss,3,Wed Jul 15 22:42:14 2015 UTC,"I think it's a matter of the ""state"" of the clone in question. By this I mean the clones of Riker and Pulaski weren't yet sentient, they weren't conscious. i.e. they hadn't been ""born"" yet. Perhaps there's a legal grey area in Federation law that states aborting a clone before maturation is the same as aborting a faetus?  As opposed to the clone in DS9, which was clearly conscious and sentient and therefore had rights to, you know, not being murdered.  Or perhaps it's a difference between Federation and Bajoran law? Perhaps in the Federation, citizens have complete control over their genetic material, regardless of how it's manipulated. They can clone themselves and kill those clones all day if they wanted? I seriously doubt this though, given the value of all life the Federation seems to emphasize."
DaystromInstitute,3deph2,tsoli,8,Fri Jul 17 08:38:16 2015 UTC,"A lot of questions.     -Why doesn't the Federation find strong and effective Star Fleet officers who are able and willing to be cloned in order to augment their numbers on StarShips, especially during the Dominion war?   This cloning for a purpose is against the basic tenants of the federation.  Cloning soldiers (people expected to serve a specific task) smacks of some of the problems that we face with the Jem'Hadar and other super soldiers.     -Why don't the ultra eccentric choose to clone themselves?   A clone is not, by definition, exactly the same as the original, even if you copy all the memory engrams. From the moment they diverge, they're a new person and therefore it's nearly the same as entrusting your life's work to a stranger.  Besides, why should he live when I have to die?  It explains why Graves transfers his consciousness into a computer (data) as he continues to exist as himself instead of a copy.     why don't the Borg use this    The Borg are doing just fine assimilating as they are.  Most of their drones were raised by a separate culture, requiring much less energy than cloning and using maturation chambers.  It like why we  let cattle roam free and fatten themselves up; why hand feed them when they can survive on their own before it's time for us to cull the flock?  Besides, they actually seem adverse to clones- ""Your biological and technological distinctiveness will be added to our own.""  What biological or tech distinctiveness does a copy of a different drone offer?     Romulans   This was a terrible plan.  No one in Romulan intelligence really could have known when Shinzon was first conceived that Picard would become as important as he did.  Cloning for spying reasons is just a terrible plan, especially when there are so many other methods of espionage."

Relevant part of my OP   Most especially in the case of Graves who managed to somehow transfer his mind into Data, one could theorize he would have the means/knowledge to transfer his mind into an empty clone."
DaystromInstitute,3deph2,frezik,6,Wed Jul 15 20:22:24 2015 UTC,"In the DS9 episode ""A Man Alone"" both Ibudan, a civilian without medical training, and Bashir make clones. The clones are exact and have the memories and personality of the original, and grow to completion in a few days. Cloning is not portrayed as particularly difficult or complicated.  Moreover, the Dominion make extensive use of cloning for political and military benefit, so it is definitely a valid working strategy.  I assume the Federation have moral and/or legal problems with cloning. Problems so severe that even during war they are unwilling to compromise and use cloning when they're happy with using cloaking devices."
DaystromInstitute,3deph2,bowserusc,3,Wed Jul 15 19:47:26 2015 UTC,"The reaction in that episode also seems at odds with Voyager's Demon, in which the crew willingly allows themselves to be duplicated. The Silver Blood aren't quite a perfect biological copy, but they're close and they also duplicate experiences. The copy is so perfect that, eventually, the Silver Blood forget where they came from and resume Voyager's own journey.  Up the Long Ladder also shows that there are problems with making a copy of a copy, so clones aren't viable over the long run. Federation science wasn't making much headway on the issue. The colonists of Mariposa didn't solve it, either, and they were well educated, had about two centuries to try, and had a strong incentive to solve it."

Clones are not generated full grown.  Clones do not maintain their ""sponsor's"" abilities or memories.

DaystromInstitute,3deayj,drafterman,8,Wed Jul 15 17:40:37 2015 UTC,"The obvious answer is that the original Americans that were abducted passed down stories of their abduction to their descendants. The Skags look a lot like humans, but there are some superficial differences that would remind people of their alien nature.  As far as the knowledge of 19th century frontiersmen, I don't think it would be hard for them to deduce that they were on another planet. The differences in stars, lack of a moon, and distinct geology, geography, and flora and fauna would tip them of that they weren't in Kansas anymore.  The idea of aliens living on other worlds dates back to antiquity (at least as far back as 150 AD). But what specifically about the American ""Wild"" West? Well, there are UFO reports that date back to that time frame and location. Also, this is the time period of Jules Verne, which would include science fiction material of this genre accessible to the general public.  So it is not out of line to suggest that mid-19th century American frontiersmen would have the concept of other planets with alien life and to then deduce, based on stories from their ancestors (and cursory observation of their environment), that such a place is where they were."

I mean the Goa'uld got their asses handed to them by early 21st century humans, they would get demolished by 24th century humans.    As far as actions taken against the Goa'uld, that depends on the federation views the humans.  Are they slaves kidnapped from Earth or are they part of the civilization of the Goa'uld?  What about the rights of the Goa'uld? Eventually, they would probably come around to fighting with the Goa'uld since the Goa'uld would be drawn to the superior technology of the Federation.  Remember, in SG-1, it was never a priority to free the slaves under the Goa'uld, the priority was protecting Earth.  If slaves were freed along the way, great.  Notice in the SG-1 episodes, that they never encouraged a civilization with useful technology to bury the gate (The Nox being the exception).  But any civilization with no useful technology that was subject to the Goa'uld would be told to bury the gate.  So like I said, the priority was Earth.  I propose that at first the Federation would ""look the other way"" at the Goa'uld, but as soon as the Goa'uld started acquiring federation technology and hosts, then conflict would arise.  I don't think the Goa'uld would ally with other species in the Alpha quadrant because those species would be useful hosts too.  A Klingon host would be a serious adversary in combat.  The federation and perhaps Klingon allies would easily defeat the Goa'uld."
DaystromInstitute,3ddnvb,ndrew452,3,Wed Jul 15 15:37:43 2015 UTC,"Maybe not. The stargate universe has everything the star trek universe does. Matter transporter? Check. Variety of energy weapons? Check. Shields? Check. FTL travel? Check.Cloaking? Check.  How the battle would turn out depends very much on the minute details of each system. Whose shields are better? What is the maximum output? Whose energy weapons are better? Do they have ZPM's?  From a purely appearances standpoint I cant say whose shields are better or if their energy weapons are equal. Hatak's can put out an impressive amount of fire power with something like a dozen plus rapid fire hard points on their ships. Are they as strong as phasers? Stronger? Who knows really.  The people of the stargate universe at least have a better grasp on combat it seems. Heres another fun question, would the Daedalus wipe the floor with the enterprise with their infinite shields and matter shredding energy weapons?"
DaystromInstitute,3ddnvb,butterhoscotch,5,Wed Jul 15 21:25:31 2015 UTC,"Both universes do possess equal technology, but the Gou'ald did not have access to such technology, or if they did it was of a lower quality.    I have always looked at Star Trek (TNG+) tech as equal to Asgard tech of the SG-1 universe.  The problem with Stargate is that the technology advanced exponentially throughout the series, where in Star Trek, it advances less drastically.    I based my post on the tech available to the majority of the System Lords.  Standard Ha'tak class spaceships.  Cloaking is available but that was really only on transport ships.  I think the Enterprise could easily defeat a Ha'tak class ship, but I do not think it could beat an Asgard ship.    Now what throws us for a loop is if a Goa'uld like Anubis comes along.  If such a Goa'uld possessed knowledge of the ancients, then he would win against the Federation, though probably still lose to the combined forces of the Alpha Quadrant.  Anubis was not beaten in a head on battle, but through tactics and it does seem like the humans of the Federation are a bit rusty when it comes to stuff like that.    As for the Daedalus, who knows.  The humans at the end of the series were elevated tech-wise to the Asgard levels which means that they would be equal if not superior to Federation technology."

DaystromInstitute,3ddnvb,butterhoscotch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:45:04 2015 UTC,"Well, we know the standard Ha'tak shields are capable of easily repulsing naquada enhanced nuclear warheads (""SG1: The Serpents Lair""), which I'd argue were maybe the equivalent to a lower-yield photon torpedo. But that was only against two warheads, a full spread of max-yield photon/quantum torpedoes may give them pause.  I also wouldn't say the weapons of a standard Ha'tak were that powerful to be honest. We've seen Goa'uld motherships bombard a planet from orbit before (""SG1: The Warrior"" and ""SG1: The Sentinel""), the impact at most would throw people into the air, not destroy entire buildings or starships. It's possible of course that the mothership pulse weapons have variable yield, in Stargate: Continuum we see Ba'al's fleet bombarding Earth and destroying entire cities, BUT in that timeline Ba'al had developed Anubis' advanced weapons (as we saw from his flagship) AND there appeared to be multiple ships bombarding a single area at the same time, so I'd still argue that Ha'tak standard weapons aren't anywhere near as powerful as phasers or photon torpdoes.  I agree, however, that it wouldn't be a clear cut fight. As noted, a Ha'tak's shields are on par with or even stronger than standard Federation deflector shields. While their weapons may not be as powerful, it would still take a long while to wear down their shields and disable the vessel."
DaystromInstitute,3ddnvb,BonzoTheBoss,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:30:56 2015 UTC,"I always assumed when they were using planetary bombardment they were intentionally narrowing the yield of their weapons. Their goal being not to destroy, but to enslave and to steal basically."

It would be in his interest to wipe out as many traitorous Jaffa as he could because the fewer left alive the less likely they would be to recruit more.

For FTL communications, the Goa'uld appear to be limited to low-resolution analog communications orbs, while the Federation ships have a subspace communications network.  The Federation has sensors that can distinguish individual humanoids from LY distances, while the Goa'uld can barely pick out life signs on their own ships, even though they could navigate really far.   A well-coordinated swarm of mediocre AQ ships of whatever variety would suffice."
DaystromInstitute,3ddnvb,BraveryInc,4,Thu Jul 16 05:09:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's as much conflict with the prime directive as you think there is. Consider that all humans on other planets were originally brought as slaves for the goa'uld, as part of an existing post-warp society. Even on planets where the goa'uld have long been gone, the political structure of the planet is still technically goa'uld (certainly by any treaty the goa'uld would negotiate).  For this reason, I don't believe the prime directive to apply to transported human colonies, since they're actually refugee/slave colonies in a larger post warp society."

One of the main tactical advantages from Stargate the Goa'uld had was they could bombard Earth from Space...  in this case that would be nullified...  since the second they would get anywhere close they would be greeted with phasers, as well as Photon and Quantum torpedos.    Though Stargate and Startrek had some similar occurances... like both dealt with Aliens,  enemies and exploring...   one of the main driving forces in Human vs Goa'uld was the fact that initially (of course that changed over the course of the series) was that Earth humans were technically advanced for humans... but their tech level was well below the Goa'uld...  only until Earth started building fleets of massive warships could they really fight toe to toe with them.   until that point Earth relied more on the Asguard and and allies to protect them... and when they met Jaffa offworld they relied more on battle tactics ,  and hit and run tactics to score wins.  The second these primitive humans saw ""gods"" come down on spaceships.. the prime directive is tossed ... because they already know there are ships that travel to other world and more than just themselves exist."
DaystromInstitute,3ddnvb,androidbitcoin,2,Wed Jul 15 14:06:35 2015 UTC,"A very flip comment here is that the Federation, of any era, would easily dismantle a Goa'uld empire because they're simply buffoons.  They're squabbling, petty tyrants sitting on fragile empires built of fear and violence.  Simple contact with advanced humans would expose the Goa'uld as false gods and their empires would crumble overnight.    Though I will say this seems like a pretty good premise for an episode."

I'm wondering if the Goa'uld would be petulant enough to outright attack the Federation, once it was obvious the kind of superior fire power they had. (Though I somewhat contest that; it's been stated numerous times that the ground impact strength of a Ha'tak battleship is equal or greater to a tactical nuke. The Tau'ri ships can only go toe to toe with a Ha'tak thanks to Asgard shields, so that's hardly 21st century human tech. I would argue Ha'tak fire more like photon torpedoes, but as pure energy, have dozens of launchers, and rapid fire capability. Though granted, no guidance. Dumb fire only.)  It sounds more reasonable they might temporarily ally with (or subjugate) the Kardasians, and upgrade their ships with modern phasers and photon torpedoes (provided the latter is necessary, see above) but wouldn't out right attack the Federation, not right away of course. And the Feds don't typically start wars. And even if a particularly trigger happy individual System Lord were to start something, the Goa'uld don't share a common government. Like you said, they're rivals, barely at layers of temporary peace. Would the Federation hold accountable all the other System Lords for the actions of one?  I could easily see them establishing colonies on uninhabited M class planets unclaimed by the Federation, or subjugating un-contacted pre-warp planets. Whether or not the Fed would step in on that is an interesting question. Many in the upper brass wanted to avoid a conflict with the Jem'Hadar, and that was a much more immediate threat."

DaystromInstitute,3ddnvb,KingofDerby,2,Wed Jul 15 22:28:02 2015 UTC,"What about for the Goa'uld themselves, who require hosts as part of their evolutionary life cycle?   Well, the interesting thing is that the Goa'uld don't necessarily have to be evil. It's just that they have a genetic memory of all their predecessors, and their predecessors were megalomaniacal jerks.  The existence of the Tok'ra shows that it's more of a cultural/force of habit thing than anything, though. If the Goa'uld weren't obsessed with the idea that their race was inherently superior, with a right to be worshiped and a right to rule the galaxy, there would be nothing stopping them from becoming productive and accepted members I think.  The Trill aren't exact analogs, I think they're not that far from what would happen if the Goa'uld got over themselves. There are plenty of people who actually want to become hosts, with more volunteers there are symbiotes in fact. So I think a parasite/symbiote race can easily fit within the Federation - the problem with the Goa'uld is their (lack of) morals, rather than their physiology.  As a genetically engineered slave caste that can't become hosts themselves, the Jaffa do pose a problem. However, it seems like the kind of issue that could be fixed with some technobabble. The Goa'uld, who are not scientists in any way, were able to create them as a race of incubators - surely the Federation would be able to create non-sentient incubators, given a little time.  Overall, I think that if push came to shove, the Federation would win any open military conflict. It actually wouldn't surprise me if the Goa'uld tech were more advanced (in its own way), but the System Lords are not a unified front. They're addicted to scheming, betrayal, and putting style over substance. They'd be fighting each other as much as they fight the Federation, and when faced one-by-one they're a manageable threat (as seen by the success Earth had against them.).  More, their technological advantage (if there is one) comes from stolen tech. Outside of a couple examples we never see Goa'uld scientists, to the point where it's questionable whether or not their species even understands the scientific method. We never see their technology advance, unless it's just the (re)discovery of Ancient tech. If the Federation is able to survive long enough to adapt, they will triumph - and they'd almost certainly survive long enough to adapt, given the inefficient and internecine nature of Goa'uld culture.  If the Goa'uld actually presented a unified, well-organized front from the start, it's hard to say who would win but maybe the Goa'uld. Hyperdrive makes warp drive look like a cart being pulled by a mule. It would've taken Voyager decades to return from the delta quadrant, meanwhile hyperdrive ships can travel between galaxies in just days or weeks. Starfleet doesn't have the resources to defend every world at the same time, and any world without a permanent defense force is completely vulnerable to hit-and-run tactics.  If they got their act together (which is deeply out of character), the Goa'uld could theoretically end the war before it even began. How would the Federation handle a first strike that, say, destroyed the home sun of many important member races (including ours)?

During review of your application, extensive screening was carried out as part of our standard procedures to ensure that you are not Klingon Borg Tribble Other (please specify): Artificial being bent on slavery and destruction.  However, further testing is required to verify the validity of your claim.  This testing shall consist of Trial by Combat Interview with Betazoid Dance-off Other (please specify: Turing Test and chess against Bobby Fischer.  Also, your nominated reference for Federation citizenship (NEELIX) has been found unsuitable.  Can you ensure that a reference in good standing is provided promptly for our verification.  Sincerely,  Robert Fox  Federation Cultural Affairs Officer."
DaystromInstitute,3dcyz0,fleshrott,3,Wed Jul 15 09:22:05 2015 UTC,"Dear Robert Fox,  Am I to understand that Klingons are disqualified from being recognized as sapient in the Federation?  While I am aware of the contentious nature of the relationship between yourselves and the Klingon Empire, you must surely recognize that you do not need to like someone to recognize the fact of their sapience."
DaystromInstitute,3dcyz0,jbcatalyst2,3,Wed Jul 15 10:04:07 2015 UTC,"Dear Impacatus,  The reason that ""Klingon"" is included on our standardised form is that many of them that have applied to our office after suffering severe cranial trauma after participating in the Bah't Qul challenge.  While we understand the need to treat the mentally feeble with dignity and respect, it becomes taxing after they have rendered themselves unconscious against a forcefield whilst screaming about Tribbles and Blood Oaths.  The form has been amended several times - the last instance being when one of our junior attaches added ""Horta"" to the list, and all we found of him were dissolved bits of bone and teeth, with the cryptic message ""smart I am"" etched into the bulkhead with acid.  The error was then rectified (with some promptness, I might add).  Robert Fox."
DaystromInstitute,3dcyz0,jbcatalyst2,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:16:43 2015 UTC,"Also, Sentience isn't taken away from the many biological species that have had conflicts with the federation. I'm not sure why being evil would be relevant."
DaystromInstitute,3dcyz0,jbcatalyst2,5,Thu Jul 16 15:28:08 2015 UTC,Sapient is sapient.  If they're evil or break the law they should get the same due process and right to trial as anyone else.
DaystromInstitute,3dcyz0,jbcatalyst2,2,Wed Jul 15 12:53:02 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't really seem weighty or groundbreaking if the only reason why an EMH was a ""person"" was because of a technical disagreement between publisher and author. The arbiter in the episode also said he wasn't prepared to decide, as well."
DaystromInstitute,3dcyz0,terrymcginnisbeyond,6,Wed Jul 15 09:51:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, but my point is it shouldn't have been a decision at all.  The arbitrator wasn't prepared to make a decision that would set a precedent with far-reaching consequences, but the precedent should have already been set at that point in Federation history."
DaystromInstitute,3dcyz0,terrymcginnisbeyond,2,Wed Jul 15 10:01:43 2015 UTC,"Unless it was fairly recent that something as technologically groundbreaking as an EMH was developed; Dr. Moriarty was an accident, but still sentient, and only one, or the first... sprite? It's also probable that there's not many sentient holograms calling for equality yet, but once that critical mass is reached, deeming them sentient wouldn't be too far off."
DaystromInstitute,3dcyz0,terrymcginnisbeyond,5,Wed Jul 15 10:23:06 2015 UTC,"That's why they should have a test of sapience that's less ""What material are you made of?"" and more ""Are you capable of X, Y, Z?""  Having to have a big dramatic trial every time they encounter a new type of lifeform is just inefficient.  These questions should have been settled a long time ago."
DaystromInstitute,3dcyz0,terrymcginnisbeyond,3,Wed Jul 15 10:25:37 2015 UTC,"Very true. However, The Doctor was allowed to expand and grow beyond his programming, as well as Dr. Zimmerman's holographic assistant, Vic Fontaine, and the holograms the Hirogen created. These holograms were intentionally programmed to be smarter than the sum of their programming (Moriarty was designed to beat Data, which was an accident, but still sentient). All of them are already sentient, and they also grow in the series, as well, which proves ""personhood."" But to tell other Federation citizens that these holograms are ""people, too"" might be a little controversial; Janeway, for example, even said that The Doctor was more like a replicator than a person. She changed her mind, but how many others are willing to?  Also, every time they encounter most life forms, they're already travelling at warp, already able to talk, designed by evolution, etc. These holographic people, though, were programmed, made in their designers image, and as they were kept ""turned on"" long enough, grew into sentience. That might be why it's difficult to recognize sentient holograms as people."
DaystromInstitute,3dcyz0,Willravel,3,Wed Jul 15 10:41:30 2015 UTC,"That's a good point.  I suppose one thing that might have worked against the holograms is they were superficially very like the presumably non-sapient holograms used for recreational purposes.  Although... do we have any proof that those holograms aren't sapient?  They believe that their simulated realities are real, but within those realities, they seem ""human"" enough.  And if they are sapient, does that imply the computer system that created them might be, too?"
DaystromInstitute,3dcyz0,Willravel,2,Wed Jul 15 10:47:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think the holograms for recreational purposes are sentient; a metaphor would be an RPG game of today: you know you're in a fake world, but NPC's have a list of responses to your responses and actions in the world they populate, so thankfully the Orion Slave girls in Quark's bar aren't. Presently, there's a lot of controversy surrounding games where you kill people (pretty much, 90% of all games). Once you create a game (or hologram, or Oculus) designed to have sex with caricatures of women or men, and have the ability to kill these caricatures, there's going to be some disgust from people who look down on that."
DaystromInstitute,3dcyz0,Willravel,3,Wed Jul 15 10:52:27 2015 UTC,"I don't know.  In Voyager, Janeway's Leonardo Da Vinci seemed capable of adapting to new situations.  Granted, it's still possible he has a list of responses, but it must be a very long list, then.  (Going to bed.  Nice talking.)"
DaystromInstitute,3dcyz0,Willravel,5,Wed Jul 15 10:57:24 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it would be helpful to have benchmarks of what is sapient or not.  New species would have to 'prove' sapience to the Federation, or be considered animals until they can, and on the other hand creatures that demonstrate some intelligence could then be considered sapient and intelligent when they're probably not, such as the Borg (as they appeared in TNG) or the Crystalline Entity.  It's probably better for beings to self identify to the Federation as sapient, rather than the Federation going around trying to put every species they encounter to some kind of litmus test based on their ability to show human style 'sapience'.  /u/MexicanSpaceProgramCrewman makes a point that Picard in Measure of a Man comes up with some kind of criteria, but even then his argument isn't on the crux of Data meeting that criteria simply that Data believes he meets that criteria, and forcing Data to 'prove' this, when it's self evident is wrong, and to invalidate Data's belief is to suddenly designate anything that can't prove it's sapience as either an animal or property.  Data and the EMH are also quite different from the beings encountered by Earth, Humans didn't invent the Denobulans or the Klingons etc, they already existed, were already in space and already showed equality with human style intelligence. Data and The Doctor on the other hand were designed and built by humans, so ultimately their intelligence comes from humanity, and could either be a sign of true intelligence or simply some smart pseudo-AI, in other words a clever OS on a dumb machine, but the only test that can really be applied to them is 'do they believe they're sapient' and if they do, do they feel they have certain rights usually applied to sapient beings, if the answer which I believe both Data and the EMH would give is 'yes', then should the Federation deny them that belief?"
DaystromInstitute,3dcyz0,pm_me_taylorswift,2,Wed Jul 15 09:03:29 2015 UTC,"It's absolutely fine to place the burden of proof on those disputing sapience*, but there still needs to be a way to come up with an objective answer one way or the other.  The test you provided, that of whether or not they believe they're sapient, is basically a tautology.  The question then becomes how do we determine if someone/something has a capacity to ""believe"".  Saying that they're sapient isn't enough, otherwise a piece of paper with the words ""I am sapient"" written on it would have to be considered sapient.  Proving they think they're sapient requires you to prove they can think.  EDIT:  * Actually, maybe not.  You're be requiring them to prove a negative."
DaystromInstitute,3dcyz0,pm_me_taylorswift,3,Wed Jul 15 09:13:29 2015 UTC,"But surely in the infinite worlds depicted in the Trekverse there are more kinds of sapience than simply the 'human' type.  The silicon beings in the TNG episode Home Soil or TOS episode Devil in The Dark were hugely different from humans, but ultimately were able to convey their feelings and views to The Federation.    What would have happened on these planets had the Federation decided that they weren't showing enough proof, the continuation of the pillaging of the resources of the planets where these creatures lived?  What if one of the energy / God beings with a more evolved sense of sapience decided humanity weren't showing enough proof of sapience, in the way Q did, would it then be moral to say humanity doesn't reach the mark and can be treated as chattel?    And even the Q continuum didn't seem to have a strict criteria, deciding instead to have humanity jump through different tests, all designed to specifically test humanity, there didn't seem any evidence that Q was following a set universally applied criteria the Q used on all species, so why should the Federation?   If a species or individual has the ability to convey its beliefs, demonstrates intelligence and wants to be treated as sapient, what should the Federation do, make the species complete a multiple choice questionnaire? Some kind of Rorschach test?  Wouldn't that kind of test be open to abuse?  The Federation probably knows it wouldn't be fair and could be subject to abuse too, and generally The Federation are supposed to be the good guys who respect their own laws, so if someone came across a planet filled with herbivorous octopus people who communicated by dancing with ferns, but they happen to also be on a valuable high quality dilithium planet, then really a greedy or unscrupulous person could just say 'hey sorry guys you don't count as sapient beings, even though you 'ferned' your conviction you're sapient, I don't agree, so sorry, I'm going to slaughter you all now, take your land and strip mine it, please make your way to the slaughter house'.    I just don't think a test would be helpful in the case of proving alien intelligence, and even if the burden of proof was put on the Federation itself to disprove sapience, who would be the ultimate impartial arbiter of these cases?  And if the Federation decided they had proved that some alien or android wasn't sapient, and the party being held under scrutiny disagreed, then what?"

Exactly why you need a consistent definition of sapience that covers whatever form it might take.   If a species or individual has the ability to convey its beliefs, demonstrates intelligence and wants to be treated as sapient, what should the Federation do, make the species complete a multiple choice questionnaire?   That's a test right there!  The qualifications you require to skip the test are a test.  This is the second time you've suggested a test while arguing that a test isn't needed.  Surely, there is a need to be able to determine that you can drink that cup of raktajino without being convicted of murder?  Even a very basic test like the ones you have suggested would be better than nothing."
DaystromInstitute,3dagh6,Arcaness,30,Tue Jul 14 19:28:46 2015 UTC,"Here are some of my basic assumptions:  (1) Klingons probably don't last very long against the Borg AND the Hirogen. Klingons are great fighters, to be sure, but they tend to be prone to suicide strikes and going out in blazes of glory. While those sorts of tactics might work against the Cardassians, I think the Hirogen and the Borg are too canny for that.  (2) The Hirogen have shown themselves to be formidable warriors, but I believe they're more of a hunter culture than anything else. While I think they help smash the Klingons, I don't see them taking the entire board.   (3) The Dominion stomp the Cardassians pretty hard here, but I'm not sure they can take the board. Their empire needs a LOT of logistical support so they can breed Jem Hadar and grow their ketracel white. The scenario you've given makes it a bit difficult to determine whether they would have that sort of access. Assuming it's merely a ship-to-ship fight, without control over planets, I'm not sure that they last the entire time.  (4) The Federation's greatest asset is its diplomacy. It outmaneuvered the Romulans with an alliance with the Klingons. It outmaneuvered the Dominion by uniting the Alpha Quadrant powers. I don't think they'd have that advantage here, so I'm not sure how far they get. Their ships are powerful, but generally not built solely for warfare. I think that gives them a disadvantage in the late game.  So I think it essentially goes something like this:  (1) Borg focus on assimilation of the Klingons to build up their numbers.   (2) Klingons do some heavy damage to both the Hirogen and the Borg, but focus too much on headlong charges to be effective, they get taken out fairly early.  (3) The Dominion are able to take out the Cardassians and the Hirogen, but without a steady supply of Ketracel White, they stumble.  (4) Romulans martial their resources and are able to keep both the Federation and the Dominion away from their border with cloaked wolf-pack attacks. The Dominion begins losing steam between those attacks and hunting by the Hirogen.  (5) The Federation makes a good go of it, but can't advance into Romulan space without getting ambushed. They decide to establish a neutral zone by using a tachyon grid, which effectively keeps that border clear.  (6) The Breen are canny enough to recognize the threat from the Borg and go after them first. But the Borg begin expanding deeper into Klingon-Hirogen-Dominion-Cardassian space.  (7) By this point, the Borg probably have enough ships assimilated that they'll be able to sweep the Romulan-Federation-Breen factions off the board, especially at a free-for-all.   Fundamentally, I think to have a chance to defeat the Borg, you would need to have them surrounded by the Dominion/Federal slices. Any other slice is too weak and will serve as assimilation fodder. Once that happens, it's game over."
DaystromInstitute,3dagh6,CallMePlissken,7,Tue Jul 14 19:59:38 2015 UTC,"I disagree with several points. For one romulans maybe be able to execute hit and run attacks but we dont know enough about their tactics or even their numbers to make any further assumptions. We know they are technologically even with about everyone else and they have the ability to build mighty warships, but they may not.   Worse then that the dominion has shown equal cunning in wiping out the Tal Shiar as well as breaking through cloaks every now and then, as have most races at least once (tachyon beams anyone?)  Finally we only know of what 3 ships in the romulan arsenal? Id say they are a bit behind the other powers in that department, whether it be the ridiculous dozens of federation ships or the somewhat small cardassian and klingon fleets."
DaystromInstitute,3dagh6,butterhoscotch,2,Tue Jul 14 23:28:01 2015 UTC,"D'deridex, Valdore, and Scimitar being the three modern-era ships were know of?"
DaystromInstitute,3dagh6,spillwaybrain,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:02:06 2015 UTC,"affirmative.  Those three ships alone almost make up a pretty competent battle fleet. D'deridex making the backbone of the fleet as cruisers. Supporting heavier and lighter ships with covering fire and forming a firing line of heavy, consistent and punishing fire. Valdore could be used as fast attack craft for hit and run attacks and flanking and the scimitar could serve as battle fleet commander, anchoring the battle by soaking up hits and dealing up major damage."
DaystromInstitute,3dagh6,butterhoscotch,10,Wed Jul 15 10:09:00 2015 UTC,"Borg or Dominion for winner.  I'd go:   Borg Dominion Romulan Federation Klingon Breen Hirogen Cardassian   Borg are a force of nature, they have numbers (even with your restrictions), a high tech-level, and drive.  The Dominion have numbers too, and tech, and a drive to win.  The Founders and their forces would likely prove tough to assimilate, though, so they could still give the Borg a run for their money.  However, in the end, they will cut their losses if things start getting too bad.  The only reason the Romulans don't steamroll the Federation or Klingons is due to the Fed/KDF alliance.  With that broken, their superior cloaking tech and less-than scrupulous morals will put them on top of those three.  The Klingons lose here due to their tendency to glorify martyrdom leading to more losses than needed.  The Hirogen are nomadic, and have no centralized government.  They wouldn't be a real threat to the actual big players.  The Breen are more feared as mercenaries, but among the smaller players, they have the tech to win.  They don't pose much threat against the bigger guys due to lack of manpower, and their big trick having a known fix.  The Cardassians lose due to being broken after the Dominion War.  Dropping them in this battle royale at this time would be like doing the same with Japan in the 60s."

DaystromInstitute,3dagh6,daeedorian,5,Tue Jul 14 22:59:42 2015 UTC,I'm sure they could have gotten it working if they had kept developing it. Instead of letting it since in an asteroid for 20 years.
DaystromInstitute,3dagh6,Numlocks,2,Wed Jul 15 02:55:10 2015 UTC,I am willing to bet that good old Section 31 has that tech tested and ready to go. When the situation gets dire they will bust it out.
DaystromInstitute,3dagh6,StuffDreamsAreMadeOf,3,Wed Jul 15 01:52:26 2015 UTC,I doubt it would be isolated simply to Section 31. That's the sort of technology any high ranking military officer would keep around just in case.
DaystromInstitute,3dagh6,Caelum_Cantorus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:19:58 2015 UTC,Agreed. They would definitely hold on to what they had but I have some doubts that they would continue to develop the tech which still had some kinks that needed to be worked out.

And what about the Federation, their best trait has always been their diplomacy, would they be allowd to make an alliens in this situation?

DaystromInstitute,3dagh6,CallMePlissken,3,Tue Jul 14 19:49:46 2015 UTC,"I have a question: even though you've organized the map in such a way, do the races retain a memory of past historical events and animosities or is it a fresh slate? I think this would be important based on the powers you've placed next to each other.  For example, the Federation and Romulan Empire are enemies in canon, but without the history of the war and the past experiences, would they be so aggressive towards each other? Not trustful, but there's no ""bad blood"". Their technology is similarly advanced, and in this board if they combined their resources they would be much more formidable against the other players. They have advanced technology, the ability to mobilize large defensive and offensive fleets of warships, have the logistics and man power to support these operations, and have the ingenuity to adapt to new circumstances (such as the Federation developing shields against the Dominion's polaron-based weapons).  Similarly the Hirogen and Klingons placement is interesting. They may have some cultural attitudes that are compatible. However, their prowess in combat as well as the Breen's is very dangerous when you consider their proximity to the Borg. None of these races are known for their technological abilities: the Klingons advance at a glacial pace, the Breen have sophisticated technology but it's not clear that they can develop countermeasures quickly, and the Hirogen are so scattered that they lack the infrastructure or even society to develop new anti-Borg tactics and defenses. Races like the Romulans and Federation and Cardassians have shown themselves to be much more technologically inclined, and the Romulans and Federation both have experience with the Borg (at least they did in canon). If/when the races neighboring the Borg are assimilated, the Borg gain an incredibly powerful army with lots of combat experience AND in the case of the Klingons proven tactical drones.  Also I feel that the Borg would have an easy time assimilating the Dominion, or at least, its administrative structure. I'm not sure if a changeling can be assimilated (but I bet the Borg would love to find out), but we know that the Borg have the ability to create assimilation viruses and deploy them in a planetary atmosphere. Considering that the Vorta and Jem'Hadar are clones, developing a virus to infiltrate their immune systems and begin the assimilation process should be exceedingly easy for the Borg: they have assimilated many civilizations with advanced genetic-manipulation techniques (including Ichib's race)."
DaystromInstitute,3dagh6,Lucius_Martius,3,Tue Jul 14 23:16:13 2015 UTC,"Only three in that list would be capable of winning what you describe.   the Borg would probably win in an all out attack because of their superior numbers, technology and grim decisive action in unison. They have technology of thousands of species and no moral qualms to do whatever it takes to secure them the victory. You don't provoke the borg. the Dominion could also win because of their genetically improved soldiers and contrary to what /u/CallMePlissken wrote, due to their logistical finesse. They set up cloning facilities and white-factories within months in the alpha quadrant, and Jem Hadar pretty much don't need anything else to gestate, live and fight. In an all out war, without any wormhole shenanigans, they could push their front-lines relentlessly, just expanding their territory until all other factions are defeated. The founders do not have to worry about allegiance, order and control over their empire, no matter how big it becomes. Let's face it, they only lost because they were dependent on access to the wormhole which the wormhole aliens denied them. In a lengthy, drawn out war with an open broad front-line the dominion would have all the advantages. the Federation could also win because they have 'something special'. Q was always going on about humanity being special, even surpassing the Qs in the end. They have the will to fight and the compassion to fight and die at the side of other species and inspire the same will and compassion in these other races in the process. They would unite all other non-war powers (and probable even one or two war factions if it was possible) of the galaxy and liberate them one-by-one, simply because there is no other option to survive. This might sound romantic, but the series and movies have shown this over and over and made a big theme out of it. Remember Soval's speech about how humans frighten vulcans with their tenacity and versatility."
DaystromInstitute,3dagh6,giantsparklerobot,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:09:23 2015 UTC,"To defend my point on the ketracel white issue, it was established in ""Statistical Probabilities"" that the Dominion need at least one unreplicatable precursors to the white. And despite having access to large swathes of the Alpha Quadrant, the Dominion was running on a shortage of white without access to supplies from the Gamma Quadrant. So I'm not positive that it would be as easy for them to establish a supply.   Of course this really depends on the details of the fight. If the board in OP's scenario is the size of the galaxy, then I think the Dominion have a solid shot. If it's just 40 ships each, then that's another scenario entirely. I'm just not entirely sure the Dominion would be able to sustain a large-scale fight without a pretty hefty logistical base."

I completely agree. It is their strength, but if they cannot play it out, it is also their weakness. What good is a drug that ensures total control and food supply for your whole army if you have no way of manufacturing... especially if without it your troops will die."
DaystromInstitute,3dagh6,calgil,3,Wed Jul 15 18:15:19 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go with the Federation coming out on top. I see them being the overall winner for (possibly) unorthodox reasons. One huge advantage I think the Federation has is every member of Starfleet seems to hold duty to a greater good over just about everything else.  This feature of Starfleet I think lends itself to the best exploitation of other strengths of the Federation. I will come back to this idea in a moment.   Here's where I veer off into unorthodoxy. In a no holds barred free for all where every opponent offered an existential threat to every citizen of the Federation, I think they could get downright vicious. Deep in the bowels of Memory Alpha are the plans for the Genesis Device, particle fountains, metaphasic shields, tachyon grids, Dr. Soren's star killer, and even genetic augmentation (like Bashir's). In a total war situation I could see the Federation (or Section 31) busting out all of these. In this scenario they would also not be bound by treaty from using cloaking devices of their own.   Besides putting all production in the Federation on a war footing they could also impress all merchant shipping. The Federation's commercial and industrial might could churn out war materiel and trained (maybe augmented) personnel on a massive scale. Their massive communication and transport networks would also allow for very streamlined and effective logistics.  This is where I come back to Starfleet personnel's sense of duty. The structure of the Federation and the nature of Starfleet means subdivisions work like the larger unit and can operate independently with parallel purpose. Fleet A will defend one border while Fleet B defends another but neither needs top down direction from Earth. Fleet B would come to the aid of A with no direct orders to do so. This is not something I'd see the other factions readily doing.  Earth was a lynchpin in the TV show for dramatic reasons but would not be the key to the Federation's power in an all out fight. If some faction blew up Earth it would just make the rest of the Federation fight harder. So the Federation I don't see being as fragile and Earth-oriented as the show might tell us.   So we have a large and highly advanced industrial powerhouse churning out a fighting force that is as comfortable working independently as in groups. They're backed by a highly effective logistical network. To top it off they can build devastating super weapons and have shown a will to use them.  I see the Federation launching cloaked decapitation strikes on the more centrally managed factions to let infighting weaken them. They then pull the diplomacy card to align with these weakened powers to go up against the stronger individual threats. Against the Dominion they just attack the supply lines of Ketracel White and convince the Hirogen that the Jem'Hadar would be awesome prey to hunt.   The Breen are shown to be opportunistic so deep strikes against their homeworld and colonies would likely get them to cut their losses. I think the Breen would back off the Federation if they saw a couple big worlds Genesised to death. Especially since that process would completely ruin that world for future Breen habitation.  In a straight up fight the Borg would be a challenge but with defeated factions as fodder and fleets full of augmented science genius tacticians the Federation would do well. Once the battles were over and the dust settled the Federation would just extend olive branches to everyone. They'd form some mutual defense and reconstruction pacts and dominate through cultural and economic hegemony. With the belligerent factions of the defeated powers dead or demobilized each could become charter members of a larger Federation."
DaystromInstitute,3dagh6,Koeida,3,Wed Jul 15 13:07:59 2015 UTC,"The only flaw I see here is that one of the criteria set is each of the factions behaving as they actually do.

DaystromInstitute,3dagh6,Twilight_Ike_Galaxy,2,Wed Jul 15 14:33:47 2015 UTC,"I'm going to defend /u/giantsparklerobot 's analysis here by assuming that rule does allow for a reasonable and logical evolution of a power's methodology in the circumstances. The Dominion War was a relatively short fracas and though the Federation was on the back foot, there was never the time for doomsday - options to be explored, or even a more militaristic attitude to develop. This all out war sounds like it may take a good while, perhaps decades to finish, given sheer numbers and resources involved. I think in that time Federation attitudes would change, and Section 21 would come to the fore - as we only began to see during the Dominion War. Starlet has a devastating depository of powerful tech...Once they start putting that tech into play, the tide turns very quickly. Of course a smart opponent - and I think both the Borg and the Dominion realise this now - would curbstomp the Federation before that could happen. Those two could then clean up the rest of the board."

DaystromInstitute,3dagh6,taw,2,Wed Jul 15 00:15:34 2015 UTC,"If it takes place right after Voyager, then the Romulans, Federation, Klingons, Breen, Dominion, and especially Cardassians would still be recuperating. Voyager ends only about three years after the Dominion War, so the aforementioned factions wouldn't be in a position to challenge the Borg. So if it were between the Hirogen and the Borg, I think that the Borg would win due to the fact that they assimilate their victims, which builds up their numbers so greatly that the Hirogen wouldn't stand too much of a chance. Plus, the Borg's adaptive technology would neutralize Hirogen weapons before they can do enough damage to destroy the Borg."
DaystromInstitute,3dagh6,taw,2,Wed Jul 15 01:59:47 2015 UTC,"Nothing in war is fair.  The borg would win eventually given enough time. They simply, easily, out class any of the other races, even combined.  The borg are an existential threat to how ""humanoid"" civilizations work, and live, that is completely incompatible with the other races listed here.  While the federation, romulans and klingons blugdeon each other to death over the course of 10 years, the cardiassans are absorbed by the dominion who, come pouring through the worm hole and then begin to attack the federation from the other side as they fend off the two front war against the klingons and romulans.  The hirogen show up late, but then start looking for the best fight, and probably would go up against the breen or jem hadar.  Mean while, 20 years in to it, 1000 borg cubes show up, and systematically annihilate and assimilate core world after core world.   They wouldn't just send 1 ship to earth, and 1 ship to each homeworld... They, thinking long term as a species (what we don't) would say ""Ok, this will take 100+ years, and none of the original 'crew' will be alive, but thats not how we think about things anyway..."""
DaystromInstitute,3dagh6,taw,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:26:12 2015 UTC,"We've seen in Voyager how one stranded federation ship can wreck entire entire quadrant. Now multiply that by however many ships they have. Federation has such a ridiculously overpowered track record, there's no doubt they're going to win. The only reason Federation doesn't control the whole galaxy and whole timespace continuum for that matter yet is how peaceful they normally are. Here we are in free for all mode, so their only weakness is gone.  Without Federation, the Borg would probably win - no matter what you throw at them, they'll just adapt and use it against you. You'd need to be extremely careful to not let them assimilate even one person on your side, but that's just unrealistic.  Third would be Dominion by just pure numbers.  Everybody else are just minor players. Klingons would get wrecked as most reliant on brute force and honor - they'd probably get manipulated into doing something really dumb by anybody with better political sense as happens over and over. Hirogen are not even a real power unless I completely misremember everything, so that's even weaker.  Ordering of Romulans, Breen, and Cardassians is fairly arbitrary.  So ranking:   Federation Borg Dominion Romulans Breen Cardassians Klingons Hirogen"
DaystromInstitute,3dagh6,taw,2,Tue Jul 14 22:42:39 2015 UTC,"As I've said in another comment, Federation always wins when we follow the main characters. Off screen, they're just another power like any other that can and does get wrecked. Before the Romulans joined, they were losing the Dominion War, and the casualty reports continued well after the Romulans joining. Then things were looking grim again the moment the Breen joined up. Memory Alpha has this to say about the Breen:   the Breen were one of the most underestimated races inhabiting the Alpha Quadrant.   Also, without Voyager's intel the Borg probably would have wrecked Earth in their invasion of 2381 even more than they did; which is to say total annihilation. The invasion already killed 63 billion Federation citizens and destroyed over 40% of Starfleet. Clearly the Federation isn't as invulnerable as you make it sound.   I wouldn't say the rest are just minor players because they use different tactics. They still all have the same number of ships, and we know Klingons aren't as brutish and stupid as they're sometimes portrayed for the sake of plot; again, like with the Dominion War casualty reports, there are plenty of off screen mentions of decisive Klingon victories. Same goes for Romulans, but they tend to be more discreet and devious.  Hirogen never got sufficient expansion to determine just how numerous they were or their political standing, but as far as combat goes they've proven to be more than effective. Their victories probably come down to how often hand-held firefights start."
DaystromInstitute,3dagh6,taw,4,Tue Jul 14 22:56:00 2015 UTC,"You can go by what is said (Worf is a total badass, Breen are so underestimated etc.) or by track record (everybody can beat Worf). Track record should win over what people say every time.  Klingons have been manipulated into doing other factions' bidding by Federation, Dominion, and Romulans multiple times. They have track record of being really really bad at this. In 1-vs-1 war they'd have some chance, but in 8-way free for all, they'd just get wrecked, even if they'd have ""won"" a bunch of glorious battles on the way, only to be wiped out by a virus or civil war between Changeling puppet Klingon and Federation puppet Klingon.

It's shown or mentioned the shows or it doesn't exist.  As for canonical things Federation did off screen, did they ever lose anything? They started from 4 world, then offscreen expanded to over 150 planets. All offscreen between Enterprise and First Contact. And nobody can seriously doubt that Federation will incorporate other alpha quadrant powers given some time. It is insane rate of expansion, all mostly peaceful.  If your question was about a pitched battle between 10 ships from every side, then the answer would be different, but in long term conflict there can only be one winner."
DaystromInstitute,3dagh6,williams_482,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:30:29 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're talking about the entire existence of the Federation, where most of their territory is obtained through peaceful, voluntary admission and their policies are just. In that case, I don't disagree with your assessment. The Federation will be more long lived or at least more powerful than its aggressive or reclusive counterparts.  But in a war with no chance or hope of diplomacy and with peaceful admission of territory out of the question, their more aggressive counterparts are just as (if not more, considering their lack of Federation ethics) capable of acquiring territory. And it was the Founders who, when the Dominion had to retreat their entire fleet to Cardassia, described the Federation as ""timid"", who would best like to leave them alone now that they were significantly weakened. The only reason they didn't was because they couldn't afford to let the Dominion rebuild or have a foothold in the Alpha quadrant, and they still weren't happy about making that choice. I think in the situation I'm pitching, they wouldn't be out there sending all their ships to the front like the Klingons or Dominion might, they would primarily be on the defensive or would want to focus on keeping the Borg in line.  This isn't a battle between 10 ships from every side, but it isn't a situation that panders to the Federation's usual way of doing things either."
DaystromInstitute,3dagh6,BenMcLean,3,Wed Jul 15 00:04:09 2015 UTC,"On the contrary, wars are times where diplomacy shines the most.  Federation diplomacy was ridiculously powerful weapon during Dominion War. Can you even imagine how ineffective would Federation be if they just went ""hurr durr just ignore diplomacy and send ships to battle their ships""? It's 8-way war. Obviously there's going to be temporary alliances and truces and diplomatic maneuvering, and Federation would try to undermine other factions from within - something that seems especially easy to do against Klingons.  They don't need any plot armor or time travel or Q connections or tendency to come up with scientific breakthrought at moment's notice or anything like that for it - and they have all those tools as well.  Federation would win this easily. Borg and Dominion are the only possible contenders and Federation defeated both on camera."

I want to see who would win in a battle royale; no truces, no cease-fires, just combat, and you have to admit the Federation doesn't win every fight they get into (sometimes they're deceived, or ambushed, or run into something unexpected, or maybe just don't have enough firepower).

This isn't a particularly important question for most of the listed powers, as all they have are dedicated warships. For the Federation, however, there is a huge difference between their multipurpose cruisers like Galaxies and Nebulas, and their dedicated warships (or at least more combat-focused ships) like Defiants, Akiras, and Sovereigns. With the former, the Federation is probably somewhere in the middle group, but with the later I think the Borg and possibly the Dominion are the only ones with ships good enough to go toe-to-toe with a fleet of the very best the Federation can throw at them."

DaystromInstitute,3dagh6,uss1701jb,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:51:17 2015 UTC,"I'm going with the Federation. The original post doesn't say anything about not forming alliances once the game starts, even if they're temporary. Even in books like the Hunger Games, tributes formed alliances in order to be one of the last few standing. (I'm just using HG as an example. I don't count fan fiction as cannon. Neither does CBS.) There's absolutely no reason (unless you say so) to believe that the Federation wouldn't talk their way into and out of multiple situations that give them the upper hand. A deal with the Romulans and Cardassians to take on less negotiable factions like the Borg, Breen, and Hirogen. The Cardassians still have bad blood with the Dominion, so the Fed could agree to help take them down in exchange for an alliance until the end. The Romulans would probably agree just so they can stab the backs of the Fed and Cards in the final battles before the alliance breaks down. This move will also cause the Fed and Roms to move away from the Breen, both of which are vulnerable to the energy dampening weapons.  The Borg would probably annihilate the Klingons before they could really do anything considering it only took one cube to decimate Wolf 359. The battle over Earth would have been completely different if they had just sent a second cube. Fed ships are some of the toughest while Klingon ships don't seem to be very durable at all. The only way I see the Klingons not being the first or second faction to get completely knocked out is if the Breen energy dampening weapons work on the Borg and considering how advanced they are, as well as how quickly they adapt, and how many races they've already assimilated, I don't see that happening. The Borg will annihilate the Breen as well. Other than the energy dampening weapon, their ships and tactics are pretty standard. The Borg can take a lot a punishment and fighting a two sided war, even with smaller numbers, could still see their way out, though they'd be in very bad condition.   The Hirogen probably won't fare much better than the Klingons simply because they're not warriors. They're hunters. Hunters are not used to being hunted so they would either move quickly to attack the Klingons, exacerbating the problem against the Borg, or moving against the Dominion, which the Cards, Roms, and Fed have agreed to take on with the alliance I think they will form. If the Hirogen move against the Klingons, then the Dominion either chases them or faces three factions at once.   Once the Borg, Klingons, Hirogen, Breen, and Dominion fight themselves to death, the Cardassians will probably turn on the Romulans before the Romulans turn on both the Fed and Cards. The only reason why I see them doing this is because they've done so before. While they hate just about any other race that isn't Cardassian, they do have respect for their enemies and I think they would dislike the under handed tactics that the Romulans are famous for. So, they'll betray the Romulans, giving the Federation the final upper hand. The primary advantage that the Romulans have is cloaking, to which most other factions have figured out how to see through. Even if they have scimitar-class cloaks, they would need an entire fleet of them to take on both the Cards and Feds. If that's the case, then there could be fleets of Sovereigns, Defiants, and Keldon-class ships (which also have cloaks).   Federation ship may not have cloaking technology but that seems to be their only general disadvantage (unless you include the Breen, but that's not a fed specific weakness). They're all fast (even Galaxy-class ships hit warp 9.8, other races seem to be hampered by mass), durable (Voyager, a science ship, survived a ""year of hell"" and 7 real  years in deep space. The Nova-class Equinox, another science vessel, was also stranded and survived for 5 years before Voyager, another Fed ship, destroyed them.), and extraordinarily powerful (Galaxy, Sovereign, and Defiant-class ships make it look easy) even when they're just ""exploration"" ships. Federation officers are also very resourceful, which, when added to the diplomacy, makes them the top.   Or maybe none of this makes any sense because a free for all with 8 factions is an insane amount of variables to consider."

She also understood that the horrors her crew experienced were not aimed at them intentionally. It was just an accident that they happened to be passing nearby while it was malfunctioning.

Remember, the flute something that Kamin had apparently been playing (or trying to play) for some time before Picard ""joined."" That flute seems like a logical choice as a memento, as it seemed like the most likely individual object for any person to become attached to. The fact that Picard ultimately did spend a lot of time playing the flute was never a guarantee.   Remember, Picard-Kamin took years to stop searching for the Enterprise and start a family. He spent a huge chunk of his time wandering about in the hills and searching for ways to prevent or deal with the droughts. He taught his children to value science and reason above all, which from what I could see wasn't exactly a core tenet of the Kataanian (sp?) culture which he was there to experience. These seem like somewhat curious things to deliberately program into the simulation, but they mesh very well with what we know about Picard.

There is Starfleet Intelligence and Starfleet Security, which other powers almost certainly know about.  Section 31 is something of a rogue agency. While it has high tech, there probably aren't very many people involved, allowing them to keep a low profile. It also means they have to pick and choose their battles, reducing the number of interactions that would lead to their discovery. It also means they can spend more training on avoiding detection and/or resisting torture and other information gathering techniques.  They also rely heavily on external parties under their sway (Bashir, Admiral Ross, Koval), further distancing themselves from discovery. People that actually know about Section 31 that may report on them would probably come across as crazed conspiracy theorists."

DaystromInstitute,3d7a0u,BigTaker,2,Tue Jul 14 15:32:57 2015 UTC,"Perhaps it bears more examination, but I thought that DS9 left it just ambiguous enough to suggest that it was entirely possible that Section 31 was soley the work and creation of Sloan."

I imagine Starfleet Intelligence checked out Odo, acquiring plenty of info on his biology and composition, both from the research on Bajor and Doctor Bashir's scans. Sloan takes these files and finds some genius scientist thinking of the bigger picture. Either that, or Starfleet already had some stage of the virus ready, just in case they would need to infect Odo.   Infecting him was easy enough, since he was infected at Starfleet Medical either though an invasive method (collecting some genetic material) or in a gaseous form."

They cite section 31 of the Star Fleet charter as their legal reason to exist, which means they consider themselves part of Star Fleet. There is at least one Admiral who is giving them orders, which may have been Ross in the DS9 time period. More explicitly, it's Marcus in the JJverse."
DaystromInstitute,3d7a0u,frezik,9,Wed Jul 15 03:53:36 2015 UTC,"Despite Odo's comparison between them I think the Obsidian Order and Tal Shiar fill more roles than just intel and black ops. They also preform internal security duties.   Making it known that the same guys that do intel operations in Klingon/Federation/other territory is also the same people that  will be watching you and black bagging you if you step out of line would be enough to make someone want to tow the line.  On the other hand, Section 31 seems to be mostly focused on external threats like the Dominion, Romulans, and others. This does conflict with some beta cannon stuff in the ""Time to..."" series, but those were also very extraordinary circumstances.   Plus, Federation society seems to be somewhat complacent and high on their own mighty principles. The government wouldn't want it to be known they had men who would violate those principles to defend them."
DaystromInstitute,3d7a0u,Ubergopher,7,Tue Jul 14 02:11:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure it's all that clear that Section 31 really is focused chiefly on external matters; that may just happen to be the context that the audience encounters them in.  As you say, the very idea of Section 31 would be deeply unsettling to the Federation at large, and to me it seems entirely possible that they may simply prefer to put their fingers on the scales when necessary.  After all, even in the external contexts in which we meet them, they attempt to influence matters by coopting or intimidating Julian Bashir in secret.  As for the Tal Shiar, it's always struck me as interesting that their first appearance aired just a few months after a German court unsealed the Stasi's records.  The Tal Shiar and even moreso the Obsidian Order have always struck me as likely drawing their inspiration from the Stasi."

They are such massive parts of everyday life in a militarized culture as well. I imagine the nazis would have had a tough time claiming the gestapo didnt exist as well.  Starfleet intelligence however does not make big scenes or rely on their reputation for cruelty. IF they do their job right, they get the info and you dont even know they were there. They are simply known as starfleet intelligence. Section 31 is a separate organization, likely still funded by starfleet but separate allowing them to be as morally reprehensible as the romulans or cardassians while leaving the federations squeaky clean."

DaystromInstitute,3d7a0u,butterhoscotch,5,Wed Jul 15 10:05:35 2015 UTC,"Because they rarely come out of the shadows unlike the other intelligence agencies.  Also the Tal Shiar/Obsidian Order are more like the KGB of the Soviet Union, acting both as an intelligence agency and an internal security force.  They are common knowledge because fear of them keeps the populace in line.  The Federation has no need for an internal boogeyman to keep its citizens in line."
DaystromInstitute,3d7a0u,TLAMstrike,4,Tue Jul 14 02:11:12 2015 UTC,"The Obsidian Order and the Tal Shiar much like Starfleet Intelligence are overt agencies. Their existence is officially sanctioned and part of the public record, they have a government supplied budget, an office building and a recruiting office. In theory these agencies report to the government and have government oversight.  Section 31 is a covert agency, its existence is purposefully kept hidden.  The Obsidian Order/Tal Shiar are like the CIA or FBI  Section 31 is like the Men in Black."
DaystromInstitute,3d7a0u,Sly_Lupin,3,Tue Jul 14 17:58:47 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that the Romulan Star Empire and Cardassian Union are both police states. And that the Tal'Shiar and Obsidian Order are their respective secret police forces. They're well known because they're very active and fairly public--if the average citizen was not well-aware of their existence, they would have no point in existing in the first place.  You can't rule by fear, after all, if your subjects don't know who you are.  So while the Tal'Shiar and Obsdian Order require some degree of visibility to function, Section 31 does not. Actually, the reverse is true. The more people know about Section 31, the less well it is able to function.  Which is why the easiest way to get rid of Section 31 is to do the one thing no one on DS9 ever thought of doing--simply tell EVERYONE all about it."
DaystromInstitute,3d7a0u,Berggeist,2,Tue Jul 14 12:57:48 2015 UTC,"The Obsidian Order and Tal Shiar are more public knowledge, to the point where they can make power grabs. Section 31, on the other hand, is much smaller, kept much more secret and apparently has little in the way of physical bases."
DaystromInstitute,3d7a0u,disposable_pants,7,Tue Jul 14 02:14:41 2015 UTC,Section 31 may not even be a continuously running organization -- it may only manifest when a critical mass of high-ranking Federation officials feel that their morals are putting them in grave danger.
DaystromInstitute,3d7a0u,Sly_Lupin,4,Tue Jul 14 02:57:33 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting idea, but I don't see it working in practice. The people who form Section 31 are very much of the sort who coined teh axiom, ""Eternal vigilance is the price of freedom."" They have a great deal of power, a very powerful sense of duty and necessity, and thus (I think) would be loathe to ever relinquish any of that power.  Remember: the Federation is a huge state, and has been in a near-constant state of war since its very founding. Since before its founding, if you want to count the Interplanetary League and Earth-Romulan War."

As an example, I don't see Admiral Cartwright and his co-conspirators as part of Section 31 (in part because that'd be an obnoxious retcon to me). However, I'd be somewhat comfortable if a retcon had Section 31 having simply ensured the right people will meet each other and letting them take it from there. Of course, ideally I'd like no Section 31 involvement in Star Trek 6."

DaystromInstitute,3d79my,ademnus,10,Tue Jul 14 01:55:36 2015 UTC,"This is just a basic overview of the colonization process, of course, and obviously it can differ from world to world.  Step One: Discovery  The explorer cruiser, USS Erikson, is tasked with finding suitable colony sites - and it finds a planet-containing system in the new Federation-owned sector. A quick subspace scan discovers that there is an M-Class World orbiting a stable star, and the Captain decides to take a look. Erikson establishes a stable orbital pattern above the planet and begins making detailed scans - the initial subspace readings are confirmed. It's habitable!  Twelve hours after arrival, a large away team assembles on two of the transporter pads aboard Erikson and set foot on the planet. Ground surveyors confirm an abundance of flora and fauna in multiple different ecosystems across the globe, complete with running fresh water with minimal pollutants. There's a tussle with a space-lion in the savannah, and one of the redshirts is beamed to sickbay, but otherwise it goes smoothly. At this time, the Captain orders the art department to make landfall and begin painting colorful rainforest and grassland sets in preparation for CBS camera crews.  Later, at the nearby space station-turned-starbase, Erikson's Captain logs the habitable world in the system and mentions it to the Admiral in command. The next day, at the colonist leader breakfast, the Admiral mentions this handy dandy M-Class world and rattles off its nice features. Everyone is hooked.  Step Two: Clearing a Swath  The biggest problem colonies seem to have is getting their ass kicked by space pirates, the Borg, regional powers, the Grox, whatever. To combat this, the Galaxy-class cruiser USS Andrew Jackson warps into the system, fresh from Earth Spacedock, and it's got a map full of pirates, charged phaser banks, and a cargo hold filled with space-bubble-gum.  Even if the sector is generally Federation-owned, there may still be questionable bandit hideouts, nearby rogue installations, or space stations with less-than-satisfactory security protocols. As such, Andrew Jackson sets off throughout the area, stopping questionable cargo freighters for ""surprise contraband checks"" and blowing them out of space. Obviously, it'll all follow Federation rules - the smugglers are always the ones who shoot first, yada yada yada, but the point is, Andrew Jackson is cleaning up the local space. Subspace beacons are launched on the sector borders to indicate that the zone is officially Federation space, and anyone who crosses the Federation border (no doubt bringing crime and drugs in the words of Admiral Donald) would be subject to Federation law.  Within days, all questionable activity in the area ceases or goes deep underground. Neutral worlds within the Federation sector (if they're allowed to be contacted) are given fair notice of the colony's existence and are invited to drop by for tea and trade some day. Andrew Jackson jets off to the colony system and waits in geostationary orbit for the colony ships to arrive.  Step Three: Landfall (again)  Andrew Jackson drops three beacons onto three suitable areas on the planet's most temperate climate region, all within 100 miles of each other. Such beacons usually land in river valleys, coastal plains, or resource-rich areas. A few hours later, four ships warp into the system and fall into a steady orbit of the system. Three of the ships carry colonists, and one carries a bunch of space-Caterpillar equipment for earth moving and combine harvesting and all that good stuff.  To have a sustainable gene pool in a population (one that, say, won't go Habsburg on you) a colony should have at least 150 individuals to start with. The Federation plays it safe, and brings 1,800 men, women, and children - with the promise of more if the colony does well. Roughly 600 people go to each town-site and do their thing, bringing with them luggage, replicators of various sizes, and materials for temporary housing.  Meanwhile, in orbit, Andrew Jackson celebrates a job well done. Nobody died on this leg of the colonization mission, so it's time to head off to some planet away from the heart of the Federation and its rules. Shore leave time! Crewmen and officers begin replicating stocks of Hawaiian shirts, grass skirts, sandals, and leis - that is, until the Bridge comes on the PA system. The Captain announces in a serious tone (while the first officer and tactical officer can be heard snickering in the background) that the shore leave is to be held on the colony world, and all crewmen and officers are expected to help out with the settling process.  The colonists begin detailed nutritional analyses of the local grasses, berries, and phasered wildlife. A couple of the plants and animals are edible, but the rest are either useless or poisonous/venomous. DNA samples are taken for safekeeping while other colonists start flattening a couple nice fields - several miles out from their town centers, of course - for farmland. Grains and stuff are planted, and a small plot of land is dedicated to growing some of the indigenous edible plants.  Meanwhile, Starfleet officers from Andrew Jackson begin flying down in shuttles, hauling loads of deuterium, anti-deuterium, replaceable parts for fusion reactors, an industrial replicator or two,  stuff like that. Each town begins setting up basic infrastructure with the help of the officers (who begin moving earth for the construction of roads towards the other settlements).  All that happy hippie crap continues while Andrew Jackson rendezvouses with the colony ships SS Hepburn, SS Stewart, and SS Alda to begin the spacework. A weather control satellite is immediately put into orbit, although its instructions are only to intervene if a tornado or threatening storm comes close to a settlement - after all, the colonists haven't had time to figure out how the planet's weather even works. Astrometric probes and communications relays launch as well, either brought along for the ride or freshly constructed by the Federation ships. The relays set up in orbit, allowing better communications between the folks on the ground and the nearby starbase (plus on-planet intercontinental phone calls for one low flat rate!) so that nobody has to strain their combadge batteries quite so hard. The astrometric probes do...astrometric probe things, I guess. It's probably important.  Mineral surveys are conducted of the entire planet, nearby moons, and asteroids in the general vicinity. Turns out, a couple of the local astral objects have valuable ores and minerals! Yay! The colony is directed to begin asteroid mining as soon as the colony gets a working full-time spaceport. Other cool stuff happens.  At one point, a giant silicon crystalline snowflake thing pulls up to the planet, but Andrew Jackson transmits a picture of General Andrew Jackson in military regalia holding a pistol over a resonating carrier wave thing. The crystalline entity pauses for a second, and observers on Andrew Jackson's bridge watch in amazement as the entity quivers in fear, then flees.  Anyways, after about two weeks of nonstop work on the planet, the roads between the sites are finally set up, there are working field hospitals under the auspices of a certain Captain Pierce from Starfleet Medical, and work crews are beginning to set up permanent housing for residents. The crew of Andrew Jackson begin beaming up, twenty at a time, save for one not-so-lonely officer who is stopped by the town magistrate, with a phaser shotgun in one hand and a young lady in the other. The officer applies for a resignation from Starfleet and settles down on the planet, muttering something about having to get catering and a band for some event.  As the colony ships gather at a rendezvous point to warp, Andrew Jackson launches one last little present - an orbital defense relay, equipped with 150 photon torpedoes in storage - just in case some unpleasant fellows try to conduct a raid in the future. All the ships warp out.  Stage Four: Regional Influence  Colonies can do great on their own, don't get me wrong. But it helps to get to meet the neighbors, or at least just get a supply line going. After a few months, the colony has taken full advantage of the edible flora and fauna indigenous to its world, and has begun packing edible animals and grains in stasis containers for shipping. By now, the settlements have agreed to build one primary spaceport in a nice, wide, field. It's big enough to support constant shuttle traffic, and in an emergency the tarmac can support the weight of an Intrepid-class ship's landing struts. Soon, the colony is ready for trade.  Federation supply ships begin warping into the system, trading fusion reactor fuel for exotic wildlife. A few begin loading cargo from the colony's asteroid mining ventures, with the intent of hauling valuable un-replicable materials to Utopia Planitia Shipyards. A few neutral worlds join in, doing some basic trading as well. The spaceport is a booming hub of activity, and immigrants begin settling in to a fourth village on the outskirts of the main colony system. Everything is going peachy.  Step Five: Oh, God DAMN IT  After a good long while of nothing-bad-happening, something strange appears on the colony HQ's radar. There's a massive ship approaching. Some people think that it is a supply ship come to bring the long-promised super-strength unreplicable double-ply to the colony.  IFF sensors come back empty. All subspace sensors turn towards the ship. It's massive...not a Federation design either. It is...cube shaped in nature. The defense satellite gets off two good shots before it is blown out of the sky. The colony sends a distress signal. The colony administrator turns to his security chief, somberly.  ""So much for the Jouret IV Colony,"" he says. It's the last thing anyone there ever says.  The Enterprise arrives three days later. ~"

DaystromInstitute,3d79my,flameofmiztli,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:07:22 2015 UTC,How did I not notice this for three days straight?
DaystromInstitute,3d79my,Detrinex,2,Sat Jul 18 17:47:37 2015 UTC,"I think the short answer is a combination of patience and planning.  Every planet is going to be somewhat different in many ways, but federation citizens deserve a certain quality of life.  That means highly organized waves of colonists.  If Starfleet found an M class planet that was perfect for colonization I would put a starbase near by in order to deal with unexpected situations.  For example a farming planet might not have enough doctors."
DaystromInstitute,3d79my,sleep-apnea,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:36:39 2015 UTC,"Economically it would be better to think of colonization in terms of sectors rather than individual planets. Initial surveys of systems within a sector would identify the number of systems with candidate planets, orbit and basic climates of planets, obvious potential hazards, etc. After a sector is deemed promising then a second wave of surveys would be necessary. This would be to identify potential settlement locations, cataloging flora and fauna, terraforming considerations, raw resource quantification, identify any local sentient species or neighboring ones, and other more in depth studies necessary for adequate preparation in addition to sociopolitical and military defense concerns.   Once a sector is given the green light you are right that the first step is the construction of starbase. This would be first inorder to establish a resource pipeline to settlements (in terms of both labor and capital concerns).   The first settlement expeditions would start as that starbase became operational. These would focus on the rapid establishment of basic infrastructures probably in the form of prefabricated facilities. Colonists in these first steps would need to be an especially hardy breed of Federation citizen as the conditions would be harsh, the work taxing, and the customary Federation support sparse and remote.   Once this foundation is established then the waves of other colonists begin which are comprised of specialists versed in developing that infrastructure to take advantage of the local resources with the goal of making the colony as self sufficient as possible.  After that the last few waves of colonists goal is to exploit and export the resources that were targeted in the initial planning.  Once this begins the colonization process is more or less complete and changes to managing an established settlement.  This process likely takes decades or even generations depending on the economic priority of the sector or individual settlements. It's definitely a complex logistic arena with many settlements on several planets in different stages of development. The starbase itself will continue to develop as the nerve and shipping center for the sector."
DaystromInstitute,3d6q14,sigurbjorn1,13,Mon Jul 13 23:19:38 2015 UTC,"I see it as analogous to ""what distinguishes a state of the United States from, say, Canada?""  The state is part of a larger whole, receives economic, trade, and military benefits, while Canada receives certain considerations, maybe a bit of trade, military backing in a pinch, etc.  Maybe not the best analogy, but the point is there."
DaystromInstitute,3d6q14,KalEl1232,2,Mon Jul 13 23:23:03 2015 UTC,"Hey, great point! It just seems that there are more distinct differences between the races than the states, the states are kind of bound together by culture, etc etc. Hell, canada could join the US. The american government would probably celebrate. What makes the Klingons different than the vulcans? The vulcans are part of the federations, the klingons are not."
DaystromInstitute,3d6q14,Berggeist,3,Mon Jul 13 23:35:47 2015 UTC,"Compare Texas to New York to Michigan to Georgia. There's a general culture linking them, sure, but there's plenty of differences, so much that there's kind of a major cultural scuffle going on in the States right now over not so little things like a certain battle flag.  Now imagine absorbing a country with a lot of inhabitants that wouldn't want to be absorbed and its own cultural issues, like French Canadian issues, Maritime province culture or those living in Nunavut.  Unification is nowhere near as simple a prospect as you're making it sound, even between neighbours. The issues and controversy surrounding Vulcan and Romulan unification efforts alone are evidence of this."
DaystromInstitute,3d6q14,disposable_pants,2,Tue Jul 14 02:08:29 2015 UTC,"Another difference between US states and foreign nation-states in alliance with the US is the ability to opt out of a decision.  US states have signed up for going along with the US even if 100% of their population disagrees with the broader policy, where there's a lot more self-determination with foreign nation-states -- if Canada really didn't want to fight in a war on the US's side it wouldn't have to."
DaystromInstitute,3d6q14,Neo24,2,Tue Jul 14 02:54:05 2015 UTC,"The Federation members are bound by common culture - Federation values. And adherence to those values and willingness to be a part of a single common political structure (a federal state or something similar) that furthers them is what separates the Klingons from the Vulcans.  Also, a pet peeve of mine. Races/species aren't part of the Federation, just like ethnicities aren't part of the EU or UN or the USA. States are, and these states can (and mostly do) roughly correspond to an ethnicity/species, but they don't have to. A species can live in multiple states (human-settled Mars is a separate Federation member different from United Earth in the novels) and multiple species can live in a single state (imagine a large Federation world colonized by immigrants from different species)."

DaystromInstitute,3d6q14,DirtOnYourShirt,3,Tue Jul 14 05:38:11 2015 UTC,"Quick note here... I didn't intend to start on a rant about the geopolitical nature of the Federation but it grew that way, so sorry if it becomes a lecture.   The Federation is a republic based democracy where each member world enjoys representation on the Federation Council.  They act as representatives of their world and have the power to vote on such issues as war and taxation, while also enjoying certain benefits, such as economic assistance, Starfleet defense, technology, etc.  The Klingons enjoy an alliance which allows them autonomy to conduct their own affairs, but really it's more akin to a mutual defense pact with a bit of trade tossed in for good measure.  The Klingons are allowed to tax their own systems and guard them according to their own wishes, with the Federation being unable to do anything about it, though political pressure can still be placed to try and sway actions the Federation does not agree with.  Prior to the Dominion War, the Klingons broke the treaty by revoking their signing of the Khitomer Accords, which among other things was a non-aggression treaty between the two.  While there wasn't an official war when the treaty was first signed, it did end the long Klingon-Federation Cold War that had been brewing since we first met the Klingons in TOS: Errand of Mercy, when the Organians stepped in to end the war before it could become very bloody.  What sets it apart from the treaty with the Romulans would be that the Federation doesn't enjoy any diplomatic ties to the Romulan Star Empire prior to the treaty being lifted during the Dominion War.  All trade, in fact, was illegal due to the embargo.  Romulan Ale and other contraband often bypassed the border, but it was due to smugglers and neutral parties, but there were no official ties to the RSE prior to this.  The Dominion War probably necessitated a mutual defense pact between the two, but whether it allowed permanent trade and diplomatic ties remains unknown.  The Cardassians are a complicated mess, one we're not going to get into here.  Sufficed to say, it's a sticky situation and no doubt one that the Federation isn't too happy about.  And finally, there's the numerous tiny little outposts throughout the galaxy where the Federation is either welcomed with open arms, a cautious glance, or a phaser in hand.  Those are also a story for another time.  That's all for now, so enjoy, and Live Long and Prosper."

Guam and Puerto Rico are under the authority of the US government, the US handles their defence and foreign affairs, US law applies there. They're basically highly autonomous colonies. Their equivalent would be something like Federation colonies without representation on the Council. Federation allies like Klingons OTOH are fully independent sovereign states."

DaystromInstitute,3d6xro,Berggeist,7,Tue Jul 14 01:14:52 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's both - perhaps Hugh, and his individuality, which did cause a small number of drones to break away, is something that interacted on a genetic level, or was in some way influenced by genetics. Perhaps Unimatrix Zero is a lingering after-effect.  Of course the obvious issue is what kind of genetic abnormality is going to influence so many different species. Maybe it's a sequence which is common in many species seeded by one of the factions or species which involved itself with seeding, influencing or transplanting life.  Maybe it's an issue with any genetic alterations the Borg might do. Maybe the Queen, as you say, is bluffing, and it's much more serious than that.  As far as spreading to the delta quadrant, that's one of those things you can have some wiggle room on. Maybe Hugh and his breakaway faction were those most strongly influenced, but the actual issue is more insidious and long running. To put it another way, it's like removing a tumour, only it's too late and the cancer has begun to spread and further tumours are likely."
DaystromInstitute,3d6xro,Berggeist,2,Tue Jul 14 01:47:58 2015 UTC,"Perhaps his nano machines somehow were altered by brainwave patterns that shouldn't be in an assimilated drone, and their subspace updates helped it propagate through the Collective? Maybe only individuals who had the potential for those patterns were later affected, with the program running dormant?   This could explain the genetic abnormalities as well as Hugh being the originator.  Edit: There is history of the Queen manipulating individuals such as Data in First Contact, so the bluff still isn't off the table."

Essentially, the drones, while communicating constantly with each other ""exist"" in this separate subconscious reality. And just like the Matrix has glitches, like an imperfect equation, which needs to be corrected with ""the One"" - essentially a number, which compensates for the imperfection, so does the Collective. It needs to have an imperfection in it, in order to function. I guess it is a side effect of gathering separate minds, each with free will together. Sometimes the free will creates a bug. And if allowed - it can spread."
DaystromInstitute,3d6xro,Sen7ineL,2,Tue Jul 14 08:03:14 2015 UTC,"Not a bad way of putting it at all; it does make me wonder if there are ""subcollectives"" established when assimilating a new species or something, so that the effects on the Collective can be observed in the hopes of preventing a rapid spread of something awful. Maybe the re-emergence of his individuality is that something awful, but because he was already assimilated he never went through another quarantine, and by then it was too late.

DaystromInstitute,3d6xro,ObjectiveAnalysis,2,Tue Jul 14 11:24:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think of it as a necessary imperfection but rather as a undeniable variation. According to quantum physics, there is no such thing as certainty, only probabilities. Therefore, even if you bring an algorithm to a point where it's almost perfect, there will always be a fraction of a chance, that it will not work. (Yeah, I just applied quantum physics to mathematics). This is why the machines would never perfect the matrix. They would eventually reduce the chance of ""Neo"" to almost zero, but never eliminate it. Same goes for the collective consciousness of the Borg, if you look at is as a very complex mechanism/algorithm.  So to answer your question: What reason is there to absolutely need an imperfection?  The truth is - it's in the very nature of the universe. :)"
DaystromInstitute,3d6xro,4mygirljs,2,Tue Jul 14 11:58:05 2015 UTC,"Just because the probability of the imperfection is non-zero, does not guarantee it will happen though. Your argument only proves that the potential for the imperfection will never be eliminated.   Therefore, even if you bring an algorithm to a point where it's almost perfect, there will always be a fraction of a chance, that it will not work.   Are you a programmer? After millennia of advancing their assimilation techniques, I'm willing to bet that the Borg have eliminated all of the bugs from the process. The only unknown would be the biological makeup of the drones. If there is a fault, that's where it would be, which is confirmed by the 1 in a million done that carries the gene to access Unimatrix 0."

Hitler, who was obsessed with superweapons, loved all of these projects and approved tons of them, but it was up to Speer to approve funding and materiel. He rarely did, simply because they were often stupid and a waste of resources; it is speculated in the book that if he had, the Axis would have been bankrupt and the war would have been over sooner.

So having been reduced to even more of a ceremonial thing propped up by a small regional culture, what would they be like?

The moniker ""Royal Navy"" reflects its origins, not its current status. The British Army does not carry the ""Royal"" prefix because it was founded during Cromwell's Commonwealth, even though it is now formally led by the Queen. London was rebuilt after WW3, and many historic monuments were reconstructed exactly as they were in order to provide the sense of continuity that the British value so highly. The Federation is fundamentally an egalitarian meritocracy. They don't seem to mind cultural quirks like inherited titles, but any kind of hereditary power is anathema to the values of UFP. The monarchy at present has little power, but it has some and the concept of a hereditary ""king"" or ""queen"" is always going to be loaded with regressive symbolism.

It's possible someone somewhere is very proud that they were conceived in a castle.  On the other hand, Deanna Troi clearly doesn't really care about any hereditary titles and if anything is embarrassed by it all. She wants to distinguish herself through her achievements in her own career. She's not a full human, so it doesn't add any weight to the possibility of existence, but it does give an explanation as to why people may not really get into it that much.  It's not so unreasonable. My own ancestry runs the gamut from a royal with an anger problem, a royal with gambling issues and a penchant for using big ineffectual ships to raid shipping lines, a royal who hightailed it to another country and married someone there who had money not long before a revolution, an eccentric and probably monstrous 19th century businessman, and a dude with several trucks and truck parts on his lawn and a favourite meal of jelly beans and beer.  Really, you only want to identify with so much of your heritage."

Just for the sake of argument, then, I'll adopt a similar position and say that you're attributing too much conscious agency to their actions in both cases -- the Borg were just probing around in their heavy-handed way, with the unintended but (for them) fortunate side-effect of prompting a war and hence technological development. They lack the empathy to understand the motives of other species beyond the mechanical ""if we attack them, they'll be scared and try to build new weapons we can steal."" Other species' relationships to each other are irrelevant."
DaystromInstitute,3d6n3i,adamkotsko,3,Tue Jul 14 15:46:28 2015 UTC,"you're attributing too much conscious agency to their actions in both cases   I don't see why. I just don't like the notion of a zombie horde that does things 'just because.' I'd like to see some reason behind the scenes. Anyway.   Other species' relationships to each other are irrelevant.   If that were the case, why exactly would the Borg just happen to strike targets all along a border established by two other separate entities and nowhere outside of it? The Neutral Zone is too far away for them to care directly about, so it must be the presence of the Federation and Romulans. It's too big of a coincidence otherwise.  And just to repeat an above point: we have a hugely overcrowded Borg cube (which has been assimilating people from numerous targets) discovered in the Alpha Quadrant at a time which just so happens to coincide with the escalation of a war between two Alpha Quadrant powers. Coincidence? I think not.  Like I say in the main post: the case is based significantly on the fact that the Borg have done something similar to the Romulans, suggesting things about their motives which apply equally logically to the Cardassians, but without direct confirmation. If instead you want to suppose that there are no motives and that this is all random (and to me, it just looks like you're playing devil's advocate and don't actually hold that position - correct me if I'm wrong) then the case pretty much falls apart. The assimilated Cardassians could be from anywhere in their space, just the result of a totally random Borg incursion. But I find that unsatisfying.  Actually, it comes to mind that a 'heavy-handed probe' doesn't really make sense with the great distances the Borg would have to travel to reach the Alpha Quadrant. If a Borg cube were making arbitrary navigation decisions, it should end up striking planets near Borg space, not those on the other side of the galaxy."

If Kirk set them up with seeds to farm, it the Augments were able to domesticate native crops, they could even be growing hydroponics in a cave with a fusion generator for light."
DaystromInstitute,3d5nj7,MungoBaobab,6,Mon Jul 13 21:03:23 2015 UTC,"Better question:   How the hell the Eels, which live underground mind you, were the only things to survive?  If was Ceti Alpha V so badly damaged ecologically that the Cetian equivalent of an earthworm is the only thing left standing (hehe) then there is no way hell could Kahn and Co. still be around.   If there is that massive of a collapse in the ecosystem, nothing large is surviving for more than a few years at most, let alone the ~20 years Kahn and co. survived.   As to the idea that replicators could get them out of that problem that won't work either. There are 2 theories for how Replicators work...  1) Energy>Food  2) generic organic materials>Food.   Number 1 has a couple of big issues. First, it would take a ridiculous amount of power to create even the tiniest amount of food. Second they seem to be in a perpetual sandstorm, which leaves Solar out as an option. (Yes, Kirk might have left them generator but does anyone honestly think Kirk would have left one of the smartest most dangerous men in human history a fusion generator?)  Number 2 doesn't work either. You need Organic materials to fuel  the replicator so if the ecosystem collapsed a completely as implied by Khan then they wouldnt have the fuel for it. Also see the sandstorm above for lack of power to run the thing.  Alternatively, Khan just lying through his teeth and they'd been eating underground mushrooms or something.  Tl;Dr: Khan and Co. shouldn't even be alive, they should have starved long ago. Alternatively Khan was lying."

Calling him captain on the Enterprise was a courtesy afforded to him because he was, indeed, the current commander of that ship.  Decker was temporarily demoted to make room for Kirk (and eventually, Spock). He was essentially still a Captain officially, but he had the effective rank of Commander on the Enterprise."
DaystromInstitute,3d5tq6,Blue_Dog_Democracy,11,Mon Jul 13 21:01:03 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. Any officer with any rank is called captain when in command of a (star)ship. Data, for instance, is called captain in Redemption, Part II.   Perhaps it wasn't supernecessary to demote Decker, and maybe in another circumstances he would have retained his rank, but everyone in the ship knows that Decker is NOT going to like Kirk being given command of HIS ship and will probably try to ""compete"" with him (which he kind of does). So, in this particular case, it makes sense to formally demote Decker in order to make him (and the crew) understand who's the boss.  On the other hand, everyone knows Spock will have no problem accepting Kirk as captain of the ship, nor will the crew, so no need there."
DaystromInstitute,3d5tq6,hugop86,8,Tue Jul 14 00:06:02 2015 UTC,"As an alternative, I saw it as a sort of brevet rank. Kirk was still an Admiral and Decker was still a Captain, but both simply wore the lower ranks for their lower ranks.  In reality, it was likely because the producers thought that audiences would get confused of they had Decker, as executive officer, referred to as Captain and Kirk, as commanding officer, referred to as Admiral. They apparently changed their minds for TWoK."

DaystromInstitute,3d3mty,stingray85,11,Mon Jul 13 12:07:00 2015 UTC,"Why? Why would there need to be restrictions?  First, you not wanting to work would almost certainly put you in a minority of people, because while the way society is currently structured means there are many people doing what they can to make money, Federation society doesn't have the same requirement, which means people are free to do their passion work, and only have to with the number of hours they'd want on any given day. And, education is sufficiently available that if you get bored with your current thing, you can pick up something else you find interesting.  Beyond that, even saying you're in the minority that chooses not to work, why would there be restrictions on where you could live. Your example of Paris alone is enough to show firm restrictions aren't entirely necessary, you may want to live there, but I'd personally rather avoid it. Now consider that the Federation is composed of hundreds of worlds, and that the options for places people would want to live is multiplied by that."

He chose to work on DS9 because that seemed like the most interesting place to him.  And then, again, most people are working, and would want to live near where they work. And maybe Paris is full, you can live anywhere on Earth, and schedule a transporter to anywhere on the planet, and be there in seconds, at least by the 24th century."
DaystromInstitute,3d3mty,dkuntz2,4,Mon Jul 13 13:27:45 2015 UTC,"it must be totally and completely impractical for some reason.   I don't see why. This is a post-scarcity society where housing is in abundance. If you want to live in a large city you're only decision is really whether you want to live in an apartment in the city within walking distance from your place of work, or a private domicile outside the city within accessible distance via mass-transit.  If we go by Star Trek First Contact, Earth's global population immediately prior to First Contact was around 9 billion. With safe M/AM power and Vulcan technology (along with Vulcan policy meddling) I would sincerely hope that Earth became globally developed within a generation of FC.   Since the world is not fully developed (i.e. scarcity based) it's hard to imagine what a falling population looks like as developed nations receive migration from less developed nations that are still growing, but let's look at Japan as an example of a fringe case example of a developed nation with little immigration. The population of Japan is expected to fall by 25% by 2050. Can you imagine what Earth would look like if populations fell globally by 25% within 50 years? They'd be abandoned cities like Detroit everywhere! Suburbs would become ghost towns. If anything I imagine municipalities would be encouraging people to live in the city, lest they lose there ""metropolitan charm"".  But what about off-world immigration? Well let's assume that it took at least two or three generations before Earth's off-world colonies became any where close to a population where the numbers would be large enough for migration. Why presume the development of the colonies to be any less than Earth? The rate of natural increase in developed countries currently is between 5 and -5 per 1000 people which means, the more I think about it, even with the extended lifespans of humans emigration and population decline is gunna be a serious concern to Federation planets and, conversely, immigration will be positively encouraged.  The short answer I think is basically there will be such a surplus of accommodation on Earth that you could pretty much live in any city you wanted without a problem, and even a mansion in the middle of nowhere if you really wanted (although you would be considered somewhat of a hermit for doing so). The only limitation I can foresee is if you wanted to live in a historic building like the Palace of Versailles or Buckingham Palace as I imagine these have been opened to the public. Even then I think if you can make a convincing argument that you living there would provide a public service special accommodation (literally!) could be provided, hence Sisko's Creole Kitchen or the Picard Château."

We see holodecks having much more room inside a simulation than when it's just an empty room. This obviously isn't feasible on a starship because of the high chance of power outages, but on Earth? The center of the Federation? Odds of a power outage are negligible.   So they have their broom closet apartment which can be exactly as large or as small a home as you want it to be. The windows can have any view you want them to. If you decide to pick up and move across the world, load your apartment onto a thumb drive and plug it in to your new city. Maybe the high value locations (ex. beachfront homes) have a waiting list and a time limit.   If for some reason you need a real house which is actually big, we've seen these out in the countryside.

Unless you're just insisting on realism, both of those products could be simulated in a way that provides the necessary usage while maintaining illusion if you so desire. For the toilet, just convert the human waste into energy and, for the stove, heat a piece of holographic metal; no plumbing or gas lines necessary."

In TNG, you see them putting dirty dishes back into the replicator to be converted into energy (or, at the very least, beamed to a dishwasher); I see no reason a similar solution couldn't be found for crap.  Also, why the insistence on gas lines? We have electric stoves today, all that is required for a holographic stove is a piece of conductive material that is designed to provide a safe, hot surface for cooking. Even were that not possible in the holodeck, I can think of at least one episode in DS9 where they use holographic fire and heat (during Worf's bachelor party), meaning an old-fashioned fire stove would likely be well within the realm of possibility on a holodeck.  Alsoalso, I don't know about where you live, but the only time I have power outtages is when catastrophic weather damages the infrastructure. Due to weather control systems on Star Trek's Earth, such weather is nonexistent. Not to mention that they have much more sophisticated power and energy storage technology. It wouldn't surprise me if many residents of Earth in Star Trek go their entire lives without experiencing a power outtage."

It seems much more likely to me that they are hobbyists rather than indicative of some interstellar ban on non-flame cooking. I can't conceive of any bureaucratic reason why cooking with flames would be preferable to simply using heat; if anything, an open flame presents far more opportunities for danger, especially on a starship.  Really, though, my guess is that we are both nerding out a bit too hard and the real reason flame is used anytime someone cooks on the show is because it shows much better on camera than an electric stove would."

DaystromInstitute,3d3mty,disposable_pants,2,Mon Jul 13 18:45:01 2015 UTC,"Roddenberry's answer would probably be that this sort of greed will be heavily stigmatized a few hundred years in the future.    Imagine a wealthy person today having a mid-life crisis:  They sell their house, their car, their boat, they give away all their possessions to the poor and donate all their money to charity, and they decide to pull a Thoreau and go live by themselves in a shack in the deep woods.  At very least a lot of eyebrows would be raised, they'd probably lose some of their friends, and their relations with their family might even get strained.  You'd probably hear whispers of mental illness and maybe even see an intervention.  What they're doing is so far outside social norms that they'd feel tremendous pressure to never take those steps in the first place.  I'd think needless greed would be viewed the same way in the utopian Federation.  Technically it's legal, but it's so universally unpalatable that almost no one does it.    EDIT:  One further thought.  Today, possessions are to an extent a reflection of one's work ethic and success in life.  If I want a nicer car than my neighbor, part of the reason why I want that car is because it will show the world that I'm doing really well for myself.  In a post-scarcity society possessions aren't tied to success because everyone has all they want and you don't really need to work if you don't have to.  The 24th century equivalent of a nice car doesn't mean jack to the world because the guy who putzes around doing nothing all day down the street can get one just as easily."

I thought it was interesting when Picard went home. Picard's brother had a rather large vineyard and a generous home, but that was their father's. What of the farmer of poorer lineage?

DaystromInstitute,3d3mty,brutallyhonestharvey,4,Mon Jul 13 22:44:35 2015 UTC,"This article explains it better than I could.  Basically, the Star Trek economy works on a basis of capitalism, but post-scarcity for the most part.  People still own things, including property, so no one would get ""kicked out"" and replaced by another owner due to ownership rights.  Everyone gets allocated a boatload of Federation credits, likely more than you could ever spend in a lifetime, so a farmer of poorer lineage in a sense would no longer exist.  You can earn more credits if you're successful and run your business well, but since you already have more credits than you'd ever need, you're basically farming because you want to (theoretically, anyone that remained a farmer would be because they liked it and would theoretically be good at it). If you wanted to be a farmer, you could theoretically purchase the land you need to be a successful farmer from someone else (maybe from someone who inherited a farm, but has no desire to farm).

Worth noting, however, that a currency unit so prevalent and easily acquired would be valueless to the degree that you wouldn't be able to explicitly buy anything truly scarce with it.

The post-scarcity economy is such a foreign concept to us that we may not be able to understand.

Because of the job-issue (you really really really want to study tachyon fields) (and the socio-economic situation, as stated by others), immigration to earth is, even earth being a paradise, not always desirable.  I think that, given how far psychiology and child care has come, people from early on do know what they want to do (and are mostly correct) and about nobody is ever bad at his job (even the bad apples in starfleet could be considered highly efficient, given some other metric), you will be willing to go wherever your job takes you.

From what we know Earth has a population of 9b in the 24th century. That sounds like a lot compared to today (~7b), but remember that a much bigger area of Earth is habitable than is today & there is no need to be close to a city for work, nor does it take as long to get to one when you need to.  In practice 9b people in the 24th century have a lot more space available to them than 7b do in the 21st. Have you ever been to South East England? It's actually really pleasant despite being relatively densely populated. It has a surface area of 19,095 km2 and a population of 8,635,000 (excluding London). At the same population density as South East England (remember that we're excluding London, so this is still mostly a rural area), the world's land area can house just over 67b people.

Real estate is one of these things.  A flat in the historic Mission District of San Francisco is simply going to be valued more highly than an estate in the middle of southern Algeria, or on Delta Vega.  Even if it was possible to live elsewhere and use transporters to quickly get anywhere you want on the planet, there are still going to be many many people who would value actually living there.  Given that the estimate in ""Statistical Probabilities"" for Federation fatalities in a war with the Dominion was nine hundred billion, that gives a rough starting point for estimating the size of the Federation population.  As the Mission District currently has a population just under 50000, there is going to be much more demand than there is supply, even if only a tiny fraction of the overall Federation or even of just the human population wanted it.  To actually answer your question, it probably depends on where you want your big house to be and how the economy of the Federation actually works.  The problem with the latter is that the overwhelming majority of the people we see throughout the series are the people who are the furthest removed from the day to day workings of the Federation economy, both literally and figuratively.

If you expect to be able to just move into a large 3 bedroom condo in San Francisco? Probably not.    how the economy of the Federation actually works   It seems like various planets still have their own economies. For instance, Bolius (the Bolian Homeworld) had at least one major banking system that O'Brian helped rob while undercover in the Orion Syndicate for Starfleet Intelligence.  Earth's economy in the 24th Century is a little fuzzy. It seems like there's some sort of system in place to make sure heavy contributors to society get rewarded, while those that don't still have everything they need to survive in relative comfort.  So if you're from a Colony (or are non-Human) and want to move to Earth? It may depend on the following questions:   What is your occupation? Do you already have employment of some sort lined up? Where do you want to live? Do you have any family/relationships moving with you (to the same home)? If yes, how many Adults and/or Children? How much space do you need?

DaystromInstitute,3d6y1e,Nick-Nick,5,Tue Jul 14 00:23:05 2015 UTC,"All I can think of in regards to Romulus and Unification is with Vulcan.  Remans are likely a native species of the Romulan system whereas Romulans are definitely non-native having moved there at some point in Vulcan History.  Romulans and Vulcans are virtually identical genetically though there is some method of differentiating the two.  But Romulus and Remus being equal partners would probably produce far better results for the Romulan Empire (assuming compatible goals) in the long term, subjugation always breeds resentment so the entire species would likely be one big barrel of TNT the romulans have to safeguard in case it goes off."
DaystromInstitute,3d6y1e,74159637895123,2,Tue Jul 14 00:35:51 2015 UTC,"I think they mention that the Remans are indeed Vulcanoid, possibly a low class of Romulans used for slave labor. I think they also got their telepathy back. I could be wrong. They do have pointy ears."

DaystromInstitute,3d6y1e,Omn1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:25:42 2015 UTC,"That... Actually sort of makes sense. The seperatist Vulcans arrive on Romulus and find the Remans. At first, Romulus' harsh environment is perfectly suited for the Remans but not the Vulcans. Seperatist Vulcans conquor the Remans and start a program of interbreeding (or perhaps just genetic engineering in existing Vulcans) to get some of their more desirable traits of the Remans, thus birthing the ""new"" Romulans. The remaining Reman population is exiled to Remus as a slave race.  As time passes and the Romulans terraform Romulus, those survival traits aren't as necessary so they start letting Reman characteristics exit the gene pool. This explains why the majority of Romulans we see in ST have ridges, but some still do not, as we see them on TOS. It also helps account for why the Romulans in NuTrek Star Trek (2009) don't have ridges."
DaystromInstitute,3d6y1e,BonzoTheBoss,2,Fri Jul 17 10:18:40 2015 UTC,"Could be that the Remans were genetically modified Romulans, bred for the specific conditions on Remus.  This would have been done to more easily mine the dilithium."

DaystromInstitute,3d3ahd,Etcee,64,Mon Jul 13 04:29:18 2015 UTC,"Going with a lame possibility here: after the Enterprise C was lost, they could've just appointed an existing Ambassador class ship as the flagship and rode it out for two decades until the D came along.

DaystromInstitute,3d3ahd,AmbassadorAtoz,50,Mon Jul 13 20:51:28 2015 UTC,"Sorry, you tripped one of my pet peeves with this:   in the flagship position   We only ever here the Enterprise-D referred to as ""The Flagship of the Federation"".  We have no reason to believe the other Enterprises we also called that. The 1701 was famous but also a training ship for a while (doesn't mean it wasn't both, but never stated as a flagship), neither was the 1701-A called the Flagship, when the logical choice would be the Excelsior (1701-A had a famous name and captain, sure, but not flagship)  Now the Enterprise holds a special place in my heart.  I want the Enterprise to be special.  However, Starfleet is big.  Many ships and names can have impressive histories.  Kirk and the Enterprise were the most famous of that generation.  The 1701-B and 1701-C could have just been normal ships as far as the fleet was concerned.  Carrying on the name, sure.  Respected, as much as any other ship.  The Enterprise-D was a Flagship because it was one of the newest, largest, and most advanced ships Starfleet ever put out.  It also became famous, because of its crew.  As to your question, it takes time to build a ship.  For example the USS Enterprise CVN65 was decommissioned in 2013.  The replacement carrier that will get the name Enterprise, CVN80 isn't expected to be finished until 2025  In the case of the 1701-A it is most likely (beta canon) that the ship that became the Enterprise was going to be called something else, but Starfleet recommissioned the ship for Kirk (after saving the planet).  The 1701-A was decommissioned so the name could be freed up for the 1701-B.  Kirk was still very popular and the name was still famous. Starfleet wanted that name on the newest and best class. (I wouldn't put much faith in its loss date myself.)  The 1701-C was an Ambassador class.  I think by this time any ""Main Explorer"" class would eventually have an Enterprise in it.  The name seems to follow Starfleets premier ships.   1701-D Starfleet obviously knew a class would supplant the Ambassadors.  So instead of renaming or making a second Ambassador class Enterprise, they held the name so it could in the first run of what became the Galaxy class.  1701-E  Like Kirks 1701-A, the 1701-E was going to commission as another registry and name but Starfleet wanted to honor Picard and crew.   The only time we see the ship replaced ""fast"" is when it was a rush job for a famous or respected crew, or a planned passing of the torch (A to B).  The B/C and C/D transitions were much longer (well B/C we don't really know but that is my assumption anyway).  Thats my theory anyway..."

DaystromInstitute,3d3ahd,AmbassadorAtoz,17,Mon Jul 13 05:50:13 2015 UTC,Kirk's ship never seemed to be the flagship as much as they were the only ship in the sector at the time.

The enterprise name has a history on earth before the space program even began, its tradition and it likely became tradition to make it one of the more powerful front line ships, or flagships."

To save you the trouble of looking at every reference to the word 'flagship' it's just the Enterprise-D, assorted Klingon/Romulan ships, other Federation ships in combat operations, and the mirror NX-01."
DaystromInstitute,3d3ahd,Darth_Rasputin32898,3,Mon Jul 13 15:44:00 2015 UTC,"I would personally amend that to say 'explorer', rather than 'powerful' or 'flagship'."

DaystromInstitute,3d3ahd,butterhoscotch,6,Mon Jul 13 10:59:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for saying this. People just assume that the Enterprise is always the flagship. The D is referred to as the flagship in TNG and in the one TNG movie that featured the E-D. ""They're just trying to decide if their 20- year old Bird of Prey is a match for the Federation Flagship""  It always struck me as interesting, however, that the other Enterprises were not mentioned as the flagship in a similar fashion, even though a sentence or throw-a-way piece of dialogue (i.e. the flagship belongs on this mission"" etc) could have been easily snuck in.  Always thought there was a strong possibility that the other Enterprises were not necessarily the Flagship"
DaystromInstitute,3d3ahd,SStuart,6,Mon Jul 13 14:21:07 2015 UTC,I think during the TNG years the writers felt that using the word flagship was an easy way to emphasize the importance of the Enterprise. So we hear the term used in relation to the Enterprise even though there would be other ships in Starfleet that are also flagships by the more traditional definition. For example there were many times during the Dominion War that the Defiant was a flagship when it was leading a group of ships into battle.
DaystromInstitute,3d3ahd,JRV556,2,Mon Jul 13 14:37:26 2015 UTC,"I agree with that speculation.  It was a quick way for the writers to add importance.  The use of the term flagship for the Enterprise-D was always odd.  It was more like a title, not a function as the term usually would be.  My thinking has evolved over time to something more like:   The Enterprise is a famous name with a long history.  Starfleet honors that with the unique registry.  That is the ""special"" thing given to the name Enterprise. The title of ""Flagship"" is given to the newest and most advanced ships.  That is a ""special"" thing given to a new ship. (To me this means other Galaxy class ships at the time would also be called ""Flagships"". Not all Galaxy class, maybe just the first 3? first 6?)   The Enterprise-D happened to be both of those.  A first run Galaxy class ship and the continuation of the Enterprise name. The Enterprise-D got 2 ""specials"".   That is not to say Starfleet didn't plan that happy coincidence.  Maybe someone in ""bu-ships"" saw that the previous Enterprise's were not ""Flagships"".  They saw that the new lead class was about to begin planning and reserved Enterprise(D) for an initial build order."
DaystromInstitute,3d3ahd,mistakenotmy,2,Mon Jul 13 15:35:28 2015 UTC,"Starfleet uses the term ""flagship"" in much the same way the British Navy does, it's a ship that demonstrates the values and the achievements of fleet.   The Defiant was not the Flagship, it was a little escort with an adjunct, certainly not comparable to a Galaxy class ship. Admiral Ross's ship would have been a flagship, (the ship with the flag officer) but not in the same way that the Enterprise was the ""flagship of the fleet""  In general, SF doesn't seem to assign much actual meaning to the flagship term. In First Contact and BOBW, for example the admiral's ship is referred to as ""the admiral's ship"" not the Flagship."
DaystromInstitute,3d3ahd,SStuart,0,Mon Jul 13 16:02:28 2015 UTC,also the enterprise D had two flags as part of the architecture on the bottom of the star drive section..on the official model i built 20 years ago anyway.  I always thought that was becuse it was the flagship

DaystromInstitute,3d3ahd,mistakenotmy,11,Tue Jul 14 20:50:45 2015 UTC,"The first galaxy class ships started construction in the early 2350s , with the first ship USS Galaxy launched in 2356 and was commissioned in 2357.  I would imagine that the design team was working on it for much earlier than the construction took place.  For example the current Ford class aircraft carriers initial designing and then construction of the class started in 2005 and was not launched until 2013, and is not planned to be commissioned until March 2016.  When they recently decommissioned the USS Enterprise CVN-65 in 2012 the US Navy announced that one of the new Ford Class carriers will be named USS Enterprise scheduled to be launched in 2025; an almost 13 year gap (assuming no construction, budget or design issues)  Using the Ford class aircraft carrier timeline as a benchmark, that puts design of the Galaxy Class around 2346 or two years after the loss of the Enterprise C.  Currently the US Navy is scheduled to commission new aircraft carrier(s) in 2016, 2020, and 2025, and the Federation had an initial timetable of sorts.  We do know that the USS Galaxy was commissioned in 2357 and the USS Enterprise in 2364, It is reasonable to presume that with the Federation and Starfleet on a peacetime footing, there was not a rush to produce a resource and labor intensive project, and if anything construction was delayed possibly with numerous design changes and updates that modern ships see, and potentially by the murder suicide in the nacelle tubes.  So taking into consideration /u/mapwheel's idea of Starfleet waiting our of respect, plus Starfleet making a conscious decision to make the next Enterprise one of the new Galaxy Class ships, and inevitable construction, budget and design issues that I would imagine can still happen in one form or another even in the 24th century.  Why do we see so many Galaxy Class ships in the dominion war? The Federation when into wartime mode.   In world war II from starting in April 1941 the US Navy built 26 Essex class aircraft carriers, or about one every 45 days. 1942 - 3 1943 - 5 1944 - 9 1945 - 7  by comparison the Navy had built 6 aircraft carriers from 1920-1942. They started building the newer midway classes in 1943, but the kinks were mostly worked out on the essex so im guessing thats why they built more of them.  When we get into the other Enterprises, from the 1701 to the 1701-A, they were not making any other constitution class ships so odds are they renamed a ship (USS Yorktown)  At the end of The undiscovered country the Enterprise A was to be decommissioned, so Starfleet wanted to have an Enterprise waiting. They may have had the Khitomer peace talks with the Klingons, but I think they were still weary.  B to C, probably the same as above.  D to E, we are in the middle of the cold war with the dominion, and production of the sovereign class is already going on. They probably redesignated an existing hull to be called the Enterprise, much in the same way the Sao Paulo was renamed to Defiant. At the time there was trouble with the klingons and the cold war with the dominion. If the Klingons would think twice about attacking the Enterprise-A under Kirk's command in 2286, they would think twice about attacking the Enterprise-E under Picards in 2373.  TLDR: In peace big ships of a new design do not have the same urgency to build, and you dont want to put your flagship on a second tier class."
DaystromInstitute,3d3ahd,deb1385,1 point,Mon Jul 13 06:33:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with this viewpoint most.  The presence of lower registry Wolf 359 ships and the Nebula class suggests that engineering precedent for the Galaxy class existed for at least several years prior to the launch of the first Galaxy.  It makes sense to me that the Galaxy would have been seen as a fleet modernization endgame with the D registry on reserve for the first production hull, not counting the testbeds NX-Galaxy and the Yamato."
DaystromInstitute,3d3ahd,rynwdhs,16,Mon Jul 13 17:38:00 2015 UTC,"It is possible that there was not an appropriate ship under construction for most of those 20 years to get the name Enterprise.  Given the few number of ship's we've seen from between the Excelsior era and the Galaxy class era indicate something was going on. While we have seen quite a few classes built with Galaxy and Ambassador parts we have only seen one or two of these ships. Whereas we have seen dozens of Excelsiors and Mirandias from before this era and huge numbers of post-Wolf 359 classes.  Notice we see the same pattern with the Klingon Empire.  I think that following the peace of the Khitomer Accords and the thaw after Narendra III there was some sort of force reduction treaty with a Starship building holiday. As a result there were several classes built but they were limited in the number of ships that could be built meaning Starfleet could only build a few testbed starships that kept technology developing but didn't increase the size of the fleet. You will notice that the Soyuz sub-class of the Mirandia was retired during this time while the Mirandias were kept in service- this retirement could have been part of some kind of UFP-KE treaty that required Starfleet slash large numbers of ships. The Soyuz's might have been scrapped to allow an equal tonnage of Ambassadors to be built, and after the lost of the Enterprise-C it was decided not to fill that open tonnage with a 12 year old design by building another Ambassador.  If there was a building holiday with only a few testbed ships built it is likely that Starfleet didn't want to attach the name 'Enterprise' to a ship that would either see limited use or might actually prove a technological misstep."

It's a matter of respect and appropriate timing.  (From a modern perspective imagine if they'd immediately built another space shuttle named Challenger or Columbia.)  The D was lost as well but it wasn't a total loss, most if not all the crew survived.  It's the same as the 1701 to the 1701-A."

DaystromInstitute,3d3ahd,jerslan,7,Mon Jul 13 04:59:41 2015 UTC,"There was public outcry after the brief gap, so, out of respect, they waited longer after Enterprise C was also lost with all hands....

DaystromInstitute,3d3ahd,WilliamMcCarty,3,Mon Jul 13 05:10:36 2015 UTC,"You are correct, Memory Beta says the same.  I did not recall it that way.    Maybe after two ships of the same name were lost back-to-back they decided to give the jinx a rest for a while."
DaystromInstitute,3d3ahd,Cash5YR,3,Mon Jul 13 05:14:23 2015 UTC,"Well, as odd as it may be in the minds of the people, the way the crew of the B and C died could be a big influence on the ""mourning"" period before naming a new Enterprise. The B crew most likely died from a pathogen on a deep space mission according to beta canon. There is actually nothing about the ship ever being recovered, and the cause of death confirmed, so the ship could still be lost somewhere out in the galaxy. Either way, it is a tragic end, but that seems to kinda happen to deep space crews. So, I think the majority of people would slap on the equivalent of a Livestrong bracelet for a few months, and then it would fade from memory. Now, the C died in heroic battle, while trying to defend the citizens of a historic enemy. It is a great PR situation for Starfleet and the Federation. The Klingons admired the way the crew faced death in battle, and opened up a dialogue for lasting peace. It isn't comfortable to say that the people of the Federation probably glorified the way the crew of the C died more than the B, but it isn't too hard to imagine. Emotions are on high, lasting peace with the Klingons seems absolute, and the good times are about to roll. As a reault, the C was put on a pedestal, and the brass decided they needed to make sure the next Enterprise was the biggest and the baddest yet. So, while the loss of life is tragic in both cases, the public opinion ends up influencing the decision to keep the Enterprise name on hold for a couple decades."

DaystromInstitute,3d3ahd,BrainWav,0,Tue Jul 14 05:33:07 2015 UTC,"First, only the D was ever referred to as the ""flagship"" (which is odd in and of itself).  That's not how flagships work in a naval sense, which always led me to believe it was more of a colloquial term anyway.  The A was already built, and was simply re-designated as the Enterprise.  The same happened to the Sovereign-class.  These are the only two cases where we see an ""on-screen"" transition, and both had near-full crew continuity and were for a highly-decorated and celebrated crew.  Those two are exceptions, not the rule.  The Excelsior and Ambassador switch-overs were almost certainly planned years before the previous ship was mothballed.  I'd wager the same is true for the Galaxy.  The Galaxy-class was probably always intended to replace the Ambassador as the next Enterprise.  In fact, I'd wager it was replaced before it was originally intended, as the Enterprise-D is the 3rd Galaxy-class and we know it still had a few kinks to work out."

Sigh...the andorian crap is some of the highest rated crap on enterprise, because it establishes a continuity within the universe. Far too little and too late but there you go.  Going off of DS9 and other episodes, it seems that owning private space ships is completely legal and possible, as is owning your own business that uses space ships. This seems mostly limited to cargo vessels and small shuttles but can be as large as defiant sized mini cruisers.  Given starfleet and the federations attitude towards personal freedoms they would never declare they are the sole authority over all humans and humans with starships. At this point they dont have much legal standing as far as jurisdiction which i think is what you are getting at.   They did not assert that they were the legal authority when it comes to humans and their ships, enforcing laws in their territory and protecting people. I dont think starfleet felt it was up to that task yet, or even had any real territory to speak of either. There certainly didn't have the laws or treaties to make such claims, or the muscle to back them up. Yet.... So much missed potential when it comes to enterprise.  When I think of it, I think of stargate sg-1 and that feeling you got as earth slowly built up its fleet, you rooted for them, you wanted them to build a huge fleet and become a galactic super power. None of that happens on enterprise, you cant even root for them."
DaystromInstitute,3d3cse,butterhoscotch,6,Mon Jul 13 09:19:33 2015 UTC,"Starfleet isn't so much command as it is law enforcement.  In that way, yeah, it's more like the US Coast Guard.

The other quadrants, to differing degrees, boast unity, stability, communication, infrastructure, convention, etc. Even if the systems aren't as utopian as the Federation, often bordering on dystopian, they still have those things.  We've seen it in humanity where these things go out the window, for example during economic depressions, during or after a war, or after a revolution, when people resort to what we now consider extreme and taboo means. Eating pets, eating other humans, stealing from friends, betraying allies, killing to take relatively little from them, vigilante gangs, lynchings, etc.  Usually things will right themselves, but with isolationist empires and races, the status quo reigns supreme and things go on as they are. In a way, they sort of wrote Voyager as a kind of Sam Beckett, whose influence in the quadrant started chain reactions and left the quadrant a significant amount closer to salvation (in the humanist way we've come to accept from the series).  It might be that the Borg caused this atmosphere or it could be that it was the easiest place to expand. The most un-empathic and idiosyncratic empires usually appear in times of despair, or apathy. It could even be that the Delta Quadrant created the Borg, in the same way that WWI and Weimar Republic created the Nazis, with the Borg's strange interest in humanity being an interest in a novel and possible second-best form of existence, especially given our ability to defeat them time and time again and the Borg's readiness to adapt rather than stick to outdated, almost jingoistic, conventions. (I do feel like they nerfed the Borg a bit towards the end. For a 'race' all about adaptation and progress, they soon became dusty old hesitant bores.)"

The other quadrants, to differing degrees, boast unity, stability, communication, infrastructure, convention, etc. Even if the systems aren't as utopian as the Federation, often bordering on dystopian, they still have those things.   Maybe it's the presence of the Federation itself. Maybe instead of thinking of the Federation as the US, think of it as Britain, since the US was started by the British settlers, and grew to be a mostly British culture that filled the North American continent. You might say that in the same way, the Federation has grown to fill the Alpha and Beta quadrants with this kind of stability. The Gamma quadrant has the Dominion that provides this kind of stability, through force rather than friendship and cooperation. The Delta quadrant might be more like, say, Africa. Not just lacking in most resources, but maybe mis-allocation of what they do have. Africa has lots of tribal cultures that don't always get along, fighting for life in a harsh climate. I won't say that America is better for having oppressed the local tribal populations, but the end result was a largely unified culture that covers a large amount of ground. Earth has many colonies, and lots of allies, and this shows the Alpha and Beta quadrants that cooperation is a good thing. Most of the population of those quadrants agrees.  If the dominant power of the Delta quad is the Borg, that may be because they subjected all the bigger dogs, which leaves a lot of space for all the little tribes to do their thing."

Heck, it's the work of a day to transit by any of a number of Elder Race-powered widgets. So I find it pretty easy to believe that any number of possible bits of unpleasant history have echoed down through the ages to make the Delta Quadrant a fundamentally less dignified and more fractious segment of the galaxy. I'm thinking of modern parallels, where Haiti's impoverishment relative to the geographically identical Dominican Republic can be directly linked to ""reparations"" (really ransoms) paid to France for the market value of its formerly enslaved citizens.   It could be, as you suggest, the Borg. Given the enthusiasm with which the Borg attempted to decapitate the Federation leadership by aiming straight for Earth, it could be that they just make a habit out of pruning polities with an emphasis on cooperation and sharing, recognizing that the open exchange of technical advances is perhaps the only force that could develop a robust defense to their feeding.   Or, maybe it's older and more convoluted. Maybe the older generation of powers in the Alpha Quadrant- the Iconians, the Cytherians, came into conflict with their Delta Quadrant peers- maybe whoever built the black hole powered communications network used by the Hirogen, or the Voth- and the Delta Quadrant powers lost, and the relative surfeit of organization in the vicinity is the result of a whole generation of what would now be mentoring species- their Vulcans- having been bombed into the stone age.  Or, perhaps it's geographical- the galactic version of ""Guns, Germs, and Steel."" A galaxy is still just small enough to display certain kinds of inhomogeneity. Maybe the rest of the galaxy was preferentially enriched with dilithium thanks to collisions with satellite galaxies billions of years ago. Or there was a random clustering of supernovas in the statistical noise that effectively reset the civilization clock along Voyager's path. Or perhaps it's a combination of some of the above- a billion year old Type III civilization set off a bunch of supernovas to power its transition to a different plane of existence (looking at you, Q.)"
DaystromInstitute,3d0epb,Darth_Rasputin32898,4,Mon Jul 13 14:47:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this sounds like an observation brilliantly fitting with my ideas on how the Borg are 'farming' species.' They are (almost) unquestionably the dominant species in the Delta Quadrant, and, given that their strategy seems to be to target species that are as advanced as possible, it's incredibly simple and logical for the Delta Quadrant to hence divide into two groups: one occupied by parasitic/bandit-like species, like those you have mentioned, and also those powerful enough to resist them, like Species 116 or the Voth. (I've nominated this idea for PotW, actually.)  I know some people have pointed out that Voyager has only encountered a tiny fraction of the Delta Quadrant species, but the fact that it takes numerous large 'jumps' (brief transwarp, Kes, etc.) and still encounters species that seem either parasitic or domineering in largely different areas of the Delta Quadrant where the Borg are still present strongly suggests that there is some sort of 'backwater trend' going on, connected to the Borg."

They're inconsistent because every adds a little flair to each fable and changes it to their liking. They don't need to make sense because the stories aren't meant to be taken as serious.

DaystromInstitute,3d0gjl,chaoticlychaotic,5,Sun Jul 12 14:58:11 2015 UTC,Thanks for the response! So what are some factors that would make a ship like voyager faster than a refit constitution? Additionally how large would the differences be between various matter/antimatter reactors? Are there limits to how fast a given ship can be upgraded to propel itself?   Sorry if I'm bombarding you with questions!
DaystromInstitute,3d0gjl,Arcelebor,10,Sun Jul 12 18:45:51 2015 UTC,"Realistically, all ships move at the speed the plot requires.  The show's never been really granular enough to be more specific.  The few examples we have seem to indicate that the power available, the design of the engines, and the supporting systems are not always capable of the same load.  This is almost always to communicate the sense of danger as a ship strains to do something exceptional (Captain Sulu's ""fly her apart then!"" being the most obvious case).  In general, one may assume that the support systems (navigation systems, structural integrity, etc.) are all built to be far more capable than the reactor/engines.  There are many examples of a ship becoming hyper-accelerated and suffering no ill effects.  Though these exceptional cases certainly benefit from overdesign, it makes more sense that the ships (post-Constitution) are designed to be upgraded over a long lifetime and may need much higher tolerances to withstand improvements in speed/stress.  Similarly, the engines themselves appear to be regularly capable of higher speeds than they are normally operated at.  I can't recall a single instance of warp coil blowing out or failing, leading one to suspect that they too are overdesigned to compensate for exceptional circumstances or incremental upgrades over their lifetime.  The weak point always seems to be the reactor, which makes sense given the WW2 aesthetic of most Star Trek ship design.  The steam plant with its very visible signs of failure (loud noises, escaping gasses, exploding containment vessels) is the obvious intuitive comparison for most viewers.  In our particular example of the Excelsior, it seems like the warp engines themselves are the the weak point.  ""Flying apart"" is very different from the well-established reactor overload often used in the series.  One might think that, for the Excelsior in particular, its original transwarp design required a larger (and probably less efficient) reactor which provided more than enough energy for its downgraded engines.  One could then, theoretically, dump a Galaxy-class reactor in a Constitution-class hull and get Galaxy-class speeds.  Except that one would need to upgrade the support systems for the reactor, and then the warp coils for the higher speed, and the support systems for the upgrade warp coils...and at that point you might as well just build a new Galaxy.  There is no reason you could not have made every ship look exactly like the original Constitution class and just upgrade the internal systems with each iteration but that's boring and communicates poorly to the viewer.  The only exception I can think of to this is the Intrepid class, which had a poorly-explained mechanical warp field actuator.  This is something that could have been very cool if embraced in subsequent designs but apparently was deemed too troublesome and explained away with some ""improved warp theory"" technobabble."
DaystromInstitute,3d0gjl,chaoticlychaotic,3,Sun Jul 12 19:32:13 2015 UTC,As I recall a significant portion of Enterprise was spent with them tuning and fiddling with the warp 5 reactor to eek higher speeds out of it--though there's also talk of plasma injectors and warp field coils there.
DaystromInstitute,3d0gjl,mapwheel,3,Sun Jul 12 21:35:01 2015 UTC,"Shit was always breaking on the NX-01's warp drive, and the hull couldn't really handle warp 5+ stresses for very long. Trip definitely earned his keep. I recall him leaving for an episode and the ship going to shit because of some bullshit personal drama with Tits McG... T'Pol.  Seeing the rough genesis of systems you take for granted in later (chronologically) series was one of things Enterprise did pretty well."
DaystromInstitute,3d0gjl,SpocksBrainLLAP,3,Mon Jul 13 05:04:01 2015 UTC,"Well, you can see going through the series that newer ships look more ""aerodynamic"". Obviously there is no air in space but this design choice most likely assists in shaping a more efficient warp bubble.  The reactor size is determined by its power but also by the size of the ship. The Defiant's reactor would be small by comparison to larger ships, however it is still very fast.  The limit is to warp 10. A ship can get infinitely close to warp 10 but it can never achieve it without going into transwarp which is a different thing all together."
DaystromInstitute,3d0gjl,DauntlessP,3,Sun Jul 12 19:32:19 2015 UTC,"I think Voyager is rather fast because the warp field is small for a ship of her mass (very form fitting if you will). I think this is also the reason the pylons fold up a bit before going to warp. The Sovereign class follows a similar hull design, very sleek and rather long. Additionally i guess the total power output of the reactor plays a vital role, though i have no idea what kind of power Voyagers reactor produces compared to a Galaxy class for instance.  I can't quite remember what the limitation of the Defiant was in the beginning, that held it back from going fast. Was it the structural integrity? If so, that would be a significant factor and i guess also favor more compact designs (which in my mind don't require as much energy to hold together).  I think another interesting question to bring up is: What dictates the maneuverability at warp? I think there was a Voyager episode where they talked about changing course at warp, and Tom Paris said he could only deviate a few degrees from their heading without ripping the ship apart. Is this based on the structural integrity field? If so, would it be possible to make a rather swift turn at low warp, but at higher warp, your ship would blow apart?"

DaystromInstitute,3d0gjl,InconsiderateBastard,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:01:35 2015 UTC,"Based on the TNG tech manual and other beta cannon, my impression of speed, specifically Warp speed, comes from the quantity and density of the field coils in the nacelles.  One way warp drive was explained is that electro plasma flows from the war core to the nacelles where it is injected into field coils.  When injected, it essentially explodes and the causes the coil to generate a subspace warp.  These small explosions occur in series down the length of the nacelle.  The effect is that each new subspace warp bubble compresses and stretches space between it and the previous bubble.  I always took this to mean you can get better warp performance if you can have more energetic reactions in the coils and more coils as well as better built coils that more precisely generate bubbles.  It's a stretch, but it could be like cylinders in an internal combustion engine.  It's like the balance between small, high RPM engines and large displacement engines.  I'd guess that ships with bigger nacelles are like large displacement engines whereas smaller, more agile ships are more like smaller, higher RPM engines.  But, again, that's probably quite a stretch."
DaystromInstitute,3d0gjl,hummingbirdz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:38:16 2015 UTC,"I think that the key 'speed' for Star Trek ships isn't their top speed--at least in the post-ENT era. Most TNG era ships have top speeds above warp 9, and TOS ships except the leap forward Excelsior have similar top speeds. Whereas in ENT interspecies diversity in tech meant more diversity in top speeds between ships.  The ships seem to be more limited by their reactor fuel than the reactors or warp coils. So basically what makes Voyager able to travel so much faster is that it has to stop less often to dilithium, which isn't the fuel of the matter anti-matter reactor but is the primary scarce resource that is used up. Voyager is able to recycle its dilithium  and therefore it can cruise longer. I think the variable warp field geometry also means it can cruise longer at higher speeds than other TNG era ships. I think Galaxy class ships also probably have advantages over smaller ships in terms of how long they can go without 'refueling'.  Being able to sustain high Warp speeds for longer means you can get somewhere faster. Its the difference between two cars on the interstate traveling 70mph, but one has terrible gas mileage and must stop for gas.  This gives two kinds of speed enhancing technology gains:  1) Improvements in the shape of the warp field via the warp coils/nacelles  2) Improvements in the reactor power allowing you to generate more powerful warp fields  Leading to two kinds of effective speed increases:  1) Improvements in the cruising times at any given speed  2) Improvements in top speed  If I had to venture a timeline:  ENT--TOS: improvements largely in reactor design with some improvements in warp field geometry powered by ever better reactors. Note that Kirk seems to cruise at Warp 1 or 2 a lot. Improvements are accruing to top speeds. With no limit in sight the warp scale is open ended. ENT also sees a lot of cruising at lower speeds like warp 3 as pushing the engines to the top speed is unsustainable.  TOS--TNG: improvements in warp field geometry improves top speeds and importantly improves cruising time at higher speeds. Excelsior's transwarp makes high speed warp sustainable. TNG era we cruise around eventually at that warp 6 speed limit. With limits in top-speed from current tech in sight we get the capped scale.  TNG--VOY: continued improvements in warp field geometry and cruising times. We see VOY experiment with new technologies that allow them to travel very fast, but they are often unable to cruise for long at these speeds. Its stability that lets your cut your trip time. This period is the very beginning of a transition back to the top speed increases with limited high speed cruising."

Yes, he is a Klingon... and he was chief of security.  I get that.  But in many cases, Data is standing right there.  Yet it is Worf who goes running at it while Data and the rest of the crew just stands behind and watches him get his ass kicked.  Why does it always have to be Worf?  You'd think at some point, Picard or Riker would have said ""If Data is present and we need to use hand-to-hand combat over phasers, Worf should be second to attack after Data makes an attempt"".  Data makes more sense to send into physical altercations.  He has ridiculous super human strength, he can calculate the absolute perfect block and counter-attack in milliseconds, he can take punches without flinching, he can get whole body parts ripped off and just get them reattached by himself or Geordi.  Every time some enemy beams onto the ship, especially onto the bridge, we see Worf go running at it with his arms flailing wildly as he screams at the top of his lungs.  He gets hit almost instantly and is thrown to the ground.  Where he lies ""unconscious"" for the rest of the scene, or at least a good chunk of it.  If Data was the one assigned to dish out the first punch in such situations that he is present for, Data could just quickly-but-calmly trot over to the offending villain and punch a hole straight through them like Superman.  In universe explanation:  I'm thinking it's because it's Worf's job and and because Worf just kind of runs at things automatically.  Also because Data is too valuable to risk in such situations.  Behind-the-scenes explanation:  Probably because having Data just instantly destroy any threat would be really anticlimactic and not move the plot forward.

DaystromInstitute,3cy7oz,brutallyhonestharvey,3,Sun Jul 12 06:50:17 2015 UTC,"No wonder he's always getting his ass kicked, lol.  Take your damn bat'leth with you next time Worf!"
DaystromInstitute,3cy7oz,mistervanilla,23,Mon Jul 13 21:32:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't think so. In terms of Federation importance at least, he is rather inconsequential. In fact, he often is disconnected with Federation policy and ideals and has to be corrected by his superiors.   In regards to Klingon history and culture however, he is surely the most influential person of his times. He more or less put in place the last two leaders of the Empire. Does that make him more impactful that Sisko who more or less won the Dominion War for the Federation? Or Picard, who went through countless first contact situations, diplomatic efforts and is generally considered an influential voice in Starfleet? I don't think so, his story has always been decidedly klingon.  Edit: And in terms of 'telling the story', I firmly believe Picard has always been the most important instrument in dissembling the 'true message' of Star Trek. Worf's 'honour' was and is a decidedly narrow concept, whereas Picard was the ultimate 'whole man' that brought to bear the fullness of Roddenberry's vision."
DaystromInstitute,3cy7oz,SleepWouldBeNice,3,Sat Jul 11 23:07:39 2015 UTC,What did he do? I thought he was just a simple tailor?
DaystromInstitute,3cy7oz,TorazChryx,5,Sun Jul 12 12:43:15 2015 UTC,He overheard some amazing things whilst he was hemming some trousers.
DaystromInstitute,3cy7oz,Goldin,4,Sun Jul 12 13:32:29 2015 UTC,"It's a really interesting question!  One could argue that without humans discovering warp speed, the Federation would not exist at all. Therefore it would be someone like Zefram Cochrane.  If it's not him, then possibly their first contact the Vulcans. Would you pick Spock as someone has mentioned? Or Ambassador Soval?"
DaystromInstitute,3cy7oz,uss1701jb,3,Sun Jul 12 13:52:42 2015 UTC,"Actually, the most important person in canon is Jean-Luc Picard.  He made the choice to follow the Borg back to 2063. He then (indirectly, via his crewmen) helped Zef rebuild his ship, in addition to giving him in-flight assistance and knowledge of when the Vulcans would be in the Solar System."
DaystromInstitute,3cy7oz,hungry-animals,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:57:52 2015 UTC,"But he did that because he followed the Borg queen. Therefore the Borg queen is the most important because without her, there'd be no first contact."
DaystromInstitute,3cy7oz,Tyreal,5,Sun Jul 12 17:18:53 2015 UTC,"I'd argue Sisko is more important. Being a God and all, or whatever became of him. From discovering the wormhole, to convincing those aliens to gobble up that dominion fleet to deceiving the romulans to partner up against the dominion. Pretty impressive resume if you ask me."
DaystromInstitute,3cy7oz,MrCrazy,7,Wed Jul 15 18:10:47 2015 UTC,"Politically, he's either been actively or tangentially influential to politics in the Federation and Klingon Empire. Gowron and Martok's ascension to chancellor, preventing the Romulans from backing the Duras, helping reveal the changeling infiltrator or Martok.  However, he is not the most important to the whole galaxy or universe. The most critical could fall on any of the 4 captains Archer, Picard, Sisko, or Janeway and that I would argue Sisko being the least critical.   Archer's involvement in the Temporal Cold War and reshapes the political situation in the galaxy for 10 centuries affecting every Alpha Quadrant power. That alone beats Worf.  Picard draws the attention of Q and makes them realize humanity's worth. Q could have wiped humanity out and nearly did, with the anti-time anomaly. Not to mention several galaxy spanning spatial anomalies he had to deal with.  Janeway, I would argue, accidentally gets involved in as many galaxy/universe spawning incidents as Picard, if not more. The Q Civil War could have gone on for millennia if not for her mediation, with supernovas destroying most of the corporeal galaxy as collateral damage. That's not even including the time Voyager spent at the beginning of the universe. Observer effect tells us that Voyager probably had a major hand in the exact formation of the universe, with chaos theory and the minor perturbation of the initial mass distribution of the universe. And then the Omega molecules, which would definitely change the nature of galactic travel (read: eliminate entirely).  Sisko technically has the least impact, but still beats Worf in the political involvement area by finding the wormhole which leads to the Dominion. He also prevents a coup within the Federation and gets the Romulans to switch sides during the Dominion war.  Worf is influential on a political, interstellar level, but he's outweighed on the galaxy and universe spanning level."
DaystromInstitute,3cy7oz,FoldedDice,6,Sun Jul 12 09:16:06 2015 UTC,Sisko technically has the least impact   I don't know about that. Sisko appears to be at least indirectly responsible for causing the entire Dominion war. Removing him from the timeline seemed to significantly delay the conflict or maybe even prevent it entirely.
DaystromInstitute,3cy7oz,MrCrazy,6,Sun Jul 12 00:03:41 2015 UTC,"He's also responsible for finding the wormhole. If he doesn't find it, there's no exploring the Gamma Quadrant and finding the Dominion. Hell, the Prophets might not even open the Celestial Temple for anyone else and that completely negates finding the Dominion."
DaystromInstitute,3cy7oz,FoldedDice,2,Sun Jul 12 04:11:50 2015 UTC,"Good point. It's possible that someone else might have found the wormhole in his place, but it's certainly not a guarantee.  Also, I forgot to mention that he's solely responsible for keeping the invasion from escalating beyond what it was. Suppose that the war did go ahead, but that Sisko died or vanished before the main invasion force arrived. I doubt that the Prophets would have intervened at all without The Sisko there to convince them."
DaystromInstitute,3cy7oz,Carpenterdon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:04:49 2015 UTC,"No one else could have found the wormhole. The ""Sisko"" was/is/will be the first linear time being to have contact with the Prophets. All the others came ""after"", including Akorem Laan. So yes, I agree Ben Sisko is the most important Captain in regards to the entire Dominion War, Alpha/Gamma Quadrant relationship. Including any future cooperation between the Odo (who will probably take the place of the ""Female"" Founder as the new leader of the Great Link) and the rest of the Changelings and the Federation/Alpha Quadrant species. As well as ensuring a more friendly partnership with the other Gamma Species."
DaystromInstitute,3cy7oz,Zeabos,2,Sun Jul 12 17:44:02 2015 UTC,"I might agree with janeway. On top of the Q civil war-- as she also prevents Species 8472 from defeating the borg, destroys a borg transwarp hub, helps in the proliferation of Unimatrix 0.  She also introduces hundreds of species in the delta quadrant to the potentials of technology: many are surprised by transporter tech, replicators, and the antimatter waste recycling."
DaystromInstitute,3cy7oz,MrCrazy,3,Sun Jul 12 18:51:29 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, completely forgot about 8472. I'd put Unimatrix Zero lower, since she gave the Borg Queen the ability to dissolve that Unimatrix in exchange for resistance in The Collective.  But 8472 is something massive. They're extra-dimensional and wanted to wipe out the galaxy/universe until Janeway made peace with them. She's made peace with two universes."
DaystromInstitute,3cy7oz,petrus4,2,Sun Jul 12 05:46:04 2015 UTC,"Worf for me is probably one of Trek's least important characters, to be honest.  He's an attempt at the ""ultimate warrior"" stereotype, as seen in characters like Ryu from Street Fighter 2 or Liu Kang from Mortal Kombat.  What makes it even worse in this particular case, is that while DS9 had a bit more oomph, TNG was close to G rated for the most part.  Putting Worf on TNG, was roughly equivalent to making Bruce Lee a co-host for Barney the Dinosaur.  Worf as a personality isn't all that far away from Stannis Baratheon from Game of Thrones, prior to that character's child-murdering incident, of course.  A decent sense of ethics perhaps, but around the same level of charisma as a block of reinforced concrete.  He's almost certainly Trek's most overrated character.  People go on about how much he supposedly accomplished, but he never really experienced any difficulty with said achievements; he just had everything handed to him, because of what a badass the writers were trying to imply that he was.  Unfortunately, doing everything easily and automatically however, for me generated the opposite effect; it made him artificial.  I don't actively dislike him par se; I just consider him completely bland and forgettable, and find it mildly frustrating that various people go on periodically about how awesome he supposedly was, because he really wasn't.  The only real reason why he is noteworthy at all, is because he was so regularly the butt of lame, horribly mawkish jokes.    Aside from Picard and Data, most of TNG's regular characters were in reality bland nobodies, who are only really considered memorable due to nostalgia.  I don't think I'll ever understand why people consider them more interesting than the Voyager crew."
DaystromInstitute,3cy7oz,5up3rj,14,Sun Jul 12 07:07:53 2015 UTC,Was with you until the Voyager part. Now I feel rick-rolled
DaystromInstitute,3cy7oz,NoeJose,8,Sat Jul 11 21:56:40 2015 UTC,"Characters more interesting than Voyager characters (that's to say, at least a little bit interesting:) Riker? Nope. Golden boy with no glaring flaws. Doctor? Nope, nothing interesting about her. Nor Counselor Troi. Maybe Geordi with his creepy loneliness thing? I'd count Barclay, Ro, and Guinan, but they're all more like role players rather than parts of the ensemble. I agree. Doesn't mean TNG isn't infinitely better than VOY, but Picard and Data certainly carried the show."
DaystromInstitute,3cy7oz,5up3rj,5,Sat Jul 11 23:01:38 2015 UTC,"Hmm, well now that you mention it. I'd say Riker had a glaring flaw. Something kept him from stepping out from Picard's shadow and taking command of a ship, given several opportunities that would have made sense.   It was never explored really - meta thinking: it would have meant him leaving the show, obviously.   But I mostly agree with the gist - the relationship between Picard and Data (and Jordi somewhat) was the core of the show"
DaystromInstitute,3cy7oz,venttress,3,Sat Jul 11 23:55:11 2015 UTC,i'd argue that riker's glaring flaw was that he was kind of a dick. remember how he treated wesley and barclay?

DaystromInstitute,3d0aaq,comment_redacted,9,Sun Jul 12 12:13:49 2015 UTC,"From a ""real-world"" perspective, keeping the ""K""s when displaying them in credits to keeps them legible and understandable, while using ""Q""s selectively enhances the ""alienness"" of the language.  In story, it's a simple  matter of hypothesizing that there are more than one methods of transliteration. Real Klingon language looks like this. These symbols have to be converted into human-readable characters.  We've had this issue with Western-Asian languages throughout our own history. Take a look at the different transliterations of Chinese characters  EDIT: Also, the ""tlh"" is also rendered using the letter ""K"" (as in tlhIngan/Klingon). Both the Klingon ""Q"" and ""tlh"" sound similar to the English ""K"". Initially, when transliterating Klingon into English, we might have used K for both, not realizing they were subtly different sounds. Upon realizing this, we'd need another letter, switching to Q for the Klingon ""Q"" and keeping K for the Klingon ""tlh."" So names like Kang might actually be tlhang instead of Qang."

Romanized tlhIngan Hol has a one-to-one relation to the pIqaD writing system, making it useful for linguists and other students of the language. However, it may not be the most useful to explorers who encounter new words in the course of their missions and want to include them in their reports."
DaystromInstitute,3d0aaq,gloubenterder,4,Sun Jul 12 15:40:26 2015 UTC,"Oh, and for the curious, here are some canonical (that is, verified by Marc Okrand) Klingon names:  Kahless = qeylIS  Kor = qor  Kang = qeng  Koloth = qolotlh  Korax = qoreQ  Kras = QaS  Kruge = Qugh  Gorkon = ghorqon  K'mpec = qI'empeq  K'mlak = qImlaq  Grilka = ghIrIlqa'  Martok = martaq  ...and some non-Klingon names adapted for Klingon:  James T.

DaystromInstitute,3d0aaq,gloubenterder,5,Sun Jul 12 19:38:28 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting that there are two separate q sounds in Klingon: q and Q, where the q is similar to the q found in Arabic (but aspirated), while the Q represents a harsher sound that is mainly found in some North Caucasian languages.  In IPA, these are written as /qh/ and /q͡χ/, respectively, so it makes sense to use q and Q rather than k.  Furthermore, neither sound is commonly found in English, so when writing lines for actors, it makes sense to use a different letter than k to avoid confusion. ...although it has led to a different sort of confusion, with people writing things like Quapla' and Quo'noS* because they're not used to seeing a q without a u immediately after it.  Oh, and just a final nitpick before I go: It's Qo'noS; starting a word with Q' is strictly tuchlu', as is the lower-case s ;)  Also, for the record, The Klingon Dictionary by Marc Okrand uses Kronos as the English spelling of Qo'noS, so it's quite well-established in that regard. I believe it's also spelled Kronos in the script to ST6."
DaystromInstitute,3d0aaq,gloubenterder,2,Sun Jul 12 16:20:24 2015 UTC,"Different orthographies/transliterations for the same thing, that's all. What bugs me more is that a sound corresponding to IPA [f] (voiceless labial fricative), as in ""Worf"" doesn't exist."
DaystromInstitute,3d0aaq,Kopachris,3,Sun Jul 12 13:39:20 2015 UTC,"Indeed; we call him wo'rIv. I like to hypothesize that this means ""champion of the empire"", but this is just fan speculation."
DaystromInstitute,3d0aaq,gloubenterder,2,Sun Jul 12 15:38:27 2015 UTC,"Klingon transliteration seems to follow some similar rules as Arabic transliteration.  In Arabic, there is a letter that is usually transliterated as ""q"", and it's pronounced farther back in the throat than ""k"". Look on YouTube for native Arabic speaker saying the word ""Qur'an"", and you'll notice it isn't exactly a ""k"" sound. Notice that there's also an apostrophe, which in Arabic transliteration denotes a glottal stop (the sound in the middle of ""uh-oh"").  I don't know if the Klingon actors are coached to pronounce a qaaf when they say Qapla' or Qo'noS (my guess is no). But that would explain why only some sources spell it with a ""q"". That would be in keeping with the orientalism of the Klingon Empire."
DaystromInstitute,3d0wfl,adamkotsko,14,Sun Jul 12 16:21:09 2015 UTC,"No.   Part of the appeal of these films is that it reunites a cast of all your favorite characters. Say what you like about Star Trek '09, but a massive part of the film is the ounce of glee injected into the film as each of the original crew gets introduced and slowly but surely pulled to their proper place on the Enterprise.  What you're suggesting, in barest terms, is a TNG reboot that gets rid of Data, Worf, Riker, LaForge and pretty much every character that people love in The Next Generation except for Picard. You brush it off at the end as a minor drawback, but the whole ""ensemble cast"" thing is what makes these films (and certainly made TNG so well-loved. It's not like in Voyager or Enterprise where you like about three characters and just sort of tolerate the rest. Every character on the bridge of Enterprise-D is an iconic face in television).  Now normally this might not be a terrible issue. I mean, peole love Picard and Patrick Stewart has massive draw for fans. Except we're recasting Picard, so what's the point?  Would you have watched Star Trek '09 if it axed out half the cast, including Spock?"
DaystromInstitute,3d0wfl,jimmysilverrims,5,Sun Jul 12 17:38:56 2015 UTC,No more prequels/reboots. Either drag the old actors out of their nursing homes for another film or start a new series with new people. The number one thing I hate is one actor's 'take' on another actor's character.
DaystromInstitute,3d0wfl,rliant1864,3,Sun Jul 12 21:21:11 2015 UTC,"I wish they would just experiment with different crews in short term miniseries and then further develop the ones that stick.  12 episode story arcs with different settings, topics, characters, ships and then a new continuity."

So many of the original series tech became a reality by the 80s and today much of tng tech has done the same.  We know so much more about the universe now and we could use this new knowledge to explore the ideas and theories on television.  Plus we have many new social issues that can be commentated on using the medium of Star Trek and its distance from the present to put it into perspective.  Reboots and rehashes can't do that   Star Trek isn't just a show full do drama and things that blow up. It is much more and this can't fully be realized when. You remake it and simply play tribute to it. By worshipping Star Trek for just being stR trek you actually lower its value ."

DaystromInstitute,3cx9n7,drafterman,19,Sun Jul 12 12:34:56 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine the Bynar having much longer names in a complex addressing scheme, perhaps somewhat similar to how IP addresses work on the binary level (not the octet abstraction that most people see). Additional information would be in front of their local 'name' identifying the network and subnet each Bynar was assigned to, with the local name being expandable depending on the needs of the mission/network, just as subnet masks do for IP addresses."
DaystromInstitute,3cx9n7,venom8599,18,Sat Jul 11 17:33:14 2015 UTC,"This is along my thoughts as well. They happen to be ""one"" and ""two"" in the local subnet, whatever the size of the subnet happens to be. Subnets are used to simplify local addressing, and expand the number of addresses possible without extending the length of the addresses to unusable lengths.   Just like how Seven's full designation is Seven of Nine, Tertiary Adjunct of Unimatrix Zero-One, there may very well be another Seven of Nine of Unimatrix Zero-Two.

DaystromInstitute,3cx9n7,TheChance,30,Sat Jul 11 22:24:12 2015 UTC,"I would suspect that the Bynar naming system is more complex than that, and likely isn't easily translatable to the spoken word.  For instance, maybe each Bynar is identified by their hash value, which would be difficult to pronounce.  So Bynars are given some kind of spoken name when they need to interact with other species, and in this case someone uncreative just named them ""one"" and ""two""."

DaystromInstitute,3cx9n7,electroly,3,Sat Jul 11 17:39:22 2015 UTC,"The Bynars share much in common with the Borg, obviously, so it wouldn't be a surprise if their naming conventions are similar. The Borg have task-based, temporary designations; Hugh was Third of Five on his scout cube, and we can be sure that there is a Third of Five on every Borg ship of that type. This designation would change if a drone bearing that designation was assigned to a larger group. The focus on the collective over the individual is so complete it overrides a sense of self as we know it to the point that what one does for the group is more important than who one is in the group.   With Bynar pairs, it's the same. The pairs are nearly identical, and their cybernetic implants connect them to their planet's central computer. They have no need for names outside of the role they are carrying out at any given time, so they are assigned temporary designations starting from scratch when needed."
DaystromInstitute,3cx9n7,MungoBaobab,6,Sat Jul 11 18:33:24 2015 UTC,"Borg number also seems to deem an importance to the drone based on that number - When Seven assigned designations to the crew, she 'demoted' one of the crew to a higher number."

DaystromInstitute,3cxfv6,Numlocks,3,Sat Jul 11 18:20:13 2015 UTC,Well maybe. Say all humanoid life has the potential to become Q after billions of years of evolution.

In this light, Q is the eternal doubter and is the Continuum's version of an atheist.  Most of the Q can easily follow the thread of time and see how humanity eventually becomes them, and just take it for granted.  But not Q.  He really does see a savage, child-race when he looks at us, and cannot conceive of how beings so violent and two-dimensional could ever evolve beyond their corporeal forms.  More than that, he rails against the deterministic nature of it all.  That humanity will just automatically become the Continuum, de facto, given infinite time?  Could reality really be so straight-forward, so predictable?  So boring?  So, he tests.  He pokes and prods the Enterprise and Voyager, Picard, Sisko, Janeway: the so-called ""best and brightest"" that humanity has offer.  He tests and waits for them to fail, to show their true colors, fall into their beast-like instincts, to prove that the thread of fate is nothing more than a fable and that the Continuum can be free to explore and experiment with all the potential that reality has to offer without having to tread on eggshells, shackled to their own history.  He tests, and prods, and he waits for us to fail.  He's still waiting."

DaystromInstitute,3cxj52,pimanac,7,Sat Jul 11 17:52:23 2015 UTC,"For the sake of debate: As a Starfleet admiral, I would still have to justify moving a warship away from DS9 for an extended period of time away from the station. We don't know, at the beginning of the episode, how long the Defiant will be away from the station. It could be weeks or months.  Using a runabout, or at least dropping her off and having a runabout pick her up would still be the more preferable option from an admirals standpoint.   All my opinions of course."
DaystromInstitute,3cxj52,williams_482,6,Sat Jul 11 17:59:09 2015 UTC,Was it stated in the episode how long the trip from Bajor to Trill would be at a reasonable top speed (probably warp 9 or warp 9.5)?

However there is often an underlying political consideration when we see this happen. Like in ""Sins of the Father"" when the Enterprise diverts to Qo'noS for Worf to defend his family, Starfleet likely supported Picard's decision in the interests of maintaining good relations with the Klingons. Similarly, in ""Equilibrium"" Starfleet knew that the Dax symbiont was extremely important to the Trill (who are Federation members) and supported Sisko rushing Jadzia to the Trill home world in the Defiant. If harm came to Dax because Starfleet was stingy with its resources, there would have been a huge political fallout. Starfleet may even have moved some ships closer to DS9 temporarily to compensate for the absence of the Defiant."
DaystromInstitute,3cxj52,Tannekr,5,Sat Jul 11 18:41:48 2015 UTC,"Which brings the question of why DS9 didn't have an entire fleet guarding her in the first place. I don't think it is ever stated in canon that a fleet of starships was waiting to help her out during Season 3-5. Only after Season 5 was a fleet stationed there at all times.   Granted, starfleet was a different beast from season to season in DS9."
DaystromInstitute,3cxj52,iansarmy1,5,Sat Jul 11 19:11:42 2015 UTC,"I think its one of those ""because plot"" sort of things. DS9 was supposed to be an outpost on the frontier with limited resources and Sisko had to deal with any problems on his own. The same can be said for why the Federation never had a dedicated diplomatic and/or humanitarian mission on Bajor. There's no real in universe logic for why DS9 was left on its own in the midst of huge threats like the Cardassians, Klingons and Dominion."
DaystromInstitute,3cxj52,Tannekr,7,Sat Jul 11 19:21:23 2015 UTC,"There is in-universe logic: DS9 is not a Federation station and Bajor have shown to be aggressively independent, even when Federation assistance would be in their favor."
DaystromInstitute,3cxj52,74159637895123,3,Sat Jul 11 19:35:40 2015 UTC,"I think that line of reasoning only goes so far. Early in the series the Bajorans are shown to have mixed feelings about the Federation but most certainly want its protection and assistance. I don't think they would have objected to a few Starships being permanently stationed at DS9 or a Federation civilian diplomatic/humanitarian presence. After the end of the civil war and the realization that the anti-Federation faction was being supported by the Cardassians, Bajor gradually moved towards Federation membership, which would have occurred before the Dominion War if not for Sisko's intervention. During that period they couldn't have possibly objected to a larger Federation presence."
DaystromInstitute,3cxj52,iansarmy1,3,Sat Jul 11 19:47:21 2015 UTC,"This doesn't work for me, because, from what I recall, Defiant is the only Starfleet ship we see stationed at DS9 until the start of the Dominion War. If Bajor really did want a larger Federation presence, then the lack of such a presence comes down to the Federation not being willing. Given the importance of the wormhole, such a scenario seems very unlikely to me.  On the other hand, the Bajoran's refusing a greater Starfleet presence in an effort to maintain an appearance of independence falls in line with what we know of Bajor and the Federation."
DaystromInstitute,3cxj52,meh4354,8,Sat Jul 11 20:49:39 2015 UTC,Well Starfleet moving in next door to the Cardassian Empire and stationing a fleet there might have been viewed as too big of a provocation for Cardassia.  The politics of the region make a fleet desirable and unwanted.
DaystromInstitute,3cxj52,sleep-apnea,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:54:16 2015 UTC,"This doesn't work for me   I'm not really offering an in universe explanation, I'm saying that there isn't one.    the Bajoran's refusing a greater Starfleet presence in an effort to maintain an appearance of independence falls in line    Like I said, that only makes sense up to a point. Bajor was on a path towards Federation membership by season 2, so considerations of maintaining their independence became increasingly irrelevant. Membership would entail ceding complete responsibility for their defense to Starfleet."

DaystromInstitute,3cxj52,butterhoscotch,3,Sun Jul 12 00:55:05 2015 UTC,"It makes sense for Starfleet not to keep a whole fleet near Bajor, prior to the Dominion war.  Bajor was not a member of the federation, and is very near Cardassian space.  In fact it's very close to Cardassia itself given that a solar sail craft can get there (by accident) at low warp.  Putting a fleet at DS9 would have been kind of like putting nuclear missiles in Cuba."
DaystromInstitute,3cxj52,Robotochan,2,Sat Jul 11 21:02:40 2015 UTC,"This actually is questioned in series before the Dominion retakes DS9 that starfleet resources are needed elsewhere. In reality there are only around 30,000 ships covering millions of square light years and not all of them are warships capable of fighting off Cardassians or the Jem Hadar. Before the war, starfleet was just starting to work on production of more capable warships but overhauling an entire fleet of ships where the emphasis was placed on exploration rather than defense takes a ton of time"
DaystromInstitute,3cxj52,SStuart,3,Sat Jul 11 19:48:20 2015 UTC,"I think warship is a slight exaggeration for the defiant anyway. Its a combat oriented ship for certain, but its fairly small in size.

Sisko specifically stated in the Search part 1, when they first got her, that the Defiant was a warship. She was a stripped-down, no-holds-barred ship, meant to fight a war and win it. Actually, meant to fight the borg and kill them. Really nothing else. It may have evolved as the show went on, but in Season 3, it was specifically just a warship, from my understanding and from canon."

We make risked based decisions all the time, including decisions where the risk is too great. Hell, we even have a saying to represent what the Bynars did: ""It's easier to ask for forgiveness than for permission""!

I'm also going to go out on a limb and say she was pretty pissed at him.  Perhaps if he was some other species or from the past, she could look past it, but he was a Federation captain from the future in a goddamn timeship and should have known better than to do what he did in such a rash manner.

Thats not even discussing cost or tactical doctrine. Its possible their potential battle or war strategies dont revolve around combat with cloaked ships and they have reasons for not employing them. Perhaps even a few have technology which is incompatible with cloaking.

You need to modulate your engines in a certain way so that you don't leave trails, you need to modulate your power a certain way, etc. Not to mention the same space could have been used for a bigger shield emitter or something.  It probably also stops progress to a certain point. Say you've just invented a fancy new warp drive that's faster and more efficient, but, for whatever reason, it renders stealth useless. What now?  I think there are more downsides to making something stealthy than just having to install a cloaking device.

For example, the wheel was never invented in the Americas. Printing was invented in Asia, but not in Europe. These ideas simply never happened in some places. However, these inventions were copied, bought, or stolen by other civilisations after one bright spark came up with the idea.  We know of only one civilisation in the Alpha Quadrant that actually invented cloaking: the Romulans, some time before the mid-2200s. The Klingons got their cloaking technology from the Romulans during their short-lived alliance (the same alliance that resulted in Romulans flying Klingon Birds of Prey). The Suliban in the mid-2100s were given cloaking technology by people 600 years in the future. The Federation had access to cloaking, but only after they learned that the Romulans had it: they played catch-up with the Romulans. In fact, they sent Kirk and Spock on a mission to steal a cloaking device.  It's possible that no other species came up with the insight that allowed them to develop cloaking, and noone else managed to acquire it from the Romulans, either through theft like the Federation or trade like the Klingons."

It's also noted by the Romulan crew in that episode that running cloaked consumed a lot of fuel - to the point where they were worried they may not make it back to Romulan space.  Klingons get them later on because they traded technology with the Romulans (TOS Enterprise Incident).  Later on, the Feds don't develop them because of the Treaty of Algernon, except in the case of the Defiant (which had one on loan from the Romulans), and the Pegasus (which was a violation of treaty and ended with the crew in mutiny).  Of course, they bugger the whole thing in Enterprise (as they always goddamned do) by having others (Suliban) show up with cloaking technology 100 years before TOS - even though Balance of Terror makes it pretty clear that they've never run into this stuff before.  In-universe answer - the Romulans developed them in the 23rd century, and other people got them via trade or treaty (Klingons and the Federation).

All Spock said was that it was 'theoretically possible' which doesn't say anything about whether or not it was already encountered.  What's more plausible given their surprise is that the 22nd century cloaks were abandoned for their disadvantages in the Romulan War and by advances in sensors (from Daniels). By TOS, it's just surprising that the cloak renders the vessel truly invisible.  Which I think is a bit more satisfying than simply insulting ENT."

The Federation and Romulans may be in a constant arms race in this area, with the Federation developing detection methods (for instance, the gas venting in Star Trek VI, the plasma coil thing in Generations, that time Data used space dust and torpedoes or something in ""Redemption Pt II"") and then the Romulans developing countermeasures for this. The Klingons might end up doing the same thing, with some more cooperation from Starfleet after the alliance.  So, okay, why are the other races not using cloaks? Well, the Cardassians might be unable to develop a cloaking device that could withstand Federation sensors, and the same goes for other relatively minor species.  Why don't the Borg use cloaking devices, though? I guess they just don't think they need them, like they're inefficient or something."

DaystromInstitute,3cu77c,SiliconApex,24,Fri Jul 10 20:29:10 2015 UTC,"I've read that due to the inverse-square law, the power of radio transmissions decreases rapidly as you get away from the source of transmission.  If you double your distance from the source, the signal becomes 1/4 as strong.  If you increase the distance 10 times, the signal becomes 1/100 as strong.  Because of this, all of our radio transmissions generated today become indistinguishable from background noise just a few light years away from Earth.  I was pretty disappointed when I found out it doesn't work like you see in the opening of Contact. (here's a link with some info)  Regarding optical telescopes, that's a bit harder to say because we know the Federation does have some pretty insane telescope technology due to use of subspace.  In ""Parallels,"" the crew discovers (in an closely related but alternate reality) that one of the Federation's subspace telescopes, the Argus Array, had been reprogrammed to spy on Federation sites like Utopia Planetia, many light-years away.  We don't know exactly where the Array is but we do know it's only 3 light-years from Cardassian space, implying that it is on the border of Federation space.  Using this kind of telescope, however, it seems that the time dilation factor is lost.  You are, in fact, seeing the target sites in real time or close to it due to subspace effects.  I've read somewhere, and I've looked for a source but couldn't find one, that with telescope technology like we have today, you would need an absolutely incredibly enormous telescope mirror to capture enough photons to put together any kind of meaningful image of Earth from hundreds or thousands of light-years away.  I don't remember how big but it was insane, like larger than the sun.  That's because there are fewer and fewer photons to capture as you increase the distance due to scattering.  Wish I could have found a source, can any astronomers back me up on this?"

DaystromInstitute,3cu77c,67thou,7,Mon Jul 13 04:50:04 2015 UTC,"The issue here is a conflict between the future technology of Star Trek and the limitations of modern technology and the laws of physics.  In Star Trek, Starfleet uses Subspace to detect ships and events in real time across vast distances. In the real world it would be impossible to detect a real time event across such vast amounts of space because all you could see would be an echo of where something was at one point. Subspace is a ""sci-fi"" method to get around this. But the effects are immediate not delayed and so using it to detect historical events as they occurred seems to be impossible.  Radio waves travel at the speed of light, so if you were to go far enough away from a planet you could in theory travel around at various distances in a species history and attempt to pick up their historical radio wave transmissions. The next issue is that these radio waves transmit in every direction and the further out you got the more dispersed and weaker they become. It would not be very far from a solar system before cosmic radiation and background noise completely destroys a radio signal beyond repair. Radio transmissions would need to be very powerful and very focused in order to traverse 400 LY and remain intact, something i doubt pre-warp cultures would be capable of.  As for an observatory that is able to ""view"" a planet at those distances duirng a time in the past, I am not sure something like that can actually exist, in the real world or Star Trek. Again because Star Trek uses subspace sensors to detect real time events at vast distances, they are not technically ""viewing"" them so much as detecting and translating an object and its effects, then extrapolating its apparent shape size and energy configuration. To literally view things in the past you would need to rely on its true reflection or light emissions, which travel at the speed of light. By the time it reaches a Star Ship sitting at 400 LY out, the light would be ridiculously diminished and probably lack so much relevant information that constructing a usable picture of an event would be impossible.  Your very last point could be possible but in a limited fashion, if they were to arrive within an hour or so of an event, it might be possible that they could travel out a distance equal to several light hours away and try to view the event. But again, at such distances the amount of light needed to reflect off the ship would be far greater than possible to prevent it from diminishing to a point where it was no longer usable data. The Earth sits roughly 8 light minutes away from the sun which is a distance of around 93 million miles. To view an object the size of a Star Ship at such a distance would require an absurdly large lens to gather enough light to make an usable image. Going out to several hours would push the distance to roughly 1,300,000,000 miles!!! This is the main reason why Star Fleet uses Sub Space to detect ships at such distances, because it can more easily detect the ships impact and energy output in subspace than it can detect the physical ship in real space."
DaystromInstitute,3cu77c,RoundSimbacca,2,Fri Jul 10 20:53:15 2015 UTC,"Radio transmissions would surely disperse, but it seems like a civilization with the Federation's level of technology could easily scatter a web of detectors over several light years to increase their detection capacity and have more advanced algorithms to cut through the noise and enhance the signals.  In regards to picking up an event a few hours ago, I would think that even if they can't get a clear image of what happened they should at least be able to pick up flashes of energy or light. It seems like they could at least say ""there was a flash of weapons fire at the same frequency as Cardassian weapons"" or something like that.  In any event, I think it is an interesting concept that would be fun to see explored in some contect in the Star Trek universe."
DaystromInstitute,3cu77c,jerslan,2,Fri Jul 10 22:05:13 2015 UTC,"You could most definitely make use of light speed propagation to spy/do research- until they stopped using light-speed transmissions. Unlike the other poster above, I think that the technology we see in star trek could differentiate between a transmission and static.  The Picardy Maneuver, besides in the fashion sense, utilized lightspeed delay to decoy an enemy vessel in battle. You could even listen to subspace transmissions, as they also have a non-infinite propagation delay as shown by Voyager's inability to send a subspace message to the Federation, one-way, in less than 10 years time."

If Braxton didn't get stuck in the past, then Starling couldn't have stolen his ship.  But if Starling didn't steal his ship, then Earth history should be significantly different and they should be hundreds of years less advanced technologically.

They destroyed the time ship, which stopped Starling's plan to go and get more technology, and also meant that the explosion in the future due to Starling's travel didn't happen, and Voyager's hull wasn't amongst the debris - Which changed the timeline, but didn't reverse the damage of the time ship itself (they do have temporal shielding, we find out in Relativity) - Voyager was still stuck in 1996 Earth orbit, with full memory of the incident (unlike in the year of hell, where the incident was erased), Braxton detected them being there when they shouldn't be and came to return them to the future and the delta quadrant. This left his previous self still on Earth, also shielded from the effects of the change.    In other words, timeships can create paradoxes."
DaystromInstitute,3ctl90,BloodBride,3,Fri Jul 10 22:28:01 2015 UTC,"I think that the issue is that in the first episode they have Braxton say that he never experienced that timeline. In the second episode they have Braxton in command of a ship seemingly fine and another, further along, Braxton that says he experienced the bad timeline.   So maybe there were two? Well, no, because they then proceed to arrest the good Braxton for crimes he would commit in the future.  All of this means that somehow the earliest Braxton crashed on 20th century earth, then a slightly later Braxton rescues Voyager claiming to have not been trapped on earth, then a much later Braxton is arrested for the future crimes of an even later Braxton that says he did crash on earth.   Am I missing something that could reconcile this?"
DaystromInstitute,3ctl90,Amakato,3,Sat Jul 11 04:03:38 2015 UTC,"No, there are two. As I said, time ships can cause paradoxes because they have temporal shielding."

DaystromInstitute,3ctl90,disposable_pants,10,Fri Jul 10 18:47:07 2015 UTC,"Quark didn't travel back 1000 years, though -- only about 430.  The question should be about the impact of a modern day engineer sent back to, say, 1585.    Assuming he was accepted as an actual time traveler (Quark was accepted as an actual alien) and had the support of a major world power (Quark would have had the support of the U.S.), our engineer would be able to be hugely influential:   Even if he was unable to create anything practical, he'd be able to advance math, physics, and probably a few other disciplines by at least a few hundred years.  The great minds that would pop up after him would have taller shoulders to stand on.  He'd also be able to jump start education spending.  He could tell his king that massive technological change would take a few generations at least, and that the best way to achieve it quickly would be to develop an educated populace. His understanding of the inevitable problems with monarchy and colonialism would help his country head off future internal political strife.  Simply by having grown up in a modern political environment he'd become one of history's greatest political philosophers, if not the greatest.  Ditto for military doctrine. Knowledge of basic manufacturing -- interchangeable parts, division of labor, inevitable labor issues -- could revolutionize industry even without technological leaps. Limited liability corporations could be introduced, spurring innovation.  Stricter protections of personal property (clearly defining what was yours and what you owed to the king) would also help. Building codes could reduce the chance of fire and improve sanitation. Encouraging the development of a reliable road network would greatly aid commerce and defense. Application of the scientific method to all areas of life (e.g. business) would speed development in multiple disciplines. Modern fitness and nutritional knowledge would dramatically increase the efficiency of the country's armed forces.   Now, what would he actually be able to make?   Practical steam power would probably be within reach.  It'd require a bit of metallurgical knowledge, an increased emphasis on coal mining, and some design skill, but much of that should be within our engineer's skill set. Crude bicycles might be possible -- the most trouble would probably come with the tires.  These would have many advantages over horses and could significantly change commerce and warfare. Basic sanitation would be easy and would have a massive effect in both peacetime and war.  Penicillin might be possible, too. Pedal-operated sewing machines (or larger, animal- or steam-powered industrial models) could make the textile industry more efficient and free up labor for other jobs. Reliable timepieces would make ocean navigation far more precise.   In short, there are many things we take for granted today that would be utterly revolutionary a few centuries ago.  The bigger question might be whether our time traveler could handle the social upheaval that would result from the introduction of so much new technology.  EDIT:  Another important point in discussions like this is that certain levels of technology are almost impossible without a widespread industrial base tailored to produce them.  For example, if instead of one engineer we sent back the entire staff of modern-day NASA, complete with all the information of their organization, they'd still be hard-pressed to put something in orbit within the following 50 years.  There'd just be no way to get the required materials or fuels.  Step 1 would be re-tooling the economy."

But I agree with you to a large extent - knowledge alone would take lifetimes to put things together, since a massive amount of infrastructure is needed by every technological generation. Each subsequent generation relies at least in part on the previous one for things like materials and precision manufacturing."

Kinda hypocritical of him to then pull the same card when Janeway asked for help later the same episode. Can one be hypocritical against an opinion from another timeline ? Now i'm confused.."
DaystromInstitute,3ctl90,BloodBride,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:53:51 2015 UTC,"The prime directive itself has been... 'bent' before to meet with the overall idea of the prime directive. And by that, I mean that captains tend to ignore it or be very vague about how they're upholding it. It's safe to assume that unless Starfleet became militarised in the future (and we have no evidence of that), the abuse of guiding principles would still be ripe. Braxton... prime, let's call him, detected an explosion in the future that wiped out a large sector. Upholding the Temporal Prime Directive would have been seen as undoing that mess - as Voyager's hull was in the debris, eradicating Voyager from time would presumably fix the problem. This failed. However, we now have an incident where the outcome was altered. We don't know how Voyager was in the wreckage of the prime universe explosion, but now the crew was aware of it in some way that wasn't present before. This Braxton prime is the 'crazy' one on Earth in the 90's. He refuses to help them as he still believes they're going to destroy his future and that he failed to protect his timeline... And he's sort of right. Whatever changes were made by the attempted deletion of the USS Voyager made it so that the explosion that devastated the future didn't happen - As such, Braxton didn't go back in time to delete them... But, their displacement was a temporal incursion made by a ship with temporal shielding - a field that seemed to localise around both ships, protecting them and their crews from time change in some way. So Voyager was stranded in the 90's and Braxton was stranded on Earth. Braxton Alpha now detects the USS Voyager in... the 90's, at Earth, instead of stranged in the Delta quadrant quite some years from this point, goes back and leads them through. He is surprised that the crew knows who he is, but explains he never experienced that timeline - for some reason, his scanners don't detect Braxton Prime, and he doesn't consider that if Voyager is still stranded here, his alter-self could be too. So voyager is returned home. Now here's where things get even more confusing. In the future from that point, but not the current timeline as far as the timeship timeline is concerned, Braxton Alpha again manages to discover an anomaly involving Voyager - a bomb set on it that stops it from doing what it's meant to do, planted by a time traveller. In this case, they decide the temporal prime directive can allow for them to take people out of one time zome to be an operative for the protection of the future on their own vessel as there will be less temporal incursion caused by a member of their own ship doing operations even though they have to explain exactly what happened to them. So they recruit a member of the crew to avoid suspicion from the crew to prevent an event that could will have going to have happened at some point in the future from this perceived point. In this instance it was Braxton Alpha recruiting people to stop Braxton Prime from blowing up their ship. At which point Braxton Alpha was seen as a criminal for crimes he... could will have been committed, in another timeline. Alternate universes and time travel make for participle tense confusion."

DaystromInstitute,3ctl90,philwelch,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:20:09 2015 UTC,"Well to answer the question accurately, we must examine the United States at the time, especially its relationship to the world. In the aftermath of the second World War, America stood intact among a sea of ruin that was Europe. It looked to east, to the great horde of the Soviets and were wary of communist subversion all around the world. I think that the USA would look at the Ferengi technology and see within it, a way to isolate and eventually destroy communism as an ideology. They would keep the tech secret and slowly turn to reverse engineering it, in the 1950s, the USA would be the first to have a presence in space, completely outclassing the USSR, and showing that capitalism was the way of the future. Over time they would isolate communism, winning the Brush Wars of the 70s and establishing pro-American puppet states, increasing the tensions of neighboring China. As a response, China and Russia have much closer ties than in our timeline eventually forming an alliance. The technological gap between the alliance and the USA was immense, so the two superpowers decided to invest in Eugenics to create superior soldier to counter the advantage of phaser and the emerging force feild tech. Soon in the 80s, tensions hit the breaking point and NATO declares war on the Red Pact, the Soviets and the Chinese launch their nukes, but they are shot down by phaser-based middle defense systems. NATO forces begin advancing through Eastern Germany into Poland where they reach a stalemate because of the genetic supermen at the helm. Similar to the Great War in the early 1900s, it would devolve into trench warfare with both sides having millions of men die for a few miles of trench. In the East, the war is much more fluid, with the Americans advancing through China but becoming bogged down due to the sheer landmass. After a decade of war, NATO decides to nuke the two countries to end the war. Russia and China lay in ruin as supermen act as warlords fighting for territory as the Stars and Stripes stands once more."

With that much data, you could make a huge impact with a 400 year head start. But you still wouldn't be able to build 24th century technology.  One problem is that technological innovations tend to build on each other. If you went back in time 30 years, you couldn't build an iPhone. Why? Because in order to design and build the microchips of 2015, you need a computer from 2010 at the earliest to run the latest CAD tools, you need materials and manufacturing that weren't available in 1985, you need the latest in batteries, etc. And each one of those improvements in itself rests upon an infrastructure of enabling technology. You need a wireless phone network. You need internet service delivered over that phone network. You need the kinds of services that make internet service useful to people and not just a toy. You need datacenters, distributed programming, logistics to back Amazon, machine learning to back Google. Now let's go back 60 years, to 1955. You don't even have an automated phone network yet. You have women sitting at switchboards. How can you possibly build an iPhone? Transistors have barely been invented. The integrated circuit is a few years away. The basic operating system that runs on it--Unix--won't be developed for another fifteen years.  OK, what if you want to invent the airplane 50 years ahead of time? Even if the engine was feasible (which is unlikely), and you built it out of cloth with a wooden frame as the Wright Brothers did, you're not going to end up with Spitfires in the 1880's, because Spitfires were made from an aluminum alloy, and the Hall–Héroult process that enabled mass production of aluminum was only discovered in the 1880's and hadn't been implemented at the necessary scale yet.  There are some inventions that are probably simple enough to not require all these prerequisites while still having a high impact (stirrups and shipping containers are two examples) but there are fewer and fewer of those inventions to discover as time goes on. Also, a lot of inventions require lots of detailed engineering; the specific solutions that were discovered between different designs of an engine or microchip or airframe or chemical process aren't necessarily recorded in the history books. Engineering is really, really hard and simply knowing the basic principle of a technology doesn't get you very far in actually implementing it. There are thousands of engineers at thousands of firms who each make tiny, incremental improvements to thousands of components and parts, most of which we are completely unaware of, and many of which are cumulatively necessary for the newest technologies to work."

Kirk, Spock and McCoy's trips to the past certainly confused the future, giving 1930s Earth two equally real, but mutually exclusive futures. They may act as the point of entanglement, explaining why the mirror universe is closest to the prime universe in their lifetimes, and periods fairly soon before and after it, as depicted in the DS9 and Enterprise episodes.  Of course the Enterprise episode is also a sequel to The Tholian Web, so maybe it's the Tholians that are responsible.

An exact date is not given, but given that Bajoran history is well over 20,000 years old, it seems likely that this was the first incursion.   This actually brings up another interesting point. In the DS9 relaunch books, Sisko has a vision of himself in the Celestial Temple with hundreds (but probably really closer to an infinite number) of his counterparts from other universes (e.g one where he isn't in Starfleet, one where he was assimilated by the borg, etc). The Prophets brought all of these Siskos together because in each universe, they had used Sisko (no matter the state he was in) as their emissary.

I would think that with what we know of the Mirror universe, it's a reflection of humanity if the base impulses were appealed to instead of risen above. More obviously sexual, more violent, less regard given to those attributes that our universe considers to be the goal of humanity. The Mirror universe is that reflection of the aspects of ourselves that are not necessarily darker, but would be darker if they were indulged in to excess. I'm not saying that violence has absolutely no place in a civilised society, or that being sexual is wrong, but if all of society gave in completely to those basic human impulses instead of trying to balance them with our humanity, then it would be something akin to the Mirror universe.

When Rom keeps making comments about how confusing it is in DS9, this was an intentional callout on how bizarre the concept even is the moment you start to apply it at large, in part because it's guided by writers, not a cosmic scale, which can alter how ""mirror universe"" is even interpreted.  There's a lot of ways to consider it, and how I'm going to describe it isn't perfect, but - imagine a dice. Specifically, consider the structure - numbers on opposite ends of the range are also on the other ""end"" of the dice. These numbers are all still part of the same range though.  Now consider yourself as a person - not just your own personal ""levels"" of things like tact, aggression and intellect, but how these aspects manifest - an artist might be known for vivid colours in their paintings. The most literal interpretation of the mirror universe might have that artist working in black and white, but I instead think it would be a finer distinction - they still work with potent colours, but on the other end of the palette, like favouring cold colours instead of warm ones.  This large scale consistency with ""detail"" inversion is apparent in a lot of characters mirrorverse depictions. The most obvious example is Sisko, in large part because ""they"" provide the largest amount of material we can compare. Both Sisko's stories are about men who lose their wife - Sisko Prime to Locutus; Mirror Sisko left her. They lead lives drenched in misery and resignation - Sisko Prime develops a starship out of revenge and it ends up shelved for some time, and he is then reassigned to what was supposed to be a backwater. Mirror Sisko runs away and becomes a pirate, resenting working under Mirror Kira but not viewing himself as hero material.  Both Sisko's are then influenced by beings from another ""world"" of existence - Sisko Prime by the wormhole aliens (represented by people he knows with alien personalities); Mirror Sisko by Kira Prime (someone he knows with a personality alien to him).  Both men then become hero figures; Sisko Prime is the chosen of the prophets and one of the most important figures in the Dominion War because of his posting; Mirror Sisko sparking the Terran Rebellion.  Mirror Sisko is then killed on a mission. Later, Sisko Prime is ""fated"" to leave our temporal level of existence, not dying but still leaving linear existence with work linked to relationships unfinished (Mirror Sisko needed to recruit Mirror Jennifer; Sisko Prime vanishes from the life of his son and new wife. Of note is that Jake has no mirror counterpart). Both were great tacticians, both are stubborn, and both clearly don't get along with some people, although it's more pronounced in Mirror Sisko's case.  To return to the dice analogy, imagine them being rolled on a glass table. You can look at that dice from ""beneath"" the table - the same dice are rolled; they roll the ""same"" way, but the face being read is different. It's the ""same"" set of dice, though.  Why do the dice matter in this analogy? Because Parallels shows there's a multitude of alternate realities where things are different on much more subtle levels, with differences gradually stacking until wildly different timelines are created. Again, the same dice, but the facing sides of the dice differ.   Differences like Jake not existing in the mirror universe aren't impossible to explain. Maybe Jake only has a 50% chance of being conceived across all of space-time, and one of the other dice being rolled is which between Sisko and Jennifer ""leave"" by one means or another - with the existence of Jake hastening the death of one. Maybe Jake is later created by the surviving spouse in a holosuite if he was never born, and Holo-Jake takes part in the Hologram Revolution by producing written works. This would be balanced out by Vic being a flesh and blood person."

They were doing the sorts of things they'd have been doing on the ship - monitoring and maintaining extremely high-tech systems.  So I would imagine the ""labor shortage"" was more of an ""education shortage"".  They weren't necessarily short on warm bodies, but rather trained minds who knew how to use the tech their society had come to depend upon.  It would certainly be interesting to revisit that civilization and find out more about how they got themselves into that situation.  Perhaps they automated everything so heavily that they reached a post-scarcity environment, and then nearly everyone just kinda checked out from being a functional member of society.  So you need to keep the machines running to avoid mass riots and civil disruption in general, but to reeducate enough of your own population to do it for you would be almost equally disruptive.  So you shanghai passing ships that appear to be of the correct tech level, knowing the crew of a starship would by it's very nature have to have the skills you're looking for."

DaystromInstitute,3ct4jp,notpatstewart,6,Fri Jul 10 20:44:31 2015 UTC,There was no labor shortage. It was a ploy told to the workers so they would never think to look  elsewhere for work.   No one in the alien bureaucracy involved in the abduction scheme mentions it when talking to another in the know.  It's always to brain-washed workers or outside aliens (the remaining crew on Voyager).  It was all about controlling the population and cost reduction.

Sure,  at some point,  something led this society and economy down this path,  and it's been in place so long,  the native population seems to be rich and therefore unwilling to question it."
DaystromInstitute,3ct4jp,Ardress,8,Fri Jul 10 16:11:16 2015 UTC,"But in a Star Trek-level economy, costs for everyday necessities are negligible. There's no need to ""cut costs"" in the way that modern economies are obsessed with.   Are you saying it just got started at some point in the past and is continuing due to inertia?   Either way, it strikes me as yet another example of the tendency for Delta Quadrant species to be parasitical -- like the organ-harvesting people, or the ones who gain new members by reviving and mutating dead bodies, or obviously the Borg. It's interesting to me that this peculiarity of the Delta Quadrant doesn't factor into many theories about the origin of the Borg (perhaps due to Voyager denialism)."
DaystromInstitute,3ct4jp,ilikemyteasweet,5,Fri Jul 10 16:15:36 2015 UTC,"Holy crap! You're totally right about Delta Quadrant species being parasitical! Dozens and dozens of species live in an adversarial equilibrium with everyone else. From episode one, the Ocampa feed off of the Caretaker, the Kazon, feed on ships they raid; you can loosely justify a lot of the species as preying on or feeding off of others from the Think Tank to the Hirogen. Perhaps the Borg are indirectly the cause. Species are encouraged not to be exceptional, powerful, or advanced and any that are are quickly culled, similar to Wraiths in Stargate Atlantis. Since Delta lacks the single homogenizing powers of the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma, (pax Federationa) there is naturally more conflict in general. Furthermore, the one big power there is, the Borg, is predatory and parasitic, setting the example for the rest of the quadrant; it works for the Borg so, being aggressive and self centered should work for us too. This also explains the less parasitic and more dominating species we see, like the Krenim and Devore; they are just following suit and taking what they want and stomping out those who resist.  Sorry, this had little to do with the OP but, I just had to indulge that train of thought."
DaystromInstitute,3ct4jp,at_work_alt,2,Sat Jul 11 08:00:05 2015 UTC,"The sheer number of civilizations in any one quadrant does not lend itself to supporting your claim of parasitic cultures being more likely.

Possible if the energy plant that most of Voyager is brought to is one that produces radiation, especially if there were to be a spill or leak, contaminating the plant's personnel.  Of course, that would mean that there is a real conspiracy, since no one seems particularly concerned about safety.    B) Life span issues (not breached).  They didn't really mention anything about the life cycle of the Quarrans, so I'm assuming they're fairly standard; but it's possible that they have an overly long venerable(elderly) period, which would indeed require more labor than they possess.  It's a theory, but really only useful if there are no elderly Quarren Workers; (I don't recall).    C) The technology is extremely useful, but still very new and they have yet to develop sufficient monitoring technology.  Seriously, it seemed like everyone was just monitoring levels, right?    C.a) Or maybe their culture has an aversion to machines doing the thinking for them, so as technology gets more and more complex, there are more and more monitors to make sure that the machines are doing what they are supposed to.  Eventually, such a society unwilling to outsource their minds to machines would have to seek another source- outworlders, whether willing or no.  It might sound silly to us, but if their culture is obstinant on machine-handled monitoring, then it does make some sense why there is such an urgent need for more brains."

Presumably, the producers of the later series would have stayed with that in order to keep things consistent, but also to reduce costs.  As a result of this, technologically advanced societies without robotics are assumed to be the norm, and concepts like technological unemployment are not discussed."

Granted, this isn't a mission from Janeway - Paris is a petty child and doesn't want to work as a nurse for a little while, so he recruits Harry to build him a temporary EMH to take over for him.

DaystromInstitute,3csagd,TheHYPO,7,Fri Jul 10 17:42:12 2015 UTC,"The issue of a back-up is slightly different then what me and /u/Kopachris are talking about here. Having a back-up is an issue of having enough physical storage lying around.  Rather this is the issue that transferring data necessarily copies it. Now, this copy exists in some sort of volatile state (running memory, buffers, capacitors, registers, cables) so it's not a back-up in the traditional sense.  The point being, here, is that when the Doctor ""arrived"" on the Prometheus, that was a copy and the original should have still remained within the Voyager data banks unless explicitly and purposefully deleted."
DaystromInstitute,3csagd,drafterman,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:58:40 2015 UTC,"I think I responded to the ""copy"" issue elsewhere, but I disagree that ""transferring data necessarily copies it."" - I mean, as a whole - it is entirely possible for a system to be designed that transfers one byte at a time - for file security, today's computers when ""moving"" a file, just copy it and leave the un-indexed data on the source; but if it didn't, it would be possible to do a byte-by-byte copy and delete (effectively moving each byte one at a time), rather than copying the whole file before deleting the original. It wouldn't be very secure to do so, imo, as any connection failure would result in two half-files and no whole copy of the data, but it's possible for a system to work this way.  It's also possible that while technically a ""transfer"" of the Doctor results in a copy being left where it is, if Voyager's computers are as busy as they seem they might be, new data might instantly start overriding the space where the Doctor's program used to be (in the same way that if you have a very full HDD, and you delete a file, you have very little time to recover the file before it gets overridden by new data, because that is some of the only available space remaining)."
DaystromInstitute,3csagd,TheHYPO,3,Fri Jul 10 18:04:22 2015 UTC,"for file security, today's computers when ""moving"" a file, just copy it and leave the un-indexed data on the source;   This is wrong on both accounts. When moving a file (on the same logical disk), it doesn't perform a copy, it simply alters the index pointing to the file. It doesn't do this for security reasons, it does it for efficiency reasons. Altering the file index is just changing a couple of bytes that tell the computer what folder it belongs to. Very quick to do compared to writing potentially millions of bytes at a new location.   but if it didn't, it would be possible to do a byte-by-byte copy and delete (effectively moving each byte one at a time), rather than copying the whole file before deleting the original. It wouldn't be very secure to do so, imo, as any connection failure would result in two half-files and no whole copy of the data, but it's possible for a system to work this way.   And here is here we get into the difference between copying/moving data around on the same logical medium and transferring it to a completely different medium. When you change medium, you are necessarily created copies of the information you have on hand. For example, when uploading a file from your computer to a website your computer (in a nutshell) is saying: ""Ok, I have a magnetic charged on the HDD here that represents a 1, so I will create a 0.5 volt charge on this cable here that also represents a 1."" There is no getting around it. This process doesn't destroy the original data. There would have to be a completely new process that did that, with the explicit intention of doing so.   It's also possible that while technically a ""transfer"" of the Doctor results in a copy being left where it is, if Voyager's computers are as busy as they seem they might be, new data might instantly start overriding the space where the Doctor's program used to be (in the same way that if you have a very full HDD, and you delete a file, you have very little time to recover the file before it gets overridden by new data, because that is some of the only available space remaining).   If they chose to perform an operation where the Doctor's program was marked as free space (as is the case when you move or delete files on a computer). But why would they choose such an operation as opposed to one (like a copy) where the original information isn't marked for deletion? The depiction in the episode is that Doctor's program is treated like a tangible object that is physically moved from one location to the next, rather than the computer program it is."

Also, ""security"" was perhaps a misleading word. I really meant ""integrity"" or security in the sense that if the transfer failed, the entire file would still remain at the source.   When you change medium, you are necessarily created copies of the information you have on hand.    I specifically acknowledged this, by my point is that even though you are ""copying"" data, there doesn't mean that at the end of the process (or even in the middle of the process) you still have a complete copy of the data on the source. The bytes which are sent may be deleted as soon as they have been written at the destination. The move itself may delete the source data, or the source data may be almost instantly overridden if the disk space is at a premium. You are also looking at future computers and assuming they work the same way as ours.  If I have data on a USB drive or disk in my computer, I could ""transfer"" that data into your computer by removing it from my computer and moving it to yours without a copy remaining in my computer. There are theoretical ways in which file transfer can happen other than the way today's disks transfer data between disks. It is possible that in the future there will be a whole new way to copy data in which some digital carrier mechanism (some digital version of a usb stick) literally transfers the data. I'm not going to guess how or why such a system might be used, but it's possible.  I think there has been some establishment that star trek computers still use binary to store data, but we have no idea what technology the computers of the future actually use to store and transfer that data. You're just assuming it's the same as present day.   But why would they choose such an operation as opposed to one (like a copy) where the original information isn't marked for deletion? The depiction in the episode is that Doctor's program is treated like a tangible object that is physically moved from one location to the next, rather than the computer program it is.   The real-world answer? Because if they could just make a copy of the Doctor, there would be no ability to put him in peril. We're all trying to come up with possible reasons, given the fact that the show establishes that he is transferred and not copied, why he would be transferred and not copied."

DaystromInstitute,3csagd,drafterman,24,Fri Jul 10 11:25:59 2015 UTC,"Right, but that's not how computers work. In transmitting the doctor, they are transmitting the raw information regarding his program through the array. At the end of the transmission, there are now two doctors: the one still stored within the Voyager's computers, and the one on the Prometheus. Sending information doesn't magically destroy the information at the source, you'd have to manually delete it."
DaystromInstitute,3csagd,NothingEverWorks,27,Fri Jul 10 12:28:14 2015 UTC,"I am a lurker on this forum, I love it here. This time I thought I would contribute a thought. I am a Computer Scientist so, while I am stretching with this I think it is a plausible idea.  In today's computers your absolute fastest performance comes from keeping all your active programs in memory and running them there, if you fault at any point and an error correction system can't repair it all your work is lost. It is plausible to think that all data in starfleet computers is stored this way and eventually during low compute cycles is written back to the protected core which is a costly operation and can't be done often.   Why is it done this way in starfleet? If you read the Next Generation Technical Manual, you will see it discussed that so much computing is done on a star ship that light speed computing is too slow. The computer cores are encased in a low level warp field to allow computing at FTL abilities. The physics of this make no sense, but I am OK with that. This operational state implies that all data in all the isolinear chips within the computer core is actually active memory and protected only by error correction. That error correction in the case of a Galaxy Class ship spans three computer cores and a protected core. That is pretty resilient but it is still likely your data could be lost and may have to be restored from the protected core and copied at lower than light speed back to the central core. This is an exceedingly slow operation, one could assume that backing up holograms, the densest data systems in star fleet with the highest change rate of data doesn't happen at all. Instead they opt for the exceptionally resilient holomatrix error correction system. It's OK if we make this assumption starships almost never lose all power, if they do, they are probably dead anyway.   Now if we consider Voyager, a light cruiser meant for short range operations, and a little more limited on space. It doesn't have triple redundant cores that operate at FTL so it's resources are a bit more limited. Enough that a dedicated computing unit is needed for the doctor an emergency system only. There is only enough operational memory in that system to run the doctor as needed and he is constantly in a running state just consuming low power while offline. In the case of voyager they don't have a protected core backup of the doctor because that would consume a lot of space on the ship and as we all know on a ship space is everything. Voyager shouldn't be far from a starbase if they lost their doctor program they could restore from a backup easily there. Unfortunately Voyager wound up far from home and that assumption was costly. There is no writing the doctor to the protected core, not enough space.   My final bit is an extreme stretch but I am going to go with it. I believe starfleet figured out how to make complex holomatrix systems by copying how transporter patterns work. There is only ever one human in the buffer at the destination or at the source. I don't think starfleet fully knows how to copy holomatrices because they haven't figured out how to copy and materialise more than one pattern buffer data pattern nor do they want to. The entire story around Thomas Riker backs this up. So I actually believe this is a fundamental gap in starfleet knowledge. They made the holomatrix work but they don't really know how. Therefore, there is only ever one copy anywhere and where it goes, it is all in every time.   I think it's a stretch, but a really cool idea. There are probably gaps in this reasoning but I could creatively close them. :-)"
DaystromInstitute,3csagd,drafterman,6,Fri Jul 10 15:33:25 2015 UTC,"The ""always running"" theory is interesting, though contradicted a number of times (The Haunting of Deck Twelve, Living Witness).  But I don't feel that we can get around the fact that transmitting data necessarily involves producing a copy of it. Data is not a physical thing, it is a concept which is represented, physically, in a variety of forms (magnetic fields, light and dark spots on a reflective surface, voltages of electricity, pulses of light).  Now, in some cases this does result in the destruction of that physical representation at some points. For example, a packet transversing a network. The voltages comprising that packet, when read by network devices, ""disappear"", converted into new electrical pulses used by the internal circuitry of the device, which eventually is lost when a new, outgoing packet is sent."

DaystromInstitute,3csagd,KingofDerby,2,Fri Jul 10 18:22:34 2015 UTC,"Thing is, what if your representation of the data is too complicated to get the raw code out of it? Like...a human brain. You can query it, and get it to give you data, but you cannot read from it directly. To copy the Doctor means not copying the data, but copying the brain that holds that data."

DaystromInstitute,3csagd,skwerrel,5,Fri Jul 10 19:29:25 2015 UTC,"That's not how modern computers work. One of the features of certain types of quantum computers is that reading data on them alters/destroys that data - this will eventually allow for impenetrable security, because you'll know instantly if someone even tries to access a communication stream and can shut it down before they get anything meaningful.   So i don't know how this works in star trek in general, or with holographic matrices specifically, but the idea that accessing or transmitting data could theoretically destroy that data on the source isn't completely farfetched really."
DaystromInstitute,3csagd,drafterman,4,Fri Jul 10 15:04:44 2015 UTC,"That's how quantum computers work for data in transit, not data at rest.

It is always ""transferred"" - to the portable emitter, and back to sickbay. It is made very clear throughout the series that there is no backup copy remaining one place or the other. Perhaps it's due to space issues. Perhaps it's due to the ability to make a copy of a running program. Perhaps it's due to a desire to avoid accidentally copying an old Doctor over the latest one by having only the one copy.  It's not made clear, but for whatever reason, the Doctor seems to only be transferrable, not copyable."
DaystromInstitute,3csagd,NotADamsel,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:44:49 2015 UTC,Maybe it's a failsafe baked into the system to prevent merge conflicts?
DaystromInstitute,3csagd,drafterman,2,Fri Jul 10 14:52:36 2015 UTC,"Any computer failsafe usually revolves around keeping as much data as possible in hand. After all, if there is a conflict, you usually trust the data in storage over the data in transit (the assumption being any errors that crop up were introduced during transit).  It's all the more important in this case they were already dealing with a situation where there was known signal degradation (hence the choice to use a holographic data stream)."
DaystromInstitute,3csagd,NotADamsel,0,Fri Jul 10 15:07:19 2015 UTC,"Right, but this is low-level stuff we're talking about here. Could it be that the doctor is, in fact, saved to state when he's transmitted but presented as ""moved""? This would enable the system to merge any new data back into the original program without it looking like there was a split in consciousness."
DaystromInstitute,3csagd,drafterman,2,Fri Jul 10 15:16:37 2015 UTC,"I'm talking about low-level stuff. Data at rest and data in transit are fundamentally different due to the different requirements of each. Compare the magnetic storage on a disk drive versus the electric or optical representation of data as transmitted through cables. When transmitting information, at this low level, you are literally copying it into a new form. The original data isn't altered at all, you are necessarily making a copy - albeit represented with a different physical media.  This wouldn't be any different in the 24th century because the needs of physical storage vs. transit would remain the same. For storage you want a method that doesn't require perpetual power to maintain and for transit you want something that's fast. There is no method of transmitting the Doctor that would necessarily result in the destruction of the original information and if there was, you wouldn't ever want to use it."
DaystromInstitute,3csagd,NotADamsel,0,Fri Jul 10 15:34:22 2015 UTC,"What I mean is, the system could have been designed to keep said copy of the doctor but act like it had moved him.  Our current computers do this, so I don't think it's a stretch to say that they might also do it in the future."
DaystromInstitute,3csagd,drafterman,2,Fri Jul 10 16:59:13 2015 UTC,"When computers ""act"" like they're doing this, they aren't actually deleting any data.

DaystromInstitute,3csagd,k8track,15,Fri Jul 10 17:34:02 2015 UTC,"The way they handle that is inconsistent and simply boils down to whether it serves the plot for that week or not.  In Living Witness, for example, there was a complete working backup of The Doctor."
DaystromInstitute,3csagd,Kopachris,5,Fri Jul 10 13:20:07 2015 UTC,"Then it wouldn't be possible to simply transfer him, either. It's a fundamental rule of all computers that if data is accessible and readable, then it's copyable (barring any artificial limitations created by how the operating system handles permissions, which is not relevant here). i.e. reading is non-destructive."
DaystromInstitute,3csagd,PM_ME_YOUR_PAULDRONS,4,Fri Jul 10 11:54:44 2015 UTC,Interestingly this is only true of classical information. Information stored in a quantum way may not be copied as a result of the no-cloning theorem.  Although you can move quantum information around wherever you like it is impossible to make a copy of the state of an arbitrary qubit without destroying the original.
DaystromInstitute,3csagd,omniuni,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:59:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, they actually mention that several times throughout the show. Also, if I recall, the doctor could be sent because his data was in a format compatible with the technology they found."
DaystromInstitute,3csagd,TheHYPO,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:59:27 2015 UTC,"They explained this for the same reason they couldn't KEEP a copy of the Doctor in case of emergency (including in that episode - if I recall correctly, that's the one where Tom and Harry try to build their own doctor and fail hard). Otherwise, they'd keep a doctor and any time he was on danger or lost, they'd have a backup. I believe the premise was that there was not enough space to make a backup or he was too complex to make a copy.  That said, I don't see why they had to send the Doctor. Even if it had to be a hologram, I don't see why they couldn't have programmed ANY hologram with the simple task of delivering a message. Yes, such a hologram would be non-sentient and would have failed to thwart the Romulans, but that possibility certainly could not have been in Janeway's mind when she sent the Doctor."
DaystromInstitute,3csagd,lynannouilh,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:38:19 2015 UTC,"They can't have two copies of the doctor running concurrently on the computer. The fact was often tackled by the writers. The doctor holographic simulation was at first very basic, and the computer on Voyager are the most powerful ever mounted on a ship (Bio neural gel packs). Even with all that technology, the ship must run multiple simulation and systems in check to operate at best capacity. And with time, the EMH gained consciousness and became very sophisticated, the memory to run his simulation is sometimes too much pressure for the ship computers, in term of memory and computing time.   To me, it's like the process to copy the doctor is too much for the computer to handle, in term of storage units and computing time. Don't ever think copying data is flawless and easy. And one bit misplaced in the doctor simulation copy could result in a catastrophic failure for his program. So data is rather unique, because in the future, data is too much to handle to be copied at will.   You can't copy all the internet in one minute, LCARS are like all the data of our world (and the federation), stored on ships, they only have one version, and accessing, copying it can probably damage the memory itself in the process."
DaystromInstitute,3csagd,Custard-donut,12,Fri Jul 10 19:14:51 2015 UTC,"Janeway only had forty minutes to come up with a plan to communicate with the ship at he other end of the communications network which would allow them to relay the information that Voyager was still around so selecting the Doctor was probably the simplest plan.  While another hologram can get the information across the Doctor has shown he can think on his feet which should help Voyagers case if someone thinks it's some kind of sick joke. As you've mentioned there's the morale boost on the ship (I might add that it would be beneficial for some of the people at home as well), if everything goes according to plan but there's also the chance that Starfleet has discovered something which would allow them to reach Voyager sooner than she can make it home herself."
DaystromInstitute,3csagd,calgil,4,Fri Jul 10 12:08:25 2015 UTC,"The fact that the Doctor can think on his feet also shows how invaluable he is to the crew though. Absolutely the Doctor was the BEST choice to send...but also the worst thing to lose. So it's more prudent to choose a hologram which may not be able to think so quickly if needed but also is replaceable. I don't even see why the messenger needs to think on its feet...send it with video data in its memory files which prove the situation. The Doctor may be charismatic but more important is hard evidence which any hologram could carry. Frankly surely any Romulan would most likely distrust words and only respond to hard proof. It obviously worked out in the end but that's because we of course weren't going to lose the Doctor...but given the same choice I would have kept him and sent something unequivocal the Romulans would definitely accept. Captain Calgil would rightly have considered the EMH probably the most invaluable asset on the ship...I am not losing it.  Besides, the Doctor was notoriously poor socially. Romulans tend to dislike humans and get ruffled by them easily. Why send your most curmudgeonly envoy in that situation? 'Computer: send a hologram with a personality that would be pleasing to a Romulan and give it all of Voyagers memory files.' Why not do that?"
DaystromInstitute,3csagd,duodsg,2,Fri Jul 10 17:47:53 2015 UTC,They had no idea Romulans had taken over the Prometheus when they sent The Doctor there.  They didn't even know what the Dominion was!
DaystromInstitute,3csagd,calgil,8,Sat Jul 11 01:46:51 2015 UTC,"Although a big part of sending the Doctor was certainly because of plot reasons, remember why they considered sending him in the first place: the ship (the Prometheus) was about to leave transmission range, so they had to find a way to guarantee that the Prometheus not only received the message but ALSO took it seriously. They didn't have the luxury of setting up a comm link and batting around the whole ""are you really who you say you are?"" dialogue. It just happened to be convenient that the Romulans were trying to make a clean getaway and therefore wouldn't have answered a Starfleet hail/message anyway. Sending the Doctor WAS necessary- they needed to send the message WITH context and proof that it was legit. Why NOT send the EMH, which was capable of in-depth explanation of Voyager's situation to Starfleet? A one-off message could easily be faked, whereas the EMH's signature is so complex that it acts like a ""fingerprint"" to prove that it's the EMH unit specifically from Voyager. He then gives Starfleet ALL KINDS of info about Voyager- where it's been, their current course, how to communicate with them again, who's still alive (for contacting families), what technologies they've gained, etc. The EMH was, quite frankly, the BEST person to send by virtue that he basically has a lot of the ship's collective ""memories"" and can be downloaded quickly. Even if they had sent Janeway herself, in person, they wouldn't have gained as much data since she's human and would have forgotten a lot of things or left important details out. I would also like to think that their considering using a holographic subroutine is because they possess some backdoor brute force ability to self-download and install that guarantees that the message (or in this case, the EMH) to actually get onto the ship. Voyager would be totally screwed if the ship didn't answer the hail or declined the message, and they needed to take a big risk since this was the only time this opportunity came up in their entire voyage. Every other communication with Starfleet after this happened as a result of their communicating with the Prometheus, so the payoff was well worth it. If I was in Voyager's position with only a few minutes to send a potentially game-changing message back home, I'd do the same thing."
DaystromInstitute,3csagd,vey323,3,Fri Jul 10 13:36:48 2015 UTC,"Your final points are in hindsight and don't affect the decision making process. Jane way didn't know at the time how useful it would prove to be. So many things to go wrong, it was still a balancing act which I feel as though would have been better met by sending an inferior hologram."
DaystromInstitute,3csagd,calgil,10,Fri Jul 10 17:39:17 2015 UTC,"If memory serves, their standard methods of communication were degrading before they reached the Prometheus. Opting to send a hologram was their only reliable option, given the short amount of time they had.  Could they have cobbled together a holomatrix to deliver the message ""we are alive""? Probably, though it would likely be limited in what it could report - not truly interactive.  But the Doctor already had working knowledge of everything Voyager had done up to that point; not only could he answer questions,  he could ask them as well, which was just as important.   TLDR: the Doctor was the best tool available in their short time frame to not only send information,  but receive it as well."
DaystromInstitute,3csagd,TheHYPO,2,Fri Jul 10 13:35:46 2015 UTC,'Computer: create a hologram of Genghis Khan with all of our Delta Quadrant knowledge from our memory banks. Ok we'll send this.'

Plus, Starfleet might change things up again in a few years anyway, so they'd be at the same resource wasting point.    Real World:   Resources. It's expensive to create costumes, and they'd have to make a bunch of new costumes for the cast. They's stranded, so why bother? To separate DS9 from Voyager. You'd know at a glance what show you're watching (though that's likely the case either way), plus it gave each show a different ""feel"".

Federation colonies were ceded to the Cardassians and vice versa.  Those in the Maquis felt that the Federation had abandoned them to the tender mercies of the Cardassians.  In some cases, Federation colonists were forcibly evicted from the worlds they had settled to make room for Cardassian colonists.  Also the Cardassian military was funneling arms to the Cardassian colonists in the DMZ to attack Federation colonists long before the Maquis even formed.  The Federation core worlds turned a blind eye to it because maintaining peace was far more important to them than ensuring that the Cardassians abided by the treaty.  And if the colonies in the DMZ had officially declared independence from the Federation, that would mean that the treaty would be null and void and the Cardassian military could send ships to deal with the problem."

It's like saying you think the US military haven't done enough to protect you from ISIS, so declaring war on the US  The treaty was between Cardassia and the Federation, not those specific colonies. The whole point of a DMZ is to provide a buffer zone so those two empires aren't bookended together, same as the neutral zone. Neither side would tear up the treaty unless they wanted to go back to war, and neither side can build up a military presence in the area while the treaty exists. The only reason either side had to send ships into the DMZ was to pursue Marquis, and that was something that both sides could agree was worthwhile.  Most of the Marquis were not from that area of space. They were only fighting because they had a grudge with the Federation, and had hijacked the conflict.

Yes, there were members of Starfleet that joined and they were in higher positions within the Maquis due to their greater experience, but the Maquis was most definitely a regional movement not an exterior force causing trouble in an area.  You seem to be missing the rationale of the Maquis entirely.  Imagine if you built a house and then your government says that the land your house sits on now belongs to a neighboring country.  You have two options: Move or live under the rules of the other country.

The Federation had ceded some of their home planets to Cardassia, which obviously didn't sit well with them after they were evicted. Pair that with Bajorans who are still angry about the occupation of Bajor, and disgruntled Starfleet officers and Federation citizens who disagree with the Federation's methods, and you get a band of militia fighting for what they believe in.  In VOY, the Maquis are grumpy because they hate Starfleet. Chakotay, for example, was disillusioned with Starfleet for refusing to take a stand against Cardassia.  Imagine this hypothetical modern-day scenario: Let's say that Russia decided to send troops to the Middle East and occupy Israel. They proclaimed that they were being ethical, while reports of labor camps and horrible treatment of Israeli people were pouring out. That might make people angry. The US, being diplomatic, might decide to take non-aggressive action and wave a stern finger at Putin. The UN could sanction them, and eventually, attempt to reach a treaty. Let's say the treaty is signed, and as a result, territory encompassing a good portion of the Middle East was ceded to Russia. After gaining these territories, let's say Russia then evicted all of the native people to leave the region under threat of force. This sets the stage for a militia to form out of disgruntled refugees, backed by Israelis who are still upset about being occupied, and sympathetic outsiders who want justice to be done.  That's essentially what happened in Star Trek, but in space, and on a much larger, much more violent scale."
DaystromInstitute,3cswm0,RaceHard,7,Fri Jul 10 18:57:13 2015 UTC,"You're right, they were kind of just angry at the Federation. Starfleet officers tend to be very idealistic, in fact everything we know about Federation and Starfleet culture suggests this idealism is strongly encouraged.  Remember Picard's speech about duty? There are higher loyalties even than to the Federation itself. These officers felt that the Federation had betrayed their core values in the name of political pragmatism. They were appalled.   As for their actual goals, that's hard to say. Maybe they thought the border conflict would drag the Federation into an all-out war that would settle the issue once and for all."
DaystromInstitute,3cswm0,Sometimes_Lies,5,Fri Jul 10 17:44:00 2015 UTC,"I agree, Picard went off at Wesley for lying by omission to defend a fellow squad mate. The first duty of every Starfleet officer is to the truth. Such idealism is encouraged within every cadet. I wouldn't expect otherwise from those that defected to the Maquis."
DaystromInstitute,3cswm0,RaceHard,5,Fri Jul 10 20:16:02 2015 UTC,"Why are the American natives angry that they got relocated? Why are the Australian natives? Why would you be angry if your would be forced out of your house? Sure, very rational people would say: ""Ok, I will adapt and leave the land I grew up on"" - but others are rooted deeper into their home and would rather die than leave it."
DaystromInstitute,3cswm0,Sometimes_Lies,3,Fri Jul 10 19:50:25 2015 UTC,"I disagree with OP, but I don't think this is a fair comparison since it's overlooking one of the main points being made.  The people being forced out of their homes were colonists, not original inhabitants. An analog to the situation wouldn't be native Americans being forced to relocate by Europeans, more like being a French colonist in Quebec and then finding out that your home suddenly belongs to England.  It's still something people would get upset over, though. I guess a lot of the question, to me, depends on how recently the colonies were founded and how much work went into them. Are these new colonies that were only set up a few months ago, or have they been established for a few generations?  I think there's a big difference between ""I don't want to leave, I just finished replicating all my furniture"" vs ""I don't want to leave, my grandparents were born here and it's the only home I've ever known."" The prior is annoying and offensive but not really worth a war, while the latter is something that people will die for. As far as I can remember, it's never clear which situation it actually was."
DaystromInstitute,3cswm0,RaceHard,4,Sat Jul 11 01:06:22 2015 UTC,"It's something in between. One of the first worlds slated to be evacuated was Dorvan V, a colony settled in 2350 by a group of Native American colonists.   In 2366, a peace treaty ended the long conflict between the Federation and Cardassia. This truce enforced an end to active hostilities but left unresolved many of the major questions of the conflict, such as the fate of both colonies and colonists along the Cardassian border.  The Native Americans from Dorvan V claimed that they had a special, spiritual connection to their world, and refused to be evacuated.    So the colonies existed for 16 years when the first ones where forced to leave. Michael Eddington defected to the Marquis 2372.  The Dominion finally destroyed the Marquis.  The only large group of Maquis remaining were aboard Voyager. They learned that the Maquis had been massacred when Seven of Nine learned how to use an ancient Hirogen communications network to contact the Alpha Quadrant in 2374.   In short: 16 year old colonies gets forced to leave and fight back for 8 years before the they get destroyed."

DaystromInstitute,3cswm0,Trickquestionz,2,Sat Jul 11 06:45:06 2015 UTC,"That's a very rational, detached stance to take on it, though. It's not without merit, but it also assumes that people are capable of just ignoring their emotions/sentimental attachments and acting on pure logic.  There's also something to be said for the value of a community (because it's near-certain that not everyone will relocate to the same place), culture, history, wasted work, etc.  All of this is of course ignoring the elephant in the room, their sense of justice, as they felt that the Federation had no right to give away the land in the first place. They might've ""claimed"" the planet, but they did so via the very colonists who are now protesting the decision.  Even if they did have the right, it's rather infuriating that the Federation would knowingly allow the Cardassians to break the treaty while looking the other way, pretending the violation wasn't happening, and still expecting their own citizens to abide by it. Particularly since the violations in question involved attacks against those citizens...  Basically, if the Maquis had been a bunch of displaced Vulcans I'd agree that things should've gone differently. That's generally not how humans (either in real life or the show) work, though."
DaystromInstitute,3cswm0,BrellK,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:28:21 2015 UTC,"My view is detached because I am seeing it as a logic problem. In their society there is no resource issues. Nor the need for a job to sustain oneself. So relocation is a mere inconvenience, not a real major problem. With subspace comms, they can stay in contact with pretty much anyone they know.  I do not care if my grandfather fought on x war for y beliefs, they have no hold on me. And that is on this reality, I have moved before, I hold no allegiance to a flag nor country. Dirt is just that, dirt. And this is with the restrictions upon my life, them being the need to sustain myself thru work in order to have a place to shelter me from the elements and food to feed myself.  The colonists have the choice pretty much made already. They can just replicate their home elsewhere with almost no issue. And they do not have to worry about finding new working accommodations to sustain themselves. So their attachment to a piece of land is ludicrous  and entirely based on irrational, emotional behavior.  As adults they should know better, they should be far more centered and objective. These humans are supposed to be better than us, they are supposed to have changed and become greater than their ancestors, yet they react as they do."
DaystromInstitute,3cswm0,cdcformatc,2,Sat Jul 11 07:44:15 2015 UTC,"I see what you're saying, but I don't think the kind of detachment you describe is all that consistent with the way humans are portrayed on the show.  Even if they're more enlightened than us, I feel like stubbornness is still one of their defining elements. It usually works out in their favor, and is presented as a positive. So too is their strong sense of morality/justice, which the Federation's decision of ""adhere to the treaty even while the other side is violating it to hurt our citizens"" definitely violated.  I also feel like your own lack of attachment to a place is as much a value judgment as having an a strong attachment to a place. I don't think it's fair to say that one is objectively better than the other. Would the Federation as a whole really be served if all its citizens ""owed no allegiance"" to it?  For that matter, if everyone were extremely willing to abandon their homes and cede territory, do you think the other major powers would respect the sovereignty of the Federation? It seems like the Klingons, Romulans, Cardassians and probably many others would see that as a weakness and leap at the chance to exploit it.  As for not needing to work to sustain themselves, that's true. However, they do still work. The difference is that rather than being forced to work out of necessity, they choose to work out of strongly-held philosophical beliefs which tell them that it's both important and right to do so. I'd wager that someone who spends their entire life following their passion is a lot more likely to resent their work being disrupted, compared to someone who spends their life working out of necessity alone.  I'd also argue that staying in contact with someone via subspace is wholly different from living next to them and working together towards a common goal.  Really, if you consider history, culture, desire, attachment, work, passion, etc all irrelevant - what's even their motivation for living? Just eating and procreating? It's basically stripping away everything that makes humans into humans. If that's seen as a good thing, heck, why not just join the Borg and be done with it?  I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, sorry if it comes off that way. I'm just really curious, since it does sound like you're suggesting all the attributes I've listed are bad. What's their purpose in life? How can one decide which desires ""should be"" pursued/avoided?"
DaystromInstitute,3cswm0,KingofMadCows,0,Sat Jul 11 08:55:19 2015 UTC,"Huh, interesting. To be honest the borg ARE a near perfect society,but individuality is something I value. And that in and out of itself is paradoxical. I cannot value individuality without being an individual so its biased.   Now, onto ceding territories, its correct. The federation as a whole would not be served if the citizens held no alligiance to it. But this is not the case here, what i argue for is that its a done deal. A tactical and logistical movement that cannot be at present be reversed. Those colonies are gone, but there are others available. Should the federation fight for every scrap of land out there? Debatable, but futile in the grand scheme of things. Should it cede more worlds? Hardly, however the population of ceded worlds should accept that they just were no in a logistical, political, or strategic locale that valued the planet enough to fight for it. They lost and should accept that loss and live to fight another day.  Instead the maquis are stubborn about their loss. Understandable due to attachment, sure. They hold onto some powerful values, but they can relocate elsewhere and think of another solution. Instead they behave no better than an enraged klingon, lashing out at everyone.  Would I be upset if I were on their position? Yes, would I do as they did? No, I would move elsewhere. But honestly I am more of a traveler. So I have a biased point of view, I would much prefer to travel on ships all over than settle in any one planet. My purpose would be exploration, if I was told there was this huge section of space I can't explore, honestly I would accept it because space is unimaginably large, and there is much to see.  Does it make me incredibly angry? Oh yes, it would. Would I want to strangle some cardassians? Certainly, would I do that? Probably not, their necks remind me of snakes, and they are all cold too... Also I have to see things from their perspective and in many ways they are trying to live and expand. So long as the federation knows how much to give and how much to take I think even I could back them up. And I hold little care for the arbitrary lines that countries wish to draw upon maps. I think that if I can do that, others must be able to see equally.  Does this help answer some of the questions?"
DaystromInstitute,3crbac,wiseoldsage,26,Fri Jul 10 03:38:30 2015 UTC,"Starfleet crews have included social scientists in the past. Kirk's Enterprise included ship's Archaeologists, Anthropologists, and Historians. And Dr. McCoy often served as an informal ship's ethicist in counseling Kirk on command decisions.   Even Picard had a ship's Historian on board, as seen during ""The Big Goodbye"". Troi serves essentially the same role on the Enterprise D as McCoy in giving advice. Aside from her obvious role at Picard's left hand on the bridge, she often serves in a more specialized role in first contact analysis situations. Troi and Data work together figure out the Tamarian language in ""Darmok"". Perhaps Troi, in addition to being senior Counselor in the Medical department, also is dual hatted to lead the Social Sciences and First Contact Division that we never saw on the Ent-D, but is an essential part of any deep space mission in uncharted territory."
DaystromInstitute,3crbac,moving_average,38,Fri Jul 10 05:21:46 2015 UTC,"So IRL, this is actually a medical specialty. Like, in a hospital, there will usually be a clinical ethicist who has studied ethics and especially biomedical ethics in an academic setting, and this person is consulted for any ethical dilemmas that may arise in practice.  In Starfleet? Making the right ethical decision is part of the burden of command. When the crew face a moral dilemma and need to make a decision about what to do, the ultimate power lies in the person whose job it is to make decisions. This is the definition of command; the commanding officer makes decisions and the crew carry them out. If you introduce an ethics officer, then either the ethics officer makes the decision and the captain is redundant, or the captain overrules the ethics officer and the ethics officer is redundant. You might say this is true for every other officer, but it isn't; the captain doesn't tell the engineer that he's miscalibrated the warp drive, nor does he tell the science officer that his sensor readings are wrong, nor does he tell the doctor to use a hypospray instead of a dermal regenerator. The other officers are all have expertise and specialties that the captain doesn't necessarily have. But you can't have another officer who specializes in ethical decision making, because the act of making ethical decisions is exactly what the captain is supposed to specialize in.  The idea is also uncomfortably reminiscent of Soviet political officers."
DaystromInstitute,3crbac,philwelch,11,Fri Jul 10 06:31:47 2015 UTC,"It's funny you say that, particularly in light of the other responses, because when I was young I once asked my father what exactly Troi was doing on the bridge and how she fit into the command structure (before they solidified her as a commander in the science dpt), and he said ""think of Russian subs and their Political Officers."""
DaystromInstitute,3crbac,sindeloke,5,Fri Jul 10 11:06:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, up to a point. Certainly it would feel like that to anyone actually from the 20th century (just like anyone from the 12th would see all of us as horrific Satan worshipers), but it's more about a deeper and more sympathetic appreciation for the human condition than we are ready to have in our own time.  The presence of counselors on line ships and exploratory cruisers doesn't mean as much to the people of the 24th century because everyone takes calculous by ten who knows what advanced physiological and emotional training humans regularly get in an education curriculum that incorporates knowledge from across the galaxy and from hundreds of sentient species? Presumably social acceptance of mental disease is equivalent to that of physical disease in the 24th century (unlike in the 20th/21st, when disease of any kind is something to be ashamed of because of the social stigma attached to it) and most people (especially the highly professional Starfleet) just see them as medics for a part of our existence that in the 20th century was seen as a weakness, one's psychological stability. Troi never seems to force her attention on to any crew member who doesn't think they need it."

DaystromInstitute,3crbac,Noumenology,6,Fri Jul 10 14:44:35 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to disagree.   In the same way that the captain may ask the advice of the chief engineer or medical officer, they can consult the ethics officer when it is relevant.   And just like with the other officers, the captain may have good reason to ignore their advice and make a different call.   In Starfleet? Making the right ethical decision is part of the burden of command. When the crew face a moral dilemma and need to make a decision about what to do, the ultimate power lies in the person whose job it is to make decisions.

DaystromInstitute,3crbac,THE_CENTURION,19,Fri Jul 10 16:42:56 2015 UTC,"I believe they had such a person.  Why exactly does the counselor warrant a position on the bridge? To  the captain's immediate left, no less. The counselor is being placed in a position on the bridge that symbolically rivals the first officer's. The D's bridge layout is saying ""the first officer is the person the captain will speak to the most, with ship's 'counselor' coming a close second.""  IMO the ship's counselor is more than just a glorified therapist. I think that on a normal ship the counselor is supposed to act as chief of psi-ops, advisor on xenopsychology and alien culture, as well as eithics and philosophy advisor. I think that they're supposed to cover all of the 'soft' bases that become relevant to a ship's mission.  If we assume that's right for a second, the question becomes more about why Deanna Troi wasn't fulfilling that role. There've been a few good theories: that she was a political apointment because of her mother's position, that her empathic abilities made her useful enough to cover her other shortcomings (you can imagine the admirals' excitement at getting an 'acceptable' betazed into that position).  I think that this role exists on starships, that Deanna Troi either didn't realise (because the full extent of the role may be an open secret to avoid damaging SF's public image among other species, or because she grew up in an alien culture), and SF command think they can cover the gap she creates by having a captain well versed in the 'humanities'."
DaystromInstitute,3crbac,dodriohedron,16,Fri Jul 10 05:35:21 2015 UTC,"I think she did fulfill that role. however picard sorta overshadowed her in that role in most scenarios. Whats there to do when your boss has already done the job or is already on the right path?  when picard goes off rails, she's there to try to guide him back... and then she's done at that point... picard will do the philosophical/diplomacy work.   i'd imagine she would be much more active if a lesser captain was in command.  or even riker. think of it like NFL head coaches. some have play calling duties, some delegate that to their coordinators. Picard is the head coach that has taken play calling duties from troi. maybe thats because troi isnt good enough, but i think its rather that picard is that much better at it."

Rescue the girl and violate the Prime Directive, or not rescue the girl and respect the Prime Directive?  Well, it depends. If you value life more than cultural preservation, you would choose to go ahead with the rescue. If not, you would not rescue the girl. Can an ethical advisor choose the correct option? No, cause there is no right choice. What the ethical advisor recommends depends on his convictions, not on some unbiased external notion of what is morally right or wrong. So he is redundant. In the episode, Picard already got different opinions from his staff and made a choice according to his convictions and experience. Putting an extra guy there with his own biased opinion would not make any difference."

DaystromInstitute,3crbac,mimrm,3,Fri Jul 10 05:56:48 2015 UTC,"I think the theory is that ethics and philosophy are a vital part of Starfleet (and probably even just general Federation) education and experience, every bit as much as tactical or sciences or diplomacy. Captain Picard is a perfect example of this, someone who's studied culture, history, and philosophy extensively and who actually applies it in his work as captain of a ship of exploration and diplomacy. While the concept of a species which specializes in ethics is an interesting one (I recall reading a science fiction novel called The God Equation which featured such a species, though I can't recommend the novel), I believe the idea is that social sciences are so vital they're taught to everyone.   There are a number of times we see the senior staff of a ship or outpost carrying out a complex ethical debate wherein there are no clear right or wrong answers, attempting to suss out the best solution. I think that's what you'd want."

If every episode included a philosophical debate or a lecture on morals, the show would slow down and become too boring for a broad audience.  Having a smattering of episodes specifically devoted to a moral crisis or a conflict between philosophies is more entertaining, since the next episode would most likely be back to aliens and last second technobabble. You have to remember, ST was about selling a show so advertisers could buy airtime and pay for the show.  If you alienate the target audience (mainstream prime time viewers, perhaps skewed to the geekier segment), advertisers flee, and the show gets cancelled."
DaystromInstitute,3crbac,Quiggibub,2,Fri Jul 10 04:32:15 2015 UTC,"Ethics have to do with right vs wrong. What is the correct course of action? What is the ""right"" thing to do here? etc.  By the very nature of ethics, there is no universal accepted answer. Starfleet can certainly make rules about how it choose to operate. It can make rules about how its officers should approach certain circumstances (first contact, etc). But, it certainly cannot dictate what is ""right"" and what is ""wrong."" Indeed, some great stories within all of the Star Trek series have had to do with the ""rightness"" of an action.   Starfleet couldn't supply someone who can provide an absolute opinion on that, because it is ALWAYS a matter of opinion. And the commanding officer of a starship gets to make those decisions."
DaystromInstitute,3crbac,CaptainJeff,2,Fri Jul 10 20:22:17 2015 UTC,"In TOS we do see a very diverse science team on the Enterprise that includes anthropologists, historians and sociologists ) who advise Kirk and participate in away missions. In TNG there is at least one historian and an arecheologist aboard, there are also mentions of other social scientists from time to time. However I think the implication was always that Starfleet officers (especially in the command division) were extensively trained for interacting with alien cultures and making on the spot decisions, so the social scientists were there for occasional consultation and longer term research.   Social science also has inherent limitations that preclude standardized ""by the book"" answers to specific situations.  One of the main things that separates it from the hard sciences is that it is dealing with systems that cannot be  wholly quantified and predicted; empiricism can only take you so far and social science is more about providing a broad theoretical framework to analyze and understand a society. For instance, If I were a political scientist or sociologist on board the Enterprise, I would be much more useful in recommending how the the Federation and Starfleet should engage with a new alien culture in the longer term. Like in the ""The Cloud Minders"" I couldn't tell Kirk with any degree of certainty what the long term effects of desegregating Ardana would be, and in any case he had to make a decision on the fly based on both his need for zenite to stop a plague and his adherence to Federation ideals."
DaystromInstitute,3crbac,iansarmy1,2,Fri Jul 10 20:49:01 2015 UTC,"I'd argue they already have enough people for that, especially given that they've already got specialists e.g.:   First contact specialists (TNG The Game). Anthropology and Archaeology (TOS Who Mourns for Adonais?, TNG Who Watches the Watchers?). Historians (TOS Space Seed). Exobiologists (TNG The Game, VOY Equinox). Exopsychologists (DS9 The Abandoned). Xenolinguists (ENT Fight or Flight). Cultural Observers (TOS Patterns of Force).   The other issue with having ethicists and philosophers on board is that it basically serves the purpose of second-guessing the Captain's decisions.  This is fine in an academic setting, but on a ship with a chain of command and sense of discipline to maintain, it could be detrimental to the CO's authority and autonomy.  Also, there's the practical element of space on a vessel.  If I was Captain, and I had a handful of spare berths, would I want to have:   More engineers (ship goes faster, repairs go faster)? More security (for tactical scenarios onboard and planetside)? More medical personnel (to help out in emergencies)?

Presumably they do because otherwise their organs would die, but maybe the nanites convert the energy and ""nutrients"" they get from the alcoves into water.  So they probably sweat, and they might urinate (I guess...). And they probably don't care about the smell. I don't think there would be a rotting flesh smell, but there might be.

And that's just natural organic smells. Who knows what all the mechanical stuff requires to operate. The whole thing might smell like motor oil.  On the other hand, maybe borg nanites keep them and their spacecraft very clean. They convert waste and grime straight into vital materials for the Collective!"

It might be done via the regeneration pods in order to save on energy/equipment but I'm not sure energy/equipment scarcity is a problem for the Borg.

We've seen cases where the Borg have no problems surviving in the Vacuum of space. So why are body heat and humidity even a concern? Much less an atmosphere throughout their ship.

The first two are odorless, but elemental fluorine gives the odor to antozonite which has the rather pleasant common names of: stinkspat, stinkfluss, stinkstein, stinkspar, and fetid fluorite!

She's joyful and cute   Granted, I haven't watched an episode of DS9 in a year or so, but... that is not how I remember Kira. At all.   As far as episodes from the first couple seasons that you will have seen, I remember Duet in particular as a good Kira episode dealing with her feelings about the Cardassians.   I will grant you that her relationship with Bareil doesn't add much... Bareil was possibly the most boring character on the show. But Kira's terrorist past clearly plays a large part in how we see her now, so I don't get where you're coming from overall."
DaystromInstitute,3cscqe,sasquatch007,6,Fri Jul 10 13:20:24 2015 UTC,"Haha, you highlighted the exact parts I was going to quote as well. I was trying to think back on times I can remember Kira outright laughing at something. It seems extremely rare.  I can think of her often using a soft, careful smile, and she can certainly revel in the moment with the rest of the crew, but ""joyful""? Nah. ""Cute""...um.  I would describe (edit: early seasons especially) Kira as passionate, strong, sometimes aggressive. She definitely mellows out as the series progresses, but I don't want to spoil anything for OP.   Bareil was possibly the most boring character on the show   One time in this forum someone referred to a ""boring orange puddle that only pretends to be human 16 hours a day"" and I legitimately thought they meant Bareil before I realized they meant Odo.   Yeah, Bareil dragged the show (and Kira) down, and it also sometimes forced her to be unrealistically open and romantic, which isn't really reflected in her behavior in any other aspect of the show at that point.   I do think the Bareil/Winn/Kira triangle sets up a whole lot of fun conflict in the early seasons. I found it amusing rewatching ""In The Hands of the Prophets"" the other day when Keiko asks how much support Winn has to become Kai, and Kira strongly retorts ""she has mine"". Oh, lord."
DaystromInstitute,3cscqe,yoshemitzu,25,Fri Jul 10 20:37:47 2015 UTC,"My problem was that Kira seemed to be more bark than bite as the series went on.    She survived the Occupation and killed a lot of people, but she rarely gave off that feeling of ""dangerous"" on DS9 - she felt more like a nagging mother-in-law.   Take a comparison with Garak - he wouldn't issue death threats incessantly like Kira, he'd just poison you while you slept.  Meanwhile Kira threatens Quark every other episode...  And then every so often the writers would remember she's Bajoran, get Kira shoe-horned into some forced religious story, but otherwise she could have easily been a regular Federation officer.    It's like an on-off switch with Kira... unless the situation specifically requires her to be an ex-rebel Bajoran fighter, you don't really see it come out in her mannerisms or personality."
DaystromInstitute,3cscqe,sisko4,2,Fri Jul 10 13:25:10 2015 UTC,"Everyone threatens Quark, though -- and Odo does far more than Kira.  I think they generally view him as a ""necessary evil""; someone who stops short of being a terrible person and who is just useful enough to make it worth keeping around.  Plus, Quark is notoriously slippery -- even if they wanted to nail him for something they'd need proof, and they aren't ever quite able to get it."
DaystromInstitute,3cscqe,disposable_pants,12,Sat Jul 11 06:53:12 2015 UTC,"While I like Kira quite a lot, I understand some of your criticisms. I think a lot came down to the casting. Nana Vistor is a good actress who could pull off a lot of very weighty dramatic scenes like in ""Duet"", but overall she was somewhat miscast. She could often come off as far too bubbly and well adjusted for a character who fought in a terrible war from the age of 13, killed civilians in terrorist attacks and whose only surviving parent was murdered. She didn't have the strong screen presence, underlying darkness or sense of being truly dangerous that the character really required. It was just out of Nana Vistor's range as an actress, even when the writing tried to take her in darker directions she couldn't maintain it. The best she could offer on a regular basis was a surface level fieriness. It also didn't help that she isn't a very physically imposing woman; seeing her instantly take down hulking Klingons, Cardassians and Jem'Hadar with double fist hammer punches is pretty silly.   DS9's creators had originally planned for Michele Forbes to reprise her role as Ro Laren, instead of creating a new character with Kira,   but Forbes turned them down. So Kira was the plan B. I think Forbes would have been a stronger presence, but Nana Vistor was a talented enough actress that being miscast didn't drag down the series as a whole."

DaystromInstitute,3cscqe,Me-Power-Me,2,Fri Jul 10 21:43:31 2015 UTC,I sometimes wish the Michele Forbes plan had worked out. She played the the role of Ro Laren quite well. There was never any doubt in my mind that she could be a friendly personable officer but could kill you in a heartbeat without batting an eye. Perfect ex rebel/guerrilla fighter. I sometimes could get that feeling from Nana Visitor but only occasionally. And I believe it would have been a much more entertaining show if we had been watching Ro delve into the religious aspects of Bajoran culture. Especially with her being a Starfleet officer dealing with other Bajorans looking to Sisko as the Emissary.
DaystromInstitute,3cscqe,Carpenterdon,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:37:49 2015 UTC,"On one hand I agree with you completely -- you'd think someone who'd fought through an asymmetrical war would have more visible personal demons.  But on the other hand I can see how being more understated works well as an inversion of typical expectations.  The cliche portrayal of Kira would be someone who's tortured by their past and presents herself as a brooding, troubled, serious person.  A more nuanced and realistic portrayal of Kira would be someone who can live a normal life but occasionally has to fight with issues that resurface."

DaystromInstitute,3cscqe,Auronous,15,Fri Jul 10 21:51:01 2015 UTC,"I think Kira is my favorite ds9 character.  Her character arc is more understated than Sisko, Bashir, Worf, or Odo, but she has one.  First a note about her personality: she is capable of being very loving and has an open heart. The number of episodes where she acts as a surrogate daughter or mother to another character is large. She acts as Jake's mother when Sisko dies in ""Visitor"", she acts as Ziyal's (sp) mother for almost a season, she acts as Ghemor's daughter in two episodes. She even carries O'brien's son to term. Why is a former terrorist such a wonderful friend to so many instead of a more tough or cynical character?  Two reasons: 1) Its refreshing, and the writers can avoid a stereotype.  2) She has deep faith. She believes it was a necessary evil to fight the Cardassians, but now wants Bajor to return to its peaceful ways rather than become cynical or warlike. (This fits with her as a foil to Wynn).  3) There is nothing unrealistic about being a soldier, and being kind  or loving. My great-grandfather who fought in WW2 is an example that comes to mind.   Her faith is also a central aspect of her character that I find compelling. She is motivated by a vision of Bajor from the past carried forward during the occupation by Kai Opaka and her other religious teachers. She I think has always been motivated by a desire to fight for a utopian vision a better world--just like people in Starfleet. The Bajor she wants is a flourishing artistic, agrarian and religious community, lacking any of the social injustice she suffered under during the occupation. The episode where she must convince the old man to leave his home comes to mind. She initially is just doing her duty, but as she lives with him she more and more finds his lifestyle compelling. That idyllic lifestyle is what she fought for, and now she is working to destroy it with modernization just as the Cardassians did.  A note on Bareil: Her relationship with Bareil is very important to her faith. In their dialogue it is clear that they initially do not agree on religious views, with Kira being more conservative. Bareil is compassionate towards everyone, and he believes in or at least does not oppose the Federation.  He also represents a way for Bajor to move forward from the occupation without moving backwards. The occupation has made a stricter brand of faith popular, as everyone yearns for the old days (that may not ever have truly existed). Bareil I think knows that it is unrealistic to think Bajor can move backwards, and he sacrifices himself to move it forward.  I think this interplay with Kira's more tradition oriented view is interesting, and reading between the lines may have influenced her to be more open to the Federation.  Kira is also tough when she needs to be--mostly when her family or adopted family is in danger. (Yes her threats to Quark are mostly empty. They are designed to scare him, and I don't think she would do them if he wasn't intimidated.) She can take command. She fights hand to hand and wins against all kinds of opponents. As the series goes forward she has fewer moments where she just gets angry randomly. She is unsettled every time she must confront her past, preferring her new identity. She is not moved at all by Dukat's request to join him in his rebellion, and during the war she is a good soldier but never appears to relish or enjoy her work (unlike Garak at times). It becomes pretty clear that she no longer wishes to be a soldier or rebel, and has no romantic notions about it. The Kira we see, who is cute and joyful, is the person that she fought to be for years against the Cardassians. I find watching someone successfully navigate this just as compelling as a character who struggles and cannot shake the violence of their past.  Maybe by most standard better writing would make obstacles harder to overcome in order to show struggle and drama, but Star Trek is bout hope. Successfully putting a past of violence/opression/injustice behind you and becoming a well rounded loving person is a very Star Trek kind of hope.   Kira and Odo: could be an entire post, so I'll skip it.  Lastly the relationship between Kira and Sisko: Initially she seems a bit xenophobic and does not get along with Sisko. However, she is able to keep this under wraps most of the time. As the series goes forward, again motivated by her faith but also by her time with Sisko, she looses her xenophobia.  As Sisko learns to love Bajor for what it is, Kira learns to respect the Federation and its ideals.    Kira is dynamic in other ways:  She shows bravery and leadership when she handles the Shakar crisis. Shakar is even a bit surprised by her. He changes from viewing her as someone he must protect to someone he respects and want to be in a relationship with.  This episode shows how Kira and the other rebels have changed since the occupation. Its not exactly on screen dynamics since we don't see the occupation we just see Kira post-occupation, but this episode comes pretty close to showing us how she has changed.  Kira as a person of faith who learns to be tolerant and progressive, and whose faith motivates her to do good in the world, is a welcome character in Startrek where it often seems secular humanism is the only alternative that can deliver those things.  Just as Humanity had to move forward from WW3 and the Eugenics wars to become the united and utopian society we see today (and did so using secular humanistic principles), Kira and other Bajorans after the occupation try to move their society forward to a more united and utopian society (and do so based on their faith).  Kira as a woman who is capable of deep compassion for others while at the same time being tough and a leader is also welcome. Kira as a character who avoids stereotypes and is dynamic is even more welcome.  I think that she is well written for those reasons, and I think she is well acted because I find that I smile and feel with her in most of her episodes."

She too is one of my favorite characters and reading your analysis was a pleasure.  If you have time, I would be very interested to hear your thoughts on Kira and Odo.

DaystromInstitute,3cscqe,LernMeRight,6,Sat Jul 11 02:56:06 2015 UTC,"In a lot of ways, DS9's setup is similar to shows where a guy and his kid rides into town, seeking to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life and get out into the frontier life where real men are made before going back home.  After arriving, however, something goes down and down the guy is tied down to the town and he has to become the town's new sheriff and the deputy, whom feels they should get the job, gets passed over for this outsider, this foreigner, who thinks he knows better because he comes from the city and not the country.   And just as tension rides into town the desperado outside the law and scaley-neck his posse creating chaos-  but wait, the natives whom are connected to their great spirits are threatened by this posse and it so happens that new sheriff discovers these spirits are not just myth, but passive power players in his very dynamic outpost that connects to the mysterious orient far beyond the ocean.  and blah blah blah.  Kira is the deputy to Sisko's calvary-man-turned-sheriff and sadly, for such a rich backstory and excellent actress, they never put it to serious use when they could have.

DaystromInstitute,3cscqe,DevilInTheDark,2,Sun Jul 12 06:58:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, I've always said this. She was meant to be a battle hardened freedom fighter but came off as a preppy brat. Ro Laren in that role would have made for a far more intense dynamic with Sisko."

DaystromInstitute,3cscqe,jonnyta,3,Fri Jul 10 12:43:20 2015 UTC,"Kira was also one of my least favorite characters - I felt like the different aspects of her personality/character (her religious beliefs, being in a terrorist cell, etc) were never really reconciled - and a lot of her actions felt false or hypocritical as a result.   I also may just not be fond of Nana Visitors as an actress. I read that Ensign Ro was initially planned to be in place of the Kira character, but Michelle Forbes turned it down - I liked Ensign Ro a lot, and I would have loved to see her in DS9 instead!"

DaystromInstitute,3cscqe,KingofMadCows,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:58:26 2015 UTC,"Some of the best episodes of DS9 had Kira as the main character - particularly Duet, Return to Grace, Progress.  She was also fantastic as the seductive and sadistic Intendant of Terek Nor in the Mirror Universe episodes (not that those will win any prizes in and of themselves anytime soon).  If you're only in Season 3 - don't worry, it gets better, particularly towards the end when she has to organise resistance movements.  On the other hand, Rom stays just as annoying (if anything, he fucking gets worse if you can imagine that)."
DaystromInstitute,3cscqe,MexicanSpaceProgram,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:52:05 2015 UTC,"I think Kira was a great character. She just had a different role in the early seasons. She was meant to be difficult and create conflict. Where Dukat, and Kai Winn where supposed to be obvious antagonists, Kira was the Wildcard. She was Loyal to Sisko, the Federation and the Provisional Government, but only as far as they weren't at odds with her Rebel Instincts, friends, and Religion.   This becomes a bit more subtle as things in the Bajoran sector stabilize, she becomes friends with her crewmates, and the series hits its stride, but she still has her moments where she's still a Bajoran officer, a former Rebel Fighter, or a follower of the Prophets.   Combined with the pain of living her entire life through the occupation, seeing her family personally destroyed by a man the fates demand she constantly work with, and her conflicting loyalties, she makes IMO, an amazingly complex and sympathetic character with more than enough kick-ass to keep her interesting as a lead."
DaystromInstitute,3crkzk,Varlist,22,Fri Jul 10 05:15:01 2015 UTC,"Even with the super strong future materials that starships are made of, their size and the forces applied to them by the propulsion systems are both of a scale where the ship's hull would strain and deform under the stresses, possibly to the point of ripping itself apart (same goes for external impacts from things like weapon hits).   To strengthen the ship to the point where it is rigid enough to hold its shape, field emitters are placed throughout the ship, working on principles similar to tractor beams and force fields, supplementing the material strength of the ship's structural components.   In emergency situations such as combat, the ship may be performing extreme maneuvers that require additional power be diverted to avoid damage."

The system was replaced by the more-effective shielding introduced in the Constitution class.  By the TNG era, both systems were used together to further increase the surviveability of starships."
DaystromInstitute,3crkzk,Arcelebor,4,Fri Jul 10 07:24:41 2015 UTC,"It's a fun theory, but it doesn't quite work because the NX-01 needed a structural integrity field for standard impulse maneuvers just as much as all future ships did. Remember, Archer only gives the order to polarize the hull plating in potential combat situations, or occasionally when there is a risk of collision with something. Perhaps Enterprise's SIF was essentially a ""lite"" version of the defensive polarization of hull plating, but we don't have any evidence either way on that."
DaystromInstitute,3crkzk,williams_482,3,Fri Jul 10 19:01:03 2015 UTC,"The impression I get is that the NX-01 did have a SIF (perhaps less capable than those of TOS and TNG) but the polarized hull plating was basically an extension of the same effect to make the hull harder to damage, but projecting a SIF at such a high power level was inefficient so they later switched to proper shields and used SIF just for basic structural integrity."

DaystromInstitute,3cr4wj,deb1385,9,Fri Jul 10 02:44:08 2015 UTC,"I think these are two totally different concepts of ""Sanctuaries""...  The one's you're referring to now? Clearly only a city level thing, and I can't blame them for not using City Funds to enforce immigration. With our current Law Enforcement structure? They have other things to worry about and it's better left to the federally funded ICE (formerly the INS) to deal with.  I imagine this is an issue in cities where they don't want the local jail to be crowded with people for illegal immigration when they should be putting drug dealers and violent offenders in there.   The term ""sanctuary"" in this case? Only means you have a lower risk of being found out and deported. Just because they won't use city funds to enforce immigration law, doesn't mean they won't pick up a phone and call ICE.  In DS9? The Sanctuaries were a real thing that were being considered around the time the episode was written (IIRC they had been written off as a bad idea by the time it aired though). These Sanctuaries weren't voluntary ""Safe Havens""... If you couldn't get a job (for whatever reason) and couldn't pay rent? You could be picked up off the street and essentially confined to one of these ""Sanctuaries"".  All that said? It's hard not to draw parallels between the motivations behind the Bell Riots and the Occupy movement."
DaystromInstitute,3cr4wj,jerslan,10,Fri Jul 10 03:19:46 2015 UTC,"While I don't think that sanctuary cities will lead to anything like the situation we see in the Bell Riots, it's entirely possible that we are headed in a broader sense in the direction predicted by the writers of ""Past Tense"". (Oh I get it, a double entendre!)  What we see in that episode is that large chunks of the city have been essentially walled off and into those areas are placed all of the impoverished people. It creates a center for low-employment and thus exploitation of workers for low wages, homelessness, food insecurity, drug-use, and crime.   So how could we get there from here?   1) Continued economic inequality due to under-regulated capitalist systems, crony capitalism, regulatory capture, and the purchasing of legislation due to lax campaign finance laws. One necessary ingredient in a situation above is extreme poverty, and right now we have a recipe for economics and governance that seems almost designed to create poverty. Under-regulated capitalism means things like the convergence of large corporations and even natural monopolies, which creates dependence and kills competition. Dependence on a few massive corporations for goods and services severely limits customer choice, even for the most informed customers, and ending competition means that natural market forces that drive down prices and drive up quality are no longer major factors. What this means is that the power is taken from the many consumers and given to the few producers. And a lack of living wage laws or regulations on income mean that upper management in these few producers receive the vast majority of the profits while workers have a lower share, which means that they have less to spend when they get home. Not only does this make them more dependent still, it also means less money flowing through the economic ecosystem, which shrinks the economy and gives those who already have money a great deal more power. This would be bad enough, but financial institutions who are constantly caught manipulating the markets, laundering money for drug cartels and terrorists, and outright looting money from the innocent get off Scotty-free because our regulatory structures are woefully inadequate. Obviously, this is a very shallow and quick summarization of a more complex situation, but at the end of the day this is a recipe for extreme economic inequality.   2) Eventually, someone is going to figure out that private prisons and gated communities are the same thing, and try to combine them.   Private gated communities have existed for centuries, but more recently in the suburban explosion they've become far more common. I live in one myself. The idea is that one separates their own, special (wealthy) neighborhood from what's 'out there', the implication being the impoverished who might want to take their things. It's a way to conceptualize the wealthy as inherently law-abiding and those who are not wealthy as inherently less law-abiding. Obviously this is absurd, but the prevalence of gated communities means that, even if only on a subconscious level, this way of thinking is pervasive.   Private prisons were actually on the decline for years because of constant issues with rampant corruption and abuse. They originally came into prominence because of the 1980s wars on drugs and ""tough on crime"" policies under Reagan came into effect, putting in place harsher punishments and dehumanizing criminals. There was a massive incarceration increase, which allowed private prisons to take some of the pressure off public prisons. Almost immediately, reports of abuse, violence, and corruption came to light in regards to private prisons, and a slew of lawsuits crippled the profit-margins of the business. By the late 1990s, it looked like the largest private prison company in the country (and world), CCA, was going to have to declare bankruptcy. So the industry pivoted. Instead of basing their business on the dehumanizing of criminals—a resource that was drying up—they instead based their business on the dehumanization of undocumented immigrants. Private prisons found an ally in anti-immigrant groups, and soon legislation like the Illegal Immigrant Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, which authorized the mandatory detention of immigrants (with or without documentation) with any criminal records, the number of detained immigrants skyrocketed overnight. After 9/11, anti-immigrant groups seized on the situation, pushing for new levels of immigration enforcement and filling the pockets of law enforcement in the process, incentivizing locking up immigrants.   But here's the thing: poverty even among citizens is on the overall rise. Some estimates say that 99% of new income since the economic crash of 2008 has gone to the so-called 1%, while the wages for most have either stagnated or have declined, despite any inflation (stagnant wages during inflation are, in reality, falling wages because purchasing power decreases). While we're living in a time of relatively low crime, we're living in a time of growing poverty and desperation, and it's very often the case that the desperate are forced to choose between nothing but bad options and can choose criminality. And unlike the most wealthy, the criminal poor are subject to imprisonment.   The problem for private prisons, however, is cost. Public and private prisons, due to harsh sentencing even for nonviolent offenses, are extremely overcrowded. My home state of California was in hot water a year or two back over the poor treatment of prisoners because the state is having serious trouble affording to house them adequately. The terrible solution, which seems inevitable to me, is to wall-off preexisting structures, a la 'Arkham City' from the Batman games. This significantly reduces the cost of construction and manpower to watch the prisoners. It's not legal now, but because of the problem of campaign finance,  regulatory capture, and the privatization fetish, I believe it could happen. Maybe not in California, but somewhere in the US.   3) The class war. I mentioned dehumanization above, but I think it bears its own section of what has turned into quite the rant. There is a very dark part of human nature which comes from a sense of the separation between man and nature, and that is the ascribing of subhuman value to an individual or group of fellow humans. Some of the most extreme cases are how slave-owners conceptualized slaves as being essentially a different species, a lower species of human. In Nazi Germany, Jews were referred to as ""ratten"" or rats. More recently during the terrible Rwandan genocide, the Hutus referred to the Tutsis as roaches. Some dehumanization—perhaps the more insidious kind—is more subtle. If we look at the recent national debate about how law enforcement can and often does treat black Americans, we can see examples of dehumanization popping up, things like ascribing criminality as an inherent trait to black people. These feelings find their genesis in the concept of an adversary. Adversarial relationships predate humanity and have found their way deeply into our psychology. When we have an enemy, someone or someones who have a strongly conflicting interest with our own and who might threaten attaining my goals, I am likely, over time, to create in my mind a negative stereotype of that person or those persons, in opposition to the positive stereotype of my own side. They are morally corrupt while we are morally virtuous, we are for some positive goal like order or progress or justice while they are for negative goals like chaos or regression or injustice. We project our own faults onto the enemy and this intensifies our hatred for them because on some level we understand those to be our faults. Our own faults are discounted while the other side's virtues are similarly discounted, and before long it's no longer a conflict between equals, it's a black and white conflict between humanity and something else, something lesser.   This process has been happening between the haves and the have-nots in cycles at least since the dawn of economic classes during the development of agriculture. Just as the managers and leaders of that time had to content with the collective power of those who were workers and who had little then, the same thing is happening now. I described above extreme economic inequality, and that inequality is magnifying the adversarial relationship between the current generation of haves and have-nots. The poor resent the wealthy for operating a fixed system, for hoarding the wealth for themselves, and for the even baser reason of them wishing they were also wealthy. And, in response, the wealthy resent the poor, often projecting unto the poor failings like laziness, a lack of intelligence, expecting handouts in exchange for nothing, and a poor work ethic. And it's getting a lot worse. Because one class holds more control over government and popular media, ideas about the poor are pervasive, about how they simply need to buckle down and work hard in order to find success—a myth. Those who can't do this are seen as lazy failures, despite the fact that many if not most of the poor are every bit as hard working as the wealthy, and are separated more by factors like the luck of birth than anything else. And resentment is growing. The Occupy movement and more talk about economic inequality is making some of the wealthy feel under attack, and they're retaliating.   If this process continues, if the media and government are continuously used to demonize and dehumanize the poor, it's entirely possible that concerns about treating human beings with at least a basic level of respect and dignity will be drowned out by the class-war.   While I wouldn't say the exact scenario in ""Past Tense"" is likely, I would say something similar enough to it could be. If the poor are focused into small areas and are treated poorly enough, there can and will be a reaction, possibly even a violent one."
DaystromInstitute,3cr4wj,Willravel,3,Fri Jul 10 16:50:09 2015 UTC,"I think America is at a cross roads right now. Income inequality is at a point where people can work all the hours God send and still can't afford to raise a family. Racial inequality is also a big factor in poverty. The political system is currently stacked against the interests of the individual, and certainly the poorest of them. Here I'm reminded of this exchange between Sisko and Bashir:   Sisko: It's not that they don't give a damn. They've just given up. The social problems they face seem too enormous to deal with.  Bashir: That only makes things worse. Causing people to suffer because you hate them is terrible. But causing people to suffer because you've forgotten how to care? That's really hard to understand.  Sisko: They'll remember. It will take some time and it won't be easy. But eventually people in this century will remember how to care.   As a foreigner living in the US this is fairly galling. Because of my background I blame it on the apathy towards the political process. That is how I see this problem being fixed. ""More political participation!"" I cry. But several Americans I talk to about this will say things like ""another civil war is coming."" I've always laughed that off, and gently made fun of those making that statement. But then I read that some scholars are stating that a revolution type situation is brewing in the United States. So maybe something worse than riots is coming. I don't know, but I do know that what is going on now cannot continue. It will come to a head somehow. I just hope that Sisko's conclusion turns out to be right."
DaystromInstitute,3cr4wj,ramon_von_peebles,3,Fri Jul 10 14:51:12 2015 UTC,"It's arguable that we are entering an era of a permanent labor surplus, due to technology eroding the demand for workers at a higher rate than the growth of new industries can compensate for. In most of the industrialized world there is a growing underclass of serially unemployed people of prime working age, often they're buried in the numbers because they don't fit the criteria for inclusion in the overall unemployment rate, but in the US for instance the overall labor participation rate (the percentage of people of working age who are employed) is at an all time low. What this all translates to is firms squeezing labor, demanding more work for less pay, because most people are desperate to maintain any sort of employment and can be easily replaced. It also means escalating social problems.   In the US there is also a growing trend of the poor, middle and upper classes becoming more and more separated geographically. The rich create semi-exclusive high tax areas, much of the middle class (especially its lower rungs) have fled to newer cheaper suburban areas in the South and West of the country, and the poor get stuck in between in inner city areas, inner/older suburbs and rural areas all with decrepit schools and public services. It's not a dramatic process consciously directed from the top down and enshrined in law, but there are many smaller measures through which state, local and federal institutions tacitly support a ""soft"" segregation of classes.   So we won't see anything quite as dramatic as forcibly imprisoning the poor and unemployed, but we are likely heading towards escalating inequality and an eventual confrontation between labor and the owners of capital."

He also called it ""a crappy episode."" (ENT Season 2 Blu-ray ""In Conversation: The First Crew"" special feature)   I think we could agree though, that, at most, this was an unintentional paralleling of B&B's experience on the show. The parallels are there, as you describe above, but the sentiment that they were trying to make the episode 'a valentine to all the Star Trek shows' is pretty universal among the cast, based on that MA article (if people thought it wasn't very effective)."

DaystromInstitute,3cov08,Anachronym,15,Thu Jul 9 19:18:51 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  Star Trek is no stranger to endings that talk about the show itself. A considered ending for DS9 was to have the end shot pull back to reveal a soundstage, with Benny Russell watching his story get made into a tv show - his ""idea"" being made ""manifest"" - his victory against a distant, controlling publisher who wanted to play it safe complete - much as DS9 was wildly different to what Star Trek 'was'. That ending didn't get used, but that it was considered is important, because TNG absolutely commented on itself as a show.  From All Good Things, the following exchanges:  Q: The trial never ended, Captain. We never reached a verdict. But now we have. You're guilty. Capt. Picard: Guilty of what? Q: Of being inferior. Seven years ago, I said we'd be watching you, and we have been - hoping that your ape-like race would demonstrate some growth, give some indication that your minds had room for expansion. But what have we seen instead? You, worrying about Commander Riker's career. Listening to Counselor Troi's pedantic psychobabble. Indulging Data in his witless exploration of humanity. Capt. Picard: We've journeyed to countless new worlds. We've contacted new species. We have expanded our understanding of the universe. Q: In your own paltry, limited way. You have no idea how far you still have to go. But instead of using the last seven years to change and to grow, you have squandered them.  Capt. Picard: We are what we are, and we're doing the best we can. It is not for you to set the standards by which we should be judged! Q: Oh, but it is, and we have. Time may be eternal, Captain, but our patience is not. It's time to put an end to your trek through the stars, make room for other more worthy species. Capt. Picard: You're going to deny us travel through space? Q: [laughs] No! You obtuse piece of flotsam! You're to be denied existence. Humanity's fate has been sealed. You will be destroyed.  Arguably Q's line about charting the unknown possibilities of existence, not studying stars and nebulae, is a line in itself about what Star Trek is really about.  This isn't a consistent trait of Trek; TOS and TAS certainly never had ""finales"" as we consider them, let alone finales that can be read as a look back at the show itself. Voyager keeps its finale very surface level, although one could have an interesting reading on Future Janeway saying screw this dumb future and rewriting history.  And on one extra side note, when a friend and I first watched the Enterprise premiere, he joked that it would be hilarious if it all turned out to be a romanticized holodeck simulation of some bored officer on the Enterprise-D. Years later I would receive a couple hours worth of confused and alarmed instant messages as the finale aired."

DaystromInstitute,3cov08,jimmysilverrims,5,Thu Jul 9 23:46:05 2015 UTC,It was horrible. Up there with all of season 1 and any plotline involving Vic Fontaine as the most eye-rolling material DS9 had to offer. Those episodes also really highlighted Avery Brooks's limited acting range and over-reliance on quirkiness and weirdness as an acting tic.   I've always maintained that DS9 had the highest highs and the lowest lows of any Star Trek series in terms of episode quality.
DaystromInstitute,3cov08,jimmysilverrims,2,Fri Jul 10 02:28:21 2015 UTC,"I actually think that the last TAS episode ""works"" as a reflective finale. The crew being reduced to children could be read as a commentary on the weirdness of the animated format, for instance. No idea if there was any intent there.  If ""All Our Yesterdays"" had been the TOS finale, I think it would have also been possible to read it as a reflective finale, whether or not that was intended. ""Turnabout Intruder,"" though -- what a mess."
DaystromInstitute,3cov08,zombie_dbaseIV,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:08:41 2015 UTC,"That actually sounds like a fun lens to apply to the TAS final episode. I think the intent was really just to reverse a scenario we'd already seen (our heroes getting old), but authorial intent accounts for only so much of a work and the interpretations that work out.  Turnabout Intruder is a nightmare for reasons even a casual viewer could recognize instantly. A lot of bad episodes of Trek get a certain kind of affection, the sort you give to three legged puppies (I love me some space hippies), but Turnabout Intruder seems almost universally despised. It's an unpleasant, ugly episode."
DaystromInstitute,3cov08,BigTaker,7,Sat Jul 11 00:35:16 2015 UTC,"We know that many of the most questionable aspects of Enterprise were dictated by the studio higher-ups, above all the Temporal Cold War, which was intended to satisfy their demand for something ""high-tech.""    I don't think the Temporal Cold War was intended as this at all, as very few TCW interventions actually showcase any technology. We know that Daniels has a host of neat gadgets, but their presentation is more like... magic artifacts.   In fact, most of the TCW refers to the future cryptically in sort of mythic terms. Future Man is essentially a quasi-Sauron, a dark shadowy silhouette giving orders.  As I understand it, the TCW was meant to give an ounce of progression. From an executive standpoint, why would anyone bother investing in a show that's purely prequelized? They're interested in the future of Star Trek, events that are uncertain and past the shows they've already watched. I'm sure the temporal cold war was a compromise to still involve future events into a series otherwise completely confined betweeen bookmarks we'd already seen."
DaystromInstitute,3cov08,uss1701jb,3,Thu Jul 9 17:09:38 2015 UTC,I've read several articles indicating that the higher-ups wanted something more futuristic and the TCW was sold as fulfilling that -- whether it did a good job or not is not relevant to the fact that it was shoehorned into the prequel concept at the studio's behest.

To my mind, they deserve props for not playing it safe.   Also, as sorry as I was to see Trip die, there's not enough of it in the Star Trek universe. Major characters are amazingly safe out there.  ""Red shirts"" dying here and there doesn't do much to put a sense of risk and drama into a show."

DaystromInstitute,3cov08,zombie_dbaseIV,4,Fri Jul 10 00:07:45 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure that Chekov died a little inside every time he was portrayed as incompetent comic relief. They really did their best to grind him into the dirt in TUC.
DaystromInstitute,3cov08,TheHYPO,9,Thu Jul 9 22:43:24 2015 UTC,"Characters should die, but Tasha Yar was the first in a line of Star Trek deaths that had very little meaning and very little emotional impact to me. Yar's death had emotion added to it far more in later episode dealing with her death like Legacy or Yesterday's Enterprise, but Skin of Evil itself gave her so little reason to die. The only purpose it served was to show that a) Armus as a douchebag and b) to add shock value. She didn't sacrifice herself, her death didn't serve to help the crew understand Armus or devise a solution... it was merely there.  Similarly, Trip's death made absolutely no sense. The threat was random and sudden, it wasn't a particularly complicated or unique threat (a few bad guys have taken the ship!). He would NEVER have killed himself in that situation in any other episode other than they needed him to die in this episode to make a point. It is extremely clear to me they said ""so let's kill Trip."" ""Okay. How?"" ""Um.... maybe some aliens come onboard?"" Rather than ""This is a really dire situation."" ""Yeah, it's almost no-win."" ""Hey, maybe it's so dire, Trip should sacrifice himself to save the ship"".  He would have found a way out of that kind of situation easily any other way. Other than it was a foregone conclusion.  In my view, there are some rules of drama. If you are going to kill off a main character, the perilous situation must have existed for more than one minute for it to have any sense of meaning. Further, if they are going to die as a show of how dire the situation is (like Yar), they have to die instantly, leading some other main characters to glare at the bad guy in realization of how dire the situation is - you can't make it look like she just barely died and they almost saved her... and the bad guy did only ""just enough"" to kill her. It puts the focus on possibly saving the character and takes all the focus off of the dire situation you are trying to establish."
DaystromInstitute,3cov08,JohnoTheFoolish,7,Thu Jul 9 20:46:25 2015 UTC,"Skin of Evil itself gave her so little reason to die.

She didn't sacrifice herself, her death didn't serve to help the crew understand Armus or devise a solution... it was merely there.   Isn't that good, though? It would be even worse for redshirts to die without any meaning but main characters to only die in some heroic Spock-esque self-sacrificing move to save the ship and crew. That would seem ridiculously artificial. I thought it was entirely appropriate for that to be able to happen, and only wish it had been a deliberate plot choice later in the series rather than something forced by an actor leaving.  It tells a better story, to me, and better reflects life if some deaths are just random and tragic and pointless. If afterwards you just feel empty and think ""Oh, was that it then?"", you feel just a shadow of what the characters must feel.  Take Jadzia Dax; she was surprised in the shrine and killed by a villain who afterwards even admitted he didn't particularly want her death. Utterly pointless. Had she gone straight to Ops or to stopped to chat with Quark or something, she would have still been alive for season 7 of DS9.  What bothers me more with the deaths of Trip and Data is that they were thrown into the last episodes of each story arc, adding drama in a very artificial way. As you put it   they needed him to die in this episode to make a point"
DaystromInstitute,3cov08,TheHYPO,2,Thu Jul 9 23:29:26 2015 UTC,"That would seem ridiculously artificial.    It's television/film. Everything is ridiculously artificial. How realistic is it that they never bring more than just Worf for security or more than just Data for science or more than just Geordi for engineering problems? How realistic is it that bad guys give a big speech before shooting the good guys instead of just walking in and killing them? How realistic is it that Voyager never runs out of energy and can basically do anything it wants (holodecks, run the doctor, food, weapons, unlimited shuttles...)  There's a difference between absolute realism and well-written drama. The suspense that makes things interesting is often very unrealistic. So yes, you're very right that there was nothing necessarily ""fake"" about way Yar or Dax died; but it was not very dramatically satisfying. The Visitor is super powerful not because Jake dies, but because of the entire buildup of the story... because of the reasons he dies... because his father is there to see it... because his father begs him not to do it... because we've just heard the story of how long he's been waiting for this moment... The moment Dathon dies in Darmok is moving because we've only just realized that he's not the enemy, but is trying to be friends with Picard, and more importantly, Picard has just realized why he's doing this... and then while Dathon is being killed, the Enterprise (with good intentions) ends up preventing Picard from helping Dathon. It's straight tragedy. Yar getting shot wasn't tragedy. It was incidental.  In my view, EVERY character getting killed should have more meaning attributed to it. In my view, the actual unrealistic part is when the redshirts die and we barely hear a word about it.  Trip's death is a bit different. I wouldn't say it's unrealistic compared to real life, but I would say it was ""unrealistic"" or ""inconsistent"" given his established character, and the show as established to that point - it was unrealistic for him to sacrifice himself given such a seemingly common threat that would have been dealt with another way in any other episode.  Maybe I should rank Data's death higher. I don't think his choice to sacrifice himself for the Captain is itself bad, I think maybe it's the bad movie (including the very gimmicky space-jump that leads up to that moment that makes it an unsatisfying death. Admittedly, he died for a dramatic and reasonable reason.  Edit: I'm not saying you're wrong that random deaths can be powerful... but as I said, if it is random, in drama, it seems to me to be important that the death be relatively instant so that the characters can instantly react and realize the bad guy means business... spending 5 minutes trying to save her puts the focus on Crusher failing to saver her and away from Armus is a big bad guy who killed her. In today's serialized dramas, there would also be much more fall-out from her death - discussions about it for several more episodes... people coping with it... people seeming to be sadder than usual... killing off a main character on a non-serialized show (where every week is basically a new completely independent story, as it pretty much was in season 1) is a lot harder to make realistic for that reason."
DaystromInstitute,3cov08,JohnoTheFoolish,3,Fri Jul 10 13:42:45 2015 UTC,"killing off a main character on a non-serialized show (where every week is basically a new completely independent story, as it pretty much was in season 1) is a lot harder to make realistic for that reason.   That's a particularly good point, yes. It worked well in DS9, I thought, where the consequences of Jadzia's death were dragged out over the first half of the final season.  Perhaps you're right in terms of dramatic rules. But I've never really thought particularly highly of storytelling conventions or of making the drama well-written. Chekhov's Gun is, to me, the single worse enemy of good drama to exist. I like when characters mention things which serve no purpose in the episode, when an idea or a character or a person is introduced and doesn't have anything to do with the resolution of the main story. To me, those are the things which make the Star Trek universe seem more like a universe and less like what it is; a collection of episodes written by different people over many years purely to make money for advertisers on American TV.   Everything is ridiculously artificial. How realistic is it that they never bring more than just Worf for security or more than just Data for science or more than just Geordi for engineering problems?

One of the reasons I like the Daystrom Institute is that it tries to explain things like this in a satisfying in-universe way. So Worf coming along for security is because that's how Starfleet security protocols work rather than because they only have so many main actors.   it was unrealistic for him to sacrifice himself given such a seemingly common threat that would have been dealt with another way in any other episode.   I think you have a point here too. It's like the destruction of the Enterprise-D in Generations. We've clearly seen, again and again, that shield frequencies can be rotated, yet that simple measure didn't happen here. That can be particularly unsatisfying. So yeah, the universe should be self-consistent as far as possible."
DaystromInstitute,3cov08,Nachteule,3,Fri Jul 10 14:22:35 2015 UTC,"I don't claim to be a writer or skilled at drama; I just tend to analyse drama quite a bit.   Chekhov's Gun is, to me, the single worse enemy of good drama to exist. I like when characters mention things which serve no purpose in the episode, when an idea or a character or a person is introduced and doesn't have anything to do with the resolution of the main story. To me, those are the things which make the Star Trek universe seem more like a universe and less like what it is; a collection of episodes written by different people over many years purely to make money for advertisers on American TV.   I absolutely agree with you, in principle. One reason why the original Star Wars (is it a faux pas to mention it here?) film is so great is because it created a whole universe and the script didn't feel the need to exposit every damn reference ""I was gonna go to Toshi Station to pick up some power converters"" - you don't have to know what either of those things is to understand the point, and it just adds to a credible universe, and the whole script is full of it - people just casually talking about things you've never heard of. But it's a fine line between what you need to explain to the audience for the story to make sense and what you don't to establish a universe.  I too find that Chekov's Gun is a poor rule to live strictly by, or else drama gets predictable (I hate when they zoom in on someone pocketing something or putting down an object because you just know they are establishing it for later... so you're waiting for it to be useful again). However, I think Chekov's Gun is a great guideline to young writers not to overcomplicate the story and cloud it with tons of dead-end material that doesn't serve the story at all.  A little bit of red-herring though often adds far more uncertainty and suspense to a story because you don't know if something is going to come back into play.   One of the reasons I like the Daystrom Institute is that it tries to explain things like this in a satisfying in-universe way.   I agree, headcanon can justify some of those issues, but that doesn't make them make more sense than beaming down with a compliment of 20 guards... not once in the history of Trek do they beam down with a compliment of 20 security officers to protect the away team... not even in the most dangerous situations. At least Enterprise had a team of Macos that sometimes got use. But again, just because I can come up with a way to explain it doesn't mean I can't come up with something more realistic they could have done   It's like the destruction of the Enterprise-D in Generations.   Another good example of a ""death"" of sorts for the sake of doing it, rather than logic in the plot. My only justification of that one is that at least it's the first time we've seen someone use spy-tactics to learn the shield frequencies  and maybe that was enough of an advantage that it took the Enterprise too long to react to (because they were confused how the BOP could shoot through their shields) that no previous villain had ever had. There's also some sense of symmetry there that both the 1701 and 1701D were blown up as part of a battle against a single BOP (orbiting a planet no less). I wonder if that was intentional."
DaystromInstitute,3cov08,MileyCylon,3,Fri Jul 10 15:29:51 2015 UTC,I can't argue with that. Trip's threat didn't seem any more dire than what they readily dealt with on a regular basis.
DaystromInstitute,3cov08,Nachteule,5,Thu Jul 9 21:42:14 2015 UTC,"Of the ""main cast"" deaths - at least permanent ones, there really isn't a great example on TV. (Jadzia) Dax is perhaps the most poignant of the three.  The films include a few more (Kirk, Data - Spock for the one film). Spock's death, of all of them, certainly stands as the most memorable and poigniant and without having experienced the the actual gap between the release of Trek II and III, the fact that he came back right in the next film was a bit undermining... but the moment in Trek II was certainly the best-used/written death... followed by Kirk and then Data, to me.  Secondary deaths were used better in my book. Actually, Voyager had some decent uses of them. Durst was one of the most effective ones to me, as were  Hogan and Carey. At least in that sense, Voyager managed to make use of killing off a number of recurring regular crew. They also used a few others (Seska, Jonas) as unexpected traitors."
DaystromInstitute,3cov08,Mirror_Sybok,2,Thu Jul 9 21:59:44 2015 UTC,"IIRC, WoK was written during one of Mr. Nimoy's anti-Spock phases. He had no intention at the time of ever coming back to the character, so the death was intended to be permanent."
DaystromInstitute,3cov08,jimmysilverrims,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:13:12 2015 UTC,I believe you are correct; but the fact remains that they didn't even wait one more movie to really let it sink in that Spock was dead.
DaystromInstitute,3cov08,Mirror_Sybok,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:50:16 2015 UTC,"WoK was also expected to be the last film, especially after TMP's poor box office performance. Instead, it revitalized the franchise, and Nimoy's interest in his role as Spock."

DaystromInstitute,3cov08,disposable_pants,12,Thu Jul 9 23:37:52 2015 UTC,"I don't like Game of Thrones. People congratulate the show on its alleged willingness to defy tropes by having frequent deaths among characters that seem like they might be main characters but that's just another trope. It is not original in the same way that an angsty teen doing the opposite of what their parents ask them to do is not establishing real independence. This is just attention whoring through violence porn.    Martin came right out after Breaking Bad saying that he was going to write a character even darker than Walter White. That's not something that I expect from a storyteller, to just come out and say that you're going to write someone shitty just to outdo some other work. That feels cheap as hell and artistically dishonest. Why would you even tell people that unless you're just attention whoring?   Real stories aren't ""mature"" just because you can shit out a high body count, torture and shock deaths. I don't watch Star Trek to be sitting around biting my nails thinking ""Who will they off this week? Will Dukat be force fed the heart of his own child? Will Crusher be able to grow new breasts for Troi after we watched a mutated Ferengi chew hers off in a cargo Bay?"" Why does Trek need frequent shock deaths? The illusion of maturity? If you think that there would be a GoT TV show if Martin had not included elements in his work that HBO could spin into violence porn or if he wouldn't let them sprinkle it in anyway you're mistaken. The great storyteller Gaiman's work will not be going to HBO and it's not hard to imagine why."
DaystromInstitute,3cov08,Algernon_Asimov,4,Fri Jul 10 00:11:16 2015 UTC,"It's funny you mention Breaking Bad, because Jesse was originally intended to be offed in Season One.   But Aaron Paul made such an impression and had such a great dynamic with Cranston that they decided to keep his character and let him grow into the other half of the entire show.   Another of my all-time favorite shows, LOST, was intended to introduce a famously-cast protagonist (played by Michael Keaton) and then kill him off in the pilot for shock value. They chose otherwise, and it's remembered today as one of the greatest pilots of television history.  But LOST has its fair share of character deaths too, some of them clearly intended to be shocking, and it made the show all the richer. There's a benefit to actually killing off members of your cast, but there are downfalls to doing it solely for shock value. I agree when you say that it's artistically disingenuine to do that.  I think that there's a balance. A way to have death lurk around every corner and yet have it not cheapen or feel fake.   I'd actually argue that there's a logical next step for Star Trek to embrace character deaths. It's been a running gag for ages that the show would often off redshirts to illustrate the danger of the strange galactic wilderness they'd explore. Doing that to real characters instead of expandable faceless security guards seems like the logical next step.  I guess my point is that I agree that there's a danger to doing this. It's easy to get wrong and appear like you're doing it for the ""illusion of maturity"". However, when it's done right it's extremely effective in making the danger the crew faces feel real. It's a difficult dance to take."
DaystromInstitute,3cov08,disposable_pants,6,Fri Jul 10 00:21:10 2015 UTC,"Ironically, while Star Trek is known for killing off anonymous redshirts and keeping its stars' hides intact... when it does kill off a main character, it doesn't do it well. As /u/TheHYPO points out elsewhere in this thread, most Star Trek main characters' threats don't actually mean anything. They certainly don't add to any sense of danger.   Most main characters died in totally pointless ways:   Tasha Yar died for no purpose except to remove Denise Crosby from the show. The death itself didn't do anything to increase the threat from Armus, who was merely another monster-of-the-week. Jadzia Dax's death was also pointless. She didn't stop Dukat from achieving what he wanted, or protect anyone else. She just died because Terry Farrell wanted to go do 'Becker'. James Kirk's death occurred after the main action of 'Generations'. His dying didn't really affect the outcome of that movie in any way.  Trip's death is totally a throwaway - especially because it comes in a holodeck, at the end of the series. No consequences or meaning whatsoever.    The only death of a main character that had any impact at all was Spock's death: he sacrificed his life to save the crew of the Enterprise.   I think what Star Trek needs is not a higher body count among main characters - we've seen that they do kill off main characters occasionally. What Trek needs is for those deaths to matter. They have to be relevant to the plot, or affect the other characters.   For example, Terry Farrell has pointed out that it would have been better to kill Jadzia in 'Change of Heart'. She even asked for this to happen, at the time. Imagine if Worf had chosen duty over love and completed his mission - only to find that Jadzia died because he left her behind. Or, even worse, what if he abandoned the mission to save Jadzia - but she died in his arms while he was trying to rescue her. This is drama that counts! Not just having a possessed Dukat negligently throw her aside without noticing her.   Star Trek doesn't need to kill more characters, it just needs to kill them better."
DaystromInstitute,3cov08,TheHYPO,3,Fri Jul 10 04:01:09 2015 UTC,"I think we're both in agreement.  Part of what I tried to make clear in my comment is that, whatever happens next in Trek, deaths need to be more than just perfunctory.  Out of all of those you've listed, only Yar's death benefits from the sudden senselessness.   The eulogy that happens afterwards and in general how all characters are effected by the death—particularly when that death is so unexpected and so senseless—is an excellent example of why having a death with a character people love and care about makes for some really great storytelling.  But it's about there being a sense of depth. Tripp dies, and yet Archer's making a speech and smiling by the end of the episode. Kirk dies, and Picard just makes a pile of rocks, stares into the sunset, then goes on his merry way.   I feel like you should try getting into a show like LOST where sudden character deaths actually happen. It can really be a benefit to the show, creating a very different sort of atmosphere than Trek.  I mean, Trek tries to impress the danger of the unknown and the importance behind difficult change, but it rarely makes danger feel real and present, or that major changes will ever truly happen. Character death gives the show a sense of instability and danger that Trek might actually need."
DaystromInstitute,3cov08,Nachteule,3,Fri Jul 10 04:08:23 2015 UTC,"I think we're both in agreement.   I didn't mean to imply we weren't! Unfortunately, on reddit, if someone takes the time to write a reply to someone's comment, it's usually to disagree, so we start to associate ""reply"" with ""dispute"". :(  I agree that deaths should matter: both at the time they occur and afterwards. Deaths should come with consequences and should drive changes in plots and characters. Absolutely."
DaystromInstitute,3cov08,neoteotihuacan,3,Fri Jul 10 04:17:07 2015 UTC,Terry Farrell has pointed out that it would have been better to kill Jadzia in 'Change of Heart'.   I never knew that. That would have been significantly more meaningful indeed.
DaystromInstitute,3cov08,tunnel-snakes-rule,2,Fri Jul 10 13:55:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Trek could stand to kill more main characters, too.  Let's say the four deaths you mentioned plus Data's death in Nemesis make five total, permanent deaths (we could count Spock, but we're already counting Dax, who kind of came back after a half dozen or so episodes, so I'd call that a wash).  The prime timeline spanned 40 real-time years, 723 episodes, and 10 films -- that's one ""real"" death every ~110 hours of screen time.  There just aren't any real stakes for the vast, vast majority of Star Trek's stories.  Every time there's a ""two characters get in a shuttle crash on a dangerous planet"" episode you know they're going to be alright.  That's a huge problem."
DaystromInstitute,3cov08,redwall_hp,3,Fri Jul 10 08:49:17 2015 UTC,"But there's no point in killing off main characters just to increase the perception of danger. We mock the killing of redshirts because it happened so often it lost all meaning; the same would be true if they killed off main characters that way. ""Lt Yellowshirt just got killed by the threat of the week? Oh well, I'm sure we'll get another Security Officer next week. After all, she was the fourth Security Officer to get killed in three seasons: starting with Yar, then Worf, then... umm... Lieutenant what's-his-name.""   The only way these deaths will pack a punch is if the characters matter, and if their deaths matter. Otherwise, to borrow someone else's phrase from elsewhere in this thread, it's just violence porn."
DaystromInstitute,3cov08,ademnus,2,Fri Jul 10 09:12:38 2015 UTC,"But there's no point in killing off main characters just to increase the perception of danger.   That's exactly the point -- without the perception of danger there's only limited room for drama.  I'm watching VOY with half an eye right now.  There are some cool ideas and good moments between characters, but I'm rarely pulled into the show because I know that I could fall asleep, miss a few episodes, and the whole bridge crew would still be there when I wake up.  Even on DS9 -- the most serialized Trek show -- the otherwise compelling Dominion War narrative was compromised because I knew the characters I cared about were protected with invincible plot armor.     We mock the killing of redshirts because it happened so often it lost all meaning; the same would be true if they killed off main characters that way.   Killing off main characters doesn't mean killing them off in a meaningless ""redshirt"" way.  Heck, they don't even have to be killed -- maybe court martialed, or transferred, or otherwise separated from the main crew.  The idea is to make their choices actually have consequences.  Plenty of popular, highly-rated shows do this now, and have found a way to do it without resorting to ""redshirt"" deaths.    As an added benefit, think of how much flexibility this would offer the creative team.  Have a character that drags the show and never lived up to its imagined potential?  He can be removed.  Have a minor character that's deserving of more screen time?  You've already planned to drop some characters and add others, so their development can be handled smoothly.  Heck, the need to have minor characters routinely step up would probably encourage the writers to develop a deeper bench, which would almost certainly improve the show."
DaystromInstitute,3cov08,tawndy,2,Fri Jul 10 10:13:39 2015 UTC,"The death itself didn't do anything to increase the threat from Armus, who was merely another monster-of-the-week.   I did make the former comment, but the latter is also relevant. Her death, even if it was the way it was, could have been more poignant had it come at the hands of a long-term enemy like the borg or Duras or Q...   James Kirk's death occurred after the main action of 'Generations'. His dying didn't really affect the outcome of that movie in any way.    But at very least, he died because he took a risk to get the remote from a dangerous place and basically he died to stop Soren... I think that's fair to say.... He also fought through his injuries to make hitting the remote his final deed. He ALSO was able to impact some wisdom to Picard in his dying words... all decent elements of a tv/film death."
DaystromInstitute,3cov08,tawndy,6,Fri Jul 10 13:51:46 2015 UTC,"I never mentioned shock death or gore or needless violence. I just wanted more realism or better say plausible plots. When there is a mission on a planet in Star Trek and the crew is Worf, the captain and one guy you never saw and one person that gets introduced in one meeting in the opening of that show... guess who will die and guess who will be injured. When the Borg beam on the bridge of the Enterprise, who gets killed with the first shot? A guy you never saw before just standing there for the first time.   That's boring because it's so predictable. At that point all ""action"" or conflict is pretty much filler since you know that the main actors will never be harmed in a significant way. That's just cowardly writing.   That's why the ""Skin of Evil"" episode was so great and groundbreaking for Trek. Tasha Yar was a not very elaborated character - her violent past was a topic from time to time but it never made a real impact. Her sudden death made her so interesting, that they found ways to bring her back in different ways (flashbacks, story of her sister and Sela).

He sends them to the Mass Effect universe, where q, posing as the Catalyst, has been causing mayhem for eons. Q created the races of the current cycle to motivate Picard to team up with Shepard to stop q and the Reapers. While it would generally be serious, comedic moments would be inevitable.   ""I need you, Jean-Luc. You have to set right what once went wrong. q created a universe for himself, but his actions doomed that universe's Humanity. And without them, it would be awfully... boring.""  ""We are not your lackeys, Q! You have to solve your own problems.""  ""Too bad Jean-Luc. Without you, 100 billion sentients will die and you will never return home."" Q disappears.   ""Captain, we appear to have been flung through some kind of wormhole. All systems functioning.""  ""Scan the area.""  Data immeadiately jumped to action. ""We're in the Oort cloud of a Sol-like star, sir. There is one M-class planet here; Vulcanoid subtype. In its orbit are hundreds of vessels.""  ""Sir, we're picking up four extremely large ships, approximately 1.2km in size. 10 light minutes away."" Worf exclaimed.  ""On screen.""  The main viewscreen showed the four vessels, in close formation.  ""They appear to be modelled after some kind of Cephalopod, sir."" Data reported.  Picard immeadiately had flashbacks when he saw the blue light shining from cracks in the hull. ""They look a bit like Borg.""  ""Indeed sir. Scans confirm that they have a significant amount of biomass aboard. One single life sign per ship.""  ""Captain, they're breaking formation and coming after us."" Riker reported.  ""What is their speed?""  ""16c, but I cannot detect any warp signature. It appears they are using some kind of static Higgs-boson field to induce an effect similiar to a quantum slipstream.""  ""Hail them.""  ""Yes, sir."" Data began a connection. ""Universal Translator link is established.""  ""I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard, of the USS Enterpr..."" he found himself interrupted.  ""You cannot resist. Face your annihilation. We are your evolution. Evolution is unstoppable. We are unstoppable.""  ""Mr. Worf, raise shields. Go to Red Alert.""  The four ships jumped out of the slipstream in front of the Enterprise. Several blue flashes were visible on the ships, but the Enterprise registered no impacts.  ""What's going on?"" Riker asked. ""Why aren't they attacking.""  ""It appears they are, Sir."" Data answered. ""They are using some kind of Mass-accelerator technology which is entirely inadequate against even our static navigational fields. They appear to be using only navigational shielding.""  ""Stand by, for the moment.""  ""I'm registering an energy discharge."" Data exclaimed. The Enterprise was shaken as the IDF-caught up. ""It appears they have fired some sort of plasma beam at relativistic velocities. Our shields could take the impact, but not as easily.""  ""Return fire.""  Worf punched in the firing orders and watched. One phaser beam was enough to rip through one of the ships entirely, owing to their total lack of shields. Spectacularly, it exploded. One Quantum torpedo each was what was needed to neutralise the other ones.  In a moment of silence, Picard got up from the Captain's chair. ""What is our location.""  ""According to quasar triangulation, we are in the Delta quadrant.""  ""Enter orbit around the M-class planet.""  ""Sir, another ship is approaching. Significantly smaller, unshielded but with 80 life signs aboard. It is similiar to no known configuration. Their thermal signature is very small, but they appear to have some sort of Higgs-Boson emitter as well.""  ""Magnify.""  Picard read out the name: ""SSV Normandy SR-2?""  ""It appears to be so, Captain."" Data unhelpfully agreed. ""This is, in fact, English.""  ""Hail them""  ""Sir, they don't appear to have subspace comms, but they're closing in for STL fast. They'll be in range in two minutes.""  On the Normandy  ""Shepard! You remember the four Reaper capital ships that were out here?"" Joker called out.  ""Yeah, what's with them?"" Jane Shepard asked.  ""They're... destroyed, after some kind of giant energy discharge.""  ""The Geth?""  ""No, this is three orders of magnitute above anything we've encountered."" Samantha Traynor stepped up from behind with the sensor logs on a PADD in her hand.  ""The ship that attacked them, it appears to be rather long and flat. No Mass Effect fields around them.""  ""Our enemy's enemy is our friend."" Shepard quipped. ""Joker, bring us into range.""  As the Normandy left the ME-corridor 20km from the unknown ship, the jaw of everyone who was watching a viewscreen to the outside dropped.  ""Is that the bloody Enterprise?"" Traynor asked. Joker had never heard her raise her voice, nor swear. He would have said something, if he wasn't too surprised to speak any coherent sentence.

DaystromInstitute,3crfz7,CTMGame,9,Fri Jul 10 08:49:38 2015 UTC,"Star Trek / Star Wars  The year is 2378, Captain Janeway, with the help her of future self, detonate several torpedoes inside a Borg transwarp conduit. The results are a cascade effect branching out across the entire trans-warp network.  30,000 Light Years away, Borg Cube C935-66378 is entering a trans-warp hub in the Beta Quadrant after having successfully assimilated 3 planets belonging to species 11628. As the ship enters the conduit, the conduit begins to collapse. Their only course of action is to attempt to out pace the explosion. As the network falls the conduits themselves destabilize and begin to spiral outwards in subspace. When the conduit finally collapses the Borg Cube reappears in normal space intact but with heavy damage. The Borg attempt to reconnect to the hive mind but find they are unable to do so.  Further analysis shows they are unable to detect any signs of the hive mind or remains of the Trans-Warp network. As they continue to analyze their sensor data they find they have somehow appeared in a distant galaxy designated G-66128, which resides roughly 52 million light years away from their point of origin. Calculations on cosmic background radiation also indicate a temporal event has occurred and that they have traveled roughly 22,000 years into the past.  Repairs to the Cube begin immediately. Because the Borg are no longer able to contact the hive mind and the hive mind as it was known currently no longer exists, the drones initiate directive 001 and a new temporary hive mind is established. Calculated time to return to Borg space is 7,428 years at maximum velocity.  Before the next course of action could be decided the Cube detects an incoming vessel. Estimated size is roughly 1600 meters, estimated crew compliment of 37,000 beings, constructed of an unknown form of durasteel composite. High level energy output detected. Method of propulsion unknown, configuration of vessel unknown, energy signature unknown. Energy build up indicates a charging weapons system. Protocols target vessel for immediate assimilation.  The Borg open hailing frequencies...  ""We are the Borg. Lower your shields and surrender your vessel. We will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile""  The Cube receives an almost immediately reply.  ""Alien vessel, this is Captain Kor-al of the Imperial Star Destroyer Hades. You have entered restricted Imperial Space. Power down your ship immediately or we will open fire.""  The stalemate lasts a mere seconds. The Borg Cube locks a tractor beam on the unknown vessel. Small chemical warheads are launched and impact the Borg Cube causing moderate damage. Shields are modulated to adjust for the energy signature of the weapons. A hail of energy beams are launched next, the signature is unknown. It will take several minutes to adapt. Small craft are detected launching from the underside of the unknown vessel. Single life signs are detected in each. As they get closer they too fire weapons, but energy output is negligible. The ships possess no protective shielding and are immediately transported aboard for assimilation. Assimilated knowledge helps the Borg further adapt their shields to resist all incoming weapons fire.  The battle lasts only 20 minutes. As the Borg adapt to the weapons fire from the unknown ship, the balance shifts and soon the Borg begin immediate assimilation. Drones are transported aboard the target vessel. Borg losses are minimal, target utilizes a limited spectrum of energy weapons, easy to adapt. Individuals equipped with non adaptive armor plating, limited resistance coefficient. Target losses limited to less than 1,000 beings, leaving 36,000 remaining targets for assimilation.  As the crew enter the hive mind, their knowledge is spread among the new collective:  Imperial Star Destroyer, part of a Galactic Empire comprised of thousands of Star Systems, it's Capital System designated Coruscant. Method of Space Travel known as Hyperspace. capable of speeds far greater than Transwarp. 180 billion planetary systems cataloged. Over 20 million sentient species defined in the galaxy.  Additional technologies defined in the database include an unknown weapon designated 'Death Star"" capable of 2.24 × 1032 Joules of energy output, effects able to destroy an entire planet. High priority for assimilation. Limited entries on a historical collective known as the Jedi, which possess abnormal telekinetic powers. Highlighted for future study, high priority for assimilation.  New objective defined in collective. Remain in Galaxy G-66128 and begin rapid assimilation. Estimated time to completion, 600 years."

Despite their diminutive stature, low-to-mediocre intelligence, and a strange genetic quirk that causes a significant number of them to be born with only one eye, they are also seemingly impervious to injury which the Borg see as a potential asset and thus seek to assimilate them.  Unusually, this species does not resist assimilation at all and in fact eagerly offers their assistance, even embracing Borgification.  What the Borg failed to account for is that while they are virtually impervious to injury, they are even more impervious to competence.  Wacky hijinks ensue.

DaystromInstitute,3crfz7,radwolf76,2,Fri Jul 10 06:44:24 2015 UTC,"2026: At the start of WW3, after Col. Phillip Green and his Eco-terrorists kill 37 million lives, various Earth governments decide to bolster their militaries with new weapons called ""mobile suits."" Able to be more multirole than any other weapons platform before it, and with designs such as the CGUE and ZAKU they also had an unorthodox side effect of being a weapon of fear as well.   2028: The first attempt at the United Earth Sphere occurs. Its core members are mostly first world western countries, with several third world countries as provisional members. The preexisting ESA is rebranded into the Earth Space Agency and attracts some of the greatest minds of Earth at the time, including people such as the defector from the Eastern Coalition Trenov Y. Minovsky and the father of yet-to-be-born Zefram Cochrane. One research laboratory of note is the CERN labs, where alternative energy source research occurs.  2030: Up until this point mobile suits used ultraefficient battery arrays. Though powerful, it requires a massive amount of support and logistics to keep equipment running.  This year the Minovsky Ultracompact Fusion Reactor, major concepts of which would later be redeveloped by Zefram Cochrane into the warp core, enters production. A standalone fusion reactor, this nearly eliminates the requirement for supply lines for mobile suits thus making them not only autonomous units, but also paves the way for energy based weapons in the upcoming years.  2036:  The United Earth Sphere fractures. Mobile suit factories all over the world are pushed to the limit as they push out new units such as the Flag, Hellion, Tieren, and Enact for their factions of origin. The son of the late Phillip Greene, who's terrorist attack a decade earlier is now considered the sparking incident for the current conflicts, intentionally damages the MUFR of an early mobile suit just outside of CERN. Though not caught in the blast directly, the CERN labs, all personnel, and all research are lost in the blastwave and the area is covered in a previously unknown type of fallout preventing recovery and cleanup. Dr. Minovsky and the father of Zefram Cochran are lost as well, though not Zefram Cochran himself as he and his mother had been sent to Montana a few years before as his father's insistence. This tactic slowly becomes more popular as the war wages on.  2045: A quartet of mobile suits appear and start skirmishes with the various power blocks, overwhelming them in nearly every battle. These suits come to be known as Gundams, as that is the only identifying marking on all four of them, and their appearance becomes synonymous with death and destruction. The four Gundams begin an anti-military campaign for the next 7 years while the various power blocks still fight amongst themselves.  2052: The combination of the Gundams and the world fighting has rendered much of the world barren. Fallout runs throughout due to mobile suit kamikaze tactics and industry is limited to the few remaining megacities left in the world. The remaining powers rest in an uneasy alliance to protect themselves from the Gundams, and pool their remaining military into three groups for deployment.  During the final week of this year, all four Gundams attack the largest of the three military bases, completely annihilating it before the remaining world's military organizes and arrives. The Gundams hold the base and fight off the assault. In the end Earth's military is crippled, and three of the Gundams are lost. The remaining Gundam then appears outside of the former United Earth Capital, and as it stands there it broadcasts a message from a person claiming to be the Gundams' creator. He delivers a message of broken hope, that in the face of an overwhelming enemy humanity could have come together instead of continuing to fight itself. In this worst case scenario he gives humanity its hatred and anger personified; the Gundam. He prays that having humanity seen its worst, it can now look to its best. The final Gundam then self destructs.  2053: Representatives of the remaining Governments meet in San Francisco and agree to a cease fire and recovery efforts begin. Like the Eugenics Wars before it, WW3 instills a fear of human-form weapons that persists centuries into the future."

They appear over an earth-like planet with only a handful of human lifesigns. They beam down to find Rick, Will, and Holly Marshall just as a pack of Sleestacks are about to attack. After rescuing them from the attack Spock discovers that this is, in-fact, not Earth, but the Gorn homeworld in the ancient past (turns out that Rick, Will, and Holly were also sucked through a space-time wormhole of sorts).   Turns out a Klingon ship had followed the Enterprise through the wormhole and monitored the situation. They find a way to communicate with and work with the Sleestacks (who they learn are a genetic precursor to the Gorn). They ultimately ambush Kirk, Spock, McCoy, a red shirt that has (so far) only been called Jack, and Ranger Rick, killing Ranger Rick before they could fully rebuff the attack. Ultimately the Klingons retreat through the wormhole just before it closes.   The Enterprise is still stuck here. The kids had been fond of Redshirt Jack before so he invents a story of being their ""Uncle"" who was searching for them. Telling them their Dad made it home. He tells Kirk to leave him behind and to report him as KIA.  Kirk does so reluctantly and they leave the kids with ""Uncle"" Jack in the only home they've really loved. Spock figures out the time travel computations necessary and they perform the proper slingshot maneuver to get back home to their own time.  Side note: This would only be slightly less ridiculous than ""Nazi Planet Episode"" :P  Edit: I love this thread's ""propose an unorthodox cross-over"" concept and think it's ripe for some interesting discussion.

What ties DS9 back to the Roddenberry Ideal is that what convinces the Founders to end the war is not any external attack, but rather the actions of Sisko and his crew who demonstrated through their actions and interactions with Odo a willingness (and capability) to overcome their innate weaknesses (the same things the Founders fear) and become something better.

He claims that four is more than enough, as the Changelings don't fear their enemies as much as they are feared... it is this fear that will eventually destroy Starfleet. Promising that the Changelings have barely begun with their plans for Earth and the rest of the Alpha Quadrant, O'Brien's doppelgänger leaves.   The changelings were doing their best to destroy the Federation, and they were eventually beaten. When Odo returned home, i would like to think it was a time of acceptance, that their dedicated efforts to wage war was truly their undoing, not the specific weapon used against them. Had they not started the war to begin with they would not have brought that doom upon themselves. It was a hard lesson that they were not invincible and that if they kept going around trying to conquer people, they would eventually face an enemy that could and would destroy them.

The fact that none of the Klingon boarding party could understand Federation Standard was not any of Kirk's responsibility. Historically, surrendering warship crews still could scuttle their ship or at least destroy sensitive materials without violating international naval protocols. A surrender mostly ensures that a crew survives, not that the enemy gains control of your ship. The Federation and the Klingon Empire were not at war - in fact, recall that an Ambassador from the Empire was on Earth specifically to negotiate a new peace treaty. Further, Kruge's actions were not sanctioned by the Klingon Empire, and Kirk was wanted by Starfleet for a number of charges stemming from his theft of Enterprise from Spacedock and the actions leading up to it.

The fact that none of the Klingon boarding party could understand Federation Standard was not any of Kirk's responsibility.   Kirk also said 'no tricks'. Would you feel the same way if a Taliban group 'surrendered' to some American soldiers, luring them into a booby-trapped vehicle? Surely it's not their fault the Americans couldn't understand Pashto.   Historically, surrendering warship crews still could scuttle their ship or at least destroy sensitive materials without violating international naval protocols. A surrender mostly ensures that a crew survives, not that the enemy gains control of your ship.   Agreed. I have more of a problem with the murder of Kruge's crew. In fact, Kirk asks what the standard complement of a BoP is - it seems clear that his plan is to lure as many of them as he can onto the Enterprise, murder them, and then the humans will outnumber the Klingons.   The Federation and the Klingon Empire were not at war - in fact, recall that an Ambassador from the Empire was on Earth specifically to negotiate a new peace treaty. Further, Kruge's actions were not sanctioned by the Klingon Empire, and Kirk was wanted by Starfleet for a number of charges stemming from his theft of Enterprise from Spacedock and the actions leading up to it. I question if any actions taken by either commander under those circumstances could be appropriately called ""war crimes.""   Fair, but we do tend to call people war criminals even in the absence of a formal declaration of war. It was combat between rogue elements of each military."
DaystromInstitute,3cpwa9,zuludown888,8,Thu Jul 9 21:23:15 2015 UTC,"Actually, perfidy (used interchangeably with treachery in internation law; this covers false surrenders) did happen to American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and through American history famous examples can be found in figures like Nathan Bedford Forrest. Other fictional examples include John McClane in Die Hard, James Bond more times than I care to count, and The Avengers, which just means that real life doesn't have the benefit of being nearly as morally clear as a work of fiction which provides distinct heroes and villains which provide justification for such acts."

(3) Kruge had already abrogated any claim to be under the protection of the laws of war when he started murdering prisoners in cold blood. Are we really to expect Kirk to willingly surrender his ship and crew to a man who has already demonstrated a willingness to execute his prisoners? Even for the Federation, that would seem remarkably naive.  Finally, you also have to consider that reprisal for violations of international law has been seen as, at the very least, semi-legitimate for centuries. We might even see this in Star Trek in ""A Private Little War,"" in which the Federation arms a primitive culture in response to the Klingons doing the same to one of its rivals. In that context, Kirk conducted a very limited reprisal against Kruge (a war criminal, who may not have been officially under the protection of the Klingon Empire at the time anyways) for his earlier crime of murdering David Marcus. That Kirk conducted this reprisal against an entirely legitimate military target (military personnel engaged in an illegal invasion of Federation space and illegal acts against Federation citizens) makes it difficult to argue against this.

DaystromInstitute,3cpwa9,NodbuggerX,7,Thu Jul 9 21:16:45 2015 UTC,"Fake surrendering is a form of perfidy which is the general act of luring an enemy into a state of false confidence (with respect to international law) and then abusing that confidence to kill or injure them.  False surrender falls under this because captives are supposed to be outside the conflict, protected from summary execution and torture until they are released upon the cessation of the conflict. Since they are not to be harmed, they are not allowed to harm others. Permitting false surrenders would just encourage no quarter or mercy, which no on wants.  Is what Kirk did false surrender under this context? I'd say no. As stated, prisoners of war are ""outside the conflict"" and not to be harmed, and the rule against this type of perfidy is to help ensure the protection of said prisoners. Kruge had already executed a prisoner and threatened to execute more (not to mention was acting in violation of a standing treaty in a time of peace); From Kirk's POV there was no expectation of protection had he surrendered, especially since he did not have the knowledge Kruge was seeking.  Given that - traditionally - soldiers engaging in perfidy were usually granted no quarter, it seems only sensible that soldiers granting no quarter should expect a bit of perfidy in turn. Also relevant is the fact that both Kirk and Kruge were acting as rogue agents, rather than State Actors. For all intents and purposes, they were two private individuals engaged in a conflict (both most certainly violating the laws of their respective nations).  With no state of war between either the Federation or Klingon, both Kirk and Kruge acting independently, and Kruge summarily executing prisoners, it is unlikely that Kirk's action was a war crime. It is also especially telling that, given everything the Klingons were trying to pin on Kirk (from Justin Beiber's career to the Kennedy Assassination), war crimes of this nature (perfidy) weren't on the list."

The line was changed in the final product, but the intent is clear.

Now if they carried a bunch of photon torpedoes, that might be worrisome, since those tiny torpedoes pack a big punch.  There's no reason to think that the Enterprise is flat out immune to lasers.

I'd also like to point out that in that particular TNG episode (The Outrageous Okana), the quote wasn't about the Deflector. It was about Navigational Shields. Who said those were energy based?

DaystromInstitute,3clgbd,phrodo913,40,Wed Jul 8 20:47:35 2015 UTC,"Quoting the TNG Technical Manual:   The general planform of the Galaxyclass starship returns to a more natural existence in that people are free to move about on planar surfaces with a constant gravity holding them to the deck. Aboard the starship, this is accomplished through the use of a network of small gravity generators. The network is divided into four regions, two within the Saucer Module and two within the Battle Section. All four work to maintain the proper sense of ""down,"" and are also actively tied to the inertial damping field system to minimize motion shock during flight. The two Saucer Module gravity networks each support 400 generators; those in the Battle Section each support 200. Fields overlap slightly between devices, but this is barely noticeable.  ...  This decay time necessitates the addition of the second layer of generators beyond 30 meters distance. The field is gentle enough to allow natural walking without a gravity gradient from head to foot, long a problem in brute-force physical centripetal systems  ...  Gravity generators are located throughout the habitable volume of the spacecraft. Because of this, inertial potential can vary from one location within the ship to another, espe- cially during severe turning maneuvers. In order to allow translation of excess inertial potential from one part of the ship to another, the gravity generators are connected together by a network of small waveguide conduits that allow field bleed for gravitational stability.   So the simple answer: the created artificial gravity fields are quite big, they expand into the turboshaft.  I can remember reading about their exact size, but can't for the life of me find it right now, it's neither in the TNG, nor DS( or Starfleet Technical Manual...wonder where I had seen that."

We also see that even under normal conditions, not all areas of the ship experience a full 1g. Ships that have lost power or are 'off' for various reasons usually still have active grav plating. This implies that there may be non-trivial engineering and safety issues associated with grav plating.   Possibly grav plating emits particles over an angle, not just straight up, such that a narrow shaft like a turbolift or ladder shaft experiences acceleration from the grav plating on the nearby decks, but the field is not very uniform. This might make movement in the shafts erratic, or travel in the shaft uncomfortable for passengers.  I'd suppose that the utility of having a gravity field other than 1g is normally not enough to deal with the safety and engineering issues associated with it, so we don't see it except in a few special cases."

To expand that to mass transport is really just a matter of doing the work. But Elevators allow us those moments of introspection, and the odd encounter with someone new. This is a necessary social function for a human crew.   TLDR: Really it's probably a bad idea to have long shafts the length of your starship if you think about it."
DaystromInstitute,3clgbd,AHPpilot,4,Thu Jul 9 03:17:56 2015 UTC,"I suspect that while gravity plating can create gravity fields in localized areas, the shipwide system may create overlapping gravity fields that extend to the turbolift shafts. It is a side effect that the turbolifts have gravity, but one necessary to maintain gravity throughout the ship.  In an emergency situation floating through empty shafts would provide useful transportation between decks, but would likely otherwise be a hindrance, so gravity is maintained whenever possible.  The bigger question is why the gravity stays on when all other power systems have failed."
DaystromInstitute,3clgbd,WhatGravitas,8,Wed Jul 8 21:49:33 2015 UTC,"The bigger question is why the gravity stays on when all other power systems have failed.   I vaguely remember from the TNG Tech Manual that the artificial gravity generators looked a bit like a big disk with a spinning element inside.  It's possible that it's working a bit like a flywheel and keeps (literally) spinning and generating a gravity field for some time, even without power."

DaystromInstitute,3cla8s,tesseract4,17,Thu Jul 9 01:22:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Section is so much interested in overlapping interests so much as it is in leverage. Bashir isn't being shopped as a voting member, he's being turned, and he's vulnerable is a fashion Sisko isn't- relative youth, vanity and shame in equal measure over his engineered status, a fascination with narratives of violence, and a chip on his shoulder about being a good man, which Sisko is too earthy to share. Sisko can recognize that his excursions outside the lines don't constitute a sensible endorsement of a whole different moral code- hence his willingness to go hunting for the Section."
DaystromInstitute,3cla8s,queenofmoons,11,Wed Jul 8 21:11:25 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this. I don't read Section 31 so much as seriously trying to recruit Bashir as they are simply using him. One of his strongest character flaws is his arrogance, which has on more than one occasion led to him not believing he could possibly fail. He sticks with Section 31's instructions on Romulus, absolutely sure he's going to outsmart them, uncover the conspiracy, and save the day, and ends up doing exactly what they need him to do because he's too caught up in his own ability, instead of thinkinh like Garak and be ruthlessly cynical and paranoid like a ""good"" spy (in Garak's opinion) ought to be, and alert people outside his immediate situation about this conspiracy."
DaystromInstitute,3cla8s,Berggeist,5,Thu Jul 9 04:28:57 2015 UTC,"S31 must know that he loves spy stories and that he would give anything to be part of one. He is no leader though. Just a useful idiot, albeit an incredibly intelligent one."

BASHIR: A few minutes ago, you were calling me a traitor and now you want to recruit me?  SLOAN: Well, you're intelligent, you're resourceful, you've always been fascinated by covert operations. Why else would you spend so much time in Quark's holosuites playing spy?  BASHIR: You're serious."
DaystromInstitute,3cla8s,Morinaka,2,Thu Jul 9 11:46:53 2015 UTC,I could totally see it happening. Just have someone walk into Quark's bar and offer to pay for the holosuite program logs. Have them say they're performing research for more engaging holosuite programs. Offer Quark a not unrespectable amount (but not so high he won't bargain a little) under the rationale that with his wide array of alien customers he presents a unique opportunity for research into holodeck experiences they can't find anywhere else.  If anything I'd be more worried about Quark catching on and interfering than Bashir.

DaystromInstitute,3cla8s,Philix,9,Wed Jul 8 21:41:33 2015 UTC,"Bashir was a man with a strong sense of personal ethics.   Sloan understood this and counted on it in ""Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges.""  The revelation of this at the end of that episode makes me wonder whether Sloan was actually interested in recruiting Bashir or if he was merely using him.  Knowing Sloan and Section 31, the plan was probably set up for them to get a desirable outcome no matter what Bashir's response would be.    As for Sisko, he shows moral flexibility when it can either avoid full-scale war or can stave off the Federation's defeat -- in almost all other situations his belief in Federation morals reigns supreme."
DaystromInstitute,3cla8s,disposable_pants,5,Wed Jul 8 22:04:27 2015 UTC,"In the real world of intelligence assets, there's not a difference. The people we think of as spies- who go to spy schools and go to spy headquarters- are managers. Bashir is being recruited as an asset- his use is implied."
DaystromInstitute,3cla8s,queenofmoons,2,Wed Jul 8 23:40:23 2015 UTC,"I suppose the question, then, is whether he was being recruited as an asset (who is unlikely to know the full situation and is pawn in Sloan's game) or a manager (who's let in on more of the details and gets a hand in directing the action).  Sloan presents his recruitment pitch as an offer to be the latter, when in reality it seems he only views Bashir as the former."
DaystromInstitute,3cla8s,disposable_pants,5,Thu Jul 9 04:33:02 2015 UTC,"I would say Sisko would have been a terrible Section 31 operative. I envision Section 31 working like a master sculptor shaping politics with a fine chisel one tiny stroke at a time. Sisko, on the other hand, seems like he'd grab a sledgehammer and bash the problem to pieces, especially when he enters intense and righteous mode.   And indeed Sisko does overreact on several occassions, just off the top of my head: Telling Bajor not to join the Federation in Rapture, the Maquis colony bombing, saving the Cardassian council from the Klingons. They may have worked out in the end, but none seemed likely to be Section 31's style of doing things. Even bringing the Romulans into the war, only worked subtlety due to Garak's involvement, without him Sisko may have caused a full blown diplomatic crisis."
DaystromInstitute,3cla8s,boringdude00,0,Wed Jul 8 23:01:22 2015 UTC,"I doubt they would let Sisko have control over any of the big decisions, but theres no reason they couldn't have used him to achieve some larger goal that the higher ups in Section 31 were plotting.  Tell him some planet is a threat, show him evidence, put him on the defiant and let him loose."
DaystromInstitute,3cla8s,Contranine,3,Wed Jul 8 23:15:36 2015 UTC,"I don't think Sisko would have been a good fit for section 31 for some of the very reasons you give.    There seems to be a deep seeded belief inside Section 31 that Bashir is a psychopath.  They seem to think that given the right motivation, and the right prodding he could do whatever it took to do anything.  They don't understand that he isn't and has found genuine friends wit the DS9 crew.  I think without his relationship to O'Brien I can see him being a lot more tempted to join, but his sense of ethics and protecting his parents would drive him to still to the right thing.   Sisko is a different matter.  Sisko will go to insane, lengths to do what he thinks is right.  The various comparisons to Javert (Les Miserable) during the Eddington arc are important.  And the insight into it comes from when he's hitting the punching bag Dax holds.  He is being outwitted by a man.  Just a person.  A lower rank officer.  Someone he views as beneath him. And for what, having Federation knowledge?  No.  Sisko does it because he believes he should catch him because in the end his pride is hurt.    I can think of several reason why Section 31 could maybe want to work with Eddington.  I can't imagine Sisko ever going along with one of those plans.  Giving that man what he wants, and letting him get away with it, even if it was for the Federation good.  Sisko would cave.    Meanwhile for bringing the Romulans into the war, he felt like he was backed into a corner.  Section 31 don't feel backed into a corner, they are looking for threats everywhere.  Remember also Sisko didn't plan to murder or hurt anyone.  He wasn't going to ask too many questions, but he wasn't going to go out of his way to hurt anyone.  At that point he isn't in control of the plan also.  He's just waiting for the next thing to happen, for the next time he can impact something, like a pitcher in baseball stepping up to the plate because it is his turn.   And remember the plan Sisko had failed.  Garek had a backup plan, lots of other plates spinning, and probably others that we didn't get to see, because he is a master spy.    In the end Sisko can do live with had happened, but he's not a chess player, he's a baseball man."
DaystromInstitute,3cla8s,sho19132,2,Thu Jul 9 15:26:39 2015 UTC,"In my headcannon, Sisko was already a member of Section 31 even before he was put in command of DS9.  I base this on a submission /u/Philix made about a year ago:   I've recently been reviewing the episodes: ""In the Pale Moonlight"", ""Inquisition"", ""Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges"", and ""Extreme Measures"". In those episodes, I've seen what I believe are hints that Captain Sisko is either: working for or a sympathizer with Section 31. Captain Sisko has motive, opportunity, contacts and, most importantly, he pushed Dr. Bashir into working with Luther Sloan at every opportunity.  I believe that in ""In the Pale Moonlight"" Captain Sisko is setting into motion a Section 31 plan to bring the Romulans into the Dominion War. Not only is he willing to commit acts that would be anathema to a Starfleet officer, but he has people at Starfleet Command covering his ass in this operation. He gets authorization to create a forgery from Starfleet command, and someone brushes those 85 liters of Bio-mimetic Gel under the table. Dr. Bashir lodges a formal protest with Starfleet Medical but, we don't hear about any fallout from that. What leads me to believe that this was a Section 31 operation is the eventual Tal Shiar investigation into the assassination. We know that Chairman Koval is working with Section 31 and making sure that the evidence all points the right way would likely be within his power.  In Inquisition, Captain Sisko tells Dr. Bashir to feign working with Sloan in the future in an attempt to gain a little more knowledge. He also echoes the same encouragement in ""Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges"". Where this leads me to think that Captain Sisko is working with Section 31 is the later revelation that Admiral Ross is an integral part in that operation. Admiral Ross and Captain Sisko work together on many occasions and Captain Sisko's trust in him doesn't seem to wane at all after the revelation that he's at the least a Section 31 sympathizer. Captain Sisko giving Dr. Bashir that little push to feign working with Sloan plays right into Sloan's hands.  The only source we have about Starfleet's attitude to being confronted about Section 31 is Captain Sisko. He's in an ideal place to keep Dr. Bashir and the senior staff of Deep Space 9 from revealing much about Section 31. The senior staff are hardly going to go above their trusted Captain's head to report Section 31, they have no reason to doubt he's being anything but straightforward. He also gives his officers a very wide latitude in dealing with Section 31, keeping as far away from their efforts to expose them as possible.  In ""Extreme Measures"" he immediately recognizes Sloan while he's unconscious on the bed. It's possible that he got a picture from DS9's or the Bellerophon's security logs, but if he had access to those images, wouldn't they be fairly quickly circulated up to Starfleet Command/Intelligence? At Starfleet's level of technology having a face to put to a high level Section 31 agent should make it fairly easy to track him down.  To sum up, Captain Sisko is dedicated to the protection and preservation of the Federation, and he is shown as willing to commit many questionable actions to achieve that. This is the raison d'etre of Section 31. Captain Sisko has worked closely with at least one possible Section 31 member/sympathizer and possibly helped in the recruitment efforts of another potential agent. He distances himself from efforts to expose Section 31 and immediately recognizes an agent, the first time they are shown in each other's presence.  Could a highly respected and infuential Starfleet Captain be an agent for Section 31? While I'll admit my theories hardly present any hard evidence. I don't see any hard evidence to rule it out either.   I expanded on his discussion with some of my own observations in this comment:   Interesting conjecture. I haven't made it to the Section 31 stuff in DS9 yet, but I have noticed some things that would fit into this theory.   At one point Captain Sisko poisons the atmosphere of an entire planet, making it uninhabitable for the humans living there, in order to force the surrender of Michael Eddington, a Star Fleet officer who had defected to the Maquis (season 5, ""For the Uniform."") He did that after he was ordered by Star Fleet to stop chasing Eddington and let another Captain take over the pursuit.  I couldn't understand how he could do an act like this and not face serious repercussions, or, as far as I could see, even be reprimanded for it. But if he were an agent of Section 31 it might explain it - perhaps his orders were to capture the renegade Eddington at any cost.   For that matter, perhaps Eddington was actually a renegade Section 31 agent; looking back, he seemed to have more skills than than your average Star Fleet officer. And if Eddington were a Section 31 agent, it might explain his decision to surrender - he did it because Captain Sisko threatened to poison all Maquis planets until Eddington turned himself in. This seemed like an empty threat to me: even though Captain Sisko did it the first time, it's impossible to believe a Star Fleet Captain would continue to do something like that. Additionally, I wouldn't see Star Fleet letting him continue this tactic, even if he wanted to. But if Eddinton knew Captain Sisco was Section 31, he would know what Captain Sisko was capable of and what he would be able to get away with.  Also in support of your theory, it seems like Captain Sisko was able to pull some strings to keep Dr. Bashir in Star Fleet when it came out that the good doctor had genetic augmentation (season 5, ""Doctor Bashir, I Presume?"").   Almost as soon as Captain Sisko found out Bashir's secret he had a jag officer work out a deal to keep Bashir in Star Fleet. He was able to get this done within a single morning and before Bashir could make it to his office to resign, even though genetic manipulation is one of the most serious crimes in the Federation and all the legal precident said Bashir would be cashiered for being modified. (I've only seen one episode past this, so I don't know if there were any further ramifications.)  Perhaps it was the genetic augmentation that lead to Captain Sisko's decision to groom Dr. Bashir for Section 31 - someone with the doctor's enhanced abilities would make an ideal agent."

DaystromInstitute,3cla8s,Sly_Lupin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:56:27 2015 UTC,"The whole thing about Section 31 is that it asks people to ""protect the Federation at all costs,"" by violating the Federation's ideals. It asks for you to sacrifice the ""soul"" of a thing to preserve a thing's existence.  So you can imagine how warped/deluded a person would have to be to accept Section 31.   And let's not forget the fact that it's a completely illegal, terrorist organization.  Sisko absolutely would not have been a likely candidate for recruitment. Of all the characters we've seen in Trek, I'd say that Bashir is probably the ONLY one who'd be even remotely likely, simply due to the fact that his genetic tampering put him at odds with the Federation. He was already an ""outsider"" who was less invested in the ""ideals"" of the Federation because those very ideals would have denied his existence. That's the kind of opening that could be exploited by a skilled recruiter.  Which Sloan... was not."

He had what could have been a very interesting backstory, but they were never able to fully capitalize on it because his acting just wasn't up to snuff.  For Generations, the most important thing is to step back and stop rushing towards a premature 1994 deadline. Releasing the movie in 1995 would be just fine. With that extra time, pick one uniform design and stick with it, turn on the bloody lights, and try to come up with a script that doesn't require a staggering display of incompetence from the best crew in the fleet in order to get where they should be going."

Suppose you remove Shatner as director of The Final Frontier? Instead do what Paramount wanted and made another comedy? Star Trek would just produce comedies until the humor died and the series followed afterwards.  Generations might have done a lot better without being tied to Kirk, instead allowed to do their own thing with a better director. Ignore the whole Nexus thing and focus on a madman helping the Duras sisters with the Romulans being a major player.   Insurrection could have a complete rewrite and do without the space elves.  And Nemesis should have been completely rewritten with a better director, like La Var Burton instead of the jackass they had.

I don't know if it's still around but I'll try to find it and give my answers from that post.     Okay - I couldn't find it. I'll think up some new ideas.   I love Starfleet uniforms, but I can think of many ways to improve them aside from pockets. I would use rank pips in TOS - they are much more convenient on screen than Navy bands. Name tags were in ""These are the Voyages..."" , but they should have been around from the start. And pockets - pockets would be nice. Use the Monster Maroon uniforms in TMP. Skip strait to the later uniforms in TNG. Keep uniforms consistent in DS9. They still use the TNG uniforms far too late into the series and they never say why some people use the First Contact uniform and some still use the TNG one. Make the Enterprise-D's halls bigger and add more people. It's supposed to be a flying city. Civilian clothes look dumb - even for the 90s. Change ""Skin of Evil"" to kill off Tasha better. Erase ""Threshold"" from existence. Have more Voyager episodes where they are trying to survive. No Kazon, please.  Fix TNG's Ferengi. They are businessmen - not evil monkeys. Either use the TNG uniforms throughout Generations or get them VOY ones that fit. In terms of directing, that falls on Archer. He was both well written and well acted - but he was made to be Captain Sam Beckett, and that snowballed into lovable action hero. The worst written character is Wesley.

If you take TOS/TAS-TNG-DS9 as a maiden-mother-crone cycle, Voyager was simply the next step in the cycle. It could definitely be improved, but I think that optimism would have been an appropriate tone, or at least should have been in a progressive state.  Enterprise I'm really mixed about rocking-to-the-face. It's got a lot of faults. It also picks up. If there's one show I'd be tempted to meddle with, it'd probably be Enterprise. The setting had so many possibilities and it bungled a lot of them.

But season 3 is when they go ahead and start doing arcs worth caring about. I'm not going to lie and say that there won't be episodes that make you grit your teeth. I mean, there's an episode with more or less Vulcan zombies. But it's still tied in to the larger story of the season. Compare this to season one, where one of the earliest episodes is a weird comic relief episode (before the show had even had many opportunities to do anything) where Trip is impregnated and grows a wrist nipple, or a character inventing/coincidentally naming something relied on in all other series by the end of an episode.  Enterprise may still not suit you, and that's fine. It's a very uneven series and it's a far cry from the glory days. It's also not a coincidence that one of the heights of the show is a two parter that ties into the mirror universe in general and TOS especially.  If you're interested in a hands down good episode however, 3x10, Similitude, is not only a good story with a lot of Star Trek feel to it, but it also feels like something we wouldn't really face in another series set later on.

DaystromInstitute,3clzjz,grapp,8,Wed Jul 8 23:11:40 2015 UTC,"Klingon women were barred from serving on the high council as well as being (usually) barred from leading their houses.  Quoted from the Memory Alpha article on Klingons:   Klingon women were treated as equals, except in politics and matters of inheritance. They were prohibited by law from serving in the High Council and could not take control of their Houses unless they had the money and no male successors of the lineage. Otherwise, Klingon women were expected to exhibit the same physical prowess and lust for blood and honor as the men.   So their society was not equal but was not the worst patriarchy we've seen."
DaystromInstitute,3clzjz,67thou,3,Thu Jul 9 00:03:29 2015 UTC,"Which is why I never understood why Gorkon's daughter in ""The Undiscovered Country"" was elected to high chancellor after her fathers death.  There are a couple of possible explanations:   So late into the negotiations with the Federation, the Council was forced to name her chancellor because she was the only other one who knew everything about the negotiations with Spock. So, an exception caused by extenuating circumstances. This was after all a life and death situation for the Empire. A retcon, I believe the first time we hear about the role of Klingon women in politics is from a TNG episode and Gowron, when asked why the Duras sisters don't claim leadership for themselves he answers ""women may not serve on the Council"". I'm not sure, but I think this TNG episode came after TUC. It could be a simple production oversight, or it could have the in-universe explanation that the Empire was so disgusted with the Khitomer Accords that it was solely blamed on Gorkon's daughter and acted as a precedent for why women are no longer allowed in the government. ""See, this female lead us into peace with the Federation! We are warriors!"" But of course the Empire is too ""honourable"" to renege on the Accords... (unless it suits them!)"
DaystromInstitute,3clzjz,BonzoTheBoss,3,Thu Jul 9 10:54:35 2015 UTC,"I like that second theory a lot.

Though I don't like that Gorkon's daughter may have been  the precedent for ""no females on the council, there doesn't seem to be another satisfactory answer. The Klingon Empire was corrupt by the point in Redemption, so a dumb ruling like that sort of makes sense."

In canon, it's always been considered that most Trek races have moved beyond the idea of "" traditional gender roles"" and are more concerned with the advancement of the species as a whole. Adoption, surrogates, a bit of clever science in the 24th century... These are all things outside of ""P-I-V"" contact that produce children.

There is no reason to suspect that non-humans do not have relationships, social conventions or mores that escape the confines of 20th century western heteronormativity.  In addition, sexual orientation is not a binary but a spectrum or a continuum upon which people identify various roles and behaviors that are similar to their own sexual preferences.   That said, I think The House Of Quark pretty much sums up the patriarchal male domination of Klingon society, because while Grilka is a perfectly capable Klingon woman (or as Quark says, ""FEEEMALE""), although she is much smarter than her contemporaries, she is unable (by law) to head her own house. It might be that homosexual male Klingon marriages are a strategic trade off, because while you effectively have two heads of the house, you don't have any legitimate progeny (unless surrogate parenthood is a thing, probably not since blood relationships are so important to Klingons). Lesbian klingon couples probably have a real shit time in traditional society."

Its possible klingons just dont have the genes for it, or if they do they suppress it since it would be probably seen as disgraceful to their house, entering a relationship that cant produce an heir.

Look at what we've seen of their culture. Warriors are celebrated while all other professions, no matter how necessary they are to their survival, are looked down upon. Their ruling body, the High Council, is made up solely of Warriors, so Farmers, Ship-builders, Engineers, Scientists and the like get no voice in their Government. It seems that only their Monks are shown any amount of respect/deference by Warriors. Effectively this has created a Warrior ""Caste"" that is held in far higher regard than any other possible ""Caste""...

That's further complicated by whether it's proper to use pseudo-slang on duty. When colonists are onscreen they just get called colonists. I think /u/mistakenotmy is right in theorizing that Terran has come to mean human (that's certainly been my headcanon).  Part of this is likely due to the fact that when we meet colonists on another planet, they often are one of, or literally the, first generation on the planet (though there's exceptions). When they're on well established worlds, they become ""inhabitants"", which is probably so people don't have to juggle a ton of slang which may or may not be offensive."

If a colonial visited a different colony there would be confusion.   This brings up a different issue.  Does everyone know all the colonies?  Does it matter?  Everyone probably knows there are Martians, but if I tell someone I am an Alpha Fiver, does that have any significance?  Maybe it doesn't matter or is just good conversation starter.  The other thing to think about may be that the demonym ""Terran"" has morphed to be synonymous with the species.  A lot of times it seems that Terran is just another name for Human.  Then we also have Earther or Earth Man (again could refer to the whole species) as alternates.  I guess a lot probably comes down to context.  When talking to an Alien, all Terran's may just be human.  In another context, Terran would mean a human specifically from Earth.  Wonder if that would give the Universal Translator fits?"

If I am wearing a giant American Flag shit, people who see me are also going to call me an American.  However, if I dress like a European I might blend in and then other Europeans may think I am a European, and call me a European.

DaystromInstitute,3cmd36,mistakenotmy,2,Fri Jul 10 14:57:23 2015 UTC,"Ok, I think we are talking on two different levels.  In this part of the thread I have been talking about individual demonyms.  Not necessarily for large groups.   There is no name for all the Europeans living outside Europe.  All those Europeans are still Europeans because they are named/identified by where they came from (some may call themselves by where they live now, They were a European but now are a Canadian).  If it is a large group of Europeans living in the same place they may even be come a different demonym.  Like the large group of Europeans that became Americans when they colonized.   I am also only talking about in a single lifetime.  A European living outside of Europe may still identify and be identified as european.  However, if they have kids in the new place the kids may then identify with the new place.  For example the european has kids in Canada and raises them there. The kids are Canadian.  However there is exception to that, if the parents maintain there european roots the kids may think of themselves as both canadian and european.  It is very flexible what people identify and are identified as.   You are correct calling everyone a Terran is very broad (but it is a common geographic origin at least). However, if you are an alien species and encounter humans, do you care?  To an alien all humans may just be Terrans.  I wouldn't expect an alien to know or care that I am a Martian, a particular subset of humans that lives on Mars.  Similarly if I am a Magna Roman and encounter an alien and they call me a Terran, I may just go with it at first.  The Alien doesn't know he may have insulted me by calling me a Terran, but it is an honest mistake and I can explain how I am a Magna Roman later."

DaystromInstitute,3clsmj,Rampant_Durandal,6,Wed Jul 8 22:17:26 2015 UTC,"Your theory is generally good. However, I need to focus on one point you make: ""even congergent evolution still has origins that connect to each other"".   The only reason you say this is because the only examples we have of convergent evolution are on this single planet, where all life is descended from a shared original ancestor. However, if we compare penguins and dolphins and sharks, we see the principle of convergent evolution in action - even though one's a bird, one's a mammal, and only one is a fish. Yet, they all share the same streamlined design best suited for moving efficiently through water. Even though the shark is descended from ancestors with no limbs, the penguin is descended from ancestors with four limbs (two legs and two wings), and the dolphin is descended from ancestors with four limbs (four legs), they still converged on similar outcome.  Rest assured that any water-dwelling organisms we find on other planets will also have converged on the same hydrodynamic shape, even though they're not descended from the same original ancestors as life here on Earth. Convergent outcomes don't rely on common ancestry.   That said, I like your theory that the ancient humanoids seeded genetic blueprints for lots of different types of organisms. I always thought it was suspicious that most of the extraterrestrial fauna we saw looked so much like terrestrial fauna."
DaystromInstitute,3clsmj,Algernon_Asimov,2,Wed Jul 8 23:35:45 2015 UTC,"I understand that lifeforms facing the same environmental challenges will have a greater likelihood of evolving solutions that are more similar than different. Of course, there were other genetic manipulators in the galaxy as well. The phenomena of apparent galactic convergent evolution could have been done by any of them.  *I appreciate your interest commander."
DaystromInstitute,3clsmj,Mirror_Sybok,4,Thu Jul 9 05:46:48 2015 UTC,I'm convinced that the Progenitors not only started and guided life on myriad worlds but are still actively doing so. The genetic compatibility between so many different Humanoids after developing separately for billions of years is extremely unlikely. They either left some yet undetected automated technology across the Galaxy (or attached to all genetic material) in order to make sure that life follows a certain path of development or they themselves are still active but are undetectable.
DaystromInstitute,3clsmj,KingofDerby,2,Thu Jul 9 05:17:57 2015 UTC,Agreed. The genetic record of life on Earth does not support a single static seed.

But wait, we have heard for decades that nothing can leave the holodeck? We have heard in virtually all episodes after that that it is light and forcefields, not replicator technology that creates the holodeck.  SO which is it? The common sense answer is, both. Things like water are replicated, and food, but characters are forcefields and light etc. There is more proof that random objects like rocks and chairs are created by forcefields and light then replicators because every instance of objects being removed from the holodeck has them vanishing (picard tossing a book out the door etc)  Its a weird little tid bit./"

Yes, you could holographically create a stream of water, and simulate the physics of it so it responds to the rocks and things in the environment the way that water does. Or you could simply create water at your stream's source, and let physics happen.  In addition to this, like was mentioned elsewhere, consumables make much more sense to be real. If you ate a holographic sandwich, do you want it to disappear as you swallow it, or even as you leave? I think an even greater danger is the risk this poses on your digestive system. If your stomach tries to digest holographic matter, and that matter suddenly vanishes, I imagine it isn't good for your stomach at all.  Of course this does then lead to another question. If you took a holographic book (which was used to demonstrate that a hologram can't leave the holodeck), what would happen if you ripped pages out and ate them?"

On DS9 Quark would replicate food for customers to take into the Holosuite with them.  I think, when it came to food, whether a Federation Holodeck replicated or simulated was up to the user and/or command staff (ie: Voyager put everyone on Replicator Rations, unless they tied the Holodeck into this it would seem to be an easy way to circumvent the Ration system)."
DaystromInstitute,3cl2wm,David-El,4,Fri Jul 10 15:54:05 2015 UTC,"No. Every physical (if replicated) object created by the holodeck's replicators and not the holoprojectors/forcefields is real. For example, if you go to a restaurant in the holodeck and you want the leftovers, you keep them, and the food doesn't vanish from your body. That'd be pointless, and far too much of a transporter hassle. As for things like bullets flying toward the exit, they'd probably not even be permitted by the safeties.  Additionally, there does have to be a level of replication going on, since you can't eat a forcefield."

DaystromInstitute,3cg889,dkuntz2,7,Tue Jul 7 18:47:56 2015 UTC,"Let's do this, but I can't promise you that you'll like how I rationalize it.   The staircases were definitely used and the Observation Lounge's on the Enterprise-D is one way they were shown as used in TNG. If we're looking toward the little Enterprises in the lounge from outside the windows, the door on the left led to a stairwell (no scenes were filmed outside that hallway and the blueprints I cited claim there's a stairwell or ramp there to deck 2 and presumably leading to other stairs and/or turbolift access). In emergencies, Star Trek Generations for example, they were used to get the families to evacuation points quickly due to all the turbolifts being crowded, but we only saw them running through halls on camera. I don't think there were families evacuating through the jefferies tubes, just the halls (please correct me if I'm wrong about that. Haven't seen Generations in a while). Out of universe perhaps people running up wide staircases wasn't as exciting as people crawling through jefferies tubes and running down hallways, but that's beside the point (also they wouldn't build stairs for a shot that was going to last a few seconds on screen).   So the unfortunate situation of it is that the stairs were used, just not on-screen."

As such, it doesn't make sense to put civilians in the secondary hull when they'd need to be evacuated during any separation event."

In Generations, i imagine that was who Gerodi was helping evacuate. Only they had to go through Jefferies Tubes to do it.  This may have been an oversight on the film-makers part though since there are several decks in the drive section that can access the saucer without changing decks. Those would be the most logical place to put the quarters.  Entryway, interesting stuff!"
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,DefiantLoveLetter,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:13:28 2015 UTC,"I could've sworn I saw the opposite.  See the Galaxy Class article on Memory Alpha, Ron D Moore is quoted as saying   ""I believe the children were actually being rushed to their ""crash stations"" or ""emergency stations"" or something, not being brought up from the battle section. The same goes for the patients in sickbay.""   The level of actual canon that comment reflects is up to debate. Based off of that, perhaps civilians who weren't children or patients were being evacuated from the stardrive section, but it makes more sense that all civilian activities besides some very specific subsets reliant on other ship functions, would be kept to the the saucer section as well.  As for who was in the star drive section, it seems more likely that they'd put Starfleet personnel, those who'd signed up for and were more aware of the risks associated with a tour of duty."
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,kodiakus,8,Thu Jul 9 22:11:46 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree. In the case of Star Trek Generations in particular.  When they were evacuating the Enterprise, they state that they need to get people into the Jefferies Tubes, this is when they are evacuating families from a civilian section of the ship. If time was truly of the essence as it was in this example, why would they be climbing up ladders instead of using stairs, if stairs were truly available? Even if the stairs were further away, you can send a lot of people up a stair case quickly but are limited to one person going up a ladder at a time. They even show Geordi climbing up a ladder and then sealing an airlock behind him before reporting to the Bridge that he is clear. Now one may try to assume that the massive crowd running through the halls with Geordi in this scene were heading to a stairwell, but why would Geordi, a high ranking officer tasked with making sure everyone was safely on the saucer section choose to go through a random Jefferies Tube instead of following and making sure the civilians are safely up the stairs? They even show Geordi's fellow engineer going up the ladder before him strongly implying everyone just went through that same tube.  scene in question, starting at 1:15"
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,frezik,5,Tue Jul 7 19:37:35 2015 UTC,Geordi isn't as much as responsible for the people as he is for the ship. Geordi and his engineering staff need to get clear so they can help retake the ship.

A 350m x 450m ellipse has an area over 120000m2 so just the two decks in the middle of the saucer on a Galaxy-class have enough space for every single crew member to have the equivalent of a luxury condo as his or her quarters.  There's more than enough room for stairways everywhere.  At the very least there should be a bunch for emergency situations; it's a ship intended to have families on board and stairwells are easier to use than ladders and jeffries tubes especially when young children are involved.  Of course, the huge amount of space means there's also room for a lot of turbolifts and I regularly see people use the elevator to move one floor even if there's a stairwell nearby and it'd be faster to take it to go up one or two floors.  Maybe people in the future are just as lazy as people are today."
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,cbnyc0,17,Tue Jul 7 18:31:42 2015 UTC,"It's also not a cruise ship, and bear in mind that even if it were, an average sized ocean cruise ship can hold 2-3000 passengers (the biggest ones hold around 6000) That doesn't include the crew. A very large one, Oasis of the Seas is 361.6m long by 47m wide with 16 decks. The EntD is 642m long by 463m wide at 42 decks (albeit not at all the same shape, but the Ent-D probably has more deck space than the Oasis. The Carnival Victory (272.19m Long by 35.36 m wide, 13 decks) hosts a passenger capacity of around 3000 and a crew of around 1000. So the Enterprise hosts around the same number of people as a the Victory when there are NO passengers onboard (which begs the question of why the heck the ship has to be that big - but obviously the rooms and crew cabins are significantly larger and nicer than a cruise ship).   How often do you see CREW using the elevators on those cruise ships? Rarely.  You don't have the same turbolift demand on the Enterprise because you don't have all 1000 crew attending dinner services that start at 5:30 or shows that let out at 9:00 or headed between the newlywed game and the lunch buffet.  Of the thousand crew, some people (maybe not an equal third all the time) will be asleep in 8-hour shifts, other people will be on duty in a fixed location (others will be on duty moving around, but it won't be large groups moving all at the same time). Others will be doing rec activities, but we're already down a relatively small number of people spread out around the ship. I'm sure that if all departments have their three duty shifts end at exactly the same time (rather than stagger them), there is likely a brief period of busy turbolift activity (""rush hour"") as people head to and from work, but 99% of the time, mid-shift, there likely is very little demand.  There's also the question of how often the crew actually may need to head up or down only one or two decks. I occasionally run up or down cruise stairs maybe as many as 5 or 6 decks at a time, but more often only for 2 or 3 (particularly going up). There may also be a lot of lateral movement required to go place to place that cruise ship elevators don't do, but a turbolift would, making it a better choice). We rarely see people wait for turbolifts, and when they do, it's usually not for long (in fact, it's usually for a period convenient to the conversation, but that's besides the point)."
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,Taliesintroll,6,Tue Jul 7 21:09:48 2015 UTC,"Okay, I see your point generally, so I hope you don't mind if I just make a few nitpicks.   - The size of Enterprise vs the Oasis. You'd be better off comparing it with the ResidenSea ship The World, which has luxury suites meant to be lived in long term (more comparable with post scarcity Enterprise), vs a mainstream RCCL ship for 5 day vacations. Here, I looked up the World: Length 196.35 m (644 ft 2 in), width 29.8 m (97 ft 9 in), Decks:   12. Crew and Guests: 400-450. It's about half the size of the Oasis, with less than 10% the number of people.   - Cruise ship crew are generally not allowed to use guest lifts. They have their own crew elevators behind the scenes in crew areas. But yeah, they use lifts too.   - I suspect even in space, that there is a 'day time', because it is simply easier for most work to get done if most of the crew is awake at the same time. Office hours, as it were. And the night shift would simply be a skeleton crew for essential departments. So it wouldn't be an even 1/3.   - Generally speaking I believe that cruise ships are designed so that the Dining Rooms and performance rooms are within a deck of each other or so, to cut down on that exact problem of lift access.   Otherwise, good points. Cheers."
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,Meat_Confetti,4,Tue Jul 7 21:52:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with you; I don't think cruise ship an Enterprise are very good comparisons (which is why I sought to explain the differences between them). I referenced a cruise ship because the OP used their experience with busy cruise ships as their rationale for why stairs would be necessary on the Enterprise.  I also did note that    some people (maybe not an equal third all the time) will be asleep in 8-hour shifts   But it would certainly be far more spread out than on an Earth cruise ship, though I guess it depends on the line (youth/party-oriented vs. older clientele), because it would be far easier for the night-shift crew to adapt to night work. The ""day"" shifters might also adjust their sleep far more than we do. Office workers today may work 8-4, while restaurant workers might work 4-midnight, but both probably end up asleep at least during the 2:00 through 6am period (with the officer worker probably starting to sleep earlier). On the enterprise, someone with the 8-4 shift, might get off duty and relax, like an Earth office worker and sleep 11-6, while the 4-12 am shift worker might instead also go off duty an relax for a while, and only sleep 7am-2pm. There is no evidence really for or against this on the show.    Generally speaking I believe that cruise ships are designed so that the Dining Rooms and performance rooms are within a deck of each other or so, to cut down on that exact problem of lift access.     And yet it's still very busy, and that just reinforces the point that there's nothing on the Enterprise we've seen where 700 of the crew are going to all be coming out of ten-forward after a big show all at 9pm and all be heading down to the holodeck for the next event. Stairs or elevators, the mass-demand (other than during evacuation) isn't the same on the Enterprise as on a cruise ship (thus countering the OPs comparison)"

In comparison, the Pentagon has about 620,000 m2, and over 25,000 people work there.  There's an enormous amount of space on board, far more than is actually necessary.

DaystromInstitute,3cg889,NEM3S1S,2,Tue Jul 7 20:09:39 2015 UTC,"But in emergencies we've heard that ""gravity is offline on decks X, Y, and Z,"" so there isn't a single unified gravitational field at work on the ship, each deck is independent. Maybe there is some relation to the flat planes, and stairs would mean more complex gravity generating systems, which could mean a more damage-susceptible point of failure than with the turbolift systems."

DaystromInstitute,3cg889,queenofmoons,5,Tue Jul 7 21:36:03 2015 UTC,"Starfleet vessels are predominantly naval vessels, not cruise ships, with the exception of Galaxy-class vessels. In that case, function beats form, and that means turbolifts. Remember, when turbolifts get knocked out, the crew already has bigger problems to deal with. For the majority of the time, they're perfectly functional, so having stairs for sake of convenience is just a waste of space, considering that they won't be used for the majority of the time. Ladders, hidden in service tubes behind the bulkheads, provide a perfectly fine solution for the (admittedly) rare cases that the turbolifts are out of service."
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,Kamala_Metamorph,3,Tue Jul 7 19:21:56 2015 UTC,"But it really isn't that rare when the Turbolifts go out, it happens several times a season in each series.  As for it being a Naval vessel, i covered this in my OP when i posted a link to the stairwells that Naval ships have. Stairs are far more functional than turbolifts and elevators on most vessels, so really what Star Trek is doing is trying to argue that form beats function.   Every building has emergency exits even if the frequency of an emergency is low, the need arises in an emergency. Star Ships have ladders instead of stairs for emergencies, but it's completely impractical. They are not as effective at allowing people to move around the ship in a hurry. And as you said, if the turbolifts are out they have bigger problems, but those problems need to be addressed and to do so typically involves crew members being able to ""quickly"" get to their stations. Crowding a bunch of people into small access ways on ladders to move over 10 decks in an emergency is far from the best course of action."
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,OldPinkertonGoon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:28:10 2015 UTC,"I saw the stairs in your original post, but imagine for a moment that you don't actually need them. Those stairs are for regular use to move between decks, but for the majority of the time on a ship (i.e. whenever it's not in critical danger), the turbolifts work perfectly well. You're moving hundreds of feet in any given direction very quickly in a turbolift, as opposed to climbing up and down stairs.  Also keep in mind that stairs take up space, are immovable, and vastly inferior to turbolifts. If the ship takes a hit and a bulkhead collapses, it could potentially block a stairwell. If it blocks a turbolift, no problem, hop in a Jeffries tube to the next deck and ride it there. If it blocks a stairwell, go use a Jeffries tube? That completely defeats the purpose in the first place.  Turbolifts are a priority system. If they're knocked out, it's because other critical systems are already gone. It's not like a ship takes a torpedo and bam, no turbolifts. When I say ""they have bigger problems"", I don't mean the Titanic has struck the iceberg. I mean the Titanic is literally upside-down in the water."
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,BigTaker,2,Tue Jul 7 20:19:46 2015 UTC,"Let's saw a person needs to go up 1 deck from their quarters to a lab that is basically right above them. Thats not moving hundreds of feet its moving less than 30, a staircase would make that a shorter trip than finding a turbolift. This assumes the stairs are plentiful. So lets ignore that for a moment.  BUT in the realm of moving hundreds of feet, what if i need to get somewhere on the same deck that is far away, i doubt they used turbolifts for that, they would just walk. There is a lot of walking in the hallways on Star Trek, every show every episode shows it. I doubt they are just turbolifting everywhere all the time and if they were, we would see it far more often than we see them waling in the halls.  As for taking up space, not necessarily. The image i liked in the op showing a typical Naval stairway, takes up very little room. We know that the ships have hatches in the floors/ceilings (as seen in TNG ""First Contact""), and with their future technology there's no reason why they cant have something like a collapsible attic stairway that deploys when the hatch is opened, even though i still believe a solid permanent stairway would be just as practical and take up a negligible amount of space. Especially on very large ships like the Enterprise. Smaller ships may need to have more compact steps installed.  You gave an example of when a stairwell may become blocked or damaged, but any damage that would occur that could block the stairwell could easily block a turbolift shaft and/or a Jefferies Tube. Why would damage only impact a stairwell? Especially if the stairs were compact as in normal modern day Naval ships?   As for using Jefferies Tubes for getting between decks, their main purpose are for maintenance access. They could easily have both stairs and Jefferies Tubes as the primary functions are not the same . IF both the stairs and the Turbolifts were damaged then Jefferies Tubes could still be used. But to go right to using Jefferies Tubes is impractical.  In episodes where disasters strike and Turbolifts are offline, usually so are the systems that connect the bridge to engineering, and in these episodes the crew has to crawl hundreds of feet through laddered tubes to get where they need to go to fix things. In this case Stairs would be far more effective and could let them get where they are going much quicker, helping them get through an emergency faster.  Imagine if the evacuation plans for a skyscraper was a small tubed ladder going down 40 stories. That would be outrageous in an emergency. Star Trek has shown time and time again that their technology fails and they need more primitive backups to save them. A ladder for example. What i am saying is that stairs are a more practical backup than a ladder."
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,BestCaseSurvival,2,Tue Jul 7 20:50:20 2015 UTC,"Stairs take up more space than turbolifts or ladders. Look at Main Engineering. A staircase to the second level would take up much more room than the ladders and lifts that are being used. Space is a premium on ships (again, except on Galaxy-class, which is designed with form in mind), so it has to be used efficiently. Ladders and lifts fit that bill.  Here's a bit of a dark example, since you mentioned skyscrapers: The WTC had stairs, and you saw what a lot of good it did for the people inside. What I'm saying is that if the turbolifts are down, escape already isn't an option. In combat, escape pods are basically worthless. The only time they could potentially provide use in combat is something like Wolf 359, where it was one vessel against a fleet, and small pods could float around unmolested.  The point I'm trying to make is that if the turbolifts are down, your day is already over. They're supposed to be one of the last things to fail, so if they aren't working, the battle is already lost."
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,BestCaseSurvival,2,Tue Jul 7 21:32:02 2015 UTC,I think your form v. function argument is precisely backwards. Things that get shot at need damage control tolerances.
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,BestCaseSurvival,2,Tue Jul 7 20:58:57 2015 UTC,"That's like saying they need some sort of backup for when the warp core overloads. Turbolifts are a critical system. When they go down, there is no backup. They're like weapons, shields, the warp core. There is no Plan B for those systems, there is only Plan A: Keep those systems functioning at all costs.  Think of it this way: When Life Support goes down, the backup is portable respirators. When the turbolifts go down, the Jeffries tubes are the backup."
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,BestCaseSurvival,2,Tue Jul 7 21:24:51 2015 UTC,"...and that tube network should include some full size stairways,, like several of the concept designers for the -D included in plans  but were never filmed. The ship's real designers acknowledged the need, but multi-story tracking shots are a pain. There's not a good reason for the utility passages to be miniaturized either, while we're at it. The elevators aren't not like the warp core at all. The crew still has legs and the occasional desire to go to physically adjacent spaces.  A starship includes about as much volume as a big office building. A big office building is pretty non functional without elevators. Hundred floor commutes are deal breakers. They still  have stairs. The stairs get used. The stairs are considered more critical for emergency operations than the elevators. Ship stairs are preferable to ladders on ships because they can be  transited carrying a load."
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,lunatickoala,2,Wed Jul 8 00:43:34 2015 UTC,"Wow, very interesting point! I had not yet considered the added bonus of being able to carry a load while traversing a staircase."

I thought that was at the core of your argument for stairs vs Jeffries tubes, especially for large groups of people moving quickly. You need your hands for the ladders, you can't carry stuff in your arms (like babies, people) when climbing or getting through the tubes."
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,saintnicster,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:32:12 2015 UTC,"Nope, my main points were that stairs allowed for faster traversing than stairs, allowed more people to traverse at once, provided a secondary means of navigation around the ship if a crewman was not interested in using a turbolift. I was focused primarily on the fact that we have seen the crew often forced to climb through Jefferies Tubes which seemed inefficient when compared to stairs, something we modern humans have in every building and on every ocean ship.  I'll be honest, i don't often see crew carrying around a bunch of bulky items, so it had not really been a core concept i had considered in my initial idea.  That being said, as others have been pointing out, ramps would also provide all of these benefits and possibly would be even more beneficial to carrying heavy loads, with an added bonus they could be used by anti grav carts as well."

DaystromInstitute,3cg889,vicextralife,9,Thu Jul 9 18:41:50 2015 UTC,"Stairs are not safe. Humans are fleshy and unstable, and nearby stellar phenomena, weapons fire, et cetera tends to make the Inertial Dampers overcompensate and cause people to go careening out of their chairs even when sitting down. Sick Bay would have ten times the patient volume just dealing with broken bones from people who were on the stairs when the Unexpected Thing of the Week happened and sent crew, civilians, and children careening down a flight of stairs. Contrast with turbolifts, where a lot of things have to go wrong in order to break the safety protocols, and jeffries tubes/ladders, where if you are traversing the ship that way, you are by necessity gripping your mode of transit and are much harder to shake loose. Stairs are slow. The Enterprise D has 42 decks. 20 in the saucer section. Given that crewmen are shown going from station to station all over the ship, that's extremely inefficient. Contrast to the fact that the longest we've ever seen anyone wait for a turbolift was in ""We'll Always Have Paris"" where Data and Picard only have to wait for a turbolift because their temporal echoes are already in it.  Stairs are unnecessary. From a narrative perspective, they serve no purpose. The only times I can recall that people were 'stuck' in sections of the ship was due to emergency protocols - radiation, or hull breaches, or other catastrophes made it impossible to use the hallways, not just the turbolifts. In security situations, either stairs are a massive vulnerability which prevent security from procedurally corralling a fugitive, or they are redundant as the tech-savvy hostile-takeover-artist (Data in ""Brothers,"" to name a prime example) can use the security protocols that keep the stairs from being a ship-depopulating hull breach waiting to happen to his own advantage. Adding another line of dialogue is unnecessarily burdensome.    So as far as I can tell, your strongest point here is that, in a very specific type of emergency where there is no immediate threat to the ship but all the power except life support is out, stairs would allow civilians to move from deck to deck slightly faster. For this, you would introduce massive holes between decks so that in a slightly worse emergency, a hull breach on a single deck sucks all the air out of the entire ship.  No thanks."
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,Hobbyte,4,Tue Jul 7 22:37:29 2015 UTC,"Stairs are safer than ladders:: Turbolifts are clearly the preferred method of transportation on board Star Fleet vessels. Comparing Turbolifts to stairs and ladders is a waste of time, the use of ladders or stairs would typically only be when turbolifts are either inefficient for the destination or they are out of order. So i am not advocating people use stairs in place of turbolifts. If your assessment were correct, then ladders would replace every emergency stairway in every building in the country. Especially in the times where a building is being evacuated due to an Earth Quake. Moreover i have pointed out several times that the use of a ladder in an emergency takes longer than the use of a staircase. Additionally more people can make use of a stair case at the same time effectively allowing a ship to get repair crews in place far quicker. If you are unstable on a stair you can lay down, if you are unstable on a ladder you can fall and catch your leg on a rung. Stairs are much faster than ladders. Again i have not been advocating that stairs be used in place of Turbolifts as the primary source of transportation, but rather in place of the use of Jefferies Tubes for transportation. IF the turbolifts go down, then use the stairs. IF the turbolift is not nearby but the stairs are and you are going up 1 deck, use the stairs. IF the power has failed, use the stairs. IF and most importantly, there is a ship wide emergency where turbolifts are inoperable or overcrowded (the evacuation of the Enterpise D in Generations) stairs would be far faster at getting people out of the damaged Drive Section. Stairs are faster than ladders, this has always been my point. Stairs may not be ""necessary"" but they are far more practical and advantageous than ladders. They serve plenty of purpose. As listed in point #2, there are many times where the usage of stairs makes more sense than the usage of ladders. In the case of security needing to capture an escapee, they use forcefields, and there is no reason they cannot deploy them at the entrance to a stairwell. If the force field is offline, there is no reason they can't have doors at the entrance to the stairwell (i mean they have doors on every room already). As for stairs being a ship-depopulating hull breach waiting to happen, care to elaborate how then every sea bearing vessel on Earth makes use of stairs? They too risk deadly hull breaches and yet have found that stairs provide a faster means of escape than ladders. There is no reason water tight (or in our case vacuum tight) doors cannot be placed at the entrance to stairs.   You are completely mis-reading my entire point.  My point is that:  Stairs are more logical than ladders, both in an emergency and in terms of alternative transportation if/when a turbolift is down or otherwise occupied.  Stairs would not add any more of a massive hole in a deck than the massive holes made by the turbolifts!  A hull breach would already be a risk to an entire ship if they didnt have emergency bulkheads and force fields, thus, absolutely no reason why they cannot have emergency bulkheads or forcefields on or at the entrance to stairwells. (See any modern naval craft for an example how their stairs are not a massive risk for hull breach)  Stairs would not be a replacement for Turbolifts, never said that.  They would be practical and applicable to almost EVERY type of emergency not just very specific ones. Computer failure? Stairs are a manual override. Power failure? Stairs are a manual override. Computer hacked and under control of an enemy and they shut down the lifts? Stairs are a manual override. Massive ship wide evacuation? Stairs are faster than Jeffereies tubes and Turbolifts are likely to be overcrowded. Hull breach and emergency force fields on the brink of collapsing? Stairs provide a faster way out of the section or off the deck. Stairs DO NO take up that much room, especially when you are using advanced Star Fleet materials to construct them."
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,cbnyc0,5,Tue Jul 7 23:26:22 2015 UTC,"You are completely mis-reading my entire point.   I'm almost positive I'm not.   Stairs are more logical than ladders, both in an emergency and in terms of alternative transportation if/when a turbolift is down or otherwise occupied. Stairs would not add any more of a massive hole in a deck than the massive holes made by the turbolifts!   Yes,they would. They cut a diagonal hole between decks that has to be as wide in its direction of traverse as a human is tall. Turbolifts are pods which are already safety-sealed at every junction simply by virtue of following the form-factor of an elevator. Their intersection with the atmosphere-carrying portions of the deck are limited both in terms of raw physical surface area and in terms of time, because turbolifts don't stand open by default. Even if they did stand open by default, they would not directly link to other atmosphere-carrying portions of the ship. They are discrete transit nodes, not continuous ones.    A hull breach would already be a risk to an entire ship if they didnt have emergency bulkheads and force fields, thus, absolutely no reason why they cannot have emergency bulkheads or forcefields on or at the entrance to stairwells. (See any modern naval craft for an example how their stairs are not a massive risk for hull breach)   So you are now either opening and closing a bulkhead door every time you want someone to use the stairs. Or else you are leaving them open by default and trusting that the exactly correct level of emergency happens and no more. Or else you are making them emergency-only modes of transit so that the civilians are not familiar with them on a day-to-day and instinctive level.   Stairs would not be a replacement for Turbolifts, never said that.   So you're adding extra huge holes between atmospheric containers.    They would be practical and applicable to almost EVERY type of emergency not just very specific ones. Computer failure? Stairs are a manual override.    So are jeffries tubes, which also provide access to the rest of the manual overrides and maintenance doohickeys. Why stairs?    Power failure? Stairs are a manual override.    Unless you're trying to conserve life support, in which case you need to crank open one bulkhead, perch awkwardly on the stairs while you crank it closed and sealed, climb down the stairs, perch awkwardly, crank open the other bulkhead, crank it closed and sealed again,  et cetera. And where is the advantage over jeffries tubes?   Computer hacked and under control of an enemy? Stairs are a manual override.    And the advantage is where?   Massive ship wide evacuation? Stairs are faster than Jeffereies tubes and Turbolifts are likely to be overcrowded.    This is literally the only time so far where stairs are advantageous and not a liability. Stairs are built for massive throughput, which under normal circumstances does not happen aboard a starship. Small teams of crewmen go from lab to workstation. During emergencies, civilians stay put or congregate in designated shelters which are on every deck, at least aboard a Galaxy-class starship. An emergency so precisely calibrated that there's a) enough warning, b) somewhere to go, and c) still a rush that forces people to take the stairs is, to the best of my knowledge, unheard of in 28 seasons of live-action Star Trek, two animated series, and 12 movies.    Hull breach and emergency force fields on the brink of collapsing? Stairs provide a faster way out of the section or off the deck.    And since we are considering disaster scenarios, the inevitable conclusion of that is that the forcefields fail when the evacuation train is traversing the stairs, sucking out all the atmosphere on multiple decks and gruesomely crushing people in the bulkheads if by some miracle they manage to auto-close even after the power to the force fields has failed.   Stairs DO NO take up that much room, especially when you are using advanced Star Fleet materials to construct them.   Building materials have nothing to do with it. You're either imaging stairs that are 21st-century-building-code-fire-exit-standard 2.5 people wide, which takes up a vertical shaft three meters square and tends to get people trampled in emergencies, or you're imagining stairs wide enough that they actually fit the bulkhead prop aboard the Enterprise D, which is huge, or you're imagining a spiral staircase, which are basically useless for two-way travel and which running up or down would pretty much instantly kill you. Stairways have certain form factors they must adhere to in order to be useful as stairs.   Also, consider the drinking straw effect. Presuming you make ugly, functional, OSHA-approved staircases. The instant atmosphere is disrupted at one end (and you know that it will be because eventually everything has to break aboard an Enterprise) and the bulkheads fail to close (and you know that they will because eventually everything has to break aboard an Enterprise) the narrower pipe that the atmosphere has to travel through will apply a relatively higher pressure on anyone in the staircase, tumbling them backwards and either breaking every bone in their bodies, cracking their skulls on the steps behind them, or sucking them out into space.   Again, the advantage of ladders is that you are, by necessity, gripping them tightly at all times. With staircases, you can add a railing but people will ignore it and then die horribly when the ship shakes because an anomaly sneezed.   If your argument were that the emergency ladder system needs safety railings, I would agree. But I would never use the staircase on any ship that isn't on a routine and well-mapped course, because there are temporal space krakens out there that just randomly appear and you do not want to be standing on a series of sharp corners when it happens."
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,Hobbyte,5,Tue Jul 7 23:55:01 2015 UTC,"I'm almost positive I'm not.   But you sure seemed to be when you compared turbolifts to stairs, when i was comparing stairs to ladders. I am not advocating the removal of Turbolifts, so why bring up how turbolifts are faster than stairs? Thats stating the obvious and not addressing my point.   They cut a diagonal hole between decks that has to be as wide in its direction of traverse as a human is tall.    This is false. the following images show the holes, how they can be sealed and how they are far far smaller than the size of a turbolift as seen in Star Trek example 1  example 2  example 3  Even still, the width of a turbo lift is about the same width as 4 adults standing shoulder to shoulder. This is not even including the width of the shell of the turbolift itself or the motors. By then you are looking at a hole that is easily 10 feet across. Stairs don't have to be much bigger than that.   Turbolifts are pods which are already safety-sealed at every junction simply by virtue of following the form-factor of an elevator. Their intersection with the atmosphere-carrying portions of the deck are limited both in terms of raw physical surface area and in terms of time, because turbolifts don't stand open by default.   In TNG ""Disaster"" Picard the children climb up the turbolift tube, when the lift falls the entire shaft becomes this long multi deck tube. Had there been a hull breach at any point along that tube, then you would have a multideck hull breach.   So you are now either opening and closing a bulkhead door every time you want someone to use the stairs. Or else you are leaving them open by default and trusting that the exactly correct level of emergency happens and no more.    If i am not mistaken, there are doors on every turbolift, why would walking through a door that automatically opens for you on every single room on a ship, on every single turbolift on a ship suddenly become this horrible nuisance when entering a stair well? If we expect that those same doors shown on every turbolift are capable of containing atmosphere in the event of a hull breach, why can we not trust them to do the same as the entry to a stairwell? Why can't a stairwell have an emergency bulkhead between decks?   So you're adding extra huge holes between atmospheric containers.   So now you admit that the turbolifts are holes? It's either they are or they aren't. If turbolifts are holes, then whatever means they utilize to keep atmosphere safe during an emergency would be just as effective in a stairwell. This point doesn't make sense.   So are jeffries tubes, which also provide access to the rest of the manual overrides and maintenance doohickeys. Why stairs?   I've been saying it all along, its far faster and safer to use stairs than ladders. Let me also point out that if you are so concerned with doors being used so often on stairwells, why then do you accept doors every 20 feet in a Jefferies tube? They have a small hatch at every deck as well. Those doors are not even automatic, they are manual so they would take even more time and effort to operate than doors at the entrance to stair wells.   Unless you're trying to conserve life support, in which case you need to crank open one bulkhead, perch awkwardly on the stairs while you crank it closed and sealed, climb down the stairs, perch awkwardly, crank open the other bulkhead, crank it closed and sealed again, et cetera.   You mean the exact same thing we see being done in every Jefferies Tube ever shown in Star Trek?   And where is the advantage over jeffries tubes?   That you would be standing up while doing not hanging onto a ladder. We discussed safety before, so now we have crew members operating a manual latch while standing on a ladder, so now they are compromising their safety by no longer keeping both hands on the ladder? Stairs are sounding even safer to me now.   And the advantage is where? (regarding computer hacked)   Manual release levers at doors to stairwells. Not hanging on a ladder. Not climbing through a small tube.   An emergency so precisely calibrated that there's a) enough warning, b) somewhere to go, and c) still a rush that forces people to take the stairs is, to the best of my knowledge, unheard of in 28 seasons of live-action Star Trek, two animated series, and 12 movies.   Apparently you don't pay enough attention. TNG they performed 4 on screen saucer separations which required the evacuation of the crew to various sections. Voyager had evacuations several times on screen. But most of all, since i am arguing that stairs be used in place of the ladders in the Jefferies tubes, basically every single time (many) that they are shown climbing those ladders they could have been using stairs instead. It does not always warrant a specific emergency. But even if it did, it is far from ""unheard of"".   And since we are considering disaster scenarios, the inevitable conclusion of that is that the forcefields fail when the evacuation train is traversing the stairs, sucking out all the atmosphere on multiple decks and gruesomely crushing people in the bulkheads if by some miracle they manage to auto-close even after the power to the force fields has failed.   Again, why can emergency bulkheads not be used? Exactly how do you think a deck is secured during a hull breach? If you believe a stairwell leaves a gaping hole open for all decks, why are you not concerned with the lack of doors in hallways? That would mean an entire deck get's sucked out during a hull breach which we know is not the case. Adding stairs to a section does not mean emergency bulkheads and doors can no longer function all of a sudden.   If your argument were that the emergency ladder system needs safety railings, I would agree. But I would never use the staircase on any ship that isn't on a routine and well-mapped course.   Well lets hope you don't end up on an ocean vessel then. They all have stairs."

That's because you do on multiple occasions.   I stayed on a ship once where it was far quicker to take the stairs up 3 decks than wait for one of the 6 elevators nearby. Simply because the ship had so many people the lifts were basically always in use.   To which I replied that stairs are not more convenient than turbolifts in non-emergency situations.  and   Over and over again we see issues where the Turbolifts become damaged in an attack or emergency, and the crew get's cut off from the rest of the ship.

By then you are looking at a hole that is easily 10 feet across. Stairs don't have to be much bigger than that.   And here, to which I will now reply that stairs take up more space than ladders and are not safer, nor are the stairs you provide an example of going to have any significantly higher throughput than jeffries tubes in the excessively rare occasions where you need high throughput in an emergency.    In TNG ""Disaster"" Picard the children climb up the turbolift tube, when the lift falls the entire shaft becomes this long multi deck tube. Had there been a hull breach at any point along that tube, then you would have a multideck hull breach.   If there had been a hull breach at any point along that tube, then all of the doors along that tube are still shut, and an area of the ship which opens onto living quarters is not vented to space.    If i am not mistaken, there are doors on every turbolift, why would walking through a door that automatically opens for you on every single room on a ship, on every single turbolift on a ship suddenly become this horrible nuisance when entering a stair well? If we expect that those same doors shown on every turbolift are capable of containing atmosphere in the event of a hull breach, why can we not trust them to do the same as the entry to a stairwell? Why can't a stairwell have an emergency bulkhead between decks?   Because now you are in an emergency. During nominal operations, you don't need stairs because they are slower than the turbolifts you are right now at this moment comparing them to.   During emergencies when there are power outages, the doors don't work and you have to crank them manually.  During emergencies where there are hull breaches, you already want to minimize your traversing of the ship in order to limit the chances that you will get sucked out into space. During these times, you would much rather be on a ladder or in small, easily-closed sections with lots of handholds.   The emergency bulkheads you're referencing take significantly longer to open than standard sliding doors. Time them. The added inconvenience would decrease utilization of the stairs by civilians and in non-emergency situations.  Rather than addressing the rest of your post point by point, I will ask you to clarify something.   Which of the following are you trying to say:   That, in non-emergency situations, stairs would add utility and convenience to the ship, by providing heightened throughput for civilian transit. That, in the majority of emergency situations stairs would add utility and convenience to the ship by allowing essential crew members to traverse the ship more quickly and safely. That in the majority of emergency situations stairs would add utility and convenience to the ship by allowing massive throughput of civilian traffic from one area to another. Some other specific design goal that you can state in 40 words or less.   Please note that 1, 2, and 3 are nearly mutually exclusive due to the differing design constraints between convenience and disaster utility. The Galaxy-class design already has systems built for both extremes of this continuum - the turbolifts are convenient and the jeffries tubes skew towards utilitarian functionalism. Stairs are a compromise that either compromise ship safety in the name of convenience in a way that turbolifts do not, or are so overdesigned as to be useless during everyday activities."
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,Hobbyte,2,Wed Jul 8 01:36:05 2015 UTC,"That's because you do on multiple occasions.   Ah so if i provide 1 example where i found using a staircase to be more efficient than using an elevator, it must mean that i am advocating the complete removal of turbolifts all together? Even though i clearly followed it up with:   Now, granted, the Turbolifts in Star Trek are quite efficient they can take a crew member from the bottom most part of a ship to the bridge very quickly they don't even need to change lifts at any point in the trip as the Turbolift will go sideways as well   Its quite convenient for you to ignore the flow of my OP, where i discuss that yes Turbolifts are efficient, but that turbolifts are not infallible and that the result is the frequent need to use Jefferies Tubes in emergencies or other problematic situations, where i then follow it up with my main point, that they should have stairs as an added alternative. It's clear as day that my point was stairs would be good to use in place of Jeffereies Tubes for a whole array of circumstances. And i have not been advocating that they replace Turbolifts.   To which I replied that stairs are not significantly safer than turbolifts either during or just prior to emergencies.   Not always true. Stairs would be far safer than turbolifts if the turbolifts were damaged. You would get into a damaged system and risk getting trapped or killed if the inertial dampeners were offline? The show has shown the lifts become inoperable plenty of times. So again, it's quite clear that i am discussing what to do in those situations, where the Turbolifts are inoperable or damaged, situations which have been shown often enough.  (TNG Disaster)  (TNG Contagion) (DS9 The Forsaken) are times where the Turbolifts were damaged to the point of being dangerous for those using them. The times where they are simply offline add to my point   stairs take up more space than ladders   True, but the difference is negligible. You seem to be under this assumption that every single Star Ship suffers from a serious lack of square footage in order to consider any other possibility to backup crew access. This may literally only be true for the Defiant as every other on screen portrayal of the ships shows considerable space allotted for the Jefferies Tube ladders, entire rooms dedicated to them in fact! 1. example 2. example 2 3. example 3  Example 3 may be the most important considering how it clearly shows that it has been allotted more room than would be required to have something like this example 4 That image shows a system of stairway access with seal-able bulkheads on each level and far less room taken up than the Jefferies Tube shown on screen.   are not safer   I disagree.   nor are the stairs you provide an example of going to have any significantly higher throughput than Jefferies tubes in the excessively rare occasions where you need high throughput in an emergency.   Whats most interesting about this point, or rather my response to this point is that i get to keep it in the Star Trek Universe! In Star Trek 4, when Chekov and Uhura are on board the USS Enterprise Carrier, the naval MP's are shown traversing these very same type of stairs. They are shown using them quite quickly. Much faster than a ladder in fact. IF using a ladder was faster than using these stairs, Navy ships would clearly use them instead, they have a high investment in getting crew around their ships quickly, as would Star Fleet.   If there had been a hull breach at any point along that tube, then all of the doors along that tube are still shut, and an area of the ship which opens onto living quarters is not vented to space.   As would any doors at the entry way to a stairway, i made this point already. Doors don't suddenly become useless just because there are stairs behind them.   Because now you are in an emergency. During nominal operations, you don't need stairs because they are slower than the turbolifts you are right now at this moment comparing them to.   Yup, if the Turbolifts are working use them, again, i am talking about the times where they have used the Jefferies Tubes and not the turbolifts. Im not sure how many times i have to repeat this.   During emergencies when there are power outages, the doors don't work and you have to crank them manually.   Yup we covered this already too. There are doors at every deck for the Jefferries Tube. As a matter of fact there are also doors at the entrance to every single ladder junction as well. So basically we are talking about the crew having to deal with the exact same number of doors if they were using stairs or using Jefferies Tubes. Only they get to be standing upright and not hanging off a ladder. Much safer to use stairs here.   During emergencies where there are hull breaches, you already want to minimize your traversing of the ship in order to limit the chances that you will get sucked out into space. During these times, you would much rather be on a ladder or in small, easily-closed sections with lots of handholds.   Why? The doors we keep talking about are supposed to be keeping them safe right? So would the doors at the entry to stairwells. So would the bulkheads between decks. Doors in a tube or doors on a stairway, still doors, still keeping the space at bay.   The emergency bulkheads you're referencing take significantly longer to open than standard sliding doors. Time them. The added inconvenience would decrease utilization of the stairs by civilians and in non-emergency situations.   Time what? The doors shown in the Jefferies Tubes ladders move at an acceptable pace. The doors at the entrance to the Ladder junctions move as quickly as any other doors shown on the ship. No reason stair way bulkhead doors need to move slower, why impose this imaginary limit? The vertical emergency bulkheads that have been shown on screen were slow moving to give crew time to pass them not because of any engineering limitation. Bulkheads on modern day ships can close very quickly, why would they suddenly be unable to keep up hundreds of years in the future?   Which of the following are you trying to say: That, in non-emergency situations, stairs would add utility and convenience to the ship, by providing heightened throughput for civilian transit. That, in the majority of emergency situations stairs would add utility and convenience to the ship by allowing essential crew members to traverse the ship more quickly and safely. That in the majority of emergency situations stairs would add utility and convenience to the ship by allowing massive throughput of civilian traffic from one area to another.    Yes Yes Yes   And since you asked:  ""4."" That in all of the above given examples and some other non stated examples, the stairs would be more efficient and more effective at providing those utilities than the currently used and portrayed Jefferies Tube ladders.   Stairs are a compromise that either compromise ship safety in the name of convenience in a way that turbolifts do not, or are so over designed as to be useless during everyday activities.   Again i am not advocating that stairs replace Turbolifts as the preferred form of transport, i really wish you would stop suggesting that. I have time and time again addressed this over multiple posts including the OP. The only time i suggest using stairs over a turbolift has been in cases where one is not traveling very far, the primary purpose was the address the shows usage of the ladders.  Additionally, the stairs i keep linking are quite simple in design and would not need to be over designed nor are they useless for everyday use. Perhaps you would be interested in looking at current modern day naval vessels in more detail, specifically the day to day life for the crew who use the very same stairs i keep linking, used on a daily basis and manage to find them effective. They also manage to use them in emergencies and battle drills efficiently."
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,CiaranC14,4,Wed Jul 8 02:24:54 2015 UTC,"Stairs would be far safer than turbolifts if the turbolifts were damaged.    Times when the only people who should be moving around the ship are essential personnel performing maintenance tasks. During these times, how are the jeffries tubes so insufficient that an entirely superfluous mode of transit should be added?   Whats most interesting about this point, or rather my response to this point is that i get to keep it in the Star Trek Universe! In Star Trek 4, when Chekov and Uhura are on board the USS Enterprise Carrier, the naval MP's are shown traversing these very same type of stairs.   You mean, a ship which lacks both magic elevators and maintenance tunnels has a compromise between the two systems? Shocking! Yes, if Starfleet had to settle on a single mode of deck traverse, stairs would be useful. However, since it has both emergency tunnels and magic elevators that go sideways as well as vertically, stairs are a superfluous system.   Yup, if the Turbolifts are working use them, again, i am talking about the times where they have used the Jefferies Tubes and not the turbolifts. Im not sure how many times i have to repeat this.   Until you just once explain why it's better to add in an extra point of failure between atmospheric containers.   Yup, if the Turbolifts are working use them, again, i am talking about the times where they have used the Jefferies Tubes and not the turbolifts. Im not sure how many times i have to repeat this.   Negates point 1 below.   Points 2 and 3 are mutually exclusive. You can't rely on civilians and children to behave properly during an evacuation scenario using stairs modeled after those on a relatively cramped oceangoing vessel. You can have stairs that are a couple of bodies wide, which increases the throughput of air as well as people in the event of the inevitable hull-breach-and-the-doors-won't-close, or you can have narrow maintenance stairs which are functionally equivalent to ladders except that you just cut more holes in the deck. Or I guess you can have both and cut even more holes in the deck to vastly increase the fail points on the ship.  You are committing two cardinal sins of design here, and if you're hell-bent on it, I won't stop you. I'll just never set foot on any ship you design without an environment suit.   The first is that when planning for a disaster, you're forgetting the disaster. There are classes of emergency that occur aboard a starship that are very distinct. Sometimes just the power goes out and a couple of techs have to trudge around the ship. More often, though, for a ship whose charter is to find new stuff and also patrol hostile borders, disasters can involve multiple system failures and hull breaches. In such circumstances, you want your atmospheric containers to have as few holes in them as possible without imparing normal day-to-day operations. Every hole you cut in the deck is one more type of catastrophe that can kill even more people. Sure, if it doesn't kill extra people then it's marginally easier to do repairs. That is excessively not worth the risk.  The second is that you are trying to design general architecture for edge cases. To illustrate this, look at the episode ""Brothers,"" when Data takes over the ship by copying Picard's command codes. For a contemporary example, look at how they collected evidence on Ross Ulbricht. Both of these flaws involved betrayal by an asset that had spent years seeming to be perfectly loyal. Is it possible to defend against this? Yes, but it requires building so much paranoia into your daily routine that it makes normal operations impossible. Ulbricht could have run his laptop with a dead battery in the slot and the cable wrapped around his hand and nothing saved to memory, but that would have made it next to impossible to make his living. Picard could change his access code every hour and spend his life inside a suit of armor so that Data couldn't rip his hand off to pass biometric locks, but that would make everyday life impossible.   Are there episodes where stairs would have been convenient? Sure. Are they worth it given the hazards they pose and the negligible utility they present? Not in the slightest."
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,idwthis,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:21:33 2015 UTC,"how are the jeffries tubes so insufficient that an entirely superfluous mode of transit should be added?   Your entire argument is that stairs are unnecessary because Jeffries tubes are sufficient.  I find this to be a false premise.  Try moving a few hundred meters in cramped passageways on your hands and knees, climb up a dozen floors on ladders, then say that Jeffries tubes are sufficient.  Starships in Star Trek are enormous.  Even the Constitution-class is as long as a modern aircraft carrier, but is much much wider and has more decks thus having much more volume.  Moreover, much less of this space is devoted to machinery, munitions stores, and hangars or shuttlebays.  And this much larger volume only has one tenth of the crew requirement.  The Galaxy-class is over twice the length, height, and width yet has just twice the crew.  Ten times the volume for just over twice the crew.  And if Nemesis is to be believed there are large Star Wars-style chasms in the ship that serve no purpose at all.  Jeffries tubes were created and used for dramatic purposes, not for functional reasons.  When a disaster happens, time is the single most critical asset.  The difference of just a couple minutes can be the difference between life and death, especially in the case of injury.  When an emergency happens, it's more important that you be able to get emergency responders and damage control teams to the site than it is to make a slightly smaller hole in the deck, and that's assuming that forcefields and structural integrity fields aren't providing most of the actual hull strength.  When having to move injured people, or carry equipment in order to fix something, a ladder is pretty much the absolute last thing you want.  If you need to get people to Engineering to stop a breach, you don't want them crawling there on their hands and knees (and warp core breaches are far too common on the Galaxy-class).  You greatly underestimate the utility of stairs vs ladders.  Saving even minutes isn't a marginal improvement in emergency response, it's a massive improvement.  Likewise, you greatly overestimate the hazards caused by stairs.  A wider deck cutout for a stairway as opposed to a ladder can be compensated for by strengthening or thickening the material around the hole.  That the hole is there at all is the main source of weakness, but it is one that can be managed by the design teams.  The only way to avoid that particular type of weakness is to make every room a self-sufficient sealed box and just use site to site transporters to get everywhere.  Barring that, there's going to be holes everywhere for power conduits, network conduits, environmental systems, etc.  But these are all known problems that can be carefully compensated for.  Quite frankly, the exploding consoles are a much bigger hazard than adding stairways would.  tl;dr Jeffries tubes are a bad idea.  Stairways save time which is the most vital asset in an emergency."
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,xilope,2,Wed Jul 8 16:03:59 2015 UTC,"This would be valid if one of OPs key points wasn't that ladders would be superior in facilitating civilian movements throughout the ship and that they would be a valuable addition to the ship in addition to maintenance tunnels. They are absolutely not.   If the suggestion was that naval-style steep staircases would be a useful replacement for ladders, then perhaps. But please, proponents of stairways, pick a design goal and stick with it. Are we talking broad, grand staircase designs that allow a large population throughput and a horizontal cross-section the size of a cargo bay with emergency bulkheads at either end to prevent all the atmosphere from getting sucked out of the ship, or are we talking small hatches to make going between levels in emergencies slightly faster?  People die playing Paresis Squares when they are prepared and wearing safety equipment. Now you want to install a room full of sharp corners on a ship that routinely gets eaten by anomalies?  Consoles are presumably explosive for a reason, although I have no idea what that reason is. But just because something is dangerous doesn't mean that other things aren't. It's needless and pointless danger that makes adding staircases to the turbolift system and the jeffries tube system such a horrible idea. You might as well say that because the warp core occasionally gets close to exploding, it's fine to use saran wrap instead of transparent aluminum on the windows because the decrease in mass adds up to more maneuverability. While technically true, it's patently absurd to implement.  Again, if the contention were that instead of ladders in the jeffries tubes, they should use a system that is slightly harder to fall down, sure, I agree. But the jeffries tubes are used when the corridors are impassable or maintenance tasks need to be performed on dangerous equipment which should not be accessible to civilians.   This points to a way more important problem, incidentally. In ""Imaginary Friend"" Clara can just wander into Main Engineering because 'Isabella told her to.'   If you want to get rid of the necessity for jeffries tubes being used to hide dangerous equipment, improve the ability of the crew to restrict unauthorized entry to key areas. Like, maybe, using the commbadges that everyone authorized already wears when on duty. Now there's no need to make people crawl around, which is far more time-consuming than climbing a ladder. Of course, you still have the problem where full-sized hallways are much more likely to be empty of atmosphere during a disaster, by sheer virtue of their surface area, than smaller maintenance hatches which default to closed atmospheric pods.  TL;DR: Emergency stairs could replace emergency ladders. Install civilian staircases and everyone will crack their skulls open and die when the Problem of the Week happens. Pick a design goal and stick with it, because things designed to solve every problem wind up solving no problems and creating ten more problems.   TL;DR the TL;DR: Look up Feature Creep and despair."

DaystromInstitute,3cg889,Detrinex,3,Tue Jul 7 20:03:53 2015 UTC,"It's not that we don't see them, its that we see them taking action that implies, strongly, that there is no stair option.  We've seen bathrooms on most Star Trek shows when crew are showering or taking a bath, they just don't show the toilet itself, but it at least gets implied. There's even a scene in ENT where Hoshi rushes to the restroom to vomit (ENT ""Observer Effect"") implying there was a toilet in there.  When they constantly have to use ladders inside the Jefferies Tubes to get around once Turbolifts are offline, that strongly implies they have no other option. I even linked a scene from ST Generations in another comment where Geordi evacuates civilians via a Laddered Jefferies Tube. Why would he do that if there was a staircase anywhere else?"

DaystromInstitute,3cg889,feor1300,3,Tue Jul 7 18:04:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know about stairs, but this got me thinking about the jeffries tubes.  Wouldn't it make more sense to just shut off the grav plating in the tubes so you could effortlessly glide up the ladders and through the tunnels?  I would think that each section of the tubes (between the hatches) would be able to have gravity turned back on so you can more easily perform maintenance in that section."
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,cbnyc0,3,Tue Jul 7 21:00:30 2015 UTC,"I think artificial gravity is related to inertial dampening, so turning it off would be a major safety issue."

I don't think the gravity is generated by inertial dampeners, but I could see how inertial dampening is dependent on the occupants being under the effects of gravity in order to function properly.  However, I do know for sure the NX-01 definitely doesn't have inertial dampeners used to generate gravity, because there was an episode (don't remember which one) where they took some damage and someone reported ""Grav plating on C deck is down""  Maybe the newer ships don't use grav plating, and instead have their gravity generated by the inertial dampeners? I'm not sure, but you make a good point."
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,Voyager5555,2,Tue Jul 7 22:13:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Archer's Enterprise had a general gravity field. There is an episode where the helmsman has gone to the ""sweet spot"" near the bottom of the hull. This did not seem to be the case for 1701-D or Voyager though."

From a production point of view it may have been slightly cheaper to have a ladder instead of a staircase, and from an entertainment point of view it certainly adds dramatic effect, people scrambling through tight enclosed spaces is much more exciting than running up some stairs.   I think it's a case of they probably did have stairs, especially on the Enterprise D in the more 'civilian-y' areas of the ships, but didn't show them on the show."
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,plasmafire,3,Tue Jul 7 21:10:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, not just with points you made in your OP, but also in the comments.   One spot that always bugged me, was in Engineering on Voyager. They showed Torres using a little lift a lot to get to the second level.   But then there's the episode ""Shattered"" where various parts of the ship are in different time frames except for Chakotay himself. In Engineering it's when the Kazon and Seska had taken over the ship. Chakotay gets away by climbing up a ladder to the upper section and crossing into another time frame.   Instead of that ladder, I always figured a staircase would be infinitely better. Have a repair to do on that second level but the lift is down or it's an emergency? And you gotta take tools/phasers/phaser rifles with you? Apparently you gotta hold onto that stuff and climb up a ladder!   Why not have a regular stair case in that spot?? I really do feel like Tuvok would say it would be logical to have a set of stairs instead of a ladder."

OR  run a flight of stairs up the spars. it'd be a little steep, but no worse than the naval ship stairs OP posted a picture of and, as you said, grav plates are a hell of a thing, set gravity in the stairwell to 75% Earth normal (or hell 50%) and it'd be a relatively easy climb for just about anybody."

DaystromInstitute,3cg889,cbnyc0,2,Tue Jul 7 22:02:04 2015 UTC,"Something I haven't seen mentioned here is that, first and foremost, these are military ships: not everyone is going to have access to every deck, and area of the ship.   The family members and civilians on board, are more than likely restricted to just a handful of areas on the ship: Quarters & schools, the Arboretum, Ten Forward, the Holodeck, and so on. I'm sure there are restrictions on Star Fleet personnel also, as there are almost certainly areas of the ship that would be restricted to on-duty personnel only (e.g. Main Engineering, the Bridge, etc.). This would all cut down on the demand for turbolifts throughout the ship."
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,gelftheelf,2,Tue Jul 7 22:26:28 2015 UTC,"Starships do have stairs (or, ladders to be more precise). Vertical movement can be effected by use of these shafts (pictured many many times on screen). The horizontal part is more complicated, I suspect the only reason people are crawling along Jefferies tubes is because corridors have somehow become blocked, impeding horizontal movement across the vessel."

DaystromInstitute,3cg889,Volsunga,2,Wed Jul 8 02:17:16 2015 UTC,"In the Voyager episode ""Twisted,"" we have this exchange with the crew stuck in the holodeck:   TORRES: If we can't get back on foot or on the turbolift, maybe we can rig a site to site transport. Beam ourselves to the bridge.  CHAKOTAY: We'd have to get to a transporter room first.  TORRES: Or to Engineering, wherever that is.  PARIS: When we tried to go to the bridge, one of the places the turbolift took us was Engineering. Maybe if we repeated our steps, it'll take us back there.  JANEWAY: It's worth a shot. Lieutenant Paris, you're with Torres.  KIM: Maybe we can get to the bridge through a Jefferies tube. If I remember my ship specs correctly, there should be an emergency access conduit which leads directly from this deck to deck one right behind the bridge.  CHAKOTAY: I'd like to keep trying to get to the Bridge on foot. If the ship has been reconfigured somehow, I can get a deck by deck picture of what it looks like as I go.   Now, with my reading, it would seem that the crew is offering three different methods of accessing the bridge. Paris and Torres are going to try the turbolifts, Kim wants to try a Jefferies tube, and Chakotay wants to go ""on foot."" It would seem ""on foot"" is not the same as the Jefferies tubes, so there must be stairs or something.  When we see the crew stuck on the bridge due to the turbolift malfunctioning, it would seem that either the doors leading to the stairway are also sealed either through emergency bulkheads or forcefields. It could also be possible that on the Enterprise-D, there is no direct stairway to the bridge due to the presence of civilians and the sensitive nature of the bridge, but there are stairways one deck down."

Making them have to go another route would to get around the stairs would be silly.  As we know that Starfleet seems to have ships which are species neutral, it would make some sense that there would not be stairwells.  Imagine a ship staffed of a large amount of low gravity humanoids, the stairs would be a hazard versus a sloped ramp.  In the case of a high gravity species, the ramps would become dangerous to anyone who was not used to the high gravity."

DaystromInstitute,3cg889,BigTaker,2,Tue Jul 7 19:29:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, but when power fails and they lose turbolifts they usually lose transporters as well. TNG ""Disaster"" is a good example.  My OP was all about how the ladders are not a good option for a Star Ship design and that stairs would be more practical."
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,BigTaker,3,Tue Jul 7 19:44:47 2015 UTC,"But if they lose power, don't they also lose life support (aka gravity)? If that's the case then stairs are effectively less helpful than ladders. Unless I'm missing something about the gravity systems.  The only time having stairs makes sense is if the turbolifts are all down at once while main power and gravity are still on. Which seems like an edge case."
DaystromInstitute,3cg889,unquietmammal,2,Tue Jul 7 20:56:27 2015 UTC,"They lose power and life support without losing gravity all the time. I actually think they dont lose gravity enough in the shows to be honest. I would imagine that system would draw a huge amount of power and yet, (obviously for practical filming) they never actually seem to have an issue with gravity during power outages."

His name is among the most recognised in the Federation. He earned an impressive list of commendations during his career. Historians called him the greatest explorer of the twenty second century. Two planets were named after him."
DaystromInstitute,3cgzgk,Darth_Rasputin32898,12,Tue Jul 7 21:19:02 2015 UTC,"This is the man who almost by himself assisted in the foundation of the UFP.   The entire point of Enterprise was that they were telling the story of the Father of the Federation, but because Enterprise was cancelled before the Romulan War broke out we never got to see the middle of Archer's story, so it got a little muddled. (Well, that and the fact that they got distracted by the awful ""temporal cold war"" storyline.)  Had the Romulan War arc played out as Coto intended it to, this parallel with George Washington would have been painfully obvious. In beta canon Archer was instrumental to the Romulan defeat. He then used the political capital he earned from that victory to found the Federation.  So to answer your question, Picard & co. would feel about Archer the same way that your average American feels about George Washington today. It doesn't line up perfectly—Washington was the supreme commander of the Continental Army, but Archer was just a captain during his nation's defining war. Also, Archer wasn't the first UFP president but rather the third or fourth. But it's certainly close enough for government work."
DaystromInstitute,3cgzgk,kraetos,14,Tue Jul 7 23:18:45 2015 UTC,"That's also a pretty nice parallel because Washington, while clearly deserving of his place in history, had a pretty well documented history of making bad decisions in his early years as an officer. I think a big part of why some people dislike Archer so much is that most of what we see is the earlier part of his story, where limited experience leads to some pretty bad decisions which he never has the chance to balance out.   If every source we had about George Washington cut off a couple of years into the revolutionary war and all we had to judge him by was a glowing half-paragraph and the existence of the United States, his legacy would likely be quite controversial, closer to someone like Ulysses S Grant than the giant we remember him as today."

I don't believe the matter stream interacts with things like Radiation as if it weren't a beam of energy.  For example, the patterns for Sisko, Dax, O'Brien, Worf, and Kira were stored in Deep Space Nine's computer systems during an accident.  Does that mean there were literal subatomic particles stored in the computer system, or just the data representing their quantum pattern?"

I think the limit is like 90 seconds before pattern degradation is to great to bring the person back.  The big problem is going to be not enough buffer space for the crew.  A normal pad has a pattern buffer that can hold 6 people.  There are not enough pads/buffers to get the whole crew beamed in in time and a place to hold the patterns when they are.  Even with emergency transporters tied in I don't think it would be enough.  Then again, Voyager did seem to have infinity shuttles. So they could use all the shuttle transporters for pads/buffers.  So, yeah I guess it would work :)"

In ""Relics"" we see that you have a 50/50 shot of surviving long term in transporter stasis.  So the real question could be: Why didn't Starfleet use Geodesic Folds to send equipment to Voyager.  Like single use platforms similar to the device used in ""Voyager Conspiracy""?  Set it up so Voyager is set on a course following red giant stars every so often.    Starfleet could send additional shuttlecraft, could work on and perfect quantum slipstream, improved warp core designs, replacement quantum torpedoes, etc."

It was just one of those stories passed from generation to generation within a family.  I think they chose the name ""Enterprise"" for the ship, since that would give a good, in-universe explanation for why future ships named ""Enterprise"" are the ""flagship"" of the Federation. It was Starfleet's first ""deep-space"" (in context of the 2150s) exploration ship. The funny part is that, in-universe, the name was inspired by past ships named Enterprise, including the OV-101 Space Shuttle prototype. IRL, the OV-101 was originally going to be named the ""Constellation"" but after a letter-writing campaign by Star Trek fans, they opted for ""Enterprise""... Minor pre-destination paradox of sorts ;)  As for characters? They pretty much had to make everyone up. I think earlier shows shied away from tiny details like ""Who captained the first deep-space mission?"" so they wouldn't accidentally contradict each other (which they often did when getting into, what seemed at the time, minor details). Most of the time when they would do this it was regarding first mission to Saturn or a lost mission to Mars. Something relatively small in comparison to ""the guy who basically made the Federation happen""."
DaystromInstitute,3cfse1,jerslan,6,Tue Jul 7 16:53:13 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of a throwaway quote of Kirk's in TOS Squire of Gothos about Earth's 18th and 19th centuries being 900 years in the past. This was before Kirk's era would be reconned as only about 300-400 years after.  For a long time, there were only fan theories about what year C.E. a given episode occurred in, TOS or TNG. Then the  Star Trek Chronology came out and Encyclopedia were written, which beta-canonized the most well-supported timeline that could be constructed from all the throwaway comments of Trek's fictional history that appeared on screen. We can take it mostly for granted now that TOS and ST1-6 (and 11+) happens in the 2260s and onward (plus flashbacks to Kirk's birth and alternate childhood), TNG-DS9-VOY and ST7-10 happens around the 2360s-2370s (plus Cochrane's younger days), and that ENT takes place in the 2150s, but it wasn't always so.  Star Trek: Online can only know what year they are in, based on all that past work."
DaystromInstitute,3cfse1,aqua_zesty_man,7,Tue Jul 7 20:09:14 2015 UTC,"Exactly, in the 1960s nobody in Hollywood really cared that much about Continuity or Canon beyond the basics of the show (It's set on a ship, named Enterprise with Captain Kirk, his half-Vulcan science officer, and a multi-racial crew. They're exploring space.). Once those were taken care of there wasn't any real in-depth script editing.

Really, naming the ship Enterprise was wholly unnecessary, when considerably more hours of television at that point had occurred aboard ships not named Enterprise than otherwise. Given that they eventually implied them were naming the whole class after the Shuttles, could we have perhaps included bit of the Russian space race? ""The Earth Starship Soyuz?""  I mean, I know the answer is ""of course not, you pinko."" But still. One can dream.  Back to the likes of the Horizon- not that I'm really a big fan of dredging up bits of archaic canon-clutter- as you say, that's usually a recipe for disaster. But those stories at least would fix one of Enterprise's big flaws- the pretty wholesale cultural stasis with the TNG era. If the early Starfleet was explicitly interventionist, making an effort to save every planet they passed in a perceived replication of the kind of salvation they felt the Vulcans had delivered to them far too late, we'd get an opportunity both for different kinds of moral successes, and failures that would contextualize the latter-day aversion to interference held as a largely unalloyed good by the likes of Picard."

Most officers in the modern Navy know the man and his history, but that doesn't mean you're going to hear about him, or see a replica of his ships, or anything like that on a modern USN vessel thesedays (and that was only 75 years ago or so...)

DaystromInstitute,3cf676,FarmerGiles_,25,Tue Jul 7 13:00:36 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that Soong's true talent is creating emergent robotic intelligence. In other words creating something that can be greater than the sum of its parts, and eventually grows to reach its true properties without his actual involvement. It's clear at least that just because an android has a Soong-designed positronic net does not mean it is automatically at the same heights of Lore and Data. B-4, for example, is nowhere near the level of his ""brothers"" or Juliana Tainer. His physical architecture, components, etc are identical to them. But for whatever reason, he didn't ""click"" like Lore and Data did. There are also other, unnamed androids that Soong built before his big successes in Lore and Data. Since these unnamed androids are never seen or mentioned in any detail that I know of, we can assume they also weren't successes. They plausibly might not have even reached B-4's level, and never even managed to achieve sapience or sentience. And those were just the fully formed androids he built. He might have gone through dozens or hundreds or even thousands of isolated positronic net attempts before he figured out the variables that gave him the highest chance of success. He might not even exactly know what those variables are or how they interact, but his vague intuition is still light-years beyond everyone else in his field.   This doesn't take away from Soong's genius since nobody else seems able to even recreate the positronic net in the first place, not even Data himself. But it's clear there is definitely some guesswork involved in his process and he doesn't know what exactly makes one android/positronic net a success and another a failure. If he did, it would have been as simple as writing down and following the same formula and creating an endless line of Data-caliber successes."
DaystromInstitute,3cf676,funkymustafa,11,Tue Jul 7 14:14:24 2015 UTC,I always thought that Lore being the first Soong great success and his subsequent fall caused Soong to trash all his notes and documentation in dismay. When he finally went back to work and eventually created Data he didn't have time to document him fully before Lore conspired with the Crystalline Entity to ravage Omicron Theta.
DaystromInstitute,3cf676,AHrubik,11,Tue Jul 7 15:27:46 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that Data's failure with Lal could be attributed to him transferring his own positronic net to her.  Data's hubris and impatience directly caused her fatal cascade, because he wasn't willing to wait and let her neural net develop naturally.  It's great that you brought up Juliana Tainer.  It seems that she would be Soong's crowning achievement.  A full life replica of a human being, who actually believes she is human.  We can't say that she's an exact copy, as we don't have any basis for comparison, but is close enough to become resentful and leave him.  I think Soong's genius is quantifiable, simply because he reproduced it.  There are/were three Data-type androids in existence, and another true-life replica running around.  There were more, according to Lore, Tainer and the logs recovered on Omicron Theta.  People haven't reproduced it because they haven't discovered his methods for creating a stable artificial neural net, essentially a computer which can rewire, enhance and reprogram itself.  If I remember correctly, this is what Maddox wanted to study and try to reproduce."
DaystromInstitute,3cf676,dr_harshaw,5,Tue Jul 7 17:27:49 2015 UTC,"It could have been due to a fabrication process having very high error rates. When we build integrated circuit chips, there's a percentage of them that have to be tossed out due to imperfections in the medium that causes the chip not to function. The error ratio is usually around 5% to 25%. I think the same would occur with the fabrication of the positronic brain, because it's functioning at a quantum, sub-atomic level where any imperfection causes a very high signal to noise ratio.  Get anything even slightly wrong then a 90% error rate becomes a 100% error rate."

B4 and Lore should rightfully be considered failures, due to B4's simplicity and Lore's instability. Data is ""successful"" but incomplete. The height of his achievement would be Juliana Tainer, who was both stable and emotive.  So, somehow, Soong discovered a way to lay down complex and stable neural pathways, or at least initiate a process that resulted in construction (or growth) of complex, stable neural pathways."

Data describes his processing speed to be 60 trillion operations per second, and his storage capacity to be 80 quadrillion bytes; numbers that were achievable even in the ancient days of computing (circa 21st century).  So, it isn't raw power that makes Data so unique.  Maybe something about the architecture of the PNN?"

The PNN is the ""magic""  that makes him and the other Soong-types special.   I would argue however that Data was not Soong's masterwork.  His masterwork  was his recreation of Juiliana Tainer, his wife. A ""perfect""  android who believed it was human and programed to die.  Could this be the difference between ""android and ""replicant""?"

If I recall correctly, she even ""passes"" a cursory medical exam and, by every measure, she is more human than Data.    However, since the Tainer android is ultimately deceived about her true nature, and the inevitable revelation of it destroys her, that leaves Data as the only Soong android who is able to reach, ""full potential,"" and operate stably."

DaystromInstitute,3cf676,mkalvas,4,Tue Jul 7 16:03:34 2015 UTC,"""Traumatizing""  is an interesting way of putting it because it doesn't describe Data nor do I think it describes Lal's death itself.  Data creating artificial life,  a new being,  was traumatizing for the humans around him.  That's likely why he never tried again, to spare them the emotional burden of another potential failure and to keep Starfleet off his back.   Probably the very same challenges Noonian faced.  It forced him out onto a remote colony and eventually to an uninhabited planet."
DaystromInstitute,3cf676,mkalvas,7,Tue Jul 7 19:28:13 2015 UTC,"Well, to begin with, real world neural network computer science is incredibly complex. It's possible that Soong just loved this topic, had a savant like aptitude for understanding it, and really just dedicated his life to research that pushed him far ahead of others in the field.  Second, we would have to know the demand for such technology. We could estimate it based on our knowledge of the Star Trek universe but we would always be an outsider. If there's no demand for androids, then the best and brightest wouldn't necessarily be researching android neural networks and comparing him to those people wouldn't make sense.  Another question you'd have to take into  account is whether or not he really is better than most people in the galaxy concerning android tech. Take for instance the Foundation universe (we are, after all, talking about robotics, so who better to consult than the father of robotics) or Battlestar Galactica where the natural evolution of AI and androids are to become indistinguishable from humans. Perhaps there are whole societies of AI's that choose to remain unknown due to a possibility of persecution of some sort.   Even Data, Soong's own masterwork, was unsuccessful in his attempt to replicate the signature, ""Positronic net,"" brain structure of Soong androids.   I want to get into this a little bit but my opinion on the matter is a bit ""Hofstadterianly meta"" so bear with me for a second. The subject in question is whether or not Data being able to reproduce Soong's work is a good metric because of his ability to have complete and consistent logical systems and his inability to escape your own logical existence. Take for instance Data. He can never say ""Data is speaking falsely"" and be logically consistent with the ""external reality"". If he says that sentence, he is either false because he is speaking the truth, which would be false again ad infinitum or the reverse. I however, being ""outside"" of his logical reality can say easily ""Data is speaking falsely"" and be objectively consistent with the ""external reality"". Data could allow for such inconsistency and make some sort of personal logical system that makes it so that he can never have an instance of incomplete knowledge like the one described but then he would necessarily lose the ability to be consistent. What does this all mean though? Simply that Data might not ever be able to replicate all the intricacies of his own physical and logical existence no matter how smart he was.  TL;DR Bottom line is that we would need some ""exterior"" expert in the same field as Soong to come and evaluate Soong's work to measure the level of ""brilliance"".  P.S. The subjects of computability vs incomputability and knowable things, knowably unknowable things, and unknowably unknowable things (a.k.a. recursive sets, recursively enumerable sets, co-recursively enumerable sets, and neither recursively enumerable nor co-recursively enumerable sets) are amazingly interesting. If you want to learn more, look at Gary Flake's: The Computational Beauty of Nature or Douglas Hofstadter's: Gödel, Escher, Bach. Or pick up some Asimov if you're in the mood for robotics specifically."
DaystromInstitute,3cf676,bakhesh,2,Tue Jul 7 15:06:53 2015 UTC,"Very interesting analysis, I think that Data's logic system must have some capacity for reconciling logical inconsistencies.  Perhaps his logical schema allows for some fuzziness; though how that works in a computational system that needs ""pure"" logical consistency is unclear.        Still, I wouldn't count Data out as the likely top contender for recreating the ""Soong miracle.""  Data would be able to use his own, internal schematics, with a level of familiarity and understanding no exterior expert could hope to obtain.  Even in the event of a full teardown, as is suggested in Measure of a Man, Data would still be the only sentient creature around with years worth of real time, operational data about his internal systems.    I do find the concept of computability interesting.  Thanks for the recommendations."

It might not have been made of matter, but Lewis  Zimmerman's hologram was more advanced in every way. It has much the same abilities in terms of data storage and retrieval. It could also simulates genuine emotions, meaning not only could it interact with humans in a much more realistic way, it could actually learn how to enjoy things for itself.  Over it's years of service in Starfleet, the only improvements we saw in the Data model was that it learned to emulate humans more effectively. It still struggled with basic human concepts, and couldn't even emulate human speech correctly. Once it was upgraded with the emotion chip, the shock nearly rendered it useless, and eventually the chip had to be switched off so it could continue it's duties. The EMH became a complete sentient lifeform, just because it was left switched on for a while  The only advantage the Data model has over the EMH is it is self contained and needs no external power, but even those advantages are wiped out by the mobile emitter."

As someone who's gone through that, it can make sense you wouldn't want your child to have the same experiences. B’Elanna faced racial bullying and exclusion for being half Klingon, so it makes sense she would want her kid to look human because she has internalized hatred for her mother's species. All that being said, I don't think it's ethical to change a baby like that. The real issue is society and it''s biases, not an issue with the kid. I think changing the child would imply being partially Klingon is a bad thing, which isn't right. The whole thing is rather sad- can you imagine hating yourself so much you'd be willing to go to these lengths? This issue reminds me of the whole ""Designer babies"" thing.

DaystromInstitute,3cg7ie,JesusofBorg,6,Wed Jul 8 01:02:57 2015 UTC,"No, she didn't. B'Elanna only faced those things because of her own actions.  B'Elanna hates the fact that she's a Human-Klingon hybrid. She witnessed first hand how the Klingon Nature can destroy good things for no reason (her family ending up in pieces because of the friction between her parents). Even as a little kid she could clearly see that the differences between her parents were causing problems, but she didn't understand the nature of those problems. All she saw was her parents fighting and eventually breaking up because one was Human and the other was Klingon, and she blames the Klingon side of the equation for this. We even get a glimpse of this when she learns that her mother is in Gre'thor. Her initial reaction is ""So fucking what?"". She blames her Mother's Klingon nature, and her own Klingon side, for everything bad that's happened in her life.  The simple fact of the matter is that B'Elanna's self-hatred for her hybrid nature is directly responsible for pretty much all the ""torment"" she believes she experienced, up to and including her father leaving. During the flashbacks we see in Lineage we are directly shown that every instance of ""torment"" wasn't torment, but was B'elanna projecting her own self-hatred onto others.  ""The other kids play a harmless joke on me? IT'S BECAUSE I'M HALF KLINGON AND THEY HATE ME!""  ""My Dad's trying to bond with me but I refuse to open up and explain literally anything that's going on inside my head? IT'S BECAUSE I'M HALF KLINGON AND HE HATES ME!""  ""My parents have issues and my Dad leaves forever? IT'S BECAUSE WE'RE KLINGON AND HE HATES US!""  The only torment she suffered was self inflicted. B'Elanna constantly pushed everybody away because she hated herself and projected that hatred onto everybody else. She never gave anybody a second chance. She never admitted that maybe she was wrong to perceive things the way she did. It was always ""IT'S BECAUSE I'M HALF KLINGON AND <insert name here> HATES ME!"". She even carried that with her into Starfleet Academy with her constant excuse of ""My Klingon temper gets me into a lot of trouble"".  So yes, the Doctor was 100% morally, ethically, and legally in the right. B'elanna has some serious self loathing issues to work on with a therapist. Allowing her to make sweeping genetic changes to her unborn child based solely on those issues would be admitting that she is indeed correct in thinking that everybody hates her because she's half Klingon.   When you consider her status amongst the Voyager crew, and the fact that literally everybody on the ship, including Seven of Nine, gave her leeway to lash out at times instead of immediately jumping on her back for it, it's pretty obvious that nobody hates B'Elanna because of her hybrid nature except for herself. If anything, they value her in spite of her self loathing because they know that she's a good person regardless. The problem is B'Elanna refuses to admit it to herself."
DaystromInstitute,3cg7ie,CycoPenguin,3,Wed Jul 8 01:51:20 2015 UTC,"You both make some really amazing points. I can sympathize with B'Elanna feeling picked on because of who and what she is. I understand the desire change yourself (or others) to be more 'normal'.  At the same time,  There is a lot of evidence to show for B'Elanna bringing some of others feelings and actions, on her self, by her own actions and outburst. But the reason I Agree with the doctor is not only because of him doing what's right by the law; but he did what's right by his own morals and conscience. He didn't disagree with B'Elanna's reasoning, and empathized with her even. But in the end, morals are about doing what is right by your own standards and ethics. This is why I agree with what the Doctor did. He wouldn't have made those changes for anyone else, and he didn't do it for her. That's respectable."

Take Jean Luc Picard's baldness:   In an interview with Michael Parkinson, [Patrick Stewart] expressed gratitude for Gene Roddenberry's riposte to a reporter who said, ""Surely they would have cured baldness by the 24th century,"" to which Roddenberry replied, ""In the 24th century, they wouldn't care."""

It seams like something we should be able to do... I mean, replicators are just the back half of a transporter..."
DaystromInstitute,3cdtz6,OverwatchHusky,9,Tue Jul 7 04:02:12 2015 UTC,Yeah but replicators deal with way less information.  They are only molecular resolution vs a living things quantum resolution.  It took something like the whole computer core on DS9 to hold Bashir's pattern in an emergency (I forget what it was).  So complex analysis on individual patterns seems prohibitive.  I think the only reason biofilters get around that is they are looking for known bad signatures of very small organisms/viruses.
DaystromInstitute,3cdtz6,mistakenotmy,7,Tue Jul 7 04:15:17 2015 UTC,"To clarify; when you say molecular resolution vs quantum resolution in terms of information, do you mean something similar to comparing a photograph to a moving image?   Because I agree! Lt. Barclay's experience in the transporter indicates that some level of active consciousness is maintained while in transport, which would necessitate much more data retention in the pattern buffers than simply taking a snapshot of Lt. Barclay before transport, and then recreating that snapshot after transport.   I just saw the episode you're thinking about last week! Bashir is the main character in the episode, with Garak as back up. Bashir is in the holosuite playing through a fantasy of being James Bond, and Garak intrudes interrupting Bashir's good time. The commanding crew has an accident and ends up being stuck in the transporter (admittedly, I was playing a video game and I am fuzzy as to why), so their patterns end up taking up the entire station's computers so as to retain integrity. In the holo-program Sisko ends up the villain, Worf as a substitute for Oddjob, etc.  As to the nature of the biofilters, if they're processing against the inclusion of negative organisms/viruses/etc then they must be cross-referencing against some predetermined standard. The simplest idea is that the computer references the first pattern vs the newest pattern, and extrapolates based on that information what is ""good"" and ""bad"", with the inclusion of some more basic information (humans who visit Vulcan might need to be filtered for ""Vulcan-flu"" for a silly example). The biofilters must take into account, say, muscle toxins from a lowly ensign toiling away on some M-class planet, notice the change in physiology and extrapolate that the change in bio-signature is within its limits of acceptability for an organism of the ensigns' species.   Otherwise, every pathogen the Federation encounters would have to be painstakingly entered into the biolfilters. If this is the case, throughout EVERY Trek show/movie we've seen, the away team should be insane with fear over contracting some disease/parasite/virus that has never been encountered before, and accidentally spreading it to other planets and wiping out entire species. Since they're not, we (i.e. specifically in my own head) should assume that the computer is programmed to notice such egregious changes in physiology, and filter them out during transport.  In a way, this speaks against the idea that the transporter is death (though not in a very convincing way) as we've seen that to maintain the pattern of a living being takes up enormous amounts of computational space. The entire molecular pattern of an apple is incredibly complex, and yet the computers of tomorrow hold entire planet's worth of gourmet items in the computer banks, ready to be created on demand. And that's just food. Then there's equipment, tools, construction materials, etc. These things are easy for the replicator system. Keeping a living person suspended as energy is orders of magnitude more complex, so there must be a reason, and in my head the reason is that the transporter is maintaining the biological systems' integrity as a biological system whilst converting the same system into an analogous energy state.   This explains to me why the crew of that ship Barclay rescues due to his fear of the transporter are able to exist as organism in the matter stream until he pulls them out!  (I had to do a quick edit as I hit post too soon! Thanks)"
DaystromInstitute,3cdtz6,deadieraccoon,3,Tue Jul 7 05:37:11 2015 UTC,"Just to clarify about molecular vs. quantum resolution, think of the order of magnitude increase from a still image to a moving image in three dimensions plus vectors for ever fundamental particle. Of course they hand-wave that wrinkle away with the Heisenberg compensators and move on with the show."
DaystromInstitute,3cdtz6,spillwaybrain,2,Tue Jul 7 11:53:30 2015 UTC,"If the transporter is comparing the persons first pattern against their last pattern to filter out microbes etc, it must be holding the entire first pattern of every person it has transported until they come back. And it would have no way to filter organisms from individuals it had never transported before. Therefore it must have some way of identifying alien microbes, rather than just doing a before/after comparison. A database or microbes/viruses to exclude isn't strictly necessary, though could be useful as a first sweep. Anything else could be identified trivially by finding genetic material (DNA, RNA, AlienNA) and removing any that doesn't clearly belong to the majority, which is assumed to be the host, or the list of harmless, or even helpful, normal microbes. So dirt, broken bones, newly formed memories, and the disease state itself are all transported, but the mechanism of disease replication is not, unless it relies on some totally novel non-DNA/RNA/ANA method of reproducing. Added bonus: computer adds the identified new DNA to its database to be studied and potentially filtered out in the first pass next time if it's found to be truly dangerous."
DaystromInstitute,3cdtz6,stingray85,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:10:31 2015 UTC,"But how does it differentiate between necessary gut bacteria for example, and pathogenic bacteria? I don't know enough about gut bacteria, so is there enough of a genetic marker in the bacteria for the transporter to assume its healthy? And what about symbiotic organisms? How can it tell the difference between a parasite and a symbiot?  And didn't they restore Polaski to youth and health using an old pattern? So its implied that the pattern is stored for some period after transport. But likely more of a snapshot vs. a moving image type of patter."
DaystromInstitute,3cdtz6,deadieraccoon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:19:21 2015 UTC,"it must be holding the entire first pattern of every person it has transported until they come back.    Or the transporter compares hashes of what's in the buffer against hashes of known species' DNA, and alerts to anything that's identified as bad or unrecognised. Heuristics would be more accurate than bit by bit comparison anyway since somatic DNA and microbiome DNA can legitimately change between transports."

DaystromInstitute,3cdtz6,BloodBride,3,Tue Jul 7 11:31:00 2015 UTC,"In Rascals, they simply load information into the pattern buffer to re-materialise the youth-afflicted crewman into their adult selves. In Unnatural Selection, they find a strand of Doctor Pulaski's hair, use that to get her DNA, then use that to modify her transporter pattern in the buffer to de-age her to a previous state. In both instances, their brains were not effected - While their physical state was changed, their mental state was 'up to date' so to speak - they were not simply 'backed up' to the earlier transported state. As such, people who are routinely transported could in theory have their pattern at the time they left the ship kept in a kind of memory, then when they come back, they could be beamed using that pattern - while neurological and psychological issues would remain, any physical injury or infection would not. They'd also not have aged by the time they were off-ship, which over time would add up, extending the life of crewmembers. Come to think of it, they could also use it to undo aging just by keeping an old transporter pattern on file like a backup. ""Yeah, I dislike how the aging I've experienced the past two years has effected me, let's go back to the younger me."" Of course in all instances, we never refer to this technology ever again.

I guess the subspace whatsit is the only thing that allowed them to turn into kids in the first place, though. Otherwise you'd have to imagine there would be a lot of people clamoring for the secret of eternal youth.  Yeah, yeah, I know -- per early-season TNG nobody fears death or growing old, but I don't buy that crap for a second. Picard might not want to be 12 again, but what about if you told Worf he had a chance to go back to being a child and be raised as a Klingon this time out? I bet he'd at least think about it.  There's also the events of ""Lonely Among Us,"" when Data is able to recompile Picard's body from the stored pattern database or whatever.

It was vaguely medical and took place in sickbay. So I'm sure you could splice together the patterns of a humanoid and a bar of latinum (to great effect). That's a kind of editing...

C: Several times when the Dominion were attempting to lure factions to their sides they would promise total authority of a region as a gift to the interested party. Had they truly defeated all of the Alpha Quadrant forces, the Dominion may very well have left the Alpha Quadrant in the Cardassians hands, to do with as they please so long as they provided material logistic support to the Dominion as a whole.  It is also very likely that Dukat ""knew"" that the Dominion was simply using the Cardassians as a means to an end and would have likely turned on the Cardassians once the rest of the Alpha Quadrant fell. So Dukat may have expected this eventual betrayal and wanted to make his own plan to defend against it.

He constantly underestimated his opponents and I believe this was another example of that.  He probably honestly thought that Cardassia would be powerful enough, specifically under his command to win a direct war. The whole resistance thing set up by Kira, Garak, Odo and Damar showed that Cardies don't quite understand guerrilla warfare so it won't have been that type of fight.  A surprise attack by Cardassia on their big allies in the alpha quadrant would be hugely damaging for the Dominion. Cardassian forces would immediately be in place to strike at shipyards, Vorta commanders, kettracel white production and cloning facilities.

He actually, legitimately believed that the Bajoran people should have thanked him for his tenure as overseer of Terok Nor and the occupation. Why? Because he (allegedly) wasn't as evil as some of his predecessors.  He literally had delusions of grandeur, and likely had no concrete plan settled ahead of time to achieve his goals. The only time he displayed any sort of forward thinking was when under the control of the Pah Wraith. Take a look at his history:   He allows the entire population of DS9 to be essentially kidnapped by a hidden security program with the hopes that somehow he could negotiate (under duress!) restoring a Cardassian presence on the station! He engages in a 1-ship war against the entire Klingon Empire, simultaneously hoping Kira would  join him and ultimately fall in love with him. He sells his own people out to the Dominion. His position as supreme ruler of Cardassia, as well as the initial successes of the Dominion in repelling the Klingons and eliminating the Maquis, feed into his delusional state. Prior to this, he was always checked by the limitations of his abilities. He desired greatness, but could not achieve it. Well, now he achieved it (or at least the Dominion allowed him to achieve it) and there was no turning back. After escaping from Federation custody, he allows himself to be possessed by a Pah Wraith hoping that it somehow results in the death of Sisko. Doesn't really know or understand how or why, he just let a supremely powerful alien organism inhabit his body for the evulz. He set up his own Pah Wraith cult and when he couldn't keep his Cardassian snake in his pants, decided to kill them all like a Sim City save he was bored with.   These are not the actions of a person that thinks ahead. All he has is a vague idea of the end state he desires (a supreme greatness that is recognized by all those around him) but no conception or idea of how to get there."
DaystromInstitute,3cc6oh,drafterman,7,Tue Jul 7 12:07:26 2015 UTC,"Edit: So others have jumped in with the gist of the first part of my comment. (That Dukat thought he could betray the Dominion). So I've re-arranged things.  The long and the short of it is that Dukat knows the Dominion is fighting a war on the other side of the galaxy from their power base, and he hopes to exploit it.  But because Dukat is extremely egotistical it gets worse. Dukat has a savior complex. He whines for most of the show about how unappreciated he is by everyone he has 'helped'. He really thinks that if he can just prove his value to the founders they will reward him. He thinks once they recognize his inherent awesomeness they will give him all the power and recognition he knows he deserves. I think he even thinks Weyoun will recognize his greatness eventually. I mean Dukat thought Kira would fall in love with him and forgive him for murdering millions(?) of her people! Its not much of a stretch to think he can delude himself into thinking a race of beings that hate solids will respect him that one exceptional solid. Or even a member of a race genetically programmed to worship the founders above all else might grudgingly admit he is the worthy of respect. He is just that delusional.     Some thoughts on how he thinks he will betray the Dominion: I always interpreted Dukat as gambling that he could win the war without the 2nd wave of Dominion reinforcements. If he can keep the Dominion out of the alpha quadrant while giving the Federation and Klingons a pretty bloody nose, then he can re-assert Cardassia as a first rate power. Weyoun and the Dominion will have little choice but to stick with the Cardassians since most other powers will not want to make a deal with them or those powers won't be powerful enough to be of use.  He probably figures that the new balance of power will feature Cardassia in place of the Federation as the leading power.   In the early stages of the war it seems that the Cardassians are receiving a lot of upgrades and infrastructure from the Dominion. They do this to earn the trust and loyalty of the Cardassians, and because it is probably faster than building their own equipment. But it also plays into Dukat's plan of eventually doing with out the Dominion.    When it becomes clear they will need the second wave he goes along with it, as his survival and continued position demands he does.  He probably still thinks he can shut out the Dominion eventually.   Note that prior to this Dukat was very cavalier about the minefield. All he cares about is winning the war quickly. It is Weyoun and the female founder that are worried. They want the reinforcements long before they are really needed because they want to quickly overpower Dukat."

It's entirely possible, maybe even likely, that Dukat and whatever other Alpha Quadrant powers that joined the Dominion, would be left as leaders of the Quadrant after the war was over and the bulk of the Dominion forces returned to the Gamma Quadrant.

With that, he could take the female founder hostage and use her as a bargening chip to force the dominion back through the wormhole and then he would either shut it or mine it with the self replicating mines to prevent another invasion and use the combined alpha quadrant resources to create an advanced fleet of warships which he would use to invade the gamma quadrant and annihilate the founders"

He probably (very mistakenly) thought that with the Federation and Klingons out of the picture, he'd somehow be able to either wrest some degree of political autonomy from the Dominion, or (even more mistakenly) be able to fight against the Dominion.  Ultimately Dukat just wanted power. He routinely makes decisions that are very foolish in the long-term for short-term gains. That's why his career goes up and down so much."

There could be an alternative to full membership though, so that Romulan Empire doesn't feel that the Federation is breaking the Treaty of Algeron, an alliance similar to what exists between The Federation and the Klingon Empire.  The Federation and Klingons seem to trade freely, share boarders, allow freedom of movement, share technology and information, but the Klingons aren't members of The Federation."

DaystromInstitute,3caq81,butterhoscotch,47,Wed Jul 8 06:01:50 2015 UTC,"As part of the Federation application process, all perspective member planets are required to sign an agreement, endorsing all currently standing and future political treaties made by the Federation. This includes the Treaty of Algeron.  The issue was never that the Federation didn't know how to make cloaking devices, that the Romulans had this uncrackable technological secret. You're telling me Scotty never had a peek at the Klingon cloaking device during his time aboard HMS Bounty? The fact was that the Federation agreed not to research or incorporate cloaking technology into it's current fleet.  What does this mean for our cloak-friendly perspective member species? Well, they have a choice. If they refuse to sign then it's very likely they won't receive Federation membership. That doesn't mean they can't be considered Federation allies however, and freely trade with Federation member worlds. It depends on whether the benefits they gain from joining the Federation outweigh the benefits they get from cloaking tech. Does it give them some other advantage beyond the purely tactical? Or is it cultural? If the latter, that may prove more difficult to endorse.  I'd also say that it depends on the wording of the Treaty of Algeron; if the treaty stipulates that the Federation cannot equip Starfleet but individual member states can continue to equip cloaks, that might be a different story. The new species could join and continue to use cloaking devices on their personal ships, but would be forbidden to try and lobby Starfleet to equip them. But the impression I got from the times we hear about the Treaty of Algeron was a blanket ban across the entire Federation..."

DaystromInstitute,3caq81,Numlocks,9,Mon Jul 6 14:14:37 2015 UTC,"Their military would likely remain its own entity, as a system-defense force. Whether they, and civilian ships that have cloaks, would be allowed to continue to use them would probably depend on the wording of the treaty, as others have said. They might be restricted to using it within the limit of their system, or from using them at all.  The actual technology behind cloaking devices doesn't seem to be some mysterious secret- Starfleet was capable of building a phase-cloak that even the Romulans hadn't been able to perfect. So a transfer of the technology wouldn't be an issue. Only its actual usage."

DaystromInstitute,3caq81,UTLRev1312,10,Mon Jul 6 19:53:47 2015 UTC,"Strictly speaking, it would depend on the exact wording of the Treaty of Algeron. We've heard that it forbids the Federation from developing cloaking technology, as opposed to simply using it, so it would potentially be a violation to bring in a species that has that technology.  However, from a practical standpoint, I don't think this is really an issue. Information travels, whether you want it to or not. No matter how hard the Federation tries to shut its ears, cloaking technology won't remain a secret forever. Even if the treaty does explicitly state that the Federation cannot possess the knowledge (which isn't too far-fetched, since it was written in a time where cloaking tech was still foreign to the Federation), that part is essentially unenforceable in the long term. I would imagine the Romulans understand that and accept it, as long as the Federation doesn't use cloaks for its ships or other military assets, or try to develop new forms of cloak such as Admiral Preston's phased cloaking generator."
DaystromInstitute,3caq81,Xenics,5,Mon Jul 6 13:52:21 2015 UTC,"Well, arms control treaties don't usually have to do with ""unknowing"" anything. Indeed, part of the point is usually that all those involved are rather well versed with the capabilities of the technology- otherwise they wouldn't need legal stipulations to manage its use. The modern world is full of wealthy industrial states that have the technical base- often including reactors and nuclear fuel cycles- to gin up a nuclear weapon in short order, and it's pretty well acknowledged at this point that the design of such weapons flows pretty directly from the physics. So I don't think there's anything especially odd about the notion that the Fed might just have to say, yeah, just like how we aren't cool with caste systems, we aren't cool with cloaking devices, it's a price you pay to have normalized relationships with the Romulans."
DaystromInstitute,3caq81,queenofmoons,6,Mon Jul 6 16:15:01 2015 UTC,"Assuming all paperwork was filled out in triplicate, the t's crossed and j's dotted, your planet is allowed into the Federation on a probationary status.  Your planets merchants, science vessels and defense militia may continue to utilize stealth technology, but no ships provided to the Federation or on joint deployments will have cloaking devices.[1]  Additionally, any subsidies, scientific funding, or educational grants cannot be utilized for further developing or enhancing cloak technology.  Any violation of the probation relating to cloak technology is grounds for dissolution of your planets membership in the UFP.  Here is why.  The Federation has had cloaking technology since 2268 (The Enterprise Incident). Section 31 isn't going to leave a technology like that alone because of a stupid treaty no one expected to last five years, let alone 100+ years.  We know the Pegasus used it with support from Starfleet Intelligence (probably incubated via Section 31) and it was somewhat successful.  Federation crew members have had access to Klingon style cloaking devices on multiple occasions.  Beyond that, it was used (briefly under Romulan supervision) on the Defiant in the build up to the Dominion War.  Then there were the cloaked mines blockading the worm hole near Bajor.  So lets establish that the Federation already knows cloak technology and has multiple experts.  They actively choose not to use it for reasons that mirror Gene Roddenberry's feelings, ""our heroes don't sneak around""  the good guys don't need to be stealthy.  The majority citizens of the Federation like to think they're the good guys, so they are going to expect that the spirit of the treaty be upheld.  Depending on when this discussion takes place, lets assume 2387 and the Hobus star went super nova causing the destruction of the capital and home world of the Romulan Star Empire.  They are in no position to go to war over a planet with cloak tech joining the Federation.  [1] Cloaked ships are not prohibited from taking part in war games or training simulations with Federation military vessels."
DaystromInstitute,3caq81,Redemptions,4,Mon Jul 6 16:30:31 2015 UTC,"You've already gotten some really good answers so I am going to tackle this from a different angle: I don't think the situation you described ever could happen because the period of time during which the Federation outlawed cloaking wasn't a time period where cloaking technology was widespread enough to be integrated into a culture which wasn't a galactic power so deeply as you are suggesting.  The Treaty of Algeron was ratified in 2311 and I feel it's pretty safe to assume it was nullified, along with any other treaty the Federation had with the Romulan Star Empire, in 2387 following the destruction of Romulus. In the 2395 depicted in the anti-time future, Federation ships had cloaking devices. In the 2409 depicted in Star Trek: Online, players can purchase cloaks for their ships. To wit: the collapse of the Romulan Star Empire spells the end of the Federation cloaking ban.  As for your culture who discovers cloaking, for the timing on this to work they would have discovered cloaking sometime in the 23rd century. In the 23rd century, cloaking is a novelty. Spock is thoroughly impressed by it when he encounters it in 2266. At this point in time the Romulans are the only ones to have invented it, and the Romulans are an advanced galactic power. Any entity technologically advanced enough to invent cloaking in the 23rd century wouldn't be interested in joining the Federation in the 24th century.  I just don't think that cloaking technology is a particularly common technology. The Dominion always had a slight technological edge on the Federation and there was never any indication that they deployed cloaking technology. Most of the other Alpha/Beta regulars don't have it either: the Cardassians don't have it, the Ferengi don't have it, the Breen don't have it. I don't think anyone ""stumbles"" into cloaking technology in the 23rd or 24th centuries. At the point where the basics of cloaking tech are taught in secondary school, we're talking about the 25th century at the earliest, and by then the Treaty of Algeron has been null and void for some time."
DaystromInstitute,3caq81,kraetos,4,Mon Jul 6 19:49:52 2015 UTC,"We are on the fringes of Federation space. In the time of the treaty of Algeron, none of the major factions in the Alpha Quadrant knew of our existence. We were aware of them, but have always been isolationist, so saw no reason to contact them. As we use cloaking tech so much, the Federation had no idea our system was even populated until the Ent-D came to survey our planet for mineral deposits.  Our civilisation is has been around longer than the human, Klingon or Vulcan civilisations."
DaystromInstitute,3caq81,ToastedDoom,2,Mon Jul 6 20:14:01 2015 UTC,"Perhaps a bureaucratic solution applies here. Your ships may be allowed to operate within federation space however your local world government would be required to share the technology with the Federation. In tandem the Federation would be morally and diplomatically obliged to share that technology with it's ToA partners (Klingons, Romulans, etc). By sharing the technology the other governments would surely devise a way to detect the ship through the cloaking device hence rendering the technology useless. This satisfies the treaty stipulations without having to dismantle the cloaking device from your fleet of cloaked ships. This solution would, of course, be a condition towards your entry into the UFP."
DaystromInstitute,3caq81,JViz,2,Mon Jul 6 15:06:14 2015 UTC,The only problem I see with this is that they introduced cloaks in Voyager that were practically undetectable. In this case I would assume that the Federation would want to create a new treaty.

Not that it matters much, as cloaking devices have (repeatedly and) consistently portrayed as fairly useless as a combat device. For espionage, they're great; for combat, they're a liability. At least in terms of any of the tactics the Federation would be likely to employ.

The civilization that built them has no idea how to detect an active one themselves.  You can pretty much do anything while cloaked.  Shields, transporters, weapons.  Yup, you can fire torpedoes while clocked.  In fact, you can fire cloaked torpedoes while cloaked so nobody can infer your firing position or even see the weapons fire coming.    And the civilization who built them wants to join the Federation.  Wouldn't this be a game changer?  Would the Federation maybe just tell the Romulans to fuck off?  No, of course not.  The Federation would obey the treaty to keep the peace.    Is that really the best course of action in the end?  I don't know.

However we have seen first hand that the federation when it tried was very near to creating not just a cloak, but a phase cloak, vastly superior to the romulan and klingon cloaks. If they went to war and really needed it, they could make a cloak.  Hell they could probably buy black market cloaks and reverse engineer them too, or trade the klingons for one.  The only thing preventing them is the treaty, not because the information is so incredibly hard to get.

DaystromInstitute,3cc0zw,Berggeist,5,Mon Jul 6 22:09:15 2015 UTC,"The first reason is the neutronium hull. It's extremely dense and blocks sensor readings, which helps when you want to establish an appropriate tractor link. Neutronium is not a substance the Federation is great at working with, even by the TNG era. Even the carbon-neutronium alloy used in the Dyson Sphere was impervious to phasers. Pure neutronium as on the Planet Killer is going to be even denser. Neutronium is a substance even the Borg have never assimilated knowledge of, in terms of both collection and creation.  The second is the sheer size of the Planet Killer. For a visual reference, this image provides an estimate of 2.7 km long: http://www.st-minutiae.com/academy/engineering102A/aliens_large.png  It's not that it couldn't be moved; it's more that nobody in the area is capable of moving it, at least in my headcanon."
DaystromInstitute,3cc0zw,Emperor_Cartagia,3,Mon Jul 6 23:18:26 2015 UTC,"Neutronium is a substance even the Borg have never assimilated knowledge of, in terms of both collection and creation.   Just to nitpick, while you're technically correct, the Doctor does say that Borg assimilation tubules can penetrate ""any known alloy or forcefield"". So it's a fairly decent bet that they can penetrate Carbon-Neutronium."
DaystromInstitute,3cc0zw,Berggeist,15,Tue Jul 7 00:19:44 2015 UTC,"The Doctor may have said that, but this is a Doctor program that also found itself waiting for Borg to bang through a normal sickbay door with their hands on the Enterprise E. Later in the film when the Borg realize they can just pry doors open, they just jam their fingers in the middle. I also think the Doctor is most likely speaking in terms of non-exotic alloys the Federation can actually make.  Damnit Cartagia, he's a doctor, not a metallurgist."
DaystromInstitute,3cc0zw,Monomorphic,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:54:10 2015 UTC,Neutronium is not an alloy. It is degenerate matter. It is also extremely heavy. A teaspoon can weigh two billion tons.

DaystromInstitute,3cc0zw,mxt920,9,Tue Jul 7 15:56:59 2015 UTC,"In ""Vendetta,"" it is revealed that the planet killer was a prototype of a weapon designed to destroy the borg, that was piloted by Guinan's sister.  It shows up again in the Destiny Trilogy, also in an attempt to fight the Borg.  Of course this is beta canon, and Vendetta was released after season 4 of TNG, so the events of that book don't really mesh with series canon."
DaystromInstitute,3cc0zw,jandrese,9,Mon Jul 6 20:54:28 2015 UTC,Guinan's sister appears to be a terrible navigator if she is flying around the alpha quadrant looking for Borg in the TOS era.

Anyway, in Vendetta, the Borg return, and Guinan's sister shows up piloting the production model, which actually IS big enough to eat planets.  I read the book many years ago so I don't remember many of the details."

There, a dedicated research base is set up to study the Planet Killer in-depth, with a Starfleet vessel (most likely a Miranda-class) assigned for the duration.   Once all relevant data could be gathered from it, I imagine they disposed of it by pushing it onto a collision course with the nearest star."
DaystromInstitute,3cc0zw,KingofDerby,3,Mon Jul 6 19:25:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with the data mining and research. Since the Planet Killer is made of neutronium, I assume this means the hull is mostly made up of neutrons.

I'm more inclined to agree with Berggeist that it's too hard to move/destroy, so it stands as a silent monument."

I just looked again and it looks like the ship isn't quite as long as a Borg cube. I guess my point at least was that the structure of the Planet Killer couldn't be destroyed by throwing it into a star. Neutrons are so dense and, well..., neutral that they wouldn't fuse or burn in a star. I guess you could bury it in the star until the star burns out. I just have this image in my head of the planet killer 'threading' through the star causing ripples as gravity pulls it in and it passes through, then slows and reverses. Back and forth for decades until it finally looses momentum and sits in the center of the star."
DaystromInstitute,3cby9t,Darth_Rasputin32898,12,Mon Jul 6 18:47:55 2015 UTC,"There are several good reasons why the XCV and the NX-01 have been left out of later mentions.  First off is grammatical preference. The XCV was a part of the old Earth Space Exploratory Agency, now defunct, while the NX-01 was strictly a Starfleet endeavor, since the UFP didn't exist yet.  So when later crews speak of Federation Starships, the XCV and the NX-01 are excluded by default, since they weren't Federation ships.  Secondly, there's matters of classification. As we see in TOS, Starfleet (and presumably the wider Federation) is in the midst of reclassifying and/or adopting new standards for classifying vessels. The Enterprise was referred to as a ""Starship"" class when it was under the command of Captain Pike, while under Kirk and later it was the ""Constitution"" Class.  This leaves anyone referring to the XCV or the NX-01 as a ""Starship"" on shaky ground, as by modern standards neither really were. The XCV was more of a short range testbed vehicle while the NX-01 was more of a Reconnaissance Explorer or short range Science Vessel, while all later craft were significantly larger and more capable.  Thirdly, there's the distinct possibility that many simply forget about the XCV and the NX-01, with the founding of the Federation a new era began on Earth and on the Alpha Quadrant. And in the centuries that follow the era immediately between First Contact and the Founding of the Federation surely looks rather brief and in the wider scope unimportant. For those growing up and being educated in those centuries, it must be very easy for them to simply regurgitate those years in class and then forget them in favor of Early Federation history.  Fourth, it's very possible that the XCV and the NX-01 are, so far as technology goes, considered failed experiments. The Warp Halo, a Vulcan design, may have simply been beyond the technology of Earth Engineers of the time, while the NX-01 was a Diplomatic slam dunk, with more first contacts then any other Captain until James T. Kirk, it was likely not as efficient or useful as later designs would suggest, seeing as how it was followed by the Deadalus Class with its Spherical Primary Hull, rather than more Saucer designs. Later technology such as Structural Integrity Fields and better materials making up for its faults."
DaystromInstitute,3cby9t,Emperor_Cartagia,6,Mon Jul 6 23:15:08 2015 UTC,I believe there is a novel which states that the XCV picture seen in TMP was put up because they didn't have one for the NX-01 available at the time of the launch.

If the events of ""Dear Doctor,"" for instance, are taken at face value, then there's a case to be made that Archer's excesses aren't considered polite table conversation, especially in the likes of diplomatic receiving areas.  Conversely, the XCV, with its apparently Vulcan-aided design, might represent some kind of important milestone in early Federation cooperation."

Whether it's owning slaves, mistreating workers, holding racist views, outright sexism or homophobia, I doubt many of them would stand up to modern scrutiny.  It's entirely possible for someone to be a great man by the standards of his time, while being judged more harshly by posterity. From what we've seen, 23rd and 24th century humans are sufficiently advanced enough that they can understand this.  It's not impossible that Archer could be respected as a leading figure in the formation and early years of the Federation and as a great explorer while simultaneously being considered to have used methods and done things that polite society in the 23rd and 24the century shies away from endorsing or even outright condemns."

At this point we can basically retcon out everything relating to the Temporal Cold War and the Xindi.

Historical/Speculative Fiction is a genre that's alive and well today, so why not in 360 years from now?  This was just one possible explanation.

If artistic liberties were taken with the ships that were included in these displays, it's natural to assume that artistic liberties could have been taken with the ships that were NOT displayed.  After all, there have been MANY ships named Enterprise.

You may not like that explanation, and I may not like it, but not liking an idea does not invalidate an idea. The simple fact of the matter is that the ""all in a holodeck/dream"" trope is really only applicable to ENT due to the very last scene of the show taking place on the holodeck. That last scene calls EVERYTHING that preceded it into question.  And even if you ignore First Contact, it's pretty clear that Enterprise takes place in an alternate timeline from the very first episode. Remember the Temporal Cold War?

The Borg, as you mentioned, have processing that is redundant and found throughout both individual drones and throughout the vessels they operate in.  As such, they have a decentralized intelligence, as disrupting a single node would have very little consequence on their ability to perform.   The Bynaurs are a species that have hooked themselves into a centralized computer, allowing each indivual/duo to work individually, yet coordinated by the super computer.  If their computer were to malfunction, their society would be crippled, though it's unclear as to whether individual Bynaur would be able to decision-make on their own.  This is a centralized intelligence.     The point is that the V'ger vessel is a small nucleus of intelligence with a very large cloud of debris and control around it.

The TMP uniforms look like everything else from the late 70's sci-fi boom: white/off-white with baggy arms and sleeves and high-tech gadgets attached in various places, e.g. belt buckles and wrist communicators.  As previously mentioned the TWoK uniforms are the same as the TMP uniforms, but colored red. Even by 1982 the TMP uniforms looked dated but TWoK had a tiny budget when compared to TMP, so they had to reuse them. So, they dyed them red (they had to pick a dye which would look the same on all the off-white variants of the TMP uniform) and altered the seams.  The TNG uniforms were intentional throwbacks to the TOS uniforms, but gold and red were switched because Stewart looked much better in red. The purple-turtlenecks were more comfortable, easier to get in and out of, and cheaper to produce. Lastly the grey shoulder uniforms are just a ""more militaristic"" spin on the purple turtlenecks, made specifically to compliment First Contact's dark atmosphere.  To directly answer your question: they used the classic movie uniforms in TNG to indicate a scene was set in the past. The producers weren't going to come up with an entirely new uniform for an era which no series or movies are based in, so the red uniforms got to last for 70 years in-universe. Having an interim uniform would have been expensive and confusing, and having the TNG uniform be introduced earlier would have robbed the TNG producers of their way to quickly let the viewer know they're seeing something that happened 20+ years ago.  Sometimes there's no canon answer. Sometimes it comes down purely to production decisions. This is one of those times."
DaystromInstitute,3cbwxu,StarTrekMike,12,Mon Jul 6 19:10:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I agree that the TWOK uniforms are essentially the TMP uniforms dyed red. I mean, the TMP uniforms probably share more elements with the TOS uniforms than the TWOK uniforms when you really break it down.  To expand on it a bit. The TOS uniforms were very simple (as you said). It was really just a tunic, flared pants and tall boots. There was not much beyond that. Also on note, the insignia and rank are done with patches and braids.  The TMP uniforms were different colors and a generally different overall cut (the TOS uniforms were cut almost like a raglan shirt while the TMP were cut more elegantly) but they still were essentially a tunic and pants. There was no sense of layering and were intentionally not very military in appearance. Like the TOS uniforms, the insignia are generally done as patches and braids with a few insignia pins here and there.  The TWOK uniforms are a massive departure from the tunic/pants combo. Instead, they consist of a detailed, military style jacket with a division color collared shirt underneath. The jacket itself is covered in military like details with various rank pins, time in service ""pips and squeaks"", military style insignia pins, and even military style medals chests of the Admiralty.   The move towards the military style TWOK uniforms was very intentional on the part of Nick Meyer who wanted to give the crew a more 17th and 18th century Naval feel.  Now, as far as the story that the TWO uniforms were simply redyed TMP uniforms, that is actually just a rumor. The TMP uniforms were made from entirely different materials, the TWOK jackets were made from (I believe) made from the same heavy fabric that is used for marching band uniforms (probably wool gabardine).   Apparently the jackets alone costed thousands during production."
DaystromInstitute,3cbwxu,kraetos,5,Mon Jul 6 20:08:46 2015 UTC,"Oh man, yeah, sorry. I totally should have mentioned I was referring to the crew uniforms and not the officer uniforms. The TWoK officer uniforms were created from scratch, although some things like the shade of red were dictated by what would work with the old TMP uniforms.  But overall yes—the TWoK jacket uniform was an original creation."
DaystromInstitute,3cbwxu,zuludown888,5,Tue Jul 7 16:28:18 2015 UTC,"The TMP uniforms were reused as the crew uniforms for TWoK and later, yes. That's been made explicitly clear in, like, everything I've ever read about their origin. And that's what all of the extras are wearing.  The more elaborate officer uniforms, with the jacket, were entirely new, though."

DaystromInstitute,3cbl00,grapp,4,Mon Jul 6 17:14:16 2015 UTC,"A very good question with a ton of factors to consider. This is gonna be a long one. I apologize ahead of time.  As a real world example, the human mind reaches a state of being ""fully"" developed in your mid-twenties under our current understanding. However, culturally humans are often considered adults much earlier, or it is tied to milestones or rites of passage. Many of these are tied to physical or sexual maturity.  Klingons do physically mature faster than humans. Even if we ignored Alexander's remarkably quick growth as a production oversight that favoured a good story, Worf makes it clear that growing up around humans he was definitely the biggest, strongest child and nobody could tell him what to do. During a soccer game at the age of 13, however, he accidentally headbutt someone to death.  This scarred him for life. Certainly trauma can shape a personality well after all developmental maturation has been reached, but the fact that Worf was playing in his high school soccer game means curriculum-wise,  he was around where humans are at that age.  The fact that Worf was impacted so strongly and was still in school, combined with onscreen evidence that Klingons do physical mature faster than humans, leads me to consider that Klingons may mentally and emotionally develop at a pace similar to humans. It'd make sense since the Klingon culture that developed and dominated put a lot of emphasis on warriors, especially reaching out in ways that are emotive such as story and song - because population-wise, there's a never ending supply of big, strong people ready to fight with ""adult"" strength, and mental benchmarks of human teenagers. We certainly see many older Klingons with a wide array of thoughts - we see older Klingons that want peace, miss personal glory, have a crisis of faith, lapse into depression, long for a more intellectual age, all kinds of things. We even see a Klingon who is as close to jolly as you can imagine a Klingon, operating a food stall on DS9. He doesn't mind giving people who don't know their Klingon food the bad stuff, but laughs and owns up when called on it. He even busts out a musical instrument to help set the mood for an enchanted evening.  This is also backed up by teenage mood swings. Without getting terribly deep into it, the mind makes some extreme developments while in ones teenage years. This means a ton of neural network development. Another time highlighted by a big surge in neural development is what's colloquially known as ""the terrible twos"" - another time characterized by mood swings, irritability and so on. The short version of the reason why this happens is because the neural network hasn't been ""pruned"", leaving the brain messy and disoriented until enough pathways have atrophied or been reinforced (which is why this stops, or at least gets toned down). This may be why so many ""younger"" Klingon warriors have hair triggers on their rage, moodiness, and so on - their bodies may look adult to us, but they're still hitting the developmental hallmarks of Klingon adulthood.  That's a lot of words to say ""Worf was given instruction at rates similar to humans"", but I wanted to get into the why. I don't get the impression Worf was walking around ""all grown up"" at age 10, but he definitely would have been above average for his age group.  On a similar note, Jake Sisko, Nog and Bajoran children all attended the same school with the same teacher. Jake and Nog definitely grew up at similar rates. We rarely get a look at what Federation curriculum is like - we do know you get an early start on topics we consider advanced, which I would attribute to advancements in teaching, advancements in understanding how learning works, and the advanced teaching aides of the future. We also know that curriculum does adapt - on Deep Space 9, education about the scientific nature of the Bajoran Wormhole is in season 1 (and obviously it's a rather important subject for children growing up in that area, so at some point the curriculum adapts to news and local needs), and it triggers the PTA meeting from hell.  Some races, like Vulcans as Rasputin has noted, will be doing their own curriculum partially or even wholly in order to continue cultural traditions such as the teachings of Surak, or due to a more extreme difference in maturation."
DaystromInstitute,3cbl00,Berggeist,2,Mon Jul 6 20:28:15 2015 UTC,"Well, presumably most planets have their own educational facilities like we see on Vulcan in '09. I'd guess that Federation education as a whole has more to do with completing various courses, customizable to the individual but on subjects that pertain to most Federation cultures, like interstellar history or calculus ('everyone needs an understanding of basic calculus')."

DaystromInstitute,3cc5ce,slumberjam,17,Thu Jul 9 02:34:20 2015 UTC,"To be honest, if it did not center around Starfleet, it would stop being Star trek. It's really as simple as that.  I have seen many ideas get put forth that are essentially just Firefly, BSG, Stargate, Farscape, etc with a Star trek coat of paint. I know that shows like Firefly are cool but Star trek needs to be true to it's core identity and that identity is encapsulated in Starfleet.  Now, the only way around that (potentially) is to base the show on a mostly human civilian staff/crew on a Federation research vessel or station. This would allow the ""human adventure"" to continue while giving us a view that is slightly outside what we are used to while still being true to Star trek's core concepts.  A show about a band of lovable rogues would end up being too much like Firefly, a ship full of non-humans would be expensive and difficult for the general audience to really relate to (which actually makes sense). A show about Klingons, Romulans, or even Cardassians would not only have the audience relateability problem but it would also quickly lose it's novelty since the basic structure of the Klingons, Romulans, and Cardassians is pretty simple, it would quickly become predictable in the worst way."
DaystromInstitute,3cc5ce,StarTrekMike,4,Mon Jul 6 19:48:35 2015 UTC,"As much as I've always wanted to see the Star Trek universe outside of Starfleet explored, /u/StarTrekMike is absolutely correct.

This would allow the ""human adventure"" to continue while giving us a view that is slightly outside what we are used to while still being true to Star trek's core concepts.

DaystromInstitute,3cc5ce,Luomulanren,3,Mon Jul 6 23:03:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think it has to be a civilian crew  on a Federation research vessel or station. Think about the story told in Voyager: Real Life.  The Doctor is a physician at Starfleet medical, but his wife and children have lives of their own as well. A Star Trek outside of Star Trek show is like a family drama with only one character that works in a Starfleet capacity (on Earth, Luna, or a colony) who want a child that grows up and joins Starfleet, but chooses not to, conflicts within the family, with others outside the family, co-workers, friends. Maybe the family has just moved from Earth to a Mars Colony or an alien world like Bolarus IX?  The Starfleet parent is off to work and finding joy in the work, but it's a different kind of bureaucracy and hierarchy. The kids are feeling displaced, lonely, alien in a strange new place.  They have a new culture to learn about, they feel left out, trying to find friends, missing their old friends.  The spouse has to find a place in society also, whether it is work or just taking care of the home--maybe they are ""culturally required"" to stay home and find this frustrating and thus starts a new way by trying to volunteer, or creating a PTA or coach a sports team.  Wow my head is spinning!  Upvote for the OP!"
DaystromInstitute,3cc5ce,njfreddie,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:39:17 2015 UTC,"I have still been thinking about this idea.  Maybe the Starfleet officer moves to a Qo'noS or another Klingon Colony.  It would provide an opportunity the show the culture of everyone's favorite aliens--the Klingons--and make them less mono-cultural.  We can see different parts of Klingon society, not just the warriors and the ""legal"" system.  I am thinking of a Starfleet Doctor trying to bring the Federation level of medicine and care to the Klingon society and must earn the respect of the Klingons while fighting their ""Let an honorable warrior die"" attitude and their ""Suicide is honorable, too"" ethics and the ""guilty until proven innocent"" jurisprudence.  We could see Klingon scientists and priests of Kahless (and other monastics) and even variations and conflicts in Klingon religion (think of the Klingons in Voyager: Prophecy).  There must be Klingons that breed and raise animals, maybe even farmers, miners, writers, singers, and even general laborers.  Just another thought--maybe the couple are alien anthropologists (exoanthropologists?)  and are living secretly on an alien world studying the culture and history, maybe as a first step in a First Contact situation, or just assigned as a desire to understand a more ""primitive"" society.  There is the risk of being discovered, especially with children along for the assignment, and the temptations to use UFP technology to help, educate, and advance the culture."
DaystromInstitute,3cc5ce,njfreddie,2,Sat Jul 11 17:16:03 2015 UTC,"The ""biggest"" departure I believe was DS9 ... because it took place on a station rather than a ship...

But in both DS9 and Stargate,  ships were introduced manned by humans...  (Defiant and in Stargate the X-3xx) class ships..."
DaystromInstitute,3cc5ce,androidbitcoin,2,Tue Jul 7 17:37:46 2015 UTC,"it would stop being Star trek.   I don't necessarily agree, maybe partly because this has always been my favorite theory for a new show. The values that we love about Star Trek are not necessarily Starfleet values, they could be Federation values. Why not Star Trek: Federation. I think the core identity is not strictly tied to Starfleet. I agree, we shouldn't rely too heavily on non-humans, for logistical as well as relatability reasons.   One of the main reasons I like the civilian idea is because many of my favorite shows had nothing to do with space battles, The Offspring, The Visitor, Duet. Even Lower Decks, Cause and Effect, could be done with civilians. An exploring ship could still encounter space anomalies. Voyager was a science vessel. Why does it need to be a military science vessel.   Quark, Garak, Guinan, Kira, Odo, Neelix, Kes, even Wesley, Seven, and all the Maquis, you could argue that their characters would translate easily to a non-Starfleet show. All you need are capable writers.   I do very much like your idea of the civilian story while on a Federation setting, though. I'd be happy with that. I also like /u/njfreddie's scenario elsethread."
DaystromInstitute,3cc5ce,Kamala_Metamorph,2,Tue Jul 7 23:04:37 2015 UTC,"I would agree that a show based around civilians on a science vessel or a station might do fine, I even stipulated that a idea like that would be a exception and would probably work if executed/written carefully.  There is one big hurdle to overcome however, a show about civilian scientists on a science vessel would have to be tasted with a very specific goal and operate in a area that is entirely under Starfleet control. You see, the moment you give the ship the ability to survive on it's own in unexplored space is the moment you essentially just make them Starfleet without calling them Starfleet.   That is the big thing, you use Voyager as a example of a science ship but it never really came out that way in execution, it could take on Borg cubes, it could survive sustained attacks while being offensively capable against ships designed for war.   This is what you would have to avoid and the only way to do so is to make the ship pretty much defenseless, you can give it some shields and perhaps a phaser array or two but in order to sell the civilian science ship angle, it needs to be operating in Federation space so it can be protected by Starfleet. Such a ship simply can't survive on a long range exploration mission into parts unknown.  A good way to avoid that issue is to set the show on a civilian science station so it need not be armed (but could have a separate Starfleet ship and crew operating out of it) and maybe even add some drama and potential story arcs by putting it in a politically or militarily contested region (or something like that)."
DaystromInstitute,3cc5ce,StarTrekMike,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:33:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Honestly, with the show having been away for so long, it would be weird to have the series come back and not be about Starfleet.   What I would like to see with the movies being so hot (and good IMO) is a TV series set in the Abrams-verse that is about a different ship's exploits. They could have the show's story impacted by the film's plots like MARVEL Agents and there could be some cross-over appearances (though this would be tough with most of the Abram's films characters being played by actors with high demand). Seriously, I don't think any of them don't have huge careers. So, well maybe cameos or they'll just be nice and do it at minimum SAG rates?"

The corridor was designed with ample space for future upgrades and new systems.  When designing and building a new class of starship, it made the process simpler and less costly (both in terms of materials and being-hours) to use a standardized design to build around.

IE the Excelsior would have similar components to the Constitution so that it could use Constitution modules; the Ambassador would have similar components to the Excelsior so that it could use Excelsior modules; the Galaxy would etc., etc.  It's easy to look at our modern world and assume the rapid rate of technological advancement we've seen in the last century will continue indefinitely, and then project that assumption onto fictional settings like Star Trek.

DaystromInstitute,3cceq9,rugggy,3,Mon Jul 6 22:15:52 2015 UTC,"No. /u/Jerslan notes that:   the Klingon Chancellor's Daughter in Star Trek VI referred to Starfleet as a ""Humans only club"".   In response to Chekov's statement regarding inalienable human rights. While we could attribute this to a translation error (not just off the word ""human"" but ""inalienable"" thinking it refers to aliens, rather than it's meaning with respect to being taken away), it is more likely an error of naive realism on their part.  Naive realism is a psychological error where you (in part) assume that others view the world as you do. While humans are certainly subject to this, this is an example of others suffering from it, too. Here, the Chancellor, a Klingon, subconsciously assumes the humans think like them and perceive the world like them. Klingons have no belief in universal rights. You only have a right to what you've conquered and what your honor entitles you to. To them, that is the way of things and they think humans think the same way too. Consistently throughout the TOS era, Klingons have accused humans of being like them at their foundation.  Racism is essential to the Klingon identity, so naturally they would attribute that to other species as well. So rather than recognizing a statement of ""human rights"" as a statement of ""sentient rights"", she interprets it literally as a statement of ""human-only rights"" because she believes humans are as species-centric as Klingons are. Even if they swapped it out for ""sentient rights"" in name, that would not alter the underlying belief. In fact, it may make things worse as she'd just assume it was a form of deception, a facade."

That said, I think the main problem Klingons/Romulans/Cardassians have with the Federation is NOT really about any fear of racism, but rather a fear of cultural subversion. They have their own, distinct cultural identities and see the Federation's influence as undermining that identity.  For a real-world analog, look to Japan and China over the past 200 years or so as they have embraced Western culture, very often at the expense of their own culture. It's a very real (and very valid) concern, especially as (contrary to the key themes of the franchise) the Federation culture we see in the shows tends to be far more homogeneous than diverse.  Then there's also the fear of political erosion. These alien powers are all totalitarian states who maintain power by curtailing the liberties of their subjects. Federation philosophy is absolutely antithetical to that approach, so increased interaction with the Federation (in almost any capacity) threatens their political power-structure."

DaystromInstitute,3c8o3r,queenofmoons,9,Mon Jul 6 02:34:15 2015 UTC,"It's an interesting notion- that the Romulans would prefer the Klingons fat and comfortable on the Federation dole rather than panicked and on the prowl. But I'm not sure that outweighs the essential truth that the Klingons and Federation lists of commonalities isn't very long, but is headlined by a mutual well-substantiated distrust of Romulans, and in a world of finite military resources and all things being equal, the total amount of blood and iron available to stare down the Romulans just doubled. The Federation may be able to temper some of the more abjectly invasive impulses of the Klingons, but they also aren't slouches when it comes to getting in the way of what the Empire wants- witness the blockade of Duras."
DaystromInstitute,3c8o3r,anathemata,11,Mon Jul 6 02:42:38 2015 UTC,"But the Alliance would buy the Romulans time, and change the Klingon political landscape in some pretty fundamental ways. The Klingon Empire is organized along the lines of Great Houses, some of which would wind up being closer to the Federation as a result of the Alliance, and some of which would keep a greater distance. And note that the Klingons never fully joined the Federation, and thus had internal politics and dynastic struggles that survived well into the TNG era. A resource-deprived, feudalistic Empire with a strong, stable partner (the Federation) doesn't tend to look outwards, it turns on itself. And this is exactly what we see in TNG and DS9. Bloody political conflict between high-level Klingons is common even during the Dominion War. And it was likely the hope (and later, the practice) of Romulus to stimulate this conflict. An endless civil war in a resource-strapped, warlike culture and a rich friend on the border who just wants to help. It becomes a resource sink for the Federation, which might even get pulled in and wind up having to support one side or the other, which would inevitably lead to more conflict. The whole situation would become a quagmire, and almost did during the Klingon Civil War in TNG. If the Klingons wound up joining the Federation, it wouldn't be until they were much weaker. If they started to invade other polities, it would likely threaten their relationship with the Federation, who would not wish to spend valuable energy on an ally's foreign wars. As a result, the Klingons get stagnated, at best, and castrated at worst. At least, that's how I'd see it playing out."
DaystromInstitute,3c8o3r,KingofDerby,5,Mon Jul 6 02:49:38 2015 UTC,"Just had a thought...Been a long time since I watch ST:VI but...I seem to recall that the central government was more stable, more in power, then it was by the end of TNG...that House politics have weakened it to the point where it becomes a source of, rather then a counter to, internal strife. Perhaps the work of the Romulans?"
DaystromInstitute,3c8o3r,queenofmoons,3,Mon Jul 6 05:08:33 2015 UTC,"Why does it follow that they turn inwardly aggressive? Why wouldn't the Federation provide a tempering force in that regard as well? I think they pretty clearly do- two Klingon coups or succession crises have been resolved with Starfleet aid, aid that was probably furnished with some notion of maintaining a strong partner in staring down the Romulans, which Picard can apparently summon up with a phone call to get cloaked battle fleets to back him up when he goes wandering in the Neutral Zone or covert transport to the surface of Romulus itself to enable close range hacking of Romulan networks-  joint capabilities that the Romulans wouldn't have to worry about if they weren't buddies.   Maybe the biggest blow against the notion is that the Romulans have taken active measures to destabilize the Klingon-Fed alliance. In ""The Mind's Eye,"" the Romulans are feeding counterfeit Federation phasers to Klingon rebels, and condition Geordi to detectably deliver the genuine article, and then blatantly murder a Klingon official. And during the Civil War, the Romulans are supporting the anti-Federation faction of the war. The Romulans clearly don't want the Klingons to have good relations with the Fed- is it your contention that the Romulans are aiming for some kind of calibrated shitty middle ground?   Like I said, it's a cute, wheels within wheels kinda notion. But I don't think that it reflects very much real geopolitical reasoning, or what we see the Romulans do. Russia probably doesn't imagine that NATO is looking to turn any bits of Russian soil into non-Russian soil, which is very much an objective of, say, Chechen rebels. But a formal diplomatic relationship between NATO and the Chechens would make the Russian state very, very grumpy, even if it meant big fat senior partners were advising against big territorial plays."

DaystromInstitute,3c8o3r,DMPunk,2,Mon Jul 6 01:52:52 2015 UTC,"Even if your reasoning for why they would want the alliance is flawed, I can see the merit in the overall concept of the Romulans wanting a Federation/Klingon alliance, especially if taken from the viewpoint of traditional Romulan Chauvinism (to use a Beta canon phrase). To the Romulans, there is no greater enemy than the Federation, in particular humans and Vulcans. Whether it's because they view humans as the sword and shield that their Vulcan cousins use against them, or because of general resentment against the inroads and advances that the Federation has made at the perceived expense of the Star Empire, they hate the Federation. Romulan manifest destiny is that the Alpha and Beta quadrants are theirs. Klingons, while an obstacle, are viewed as an inferior species.   An alliance between the Federation and the Klingons would prevent a war between those powers, a war that the Romulans do not want to see happen. Why don't they want it? Because they're sure of a Federation victory, and any advancement of the Federation is a defeat for the Empire. Look at every effort the Romulans made to undermine the Klingon Empire in the latter half of the 24th century. They were all centred around destroying the treaty with the Federation. At that point, the treaty was an obstacle because it lasted longer than Romulus found profitable for themselves. Romulus didn't care about securing the Klingons as an ally, but in depriving the Federation of one. But at the time it was signed, it was a delaying action against Federation expansion and gave Romulus time and room to manipulate the situation. As far as the Romulans are concerned, the great purpose of the Klingon Empire is as pawns in their chess game with the Federation."

During TNG, I would argue that their goal wasn't an alliance at all - it was a long prolonged civil war which weakened the Empire enough for them to successfully invade and conquer them. The Romulans don't seem like the type to form long term alliances with the likes of the Klingons."
DaystromInstitute,3c8o3r,jonnyta,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:09:23 2015 UTC,"They lack the prowess? its been directly stated multiple times their technology is on par with the federation's. They use a freaking black hole as a power source haha.  As far as the klingon empire, it seems pretty clear they have practically no prowess at all. The only reason they managed to fight starfleet to a stalemate was their warriors are more accustomed to battle then starfleet diplomats with phasers who shoot themselves in the foot so they can be taken off the lines.  Given the likely hood that klingons didnt even invent half their tech (they very likely got space travel centuries before they should have by recovering Hur'q technology) and that their tech is falling behind starfleet steadily I would hardly say they will be able to keep up their status as a super power. Their ferocity in battle and numbers do make up for it a bit however and while their fleet may be becoming obsolete, even a musket can kill you 400 years in the future.  In recent history the klingons fought the cardassians and starfleet and failed to make much progress in either war. The starfleet war was limited to a few sectors they were trying to annex, hardly a total war scenario like the dominion. The cardassian war they did a great deal of damage until their surprise wore off, then they basically got stalemated again.  The romulans on the other hand seem to have a better understanding of technology but lack the numbers to win."

How is that different from me watching the movie musical 1776 to learn about the Founding of the United States? There's plenty of historical inaccuracies from artistic license to make the movie something entertaining.   The ""stories"" that Riker watched were dramatized versions of events to make Historical events more Entertaining. Some may have been accurate, while others? Maybe not so accurate.  Which is which?

For instance, this is historical and surrounds military history, therefore it may be safe to assume that some details may not be declassified for whatever reason, perhaps similar circumstances to Spoiler - Captain Level Eyes Only.   It's an interesting theory, but I agree that it is more likely a small piece of a long history that is often glossed over in general Federation history at the Academy. Along the lines of ""Captain Archer and his crew helped found the Federation in 2161 through their actions in..."" is taught in General History. It's a brief mention and then those interested might delve deeper. Riker has a passing interest in this period of history and is watching a general purpose holonovel just to get a feel."

In the two years before the Borg attack, the Romulans came back onto the galactic stage in a big way, with a vessel that easily outclassed the Federation's best ship. In addition, the Cardassian border war had proven far more costly than was expected. Even the Talarians, a race that did not possess phaser or photon torpedo technology, was capable of inflicting serious damage to Federation worlds.

When produced a majority of the classes you talk about were the biggest, fastest, and best ships in the fleet.  As they aged they didn't keep those statuses but on their introduction the Constitution, Excelsior, and Ambassador classes were all premier ships.   (on the Ambassador) It's low cost, and ease of build meant that more could be built in less time.   Is there a source on that?  I don't see a reason the class would have been a low cost or easy and fast to build.  If anything it would be like most major classes on their introduction.  The most advanced ships in the fleet.  Also, the Ambassador class is kind of an odd duck.  We very rarely see the class.  They are actually more rare than the Galaxy in terms of numbers seen, and thats with there being only 6 Galaxies class ships built (according to non-canon Tech Manual lore). It is possible the Ambassador class never took off and only had a limited run.  It wasn't planned, but it ended up being a gap filler until the Galaxy class.  That or maybe the Excelsiors did a good enough job at the time that the need for the ""next generation ship"" was not high.  (granted the limited screen time of the Ambassador class is due to the rushed nature of its shooting model.

Given that the Yamato, Odyssey, and Enterprise had all been destroyed by 2374, that gives a lower limit of 13 ships commissioned. And even that's if we assume that all the Galaxies in that fleet were visible in that one scene and that all the Galaxies in service were in the two fleets taking part in that battle.   Plus, in VOY:Endgame, there's at least 7 (and possibly 11) Galaxies out of a fleet of only 27 ships that's formed to meet the Borg sphere.

Starfleet then pressed more into service to fill the lines, all streamlined production by removing advanced scientific equipment and many conviences."
DaystromInstitute,3c9olr,mistakenotmy,2,Mon Jul 6 14:23:19 2015 UTC,"I have seen the claim that the Galaxy class ships were only half done before.  Is that an RPG/Game thing?  Because it is never brought up in the show.  I think, and maybe just me, that we shouldn't assume the ships we see are compromised.  I would think they are normal.  /u/Oswalt I fell like I have been on your case this thread, and I really don't mean to be.  I think it is just that you are using RPG info and I prefer to limit things more to onscreen as much as possible."
DaystromInstitute,3c9olr,mistakenotmy,3,Mon Jul 6 15:37:12 2015 UTC,"It's alright, all of this is a healthy debate and I relish the opportunity to defend my stance.  The 12 ship order being cut in half is actually from extended universe books that I cannot source as I am on mobile at this time and can be backed by Memory Alpha/Beta. This is also backed up by history where a craft is ordered in surplus for an expected ramp up in expected wartime scenarios but are usually cut down due to cost.  It's use during the Dominion war showed its value as a capital ship, but in combat was outpaced by the Defiant and other small, sturdy vessels."
DaystromInstitute,3c9olr,SStuart,2,Mon Jul 6 15:55:50 2015 UTC,"Cool, didn't want you to think I was just giving you a hard time!  The 12 ship order is first referenced in the TNG Tech Manual.  It is brought up here and other places fairly regularly and I think accepted as fact.  It to is one of those things that comes not from the show.  I think the TNG:TM mentions the 6 built and 6 stored originally came from Gene.  Hence why it became part of the zeitgeist so to speak.  (It is possible the Federation started building Galaxy class ships and then just kept going)  Given the number we see through the series and by the Dominion war in particular I suspect the ""stored"" 6 were put into full production much sooner (conceding that even happened off course).  ""Encounter at Farpoint"" was in 2364.  Less than 10 years later is the Dominion War in 2373.  I think it is more probable that the remaining order was put into production after Wolf 359 and the Borg threat, so around 2366 and then production probably just continued.  I just kind of don't like assuming all the Galaxy class ships we see in the Dominion War were only partly done with no in show confirmation.  The idea makes sense but it is hard to make assumptions about a ships specifics just by look.  We can't know that all Excelsior class ships were upgraded like the Lakota.  We also can't assume some Galaxy class ships are not complete.  I guess I would default to a ship is ""normal"" unless told otherwise. (obviously I am personally looking for that info in the show more than beta cannon)"
DaystromInstitute,3c9olr,SStuart,2,Mon Jul 6 16:17:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think that's true. The Galaxy Class seems to be the ""dreadnought"" of the Dominion War, the Federation's big ""carrier, capital ship""   Small attack vessels like the Defiant take on a different role in the fleet. We never see a Defiant engaging with a large Dominion battle cruiser or capital ship. We also never see a Defiant Class using it's weapons to bring down planetary or space station shields etc.   A capital ship like the Galaxy Class was not meant for dog-fighting, clearly. But would have clearly wiped the floor with a Defiant or small attack ship.  In the episode Valiant, for example, Nog compares the Jem' Hadar battleship to a Galaxy Class. Saying the Jem Hadar was ""twice as big, with three times the firepower."" If the Galaxy Class wasn't the premier fighting ship during the war, why wouldn't Nog compare the battleship to a Defiant or Akira?   That, along with the ""galaxy wings"" used by Sisko, don't seem to support your theory. Also, we never actually see a Galaxy class destroyed during the war."
DaystromInstitute,3c9olr,mistakenotmy,2,Tue Jul 7 14:34:15 2015 UTC,"The Defiant regularly went toe to toe with ships that had far larger hills and profiles. It's superior firepower and maneuverability were the deciding factor in those engagements.  Jem'hadar ships that were first encountered were smaller and nimble but boasted considerable firepower. In fact the first casualty of the war with the dominion was the USS Odyssey (NCC-71832) in 2730. All hands were lost when the smaller Jem'hadar attack ship rammed the Odyssey's secondary hull. Prior to the destruction of both ships, the Odyssey was attacked by a 3 ship formation.  The Odyssey's port nacelle and and forward torpedo launchers. During retreat, the Odyssey was chased down and destroyed while still inflicting minimal damage to the Jem'hadar fighter."
DaystromInstitute,3c9olr,BonzoTheBoss,2,Tue Jul 7 15:45:42 2015 UTC,"Ok, Let's unpack this:  Are there examples of the Defiant engaging (successfully) much larger capital ships? All i can think of are Galors and Jem Hadar Bug Ships. The one time we see the a Defiant square off with a larger capital ship (Lakota) it's a draw (and this is a Defiant that had a ""extra layer of armor"").   We never see a Defiant successfully take on a larger Dominion ship.   Now onto the Odyssey. We actually don't know how much damage the Dominion ships took, there is no visual evidence or no dialogue that supports a ""minimal damage"" conclusion. A Galaxy Class being rammed doesn't say much about the class. But we do know that Federation shields were pretty much useless against Dominion weapons at that time. So the Galaxy stood up to three Dominion ships without shields while dishing out considerable damage and the mission was successful.   Now, the mission wasn't to destroy the Dominion ships but to hold them off long enough to allow Sisko to be retrieved.   Let's also remember that the Defiant was captured by the Dominion in a similar engagement (DS9 ""The Search"")"

DaystromInstitute,3c9olr,HulaPooped,2,Mon Jul 6 14:30:32 2015 UTC,"(granted the limited screen time of the Ambassador class is due to the rushed nature of its shooting model. It also was not seen in DS9 fleet battles because no CGI model was ever made for the show.)   See, this creates a conflict within me. IF we assume that the production model was of better quality or a CGI model had been created, it strikes me that we would have see a lot more of the class. It was almost certainly supposed to bridge the gap between the Excelsior and the Galaxy classes, and arguably should have become Starfleets work-horse, replacing the Excelsior. I certainly would have preferred to have seen more Ambassadors rather than 80 year old Excelsiors all the time. (Don't get me wrong, I love the Excelsior design, I just think from a continuity point of view they were over-used) For example, I think it would have made more sense if the Defiant went up against an Ambassador during ""DS9: Paradise Lost"" instead of an ""upgraded"" Excelsior class.  On the other hand, if we agree to ignore real life production limitations and use exclusively in-universe reasoning, then the Ambassador was a failure! Perhaps intended to become the work-horse of the fleet, making the Enterprise-C of that class would seem to indicate as much, but there must have been some undisclosed flaw or cost associated with the class that prevented it's wide scale adoption. It's possible there are other instances of the Ambassador roaming Federation space that we simply never see, off-sceen, but it's a stretch to start making assumptions about a ship we DON'T see!"

What I was drawing up was an initial comparison between one of starfleets most iconic ships vs a ship that was far more utilized and production that lasted far longer.  The ships do tend to be larger as technology progressed, but would be repeatedly out weighed by what came next, but what we do see is that even when becoming ""outclassed"" these ships tend to last longer.  As far the cost of the ships, I was using RPG modules and conjecture built upon knowledge I have of the extended universe. Many more Ambassador class ships were produced than the Galaxy-class, but due to the advance nature of the Galaxy, became the flagship of the fleet as opposed to the Ambassador.  This does heavily borrow from the EU, RPG, and Video Games."

Because the Constitution, Excelsior, and Ambassador almost certainly were the biggest, fastest, and best of their time.

It makes  only a handful of appearances in TNG and DS9, far fewer than either the Nebula or Excelsior classes."

Since Jem'Hadar ships have a habit of using kamikaze tactics, it's advantageous to be able to split into three highly maneuverable ships to avoid getting rammed or at least to make sure that it takes three Jem'Hadar suicide attacks to destroy the ship instead of just one."
DaystromInstitute,3c78nf,KingofMadCows,6,Sun Jul 5 15:54:58 2015 UTC,"This is by far the only reasonable explanation I've found for the thing.

DaystromInstitute,3c78nf,Berggeist,4,Mon Jul 6 00:30:02 2015 UTC,That doesn't give the Prometheus any advantage over three separate ships.
DaystromInstitute,3c78nf,HulaPooped,2,Mon Jul 6 02:21:32 2015 UTC,"A single big ship can be used to draw enemy fire more effectively than smaller ships.  Presumably, the Prometheus would be used like a battleship at the start of a battle to provide firepower and protection for the rest of the fleet. Once they start winning and the Jem'Hadar start ramming, it separates to clean things up."
DaystromInstitute,3c78nf,KingofMadCows,17,Mon Jul 6 05:27:10 2015 UTC,"One possible answer is that it's more of a strategic advantage than a tactical one. If the whole ship can travel using the warp drive of only one of the three sections, then it becomes very easy to disguise the true strength of your force and screw with the enemy's head.   Imagine, for example, that you're a Cardassian Gul and you pick up a the warp signature of a Prometheus saucer section approaching your area of responsibility. You have no idea how powerful this force actually is. It could be all three sections of a Prometheus flying together and ready to attack you. It could be that the saucer is just a distraction to pull your forces away from the base you're defending, and as soon as you're out of position the other two sections come in and whack your base from behind. It could just be the saucer on its own. If you're the Federation, you can tie up many times your number of enemy ships just from the confusion you create.  Or another example: you fly all three segments of a Prometheus into enemy space, and then connect the middle and saucer sections together when you're in a nebula, and then leave with the saucer section's warp drive offline. The enemy sees three warp signatures coming into their territory and only two leaving. They think there's a heavily armed warship sneaking around their territory, and spend the next month chasing their own shadows. There's countless ways to throw an enemy off-balance.  Now, the obvious objection to this theory is that in the episode, MVAM is used as a tactical tool. However, we have to remember that on both occasions the crew weren't experienced in the use of the ship. The two EMHs didn't have a clue what they were doing when they activated the MVAM, and we have no idea how much the Romulans knew about the purpose of MVAM when they stole the ship."
DaystromInstitute,3c78nf,HulaPooped,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:49:20 2015 UTC,"As Gul, I first launch a probe at the Prometheus saucer in order to obtain extra sensor readings from the area. I report the incursion to the starbase I operate under, along with any relevant sensor readings. With the starbase on alert, I'm free to investigate, buy time by attempting communication, or running transmission jamming, and perform a feint in the hopes of getting the Federation to play their hand. As Cardassians operate in wolf packs to begin with, I factor knowing that the Prometheus is not a battlecruiser like a Sovereign and can only bring so much firepower to bear against the pack."
DaystromInstitute,3c78nf,Berggeist,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:42:40 2015 UTC,"After several hours, you eventually get a scan on the ship. It turns out it was just the saucer section after all.  Unfortunately, you receive word that two other segments of the Prometheus have entered a neighbouring sector and attacked an important dilithium refinery. It seems because your ships were busy protecting the starbase, trying to scan the saucer section, and attempting to bait Starfleet into showing their hand, they were diverted from their normal patrol routes and failed to detect the other Prometheus segments until it was too late."
DaystromInstitute,3c78nf,HulaPooped,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:42:27 2015 UTC,"Why would the dilithium refinery in a neighbouring sector not have defenses when we know there's a Prometheus, a ship that splits up, wandering around? Why does the probe take hours to return information? Why would a starbase need that many ships defending it against the grand unknown potential of two escort class ships? Does multivector assault mode actually permit the components to operate in neighbouring sectors or is this a capability you've cooked up? How is this scenario any different than if the Federation had sent three ordinary ships?  You're imagining some pretty convenient set-ups here, and with-holding information like the presence of an apparently undefended dilithium refinery so you can trot it out later. Please argue in better faith than that."
DaystromInstitute,3c78nf,Berggeist,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:02:46 2015 UTC,"The specifics of the scenario are irrelevant (though I may come back to this scenario at a later date).  The point is that the ability to disguise three ships as one means that an enemy commander can no longer assume that one warp signature means one ship. Until they have expended effort and time in finding out just what they're facing, they can't know the optimal way to react.   It's really just another tool for military deception, something that has been an integral part of warfare from Sun Tzu to Julius Caesar, to Genghis Khan, to Operation Bodyguard in WWII."
DaystromInstitute,3c78nf,HulaPooped,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:35:11 2015 UTC,"Ok, maybe I should rephrase myself.  By trying to get them to tip their hand, I mean sending a small number to go engage and harass the saucer. That's also why the probe was launched - to provide visual on the signature. But you're again dodging the question of where you're pulling some of these capabilities from, like operating in another sector, why something like a dilithium refinery is left undefended, why a race like the Cardassians, known for operating in groups, wouldn't draw a net around the saucer to draw out the other components, or even how much of a threat a recon escort is going to seriously pose to dedicated warships."
DaystromInstitute,3c78nf,Berggeist,11,Mon Jul 6 02:40:57 2015 UTC,"Multi-vector Assault mode, but I've always wondered why that was considered useful   It's right there in the name, being able to assault from multiple directions is a tactical advantage.   you are giving the enemy three times as many targets to hit,   It's a lot harder to hit three small targets than to hit one big one."
DaystromInstitute,3c78nf,timschwartz,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:36:26 2015 UTC,"At the same time, it's three only slightly smaller targets that now have to deal with the same ship while they've potentially lost out on individual speed, shield strength, weapon count, power generation and firing arcs. The sections are only so small and while it might work against lone ships under the element of surprise, there's still going to be diminishing returns in the face of preparation, numbers or raw superiority."

DaystromInstitute,3c78nf,Berggeist,6,Mon Jul 6 01:43:16 2015 UTC,"Swarm the target, force it to split its fire or concentrate on a single part of the ship. The Mk. II EMH says that the ship is designed for ""deep space tactical assignments"" so it may be an advantage when the Prometheus finds itself alone against a larger attacker.  But, yes, it's wildly impractical and I can't imagine, if the Prometheus ever entered production, that the Multi-Vector Assault system would be part of the production class.  I mean, if you're really want to swarm your target, send more than one ship for once, Starfleet. Actually shit I guess this would be a good candidate for my ""Complex tech solutions to simple problems"" question. Instead of designing a complicated system for a ship to split into multiple ships like Voltron, make three or more ships."
DaystromInstitute,3c78nf,zuludown888,8,Sun Jul 5 19:02:31 2015 UTC,"That part about deep space tactical assignments hits it on the head, I think. Starfleet is known for sending a minimal amount of ships on assignments (the old ""we're the only ones in range"" thing) so having a single dedicated tactical ship that can be sent out and then project the power of up to three ships on demand is a powerful tool. You no longer have to pick which threat to respond to, you can respond to numerous ones.  As far as power goes, each section is as powerful as the whole ship. If you look at plans for it, there is no central power source. Everything is contained in the separate sections. This actually makes the Prometheus more powerful as a single ship. Each section has independent shielding, weapons, propulsion, and doesn't have to rely on the other sections for anything. Thus you have triple redundancy of power and shielding, as well as not having to divide power between different weapons."
DaystromInstitute,3c78nf,ByronicBionicMan,4,Sun Jul 5 20:43:48 2015 UTC,"I think that really just means that you have triple the points of failure. For instance, instead of having one antimatter containment pod that can fail and blow up the whole ship, now you have three. Instead of having a single warp core that can breach and blow up the whole ship, now you have three. Instead of having a single shield system that you need to service and repair, now you have three.  And evidently Prometheus relies upon automation to cover the triple crew you'd need to man all three ships. That's fine in an exploration ship, perhaps, but I think it's highly questionable in a ship intended primarily for combat.  One of the reasons why modern naval ships have such large crews relative to their size (a modern merchant ship typically has a crew of around 20, while a Ticonderoga-class cruiser has a crew of around 400) is that, besides having many more systems to manage, you need a large crew to handle these systems 24/7, have enough crew to take casualties and not immediately be left inoperable, and mange damage control and repairs that will inevitably occur in combat.  Now I don't doubt that Starfleet's automation technology is really good. But for a ship designed for combat in ""deep space,"" you'd think it would need a large enough crew for the exact reasons listed above. If Prometheus sustains significant casualties and some of the automated systems fail, it seems likely that it would be dead in space."
DaystromInstitute,3c78nf,zuludown888,6,Sun Jul 5 21:09:14 2015 UTC,"I think that really just means that you have triple the points of failure.   This is both good and bad. Redundancy is having two computer cores, two warp drives, multiple turbolift shafts, etc. Of course having two, or three computer cores means that there are two to lose, but it also means having a working computer if you lose one. If Alpha section had its shield generators knocked out in the fight, Beta section lost its warp drive, and Gamma section had lost its computer and life support, they could reattach and start repairs within the shields and integrity field of a fully functional starship."
DaystromInstitute,3c78nf,themojofilter,2,Sun Jul 5 22:17:13 2015 UTC,"Well it's good to have a spare battery, that's fine. A spare battery is very unlikely to hurt you. It's a problem when having a duplicate system creates just another point of weakness. Like, for instance, a second computer core doesn't help if losing that core just means that the computer system still goes offline.  And that's the problem with the duplication that I mentioned: Yes, a second or third warp core means you've got a backup, but the thing is that a failed warp core can also destroy the ship. A failed antimatter containment pod will destroy the ship. This isn't redundancy -- it's simply a way to facilitate the MVA system."
DaystromInstitute,3c78nf,zuludown888,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:21:37 2015 UTC,"And evidently Prometheus relies upon automation to cover the triple crew you'd need to man all three ships.   Maybe the automation isn't intended to be the primary way to run the ship.  A deep space ship would basically need 3 sets of crews if they were on 8-hour shifts, so you could imagine a plan where during tactical operations all 3 sets of crews are operating, but you'd still need to good automation in place to cover sudden attacks to give the other 2 crews time to get to their stations.  It could be that the entire point of the Prometheus is to triple the number of ships in a location without having to have triple the number of personnel.  A primary goal of keeping personnel numbers down would also explain the use of the EMH Mark II and the holographic emitters across the entire ship."

I'm not opposed to gestalt vehicles at all, and I guess my problem lies in how much strength each section is supposed to have when independent. That, and the new vulnerabilities created in needing large chunks of surface area devoted to hooking up with other parts of the ship.  There's some merit to the notion of being able to conceal numbers, or have positioning flexibility, but I have a hard time buying that it would really be that much better than just sending three ships to begin with. How long is an enemy going to be fooled anyway when they know you have a ship that can split up? How much easier is it going to be to send over marines to capture a third of a starship, especially when you can operate all three parts with just four people total thanks to the automation tech?  We've seen MVA used twice: once crippling a Nebula class while under Romulan control, and once destroying a D'deridex that had already been damaged by an Akira and two Defiant class ships. I don't see it as a great resumé.  I don't see MVA being something Starfleet would bother with on a large scale. What I do see it, and the Prometheus, contributing to are advancements in the field of automation. ""Branching"" from MVA, you might get interesting ""leaf"" technologies, such as more reliable computer piloting, which might benefit the civilian sector, or improving the ability of separate ships computers to coordinate their fire effectively. Perhaps it would benefit long range exploration by being able to send a mobile starbase or mothership of some kind that can deploy smaller ships to perform exploration duties.  I just don't see MVA as we saw it being the wave of the future. Even Star Trek Online ended up poking fun at it. From Memory Alpha: ""According to Star Trek Online, the multi-vectored attack mode had too many glitches, and thus it was removed from the Prometheus-class at launch, with the intention of fine-tuning it for release at a later date. It was eventually released in the Cryptic Store on March 10, 2011. It is explained in-universe that the ""multi-vector technology was prone to damage and malfunctions."""""
DaystromInstitute,3c78nf,jbcatalyst2,2,Sun Jul 5 23:39:00 2015 UTC,"It's possible that the Prometheus class was initially designed to attack Jem'Hadar fighters: Being able to attack a Jem'Hadar fighter from different angles seems to be it's biggest weakness, since it looks like the Jem'Hadar fighters have only forward weapons.

DaystromInstitute,3c78nf,themojofilter,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:47:49 2015 UTC,"Tactically, it would take 3 times as much fire, and multiple targetings, to hit. This would dilute an enemy's firepower in thirds. Hitting from multiple directions would allow you to concentrate on multiple subsystems, or keep them from being able to simply divert shield power to the one quadrant on which they are taking fire. This is a muscle-bound version of having fighters launch.  Each section can do anything a full starship can do, which includes escape at full warp, run recon, or flank.  All (ok most) of the comments in this post seem to be either ignoring the benefit of flanking a target, or acknowledging it and treating it like it has no merit.  I like all of the strategic reasons stated by u/hulapooped but I think the tactical advantages are at least worthy of exploration. If the conclusion they draw is that there is no merit to MVAM, I would like to know why. It seems as though if Prometheus class ships are in production, then they could easily replace a single section in cases where only 2/3 or 1/3 of them make it back.  And it would be very cool to have one ship out on assignment and that one ship constitutes a small fleet (squadron?) when it comes to any number of reasons.  One section mounts a rescue while the other two engage and distract the aggressor.  One section tractors the satellite away while the others beam up the researchers on the surface.  Enemies send ships to two locations to distract from their real intention at the third location, send two sections to keep the distractors busy, investigate suspicious activity."
DaystromInstitute,3c78nf,Berggeist,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:11:34 2015 UTC,"You're assuming an enemy is going to find their firepower diluted into thirds. But this is also assuming the Prometheus maintains the same shield and hull strength on all thirds and has the same effective durability. If an enemy focus fires on just one section, that entire chunk of ship is having more firepower applied to its personal shielding. If that chunk of ship takes enough damage, it's effectively out of the fight. If that section of a ship finds itself with a comparatively weaker set of shields and hull, you lose all the capabilities at a lower cost.  Now sure, I'll totally grant that smaller, weaker ships can sometimes handle larger ships by virtue of more combined firepower applied at once, but this has limits, especially if there's sufficient enemy ships that sections will be going off like popcorn, or if the larger ship has a large enough lead in defense, armament and power generation, or even just knows ahead of time what they're going to deal with.  Tactically, it may have some benefits, but not only can all of those examples be fulfilled by three separate ships with their own dedicated hardware anyway, but you even had to work your last one into ""three sites need checking out at once"", the number of sections a Prometheus has. What if there's four places that need to be checked out?"
DaystromInstitute,3c78nf,Parraz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:13:12 2015 UTC,"Every ship had a limited power supply. When Shields are raised dozens of shield emitters surround the ship in a bubble of sorts. When the command 'divert power to forward Shields' is given then power is diverted from unrequired emitters to the forward ones. This strengthens the front, but weakens the others. If you can then get a shot on those weakened Shields you have a better chance of doing some damage. Thus multi-vector mode prevents a ship putting it's full shield power into anyone place"
DaystromInstitute,3c78nf,happywaffle,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:10:49 2015 UTC,"Just as a general comment, that episode does a terrible job showing why the attack mode is useful. The three parts don't really do anything in the video that a single ship couldn't do, besides batter the shields from multiple directions at once. (Budget limitations on the show, I'm guessing. The script probably described a bad-ass dogfight.) A proper multi-vector test would involve a ship that fights back—while you target one part, the other two are hammering away at you."
DaystromInstitute,3c78nf,SStuart,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:27:42 2015 UTC,"Star Trek, in general, does a poor job at depicting multi-target space battles.

DaystromInstitute,3c78nf,SStuart,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:03:09 2015 UTC,"I hate this concept. Federation ships, for example, have phaser arrays which can blast anything around an arc, no matter how many targets. A ship with similar arcs of fire, would be undeterred by the three different ships.   Also, if one of the vessels is destroyed then the master ship can never be put back together. Seems foolish."
DaystromInstitute,3c78nf,Village_Idiom,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:26:42 2015 UTC,"My theory is that the separation is for the second stage of a battle. Against a single ship, the Prometheus directs as much fire as it can to a single section of the shields in as short a time as it can. As the enemy ship maneuvers to place the weakened shields on the far side from the Prometheus, they engage multi-vector mode and surround the enemy. Thus, no matter how maneuverable the enemy ship is, their weaker shields are exposed to a constant barrage of fire."
DaystromInstitute,3c5hwk,zuludown888,29,Sun Jul 5 00:10:02 2015 UTC,"I can't think of a good explanation for communications failing completely.  We know combadges have independent power sources (away teams have communicated with one another when the ship is out of range) so it seems like they would be the backup plan if the ship's central power fails.  Was there any explanation in that episode as to why combadges were down?  Radiation interference, maybe?   Now that's not too bad, because even though antigravity lifts are probably a lot more complicated and prone to failure than a forklift, it's the future and they seem to do their job just fine so long as nobody exposes them to radiation.   Perhaps technology has advanced to the point where antigravity lifts are only marginally more prone to failure than forklifts.  Forklifts are probably bulkier/heavier, and depending on the physics of antigravity lifts there may be essentially no limit on their load capacity.  The most redundant solution would be a forklift with an antigravity assist, but the radiation that rendered the antigravity lifts inert might be so rare this is considered unnecessary even in Starfleet.   Ideally, when the lights go out you don't want dangerous prisoners to escape.   I think there's a very plausible explanation here -- Starfleet wants prisoners to be able to escape if main power fails.  In that situation the ship is probably up shit creek anyway, and trapping prisoners (who may be guilty of only minor infractions, or who may be completely innocent) aboard a doomed ship doesn't seem very utopian humanist to me.  Notice how the situation on Voyager is highly atypical for Starfleet -- it's likely extremely uncommon for ships to transport a significant number of prisoners all at the same time."
DaystromInstitute,3c5hwk,disposable_pants,17,Sun Jul 5 01:01:00 2015 UTC,"Asking them why they don't have a forklift would be like me asking you why you don't have a typewriter. Because 'laptops are more complicated and there's more to go wrong. What if there's a solar flare or house fire and you have no electricity, then you'll wish you had a typewriter'.  You use your laptop everyday. It's far more advanced and totally reliable. Some catastrophic event is so unlikely that keeping an old bulky obsolete bit of tech around 'just in case' is silly. Plus, what are the chances your house is on fire and you'll say 'boy I wish I could write an essay right now'.  They probably figure that in the unlikely event that things are so bad even a simple reliable anti-grav unit can't be used, then shuffling cargo between cargo bays will probably be the last thing on their mind.   I think there's a very plausible explanation here -- Starfleet wants prisoners to be able to escape if main power fails   This seems likely. We almost never see life-support go down, those forcefields should be given a similar priority level. But for dramatic effect writers love having the field go down whenever a light flickers because it makes good television."

So I thought about this a bit -- do we ever see away team members use their communicators across great distances in the absence of a Starship? The only episodes I can think of in which the ship leaves and the crew go about their business are ""The Schizoid Man,"" ""The Ship,"" and ""Rocks and Shoals."" In the first, the away team is confined to a small house, and in ""The Ship"" they're in a pretty small area, too. In ""Rocks,"" I don't think they ever use their communicators, even though it might have been useful at some points.  I guess, without the internal communications network functioning, the communicators may have an extremely limited range (why this would be is its own good question). It's also possible that the construction of the ship somehow inhibits their functioning over large distances (I guess Ten Forward would be, what, like 25-30 meters below the bridge? But then again they can't get anyone on the communicator).  Oh, and as for the prisoners -- I figured something like that may be the case, but then again they keep the brig manned 24/7 whenever we see it. Plausible but still not a great idea."
DaystromInstitute,3c5hwk,siphontheenigma,28,Sun Jul 5 01:25:13 2015 UTC,"One thing that always bugged me is that in the event of power loss, nobody ever thinks to use the shuttlecrafts for power. They all have power plants, some with warp drives. I don't expect them to be able to run the whole ship, but they can't use that energy somehow for life support, even in a small area? Or use the shuttle as an emergency communications platform when comms are down or possibly use all of them to tow the ship if propulsion is down. Seems like the only time they ever remember they have a shuttle bay is when they need to fly the shuttles somewhere. For a group credited with ""out of the box"" thinking, they don't spend much time out of the box."
DaystromInstitute,3c5hwk,milkisklim,9,Sun Jul 5 01:49:01 2015 UTC,"Yes! Every time someone gets trapped on the holodeck and transporters are down, why don't they just use a shuttle craft's transporter?"
DaystromInstitute,3c5hwk,02ranger,6,Sun Jul 5 05:33:32 2015 UTC,"Granted, you make a very logical point. My only guess as to why not would be a) retrofitting the ship to accept a shuttlecraft's power takes way too long, and b) in the event that the situation goes much, much worse, the shuttles can double as escape pods."
DaystromInstitute,3c5hwk,insane_contin,4,Sun Jul 5 03:44:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with point number 2 about doubling as escape vessels, so maybe that's why they haven't used them in that way, but as for your first point I'd say Starfleet's design corps would eventually implement this as a possibility. Might be difficult to do on the fly, but it can't be that difficult to build an interface into the ship during construction as a contingency. Seems like a waste of a perfectly good resource. I of course don't know specific numbers, but I'd imagine a shuttle craft's warp core could supply enough power for heat and air, possibly gravity as well, for at least the stardrive or saucer sections of a Galaxy class vessel, possibly the whole thing for a while."
DaystromInstitute,3c5hwk,02ranger,5,Sun Jul 5 04:11:16 2015 UTC,"Heck, you could probably use one as a communication centre if need be. If it has the power to run a transported and warp drive, it has enough power to run communications for a few days."
DaystromInstitute,3c5hwk,insane_contin,4,Sun Jul 5 04:15:14 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I also mentioned possibly using multiple shuttles to tow a stranded starship, although that may be a stretch. There are so many times that something is down on a ship and I wonder why the shuttlecraft can't be used. Transporters is another one. Repairing the main transporter array/room? Why not send a shuttlecraft out and beam the person up with that? Surely not everything  on a shuttlecraft is slaved to the mother ship, otherwise the usefulness of the shuttles would plummet......"
DaystromInstitute,3c5hwk,02ranger,3,Sun Jul 5 04:22:01 2015 UTC,"Heck, just the fact that we see Picard and Wesley take a shuttle to mediate a dispute on the planet implies to me that the shuttle can operate without a ship, at least communications and warpdrive wise. Now, transporter is trickier, but if they can travel at warp, they can probably use the transporter for non-site to site."
DaystromInstitute,3c5hwk,milkisklim,4,Sun Jul 5 04:34:39 2015 UTC,"Good point, I forgot about that. We've definitely seen shuttles operate on their own way away from the mother ship, and the transporters are at least good enough to beam somebody onto the pad from a planet's surface without the mother ship around.   Bottom line, shuttle craft are massively underused, IMHO. Who do I write about this? lol"

Again, only playing devils advocate here. I don't have my TNG tech manual nearby, but maybe a power converter station would take up too much room for the shuttlebay to be practical.   Also, maybe in some situations it's not necessarily that there is no generation of power that's the issue but that the damage dealt to the ship has taken the power distribution system offline. You can't power weapons if the power line is cut! In this case, hooking up a shuttle is moot"

DaystromInstitute,3c5hwk,Hilomh,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:26:05 2015 UTC,"I was thinking they could either have an interface in the shuttle bay where a conduit can be connected to the shuttle and pipe power directly to either engineering or into emergency systems, or design the shuttle craft to allow the power plants to be easily removed and transported to engineering for direct connection.   Something else, what about in battle situations when they need just a tiiiiny bit more power for shields or some maneuver? That power from shuttles could come in handy then. Tie the shuttle into the main power grid and use it for the moment. Of course I can see that being really risky since they may need them for evac purposes or it could be an unstable/dangerous setup in battle, but it'd be interesting to see it done in a pinch sometime. They've done far more dangerous stuff I'm sure when there were no other options."

I'd always assumed that the ship would move once cloaked and that Riker's statement meant they only had a small window in which firing at the BoP's last known position would guarantee an impact, though your interpretation could also be correct.   MA states that the cloaking field was generated through the deflector dish, and that many vessels lacked the power to operated shields and cloak at the same time (most notably during ""Balance of Terror""), but it doesn't preclude the possibility of having shields and cloak at the same time, through multiple deflectors and sufficient power output.  For a contrasting example, Chang's BoP in STVI did not seem to have any shields at all when hit by the homing torpedo. This may have been overcome by the 2360s when the TNG era began."

As far as I can tell, the only thing that really keeps you controlling the ship from wherever is command authorization.  Granted this is usually blocked behind a command code of some sort; but we've seen vulnerabilities before where the computer is somehow accessed or compromised.  We also see that the Prefix codes to control some important functions on a ship are accessible relatively easily (We see it in Wrath of Khan where the Enterprise overrides the Reliant's control and lowers her shields, as well as two times in TNG - once to gain access to a ship where the crew had died though I forget the name, the other to allow the Cardassians to dismantle the shields on the Phoenix).  With an easy to access computer it seems that it would be possible to obtain these codes and put the defending starfleet ship at a massive disadvantage in a fight, assuming you can just lower the shields and can't do anything else.  (""Sir, someone has set a ten second autodestruct!""  ""Well, we're fucked."")  Manual control over systems seems like a much better idea, particularly given how many times Starfleet has found itself at conflict with other powers.

The Enterprise in TOS was very well armed and could stand up well against ships from other major powers. It could even inflict devastating damage on a planet.   The TNG Enterprise was practically a battleship, It may have a primary mission to explore but it was very much Starfleets idea of a Capital ship in terms of it's weapons and raw offensive power. It could stand toe to toe with Romulan Warbirds or Klingon attack cruisers.  Now, we know that Starfleet has also built vessels that are designed with combat in mind. The Defiant, the Prometheus, and even the Akira, Sabre and Sovereign classes were built with force projection in mind. A Coast guard like force would have no need for a ship like the Sovereign, let alone the Defiant.  Now, lets talk about the roles, historically, a Navy vessel can get tasked with a variety of missions. This could include scientific research, diplomatic ferrying, escort, border defense, intelligence gathering, support of ground troops, interdiction, showing military strength, the list can go on.   So, take a look at that list closely and you will start to see a lot of things that we saw on Star trek's various shows and films. The Enterprise (the ENT, TOS, TMP, and TNG versions) and the Defiant were no strangers to missions that fit in that list very easily. These are not jobs that only a Coast guard does, these are jobs that a Navy does.  The big issue however is the wars. If Starfleet were a Coast guard, it would not be acting as the military arm of the Federation. Conflicts like the Dominion war would have been fought by another service altogether while Starfleet just handled domestic defense. There would have been no Starfleet ships pushing towards Cardassia because fighting a offensive war would not fall into the whole defense thing.   There is also the issue of ground troop support. We have seen Starfleet ground troops fighting Klingon and Dominion troops with the support of Starfleet vessels (much the same way that we handled invading Pacific islands in WWII). The Coast guard has no standing army that it deploys to combat zones to fight alongside Army, Marine, and Air force units.   Finally, there is this.   it's a Coast Guard assigned to protect the Federation from hostile incursions without becoming a force that could outright threaten rival powers.   The Federation was fighting a cold war with both the Klingon and Romulan empires in TOS, if it could not effectively threaten those rival powers, there would no Federation. Starfleet was clearly a credible threat to the Klingons, to the point where even they avoided outright conflict. The Romulans seemed to not like the idea of open war either. Why would that be if Starfleet could pose no significant threat?   Starfleet is a combination of the Navy and Marine corps with a dash of Coast guard (since it handles police functions). If it were just a Coast guard, the Federation would have been wiped out before it could even get started."
DaystromInstitute,3c5wt7,StarTrekMike,37,Sun Jul 5 04:06:27 2015 UTC,"Of course Starfleet isn't a navy. Nor is it a coast guard. It is a multibranched military where some parts act as a Navy and some act as a Coast Guard, while other parts at like the Marines or Army.   Think about the dominion war. Starfleet sent soldiers to invade planets that were captured by the dominion. Nobody sends in the coast guard to recapture land taken by hostile invaders.   However, I do agree that many missions that we have seen from Starfleet tend to be similar to the coast guard, but many are not. I get what you are saying, but the idea that Starfleet is only a peacekeeping and humanitarian armada is not entirely correct. Perhaps in the TNG universe, it was closer to that, but it still dealt with wars during that time. Interesting argument though. And the Defiant-class ships were definitely war ships."
DaystromInstitute,3c5wt7,sunnyandtony,10,Sun Jul 5 03:20:56 2015 UTC,"Starfleet isn't much of a ""fleet"", either.   Unescorted flagships Organizing more than two Starfleet ships is a big deal Undefeneded HQ and shipyards Where are the force projection elements?"
DaystromInstitute,3c5wt7,BraveryInc,8,Sun Jul 5 04:05:52 2015 UTC,"Starfleet ships are usually unescorted because we typically see them on missions of exploration.  If you're making first contact with a new species, dropping a squadron of ships into orbit sends a much more hostile message than rolling up with just one.     Undefeneded HQ and shipyards   Can you give some examples of this?  I can only think of threats to Earth where Starfleet met the attackers either far away (ST1, ST4, Xindi storyline) or were able to quickly scramble forces to defend Sector 001 (Borg, to some extent the Breen attack during the Dominion War).   Where are the force projection elements?   Can you elaborate on this point?"
DaystromInstitute,3c5wt7,disposable_pants,7,Sun Jul 5 05:06:04 2015 UTC,"There's a lot more to exploration than first contact, and there are many intermediate values of ship groupings between 1 and a squadron of warships.   How many times has an Enterprise been cut off in some new kind of anomaly where leaving another ship (or even the saucer) outside would have decreased the potential risks or substantially solved the crisis? How many dangerous situations could have been avoided by having a runabout encounter the danger first? How many first contact aliens would feel threatened by a science vessel accompanying the flag ship?  And it's not just the Enterprise that goes unescorted. Almost every time we see other Federation ships carrying flag officers, they are also unescorted.    How many times has the Hero Ship been the only ship in Sol capable of responding to a threat? ST 2 (send trainee ship on a dangerous mission), ST 3 (Enterprise and Excelsior both not fully in service), Generations, ... Any adversary with two cloaked ships could walk in and take out all three Sol ship yards in minutes.  Starfleet appears to employ a maximum of four force projection elements: Hero Ships that can do everything (whatever Starfleet ship the main cast is on), sacrificial ships that withstand blowing up until the Hero Ship arrives (any Starfleet ship crewed by minor characters), anonymous ships that explode, and unlucky shuttlecraft. The consequence of having limited force projection options (and having most of them be underpowered or exploded by design) is that every encounter becomes a high-stakes encounter with very little room between complete success and complete failure.   The main diplomacy ship is also the second most heavily armed capital ship in the fleet? What message does that send? Employing a fleet having diverse capabilities decreases the chances of losing the flag ship to the gas cloud of the week.   And it's usually not even thoughtful design of the ships or protocols that get them out of danger, but rather crew members improvising solutions. Given the number of other dead and disastered Starfleet ships that Enterprise D encounters/was tasked to investigate, one wonders if most of the ships themselves aren't death traps for anyone but the best crew in Starfleet.  When fighting the Borg, we've seen Starfleet assemble a group of ships three times, only to have them fire essentially randomly at the Borg ship. That shows an incredible lack of understanding about how to use a fleet, since agreeing beforehand to target literally any single part of the cube would be a superior strategy.  Finally, it's telling that Starfleet's idea of a wargame was two ships in TNG. Starfleet's most significant tactical discovery of the TNG era was literally move your one ship somewhere else and fire on the enemy. Starfleet's most significant tactical discovery of the Voyager era was we can have more than one asset firing on the enemy at the same time."

I also noticed that the only thing Picard did when he showed up at the second Borg invasion was save Worf and have the fleet target one position, instead of just shooting random points in the hull.  Also, why are the other vessels getting taken out with a single shot, but the Defiant takes multiple hits and the Enterprise gets off without a scratch?"
DaystromInstitute,3c5wt7,Azselendor,4,Mon Jul 6 01:36:45 2015 UTC,"It's also important to think of space in terms of space and not navy.  Space is big.  Intercepting a fleet of ships or just one ship is next to impossible as you would have to know where the other ship is in advance to intercept it.  The sheer scale of space makes this impossible.   I would think many ships are escorted once they leave a star system.  Organizing defenses and and monitoring lines outside of a solar system is also impossible.  Most defensive points are going to be along natural locations of an estimated flight path or in orbit of the target.     As for force projection, that's your single ship out in the dark of space.   You don't need more than that.   Travelling in packs isn't practical for space militaries.  Think about that.   The dominion travels in packs--  but not starfleet.  The klingons too-- but when shit hit the fan with their military industrial complex, it nearly broke the back of the empire.      Why have 3 ships when 1 will do the job?"

Federation ships only survive being outnumbered because of unorthodox tactics and dumb luck, not because of ship capabilities or deployment tactics."

It seems like the federation prefers larger multi-role starships set for long-term deep space missions than smaller role-specific ships of other navies.  Also, it doesn't seem like the enterprise (or hero ship) is often without back up.  We always hear about the ship reporting and talking to an admiral, another ship or something. It seems more like they are detached from the main fleet.  Perhaps the federation does have more role-specific and smaller ships, but they stay in a group as part of fleet while larger ships, like the enterprise, explores just outside the fleet's operating area to investigate this and that.  After the larger multi-role ships investigate, other ships move in to do further work in the area.   If something weird happens, like a ship vanishes, the multi-role ship moves in to investigate while the fleet hangs back."

When was the last time a crew member suggested calling in help from another Starfleet vessel, rather than sending a general distress message?"
DaystromInstitute,3c5wt7,iansarmy1,6,Mon Jul 6 15:44:38 2015 UTC,"it's a Coast Guard assigned to protect the Federation from hostile incursions without becoming a force that could outright threaten rival powers.   I've seen the Coast Guard analogy come up before, but honestly I don't think any comparison to a contemporary government organization can fully encapsulate Starfleet. The Coast Guard is a paramilitary organization charged with relatively narrow roles of maritime law enforcement and public safety. The weaponry on its vessels is extremely limited, with mostly machine guns and small caliber naval artillery meant to disable fleeing civilian vessels. Starfleet on the other hand produces ships that are capable of matching and/or exceeding the capabilities of the dedicated warships of neighboring powers. They aren't ""warships"" only in the sense that they are designed to fulfill a wider range of missions, and that is the key to understanding Starfleet.   Essentially Starfleet is tasked with providing every interstellar public service required by the Federation; defense, intelligence, counterintelligence, exploration, scientific research, interstellar law enforcement, humanitarian aid, search and rescue and diplomacy (both within and outside of the Federation). So it's the Army, Navy, Coast Guard, NASA, FEMA, CIA, FBI, State Department and probably a few other organizations all rolled into one. Starfleet is a huge, diverse and immensely powerful organization given a great deal of autonomy to carry out and many times make Federation policy. It is both the face of the Federation to outsiders and the glue that holds it together. So its ships have a wide range of equipment and facilities to fulfill these diverse missions.   But, Starfleet is without a doubt ""the military"" in every contemporary sense, it is the organization that is called upon to defend the Federation, and it never purposefully restricted its combat capabilities to some arbitrary level. Even the Love Boat Enterprise D could take on the Romulans, Cardassians or any threat that existed when it was launched. When Starfleet faced greater threats with the Borg and Dominion, they built ships with upgraded tactical capabilities. No Admiral ever said ""Ten phaser banks are fine. But, eleven?! That's just evil!"" Starfleet always built ships according to its needs at the time. Saying that it never built ""warships"" was just a bit of political propaganda (like calling the Defiant an ""escort vessel""), aimed at building up the Federation's benign image in contrast to its imperialistic rivals, which it relied upon to attract new members."

They looked an awful lot like some random guys they rounded up and beamed down to a planet.   They participate in major fleet actions and combat operations e.g. Ch'ntoka.   Because they had no choice. Various nation's Coast Guards fought extensively in WW2 as well.    Ships are often described with naval designations e.g. Cruiser, heavy cruiser.   You've got us there, but language can change and cruiser is a pretty generic term. In fact, a sailing cruiser was originally a warship too small for the line of battle but suitable to be dispatched to the far colonies to protect shipping or on discovery missions. I might buy into this more if we were regularly hearing about battleships or destroyers."

Kruge refers to the Enterprise as a ""battlecruiser"" in STIII, though obviously that's not a fleet designation.  It's also feasible that they have a lot more Defiants running around, between the Borg invasion and the Dominion War.  The New Orleans class is also referred to as a frigate, which is a naval term (type of warship).  In Beta, there's also reference to Federation dreadnaughts and destroyers.  Also, what about the ""Federation fighters"" that they use (not very effectively) in DS9 - that seems a lot more like attack craft you'd find launching from a carrier, which is not (to my knowledge) something that any coast guard is in possession of."

And we have things like the boatswain's whistle being observed on many occasions (notably the TMP and early TNG eras), which is a very obvious naval function that serves no real purpose in ST other than to honor tradition.   In beta canon, we have entire sources (especially games like Armada, Dominion Wars, and SFC) that focus on the idea of ships in Starfleet having roles based on naval classifications: frigate - battleship/dreadnought.  Personally, I think there is so much evidence to the contrary of what was said at the beginning of this thread, that that it's basically impossible to deny the concept of Starfleet being a navy-like organization."

DaystromInstitute,3c5wt7,TLAMstrike,4,Sun Jul 5 05:29:00 2015 UTC,"Something to keep in mind is that the Coast Guard, while maintaining weaponry aboard their vessels, often has enough to defend themselves and not much else. They're not an offensive branch of service.   The USCG isn't quite like that. They are not some sea police, they are part of the military.  From Title 10 US Code:   The term ""armed forces"" means the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard.   From Title 14 US Code:   The Coast Guard as established January 28, 1915, shall be a military service and a branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times. The Coast Guard shall be a service in the Department of Homeland Security, except when operating as a service in the Navy.   They are not America's Navy because there is another branch called ""The Navy"". They are a military service with specific roles both separate and combined with that of the Navy.  The USCG operates warships: some are as well armed as destroyers, and compared to what some other countries use for their coast guard our are 'lightly armed' (if you're a sub driver a Krivak III can ruin your day).   One of the major Coast Guard missions during the Cold War was coastal anti-submarine warfare, you don't build ships with depth charge mortars for hunting smugglers or rescuing lifeboats. During WWII they were assigned missions such as combat in the arctic because they had ships designed for that in addition to their other major mission that was convoy escort. During Vietnam the Coasties were used for brown water combat and interdiction missions.   since the Coast Guard doesn't keep marines on their vessels.   You suggest the USCG doesn't have a ""Marine Corps"", this was because the forces needed for boarding actions or actions ashore were simply organic (it was the members of the crew trained for such actions in the ""old days""). Between 2007 and 2013 it had its own special forces unit. They also have other units for tactical missions not normally expected for an ordinary sailor. Operations like this are what the Marines were founded for.  Starfleet is what would happen if the Navy absorbed the forces and mission of the Coast Guard. The Navy would just gain some specialized naval warfare units along with adding a law enforcement responsibility (Starfleet Security anyone?)."

I think you could make the argument that they are closer to a 'National Guard' or active reserve force than they are an active military, however.  The National Guard deal with humanitarian issues. They deal with extreme lawlessness. And in states of war, they fight just like a 'primary' (for lack of a better word) military.   Even many of the officers in Starfleet understand that they are going to be asked to die, defending the Federation.  Personally, I think if the Federation stopped pussyfooting around and actually developed a real military Starfleet would be a better organization.   Right now you have scientists and engineers - people who likely have no interest in combat - forced to become soldiers any time there is a threat. This has got to dissuade (especially after the Dominion War) a number of those people from joining Starfleet, since they want to understand the universe - not have shrapnel from a poorly designed bridge console shot through their face.  If the Federation separated the two tasks - non-aggressive and aggressive - in to two separate fleets, it's my opinion both fleets would benefit. Those who want to fight but find the thought of exploring nebluas tedious could join the military, and those scientists (like Carol & David Marcus) who don't care for the military aspect of Starfleet could join the other fleet, rather than being independent."

I see a lot of people here trying to come up with a way to make it fit into roles that are defined for current Nation-States, but clearly it doesn't. Starfleet isn't a navy, it's not the coast guard, it's not the army, it's not NASA, it's something different and separate. That's totally fine! How would it be classified?  The primary role of Starfleet seems to be as peace keepers. This might sound odd, but that is a vital function when your going into areas of the galaxy where you know nothing about the intentions of the civilizations living there. Part of that role is scientific exploration (duh).  When attempting to make peaceful contact, you're going to run into situations where peace isn't first and foremost on the mind of the other party. A party completely independent of the matter may simply see the rapid expansion of the Federation as a sign that their own civilization/culture is being usurped and that they need to react with great hostility to keep this force out of their area. Tyrants may also see the expansion of a free people as a threat to their power and will react with violence to keep their reign strong. This, too, is where Starfleet comes into play.   Starfleet participates in large scale humanitarian operations. We see and hear about the Enterprise D responding to Plagues, terrorist threats, unstable moons, etc that are on the verge of devastating planets. To keep the peace, Starfleet sends out ships to deal with these large scale problems before the cause panic and chaos.   That's my rationale for saying Starfleet isn't a perfect analogue for anything that currently exists. While they certainly can function as a military or NASA or some other agency, their primary role is that of peace keeper, and that in order to fulfill that function, they need to occasionally become something analogous to the coast guard or the navy."

DaystromInstitute,3c6c0b,BloodyDog,14,Sun Jul 5 06:33:19 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you mean running as in moving, not processing.  The probable answer is ""not quite as fast as you'd think.""  Running speed is a function of a simple equation, stride length times stride turnover. The more ground you cover per stride, and the faster you repeat strides, the faster you go. This applies to everything from humans to cheetahs. It is also why, for example, Usain Bolt is such an elite sprinter. Not only is his stride turnover world-class, but his height and long legs make his stride length superior to his peers.   As for Data, his stride length would be excellent but not superhuman. He has been built to be as human as possible both in appearance and, we can assume, kinematically - eg he cannot do crazy Inspector Gadget tricks of reconfiguring his knees or hips or whatnot to achieve a stride length impossible for a humanoid. Data would of course achieve the maximum stride length possible for a humanoid of his dimensions, and unerringly repeat it down to the millimeter every time. I guess he could also travel quickly by doing long hopping jumps Hulk-style, but at that point you aren't really ""running"" anymore.  Stride turnover is where Data would really excel. Turnover in humans and animals quickly deteriorates due to fatigue since it is such an energy intensive, explosive motion that also requires precise technique. Data obviously lacks this problem. You can also only turn over your stride as fast as nerve and muscle can allow - Data as well is much faster in this regard. So his turnover will be quite spectacular. However he is still bound by physics and practicality. For example he cannot begin his next stride before his foot hits the ground; his legs still have to move through the air in their predetermined arc; he still has to transfer force to the ground, etc.   All in all Data can likely sprint really freaking fast but I doubt he would be in comic book Flash territory. If I had to take a wild guess...maybe 75-100mph? Absolute peak human stride length plus as-fast-as-mechanically-plausible stride turnover? I could see high end highway speeds from him."
DaystromInstitute,3c6c0b,funkymustafa,3,Sun Jul 5 15:43:43 2015 UTC,I dont think he has super speed. There multiple times in the series were being able to run the hell away would be very smart on Data's part. Yet he never does so.  My only problem with him having an extremely increase stride turnover rate would be that it would cause unnecessary force upon his mechanical joints meaning that they could possibly tear or rupture due the immense weight of his upper body. (I faintly remember a line from the films where LaForge was talking to Dana and playfully joked about how Data immediately sunk after playing in a river.) This is assuming that Data lacks a sketital system of course.  He may be capable of accelerated movement from the waist down as seem by him dancing with Dr Beverly Crusher. But at no point in that scene does he show anything less than human.
DaystromInstitute,3c6c0b,funkymustafa,2,Sun Jul 5 16:08:53 2015 UTC,"As far as never showing enhanced speed, I'd guess the writers realized using him like that to solve every problem would kill any drama (and the fx budget). Similar to how they realized early on that ""Captain, we can use the transporter to [solve problem of the week]"" was too easy.   According to Memory Alpha, canon lists Data's weight as about 100kg, or 220lbs. I think his legs would be fine mechanically even for brief periods of massively accelerated load bearing."

DaystromInstitute,3c6c0b,Zeabos,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:17:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's necessarily fair to remove Hulk-esque jumps from consideration, at least in moderation.  It's a pretty anemic runner- indeed, according to Olympic racewalking rules, not a runner at all- that never leaves contact with the ground. The notion that stride length is a pure function of the length of the levers and not a matter of the forces applied to them to create repetitive ballistic motion isn't true, and there's been a generation of elite runners that have abandoned turnover drills in favor of a heavy emphasis on strength training. The question isn't how long Data's legs are- it's the wattage of his....whatever."
DaystromInstitute,3c6c0b,breovus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:10:57 2015 UTC,"It's a simplistic equation to be sure but I feel that ballistic force is an assumed component of stride length - after all, the harder you push off, the more forward/upwards motion you impart yourself and thus the longer your possible stride. Of course, you are correct that it is not simply a function of lever length, otherwise giraffes would be champion sprinters.   I didn't want to go into Hulk jumps or whatnot since that veers more into the territory of ""How fast can Data possibly travel from point A to point B"" instead of ""How fast can Data run""."
DaystromInstitute,3c6c0b,Legendary_Plus,4,Mon Jul 6 13:33:20 2015 UTC,"The only note about his speed that comes to my mind is Geordi in ""The Descent, Part 1""   Picard: Assuming they're still together, how far could they have traveled in three hours?  Geordie: Data can move pretty fast, even over rough terrain... but based on what we know about the Borg, I don't think they can move any faster than you or I. They could be... as much as twenty kilometers from the shuttle by now.   Really not much go to on, since Data is being slowed by the shambling Borg. However, what we do get from this is that   1) Data is fast and people know this. Fast enough that Picard needs Geordie to give him an estimate.  2) Data is dexterous enough to move fast over rough terrain.  3) Data does not move at super speed. ""Pretty fast"" is not what you would say if he was like lightning.  Data is super dexterous, doesn't tire, has super strength, and is extraordinarily coordinated. He would be faster than the fastest human, but he isn't the Flash. He is very heavy and in the numerous occasions where super speed would be helpful, he doesn't use it. Data cannot feel embarassed and has never hesitated to use his abilities when it suits him.  I estimate he probably could move 1.5x-2x as fast as a world class human sprinter, but nothing like a super hero.  Note though, that over long distances, Data does not need to sleep, rest, or drink, he would be a hell of a marathoner or ultramarathoner."

A Hologram like the Doctor is much more advanced in some key ways (most obviously his seamless understanding of emotion), but requires far more memory and processing power to function. 24th century computer engineers don't yet have the ability to put a sufficiently powerful computer inside a robotic body to allow for a sufficiently advanced AI."

DaystromInstitute,3c54qu,Kompyuu,2,Sat Jul 4 22:03:06 2015 UTC,"Sticking a holographic artificial intelligence into an empty robot will break the robot unless a programmer makes it compatible. By itself, a hologram like the EMH is meant to simulate human functions- he's programmed to look like a human, sound like a human, and sound like a human. This is why the Doctor is able to control Seven of Nine without any problems, because Seven of Nine is human (not to mention knowledge on how to use things the Doctor does not have, like lungs and nose).      Unless the robot already has programming on how to regulate itself and is programmed to be compatible with a holographic matrix, simply sticking a hologram into it isn't going to work. The holomatrix isn't going to be able to control any physical functions of the robot because it isn't programmed to do so. Much needed functions, like regulating temperature, would be impossible and break the robot. Attempting to learn how would need it to send electronic signals around by trial and error, which could break the robot.      Think of it this way: putting software meant to be used on an airplane into a centrifuge will result in disastrous effects on the part of the centrifuge."
DaystromInstitute,3c54qu,androidbitcoin,2,Sat Jul 4 23:51:14 2015 UTC,"I donno... I think the future of robotics is the cloud.  Meaning that the personality, memories, and everything else is stored anywhere.. and the robot is well... just another thing that personality can take over....   Much of our technology right now is like that...  all your history is stored on Facebook now. it doesn't matter what device you login from,  your history is displayed on that device.. same with this...  it doesn't matter what robot it's using,  it's the same personality taking over that robot.    At least that's my belief where it's the most logical way to go.  As long as it has an ""internet"" connection that AI technically should be able to control that device and use it as it's own body.   That's just my guess.   To answer the question,  yes that EMH should be able to use a Android like body... just control it from some server(s) , massive computer, chip, whatever they use and if that body is damaged or it wants an upgrade just switch to a new one... heck... taking that approach one AI could control tons of devices (bodies) at the same time.... sort of Like Siri."
DaystromInstitute,3c54qu,Kompyuu,2,Sun Jul 5 17:31:39 2015 UTC,"Let's say the AI of the hologram in question is connected via ""the cloud"" (perhaps a subspace connection) to the robot. There are still going to be problems here because the AI might not know how to operate the robot in the first place; fan and cooling control, power management systems, and other crucial systems. If it tries and screws up the first time, disaster strikes. It's like switching from driving automatic to manual without instructions or guidance. Sure, they're both cars, but they operate completely differently. Same with the hologram's AI when switching from being a body of photons and force fields to a robotic body. Sure, they're both bodies, but they operate completely differently.       The ""cloud"" is not a replacement for a physical connection that solves compatibility issues. Simply put, the cloud allows you to connect to another client wirelessly, and that's it. Facebook's servers have your data, but the rest of the cloud doesn't- they have to ask for the data, and Facebook can choose to accept or deny (and Facebook happily follows the 98th Rule of Acquisition). It's no different than if you had a physical connection to Facebook. Your computer still needs to query Facebook servers whether you were using a LAN cable or an internet connection.          The cloud is simply a wireless alternative to having your computer physically chained to another computer. Connecting a hologram's AI to a robot over the cloud is exactly the same as connecting it physically, so unless there's some additional programming making the AI compatible with the robot, it's not going to turn out well."
DaystromInstitute,3c54qu,androidbitcoin,2,Sun Jul 5 19:27:17 2015 UTC,"Well today's drones operate that way....  for example we're bombing some guy in Iraq from a drone operated from a chair in Florida.   So in this case an AI could fly that drone from that spot in Florida (I'm sticking to real world examples for this)....  even today's personal drones can come (illegally in many cases) with an LTE or 4G connection, giving that drone a virtually unlimited range.      The point I am trying to make is when that drone is shot down, or fails.. the operator (the AI in the future case) could just fire up another drone...    It's the whole reason that drones are appealing for military planners.  Your well trained pilot doesn't get put in harms way... or in the future sense, your self aware AI doesn't get killed."
DaystromInstitute,3c54qu,Kompyuu,2,Sun Jul 5 20:54:17 2015 UTC,"Right, but no matter if you are a human or an AI, simply making either one control a robot isn't going to work. It's certainly will be easier the AI because of superior multitasking abilities, but unless it knows how to operate the drone, it's just not going to work. More programming needs to be done because your typical hologram doesn't know how to keep a drone alive for five seconds.      The drone being operated from a chair works because the operator understands how to use that drone. Give the Doctor Data's body and he'll break down because the Doctor doesn't know how to use it.      I'm not saying connecting an AI to a robotic body isn't possible, I'm just saying it's unfeasible because you might as well have dedicated software, not something meant to be run on a hologram. Would you rather run the Skype Android app on your desktop using an emulator or would you rather just use the Skype designed for your desktop? Dedicated software also saves space and needs less computing power, which is why embedded systems are favored for things like ATMs.       Giving orders to the individual robot with dedicated software is several magnitudes easier than trying to operate the robot yourself. Remember the company manager that ordered you around without knowing what it's like comply? Sitting in your room telling robots with their own AIs makes it so it doesn't matter if the person giving orders is an organic or a hologram."

Why do they so casually use a technology the seems to become self-aware at the drop of a hat? Does the doctor ""see"" out of his emitter, or out of his ""eyes""? Sometimes I think the show almost acts like holograms are spirits that live in the computer."

DaystromInstitute,3c0178,TheHYPO,44,Fri Jul 3 15:18:38 2015 UTC,"Great post.   I would add that Picard's characterization is sadly quite inconsistent throughout TNG's run, both in the series and in the films.  Consider that in ""Samaritan Snare"" (S02E17) and again in ""Tapestry"" (S6E15) we learn that Picard was impetuous in his youth. He made poor decisions that led to a bar fight that cost him his heart. But in ""The Best of Both Worlds, Part II"" Admiral Hanson remembers Picard training diligently to win the Academy Marathon. That's not a direct contradiction, but it's not consistent characterization. Picard was either a troubled youth who had a rocky start in Starfleet, or he was straight-laced from the beginning. The writers had it both ways.   Another example: Consider that in ""Pen Pals,"" Picard reinterprets the Prime Directive in an act of compassion. But in ""Homeward,"" in a similar situation, Picard berates Worf's brother for making a similar act of compassion. Due to Picard's inflexibility, Vorin, an innocent Boraalan, commits suicide. Either Picard is willing to be compassionate in his application of the Prime Directive or he is a strict adherent. Again, the writers had it both ways, and used whichever Picard they needed to suit the story.    Similarly, Picard was an expert in anything and everything. He was a talented amateur archeologist, a literary critic, historian, diplomat, and a brilliant military tactician who has a warp maneuver named after him. I get that Picard was a 24th century renaissance man, but the writers played fast and loose with his back story and personality to justify whatever story they wanted to tell."
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,themantis5000,32,Fri Jul 3 17:59:27 2015 UTC,"He also credits Boothby for setting him straight. He may have been impetuous when he got to the academy, but then straightened up by the end of his time there. The only problem with this theory is that Tapestry takes place AFTER Graduation.  Perhaps Picard was an impetuous youth when he arrived at the academy (think NuKirk at the Start of NuTrek) but within his first year, Boothby knocks some sense into him... he buttons down.. studies and all that, trains for the marathon (to both meet the expectations on him because he's an impetuous and competitive youth and he wants to win) and becomes a great cadet. Then after graduation, he lets loose a little with his friends before they go off to deep space and for a moment lets his guard down and becomes that impetuous youth he was when he arrived at the academy...  But it's certainly true that as with any TV series, characterizations weren't quite locked down in the first season or two, and there's bound to be some irreconcilable changes."
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,themantis5000,21,Fri Jul 3 18:16:41 2015 UTC,"First of all, I will stipulate that we can imagine many scenarios where Picard is a young man who both gets into the fight with the Nausicaans and also wins the Academy Marathon. These are not directly contradictory.  However, it is not consistent characterization. Picard won the Academy Marathon as a freshman. Indeed, Hanson says Picard was the first freshman ever to win that event -- suggesting Picard was a singularly determined and diligent young man. Then, somehow, after meeting his mentor Boothby, and going through academy training, Picard becomes the sort of man who picks a bar fight with two Nausicaans right after graduating from the Academy. This doesn't really add up.  Basically, the writers never had a good sense of Picard's backstory. That's OK, he's still a great character. But we shouldn't look for consistency in his personality or in his personal history, because it's just not there."
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,jmk4422,13,Fri Jul 3 18:27:32 2015 UTC,"In his youth Picard wasn't necessarily ""undisciplined"" in all things, he was just a lot more willing to take stupid risks and let his anger get the better of him. He was strong-willed and determined just like the Picard we all know and love as Captain of the Enterprise.   Perhaps he thought he had something to prove, which is why he worked his ass off to win that marathon his freshman year. Perhaps that made him cocky. We never find out exactly what Picard meant when he said that Boothby helped ""set him straight"". Couldn't it just mean that his cockiness and ego was getting him into trouble? Perhaps he was so desperate to prove himself that he tried to play the role of ""Big Man on Campus"", a cadet who looked down on others, who would argue with his professors and ignore rules that didn't suit him. Boothby could have slapped some sense into him by pointing out that his attitude was going to get him expelled, something that the brash-young-man who had something to prove realized would be intolerable.  So Picard then tones it down. Which isn't to say he'd suddenly become the mature, experienced diplomat we know from the series, just that he knows that he has to study, work hard, and not argue with his professors. That he has to keep out of trouble and choose his fights wisely.  That would be completely consistent with the Tapestry Picard. Still a womanizer, still cocky, but far more disciplined than the younger Picard Boothby had to straighten out.  After nearly dying, he truly realized ""how precious life was"". That would be when we would have started to see his real maturation both as a man and as a Starfleet officer. He wasn't going to ""play it safe"" because he knew life was fragile. But he was also going to heed the lessons of Boothby, his professors, his commanders, and his own life experiences to at least play it smart. This would lead, consistently I might add, to the mature, calm, yet still driven and self confident Picard we saw him as on the bridge of the Enterprise-D."
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,themantis5000,3,Fri Jul 3 19:39:06 2015 UTC,"As I said, we can imagine all kinds of scenarios to explain how Picard both won the Academy Marathon and picked the fight with the Naussicans. I disagree that this is consistent characterization, however. It might have been consistent if Picard had frequently referred back to his rebellious / impetuous youth, but he didn't. Consider how hard he came down on Wesley in ""The First Duty."" If he'd been so cocky and willing to break the rules as you suggest, wouldn't he have at least mentioned that to Beverly or Wesley? Instead, to fit the needs of that story, the writers use the paragon Picard, who dresses down the cadet. They conveniently forget the wild Picard from ""Samaritan Snare.""  Especially in combination with the other inconsistencies in Picard's backstory, I think we have to conclude that the writers generally made up Picard's history as needed for any given episode."
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,jmk4422,8,Fri Jul 3 20:54:36 2015 UTC,"Well, we're probably just going to have to agree to disagree here. But I can't resist some final thoughts on this subject:   It might have been consistent if Picard had frequently referred back to his rebellious / impetuous youth   To whom would we have seen him relate those ""embarrassing"" parts of his past? He's the CO. Everyone on board the ship is his subordinate. Even Riker was surprised in Tapestry after Picard told him, clearly for the first time, the truth of his younger days. A good commanding officer doesn't easily share such tales of their faults willy-nilly to just anyone whose lives are under his or her command.   If he'd been so cocky and willing to break the rules as you suggest, wouldn't he have at least mentioned that to Beverly or Wesley? Instead, to fit the needs of that story, the writers use the paragon Picard, who dresses down the cadet.   In keeping with my above point, he is the Captain. He can't get all chummy with Wil and say, ""Yeah, I did stuff like that, too! Ha ha, good show. But dude, seriously, you need to not do that..."". No: it's exactly because he needs to be seen as a ""paragon"" that he has to dress-down Wesley. Put him in his place. Show him the path and, in a way, put the fear of God into him for his own good. Which he did.    One of my favorite quotes (not from ST) is: ""People do not really change over time. We are as flowers unfolding. We merely become more nearly ourselves."" People don't change, exactly, but we do evolve based on our experiences, our life choices, our age and maturity. Just because Picard wasn't always the Super Serious Diplomat his entire life doesn't mean that wasn't always a part of him. I think we've all known that kid in junior high or whatever who was always getting into trouble, always getting suspended, always getting sent to the principal's office... who now is a respected member of the community, a family wo/man, that person who grew up.  As an aside? That's why I hate the trope you so often see in books/movies when the story starts with its protagonist in his youth and they're ""mature beyond their years"". Yes, that does happen. Some 8-year-olds are going on 30 based on their situation in life. But most kids are kids first, awkward teens next, then young adults, then adults, then wiser adults, etc. Change doesn't mean a person's story is inconsistent. It means that while we don't truly change, we do evolve. Too many writers seem to think that if HERO X is wise in his 50s, they must have been equally wise in their late-teens. I find that silly."
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,themantis5000,8,Fri Jul 3 21:26:20 2015 UTC,"I think we agree more than we disagree. I'm all for the kind of character development you mention here, and I really like the Picard of ""Tapestry"" and ""Samaritan Snare."" I love imagining Picard's life unfolding as you describe, from untamed kid to paragon of diplomatic virtue. I just think that Michael Piller didn't have that Picard in mind when he wrote ""The Best of Both Worlds, Part II,"" and neither did Moore and Shankar when they wrote ""The First Duty."" It's worth pointing out that Robert McCullough, the Season 2 writer who came up with the Nausiccan fight background story, only worked on ten episodes of the series. It makes sense that his conception of Picard doesn't mesh with what we saw later, because virtually the entire writing staff left at the start of Season 3."
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,themantis5000,5,Fri Jul 3 21:51:47 2015 UTC,"One last point:   He can't get all chummy with Wil and say, ""Yeah, I did stuff like that, too! Ha ha, good show. But dude, seriously, you need to not do that..."". No: it's exactly because he needs to be seen as a ""paragon"" that he has to dress-down Wesley.   But this is precisely what Picard does with Wesley in ""Samaritan Snare."" He tells Wesley the story about the Nausiccans, as a cautionary tale for the youngster as he prepares to enter the Academy. Just a few years later, Wesley is in deep trouble for breaking the rules at the Academy. To me, that neither Picard nor Wesley refers back to Picard's rebellious youth at any point in ""The First Duty,"" even though they have many opportunities to do so, clearly shows how the writers were not consistent in their depiction of Picard."
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,jmk4422,5,Fri Jul 3 21:59:58 2015 UTC,"Very possible. Although I would say that Wesley was stressed out and full of guilt and Captain Picard was self-righteous at the start of The First Duty in wanting to clear Wesley's name (e.g. ""he's one of us"" to LaForge and Data). When Picard discovered the truth he was furious at Wesley. And remember, despite Wesley's prior relationship with Picard he was still a cadet. With Picard in full CAPTAIN MODE I can see why Wesley wouldn't throw Picard's past into his face... that would have been really dumb of him and (ha!) inconsistent with his character."
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,dodriohedron,4,Fri Jul 3 22:05:15 2015 UTC,"Picard might be an incoherent character, but I never had trouble believing in him as a real person. Fictional characters have to be consistent, with personalities that can be described in five or six words.  Real people are not required to be easily understood, consistent, or make sense. I never had a problem reconciling all of Picard's different aspects, even in FC, when imagining him as a real person.   You can find similar patterns in the biographies of other very intelligent or very driven people; aspects of their personality and behaviour that don't seem to fit in to a recognizable personality."
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,philwelch,8,Sat Jul 4 12:01:11 2015 UTC,"Consider that in ""Samaritan Snare"" (S02E17) and again in ""Tapestry"" (S6E15) we learn that Picard was impetuous in his youth.

That's not a direct contradiction, but it's not consistent characterization. Picard was either a troubled youth who had a rocky start in Starfleet, or he was straight-laced from the beginning. The writers had it both ways.   Intensity manifests itself in strange ways. Think of the college student who spends none of his time studying because he's dedicated himself to a side project. There are lots of compulsively driven people--athletes, even--who end up also getting drunk and doing foolish things from time to time. Training to win a marathon doesn't necessarily mean you're diligent and disciplined, at least in the sense of being able to keep your cool in a bar fight. For all we know he was skipping some boring math class to put in extra training time.  Think of it as a less ham-fisted version of the central idea of the TOS episode, ""The Enemy Within"". There's a reckless and impulsive side to Picard, just as there's a disciplined and reasoned side to him, and in order for him to be capable of command he needs both sides of his personality. If he lets his discipline and pacifism win out, he becomes the shell of himself that we see in ""Tapestry"". He needs to lash out, find his limits, take a dagger through the chest and laugh in the face of death in order to become the man he is."
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,jwpar1701,2,Fri Jul 3 23:40:29 2015 UTC,"Actually, Picard's impetuousness strikes me as quite interesting in that it makes him truly the anti-Kirk, but not in the ways fansusually think. Picard was an impetuous young man who was tempered by one too many brushes with death into the cool, calculating renaissance man we know. Kirk in the original series describes himself (and I believe he is described by others) as a bookworm at the academy, studying every spare chance he could get. But the unexplored frontier and his five year mission brings out the daredevil and renegade in the former bookworm, suddenly able to forge his own path through the galaxy. And that's to be totally expected from a farmboy from Iowa that worked his way up to being captain of a starship. Picard, who grew up rebelling at the weight of his family and town's expectations for him and the vineyard, naturally rebelled before becoming a very similar duty-bound, cautious man like his brother."
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,byronotron,14,Mon Jul 13 01:44:58 2015 UTC,"As I mentioned in the same thread, First Contact itself does not exist in a vacuum. At the beginning of the movie, we see a huge conflict. Dozens of ships are destroyed, and its implied that the battle has been going on for quite some time prior to that, meaning we are most likely looking at a similar death toll to Wolf 359, albeit probably a bit less due to the Borg (most likely) not having the tactical advantage of a Starfleet Captain directing them. Combined with the events in Chain Of Command pt.2, Generations (even Starship Mine!) And the beginning of First Contact, I absolutely think that Picard's motivations are justified, and supported canonically. Also, remember FC was written by RDM, who had long been pleaing to have some sort of finality and stakes for the characters. (He wanted to kill off Riker!) When he and Braga got the chance, they took it! Honestly, FC is my second favorite Star Trek movie behind VI!"
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,KingofMadCows,9,Fri Jul 3 17:54:04 2015 UTC,"Picard has rarely ever been in close combat situations so it would be very stressful to him. In fact, the one time when we do see him in that kind of situation, the episode ""Starship Mine,"" he did use some tactics that would probably be considered rather brutal/barbaric by Starfleet standards. He also wasn't very upset that all the smugglers/mercenaries died.  Also, I think First Contact could have done more with Picard's lingering connection with the Borg. The fact that they just dropped it after the beginning made it seem like a cheap plot convenience. They could have showed how it made Picard more paranoid and compromised his judgment. Maybe they could have even revealed that the Borg were intentionally using the connection to manipulate him."
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,KingofMadCows,4,Fri Jul 3 17:47:31 2015 UTC,"He was also in close-combat situation in ""Sins of the Father"" when he was ambushed on Qo'nos.  I do agree that the film sort of just throws you right in the middle of the plot, almost... more development of the picard/borg relationship before actually getting them together might have helped, but I really don't think I'd have enjoyed the answer being that the Borg were controlling him and tweaking his emotions. That would have cheapened any actual character development and almost been like a form of reset button - Borg are gone... Picard is back to normal, and none of those emotions were real, so we don't have to consider them."
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,Blue_Dog_Democracy,2,Fri Jul 3 18:10:47 2015 UTC,"I should have said prolonged close-combat situations. Picard has been in fist/fire fights before but they were generally short, lasting a few minutes. He's rarely ever been in a situation where he has to fight a guerrilla/urban type battle over a period of hours or days."
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,KingofMadCows,3,Fri Jul 3 18:41:17 2015 UTC,"Picard has rarely ever been in close combat situations so it would be very stressful to him.   No, he's a Starfleet officer, so combat shouldn't be a problem. It's the Borg that have Picard acting so erratic in this movie."
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,pm_me_taylorswift,2,Sat Jul 4 19:53:50 2015 UTC,"Except as shown in various DS9 episodes, especially ""Siege of AR-558,"" close combat is a problem for Starfleet officers. Just because someone has a lot of training doesn't mean they'll be fine in a real combat situation."
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,SStuart,9,Sat Jul 4 22:41:57 2015 UTC,"I have this argument with a friend a lot. My point is always that people who find Picard's attitude regarding the Borg between the series and First Contact to be inconsistent need to read up on how PTSD actually works.  Even if he'd kind of gotten over it in the series, PTSD can relapse, and this is the movie where Picard learned the Borg could travel through time."
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,pm_me_taylorswift,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:08:15 2015 UTC,"I disagree with all the comments here. Though First Contact was the strongest of the (very weak) TNG films, Picard behavior is strange in all of them.  Yes, it can be explained by PTSD, but the film does a poor job of bridging the gap and developing the character. If a character's behavior is so suddenly different then it should be explicitly addressed in the film, in First Contact (and later in Insurrection), Picard is treated like some caviler action star.  Consider the following comparisons:  In FC Picard not only advises his crew to quickly shoot/kill any crew that are assimilated, he actually uses a machine gun to dispatch them on the holodeck, in almost brutal fashion. Lilly call's him out on it later in the film.   Compare that to the TNG episode ""I Borg,"" where Picard is convinced to let a Borg return to the collective unharmed instead of using it as a virus to wipe them out.   I actually thought that Picard's argument with Lilly in FC (""How dare you?!"") is one of the best scenes in Star Trek. It does make a degree of sense, and FC dances around why Picard behaves this way.  The problem is, however, that the TNG films (FC included) draw a poor bridge between the Picard of the show and the movie. The movie should explain the character shift, not the fans.Picard just seems to have changed, little dialogue or character time is spent dwelling on this realization. It strikes many as rather abrupt.  That's not how good films work."

COUNTERPOINT   PTSD can relapse, and this is the movie where Picard learned the Borg could travel through time.   Do you... really need them to hold your hand and explain that Picard is petrified that the force he once described as...   ""In their collective state, the Borg are utterly without mercy, driven by one will alone: the will to conquer. They are beyond redemption, beyond reason.""   ...can now mess with the very fabric of time itself at will? No slingshot maneuver, no temporal anomaly, just point and shoot. Can you really blame Picard for wanting to stop this threat to Earth's past as quickly as humanly possible?  As I recall, Picard was fairly even tempered before and during the battle with the Cube. Sure, he decided to ignore orders, but FC was hardly the first time he did that either. He only went all PTSD after he saw an assimilated Earth with his own eyes - no hallucination, no tricks. Earth was assimilated; of course he'd angrily gun down a bunch of Borg to prevent the most relentless, evil race he'd ever known from destroying everything he loved!"
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,pm_me_taylorswift,2,Sat Jul 4 02:54:57 2015 UTC,"The film does a poor job of explaining it. That's my point. You are extrapolating and guessing, but his behavior, which is unusual, is never directly addressed in the film.   Moreover, it's not just FC, his pattern of odd behavior starts in TNG Generations and continues through Nemesis. He is also pretty odd in Insurrection. It's just poor film making."

You are extrapolating and guessing, but his behavior, which is unusual, is never directly addressed in the film.

Moreover, it's not just FC, his pattern of odd behavior starts in TNG Generations and continues through Nemesis. He is also pretty odd in Insurrection. It's just poor film making.   Generations is when he found out his family (or at least Rene, whom he'd forged a special bond with the one time they met) was killed in a fire.  Insurrection was pretty clear that everyone was affected by the radiation on the Ba'ku planet.  Nemesis had him meet an evil clone of him the Romulans created, which would probably be pretty hard to just shake off and act normally around.  He acted differently in the movies as compared to the series because the plots of the movies - or at least some parts of the plots, like Rene's death - tended to hit close to home. It's not exactly subtle."

DaystromInstitute,3c0178,RandyFMcDonald,2,Wed Jul 8 20:21:16 2015 UTC,Does he though?  His breakdown at the end of Family would probably be seen as pretty inconsistent without the context of what he'd just been through. Going off on Wesley in whatever episode where those cadets died would have seemed pretty inconsistent without the context of some cadets dying.  Wanting to go off on the Borg because he'd seen Earth assimilated and crawling with them hours before doesn't seem very inconsistent with how much he loves Earth. Wanting to save the Ba'ku planet by going full cowboy with rifles and sidekicks isn't inconsistent because we know the radiation on their planet had effects on flesh and blood people.  Context matters. It only seems like he's being inconsistent in the movies because we don't have the context of one where nothing that was happening hit close to home.
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,Blue_Dog_Democracy,7,Wed Jul 8 20:37:33 2015 UTC,"I never saw any inconsistency.

DaystromInstitute,3c0178,flamingmongoose,5,Fri Jul 3 19:54:55 2015 UTC,"I always argue that Picard's behavior in First Contact is not a mischaracterization.

Of course he isn't going to be the diplomatic intellectual we all know and love!  Fans are absolutely wrong about that aspect of First Contact, and I'm glad someone finally mentioned this."
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,metakepone,6,Sat Jul 4 19:51:37 2015 UTC,I posted my own defence about a year ago. I think maybe the only interesting point I made there in addition to your post is that Picard has already lost two ships and is about to lose a third.
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,ProsecutorBlue,6,Fri Jul 3 17:40:26 2015 UTC,"That's probably buried in his subconscious as well. My only qualifier to that is that he has, on more than one occasion, set the self-destruct on the D without much emotional attachment, and doesn't seem too broken up at the end of Generations. He could be keeping it inside, but he doesn't seem to annoyed. I think it's far more influenced by WHO he's losing the ship to (i.e. the Borg)."
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,deuZige,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:06:59 2015 UTC,I just think that Starfleet officers are trained to realize that losing a ship is part of the business of being a starfleet officer. It's not like they cost a lot of money.
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,demonkobra,5,Sat Jul 4 19:05:31 2015 UTC,"This is really interesting.  My ongoing theory for a while has been that First Contact is meant to be the spiritual sequel to Best of Both Worlds.  By that I mean, the actions of Picard would make sense if this happened before they dealt with Hugh, Lore, and so on.  As if this is the first major Borg encounter after Wolf 359, and thus it's Picard's first chance to fight back. But OP's theory reconciles all of it a lot more smoothly and canonically.  Well done."
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,4mygirljs,4,Fri Jul 3 20:08:05 2015 UTC,"1st up: Dang that's a long post! But well worth the read! 2nd: I don't think most people appreciate just how much Picard lost it during his torture in ""chain of command"". He clearly states he not only would have said anything he states he actually saw 5 lights. That's pretty far gone in any book. And to then get shuttled back to the Enterprise to go right back into active duty as the Captain, no time to even put back the pieces of his mind. That would put any man on autopilot, when not completely melting down. If that man on autopilot then gets put under extreme amounts of stress, like seeing Earth assimalated, or loosing half your ship and crew to what you know to be the most evil force in the milky way then yes, you could act differently then you'd normally would.  In my book after Chain of Command Picard is a changed man. (period)  Not just in the movies but in season sever as well."
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,smashing3000,2,Sat Jul 4 03:20:10 2015 UTC,Picard should be allowed to have a few out of character moments during his life... when you add all the shit he went through during the show it makes sense for him to have a few rage moments
DaystromInstitute,3c0178,smashing3000,2,Fri Jul 3 19:33:25 2015 UTC,I never felt that Picard was particularly out of character in that movie. Great post  backing up your opinion though

Until Hugh shows individuality.  At that point Picard abandons his plan to use Hugh as a weapon (he still is a weapon in a way, but not really the same).  Instead Picard recognises Hugh as an individual and treats him like Picard does all life forms, with a level of respect and rights.  A decision Picard is actually reprimanded for later by Admiral Nechayev.  Now, I don't think that changes the situation in FC.  As people are complex and Picard changing his mind because Hugh gained individuality made Hugh ""not Borg"" anymore.  Hugh was changed enough that other principles Picard values came more forcefully to the front.  Where as in FC Picard is dealing with full on Borg, assimilate everything, menace to the galaxy, etc..."
DaystromInstitute,3c0t84,TheHYPO,25,Fri Jul 3 18:54:33 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to remember that the EMH was a brand new piece of technology that was created the very same year that Voyager was pulled into the Delta quadrant. (http://en.memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Emergency_Medical_Holographic_program / http://en.memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/USS_Voyager)  We really don't have much background for any case at all where you have a CMO and an EMH available on a ship. Voyager lost it's CMO immediately and just happened to have had this brand new EMH technology installed and they gave it a shot.  Discounting Voyager and assuming we're still on a typical Federation ship, we can extrapolate that because the EMH went through 4 major revisions within 7 years, it wasn't performing to spec most of the time, likely leaving out the human factors that make a human CMO preferable to humans.   And finally, the entire database of knowledge contained in the EMH was available to the CMO. I would be quite confident that a qualified CMO would be well versed in accessing it and using the computer to make whatever research it required.   All that said, since we don't actually have a picture of what happened when Voyager was gone, we really don't know if this is what happened. Maybe they were used more than we think. We don't have that picture and we're just guessing."
DaystromInstitute,3c0t84,mrlrm,9,Fri Jul 3 19:14:19 2015 UTC,"We do see Beverly pouring through databases at times, doing research; it just seems logical that if there was a hologram she could just turn to and ask the question verbally and it already knew the whole computer database on medicine, it would save reading and get to the answer quicker. She might there need to read up on certain details, but she wouldn't have to do research the same way.  As an example, I'm a lawyer. When I'm looking for a case on a certain subject, I COULD sit on Westlaw for 10 minutes trying to hit the right keywords, and reading about a dozen cases before I locate the one I was thinking of (if I even know the one I'm thinking of - otherwise I have to read them all to see what the caselaw is) and then I have to double check if any cases since then have overturned or contradicted those cases.  Alternatively, I sometimes call a colleague who has been working much longer than I have and ask if they are aware of the case I'm looking for and they go ""yeah, that's Red v. Blue"" and I just load that case.  If there was an EMH, and I could go up to him saying ""take a look at this skin sample. Have you ever seen anything like it?"" and they could reply ""that looks like rare disease #724"" instead of my having to goto the computer and try to describe the skin sample and read about various diseases with similar skin sample results.... it would save time.  It's basically how on the bridge, they turn to Data and ask him questions that they'd otherwise have to either get out a calculator for or go to the back to research... he's a sentient knowledge bank - they use him. Why wouldn't doctors use the same kind of knowledge bank in sickbay? Even today, you can ask your phone ""Hey Siri, how old is William Shatner?"" or other questions instead of typing it all and she is aware enough to answer. Geordi figured this out in ""Booby Trap"" with the holo-Leah Brahams instead of sitting around reading - he created an interactive program that he felt would be faster and more helpful. I was surprised no one in all of Trek ever used that idea again... create holo-expert... until the EMH himself did it - he created a holo-Cardassian as an expert on a certain disease, if I recall correctly."
DaystromInstitute,3c0t84,williams_482,7,Fri Jul 3 20:25:10 2015 UTC,"Well, part of the reason is probably that they could just as easily say ""computer, analyze this skin sample"" And get roughly the same information.   The EMH (and any other holo-experts you might want to create) have a physical presence with various advantages and appear to be very adaptable given enough time, but they are not any more knowledgeable than the ship's computer. With that in mind, it's not surprising that the only character to deliberately create another holo-expert was The Doctor: he probably wanted to interact with someone like himself."

DaystromInstitute,3c0t84,nikchi,11,Mon Jul 6 14:56:43 2015 UTC,"Think back to the early seasons of Voyager and all the problems with keeping the Doctor online.   His program was apparently massive and took an incredible amount to memory to run. Keeping him online for 7 years required a lot of changes to Voyager. Think of this in terms on your home computer- what program is going to run nonstop for years with no problems? Granted, this is 24th century tech we're talking here and they have better tech, but still- his program is a sentient hologram. That's going to run into problems.  Going into it being a complex program, it needs the occasional update. That's a metric eff ton of code. Type in the wrong entry somewhere, and it isn't going to run correctly.  And then of course, there's the early problems with the model for the EMH. Louis Zimmerman was a prick. The 'Andy Dick' model didn't se much warmer. And people like a good beside manner. It's a good bet that there was a lot of human resistance to having the EMH running nonstop, hence they likely didn't even try to design it to do so."

DaystromInstitute,3c0t84,Berggeist,2,Sat Jul 4 06:20:31 2015 UTC,"I've made a few comments, by at very least the EMH could have been a very good information source even if it wasn't to be relied upon as the primary doctor or even as a hand-on doctor at all."

DaystromInstitute,3c0t84,Robotochan,8,Sat Jul 4 03:51:58 2015 UTC,"I think the EMH doesn't typically take too well to being left to run indefinitely. After 62.5 days of operation the memory begins to degrade. The Mark 1 also had a personality so unsuited to a Doctor that they were all deemed defective and reassigned to scrub plasma conduits and work in mines. The EMH in what little time we got to know them got all the way to Mark IV. I don't know if I'd be comfortable with my CMO changing so often to work out the bugs.  If the holo-emitters go down for whatever reason you've lost your doctor. If you need to leave your ship you're not able to bring your Doctor along. Additionally, being able to shut off the CMO could lead to some unhealthy power balances. Then there's issues like hacking, computer malfunction, all that jazz, and the Federation has never been a very big fan of ""unnatural"" life.  Then you start getting into fields of speciality. There might very well be call for doctors who have extensive experience in comparative xenobiology or the like whose knowledge in that field is superior to the EMH, which in itself could be a huge boon. Additionally, a lack of different perspectives would likely be a detriment to Starfleet Medical Research programs, and while individual EMH programs might exhibit differentiation, it also sounds like it requires running the program well beyond recommended specs and jury rigging fixes, as Voyager's crew had to.  The EMH in itself is a great idea. It's wonderful that there's a solid baseline physician that can fill in a gap as needed. But aside from practical concerns, there are organizational benefits to having a ton of different people with wildly different backgrounds and experience."
DaystromInstitute,3c0t84,time_axis,8,Fri Jul 3 20:43:15 2015 UTC,"From what I gathered, the EMH Mark I was a brilliant and ambitious foray into holographic medical staffing but was plagued with various problems when actually pressed into service which prevented the EMH from ever obtaining the clinical performance that an actual doctor could achieve. For instance, as /u/mrlrm pointed out elsewhere, the EMH Mk. I went through at least 4 major revisions in 7 years and still had a lot of bad evaluations by patients served by the program. While we don't have a report on clinical outcomes, we do hear that the EMH had generated at least two common nicknames based on its interpersonal skills (Emergency medical hothead and Extremely marginal housecalls). So we know that at least the EMH Mk. I was a poor clinical performer.  But Doc, you might say, the EMH always was able to perform the optimum indicated treatments even when said treatments were obscure or difficult; why would bad bedside manner trump such a brilliant level of performance? Well, contrary to what House MD would imply, being brilliant yet a dick does not a good doctor make. For instance, currently, to become a physician in the USA, you have to take a 3 part examination to obtain a license. This examination is known as the USMLE (US Medical Licensing Examination) STEP program. STEP 1, 2-Clinical Knowledge, and 3 all rely heavily on clinical knowledge and the EMH would absolutely rock these sections, likely obtaining a perfect if asked to perform the Starfleet Medical equivalent. However, there is the STEP 2 - Clinical Skills exam. STEP 2 CS does test basic clinical decision making, BUT is more focused on how well you make the patient feel during the encounter and how well you can relate to the patient. Based on what we've seen with the exceptional EMH Mk I, even the Doctor would have failed with flying colors. Further, during third and fourth years of medical training (currently), you receive evaluations which are based on how well you do at the bedside. The Doctor would have been bounced out of medical school for some of his gruffer and shorter behaviors.   It is vitally important that the main medical staff serving a population be not only skillful and knowledgeable but also be able to relate to the population. You have to have people wanting to be treated and who would trust the staff to take care of them. If every trip to Sickbay was a grating hell, no one would go for a hangnail, let alone a vague chest pain that just started or some strange rash that is in an embarrassing location. Add to all of this that if the EMH was more widespread, if you had a bad experience with one, you know, logically, that all EMHs are essentially the same (mostly) and you'd run into the same hothead at any EMH staffed clinic.  That all being said, the one time that a gruff, non-relatable doctor can get away with being a dick pretty consistently is in an emergency. While it is leaps and bounds better to be likable in the Emergency Department, most of the time you are going to be focused on interventions and treatments and have to act quickly. As the EMH would have been seen to be a poor performer in standard clinical practice, having an extra set of focused and skilled hands in an emergency would trump solid bedside manner, hence why the push for the EMERGENCY Medical Hologram.  Now, all that being said, we do see that Zimmerman did continue developing the Medical Hologram program and even developed a Long Term Medical Hologram which he tested on DS9. The new form of the MH program would be modeled on high performing doctors like Bashir and was thought to be the right path to take on the program. These new doctors might go onto replace a majority of medical physicians, especially in roles which have lowered staffing or low danger ratings where staff might not see the doctor often. But as far as the EMH goes, I believe the best call was to relegate the admittedly amazing EMH to emergency service.  FINAL NOTE: The Doctor was likely a fluke. We do see other EMHs in the Dilithium mines starting to expand like him but the Doctor was in a truly unique and extreme situation and thus his program expansion was ad hoc and personally initiated. We cannot expect this behavior from any other EMH and thus it couldn't really be argued that they'd grow softer with service unless they all went through some serious shit in the interim."
DaystromInstitute,3c0t84,long-da-schlong,3,Fri Jul 3 20:53:14 2015 UTC,"I found the EMH to be a bit of a problem, as if Starfleet felt that they were necessary, why isn't there an Emergency Engineering Hologram, or an Emergency Helmsman Hologram etc.  I hate to do it, but there's a ton of holes in the idea of the EMH. From Kim saying it would be almost impossible to make a replacement, to the Doctor simply creating a consultant program with the detailed knowledge to discuss issues and perform surgery. And this is of course ignoring the basic detail that as a program, he can be duplicated. There shouldn't have been any risk of losing the doctor."
DaystromInstitute,3c0t84,time_axis,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:54:12 2015 UTC,"In beta canon, there are Emergency Engineering Holograms and such in the future.  In Star Trek Online, you can have hologram replacements for pretty much an entire crew."
DaystromInstitute,3c0t84,queenofmoons,2,Sun Jul 5 21:58:28 2015 UTC,"The simple answer is; there is no reason the EMH isn't superior, because as you clearly pointed out, it is!  The EMH seemed to be heavily used by Starfleet in some instances, such as aboard the USS Prometheus and likely in the place of a living doctor on many vessels, especially those with a small crew, during the Dominion war, etc.  Really, there would be no point in not having one of several EMH type doctors (with various appearance programs and personality traits, male/female) working. The ship would retain a smaller medical crew of a few Doctors and nurses for emergencies when the holograms are not available, and for away missions.  Additionally there could be additional EMN (Emergency Medical Nurse)/EMA (Emergency Medicial Assitant)  working in sickbay 24/7.  The Chief Medical Officer would still be on duty during the main shift of the day, but would be in a supervisory role working out of their office and pursuing research. They would probably still wish to treat VIP patients such as the Captain, crew members they are friends with, or other guests to the ship. However it would be more of a courtesy than anything else. Other living doctors would cover the additional shifts so there is one non-holographic staff member on at all times.  Essentially. the demand for Doctors in starfleet would plummet with the EMH.  Star Trek always had  a lot of living crew members to make the show more interesting and personal, but in reality with the technology being present and working so well, there would be holographic crew members in all departments of the ship, working the night shifts, holidays, and reducing the demand, as well as work load for the now much smaller humanoid crew."
DaystromInstitute,3c0t84,Neo_Techni,2,Fri Jul 3 19:10:30 2015 UTC,"The simple answer is that people just weren't aware of how effective the EMH actually was.  They designed it to serve in emergency situations, but it was designed exceptionally well.  People underestimate the ability of holograms, and are hesitant to hand over responsibilities to photonic arrays of light outside of when circumstance necessitates it.  There's also always the concern that if you start replacing people with holograms, you won't need people at all anymore.  That's the kind of thought that causes debate and controversy about these issues.  Finally, there's also the fact that the EMH can't be activated for long periods of time without its matrix destabilizing.  Remember, the one in Voyager was specially modified by Bellana to operate for longer than usual.  Normally an EMH can't be used for more than a couple of hours.  However, people did eventually start to see potential in holographic doctors, as Dr. Zimmerman mentioned in one episode of DS9 that he was planning on creating something called an ""LMH"", long-term medical hologram, which was meant to serve as a more permanent solution than the emergency ones.  All the expertise and medical knowledge would still be there, but they'd also have the ability to stay active for more practical periods of time."
DaystromInstitute,3c0t84,TLAMstrike,2,Sun Jul 5 21:50:15 2015 UTC,"Presumably because it's not as smart- at least until you apply the power of repetitive doses of inclusive plot magic that demands every character gets an Aesop demonstrating that They are More (which isn't a bug, mind you. It's part of why I watch.) You could apply the megatomes of information metric to any number of modern expert systems that are very useful but certainly don't seem to be smart. How many medical procedures is Web MD ""programmed"" with?   Star Trek has had an abundance of robots who were people or people-ish- Rayna Kapec going mad from awakened lust, the M-5 suicidally judging itself, Data, the altruistic excomps, the Doctor, Moriarty, and all the rest. What it scarcely possesses at all is, ya know, actual robots- computers attached to actuators that you don't make bright enough (if it is in your power to make them brighter) to be worthy of moral concern or interested in self-actualization, and thus do all those good dull'n'dangerous robot things. In any sort of real world, a Starfleet CMO wouldn't be an old-timey country doctor one day, and faced with replacement with a Turing-complete, introspective superintelligence with an interest in opera the next. She'd have spent her whole career riding herd on a massive collection of sophisticated analytical tools and their robotic effectors, down to the level of cells repaired by Dr. Crusher's nanites. How else can she whip up a vaccine in an hour, by herself?  So, in that light, the EMH is just one more tool. It's a piece of software that keeps more crewmembers alive when it is turned on than when it is turned off. Being good enough at that job to never have a minder on journey of years in length is a rather different question from how money gigaquads of medical logs it contains."

Both of those systems require maintenance, the more you use them the more often it needs to be fixed.  Voyager is in a unique situation, it can afford to dedicate a lot of its resources to keeping the EMH system functioning. Voyager isn't conducting any real mission where large portions of the computer get earmarked for various departments, any departments conducting secondary assignments get bumped because the EMH takes priority- they need the EMH since he is no longer ""Emergency"".  The Sickbay hologrid is the same, the engineering department has to dedicate X number of manhours per hour of EMH use, replacing holoemitters, processor assemblies and anything else that can wear out. On a normal ship Engineering isn't going assign more than the bare minimum required to keep that system up to standards; an above standard EMH system doesn't win you the Battle E or Engineering E (or its Starfleet equivalent) but the fastest warp drive or most powerful phasers do.  Compared to a organic doctor, the maintenance burden is nothing above standard, everything that doctor needs to function, life support, computer accesses etc is part of the normal operations of the ship and what keeps sickbay operational for the patients during a normal operational tempo."
DaystromInstitute,3c0t84,metakepone,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:42:11 2015 UTC,"This is how I've always seen it.  Starfleet is at an age where computers, while very smart, were almost never sentient.  A computer can seem very lifelike, it can even do things unexpected, but for the most part, they are merely reacting to stimulus in a way that best represents their programing.  Now a doctor can search the database easily enough.  A simple command to the computer means that they can access all the data the EMH can with a slightly longer lag time.  In return, they get things like true creativity, the ability to think outside of the box, and come up with options that wouldn't occur to most computers.  Now the doctor can definitely do this.  We have seen him not only come up with creative solutions to unique problems but implement them with options outside of his programing.  What we have to remember is that he was unique in his ability to do this.  Think Bicentennial man.  A computer that developed creativity and imagination but no one really knows how.  The only other time we have seen anything like this (without it being designed like that) is Moriarty, and he wasn't exactly stable.  In short, I think most EMH computers would look at a unique situation or disease and just shrug.  I don't think they would really have the kind of creativity or ability to grow beyond their programing that the doctor had."
DaystromInstitute,3c0t84,jonnyta,1 point,Sat Jul 4 10:08:25 2015 UTC,"The EMH was designed to be just that- the Emergency Medical Hologram. The opera-singing, holographic Doctor we know and love in Voyager started off as just a holographic projection that knew how to practice medicine, and that's where an important part of being a doctor is lost.      A patient should trust and respect his doctor. We know our doctors in the real world can do what they do because they're employed by a clinic or hospital, treats many patients each day with relative success, and hasn't just suddenly appeared in front of your face and asked, ""What is the nature of the medical emergency?""      Crew members in Voyager initially treated the Doctor just as another hologram to be turned on and off at their will like a hyperspanner. Whenever a patient had something to say, they would usually direct their words at Kes. It wasn't until he spoke up to Captain Janeway that he started getting the respect he deserves.      Doctors do not perform efficiently when their patient has no trust or respect for them, which is the case for the Doctor and his patients when he first started out in Voyager and EMHs on other ships. He didn't seem like a person to his patients.      This is the reason the LMH (Long-term Medical Hologram), which was being programmed on DS9 before the discovery of Julien Bashir's genetic engineering, was ""expected to share amusing anecdotes, extend sympathy, swap dirty jokes, and even have culinary opinions formed by experience."" This way, the LMH seemed more like a real person, and patients would trust a ""real person"" more. The Doctor on Voyager, who learned things unrelated to medicine and added to his program over time, is similar to the LMH in this respect."

But, I guess it all comes down to what exactly do the scanners look for as a marker to determine if a target is borg."
DaystromInstitute,3bzi22,Cherveny2,11,Fri Jul 3 12:42:56 2015 UTC,"I'd be surprised if she didn't register as 'Seven of Nine'. The computer would see the remaining elements of Borg, but would be able to tell her apart."
DaystromInstitute,3bzi22,AttackTribble,8,Fri Jul 3 14:45:50 2015 UTC,I'd say she does. She has borg implants and has nanoprobes in her.  But the computer rarely looks for things like that - remember that combadges are all-important for locating someone.
DaystromInstitute,3bzi22,BloodBride,4,Fri Jul 3 13:10:07 2015 UTC,"Are there any episodes in which she takes her combadge off to hide?  If she ever pulled that old canard and it worked, it would suggest that the ship detects her as human, since simple process of elimination would result in finding the only borg on the vessel.  Unfortunately, I can't recall whether she ever does so and googling, ""Computer, where is Seven of Nine?"" simply returns page after page of fanfiction.  Absent that trick having worked, I would tend to agree with you.  A bloodstream full of of metallic, powered nanoprobes doing who-knows-what to her blood chemistry should be more than enough of a signifier to scanners that could tell a Romulan from a Vulcan as far back as the Constitution class. (The Enterprise Incident, TOS.)"
DaystromInstitute,3bzi22,swuboo,3,Fri Jul 3 17:24:55 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of evidence that once someone has a combadge assigned to them the computer pays attention only to the location of the combadge until someone notices the two are dissociated from each other and asks more specifically for the person's life signs, not just their combadge."
DaystromInstitute,3bzi22,lcarsos,2,Fri Jul 3 20:32:11 2015 UTC,"What I was proposing was that the crew could always find Seven aboard by asking more specifically for her lifesigns, and not just her combadge."

It did work.  It took the Doctor a few minutes to find her the old fashioned way (by looking around), so I assume either they didn't think to use the scanners to scan for borg implants, or they don't have the ability to do that."

Included in these passive scans is a constant monitoring of the combadge (and more globably, the communications) network, which also serves to pinpoint location.  So no, I don't think Seven of Nine registers as borg on the ship's internal passive sensors. If someone were to command the computer to scan for life signs, which is a more invasive scan, I would think that her borg nature would become evident."

I don't like your idea that because of the few events we see on screen, there must be systematic discrimination on a regular basis in the Federation. I don't like the idea that it's just playtime instead of a significant interstellar government, and I don't like the human-only club idea at it's core because it takes a giant shit on the entire spirit of Star Trek.  The Federation isn't some vanity project that only Humans take seriously, it's an interstellar alliance and partnership between species who all realized it was better to stop fighting and work together towards a common ideal of a peaceful and benevolent future.  Trying to imply that it's just humanity on it's own is just another symptom of the current trend towards re-imagining all of our old properties from a darker lens. That the Federation can only exist with Section 31 to break it's rules, that every good thing we see must have some sort of hidden downside lurking underneath. It's stupid! Star Trek is supposed to be about having optimism for the future, the idea that we can all come together as one united force for peace and prosperity.  So just because of real-world restrictions in makeup, we have to assume that the Federation isn't the shining ideal it was always meant to be? That humanity hasn't grown in the years since World War Three? That the Alpha Quadrant isn't better off than it was before the Federation?  I call bullshit. It's time that the trend of assuming that every utopia we come across must be some sort of veil for a horrific totalitarian monstrosity comes to an end. It's time that as a fandom, we start believing that there can be freedom without a catch, that good ideals can triumph over evil, and that there can be a happy ending.  Star Trek has always been about the idea that we can be better. That we can do great things, and we can go places where no one has gone before. That's always been more important that the real-world limitations of production. So I'm sorry, but your theory doesn't reconcile with that spirit."
DaystromInstitute,3c24wn,Flynn58,6,Sat Jul 4 03:32:04 2015 UTC,"Wait a second, I'm not saying the Federation is a totalitarian monstruosity, just the way two particular worlds saw to expand their power further, in a non agressive way. They are not oppressing anyone, and they are not imposing anything, just playing politics to remain in control. Because, let's be honest, the Federation is awesome so long as you run the show, but the moment your world is only represented by councilmember 532 and you don't get to say whether signing a peace treaty with the Dominion or go to total war, maybe it's not as great as it seems.   I think that the Utopian view of Star Trek is actually a weakness of the show. It is naive and ridiculous to think that any society can get to a point of absolute peace and perfection, and that no tensions are going to exist in the process. The fact that you may have a great goal, or some elevated ideals, doesn't mean you are not going to have to play politics to make them true, or to make them as true as  you can. Maybe, in my theory, Humans and Vulcans truly believe in their vision, and staying ahead of the game and running the show is, in their view - which doesn't have to be an explicit pact, but rather the way things go - the way to guarantee it will work out."

DaystromInstitute,3c24wn,williams_482,5,Sat Jul 4 19:37:23 2015 UTC,"That's quite a theory.   I would counter by suggesting that this is primarily a case of simple selection bias. The only episode of TOS which shows Andorians or Tellarites as anything more than random background aliens is Journey to Babel, when the Enterprise is tasked with ferrying delegates from several major worlds to a conference. If Starfleet Command had ordered any other ship to pick up these delegates, we wouldn't have even heard the words ""Andorian"" and ""Tellarite"" mentioned on screen.   Additionally, I find it unlikely that the Andorians and Tellarites are both so singularly and uniquely obnoxious relative to every other race in the quadrant that the Vulcans and Humans decided that watering down their influence with races they knew very little about was a priority."
DaystromInstitute,3c24wn,williams_482,2,Sat Jul 4 02:04:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying the Andorians or the Tellerites are especially obnoxious, just that they are too close and sort of occupying the space Earth and Vulcan - who found a perfect and very complementary ally in each other - would need to project their power and expand their influence. But rather than going to total war and obliterating them, or to establish an empire and conquer their worlds, Humans and Vulcans came up with a better option, which was assimilate them and then reduce their influence within the newly founded Federation in order to run things their own way without them being a threat, and at a much lower maintenance cost (both moral and economic) than having them occupied and oppressed.  The same model is later applied with newer races that join the Federation. Vulcans and Humans just let these new worlds' individual power dilute in the numbers while they still run the show, manage the military, outline policy, influence culture, manage international relations, and basically own the Federation. Smaller races of course benefit by having the protection of the most powerful military in the quadrant, by having their people's freedoms guaranteed, and by having access to massive trading opportunities, and perhaps even subsidies by the central Federal Government. They just don't get to run things."

You are proposing a massive, long term, and inherently racist conspiracy at the very core of a government body which preaches peace, tolerance, and acceptance and presides over 150 different planets, all of which joined voluntarily, and the vast majority of which are not included in this little scheme except as sideshows and figureheads.

Humans always act like they are chosen in a way to lead the Federation. They speak of Earth as paradise, and they are always talking of how great they are, how righteous their values are, and how fair they are when they make their decisions. The same goes for vulcans. And their preemeninecy is clear. When the Enterprise reaches Earth on TNG Conspiracy, we see a starfleet command that is only made up of humans and vulcans.   I'm not saying these are racist species, or that they won't accept other races. Not at all. Just that rather than building an empire the way the Romulans or the Klingons did, they chose to assimilate races into their own political system, into their own values, into their own trade routes, and cultural ways. The Federation, even when its political leadership is made up of people of many species, is built inherently on human and vulcan values. Like I said before, this is not necessarily bad for the other species, and they certainly benefit by joining the Federation. But I don't think Betazed will ever be able to impose it's own agenda, or be made a priority in the same way Earth usually is."

Another example, Risa is paradise, yet it has social problems of its own. Federation planets certainly don't face hunger, or war, or crime, but there's more to a society than that.   Regarding your comparison with America's manifest destiny, I would say that American exceptionalism is still very much alive, although it has certainly grew to include lots more groups than white men alone.

In the same way the Vulcan-Human mandate to build a huge federation around its core values could easily grow to include other species. So long as they live under the same values and share the same set of goals, no tension will exist, and they will be happily accepted into the club  The Federation is mostly a Human-Vulcan club, and its continuous expansion a strategy to undermine its early members   I won't argue that the Federation espouses values which fit quite nicely with what Vulcans and humans care about, and they have built a gigantic Federation around those beliefs which quite a lot of other races apparently share. Your assertion that the decision to expand was a deliberate strategy centered around diluting the percentage of members who were Andorian or Tellarite seems wildly out of line with what you seem to be arguing here."

In big political unions you often have sectors that you need to keep inside, but which on some issues don't exactly agree with you. Since you cannot impose your pov on them, you can always make sure they are marginalized in the law making process.  Take France for example, all political parties there have an agreement not to form governing coalitions with extremist parties. I know political party doesn't equal a region or a certain class of people, but it is an example of how you can be French (or a Federation citizen for that matter), have your rights, and still never ever be able to make your point on the Parliament. And you can only get away with that when you build a majority that either symphatizes with you or that you can control that will never ever allow that sector to grab power or to pass their legislation.

I have always hated it, though.  Don't get me wrong, I love theories.  The lack of aliens is, in my opinion, totally production related.  The number of aliens we see in the background is very much based on the budget of the show and many, many factors not related to story or universe building.

I've come to the conclusion that, apart from flag waving ships like the Enterprise, most ships are going to be dominated by a single race.  *yes, could just be a little specialise science station, except that the implication is that major engineering work (which would take many weeks at DS9) could have been done there, which implies that it is at least as capable as DS9."

Species like the Vulcans, Andorians, Tellarites, etc. have had warp technology for much longer than humans. They already have their own fleets and space exploration and defense organizations. They have more options open to them. If a human want to become a starship captain, Starfleet is probably their best chance. But if an Andorian wants to become a starship captain, they can join the Andorian fleet or Starfleet. In fact, it's probably easier for an Andorian to join their military/science organization than Starfleet."
DaystromInstitute,3c24wn,Neo24,3,Sat Jul 4 03:21:52 2015 UTC,"There is no Andorian fleet. Not a military one anyway. The Federation centralizes the military under Starfleet.   We can clearly see this when Bajor is about to join the Federation in DS9, and Captain Sisko is asked to oversee the merger of the Bajoran Militia into Starfleet.   What member worlds do have is civilian vessels, which may run freight, passengers, and who knows what else. But if you wish to become a Starship captain and explore the galaxy it doesn't matter if you are an Andorian, a Vulcan, a Human or a Trill, you have to go to Starfleet."
DaystromInstitute,3c24wn,mistakenotmy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:32:55 2015 UTC,"Vulcans still had defense ships as shown in ""Unification.""  Also, the Bajoran militia is very small. According to TNG, they don't even have warp capable ships. It makes sense why they would be willing to let Starfleet take over defense of their planet. It doesn't make much sense for a race that already have their own fleet like the Vulcans or Andorians to completely give it up for Starfleet."
DaystromInstitute,3c24wn,KingofMadCows,5,Sat Jul 4 04:08:35 2015 UTC,"I may be misremembering but Vulcan had no defense ships during ""Unification"".  The Enterprise went to provide defense for the planet if needed (as it was the Romulans destroyed the stolen vulcan transports themselves).  We also see no Vulcan Defense ships in ""Gambit"", when they would have been really handy to have."
DaystromInstitute,3c24wn,mistakenotmy,3,Sat Jul 4 04:14:10 2015 UTC,"After Data and Picard revealed the Romulan deception, Worf mentions that Vulcan defense ships were responding and that the Romulans were retreating back to the Neutral Zone.  As for Gambit, the Vulcans didn't even know what was going on until near the end. By the time Riker told Vulcan security about it, Tellara was already close to Vulcan."
DaystromInstitute,3c24wn,KingofMadCows,2,Sat Jul 4 05:51:33 2015 UTC,"Well what do you know, there it is in the transcript. I stand corrected on that.  Sorry, but I still don't buy planets having more than minimal ""home grown"" defense ships.  I could see a coast guard like service but Starfleet is the naval strength of the Federation, all of it.  We just never see anything else substantial and there have been more than enough times we should have if they existed."
DaystromInstitute,3c24wn,mistakenotmy,2,Sat Jul 4 06:09:13 2015 UTC,"Why not? Why would races that have had military fleets for decades or even centuries just dismantle them all? Federation races can clearly have ships, they have cargo ships, transport ships, science ships, etc. Why can't they have military ships?"
DaystromInstitute,3c24wn,KingofMadCows,2,Sat Jul 4 07:16:34 2015 UTC,"For the same reason California, New York, Virginia, or Florida don't have their own Navies..."
DaystromInstitute,3c24wn,mistakenotmy,3,Sat Jul 4 13:17:49 2015 UTC,"They do have Army and Air National Guards, though. They have no Naval NGs, true, but IMO that's largely because it would be unpractical and unnecessary (ships are expensive, not every state has a coast and the coasts are largely a single continuous unit). OTOH, I don't see why Federation worlds couldn't retain small-ish local fleets for local matters and as a last ditch defence if Starfleet fails. That wouldn't really change Starfleet's role as the main fleet, as long as Starfleet is ultimately in charge."
DaystromInstitute,3c24wn,KingofMadCows,3,Sat Jul 4 16:45:48 2015 UTC,"I think we are saying the same thing actually.  A small local force that is more a police function, and last ditch defense.  I don't see a local fleet being to big or having starship class ships.  Something between runabouts and Defiant sized ships to police local merchant traffic and transports, SAR operations, etc.  Nothing that would be called on to be in a real fleet engagement.  Kind of like the Coast Guard  (don't take that as anything against the Coast Guard, they do great work)."
DaystromInstitute,3c24wn,mistakenotmy,2,Sat Jul 4 16:51:53 2015 UTC,"But France, Germany, Italy, the UK, etc. all have their militaries even though they're part of the European Union.  And from what we've seen, there are as many similarities between the Federation and the EU as there is between the Federation and the US."
DaystromInstitute,3c24wn,nikchi,2,Sat Jul 4 22:35:45 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt the Federation is based on the EU.  Much more likely the writers based it on the US.  Possible, but I would assume US before EU."
DaystromInstitute,3c24wn,mistakenotmy,2,Sat Jul 4 22:45:31 2015 UTC,"When he says ""Vulcan defense ships"" he could either mean:   Defense ships that belong to a Vulcan force, or Defense ships whose mission is to defend the planet Vulcan   You could argue in the second scenario he would have said ""Vulcan's defense ships"", but maybe it's a starfleet squad who's mission is to defend Vulcan, which they call the Vulcan defense system or vulcan defense squad, or something in Vulcan.  An alternative would be for those ships to be a sort of coast guard, so they are not necessarily an army.   Regarding the mention of ""Vulcan Security"" in Gambit, that is obviously a police force of some kind."
DaystromInstitute,3c24wn,KingofMadCows,3,Sat Jul 4 06:57:29 2015 UTC,"When has it ever been stated that Starfleet was the only military fleet for every Federation world? If Federation worlds can have cargo/transport/science ships and orbital or stationary defenses, why can't they have military ships? Especially considering how Starfleet always insists that it doesn't have any warships."

DaystromInstitute,3c24wn,redwall_hp,2,Sat Jul 4 22:43:18 2015 UTC,Nope but we know the Enterprise exists.  I need more proof these never actually seen ships exist.  If they are more than a local police force I would expect to see them show up in a war.  Not to mention production didn't like to cross Hero ships between series.
DaystromInstitute,3c24wn,Justice_Prince,2,Sat Jul 4 22:48:35 2015 UTC,"In DS9 it is made pretty clear, when they say the Bajoran Militia can no longer exist after Bajor joins the Federation.  Besides, the Federation is a country, it isn't conceivable member planets (states) would have militaries of their own."
DaystromInstitute,3c24wn,ACAFWD,2,Sat Jul 4 13:44:16 2015 UTC,"Except they never said if that was specific to Bajor, maybe even at the request of the Bajorans, or if it was done to everyone who joins the Federation.   Also, a militia is not the same as a military. A military is formal and organized, and it's composed of professional soldiers, people who have gone through a formal training process. A militia is composed of non-professional soldiers, mostly civilians who don't have formal training.   Plus, the Bajoran militia is very small and doesn't even have warp capable ships. The Vulcans and Andorians had fleets that were much bigger than Starfleet at the beginning.  Oh and another episode that suggests other Federation races have fleets was the TNG episode with the officer exchange program. The fact that Mendon was a part of the program suggests that the Benzites have their own fleet since Riker joined a Klingon ship."
DaystromInstitute,3c24wn,darkgauss,6,Sat Jul 4 22:41:02 2015 UTC,"Those were old ships stolen from scrapyards. It is implied a few times worlds may have like a national guard sort of thing (in the same way states in the US do so), but they definitely do not have a military force.  Unification, however, is a very interesting example of an episode where the writers seem to have taken a few liberties and never really explained how the reunification of Romulus and Vulcan would have affected the Federation had it been a real thing. This is a very very interesting topic to think about, and I hope a new thread is opened at some point to theorize about it. Would have Romulus joined the Federation? Would have Vulcan left? Can they just secede? Is Spock as an ambassador acting on behalf of Vulcan alone or the Federation? Why would Vulcan have an ambassador? Why does the Romulan proconsul have such a small office?"
DaystromInstitute,3bzall,Hellstrike,9,Fri Jul 3 10:42:37 2015 UTC,"I think a new Trek series could feasibly be set in three time periods:    A decade or two after the events of the TNG/DS9/YOY era.  There's plenty of material to draw from there, actors from those shows would be the right age for cameos, and the series would be visually and technologically similar to the most popular Trek shows.  On the other hand, having a cleaner slate for new viewers would be appealing, we've already had ~450 episodes and four movies based in that time period, and in staying relatively close to what we've already seen the show would struggle to boldly go anywhere we haven't been before.  Sometime between the TOS and TNG eras.  Let's say it's set on the Enterprise-C.  This could be an interesting way to explore decades worth of important but yet-unseen events (think the halting detente with the Klingons), the concept of stripping away some of the fancier bells and whistles worked decently in ENT, and the knowledge that the ship and crew is ultimately doomed could set up a number of tragic storylines.  The problems are obvious, though; there's still a limit on the ""boldly going"" we could do, and having to maintain continuity with events both past and future would further constrain the writers.  At least a century beyond the TNG/DS9/VOY era.  It'd be a clean break -- completely fresh material for new viewers, new technology and new areas of the galaxy to explore, and decades of wiggle room the writers could use to put the Federation in all sorts of interesting spots.  The biggest drawback I can see with this period is that almost all of the loose ends from prior Trek series -- what happens with occupied Cardassia, the specter of renewed conflict with the Romulans/Dominion/Borg, internal Federation disputes that stem from a utopian society waging back-to-back interstellar wars -- would be wasted.   I'm assuming whatever new show inevitably crops up will be set in the Prime timeline, simply because coordinating a movie franchise with a new TV show is a significant headache from a creative perspective -- and that's before we even start talking about the legal side of things with Paramount and CBS.    I'm partial to Option 1 because it's low-risk (close to stuff we know and like) and high-reward (several compelling conflicts are already set up).  This time period would have to deal with the Hobus Supernova in some way -- it rocks one of the remaining Big Two Alpha Quadrant powers -- but (and this may be getting pedantic) I don't think it should be about that event.  An comparison would be how ST6 features the Praxis disaster but isn't about it; instead, it's about the political fallout, the hawk/dove elements of the Federation and the Klingon Empire, and the fragile possibility of peace in our time."
DaystromInstitute,3bzall,disposable_pants,4,Fri Jul 3 11:21:03 2015 UTC,"2 Sometime between the TOS and TNG eras. Let's say it's set on the Enterprise-C.    Do Enterprise-B, we know what happens to the C.

DaystromInstitute,3bzall,Justice_Prince,4,Fri Jul 3 23:24:51 2015 UTC,Pre-Federation. The USS Enterprise aircraft carrier and the SS Enterprise ring ship are both featured on the show as ships in the Enterprise line without being part of the lettered line.
DaystromInstitute,3bzall,Gnome__Chompsky,3,Fri Jul 3 23:46:49 2015 UTC,"Personally I'd love to see a show that focus more of time travel.  They were using time pods by the 26th century, and patrolling the timelines seems to have become a pretty standard thing by the 29th century so I think they could do something in between there.  Maybe the first real Timeship.  Perhaps the Relativity-A.  This should could still adress a lot of those loose threads, and could actually tie the new movies in with the old series's.    Maybe address why Time Agents never came in to correct the changes to the timeline."
DaystromInstitute,3bzall,Justice_Prince,3,Sat Jul 4 00:35:20 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea.  You're spot on with the positives, and I like the idea of following the first timeship -- humanity would still be learning the ins and outs of time travel and feeling out the kinks in the Temporal Prime Directive, like ENT but with time travel instead of space travel.  But this time there are no Vulcans to guide us because humanity is the first known species to develop reliable time travel.  I do see two potential problems with this idea, though:    It could seriously limit any future Trek series.  The very nature of this idea would add firm bits of canon every few decades for hundreds of years into the future -- imagine the difficulty of working around all that the next time you start a more conventional (fixed in time) set of stories.  It'd be like trying to build a cross country railroad that has to connect to a bunch of bits of track strewn randomly from coast to coast.  The ""Reset Button"" is the bane of dramatic storytelling.  If the audience knows that nothing really will change by the end of the episode, there aren't any real stakes and the conflict is all ultimately meaningless.  A time travel show -- where the focus is on maintaining the pre-existing timeline -- would have to suffer from this malady if its characters were going to be at all successful.  What are the stakes if success means nothing changes?   One thought on this, too:   Maybe address why Time Agents never came in to correct the changes to the timeline.   They probably did correct their timeline, but that doesn't mean their corrections show up in all timelines."

DaystromInstitute,3bzall,Freakears,2,Fri Jul 3 17:29:01 2015 UTC,"The one built-in story in that timeline (the Earth-Romulan War) has some odd continuity requirements built in (atomic weapons, no word of what Romulans actually look like can reach Starfleet) and it would share possibly the thorniest problem of any possibility -- having to stick to firmly established canon rooted just a few decades in both the past and future."
DaystromInstitute,3bzall,disposable_pants,3,Fri Jul 3 22:57:58 2015 UTC,"The ""atomic weapons"" thing: I always justified in my head that Earth, woefully unprepared for an impending attack from an interstellar power, would use any and all weapons at its disposal, including leftover nuclear weapons."
DaystromInstitute,3bzall,BigTaker,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:19:08 2015 UTC,"I just figured the period between Enterprise and TOS is about the same as between TOS and TNG (less when taking the TOS films into account), so it was doable."
DaystromInstitute,3bzall,Freakears,5,Sat Jul 4 03:13:25 2015 UTC,"I think a series that features the supernova as a jumping off point might be viable, but unless we're talking about miniseries-style show (which I'm not opposed to), I feel that having the supernova be the focal point on which the plot revolves just isn't a great format for the sort of seven-season production we're used to.  DS9 did a good job of tying a main character's story arc into established canon right from the start. Wolf 359 is a huge thumbtack in Star Trek history, and using it to propel Sisko's story (and intimately tie him into an existing, beloved character) did wonders for making us care about him.  More importantly, however, DS9 is not about the borg or Wolf 359. While there are stories that involve those themes, they are in the minority.  I think that a similar format could be used to great effect with whatever new series we (hopefully) see in the (hopefully!) near future, and I think that the Hobus Supernova is as good a choice for a big game-changing event as any. Better, possibly, because it can tie the TV universe to the reboot without too much unnecessary interaction between the two.   (edit for: CLARITY)"
DaystromInstitute,3bzall,MrKHackworth,7,Fri Jul 3 14:23:10 2015 UTC,"That would be an interesting approach, given that we know the mission to save Romulus is going to fail.   Overall, from a real-world perspective, I think it was unfair of the reboot films to foist such a continuity-altering plot point onto the Prime Timeline. I would be in favor of any future series set in the Prime Timeline simply ignoring it -- not contradicting it, since that would violate canon policy and piss off fans, but being set long enough after that it doesn't really matter. It seems perverse to me for the Prime Timeline to spend a lot of effort exploring a throw-away plot point from a movie that was trying to get away from the Prime Timeline."
DaystromInstitute,3bzall,adamkotsko,6,Fri Jul 3 11:43:41 2015 UTC,"continuity-altering plot point   Well, technically it altered nothing, since nothing filled that void in the year 2387. In any case, I think you're right that it could be ignored. Space disasters in Star Trek are pretty typically taken lightly. There's no mention at all in TNG about how Kronos, and the rest of the Klingon Empire, has survived the Praxis incident, despite a quite unambiguous diagnosis of fifty years to live. So it'd be a-okay if we flash-forwarded ~80 years and everyone's attitude on Hobus was 'oh yeah, that pretty much sucked, but it only took us a few decades to get back on track with the Federation's help.'"
DaystromInstitute,3bzall,Darth_Rasputin32898,2,Fri Jul 3 15:17:47 2015 UTC,"Technically, that's true -- but I think the continuity was ""altered"" in the sense that previously you could assume that Romulus would continue to exist more or less indefinitely in the Prime Timeline future.  On reflection, I think I drew ""continuity-altering"" from discussions of comics back in the 90s, when Superman was killed and Batman was defeated and briefly replaced -- and in a news story, some writer said that neither writing team initially realized that they were both instituting ""continuity-altering"" changes more or less simultaneously."
DaystromInstitute,3bzall,adamkotsko,2,Fri Jul 3 17:38:03 2015 UTC,"here's no mention at all in TNG about how Kronos, and the rest of the Klingon Empire, has survived the Praxis incident, despite a quite unambiguous diagnosis of fifty years to live.   That diagnosis could have meant the Klingon Empire in its present state would have collapsed within 50 years.  And I don't think that estimation is all that far off -- for all intents and purposes it does collapse after a century at the end of the Dominion War:   It's implied it's no longer a major Alpha Quadrant power, at least for the next decade plus Tons of old-guard warriors and hardliners are killed in the war Martok, Worf, and other reform-minded Klingons are moved into high positions in the Empire's government   My take is that peace with the Federation staved off the inevitable for an additional 50 years, but the post-war Empire we see at the end of DS9 is basically the forecast Starfleet Command had in mind during the events of ST6."
DaystromInstitute,3bzall,disposable_pants,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:11:32 2015 UTC,"I think a series that takes place after the Nova could have stories based around the Major Powers deciding what to do with what is left of the Romulan Star Empire  I would imagine the Klingons wanting to take either everything or perhaps just the border systems. In All Good Things alternate future the Klingons had conquered the Empire by the 2400s  The Federation might try to prop up a friendly government, or at least the descendants of the legitimate government.  I'm not sure who else borders the RSE.  In Star Trek Online the Empire was fractured into several states after the event, There was the Tal'Shiar lead by 'Empress' Sela. There was a small faction lead by Admiral Taris, and another Faction lead by D'Tan, a member of Spock's reunification movement, who formed the 'Romulan Republic', though that didn't come into fruition until 2409"

DaystromInstitute,3bv85b,disposable_pants,42,Thu Jul 2 12:43:06 2015 UTC,It's likely because they find it illogical to be an admiral for more than 30 to 40 years when there's going to be a bunch of younger officers just as or maybe more capable than you to replace you. If they're still interested in serving the Federation then they'll transfer to an Ambassadorship or to somewhere like Starfleet Academy.
DaystromInstitute,3bv85b,SlasherX,28,Thu Jul 2 13:57:36 2015 UTC,"This is a very good point. Organizations with lots and lots of tenure end up with folks in the same positions for years and years, and this limits the career paths of younger folks, who then leave the organization as they don't see a path forward. This also has the effect of limiting creativity and new approaches to problems (""well, this is way we have always done it..."")  Vulcans being very logical and perceptive would see this and understand that the logical thing to do is to not spend huge amounts of time in such positions, to best enable Starfleet to grow and evolve."
DaystromInstitute,3bv85b,CaptainJeff,5,Thu Jul 2 14:21:31 2015 UTC,"Organizations with lots and lots of tenure end up with folks in the same positions for years and years, and this limits the career paths of younger folks, who then leave the organization as they don't see a path forward.   The vast majority of Starfleet officers will never sniff Captain, let alone Admiral.  We also see Captains who are reluctant to move up to Admiral because that's too far removed from the action.  Getting to Admiral is extremely difficult already; I'm not convinced that making it a bit more difficult would turn a significant number of good officers away from Starfleet.   This also has the effect of limiting creativity and new approaches to problems (""well, this is way we have always done it..."")   This seems like exactly the type of ego-based trap Vulcans have specifically trained themselves not to fall into.  How many times have we heard Vulcans say ""we must consider all possibilities""?"
DaystromInstitute,3bv85b,redwall_hp,4,Thu Jul 2 21:38:29 2015 UTC,"Because Vulcans live so long they can easily man a post for 30-40 years without age-related decline in abilities.  That experience should be extremely valuable, too -- how would they conclude that someone with zero experience as an Admiral and (only) 15 years experience as a Captain would be as capable as them or better?"
DaystromInstitute,3bv85b,cmlondon13,22,Thu Jul 2 21:41:11 2015 UTC,"Well, Starfleet obviously has different ""tracks"" within their organisation. Perhaps Vulcans tend to favour Science positions over Command, which places them out of the chain leading to the admiralty. (Instead, promotions would lead to, say, running a research team on a starbase or teaching at the Academy or being on Starfleet scientific committees.) We've seen characters switch tracks (Worf changed between Command and Operations multiple times), but it's probably not the norm for people who end up as admirals."
DaystromInstitute,3bv85b,Aperture_Kubi,5,Thu Jul 2 15:04:34 2015 UTC,"I would think switching tracks would be common -- there are clear junior roles for both the tactical/security/engineering track and the science/medical track, but what type of job would there be for an Ensign or Lieutenant in the command track?  The equivalent of back office duties?"
DaystromInstitute,3bv85b,ademnus,8,Thu Jul 2 21:50:15 2015 UTC,"Lieutenants and Ensigns from Command are usually the ones flying the ship. But I also think that being on the Command track doesn't necessarily mean you wear red (or gold for TOS era). I think uniform color is more an indicator of present role and/or chosen specialty, which in the command branch is an emphasis on leadership, tactical/strategic analysis, and ship handling. But that doesn't mean an officer in Ops or Science can't hold command. A good example is Spock, who is XO of the Enterprise, a clear Command role, yet he still wore blue to signify his role as Science Officer, or Crusher, who was able to run the bridge, and possibly make captain, while still being a Doctor and part of Science branch."
DaystromInstitute,3bv85b,mmmkunz,65,Thu Jul 2 23:06:16 2015 UTC,"Vulcans are still sightly xenophobic, A carryover from ST:Enterprise era. Back then they always looked down on humans, and the first two Vulcans (in universe chronologically) we see have previous ties to humans, T'pol had Carbon Creek and Spock had his human mother. They'll acknowledge Starfleet, but mostly will not enter it themselves. Think of modern Germany, their attitude towards anything military is ""let the Americans do it,"" (noted from an /r/askreddit about Germany and their WWII vets) so perhaps Vulcan does this as well. (edit: as other people are saying I have that Germany detail wrong, but the same after effect still about stands)  That could also explain an ""all Vulcan ship"" we see in TOS and DS9. If the captain can curate their crew, that's probably the best explanation for preferring one race over another. Also on a side note, replace Vulcan with any other human ethnicity and that's just racist.   Vulcans have moved on from external science and exploration, meaning they have entered an era of philosophy and self-discovery and no longer have a desire to explore the universe. We also saw the beginnings of this in ST:E when T'pol went mentioned Vulcan procedures for exploration and Archer and crew had the reaction of ""What!? Yeah no we're going down there."" Their exploration drive just wasn't there compared to humans', which brings me to my third possibility.  No one else in the galaxy has the same drive for exploration as humans, which covers why we see humans so overly represented on screen."
DaystromInstitute,3bv85b,ademnus,11,Thu Jul 2 13:34:53 2015 UTC,"I think if we relate to the Vulcans, we see they're not so different after all.   they always looked down on humans   I think they were where humans are a thousand years ago and it's natural to see us that way.

We just can't do much about the US throwing it's weight around, as is the case for most other countries.   However there is still a connection to be made here between WW2 and Vulcans attitudes post Enterprise. As the Americans came into a war they could have avoided and made the German public aware of the bigger picture, Earth got involved with the Vulcan/Andorian conflict and made the Vulcan command look like very naughty boys."

Yup, that's EXACTLY what I was thinking of.   Germany sat by for two years letting genocide and rape occur day and night.   No, we (very shamefully IMO) manufactured and sold the weaponry. As is the tradition, if you are providing the weapons, you don't interfere with their use until many years later - see the US or UKs arms sales.    Eventually the USA interceded    Yes, they came in with an embargo, which we would (again shamefully) have objected to if we had a say. Unfortunately for the German arms industry, the countries that wanted an embargo just happened to be all the other big arms producing nations, and Germany wasn't allowed a say (cos it wasn't allowed onto the UN security council).   and put an end to the conflict.    No, the US did not put an end to the conflict. NATO did. There were 32 nations involved, IIRC, including Germany. Once America wants, it gets.   the Americans had to come in and stop the genocide occurring two nations away from yours.    The Americans didn't HAVE to do anything. They wanted to.   Let's make a new comparison  - in the late 24th century, Star Trek is a historical docu drama, in the style of, say, Band of Brothers, produced by the Federations most advanced media propagandists, Earth.   Now, like Band of Brothers, while being historically almost exactly accurate, this will take the viewpoint of the American - or Human - that has produced it, and thus will concentrate mainly on the people of it's own culture, even if they are selling the program onto Teller Prime (the UK) and Andoria (France/Poland..take your pick!). We could be seeing the Enterprises, DS9 etc because these are the most important Federation events in Earths history, not the most important events in the Federations history. Spock is a Churchill, and the token Vulcans and Andorians shown on the incarnations of the Enterprise are simply STs version of the Scottish tank commanders in BoB  And there will be people on Earth - and maybe even on Vulcan, Andoria and Teller Prime  - who truly believe that the Earth (American) led Fed/Klingon war (Vietnam) was a 'win' for the Federation, or that the Dominion War (Bosnia) was won by an almost all human Federation team."

Looking at the list of admirals most of the names I recognize (I didn't click through every single one) are involved in Starfleet Security or Starfleet Tactical, or generally have jurisdictions that have something to do with Starfleet's defense concerns. It's been suggested that certain species gravitate toward certain roles, and while we've certainly seen vulcan starship commanders (as well as several admirals involved in war planning), we also know that vulcans have a preference for scientific and diplomatic pursuits. To wit, if characters were calling the head of Starfleet Medical or Starfleet Cartography or whoever, we might very well see more vulcan admirals on screen.  Another possibility in the vein of the ""homo sapiens only club"" idea is that rather than some species pushing others out as a matter of racism or anything like that, it could just be a matter of proximity advantage: humans are from the capital, and growing up in the beating heart of Federation politics furnishes them with an advantage if they pursue a career in Starfleet."

Vulcans do seem to fit in on the Enterprise D so their lack of appearance (and even Picard's unfamiliarity with Vulcan government and its lack of defenses) suggests that the majority of the population is still insular yet pacifist.  Deep Space Nine When Ezri is trying to narrow down Vulcan officers who have served on Deep Space Nine, she has so many results that it takes her hours to figure out who it is and even then, it's by serendipity.  That would suggest Vulcans are keen on contributing to the Dominion War in relative numbers to say nothing of their reputation in holosuite programs.  A guess might be that they prefer stationary or specified duties to match up with their seven year cycle compared to Starfleet ships like the Enterprise D which went everywhere with a decent risk of deadening.  Not to ruin all this, but the real explanation is the special effects budget and the writing.  Even a pair of ears adds more cost even if it's just an extra 4 background extras per episode and the writers never kept track of secondary characters until late DS9 and parts of Voyager."
DaystromInstitute,3bv85b,the_raptor,8,Fri Jul 3 04:47:46 2015 UTC,"Humans are more prevalent among officers in Starfleet simply by virtue of Starfleet Academy being on Earth. Starfleet is staffed (Either exclusively or predominantly) by graduates of SFA. For many member races, relocating to Earth in order to receive an education is simply not the most favorable option, when they have schools and fleets of their own in which they can receive their higher education and training in their chosen field. Just like many Americans with the means to relocate to Europe to receive higher education choose not to, and vice-versa.   Starfleet Academy is also one of, if not the only, option for a human who desires a career in quasi-military service to the Federation. Vulcans and many other races are shown to have their own fleets for areas of service and exploration, separate from the federation, however there is no civilian Earth fleet. If a young Tellarite wants to explore the stars, they can do so on a Tellarite ship.  Additionally, SFA is essentially a military academy. The home worlds of other member races have their own military traditions and lineages, which would hold higher honor and standing among their people than service in the unified Starfleet would. For example, an Andorian could gain more standing and glory among other Andorians in serving in the Andorian fleet, leading to a more gratifying career. A modern analogue would be someone joining the military of their country rather than joining the French Foreign Legion.  Again, due to its role as a military academy, Starfleet Academy simply cannot recruit those who want to be the best in certain fields. A Vulcan who wants to be a xenobotanist would see no logic in attending the academy, where she would be required to expend effort and time that could be spent learning at a science-specialized institution on Vulcan, and serving in the Vulcan fleet, or under the purview of the Vulcan Science Academy.   When you add to those personal motivations, there are also societal reasons why academy age students would not choose SFA for their higher learning. Not every race prides itself in the selfless service that the Academy, and Starfleet in general cherish; the Bolians for example, still have a capitalism-based economy, as evidenced by the existence of the Bank of Bolias. The generally few Betazoids could be due to their unease with verbal communication, something that they feel they have outgrown once their telepathic abilities manifest in puberty.  Many of the non-human Starfleet personnel that we know the origins of are detached from their own society, either by mixed parentage (Spock, Troi, K'Ehleyr, Torres), or exposure and assimilation to Federation values as a child (Worf, Nog), or have no home world (Data). To these people, the welcoming Starfleet Academy would be a home in a way that their race’s home world would not be.  TL;DR: Humans don’t have other choices, others do, Starfleet Academy is all the other Federation races’ “backup school”"

Most Western militaries use an ""up or out"" system so as to not fall under the Peter principle where incompetent officers get stuck a grade above their ability.  The Federation might be more kind and allow non-command ""officers"" to stick around (there are an awful lot of perpetual Lts in canon), but I can't see them having a system where people can progress to flag rank through tenacious mediocrity."

And it so makes sense when you remember that all astronauts by this point were military officers, so a ship full of astronauts in the future should logically be officers as well. You're right, it's not realistic, but I can see the reasoning behind it."
DaystromInstitute,3bv85b,CaptainJeff,5,Thu Jul 2 19:20:17 2015 UTC,"It's probably because Starfleet is much more important to human culture than it is to Vulcan culture. Starfleet was established after humanity recovered from WW3 and was the defense and exploration organization for all of earth, and most of humanity. It began as a symbol of a unified human race and represents the best and brightest humans have to offer. Even though Starfleet has expanded since the formation of the Federation, it still has an important place in human culture.  The Vulcans on the other hand, have had interstellar travel for at least 2,000 years. They've had a unified Vulcan government for close to 2,000 years. They have their own defense fleet and science ministry. So while Starfleet may represent ideals the Vulcans value, like Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations, it just doesn't have the same significance to Vulcan culture."
DaystromInstitute,3bv85b,Hyndis,9,Thu Jul 2 23:20:34 2015 UTC,"Vulcans just don't give a shit about Starfleet. If you're a Vulcan raised on Vulcan, going into Starfleet makes you look plain weird; Spock is the only one to ever turn down admission into the Vulcan Science Academy, and there is probably significant overlap between the VSA and Starfleet.  Actually, there's a simpler answer. We've only seen 50 admirals on-screen. That's a pretty terrible sample size, seeing that the amount of flag officers in Starfleet must number in the thousands. Those Vulcan admirals exist, we just haven't seen them. They don't completely outnumber humans because Vulcans like retirement."

I don't think we have seen anything to support that. We have no idea about the common lifespans of any other Federation races, of which there are many. We also do not know too much about average human lifespans. We do know from some on-screen evidence that it's much longer than in the 20th century. So, perhaps Vulcans do not live significnatly longer than other races, potentially including humans. Even if they do...why would a longer lifespan directly imply a longer career? Perhaps Vulcans do their time in service (Starfleet, something else) and then go and do something else. Having a second career in retirement is an emerging trend in the early 21st century...perhaps it has become standard (for Vulcans anyway) in the future."
DaystromInstitute,3bv85b,calgil,15,Thu Jul 2 13:06:48 2015 UTC,"Vulcan life spans are certainly longer than that of humans. Human lifespans in the 24th century are, at most, about 120-130 years. Even with advanced medical care the person will be suffering from their advanced age.  The oldest human to appear in canon was Admiral Leonard McCoy, who was 137. He certainly looked it. He didn't have the vigor of youth anymore.  Vulcans do also suffer from the ravages of old age, but due to their significantly longer lifespan they will still have decades of youthful vigor, long after humans have passed away from old age.  Most other species also have quite long lifespans. Bajorans, Klingons and Ferengi all commonly live well over a century.  Human lifespans are on the shorter end of known species, it seems. Yet for some reason a large percentage of Starfleet's admirals are human.  Perhaps a short lifespan produces ambition. You're not going to live forever, so do something while you're still alive. A species with a long lifespan might not be in a rush to get anything done. Why hurry? They've got centuries.  This could also explain why multiple other civilizations are so stagnant. They've had technological civilization for far longer than Earth and yet Earth has eclipsed them all. Vulcans were downright frightened of how quickly human technology was advancing. It took Vulcans far longer to go from nuclear war to warp drive. Humans did it almost immediately. Ferengi had commerce for close to 10,000 years but not warp drive. They only invented warp drive a few years before Earth did. Bajor really takes the cake for being old yet accomplishing little. Bajoran civilization is 500,000 years old. Bajoran civilization is older than the Borg. Bajoran civilization is older than the Iconians. Yes, its that old. Yet Bajorian scientific advancement has proceeded at a snail's pace. Bajorans were crushed by the new up and coming Cardassians who were so much better at science and technology than Bajorans."

Even worse than that. It might be contradicted by other stuff, but in ""Little Green Men"" Rom says that the Ferengi only got warp technology because they bought it from someone.  I do agree that Star Trek's humans seem to be legitimately exceptional.  Humans have gained a massive amount of political clout in a ridiculously short period of time, their technological is advancing at a ridiculous rate, and the Federation (which isn't strictly human, but it was founded by humans) was able to hold its own vs the Klingons, Cardassians, Dominion, and Borg at different times.  As if that weren't enough, it's suggested that humans aren't even consistently living up to their potential yet. The Q seem to think humans might surpass them some day, and aliens like the Traveler seem interested in humans as well.  It's kind of a cop out to answer OP's question with ""because humans are just better,"" but human-exceptionalism really does seem to be an underlying trait of the franchise. Heck, in the same scene where Rom says the Ferengi had to buy warp tech, he's actually in the middle of a speech about how quickly humans are advancing."

An unskilled, clumsy, slow-witted Klingon will have a short lifespan. Conversely, a highly skilled, agile, and clever Klingon will live a very long time. Old age will eventually catch up to them, but they might have an active military career spanning well over a century.  This is the curse of being too powerful a warrior to die on the battlefield. The best warriors succumb not to a warrior's death, but to old age. There is no other warrior who can best them; only time can defeat them. A dishonorable death indeed.  Kor was one such outstanding warrior who could not find death in honorable combat because he was so skilled in the arts of war. In the 2260's he had achieved the rank of commander. A new recruit does not do this. This means he had been a skilled warrior well before the 2260's. He had earned his rank.  Dahar Master Kor was still leading warriors into battle in the 2370's, over a century later. By that time the ravages of old age were catching up to him, but he was still such a formidable warrior that he defeated Worf, a man a fraction of his age, in a matter of seconds. Kor's cunning was such that Worf was down before he knew what had happened.  Then Dahar Master Kor went on to take a small Bird of Prey and held off an entire Dominion fleet. By himself.

DaystromInstitute,3bv85b,androidbitcoin,4,Wed Jul 8 21:03:38 2015 UTC,"I've had a fairly controversial opinion here that I think satisfies the reason why we see so many hoo-mans: Starfleet is an Earth-based armada. It may operate under the UFP overall, but it's an Earth-based, and thus primarily human, endeavour.   Of all the Starfleet ships we've seen, they are majority-manned by humans. Starfleet ships are 99% named after human people, places, events, or ancient human ships. There are more ships named for fallen Klingons (the USS Gorkon: http://en.memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/USS_Gorkon) than there are for all other UFP member races (actually zero) save the Vulcans, which come in at two starships that have Vulcan names that I could find: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Trek_Starfleet_starships_ordered_by_class  In the UFP, Earth is charged with maintaining and staffing Starfleet. The non-humans on Starfleet ships could mean Starfleet is open to all member races, or it could be that these people have Earth citizenship (or both).   It's also probable that most of the UFP member planets are colonized by humans. And humans are the most numerous species in the UFP."
DaystromInstitute,3bv85b,JamesTiberiusChirp,2,Fri Jul 3 10:30:42 2015 UTC,"Vulcans may tend to disapprove of the more expansionistic/militaristic aspects of Starfleet and may generally prefer to contribute to the Federation in other ways (like the diplomatic corps, as you suggest). That, coupled with a human race that seems to be much more numerous, would result in a Starfleet that has many times more humans than Vulcans, while still allowing for periodic exceptional Vulcans like Spock, Tuvok, and the ship of all Vulcans from TOS."
DaystromInstitute,3bv85b,DJCaldow,2,Fri Jul 3 03:18:25 2015 UTC,"Wasn't Spock the first Vulcan in Starfleet? I'm not sure whether that fact has been kind of ignored but I'm pretty sure it's mentioned in TOS, and that he was looked down for doing so and shunning the ""superior"" Vulcan Science Academy (see also Sarek being a dick in Journey to Babel, though I can't remember if the ""first Vulcan in SF"" factoid is from that particular episode). Any older officers from the TOS era would have been people who joined later in life, and possibly might be more junior despite their age. This may explain why you don't see as many high ranking Vulcan officers, even by the TOS movie era, as compared to humans.  Edit: also, while Vulcans aren't saints, let's not forget that they may not have the same predisposition to rising the ranks as their human counterparts. On multiple occasions, Spock denied that he has any desire to command, and readily stepped down in WOK so Kirk could take the comm. Depending on how you feel about Galileo 7, he's arguably a terrible commanding officer and potentially not even a logical one in some situations. Of course, you can't judge an entire race by the attitudes and actions of a single person, but as others have posited here, Vulcans just may have less of a drive for power and less of an ability to command their more feeling colleagues."

With colonies on hundreds of planets, there won't be the issue of space that we have now.    I have one child, and soon my wife and I will begin the process of having another.  The reasons we'll stop there are lack of money, lack of time and lack of freedom associated with children.  In the future, these will be much less of a concern.  If we need to take any amount of time off to care for children, we'll take it.  Great grandparents will remain alive and healthy to help care for future generations, perhaps even great, great grandparents.  Advances in medicine and education will allow children to be healthy and well taught with less input from parents.  Why would people not choose to have multiple children under those conditions?  In Humans there is no physical barrier, which is why I believe you see mostly humans on the show.  Vulcans only mate every 7 years, Andorrians require 4 parents, Denobulans mate during a single season, etc.  In nature, predators that mate without limits are very rare, and so it's not inconcievable that you would see most species have similar limits.  Humanity is probably the outlier, which will allow us the ability to simply outbreed the other races in the federation."

We also saw in VOY Repentance that force fields in the brig can be manipulated to allow food to be passed through a small opening.   We also hear mentions of ""level X"" force fields thorughough each series. Perhaps various levels have different amounts of permeability in addition to differences in strength?"
DaystromInstitute,3btrss,williams_482,12,Thu Jul 2 02:26:46 2015 UTC,"This may be the strongest answer that explains each scenario.

DaystromInstitute,3btrss,Sparkle_Chimp,5,Thu Jul 2 04:01:26 2015 UTC,"This is correct. According to the TNG Technical Manual, the on-board fire supression system works this way, by using a forcefield to surround the fire and deprive it of oxygen."

They clearly are not perfectly immutable, static surfaces."

DaystromInstitute,3btrss,boldra,2,Thu Jul 2 13:15:26 2015 UTC,The simplest answer is the brig chambers have open comm units in them that broadcast to the outside of the force field so officers can communicate with people in the brig. There is no need for the force field to be air permeable or for it to vibrate in response to sound. They could also probably be set to one way comm so security could listen in while the prisoner was in silence.

DaystromInstitute,3bttqk,Owyn_Merrilin,14,Thu Jul 2 02:30:47 2015 UTC,"The term ""vernal"" (a dated term meaning springlike or related to spring), is used in astronomical coordinate systems to refer to the point or region of sky defined by the vernal equinox. Its nature as a section of the Galaxy rather then a different galaxy was made clear by a statement from Captain Christopher Pike in ""The Cage"", where while on Talos he claimed he was ""from a stellar group at the other end of this galaxy."". The term ""Vernal Galaxy"" in the official Starfleet Command report was used in a sentence without a ""the"" preceding it, and was written completely in lowercase letters despite several important words being written in all caps.   http://en.memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Vernal_Galaxy"
DaystromInstitute,3bttqk,caribou16,4,Thu Jul 2 02:49:31 2015 UTC,"That actually makes it even more confusing -- the ""vernal point"" is one of two points at which, during the earth's orbit around the sun, the celestial equator (i.e., a ring expanding from the earth's equator to an arbitrary or infinite distance) intersects with the ecliptic. In other words. it's a term even in astronomy that is closely tied to the seasons of a planet. I'm sure you could change your reference points (for example, the vernal point of Mars would be different from the vernal point of Earth), and you might even be able to expand it to larger reference points -- say, the vernal point of an entire solar system and the galactic center -- but I'm still not clear on what frame of reference in which this would make sense for a region of an entire galaxy.  Edit: Unless, maybe, considering the references to ""Earth ships"" rather than ""Federation vessels,"" it's a region around the vernal point of Earth's solar system and the galactic center?

So the idea that they could travel to another galaxy should have been ruled out when ""The Menagerie"" was written, if that indeed is what the writers intended to convey with ""vernal galaxy."" ""Galaxy"" was, as far as I'm aware, well-established by 1966 as meaning what it means now, so it would be strange if ""galaxy"" meant something else.  It could mean the portion of the Milky Way visible during the spring (in the northern hemisphere, I guess), though it would be rather odd to name anything like that, particularly when identifying a star system and planet for navigational purposes.  It could also be a strange alternate nomenclature from the mid-23rd Century. Maybe instead of Alpha/Beta/Gamma/Delta quandrants they went with Vernal/Summer/Autumnal/Winter? That would be really weird, but it would work, I guess.  Or, hey, maybe it's a typographical error. Some clerk meant to write ""sector"" but instead wrote ""galaxy."" Or maybe a translation error.

I think you can probably argue that Earth basically dragooned its whole Starfleet into the new Federation Starfleet (perhaps, if for no other reason, than because with new technology coming from the other, better-established founding worlds, they'd need to replace the fleet wholesale anyways and it would be easiest to do that with the whole Federation's resources*), and so even a century later it could be considered Earth's fleet. Maybe Starfleet's relationship with the rest of the member worlds changed over the course of the 23rd Century.  /* - I mean, when you really get down to it, Starfleet's traditions and laws are very much based on Human -- and specifically American and British -- traditions and laws. Even in the 24th Century, Starfleet seems to be overwhelmingly human, even if we ignore the actors' appearances but base it purely on organization, law, and customs."
DaystromInstitute,3bttqk,jerslan,3,Thu Jul 2 05:19:57 2015 UTC,"I have to imagine that has something to do with where the ship was commissioned, built, and launched. Canonically, all the ships we've seen have been launched from Utopia Planetia, correct? I have to imagine there are other shipyards elsewhere, in other major systems, crewing up from the local staff.  Similarly, I know that San Francisco is a big deal in the canon, but are we really to believe that the entire Federation only has one officer school? Surely there are satellites of the Academy elsewhere, or at least training facilities.   TL:DR I think that the human-centric sampling is just that -- a very specific sample from ships launched in Earth's backyard. And that raises a ton of its own questions."

There are a number of reasons, the least of which being that they frequently contradict each other. The main reason is that the show was written before everyone picked apart every single detail of a show. So while there was a sort of writers bible, even back then? It wasn't super detailed or fleshed out like it might be with most modern day shows.  The result being wildly different results depending on who wrote the episode and how much editorial control Roddenberry and/or the Network exerted over it. Honestly, this same level of inconsistency is also why people find the first couple seasons of TNG a little off-putting. By Season 3 they started nailing details down and it was basically from then on that Star Trek had some pretty regular consistency."

""Vernal,"" meaning ""of, in, or appropriate to spring,"" was a Starfleet classification for star systems that effectively meant ""exhibiting promising conditions for life or settlement"" (using ""spring-like"" somewhat poetically to refer to life in general).   The phrase ""third quadrant of vernal galaxy,"" therefore, meant that Talos IV had previously been classified within the third quartile of galactic star systems (or planets) that exhibited promising conditions for settlement. This order removed Talos IV from that classification, indicating that the planet was actually not suitable for human life and recommending that no human ever visit it again.  Regarding the repeated mentions of Spock's race, note that the order specifies that only one Earth ship ever visited Talos IV, and that no human should ever visit it again. Because the order specifically barred humans from an otherwise promising star system, Starfleet wanted to note that a (half) Vulcan concurred in their judgment, to record that this wasn't solely a human issue and to avoid any possible accusations of racism, either in favor of humans or against them.  I'm not sure there's any evidence to support this, but it seems to make sense."

There would've been no love between the Terrans and Klingons before the Enterprise-C could have changed history, but as it likely would not (watch the battle, then destroy the survivor) then the Klingons would have decided sometime after that, that they had had enough of the Terrans, allied with fhe Cardassians and carved up Mirror Spock's reformed Empire.  Perhaps an Alternate TNG starship (a generation after the current movie spinoffs) is shifted to this mirror universe of post-Terran Empire."

She could have advocated on behalf of the continuum with a Prime Directive argument, and made a deal with the devil so to speak to guarantee a good outcome.  She could have done so much more."
DaystromInstitute,3br5t7,thesynod,12,Wed Jul 1 16:51:27 2015 UTC,"While being demoted might be motive enough for some command structures to become a full blown traitor, I find it hard to swallow that it would be something Carey would do. He's a trained Starfleet officer and understands the chain of command. That includes the Captain making a decision to put some young punk who didn't even go to the Academy (Westley) or some ex-maqui in command. He also had a wife and a family back home. If he did betray Voyager there would be a huge risk he'd never see them again, or be imprisioned for the rest of his life when he got back, his reputation ruined.   It would have been interesting to see Seska actually take a less aggressive turn, admit to Janeway she is a Cardassian spy, but now she's stuck with them. After a difficult transition, she earns a commission and becomes the first Cardassian Starfleet member."

And a good counterpoint to the Seven storyline; on the one side we have someone carrying guilt about malicious acts against her comrades and their people that she had no culpability in, and on the other we have someone carrying no guilt at all about malicious acts against her comrades and their people for which she was fully consciously responsible. ""Outsiders brought into the fold"" was in some sense the most consistent theme of Voyager, more so than any other Trek (Maquis, Neelix & Kes, the Doc, Seven) and it would have been a solid addition to that motif."
DaystromInstitute,3br5t7,sindeloke,5,Wed Jul 1 19:34:51 2015 UTC,"She would have had no one who trusted her on the ship, Starfleet or Maqui. Not to mention the Bajorans who harbor even more resentment to the Cardassian people. If she had the traditional Cardassian ""superiority complex"", it would have been hard for her to follow orders from Starfleet, or Maqui. She would have been completely ostracized, but eventually after proving herself, people get to trust her a little bit more at a time. They could have made her a little lot less of the ""sinister evil antagonist who just gets a kick out of doing bad things"" and a little more like Garak, in a more sneaky, lighter-hearted Cardassian.

If they kept Carey for a few more episodes, they could have replaced Michael Jonas with him in ""Investigations"". The reveal that a Starfleet officer is conspiring with an enemy will force Janeway to reexamine how she feels about the Maquis, since she suspected one of them so much she kept her first officer in the dark about it."

Because of that, their cross-section, so to say, for corruption is markedly higher.    As such, the malfunction affected all main characters, rendering their visuals as Data and imbuing them with Data-type characteristics."

It's the difference between a named NPC with dialogue trees and complex question condition flags, and N instances of a guard who used to be an adventurer like you before he took an arrow in the knee.

DaystromInstitute,3bs9x9,BestCaseSurvival,2,Thu Jul 2 01:19:56 2015 UTC,Because the replacement was somewhat random. The information from Data's brain didn't replace all replicator programs or all musical programs. The replacement was sporadic and unpredictable.
DaystromInstitute,3bqr93,adamkotsko,27,Wed Jul 1 11:42:44 2015 UTC,"Just as Roddenberry said when referring to Picards Baldness, ""in the future, nobody would care"".  The on screen world is portrayed as predominantly straight but that might be more for TV value than anything else.   But it would surprise me if homosexual relationships didn't happen in the future because their whole attitude toward ""things we aren't used to""  is very different. It has to be for them to be accepting of the different species they encounter.    In DS9, Jadzia had a relationship with Lenara. It wasn't portrayed as ""taboo"" or even unusual, but was broken off because Dax was re associating with romantic relationships from a past life. Something that's been repeatedly stated as a no no for the Trill.  Memory Alpha tackles this one well, and seems to support that things weren't pushed for quite so hard because of the TV style at the time.   In universe, and taking from Rodenberrys ""in the future no one would care"" statement and design,, Data might have been programmed with a preference, but it's likely he was programmed with techniques applicable to many different species and genders because it's not taboo in the future. He would have the ability to learn and research sex and relationships if need be.   But one thing that's important to me is that Data, in his quest to become more human, may have had the ability to choose his orientation, or even had it randomly assigned.   It's very evident that even if Data doesn't have an emotion chip, he has 'some' basic level of emotion.   He has to in order to develop attachments to people and things. His Cat, Spot, Tasha, even the book Picard gave him that he packs into a bag fondly in 'The Measure of a Man', and while it's possible to program that behavior in, there seems to be plenty of evidence to support that Data had a choice, and developed these things, these attachments, affinities, and the fondness he feels for people and things, on his own.   Therefore to me it's entirely possible that Dara's sexuality could be determined by preference. A preference that he determined on his own.   It's very difficult to suggest that he is straight, or bi, because there's little evidence of him being anything other than straight, but there is plenty of evidence to suggest that he could have developed his own sexual identity, just as anyone else. And to me that makes it possible and plausible that he would be capable of it."
DaystromInstitute,3bqr93,breenisgreen,2,Wed Jul 1 12:12:38 2015 UTC,I see what you're saying about Data and I agree he might well have a say in his orientation - since he can reprogram himself - but I'm not sure in the real world sexual orientation is much of a choice. Maybe I misunderstood you though. Anyway this is also tangential to ST.
DaystromInstitute,3bqr93,gatlin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:20:42 2015 UTC,I apologize. I wasn't trying to imply that sexual orientation is a choice in the real world. I'm somewhat conflicted on whether Data would have had the choice or whether it was decided for him either by Soongh or a simple random number generator. It's the biggest part that simply has me stuck
DaystromInstitute,3bqr93,breenisgreen,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:39:12 2015 UTC,"No worries! Thanks for the clarification. And yeah, your theory is interesting."
DaystromInstitute,3bqr93,gatlin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:21:07 2015 UTC,"It's very evident that even if Data doesn't have an emotion chip, he has 'some' basic level of emotion.    I don't agree with that.  It's certainly possible, but I don't think it's evidently so.  Recall that Data's goal is to become more human, and he has, by the time we see the behaviors you cite, had a great deal of time to observe them.  I certainly think he developed the attachments, affinities, and the appearance of fondness on his own, but that doesn't necessarily mean that there's actual emotion underlying them.  Humans, certainly, can convey the trappings of emotions they don't really feel.  A sociopath can seem quite empathetic, even though he isn't, simply because he knows he needs to. Even an ordinary person will fake sadness and sympathy, or laugh at an unfunny joke when it's expected of them.  Data has demonstrated a number of times that he's quite capable of such emotional fakery.  For example, during his brief romance in In Theory, he seems puts on a good show (albeit one not lacking in gaffes and faux pas) but it ultimately falls apart because Jenna realizes that however it might seem he feels nothing for her.  His response is to delete the subroutines responsible for his romantic behavior and continue going about his day.  Data's displays of attachment are essentially a Chinese Room—it's impossible to know whether they're genuine, or simply an unusually effective manifestation of Data's emotionless emulation of human behavior.  Of course, you could say the same about his very consciousness, (and indeed Cmdr Maddox did say it in Measure of a Man,) but there I think the intentions of the writers are much more clear.  Except for that one episode, rarely is Data's sentience questioned—but his lack of emotions is an often reiterated point.  Ultimately, Data's goal is to become more human, and emulation of human behavior, emotion included, is certainly in keeping with that goal."

There are gay (LGBT) people in China, gay Native Americans, gay New Zealanders, gay Alaskans, gay South Africans, gay Europeans, etc. Even if somehow everyone was out and could be tracked down, the likelihood of such an endeavor wiping out the spectrum of sexual orientation and gender identity is ludicrous.   Not only do I find that theory in bad taste, given that it makes a whole segment of Trek fans feel like they don't belong in the world of Star Trek, but I believe it to be in err due to a misunderstanding of science."

He is emotionally and socially stunted/immature at the period we see, assuming he didn't die in Nemesis and continued on maybe he would explore other sexualities over the eons as he became more adept. He can literally change his programming to do so, maybe he'd just become some kind of cross-species pansexual.  Also if you think about it Data isn't human, even though he is a life form his species isn't human so every time he engages in sex with humans it is technically inter-species sex.

I believe the null hypothesis should be that Data is pansexual—meaning not limited by biological sex, gender, or gender identity—by default, and any further evidence should be weighed against his pansexuality as a default. While we've only seen Data in one romantic relationship, that relationship was initiated by the other person, and I honestly believe could have just as easily been initiated by an Ensign John D'Sora as an Ensign Jenna D'Sorna, or by an individual who does not fall into a gender binary."

(Source: http://en.memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/2010s )  For this reason, Data considers other ways humans have contemplated philosophy alongside his need to stay out of history's way. He turns his options over in his head, thoroughly examining each one. He could join an order of monks. He could become a hermit, living so deep and secretly in wild territory that sightings of him are considered urban legend.

His memory was temporarily conked out when he was stuck in the village with the radioactive material, yet he was still able to make new tech and figured out the cause of the suck villagers"
DaystromInstitute,3bp31k,dxdydxdy,10,Wed Jul 1 00:25:18 2015 UTC,"Yes he is. And yes, it's not directly using his explicit knowledge of the future. However, you're using computational resources that would otherwise not have been useable. Therefore, you're taking advantage of future technology, which is precisely what Picards instructions would forbid in this scenario. What makes this worse is that you're not simply having an additional supercomputer, you're having a future supercomputer that can think and innovate (an unthinkably huge leap forward from todays computers)."
DaystromInstitute,3bp31k,gc3,6,Wed Jul 1 01:04:27 2015 UTC,Does not compute. (Older TOS computer shutting down due to the contradictory order).
DaystromInstitute,3bp31k,TheHYPO,1 point,Wed Jul 1 07:52:52 2015 UTC,"This is a fictional what-if, and although you're making assumptions based on knowing what Picard would order, OP didn't say that Data couldn't participate in technological improvements; just that he couldn't be the source of the information of what the future holds.  I agree that if someone was actually giving orders, yours would be the most likely (he would probably be ordered simply to avoid interfering in the timeline period, and would likely move to a cave somewhere or destroy himself a la Terminator 2).  But I think the OP is coming up with a purely hypothetical, outside of the Star Trek world, if you just happened to have a Data-like android today, with no knowledge of the future, what would be the best use for it... ?"

As for how he could be used to benefit current day humans, he may  be most helpful in helping analyze data on DNA for use in medical research. Since he would not be directly creating new tech, his help in analyzing data we already have access to would possibly just help us get things done more quickly and efficiently."

DaystromInstitute,3bp31k,Hellstrike,3,Wed Jul 1 00:56:30 2015 UTC,"Assuming this was for a mission, I think the more apt question would be how will Data use the Earth's resources?  If it was an emergency and Picard's last words were don't let them catch on to future tech, and only that, Data stupid destroy himself, or go live underwater out something for 300 years. If Picard's last words were instead a sub-order (i.e. Data is sent there to do something, and concealing future tech is the secondary objective) then I see Data finding a way to get access to some resources and attempt to be incognito until he can complete his mission.  The radioactive episode was messy because both Data and the world around him were discovering his abilities for the first time.  If he knew he had to be low key, I see him being very good at it.    The most likely scenario is of course government intervention and attempts at understanding and replication.   Thus Terminator: Genysis"

I'd suggest annexing the surrounding species as soon as possible and create the Terran Star Empire until 2100.  Edit: Just to make it clear, we already have a different timeline than the prime universe.

DaystromInstitute,3bp31k,jonnyta,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:47:26 2015 UTC,The question itself is flawed. Data would have to hide in a cave or destroy himself at the bottom of the sea to prevent exposure. And that is already pointed out.

DaystromInstitute,3bp31k,Neo_Techni,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:16:40 2015 UTC,"He would be best suited as a rescue worker.  His physical capabilities would be useful in a number of different tragic scenarios.  Earthquake rescue, Data not only can get into places larger machinery cannot, but can lift and break apart debris to get to people faster.   Water rescue, I mean, he does not have to breathe!  And in the event of an emergency, he can serve as a flotation device.    Fireman, the ability to not feel pain allows him to save that puppy that was hiding under the bed as the house burns.  The whole house could collapse around him, and on top of him, and he'd walk away singed but clearly ok.    Data could save miners in accidents underground much faster than digging an alternate shaft to get to people.  You could just send Data down the first shaft and not be overly concerned about a second collapse.    Data could also basically walk right in on a barricaded gunman and take a couple bullets while still being operational.  He can always repair himself later as well.    Frankly, anything he does would alter the timeline, so his presence would be felt regardless.  But at least this scenario doesn't create new technological advancements directly like being a scientific computer would.  Besides, our computers are advancing exponentially in the status quo.  The need for a positronic computer isn't as huge as I would think.  And knowing idiots here on Earth, they'd probably use him to mine bitcoins.

DaystromInstitute,3bnmk4,fatbastard79,17,Tue Jun 30 18:12:24 2015 UTC,That's what I was getting at.  The Romulans can't invade without violating the Treaty and the Federation can't make them members without doing the same.  So both sides would try to get them to diplomatically favor one side over the other.
DaystromInstitute,3bnmk4,gridcube,9,Tue Jun 30 18:15:40 2015 UTC,"How though? Neither can enter the zone without causing an interstellar incident. It'd be difficult to make relations with a species whose planet you can't reach.  Granted, they may find you eventually, but what then if you want to give them technology? Are Federation replicators on a Neutral Zone world a violation? I'd imagine that the Federation wouldn't look too kindly to Romulan weapons on that same world.

DaystromInstitute,3bnmk4,rain_wizard,28,Tue Jun 30 18:38:33 2015 UTC,The neutral zone is only a light year across and was probably drawn equidistant from UFP and Romulan worlds (and any world they considered valuable enough to lay claim to during the negotiating process). There are probably very few habitable worlds inside it. We've only seen two to my knowledge.     Great idea for a story arc in an upcoming series though. Especially if the world was pre-warp and the Romulans made contact anyway. Would the Federation follow suit (Romulans already did cultural damage) or stay away (allowing the Romulans to bad mouth the UFP for decades)?
DaystromInstitute,3bnmk4,Ut_Prosim,13,Wed Jul 1 06:35:07 2015 UTC,"I'd say it would be pretty cool if it was more like this civilization is post-warp but doesn't know there are other alien races, because no race would go and greet this new warp civilization in the neutral zone. Things could happen like they never get signals because they never worked out other transmissions on subspace are other races, thinking it is just background noise. Maybe they speak in an entirely different way than everyone else so they thought our words were just background radiation. This could also mean they never needed to create something like a universal translator. They could do the entire episode from the point of view of these aliens as they discover a romulan and federation ship facing off in the neutral zone after one violated it (or maybe both). This sudden realization of not being alone in the universe and that other aliens are these violent creatures that still wage war could be an interesting idea."
DaystromInstitute,3bnmk4,rain_wizard,9,Tue Jun 30 18:57:25 2015 UTC,"Except, like /u/Ut_Prosim said above, the neutral zone is only about a lightyear across, so it seems unlikely they would have never ventured out of their own system. Also, something which basically every culture would need to develop space travel (never mind warp capability) is mathematics - it seems unlikely that a race advanced enough to achieve even warp 1 would completely ignore mathematical algorithms inherent to RF and subspace transmissions.  I think a better way to go go about something like this would be to make this race exist inside some kind of radiation barrier which prohibited them leaving their solar system or allowing transmissions in or out, and eventually overcoming the technological challenge only to discover that they were amidst a vast galactic community."
DaystromInstitute,3bnmk4,Madonkadonk,9,Tue Jun 30 19:14:40 2015 UTC,"They could have evolved on a world used by an ancient race (Iconians, T'Kon) for Omega experiments. Imagine a pocket of space a few light years across literally devoid of subspace. No warp drive, no subspace radio, no technology based on subspace (probably crappier computers, perhaps no phasers or shields). They may in some ways be more advanced than the major powers, but never made contact because they think FTL is impossible, still use radio for communications, and nobody else bothered exploring their space at sublight speeds.  Such a world might look a lot like the Alliance from Firefly. They're so desperate for space they terraformed every single rock orbiting their world, and may have a huge population, but despite their considerable technology, they never left their solar system and think aliens don't exist."
DaystromInstitute,3bnmk4,TwelfthDoctor12,9,Tue Jun 30 21:46:55 2015 UTC,"Shit; that would be awesome. I can totally get on board with that; their need to support their vastly growing population pushed technological advancement faster and faster. Dozens of billions of them crammed onto a handful of worlds. The political tensions inherent to such a densely packed yet fragmented society led to years of civil war and the development of powerful weaponry to wage it, and now they have finally broken into the galaxy at large they want more space for their people, at any cost."
DaystromInstitute,3bnmk4,Volsunga,9,Tue Jun 30 21:53:59 2015 UTC,"What could be done then is that the race since it cannot use a warp drive spends all of its time researching wormhole travel, allowing them be the only race that can create an artificial wormhole that would stay open long enough for their fleets to move through before they collapse in on themselves. The can get to any single point in the galaxy almost instantly, but once they are there, they are really just limited to impulse power. It could mean that they have been occupying the same space as the rest of the alpha quadrant as everyone else but nobody has noticed them because of the odds of a wormhole powered ship jumping into the same space as a warp powered ship would be astronomical.  Could lead to a situation of first contact when this random event happens, the ship realizes it can't speak to the other ship by subspace so they decide to avoid this pre-warp civilization, but there is something confusing, this ship is nowhere where it should be, there are no M-Class planets in this sector. Then fwoomp the ship disappears into a wormhole that was not there before, they scan it and determine the ship has jumped 30 lightyears past the starship. Now we can make first contact, and this is when the twist in the episode happens. Like I said, these two galactic civilizations have never met despite being under each others noses for so long. The new aliens are invited on the starship and are shown a map of the alpha quadrent mapping out the races starfleet knows and the starfleet captain asks, what is your territory? The new alien then overlays a border that encompasses the entire alpha quadrent. Boom start of the new story arc as this violent alien race just found out they have people in their territory who are not suppose to be there for them! They can now jump to any starbase, throw a tractor beam on a shuddlepod and jump back to their radiation barrier and now they have warp drive, a starfleet database including maps and replicator configs, and so many more planets they can take over to relieve the pressure on their overcrowded worlds!"

DaystromInstitute,3bnmk4,BigTaker,8,Wed Jul 1 03:27:42 2015 UTC,"You're right. And they're almost warp capable (seemed on par with us today).   It would be great if the entire episode was spent with each side (UFP & Romulans) trying to out-wit the other, only to end with the realization that the newcomers had played them both.  This happened in real life with Egypt during the Cold War. The USA and USSR gave them tons of cash and arms, and helped with major engineering projects like bridges and hydroelectric power systems. The Egyptians didn't actually want to join either side, they just liked getting free stuff. On paper they eventually ended up a US ally, after getting the Russians to help them against Israel, but for the most part they were in it for the cash and prizes."

DaystromInstitute,3bnmk4,SleepWouldBeNice,11,Wed Jul 15 17:05:48 2015 UTC,The neutral zone itself isn't that large and it was most likely charted as to not include any planets that had sentient life. Most likely it's just inhospitable and very few resources. I don't think either side would agree to a treaty that would cut them off from a valuable natural resource.
DaystromInstitute,3bnmk4,mistervanilla,8,Wed Jul 1 00:06:35 2015 UTC,"This actually happens a little bit in the real world already.

So to have a third party there would increase the distance between the two and give less friction.

Any claims made in the territory is inconsequential anyway, as, under the treaty, neither can interfere.  There was a short story, one of the Myriad Universe stories, which was a what-if scenario that supposed that Soong was able to create a race of androids. Eventually, they leave the Federation, as they were treated like second class citizens because they did not have the right to create offspring unless approved by the Federation. They set out for a planet in the Neutral Zone purposely, so neither the Federation or the Romulans can interfere with their affairs. Data even says that ""claiming this planet is well within our rights of salvage as established by the Treaty of Algeron"". I know it's not really canon, but it doesn't seem too outrageous to think its exactly how it works in the prime universe."

At the end of ""Journey's End"" it was heavily implied he would be taking a different route in life, away from Star Fleet, i just find it cheap to write him back in just to make the head table look nicer on screen.  But it is far from my biggest beef with that film."

DaystromInstitute,3bn4ug,DesdiPhoenix,8,Wed Jul 1 01:43:49 2015 UTC,What is your biggest beef with the film?
DaystromInstitute,3bn4ug,67thou,50,Tue Jun 30 17:45:25 2015 UTC,"The existence of B4.  The use of him as a cheap way to un-kill Data annoyed me. Killing Data was hard to accept on it's own but was more poetic than killing him then having it hinted that he was, in way, still alive. They pulled that trick on us in Star Trek 2/3 and once was enough.  B4 was not needed to get the story where it needed to go either. The entire Romulan senate being assassinated, and now in control of a Reman would have been enough to get Enterprise to Romulus. No need to detour to a planet, ride around on a Dune Buggie just for the hell of it, only to pick up a new ""Lore"" that we had never heard of before (no pun intended).  Using B4 as an enemy spy was a cop-out in the sense that we already had a similar trick with Geordi in ""Generations"" and his ""hacked"" visor. Using a secret spy to sabotage Enterprise without the knowledge of the crew ect. It lacked creativity and originality in my opinion.  If you remove B4 and all of his portions in the story and i would have felt the film was far stronger."
DaystromInstitute,3bn4ug,happywaffle,22,Tue Jun 30 18:20:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you, exactly. The ONLY thing in that movie with emotional resonance was the death of Data. And then they took that away, too.  But my BIGGEST beef with the film was not casting Patrick Stewart in a double role. You're going to have an Evil Picard but NOT cast your lead actor as that role? What the EFFF"
DaystromInstitute,3bn4ug,iplaysthedrums,12,Tue Jun 30 18:23:13 2015 UTC,I thought tom hardy was believable. He did quite well in my opinion.
DaystromInstitute,3bn4ug,eternallylearning,6,Tue Jun 30 21:24:12 2015 UTC,"Completely.  Tom Hardy definitely made the movie better than it had any right to be.  He was a smart casting choice and if Stewarts de-aging in X3 is any indication, digitally casting him as Shinzon would have made the film much, much worse.  Even more, I doubt they had the budget for it given the tech in X3 wasn't there yet and that was years later.  I'm sure the cost would have been through the roof.   I'm taking it for granted that practical makeup would not have been an option to make a younger Picard.  Maybe they could have gone the accelerated aging of the clone route ala Kahless, but I'm still iffy as to how that would have come off.  I mean, Patrick Stewart the s the man, but the evil double thing has been done quite enough in Trek.  Might as well slap a goatee on him for effect.  I suppose it could work, but it's risky enough for an episode not to mention a full movie."
DaystromInstitute,3bn4ug,butterhoscotch,7,Tue Jun 30 23:08:05 2015 UTC,"Hardy wasnt terrible because hardy is a good actor but picard could have easily been played by stewart. In fact I think a fully aged clone would have had more impact in so far as the whole ""if you lived my life you would be doing what I am doing"" thing. Imagine a brutally scarred stewart with a limp, from years of romulan beatings, his hate would be as powerful as picards was for the borg."
DaystromInstitute,3bn4ug,eternallylearning,3,Tue Jun 30 23:47:27 2015 UTC,"No, I get it.  I'm just having a hard time not seeing it come off as campy.   I mean the only times the evil twin was played straight in teh franchise was in TOS and everyone still lovingly mocks it. In DS9 and Enterprise, the camp was quite strong.  The only exception I can think of is Riker's twin, but that wasn't  really an evil twin, just a path not chosen kind of thing.  I do agree though that it was a hard sell all the same with the younger clone, as he just didn't seem like Picard."

DaystromInstitute,3bn4ug,67thou,6,Tue Jun 30 22:57:50 2015 UTC,"I was annoyed that the value of B4 to the Romulans would have been significant and they would likely long ago dismantled and attempted to reverse engineer the technology for their own benefit. I highly doubt he would have been kept intact for so long. Hell, even their top secret ""clone"" of Picard was sent to the mines to hide his existence."
DaystromInstitute,3bn4ug,jihiggs,3,Tue Jun 30 23:27:00 2015 UTC,"thats another thing.  if they decided not to use the clone they would have destroyed it, not sent it off for torture."
DaystromInstitute,3bn4ug,magnalbatross,4,Wed Jul 1 03:49:45 2015 UTC,"I disagree somewhat.  B4 had two purposes.  One was to bring the Enterprise close to Romulus.  The Enterprise might otherwise have been assigned by chance, but B4 helped guarantee Enterprise's proximity.  The second was as an enemy spy.  It might have worked on another Federation ship.. but which ship besides Enterprise would have kept B4 operational?"
DaystromInstitute,3bn4ug,XXS_speedo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:10:21 2015 UTC,"I think that peace talks with Romulus would have warranted the Enterprise no matter where and what it was assigned to do before.

DaystromInstitute,3bn4ug,garibaldi3489,3,Tue Jul 7 15:55:58 2015 UTC,The Cold Equations book series actually does a great job of explaining the existence of B4 and why he had not been discovered until then

DaystromInstitute,3bn4ug,Berggeist,2,Tue Jun 30 23:58:40 2015 UTC,"Obviously he either mastered travel through time and space, or the Traveler kicked him out. From Beta canon, there are some books set after First Contact where Wesley was being tested by the Travelers (Yeah, there are a bunch of them) to see if he would join them. I never got to finish the series, but he had to not interfere while the Enterprise went through great danger. So either way, he MIGHT have an excuse for being there."

DaystromInstitute,3bn4ug,happywaffle,2,Tue Jun 30 16:38:00 2015 UTC,"There was a fan story in Brave New Worlds II where temporal agents were investigating an incursion along the Federation/Cardassian DMZ. The events of ""The Maquis"" (DS9) were altered significantly from sabatoge to an outright confrontation with the Cardassians. It was revealed towards the end that Wesley had altered the timeline (something the Travelers can do, apparently), and claimed that by escalating the conflict at such an early point, a treaty was reached before the Cardassians could ally with the Dominion, thereby saving millions of lives. The agents argued that altering the timeline wasn't his duty, and he eventually relented, much to The Traveler's approval.  It's a fan story, but it had some interesting character development for good ol' Wesley. I like to think that something along those lines could have happened in the alpha-canon, giving him a large dose of humility and an appreciation for the ""little"" things, like serving as a night-shift lieutenant aboard a diplomatic vessel (the Titan later being the lead vessel in the diplomatic talks with the Romulans post-Nemesis)."

DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,Noumenology,32,Tue Jun 30 16:06:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly I always enjoyed TFF. I grew up watching it as a kid, I always thought it was kinda cheesy, and it wasn't until older that I noticed some of the production value was missing. It seemed odd that the really beautiful new NCC1701A was such a piece of junk, but I figured that was because Starfleet had other priorities and it was a bit of an outdated ship.   It wasn't until maybe a year ago or so that RLM released this commentary on the film and I heard some of the context and backstory for the production. Apparently the studio really didn't feel like supporting this one. A writer's strike, budget cuts, slashed deadlines and SFX limitations, the quality of the production suffered. More detail here and here.  Second, and there are no two ways about this, Shatner's ego is center stage. He had a deal to direct a film if STIV was successful, and he also wrote the original story. There are certain technical errors and problems (distance to the center of the galaxy, the height of the enterprise, number of decks) which throws off an aware audience, there is a general sense of brokenness (the transporters don't work most of the film, starfleet has no other ships in the area as usual, sulu has to fly the shuttle in manually, scotty blows up the brig to get kirk spock and bones out), and there are some weird moments from the characters (Spock calls marshmallows ""marshmellons,"" Scotty seems clumsy and old, and Uhura... no excuse for that scene). All of this stuff just strikes me as really nitpicky and we could find other films with the same sorts of problems (""omg why are all these people just running around colorado in the past helping zefram cochrane what about the temporal prime directive WHAT A BAD MOVIE"")  Lastly, the film has a tendency to piss off a lot of secular humanists who think any mention of ""God"" doesn't belong in their star trek. To you, I am sorry, there's no real excusing this if that's how you feel, and there is a very different atmosphere in this film in that respect.   But I think some of these problems can actually play to the strengths of the film.  First, I think TFF focuses more on relationships than any other ST film. The Yosemite scenes are referred to as boring, slow, pointless. I feel the same way about this scene in Nemesis. Without a sense of investment, an audience does not care about action. The camping sequences are about interpersonal drama and watching the interactions of these three friends, who have gone through so much together. As Spock says in The Undiscovered Country (TUC)   SPOCK: Is it possible ...that we two, you and I, have grown so old and so inflexible ...that we have outlived our usefulness? ...Would that constitute a joke?   But while TUC is Nimoy's film, TFF is Shatner's. And while Nimoy talks about suspicion, flexibility and change from the past, Shatner talks about embracing it. In what I think is the best scene in the film, Kirk refutes Sybok's offer to wash away past trauma and memory:   SYBOK: Now learn something about yourself. KIRK: No. I refuse. McCOY: Jim, try to be open about this. KIRK: About what? That I've made the wrong choices in my life? That I turned left when I should've turned right? I know what my weaknesses are. I don't need Sybok to take me on a tour of them. McCOY: If you'd just... KIRK: To be brainwashed by this con man? McCOY: I was wrong. This 'con man' took away my pain! KIRK: Dammit, Bones, you're a doctor. You know that pain and guilt can't be taken away with the wave of a magic wand. They're things we carry with us, the things that make us who we are. ...If we lose them, we lose ourselves. I don't want my pain taken away. I need my pain.   And at the end, he sums it up:   KIRK: Cosmic thoughts, gentlemen? McCOY: We were speculating ...'Is God really out there?' KIRK: Maybe He's not out there, Bones. Maybe He's right here ...in the human heart. ...Spock? SPOCK: I was thinking of Sybok. I have lost a brother. KIRK: Yes. ...I lost a brother once. But I was lucky, I got him back. McCOY: I thought you said men like us don't have families. KIRK: I was wrong.     What's the point of this? Remember the context. They JUST got the Enterprise-A. They just finished with the events of rescuing Spock from death. They're probably still a bit wounded from that and from the destruction of their original ship. They've made a lot of mistakes, and a lot of stuff has gone wrong.   This is also reflected in the ""brokenness"" of the movie. Scotty may seem like a bumbling idiot, and while he claims to ""know this ship like the back of my hand,"" it's not his ship. Scotty's a man who's depressed. The crew is a bit depressed to. They are experiencing the trauma everything that happened between STII-IV and very nearly losing their careers. This comes out in Bones sincere anger at Kirk's climb, the recklessness of Sulu, maybe even the inhibition of Uhura.  The God theme is worth another post all of it's own, but I think most important is how Sybok symbolically represents a sort of therapy, where people acknowledge and let go of pain from mistakes, maybe even the ""born again"" movement (think The Apostle, or Leap of Faith, 90s movies that drew from this same rhetoric/thinking). And that quote from the end represents how the Enterprise crew (and the cast of the show) came together in spite of opposition from their past mistakes, Paramount's lack of support, and the public's focus on The Next Generation."
DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,RedDwarfian,16,Tue Jun 30 16:41:37 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the relationships between the characters is what saves this film; especially when you compare it to The Motion Picture.   I hadn't really considered the implication of just how soon after II this takes place. I knew that this movie was basically taking the trilogy and turning it into a quadrilogy, but hadn't thought of how this would affect the characters. This turns V into a version of TNG's ""Family"".   Yes, there are plotholes you could park a shuttle in. Nobody denies that. That doesn't mean that it doesn't have its own merits."
DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,RedDwarfian,6,Tue Jun 30 19:47:40 2015 UTC,"I really like the comparison to Family, I think that's a great analogy."
DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,TrekkieTechie,4,Wed Jul 1 01:07:32 2015 UTC,"The only problem, pointed out by /u/phtll elsewhere in this thread, is that ""Family"" directly led off of ""Best of Both Worlds"", airing a week after the conclusion.  The Borg attack was still fresh in the audience's mind.    The movies premiered years apart: Khan in '82, Search in '84, Voyage Home in '86-87, Final Frontier in '89.  That's a total gap of 7 years between the beginning of the tale to the end, but the main narrative started in 2285.  Voyage Home happened in 2286 (and 1986, but that's beside the point).  Final Frontier happened in 2287.  A span of 2 years at most, in universe.  The previous movies' emotional ties would have faded for the viewer long before the ties for the characters.    Dealing with losses on that scale is hard.  Dealing with the fallout will take months, if not years.  Kirk alone didn't fully deal with his son's death until 2293, after Praxis, 8 years after the event."

DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,phtll,4,Tue Jun 30 17:12:41 2015 UTC,"Bravo! An excellent post which I think is also an excellent reading of the film. I can't call it a good film, but I do think it had some creative spark to it which comes through most clearly in the campfire and visions of past pains - especially the visions of past pains.  It's also a -very- Trek story, and in its own way feels very true to the series, even if it's partly in bad effects, foam rocks and an powerful being claiming to be a deity that Kirk defeats with talk in moments.  This isn't going to excuse it from the many issues that plague it (especially flaws in terms of being a wholly competent film), but I think within the greater context of TOS-crew, it has its place and the tiny seed of redemption that Trek is often about trying to find.  I should add, however, that I'm also viewing this in a very nontraditional light. For me this has been around for decades. I was around, though not viewing it, when it was in theaters; I saw it at a friends house on VHS years later (in other words, at no cost). For completion sake I would buy it on its own on dvd (which came with plenty of extras), and much later I would buy it as part of the Star Trek movies blu ray box set on sale, making the cost to me for that specific movie tiny.  If I had seen that film as a grown adult at the theatre, I would probably not be so forgiving. Viewing a film divorced of any sort of anticipation, hype or hopes and approaching it from a more meditative viewpoint at my leisure makes for a much different experience.  Also, not very related, but the ad for the VHS is just a little galling: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRAoUbI-0Iw"
DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,RedDwarfian,4,Wed Jul 1 03:45:26 2015 UTC,"I think reading in trauma and depression is a bit reaching, especially when the previous two films ended in triumph--surely whatever mistakes they made were outweighed in their psyches by saving Spock and then the Earth, no? Even when their careers were threatened (and not ended, of course) they stood proud and defiant alongside Kirk, as they had when committing the crimes that had them in the dock. TSFS and TVH are both largely about the unbreakable bond and unstoppable tenacity of Our Favorite Family, so it seems out of place for them to be fractured and beaten down in TFF, and it makes the bonding scenes themselves sort of retreads. I'd rather watch just about any Power Trio scene from 2, 3, 4 (or 6 for that matter) than the ones from 5."
DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,phtll,10,Tue Jun 30 17:56:12 2015 UTC,"...especially when the previous two films ended in triumph...   ""The Best of Both Worlds"" ended in a triumph as well.  Earth saved, Picard rescued, the Borg defeated.  What happened next?  ""Family"", where we see just how much Picard really suffered at the hands of the Borg.    Victory doesn't mean everyone's back to smiles and happiness.  Once the adrenaline wears off, you start having to deal with what just happened."
DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,spamjavelin,4,Tue Jun 30 21:18:28 2015 UTC,"Are we remembering the same ending of BOBW? In the one I'm familiar with, the music goes ominous and Picard stares out a window. Compare the literal cheering crowd and speeding starship ending of TVH, or the family hugs ending of TSFS. In musical metaphor, those are major key crescendoes, BOBW was a minor key....umm...decrescendo.  Would a bit of inertia and angst for our heroes have made sense in real life? Yeah, probably, but we get no hint of it in the setup, so the delivery is hollow.  To say nothing of the difference between TV storytelling over an audience gap of one week and movie storytelling over a gap of 3 years."
DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,DMPunk,2,Tue Jun 30 21:50:42 2015 UTC,I don't see how anyone could find the Yosemite scenes boring. I thought they were some of the best parts.

You raise excellent points, but there's very little in the movie to directly or indirectly suggest that you're right. That kind of fan theory may make the film more enjoyable for the individual, but it doesn't improve the actual objective quality of the film"
DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,SpocksBrainLLAP,5,Tue Jun 30 20:39:44 2015 UTC,"Fan theory is sort of what we do here... and the alternative to ""reading"" a film is having everything spelled out for you. Is that really what you want?"
DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,MeVasta,2,Wed Jul 1 01:10:15 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. My point was that for a film to be good, there needs to be balance. If the only way a movie can be seen as good is strictly through fan interpretation and not by anything communicated by the screen, then I think it's failed"
DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,happywaffle,13,Wed Jul 1 02:46:09 2015 UTC,"It's bad but with one redeeming scene: When McCoy sees his dying dad again.  In an otherwise wacky movie, this scene grounds everything. It's beautifully acted by Mr Kelly and is the moment I think about when someone mentions this film.  Oh, and this bit of course."
DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,Hilomh,7,Tue Jun 30 17:38:53 2015 UTC,"I really hated that Scotty moment. I rewound the movie just to check if I misunderstood it or if the gag really was that much of a mess. ""What does God need with a starship?"" on the other hand has got to be one of my favorite Kirk moments across the whole franchise. Talking computers into self-destruction is one thing, but facing God and then questioning his mysterious ways - that is Kirk at his best."
DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,phtll,2,Thu Jul 2 01:39:06 2015 UTC,"Ugh. Such a cartoony moment. There's no plausible explanation for not seeing a giant metal beam right in front of you when you're not otherwise distracted. They could have done the exact same gag in a different way (coming around a corner, a moving part, something) and it would have played a little bit better."
DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,ThorBreakBeatGod,10,Thu Jul 2 20:39:25 2015 UTC,"I'm going to say it...I kinda liked TFF.  I'm not saying it's great, but I don't hate it.  In fact, I probably liked it more than Search for Spock.  TFF had a strong focus on the Kirk, Spock, and Bones friendship, which reminded me of the TV show.  Also, it's one of the few times we've ever heard Shatner sing without him being silly or too ""Shatnery.""  That was nice.   Also, on the Blu-Ray, the wide shots of Kirk climbing El Capitan looked great."
DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,Butterflyfreed,16,Tue Jun 30 22:26:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely deserving of hate: A poorly written, directed, and filmed work that, if viewed with Trekkie glasses off, has very few redeeming merits. Not just mediocre, but actively bad, with clear structural and storytelling issues, clunky dialogue, poor characterization of regulars and incomplete characterization of Sybok, bad direction both to the actors and in the form of poorly conceived and constructed shots, etc. It is a poorly made film, which few people would say about Trek 09, despite its Trek flaws (same to a lesser extent with STID). And it's a mediocre Trek movie at best--the most I can say about its Trekness is that its heart is in the right place. Everything else it mucks up a bit, from the bolt bucket Enterprise to the politics to the feel of the space travel.  To me TFF is not a decent meal that I don't happen to like, it's a meal that's cooked poorly from a bad recipe. None of the other movies ever made me embarrassed to be watching them, no matter how boring or silly they got, not even Generations. (Some episodes did, and I would count TFF with the least of them.) It was something like Michael Scott's Threat Level Midnight, except staggeringly real and 2 hours long instead of hilariously fake and 22 minutes.  Roger Ebert in a fairly kind review details some more of the numerous problems."

DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,robmillerfl,6,Tue Jun 30 20:11:20 2015 UTC,"The Final Frontier is good because it's a bad film. Captain Kirk is climbing a mountain, why is he climbing a mountain? Why is there a planet filled with extras from the set of Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome? (Can't we just get beyond thunderdome?) In fact, why are we even brought to this planet except that all messiah's have to come out of the desert at some point so we want the cliche? Why does Spock have an evil brother? In the ultimate quest for God, would Spock really kill him upon first sight? McCoy is renowned for his ability to reason and own his own person. It's a defining character trait, he actively resists basically everything and his friends love him for it. So why would he betray one of the two people he is completely loyal to? None of it makes sense. I think I like it because I'm a big fan of bad movies. Bad movies often times give you as much to talk about as good ones do."
DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,robmillerfl,3,Tue Jun 30 22:51:36 2015 UTC,"If I was absolutely honest with myself, I would agree - I also enjoy bad movies. But if we're clear what we mean by this, it's not movies that try to be bad on purpose (Transmorphers), or movies that are successful in many aspects but are just not ""good' films (Transformers), but movies that are honestly trying their very best to do something. They fail because of the ineptitude of everyone involved - MST3k is great for this because pretty much every film they chose for the show captured that ""we tried"" attitude (from Manos to Quest of the Delta Knights).   What I really like about TFF is that it tried, and most of the problems were unintentional (ILM wasn't available) or unavoidable (Shatner should not write screenplays). Compare this to Nemesis - the studio spent plenty of time and money ($60m) on it, but the cast still fucking hated Stuart Baird and it was not as popular on release."
DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,leejs,4,Wed Jul 1 01:03:40 2015 UTC,"The problem with STV isn't that it's that bad--I see screen caps and GIFs from it on Tumblr way more than I see for, say, Insurrection--but that it could have been so much better if Shatner had let someone else make just a few changes to the script. It's like having a friend let you look at their term paper after they got a shitty grade on it, and thinking about how it could have easily gotten an A if they'd let you proof it before it was turned in. I already listed my two main problems with it in the previous thread, but I could have also gone without the more slapsticky humor; Scotty running into an overhanging pipe that's in perfectly clear view is a great example. (A simple fix: he's talking to whoever he's talking to in that scene, does his ""...like the back of my hand"" thing as he's backing down a side corridor, hits his head, mutters ""who the hell put that there"" or something that sounds really vile in Gaelic or just whips out a sonic wrench or something and hits it back.) In a way, it's a bit like TMP: another film that really isn't as bad as its reputation had it, but needed some refinement and tuning that it never got, and got shown up by the film right after it (both by Nicholas Meyer)."

DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,TrekkieTechie,10,Wed Jul 1 01:18:13 2015 UTC,"It is bad, but it's not the worst. Like Voyager, I feel it's badness is a symptom of squandered potential. I love the idea of a nearly all-powerful being trapped in a prison pretending to be God. The idea that he is influencing others as a means of escaping his prison is really neat.  But this idea (and a few great scenes such as Kirk talking about how he needs his pain) is overshadowed by ridiculousness. An old woman's fan dance. A hell-hole planet based on peace. An unnecessary Klingon antagonist (that apparently hangs out in the heart of the Federation, next to Earth, without Starfleet caring). A brother never once mentioned. A galactic barrier everyone is afraid of crossing but is easy to get through (I guess the colours just scared people away before?). Shoddy production values (eg. turbolift deck numbers).  But at least the characters are still the same old characters. They didn't suffer the fate of Picard or Spock, becoming unnecessarily angry or violent so they could turn it into an action flick."
DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,BonzoTheBoss,4,Tue Jun 30 16:45:23 2015 UTC,"One of the big shortcomings of TFF is that it tried to continue the humor of ST: IV and it didn't always work. Combine that with the production problems and the plot holes and you've got yourself the worst of the original cast movies.   But does it deserve the hate? I don't think so. The original cast is still the best cast (IMHO) and one of the things the film got right was the way the characters interacted with one another. It felt like a modern take on the original TV show, only longer (and complete with with show's cheesiness). For that I'll always enjoy watching it."
DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,adamkotsko,4,Tue Jun 30 22:44:42 2015 UTC,"Surprised nobody has mentioned Nimbus III yet. Out of all the movie's badness, I thought the conceit of a ""Planet of Galactic Peace"" turned into a Mad Max shithole was surprisingly gritty for Trek, and laid the proper groundwork for a desperate population who would agree to follow a cult-leader Vulcan on his mad quest for God.  So as far as the core story of the movie, anyway, the problem wasn't the concept. It was the execution."
DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,brokenarrow,10,Thu Jul 2 20:42:14 2015 UTC,"A very bad film, with some bright spots. Here is my take:  1) The Enterprise's ""everything is broken"" act doesn't reflect well on starfleet or the franchise. I can understand the ship's warp drive needing work, but the doors not working? Silly.   2) Sybok. An interesting nuanced villain, who seemed to have a singular but inexplicable fascination with the spiritual. Was an interesting premise but ultimately left unfulfilled.   3) Sybok's ability to enthrall everyone seemed to diminish the other characters. Is it that easy to trick everyone into following you? Couldn't imagine that happening in TNG.   4) The trip to the galactic core seemed to have taken place in a few days or maybe a week or two. Obviously the movies producers didn't have a warp scale handy.  5) ""God."" What a cheap letdown. It would have been more interesting if ""God"" actually had been real or at least a more benevolent force that had some consequence. This was an opportunity to explore and get really deep. Instead, it's a relatively shallow ploy that wasted an interesting buildup.   6) The Klingon ship subplot, with Spock as gunner. YAWN  I don't remember what happened next."
DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,philwelch,12,Tue Jun 30 16:17:30 2015 UTC,Is it that easy to trick everyone into falling you? Couldn't imagine that happening in TNG.   Well...
DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,Owyn_Merrilin,2,Tue Jun 30 17:10:42 2015 UTC,"Yes but with ""the game"" there was an obvious and well explained neurochemical reason behind it. Sybok's ""pain cleansing"" is never really explained.   It's presumably some form of telepathy? Is it unique to him or can all Vulcans do that? Or just Vulcans that are open to their ""passions""? How does releasing ones pain suddenly make you want to follow this mad man? He ""freed"" Spock and McCoy and they didn't follow him. McCoy wanted to go with him but was compelled by Spock and Kirk, showing that the ""brain washed"" still retain some semblance of higher thinking."
DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,kgyre,8,Thu Jul 2 14:31:57 2015 UTC,"I think there were some potentially good ideas at work, but overall the film was dragged down by really, really poor execution on almost every level. I go into more detail here, and here I'll add that the more I think about it, the more inexcusable the retcon of Spock and Sarek's background seems. Couldn't Sybok have been a close childhood friend or another relative other than a brother?"
DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,Owyn_Merrilin,6,Tue Jun 30 16:58:34 2015 UTC,"That's the point that I was going to make when I read this post.  Sybok could have been JAV (Just Another Villian... or Vulcan, I guess), and been just as compelling.  The only reason to make him Spock's half brother was so that Spock wouldn't shoot him in the shuttle bay.  It's not even fan service like John Harrison/Khan was - it's poor plot service.  Make the gun run out of ammo/battery....  make Spock intrigued with Sybok's inquisition into the mind...  But, retconning Spock's family history was a terrible idea.  On the balance, I enjoy TFF (much more than STID).  God could have been handled better, I admit, and the crew shouldn't have been as easily swayed as they were, but senior staff can be handwaved with mind melds (the rest of the crew... not so much).  It's a character driven story, and, for all of its failings...  it's a fun romp, which evokes, for me, more of TOS than some of the other TOS movies."
DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,67thou,6,Tue Jun 30 18:16:33 2015 UTC,"So here's my defense of Star Trek V--I've posted it before but a repeated thread calls for a repeated comment:   Star Trek V is not just vastly underrated, it's also the single TOS movie that was most faithful to the series. The emotional foundation of TOS is the relationship between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy, and the other TOS movies stray from that; TMP and II spend time introducing new characters while III has no Spock and IV and VI split the three up and give more time to the secondary characters. The focus on the main three characters, the banter between them, and even the general campiness of the story are all strongly reminiscent of TOS in a way that the other movies aren't. On top of that, it has a lot of heart and is perhaps the Star Trek movie where you can most feel a genuine sense of love between the characters.   If you threw away the first four movies and only had TOS and Star Trek V to judge, I think Star Trek V would compare quite favorably. People forget that wacky science fiction stories with ludicrous plot holes and dubious continuity happened all the time in TOS, and the only thing that grounded them were the main characters. This is how Star Trek V works. Hell, it even has a teaser scene before the opening credits.  Unfortunately for the legacy of Star Trek V, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan was an absolutely fantastic film--one of the best science fiction films of the decade--and raised our expectations to an unreasonable level.  Personally, I would rank Star Trek V over Insurrection, Nemesis, and Into Darkness, and I have a hard time ranking it compared to Generations or ST09. Out of twelve movies, that's somewhere between solid mid-table (7 out of 12) to below-average-but-not-the-worst (9 out of 12) though, if you don't count the Abrams films, you get a consistently below average rating (7/8 out of 10)."
DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,sarcasmsociety,3,Wed Jul 1 03:25:22 2015 UTC,"I've always felt like the Premise of Star Trek V was the best and most true to the original series out of the entire film series, but that the execution was horrible. It's to this day the only Star Trek movie that I have not only the novelization of (which is really good and worth a read, by the way, really shows what could have been if Paramount hadn't fought Shatner every step of the way), but the comic book adaptation of, that's how much I like the premise.  As it stands, my favorites are VI and TMP, in that order, because they both had great premises, and managed to not drop the ball on the execution, either."
DaystromInstitute,3bn8h9,SchrodingersNinja,2,Thu Jul 2 02:35:44 2015 UTC,"I largely agree with you, but that's what you look for in a TV episode, not a film. The status quo doesn't really change at all for our regular characters compared to any of the other original films."

Had the effects been better i may have been far more willing to ignore the issues with the story line, trek science and continuity. When its fun to look at a film it can be fun to suspend my disappointment, this is how i manage to enjoy the NewTrek films, because while they too annoy me from a trek-fan point of view, they are fun to look at and still find a way to bring entertainment."

DaystromInstitute,3bmlzz,adamkotsko,31,Tue Jun 30 13:09:35 2015 UTC,"I believe that Archer had great difficulty wrestling with the morality of sending somebody else from his crew to their death.   In TNG, when Troi is taking the bridge officer exam, she ultimately passes by having to send Gordie to this death (in a simulation of course). And, while she ultimately realized the necessity to put the ship ahead of the individuals, it was a choice that hurt her to make.  Archer believes that he's the best person for the job, for any job. But, more than that, he would rather sacrifice himself than give the order that leads to the death of another within his crew. A rather parental approach, it seems."
DaystromInstitute,3bmlzz,Em-Power-Me,10,Tue Jun 30 15:29:10 2015 UTC,It's true that he seems angrier than any other Star Trek captain when a crew member is killed or even seriously injured.
DaystromInstitute,3bmlzz,zippy1981,26,Tue Jun 30 15:31:45 2015 UTC,"Archer grew up in a post war and famine peace time unified earth military. He was an astronaut, and his entire branches mandate was exploration. He had a little more combat training than NOA, but honestly he was a test pilot in an exploration unit. He was only used to endangering his own life, and being a personal representative of humanity.  In the later centuries, unified earth and later the federation fought a few wars, and it was accepted that Starfleet were defacto soldiers in those conflicts. Cadets had training to make them deal with death like the Kobayashi Maru and the bridge officers test. Archer had none of these things. Whatever he did have, he dismissed as unnecessary. Now someone like Malcolm Reed probably thought more about those possibilities, because he saw the need for military discipline."
DaystromInstitute,3bmlzz,ILikeDickButt,3,Tue Jun 30 17:56:28 2015 UTC,Probably becaue humans of his time still haven't gotten used to the idea that space is a dangerous place.

Yeah, it HURTS sending that poor redshirt to his death let alone a senior officer you're well acquainted with, but it's a hell of a lot better than a ship losing her captain in hostile territory."
DaystromInstitute,3bmlzz,georgy11,6,Tue Jun 30 16:34:10 2015 UTC,"This seems to be the right answer, the death of a relatively small number of crewmen compared to other enterprise captains seemed to affect him a lot more.  He mentions their sacrifice multiple times over the course of ENT."
DaystromInstitute,3bmlzz,74159637895123,4,Tue Jun 30 15:42:10 2015 UTC,"I suppose that's probably down to the fact that Archer was the only starfleet captain we've seen who genuinely didn't think starfleet ships could find themselves in a situation like that, every other captain we see knows that in part it's a military organisation, that it'll fight when it has to but Archer set off with Earth never having been at war, on a mission of exploration and not even caring that he'd left the phase cannons behind because he thought diplomacy would win the day every day."
DaystromInstitute,3bmlzz,DS_Unltd,2,Tue Jun 30 16:57:06 2015 UTC,"I think Archer's sense of responsibility stems from one of the basic principles of military leadership: You are the first one through that door. As a leader, it is his job to ensure that his crew gets home at the end of the day (or mission), and one way of doing that is by being the first one in. He values his life less than the lives of his crew members."
DaystromInstitute,3bmlzz,williams_482,2,Tue Jun 30 16:17:46 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, as the commanding officer it is his job not to be the first through that door, because he is the most valuable person of the group. Archer doesn't really grasp (or refuses to admit) that the people beneath him are less important to the mission than he is, and if someone is going to die it needs to be someone else."
DaystromInstitute,3bmlzz,InconsiderateBastard,2,Tue Jun 30 18:04:15 2015 UTC,"I think its less parental and more of a confidence issue.  Throughout the series, Archer lacks gravitas.  It's why he's my least favorite captain of the TV shows.  He is not good at inspiring others, at rallying them, at leading them.    I believe when a suicide mission comes up, he takes it on himself out of a fear that if he sent another crew member to do it they would either 1) back out of doing it because they just don't believe in him enough or 2) die doing it and the rest of the crew would turn on him as a result."
DaystromInstitute,3bmlzz,disposable_pants,24,Tue Jun 30 16:51:30 2015 UTC,"One inadvertent consequence of Archer's many suicide missions might be the relative underdevelopment of ENT's full bridge crew.  Take a few of your examples:   Flying the Xindi shuttle:  As /u/bakhesh points out, Travis would have been a much better choice for this job. Destroying the Xindi weapon around Earth:  I'd have to watch this episode again to check the specifics of who's available, but wouldn't Malcolm and/or some of the MACOs have been a more natural option here? Incubating the Augment Virus:  Why not put Hoshi on this one?  Maybe the virus disrupts the Universal Translator -- if push comes to shove, wouldn't it be handy to have someone who could speak Klingon in a pinch?   I'm sure a bit more tweaking or creativity could land other underutilized characters additional screen time and focus.  Imagine what a few more high-leverage episodes about secondary characters would have done for their development.  As for in-universe explanations of Archer's ""death wish,"" I can think of at least one tantalizing idea:  What if Archer purposefully volunteers for suicide missions because he knows that Daniels will save him?  The more I think about it, the more I think this is the best possible explanation.  Daniels appears in ENT's first season (""Cold Front"") and hints at Archer that he has some larger role to play.  Daniels makes the importance of this future role more and more explicit each time he revisits, culminating in showing Archer his crucial role in the signing of the Federation charter.  And Daniels gives Archer one more crucial piece of information -- that according to the temporal laws of the 31st century the past is not to be altered.    What would you do if:   You knew you had an important role to play in the future You knew a being far more powerful than you was dedicated to ensuring that you would fulfill that role You had a choice between putting yourself or one of your crewmen in danger   The logical choice is to put yourself in danger!  To tie this into the meta-theme of this post, you have real-world plot armor!  That's why Archer always thrusts himself into no-win situations -- he knows he has a guardian angel."
DaystromInstitute,3bmlzz,disposable_pants,8,Tue Jun 30 20:13:47 2015 UTC,What if Archer purposefully volunteers for suicide missions because he knows that Daniels will save him?   Ooh! Great theory!
DaystromInstitute,3bmlzz,bakhesh,4,Tue Jun 30 20:22:08 2015 UTC,"I can't think of a reason why that theory wouldn't work, and the plot armor dimension fits perfectly with some of your other meta-analyses on the themes in ENT."

DaystromInstitute,3bmlzz,disposable_pants,6,Tue Jun 30 20:32:44 2015 UTC,"I love this idea, but just to expand upon it, maybe it's not so much a guardian angel. Maybe Archer just really believes in his destiny.  Daniels has told him that he will play a pivotal role in forming the Federation. If Archer died in the expanse, he would never have got a chance to fulfill that, and Daniels would never have existed. The fact that Daniels exists proves that Archer HAS to form the federation, and in this timeline, nothing will kill him before then  Archer is just secretly really good at temporal mechanics"
DaystromInstitute,3bmlzz,jwpar1701,4,Tue Jun 30 20:35:21 2015 UTC,You've actually got me on Archer's side and changed some of my views on Enterprise. Klingon ambassador's slow-clap from Star Trek VI
DaystromInstitute,3bmlzz,disposable_pants,4,Mon Jul 13 01:37:48 2015 UTC,"To be fair, there's zero contextual support for this idea -- Archer never says anything to this effect and there's no winking and nodding done by the writers.  It just makes perfect sense."
DaystromInstitute,3bmlzz,jwpar1701,4,Mon Jul 13 01:44:00 2015 UTC,But that's exactly why. Archer never seems to be the best at captaining or diplomacy in the series. So it seems in-character for him to make up for it by protecting his crew any way he can.
DaystromInstitute,3bmlzz,zippy1981,3,Mon Jul 13 01:46:54 2015 UTC,"He definitely cares the most about his crew of any captain we've seen.  That's not a knock on Kirk, Picard, Sisko, and Janeway; it's just that they didn't grow up in perhaps Earth's most idealistic period."
DaystromInstitute,3bmlzz,themojofilter,2,Mon Jul 13 01:54:30 2015 UTC,"Also, we don't really see any of them displaying conspicuous concern for anybody but the main crew. I think it's also less about Archer growing up among Earth's most idealistic period and more about him realizing that this is a turning point for Earth and humanity and they have a hell of a lot to lose. I think Picard (barring that one scene in First Contact) displays the next-most concern for redshirts in the canon, getting furious when Nagilum kills a literal redshirt for no reason, and also promoting people up from redshirt status when he recognizes talent or initiative (Geordie, O'Brien, Worf)."
DaystromInstitute,3bmlzz,bakhesh,2,Mon Jul 13 08:38:08 2015 UTC,"Also, we don't really see any of them displaying conspicuous concern for anybody but the main crew.   Archer's ship had a crew capacity of 83. He knew every one of them. The 1701 had a complement of 430. Picard had over 1000.  Most people on the later ships were outside of the captain's dunbars numbers.  Also, Archer's Starfleet was more of a small town police force. It never fought wars. Federation Starfleet may not claimed to be a military, but it was the entity that fought wars. It prepared for wars.  Archer reacted like a police Cpatain when someone in his command died. The other captains acted like a soldier died."
DaystromInstitute,3bmlzz,rliant1864,2,Thu Jul 16 16:48:11 2015 UTC,"This would probably be an intentional throwback to the Roddenberry ideal that a Captain should be not just a jack-of-all-trades, but a master of all. According to his official biography Gene modeled Captain Kirk after the role of a WWII bomber captain (Roddenberry himself), who had to be a pilot, engineer, medic, bombardier, and gunner. If any of the bomber's crew were incapacitated, the captain had to be able to instantly take over any role. This is why so often we see Kirk take at least a supervisory role in every department. He could out-troubleshoot Scotty, out-pilot Sulu, and managed to argue science and medicine with Spock and Bones.  Purely speculation, but this seems to be what they were going for with Archer being torn between the ""everyman"" and the ""every-where man.""  Edited for more clear wording. Meaning remains the same."
DaystromInstitute,3bmlzz,bakhesh,4,Fri Jul 17 19:27:29 2015 UTC,"I always felt that Archer was a terrible captain, and these are two of the main reasons why. Flying the Xindi shuttle was clearly a task for Travis, who had actually trained on it. Archer flew it after a quick lesson from him. He might as well have tried to perform surgery himself after a 5 minute chat with Phlox.  I'm not sure that he was suicidal though, but I think he was a thrill-seeker (possibly subconsciously). He jeopardised the entire Xindi mission for his own fun. At most, he was dangerously reckless. At worst, he was a terrible manager. Either way, he probably should have been stripped of command"

DaystromInstitute,3bnod8,thesynod,5,Tue Jun 30 18:17:23 2015 UTC,"We've had analog devices that perform functions that are classically considered the realm of computers.  Analog targeters for battleships that have gears and mechanical sliderules and whatnot, vinyl records existed somewhat before digital music, and more.  It seems logical to me that a species might eschew computers for reasons ranging from technical to philosophical yet still engineer brilliant solutions to these problems.  An analog feedback loop might control warp fields, a magnetic anti-matter containment system that uses optical sensors to vary voltage the way an alternator in the car responds to voltage needs by powering the field up and down...  if you can imagine a task, it's possible to imagine a mechanical way to do it though you may sacrifice efficiency and mass.  If anyone here has read The Mote In God's Eye, the 'moties' there did pretty much everything without computers because they just flat out didn't need it.  Not because they were all geniuses, but because they had massive specialization.    What about species with biological abilities to solve different problems?  Q, the Farpoint aliensm, the Crystalline entity, and Tinman are just a few examples of living creatures that could travel FTL.  A species might ride these creatures like they do in Farscape or even have some of those abilities within themselves that they could apply to the hulls in which they lived.  There's a lot of precedent for warp without computers in the Star Trek universe, so I say aye."
DaystromInstitute,3bnod8,Chairboy,2,Tue Jun 30 23:40:09 2015 UTC,"It seems logical to me that a species might eschew computers for reasons ranging from technical to philosophical yet still engineer brilliant solutions to these problems.   The other issue here, is that many species who think they're getting along quite fine without computers, might actually have them and not know it.  Babbage's analytical engine was theoretically Turing-complete; he just couldn't get his parts precise enough to actually get it to work.  It didn't look remotely like what we associate with a computer, as well.  Then you've got things like sundials, astrolabes, and the Antikythera Mechanism; none of which are actual computers, but could technically be referred to as mechanical expert systems of sorts.  All a computer actually is, is something that changes mathematics from being static to dynamic via electricity, (i.e., you can actually perform automated mathematics in real time) and which allows you to attach events to mathematical state changes.  So if I set up a counter which increments a variable, then with each increment, I can specify that the new number corresponds with a different action.  As a result of this, in my own head at least, electricity, the logic gates, and the truth table are the three ""tech tree"" prerequisites of computers.  If you have those three things, then you can make a computer out of pretty much anything you want; all you need are objects to express state changes and different numbers, and the electricity to drive said state changes automatically.    The only reason why we've moved from valves to chips, is because we can put more circuits on chips, which means they require both less space and electricity, which means more efficiency.  The fun part, however, is that efficiency actually comes with a tradeoff in that sense; it makes things less transparent.  If I use Bash's pre-made loop functions when writing scripts, for example, then I'm using something which isn't actually allowing me to see what the computer is doing.   So to get efficiency you compound your working parts, but that hinders your ability to see what is really going on, because you don't have all your parts laid out naked on the table.  Computers are only hard to understand when you can't think with a certain (very limited, actually) level of abstractness; which is to say, in terms of pure numbers which are not necessarily related to physical objects.  The way you get around that, however, is to use the principle of Analogy and always have oranges or rice grains or light bulbs in your imagination; and then it's easy.  Once you get past the necessary point, I would expect it to become more difficult not to invent a computer, than to invent one; because when you have the groundwork, it's a very natural progression.  It only isn't if you don't."

I won't say impossible, because that's bad science, but Alcubierre's equations rely on negative mass, for which we have zero evidence and very little reason to believe it exists. Furthermore, his calculations estimate an amount of energy equal to all energy in the universe to work IIRC. I believe someone made some tweaks to Alcubierre's work which would lower the energy requirement to something close to a large supernova, but even then the idea of creating that kind of energy, let alone containing or harnessing it, is inconceivable.  I honestly believe we will achieve faster-than light travel at some point in the distant future, but I don't think it will happen based on Alcubierre's work."
DaystromInstitute,3bnod8,petrus4,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:02:55 2015 UTC,"My theory is that something similar to the Alcubierre equations were developed in the Star Trek universe, well before Cochrane's time, but it was the discovery of subspace that served as the ""missing link"" which allowed the equations to be used to create an actual usable warp drive."
DaystromInstitute,3bnod8,Neo_Techni,3,Wed Jul 1 10:06:32 2015 UTC,"The problem here, is one of precision.  If I want to be absolutely sure that I'm only measuring a single microgram of antimatter, then I don't know of any method other than digital control, that is going to allow me to do that; and if I don't get things that precise, then the consequences could be disastrous.  I personally am starting to believe that generalised computer systems are the wrong way to go in engineering terms; because if you design a computer that is supposed to be capable of anything, then you have to design it to also do everything, which you can't possibly hope to do.  So for me, a warp drive control system would ideally be something that didn't have a general operating system (like UNIX, or the Starfleet equivalent) on it.  It would instead have registers for opening and closing the antimatter release gate, and then it would also have a Turing-complete language (and a very simple one; something which gave me basic loops and counters would be enough) which would allow me to automate the opening and closing of said gate, at specific times; and that's all.  Such a system would also be much easier to design and implement than a multi-purpose computer.  As long as you had electricity, knowledge of the logic gates, and the truth table, then you could do it.  If you've got AND and NAND gates, then you are already Turing-complete, whether or not you actually know it."

If you assume that you've got centralised, generic computers, following the UNIX or mainframe model, (which at least the Galaxy class did) then yes, that single computer is going to need to be as powerful as Skynet.  If, on the other hand, all you're doing is writing basic CNC for each device, where all you really need is power on, power off, registers for each hardware function, and loops for automated work, then in many cases a 6502 (the commodore 64 processor) will be enough per device.  Decentralisation confers other benefits; you have no single point of failure, and power requirements can be less as well, because you only have some individual things running when you need them, rather than everything turned on all at once."
DaystromInstitute,3bm7hf,bakhesh,13,Tue Jun 30 10:13:46 2015 UTC,"Its a question of power, and power alone. It takes a lot of energy to hold such a heavy object up in an atmosphere, especially one that doesn't rely on aerodynamics for lift. Its just raw, brute force that holds it up. Thrusters blast downwards to create an equal and opposite reaction to keep the ship aloft.  Fortunately a starship is quite capable of generating immense amounts of power. It would have to have a fully operational warp core to generate enough power for this much lift, but its doable. A starship could hover in an atmosphere if it wanted to. There isn't much point to this as a starship's weapons and sensor range allow it to reach a planet's surface from orbit, but it could stay within an atmosphere if there was reason to. A starship's sublight engines are powerful enough to rapidly accelerate to a significant percentage of the speed of light. Merely hovering and defeating an M-class planet's gravity would be trivial for these engines.  Landing safely, without damaging the bottom of the hull, is something else entirely. The starship would need to have some sort of landing struts or other way to land. Any starship could slowly lower itself down onto the surface of a planet, but without landing struts the ship would likely damage itself.  Intrepid class starships definitely do have landing struts. It is very likely that Galaxy class starships also have landing struts of some kind because Galaxy class starships were constructed in part or in whole on the ground at Utopia Planitia."
DaystromInstitute,3bm7hf,Hyndis,8,Tue Jun 30 15:27:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with nearly everything you wrote.  With the exception that the Galaxy class have landing struts.  The ships may have been started on the ground because working in gravity is easier.  I don't think it follows that the ship has landing struts though.  Modern day ocean ships for example are built in dry dock on land, but they don't have wheels.   (Building them on the ground does raise the question of the best way to get the pieces into orbit.  Tractor beams from another ship maybe?)  Also, while the TNG Tech Manual is not cannon, it does not show landing struts or mention landing struts."
DaystromInstitute,3bm7hf,mistakenotmy,8,Tue Jun 30 15:49:58 2015 UTC,"That is a good point. The physical shape of the hull might make landing safely on a planet impossible for this ship.  While the Galaxy class starship has some sort of way to hold it upright and in place on the ground, it might just be a temporary thing that is later on removed, much like a drydock's supports.  The shape of a Galaxy class starship's hull is such that landing would be very awkward at best. Its secondary hull is too small and too far back. Its primary hull is too big, heavy, and forward. Installing landing struts in the secondary hull might not do any good simply because the ship would tip over and fall forward due to its shape. Its off-balance. Its center of gravity is not over the lowest part of the ship, its significantly forward."
DaystromInstitute,3bm7hf,Hyndis,3,Tue Jun 30 16:01:15 2015 UTC,"I have to think that on a number of Starfleet ships, the gravitational pull of Earth/InsertPlanetHere would damage them seriously. The nacelles just seem like they would be way to heavy to remain balanced on the pylons without the pylons buckling.   You can clearly see a difference in the back end design of the Intrepid in comparison to most other starships of the period; almost as if that was a consideration in the ships design."
DaystromInstitute,3bm7hf,zer0number,7,Tue Jun 30 16:07:20 2015 UTC,"Nah, 1g is not really a problem for the ship.  Always remember the Structural Integrity Field (SIF) is a very important system! :)  From the TNG Tech Manual (non-canon):   The Enterprise is dependent upon its structural integrity field to maintain the spaceframe during the tremendous accelerations encountered during impulse flight as well as the differential subspace field stresses experienced during warp flight. The inertial damping field also provides vital cushioning to the fragile crew during such maneuvers. Without such protection, the spacecraft and crew are unable to survive accelerations in excess of 30 m/sec2 (approximately 3g) without serious structural damage to the spaceframe and severe—probably fatal—injury to the crew. By way of contrast, accelerations considerably in excess of 1,000g are not uncommon when under full impulse power."
DaystromInstitute,3bm7hf,mistakenotmy,2,Tue Jun 30 16:19:42 2015 UTC,"But the point always is, that this system then must   never fail while on the ground (do not shut down power. ever) be active at every step in the construction of the spaceframe   Both points seem highly improbable, given that Voyager, for example, does a major Nacelle Refit on the ground."
DaystromInstitute,3bm7hf,maweki,3,Tue Jun 30 19:08:26 2015 UTC,do not shut down power. ever   I would imagine that this would be equally important while in space.
DaystromInstitute,3bm7hf,Snedeker,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:19:12 2015 UTC,But only when parts of the ship are differentially acted upon by some force. The ISS and other wire-wrapped tin cans hold together fine without an SIF.
DaystromInstitute,3bm7hf,BraveryInc,2,Wed Jul 1 05:03:47 2015 UTC,"I thought we were talking about flight through atmosphere.  The SIF and IDF are always on anyway.  The only time they would be off, presumably, is when docked.  For a ship that did land on the ground the spacframe could support itself.  The quote even mentions acceleration up to 3g is ok. So on the ground (1g) you could turn both off."
DaystromInstitute,3bm7hf,mistakenotmy,2,Tue Jun 30 19:17:28 2015 UTC,"The Voyager has some design elements of Russian interceptors, namely the lift producing hull. The NX Enterprise has no real hull section which would create drag and is therefore better capable of atmospheric flights than the Galaxy class with the huge engineering section. The Galaxy class could only stay in the air by brute thruster force.  The saucer section on its own is a different story and it should be able to stay in the air without using all energy reserves within 5 minutes."
DaystromInstitute,3bm7hf,Hellstrike,2,Wed Jul 1 09:40:29 2015 UTC,"That is a good point. The physical shape of the hull might make landing safely on a planet impossible for this ship.   But the Galaxy does have the ability to remove that hull which would make the landing portion more sensible.  Since you would detach the hull to protect the civilians on board while the drive section engages in dangerous operations, it would make sense that atmospheric landing would require saucer separation."
DaystromInstitute,3bm7hf,Lagkiller,4,Tue Jun 30 17:22:35 2015 UTC,Then perhaps the saucer and hull were constructed separately on the ground resting on their respective landing struts and then later joined.
DaystromInstitute,3bm7hf,nikchi,2,Tue Jun 30 18:17:15 2015 UTC,why do you state that working in gravity is easier? wouldnt the opposite be in fact true? something of this size needs the ease of floating large \ heavy pieces around and approaching them from every angle.
DaystromInstitute,3bm7hf,dishpandan,3,Tue Jun 30 18:02:52 2015 UTC,"Well they are obviously building part of it on the ground.  So there must be a reason it is easier.  I can think of a few.  You don't have to worry about being in space (life support).  Not being encumbered by a space suit is going to let people work faster, and more of them."
DaystromInstitute,3bm7hf,mistakenotmy,5,Tue Jun 30 18:40:26 2015 UTC,"If any of the major components are made using additive manufacturing, it's easier to do that under gravity where the object being manufactured has fewer ways to float or spin about.  Similarly, if any of the metal or composite pieces require injection moulding or coating, gravity would help minimize voids in the material being flowed.   Further, during the assembly process, gravity means that any broken material or loose components will have fewer opportunities to get stuck behind some panel."

DaystromInstitute,3bm7hf,mistakenotmy,3,Tue Jun 30 16:43:30 2015 UTC,in real life arent our space stations assembled in orbit? each segment can be brought up there separately to make it easier to break gravity and also split up the costs. consider how unwieldy the iss is and its a fraction of the size of a starship. the amount of materials alone would probably come from various planets and not just earth -- why bring those down to the ground just to expend a ton of fuel to get them back up into space?
DaystromInstitute,3bm7hf,dishpandan,2,Tue Jun 30 18:06:41 2015 UTC,"Some part must be done on the ground.  Maybe it is just the major structures and outer hull and then the pieces are lifted to orbit.  I assume getting mass to orbit must not be cost prohibitive by that point in the future.  I don't know why they are built on the ground.  The number of workers working on it may mean it is easier to have them and all the support (materials, tools, construction equipment, etc) on the ground.  Just going by the evidence we have. Part of the build is done that way (we see it in both the reboot Enterprise and at least one Galaxy Class ship)."

(A better argument may be that the image comes from an alternate quantum reality.  It is possible that reality does build ships on the ground vs. the normal reality.  On the flip side I doubt construction techniques would diverge that much.)   Edit:  I myself had forgotten that image came from ""Parallels"" and an alternate universe.

DaystromInstitute,3bm7hf,mistakenotmy,2,Tue Jun 30 21:21:21 2015 UTC,"Most of the alternate timelines in Parallels are strikingly similar to the prime timeline. There seem to only be a few minor differences which snowballed to create those other timelines. Perhaps Starfleet was defeated three years prior at Sector 001. That one created desperate hobo-Riker as Captain in a falling apart Enterprise-D. Just one changed event can make all the difference. Up until that point its likely that everything was identical. Every time someone went left when they could have gone right is a decision that spawned a new possible reality.  Even still, building a Galaxy class starship either in whole or in part on the ground is canon in at least one universe where Starfleet exists.  That other universe where the Galaxy class was on the ground was so similar to the prime universe that Worf couldn't tell the difference. Since Worf wasn't even aware he was seeing a different reality I suspect that they built their ships the same way as in the prime universe."

DaystromInstitute,3bm7hf,robbdire,2,Tue Jun 30 15:09:57 2015 UTC,It really wouldn't be that much space though. You could literally just glue them to the bottom of the ship. You could even just replicate them and beam them onto the outside of the ship when needed
DaystromInstitute,3bm7hf,Lagkiller,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:14:14 2015 UTC,If I recall correctly the Defiant can indeed land due to it's small size. The episode where they encounter their descendent as the Defiant is thrown back in time when leaving a planet.
DaystromInstitute,3bm7hf,dishpandan,2,Tue Jun 30 19:35:06 2015 UTC,"Also the E-D's atmospheric trouble's were hogwash. The E-D's shields routinely withstood strikes from torpedoes and disrupters that were far more powerful than than the heat produced by re-entry.   They weren't doing re-entry though, they were passing through the atmosphere at impulse speeds (faster than re-entry) which would generate far more heat than simple re-entry."
DaystromInstitute,3bm7hf,MageTank,3,Tue Jun 30 17:18:43 2015 UTC,"ive wondered this as well. in addition to it being a big deal for the enterprise D, it was a big enough deal even for voyager that they introduced the blue alert system.   until i saw the nutrek movies, i just thought the big ships were too massive to escape gravity safely (safely for the planet, not the crew) -- even though they have engines capable of impulse and warp, that is just too powerful to use here. i dont have any technical links to explain this, its just the feeling i got from watching all the shows and movies."
DaystromInstitute,3bllim,cptnpiccard,11,Tue Jun 30 05:22:57 2015 UTC,"While I pretty much agree with your post, I'll try to Daystrom some of these points.  1, 2, 3: Keep in mind the old age and the extraordinarily slow progress of Bajoran civilization.  We can assume that, while designed to be sublight, the lightship was also not an early design and was a Bajoran spacecraft at a point when spacetravel had become the norm and interplanetary travel within their system was commonplace.  This would rationalize the use of lumber, as a major interior material for a lot of the more decorative elements.  Also, we don't have any evidence that the sabersaw is a crude tool.  There's also the possibility that there is a unique form of lumber available on Bajor that has properties that allows it to be an excellent material for spacecraft and as spaceworthy as metals, alloys, and other traditional materials.  5, 8: In our world, tachyons are, at best theoretical, at worst complete fiction.  Therefore, that these solar sails use tachyons means we have no idea how they behave or what sail design would maximize their use or efficiency.  We also don't know what unique properties they have.  Considering how tachyons are often involved in time travel, it could very well be that inertial dampeners aren't necessary because of some sort of spacetime phenomena that shields those inside.  Again... were essentially talking about something that may not exist.  7: Why does it require a computer?  The thing has no engine.  The episode never goes into the original purpose of the lightship.  It could simply be a basic, recreational vehicle - literally a space sailboat.  The Bajorans may have had other space vehicles that had engines and computers and were intended for scientific research or space exploration."
DaystromInstitute,3bllim,rextraverse,10,Tue Jun 30 08:47:02 2015 UTC,"Regarding #3 NASA actually used to ""decorate"" the external tank on the shuttle by painting it completely white (the tank is orange metal). It wasn't until they realized that the paint weighed about 600 lb and was a huge waste that they stopped using it. Check out these images from STS-1 and STS-2: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_launching.jpg http://www.spacefacts.de/graph/drawing/drawings2/sts-2_pad.jpg  So in other words, we decorate. Even the rocket scientists at NASA when designing a utilitarian space-vehicle. There's also the USA stencil on the wing, the American flag, and other non-functional decorations."
DaystromInstitute,3bllim,bachrach44,5,Tue Jun 30 11:37:44 2015 UTC,"I could probably believe the part where they build a spaceship out of wood. Wood is not that bad if you take the right kind for each purpose. From what I just found Bamboo has almost as much tensile strength as aluminium. And Bajor maybe has even better wood than earth. Given some clever organic sealing substances it would be believable to me that they have built this ship.  But given that they had the technology and materials to build a sail-ship of this kind, how would they get it into orbit? It certainly is impossible to built a heavy-lifter rocket out of these materials. So if they had the technology to build rockets with modern materials, why did they not build this ship out of modern materials in the first place."
DaystromInstitute,3bllim,Lucius_Martius,6,Tue Jun 30 10:03:33 2015 UTC,"Bajor is a very, very old civilization. Bajor was old before the Iconians ever rose to power. Bajor was around long before the Borg assimilated their first anything. Bajor was old before humanity even existed as a species. Bajor is one of the oldest known civilizations.  This means that Bajor has had plenty of time to develop both art and science. They didn't just pray the solar sail ship into space. They launched it. Possibly with chemical rockets, possibly with something more advanced. Bajor had a full blown space program. The only thing that Bajor seemed to lack was warp drive. For some reason Bajoran scientists had failed to invent warp drive.  Their civilization flourished for half a million years but they were confined to their star system due to a lack of FTL. Half a million years is a very long time. I'm sure Bajor had thoroughly explored their entire star system using sublight ships, such as ships with chemical rockets, ion drives, or solar sails.  The lightship is also far more advanced than Earth spacecraft of the early 21st century. This is the interior of Earth's only human-rated spacecraft of the early 21st century.  Compared to this, Bajoran engineering is orders of magnitude more sleek and efficient. Earth's space program of the 21st century is banging rocks together compared to Bajor's space program. Bajor has had a very, very long time to perfect it.  And why not use wood? Wood will not rot in space. Wood can be shaped to whatever form is required. Wood is strong, lightweight, and flexible. Wood absolutely does have uses even in a modern environment. Even the Enterprise-D used wood on its bridge."
DaystromInstitute,3bllim,Hyndis,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:20:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is at the crux of the problem I think. It's trying to be ""castaways in space"", with stuff made out of wood and handheld instruments. It's just anachronistic..."
DaystromInstitute,3bllim,BraveryInc,2,Tue Jun 30 16:03:29 2015 UTC,"Wood is basically cellulose and starch. Both of those structured materials naturally occur in abundant but variety, yielding materials with ranges of potentially useful combinations of properties in strength, weight, flexibility, porosity, etc.   It would not be difficult to design a research program to domesticate/engineer a grass or a tree having few knots, uniform characteristics, etc. With a little more effort, it might be possible to run elastomers up the xylem and phloem right before harvest, or to prime the extra-cellular spaces to favour the formation of certain kinds of lignin when chemically or energetically treated."
DaystromInstitute,3bllim,KingofDerby,5,Wed Jul 1 05:40:54 2015 UTC,"This is not NASA making a scientific mission. It's NASA being commissioned by a space monastery...  1-3: The needless decoration is to respect the Gods. The primitive materials and tools to make it and to fly it are to make sure that those involved keep a spiritual connection to the project.  6-7: There's no science stuff because it's not a science mission, it's a religious one. There's no long term life support because the Gods will provide.  Bajor's NASA had probably been making orbital vessels, space stations, Mars-like missions and Space Cathedrals for years, so it's not a prototype.   8: The ship was not designed for warp speed travel. It was designed to float about until either the Prophets gave them a sign or the monk on-board died of starvation/asphyxiation. In the end, the monks were lucky, for the Prophets did provide. The vessels stumbled into a phenomenon that moved them and warp speed relative to space, but motionless relative to what's in the eddy."

DaystromInstitute,3bllim,time_axis,4,Tue Jun 30 16:01:14 2015 UTC,"yeah, but there's no need to have the cocoon style hammock with gravity in place, it could have just been a simple change."
DaystromInstitute,3bllim,duodsg,3,Tue Jun 30 16:07:36 2015 UTC,"The lumber was for the interior.  The floor was made of wooden planks.  The actual ship was obviously not made of wood.  We could clearly see that.  The saw was for the wood flooring, of course.  It has so many decorative traits because this is Bajor, not Earth.  They weren't funding a space program like NASA, they were sending a vessel to seek out their gods who live in the sky.  Bajorans are a very spiritual people.  And as for the hammocks, Sisko brought those himself.  The original probably had no designated place to sleep.  They could have just slept anywhere.  As for the physics of it, of course that doesn't make much sense, but you don't really expect them to have a rocket scientist come in and design them a practical solar sailboat design for their TV show, do you?"
DaystromInstitute,3bllim,Lmaoboat,3,Wed Jul 1 02:57:50 2015 UTC,"I know some of these points have been covered by others, but it makes me feel better when I've covered everything. So here goes.   Lumber wasn't what the outside ship was made of. It's a strong material that doesn't rot or decay in space, and could've been used for the interior components. He could use a ""saber saw"" to cut the wood from #1, not a welding torch or whatever (we see him using a welding torch, but obviously on metal components). It could also be that ""saber saw"" means something else for the Bajorans. Just because we have an idea of what a hammer should look like on Earth doesn't mean it looks identical to every culture in the universe. You could ask this same question about why the Enterprise-D has so many decorations- they're totally unnecessary there too! Answer: it's not just a cultural thing, but rather a reflection of how advanced your space program was. Our spacecraft look very utilitarian and bare-bones because it costs us a fortune to just sent a small payload into low Earth orbit, even more outside of that and into the rest of the Solar System. If the Bajorans were actively exploring their star system, they had plenty of expertise and were advanced enough not to have to resort to building ""primitive"" spacecraft like the ones we have today, which are not exactly homey and cozy. Even the ""early designs"" for the Bajorans were clearly more advanced than our own, since our manned spacecraft don't go farther than the Moon, so comparing their space program to NASA's seems like a moot point to me. The hammocks could've been an additional modification from the original design, and obviously it doesn't alter the flight characteristics or capabilities of the ship. There are cranks on every manned spacecraft we have here on Earth as well, so that point is irrelevant (it's harder to do than on Earth, but they are still there to manually lock or close down structural components when power fails). The whole ""the ship is on a vertical axis"" point doesn't make sense because the Space Shuttle and every other manned spacecraft also has a clear ceiling and floor. The problem with your argument here is that you're comparing the Bajoran light ship to the ISS- in that case, there is no true floor or ceiling, but that isn't a ship- that's an installation meant to stay in space, not travel from point A to point B. Sails were just like the interior- did their job while still being decorative. Plus for all we know, tachyons are more effectively harnessed using that shape of sail. We have no frame of reference to say that it looks wrong on screen based on our current scientific knowledge. The internal volume is empty space because the Bajorans probably packed it full of supplies since they didn't know how long their journey would be. Sisko wasn't expecting to be marooned out there with Jake- he has a job as station commander, he can't afford to be out there that long. It seems to me like they're just spending a week on a yacht near to shore. I don't know about you, but I don't pack my car the same way when I go on a brief road trip compared to how I pack when I'm moving and may never get back home again (aka to the brim). They do make the experience more ""authentic"" by eating non-replicated rations, sure, but they're not going to pack up all their stuff and take it with them for a week-long trip. Plus there's no need for much by way of scientific instruments- starship sensors are much more powerful than anything they could pack on that little ship. They're not there to explore new things along the route like the ancient Bajorans- they're there for the whole ""I'm on a road trip"" thing. Why lug around a computer when the calculations are so basic that you can do them using an astrolabe? Why bring them if your ship has no engine? Why do it when power is probably at a premium in such a small spacecraft? My car has a computer in it but not because I couldn't possibly travel without it- it's there because of advanced features the car has. A model T can get me to where I need to go just as well, but of course it's not as efficient and its constructed differently. Same comparison between the Bajoran light ship and future Federation starships, for example. He doesn't have backups because he doesn't expect anything crazy to happen, and again, he has a job he needs to get back to, so people WILL go looking for him and he's in a region of space that has plenty of ships flying around. Someone is bound to find him and help in a relatively short amount of time. I don't have a good explanation for why the astrolabe has a gravity weight on it, but perhaps that's another modification from the original. The Bajorans clearly had something that allowed them to navigate without gravity, and it was incompatible with the gravity plating. Sisko probably just found an Earth analogue to it that could do the same job. For this one, I submit that there's something about the Denorios Belt that allows this transition to very fast speeds possible without absolutely destroying the occupants. Sure, in the very first episode of the series we see DS9 get almost ripped apart when traveling through it, but that's because A) the station is using some lateral thrusters to propel itself- never meant to be used this way, B) the station has a huge mass, and moving at that speed will inevitably cause damage, and C) by using thrusters, you're creating stress points along the hull that can't dissipate the energy of movement while traveling. On a Bajoran light ship, it's MEANT to catch those tachyons and channel them into a structure that can allow that propulsive energy to not tear the ship apart (aka the sails). Plus you're leaving out a big component of it too- the Prophets. They can certainly have altered that region of space--and anyone traveling through it--to make sure there's a safe passage through it.   That's the best I've got."
DaystromInstitute,3bllim,harmingcola,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:01:13 2015 UTC,"That last one seems to be the most egregious. They were somehow physically accelerated by tachyons, rather than traditional Trek space-warping shenanigans, so shouldn't they A, be traveling faster than infinity,and  B, have their most basic elements scattered across all of time and space from the sheer force? Not to mention if tachyons can do that to a primitive solar sail, they could probably be going around accelerating all sorts of things."
DaystromInstitute,3bllim,duodsg,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:17:11 2015 UTC,What annoyed me more about that ship was how did they get it out of the Bajoran atmosphere? Surely a wooden ship would have caught fire if launched on a rocket?
DaystromInstitute,3bllim,androidbitcoin,2,Thu Jul 2 15:20:13 2015 UTC,"You're assuming that the Bajoran light ship was just sitting on the top of the rocket, exposed, when even we use fairings (the protective, aerodynamic ""cones"") over our payloads to protect them while in transit.  Being that Bajor's space-fairing capabilities were pretty advanced, who is to say they even launched it into space? The reason we do that is because we have zero infrastructure or method to build spacecraft in orbit around Earth. They could very well have just shuttled the materials up to space and assembled such a ""small"" ship in orbit."

DaystromInstitute,3bjw0m,Ampu-Tina,15,Tue Jun 30 03:31:59 2015 UTC,"I see two possibilities:  either the cytherians didn't provide the absolute coordinates for their system (they might have given the federation a very general idea of where their hw is but the galaxy is still a very big place), being homebodies and all who probably like when they invite guests, but not when the guests figure out how to come knocking on their own (far as I can tell, starfleet couldn't replicate what broc, barclay made on the holodeck and the probe was blown up)... or the cytherians provided the federation with info that was made super classified.

In Contact, it is stated that the machine will not work again. In Nth Degree, Barclay states he remembers doing it, just not how he did it - effectively, the machine will not work again.  Perhaps, after their interaction, Picard is told this is it. No further trips to Cytherian space until they are ready to join them as equals, and that further attempts at contact would go unanswered.  It seems a fitting parallel to Sagan to bring this conclusion to the Cytherians as well. Knowing they are there, waiting and watching to see if we make it."

Realistically, this is done for expository purposes, but in-universe it rarely makes sense for the computer to be so deliberately obtuse.  /u/lyraseven does bring up a possible explanation for why they don't, however: maybe the path to the core was completely blocked by Borg space. There's indications by the end of the series that they're nearing the Beta/Gamma border; the main reason they'd even cross through the Beta Quadrant would be if they couldn't pass near the center for some reason, and the Borg are a pretty good reason why."
DaystromInstitute,3bjw0m,MercurialMithras,5,Mon Jun 29 22:55:07 2015 UTC,"I think what some people (myself included) are suggesting is that the ship's computer is perfectly capable of behaving much like Google is today - hell, their database probably behaves like Wikipedia.  Federation computers are more sophisticated than you perhaps recall; for example, in TNG: Schisms the computer is able to re-create, from the scattered and vague descriptions the various crew members discussed of their shared dreams, a table that looks close enough to that which appeared in the crews' dreams to be useful to them. This is very advanced artificial intelligence; imagine being able to describe to Siri something you saw in a dream and half-remember and have Siri conjure up a picture of it for you.  On another occasion (Elementary, dear Data) the ship's computer on board Enterprise is able to create a sentient hologram in a matter of moments based on an extreme interpretation of a vague command that, if the computer really were as unsophisticated as you think, it would have rejected or at least asked for elaboration upon.  As a final example, a mere missile - not even a proper ship that would need an especially advanced voice interface - in VOY: Dreadnought was able to both follow, interpret and respond appropriately in the following exchange:   JANEWAY [OC]: Until the missile reaches the planet.

TORRES: I'm reluctant to discuss them in present company, but could you send over a. Captain?  DREADNOUGHT: Communications have been terminated. Transporter lock has also been disengaged.  TORRES: What took you so long?  DREADNOUGHT: There was a tactical advantage in monitoring your ship's communications until this time.  TORRES: So, it's just you and me now.  DREADNOUGHT: You are accessing the detonation control circuit. Probability assessment indicates you are attempting to detonate the explosive before it reaches its target.  TORRES: Now, that wouldn't make much sense, would it? I'd be killing myself in the process.  DREADNOUGHT: Probability assessment indicates you are attempting to detonate the explosive before it reaches its target.  TORRES: If I'm being coerced by Cardassians, why would I be willing to sacrifice myself for them? Answer that one.  DREADNOUGHT: Unable to respond. Reassessing probabilities.  TORRES: Ah, ha. Gotcha. Why don't we reassess those probabilities together, okay? Remember how we used to play hypothetical games?  DREADNOUGHT: Affirmative.  TORRES: Let's play one now. Here's a hypothetical situation for you. Suppose I've been telling you the truth all along, and you really are in the Delta quadrant.  DREADNOUGHT: Probability of being in the Delta quadrant, seventy five thousand light years from last confirmed location, is negligible.  TORRES: Hypothetical, Dreadnought. It's a game, remember? Assume it's true for a moment.  DREADNOUGHT: Assumption entered.  TORRES: And we're heading for the wrong target.  DREADNOUGHT: Assumption entered.  TORRES: Millions of innocent people about to die when you detonate.  DREADNOUGHT: Assumption entered.  TORRES: Now, explain to me how this might happen.  DREADNOUGHT: If key sensor programmes were damaged or deleted, databanks would be compromised.  TORRES: Just for the fun of it, let's have a look at those databanks. See if anything looks at all compromised.  (A display comes up on a wall monitor.)  TORRES: Is this a complete file directory? There seem to be a few missing.  DREADNOUGHT: Files containing information about the weapons or tactical systems are not necessary to verify sensor accuracy.  TORRES: Oh, I'm hurt you don't trust me. Hold on, pause the display. What's that? Computer, identify the Cardassian file on screen.  DREADNOUGHT: Unable to identify.  TORRES: Looks like a back-up file. Computer, when was this file created?  DREADNOUGHT: Stardate 46437.5  TORRES: I believe that was before you and I ever met.  DREADNOUGHT: Hypothetical game terminated. Probability reassessment complete.  TORRES: A new conclusion?  DREADNOUGHT: Affirmative. Probability of being in the Delta quadrant remains negligible. When that option is rejected, new probability assessment indicates that you have changed loyalties, B'Elanna. You are now cooperating with the Cardassian Federation Alliance as described in the treaty of 2367, a treaty which has been rejected by the Maquis.  TORRES: Dreadnought.  DREADNOUGHT: Humanoid life support aboard this vessel has been terminated. Approaching target at full impulse. Stage one alert has been activated. Initiating final detonation sequence.   So I'm absolutely certain the computer would be able to display a list of known post-warp cultures if asked - and I'm also certain that multiple members of Voyager's crew would have asked, independently of each other, probably several times, looking for inspiration."
DaystromInstitute,3bjw0m,lyraseven,3,Tue Jun 30 07:21:25 2015 UTC,"I did touch on the subject of holograms in another comment, specifically questioning why the computer voice interface seems to be so lacking in relation to its capacities in the holodeck. That's one of the reasons why it REALLY doesn't make sense. And I don't think Dreadnought is a very good example, since it's a weird mishmash of Cardassian and Maquis technology. And either way, I'd say that's more an example of the ""leading questions"" approach than it is the computer helping to come up with independent ideas and solutions, or volunteering answers.  You're pointing to examples where extraordinary events happened (and all of which involve the holodeck), and ignoring all the times when it DOES ask for extra clarification in situations that don't really call for it. Bothering the Romulan Admiral Jarok in ""The Defector,"" for example--it couldn't figure out a conversion factor between Celsius and Romulan units? Or better still, just know the most common temperature for that beverage to be served? The computer on the Enterprise does this kind of thing ALL the time. Or Scotty trying to call up the Enterprise on the holodeck in ""Relics""--the computer isn't aware who's asking? He clearly had to have some degree of security clearance programmed into be able to use the holodeck in the first place. Again, in the story this is clearly serving a purpose towards the portrayal of their characters, but from an in-universe perspective this makes absolutely no sense. And that's frequently the case with the computer: its behavior varies from episode to episode in service to the plot, often in ways that are completely unrealistic for such an advanced system. Computers in real life will surpass the computers depicted in Trek within our lifetimes, easily.  And again, I'm not saying they couldn't get that information. Just that it would be a needlessly drawn out process compared to what one might realistically expect of computers with hundreds of years of User Experience improvement."
DaystromInstitute,3bjw0m,MercurialMithras,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:17:18 2015 UTC,"He clearly had to have some degree of security clearance programmed into be able to use the holodeck in the first place.   Certainly not; anyone can use the holodeck to an extent. The safety restrictions can only be removed by the appropriate level of authority, but anyone can access it to some degree - we see Lwaxana Troi and Alexander Rozhenko use it together with no Starfleet personnel around to authorize it in TNG: Cost of Living.   Even if you believe Lwaxana would have been granted basic permissions as a regular visitor and high-ranking dignitary, Alexander also uses the holodeck alone and without his father's knowledge or consent in TNG: New Ground - and to participate in a violent calisthenics/combat exercise, no less.   In VOY: Once Upon a Time we see Naomi Wildman use it alone seemingly at will.  As for the computer failing to show Bones his Enterprise, well of course it asks for clarification. There are many ships sharing the designation Enterprise and just because he comes from a prior one doesn't mean he wants to see his. For all the computer knows he wanted to see its successors in chronological order, or the current one to see how it compared. It'd be absurd for the computer to rely on its own inferences in order to display data; it's much faster to simply ask for clarification and show the correct data first time than to show its best guess.   Computers in real life will surpass the computers depicted in Trek within our lifetimes, easily.   Sure, but that's not the question at hand. The question at hand was is the computer capable of displaying on command a list of known post-warp cultures and I think we've established that it can manage that with zero trouble."
DaystromInstitute,3bjw0m,BraveryInc,3,Tue Jun 30 01:34:00 2015 UTC,"Well first I'd say that there's got to be some security clearance. I don't think an intruder could be aboard the ship and start using the Holodeck. Once they set up Scotty with quarters on the ship, that'd be part of his clearance. Anyone who's a known passenger on the ship would then be allowed to interact with the computer at whatever level they're cleared for.  Aside from that, we're having completely different arguments. I'm exclusively talking about the usability of the computer. We're waaaayyy off the topic of Voyager at this point. My initial point wasn't that the computer would be unable to call up such a list, just that it's frequently depicted as being rather poor at relaying information to the point where Starfleet officers, who have to interact with it on a regular basis, will snap at it and interrupt it because the means in which it does so is rather inefficient. It will start verbally listing 40+ entry lists, like in ""Darmok,"" without asking.   And no, I don't think computers using context to divine intent is ridiculous. It's very commonplace already. Scotty specifically says ""his old ship,"" and then clarifies ""Enterprise""--It's either the 1701, or the 1701-A. Those are the only options if the computer would run a simple check against Scotty's service record, which it is very capable of doing in an instant. A computer as advanced as the ones in Starfleet should be able to anticipate most requests and divine meaning from seemingly vague requests much better than it does. If I search Google for ""The bald guy that captains the Enterprise"" it will bring up the Wikipedia article for Jean-Luc Picard. This is something that's beyond Starfleet computers and there's no possible justification in-universe why."

I think Geordi summoning up the hologram of Leah Brahms is a good indication that the computer is frustrating to use in that fashion. They don't ask the computer for help directly very often, but they do frequently ask it leading questions that are used to form or confirm a theory. Doctor Crusher in ""Remember Me,"" for example. ""What is the nature of the universe?"" Data in particular has a tendency to do this, which is especially puzzling since he seems to possess a similar level of information. Unfortunately no specific instances of him doing it come to mind (Perhaps early on in ""Masks""). It's just doesn't make much sense when you think about it too hard; if the computer can create such perfectly real holograms, why isn't the vocal interface at least that good at understanding and interpreting intent?"

It'd be a massive stretch to suggest that no one was familiar with any previous incidents involving post-warp societies closer to home (and potentially even avoiding Borg space), and an even bigger stretch to imagine no one thinking to ask the computer for information on past occasions Starfleet ships were accidentally dragged a long distance away, and therefore stumble upon the events of Q Who and The Nth Degree.  I wouldn't even be surprised if the Academy actually had an entire course on super-advanced aliens - they certainly had 'Q 101' and 'Introduction to the Borg' style classes, and Future!Janeway even teaches the latter."

It's like if in a road trip film where they need to get somewhere, they take an obviously laborious route. Fine, but explain why, otherwise the audience is just taken out of its immersion by thinking 'this was all sort of...optional, wasn't it?' With Voyager, the fact that 'getting home' is the single most talked about thing on the show, but they fail to even offer basic established solutions to that problem makes the 'getting home' problem feel less significant. Or that they're stupid or they didn't want to get home at all. Which is the point of the show.   A simple offhand remark would be fine. 'Why don't we go through the core Captain?'

Even accounting for the more extraordinary stuff that happened in TOS and TNG she would probably get to entries near the galactic core in about a few hours of reading.  And if I'd even consult some of my tech guys they would probably whip up some database-fu-magic that could spit out all known species that have the capability to send me home within seconds and order them by proximity as well. The Cytherians would probably be at the very top of that short list.  Also more optimistically thanks to the ""what-you-want-is-what-you-get"" Interface of the 24th century starfleet computers access to such information is just a vague voice command away even for the most incompetent captains."

DaystromInstitute,3bl8q3,bmoc,10,Wed Jul 1 00:21:07 2015 UTC,"The Borg have assimilated Federation personnel and databases. They're well aware of the Q. The Borg possess no threat to the Q whatsoever. The Q have complete control of space, matter and time.   I've always interpreted that statement as a Q's responsibility to limit their interference with less advanced races. Remember, the trial of Quinn mentioned explicitly the disastrous impacts that their interference caused. Q was suspended from the continuum due to his own meddling and Q2 was sanctioned as well.  I would presume that there is a Q ""Code of Honor"" that limits their ability to interfere with the developing universe. Playing tricks on Captain Picard is one thing, but altering the destiny of entire races is another thing altogether."
DaystromInstitute,3bl8q3,redditmdsks,11,Tue Jun 30 14:23:01 2015 UTC,"I always assumed that the Q had 'a plan' - or at least, a potential future in mind that they wished to allow to occur - for the Borg, and that our Q introduced them to the Federation for that purpose.  Think about it; Q showed up one day asking to be made a crew member, seemingly deliberately leading Picard into a grandiose statement of arrogance which Q could then 'test'. He never wanted to join the crew. While whimsical, and while perhaps not as contemptuous of humanity as he pretends to be, I nevertheless have a hard time imagining Q genuinely wishing to live among us for any period (other than when he needed protection).   Plus, once the Borg crisis is over and Picard has recanted his arrogance, Q makes no more mention of joining the crew, despite having far more weight to his argument now compared to previously. He never wanted in. So the one thing we're certain of that Q came to Picard with the goal of introducing the Federation to the Borg.  So what did he want to come of that? Well, like I suggested, possibly to guide the future on to the path preferred by the Q - or at least, preferred by himself, as most of the other Q seem to genuinely have no interest in the universe in general (they take the concept of nihil novi sub sole to an absurd degree). What's that path? Well, we get a few glimpses at 29th century Starfleet and they seem to be doing well for themselves, but it'd be incredibly arrogant and Federation-centric to assume that our wellbeing is Q's goal.   It's possible that we're beneath even pawns in a game spanning the kind of time we can't even contemplate. Perhaps our distant descendants will evolve - organically or technologically or spiritually or a combination of all of them will become relevant.  My guess? We're en route - in the very long term - to become almost Q-like ourselves. It's not so absurd, we've met many Sufficiently Advanced, almost magical aliens who from our perspective are almost Q-like.   We already know for certain that even 24th-century humans have the potential for magical-seeming abilities most of us can't comprehend; Wesley Crusher's experience with the Traveler demonstrated that. It's not such a stretch to imagine that in fifty thousand years we'll rival the Q, and that our Q is nudging events here and there to make that future more viable.  Why would Q want that?  Well, can you see us becoming a power the Q have to respect, without shaking things up a little? At least for a few eons? Perhaps all he wants is a few real playmates; intellectual and 'magical' equals, something he's lacked since Quinn was imprisoned - which, from the sounds of it, occurred not so long in Q terms before our Q started meddling with the Enterprise. Perhaps seeing that done to his mentor showed him the need for change, for more Q-like beings who value individuality to oppose the existing Q's enforced stagnation."
DaystromInstitute,3blgin,comradepitrovsky,6,Tue Jun 30 04:30:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on many points, although to be fair I haven't watched it in awhile. First and foremost you are 100% correct about Kes. It only gets worse. As far as B'Elanna and Janeway, they both tone it down a bit as they get to know the characters. Mulgrew continues to kind of over act though, it's kind of just her thing. She does it on OITNB too.   However, I don't think the Maquis were introduced specifically for this. I think they were introduced in TNG in order to set up DS9, but this was a useful way to tie back to the other shows. Sure, they could have been independent pirates or rebels or whatever but then it's harder to justify the brief DS9 crossover. It lends a sense of continuity to the world.  Edit: spelling"
DaystromInstitute,3blgin,randallflaggg,12,Tue Jun 30 04:50:26 2015 UTC,"Mulgrew continues to kind of over act though, it's kind of just her thing. She does it on OITNB too.   To be fair, this is kind of how Star Trek works. Star Trek has traditionally always used stage actors and emphatic, theatrical acting rather than anything naturalistic. Shatner famously overacted, Brooks overacted quite a bit as well, and Stewart was the only actor talented enough to exude a commanding presence without overacting. Mulgrew is one of the few highlights of Voyager. She's the captain--of course she isn't afraid to impose herself on a scene."
DaystromInstitute,3blgin,philwelch,5,Tue Jun 30 07:49:12 2015 UTC,"Janeway, timers exist. Use the array to get yourself home, and set a bomb.   Wasn't this considered and dismissed as the Kazon could have found a way onto the Array and disarmed the bomb after Voyager had left?"
DaystromInstitute,3blgin,Custard-donut,5,Tue Jun 30 06:38:11 2015 UTC,I don't think it would have been terribly difficult to set up some sort of security measure against that. The Kazon were shown to be largely incapable of handling Voyagers technology anyway.
DaystromInstitute,3blgin,StarTrekMike,6,Tue Jun 30 13:42:30 2015 UTC,The Borg didn't even want 'em.
DaystromInstitute,3blgin,GeorgeAmberson,6,Tue Jun 30 15:57:04 2015 UTC,"About water... sure it's somewhat available with a bunch of M class planets (probably even possible to find on less hospitable planets as ice or steam), but consider that the Kazon didn't have replicators or transporters. That region of the Delta quadrant didn't have these technologies readily available, otherwise the Kazon surely would have stolen or traded for it. They did have technology, but maybe they didn't work out Heisenberg compensators.  Now you've got to haul water with you wherever you go. Which implies food needs to be hauled, too, but we don't really know anything about Kazon cuisine and Neelix is more of a eat-what-you-find kind of fellow. You've got to get the water, too, even if it's plentiful, which is a huge hassle. It would likely need dedicated water collection and transport ships and fighter escorts since those cargo ships would likely want to maximize the amount of water in one trip. Then distribution within the sect. And, oh yeah, that water has to be sterilized and purified to be safe. I'm sure water waste would have been recycled, too, which is just another hassle.  Being able to materialize molecularly-pure water at will with just energy and specialized technology would have been a huge huge huge deal."
DaystromInstitute,3blgin,Northwait,7,Tue Jun 30 16:16:00 2015 UTC,"I have heard a lot of people complain about Mulgrew's voice. I never found myself bothered by it, but rest assured you are not alone in this. However i think it get;s better as the show goes on. My theory is she was trying to portray a stronger character, and part of what eventually makes her character so appealing is when she starts to let her guard down. I think the Maquis were initially introduced in TNG and primarily for the DS9 story arch to eventually explore. The main purpose of Voyager was the Borg story arch which doesn't arrive until much later in the shows run. The original concept i read about, was that Voyager was going to focus on a liberated Borg, the rest of the details i think were added simply to connect it. The Maquis i think were added in as a means to connect DS9 to Voyager and offer a more uniform story in the Federation overall. Starting the show off at DS9 was great, and was meant to be consistent with how DS9 started by having the Enterprise present. Just a way to connect the universes together. As for having Voyager be sent to pursue the Maquis, i thought it was because at the time it was the fastest ship and was far more maneuverable than any other in service allowing them to navigate the badlands more effectively. Can't argue with you on this one. Kes managed to irritate me far more the entertain :( and it's a bummer because the actress is very talented, the character was lacking though. I guess i never found an issue with this myself : / As you watch more of the show, i think you will find the implication here is that only this particular set of Kazon have a hard time accessing water. The Kazon are spread far across this area of space but they are divided into many factions, most of them at war with each other. This faction may simply not have the means to fight for control of better territory, so they may have to make do on crappy M-Class planets with little water since the stronger factions have taken all the good spots. Their technology is hinted as being far less advanced so they may lack the means to recycle effectively. Overall though, you will see the main purpose of that part of the story was to have a way to showcase that the Kazon do not have replicators and really really want one. It will come back later in the season. B'ellana blames her Klingon side for her temper, which is a homage of sorts to the character K'Ehleyr from TNG, who also claimed to have suffered from a bad temper due to her half Klingon side. However i think B'ellana just has a serious chip on her shoulder and uses it as an excuse, as the show progresses and she deals with her issues she gets a lot better at not turning into the Hulk. I thought that the deal was, they needed time to use the array to send themselves home, and in order to do so needed to make peace with the Kazon, but having already started on the wrong foot with them and having no intention of leaving the array intact for them, they ended up fighting over it. The Kazon were going to overwhelm Voyager as the battle went on and more reinforcements arrived so Janeway was left with only 1 good option. The other being doing her best to take on an entire Kazon fleet."
DaystromInstitute,3blgin,67thou,7,Tue Jun 30 18:02:01 2015 UTC,"I watched ""Caretaker"" years ago with my wife while we were doing our full watch-through of the TNG/DS9 era. We both agreed at the time that we weren't sold on the concept and didn't really feel the need to watch Voyager at the time, and we still haven't really gotten around to it. There are a lot of things you can say about the pilot, but it has a central, fatal flaw. As the viewer, you just plain don't care about the characters after seeing ""Caretaker"". Some of them do develop later on, but there's nothing hooking you in. This is almost unique to Voyager. Kirk and Spock are interesting almost from the outset (Spock more so), while Patrick Stewart singlehandedly elevates TNG just long enough to get the show off the ground and DS9 is entertaining for the sheer diversity of characters you're immediately introduced to, including the best Trek villain of all time, Gul Dukat. With Voyager, you just don't get that. Mulgrew is a powerful actress, but no actress could overcome the writing flaws behind Janeway. I've seen enough episodes to know that Janeway has her compelling moments, the EMH is entertaining, and Seven of Nine is compelling beyond the shallow sex appeal she was created for, but nothing in ""Caretaker"" gives you the sense that you're ever going to care about anyone on this show."
DaystromInstitute,3blgin,philwelch,2,Tue Jun 30 08:03:27 2015 UTC,"I've just started rewatching Voyager again. I still love ""Caretaker"". I think it's a solid pilot. But I agree on some of your points.   Mulgrew's voice annoys me for some unknown reason. It just really ticks me off hearing it.   Me too. Especially the way she says ""crew"". There's an upcoming episode where she says, ""pecan pie"" that my sister and I always joke about.   The problem with the Maquis thing is it wasn't exploited enough. The pilot ends with everyone given Starfleet uniforms and stuff. There will be more strife to come, but they tied their hands too quickly, I think.   As far as water goes, Neelix is something of a nomad. Because he doesn't have replication technology, he doesn't waste water the way Voyager does. He has it, he can find it, but he has to bottle it and make it last. The Kazon on the other hand, at least the Ogla, don't have much access to the water on their world because the Ocampa get it all. However, since they have interstellar ships, one wonders why they can't find water elsewhere. Maybe their vessels are close range. Then again, the Kazon are supposed to be very territorial so maybe they fight each other over water rights.   B'ellana -- your Klingon blood doesn't take you over and turn you into the Hulk. Calm down.   I think B'Elanna's supposed to be like K'ehlyr, blaming her temper on her Klingon side. K'ehlyr did smash a table once just out of frustration.    I'm excited to watch the next episode, at the very least.   The next couple episodes are not that good. As a kid, I found them disappointing enough to abandon the series for awhile. But ""Phage"" is pretty good, and there are a few others later in the season where things pick up."

DaystromInstitute,3blgin,GeorgeAmberson,2,Tue Jun 30 15:52:40 2015 UTC,"1) I like Kate Mulegrew and most of the main cast as actors, but the writing let them down and often made their characters annoying, bland or one-dimensional. With Janeway I feel like they overcompensated for her being the first female Captain in a main cast, by making her overbearingly headstrong, assertive and almost always right, to the point that she was rarely allowed moments of vulnerability like Kirk, Picard and Sisko.   2) They originally had a lot planned for the Maquis in Voyager, hence all the time spent developing  them in TNG and DS9. But, they wound up being pointless to the extent that Voyager might as well have just had an all Starfleet crew by the end of the first season. When Chakotay say's ""She's the Captain"" that's pretty much the end of the Maquis' importance to the series.   4) No one knew quite what to do with Kes, which is why she was unceremoniously dumped and replaced with Seven.  7) It took a long time for B'ellana to get past the ""GRRR I'm dealing with my angry half Klingon side!"" rut her character fell into, but she does get much better as the series goes on.   8) There are a lot of problems with the whole Caretaker situation, and multiple solutions that could have worked without stranding Voyager. It's been a while since I've watched the episode so I won't go into details, but it's been discussed at length on this sub."
DaystromInstitute,3blgin,iansarmy1,2,Tue Jun 30 20:57:41 2015 UTC,"I like Mulgrew's voice. Bit of personal preference (I have a thing for voices), bit of nostalgia, and a bit of freaking out because I'm watching her in a newer show where her character has a Russian accent and it hasn't stopped being weird. But I like her in both. I don't think Voyager is why the Maquis were introduced. I think DS9 did them better than VOY ever did. To me, they were an interesting faction in TOS/DS9 and unexplored potential in VOY. I always forget that Voyager was supposed to be advanced. 'Nuff said, really. As for the bit on DS9- every so often (every rewatch) when I forget which series that scene belonged to and I'm watching DS9, I always look for it and miss it until I come to it in VOY. Also, 'nuff said. Casting Kes well and playing up niavete and innocence- I'd never thought of that, that could've turned her into a much more interesting character. Ugh. Star Trek and Earth-like environments. I like some of TNG's holodeck episodes, but VOY... even though they shouldn't have used it so early, this isn't even the most I've been annoyed with their Earth-like episodes. I'm actually very okay with water being a scarcity. Back when it aired, I thought ""so this is their thing."" Years later, I thought ""potable water is an actual thing for a lot of non-developed countries."" Now I think ""California."" I think Mad Max was in there somewhere. I've never liked anything they've done with B'ellana's ""Klingon blood."" Half of it puts too much of an emphasis on Klingon vs. human in a blood-genetic way, and the other half was done better with Worf or K'Ehleyr. Which disappoints me, because B'ellana could've been an excellent expansion on the ideas brought up in K'Eyler's character. The logic of Janeway's choices with the Caretaker will never not be a headache. It's an interesting headache, and I think it's worth looking at from a lot of characterization angles, in the context of how she deals with the impossible situation she's in... but that's interesting when I sit back and think about it in a whole-series way. As a start of a series, it's just an excuse to start a series.   When it was new, I watched it because it was new Star Trek. That sold me. I drifted away- and too soon- because DS9 had lost me."
DaystromInstitute,3blgin,TessaValerius,2,Wed Jul 1 18:54:08 2015 UTC,"Oh man, you're starting Voyager.  Myself, I missed the Voyager premier when it came and I'm glad I did. Instead I had caught a special preview for Voyager, talking about the new characters and new ship and having interviews with the actors. That got me way more excited than Banjoman ever would. It just -does not- work for me and feels way too hokey. I saw it long after the series had actually concluded, and was really glad I missed it.  I'm fine with the Kazon being low tech and desperate; but they never really have a chance to be competent threats. On top of this, by the time the Kazon are finally gone from the show, it's more because the writers remembered Voyager was supposed to be moving around and can't keep running into the Kazon.  The episode does have some moments. Quark is one of them, and while I hate to put praise on an element from another series during Voyager's première, Armin Shimmerman plays against other actors extremely well and it's hard not to enjoy Quark dealing with anybody. I also think the introduction of the Doctor was very well done. It's probably not a coincidence at all that what I'm drawn to are two talented actors who always get to have a lot of fun in their roles, acting in situations unique to the première.  B'ellana will get some good episodes later in the show and it's not a coincidence that those good episodes also happen to be ones where the character has emotional range outside of grumpy and feisty.  Also, be on the lookout for Kate Mulgrew looking down at the floor to find her mark before taking a dramatic step in future episodes."
DaystromInstitute,3bl69i,ThandiGhandi,19,Tue Jun 30 02:58:08 2015 UTC,"It's a satirical portrayal of cultural appropriation, in which one culture will adopt elements of another, sometimes in an aggressive way. The Klingons are implying that Shakespeare, as a writer who produced vivid poetic depictions of martial heroes, represents Klingon strength and cultural values more than he represents Humans, who in their view are weak and degenerate. They are taunting Kirk by claiming a cherished piece of his own culture, but they don't actually believe that Shakespeare was a Klingon.   Something similar occurs when Spock says ""There is an old Vulcan proverb: ""only Nixon could go to China."""" Spock is either making a bit of a joke and/or it's a commentary on the intermixing of culture in the Federation to the point that Vulcans view the pragmatism of Nixon's detente with China (as a means of capitalizing on the Sino-Soviet split) as part of their own heritage.   In the real world, cultural appropriation is often associated with imperialism and the term is thrown around in many social science circles as invective, but the majority of examples are pretty benign; from Christmas in Japan to the American infatuation with British royalty and manorialism."

DaystromInstitute,3bl69i,BestCaseSurvival,5,Tue Jun 30 17:15:32 2015 UTC,"This is also something of a running joke with Chekov, who on several occasions claims that everything was invented in Russia. In that case, it was partly a joke and partly a nod to the way in which official national histories will tend to aggrandize their own contributions to history. The less free and open a society, the more likely it is that the 'official' story is the only one available, and therefore is more widely believed.   One of the jokes here is that the Klingon empire is being directly compared to the failing Soviet state - Praxis is an obvious Chernobyl, top Federation analysts foresee the imminent collapse of a foreign non-democratic power that employs gulags, the peace talks are 'the good guys' being magnanimous and helping save the oppressed peoples of the other, but a few of the Old Guard aren't ready to forgive the decades of tensions so easily, and so on. If you name an element of Soviet society, it's not a stretch to presume it exists in the Klingon empire, with the possible exception of secret police. But travel restrictions, heavy taxation on subjugated communities, restricted information, harsh and arbitrary punishments for anyone who isn't a member of the Party (non-Klingons)... the list goes on.   While we can be pretty confident Chekov is engaging in a longstanding tradition in Russian humor dating back to... well, to the end of the Cold War itself, Chang may share a sense of humor with Chekov in this regard, or be lamenting his own society's lack of accurate historical information, or he may be mocking the Federation the only way he can get away with it at a diplomatic function.

We're not so different after all"" can win sympathetic votes from the other side. ""See? It was never yours to begin with, it was OURS"" is a violent appropriation and can demoralize the enemy. Either way, they may simply be lying."

This effectively makes them the 'Face' of the Empire.   There would have to be Klingon Artisans who are creating Klingon Opera.  Klingon Farmers/Herders who are breeding Targ & Gach.  Klingon Shipbuilders & weapon designers who build the wonderful Klingon toys.  Klingon programmers creating the computer systems to make all these things work.

In the instance of the Klingon Empire it just so happens that the wealthy families (""Houses"") are more orientated towards a combat based honour system.

Though most join the caste they are born into you get a choice where your calling lies early in life, and it is also possible to change later in life if one have a change of heart.   Now they had a system where all 3 castes where supposed to be equally represented, Klingon culture clearly lack this, the Warriors run the show.

Fun fact: in a lot of classic anthropology, it's said that Workers, Warriors, and Priests are the three basic castes for any society. You can see the structure in Plato's Republic, though the priests are replaced by philosophers (probably not as big a difference for Plato as there is for us today).

The great ""Houses"" or families maintain political control through violent, expansionist policies. This means a lot of war, either expanding the borders of the empire or internal conflicts with other great houses. This means the upper classes are going to need a lot of cannon fodder to fuel these wars. What is the best incentive to attract large swathes of young Klingons to fight for you? Social mobility.  Enact a caste system saying that the role you are born into is the role you must fulfil for your entire life for the good of the empire. But add the caveat that those that distinguish themselves through honourable combat can raise their station. ""Honourable combat"" can be defined on a case by case basis by the commanding officers, meaning you've left yourself a way out of granting every soldier a commission, but it gives hope to all the bakers and farmers sons who dream of glory and rising above their parents.  Added bonus, any planets you conquor in the name of the empire become vassal states and give tribute to the empire, either in the form of man power or resources to continue fuelling the war machine. Probably mostly resources I'm guessing as virtually all warriors we see are Klingon."

The nuance is complex in Klingon society.   It is intimated that, through the blind seeking of 'glory' that, through the Warrior Caste and profession, anyone can rise to any rank, with sufficient 'glory', a highly subjective (and otherwise empty) unit of measure to be sure. Hence the objectionability voiced by other castes in various Treks. The over glorification of violence and slaughter as a means of social advancement among the Warrior caste and the dilution of all other Klingon culture and intellect as a consequence.   Edit: Klingon Warrior culture is the ultimate allegory for the the dangers of the worship of violence and battle and the consequences to society as it represents the eventual degradation of all else that makes a strong society (science, technology, intellectual pursuit) at the hands of the base, barbaric, impulsive worship of murderous rage in the name of ego-driven concepts like 'glory' and 'honor'."

I suspect these klingons may need to suppress their more animal instincts in the same way worf does.

DaystromInstitute,3bi7od,theman1119,2,Tue Jun 30 22:24:21 2015 UTC,"We very, very rarely see Klingon medics or engineers.  When we do, not only are they generally smaller physically, but they usually also receive contempt from other Klingons.  My guess is that there is largely a two-class system, very similar to the Draenorian Orcs (who are largely identical to the Klingons in many respects) and their Peons.  Those specimens with the greatest physical proficiency would become warriors, while the rest of the population who were average or below, would do all the boring, dirty, unglamorous stuff that nobody will write songs about.  This ties in with what other people have noted about entrepreneuralism as well, and the fact that officers on a Klingon ship can advance by killing their immediate superior.  Their system is directly meritocratic and feudal; probably with a few alterations to take into account the realities of spacefaring, but feudal nonetheless.  You also wouldn't have the sort of scenario that has occurred in our history, with an MLK or a Gandhi appearing and improving peon conditions over time.  Given the degree to which it would be recognised that the peons or serfs were vital to the continued operation of the society, anyone who instigated strikes or any other form of rebellion would simply be killed.  The Klingons would have first learned that form of government from their own treatment by the Hurq.  After that, they would have copied the same two-class system for use within their own species, and then simply extended that to whatever other non-Klingon species they found.  As far as the Empire itself is concerned, from the looks of things you've got a hybrid of standard monarchy, (the chancellory) and Roman oligarchy.  (The High Council)  The system is also clannish, as it is with the Orcs.  You often hear about the machinations of one or the other of the great Houses, (clans; basically groups of families, associated by the same bloodline; although usually outstanding members of other groups or illegitimate people can get in if they show sufficient merit, which can at times make things complicated) such as the Duras sisters or Worf's own House.  Of course, you might assume that the Klingons would have a large degree of automation, to reduce the need for peon work, but I don't think they would.  Engineering just is not what they are interested in, for the most part.  Their mentality would probably be that if the peon system is working, then there would be no need to fix what isn't broken.  Experience of war with more advanced societies (like the Federation) might cause them to revise that policy a bit, but probably not much."

And I think that it would be different to have the Captain die and be replaced by somebody who hasn't even filled the shoes of First Officer yet. I think it would make her position more shaky, and give the future rebel Maquis the claim that ""at least Chakotay has captained a vessel before.""   Also I feel I should better elaborate what I meant with B'Elanna and Chakotay being the only high ranking officers. I would have a nervous Janeway refuse any officer rank to all the other Maquis, making them all have enlisted ranks. This would make them entirely subordinate to every Starfleet officer and make them feel cut out of the chain of command.  Edit: Voyager (the Intrepid one) is also not the first in her class, she's the second. So Starfleet would've had some time to work out her flaws."
DaystromInstitute,3bjndx,petrus4,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:53:50 2015 UTC,"While Memory Alpha says there was a year between Intrepid and Voyager's launches, there's both nothing to say Intrepid wasn't launched in December, and Voyager wasn't launched in January. They could easily have been constructed at the same time, and been launched with a minimal amount of time between them.  It should be noted, that the difference in registry is 56, which probably means there were 55 ships launched between them, knowing the size of the Federation, this doesn't seem like an altogether large number of ships. Additionally, to support Voyager being launched early in the year, this calculator puts Voyager's launch on January 15th 2371.  And... Because the math interested me, I did some rough estimates using another known ship with a launch/commissioning date, Defiant.  tl;dr: There should only be approximately 22 or 23 days between Intrepid's dedication and Voyager's.  On to the math: Defiant has a registry number of 74205, and it's dedication plaque has the date 47438.5, which, using the above calculator is July 16, 2370. Intrepid doesn't have a known date, but its registry number is 74600 in Nemesis, and Voyager has a registry of 74656, with a date given of 48038.5, or January 15th, 2371.  The difference in registry number between Defiant and Voyager is 451, the difference in days is 183. This means there are approximately 2.46 launches per day (451/183). The difference in registry between Intrepid and Voyager is 56. This means Intrepid was launched about 22/23 days before Voyager (56 / (451/183)), or somewhere between December 22 and 23, 2370.  I'm not sure a month is a long enough time to iron out all, or even most, of the flaws in the prototype."

DaystromInstitute,3bjndx,MrKHackworth,11,Thu Jul 2 17:01:07 2015 UTC,"If I may start: I would set it on a Sovereign Class prototype that was built to flesh out the flaws of the class.   Voyager was primarily intended to be Survival Horror to a greater or lesser degree, (think Stargate Universe) despite the fact that the writers (mostly, but not entirely; see Elite Force, the Hirogen arc, Year of Hell, and The Void) dropped that idea.  For good survival horror though, you don't give your characters a big, clean, shiny, very capable ship.  You give them a ship which clearly wasn't intended for the situation that your characters are in, so that you can write about it and the crew being pushed to their limits.  Voyager didn't stick to the initial idea, I think, for a number of reasons.  The first and probably the most important reason would have been Gene's tendency towards Utopianism while he was alive.  It's virtually impossible to do dark, gritty Star Trek, and still have people regard it as genuine Star Trek.  Although TOS was somewhat edgy at times, (particularly for the 60s) as I've said before, TNG caused audiences to expect Trek to be something that would likely make the Care Bears vomit.  The second reason was likely that VOY was intended to be the flagship show for Paramount's (ultimately failed) own cable channel, the UPN.  For Voyager to fill that role, it had to be maximally accessible; which meant nothing too highbrow, nothing too weird, and nothing that really took risks.  If I was going to do my own VOY remake, (which I'd very much like to, and have devoted a fair amount of thought to since the show was on the air) it would still have some of Gene's Utopianism, but would also be dark, gritty, multi-ethnic, non-American-centric, and periodically exceptionally violent.  Rating wise, it would be a hard R.  The point would be to use the show and the genre as a means of analysing the philosophical difference between Rand/Nietszche/Hobbes/Strauss/Plato (the grimdark/individualist aspect) on the one hand, and Kropotkin/Confucius/Mencius/Bakunin/Aristotle (the Utopian/eusocial aspect) on the other.  So at times you'd have situations where Janeway could pull the crew out of a situation with a Picard-like courtroom speech.  You'd also have Independence Day situations where a group of aliens like the Xenomorphs or Hirogen would show up, who both couldn't communicate with the crew and had no interest in doing so, and had no other motivation than simply attempting to wipe them out for the hell of it."
DaystromInstitute,3bjndx,Btro134,3,Tue Jun 30 02:40:27 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed reading your post and thought you made several fantastic points. Though I would like to better explain my class choice for Voyager. The Sovereign prototype, while being powerful, would have several flaws due it being a prototype. In my mind part of the tension would come from the crew desperately trying to fix a ship that hasn't had her flaws completely discovered. I envision the Voyager of my redo as a glass cannon, it might be able to give a punch, but it could fall apart easily."
DaystromInstitute,3bjndx,tmofee,6,Tue Jun 30 03:19:56 2015 UTC,"From an in-canon perspective I'm not sure that that could work. The Institute seems to agree that the Excelsior class was the beginning of a new age of starship construction for Starfleet. Previous to Excelsior each ship was a love letter to ship construction, each one was a custom job by yard dogs with innovations in design effecting changes in a starship's design on a section by section basis. With the Excelsior the whole ship was designed to roll off an assembly line. In TNG we get a glimpse into the design timeline for the Galaxy class. Once they got to the phase of building a whole and complete spaceframe it became the USS Galaxy, which fought in the battle Chin'toka and the Battle of Cardassia.  A fragile Sovereign prototype would never be sent on a mission like recovering lost Starfleet Intelligence operatives and a Maquis ship and crew. Take for example the Prometheus prototype we see. It was under a deep space field test. It easily managed to disable a Nebula class vessel and a D'deridex class (that one had help). The only time a Sovereign would be given a mission like that is when the vessel has actually been put through its paces and found to be spaceworthy."

Their culture, history, politics, technology, physiology, and way of life would prove to be interesting when viewed through the lens of a Starfleet officer (or even a Federation citizen).  We also don't know much about Orions, but they are undoubtedly one of the most interesting species who've traveled, fought, traded, pirated, and settled across the known galaxy for many centuries."

DaystromInstitute,3bjh29,deadieraccoon,2,Mon Jun 29 20:51:02 2015 UTC,"I know this is a week old, but there is a line from an old fantasy novel I read years ago that has always stuck with me and I only just read this thread; basically, the main character is half-elf, and he speaks with a human about what that means. The human asks him why he doesn't refer to himself as ""half-human"" or ""half-man"" but is OK with referring to himself as ""half-elf"". The character basically responds that other humans see the ""half-man"" thing as a diminishment of the whole while (most) other races see ""half-elf"" as part of a sum that is greater than its parts.   I'd love to see a series where the captain is half-vulcan, half-klingon, or half-I-dont-care-what and have them explore that same idea. Even in a utopia like the UFoP there has to be tension growing up with a background that is different than everyone else you know. Who are you? Where do you truly belong? Who are your people? All questions that really should be archaic by the time of Starfleet, but have real resonance with modern viewers today (in my opinion as a person of mixed heritage)!

DaystromInstitute,3bjh29,Rampant_Durandal,11,Mon Jun 29 23:39:44 2015 UTC,"Okay then!  Love it or hate it, the Abrams reboot fractured the fan community.  One of the marketing slogans of the 2009 film was ""this ain't your father's Star Trek,"" and Simon Pegg's statements about making the next film less Star Trekky have sparked an outcry.  As many new fans that the reboot films bring into the fold, Star Trek simply needs its established fanbase to survive in television and film.  If a new show is to be a success, it must convey that the idea that it's respecting the 50 year legacy that came before.  One way of doing that would be to include a classic, fan-favorite species:  the Andorians.  Building on this, you have the four-gendered aspect of the Andorians as established in the novels.  To be honest, I never felt like the Andorians were the best species to explore the spectrum of sexuality in this manner.  Something about them always felt very conservative to me; but this would actually play out in favor when including a ""gay"" character in a series, which like it or not would still be a controversial move among some fans.  And I  staunchly hold to the belief that ""pissing off the Fundies"" as some people like to do is a mistake; that good science fiction, especially Star Trek, is best when it tackles social issues in a subtle and tactful manner.  So, if the ""gay"" character is an alien, you can drive home the idea that his sexuality is a part of his biology, making it easier for more conservative viewers to accept the message.  Furthermore, if he is a more politically conservative character in his beliefs and actions, not only would this make him even more appealing to conservative audiences, it would better reflect the nuanced complexity of life in general.  Just yesterday my father-in-law was wondering whether or not his married lesbian neighbors would remove the Confederate flag from the back of their pickup truck.  I'd also like to see a group of cyborg characters as part of the crew, either a pair of Bynars or a group of four Borg drones.  What the Borg represented in the 90's when they were introduced is the fear of technology encroaching upon our daily lives, a fact bemoaned by the standup comedians of the time regarding answering machines and flashing VCR clocks.  Now that we can't live without our iPhones and FitBits, it's worth exploring a people with a healthier relationship with technology.  A kinder, gentler Borg would continue the Trek theme of turning enemies into allies.  If the Borg stopped assimilating species, and instead allowed people to come to them to ascend the way Decker joined with V'Ger, we might see a Borg fit for the 25th Century.  People claim Voyager neutered the Borg, but the fact is every villain becomes less intimidating the more times your protagonist must defeat them; that's the Law of Inverse Ninja Strength.  I'd want to see them looking more like Science Officer 0718 than space zombies, but I think it could work."
DaystromInstitute,3bjh29,KalEl1232,6,Tue Jun 30 03:04:02 2015 UTC,"Oh your comment about the Andorians being very conservative, and thus the four sexes seeming odd to associate with them them - I think that's actually something brilliant to do. Because it seems to me like that's what makes them conservative.   The novel-canon that establishes their reproduction also establishes that they suffer a severe population crisis. Andorian procreation is probably difficult in general, and the 24th-century ones are having problems with non-viable offspring even when quads have been tested for genetic compatibility before marrying. Now, combine these biological facts with the belief that marriage is for procreative purposes is commonly-held among conservatives.   I can easily see a societal focus on the concept of family, however that winds up being defined. Is it a nuclear style where it's a quad and their children, their ties to their other family members muted and less important once the marriage happens? Or is family much broader then that, comprised of the core unit and children, but with ties back to all 4 sets of in-laws? Maybe this is where the broad extended clan structure comes from. But this could easily become a society of conservative-like opinions when it comes to family obligations, to marriage and its purpose. In the West, we look at romantic marriage as an ideal, and a contractual marriage (for the purpose of children, or land, or rights) as something to see as backwards or disgusting. But the Andorians would possibly find our ways as repulsive - we're thinking of our selfish pleasure, not of the broader good.  What kind of interesting stories can this give us?   What about 'conventional' Andorians who believe in picking the best marriage for viable children? Who might hope they can get along with their spouses on a personal level, but who will make it work even if they hate their partners for the sake of continuing their line / the species. There would be Andorians who see the idea of marriage as other species do, where it's for close companionship and love and romance, where children may not be the main focus or may even be entirely optional - and who really want that for themselves, despite what society says. After all, imagine an Andorian who grew up loving someone only to find out they weren't likely to produce viable offspring with each other - how do they balance their feelings with their duty? What counts as 'cheating' in this society? Is outside interests and what would look like homosexuality permitted so long as viable offspring are produced inside of a legal marriage?  tl;dr: conservative 4-sexed Andorians would have so many stories to tell and I would want to watch (and write about) it all."

DaystromInstitute,3bjh29,domodojomojo,6,Mon Jun 29 19:03:25 2015 UTC,"For each major franchise, there have been notable species in each. What I would love to see is a mixture of them. What I mean is that I would love to see the Andorians and the Ferengi have some kind of trade conflict, the Romulans and the Cardassians again working on spying, the Klingons battling a rogue Borg outpost... I would like to see the Federation at times being an observer or a participant in something, but I would like to see them as not the main actors, but as ride alongs or something like that. Not always, but I think there is a lot of social commentary that can be made for the Federation to be more of an arbitrator-like element in Star Trek.  I'm not sure there is much that can be done with a lot of species from Voyager, but it would be interesting to see more of the Alpha Quadrant species doing things, and returning minor species, so they don't look like one-time deals for the franchise. The kinds of episodes that come into my mind is DS9 ""Blood Oath"" and VOY ""False Profits,"" or VOY ""Blood Fever."" These kinds of episodes brought something into Star Trek that united the franchise beyond just cameos from the crew of NCC-1701."

There is plenty of content for them from non-canon but almost nothing on-screen despite the fact that the first on screen appearance of the Federation President was one. Even if it doesn't follow the books it would offer a mostly blank slate for a Federation species. One of the strengths of the franchise is its ability to explore aspects of the human condition through the foil of an alien species. I think there is some good opportunities here.

Along those lines, I would like to see a genetically engineered or cyberneticly enhanced race (the Binars don't count), or one that has accepted those ideas. It'd be interesting to see how humans would react to that considering there's a thing for ""human purity"" in Trek (augments are feared due to Kahn, and we haven't seen a cybernetic enhancement that didn't have downsides or only brought the person up to status quo, see Geordi's VISOR and Nog's leg for examples).

DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,lergerhs,86,Mon Jun 29 01:27:13 2015 UTC,"It's funny, coming out of Dorn's AMA left me comparing Doctor Who and Star Trek in terms of fan-made continuations.  You see, with Doctor Who there's a tremendous amount of intermixing between the fans and the current staff. Toby Whithouse, Steven Moffat, Russel T. Davies, and many, many more started off as colossal Whovians swapping thoughts on the show in early BBSs.   Their fanfiction became Who. Moffat gets lines from a Doctor Who parody into the Doctor's mouth. The fan-theories he had about the Doctor's name being a terrible secret—he got to canonize them.   A few years after Doctor Who was cancelled, but long before the show was revived, Big Finish kept the torch lit with a series of audio plays. Shortly after, they actually finagled cast reunions and created runs even better than television. The Sixth and Seventh Doctors (seen as utter failures and arguable duds during their televised runs, respectively) get absolutely phenomenal runs for seasons and seasons and seasons in audios.  Meanwhile, there hasn't been a single fan production that's reached actual parity with the show itself. No matter how many D-List fan favorites (like Grant Imahara) or actual castmembers (such as all those returning in Star Trek: Renegades), nothing moves beyond ""Oh, that's nice"".  And this has created a bad precedent. Pitches like these are made all the time, and they're always groan-worthy. Everything seems like an awkward attempt to prolong the franchise's glory days—compared to Big Finish's Classic Who material, which feels like the glory days done properly.  To illustrate: Big Finish's promise of a River Song series excites me, even though I had very little love for the character onscreen. Dorn's ""Captain Worf"" proposal just feels depressing even though I love Worf.  The difference? One seems like an opportunity to do-over the character properly. Maybe it's Big Finish's great track-record, maybe it's the freedom to focus on story over production demands that the new medium affords, maybe it's because there's less of a gap between the character's last scene and now. But one feels like its got a bright future and the other feels like it's doomed to fail, even if it does manage to get off the ground.  You know what Star Trek deserves for its next step? Something new. Something that does to Trek what TNG did to TOS. Something that's willing to learn from the decades of progress in television and move forward."

It's boring and not a good way to bring in new viewers without knowing 20 years of lore. I think a minor character, like Nog in some command position, or Molly O'Brien as an enthusiastic weapons officer would be great. Mere children before, still with a chance to become something new. Molly O'Brien seems like the perfect choice. The right age, a character not yet written but already established. Just enough to be a nice homage to pre-existing fans, but new viewers aren't missing much. I'm all for O'Brien, in his old age, suffering some more. I love the idea of his daughter charging right into battle, firing phasers, and giving her father some gray hairs.  But for core positions like Captain, we'll need someone new. I think it's time for a non-human captain, it speaks to the issue of discrimination as species further integrate, and I also expect a more diverse crew. Voyager showed me that such a majorly human cast is awful and bland. Humans, especially in the Roddenberry universe, are remarkably bland. They're meant to be perfect in every way. Other species are more interesting, and their interaction with humans brings out the depth. A bit of ""racism"" from some older crew members would be interesting to see. It was brought up once or twice on TNG when Data assumed command, but nothing ever came from it."

Is there any more fleshed out character in Star Trek? Dorn has been in more episodes than anyone else. We've seen his parents, his marriages, his son and fully explored his life in the Federation and in the Klingon Empire. The only thing we haven't fleshed out is his childhood.   What stories are there left to tell about Worf? If he isn't a fully explored character then no character is.  I'd love new episodes, but I can't disagree more with Dorn in that there is more to tell. If there is anywhere to go it's somewhere in the 25th century, completely new worlds and stories. Keeping the past as a crutch won't get the show anywhere. It has to be completely new."

Dr. Who is a much looser construction that has always been tongue in cheek and never took itself too seriously. It has a kitchen sink mentality (afforded by time travel) in which almost anything can be thrown into it storywise, and still fit quite well. So I think it lends itself much better to fan fiction, even fan fiction that is unrestrained and a bit corny. Star Trek is more grounded in serious drama, introspection and a realistic universe based on science. It also needs a reimagining in some areas to correct the problems that accumulated in the Berman era and bring the franchise up to date. Most fan fiction is not up to that task."

So yes, this does look like some sort of vanity project right now, because all that he is selling at the moment is his character.

It sticks to one place leading to deeper storytelling like DS9 had, it has some exploration and new faces coming through like any Enterprise mission, and there will be threats, although rather than purely dark and gritty like DS9 and was popular at the time for late 90's-early 2000's sci fi, it is moving towards a bright and hopeful future. It would explore the hard choices and difficult work that go into getting there. Potential for a cast large enough to fill not just the ship, but also some secondary characters in the colony, and characters switching between the two places. The chance for multiple perspectives on each event is pretty cool. Establishing order on the frontier of known space, making the middle of nowhere your home, that sounds very Star Trek to me, and that's what I want for the next Star Trek series."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,IkLms,2,Mon Jun 29 03:05:35 2015 UTC,"In the new JJ reboot, there is a new Vulcan survivor colony being established. Would that be a good setting? The Federation and a few others are helping these refugees set up a new civilization. Maybe the colony could be in a location that is disputed by some other races?"
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,phraps,2,Mon Jun 29 03:30:08 2015 UTC,"Uh oh,  I feel Star Trek: New Earth coming on. I like this idea, something on the borders. Maybe the frontier suggestion above is spot on."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,phraps,2,Tue Jun 30 15:06:14 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you pretty much just described DS9."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,coinlock,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:38:22 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It's basically the best Star Trek has put out. We need to continue off of that in any new series, and it can't pull in old characters just to go ""look a cameo!"""
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,zer05tar,34,Mon Jun 29 07:17:35 2015 UTC,"Also, I thought Worf is now Federation Ambassador to Kronos? Not Captain?  And I think that making a new show based on a character we already know, love, and fleshed out isn't a good idea. We need a fresh series with new characters and a new cast, not fan service.   A new series would also have to get out of the ""dark and gritty"" rut that Star Trek has been in for decades. I think a series that's a little more lighthearted is the way to go."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,WranglerOfSkittles,30,Mon Jun 29 16:44:02 2015 UTC,"There is a danger of breaking canon. As someone else said, it takes place between DS9 and Nemesis. But a new show needs to take place NEXT in the timeline. Filling in that blank gives a very limited timezone. The series can't last past a certain time. The beauty of Star Trek is its internal consistency despite massive details, which has far surpassed most franchises in the world. To avoid breaking that, this series has to go from a style established in the 90's to a style established in 2002. It's impossible to make something that appeals to this decade with that. I appreciate each era of Star Trek, but you can't make something modern and fresh when your limit on  technological progress is 2002 sci-fi, where the vision of the future is still dark and gritty, Matrix-esque. This comparison of the look of Fallout 3 vs the newly announced Fallout 4 is quite telling. Cool black and gray uniforms are outdated. We're culturally taking a turn towards bright colors and a more hopeful outlook of the future. Like all good sci-fi, Star Trek should reflect that. We need a 2015 future, not a 2000 future. You can even look at the new Star Trek movies to see that, although it's been a few years since the first and pure white, clean everything is giving way to even more color. Nemesis/DS9 era is the wrong way to go. At this point, something closer to the ORIGINAL SERIES looks better. I watched it recently, and when the plain, flat yellow font pops up on the shot of space, STAR TREK, it looks really good.  I think there should be some more important, overarching storylines rather than monster of the week. That doesn't mean it needs to be all serious and dark. DS9 was about a full-on war, and trying not to have the whole Federation crumble. With a new Star Trek series, I think a great story would be establishing a Federation colony. Each ""alien of the week"" could be seeking refuge in this colony, or someone trying to scam the colonists, or help build it. It would be a chance to get the first really good spaceship show in a long time, but a show about a small, wild west-ish town built up on the frontier of Federation space would be pretty cool. And it could even turn into a bustling city over time. Colonization is often talked about in Star Trek series, and a few times the Enterprise even visits them for some weekly plot to occur. That's an unexplored aspect of the Star Trek universe to explore, I think. It's hopeful, about progress, and allows the exploration of new creatures and people coming through of the Enterprise mission series(es?), with the detailed, established area of Deep Space 9 that led to deeper storytelling."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,phraps,12,Mon Jun 29 01:39:49 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what should happen. We need to focus on a new frontier, not regurgitate what's already been done."

DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,WranglerOfSkittles,2,Tue Jun 30 20:32:48 2015 UTC,A Worf field commission would work for a while until he proves himself as a real captain. /shrug
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,iansarmy1,1 point,Sat Jul 4 05:51:47 2015 UTC,"He's ambassador in the ST:O timeline, but not in canon anywhere else. TWC could happily overwrite all of that, which given the direction ST:O's gone in, might be a good thing.  Edit: I stand corrected."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,jscoppe,23,Mon Jun 29 01:52:11 2015 UTC,"In ""What You Leave Behind"" Martok and Admiral Ross make Worf Ambassador."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,trekman3,8,Mon Jun 29 02:01:51 2015 UTC,And then in Nemesis Worf is back on the Enterprise as an active crew member.
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,iansarmy1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:08:53 2015 UTC,I don't think he was apart of the Enterprise crew though.  Did the movie even give an explanation of why he was there?  He should have been a full Commander and I don't think he was either.
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,gerryblog,2,Mon Jun 29 03:56:08 2015 UTC,"That's easy to change in a new series. Heck, new series could be 5 years post-DS9, Worf's back in Starfleet, etc."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,inconspicuous_male,16,Tue Jun 30 01:13:23 2015 UTC,"It's the sort of vanity project with a flimsy fan service premise that would make a decent Kickstarter pitch for a fan series, but doesn't belong in a professional production. Worf had 7 Seasons of TNG, 4 Seasons of DS9 and 4 feature films worth of screen time and development, he's had his day and then some, there is nothing more to be done with or learned about his character. The Klingons of the Berman era are similarly played out to the point that they became a parody of themselves.   Berman era Trek is dead, it's not coming back, and a 62 year old actor well past the prime of his career is not going to convince CBS to revive it with a niche show and go on like the implosion of the franchise in the early 2000's never happened. Star Trek will come back to television eventually, but it will be with an entirely new creative staff and actors, and it won't have any direct connection to previous canon. Micheal Dorn is a good actor and I'm sure a good person but I wish he would stop with this nonsense. He knows it will never be made, and at this point I think he's just trying to generate buzz for himself."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,Man_with_the_Fedora,6,Mon Jun 29 03:31:19 2015 UTC,"Berman era Trek is dead, it's not coming back   Thank you. Why not have a thought provoking series with all new people in the JJ-verse?"
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,ademnus,2,Mon Jun 29 03:16:06 2015 UTC,"there is nothing more to be done with or learned about his character   Really? I feel like there is more to be done with and learned about all of Star Trek's main characters.  I'll put it this way: if the show actually did get made, would you watch it? At least the pilot?  I can't imagine that, as a Star Trek fan, you wouldn't at least check it out to see if maybe, just maybe, there's something there.  And if that is the case, I think it proves that there is at least the potential of doing something interesting with these characters.  Of course, there is no guarantee that, if the show did get made, it would actually be any good. I'm just saying that it could be."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,Dangerus9,7,Mon Jun 29 14:13:24 2015 UTC,"The problem with Dorn's premise it that the focus would be on Worf dealing with bridging Federation and Klingon culture, which a huge of amount of screen time in two series has already been lavished on. It would be a retread of a character arc that was already rehashed in DS9 when they made Worf an outcast again and then redeemed him... again. Would I watch it? Yes, of course I would, it would certainly be better than no new Trek at all, but it would be a disaster for the franchise. New fans wouldn't have a clue what was a going on and many old fans would be bored with it. In any case this is all academic, CBS will never go for a straight up revival of Berman era Trek. It's like Richard Hatch trying to revive the original BSG in the 1990's."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,jscoppe,37,Mon Jun 29 03:55:42 2015 UTC,"CAPTAIN WORF is basically the nightmare scenario for Trek's return to TV, I think. I can't imagine anything that would produce worse stories that were less relatable to potential new fans."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,Kamala_Metamorph,20,Mon Jun 29 04:11:39 2015 UTC,"It requires fans to have watched all of TNG and DS9 to understand what's going on. Those are great shows, but it seriously limits the influx of new viewers. And by that point, I think they've had their fill of Worf."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,Kamala_Metamorph,15,Mon Jun 29 02:59:25 2015 UTC,"Plus, he has more screen time than anyone. How many life altering character developing moments can one guy have?"
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,Jewel_sh,6,Mon Jun 29 03:18:05 2015 UTC,"I love Worf as a character, but the main reason I love Worf is his biggest weakness. He's a Klingon ultra-paladin, which worked great in for a side character in TNG. However I don't see a show revolving around a Klingon puritan getting very good ratings in this era of gritty, complex, protaganists who are, more often than not, antiheroes."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,The_Gleam,24,Mon Jun 29 05:10:24 2015 UTC,"I feel it would be an absolute mistake. I love Worf, and TNG, but I don't feel he was the strongest part of it, or DS9, and I don't think we need to revisit the old shows.  I think it's time for something brand new."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,JonPaula,8,Mon Jun 29 06:25:56 2015 UTC,Couldnt agree more; any of the Klingon heavy episodes are just tedious.
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,david-saint-hubbins,5,Mon Jun 29 02:51:35 2015 UTC,"It's because they're not really the Russians anymore. They had to change Klingons in the newer series, and it's hurt their role as adversaries."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,Azselendor,11,Mon Jun 29 04:46:00 2015 UTC,"Wow, we are not pro-Captain Worf in here, are we? You can add me as a sad +1 to that number :-/   First, I assume that you guys have at least opened the videos about the new series~   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsXsMCmlCwk&feature=youtu.be&list=PL2RINV0RduRxiMXSju2Z-8uQPCemfCnbY  I watched a couple of minutes and it didn't capture my interest. I think we all like the idea of Captain Worf, we all want to know what happens to the fictional character. However, we're skeptical if this team is capable of making a series that does worthy, the Captain Worf of our dreams.   Patrick Stewart actually spoke at my commencement, as he was a professor here before he became famous. When I listened to his speech, which was thoughtful but not entertaining (and yeah I was younger and less thoughtful myself), I realized something. I love Captain Picard. I love who the writers of TNG created. I didn't love Patrick Stewart (circa. *cough* number of years ago.)  Which is a long way of saying, I don't want to know Worf's story unless it's coming from the brains of the DS9 writers.   Ending on an upnote, I'm glad I rearranged my schedule to be ready to go at the start of an AMA, and to have good questions ready, no boring ""favorite episode"" / ""favorite line"" questions, which I already knew the answer to anyway, frequenting MA and convention panel videos as often as I do. I got my first choice questions answered and it was pretty awesome. Hopefully other Trekkers agree with me!  I learned something today, which I'd say is pretty rare for a huge TNG geek as myself. This is probably the answer I found most satisfying."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,Azselendor,5,Mon Jun 29 14:08:26 2015 UTC,"I just don't think there's much more of Worf's story to tell unless going into frequent childhood flashbacks. And I don't think we should have those. Star Trek is all about looking to the future. I do think Worf could function as an inspirational figure, but not as a Captain himself. What if his son Alexander was on the crew, and his father Worf was off being an ambassador to Kronos? That would provide the insight into the Klingon story while using a new, interesting character for it. I know he showed up as a young man, a soldier, in DS9, and I forget what happened to him, but we're missing a very large portion of his life there to explore.  I so badly want Star Trek to return, and I would like further insight into the internal affairs of other species, but Worf's played out. I don't see him as the main character for yet another series."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,jerslan,7,Mon Jun 29 03:45:42 2015 UTC,"I just don't think there's much more of Worf's story to tell unless going into frequent childhood flashbacks.   Okay, I really disagree with you here.   Now, I don't believe that Hollywood is currently interested (or capable) of giving us a story about Worf that is worth watching. So there I totally agree with you. But to say that there isn't anything more of Worf's story to tell? That is a horrible bias that Hollywood has taught you. That only young people's stories are worth telling, mostly 20-45 year old men.   I absolutely believe that 60 year old Worf can have stories worth telling, and worth telling for years. The fact that we don't think that 60 year olds have good stories to tell is a limitation of the system. We haven't seen many stories that explore this and, many of us not having reached pensioner age, can't imagine this without having heard those stories. Many of the 60 year olds that you see getting portrayed are having ""young people adventures."" I think that's a crock of bull, that they can only be interesting if they're doing young people shit.   It's a limitation because most people are taught to ""write what they know"", and writers' rooms are often staffed with young, hungry, cheaper writers. Lots of 60 year olds now are out there kicking ass and taking names. We could be having more stories about them. The Golden Girls was a beloved, interesting show about four older women. Why hasn't there been more stories like the Golden Girls, when there are 50 bajillion stories about sitcom families? Because Golden Girls is all there is to say about pensioners? And we need yet another iteration of a sitcom family? No. We get more sitcom families because there is more stuff like that in the pipeline. Not because we need more of the same. But because producers aren't developing differently.   So I think Worf is certainly out there having TV-worthy storylines in the Trek fictional universe somewhere. I just don't think that Hollywood today knows how to give them to us.   That's two different things."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,Ovarian_Cavity,2,Mon Jun 29 03:55:33 2015 UTC,"Absolutely true. A rare (but relevant) example of an interesting portrayal of a 60 year old character would be Commander Adama in Battlestar Galactica - a tenacious, conflicted war hero, dealing with the scars of his personal life whilst commanding a ship in a desperate situation. Captain Worf could be played in this way, instead of rehashing old territory."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,jerslan,2,Mon Jun 29 04:09:07 2015 UTC,"I can't say I like the sound of captain Worf at all.   Look at the advancement in soap opera over the past decade alone. We need something with the budget of shows such as Doctor who or Game of Thrones. The plot should take place a century after TNG to help explain how new technologies have advanced and developed while our heroes from past series could still be brought up occasionally as lore.  People who are completely new to the Star Trek scene should be able to relate to characters almost immediately, and no Star Trek fan is going to want to hear Worf's or anyone elses back story yet again. We need new and fresh material that is not only thought provoking but also entertaining for new and old fans alike. Hell, remember when Kirk kissed Uhara? It was the first televised interracial kiss on TV! How about the Inner Light? I don't know many other times a TV show made me cry and think about how much we rely on personal relationships to live a fulfilling life.   I don't want to see Worf's struggles with fitting in... We have already seen it. The show has always been about exploring the human condition and it should absolutely follow that path. We have enough shows that are entertaining for entertainment's sake and Star Trek deserves more than that."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,Ovarian_Cavity,11,Mon Jun 29 19:03:52 2015 UTC,"Sadly, no. Sounds like an awful idea... just one step above fan-made, Kickstarter-funded project.  We already got 11 seasons worth of Worf, and he was never the most interesting character in any of them. It's time to start fresh, with a WHOLE new cats - sometime in the 25th century within the prime universe. Maybe it's set on Earth, and we follow Cadets... eventually getting their first post. Maybe it's a deep-space mission in Beta Quadrant, or a science vessel that doesn't always engage in combat.  Really... ANYTHING else would be more interesting to me."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,dasbush,9,Mon Jun 29 21:11:26 2015 UTC,"Worf was in 7 seasons of TNG, 4 seasons of DS9, and 4 TNG movies, for a grand total of 273 appearances.  #2 is Miles O'Brien at 211, followed by Picard at 182.  Point is, he's in first place by a mile.  Now, obviously, he wasn't exactly a lead character for a lot of those episodes, but in the later seasons of TNG, and certainly on DS9, he was a fan favorite who got plenty of character development.    What exactly are we hoping to accomplish by going back to the same well?  Don't get me wrong; I love Worf.  But enough already.  Let's get some new stories with new characters."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,gerryblog,6,Mon Jun 29 03:20:48 2015 UTC,"And O'Brien was also on the two series, but he wasn't really that important on TNG. Worf is by far the most watched and most developed character in the Star Trek universe. He doesn't need another series of it. I love his character, but you can't really make a full show about his character development at this point without going into an unnecessary level of detail."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,dontthrowmeinabox,10,Mon Jun 29 03:14:04 2015 UTC,"Who knows, I'd love trek back on TV--  but my gut impression is that everyone is heading to Mars or Andromeda these days in science fiction.  I think part of star trek fatigue people isn't so much as the weight of canon and 50 years of history--  but the fact star trek spends so little time on the final frontier.   If star trek is a space western, then we need to cross the Mississippi River sooner or later."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,lawnpuppies,9,Mon Jun 29 03:22:41 2015 UTC,"I agree, and I absolutely love that metaphor. It's all about going where no man has gone before, but I don't think we need another show about the Enterprise flying around, meeting Klingons and Romulans. Someone elsewhere in the comments section criticized me for this, saying that's what Star Trek is, and if I don't like that I shouldn't want it back on TV. But that's not true. I love its ability to create a fantastically detailed, internally consistent series with rich history and amazing technology, yet always coming back to the human condition among space explorers.  I would like to see completely different premises, much like how DS9 revolutionized the franchise a bit, and Voyager provided a sense of urgency and realism to happy space exploration. I propose colonization, a popular federation activity we never got to look into much. But earlier today I saw someone link to an article about a proposed fan series called Star Trek: Uncharted, in which a mysterious signal from a different galaxy prompts a Federation crew to seek it out, the idea being this advanced species has transcended warp technology even further. The whole thing is actually a reasonable push beyond what we know, increasing the scale of Star Trek while keeping to the same themes and ideals. He crossed the theoretical space Mississippi.  For the sake of this comment, I tracked down some information on it. I found the project's website, and it seems brilliant. This guy has worked on it for years, and unlike TNG:CW this guy actually has his episodes, cast, everything AVAILABLE. I scrolled down the main page for some basic information, and I love how he mentions the basic values and principles of a Star Trek show, and that's what he wanted to make. A bit further is a row of pictures, which seem to be the characters in his cast. I do not yet know their names or anything about them, but they're varied, the effects budget to make them would be reasonable, and the human:alien ratio is spot on. I just found he has the scripts down, complete with audio queues in certain scenes, available on the site. Clearly this guy cares about a well-developed idea. I'm going to read through his series, and although I am just about to start now, I think this is going to be very, very good."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,EpicPartyGuy,2,Mon Jun 29 10:48:21 2015 UTC,"It's funny that you bring up star trek uncharted because a few days after the mass effect announce trailer came out, I saw an article that the team behind that was invited to pitch the series."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,BigTaker,7,Mon Jun 29 11:15:39 2015 UTC,"I think they need to do another time jump... Maybe 30-40 years after Voyager got home? Should put it in the 2420s or so... Set it post-Hobus to make it clear this is the ""Prime"" timeline and maybe give some in-universe explanation/setup for whatever the current galactic politics look like.   Maybe the Klingons and Federation went to war over the remaining Romulan Territory? Maybe there are still some RSE remnants biding their time to fight for their freedom?  I dunno, but a new ship and a new crew would be nice. Maybe bring Data in or an aged Worf for guest spots. The occasional stop at DS9 (which may or may not have been upgraded/replaced by this point)."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,Evis-Cerate,3,Mon Jun 29 11:59:50 2015 UTC,"I am a weird fan. I like the reboot movies fine enough, but if we do a new show I wish they'd ignore the Hobus thing and go for more what the novels have set-up with the Typhon Pact. I find them more interesting as a foil than what we've had so far.   In fact, you wouldn't need to fully ignore the reboots, you could have an episode or episodes where we travel into that universe (much like we have the Mirror Universe).   I'm just not one to jump on the ""gritty"" Star Trek bandwagon. Not everything needs to be dark and depressing. DS9 is as gritty as I like Trek, and I hope the next series doesn't try to go ultra-dark to try and make itself stand out. Great characters, stories, and story arcs would do that much better."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,adamkotsko,2,Mon Jun 29 06:34:51 2015 UTC,"I wasn't suggesting dark and gritty by any means...  We all saw what happened when Stargate tried that... Universe had a LOT of potential, but it got too caught up in ""Who's sleeping with who"" drama...  As much as I might like for Hobus to be ignored, I think it can be worked around. Spock doesn't really know what any of the aftermath was. Jump to 20 or 30 years after that? Chances are everyone will know what had happened, and it can largely be hand-waved as ""Remans did it using some ancient Iconian weapons they found"" (a variation of STO's explanation, but I wouldn't try to do their Iconian War plot-line)."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,bakhesh,2,Mon Jun 29 13:36:53 2015 UTC,"I know you weren't suggesting dark and gritty, but I'd seen it thrown around in previous messages and just had to also throw that in there.   I just hope the main message of Star Trek, that things can and will get better once we realize we can work together toward common goals, doesn't get lost in the shuffle. DS9 did get dark, but it never really lost the idealism. There were episodes where it questioned what it took to keep the utopia alive, and whether the price was worth it or not, and I think those were very compelling episodes.  (Again, this next point you never mentioned, but I'll keep my responses contained here). People sometimes talk about wanting to see the Federation fall and the aftermath of that, of picking the pieces up, to change the status quo. I just don't think upending everything is necessary to keep Trek on TV or relevant. We're at a time where the ideas behind Trek are needed as much as they were in the 60s. We're all one species, let's work together and work to gain knowledge, not power."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,MexicanSpaceProgram,9,Mon Jun 29 15:40:12 2015 UTC,"If you watch the videos linked in the AMA, he says that it will take place in the Klingon Empire which is struggling with itself in the face of inexorable progress.  Also he says that it will take place between DS9 and Nemesis.  The videos certainly help flesh out the idea.  But it's still a little murky, obviously."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,sigurbjorn1,10,Mon Jun 29 16:57:04 2015 UTC,I hadn't even seen the wrinkle that this was supposed to take place BEFORE Nemesis. That's the bad idea icing on the bad idea cake.
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,artadmin,4,Mon Jun 29 01:34:47 2015 UTC,"I could see Captain Worf as part of a larger universe of simultaneous series.  Like, as one of three to five series running at the same time (perhaps in the vein of how Daredevil is going to become part of a 4-series Netflix project in the Marvel universe, culminating in a joint Defenders series).    Alone?  That seems a little sad.  I'm sure a Captain Worf series could do some interesting things, and I'd watch every episode, but I'm not a fan of it being the only representation of Trek on TV at a given time."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,wayoverpaid,5,Mon Jun 29 03:03:48 2015 UTC,"Personally I thought his AMA came off as a ploy to sell cupcakes and left a bad taste in my mouth. I don't think the idea has a chance at all and would be utter failure regardless. Old trek lives in the past, when trek is suppose to be about looking into the future. Any future trek needs to bring something new to the table like TNG did to TOS."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,stinkpotfiend,6,Mon Jun 29 03:22:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think more Worf us the way to go. While I absolutely love the character and would be distraught if he never showed up, Worf and Klingons have been done to death.  My vote would be an American Horror Story styled focusing of a different ship in each season, addressing the progression of the Federation a half-generation post-DS9."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,Numlocks,4,Mon Jun 29 03:29:46 2015 UTC,It would certainly be refreshing if the next Trek series revolved around something other than Starfleet.
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,StarTrekMike,6,Mon Jun 29 03:53:40 2015 UTC,"I like star trek, I love Worf as we have seen him so far and I dream of a new show on TV so I feel awful in saying I do not want this as its currently described but that's how I feel... to me this can only hurt future trek show's chance's by having taken it in entirely the wrong direction.  A show that anchor's on a single character like that just isnt cutting it for me. Take us forward in time, take us back in time but do not have it all deppend on one guy specificaly if he's the guy calling the shots."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,BuddhasLittleWarlock,4,Mon Jun 29 11:20:08 2015 UTC,"After a ten-year hiatus, I don't think a Worf-centered show is the fresh start Star Trek needs. Centering the show on Worf would necessarily mean presupposing the background of hundreds of episodes that mostly aired 20 or more years ago! There was a similar time gap between TOS and TNG, and for the most part, TNG felt like a free-standing show.   Throwing Worf onto DS9 made sense as an attempt to increase interest in the spin-offs, but the strategy didn't materially help ratings then, and it's not clear to me how it would attract any but the most hardcore fans now. For my part, I was already tired of Worf by season 5 of TNG, much less the uninspiring plots of the DS9 era (though his murder of Gowron almost made up for it all...)."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,WranglerOfSkittles,5,Mon Jun 29 12:50:51 2015 UTC,"Might sound strange, but personally I would prefer ""Star Trek : The Wesley Chronicles"".  The character was so badly written on TNG there is plenty of potential left. His experiences with the Traveller make him a prime candidate for deep space exploration. And you get lots of callbacks to TNG  Plus, Wheaton"
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,WranglerOfSkittles,6,Mon Jun 29 13:10:07 2015 UTC,"Let's face it - Dorn will take any Trek-related project, because he always has - a check of his IMDB page shows that he's done very little since - half a dozen episodes of Castle, some voice-acting, a few kid's series, and a few other bits and bobs.  While I'm all in favour of exploring a character's back story or potential future, I think Worf has been done to death, between DS9, TNG and the stupid movies that reduced him to comic relief.  Time to move on..."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,Richard_the_Saltine,5,Mon Jun 29 13:16:41 2015 UTC,"It isnt really about what the fans want, michael dorn needs a job and worf was his most popupar role. Captain woupd make him a lead role, it would be good for his career. Dint forget, this is his career and he has a responsibility to himself, it isnt all about us. You guys call it vanity project. . .i say it is normal to try and further your career, and as an actor, by trying for the lead."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,shinenotburn,4,Mon Jun 29 15:56:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I know that many fans love Worf, and love Klingons, but the episodes that focus heavily on them are the ones I am prone to skipping when I go back to rewatch. I think that he got to be a better actor as the shows continue, but I am just not that interested in learning more about the Klingons in general or Worf specifically. Plus, he’s already had character development over multiple shows.   I’m a big fan of the franchise, but his description in the AMA is literally the only version I can think of that I would consider not watching.   For the tone of the next Start Trek show, I would hope that it would look to shows like TNG and West Wing. Overall, I love the optimism of these shows. There could still be room for elements of “darker/grittier” within episodes.  This would be such a refreshing change amidst the current heavyweight shows - Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, and House of Cards."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,flameofmiztli,3,Mon Jun 29 22:43:17 2015 UTC,"In terms of TV, Star Trek has been off the air for a decade now.  Deep space nine ended before the turn of the millennium.  Imagine trying to get someone who had never, ever seen Star Trek into this show.   ""So this is a Star Trek show?  With that movie with like, Kirk and Spock?""  ""Oh no, this based on the TV show with Captain Picard.  But they got the guy who gets bitch slapped by the alien of the week to come back as Captain.   My problem with the TNG-Voyager timeline is that the galaxy continues to feel smaller and smaller.  In TOS the galaxy felt enormous, space was huge, cold, and lonely.  In TNG the galaxy was a bit smaller, and the Enterprise spent a lot of time on local politics.  By the time we got to DS9 we were talking about a turf war between two sides of the galaxy.  Voyager picked ""the one part of the galaxy we haven't done anything with so far"" and that was that.  Now that's not to say that there's something wrong with that.  Game of Thrones takes place largely on a completed map and it's a great bit of storytelling.  Babylon 5 took place between known elements and that worked just fine too.  But Star Trek has always been about going where no one has gone before, and bringing Worf back feels like going a place that two series have already gone, on a map already largely filled out.  It doesn't help that Trek continuity is a mess.  Trying to write an original science fiction story with all the trappings of Star Trek would be insanely difficult even for the best writer unless they did the usual Star Trek thing and ignored a bunch of stuff from the past.  I really like the idea of a new Star Trek.  I like Michael Dorn as an actor and I'd love to see him back, since he's clearly passionate about it.  I just don't think the late 24th century starring a character that the fans recognize and no one else knows is necessarily the way to go about it."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,shinenotburn,3,Mon Jun 29 02:52:21 2015 UTC,Enough Worf. He was on two series and the character never REALLY got less frustrating. Dorn just wants more work. It's not good for Trek.
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,Aperture_Kubi,3,Mon Jun 29 08:14:45 2015 UTC,I can't think of anything more boring and a Worf centered show. Possibly a show thats all about Deanna Troi. That could be worse. Any new Trek show needs a new crew and new ship. Set it further ahead in the timeline. The NEXT next Generation. Lets get some stories about the Enterprise J.
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,gerryblog,5,Mon Jun 29 09:03:40 2015 UTC,"I don't honestly think that a Captain Worf series is a great idea at all. It feels more like a fan-fiction thing than a actual TV project and would end up being more of a vanity piece than anything else.  Don't get me wrong, I really like Worf as a character and Michael Dorn as a actor and part of the creative process. I just don't think that Worf is a good enough character to really carry the burden of a TV series. I think he makes a excellent side character that occasionally gets some great stories but not a character that could be the frontman of a entire show.  There is the other issue. both DS9 and TNG are pretty old. We as fans constantly talk about bringing the TNG or DS9 cast back for another go but we don't really think about what that will actually look like if it were to happen. I mean, sure, you could make the case that the TOS crew did great at more advanced ages (think Star trek VI) but the TOS films never hid their ages away. You knew that they were getting older and the stories, scripts, and characters reflected that.   TNG never had that treatment. The TNG films tried to hide away the advancing ages of the actors/actresses with awkward action set-pieces and poor writing. Instead of showing Picard, Riker, or even Worf growing older, we had Picard getting into knife fights and Riker getting into fisticuffs as if he were still in his mid to late 30's.  DS9 did not have to tackle the age issues since they only really did the seven year run and quit while they were ahead. I am seriously thankful that DS9 never got films because they would have been just as out of touch as the TNG films.  This Captain Worf series idea is way, way past it's expiration date. Dorn is a passionate actor and a great part of the Star trek community but his time in Trek series and film formats is over. I would love to see him take on more roles behind the camera or maybe writing scripts for another persons Trek series but I don't think this vanity project of his really has any legs to stand on."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,WranglerOfSkittles,5,Mon Jun 29 11:49:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, his idea for Star Trek can go right next to Tim Russ' Star Trek Renegades, The Prelude to Axanar and all those other decent Star Trek fan-fictions. They're good stand-alone ideas, but I think that a Star Trek reboot on prime time will have To Boldly Go Where No Show Has Gone Before. ...Or, meekly stick to the same formula that it always has and have potentially dynamic characters be watered down into their roles as bridge officers."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,nickcan,12,Mon Jun 29 14:57:49 2015 UTC,"At the moment, The Worf Chronicles are probably the best bet Trek has to make it back to TV, so I'm all for it.   It sounds like you just don't like the Worf character, which is fine. I'd look up a bit more about what he actually intends -- it sounds like the series would be centered on Worf in the Klingon Empire as it struggles with the Federation's ascendancy and the fallout of the Dominion War, which is very different from what came before.   With TOS, TNG, ENT, and the new movies, it's really beating a dead horse   I don't even know what you mean by that -- the idea of a starship boldly going where noone has gone before is the main motif of Trek. If you think that's beating a dead horse, why do even want Trek back on TV?"
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,inconspicuous_male,10,Mon Jun 29 15:32:06 2015 UTC,"I think we've seen enough of Enterprise exploring stuff. Voyager went the furthest into unexplored space, but the Enterprise just sees the major popular species, and then aliens of the week. I would love to see new aliens and things, but I think we need a new take on it.  I think a new show should revolve around the often-mentioned activity of colonization. I want to see the main crew on a ship helping to set up a new colony on the frontier of known space. I know the close-end of the Delta quadrant is a great unknown. Voyager was on the far end, moving towards known space for a few years before warping right back. there's still a gap there. And there's the largely unexplored wormhole to the Gamma quadrant.  The crew must escort new species to this part of space, defend it, explore it. Sort of a hybrid between the purely exploration-based Enterprise missions and the set space of DS9 that led to deeper storytelling of that one place. It would be cool to see them make a new, wonderful place to live and see what sort of attention it attracts. The Ferengi government might send its aid. The Klingons might want part of this new planet to spread their own empire. The Romulans, on track towards an alliance with the Federation, would also help, but in a very guarded way. New species would come to settle and help out, with a few minor aliens who settle as secondary, recurring characters to give an insight into different parts of this story as different events transpire, such as a Tamarian historian/linguist keeping track of every new experience, some Federation officers reluctantly stationed there, maybe even some of the increasing amounts of de-Borged drones, like SevenOfNine, covered in horrible scars with nowhere else to go.  I like Star Trek because it has a brilliant, well-developed, internally consistent universe, but I think more than one story can be told within it. At this point, we would really have the third generation of Star Trek shows/fans. Even if Dorn's series kicks it off, more original series with more original stories would follow.  I like Worf's character, but he's been used up at this point. He certainly can't carry a whole other show from start to finish. I would love to see him as a recurring secondary character, a Federation Ambassador to Kronos. But an entire show focused on a character we've already seen for 2 shows and his heritage and his name in the ridiculous title and his species' issues is too much. It seems a little selfish to me. I don't see how any other crew member could be given nearly as much screen time or importance with that formula."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,WranglerOfSkittles,8,Mon Jun 29 02:00:37 2015 UTC,"The idea I've had for quite some time involves a Federation fleet getting sent through a wormhole and then stranded in another galaxy, with no hope of going home. Star Trek meets Battlestar, in a sense. This sounds more like what you want (and what I would like to see, and what Star Trek Uncharted fails to deliver) -- very high stakes, necessitating their rebuilding the whole pipeline, and no fleets to save them. Etc.  What you're describing, though, isn't that far off the Enterprise-type ongoing story arc-type Trek, merged with DS9's stationary storyline.  I disagree in terms of Worf carrying a series -- I think of all the characters so far, he has the most potential to make an interesting, involved, multilayered series, and moreover from within an alien culture. We've had a few episodes told from the Klingon perspective, but a season? A series? That's breaking boundaries.   The title's a work in progress -- Dorn openly says that the Captain Worf or Worf Chronicles aren't the titles he'd want. Worf would be the dominant character in the same way Picard and Kirk were dominant characters -- there's still a whole cast around them that can be featured. Even if the name were Star Trek: Worf, he wouldn't be as dominating a presence as Kirk was.   There's an ethnocentrism present in most people when it comes to Trek, and it's highlighted here -- people want more human stories, basically, or find that after a handful of episodes about Worf, we've ""seen and done"" the Klingons. That is something that Trek has never managed to do: give a non-human species as much depth as the human characters inherently have. ST:WC could do that, and I'd be interested in seeing them roll the dice on it.  In all seriousness, I don't expect any of these efforts to go anywhere. It's cheaper for CBS/Paramount to turn out crap like Two and a Half Men, that makes them private islands worth of money, than to bring Trek back. I would be surprised if Trek came back as it's not a show that panders to the lowest common denominator -- the more recent movies show what Trek looks like when it moves in that direction, and though I enjoy NeoTrek for the action movies they are, they're too expensive and too story-thin to propel a TV show.   A lighter-hearted Worf-centered (aka familiar character not requiring seasons of costly buildup, like Enterprise did and Uncharted et al would) Trek is likely the best shot we have of getting Trek back on TV. Selfish or not (which I think is specious reasoning - you'd want no Trek at all over one in which Dorn gets to star after campaigning to bring the series back?), I'm down."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,jimmysilverrims,3,Mon Jun 29 03:02:43 2015 UTC,"You know what I wouldn't mind watching? Season 1: Federation space razed. Season 2: The Federation morphs into the Quarian Migrant Fleet. Season 3: The Federation sets their sights on survival and recolonizing their space, with threats from everyone who now wants their territory. Season 4: The Federation goes to extreme lengths to not be relegated to the trashbin of history."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,SpaceJockey1979,6,Mon Jun 29 03:29:11 2015 UTC,"I like this idea. Let's combine them.   In the 2400s, a federation fleet is exploring and colonizing the outskirts of known space, in the Delta quadrant, or possibly through the wormhole in the Gamma quadrant. They get word back that something is attacking the Federation. Audio cuts in and out, but the Federation is under attack. Through the wormhole or on the sensors they detect one last ship coming towards them, breaking down, just come from a crazy fight. The Enterprise. It's burning, it's going down. The Federation has fallen.  The premise is that some new, far superior species has invaded the alpha quadrant. Not just one Federation ship, but a fleet of them, are forced away from their space into the great unknown, where no man has gone before, but this time not by choice. They're forced to work with their old enemies and allies to protect civilians, make a new home while trying to regain their old one.  I was continuing the what-if of a new Star Trek series, and I saw that documented Federation uniforms stop at 2405 and begin again in the 2800s. I love the idea that the Federation has fallen between those two points. It's the perfect time period for new stories to be told, but when the state of the Star Trek Universe would be relatively similar to what we knew."

I really hate this kind of proposal because I'm worried it'll go even darker than DS9 could and wind up forgetting the optimism of Trek, the belief in bigger and better futures. It might be pitched as ""how can we keep Federation morals alive when the Federation is gone"", but it might turn into a dark brutality of man story given modern popular trends, and I don't feel like that makes for good Trek."
DaystromInstitute,3bgmc9,uberpower,2,Mon Jun 29 23:54:26 2015 UTC,"I have had enough anti-heroes and edgy grimdark fantasies. It is easy to write that stuff because it is easy for people to believe in. It is harder to write a narrative focused on the better parts of human nature without seeming trite but when it is done right it is captivating and doesn't lose its appeal over time. I think this is why TNG stands out and remains the most beloved show in the franchise.    the optimism of Trek, the belief in bigger and better futures   This is what I want to be featured in the next show, not a tedious klingon drama and not some edgelord shit hit the fan federation disaster."

Well, I think we're going to have an overall arc, which is more Worf trying to find his way in the universe, and that will be the overlying arc. Within that arc, we're going to have a lot of stories. But they will all deal with that particular arc.   I think we've had enough of Worf trying to find his way in the universe. His interactions with Alexander in TNG were interesting, but by DS9 Worf's existentialism became sort of annoying. He was upset about stuff, didn't really fit in, we get it. He was a great character, but by the end he was being a little whiny and we don't need a whole third series about him, focusing solely on that. It would be great to have him be a recurring character as an ambassador to Kronos, but we don't need to spend a few years watching Worf get to that point."

If you look for example at the Talosians vs the Organians (ignoring that Organians are more advanced and non-corporeal). There are good and bad ways to use any power that we can wield. Even good and bad ways to command a starship that can destroy cities from orbit.  We don't know a lot about how the Borg became what they are, but either the original race or some race that was peaceably assimilated before they became agressive, was a highly ""thirsty"" civilization, more interested in having some shiny thing that other cultures/biologies had that they wanted than in meeting those cultures and really learning about them.  Can we learn a cautionary lesson from the Borg about the way such technologically-enhanced, interconnected cultures should be built? Yes, and if we do so, we are already better at learning than they think they are achieving through ""assimilation""."

So yeah, your observation actually lines up perfectly with the authorial intent! Good work!"
DaystromInstitute,3bigbs,androidbitcoin,13,Mon Jun 29 14:19:00 2015 UTC,"Earth would have gotten the shit beaten out of it - and then some. Earth Starfleet had an extremely limited ship-building capacity, and even with two spacedocks to build the NX-class ships (plus Jupiter Station pumping out as many weapons as possible) there would be practically no war fleet to speak of.  Vulcan combat cruisers can reach up to Warp 7. NX-class ships can toe the line at 5.2 for a little bit before they get tired. Vulcan combat cruisers have shields and tractor beams. NX-class ships have polarized hull plates and a grappling hook. It would take a spatial charge to take out a Vulcan cruiser's tractoring abilities from the inside, but one guy with super good pruning shears could take out Enterprise's grappling abilities.  So what would an Earth/Andorian - Vulcan war look like?  Day Zero: The Embassy Bombing and Direct Aftermath  Captain Archer and Soval pick up the bodies, say some kind words, and the pair skips town upon hearing of Starfleet's intention on a retaliatory strike on Vulcan.  Day One: War Preparations  Admiral Black orders all Starfleet Captains and XOs to San Francisco for a war council meeting. Shran arrives right before the first commercial break and tags along with Archer and T'Pol (who, by some magical plot hole, decides to side with Starfleet). Black draws up a list of all active Earth Starfleet vessels that can be weaponized and sent into combat with a reasonable chance of success (sorry, Mayweather's freighter, your defenses aren't worth a damn). The list is as follows (sourced from Memory Alpha):   NX-01 Enterprise NX-02 Columbia Shenandoah Republic Saratoga Intrepid   At this point, any sensible Admiral would throw up his hands and go ""on second thought, let's not go to Vulcan - 'tis a silly place"". But nope, they're in it for the long haul. There are a few other Starfleet ships, including freighters and warp testbeds, but they're not worth much in a war with the Vulcans.  Jupiter Station equips all six starships with the latest Earth weapons: Pulsed phase cannons, plasma cannons, photonic torpedoes, and the good old spatial torpedoes for backup. The phase cannons and the photonic torpedoes are the only weapons really worth mentioning, since the plasma/spatial weapons were phased out by weapons development during the series.  So, what about the Vulcans? With rumor of impending war with the humans, they're probably assembling their own expeditionary force with the great Suurok-class combat cruiser. Top speed of Warp 7, plus particle beam weapons that wiped out several of Enterprise's pursuers in a previous episode. It's also got the aforementioned deflector shields and tractor beams, and every bit of Enterprise-era canon will confirm that Vulcan ship design greatly outclasses Starfleet ship design.  But yolo, right?  Day Two: War is Declared  Admiral Black sends a courtesy call to Administrator V'Las, informing him in no uncertain terms that he is done with the Vulcan's racist crap, and that he is going to shock and awe them with everything in Starfleet's arsenal. The war is on, and the first turn advantage goes to Starfleet as they launch their attack fleet.  Humans are wily creatures - they know they can't win a direct confrontation, but they've got some serious hubris balls. Shran is impressed, but he knows the humans are goners and leaves for Andoria immediately. Meanwhile, Starfleet launches Dominion War-style raids on important Vulcan structures....and gets immediately repulsed by defending starships. Meanwhile, the Vulcan War Fleet is speeding towards the Sol system.  Day Three: The Vulcans Arrive  Early warning subspace radar goes nuts on the morning of Day Three - a buttload of warp signatures are headed straight for Earth, and they seem to be Vulcan. By this time, both in canon and in this scenario, Shran has realized that the Vulcans are bad news for the Andorians, and shows up with the Andorian battle fleet in orbit of Earth (just in time for the retreating Starfleet vessels to form a picket line with them).  The Vulcans warp into the system just minutes after Captain Archer and Shran set up the defensive line by Earth. The head of the Vulcan flotilla orders all Starfleet ships to surrender. Captain Archer, acting on Admiral Black's orders, refuses. The pointy-eared bastards have to PAY for killing Vaughn Armstrong and nearly killing Gary Graham. Cut to black.  The commercial break ends as the ships close in on each other. Suddenly, the Vulcan ship Suurok breaks formation, charging weapons. Enterprise gets a weapons lock on Suurok and is ready to pull the trigger, but it doesn't get the chance. Suurok sends a long-range particle beam shot right into San Francisco, just strong enough to make it through the atmosphere and vaporize the Admiral's executive office. The Vulcans fire the first shot, and the Andorians/Starfleet open fire.  The other Vulcan ships lay down covering fire as Suurok heads to the Moon, charging weapons banks for an extremely powerful shot. The older Starfleet ships are hit first, being the easiest targets, and several Andorian ships take a couple of bad hits...but the worst is yet to come.  Suurok finishes charging weapons banks, then plots an intricate firing solution on the Moon's Sea of Tranquility - and fires a continuous shot, carving a gigantic IDIC into the Moon. It is a defiance of logic, but the message is clear: Vulcans rule, humans drool.  The battle rages for several more minutes. Enterprise, Columbia, Intrepid, and Kumari put up a good fight. A Vulcan cruiser is disabled by heavy combined fire, and has to retreat towards the Asteroid Belt, and several others take damage. Some of the Vulcans conduct a few more surgical strikes on Earth, blowing out communications relays and defensive equipment on planet and in orbit - while other ships launch full on assaults on the defending fleet.  A couple more ships go down in flames, naturally, but the battle is over almost as soon as it begins. The Vulcans don't need to destroy Earth, just get it out of the way of their plans. Once Earth's central command goes down, they become irrelevant. Captain Archer, as the highest ranking officer in Starfleet at the time, surrenders - giving the humans a chance to limp back to spacedock and lick their wounds. Shran hightails it to a defensible location near Andoria as Administrator V'Las launches the anti-Andorian war fleet, and the Romulans begin their own pro-unification maneuvers, uninhibited by Starfleet. The Syrrannites are wiped out a few days later by Vulcan ground forces, and Surak's teachings are soon lost to the ages.  Summary:  The war is a disaster. The Vulcans outclass Starfleet by a few orders of magnitude, and were able to conduct humiliating and disastrous surgical strikes against Starfleet, removing it from the game. T'Pol never gets the chance to reunite with her mother, V'Las continues his secret Romulan deception as planned, and Soval is exiled.  If the war had been conducted differently with direct confrontations, Starfleet would have been #rekt even harder. Vulcan ships are WAY faster than Starfleet ships, and can evade conflict when inconvenient - or conduct ambush raids on freighters and guard ships whenever they want. Hell, they don't even need to shoot the lower-class Starfleet ships. They could just latch on to the hull with a tractor beam and do donuts in a radius of 0.005 AU around the Starfleet ship until its hull rips apart. The Vulcans have infrastructure that can launch new ships, but Starfleet has like, one spacedock sitting in plain sight - and therefore can't even replace its crappy ships when they get destroyed in the war.  What about a ground war?  We've seen the MACOs in action. What if Enterprise manages to transport MACO Team Six into the Vulcan capital city with the intent of going bin-Laden on the Vulcan High Council?  It would still fail. There are two people who can beat up Benedict Cumberbatch: Martin Freeman (S2E1 Sherlock) and Zachary Quinto (STID). In the case of the latter, Quinto plays a version of Spock so powerful that he can beat the Earl Grey Tea out of Sherlock Khan in a fistfight, with OP fists, high speed running, and the ability to leap from transport to transport without breaking his legs.  So imagine a fight between the MACOs, with their guns and grenades, against Vulcan supermen (packing heat with Lirpa polearms and phasers). It would be a massacre.  And that's why there wasn't a war in the first place. If there were an embassy bombing conducted by an evenly matched power with ulterior motives, Earth Starfleet would have (in the cringeworthy Insurrection line) saddled up, locked, and loaded - ready to either extract an apology or lay the smack down upon the aggressors.  TL;DR: Earth loses."

DaystromInstitute,3bigbs,zer0number,2,Tue Jun 30 16:01:48 2015 UTC,"Nice post... I don't think it's wise to completely write off earth, I mean, we successfully invaded and subjicated Vulcan in the alternate timeline."

DaystromInstitute,3bigbs,disposable_pants,11,Wed Jul 1 17:27:34 2015 UTC,"It took Earth three years to build a second NX class starship. They apparently had only a single spacedock that could even build the things.   The majority of Earth's starfleet is made up of Warp 2 and Warp 3 capable starships, about six Intrepid class ships existed and probably a similar number of the smaller ""warp delta"" type ships (Neptune class?).  We've seen or heard of three classes of Vulcan starship (Suurok, D'Kyr and Maymora classes) along with two smaller class of combatants (seen in Awakening and Kir'Shara). Since Vulcan ships can push Warp 6 the Vulcans can pick the circumstances of the engagement against any Earth starship and they are far more heavily armed plus equipped with shields.  Since Earth is only days or weeks travel from Vulcan. The Vulcans could easily destroy Earth's shipyards long before any new NX class ships could be build then simply blockade the system till Earth surrendered. Earth's starfleet might have been able to take shelter in Andorian space and continue the fight but unless the Andorians when all in and declared war attrition would quickly degrade Earth's starfleet till it was no longer effective."
DaystromInstitute,3bigbs,TLAMstrike,3,Mon Jun 29 18:24:25 2015 UTC,"It took Earth three years to build a second NX class starship. They apparently had only a single spacedock that could even build the things.   That's peacetime production, though.  If Starfleet were to shift to a war footing they certainly could build more quickly.    What's more interesting to me is the type of war the Vulcans would fight.  Would they wage total war, or would their logic and morality prohibit that?  I could easily see a situation where their culture causes them to fight with one hand behind their back."
DaystromInstitute,3bigbs,adamkotsko,6,Tue Jun 30 03:01:34 2015 UTC,"The Columbia was under construction before the initial Xindi attack on Earth, over a year and a half later it finally left spacedock missing out on the Babel Crisis that nearly caused another war. That is a year of production in de facto wartime.  That doesn't bode well for Earth's production capabilities. Even if they could cut the production time in half (9 months) their enemy is only a few weeks away.  As to the type of war the Vulcans would conduct, they seemed willing to conduct airstrikes and orbital bombardment of their own homeworld in 'Affliction'. They also had previously forcibly relocated Andorian civilians to camps on Weytahn and at the time of this incident were preparing for a preemptive strike on the Andorians.  However I think they wouldn't have to resort to total war, simply destroying Earth's shipyards and hunting down any Earth Starfleet vessels not destroyed while taking the system would be sufficient to allow them to blockade Earth till the Earth Government surrenders or just ceases to be a threat. If the Vulcans own high orbit there isn't much Earth can do about it sans the verteron array on Mars."
DaystromInstitute,3bigbs,markzeo,3,Tue Jun 30 04:30:47 2015 UTC,"I doubt the small diplomatic gains that humans had facilitated would be sufficient for the Andorians to risk an all-out war with the Vulcans. We would basically be done for -- which is why I assume it wouldn't come to that. It's only Archer's suspicion and curiosity that lead them to uncover the truth in the first place. Presumably without his involvement, the powers that be on Earth would have accepted the official story and moved on with life."
DaystromInstitute,3bigbs,adamkotsko,3,Mon Jun 29 14:22:05 2015 UTC,"The Andorians were already pretty close to war with the Vulcans, dating back to the P'Jem incident. That, combined with Shran's affection for Archer would be enough to push the Andorians to the Human side in this hypothetical conflict."
DaystromInstitute,3bigbs,Detrinex,4,Mon Jun 29 17:10:11 2015 UTC,I guess it depends on how much pull (as opposed to just autonomy) we think Shran has.
DaystromInstitute,3bh06o,dontthrowmeinabox,13,Mon Jun 29 03:38:25 2015 UTC,"I think it would be extremely tricky. Marvel had quite a few missteps and flops before finally coming on a formula that works in Iron Man. It's hard to remember now that we're in the era of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but there was Ang Lee's introspective Hulk, Ben Afleck as Daredevil, a mediocre Punisher or two, and then things got really bad with Elektra, the Fantastic Four movies, and the Ghost Rider* movies. Between all of those were a lot of failures, half-assed attempts, and mediocrity.   The problems were numerous, but I've always figured a bit part of it was an unwillingness to fully commit to making a comic book movie. The attempts either were apologies for being comic book movies and were made needlessly Dark and Gritty (tm) or they were so light and so little effort was put into them that it could have been made by a computer program based on family-friendly audience feedback.   So, getting to Star Trek, the question becomes what it is that audiences are really looking for, that thing which can be delivered on unapologetically. On the one hand, I do think audiences have simply come to expect that science fiction be adventure. On the other hand, though, explosions do not a movie make. There seems to be a general consensus that of the two NuTrek films, the first was better. It was trying to do a bit less, no one really felt all that shoehorned in, the plot made enough sense not to be a distraction, and while it was incredibly dark (the body count for Star Trek (2009) was in the billions) it also didn't take itself too seriously and allowed for a decent amount of levity. Sure, it was light on moral lessons, philosophy, optimism, and maybe borrowed more from Star Wars than it needed to, but it was largely fine.   The problem, though, is that there was something really, really big missing: television. No, I don't mean the medium, I'm fine with Star Trek movies. I mean that the Star Trek movies very often were a jarring shift in tone from the television shows, and only some of it was for practical reasons. Sure, you've got a bigger budget on the big screen, but I think we can all agree putting Picard in a dune buggy giggling like a child before ramping it into the Argo, the captain's yacht which seems purpose built for carrying around the dune buggy was a hard left turn from the tv series. Even with a movie which wasn't from a television series, you can't just pretend the tv series never happened.   So how does this Star Trek Cinematic Universe thing work?   Step 1: New Universe. No time travel red matter black hole doohigie. just a new universe in which Starfleet and the Klingons and Romulans and such exist. No Enterprise. I adore the Enterprise family, but the name has become so iconic that it serves as a distraction. Go with another name, from one of the NASA space shuttles, like Discovery, Endeavor, or Challenger. Why NASA? Because Starfleet is where NASA should be heading and Star Trek should be working hand in hand with those who exist in the 21st century who are pushing us in the right direction. No Kirk or Picard or Sisko or Archer. No established canon. This needs to be a place for everyone to get on board at the same time.   Step 2: Hope for the best but prepare for the worst. You spec out everything from the get-go, the four or five different in-universe crews and/or individuals to follow across a number of movies before the eventual crossover, the television show, where everything is headed 20 years down the line with like 14 movies and 2 tv series. But you also make it so that the first film can be a satisfying ending. Or the first crossover after all of the individual movies can be a satisfying ending.   Step 3: The first movie is all about making a good first impression. RDJ, a tight script, and one of the best movie trailers in history all did the job of ensuring that the audience loved Iron Man. Iron Man was previously a third-tier hero, frankly, but after the movie came out Iron Man was a top-tier Marvel hero, who's name was every bit as recognizable as Wolverine and Spider-Man. That's why I think the first movie should be about a smaller crew. You want the movie to connect with people's pioneering spirit, you want the movie to have a solid action element, and you want compelling characters that the audience can really latch onto. And you want the best movie trailer of the year to get butts into seats. The last decent Star Trek trailer was probably First Contact, but despite the fact that was such a great film, even that can't possibly hope to compete with Iron Man. Very funny and charming Stark, the fall from grace, the building himself back from nothing with his mind, the dramatic return, the heroic turn, the coolest suit imaginable, robots fighting, rock music. It all just works. Star Trek needs that.   Step 4: the rest of Phase 1. The first movie is about a smaller crew of smaller ship of exploration, but the other films are much different. The first one is part swashbuckling adventure and part pioneering spirit of exploration. Now we need a new theme group. The second film is an outpost along the neutral zone with the Klingons and is a tense political thriller. The third is about the flagship, engaged in diplomacy and peacekeeping and is more the regal space opera. The fourth is the wild-card: the Klingon movie, about the first movie's Klingon counterparts on a Bird of Prey-like vessel. Their Avengers is a catastrophe which happens along the Neutral Zone between the Federation and Klingons which requires the first joint mission. Introduce the Romulans, which have been lurking in the background of the previous movies, and end with a peace treaty.   By this time, it should be clear whether or not things are successful. If it's a smash, go full steam ahead into Phase 2 and introduce a television series which directly ties in. Have a few new crews or even individuals to focus movies on. If things aren't going well—and this is vital—pivot and move the whole thing to television. Whatever is the most popular gets its own prime time television show on CBS (or, preferably, HBO or Netflix, but that's a pipe dream) which continues the stories for fans that stuck with it, and which can be used as a platform to redouble efforts to get fans engaged (get it?)."

Between all of those were a lot of failures, half-assed attempts, and mediocrity.   Marvel use to sell rights to other studios to make the movies.  They didn't make much money and didn't maintain any artistic control.  That's why they set up their own production shop and started working towards The Avengers.  Iron Man was the first movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.  Lterally every dud you named there isn't theirs.  Although The Incredible Hulk kinda sorta in-universe acknowledges Ang Lee's crap-fest.  Sadly they still don't have rights back on most the characters you named.  The Fantastic Four coming out this summer isn't there's, but strangely it's sequel will be in the universe.  Ditto on Spiderman."
DaystromInstitute,3bh06o,fleshrott,5,Mon Jun 29 12:12:58 2015 UTC,Lterally every dud you named there isn't theirs.   Pretty sure that was Willravel's point. That there were a lot of missteps leading up to Iron Man and the beginning of the actual MCU.
DaystromInstitute,3bh06o,gravitydefyingturtle,2,Mon Jun 29 19:39:34 2015 UTC,"To quote him again   Marvel had quite a few missteps and flops   But they didn't.  They licensed the stuff, and it has nothing to do with the MCU.  Everything he named happened before Marvel even made the decision to create the MCU.  Is licensing it out the first place (which was a thing for decades before) the misstep?  If so it's one that'd be hard to do with the more monolithic (IP-wise) Star Trek franchise."
DaystromInstitute,3bh06o,fleshrott,4,Mon Jun 29 20:18:55 2015 UTC,"Abramsverse continues onscreen.   Post-Nemesis STO-leaning show runs as a miniseries that focuses on a major event each season (a la Torchwood S3+4 and Agent Carter).  The largest show follows a timeship with a diverse cast of characters from all over time and space. This show's the bread and butter, and through its ""anywhere, anywhen"" premise, is capable of more worldbuilding than most any show could do alone.  These tales are united through temporal shenanigans, and all crews will unite to face forces far greater than anything encountered before. Reaper-like entities from outside the Milky Way. Lovecraftian entities from beyond this realm of existence. You get the picture.  Most connections are through simple Red Sky Crossovers and, of course, references to prior Trek."
DaystromInstitute,3bh06o,jimmysilverrims,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:13:39 2015 UTC,"Essentially I do what Disney is doing with the Star Wars Legends films or whatever they're called. For those not in the know, they're a chance to take on Star Wars without having to go for the traditional Star Wars, well, everything. As an example, the first of those films is going to be about simple soldiers and have a more grey morality. One of the big strengths of this approach is every movie cast can die because they're not our series regulars, which naturally means you can do more.  For the purposes of the thought experiment let's say it has to be tied to the Abramsverse. It can still be set within the Abramsverse and utilize different aesthetics and pacing, so really the best thing in my mind is to just not specify it at all, and to not connect with the main films beyond a shared concept, like something a scientist spends a whole film working to create getting the very briefest of namedrops in the ""main"" films.  You could make a tense starship combat heavy movie that starts out at typical Abrams battle pacing, but as both combatants become more and more damaged, it breaks down to a slow, tense, submarine-battle-style conflict.  You could do a take on Brewster's Millions starring a Ferengi. For those not in the know, the essential premise is that the protagonist must spend x amount of dollars (and any profit obtained from those dollars) in y amount of time in order to receive a much larger amount, with strict conditions that make it extremely difficult.  Fail, and they remain penniless.  You could do a slow paced, really gorgeous sci fi film in the style of the 70's, about a moral scientist performing illegal genetic experimentations in some quiet corner of the Federation or something.  You could do a gorgeous 2D animated film, allowing for a lot of really bizarre or abstract aliens or concepts that are very visually distinct. As an easy example, you could do something involving Klingons and their conquered species. Because it's animation, you're not limited by how many prosthetic foreheads you can afford or needing humanoid forms, and you could show Batleths used 'properly' without requiring extra training for actors. I chose 2D animation because in this day and age, that alone makes it stand out, and also because cheap or bad cgi really stands out to me.  You could even do a romance about an Earth-bound civilian and a Starfleet officer whose duties take them far, far away (preferably at least with a woman as the Starfleet officer; the reputation Star Trek has as progressive should be utilized fully; you could pull something much more bold like not revealing til the very end that it's a gay relationship and letting the audience come at it with their own preconceptions first).  These needn't, and shouldn't, all be theatrical releases. Too much ""big screen"" material causes burn out; let some of it be through alternate means like netflix, amazon streaming, whatever (I think straight to home release is dying off). The big purpose in doing a lot of different films like this, though, is to give Trek some versatility it's lost over the years and broaden how it can appeal to people."
DaystromInstitute,3bh06o,Berggeist,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:22:43 2015 UTC,"I think if I was doing a big universe, I'd keep the movies as early-TOS era, and let TV and Netflix type shows be prequel/sequel to that era, but avoid much overlap.  Sort of analogous to how TOS was on the big screen while TNG was in its run.  It lets all the writers on the different projects have a wide amount of freedom to tend to their own era without as much stomping on each other.  Especially since there is apparently a Paramount/CBS split on right for film vs. TV that I haven't researched extensively.  Work from the 2009 universe for everything.  Rebooting again now will turn it into Spiderman and make it hard for fans to keep track of everything, which mostly makes them stop caring.  On the big screen:  A - Harry Mudd - The misadventures of a goofy tramp freighter captain on the fringes of known space.  Less giant action focus, relatively inexpensive compared to mainline ""Star Trek"" movies.  Light hearted comedy brings in a fan base that isn't that thrilled about sci fi space battles, and doesn't give a darn about the worldbuilding.  B - Klingons - A series of films following a Klingon character on a Klingon ship.  He eventually becomes the captain of a battlecruiser.  Attempt to deal with some of the weird plot holes in Star Trek Into Darkness, and have the Klingons be actively building up strength in response to Federation provocation.  One lone warrior tries to take the old ways seriously and fight honorably in a corrupt and decadent empire.  Sort of pay off some of the ideas that Dorn wants to do with Captain Worf, except from a 100% Klingon perspective.  Notes of Serpico as the main character tries to act honorably and clean up the KDF but hits resistance from the old guard classist elite.  Steal some writers from game of thrones.  Grand epic storyline.  Targeted towards fans who really want to see more of how Klingon live is like day-to-day.  C - Main TOS - Kirk commands the Enterprise.  This is obviously the most important in some ways, but the least important in others.  It's where all the brand recognition already is, so it mostly requires not screwing it up rather than launching something awesome.  Next TOS film would probably introduce the Klingon character before he gets spun off into his own series.  Which all leads up to a Klingon War movie, which would be like the ""Avengers"" mashup concept for MCU.  Except if Marvel had a series of Loki movies as part of the setup so you had some of the fans rooting for the ""bad guys.""  The Klingon captain goes toe to toe with the Enterprise.  Mudd has to choose which side to help at the last minute, etc.  If you do about a movie every year, this easily covers 10-11 years of movies.  3 movies from each subject, plus a Klingon War 2-parter.  Meanwhile, on the TV side...  First Steps - I have put a bit of thought into this, though admittedly I don't have a decent title.  I think I've mentioned it here before.  If I was Emperor of Star Trek, this would be put into production Real Quick to celebrate the 50th anniversary.  Probably a Netflix series.  Kind of like Daredevil, not a big loud action porn fest like Paramount wants to do with the TOS movies.  More philosophical discussions between Vulcans and humans.  It would start with the launch of the Phoenix, but not from the perspective of Zephram Cochrane.  He wouldn't be a major character.  Colonel Greene is running a military government in San Francisco in the remnants of the old United States after World War III.  The opening is watching his NORAD panic about an ICBM launch (the phoenix) and narrowly avoid starting World War IV by convincing the asian countries that it isn't an attack.  They congratulate themselves about the fact that history will surely remember that they saved the world that day.  Then we see the same event from the Vulcan's perspective.  They are ice mining on Pluto or something when they detect a human warp ship.  The captain has been a student of Earth for years and finds the place fascinating.  But with the primitive technology of the time, they can't radio Vulcan for instructions quickly enough, so they decide to BE Bold and make first contact against standing orders.  Do it as a one-shot 13 episode run with ability to do more seasons if it is popular, but tell a complete story.  Some people on Earth treat the vulcans as alien invaders.  Some think they are angels.  Some simply don't believe they are actually aliens.  Let that play out all on Earth.  The very end of the season would have a human embarking to be the first person to make the crossing to Vulcan.  Existing fans will be fascinated by attempting to dig into an important part of the history.  New fans may be interested in a show that stays on Earth and really focuses on genuine human reactions played straight.  Just like Game of Thrones is Fantasy without the focus on Fantasy, First Steps would be Space Opera without the Space Opera.  A ton of the focus is on the characters who have human problems, and live in an era before humanity fixed everything.  Much of the balance would be on the Vulcan characters and really using their alien-ness to hold up a mirror to the humans.  Section 31 - Spy adventure show like the original Mission Impossible meets James Bond in the Star Trek universe.  Overthrowing governments.  Manipulating resource prices.  Meeting beautiful aliens.  Probably set post-TOS.  Maybe have an older version of a character who served during TOS who can reference stuff that is about to happen in the next movie for optimal tie-in potential.  Dealings with Tal Shiar and Obsidian Order agents spice things up, but alliances are always shifting.  A whole series of your favorite Garak episodes from DS9.  And eventually you probably need a traditional planet of the week exploration aboard a hero space ship show.  Everybody expects it, but don't rush to it.  I think Enterprise proved that fans can get bored of the format if you don't have something special to do with it, and it hasn't been that long since Enterprise was on the air.  OTOH, it's been nearly long enough that you could just reboot TNG.  Do this 5+ years out.  I'm not convinced the new galaxy pitch that has been floating around is the best way to go with this, but it might well be a great show.  If you do reboot TNG, make the Ferengi the villains they were intended to be rather than comedic.  In light of the 2008 financial collapse, evil hypercapitalists can make a lot more sense as a villain to the audience.  Take away the weird Ferengi sexism.  And actually play out the intended story arc from Conspiracy.  Those two tweaks will push you in the right direction for a fun reboot that has a lot of potential to have ""edge"" and make serious social commentary, but certainly doesn't need to be full-on ""dark and gritty"" 100% of the time.  Then probably eventually reboot DS9, but I'd say that should probably be 10+ years away.  It's more recent than TNG, and TNG is right at the threshold of being old enough to just reboot outright.  But this time, do a lot more worldbuilding on Bajor.  The show always referred to the ""northern continent"" and ""the capital city.""  Sit down and figure out how the occupation actually worked, and who is in power, and how the relationship with the federation works.  An anthology series that does miniseries of 2-8 episodes in any given place, with minimal ""big universe"" character overlap between stories.  Below Decks - ""Upstairs Downstairs with a Warp Core.""  All about junior officers, probably working in Engineering of some starship.  A vague B-plot of every episode involves the bridge crew needing some Deus ex Machina from the main characters who are never really told why or what is going on or where they are.  It would be the A-plot of the bridge crew were the main characters.  But the actual A-plot always revolves around what's happening in Engineering. One Engineer has a date with two different Ensigns on the same night, so they program the holodeck to simulate two different restaurants right next to each other kind of stuff.  Stuff like when Nog traded away Sisko's desk as part of a complicated series of trades to get a part to make a repair schedule.  Sort of an office comedy in the way that The Office was never really about the nitty gritty of paper sales.  Lots of scenes of engineering crew pitching accessible 20th century metaphors for deus ex machina machines so the chief engineer can say clever exposition things like ""we need to recalibrate the energy matrix so we sour the milk for the alien creature"" in their conferences with the bridge crew.  Office of the President = West Wing in space.  Following the diplomatic corps and the political machinations of the Federation and it's president.  Sulu was president in some Beta canon, so you could get George Takei to play old John Cho as an occasional guest, but most of the show would focus on his staff who are generally in awe of him, and almost never get to directly take much of his time."
DaystromInstitute,3bh06o,wrosecrans,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:07:40 2015 UTC,there is apparently a Paramount/CBS split on right for film vs. TV that I haven't researched extensively   That's okay: I have. :)
DaystromInstitute,3bh06o,Algernon_Asimov,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:47:10 2015 UTC,"i really liked what was done with the new frontiers book series. the stories were set apart in its own little corner of the galaxy, and it was so far apart from the rest of the trek literature. and it WORKED.  i try to keep up with memory beta with whats happening with the crews post destiny, but there's so much crossover its hard to keep up.  personally, i'd emphasize that starfleet is in some sort of trouble. the attack over the last few years doesnt have a lot of spaceships. cadets are being dragged out of the academy as quickly as they can. thrown in a ship that is only just barely ready for space travel.  i dont know, maybe they could be looking for something? have it vital to the safety of the future of the federation. along the way, pick up random characters to mix up the crew.  let kirk and co have the enterprise. have the movies. see how well the new show goes."
DaystromInstitute,3bh06o,tmofee,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:48:55 2015 UTC,"So my plan will presumably come into effect after Star Trek Beyond has been released next year. OK.  We'll have to continue on with the Abramsverse timeline. It's not perfect but it'd be damn silly to reboot the whole thing all over again. Besides, Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto have already agreed to return for a fourth movie – which suits my purposes, because I think we'd need to start with the foundation of Kirk-Spock-and-the-Enterprise and spin off any other cinematic properties from there. The Abramsverse has got audiences coming to see Star Trek again but they're also expecting to see Kirk, Spock and the Enterprise: it's not like the 1990s any more when you could come up with any spinoff you wanted and fill it with a crew of random people.  So, here are the three main things I will start with: The USS Enterprise – A continuation of the main series – but I don't want to be too dependent on the first three movies, so I'd include a significant time skip of about ten years to provide some breathing space. This still has the trio of Kirk, Spock and McCoy, but apart from that there's room to split up the crew and shift them over to the spinoffs. Anyway, the thing that distinguishes these particular movies is that they're more focused on the big sweeping events that affect the Federation. The USS Excelsior – This ship is introduced in Star Trek 4 (due out around 2019-ish) and then get their own movie the following year. Captain Hikaru Sulu commands; Pavel Chekov is chief engineer. (Perhaps there can be some other familiar characters in key roles here and there: Dr Chapel, Communications Officer Rand, Navigation Officer Kyle, etc.) The Excelsior goes further and faster than the Enterprise, so the thing that distinguishes these movies is that they really focus on the ""strange new worlds on the frontier"" thing and not so much about hostile Klingons or whatever. A border-region space station – Yes, this is quite a lot like a 23rd-century DS9 equivalent. But here's the difference: I think that a static setting like a space station is the perfect place to have ""lower-decks""-type main characters, rather than focusing on the command staff. These movies will be able to explore some of the seedy underbelly of the Star Trek universe (like the Orion Syndicate, and characters like Harry Mudd and Cyrano Jones), and will also give us a person-level view of the Federation's borders. This setting can be introduced either in Star Trek 4 or the Excelsior movie, and its first movie would come out in 2021.  So, we have three separate settings, which gives us one movie per year on a three-year cycle – not a bad start. If we were to get more confident then we could start introducing more spinoffs that are less strongly connected to the previous material – first as one-offs, then maybe give them sequels if successful enough (possible examples include Starfleet Academy, Starfleet Intelligence and/or Section 31, maybe something based around civilians, etc.)."
DaystromInstitute,3bh06o,Cole-Spudmoney,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:10:41 2015 UTC,"Allright, there's one portion of Star Trek that I've always wanted to see a show about, and that's Section 31. So here goes: Section 31 is basically the Federations black ops wing. The Federation doesn't acknowledge their existence, but these are the guys and gals that get the dirty jobs. I want to see a movie where a small S31 ship gets sent to investigate why a Federation outpost right on the edge of the neutral zone has gone dark. They can't send in a bigger ship because that would be noticed by the Romulans, so they send in a small team in an old clunker to fix things. This is where it gets more Star Trek-ish, because it turns out the outpost was sabotaged, but the team can't figure out how or why. So they science the hell out of the place. Y'know, tricorders, technobabble, the whole nine yards. But the whole time, there is something watching them, with the team occasionally catching glimpses of it out of the corners of their eyes. Eventually the team finds out that the base was actually a cover for a small lab that was experimenting with ways to weaponize a baryon sweep. When the lab was sabotaged the Baryon Sweep Bomb (or whatever) wiped out all organic matter. Upon reviewing the lab records they discover that one of the scientists was actually an android, leading the team to (correctly) believe that the android was the saboteur. What happens next is a lethal game of cat and mouse through the base as the android tries to kill the Section 31 agents and steal their ship. Eventually the team prevails (as 'heroes' must) and the Science Officer data mines the dead android's brain to find out why it acted the way it did. This reveals that the android was actually built using schematics based on Lore's positronic brain, and then used as a slave by asshole members of Section 31's science division. Eventually the android got tired of their shit and sabotaged the BSB in order to escape. The Section 31 team reports this to their superiors, only to be given a new mission. The End?  NO! Because there's still a t.v. series to be made! The show follows the same team, who looks like this: The Captain - A human cyborg. I know Gene Roddenberry wasn't a fan of transhumanism, but I think it's something that could bring some nice pathos to the show, having him struggle with the reactions of more conservative Federation citizens who find his enhancements disconcerting. The Commander: An Andorian female, she specializes in planning and is an excellent navigator (these people still have to fly their own ship you know). The 'Security' Officer: Really just a Bajoran guy who poses as a security officer when they have to pretend to be a 'legit' Starfleet vessel. He likes explosions and Klingon food because they make him feel tough. The Science Officer: A Ktarian with a worryingly loose grasp on morals. Generally a very happy person, especially when doing SCIENCE!!!!! The Engineer: A Vulcan. He's actually pretty normal, all things considered. Refuses to talk about why he isn't allowed in the Vulcan system anymore. The Ships 'Counselor': A Betazoid who specializes in Psychological operations and warfare. Also the ship's counselor. Don't worry, it's totally fine. Really. Most importantly though, all these people are patriots. They honestly believe in what they're doing, and do want to make the Federation a safer place. They're just not as picky about how that is accomplished as, say, Captain Picard.  The beauty of the show is that it's like if Star Trek and Shadowrun had a baby. Sometimes an episode will be about the team escorting an ambassador to a meeting that might be a trap. Other times they've got to go investigate a strange energy reading coming from a contested area of space. Other times they will have to help Klingon raiders who are targeting Romulan supply lines, or sabotage peace talks between the Orions and the Gorn.  Of course, this all necessitates the movie and show being set at the end of the 24th century, or the beginning of the 25th. Personally, I'd like to see the 25th century with the Khitomer Accords starting to break down because of outside interference from the Iconians (assuming Star Trek Online is considered canon)."
DaystromInstitute,3bh06o,Spades-27,-1,Wed Jul 1 22:53:05 2015 UTC,"I am also going to say Abramsverse with 0% sarcasm or joking.  I hated Abrams before that.    Forever Young: Garbage Gone Fishin': Garbage Armageddon: Steaming pile of excrement; one of the most laughable films I have ever seen Mission Impossible III: The best so far, which was not saying much as they are terrible films Cloverfield: gag Felicity: Trash Alias: Horrible Lost: Convoluted and horrible Fringe: Ridiculous, like some horrible X-Files ripoff   Then around 2009 he turns it around with Star Trek. And he hits a home run. Out of nowhere. He finds his groove. He follows it up with Person of Interest. Stellar show.   They finally cancel something of his early and...it's Revolution? Almost Human never stood a chance, but it had wings and could fly.   Ghost Protocol was...actually alright.   And he's got this Star Trek thing working. He's found it. His groove. I really am in want for nothing save more stories. If Bad Robot wanted to make a show alongside it, I would be happy if they did.  I've always wanted a ""Star Trek Adventures"" show where they could re-use sets, costumes, etc and tell one-off stories on a weekly basis. He sort of did that with Fringe. Why not do it with Star Trek?  There are plenty of actors who would love to be on ST. The show would be a great proving ground for potential movies. You could have a ""Ferengi trade episode"" with just Ferengi, completely encapsulated in one story. There doesn't need to be a steady cast, just good stories.  With the original ST, Roddenberry found great writers to pen his stories. Think about it. Harlan Ellison wrote an ST episode. Find these great writers, let them do whatever they want and film that 22 times a year. Revisit things that deserve revisiting.   That's what I'd like to see. The rest of the universe. And JJ Abrams can handle that. He gets it now and his resume proves it."

This isn't surprising since energy capacity (both production and storage) seems to be essentially unlimited in the future. EDIT: This is implicit in the existence of transporters and matter-energy replicators. They probably use a 20th-century power plant's worth of energy just to replicate your morning coffee.

I've long suspected that most portable federation technology has built in wireless charging and most federation facilities just have wireless power fields as part of their design.

DaystromInstitute,3bhpr6,ProtoKun7,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:19:03 2015 UTC,There's at least one example in Voyager's Repression. Tuvok tries to fire a phaser but it has no power.

As for how many shots, I imagine it would depend on power settings. Level 16 would deplete the cell quickly, but level 1-2 (lowest stun settings) can probably be used for a long time."

In human pregnancies, if the baby ends up with a different blood-type than the mother, the mother's immune system can attack the baby's blood, which can cause problems.  But we're talking about Spock. Spock, whose mother is a human with iron-based blood, and who himself has copper-based vulcan-style blood. How ... what? Surely that's going to cause some sort of pregnancy problems. I mean, sure, it's the 24th century, medical technology has progressed. But that still seems like a very big hurdle."

However, I think it's more likely that as a infant/young child he may have had mixed blood, with all the anti-bodies cross-polinated so that they didn't freak out on each other. Later on his Vulcan biology began to become more dominate and the red blood gradually filtered out of his system leaving him with only the green blood of a vulcan."

In a way, I would submit that they are very, very similar to the Federation in the way they function. Cybernetic governance allows the Borg to optimally allocate resources, while every drone is provided and cared for. The Borg is as much a post-scarcity society as the Federation.   The only slight difference is their purpose - as Q says, the Borg is the ultimate user. The Federation, on the other hand, is not imperialist.  That strange and engrossing similarity is what makes the Borg so cool as a nemesis."
DaystromInstitute,3bfc5r,trekonomics,4,Sun Jun 28 20:43:46 2015 UTC,"A similar comparison between the Borg and the Federation was made by Eddington to Sisko, though that was specifically about how each share the goal of getting others into their organization."

One point it makes is that we must first use philosophy so that we even know where to start with new branches of science.  So in the Borg's pursuit of perfection, the question here is whether their philosophies have advanced enough that every mystery to them is examined sufficiently that it can be studied by science. I don't think that's the case. Given the existence of higher beings like the Q, the borg obviously have a long ways to go. Whatever Q was trying to teach Picard in the final episode of TNG I feel is something only our philosophies can tackle for now, since we're so immature compared to the Q.  If the Borg encounter a Q, or they assimilate someone who has encountered a Q, they sure better have some philosophers in their collective because the scientists basically have no meaningful thoughts on the matter."
DaystromInstitute,3bfc5r,Zulban,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:43:12 2015 UTC,"That might apply to philosophy of mind, but it is completely senseless to argue that we could pass off for example, ethics because of the is-ought problem which makes it pretty much impossible to examine moral questions empirically.  Philosophy of math cannot be passed off to the sciences either, it is simply beyond empiricism.  Epistemology and philosophy of science are beyond science because they deal entirely with the methods that underly science."

I should really write something sometime in full so I can stop explaining myself half-assed in reddit comments. But here's a taste...  There are two people, each proposing different strategies to combat drug addiction. One person wants to incarcerate addicts for longer, the other wants to open injection sites that offer counselling and addiction treatment.  Sure, you could say this ethical problem is is-ought. What ought we to do? But in fact, if we examine the evidence with science, there is a factual answer to how best to reduce drug addiction in a society. Lets say science discovers this answer with near certainty. And then both these two people grow to understand this discover, the state of ""is"".  Do you think ought even matters any more? Both people actually agree now on the best way to reduce drug addiction. If the person with the bad strategy understands, through facts and ""is"", that they have the wrong strategy, they will drop it, and the ethical debate is over in every practical sense.  ""ought"" is misleading because almost all people actually want the same things - prosperity for people and themselves. How we get there is an ""is"" mystery. ""ought"" only exists because of uncertainties."

And even if it were true, how does that in-itself make those statements into 'oughts'?  It just means ""I or We want these things"".  I can guarantee you that if you asked a conservative and a liberal about how to combat drug addiction, with data that showed that safe-injection sites were more effective, the conservative would still state that it amounted to breaking a moral principle of not supporting drug abuse.  They might argue that it allowed the addict to get away unpunished, and if they're a libertarian they'd argue that it was an example of fundamental government overreach into matters the government has no right to become involved in.  You seem to be arguing for a version of utilitarianism, where the consequences always justify the action.  However we have no justification for that, and no reason to justify placing the happiness of others as equivalent to our own.  Utilitarianism has always had issues, hedonic calculus is fuzzy, pinpricks somehow add up to torture, and utility monsters justifying genocide.  That's why we have moral philosophy, to examine arguments to see whether they actually fit with our own morality, and whether they ought to be used as a moral decision-making system."

DaystromInstitute,3bfc5r,UtMed,2,Sun Jun 28 20:38:51 2015 UTC,"Well if her role is that of leader - then the philosophical underpinnings of the Borg have a source and a goal that originate from her. Their strategy, their drive to pursue perfection at the expense of the will of others irrespective of the drones lost/gained (as in not caring if they die or not but not so uncaring as to commit to obviously fatal strategies) all originate from the personal psyche of a deranged individual. (At least, deranged as compared to us who value things like free will.)  Now if she's just a manifestation that acts as liaison with other species, as Locutus was employed to be, then things are slightly different.  The collective as a whole had to have received their initial directives from some individual. (Unless the original collective was a race with a hive mind to begin with, and even then it can be argued that the hive mind was the source of the directives, although they're more normal (compared to our values) in this circumstance). But then the collective itself is a mind. The directives of improving the collective by taking the good aspects of alien technologies and physiology would seem to be the base instinct that overrides most everything else. The collective wouldn't need an end goal of perfection, although it has one, to exist. It would just, exist. Philosophy would have no underpinnings except their programed nature. I think in this circumstance, it would just be disregarded as emotional baggage."

Surely the will, goals, and methods of the collective have changed over their centuries (millennia?) of assimilation.    I've always thought that the role of the queen was to act as a focal lens, an allocator if you will, for the wills and desires of the collective.

In the second season TNG episode Unnatural Selection, in an act of (surprisingly unquestioned) eugenics, a group of human wunderkind are genetically engineered by top Starfleet scientists. Among their extraordinary abilities: Telepathy.  It's clear that humanity has some locked-away capacity for telepathy, and that it can be brought out via invasive genetic enhancement. But the events of Unnatural Selection and so many, many, events before it have shown with alarming consistency that bringing these abilities out only causes death and destruction.  For that reason and others, it's possible that Starfleet discontinued attempts to suss out humans susceptible to telepathic ability. Our telepathic strengths were never really pronounced, so it's not impossible that the few humans with any pronounced psychic abilities never passed down that particular genetic trait (for whatever reason, be it the trait's peculiar and potentially inhereditary nature, or simply because the exited human society and better integrated with a more telepathic-compatible culture)."

Since evolution is teleological in Star Trek, the implication seems to be that telepathic ability is a transitional form in the march towards noncorporeal life. In that regard, the Traveler refers to Wes as a ""prodigy."""
DaystromInstitute,3beeyq,Zulban,2,Sun Jun 28 18:41:58 2015 UTC,But yeah he was being manipulated by the traveler. Who knows if he actually had any powers without the traveler bestowing them on him.

DaystromInstitute,3beeyq,thesynod,2,Mon Jun 29 03:31:38 2015 UTC,"""The Chase"" is one example.  Many, many times incorporeal life is encountered, the beings give lip service to the idea that they used to be just like Humans, and that Humans are on the right track to become like them.  The Prophets are said to be ""of Bajor,"" hinting they are the incorporeal descendents of ""present-day"" Bajorans.

The only alterations were falsified captain's logs explaining Vorik and Tuvok's death in a shuttle accident.  The inspection teams were very thorough, and identified telepathic species in the Voyager database first, and then searched the crew manifest for those genetic markers indicative of Vulcan, Betazed or other TP species.  The language was clear in the episode that TP humans did not exist based on the exchanges between the inspector and Janeway.

Also for it to be gradually be upgraded alongside the NX-02 Columbia and more of the NX-class starships.

The Coalition in practice was the loose informal alliance of Vulcans, Andorians, Tellarites and humans we see dealing with the Romulan cloak ship towards the end of Enterprise. The Federation was what was being founded in 'These Are the Voyages...' and was a direct product of that loose coalition."
DaystromInstitute,3bgocc,rliant1864,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:29:56 2015 UTC,"Oh right. I haven't seen that episode of ENT in a long while. I've also decided to order/import from the UK the complete series of Star Trek: Enterprise on Blu-ray before I get TOS (USA Blu) and TNG (UK Blu) next. Give myself a refresher course in everything TOS, TNG, and ENT. Then borrow from friends the DVDs of DS9 and VOY. Do any of the ENT books deal with the continuing voyages of the NX-01 Enterprise which also puts a less Holodeck stance to the Series Finale?"
DaystromInstitute,3bgocc,FremenDar007,2,Mon Jun 29 08:26:57 2015 UTC,"I don't recall how many there were exactly but there are a bunch of post-ENT books that go on about the NX-01's involvement with Romulan Wars, Kobayashi Maru, and how the NX-02 accidentalied the Borg. I need to read them myself sometime. It should be noted that unlike the exceptions with the Abramsverse comics these books are not accepted as canon, but I don't see why they can't fill the canon void during that time period as long as it doesn't contradict canon.  Oh, and I don't know if you can get it in your country (I see you're importing DVD's), but you'll save a bundle on the TV series' with Netflix, which has all of the episodes. They don't have all the movies, though, and TNG, DS9, and Voyager are the 480 VHS masters, even though TOS is the Remastered version in HD (ENT is HD too, of course)."
DaystromInstitute,3bgocc,rliant1864,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:38:32 2015 UTC,"Reading up about it from Memory Alpha it stated there're more than 15 to 20 books. Which chronological order they're supposed to go in I haven't a clue. I do heavily enjoy ENT mainly because I'm a fan of Scott Bakula from Quantum Leap and the premise of a Star Trek show set in just the right moment of the history of the series is poignant. Always wanted to see what events led into the founding of the UFP ever since I became a fan of Star Trek watching the episodes of TOS in syndication when I was a very young kid in the 1980's before TNG was on the air.  Oh no I'll be importing the Blu-rays for ENT and TNG from the UK since they're cheaper than in the USA but I'll be getting TOS all the same on Blu-ray from here in the USA. Since I heavily prefer physical media over streaming. I am heavily considering rejoining Netflix disc rental services. Then possibly renting or borrowing the DVDs of DS9 and VOY. I've never seen TAS yet and plan to eventually, being a fan of all Trek, including the Alternate Reality/Universe movies. Also I love TNG 'Relics' episode."

I can't put my finger on exactly what I don't like about it, all I know is that I when I'm doing a full run-through of Star Trek (second attempt, wish me luck!) I really have to force myself to watch TAS. The only thing quite like that is the first season or two of TNG, where I have to play CK2 or something while I watch because they're just not any fun to watch."
DaystromInstitute,3bgocc,rliant1864,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:37:28 2015 UTC,CK2? Yeah the thing which seems off to me about TAS since researching it on Memory Alpha was one of the main producers or whichever was color-blind. Was the main fault many of the colors and shades seemed off to me while looking at screenshots. But I'm glad it's only 22 episodes at 25 minutes long I take it.  Anyway if I had a random Holodeck program I'd have it go through the evoltion of various bridge technologies. Especially since the TOS movies showed the bridge changing gradually and even more so with the 1701-A. Then into primitive LCARS and even to the 31st century.
DaystromInstitute,3bgocc,FremenDar007,10,Mon Jun 29 09:47:26 2015 UTC,"Note that there were a few Enterprises before the NX-01, including sailing ships, an aircraft carrier, a space shuttle, and some ring-shaped spaceship that's only seen as paintings.

DaystromInstitute,3bgocc,Darth_Rasputin32898,10,Mon Jun 29 01:46:35 2015 UTC,Can't be true. First Contact is said to be a loop in Voyager. Loops are single timeline. And NX-01 was not a Federation ship.
DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,mirror_truth,31,Sat Jun 27 15:54:15 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't necessarily say the Canon needed rewriting. If I were to make a new show, have it set thirty/forty years after Voyager. The next next generation as it were. That way you can have new characters and races, and a completely different universe to the one we know, but still have a sense of continuation. There'd be room for cameos from old cast, but only if the story permitted.  In terms of events that have already happened from our point of view, ie the eugenics wars which occurred in the 90s, either gloss over them or add some clarification. It probably wouldn't be necessary from a story telling point of view."
DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,CiaranC14,14,Sat Jun 27 18:21:33 2015 UTC,IMO this is the best approach.  Any major changes to realign with with modern television and tech can be explained by being 30/40 years after voyager.  I'd like to see the Enterprise come back in whatever duration makes sense with a new crew.  Maybe and older Worf could be the captain since Klingon's can live over 100 years?

If Michael Dorn gets brought in, it ought to be as a recurring support character. Maybe a key character in joint KDF/Starfleet operations, or a diplomat. At this point, the Worf character is old hat, and is grounded in 80's and 90's Trek. TNG, DS9, and the TNG films. That's where it ought to stay, for the most part."

They certainly age faster, if young Alexander is anything to go by - he was about the equivalent of a 16 or 18 year-old Human when he was only 12 years old.    However, there were three Klingons who turned up during DS9, more than 100 years after their original appearances in TOS. Kor, Koloth, and Kang all appeared in DS9's second season episode 'Blood Oath', as the same characters (even the same actors) who appeared in various original series episodes opposite James Kirk. This implies that at least some Klingons can live past 130 years of age.   A top lifespan has never been stated for Humans, but Admiral Leonard McCoy was supposed 137 years old during the launch of the Enterprise-D in TNG's 'Encounter at Farpoint' - and he was definitely looking and acting his age!"

There are no Americans, Africans, or Asians. They are all human. doesn't matter if you were born in France, ""America,"" the moon, or a transport somewhere.

Hoshi Sato was from Japan.   Also, if we're talking about culture, rather than birthplace, Chakotay was Native American, not really ""American""."
DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,Algernon_Asimov,3,Sun Jun 28 01:57:41 2015 UTC,"I see it more as a spectrum than a boundary.  You have the people that I listed who culturally stem from their countries. They have the accents and they appreciate things from their culture in varying levels of stereotype.  Then you have the characters who are known to be from different places but are culturally American - Hoshi and Geordi (Who I forgot about, thanks for reminding me) come under this category.

Have Federation society contrasted with capitalist societies more laid back than the Ferengi but still with class division and unambiguous exploitation.  Embrace human cultural, sexual, racial, etc diversity.  Make the Federation one amongst many equals in terms of power.  By DS9, the Federation is basically in a position to command the quadrant.  Leave more opportunities for the plot to take a turn towards whether to risk war with a sizeable power in order to stand up for Federation principles.  Completely axe all existing alien species so they can start fresh, they're allowed to use a few archetypes (the Borg collective for example), but nothing we've seen before except perhaps as a nod to the original series.  Make them play a more prominent role and have them be more different from humanity both in terms of culture and physiology.  Express their societies as more than a simple monoculture, have ways to make humans seem genuinely flippant to some of these alternative cultures so that it isn't always ""haha look at those aliens, so crazy with their strange behaviours"" and instead dude why did you do that, they were just minding their own business!?!"
DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,willbell,2,Sat Jun 27 21:21:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's entirely necessary to axe all existing alien species to 'clear the way'. For starters, you'd have to come up with a reason why you're not seeing a lot of Romulans or Klingons in play. . .unless the whole thing gets the Voyager treatment and is set somewhere else entirely, you're gonna have to involve them in some way.  A better approach, as someone else suggested, is to simply advance the timeline by 40-50 years (if not more). There's basically a 100 year gap between the end of the TOS series and the beginning of the TNG series. The TOS films 'stop' at 2293 with Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country, and even that still leaves a big 70 year gap. That's enough time for 2 generations of Starfleet officers to have served and retired. It clears the way for any wholesale changes to the structure while keeping the older canon intact. You can keep older species in play, if only in the background, and introduce new species that present new challenges or new allies."
DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,TimeZarg,5,Sun Jun 28 01:28:28 2015 UTC,"We're not beholden to canon according to the OP, and I think we can do better than ""ridged ones who like fighting"", ""pointy eared ones that like logic"", and ""pointy eared ones that are sneaky"" as our triad of famous species.  Not to denigrate how successfully they've been used, especially in DS9, but their place could be taken by something new and even more alien."
DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,willbell,2,Sun Jun 28 02:15:00 2015 UTC,"Also, species and relationships between species can change over a few decades - such as the Klingons, who were antagonists during the TOS era, becoming allies by the TNG era."
DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,Algernon_Asimov,3,Sun Jun 28 01:50:00 2015 UTC,Exactly. You could even come up with some sort of massive series of incidents that resulted in the Klingon Empire joining the Federation. You could bring the Xindi back into play. Or just come up with completely new species. . .maybe a species of cyborgs that aren't cartoonishly 'evil' like the Borg.
DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,TimeZarg,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:12:51 2015 UTC,"I agree that a whole suite of new species would make sense if there was another jump forward in time from the TNG/DS9/VOY period. In Enterprise, they were mainly dealing with species of the nearby planets, as they only had limited warp capability (up to Warp 5). Between ENT and TOS, there was a large change in the species encountered, likely due to increased warp capability and having already explored nearby space. The relationships between species of course changed again between TOS and TNG, with alliances changing and coming across new allies/enemies. So the new series could have Federation Space expanded, maybe having a collection of Deep Deep Space Stations, with places like DS9 now in considered close-ish to Earth. That would allow for a series of bases for a new ship to return to for supplies, maybe to swap out crew members, and could mean that the the ship didn't need to return to Earth. It could be set on the opposite side of Federation Space to Bajor/Cardassia, or be in that general part of space, but that area of space to be stable (either with an agreement to stay out of each others hair or of friendship).  I like the idea of including the children of our favourite characters in the previous show, such as Molly O'Brien, Tom and B'Elanna's daughter or Alexander. I thought it was great how the the crew of TNG fanboyed/fangirled over the TOS crew, as did the DS9 crew in Trials and Tribble-ations. There could still be references, cameos and time travel to include past crew, but it shouldn't be more."

Generally slower with more encounters with uninhabitable planets with unbreathable atmosphere.  I'm rewatching voyager, and having more tension surrounding survival and gathering supplies would be a nice constant reminder as to the difficulties in space.   Also more issues with time synchronization would be good,  to enhance the costs to the members of the crew as to exactly how difficult their missions are.   Warp needs to be refined so that either warp 10 is maximum, or they have warp and transwarp that are pretty much different things.  The reality of storing component materials for operating the replicators would be nice to experience, so fewer replicators with more priority given to important uses would be interesting.   Transporters also need to be less magical somehow.  Either make it known people are killed and recreated in an instant, or create a supporting energy conduit that projects the molecular matrix of a person so that people are not completely disintegrated with every use.   Possibly add a new dimension with intergalactic travel to other galaxies through some device.  This would allow some less humanoid experiences as well.   Just a few thoughts,  hope those are interesting ideas.!"

The TNG Technical Manual (p.103) describes the process thus:     Matter stream transmission. The actual point of departure from the ship is one of seventeen emitter pad arrays that transmit the matter stream within an annular confinement beam to the transport destination.      There's your supporting energy conduit: the annular confinement beam."
DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,Algernon_Asimov,2,Sat Jun 27 21:41:27 2015 UTC,Oh that's perfect.  Now they just need to keep the descriptions of the process consistent to that to keep plot points from pretending it isn't that.
DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,cjazz108,0,Mon Jun 29 08:03:43 2015 UTC,"I think they meant more acknowledging that transporting involves killing the person, and recreating an identical version of them somewhere else."
DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,Justice_Prince,7,Sun Jun 28 01:07:36 2015 UTC,"Either make it known people are killed and recreated in an instant, or create a supporting energy conduit that projects the molecular matrix of a person   They want the writers of this hypothetical Star Trek show to do one of two things: acknowledge the killing and recreation of a person in the transporter, or explain that a person is not killed and recreated by creating some technobabble explanation, such as a supporting energy conduit that projects the molecular matrix.   This supporting energy conduit has already been ""invented"" and has been part of the design of a transporter since at least the fourth season of TNG (the year the TNG Technical Manual was published). So there's no need to acknowledge that people get killed, because their matter actually gets projected via a supported energy conduit."
DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,Algernon_Asimov,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:20:03 2015 UTC,it sounded more like they were saying to replace teleportation with projected holograms rather then just writing off teleportation with technobable.
DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,Justice_Prince,4,Sun Jun 28 01:59:29 2015 UTC,"A hologram wouldn't include ""the molecular matrix of a person"". It would just be like that holographic communicator which was shown once and only once, in DS9's 'For the Uniform': an image only."
DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,Algernon_Asimov,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:02:52 2015 UTC,What ever you want to call it it sounds like they were saying that a physical representation of the person is teleported down so the real person could virtually explore from the safety of their own ship without going anywhere.

DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,kimcapnr,17,Sat Jun 27 18:49:18 2015 UTC,On the contrary; I think forcing the writers to think more carefully about the technology they're using would be just the kind of constraint needed to come up with better stories.

DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,IMADV8,8,Sat Jun 27 22:56:00 2015 UTC,Because no one's ever told a good hard sci fi story before?
DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,fiiiiiine,2,Sat Jun 27 23:32:48 2015 UTC,"The idea is to slow down the magical technology fixes because the star trek universe is almost to the point of having solved all of humanities problems.   It makes space conflicts petty because we have everything we need,  and characters almost don't have enough opportunity to struggle.   I'd like a star trek that went back to more of the risk of space as a fairly inherently dangerous place.  The replicators running out of materials would enforce searching out inhospitable world's and atmospheres.   Basically,  I'd like a touch of alien or interstellar back in the series,  because we've basically proven that the timeline aren't remotely possible anymore.  I need it to be more relatable to where we are in reality to get that visceral connection to my personal experience now.   Otherwise it becomes just another ray gun,  fluffy dream reality,  which the TOS didn't feel like to me."
DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,cjazz108,11,Mon Jun 29 08:17:22 2015 UTC,"I'll stick with the premise that I have to adapt Trek to modern audiences as a thought experiment. Let's pretend this is happening one way or another regardless of ""my"" help, and this is an opportunity to try to keep Trek Trek-like. My solution is basically to reach into existing canon, because why else is it Star Trek, and try to work with it.  For one thing, the negative aspects of the Federation need to be pushed to the front alongside the positives. The Federation has some very hard lines about genetic engineering due to Earth's traumatic history, lines which also apply to cloning and artificial intelligences. Starfleet itself has no shortage of skeptics who consider beings like Data non-living. We don't need to make these glaring, seething strains on society in the Federation, but there's plenty of room for these issues to be used to address modern issues in genetics, AI advancement and cybernetics, alongside more down to earth issues like how wrapped up people can get in things like facebook with a feed sent right to their pocket. You don't need some alien of the week for this either; you could have the difference there right from the start, with older crewmembers wigged out by a sizeable number of younger crewmembers who make use of cybernetics more readily. That is - it's easier for people to accept different cultures when ""strange new worlds and new lifeforms"" are outside of home, but what happens when home is changing in strange new ways and it honestly conflicts with what some people sincerely believe?  Aliens too can't be monolithic cultures. I don't think you necessarily need to examine everything fully in-depth (some mystery is good and lore for the sake of lore bogs down a script), but you could have Klingons from different regions with subtly different perspectives - maybe in one area, they tend to discourage cloaking devices but are also ruthless in war, while in another area, cloaking devices are fully encouraged, but there's also a warrior code that is adhered to religiously. All these disparate regional cultures contributes to the Klingon civil wars, violent means of replacing an officer, and strained resources.  More alien aliens. We can definitely keep a lot of iconic humanoids with little more than some extra refining of their makeup, but humanoid life needn't be the majority lifeform anymore, especially with CGI. Not that Trek didn't do different lifeforms before (I love muckmen like the Sheliak), but it can be diversified to all kinds of weird areas, even as simply as bringing back Erix race from The Animated Series (a three legged, three armed race).  As for structure, long term story arcs with support from both dedicated episodes and bottle stories that aren't wholly ignored after."
DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,Berggeist,6,Sat Jun 27 22:14:07 2015 UTC,"OK - Here are my thoughts. If anyone disagrees with anything, I'd love to hear your input.  There is no real structure to this, I'm just typing as I think of more things.   The show should center around Robert April on the Enterprise NCC-1701. This means that while it can be set in a similar time to TOS, there won't be a rehash of the same characters. I'm not sure if Spock served with Cptn April, but let's say he didn't. It should tell it's story in a similar way to Enterprise at it's good parts. By this I mean there should be a lot of talking with moral dilemmas and allegory as well as a fair share of action and proper exploration. I won't get into my thoughts on Enterprise but if it stayed as good as it was at its best, the Trek landscape would have been very different. The Enterprise should look like a mix between the Refit and the Nu-Trek ship (To the correct scale, of course). While I like Nu-Trek's uniforms, they should look more TOS while still staying modern looking. Maybe something like this, although with less of the biker look. I'd also add rank pips instead of bands. It makes it easier to distinguish rank on screen. Enlisted crewmen! Officers should be kept to department heads and bridge officers. Keep all-powerful beings to a minimum. That is something that really annoyed me with TOS. It should work like Voyager or Enterprise where every new species they met were similarly advanced. Keep the evil admiral trope to a minimum. The Enterprise should have a lot of alien crew members. I think Vulcans should be used sparingly though. I would include Andorians, Bolians, maybe some non-federation species like Orions - species that there can be a lot of without going massively over budget. Enterprise did this well. Depending on the away-mission, crewmen should be wearing different things. As high-tech as they claim their uniforms to be, I doubt they would be comfortable wearing it in a desert. Lastly: Have the main cast make lasting relationships with different characters. I'm thinking along the lines of DS9 where, although they weren't main cast members, characters like Nog and Garek were always present and had relationships with the others. I think the closest we got to this outside of DS9 was with Barkley who was his own character and not a generic crewman."
DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,SpocksBrainLLAP,3,Sat Jun 27 16:39:13 2015 UTC,"About the different species thing. While certainly possible it wouldn't be very comfy for an Andorian on a Human/Vulcan ship. Certainly endurable for some time, but you wouldn't sign up for a 5 year assignment to a 50 degree Celsius (Indoor temperature) environment."
DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,Hellstrike,2,Sat Jun 27 17:21:35 2015 UTC,"I know this contradicts my thing about uniforms, but don't starfleet uniforms regulate body temperature?  Also, the average room temperature is about 23°C, which I would assume the temp on the Enterprise to be. According to Memory Alpha, the Andorians live underground and harness energy from geothermal activity. While it would still be cold down there I can't see it as being below 0°C  Edit: Also, in the same vain, Vulcans live on a desert world and they are comfortable on human starships."

They prevent grey goo catastrophes on board. In an emergency, the chief of engineering wants to put themselves in danger to fix a problem faster, but the chief of automation is against human risk and wants to send in a (at times) slightly less capable robot. Geordi can see well beyond the visible spectrum. And Star Trek tech and body enhancements allows for things like weak mind reading, super strength, converting light to food-like energy, sexual stuff, etc. I imagine there's a lot of plot possibilities for parents to enhance their kids perceptual range at birth. Or a crewmember who really went to town on their body with enhancements. Sometimes this helps, sometimes they run into trouble. Some people don't like it because it reminds them of the borg. Encryption and security protocols. It's upsetting how many times an invader or escapee just hops on a bridge or ship and takes full control. Yes it's required for plot, but I actually see this as a missed opportunity for characters to overcome security challenges. This is a funny scene but I thought it was really interesting to see an example on screen of how data handles security issues."

And we'd have stories about meaningful things relevant to the human condition.  We'd spend less time dwelling on people for the sake of dwelling on them. We don't care about Kirk or Picard because it's Kirk or Picard. We cared about them because they were interesting and different from the folks most of us encounter daily, and especially because they were unapologetic in representing a specific moral point of view."
DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,aquanext,3,Sat Jun 27 20:52:18 2015 UTC,"Instead of wiping the Canon, I would do TNG era in Abramsverse. Largely keep the same themes, but use technobabble to make sure two big things can't happen in this timeline.    No time travel. Time travel creates a mess of plot issues that close off potential story development. We saw this in the end of Voyager and the run of Enterprise. The latest canon in the prime timeline was approaching Doctor Who levels of technology, which was straying too far from the relatable themes of Star Trek. Let's say that the events of Abrams' Star Trek caused irreparable damage to the temporal fabric of the Galaxy, making time travel near impossible. No Q. This may be hard to accept, since he was so important to our TNG era, but he presents similar problems that close off avenues of plot development. Removing Q makes a few things more interesting. The most important of which is a looming threat of the Borg. Current fans know they're out there (like book readers watching Game of Thrones) and subtle hints can be dropped starting in the second season, but they don't appear until much later. No Q also means that we can take a different approach to the ""ultimate fate of humanity"" and have spinoffs that can expand into intergalactic exploration. Let's say that the same temporal damage that prevents time travel also makes this timeline inaccessible to the Q continuum.    These two plot elements create a glass ceiling to what the future can hold, which destroys Star Trek's ability to be timeless. If we want Star Trek to continue to exist for generations, this kind of element must be avoided. Abramsverse gives us that opportunity without completely disregarding the original timeline. As long as the references to the prime timeline remain tasteful and limited (unlike Into Darkness), we should be able to create a new Star Trek series that will do well and last a long time."

I really enjoy Star Trek but feel that these detract from its timelessness due to the fact that a lot of their inspiration were 1960's fantasies which were never thoughtfully re-imagined in the Trek universe with the exception of portions of Enterprise.   In avoiding quirks like Tom Paris obsessing with the 20th century thereby dating Voyager, Star Trek could tackle much deeper themes and not be totally driven by the viewpoint of a particular time."
DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,alnarra,2,Sat Jun 27 18:47:43 2015 UTC,"Don't axe a thing, leave the cannon intact, in large part it's fine. except for blowing up Romulus, but I think that's just because I'm really bothered by the fact that we decided on a whim to blow up Space China just so we could have a shallow character.   No I want a Star Trek set... a little bit in the future, where we are exploring new galaxies thanks to the advances in Transwarp Technology that Voyager has brought back, that Federation Technology has gone through some serious updates thanks to the no doubt massive amount of information that Voyager Collected. Have new races for the Federation to Find, New Enemies, that it's more then just the Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Gamma Quadrant, that we are talking about.   Make a Star Trek that explores current Social, Political, and technological issues and ensure that it's syndicated so that what happened with Voyager and Enterprise can never happen again. Star Trek can't be on a tight chain if it's going to accomplish what it needs to.. to be a vision of an optimistic future. That has to be absolutely key, without that it is little more then just another piece of Science Fiction.   The Writers, Directors, etc. all need to be on Board with at the very least a vision of the future that isn't just a chance to make action schlock. That's not to say that we shouldn't explore the darkness of humanity, the war that Deep Space 9 truly got to engross itself in.   I think the cast and Crew should be diverse, and quite Frankly we Need a Muslim or middle eastern individual, and Indian (From India), a transgender individual or LGBT individual that is clear on screen. Star Trek has the luxury of being one of those shows that you very much should purposely stack the cast and crew in such a way. Issues of the modern socio-politcal paradigm from Classism to Privacy should all be addressed and looked at.   The writing staff would need to beyond top notch, and consultants from every field should be brought in so that the issues Star Trek does choose to touch on are handled with gravitas and understanding, not just a shallow view. They shouldn't have to deal with copyrights from episode to episode preventing real stories from being built.   We should look at what worked, and aim to be making the Modern Day Measure of a Man, Inner Light, or Beyond the Stars.   Star Trek's Canon is fine, it works well as a Universe to build from because it is so easily infinite, and you can update the Technology with simple explanations. What is important is to make sure the folks writing it / directing it / producing it all realize what it is they are making, that they understand /why/ Star Trek is important, WHY it has touched so many"
DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,philwelch,2,Sat Jun 27 19:07:18 2015 UTC,"I love this idea. I think there's a lot of room to refresh the essence of Star Trek by jettisoning the nitty-gritty details of the original continuity and correcting mistaken or outdated story decisions while maintaining the essence of the franchise.  There are a number of essential elements, in terms of theme, setting, and visuals, that I don't think you could get away with abandoning:   First and foremost, Star Trek's optimistic, utopian vision of the future is essential. The Federation can be a little too perfect sometimes, but Earth, at the very least, needs to be essentially free of poverty and crime. At some point, the Federation, Klingons and Romulans all need to appear and be recognizable as themselves. The story takes place at least 200 years in the future. I don't think you could have a Star Trek without warp drive, phasers, photon torpedoes, transporters, shields, and the famously vague and unspecified ""sensors"". Many of these technologies make zero scientific sense, but if we abandon them, it might as well not even be Star Trek.   The most enduring story premise, and the best one for a reboot, would be the voyages of the Enterprise. I don't think it's actually that essential to reuse any particular characters. The Abrams films prove that they're nearly impossible to recast, and the success of TNG shows that the basic premise and setting of Star Trek doesn't rely on any specific characters as much as it relies on a cast of characters who fit together and function as a team. For instance, Spock and McCoy serving as the voices of reason and emotion, with Kirk finding the balance in between, or the more sophisticated interactions of the TNG cast (Worf, the voice of caution; Data, literally the voice of data-driven logical analysis; Troi, the empathic, intuitive judge of character; all providing input to Riker and Picard, who themselves act as a team, with Picard making the big, important decisions from a thoughtful and considered standpoint while Riker makes the more immediate and lower level decisions.)  What are the opportunities of starting over with a fresh continuity? For one, you get to set aside all of the small details and continuity contradictions and tensions that accumulate over time and make it more and more difficult to write a story that takes place in the universe. But I think there are a lot of existing points that can be simplified or redone. For instance, it doesn't really make sense to have the Eugenics Wars take place in the 1990's anymore. I would explicitly combine them with World War III and push them forward to around 2100."
DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,eternallylearning,2,Sun Jun 28 14:52:52 2015 UTC,"I'll try to expand my thoughts more later, but initially I'm thinking the only real thing I'd change would be to develop an actual, full backstory that fits with the world as it is now.  I'm thinking something akin to how George RR Martin or Tolkein developed the entire world and history of their books before they wrote word one (well, except for the Hobbit).  This way the Star Trek universe could have a sense of internal consistency that I think has always been lacking in every series.  Keep in mind, I'm not saying every little detail needs to be fleshed out, but major milestones should be.  For instance: Enterprise would be boiled down to the Vulcan involvement in the Warp 5 engine, their exploration happened leading to the first meetings with several new species, the Xindi attack and failed  attack, and the signing of the Federation charter.  Basic milestones, but enough left open so that stories could be written around it without spoiling anything.    This would mean that if the series were to be completely recreated in the order they were originally, ToS could simply make references to Archer, the NX-01, the Xindi, etc, but we the viewer would only know the history by those references.  Also, the Enterpise Ds conference room wall would be accurate, the Xindi attack could be referenced as the Borg approach in Best of Both worlds and so on.  It wouldn't have to be laid on thick or anything, it'd just provide a backbone for natural world building that I think was sorely lacking in all the series.  It also be great to have the writers know how the Universe worked such as average Federation lives, politics, and so on."
DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,rextraverse,4,Mon Jun 29 02:20:04 2015 UTC,"they also want to see changes made to the canon, to modernize Star Trek, while maintaining its core philosophy.   This may seem a very absolutist viewpoint, but I don't think you need or want to pussyfoot on the issue of canon.  If you want to make minor changes and small adjustments, respect the existing canon.  However, if we want to approach a new series that is ""not beholden to existing canon"", then whomever is in charge should go all out - Ron Moore BSG-style and do a full reimagining of Trek.  I know other responses have already pointed some of these out, but in a full reimagining, here's a few things I'd like to see:   Either eliminate or explain the rationale behind why pretty much every other alien society is a monoculture. Reduce or eliminate the number of omnipotent, God-like beings in Trek.  Q was a great foil for Picard and the TNG crew and the Prophets certainly served their purpose as real-world Gods to the Bajoran people.  I don't think Trek would lose much by eliminating Q from existance.  Also, I can accept that the Prophets are transdimensional life forms, existing outside our understanding of linear time.  Why that gave them the power to return Akorem to the past while maintaining our future or push an entire Dominion fleet out of existance, not so much. Eliminate the number of blatantly human-influenced alien species and planets in Trek.  I don't think Trek needs a planet of Chicago gangsters, a planet of Yankees and Communists fighting over the US Constitution and Jesus as the Son of God, a planet of the American Old West, etc. Dirty it up.  This is one area where I think JJ got it right.  It's fine if you want the bridge and the public corridors of a starship to look ridiculously perfect.  But an industrial warehouse or the engine room of the same starship?  I think you're expecting an unrealistically perfect version of humanity.  Even in the Prime timeline, we know that humans are not perfect - O'Brien is a great example - but the message is that we strive to better ourselves and the rest of humanity. Dramatically reduce the use of the holodeck.  More of an issue for TV than movies, but come on.  These individuals went through incredible amounts of training the opportunity to be out discovering new worlds and new civilizations, going boldly where no man has gone before.  And it's still not interesting enough, so they spend their recreational time playing around in V-world. Clean up the use of terminology.  Star system vs solar system.  Quake vs earthquake.  Interplanetary vs interstellar vs intergalactic.  And let's use units of distance that actually make sense for interstellar space travel (ie- a petameter is roughly 0.1 LY.  Seems like it would make more sense than continuing to use kilometers or miles)   One thing I don't think current Trek or a reimagined Trek needs is a reorientation of the timeline.  The Eugenics Wars occurred in the 1990s.  That's fine.  Trek shows us an optimistic future for ourselves, but it doesn't need to hew to events in our timeline.  That a Starfleet crew in a stolen, cloaked Klingon BoP didn't actually land in the San Francisco Presidio in 1987 to save a pair of humpbacked whales from an aquarium in Sausalito that doesn't exist in our timeline but looks an awful lot like an aquarium in Monterey doesn't bother me."

On cargo haulers and Klingon vessels absolutely but on vessels with disciplined paramilitary or miltary crew (e.g. Cardassian, Romulan, Starfleet), no.

This does not mean they are without conflict.

I would love to see an episode where they mount phasers on the drones and defeat an enemy ship with swarm tactics. I think they should also have some sort of flying drone on away missions to scout the area and be an advanced warning system. Also a camera drone to follow them on missions in case something happens.   In other things data wouldn't be treated like a written file, I.e. if I steal your library, I copied it, you still have it though.  I'd also really like to see more exploration of mechanical implants and gene modification.

I would do a ""soft reboot"" by time jump 20-30 years (kind of like how TNG did with their more like 80-year jump).  New ship, new crew, possibly exploring the other side of Romulan space post-Hobus Incident (so we're in the Prime universe). This would better enable the prop/set designers and the writers to imaging a future based on today's tech (which already makes a lot of TNG look out-dated despite ostensibly being ""future-tech"").  We could go back to Phaser designs where they look like guns. Explore the LCARS network a little more, maybe make it closer to the Internet in terms of how it works (ie: if something isn't in the ship's database, it can establish a sub-space link to some other database and request/download the data). Revisit Section 31 (as it was always fun from the perspective of exploring ethics). Maybe have the crew be a mix of Federation, Klingon, Romulan Republic (one of the Romulan Governments that pops up after Hobus), and Cardassian so that old prejudices and personal conflicts can come into play early on as these groups learn to work more closely towards some common goal (exploration of some area of interest).  We can even show some respect to 90s Trek by having Worf, the Rikers (Will & Deanna or even Thomas), Geordi, Wesley, and/or Data/B4 guest star occasionally. Maybe Geordi and Wesley worked together to design & build this new ship (based on some new Warp Engine concept) and we see them at the Christening ceremony in the Pilot? This would actually be pretty appealing. New viewers that don't know those characters wouldn't be super confused about why these people being there is a big deal (they did design and build the ship), and older viewers will appreciate seeing ""old friends"" again.  I would suggest maybe switching to a more serialized 13-episode format (used by many cable networks and Netflix), but Star Trek was one of those shows that was sometimes enhanced by the ""filler"" episodes (to the point where they developed and sometimes even subverted their own tropes). So I would keep the 22-26 episode format and just do a better job of planning ""filler"" episodes (we did ""Holodeck gone-wrong last season, so let's do an ""A Day in the Life of some previously nameless crewman"" instead)."
DaystromInstitute,3bb9qo,9vDzLB0vIlHK,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:55:19 2015 UTC,"I'm late, but here's my two cents, FWIW. TL;DR All I need is for the future to not be like the present, and for it to be well-written.  First, I'd like some confirmation that human society has changed in the intervening time, both from internal pressures and from interaction with other planets.   It doesn't have to be progress as I'd define it, but I want to see some change in Terran society.  TOS started this with wider representation on the bridge, but it seems like this stalled on TNG-era shows and then went backwards on ENT.  Are women really still taking their husbands' surnames in the 23rd century, like Keiko O'Brien?  Are there really no LGBT people in the future?  TOS gave us post-scarcity, but we really don't know that much about the economics of the future.  Is there capitalism after scarcity? How would that work?  If it doesn't, what replaces it?  Even in the TNG-era, Starfleet seems awfully Terran.  Was Azetbur right when she said that the Federation is a homo sapiens only club?  And has that changed?  Are planetary-scale cultures really monolithic?  Would Terrans really dominate Starfleet, and what does that say about the Federation?  Second, over time I've slowly come to the conclusion that everything I just said is probably wrong, and that I would watch just about any show set in the Trekiverse as long as it's well written and well executed.  Some of the best and worst episodes of Star Trek were the best or the worst because of how they were written and executed.  One of my favorite episodes of TOS is 'Doomsday Machine', which doesn't fit into a story arc, isn't progressive at all in terms of representation, and could easily be seen as an allegory for contemporary politics.  But it was so well written, so well acted, so well scored, that I loved it when I first watched it and I love it now.  'Threshold' was a terrible episode of VOY for lots of reasons, but mostly, IMHO, because it took a grand concept and tried to make it a one-off episode from which we'd derive no larger meaning or consequence.  All I really want is good stories told well."

Starfleet lost 40 ships and (according to ""The Drumhead"") 11,000 lives at Wolf 359, which by the standards of the Dominion War seems to have been a fairly typical battle in terms of size of the engagement (on a related note: Shelby says, at the end of ""Best of Both Worlds,"" that the losses at Wolf 359 would be replaced in less than a year, which is kind of hard to believe at first, but certainly Starfleet seems to be churning out ships and crew during the Dominion War. I can believe replacing the ships, but Starfleet's training program seems to be relatively small, with just the Academy and maybe some annex campuses to it training officers. Perhaps there is an OCS system in place). And that's only on the space-side of things. Ground combat in the 24th Century is never really examined in detail, but I'd say it's either extremely small engagements (kind of borne out by ""Siege of AR-558""?) or else a complete fucking slaughter from space-borne weapons. We know the Cardassians lost an entire Order to the Klingons at one point, on a random world (that's what spurred Damar into rebellion), and presumably that was a lot.  Bashir and Co. in ""Statistical Probabilities"" estimate total losses from the war in the hundreds of billions (and their alternative of giving Federation strategic plans to the Dominion projects ""only"" two billion casualties). It's not clear if those are total losses or just the Federation, though (well the ""two billion"" part is explicitly just the Federation). That's pretty insane, but it makes sense if you figure that the Dominion was employing orbital bombardment tactics on targeted worlds. That fits with Weyoun's plan, in ""Sacrifice of Angels,"" to ""eradicate"" Earth's population.  So I don't think there's ever any real estimate of casualties in the war given. Most of the war seems to have been fought either on Federation or Cardassian planets, so those would certainly have the highest civilian casualties. The Klingons seem to have suffered extreme damage to the KDF (hence Sloan's point that they wouldn't be a threat to anyone for another decade, though that could be that their industrial capacity was in poorer shape than the industry of the Federation or Romulans), but it doesn't seem like they faced any Dominion invasions. The Romulans don't seem to have faced such an invasion, either (even if the Dominion really did plan on invading Romulan territory, they never got around to it before the Romulans declared war).  In any case, if the Dominion really was targeting civilian population centers as they did against Cardassia and planned to do against Earth, then deaths in the billions or tens of billions is entirely believable. Losses for military personnel are difficult to estimate, but in the very least it would be in the hundreds of thousands for Starfleet alone."

DaystromInstitute,3bc0xh,TooMuchButtHair,3,Sun Jun 28 13:18:52 2015 UTC,"I wonder what the real cost of Operation Return really was. Before the arrival of the Klingons, it seemed like the Federation and Dominion were headed for mutual annihilation. We do know that as a result of the battle (and the subsequent loss of 2,800 Dominion ships) that the Dominion fleet fell back significantly, but what did it do to Starfleet? How much did the loss of the ships in that battle affect combat operations for the next several months? The next year?  We don't see any system-level invasions by Starfleet for the remainder of the season/year. That could be due in large part to the losses sustained as a result of that absolutely massive battle. We also hear about how bad the war is from Sisko. It's going so poorly at one point he pulled a major stunt to get the Romulan Star Empire into the war. Could the losses as a result of Operation Return contributed to the Desperation behind Sisko's actions?"
DaystromInstitute,3bc0xh,zuludown888,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:19:53 2015 UTC,"Of the approximately 600 Federation ships and probably 50 or so Klingon ships that broke the Dominion's flank towards the end of the battle, only 200 were capable of advancing on DS9 once the main engagement was finished.  The problem was that after retaking DS9, the Federation and Klingons didn't immediately go on the offensive.  The Dominion offered to open peace talks, a ploy that the Federation bought hook, line and sinker, but their goal was to forestall any sort of offensive in order to rebuild their forces.  Once the talks stalled, the Dominion went right back on the offensive and were winning on every front.  The losses of Operation Return and following the failed peace talks definitely played a role in getting Sisko to do what he did to get the Romulans in the war.  If he hadn't, the offensive into Cardassian space never would have been possible and odds are that the Dominion would have taken Earth within the year."
DaystromInstitute,3bc0xh,disposable_pants,7,Mon Jun 29 02:19:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the 11th Order had half a million men on Septimus III, all of whom were killed by the Klingons"
DaystromInstitute,3bc0xh,zuludown888,4,Sat Jun 27 21:32:20 2015 UTC,"Thank you for such a great response. I suppose one could extrapolate, based on an average crew complement and typical Federation fleet sizes, a rough estimate of how many Starfleet personnel were killed."
DaystromInstitute,3bc0xh,jbcatalyst2,3,Sat Jun 27 23:31:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe. I mean we don't know much about what Starfleet looks like, as far as ships go. I guess you could estimate purely based on what we've seen on screen, but even that might be difficult.  I think, based on the numbers being thrown around in ""Statistical Probabilities,"" that by far the war's cost fell on the civilian side of things (I doubt that Starfleet numbers in the billions). So even if, as /u/Staringintotheabyss0 points out, we're looking at hundreds of ships (and so many thousands of lives) being lost in major engagements, and then huge numbers in small skirmishes (as ""In the Pale Moonlight"" would indicate), it would be a proverbial drop in the bucket compared to the civilian death toll (historically, that would be accurate as well). For what it's worth, the few glimpses we get (or stories we hear) about Jem'Hadar operating in the Gamma Quadrant paint a very bloody picture of the way they deal with civilian populations."
DaystromInstitute,3bc0xh,TooMuchButtHair,4,Sun Jun 28 04:09:54 2015 UTC,"I can believe replacing the ships, but Starfleet's training program seems to be relatively small, with just the Academy and maybe some annex campuses to it training officers. Perhaps there is an OCS system in place).   Does everyone in Starfleet go to the Academy, though, or is that just for potential officers?  If I'm just a crewman, do I go?   We know the Cardassians lost an entire Order to the Klingons at one point, on a random world (that's what spurred Damar into rebellion), and presumably that was a lot.   I believe the figure was quoted as 500,000 lost."
DaystromInstitute,3bc0xh,TooMuchButtHair,6,Sun Jun 28 18:53:24 2015 UTC,"Does everyone in Starfleet go to the Academy, though, or is that just for potential officers?   So, in ""Trials and Tribbleations,"" Bashir implies that O'Brien went to the Academy and took a ""Temporal Mechanics"" class, but Ronald Moore has said this was simply a mistake and suggested that it could be rationalized as an enlisted training program (why he would take temporal mechanics classes is another matter, I suppose). This would fit with an explicit reference to an enlisted training program at the Academy made in ""The Drumhead:"" Simon Tarses says that he was at the Academy for just such a training program.  It's worth noting that, until ""Family,"" it was unclear if there was any such thing as a distinction between ""officers"" and ""enlisted"" personnel in Starfleet. Only after that point are there clearly enlisted crewmen. For an interesting discussion of the distinction and its history, see this topic from several weeks ago.  We don't really know what the ratio of enlisted personnel to officers is, or exactly how long their initial training takes. We also don't know where it takes place, other than at least some training taking place at the Academy on Earth."
DaystromInstitute,3bc0xh,jonnyta,3,Sun Jun 28 19:09:40 2015 UTC,"Crewman don't go to the Academy, they're the enlisted portion of Starfleet. I'm not sure where crewmen actually go to train, though; I'm gonna hazard a guess that Starfleet training for crewmen is about the same for enlisted: bootcamps throughout the United States to train enlisted, then Advanced Schools, where they learn their specialty (medical, infantry, logistics, etc.) For a question for everyone else, is the Academy the only way to become an officer? Or is it pretty much Starfleet's version of the Naval Academy, and other potential officers go through a version of ROTC or Officer Training School?"
DaystromInstitute,3bc0xh,74159637895123,2,Sun Jun 28 19:15:45 2015 UTC,"That was only for the number of Cardiassian's killed. We can imagine that the Klingons suffered fair losses themselves (though probably not on the order of 500,000)."
DaystromInstitute,3bc0xh,Morinaka,2,Sun Jun 28 23:58:13 2015 UTC,"In the episode, In the Pale Moonlight there is mention of a weekly casualty report. Based on that, 2,000 per week seems to be about what Starfleet experienced during weeks where we aren't aware of any major operations. At a minimum, that puts Federation losses at around 100K. I would imagine that during major engagements that number could increase quite drastically, especially toward the end of the war.  Let's also not forget the casualties sustained by the Dominion-instigated invasion of Cardassia, and the resulting Klingon-Federation conflict. There were plenty of casualties as a result of the Dominion's actions long before they sent ships into the Alpha Quadrant."

While the ultimate effect was brutal tonal whiplash, I can see how it would seem fun on-paper to end the grim sour-faced Xindi arc with a big flashing sign that says ""We're doing wacky stuff again!"".  But really, it all boils down to hinging everything around that gag. And everything suffered because of it. It tried to give a magnanimous close to the arc that the show had been building since it's very pilot (it gives Silik a noble death and final exchange with Archer a la Balance of Terror, it makes a big show of Daniels dying/not-dying and giving a great big in-the-middle-of-a-CG-effect goodbye), but it also has to work in all this blue Nazi nonsense.  While I agree that, in hindsight, it introduces the theme of fighting against eugenicists, I can't help but feel like that's a happy coincidence rather than a planned thematic connection."

DaystromInstitute,3b8prl,deuZige,4,Sat Jun 27 12:49:16 2015 UTC,"I like this idea a lot - that the space Nazis as the season opener were a kind of thematic 'mission statement' for Season Four. You make a lot of great points about how subsequent episodes/arcs tie into this theme.  To continue your thought exercise a little, I'd suggest that the Mirror Universe episodes actually fit really well with your idea: they feature an obviously fascist version of the Federation, and there's also a clear parallel to the idea of racial purity, as Humans have the upper hand and oppress a variety of 'slave species.'"

DaystromInstitute,3b8nsh,BonzoTheBoss,3,Sat Jun 27 01:16:41 2015 UTC,"I can see why the writers went in that direction, but I don't really agree with it. It makes sense that 8472 would be terrified of the Federation after encountering Voyager. The Borg, supposedly the most powerful race in the galaxy, barely gave them pause but this one tiny ship from the Federation was able to repel them. Keeping in mind nothing else lives in their galaxy/universe, it would give them a very narrow perspective about other sapient species. As far as they're concerned the Federation has ALL of their ships equipped with nano-torpedoes.  HOWEVER, I thought the underlying point og 8472 was sort ""unstoppable force meets immovable object"". The Borg, aforementioned boogey-man of the galaxy, meets a species as virulent, powerful and stubborn as their own and for the first time in Q knows how long they're being beaten. I don't mean Milky Way species defeating single cubes a la Best of Both Worlds defeat, but full on extinction level event beaten.  Having 8472 come back all humanoid and squishy and ready to talk flies in the face of everything established about their mentality."
DaystromInstitute,3b8nsh,khaz_,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:01:46 2015 UTC,"That's the thing. They were the organic natural enemy of the Borg but by virtue of also being organic means they are capable of independent thought and thinking before acting (at least, almost every organic species has exhibited this behaviour in Star Trek). Outside of the doctor telling us that they have 5 sexes, we don't know much about their society or way of life. Their isolation tells me they have as much to learn about the ""outside world"" as Voyager (and by extension the galaxy) has to learn about them.  Their first contact with the prime universe was the Borg trying to assimilate them. An isolated and powerful species like them responded in kind and then some. Imagine if Voyager had made first contact...that would have made for an interesting episode or two in itself.  And like all organic life, the nanoprobe torpedoes forced them into self preservation mode. They cant face those things head on so subterfuge and stealth took over. Everything species 8472 exhibited behaviourally tells me they were just alone for a very long time - maybe forever? - and simply had no clue or precedent in engaing with the larger universe. The threat of the nanoprobes forced a necessary change; maybe even for the better."
DaystromInstitute,3b8nsh,drafterman,29,Mon Jun 29 09:47:10 2015 UTC,"DS9 introduced some very interesting races. I would have loved to see the Skrreean plotline expanded in later episodes. I also loved the Hunter-Tosk episode, but I know they were absorbed into the Dominion.  Hands-down, though, would have been the Children of Tama. They were a very richly developed species, as was necessary to accommodate their peculiar language. It would be difficult to do that without making them gimmicky. A cool I idea I imagine is the Enterprise responding to a Klingon distress call. When they arrive at the scene there is a Tamarian warship and debris from what was a Klingon vessel.  The Tamarians first open fire, but are then open to communication. Troi senses that they are extremely anxious and defensive. Picard's reference to ""Picard an Dathon, at El Adrel"" calms the other captain - a bit. However, before tensions can cool any more, another Klingon ship decloaks, the captain demanding vengeance.  Picard and crew must try and decipher what happened before the Klingon commander takes matter in his own hands, and doesn't appear to too concerned the Enterprise might get caught in the cross-fire."

Janeway deduced that these were Hadrosaur, that had survived extinction and evolved to become spacefaring, and had left the Earth millions of years ago, and had since lost all record of this.   Some of the Voth had already speculated on this, and believed in a ""distant origin"" theory. The Voth leaders, however, refused to accept this theory, even forced their own scientists to dismiss it. In the end, the central Voth character, one such scientist who refuses to abandon the truth, decides that his people just aren't ready, no first contact. Everybody basically shrugs and leaves. The end.  So, while I understand that this scientist may have his own principals that obligate him to stay on his planet and keep trying to get the truth accepted, but I think it would have been much more fun if he abandoned his species and joined Voyager.  The Voth were fairly powerful, very advanced, if I remember correctly, so this scientist likely would have been able to provide diplomatic relations in the quadrant, scientific knowledge beyond that of the federations', etc.  They missed a really sweet opportunity, I think."

DaystromInstitute,3b8nsh,eXa12,2,Sat Jun 27 06:52:54 2015 UTC,"What I didn't understand was why the Voth weren't a bigger political entity in the Delta Quadrant. I mean, they had a massive city ship, vastly superior transwarp, powerful weapons etc. so why do we only see them once? Surely after millions of years they'd had branched out by now?  I suppose you could argue that the first hadrosaurs to escape to the stars (presumably to escape what to them was a nuclear winter Earth) didn't have warp drive, or had very basic warp drive and thus it took them a LONG time (hundreds of thousands of years? Millions?!) to reach the Delta Quadrant, and comparatively speaking they're only a few hundred/thousand years more advanced that the Federation."

(I just looked up the Wolfram Alpha) and his being El-Aurian had pretty much nothing to do with the plot, and we learned nothing about them.  The way Guinan squares off against Q (actually watching that episode right now!) is awesome. What sort of powers does she posses that she could actually do anything?!

Maybe they get called up to perform some sort of mission for the Federation such as raiding into Borg space.

DaystromInstitute,3b8nsh,Noumenology,2,Sat Jun 27 18:42:22 2015 UTC,I think in an all out war the Dominion and the Borg would defeat the Voth. They may control a huge area of space and have access to advanced technology but both Superpowers have a nearly infinite amount of ships and soldiers/drones. They would take heavy losses during the war but they would win by brute force and the Borg also have their adaptive capabilities speaking for them.

DaystromInstitute,3b92rv,grapp,39,Fri Jun 26 23:38:40 2015 UTC,"The Dominion did that. When the Cardasdians turned on them, their answer was attempted genocide. That being said, I'm sure The Federation did attack a few civilian targets at some point, war is war. However, this was probably mitigated by the fact that the Dominion's racial hierarchy makes it arguable that none of their personnel in the Alpha Quadrant, barring local allies like the Cardassisns and Breen, could be considered Civilians."
DaystromInstitute,3b92rv,tsarnickolas,4,Fri Jun 26 23:54:16 2015 UTC,800 million Cardassians died at the hands of the Dominion after the rebellion. There was never that level of death depicted on screen again during DS9. I'm sure the civilian deaths by Starfleet is minimal in comparison.
DaystromInstitute,3b92rv,Cash5YR,22,Sat Jun 27 10:42:58 2015 UTC,"But Starfleet didn't bombard Cardassia Prime. The Dominion did, as punishment for the Cardassian betrayal.  Honestly, I don't think there were many, if any, viable civilian targets for Starfleet to assault. Assuming there were, it's likely they would have transferred the civilians to internment camps rather than slaughtering them as the Dominion would.

The ""Klingon paladin"" Worf may agree with your example, but what if that farming colony was directly or indirectly supplying enemy troops? A few civilian casualties to weaken your enemies military position in the area (no food, less morale, more likely to retreat) is arguably a worthy goal.  Also, even Worf admits (for some other Klingons) ""in war there is nothing more honourable than victory"" regardless of the tactics. E.g. sitting in a debris field cloaked, sending out false distress signals to trick your enemy into responding. Dishonourable? We'd probably say so, the crew of the Defiant certainly did. But from the perspective of the Klingons on those ships, ambush is a perfectly legitimate battle tactic. You are weakening your enemy, and it is honourable to defeat your enemy."
DaystromInstitute,3b92rv,BonzoTheBoss,7,Mon Jun 29 07:50:46 2015 UTC,"Even the Klingons would see no honour in such wanton murder   Sort of unclear. ""Nor the Battle to the Strong"" makes it clear that they don't distinguish between combatants and non-combatants, after all. And, as Kirk says, ""Klingons don't take prisoners"" (though, of course, they did take him prisoner several years later...). In ""Rules of Engagement,"" the Klingon lawyer seems to think that civilians supposedly killed in battle were in Sto-vo-kor, and the entire idea of the extradition trial seems to be that, as a Klingon warrior in the bloodlust, Worf wouldn't really be punished for killing civilians (his previous betrayal of the Empire, however...).  It seems unlikely that they'd just blast away at a Cardassian city or something just because they could, but they don't seem like the types to distinguish targets, either."

DaystromInstitute,3b92rv,CleverestEU,5,Sat Jun 27 01:36:46 2015 UTC,"This question reminded me of that too, though that was pre-war. If the Dominion had sent a Vorta named Eddington, there's no telling what Sisko would have done.    My feeling is that attacks on soft targets are more likely to occur later in the conflict due to gradual escalation of depravity, desperation to strike even, etc. At the height of the Dominion War, the main theater was just about solely in the Alpha Quadrant, and the Allies were losing. Their main targets at that point were now-occupied Federation and Klingon worlds. The point of targeting civilians is to shock the enemy and erode public support in their cause, but that's not going to happen if you're killing your own people.   tl;dr Starfleet didn't have opportunities to even consider attacking civilians.  But that's not answering the question. Do I think Starfleet would knowlingly attack a civilian target if the opportunity arose? No. Do I think Starfleet would knowingly turn a blind eye while the Klingons attacked a civilian target? Yes."

I dont recall any specific examples of Starfleet attacking targets that would place civilians at undue risk, but considering the WWII themes woven into the War I would guess that there were significant civilian casualties on all sides.  Starfleet captains would do everything they could to limit civilian casualties, but its pretty hard to ensure that no innocent bystanders are hurt in a war of that scale.  If anything really bloody had to be done Im sure there was a line of Klingon captains happy to take the assignment and let Starfleet keep its hands clean."

Starfleet only authorised him to lie to the Romulan ambassador, and to trade valuble goods with a known criminal- ethically dodgy but not murdering of civilians.  Garak took it upon himself to murder two (more?) people. Sisko made the choice not to expose him, which is very ethically different from killing the two people himself.

DaystromInstitute,3b8n9v,Chicken2nite,10,Fri Jun 26 21:25:55 2015 UTC,"I think this exchange from ""The Conscience of the King"" is pertinent:   MCCOY: Would you care for a drink, Mister Spock?  SPOCK: My father's race was spared the dubious benefits of alcohol.  MCCOY: Now I know why they were conquered.   The implication seems to be that Humans conquered Vulcan, and if I'm reading it correctly, the graphic novel also suggests that Humans had yet to give up their warlike ways after taking to the stars.  Whatever the case, the series does present the idea that Spock and the rest of the Vulcans are lacking a certain edge to make it on their own.  Spock's mission in ""The Galileo Seven"" is a disaster, and the loss of the USS Intrepid, entirely crewed by Vulcans, is said to be due their inability toproperly defend themselves. ""The Enemy Within"" also demonstrates that a man needs his darker impulses to adequately function as a leader, and that a gentle, pacifistic approach isn't enough.  On another note, I have to agree with Roddenberry that Ellison's characterization of the Enterprise crew is a complete misstep.  The idea that the lower decks are staffed with pill-popping fuckups is jarring and unacceptable."
DaystromInstitute,3b8n9v,MungoBaobab,4,Sat Jun 27 00:57:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's an interesting exchange, but I've always taken it as a somewhat metaphorical jab (culturally conquered, perhaps?) and shouldn't be taken seriously.  It also conflicts with the loss of the Intrepid, which is not due simply to Vulcans being unable to defend themselves, but rather the idea that (according to Spock), Vulcans were unable to even conceive of being killed by the amoeba, because Vulcan ""has not been conquered within its collective memory. The memory goes back so far that no Vulcan can conceive of a conqueror."" Kind of silly, but it does seem to contradict (or cast in a new light) McCoy's previous comment.  In any case, it was only in the second season that Star Trek's setting really began to get fleshed out, so contradictions aren't really surprising."
DaystromInstitute,3b8n9v,zuludown888,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:11:06 2015 UTC,It would be a very McCoy jab taken that way and it fits perfectly with canon. I can totally see Bones yuk-yukking about Vulcan's culture and political influence falling to wayside and being superseded by Earth and its violent alcoholics.
DaystromInstitute,3b8n9v,rliant1864,6,Mon Jun 29 07:36:40 2015 UTC,"The backstory of Star Trek is very vague up until, really, First Contact. Even in TNG things are painted with the most vague of brushes (Q's examples from human history and the people in ""The Neutral Zone"" are the only real examples I can think of off the top of my head. Well there's the stuff about baseball in ""Evolution,"" too, I guess).  What seems to be suggested in TOS and TNG is a very different picture of early human interstellar exploration. Humans began to explore the solar system in nuclear-powered vessels in the late 20th Century, they achieved warp drive some time in the 21st, and after that things are kind of vague until TNG established that the Federation was founded in 2161 (fitting with Dr. Carol Marcus' claim in the 2280s that Starfleet had ""kept the peace for over 100 years."").  First Contact was the first real glimpse at Star Trek's backstory. There's no indication that humans have been exploring the solar system in detail with nuclear-powered ships or anything else manned, and instead things are brought more in line with the bleaker projections of ""Encounter at Farpoint"" (with the ""nuclear horror"" of World War 3 extending into the 2070s). Vulcans (or at least contact with Vulcans) saves humanity from itself after Zefram Cochrane discovers warp propulsion. Enterprise expands on that.  Personally, I'm not sure the First Contact version is a great idea (I mean it works great for that story, but I think it didn't work so well for Enterprise, but hey what did?). It's kind of an ironic story, in that the Federation arises out of the kind of meddling that Starfleet swears off in the 24th Century, but it's also a very bleak story that seems to say ""Humans emphasized the very worst aspects of their character up until aliens showed up and transformed their society. If it weren't for blind chance, humans very likely could have obliterated themselves."" Gee, how uplifting.  As for the specific idea that Vulcan was brought into space by Earth, that would fit with the original (very vague) story (though it would seem to conflict with ""Balance of Terror,"" in which the Romulans left Vulcan millenia ago). The problem I'd have with it is that it parrots the usual dumb idea that conflict spurs technological development. It's a baseless cliche and a violent one at that, but when you get down to it I suppose ""City on the Edge of Forever"" has a kind of dumb, violent message to it, too (it's a good story, but I don't think pacifism has ever posed much of a threat -- it's just a cheap knock against Vietnam protestors that misses the entire point)."
DaystromInstitute,3b915f,Kamala_Metamorph,25,Fri Jun 26 23:24:13 2015 UTC,"My favourite episode for addressing equality is the Odo & Laas episode Chimera.  The reason it's my favourite is the allegory to being gay is so wonderfully done and basically charts the whole course in one episode, it has everything from discovering that you're not alone in the world to hesitance about public displays of affection, choosing between people you love and the person you are etc etc, it had so much quality in it, far better than TNG's Outcast that is frequently mentioned.  The most important aspect of the episode though was that it didn't shy away from the fact that intolerance can come from the ""good guys"", it wasn't starfleet crew vs backwards society, it was a far more honest portrayal of reality where good friends can see you as a little less than equal.   BASHIR: What's he doing?   ODO: Being fog, what's it look like?   O'BRIEN: Can't he be fog somewhere else?   BASHIR: Or at night, when no one's around?   ODO: He's not hurting anyone.   O'BRIEN: Still. It's creepy.   BASHIR: Careful, Miles. He might hear you.   O'BRIEN: Good.    &   WORF: He should not have provoked them.   ODO: Provoked them? They attacked Laas.   SISKO: They claim that he surrounded them menacingly.   ODO: They felt menaced by fog?   SISKO: They weren't the only ones. There are twelve other people who filed complaints.   ODO: Is it a crime to shape-shift on the Promenade?   SISKO: It's not a crime, but obviously it's not a good idea.   And as always Quark provides the thoughtful insight   QUARK: Odo. I heard about your friend. Rumour has it the Klingons want to put him on trial.   ODO: They're the ones who should be put on trial. If they'd attacked anyone other than a changeling, they would be.  QUARK: You're probably right. That fog episode certainly didn't help matters.   ODO: Laas was only doing what comes naturally to us.   QUARK: You never pulled a stunt like that. You're smart enough to know that people don't want to be reminded that you're different. Who wants to see somebody turn into goo? I hope you don't do that around Kira.   ODO: Why shouldn't I?   QUARK: If she's anything like me, she'd rather you didn't. Don't you get it, Odo? We humanoids are a product of millions of years of evolution. Our ancestors learned the hard way that what you don't know might kill you. They wouldn't have survived if they hadn't have jumped back when they encountered a snake coiled in the muck. And now millions of years later, that instinct is still there. It's genetic. Our tolerance to other lifeforms doesn't extend beyond the two arm, two leg variety. I hate to break this to you, but when you're in your natural state, you're more than our poor old genes can handle.    It didn't attempt to brush over that either, it didn't force a reconciliation because that's not how it happens in the real world, that made it authentic and probably had a bigger impact as a result, people would be more likely to consider the impact of those things if there was no resolution shown.  The episode took Odo's character and made the comparison to being gay and the issues (most of which persist) surrounding that but did it without having to force his character into the role, it all slotted together perfectly, what's more it can be watched without having to concentrate on the allegory aspect and enjoyed purely within the context of the overall show with the facing story being perfectly in context of the overall DS9 show."

I'll admit, I didn't make the gay connection at the time, but I recognized the concept of ""otherness"" and tolerence (or lack thereof) it was trying to communicate.  It also opened up entirely new aspects of shape-shifting I hadn't considered before. I never thought about them being able to turn into gases or even chemical reactions. You can see why the Vorta of old would regard the Founders as gods (even before the genetic manipulation, also assuming Weyoun's story on the origins of the Vorta is true)"
DaystromInstitute,3b915f,neoteotihuacan,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:00:24 2015 UTC,I have to research this now. This is a great analysis.
DaystromInstitute,3b915f,jimmysilverrims,12,Fri Jul 10 03:41:42 2015 UTC,"Ironically, not as well as people remember it.  I've always wanted to make a post about it, but Star Trek in general and TOS in specific is remembered as some bastion of progressiveness in an intolerant era. We idealize the show as this landmark step forward, but in doing so we make Washington-and-the-cherry-tree apocrypha glorifying it out of turn.   For instance, the kiss in Plato's Stepchildren is made into the kiss of television. It's remembered as a ""first"" that rocked the world, something stoppered at every turn, something radical and forward.  But in all honesty, it wasn't. For those who've seen the actual episode you'll see how very unprogressive the kiss actually is.   Uhura and Chapel are introduced suddenly, solely for the (deliberately) unsettling and forced scene where they're forced to kiss Kirk and Spock, respectively. And even though it's portrayed as a frightening, disturbing ordeal for everyone involved it's interesting to see how Spock and Chapel engage in a (puppeteered) kiss of passion, but Shatner doesn't so much as pucker his lips.   It's patently clear that even in a situation where no interracial romance is implied, where the kiss is clearly struggled against and unwanted and would hold none of the meaning that an actual loving kiss would, they still don't actually kiss.  A lot of people have cited in TILs that Shatner and Nichols flubbed the take deliberately so they could keep the kiss. That is, however, only half-true. In reality, the not-kiss kiss was nothing more than a compromise with the producers.   And if you're thinking of saying that it was still radical ""for its time"", you're still off-track. When the episode aired, the kiss wasn't news at all. Hell, Ebony Magazine, the magazine specifically tailored to black events and culture, didn't even report on it. The idea that this was the first instance of an interracial kiss on television is patently untrue.  ITV's Emergency Ward – 10 has an interracial kiss. And not just a part of a one-off ""no parties consent"" empty display for one episode. Part of an ongoing romance between two consenting, loving characters. One a black man and the other a white woman.   And this didn't happen the previous year, or even the year before that. Ward had it's kiss four years prior to Star Trek's.  Now Nichols insists that they did, in fact, kiss for real (despite clear evidence to the contrary), and that's another unfortunate thing I'd like to address because the historic status of the kiss isn't the only cherry tree story that too many fans fall for.  Perhaps you've heard of Nichele Nichols' encounter with MLK. Where, at a time where she contemplated leaving Star Trek, he personally met with her and convinced her to stay.  Well, as it turns out, that might not be the whole truth either. As Nichols continues to recount the incident, it seems to increase in scale with each retelling, like some ""to think that I saw it on Mullbery street"" boast. I can't assert what the real story is, but it certainly seems like the tale's been embellished over the years.  And hopefully none of this implies that Star Trek, or even just Plato's Stepchildren wasn't progressive. Hell, that episode contains one of the series most explicitly progressive lines about the future in regards to equality:   ALEXANDER: You know, I believe you are. Listen, where you come from, are there a lot of people without the power and my size? KIRK: Alexander, where I come from, size, shape, or colour makes no difference, and nobody has the power."
DaystromInstitute,3b915f,zuludown888,11,Sat Jun 27 01:11:01 2015 UTC,"I think Star Trek's ""progressiveness"" was exaggerated with time. Roddenberry liked to do this himself -- for instance he liked to say that NBC executives wanted him to remove the ""Number One"" character from the show after the original pilot because they objected to a woman being in such a position of authority, but the truth is that they just didn't like Majel (maybe there was some sexism in that, too, but it's certainly more complex than what Roddenberry said). Roddenberry often seems to have blamed personal rejections (like the rejection of his first Star Trek movie script) on the prejudices of others, but I don't think that was always (or even often) the case.  In a recent discussion about gay characters (well, the lack thereof) in Star Trek, I brought up David Gerrold's recollection of Rodenberry's own promise in 1986 of gay characters in TNG. As we all know, that ended up never happening, and the blame is often placed on Rick Berman. But Roddenberry could have pushed for it harder.  Star Trek did have a lot of radical notions, not the least of which is exactly the sort of radical democratic notion you quoted. That's rather inspiring, and it's nice when Star Trek actually lived up to that kind of ideal."
DaystromInstitute,3b915f,rextraverse,7,Sat Jun 27 04:06:25 2015 UTC,"ITV's Emergency Ward – 10[5] has an interracial kiss   Well, you don't even have to go into foreign television for examples.  Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz kissed all the time on I Love Lucy.  Robert Culp and France Nuyen kissed on I Spy.  Sammy Davis Jr and Nancy Sinatra kissed on Movin' with Nancy.  The Plato's Stepchildren kiss would be most accurately described as the first kiss between a black person and a white person on American scripted television."

Well, as it turns out, that might not be the whole truth either. As Nichols continues to recount the incident, it seems to increase in scale with each retelling, like some ""to think that I saw it on Mulberry street"" boast.    I'm have to assume that this isn't your only source for this criticism~ I've heard Nichols' health has been deteriorating for years, I saw her at a convention last year, any story she recalls at this point is suspect, and criticism of her stories now are below the belt. Plus, that entire thread is primarily based on one person extrapolating from one interview and the subsequent storm seems disproportionately severe. (Also also, I've read somewhere that when you remember something, you're actually remembering the last time you remembered it. So I guess you write over the memory each time.) Interested if you've read her autobiography? I can't google-book the preview, I should probably get it from the library to see how the stories compare.   I'm going to go and think hard about your other criticisms though. While Trek may have a loftier position in history than it deserved, I think I'd argue that, in the early days, every little bit that pushes against the membrane is part of fighting the good fight. They may not have been The First, but they should get credit for being in the group of pioneers that walked the trails towards equality so that those behind them would have an easier path."

And, truth be told, I haven't been tracking her recountimgs. When fans are claiming that the story was different a few decades back, I take their word, but with a pretty big grain of salt. I'd actually like to see Snopes do their thing with this, as its one of the more memorable tales of Trek history and it's just gonna but me if nobody sets the record straight."

(sidenote: I freaking love Snopes, have for probably 20 years. I managed to get my mom to stop sending me alarmist fake forwards before running it through Snopes first. I once sent back a takedown for the people who forwarded me something about terrorists being a certain demographic.) >:("
DaystromInstitute,3b915f,FallingSnowAngel,8,Sat Jun 27 07:43:21 2015 UTC,"In general, I think Star Trek often handles issues of the basic rights of human beings kind of poorly. I love Star Trek, and I like that it portrays a vision of humanity that is in keeping with our best qualities (love, friendship, empathy, compassion), rather than our worst (greed, fear, anger, cruelty), but it tends to focus so much on that vision that it forgets that what makes Star Trek's people special is that they conquer those failings and remain true to the principles that we like to believe we follow today.  What Trek seems to transmit, at least in the TNG era, is a very whiggish view of history, with ""progress"" just inevitably happening as time goes on in an inexorable rise (unless your planet's atmosphere self-destructs or volcanoes kill your whole civilization, in which case tough shit -- in fact I think the whole idea of the ""Prime Directive"" in TNG-era Trek betrays a kind of colonialist mindset, or at least a mindset that sees colonialism as a universal trait rather than a particular ideology). The actual fight for equality is rarely shown (or it's portrayed exceedingly passively on the part of our heroes) -- instead we usually just see this society that has magically transformed into an egalitarian paradise. There's a tendency in TNG-era Trek to portray our heroes as basically incorruptable, even when it comes to (sometimes semi-justifiable) prejudice.  So in that way I think some of the best stories of Star Trek are the ones in which the main characters go from being prejudiced to recognizing the common (for lack of a better term) humanity in their enemies.  A good example of this, I think, is Star Trek VI, in which Kirk has an entirely understandable prejudice against the Klingons. They killed his son! He's fought them for virtually all of his adult life! He's seen them do dastardly things like enslave planets (""Errand of Mercy"") or try to poison a planet's food supply (""The Trouble with Tribbles""). Why should he believe that the Klingons are being honest with their peace overture? Even if they are being honest, are they even worth helping?  Gradually, Kirk comes to realize how selfish and wrong this view is. He sees Gorkon as Spock sees him. He sees that others in the Federation, who believe as he does, are doing evil things for the same views. And in the end the Enterprise (and Sulu) save the day for peace. Good story.  The worst is probably ""Dear Doctor,"" which presents a kind of stark eugenicist and racist view of human (alien) value. People with ""good"" genes are ""destined"" to rule, those with ""bad"" genes are destined to die out, and any effort to help the ""weaker"" people is just ""playing God."" Like, holy shit, what a horrible way to look at the world, in which your (or your culture's) value is determined not by how good of a person you are or the very fact that you're alive and experiencing existence, but rather is a cold calculation of genetic worth, when usually Star Trek is a bit better than that.*  * - there's this part in ""Statistical Probabilities"" in which Bashir and O'Brien are talking about genetic engineering and Bashir's playfully like ""Oh it's really tough being around such slow-thinkers like all of you, but it makes me feel superior hyuk hyuk"" and I always really wanted O'Brien to say ""Well, you know, Julian, Khan got his ass kicked by the dumb-witted normals three times, so be careful not getting your head stuck up your ass."""
DaystromInstitute,3b915f,SpocksBrainLLAP,3,Sat Jun 27 03:53:22 2015 UTC,"You make a lot of good points, but I'd like to argue on the behalf of ""Dear Doctor"".  That was the whole point of the episode: They didn't know what to do! The episode's intent was to show us that they didn't have a definitive moral compass yet and despite their best efforts they could make bad judgments.  Archer was just given the power of life and death and he didn't know what to do with it - It was a choice too big for him or the doctor. In the end he did as many of us would have and he chose inaction instead of making an effect for better or worse."
DaystromInstitute,3b915f,FallingSnowAngel,2,Sat Jun 27 22:37:06 2015 UTC,"No, most of us wouldn't let people suffer and die like that, if we had a cure. Holy shit, that's sick."

The choice is obvious: you save them.  However Archer was faced with a moral dilemma. It didn't matter what it was - it was just that little thought at the back of everyone's minds; that niggling question: If we save these people are we hurting someone else?  The stakes were far too high. In the end Archer made the natural - yet immoral - decision to do nothing.  He backed out because it was too much for him and then he tried to justify his actions. Everyone does this. However bad the decision you will always try to tell yourself you made the right one.  Like I said - it is perfectly natural. To use an analogy you may have heard of:  You work on the railroad where your job is to switch the rails. A school bus has fallen onto the track and a train is coming. The train will hit the bus unless you switch the track. However, on the other track is a lone child.   To act you save the many but condemn the one. To refuse to act you can tell yourself neither tragedy was your fault. This was Archer's choice and he chose not to act so as to be easier on his conscience."

It's more like the moral dilemma where we ask ourselves if we'd torture someone to get the information needed to save us all from a nuclear detonation... while blatantly ignoring the fact that we're deliberately framing the argument in such a way that we can justify torturing potentially innocent people, elsewhere, despite the fact that it'll give us horrible intelligence, and cost us any moral highground, the same way it always has.   To even play the game is to lose.  And that's why you can decide who lives or dies in your hypothetical, which is just as relevant to this debate as the plot to one of the later Saw sequels."
DaystromInstitute,3b915f,SpocksBrainLLAP,3,Mon Jun 29 07:30:58 2015 UTC,"To even play the game is to lose.   That is exactly the point.  To play for Archer is to save innocents while keeping others in a class so low that it is practically slavery. To refuse to play you can predict how things will turn out: They will die while the slaves are free.  To not play though things are not set in stone as much as they appear to be. There is the tiny chance that everyone could live and the slaves could become equals, however unlikely.  It was a cowardly choice, not a malicious one. For Archer to participate means one definitive outcome beyond a reasonable doubt - an outcome that isn't perfect. For him to refuse to do anything sets the dice spinning at 1/1000.  That chance is why he didn't do anything. Archer was selfish by letting fate choose for him.  At no point did I say that he made the right choice - just that he made an understandable one.  He didn't want to play God over a planet so he chose not to - simultaneously sentencing its people to pestilence. He didn't bring the plague, he just refused to stop it, leaving room for Archer to sleep at night."

He refused to give a cure. You can make excuses for it, but the truth is -    room for Archer to sleep at night.   He's a spineless amoral sociopath. A working conscience wouldn't allow it.   And some of us prefer to not watch spineless amoral sociopaths get exciting adventures, while their Nazi doctors push their novel beliefs about evolution down our throats.

You can make excuses for it, but the truth is -   YES! That is what I have been saying. Archer didn't make the ""good"" decision - he made the easy decision. He did the wrong thing because he was far overwhelmed.  Enterprise is about our current people - more advanced, but certainly our people - in the situations we see in TOS and TNG, trying to adapt. It wasn't an attack on Star Trek because at that point they weren't Star Trek characters - they were us trying to be Star Trek characters.  Suddenly thrust upon him was the roles of judge, jury and possibly executioner for a people he had just met. He did the human thing and he tried to get away from that responsibility with disastrous results.  Had he taken one option he was a saviour and an unknowing oppressor. The other has him as an unwilling hero and a murderer. Archer did the natural thing and refused to participate, which happened to be intertwined with one of the options.  The only other option was to choose and that requires all consequences to fall on him. Any option he takes would leave him soley responsible with no escape and instead he took the easy way because it was human - not Star Trek."
DaystromInstitute,3b915f,Fly015,5,Mon Jun 29 09:42:36 2015 UTC,"(I'm going to do two comments, one on example of where it falls short, another on favourite)  There is one example that always comes back to me where Trek as an entire franchise has fallen short, it isn't an episode meant as a commentary on equality and it doesn't actually relate to any contemporary social issues (animal rights excepted) but fan discussions of it always show a glaring hole in the perception of the equal treatment of lifeforms.  Equinox pt I & II  Any discussion of it will usually be split between those that condemn the equinox crew outright and those that consider it a case of unfortunate ends justifying the means.  The point being, despite the fact that we are told that these beings are sentient and intelligent beings, there is still a sizeable number of people who dismiss their right to life essentially because they don't look like us.   I believe that if that episode had a humanoid looking species being dissected for fuel, killing them in the process, there'd be little to no defence of the equinox's crews actions but since the species looks different it becomes quasi-acceptable.

DaystromInstitute,3b6tfe,iceykitsune,25,Fri Jun 26 13:05:00 2015 UTC,"In 1996 Jeri Taylor declared Mosaic to be canon. Should we consider it canon?  Before you answer, consider that information from Mosaic was contradicted on Voyager once Taylor was no longer on the Voyager production staff.  Going the other direction: in 2034, long after Bob Orci has moved to other projects, do you think anyone will consider ""Countdown"" canon?  Do you think that the writers of a future Star Trek television show or movie should be beholden to the events of ""Countdown?""  Lastly, you might be interested in Bob Orci's exact words on the matter:   TrekMovie: Well the bigger issue is more [Star Trek movie prequel comic] ""Star Trek: Countdown"" and whether or not that is considered canon. That is not a promotional thing, that is a…. thing thing. Your name, JJ’s name is on it and Alex’s name is on it. So canon or not canon?  Roberto Orci: I don’t think that is for me to decide. As you know I considered some of the books, in my mind, to be of character canon. And some of them in between the movies to possibly be even possible candidates for canon, until some other movie comes along and makes those impossible. That is my personal view, but I am not going to declare whether comics are canon.   (Emphasis mine)  So to be clear, Bob Orci considers ""Countdown"" to be his own ""headcanon,"" which makes sense because in the movies he's written he's been building off the events depicted in these comics. But Orci's view of canon is actually very enlightened: he understands Trek is bigger than he is, and has made no real effort to mess with the commonly accepted definition of canon. The idea that he said ""'Countdown' is canon"" stems from him being quoted out of context—it's not what he actually said."
DaystromInstitute,3b6tfe,kraetos,4,Fri Jun 26 15:52:16 2015 UTC,"everything on screen is definitely canon, right? what about when two things on screen end up contradicting each other, accidentally? i seem to recall threads here about this happening and fans having to work out ways around it. if this is possible even just limited to tv show episodes, then why cant it be possible with the written word?   and what about when there are multiple versions of a movie? is only the original theatrical release considered canon? do the extended scenes in wrath of khan dvd directors cut not count? they were probably in nicholas meyers head when he filmed and edited, similar to orci when he was writing here. either way it ended up as an official release did it not?  do you think that the writers of any future films or tv series set in the prime universe are beholden to the original tos scripts that gene roddenberry himself wrote? since he was the ultimate first creator and writer, regardless of what was filmed from those scripts and shown?   i know that in the case of mosaic and the nutrek comics, the term canon was likely just used in order to get trekkers more interested in buying it. but in the larger examination of canon, i dont think its that cut and dried."
DaystromInstitute,3b6tfe,dishpandan,5,Fri Jun 26 18:16:01 2015 UTC,"For my part, I take on-screen as the supreme determiner of canonicity. Which does create the necessity for fans like us Daystrom Fellows to reconcile things from time to time (I think one of the more notable ones we always come back to is the ""There was no evidence of Eugenics Wars in 'Futures End' because they were regional conflicts on the other side of the world')... but its still a hard and fast line.  Canonical retcons tend to be few are far between (though more common with ENT, sadly). Whereas the filmed material will contradict the written stuff whenever they want. If you let some in, you let it all in, and we have a world in which canonicty becomes completely useless.   Not to mention, Orci has a clearly limited role in terms of Trek authority. He can declare whatever he wants, but I seriously doubt if we get a new Prime Universe TV show that the showrunner will consider himself at all beholden to ""Countdown"". Whereas they'll almost certainly incorporate the Prime Inverse details from the 2009 film.   Hell in Roddenberry's headcanon, there was never any interpersonal conflict amongst series mains. I for one am glad Behr and Moore decided to go their own way."
DaystromInstitute,3b6tfe,BigKev47,3,Fri Jun 26 18:35:31 2015 UTC,"There are very real examples of many of the instances you cited, and the fandom tends to deal with them on a case-by-case basis. Entire threads have been dedicated to sussing out discrepancies in canon, both here and on /r/startrek.   but in the larger examination of canon, i dont think its that cut and dried.   Absolutely. Which is precisely why we actively discourage arguments about the definition of canon in this subreddit:   Some people are interested in defining what is and is not canon. That’s not a big concern here at the Daystrom Institute: as stated above, all Star Trek material is equally open to discussion."
DaystromInstitute,3b6tfe,kraetos,7,Fri Jun 26 18:34:10 2015 UTC,"Is there more to it than that, though? The issue of what is and is not canon, for any purposes, is not a decision to be taken lightly. There should be more of a reason to alter the current policy other than the fact that you believe it's preventing you from discussing a narrow range of topics.  I say ""you believe"" because I don't think changing the canon policy will change people's opinions on those topics. There is a lot of things which are canon under the current policy that people still dismiss anyway and will not talk about in-depth, so I don't think changing will alleviate the problem you have here. After all, discussions about non-canon topics are not out of place here. No one should be down-voting or otherwise discouraging discussion of non-canon material simply because it is non-canon. So you are free to discuss those topics, but we can't force people to be interested in them or agree with any POV, and making them canon won't change that, unfortunately.  The current canon policy is good, I think, because it is objective. There is no disputing whether something is a Star Trek movie or television show ""produced by Desilu, Paramount, or CBS."" However, individual works and statements, be they verbal statements or books written by crew, cast or fan, aren't objective. They're subjective. And while we are all free to have our own ""head canon,"" we really can't force anyone else to agree with that."
DaystromInstitute,3b6tfe,drafterman,3,Fri Jun 26 13:18:14 2015 UTC,"individual works and statements, be they verbal statements or books written by crew, cast or fan, aren't objective.   In an interview with trekmovie.com   TrekMovie.com: Yes, but some of the exceptions were that extended universe things done by creators of filmed canon were also canon. My argument also is that in previous times there was a plethora of filmed material to fill out the canon of the prime universe. So the extended universe stuff was a little bit extra on the side.  With the new movie universe there may be just three feature films, but there could also be an animated show, the comic books, games. In the end there will more extended universe, which is more like how it has been with Star Wars. And the way Lucas handles canon there is that the EU stuff is canon, but the films reserve the right to contradict and trump them. So in your case it would mean that everything in the game, comic books, etc you have overseen, like ""Star Trek Countdown"" for example, is canon except for anything that was contradicted by the movies. I thought that would be an interesting model and the difference with previous Trek is that you guys are overseeing all of this. These rules aren’t written in stone from my perspective and I think a lot of fans would like to hear you say, ""yes these are all the adventures of Kirk, Spock and the gang and it is all canon and all ties together into a single universe."" Again, with the caveat that you reserve the right to contradict any of it in a future movie and that would trump. That’s my pitch to you.  Roberto Orci: OK, based on that then with you Anthony Pascale as a witness, I hereby declare anything that we oversee to be canon.    That's not objective?"

DaystromInstitute,3b6tfe,drafterman,6,Fri Jun 26 15:17:39 2015 UTC,"Right, which is why it is important (for this sub, at least) to have, as canon, things which cannot be undone. Nothing anyone says won't change the fact that TNG was a TV show produced by Paramount. There is no Q-like entity who can snap their fingers and make that no longer truth.  The canon discussions of this sub shouldn't hinge on the roving opinions of studio executives. Even Roddenberry himself said that Star Trek V was apocryphal, but we reject that declaration when decided canon.  Regardless, it's still a proposed solution that won't solve the OP's problem. Making it canon won't make people more receptive."
DaystromInstitute,3b6tfe,Mirror_Sybok,2,Fri Jun 26 15:53:45 2015 UTC,It's fine to have a canon policy. I just wanted to express my view that canon isn't some concrete thing. It can change. Later works can conflict with earlier works and the people in charge can decide to alter what is part of the universe even if it is on screen. So of course no one can deny that any of the movies literally happened in a real world sense but the in universe reality is about as stable as whatever business suit is in charge this year.
DaystromInstitute,3b6tfe,drafterman,2,Fri Jun 26 16:00:45 2015 UTC,Necessarily the movies and television shows are more consistent and agreed-upon than the collective opinions of the cast and crew.

DaystromInstitute,3b6tfe,Mirror_Sybok,2,Fri Jun 26 16:09:23 2015 UTC,I'm not sure that the way we define canon now is entirely efficient but I also cannot at this moment envision a compromise that will satisfy everyone's personal view.

Whether it's objective or not, this caveat means that the comics cannot be canonical in the same sense as filmed material -- the very definition of ""canonical"" is that it can't be trumped or superceded by later canonical work. It's basically saying that we should take the comics to be what everyone already takes them as -- work by the authors of the new films that is compatible with those films and in some cases provides interesting background. And I interpret Orci's response as being in the spirit of ""just for fun,"" too, given the over-solemnity."

DaystromInstitute,3b6tfe,adamkotsko,5,Fri Jun 26 14:14:41 2015 UTC,"I would argue that by the time it reaches the big (or little) screen it should have been checked for continuity and consistency by the writers/producers to avoid mistakes.  For example, what if the writers decide that Spock should no longer be Vulcan, maybe he should have been Romulan all along. They can release a film where he's suddenly Romulan, but the fans more than likely won't accept it. It causes an unacceptable breach in our suspension of disbelief. Now I suppose if they went on some grandios sub plot about how Spock gets transformed into a Romulan, or how he was always Romulan they just hid it from him for his entire life (much like how Enterprise retroactively explained the lack of Klingon ridges in TOS) that might sit a little better, but it has to be consistent with the universe you've already created.  TOS is often pointed at as being the least consistent of the series, but that's because the writers are the time weren't aware they were creating a 50 year franchise that would spawn multiple other series. In some ways, that's why they ""rebooted"" the franchise in the latest films, because they were so constrained by the limitations of existing canon that they felt they needed to ""branch off"" without pissing off the fans too much. Which unfortunately for a lot of them they've still failed to do..."

I think there's a lot to be said for becoming comfortable with how non-canonical materials relate to the canon in different ways. TNG Technical Manual is specifically not canonical, but the backstage info is super-valuable, and has a reasonable chance of contributing to future-canon. I see a lot of the official licensed material around Star Trek 2009 to be of similar caliber. Some officially licensed fiction is... less relevant to the canon.

DaystromInstitute,3b6tfe,mistakenotmy,4,Fri Jun 26 18:08:43 2015 UTC,"I have attempted to discuss materiel that had been declared primary cannon by Roberto Orci, but was met with resistance due to this institute's policy.   The resistance you received was not due to your attempt to discuss Roberto Orci's comics. The resistance came when you asserted that these comics are canon.   There are two separate issues involved here. One issue is the definition of what is canon, and the other issue is what we discuss here at /r/DaystromInstitute.  Regarding the first issue, of what is and is not canon, there have been many statements over the decades by various people with creative control or influence over the Star Trek franchise. We've collected some of the pertinent ones in our detailed page on canon policy. These include Gene Roddenberry (the creator of Star Trek), Marco Palmieri (the editor who created the current ""Trek LitVerse"" book series), and even the owners of the official Star Trek website (CBS Studios, who own the Star Trek television franchise). The common thread in all these statements is that only on-screen events are canon; everything else is not. Some individuals along the way have declared their particular off-screen material to be canon, like Jeri Taylor, a former Executive Producer of 'Voyager', who declared her own novel 'Mosaic' to be canon, and Roberto Orci, a co-writer and producer of the two reboot movies, who declared his own comics to be canon. On the other hand, Gene Roddenberry declared that his own novelisation of 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' was not canon. Generally speaking, the people who own or control the franchise have agreed that only on-screen instalments are canon, and this is reflected in our canon policy here at the Daystrom Institute.   Regarding the second issue, it doesn't matter what is and is not canon - our Code of Conduct specifically states:    We discuss everything: TV shows, movies, books, comics, games, fan productions. Anything which has Star Trek content or is related to Star Trek is fair game.    So, don't get caught up in arguments about what materials are and are not canon. That's not what Daystrom is for. Simply focus on discussing their content."

If anything, I think the depiction of the American response to this mixed-gender triad of unmarried ""business associates,"" who supposedly needed their car fixed but then stayed indefinitely, was unrealistically open.

I don't think everyone in the Soviet Union were evil murderers who would kill anything that was different.  I imagine the military response to the Vulcans by the USSR would have differed very little from the US military response.  I can see how things would have been worse had the USSR gained scientific advances over the West from the Vulcans, but I don't think it's fair to paint every non-military, non political person in the former USSR as back stabbing savages, who would have turned in the Vulcans as soon as look at them.   .  Though Perhaps with the information gained via interrogation of the Vulcans the Soviet Union might have been able to build orbital phaser platforms, Star Trek style sensors and launched an attack on the US to destroy any Nuclear weapons held by the US, they might have been able to build shields, and portable land phasers too, and won the Cold War, probably with very few casualties, simply due to the fact the futuristic weapons allowed them to Blitzkreig their way through the West.  I suppose though if the Vulcans had simply been shot by the KGB or something, it wouldn't matter, the Vulcans would have left Earth be, and still turned up for Cochranes warp drive test.   their report would probably have read that the regime is very oppressive and that humans are far from   enlightenment.   As much as life was more freer and better during the 50's for the west, it was far from being some kind of enlightened free thinking Utopia, and was far less liberal than today.  I wonder if the Vulcans wrote about the lynchings, homophobia, conformity, Jim Crow laws etc that existed in the US, (of course many people found these things wrong even at the time)."

I'm saying that's a hugely flawed simplistic view of the people in the former USSR, it does paint them as inherently duplicitous, even within families.  I doubt it was quite like that, by that I mean the normal civilians and workers.  The political system yes they were arseholes, as were most of the military generals.  But you know what, the USSR never actually went to war, any more than NATO did so I'm thinking some sense prevailed within the Eastern Bloc.  I have to wonder what show people are actually watch when they say they watch Star Trek, because they seem to be watching something entirely different from the show I'm watching.   America gets depicted a little to well in that episode.   Yeah, they didn't show 'Boys Beware', a Lynching or the separate services people of differing ethnicities had to use in Southern States as far as I recall.  I guess Carbon Creek being in Pennsylvania makes a difference though, I wonder if things had been different if the Vulcans had landed in say Kentucky or Tennessee, Or if they had actually landed somewhere predominantly black, I wonder what their report would have said then.  I'm not trying to insinuate anything about the US or Russia today though, or insult anyone's sensibilities now, I'm just saying neither side in the Cold War could lay claim to sweeping generalisations of goodness or oppressiveness during the 50's, I think the West was better, but the people in Soviet Union were as much victims as they were participants in that former regime, and may well have been just as helpful to the Vulcans.

The Stasi were very cruel and extreme, but clearly people were dissidents in that system or the Stasi wouldn't have been necessary, neither would the Berlin wall or checkpoints to keep people in. That's one system, one area within the whole of the Eastern Bloc, what you're doing is stereotyping a whole nation of people.    I don't think this is place for this conversation either, it's not suitable for Daystrom Institute, OK."
DaystromInstitute,3b65e6,Berggeist,0,Fri Jun 26 10:19:03 2015 UTC,"Surely there is a difference between living through and going to a museum. However, I've talked to people who were ""questioned"", who were observed and who have first hand experience. It was really that bad. But for the sake of DaystromInstitute, let's call it a day and focus on other topics."
DaystromInstitute,3b65e6,Lord_Hoot,1 point,Fri Jun 26 10:23:25 2015 UTC,Are you sure you're not confusing secrecy of agents with number of agents?
DaystromInstitute,3b65e6,Neo_Techni,2,Fri Jun 26 20:18:12 2015 UTC,"Yes. Eastern Germany had 16 million inhabitants. According to the ministry of state security there were 100000 official agents in the internal security service. And 200000 covert ops. The neighbors, teachers and so on. That is one spy for every 53 inhabitants. Which is quite a lot."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,zuludown888,17,Fri Jun 26 01:46:08 2015 UTC,"Both Enterprise and Voyager had interesting premises that the writers decided to ignore in practice, preferring to work the ""planet of the week"" formula.  In theory Voyager was made smaller than the Enterprise-D exactly because it sounded interesting to put a little ship that wasn't built to be an explorer all alone exactly as you suggest.  Making the ship even smaller wouldn't have had much effect if the writers didn't have the heart to follow through.  Basically, if you want to see humans blazing a trail through unknown space, where the characters are dealing with real stakes, watch Battlestar Galactica.  A lot of people have described it as Voyager done right.  Personally, I would have been delighted if they had just kept a count of the number of shuttles and photon torpedoes that got used up.  And when they hit the limit, just told the writers they didn't have any more.  It would have forced some creativity to get away from the ""battle with the aliens of the week"" pattern, and they might have found something interesting in giving the characters desperation that was felt by the writers.  OTOH, I don't mind that there was a Holodeck.  In retrospect, Captain Proton actually turned out to be one of my favorite things, even though I thought it was stupid the first time I saw it.  Having the characters commenting indirectly about the show itself was actually really fun, even if it wasn't exactly super hard sci fi which I always gravitate to."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,wrosecrans,11,Fri Jun 26 08:37:16 2015 UTC,How cool would it have been if we got to see Belanna struggling to build a shuttle out of cannibalized parts of shuttles that had been trashed in previous episodes?  Or if they had to resort to using Neelix's ship?
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,Meat_Confetti,4,Fri Jun 26 14:01:32 2015 UTC,"I mean, the Delta Flyer was pretty cool, I guess."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,BuddhasLittleWarlock,35,Fri Jun 26 18:05:13 2015 UTC,"The first couple seasons of DS9 tried so hard to take this track.  Right from the pilot episode we were constantly shown that the station was held together with nothing more than duct tape and O'Brian's tears.  Almost every episode sneaks in at least one reference to uncomfortable beds, replicators producing nearly inedible food, the lack of recreation facilities, critical manpower shortages, or some other reminder that they were definitely not living it up in a floating space resort.  The same goes for the tactical side, with away missions conducted in glorified warp shuttles and the station itself a sitting duck to any real warship.  Honestly, I think it is part of the reason those early seasons are seen as such disappointments compared to the latter seasons.  People want to see one of the most advanced AIs in the Quadrant squandered singing show tunes to the crew, not to see the Commander spend half a season struggling to get his hands on a palatable cup of coffee.  They want to see the heroes riding into battle heroically in the Defiant, not scurrying away in the Rio Grande.    In the case of DS9 it all sort of worked out in the end, as the underpowered early seasons just make the overpowered late seasons feel more epic.  However, I cant help but think that the people putting together Voyager saw how this angle worked for the first few seasons of DS9 and decided to deliberately steered away making deprivation a weighty issue in their show."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,jrs100000,27,Fri Jun 26 02:36:11 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think it is part of the reason those early seasons are seen as such disappointments compared to the latter seasons. People want to see one of the most advanced AIs in the Quadrant squandered singing show tunes to the crew, not to see the Commander spend half a season struggling to get his hands on a palatable cup of coffee. They want to see the heroes riding into battle heroically in the Defiant, not scurrying away in the Rio Grande.    See, I don't think that's what it is at all. The reason why the Doctor episodes work on Voyager isn't because people have a particular love of seeing the most advanced technology or whatever, but rather because the Doctor was one of Voyager's few really strong characters, and so it was interesting to see him get into situations and deal with problems.  Conversely, the reason why a few of Voyager's early episodes like ""The Cloud"" (the ""There's coffee in that nebula"" episode) didn't work is because the stakes are so low. Voyager might not have enough energy to make coffee? Oh jeez Janeway might get cranky that will be really bad!  Watching Voyager, there's just very rarely any real threat to the ship that is believable, even early on (arguably especially early on, when Voyager was explicitly more powerful than whole fleets of Kazon ships). If the struggle isn't just to survive but rather to make sure that luxuries like the replicator can stay on (and meanwhile everyone gets a turn to screw around in the holodeck), that's just not very dramatic.  As far as DS9 goes, the point of much of DS9, and emphasizing the station's comparative broken-down-ness, was to convince the audience that they really were on the frontier, and that dangers to the station, or to the station's mission, were real. In ""Emissary,"" there really is the danger that the station is going to get blasted by the Cardassians, because they're not armed to any significant extent and the nearest help is a day away.  As the story went on, and the importance of the wormhole became more clear, the writers used the Defiant to further highlight the importance of all that: The Dominion was such a threat that Starfleet was putting a warship (the first of its kind) at DS9's disposal. That added to the drama.  (As an aside, the reason why so much of the first two seasons of DS9 is crap, I'd say, has nothing to do with runabouts or a lack of photon torpedoes, but rather a large number of scripts that are castoff TNG ideas)  TNG isn't more interesting than TOS because the technology is more advanced -- the fictional technology of the show is just a tool for the story and the characters. What matters is how those tools are used. The problem is that Voyager had this fantastic tool -- the idea of being far from home, lost in space -- and they didn't make use of it, partly because the other tools at the writers' disposal undermined that core concept."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,disposable_pants,23,Fri Jun 26 04:04:33 2015 UTC,"Conversely, the reason why a few of Voyager's early episodes like ""The Cloud"" (the ""There's coffee in that nebula"" episode) didn't work is because the stakes are so low.   Another consequence of low stakes:  Putting the ship in real danger requires Voyager to go out of her way looking for trouble.  You're 70,000 light years away from help and you're going to poke around every exotic anomaly even remotely in your path?  Really?  The Maquis crewmen even call out the insanity of that.    The result is viewers are left screaming ""Just get out of there -- there's nothing for you here!"" at their TVs when the high drama is supposed to be happening.  Voyager isn't searching for life-sustaining water; they're farting around a planet with interesting geology.  The crew isn't off the ship because they've been in a can for 10 months and desperately need shore leave; Neelix thought there would be some tasty roots he could throw in next week's stew.  They aren't searching the nebula because without replenishing energy reserves they're toast in the next firefight; they want a few extra replicator rations so Janeway can have coffee."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,SStuart,8,Fri Jun 26 04:36:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the basic needs of a starship should have also come into play. Entire arcs could have been written about Voyager searching for food, fuel and faster travel. Other episodes could have been written about members of the crew being seduced by a M class planet and wanting to settle.   Or about being attacked by territorial aliens, or hiding from the Borg (note, not beating them every single time)"
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,mnky9800n,6,Fri Jun 26 15:06:36 2015 UTC,"To be fair, there is probably a seasons worth of episodes about the voyager crew doing something to make voyager faster."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,JayDanks,2,Fri Jun 26 15:30:47 2015 UTC,"The problem is that there's no development there, it's all just issue of the week that is ultimately pointless because of the reset button. Everything burns out offscreen and we only hear about it in a log entry, or it doesn't work with Federation technology right off the bat, or is ignored because nobody wants to cross galaxies in an instant if it runs the risk of being a frog for a few hours.  A ""make the ship faster arc"" wouldn't have tech of the week, they would have focused on one thing, say, quantum slipstream or transwarp, and had that story develop over the years. Have episodes where the Doctor and Torres try to genetically engineer a better type of gelpack so the computer can respond to slipstream faster. Maybe a few episodes where Janeway dives down the rabbit hole of piracy against the Borg, stealing transwarp coil after transwarp coil? Or an episode where Seven tries to make one from scratch? That makes an arc. The endless ""new fast tech of the week"" is just variations of a theme."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,mnky9800n,3,Sat Jun 27 04:11:22 2015 UTC,"Well yeah. I always thought that episode where chakotay and Kim get home but no one else does would have made for an excellent story arc for maybe half a season. There is so much going on in that episode and its a great story. But alas, we will never see a serialized voyager show."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,chocoboat,3,Sat Jun 27 16:39:45 2015 UTC,"While that all initially sounds like a good idea, I'm not sure how well it would play out on screen. Voyager's energy and resource reserves would keep fluctuating from full to low to desperate and back to full again, and this cycle would keep repeating. And the viewers would have to keep track of it, ""wait, are they low again?""  Or, the concept would just get old and the writers would stop using the low resources angle at all for several seasons, making viewers wonder what happened to that part of their life in the Delta Quadrant, only to have it suddenly matter again in the final season.  Dwindling resources and constantly needing to find more... it just didn't need to be done. But I definitely would have liked to see some effort to not just hit the reset button after every hour... for instance if Voyager gets damaged and barely survives a fight, maybe in the next episode they're trading with an alien race in change for getting some repairs done. Just some little efforts to remind us that they're far from home."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,jrs100000,5,Mon Jun 29 02:56:32 2015 UTC,"Many of these ideas are easy to pick apart in retrospect, but would not have been nearly as clear at the time the series concept, ship design, character profiles, and first dozen scripts were being pieced together while DS9 was struggling next to TNG.  Watching the first half season of Voyager, its pretty easy to imagine earlier script versions of the stories that were darker and far more desperate, until some producer ran into the office with last weeks Nielsen ratings and ordered a round of rewrites to make everything brighter, happier, and more like TNG."

DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,drafterman,8,Fri Jun 26 16:53:01 2015 UTC,"The problem, I think, is that DS9 was already doing the ""darker and edgier"" thing and it's arguable whether - at the time - that would have been seen as a good thing. From a production perspective, it wouldn't make sense to have two shows about mixed-crews beyond the warm embrace of the Federation, dealing with a hostile environment that surrounds them. Even though that's what each show was (generally) about, I think it stands to reason that they had to take Voyager in a different direction, otherwise: why watch it?"
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,MexicanSpaceProgram,12,Fri Jun 26 11:05:13 2015 UTC,"Oh definitely, plus there's many more advantages:   No Neelix (worth it just for this). No Chakotay akoochimoya pseudo-Indian vision quest crap. No holodecks, so no stupid Fair Haven episodes, or that Captain Proton crap. No magic reset button at the end if each episode (given the state of the Equinox when a pristine Voyager runs into them). Much more grey morality, instead of Janeway arbitrarily making decisions for a crew based on principles that half of them never signed on to defend with their lives."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,convertedtoradians,8,Fri Jun 26 08:22:42 2015 UTC,"I thought Chakotay was a potentially interesting character. He certainly could have played a much greater role in the ongoing story. Consider: A Voyager without the magic reset button would need to have a more... well... a more maquis way of looking at the galaxy, just as Chakotay himself suggests in Alliances. It'd have been nice to see Janeway coming to realise she has to listen to him as he starts to come to terms with his bitterness over his past with Starfleet."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,BloodBride,8,Fri Jun 26 11:03:09 2015 UTC,"Captain Proton   Hey, you hush your mouth, those were golden. Not sure it was Star Trek, but it was good.     I honestly agree with the rest though - They should have had an accurate stock of the ship's shuttles and torpedoes, which they have no way to replace. They should have actually kept rationing up, made it so people can't take a sonic shower because we need to maintain heading, shutting off decks to save power... And Year of Hell should have been a season, and the damage incurred both here and in Scorpion (borgifying the hull) should have stayed. I want to see a battle-scarred voyager, limping home, using a recovered alien shuttlecraft to go dilithium mining and having to use borg implants on the hull because if we remove them the ship will literally fall apart."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,TheWalruss,8,Fri Jun 26 09:33:28 2015 UTC,"I think Enterprise did a decent job of this in the second and third seasons. It got rough! The ship was no longer pretty! They were on the verge of collapse, and yet the crew did not compromise their ideals!"

DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,just_an_ordinary_guy,6,Fri Jun 26 21:04:20 2015 UTC,"Conveniently, I just watched these episodes today,  so it is still fresh in my mind.  Really, I think the main purpose of these episodes were to act as a foil to voyager.  To maybe hint at what humanity is still capable of when cornered.  However, I still think that the voyager crew still is a bit too haughty.  They've definitely walked that ethical edge, and if pushed as hard as the equinox was, probably would have done something similar.  Maybe not turning sentient creatures into warp goo, but definitely exploiting species for maximum gain.  As far as the show itself, even voyager would work.  You just need the challenges to be proportional.  We never really get the feeling that voyager is in real peril.  The ""coffee in that nebula"" works out great, but it would be nice if it could be reflected upon later as ""woefully naive"" when voyager goes through hell."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,BloodBride,8,Fri Jun 26 06:30:24 2015 UTC,"The reason Voyager didn't have that struggle and that they had all the luxuries of home is meant to be the implication that the ship becomes home - Either due to social bonding or stockholm syndrome, it's up for debate, but the point was that the ship itself carried with it the spirit of the Federation, with those values. It was going to have to be a generational ship (Janeway and Chakotay discuss this after catching someone making out in a turbolift) - Those born aboard Voyager don't call the Alpha quadrant home. They'd call Voyager home. The Borg that were rescued, while eventually leaving save for Seven, 'grew' on Voyager in the fact they developed. Even Neelix was on board with staying with Voyager, not knowing WHAT he'd do when he got to the Alpha quadrant. He left when he found a new purpose, but he was along with the idea of staying with Voyager for many years. The whole point is that Voyager isn't really travelling home. It didn't matter if they reached the Alpha quadrant again. They were home, but were exploring and sharing the ideals of the Federation with those who would listen.    Equinox would've been one or two seasons of grim-dark loss after loss, followed by a throwing out of Federation values and a murder spree. It'd be unpopular and against everything Star Trek has ever been for. Saying that, I do love the ship's design."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,BloodBride,5,Fri Jun 26 09:28:01 2015 UTC,"It was going to have to be a generational ship   One of the many problems I have with Voyager (that isn't brought up in the above) is that in fact everyone seems to realize that they'll be home in a few years. With a few rare mentions, nobody is like ""Okay, we need to make some new crewmembers, because I'll be in my 90s by the time we're scheduled to make it back home.""  The handful of characters that are actually the children of the ship -- Naomi, Seven, the borg kids -- are the exceptions. And they are very exceptional exceptions, and are treated as such.  So that's the crux of the issue to me -- nobody on Voyager ever treats the situation as dire as it really is. Sometimes it gets mentioned, but it's only a mention, or the focus of a single episode."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,bordersnothing,3,Fri Jun 26 16:24:08 2015 UTC,"This was the weakness - they had this killer plot that in the first season seemed to be a real issue... Then it went away. If they stuck to their guns, we'd have seen a much more... different show. One where perhaps they had to recruit crewmembers kind of like a pirate ship - less than reputable sorts with nowhere else to turn and runaways from other civilisations that they trade safety with for service."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,lyraseven,2,Fri Jun 26 16:39:16 2015 UTC,"That was something that got to me about Voyager.  They almost never recruited crew or passengers from the characters they'd run across.  Someone or another is seeking asylum?  Hey, take them along, new blood for the cast.  Or I guess you could just drop them off on the next planet like that if you want the boring option. . ."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,Vuliev,9,Fri Jun 26 22:07:51 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. However, I would suggest that the difference between Voyager and Equinox is largely semantic: the writers approve of Voyager and not of Equinox, therefore the crew also do, and thus we are supposed to agree.  Voyager engages in as much shady dealing as Equinox, if not quite resorting to murder-farms. They're certainly willing to betray lesser principles when it suits them.   As far as captains go, Janeway might not have engaged in cold-blooded, entirely avoidable murder every other episode, but it wasn't as rare as all that (Tuvix). As OP says, she also wasn't slow to resort to threats when she was in a superior position, and as we all know, Janeway rarely bluffs, because a bluff would require her to back down if called (Scientific Method).  One week it's abhorrent to suggest trading technology to less advanced races, the next it's fine to give it away. Janeway trades replicator and holodeck technologies, each with at least one other race, and each a decided strategic advantage should the Federation ever have trouble with a Delta quadrant race in future exploration.  One week sentient holograms have full and equal rights with organic sentients, the next they're part of the ship. Captain Janeway flip-flops on this one in a big way at least three times that I can recall, and at no point bothers to avail herself of precedent, e.g. Measure of a Man.  One week the Temporal Prime Directive is sacrosanct, the next... ""the code is more of what ye'd call 'guidelines'"" as far as Janeway in particular is concerned - Endgame, Timeless, Relativity .  One week Voyager is a part of and representative of Starfleet and hence its mandate to protect the Federation even at the cost of their own lives, convenience, comfort or hope of getting home... the next she's consorting with, and allowing on board, Romulans (simultaneously ignoring the Temporal Prime Directive, in a twofer) - Eye of the Needle.  Voyager's list of crimes and hypocrisies is long and I'm sure we're all individually familiar with most of them. Her crew are guilty of many Janeway-specific crimes by association and carrying out her orders, and individually guilty of many themselves (Tuvok in Prime Factors, known criminal Tom Paris in Thirty Days). The biggest difference between Voyager and Equinox, then, is that we're likely compromised by our attachment to Voyager's crew - or at least, if not attachment then certainly biased by our privileged fly-on-the-wall access to their situation.  Viewed in that light - how I've always viewed Voyager, and have been surprised that not everyone does since I was pre-teenaged - Janeway going all Captain Ahab on the Equinox says more about her than anyone else, and suggests that she knows exactly how little different they are."

Janeway trades replicator and holodeck technologies, each with at least one other race, and each a decided strategic advantage should the Federation ever have trouble with a Delta quadrant race in future exploration.   I don't remember the replicator trade, but I do remember the holodeck trade since I just rewatched ""The Killing Game"" recently.  Holodecks, a strategic advantage?  I'm sorry, but Janeway's magnanimous olive branch at the end of ""The Killing Game"" is an almost perfect example of a cultural victory.  The crew fights the Hirogen to a standstill via subterfuge and deception--earning them respect from the Hirogen in the process--and then Janeway convinces the new Hirogen alpha to continue in his predecessors footsteps.  And lo and behold, it works!  We see the Hirogen again in ""Flesh and Blood"", and they seem to have taken to the alpha's new vision with gusto.  Too much gusto, perhaps, but Voyager and the Doctor manage to sort things out (kinda.)   One week sentient holograms have full and equal rights with organic sentients, the next they're part of the ship. Captain Janeway flip-flops on this one in a big way at least three times that I can recall, and at no point bothers to avail herself of precedent, e.g. Measure of a Man.   Interesting that you provide episode references for your other points, and not for this one.  To my recollection, Janeway and the crew do not backtrack at all as their understanding of the Doctor as a sentient being increases.  As a matter of fact, when the Doctor offers his mobile emitter to Janeway as punishment for his actions *in ""Flesh and Blood"", the following exchange takes place:  EMH: You've given me extraordinary freedom over the years. I've obviously abused it.  JANEWAY: Maybe. Or maybe you've simply become as fallible as those of us who are made of flesh and blood. I'm just as responsible for allowing you to expand your programming as I am for giving technology to the Hirogen. How can I punish you for being who you are?   Seems to me like pretty wholehearted acceptance for him as a sentient being.   One week the Temporal Prime Directive is sacrosanct, the next... ""the code is more of what ye'd call 'guidelines'"" as far as Janeway in particular is concerned - Endgame, Timeless, Relativity .   ""Endgame"" is the only time-travel episode that involves Janeway deliberately screwing with the timeline.  Everything else is Janeway getting dragged quite unwillingly into temporal shenanigans, and usually cleaning them up in the process.  ""Timeless"" is Harry going crazy with guilt over completely botching the quantum slipstream corrections--nothing to do with Janeway.  ""Relativity"" is instigated by Captain Braxton, not Janeway.  In point of fact, Janeway is instrumental in cornering Braxton, and is the one that ultimately brings Braxton into custody.  And while we're on the subject of Braxton, he is the one responsible for making himself go crazy enough to place the temporal distruptor on Voyager.  In ""Future's End"", it is his actions that are ultimately responsible for the temporal explosion and his exile on 20th century Earth, and it is Janeway and the Voyager crew that thwart the temporal explosion.   One week Voyager is a part of and representative of Starfleet and hence its mandate to protect the Federation even at the cost of their own lives, convenience, comfort or hope of getting home... the next she's consorting with, and allowing on board, Romulans (simultaneously ignoring the Temporal Prime Directive, in a twofer) - Eye of the Needle.   Since when is it a crime to talk with the Romulans?  I get that Tal Shiar agents could be anywhere, but the Romulan scientist helps Janeway clean up the signal and test out the transportation of his own free will.  They don't realize that the wormhole has a temporal displacement until he has arrived on the ship, and he promises to wait the 23 years before informing Starfleet of Voyager's location.  He doesn't get the message through because he dies 5 years too early, but nonetheless he admirably upholds temporal continuity.  I find it incredibly hard to believe that any Starfleet admiral would fault Janeway or the crew for their actions in ""Eye of the Needle"", especially not when there are ships like the Equinox that slaughter intelligent beings out of desperation.   and suggests that she knows exactly how little different they are.   Yeah, she does--the bit at the end where she puts the ship's commissioning plaque back on the wall is a ham-fisted bit of metaphor for her and the crew almost losing themselves to the same baser emotions and instincts that overcame the Equinox crew.  But you know what the between the Voyager and Equinox crews is?  The Voyager crew didn't slaughter intelligent beings out of instinctual desperation for survival."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,Vuliev,5,Fri Jun 26 14:15:26 2015 UTC,"Holodecks, a strategic advantage?   The ability to simulate any situation isn't to be underestimated. It affords us a rate of scientific and technological progress we couldn't match otherwise (key to USS Voyager's development of the Delta Flyer and trans-warp research) without great risk to life, not to mention logistical difficulty. Giving it away gives that same advantage to others.  Likewise, while we under-use it at the Academy (perhaps from snobbery), it's the Holy Grail of training. The Hirogen certainly saw its use in that regard, at least.  Finally, and most importantly, don't forget that holodeck technology incorporates replicator, shield and transporter technology. In teaching the Hirogen how to build holodecks, Janeway handed over the key to all those technologies with a species which, for all its racism, doesn't exist in a vacuum and may be less willing to forgo tempting trade opportunities, whether or not they'd be our enemies if we meet again.   Interesting that you provide episode references for your other points, and not for this one. To my recollection, Janeway and the crew do not backtrack at all as their understanding of the Doctor as a sentient being increases.   As many instances of holo-racism occur throughout Voyager's travels, most of them Janeway's, and within stories that aren't necessarily about the Doctor or sentient AI rights, it would involve going all the way through Voyager and noting every instance of racism occurring to provide a full account of the crew's flip-flopping on that issue. As such, I assumed that everyone remembers at least a few instances and instead provided a reference to a case with which at least some of Voyager's crew would be familiar and should have learned from. I'm not going to undertake the above mammoth task, not for some time at least, but I can tell you just a year prior, after the entire simulated ancient Earth village she had so irresponsibly allowed to run indefinitely gained sentience, she had no ethical problem ordering her crew to meddle with the 'mind' of one of them for her own convenience (Spirit Folk)  In the same year, the crew treat the Doctor's mobile emitter like a resource belonging to the ship and not a physical aid which the Doctor requires to exist outside of sickbay or the holodeck, barely bothering to obtain the Doctor's obviously uncomfortable consent (which should never have been asked, any more than one would ask to borrow a cripple person's crutch). They give the emitter to the Reg Barclay simulation, which could have just as easily been confined to the holodeck and able to complete its work and, unlike the Doctor, wasn't even sentient (Inside Man).  Plus, in the conversation you quoted, look at how the Doctor views his freedom - like a privilege, not a right. He speaks as though his treatment is more than he should expect, rather than his basic right, something which was established long ago in Measure of a Man. He doesn't mention the many times his right to self-determination was treated as something which can be given and taken away at will.  Note that the Voyager crew may well have gotten over its deeper prejudices toward the Doctor by that point; I said they (and Janeway) flip-flopped constantly, which I'm sure you'll agree is a fair assessment even if you feel that in the end they 'got better' (though I'm doubtful).   ""Endgame"" is the only time-travel episode that involves Janeway deliberately screwing with the timeline.    Here are a few examples of Janeway's reckless disregard for the integrity of the timeline.  In Eye of the Needle Janeway divulges details of the present to a Romulan from the past in an attempt to change the present. This is a violation of the Temporal Prime Directive and could have had catastrophic consequences had the Romulan not thankfully died.   In Relativity, a future Seven of Nine pleads the Temporal Prime Directive to a past Janeway who - and I'm going to cite the wiki on this, because it's gold: 'doesn't care and demands answers'. Sure, in the end it turned out that whole issue was caused by a rogue Time Agent, but Janeway didn't know that.  Likewise in Future's End, was caused by Janeway's refusal to obey legitimate orders from someone equal in rank, of unknown seniority, in command of the obviously tactically superior vessel (disobeying the very rule she quotes to domineer Captain Ransom of the Equinox not much time later) and clearly far, far better informed on what was going on. As in Relativity, in the end it turns out things would have worked out had Braxton not become involved, but she had no way of knowing that and it was pure pig-headedness that led her to disobey. She was entirely responsible for the events of Future's End, leading to Braxton spending decades on ancient Earth and suffering debilitating mental illness.  Janeway displayed contempt for the Temporal Prime Directive on multiple occasions. 'All's well that ends well' is not an excuse, and nor is the fact that one of the occasions which seemed like a legal use of temporal technology by the future Federation authority turned out not to be.   The Voyager crew didn't slaughter intelligent beings out of instinctual desperation for survival.   Janeway personally murdered Tuvix.  Also, while we can't be sure of any actual murders, Janeway certainly initiated unprovoked combat for spurious, unethical reasons on a regular basis, and could have hurt or killed 'enemy' crewmen in doing so - see the start of Year of Hell, where she decides to invade sovereign space because it's convenient, despite being ordered to leave. Or how about Extreme Risk, in which she threatens a Malon vessel should they seize a probe involved in the destruction of one of their own vessels.   The list goes on. Janeway was a natural disaster and had no respect for any rules but her own."

Your last point, however, I cannot let slide:    Janeway personally murdered Tuvix.   AND THE CREW OF THE EQUINOX COMMITTED DELIBERATE AND CALCULATED  GENOCIDE.  GENOCIDE.  All to get home faster out of complete submission to their basic instincts.  Janeway performed the reversal procedure herself on Tuvix so that the burden of the decision was on her.  She did it for the greater good of her ship and crew.  Why is that so different than Sisko's admission at the end of ""In The Pale Moonlight"", something that (from what I've seen on the sub) quite a few people will readily accept and defend?"
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,calgil,3,Fri Jun 26 19:24:20 2015 UTC,"Janeway performed the reversal procedure herself on Tuvix so that the burden of the decision was on her.   Actually, she did it because the Doctor - a hologram programmed with the entire medico-ethical history of the Federation and likely many more cultures besides - refused to. Because it was murder.   She did it for the greater good of her ship and crew.    No, that's what Captain Ransom did. The crew of Voyager would have gotten by without Tuvok. Indeed, Tuvix had his memories and by all indications was an excellent, well-liked crew member.   Also Neelix was in there too.   Why is that so different than Sisko's admission at the end of ""In The Pale Moonlight"", something that (from what I've seen on the sub) quite a few people will readily accept and defend?   Well, that's another thread, isn't it? We're comparing two specific criminals, not every criminal to every other criminal."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,lyraseven,2,Fri Jun 26 19:33:17 2015 UTC,"I dare say the murder of Tuvix was worse than what the Equinox did...it wasn't for survival, it was because she didn't like Tuvix as much as she liked Tuvok and Neelix. That's it."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,tetefather,6,Fri Jun 26 19:52:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I'd even say that the rest of the crew standing by to let her murder Tuvix was much like how some of Equinox's crew were willing to stand by and let Ransom subject aliens to a literal-definition-of-the-word holocaust.  The difference is, Ransom was so far gone he'd likely have beamed anyone who physically tried to stop him into space. Janeway would have settled for the brig. Still no one tried to stop her.  Even the Doctor didn't relieve her of command - though it's possible that the EMH protocol doesn't allow it to, as no one ever foresaw an EMH becoming CMO. Still, he tried in Year of Hell (though was threatened by Janeway in response). Maybe he just hadn't thought of it by Tuvix, or maybe he knew nothing could stop Janeway, much less someone else she'd have no compunctions about murdering."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,philwelch,16,Fri Jun 26 20:07:19 2015 UTC,I really would hate to watch 7 seasons of Starfleet officers betray everything their uniform stands for. There is a reason why people love Star Trek and that's not abandoning your hard fought principles the moment you are placed out of context.   Starfleet and the Federation stands for something. That something is why we love star trek and Janeway did a great job holding together when she could have easily fallen pray to her inner demons. That was the main struggle Voyager went through and it was awe inspiring. THAT'S why we love Star Trek.
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,tetefather,12,Fri Jun 26 07:15:27 2015 UTC,"I really would hate to watch 7 seasons of Starfleet officers betray everything their uniform stands for.   It's really easy to never betray your principles if your principles aren't really tested. ""Equinox,"" in that sense, is exceptionally dark because it presents the idea that the only thing that kept Voyager from betraying their principles is the fact that they had it easy.  What would have been far more interesting, and far more hopeful, is presenting stories in which Voyager's crew has to make real sacrifices in order to remain true to the principles of the Federation and Starfleet, but those sacrifices are worth it because they're the right thing to do.  Instead, what we got was seven seasons of Voyager easily meandering through space. And in the end they won the day by Janeway radically violating Federation law and ethics in order to save her friends. So much for that. We could have saved a lot of time if Janeway had just given the Ocampa some phaser rifles and taken the Caretaker Array back home. Wouldn't have been much of a difference."

DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,tetefather,7,Fri Jun 26 12:56:17 2015 UTC,"But the problem with Voyager is that we really never see the crew tested. They're always on a nice clean starship with seemingly limitless supplies. Even for 24th Century tech, this always seemed to stretch the credibility of the franchise. Shuttles, torpedoes, even human resources were seemingly bottomless. Why be in such a rush to get home, Voyager seemed to have it all!  The only time we ever see the crew actually tested was the ""year of hell"" story which actually never happened by virtue of a reset.   Truly awful writing and plot development."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,Plowbeast,2,Fri Jun 26 15:00:02 2015 UTC,"They've been tested a few times. There was a really cool episode that I've always loved where the ship has been taken over by giant bugs. Neelix and Janeway are the main focus in the episode and they are also the 2 most hated characters in the series. They did great in this episode though, and shit gets pretty dire."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,tetefather,2,Fri Jun 26 18:54:22 2015 UTC,I see your point. But I think the only fault of the writers was not to go into further detail on how voyager was able to procure supplies.
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,denaissance,5,Fri Jun 26 15:38:11 2015 UTC,"It's not just the details like the torpedo count but it's how they wrote the stories on a basic level.  In Battlestar Galactica, we had water shortages, multiple coups, political disagreements, breakdowns in military discipline, food shortages, fuel shortages, and so on.  Voyager on the other hand had one and a half episodes about crew discipline (if you count the one where Seven of Nine convinced Chakotay and Janeway of her conspiracy theory) and maybe double that about fuel shortages."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,williams_482,2,Fri Jun 26 15:50:53 2015 UTC,I understand that but you also have to consider the vast difference of technology between the series. Replicator technology alone allows for basically every convenience at the cost of power which only requires deuterium which is a very easily procurable substance.
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,tetefather,2,Fri Jun 26 16:39:51 2015 UTC,Deuterium is the matter part of the matter+anti-matter reaction. You still need to get anti-matter from somewhere.
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,SStuart,0,Fri Jun 26 18:21:18 2015 UTC,"Deuterium is the primary fuel for fusion reactors as well, a far more sustainable power source which should provide more than enough energy to keep the crew eating, drinking, and breathing out of the replicators. The efficiency of fusion reactors and the extreme ease of finding deuterium (a hydrogen isotope found in large quantities in seawater, among other places) combined with replicator technology is the primary reason why Earth was able to become a post scarcity society. The abundance of deuterium pretty explicitly stated in The Void:    PARIS: Why would anyone steal deuterium? You can find it anywhere.    You can't run a warp 9.975 engine with on-board fusion reactors. Fortunately, it is possible (in the Star Trek universe, at least) to synthesize anti-deuterium, although the process is highly inefficient."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,tetefather,0,Sat Jun 27 02:50:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, although the matter/anti-matter mix ratio is always 1:1, they never seem to have problems with anti matter shortages. This leads me to believe that they can very easily replace it via the replicators or something."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,SStuart,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:11:43 2015 UTC,"you are saying the entire point of the show was moot? At the beginning of the series, everyone on Voyager seemed terrified of what a nightmare the Delta Quadrant would be. The entire series is driven by the need to get home.   From a dramatic perspective, there just isn't any tension because the stakes don't seem that high. Frankly, the living conditions as depicted aboard Voyager are superior to most people in the United States. Crewmembers have access to holodecks, a nice climate controlled luxurious ship that is never dirty, replicators, etc.   How can their be in drama if the status quo is already tolerable. Would it really have been that bad if Voyager spent a few more years in the delta quadrant? meh."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,belovedlasher1,2,Sun Jun 28 05:52:56 2015 UTC,"The point of the show was to keep the principles intact. The point of the crew/ship was to get home.   Ofcourse you're going to have those luxuries. Federation has earned those luxuries. The technology is what enables Starfleet to have such a high tolerance to ethically lower species.   Even though they had so many comforts on the ship, I believe they went through enough distress."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,SStuart,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:54:30 2015 UTC,"What? Let's review...  The Premise: The producers/writers set up a wonderful premise: A small ship with very limited resources (explicitly stated by Janeway several times) is stranded on the other side of the Galaxy. The existing crew is basically a skeleton, with very little institutional knowledge on how to run the ship. Borg are everywhere. Even more interesting, the Starfleet crew has to share Voyager with the unpredictable/rebellious Maquis.   Oh Wow! sounds interesting!!  The Result: The small little ship actually has unlimited resources. The crew is comfortable, fuel is basically unlimited, it goes pretty fast (faster than the big ships it turns out!), crewman die and are replaced without incident. The Maquis basically become SF officers overnight. None of the characters develop/change due to the stress/trauma of being lost in the Delta Quadrant, the supposedly shorthanded ship bashes the Borg, without consequence.   All the drama evaporates. I can explain each failing in more detail below:  Supplies/Resources: One of the premises of a ""lost in space show"" is the tension that surrounds finite resources. The Enterprise was never a few days travel from a Starbase, so it was believable that it was always well supplied. In fact, whenever the ship endured battle damage it always headed to the nearest starbase for repair. After the Borg incident, for example, it was estimated that the ship would require several weeks of fixing.   But Voyager, doesn't realize this. In fact, the ship basically operates like it were in the Federation. Even starfleet ships need resupply, at least they did until Voyager. No shuttles, no problem just make some more!!  The Little Ship: Another central component of Voyager was the ""little ship."" This wouldn't be a big Galaxy Class that could do everything. This would increase the tension even more.   Well, it turns out that Voyager was basically a Galaxy Class. The ship seemed just as nice and advanced. No tension.  The Maquis: Janeway is forced to combine her crew with the rebellious maquis. She even makes her first officer the Maquis captain. Surely this would mean a great deal of tension between the crews, as one was literally sent to capture the other! Nope, by episode 3 they're all one big happy family. No drama there either.   The Borg: The Borg, the Federation's most dangerous adversary, basically live in the Delta Quadrant. It's there home. An entire season could have been devoted to Voyager traversing Borg Space. But surely if one cube could decimate an entire Federation fleet, then Voyager (see little ship) would have no chance at a direct confrontation. So, Voyager should have centered on Janeway hiding from the Borg. Well, nope, Janeway not only confront's the Borg, but she beats them every time.   The Skeleton Crew: With such a small and mismatched crew, surely the loss of even one (see LT. Carey) would be felt tremendously. Can the EMH really do it all? Well, it didn't matter because the show had a seemingly unlimited amount of well disciplined crew members to take their place. Compare this with Battlestar Galactica that literally had to train new pilots by the second season.  Not only is this absurd, but it also seems that the show has no sense of consequence or implication. Can the Borg just retaliate against Janeway by attacking the Federation? Assimilating Vulcan, for example? It would seem that provoking the Borg (see Unimatrix zero) would be a bad thing. Not to Voyager!  This is why Voyager is the worst SF show by a mile. The premise was excellent, but I've never seen a show fail to live up to it's potential (or ignore logic) in such a grand fashion. The franchise never recovered from Voyager."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,Dissidence802,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:40:16 2015 UTC,"On supplies and resources, nearly every other episode of Voyager starts out with them looking for fuel, an M-class planet for food, etc. Personally, I don't care to see them constantly doing repairs (DS9) or squaring away food. Episodes span 24 hours to 4 days with an exception of a few that are much longer. Averaging 3 days span for 26 episodes per season 3 x 26 = 78. 78 of action with 287 of unseen events. Honestly, I think that they may have been savaging parts to replace shuttles and the like on their journey. I didn't find it important for them to implicitly show what repairs or builds that were constantly done. Doing so would have been incredibly boring, but that's my opinion. Voyager was my favorite Star Trek."

Can you name me five?  I love Star Trek, but Battle Star Galactica mopped the floor with Voyager. Yes, technology is different, but when has that stopped Star Trek writers in the past? Simply put, Voyager is just a lazily produced show that had a great premise but a yawn-inducing product."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,Dissidence802,3,Mon Jun 29 18:26:00 2015 UTC,"this raises the interesting question of why the Caretaker would take two Federation ships, if he was looking for a species to mate with and presumably he had already gotten a good look at Humans.   Although all of the crew shown in the episode were Human, Equinox originally had ~80 crewmen. It's reasonable to assume that various other species were on board that weren't present on Voyager."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,velvetlev,3,Fri Jun 26 10:32:33 2015 UTC,"Also, it's not clear how much, if any, knowledge the Caretaker had of what was on the other end of his space scoop."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,bordersnothing,3,Fri Jun 26 22:17:42 2015 UTC,"Actually, now that I think about it, canon supports the Caretaker having basically zero knowledge of who was onboard the ships he abducted. He snagged Dreadnought, which obviously had no crew to speak of.  More likely he was just shooting the displacement wave around randomly out of desperation, and hoping for the best with whatever craft it happened to snag."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,Eagle_Ear,3,Fri Jun 26 22:31:38 2015 UTC,Stargate universe comes to mind. It has the same trapped far from home presence and the stakes are life and death for the whole crew in many episodes. There is a mixed crew with regard to values. If it weren't for a few of the characters having such steriotypical behaviour it would be my favourite scifi.   With regards to Voyager I read that since ds9 was going to go on a war path with high stakes and long story arcs that Voyager wasn't going to be the same but take an episodical approach. Unfortunately the episodic approach requires that the ship remain in relatively the same state so that viewers don't have to follow every episode.   It is annoying however that the format held back Voyager from reaching it's potential. If only it didn't run alongside ds9.
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,Roderick111,3,Fri Jun 26 20:51:23 2015 UTC,"With regards to Voyager I read that since ds9 was going to go on a war path with high stakes and long story arcs that Voyager wasn't going to be the same but take an episodical approach. Unfortunately the episodic approach requires that the ship remain in relatively the same state so that viewers don't have to follow every episode.    A lot of the responses to my original post are about how Voyager needed to be less serialized, maybe a bit less serious or ""dark"" (I don't think that a more limited Voyager would be more ""dark,"" but that's a very detailed discussion about the nature of storytelling I guess), because DS9 was on the air and was doing more serialized and more serious political stuff.  When you think about it, that's not really a good reason to do a show that way. It presupposes that there is going to be -- needs to be -- another Star Trek show on the air (I mean I get that it's a business, but jeez I'd like to think that Star Trek comes from an artistic vision or something).  It seems to me that if this was the thinking in circa 1993 when they were putting the show together, then the deeper thinking from the producers was ""Well, TNG has done really well for a spinoff television show sold in first-run syndication based on a cancelled sci-fi program from the late 60s, but it's getting a bit too expensive to keep these actors around for another few years, so let's just do TNG again but with newer, cheaper actors!"" And if that's the ultimate reason you're doing a show -- the same reason countless mediocre sitcoms and procedural dramas have been made since the dawn of television: just to make money -- then I think it's kind of doomed to mediocrity.  Like, what is the point of doing this grand ""we're lost in an unknown part of the galaxy, and we don't know when we're going to get home, but we're constantly searching for a way back"" setting when you're not going to use it? If it's just so you don't have to deal with the shit on DS9, then you've already failed. Just do a different show and don't call it ""Star Trek."" But, the executives say, the ""Star Trek"" brand is Paramount's biggest prize, and of course it needs to be exploited, so just get it done and make a show and try to put all the pieces in place to make it as successful as TNG. But at that point you're not doing art -- you're just churning out product, and that's a little sad for a series that once prided itself on being the only serious science fiction venue on television.  It's not like episodic television is bad or that serialization is necessary for a show to be good, but you need a focus that is not ""let's make a successful Star Trek show that will make us some money"" but rather ""let's make some good television."" And I think for the most part Voyager and Enterprise fell very much in the ""we're doing this because we have to"" category."
DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,molasses,2,Fri Jun 26 21:33:34 2015 UTC,A big issue with the varying tone of DS9 and Voyager was the showrunners involved.  Ira Steven Behr (DS9) was much more interested in taking things apart and putting them back together.  He was interested in Federation values but he wanted to see where they came from and what happened when people had to bend their principles.  The producers (Berman) really hated his direction but Behr stuck to his guns.  There was a tighter rein and more traditional story-telling on Voyager.  Everything was kept light and straightforward.

One of the few times is in VOY season 2 in ""Resistance""   Its one of the few times we see Voyager so desperate for supplies (in this case energy) that they are barely maintaining orbit.

DaystromInstitute,3b56zb,DMPunk,2,Fri Jun 26 21:01:53 2015 UTC,"I'd agree that some of the same elements were involved, but only in the most general way, and not in any way that really mattered (example: Conceivably the ""limited supplies"" thing would matter, but there's that one episode in which the magic replicator shipyard repairs the Enterprise, right? But then the very next episode is the one in which Archer's dog gets sick and he throws a little fit about it and almost loses a spare part they really need. What happened to the supplies they got from the evil robot station? The limited supplies mattered to both of those stories, but they weren't connected in any appreciable way. They're just some stuff that happens to a bunch of idiots).  You're right in that the most important thing is necessarily the writing, but the writers' job can be made easier through the situation they're put into. I think the Voyager writers and producers made their job more difficult by, in some ways, writing themselves into a corner before the show even started."
DaystromInstitute,3b6e7z,Hellstrike,10,Fri Jun 26 10:01:20 2015 UTC,"I feel like you're basing your statements on some slightly wonky assumptions. Firstly, I'm not sure of the exact figures used by deflector shields in the Star Trek universe, but your example from the Halo universe of using 6,000 ton projectiles would be essentially made moot because even ships navigational deflectors are capable of moving small asteroids out of a ships path with relative ease. Anything larger can easily be handled by a ships main shields or tractor beams. Contrary to popular belief, Borg ships DO have shields, except they're not concentrated graviton fields deflect that incoming objects like Federation starships, they use a complex series of subspace fields to nullify incoming energy. That's what starships need to modulate the energy of their weapons to even score a hit. So presumably such a projectile would also bounce harmlessly off of a Borg cube. Also, given what we know about the velocities of starships, 12,000 km/s isn't really that fast, a ship could simply move out of the way, at impulse. Virtually every space-faring civilization in the galaxy uses energy/particle weapons. There must be a reason for this. Without getting too much into the possible theories, we can merely assume that kinetic weapon options have been explored, and dismissed by the weapon designers in the Star Trek universe as being either unfeasible or obsolete.  Second, thinking it through I don't think orbital weapons platforms would be as useful as you're suggesting. By their nature I would assume that such platforms would be (relative to the planet/installation they're protecting) stationary so they will be easy to attack from long range with (even unguided) weapons, and as space is three dimensional you'd need enough of them to defend from every direction lest you leave one or more vectors open to unchallenged attack. You could fit thrusters or engines on them so that they can maneuver, but at that point you've basically just made a fighter. During the prelude to the attempted assimilation of Earth (TNG: Best of Both Worlds pt2) we do see what appear to be several fighters moving to engage the Borg cube. It's unclear if this is within the Sol system itself or somewhere else along the route, but they are easily brushed aside by the cube. Meaning that the fighters will need more shielding to deal with large threats, meaning they'll need more power, meaning they'll probably need a matter/anti-matter engine to provide that power. If you've put a warp core on it why not give it warp nacelles so that it can quickly deploy itself all over the system? By this point I'm sure you see the point I'm trying to make. You've essentially just built a starship.  The only example we ever see of orbital defense platforms are in DS9, on two occasions if I remember correctly. First was at the Klingon planetoid of Ty'Gokor, and those weren't automated platforms but rather heavily armour space stations. It could be argued that the Earth Space Dock and other orbital facilities are sufficiently armed to fulfil this role. Perhaps they even attempted firing on the Borg cube once it arrived but it quickly adapted to their weapons fire and continuing the barrage would have been futile?  The other example of orbital weapons platforms in DS9 we see are Cardassian, first deployed in the Chin'toka system. They were protected by regenerative shielding and couple fire up to 1,000 plasma torpedoes each. Sounds formidable, but they had the draw back of needing immense amounts of power, which was supplied remotely from a large power plant on the nearby planet which they were defending. So the Cardassians traded stationary firepower for maneuverability, and even then it didn't work because the Federation and allies were able to trick the weapons into attacking their own power source! Fully crewed starships with their own independent power sources wouldn't have been susceptable to such a ruse. We have to consider the Cardassian motivations in creating these platforms, they were losing the war.  Desperately trying to hold on to territory on three fronts, being pushed back further and further into their own space. These platforms were a last ditch attempt at slowing (not stopping) the allied advance, because they no longer had the manufacturing capacity or resources to field a fully formed fleet of starships anymore. Their tactics had basically devolved into trying to concentrate as much firepower as cheaply as possible at strategic locations but it didn't work.  In conclusion, the benefits acquired from automated orbital defense platforms are negated or exceeded by traditonal starships. Orbital facilties do exist around Earth and are most likely armed, but for the cost of building an effective orbital defense strategy, it's more efficient just to build more starships."
DaystromInstitute,3b6e7z,BonzoTheBoss,5,Fri Jun 26 11:57:42 2015 UTC,"We have the Mars Defense Perimeter. As AmbassadorAtoz mentions in his response, if they make it into range of Earth orbiting defenses, it is probably too late."
DaystromInstitute,3b6e7z,denaissance,3,Fri Jun 26 15:20:51 2015 UTC,"In the Halo universe there are giant orbital defense platforms which fire 6000 ton heavy projectiles with a speed of 12000 km/s which have an impact force of 2.15*1020 J (not my math). I imagine that this impact force would do more than putting a dent in most ships, even Borg cubes.    Tractor beams and warp drive render unguided projectiles obsolete.  We see vessels weighing millions of tons successfully deflected on several occasions, and even a case where a vessel with functioning engines failed to resist this movement.  Larger projectiles should be simple to avoid using bursts of warp speed.   You could even use designs like the Russian Topol-M truck to carry a couple torpedoes which would be enough to discourage any invasion force from entering orbit.   Anyone who wasnt discouraged would have no choice but to lay waste to your planet when they were wiping out the surface defense platforms.     Starfleet is not a militaristic organization. But putting a couple platforms in Orbit or parking hundred trucks scattered across a planet wouldn't influence freedom of the citizens at all.   They do have orbital defenses, such as Spacedock.  Its just easy for a maneuvering opponent to attack the planet from a different angle and avoid your defenses altogether, or focus their attack on a limited area to punch a hole in the defense grid with minimal resistance.     It certainly is within the technological and logistical capabilities of the Federation. Such defense installations are certainly a massive improvement compared to the state of Earth's defense (compared to the battle of sector 001).   They certainly could, and most likely would, improve their static defense grids following the Dominion War.  However, static defenses would only be effective to detect, delay and channel enemy forces, working as a force multiplier for defending starships, not as a replacement."

Enter low orbit, ignoring sporadic ground fire from the 2-3 surface emplacements that happen to be within line of sight. Implement General Order 24.

DaystromInstitute,3b6e7z,KingofMadCows,3,Fri Jun 26 11:39:27 2015 UTC,"The problem with static defense, especially in space is that they're easy to circumvent if the enemy has some time to prepare.  The defenses at Chin'toka were able to inflict a lot of damage because the allied forces weren't expecting them. If instead, they were able to prepare for a siege, the defense alone could not have done much.  A simple way to overwhelm static defenses is to tractor in a bunch of asteroids and throw them at the planet. The defenses would be forced to shoot down the asteroids and ignore the enemy ships. This tactic could also be used to effectively divide the defenses. If the enemy launches asteroids at the planet from many directions at once, the defenses would have to be split to protect different sides of the planet while the enemy fleet can concentrate on one area.  So the main purpose of static defenses would be to delay the enemy until reinforcements arrive or to supplement ships in defending a planet. But they wouldn't be very effective defenses by themselves."

You will always need ships and men to perform the tasks such defenses aren't capable of.   /edit: Come to think of it, planetary defenses are the only reason i can think of that conquests of worlds do not always start with orbital bombardment. If i'd want to defeat the defence capability of any planet and they didn't have a good reason not to enter orbit i'd blast every single weapon on the planet's surface to atoms from orbit before even placing one single boot on the ground."
DaystromInstitute,3b6e7z,CaptainJeff,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:03:42 2015 UTC,"In Star Trek, if the enemy force is that close to a planet, the battle is lost. The planet will receive heavy bombardment, or worse.  It's trivial for a fleet of ships at warp to dodge anything traveling at sublight speeds, including photon torpedoes.  Photon torpedoes must to be fired at warp speeds in order to travel at warp speeds. Phasers (and other direct energy weapons, presumably) work poorly at warp.  The only way to reliably defend against a warp-capable enemy is with warp-capable ships.  EDIT: CaptainJeff is right to point out the Chin'toka case, I was mainly referring to situations where orbital bombardment would be really really bad (populated planets)!"

Many allied ships are right there at Chin'toka and the Orbital Weapons Platforms are very effective against those ships.  Warp speed doesn't work well within a system.

Presumably someone with a genetically enhanced intellect would have a better understanding of the period than any of us, and could find something worthwhile.  A few ideas from the 1st century AD:   Lions became extinct in Western Europe at some point in the 1st century.  Maybe Khan viewed something like ""man mastering nature"" as a significant enough event to mark a new era. Jesus was crucified in roughly 33 AD.  Maybe Khan considered ""killing a god"" to be a good starting point for marking what he viewed as a steady march away from religion. Rome begins conquest of the British Isles and London is founded (43 AD).  Huge events in the history of modern society. Sri Lanka sends an ambassador to Rome in the middle of the century.  Maybe Khan views this as the height of Roman influence.  The Empire also reaches its largest geographic size during this century. The 1st century is smack in the middle of the Han Dynasty in China, perhaps Khan sees some event in that period as the height of their influence.   There are ample events to choose from, especially if the post-religiosity theory is true -- from that viewpoint, Khan would view almost any event as more significant than some guy being born in a desert.    EDIT:  As for this questions:   Additionally, why would Phlox, Archer, and others use this Khanian calendar? It seems unlikely that the winners of the Eugenics wars would adapt the calendar system of their enemy.   It's been mentioned elsewhere that humans in later centuries still harbored respect for Khan, even if they ultimately disagreed with his actions.  It isn't too hard to imagine humanity keeping Khan's calendar system if A) it was recognized as better, B) it had already become universal, and C) he was viewed as ""the best of the tyrants"" anyway."

Archer never explicitly uses the 1996 date, and as I point out in my comment below, his remarks about his grandfather's service in the Eugenics Wars seems to imply a later date. As for Phlox -- perhaps he hasn't mastered human conventions of referring to centuries and meant ""the 2000s,"" which seems like a perfectly sensible referent for ""20th century."""
DaystromInstitute,3b66n7,adamkotsko,5,Fri Jun 26 13:03:56 2015 UTC,"Supporting this view is that Archer's reference to his grandfather's service in the Eugenics Wars (""Hatchery"") strongly implies a date later than the (Gregorian) 90s."
DaystromInstitute,3b66n7,BonzoTheBoss,7,Fri Jun 26 12:07:09 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. Between 1996 and 2154 there's 158 years. That's  enough time for four generations of a family. Also, Archer references his great-grandfather in Hatchery.   Archer: My great-grandfather was in North Africa during the Eugenics Wars."
DaystromInstitute,3b66n7,adamkotsko,3,Fri Jun 26 13:22:50 2015 UTC,That would require three consecutive generations of freakishly old reproduction.
DaystromInstitute,3b66n7,BonzoTheBoss,5,Fri Jun 26 13:26:32 2015 UTC,"Not really. 158 years, subtract Archer's 42 leave a combined 116 years. Divide that by three for his father, grandfather and great-grandfather and that gives them an average age of 39. Older to be having children but not unheard of, men stay fertile well into old age. The 10th President of the U.S. born in 1790 still has living grandchildren today.  Plus that's assuming they died at age 39, presumably they would have lived longer than that, opening up the window for fathering children further. Even if we take Archer's Great-Granfather out of the equation and divide those intervening years from 1996 to 2112 (when Jonathan was born) between his grandfather and father, that still gives them an average age of 58. Again, not beyond the realm of possibility of fathering children and far more plausible than an entirely alternate calendar system."
DaystromInstitute,3b66n7,adamkotsko,2,Fri Jun 26 13:41:05 2015 UTC,Three generations in a row of having children at 58 is just not going to happen.

What with the Eugenics Wars and then WWIII, maybe they simply didn't have time to start families until later in life!"
DaystromInstitute,3b66n7,adamkotsko,2,Fri Jun 26 13:57:01 2015 UTC,Wars traditionally reduce life expectancy and increase the urgency for those who are thinking of having kids.

DaystromInstitute,3b66n7,BubbaMetzia,7,Fri Jun 26 19:56:30 2015 UTC,"Since Khan was from India, he could have used the Saka calender, which starts in 78 AD on the Gregorian Calender. Which would mean that 1996 would be 2074."
DaystromInstitute,3b66n7,hummingbirdz,7,Mon Jun 29 15:15:09 2015 UTC,"This is a nice theory.  I'm wondering how far you propose shifting events forward?  How far from gregorian 1996 is khanian 1996? I'm going to try to work out some specific details.  If we assume gregorian 2063 is observed in First contact. Then the Eugenics wars must be in between and so must the khanian 1996.   If you shift by 20 years (about a generation), then khanian 1996 is next year and the Eugenics wars are already happening in our real timeline. WW3 canonically is in gregorian year 2026. So further shifts of the 1996 date would put khan's exodus after the Eugenics wars during WW3. So this theory to me is just a neat way to make the Eugenics wars officially part of WW3. The leads me initially to think 40 years is the appropriate shift. Placing khanian 1996 as gregorian 2036  The real issues though is the DY-100 class. It can be seen in VOY: ""Futures End"". The development of a nuclear powered planetary exploration vessel and its launch in gregorian 1990s is problematic. Further it is man's first mass produced vessel (http://en.memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/DY-100_class). To explain this away using khanian dates you have to shift the events of the voy episode as well, but why does Janeway and company use khanian dates? Is Rain Robinson living under Khan's rule, and thats why she gives them the wrong date? So that ""futures end"" occurs in the 2030s?   This would actually explain why the Ares IV seen in VOY: ""One Small Step"" was not a dy-100. The Ares IV could be a predecessor to the later dy-100. The Ares IV is launched in 2032, so the launch of the first dy-100s must have been a few years later, and the launch of the ss botany bay even further forward. This puts the khanian 1996 somewhere in the very late 2030s or early 2040s. (I need to re-watch this episode but memory alpha seems to indicate all dates are given by VOY crew not by the log entries)  If Rain Robinson uses khanian dates, then do the people in 2024 seen in DS9 ""Past Tense, Part I"" use them as well?  This would shift the events of that episode forward by about 30 years to ~2054 which is a year after the end of WW3. So that against the back drop of cities with rich people using advanced technology, and the poor living in ghettos we have Cochrane going out and starting to build his warp drive in rural Montana.  If the Bell riots are so formative for humanity it kind of makes sense to have them at the end of or at least towards the end of WW3 rather than before WW3, since events occurring before WW3 (2 years prior) would be overshadowed by the effect of the most devastating war humanity fought on earth.   The events of TNG ""The Nuetral Zone"" are difficult to mesh with the new timeline. Cryonics satellites need to have been launch in the late 20th century, to explain this we could apply the shift (which even helps fix the problems with the baseball discussion). But we are left wondering why the TNG crew, in particular Troi who researches the Clare's genealogy would not correct their guests use of khanian dates.  Interestingly on memory alpha it says there was an okudagram that was removed for being in error that placed Clare Raymond's death in 2035. If we take this to be her gregorian date of death, and her reported 1994 date of death to be a khanian date, then khanian 1996 is pinned down to 2037. Exactly in line from the date inferred from the Ares IV.  Further the cryogenic freezing technology that Khan used could easily have been a more sophisticated version of what was used to freeze Clare and company.  This leaves the following timeline:  2026: WW3 begins  2032: Launch of Ares IV  2032-2037: Eugenics wars and development of dy-100  2037: (khanian 1996) S.S. Botany Bay launches, also events of  ""Futures End""  2063: First contact  2065: Bell Riots (using the fact that they occur in khanian 2024, and the shift seems to be 41 years)"

Humans also hadn't developed the Prime Directive at this point - many, even in Starfleet, weren't even aware they should be thinking about it. So to find out that your peaceful and technologically advanced friends were aware of you and at your doorstep during a time when humanity really could have used peace might be upsetting. T'Pol knows a relationship with Vulcan is best for humanity, and she does have a fondness for them. So she maintains her aura of mystery so that humanity may continue to grow."
DaystromInstitute,3b3hbj,danitykane,11,Thu Jun 25 18:30:37 2015 UTC,"(Copy & pasted from when I commented earlier)  Pretty sure it's a mostly true story. At the time T'Pol's ancestor visited Earth, we had cars and airplanes, but were still engaged in wars and many of the Earth's population were oppressed or destitute. Our cars and planes, while impressive, didn't impress the Vulcan's enough, obviously, because in Star Trek: First Contact, it was stated that the Vulcans had no interest in Earth because we were ""too primitive"". How would they have POSSIBLY known that simply by flying overhead out of orbit a few times? They couldn't have known unless they sent a survey mission closer to the surface, which they did, but it ended up crashing which allowed those Vulcans to spend time with the Humans in Pennsylvania and interact with them, listen to their conversations and watch television and learn about the present state of the human race. Without warp capability, as a Vulcan, I, too would have concluded that Earth simply wasn't ready to be contacted formally when I went back to Vulcan. Fast forward 100 years and ""yeah, the humans still aren't ready, but shit, now they have warp drive so since they're going to be flying about the sector, we might as well introduce ourselves now."" It all makes logical sense."

DaystromInstitute,3b3hbj,Hellstrike,0,Thu Jun 25 19:40:04 2015 UTC,"But if they keep an eye on Earth, why didn't they notice the Borg sphere, some traces of time travel (although they don't believe in it they would notice something funny on sensors) and some sign of the Enterprise E."

The Vulcans weren't looking for Enterprise E or the Borg Cube, neither of which were traveling at warp when they went through the time singularity... I'd hazard a guess that Vulcan ship wasn't even in range at this point. Fast forward a day or two, and the Vulcans were going about their business when they detected the warp signature of the Phoenix & decided to go and take a look. By the time the Vulcan ship detected the Phoenix's warp signature, Data had already betrayed the Borg queen by not firing on the Phoenix and within a matter of minutes, Data & Captain Picard retained control of the Enterprise and at some point, made their ship undetectable to the Vulcan ship.  Check. Mate."

DaystromInstitute,3b3hbj,FakeyFaked,6,Fri Jun 26 21:58:20 2015 UTC,"Response reposted from the previous CMV post.    Here goes - The story of Carbon Creek is only what it is, a story.  The fascination with humanity is not new to T'Pol or Vulcans. If we go back to ""Fusion,"" T'Pol leaves the compound to find a jazz bar playing a very chaotic experimental jazz music. T'Pol takes risks entering and taking in the music and the odd chaos is something that attracts her. The family history in being fascinated by humans is not necessary to her story.  I submit to you that the acquiring of the purse could have been done on Earth in any antique shop. Because we know that Vulcans can appreciate aesthetics (Spock played music, the IDIC pin is a design choice, numerous artifacts and sculptures in Vulcan sanctuaries), then it is not any stretch that T'Pol would find the aesthetic value of the purse to be attractive, particularly since she had an affinity for humans already.  Those same appreciations for the arts extend into storytelling, something that T'Pol experienced from humans first hand by the telling of ghost stories by Travis Mayweather while camping in ""Strange New World."" Considering the difficulty that T'Pol was having assimilating with the crew, (How many times is she going to get asked to go to movie night??) she decides that the weaving of a tale might be something that fellow crewmembers would appreciate. Since the Ghost of George Webb story seemed to entertain the others on the planet who better to try out her storytelling than on the two people she has the closest relationship with, Archer and Trip?  Seeing the opportunity to practice the craft, she controls the dinner conversation basing her story upon a purchase she had made of an old antiquity. Her ability is seen as she uses the classic ""I can stop telling the story if you like,"" as Archer and Trip are in disbelief of what they are hearing. This only draws them in more. It is too often that we overlook that Vulcans are incredibly artistic people and that a life of logic does not trump an appreciation for aesthetics. Storytelling traditions are common in many different species. Fictional stories might be viewed as a ""lie"" but T'Pol never indicates that the story is true. That gets her out trap of the Vulcan tendency to never lie when unnecessary.  And there is also the question of the Vulcan database, which is extensive. Those that crashed on Earth would not have the option to forgo reporting that the crash happened, as too many people would know since they were picked up years later by a Vulcan surveyor. If the Vulcans were providing Humans with information via the database, the omission of such an incident could certainly damage relations if it ever was revealed later. Compound this with the fact that there is nothing much for the Vulcans to gain by not telling the Humans that this Carbon Creek incident had happened, and the idea that this story is real becomes even more doubtful.  I would say that the story being fabricated reveals much more about T'Pol's desire to assimilate with humans and her admiration for them. If there is one thing that I think is my favorite part of Jolene Blalock's portrayal of T'Pol, is it her ability to show emotions that come to the surface and T'Pol's fight to suppress them. Blalock does this with her facial expressions quite a bit, and it might seem repetitive to some, but I think that it is a reflection that T'Pol may not have been the most disciplined when it came to her emotions, and the affinity for humans would make sense for someone who is trying to live with the emotions that she cannot seem to bury deep enough.  That's my attempt to change your view, hope you enjoyed it. I've always been of the opinion that the story was fabricated, nice to see that the ambiguity in the episode leaves a split opinion with the viewers!"

Compound this with the fact that there is nothing much for the Vulcans to gain by not telling the Humans that this Carbon Creek incident had happened, and the idea that this story is real becomes even more doubtful.   You have good points, but I'd say this sort of thinking is exactly in-line with the paternalistic ""protect the humans from themselves/maintain the status quo of interspecies relations"" views we see from Vulcans in Enterprise.  First Contact is a major turning point for humanity -- I can see the Vulcans being reluctant to casually drop, ""Oh, we've been here before, and were well aware of your existence all this time - we just didn't care,"" to a newly warp-capable society that was so warlike it had almost destroyed itself in those early days, but using this event to get its shit together.  The paranoia and distrust that revelation would have at any point from FC up to the time of Enterprise (and even past then, given the strained nature of human-alien relations we witness) could tear their alliance apart. I could easily see the Vulcans deciding to bury that information until they believe humans are ""ready,"" even going so far as to wipe their memory banks, then it either being lost, or later Vulcans finding it too damaging to bring up later because of that coverup.  T'Pol has family knowledge, but doesn't want the captain and Trip running off and telling everyone, but also doesn't want to be a part of this coverup because she's grown to trust these humans. So she splits the difference.  Remember, the Vulcans hide stuff from the humans all the time if they think the humans would react ""irrationally."" Hell, they are apparently willing to let them fight an entire war with the Romulans without ever revealing their relation to them. That seems to point to large amounts of the Vulcan database being firewalled off -- possibly even from portions of their own population. They manage to keep that secret all the way up until Kirk's time."
DaystromInstitute,3b3hbj,FakeyFaked,3,Thu Jun 25 19:35:59 2015 UTC,"[Reposted response]  I was going to offer the same explanation as /u/Jensaarai did on the previous thread (and will hopefully repost here) -- the unique and unprecedented nature of First Contact is central to the legitimation of the huge changes taking place in human society, changes that not everyone is happy with. I would suggest, though, that even if the information about Carbon Creek is accessible in the database, no human would think to look for it. Everyone knows that First Contact was First Contact! It's drilled into you from grade school.  That said, I appreciate your theory and I'm glad you made this into an authentic ""CMV."" I think your basic outline is plausible, and if your view is right, then I like the episode even more, because it seems like they made it systematically ambiguous all the way down. One thing that makes it satisfying to me is that we gain basically the same insights into T'Pol's character in both our theories. But for your account to be fully satisfying to me, you'd need to provide some kind of explanation for how she manages to come up with the story -- and why she would visit this obscure mining town if the story wasn't true. On the former, I think the parallels between Archer and Trip and the two Vulcan men are a good place to start, but I'm not sure what you'd do on the latter.   Basically, I think you're on the way to convincing me that the episode genuinely leaves room for ambiguity, but it still seems to me that my theory is the more probable interpretation between the two. I'm still a long way from believing that the story is clearly false or even that it's more likely to be false."
DaystromInstitute,3b3hbj,disposable_pants,2,Thu Jun 25 19:32:17 2015 UTC,"[Reposted response to response..lol]  In answer to you and /u/Jensaarai regarding the withholding of information on First Contact, this is different than holding back technology or knowledge of the rest of the galaxy. Instead, it is holding back information about humans themselves, and interactions with humans. That's why I believe that holding back that type of information would be more damaging to relations than holding back technology in the aim of protecting their cultural changes. In fact, if we are making the argument that the Vulcans held back the information of Carbon Creek because FC is ""central to the legitimation of the huge changes taking place in human society,"" then is that deliberate omission interference in an alien culture? Are the Vulcans withholding information to push human culture into what they would like it to be? That's why I would question the motivation behind not revealing the occurrance. If it was as benign as the story would indicate, I don't see the reason for taking a risk in attempting to keep the secret.  Now, the mysterious visit to Carbon Creek from T'Pol, that is a far more difficult question to answer. I'm going to ponder on that for a bit and then possibly edit this later. But I believe that her visit there is exactly the type of thing that Vulcans would have been worried about had the story been true. If the story is true, then someone spills the beans, what would be the reaction? And the ease in which such a story would be revealed by such a visit.  Humans know enough about the whereabouts of Vulcans that they knew T'Pol went to Carbon Creek, which is interesting in its own right. But T'Pol was the only Vulcan curious enough to visit the town? That also seems very odd assuming there is knowledge of this contact.  As for what she actually was doing in Carbon Creek, yes, that's a toughie that I'm going to have think on it."
DaystromInstitute,3b3hbj,Hellstrike,3,Thu Jun 25 19:35:04 2015 UTC,"The fact that she visited Carbon Creek shows she was making it up? That's a bold counterintuitive claim. I like the spirit, but I'm not convinced.   It seems simpler to assume that the encounter was highly classified (or not even fully acknowledged by T'Mir and the other surviving guy -- not a huge stretch given that they covered for the guy who stayed behind), but that T'Mir passed down the story (and souvenir) to her family because of how deeply it affected her. That would make sense in light of T'Pol's mother's counter-cultural tendencies, for instance."
DaystromInstitute,3b3hbj,TheDudeNeverBowls,3,Thu Jun 25 19:38:53 2015 UTC,"[Reposted from the earlier thread.]  Excellent ideas.  One sticking point, though:   Compound this with the fact that there is nothing much for the Vulcans to gain by not telling the Humans that this Carbon Creek incident had happened, and the idea that this story is real becomes even more doubtful.   Admission of pre-First Contact first contact could damage the Human/Vulcan relationship for two reasons:    Even a century after First Contact we see that relationship is strained already, so a secret, no matter how seemingly inconsequential we think it may be (and keep in mind our views are colored by what we know will happen in the coming centuries), could do significant damage.  The official First Contact story -- that a Vulcan ship happened to be passing by, noticed the Pheonix's warp signature, and landed -- could imply that the Vulcans were not actively observing Earth prior to official contact.  If (instead of almost randomly having a completely benevolent first contact interaction) we suddenly learned that the Vulcans were closely watching us for over a century before finally saying hello we might get a little upset.  Remember, this is an Earth that hasn't yet adopted the Prime Directive and its rule of non-intervention in pre-warp species.   In this context, imagine possible Starfleet reactions if T'Pol's story becomes part of the official record:   We've known them for a few generations now... why were they keeping this from us? They really watched us almost annihilate ourselves at least twice (Eugenics Wars, WW3) and stood by watching? Were they spying on us? Exactly how long were they watching us, and how many observers did they have? They said they weren't involved in human affairs, but if they lied to us about this, why wouldn't they lie to us about that?   Remember, this Earth is far from the idyllic, almost naive Earth of the 23rd and 24th centuries, and organizations like Section 31 already exist.  Hell, the Xindi attack set off a wave of xenophobia we'd never imagine in later Trek series.  The Earth of Enterprise seems ripe for falling down a rabbit hole of suspicion if their fragile alliance with Vulcan is rocked a little more.    All of that said, I think many of the points discussed here highlight why Enterprise is a wildly underrated show."

On the other hand, even then the Vulcans still kept things to themselves that they felt were shameful. Look at their attitudes about Mind Melds and Pa'nar syndrome, and the continued awkwardness about Pon'Farr in the later series. Is it possible that T'Mir's actions to helping Jack go to college sort of caused some kind of divergence in humanity that lead to WW3 that wouldn't have happened otherwise? Kid seemed really brilliant and keen to learn, and I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility some boy from a mining town had that much potential.  The Vulcans to me always acted like humanity was some burden they had to shoulder, and this could be part of it. T'Pol at this point still I think was holding onto her resolute ""Vulcans do not lie"" scenario, but she was softening up and was indulging them with a story but added enough elements of storytelling in a way to leave it ambiguous enough to have them questioning the truthfulness of the story, but not so much that they were going to go out of their way and  to go looking in Vulcan database to read up what really happened.   I don't think T'Pol could risk them going ""who was this Jack kid"" and go ""So, he's responsible for doing this that lead to WW3"" and then all eyes would be on Vulcan. The rewriting of the history books I think would require them to go a little earlier than ""First Contact."""

For example, using multiple PADDs to transfer multiple text files or multiple storage rods to hold audio recordings of multiple operas.    Once we got to Voyager they seemed to have finally found a workaround for this issue.  Since DS9 continued the 'one file per device' pattern past the beginning of Voyager, perhaps the solution had something to do with bioneural circuitry?

As for in-universe, they were pretty much used to transfer information from one area / console to another, e.g.:   Personnel records stored in tapes in TOS Court Martial, and medical records. Information for cross-analyses e.g. transmission from the Comms station is put on tape and handed to Science Officer for decryption (TOS Balance of Terror).

Perhaps complete centralization of data at that point was seen as undesirable; perhaps we're far enough removed from it in TOS that centralization of data in the main computer is not verboten but the practice of keeping data decentralized for transportation is retained. There are precedents for this in our technology and use, like our vestigial ""save"" icon - when was the last time you saved to a 3 1/2"" floppy disk? People still refer to ""videotaping"" things.

I mean, it's possible that because blue whales were extinct, they couldn't create a translator program, so I'm not sure. However, to my knowledge, Archer doesn't turn on his universal translator to talk to his dog, and Data can't effectively communicate with Spot (although that may just be because Spot is a cat and doesn't care what Data says, haha).  It would make sense that the people creating translator programs for alien races would study animal communication, though. After all, much communication between animals is done on frequencies that humans can't hear or in sounds that humans may have a hard time distinguishing between."
DaystromInstitute,3b55la,fishey_me,3,Fri Jun 26 02:07:02 2015 UTC,It also might be worth considering that Data might want to communicate inefficiently with Spot to make keeping a pet a more 'human' experience.

DaystromInstitute,3b3faq,AnnihilatedTyro,8,Thu Jun 25 18:24:15 2015 UTC,"That's kind of the point of the episode.  Isabella chose someone vulnerable to manipulate, but it was accidentally a child, whose view of the adult world was clouded and jaded, which then jaded Isabella's view of humanity.  An adult wouldn't have put up with Isabella nearly as long, and yet that probably would have gotten the Enterprise destroyed."
DaystromInstitute,3b3faq,LordGalen,4,Thu Jun 25 18:38:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but the notion that Isabella is basically a junkie is more thinly veiled than the vulnerability of an isolated child.  But also, the episode serves as an excellent juxtaposition that puts the quality attributes of the the legitimate best friend relationships in the series into perspective."
DaystromInstitute,3b3faq,LordGalen,8,Thu Jun 25 18:43:13 2015 UTC,"I guess I just don't see it as that deep.  Childhood friendships are less nuanced and more attention/association-based than adult friendships.  They're not necessarily based on trust, respect, or the other solid two-way foundations of adult friendships.  Kids learn over time, through the many comings and goings of friends, how to pick quality friendships.  As Clara had not been able to make or keep friends due to her father's constant relocation, she has yet to develop that skill, and her naivete was exploited, yes, by a manipulative junkie.  And yet the fact that Isabella chose Clara was purely by chance."
DaystromInstitute,3b3faq,Lmaoboat,3,Thu Jun 25 18:50:45 2015 UTC,You make an excellent summary of the nature of childhood friendships. I don't think Isabella chose Clara by chance though. She explored a decent amount of the ship before materializing in the garden with Clara.  I would also contend though that just because the writers did not intend for the episode to put into perspective the differential quality of interpersonal friendships does not mean we cannot use the episode as an opportunity to do so.

DaystromInstitute,3b4kes,ecf2,3,Thu Jun 25 23:19:57 2015 UTC,"This. The Breen tore thru Starfleet's defense perimeter for earth thanks to their energy dampening weapon. It's a tribute to Starfleet that they were able to mount any kind of defense at all, based at how effective the weapon was in the engagement in the Chintoka sector. The fact almost all the attacking Breen were destroyed is a credit to Starfleet under those conditions."
DaystromInstitute,3b4kes,EBone12355,2,Fri Jun 26 02:13:16 2015 UTC,"But there's a flaw with that assumption, neither the crew of the Defiant nor any other ship at the battle of Chin'toka had advanced knowledge of the weapon. If the Breen had used the weapon in their assault wouldn't Starfleet have notified their ships and their allies?"
DaystromInstitute,3b4kes,preppy381,9,Fri Jun 26 06:41:43 2015 UTC,"""You can't save paradise by destroying it.""  It seems clear that Humans don't want a militarized Earth and that Starfleet has, in all cases except for all-out war with the Dominion, done an okay job defending Earth. Think about it this way, Washington D.C. is not really defended from enemy attacks. It could be hardened, we could install missile launchers on the roofs of tall buildings and have soldiers patrolling the streets (as we saw when Red Squad disabled the power grid on Earth).   We could do all those things but really:    If the enemy is able to get its warships to Earth (Washington DC) then we've almost certainly already lost the war You can't prevent small-scale terrorist attacks no matter how much you militarize a place (and the Breen attack, for all its psychological damage, didn't actually cause too much destruction).  A demilitarized Earth better represents the Federation ideal.    Maybe all they really needed was a better warfighting contingency plan and a higher ship production so that a reserve fleet could always be in reach of the core worlds."
DaystromInstitute,3b4kes,butterhoscotch,4,Thu Jun 25 23:44:13 2015 UTC,"In reality they should have Orbital weapons platforms, defensive starbases (with fighters), ground based torpedo launchers with independent generators and a small fleet in the sol system at all times.  However starfleet takes its orders from the peace loving federation, who above all else do not want to seem militarized, they dont want it to cramp their image basically, their voters demand it. Some worlds may have joined on the basis they joined a peaceful cooperative, so what happens when they militarize? Do planets start pulling out of the federation?"
DaystromInstitute,3b4kes,Hellstrike,2,Fri Jun 26 03:33:32 2015 UTC,How much would a couple torpedo launchers on trucks change the freedom on Earth? Probably not at all. And it would add significant defense capabilities if you could build torpedoes capable of being launched from earth.
DaystromInstitute,3b4kes,disposable_pants,3,Fri Jun 26 08:44:02 2015 UTC,"The more ships/resources Starfleet commits to Earth and core Federation worlds, the fewer are available on the frontier.  Fewer ships on the frontier means more aggressive neighbors (in peacetime and war).  More aggressive neighbors means more conflicts, and conflicts that range deeper into Federation space.  More conflicts ranging deeper into Federation space puts Earth more at risk, dedicated defense fleet or no.    By this reasoning, a fleet on the frontier does more to protect Earth than a fleet in Sector 001."

DaystromInstitute,3b4kes,uptotwentycharacters,3,Fri Jun 26 04:59:15 2015 UTC,"True, but it's also a good idea to have defense in depth as well, and not leave your interior totally undefended. Avoiding the enemy's main force and attacking their vulnerabilities directly is an ancient tactic and is even easier to pull off in space due to the large areas that need to be covered. It's really impossible to have a completely solid front line in space, you can only really defend individual planets or star systems. Something like the Pacific theatre of Earth's Second World War would be a better basis for interstellar war strategy than land warfare would be.  And there's always the possibility that the enemy might break through your front lines, but if you leave a small force defending the interior they may be able to repel the weakened enemy force, or at least fight a delaying action to buy enough time to evacuate Earth."
DaystromInstitute,3b4kes,General_Fear,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:15:06 2015 UTC,"My guess is that the Dominion launched an attack that forced the hand of the Federation causing them to divert resources to defend a high priority target. Much the same way a boxer sees a punch coming to his gut and when he lowers his guard to defend his stomach, the opponent comes in over the top.  One thing the Federation can do is have space station optimized for combat. Like DS9 on steroids. Other things that can help is mine fields, ground batteries, fighter garrisons, missile launchers as well as a home guard fleet who's only charge is to defend the capital. By law, they can't leave the system."
DaystromInstitute,3b4kes,Neo24,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:11:05 2015 UTC,"It was probably a surprise sneak small-scale attack that no one expected due to it's daring and suicidal character (ever heard of the Doolittle Raid?). Mistakes happen. We also don't know how far the frontline actually was from Earth.  Also, why do you claim no lessons were ever learned? At Wolf 359, Starfleet had no reserve fleet to defend Earth - yet in the case of the Breen raid, the Breen fleet was entirely destroyed and any damage they did was utterly minimal compared to the power of Star Trek weaponry. This implies there had to have been a fleet at Earth to destroy the attackers and also probably implies some kind of shielding for Earth's cities. And later, in VOY ""Endgame"" we see a large fleet assembled at Earth only minutes after the Borg open their transwarp conduit."
DaystromInstitute,3b365f,HMSBounty-A,8,Thu Jun 25 16:21:14 2015 UTC,"As far as the origin of the Enterprise A goes, it seems to me that it was likely a rechristened Yorktown, or other constitution class ship that was going through a refit process, but was perhaps abandoned and mothballed before completion, in order for engineers to concentrate on the newer classes of ships (Miranda, Excelsior, etc.).  The Federation high council probably considered it a gift to Kirk and company for their efforts in ST IV, and hastily finished the refit process (leading to the problems we see with the ship in ST V).    As to her legacy, and whether Kirk and the crew felt at home on the A, I'll leave this here.  I imagine they would feel at home in any vessel, as long as they are out there making a difference."
DaystromInstitute,3b365f,Enigma_Alpha,6,Thu Jun 25 19:25:43 2015 UTC,"Excellent post. Although the Enterprise A does raise some questions, I feel it was important to keep the ship consistent in terms of the viewers' attachment. The Enterprise is another character and she's an important one. I love the way the A looks in VI. The lighting is fantastic. The model is gorgeous, making the battle scenes with Chang really nail biting.  Contrast this with my impression of the Enterprise E, which I never developed an attachment to. Yes. It's badass, but it's not home. Throughout the TOS movies, the Enterprise (refit or A) never failed to feel like home.   PS - It's beta cannon at best, but Mr. Scott's Guide to the Enterprise suggested that the A was not a Constitution class refit, but an Enterprise class ship built to the specifications of the Constitution refits and named in honor of the most historic of the ships from the class that was its primary inspiration. I like this."
DaystromInstitute,3b365f,gutens,2,Thu Jun 25 23:49:13 2015 UTC,Mr Scott's Guide to the Enterprise says that the A is a rechristened Connie refit (USS Ti-Ho).

Ti-Ho was chosen to be the host vessel for the new drive design. Ti-Ho was not a Constitution refit, but was built new from the keel up.""  -Mr. Scott's Guide to the Enterprise, page 112"
DaystromInstitute,3b365f,gutens,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:23:54 2015 UTC,"Amen, and from Memory Beta:   When construction began on the Enterprise-A in the early 2280s, the ship was named the USS Ti-Ho and assigned the registry number, NCC-1798. Though resembling a Constitution-class rebuild, Ti-Ho was built new from the keel up. The Ti-Ho was to serve as a test-bed for transwarp drive which was also being tested on the USS Excelsior.  Construction of the Ti-Ho was largely completed by 2285, but shortly afterwards transwarp drive was proved a failure and Starfleet Command decided to equip the Ti-Ho with conventional warp drive. (ST reference: Mr. Scott's Guide to the Enterprise).  A few weeks later, the USS Enterprise was destroyed in orbit of the Genesis Planet, and in the early months of 2286, Admiral James T. Kirk and the former crew of the Enterprise prevented the destruction of Earth by the Cetacean Probe. In honor of their achievements, Federation President Hiram Roth ordered that the Ti-Ho be renamed Enterprise and assigned the registry NCC-1701-A; the official commissioning occurred in that same year at the San Francisco Fleet Yards. Shortly afterward, command of the Enterprise was assigned to newly-demoted Captain James T. Kirk. (TOS movie, novelization & comic adaptation: Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home; ST website: Startrek.com)."
DaystromInstitute,3b365f,MexicanSpaceProgram,2,Mon Jun 29 10:05:39 2015 UTC,"I believe Mr. Scott's Guide to the Enterprise is closely based on the FASA continuity, where there was no such thing as the ""Constitution Refit"", it was just called the Enterprise Class. So in that continuity, the ship seen in TMP/TWOK/TSFS wasn't really a Constitution Refit either, it was an Enterprise Class ship, which had been constructed from a Constitution Class ship.  The Constitution Refit vs Enterprise Class is an issue that's never really gotten a solid answer. In TWOK, the doors to the bridge simulator say something like ""Enterprise Class Simulator"" which presumably means that the movie Enterprise is an ""Enterprise Class"" ship (though it could also refer specifically to the designation of the simulator instead) yet in STVI Scotty's blueprints say Constitution Class.   Personally I'm partial to calling it an Enterprise Class ship, simply because the changes between TOS and TMP. I think of it as a reconstruction/rebuild from Constitution to Enterprise class, as it seems too drastic to be considered a simple refit. A refit would seem to better describe the changes between 2254 and 2265, namely slight visual differences to the warp nacelles and bridge, and according to beta cannon, this is when phasers were first installed as well. Another example of a refit would be the modifications made to the USS Lakota - combat systems were significantly enhanced, yet the outward appearance of the ship remained essentially the same."
DaystromInstitute,3b365f,uptotwentycharacters,3,Sat Jun 27 20:35:23 2015 UTC,"Slightly off topic, but I have little respect for Admiral Morrow, the head of Starfleet at the time of ST: III. He rebuffed a request of what is likely Starfleet's greatest Captain & Admiral, James Kirk without even consulting with the Federation Council. He didn't even know the correct age of the Enterprise, which we know based on the events of The Menagerie and the time Spock spent on her under Captain Pike that the Enterprise is closer to 40 years since her commissioning than the 20 he says.   Morrow seems to be more of a bureaucrat than a military commander.  The fact he was replaced so soon after the events of ST: III by Admiral Cartwright, who we can characterize from the events of VI as a neo-hawk, bears this out."
DaystromInstitute,3b365f,EBone12355,3,Fri Jun 26 02:33:39 2015 UTC,"Could Admiral Morrow be referring to 20 years since the refit?  (I apologize in advance if it's a silly question, I don't know my Trek time lines very well.)"
DaystromInstitute,3b365f,Shockwave8A,2,Fri Jun 26 03:52:42 2015 UTC,"That's always what I assume was happening.  Star Trek timelines hadn't really been set in stone when ST3 was written.  Roddenberry suggested the original Enterprise was older with ""history"", but that may not have been communicated to the writers for ST3.  When things were hammered out a few years later, the Enterprise was actually 40 at that point and Cartwright could conceivably have been referring to its (massive) refit."
DaystromInstitute,3b365f,bordersnothing,2,Fri Jun 26 21:52:25 2015 UTC,"That always seemed to be the most reasonable interpretation of that line, however it's a bit of an exaggeration. The refit was completed circa 2271 (and took ~18 months IIRC), and TSFS was set in 2285, so at that time the Enterprise was really closer to 15 years since the refit."
DaystromInstitute,3b365f,uptotwentycharacters,3,Sat Jun 27 20:21:46 2015 UTC,"Great point about Morrow.  With 20 years overall being too little, but since the refit too much, Morrow may be basing this figure on the ship's ability, similar to how they refer to the various warp engines as a benchmark in Enterprise.    Morrow and his subsequent sacking for Cartwright could be due to the former putting all his eggs in the Excelsior class basket."
DaystromInstitute,3b365f,Shockwave8A,2,Fri Jun 26 04:10:34 2015 UTC,"Long term I think the legacy of the Enterprise-A is the Khitomer Accords and the end of hostilities with the Klingons.  It does seem to be a flash in the pan in terms of longevity, so I doubt the crew really ever did seem at home.  Chekov not knowing about the alarms for phaser fire and Scotty studying some manual would seem to bear this out.    As for us viewers, I think we were just out of time.  We knew the crew was aging and it wouldn't make sense that some wouldn't be given their own command or promotions, or thinking of retirement.  In that case, it probably was best to keep the -refit and A the same.  We'd have probably liked a new ship just fine, but we'd have saw as much of it was we did the Enterprise-B (and I still hate the extra fairings)  We also had the Enterprise models on the -D's conference room wall, so that sort of limited the choices too.    As for the -B's launch, I'm trying to imagine it's like the Coast Guard asking any nearby ships to help in a search and rescue, where they can be there in 15 minutes but the Dolphin helicopter will take 45 minutes.  Star Trek in general seems to make space seem small, which may have worked to the detriment of this particular instance in trying to explain why nothing else was around.  While I would think the -B would have some sort of escort for the first run, perhaps they'd built enough Excelsior class ships that it was like someone driving a Civic off the lot and down the road."
DaystromInstitute,3b365f,MexicanSpaceProgram,2,Fri Jun 26 04:22:30 2015 UTC,"The legacy of the A is open to interpretation - STVI says it's decommissioned, and the Shatnerverse later says it's saved from being used as a weapons testing target, only to be to destroyed later saving the planet Chal.  Would they feel at home on a different vessel?  In Generations, Scott has absolutely no problem taking over the helm of the B and generating Jesus beams using the deflector, so they'd likely feel comfortable on any ship of that era (e.g. Miranda or Excelsior)."

You don't get burnt coffee that reminds you of that long road trip you took with your friends, you get coffee, black, two sugars. You don't get chocolate chip cookies you've been smelling as your mom cooked them and swatted your hand away as they cooled, you get standard chocolate chip cookies.  Even without the emotional attachments, there's also the taste difference from cook to cook. Think about the difference between pasta from your favorite restaurant and the pasta you make with sauce out of a jar. The difference between Chips Ahoy cookies and a homemade batch. The difference between gourmet applewood smoked bacon and Oscar Meyer's ""applewood smoked bacon product.""  I'm sure the replicator makes fine food, but there's no secret ingredients, no variety, and no emotion to it. The Vulcans may not care, but for most of the other races, that's part of what makes food so enjoyable.   Another thing to consider is that you cite people who are unaccustomed to replicated food, but by TOS, most of the characters are very accustomed to it. I think it's similar to special effects-- when CGI first came out, it blew people away! So realistic! So much potential! But now, we can see the difference, and we complain that we don't see more practical effects in movies. It's probably the same for replicated food."
DaystromInstitute,3b3wtx,fishey_me,7,Thu Jun 25 19:57:43 2015 UTC,"Good point but I think we are limiting the replicator to much in think it can only do one ""version"" of something.  If you ask for a ""Steak Dinner"" you may get the generic Starfleet Steak Dinner 1.0.3 w/potato and asparagus.   What if instead replicator recipes become something like music or media downloads are today?  You may carry in your personal files a whole bunch of replicator patterns from different places.  So tonight you may have ""Steak Dinner"" but specify the pattern for Bobby Flays Steak Dinner 4.5 or Alton Browns deconstructed Steak Dinner 2.1.2.  That way there could be soul and flare as it isn't just a generic stock replicator pattern. Takes being a Celebrity Chef to a whole new place.

It may be that the computer banks in TOS couldn't hold patterns for frivolous things like food, since data disks are rampant in that show, even for what we would consider small things like text files.   I love your idea about celebrity chefs! That is a very cool concept. It may explain some of the frustration most people have with their food, though. Sure, Bobby Flay's good, but even he doesn't make food ""just like Mamma used to make.""   Another thing to note: there are different quality replicators that make different quality food. In DS9, they complain a lot about the Defiant's replicator, even joking about paying Quark for a better one and complaining about the coffee, ""If you can call that coffee.""

That said, it's easy to say why Chips Ahoy cookies aren't nearly as good as competently baked homemade cookies. It's a little harder for me to figure out where the physical discrepancy in replicated food would come from given how precise it apparently is with other items."
DaystromInstitute,3b3wtx,ScottieLikesPi,2,Thu Jun 25 20:21:47 2015 UTC,"Other items are not intended to be consumed. Star Trek has a tendency to imply that certain luxury goods like silks, food, quality liquor, perfumes can't be replicated.   While the Federation's economy may not run on currency, other alien economies do. Perhaps there's a kind of copyright on certain products to prevent them from being replicated... Hmmm... Now I'm imagining a Pirate Bay for replicated food..."
DaystromInstitute,3b3wtx,ScottieLikesPi,2,Fri Jun 26 01:55:32 2015 UTC,"The only items I can think of which cannot be replicated are Latinum and Dilithium. True alcohol isn't replicated, at least on starships, although it is never explicitly stated whether or not that is because they can't replicate it, or because synthohol is a much safer option when the drinker might get called to the bridge at a moments notice if something goes wrong.   Although it's not completely inconceivable that the Federation might limit what their citizens can do for the sake of economic stability in nearby non-allied empires, it does seem like a bit of a stretch. Additionally, you know the Ferengi are going to have no qualms about crashing someone else's economy with their own replicated goods. Their presence rather defeats the point of any such ban."
DaystromInstitute,3b3wtx,ScottieLikesPi,7,Fri Jun 26 04:46:07 2015 UTC,"Right now, somewhere, are large tanks filled with orange juice.  Squeezed and refined, the real deal.  All of it fresh.  Yet even though it's all perfectly natural and safe, it's having a strange reaction to something used to preserve it: the nitrogen.  The very material used to preserve the orange juice without any additional chemicals has an adverse reaction and causes the orange juice to lose all it's flavor.  So to fix this, when the orange juice is pulled out and bottled, a flavor pack is injected to simulate the taste of orange juice.  You're drinking real orange juice, and you're enjoying it, but you're tasting a chemical, while the actual juice is doing the work of helping your body.  Think about what Kool-Aid is.  It's a powder that comes in numerous flavors that, when mixed with water and sugar, becomes a tasty beverage.  Is it real cherry you taste?  Absolutely not.  Is it real grape?  No.  But you don't care, do you?  As far as you're concerned, you're enjoying a 'cherry' drink or a 'grape' drink.  It's completely artificial, yet you're fine with that because you've grown used to it.  What we're looking at in replicator technology is simply a more refined and elegant version of processed foods in a more convenient delivery method.  MREs, the ""Meals Ready to Eat"" used by the military, are essentially a primitive version that you just add water or shake or something to deliver hot food in the field.  You don't need a full mess kit or camp fire when you can just activate it and go on your way.  A replicator is simply taking it to the next step using a very advanced transporter system.  The transporter in this case is nothing more than a very fancy 3D printer.  It uses atoms and molecules to build and create a structure that is a facsimile to the original stored in its memory banks.  It may trim the fat here and there, literally in some cases, but there's nothing to say that a slice of pizza coming out of a replicator isn't just a bunch of textured proteins that only taste like a pizza because it's what your taste receptors say a pizza tastes like.  How would you know the difference without scanning it to make sure?  We're already in a wonderful world where you can be tricked into what is and isn't a real flavoring.  Some are a wonderfully bizarre mix of chemicals that make you think you're eating sugar, when you're not.  To some people, it's the greatest.  To others, it's completely nasty.  And this is all within the past century!  They have 300 years of advancement to make incredibly complex chains of flavor packs that can, with ease, take a little grey cube and make it taste like you just bit into fifteen different fruits all at the same time.    But... which would you feel better about?  A small cube that merely TASTES like the food you want?  Or something that looks, feels, and acts like what you want?  Sure, it's the same material just in a different package, but you feel like it's real.  And when that happens, you turn off the part of your brain saying ""This is all fake!  It's all fake and you're eating reconstituted proteins and carbohydrates!""  You don't care.  As far as you're concerned, you are eating your pizza, sipping your wonderful synthetic beer, feet kicked up and watching whatever passes for Saturday Night Football in the 24th Century.  Because you can.  It's the ultimate comfort food that's fast, easy, and tastes just real enough that you can't tell the difference unless you really, really want to."
DaystromInstitute,3b3wtx,ScottieLikesPi,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:11:34 2015 UTC,"Great reply, this is exactly the sort of thing I was looking for.

DaystromInstitute,3b3wtx,ChaosMotor,3,Thu Jun 25 22:56:01 2015 UTC,"Very true, but a real pizza, as in one that you eat in our modern times, has marinara sauce that often contains meat, and you have things like pepperoni and other meat toppings.  Textured proteins would replace those, giving you the taste and texture of meat, without having to store it on board.  The reason for this is quite easy to understand.  Soy and other plants are already grown in vast quantities, and some of these textured proteins are a byproduct of things like soybean oil production.  Livestock, on the other hand, require a tremendous amount of work and effort to raise, which is both expensive and difficult.  The same amount of work going into the production of a single cow to reach slaughter weight could easily produce more food that can go into feeding a human.  And this is where you get into the whole ""Nothing tastes better than the real deal"" comes in.  Flavored texture proteins are fine and all, but I imagine eating a false burger that tastes close but isn't quite the same gets old when you get to a planet that has actual livestock.  Then you can get your hands on some genuine beef, flavor it just the way you want, and cook it.  Sure it's a nutritional nightmare, but you can indulge every so often.  The reason I could see replicators making a big use of this instead of trying to create artificial meat is this: you can store these proteins in bulk on the ship to serve as a base, it's found in abundance on almost any planet you visit, regardless of the local agriculture, and you can keep it a long time without spoiling.  Plus, as an added bonus, anything you replicate can taste like meat without violating religious taboos against eating meat, such as Islam and Judaism's restrictions on pork, Asian restrictions on meat, etc."
DaystromInstitute,3b3wtx,ScottieLikesPi,2,Fri Jun 26 01:32:02 2015 UTC,"I guess the question I am asking is why it would taste different. This fake meat is being put together at the molecular level, in a sense it's just speeding up what a cow's body does. Are you expecting there to be accuracy or precision issues with the replicator or the pattern it uses?"
DaystromInstitute,3b3wtx,ChaosMotor,2,Fri Jun 26 17:32:40 2015 UTC,"Ok, imagine you're sitting down to design something in a computer, in 3D.  You plan to build the item piece by piece and then put them together to form the finished product.  The item in question has thousands of parts to put together, and you have a deadline.  Are you going to design thousands of individual parts, or a single part that can be used again and again?  Same difference.  Sure, you can scan each individual atom of a meal and use that as your basis, but wouldn't it be easier to simply use a generic template for the cheese, a generic template for the pepperoni, for the crust, etc., then put them together to form the pizza?  It would speed things up tremendously, and gets around issues like whether the crust is too thick or too thin or the cheese isn't just right or it was done too long in the oven before the scan.  You could get around this by cooking up pizza after pizza to scan into the system... or you could cheat a little and just program generic items that can be tailored and tweaked to suit individual preferences."
DaystromInstitute,3b3wtx,Lord_Hoot,2,Fri Jun 26 18:48:19 2015 UTC,"Well, keep in mind that whoever did this probably does this sort of thing because they enjoy it. And while yes it would probably be storage space optimal to store ingredients and the pattern for how they are arranged instead of keeping a detailed, atom-by-atom pattern for each distinct combination of ingredients, why would this impact the quality of the replicated meats? Do you think they would skimp on making high quality reproductions of various meats to focus on the rest of the pizza?"
DaystromInstitute,3b3wtx,Hilomh,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:07:26 2015 UTC,"Well again, some cultures are vegetarian. It's far easier to store a non meat flavored to what you want than try and build a perfect replica piece of sausage or whatever"

He has been able to explain and expand upon theories and concepts shown onscreen.  Most notably, he has created a grand theory of time travel that is consistent across the entirety of Alpha Canon, including The Animated Series.    He was able to explain why the Stargazer was abandoned and left to die instead of scuttled: they couldn't scuttle her, and she was going to fall into a Jovian within a few days.  He then claimed that if the Stargazer bounced off of a Jovian's atmosphere in just the right way, it could potentially get back into a semi-stable orbit.  He verified this claim by skipping a Galoob Micromachines model of the Stargazer off of his filled kitchen sink.    He has linked the Shroomies from Enterprise's ""Silent Enemy"" to a mute civilization mentioned off-hand in TOS's ""The Empath"".  He has told the story behind Tobin Dax's first run in with Starfleet, and what made him settle down and start a family.  He has told the story of Iloja of Prim, mentioned once in DS9: ""Destiny"".  He has deduced the absolute latest date that Spock's grandfather must have been born.    He has made the world of Star Trek linked together in such a way that, paradoxically, makes the universe seem so much bigger."

DaystromInstitute,3b2of7,grok_spock,14,Thu Jun 25 19:12:29 2015 UTC,"The comic series Star Trek: Countdown was very much designed as a preface to Star Trek 2009. So many questions raised by the film are explained such as:   Why does the Nerada look like an evil blooming onion and not like a normal mining vessel? How was a supernova a galactic threat? Why was Nero called ""praetor"" by his crew if he was ""a simple miner""? What took Spock so long to respond to the threat?   In addition, it answers questions like:   What did most of the Enterprise-D crew do after the events of Nemesis? What happened to Data with that whole B-4 thing?   It's funny how similar Star Trek '09 and Tron: Legacy are. They're both reboots that re-envision an awful lot, and a lot of that means heaps and heaps of worldbuilding that didn't make it onscreen. Both films are much better appreciated when you take in all of the media connected to the film (like Tron: Uprising, or in this case Countdown).  To more directly address the prompt: This is one of the few beta canon works that has absolutely  no disagreements with what we see in any of the alpha canon.

[2] Although comic co-writer Mike Johnson considers Countdown to be canon, Orci stated he was in no position to declare whether it was, though he felt it could be considered canon unless it is contradicted in a later film or TV episode.

DaystromInstitute,3b2of7,garibaldi3489,4,Thu Jun 25 19:25:24 2015 UTC,"since new canon developments are on pause for the foreseeable future, what aspects of Prime Timeline Beta Canon are most ""canonizable""? [...] which aspects of the existing Beta Canon have not been superceded by on-screen events and are not contradicted by other Beta Canon material? The Enterprise relaunch novels seem to fall into this category, for instance.   Well, the whole TNG/DS9/VOY era has been relaunched in book form, starting with the DS9 novel 'Avatar', published in 2001. This led to a de facto ""season 8"" of DS9 novels, starting with 'Avatar' and ending with 'Unity'. Then, the TNG and VOY crews each got their own relaunch series. Plus, Riker and Troi were spun off into a separate ""Titan"" series of novels. Then, starting with 'Articles of the Federation', more and more of these separate series started to merge into one single combined series. And they're all internally consistent.  That's a whole lot of off-screen material which doesn't contradict itself and is highly unlikely to ever be superseded by new on-screen developments."

The writers have spent a lot of time making sure all of the stories are consistent with each other, true to the existing characters and universe, and build upon each other. These books do a fantastic job of continuing events after Nemesis and develop some really interesting new aspects of Star Trek, e.g the events in Destiny, the formation of the Typhon Pact and the deeper look we get into races like the Tzenkethi and the Breen, more details about Romulan politics, the 100, and the rise of Praetor Gel Kamemor, the fantastic character of Elias Vaughn, the changes on DS9, etc. All of these things build some potent background material from which to launch a new series, and provide great supplemental material to what has been seen on screen.  As a side note, the concepts developed in the mirror universe books, especially The Sorrows of Empire, Rise Like Lions, and Disavowed are really cool. It makes the mirror universe so much more 3-dimensional and not just a ""things which are good/bad in our universe are bad/good in the mirror universe"", but much more complex. Some of the concepts, like Memory Alpha and Jaunt Ships, are really intriguing"

On board starships and stations, there are stores of basic materials such as hydrogen, carbon, and other elements. In fact, the TNG technical manual says there are conduits that supply replicators with raw materials all over the ship. The replicator put those elements together into molecules and then the molecules into the shape of what you need (for example, it could be jello).  In this case, the guess is the enviromental system has a replicator that disassembles a block of carbon, draws in some oxygen and nitrogen, and then reassembles into the shape of molecules that they call neurocine.  It would make sense for the environmental system to have replicator abilities, then it could disassemble CO2 into C and O2. As long as you have power, they could break the CO2 apart. Reassembling matter uses much less energy than forming the matter needed from pure energy."
DaystromInstitute,3b1gnp,MrCrazy,4,Thu Jun 25 10:04:25 2015 UTC,"This is a misconception on the replicator. The replicator isn't a direct energy-to-matter converter, it's a matter-to-energy-to matter converters closer to an advanced 3D printer.   I've heard this before, but I can't recall ever hearing it suggested in an episode. Is it ever referenced on-screen, or is it something from the technical manuals that never made it to a script?"
DaystromInstitute,3b1gnp,convertedtoradians,9,Thu Jun 25 15:28:17 2015 UTC,"The TNG tech manual states that synthesis of elements is time and power intensive while synthesis of molecules and upwards is easier. For this reason, large quantities of amorphous hydrogen, oxygen and carbon are stored on Galaxy class vessels. Presumably also the reason for the replicator rations in Voyager."

DaystromInstitute,3b1gnp,convertedtoradians,3,Thu Jun 25 15:53:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, replicator workings are detailed in the TNG Technical Manual. It would probably take too much time to explain them on-screen."

EMH: My first bit of good news. We have to incapacitate the Romulans somehow. What kind of anaesthetics do you have handy?   EMH2: Only the best. Axonol, neurozine, anaesthazine.   EMH: Neurozine will do nicely. It can be distributed in gaseous form. Show me a schematic of the ship's ventilation system. Please.    Turns out it actually is one of those magic federation sleep gas)"
DaystromInstitute,3b1gnp,74159637895123,5,Thu Jun 25 08:11:24 2015 UTC,"It's possible that Neurocine is the Cardassian version of Neurozine, without the antagonist mixed in to inhibit or block the Neurocine once it reaches a sufficient dose to knock the subject out.  Without such an antagonist, it could indeed be lethal.     In real life, knockout gas is a far more life-threatening weapon than it’s usually portrayed in fiction.  Recall the 2002 hostage crisis in a Moscow theater, where the knockout gas used by Russian forces to subdue the militants ended up killing over a hundred of their hostages.  If not administered in a carefully controlled dose, and if the patient isn’t closely monitored, any anaesthetic drug can be potentially fatal.  So I tried to justify how Starfleet’s anesthizine gas could be reliably nonlethal.  An antagonist in this sense is a drug that blocks the effects of another drug.  I’m assuming some kind of advanced antagonist that only kicks in once a certain dosage is reached, and is somehow able to calibrate itself for different-sized bodies, different metabolisms, etc. through some kind of chemical feedback.  I’m not sure that actually makes any medical sense, though.  (Perhaps it’s activated when blood oxygen levels fall below a certain point, or something?)  ~Christopher L. Bennet, Annotation for Typhon Pact: The Struggle Within"
DaystromInstitute,3b1gnp,RedDwarfian,6,Thu Jun 25 14:34:08 2015 UTC,"It's possible that in spite of the scary name the gas has multiple uses and that it would be hard to replace. The station was built around Cardassian hardware, and if some system was designed around this gas then retrofitting the station to use something else may have been prohibitively disruptive. Also, many chemicals that we find handy, such as chlorine, can be used in harmful ways. It might be that the gas was produced on demand from some other harmless and useful substance that the station was stocked with."
DaystromInstitute,3b1gnp,Mirror_Sybok,8,Thu Jun 25 05:21:41 2015 UTC,"It's listed during a Voyager episode a standard anesthetic; most likely, it's the concentration that differentiates between unconsciousness and death."

It doesn't seem like the kind of thing you'd pick up on general scans and I doubt the Cardassians would volunteer information about its existence.  When were they supposed to know to get rid of this stuff?"
DaystromInstitute,3b1gnp,chimney3,2,Thu Jun 25 12:58:12 2015 UTC,"It could simply be that the supplies of gas were wholly or partially isolated, but never removed (since Starfleet had enough trouble getting DS9 in working order after the Cardassians trashed it when they abandoned it at the start, upgrading it for the Dominion War, and having to go to Empok Nor for spares).  It's also noted in Way of the Warrior that DS9 was difficult to take scans of due to the starion's construction, so they might never have detected it - or gone looking for it.  There's a real world analogue for this - in a lot of ships and rigs, Engine Rooms and SCRs were for a long time fitted with Halon deluge systems for firefighting in critical spaces.  A while after, they made Halon illegal (or severely restricted).  The simplest way to convert them was to disconnect the bottles and use the existing pipe work with another agent (e.g. CO2 or Novec 1230).  That said, there was a hell of a lot of rigs that had Halon hanging around for a long time onboard, many with the bottles in their original racks (but disconnected), long after the conversion was done."
DaystromInstitute,3b1gnp,MexicanSpaceProgram,2,Thu Jun 25 09:20:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think that there were these huge cylinders of gas just standing around in the open with Cardassian hazmat logos plastered all over them. The Cardassians were so paranoid that they had multiple fail-safe plans in place for suppression of possible rebellions, and it's quite likely that they put more obviously accessible systems in place as decoys for saboteurs--maybe even one that was ""hidden"", so that could be discovered as well--while having the real systems very well concealed. After all, they had one fail-safe system in place directed particularly at Gul Dukat in case he tried to abandon his post, as a punishment for cowardice, and Dukat had no idea that that program existed. It's part of the Cardassian totalitarian mindset, that seemed to expect betrayal and treachery around every corner. (The DS9 tech manual goes into a bit more detail on this general principle; there are originally only enough escape pods aboard the station to accomodate the senior Cardassian military officers, for example, and one Cardassian tricorder has a trilithium anti-tampering booby-trapped explosive in it, to keep enemy forces from disassembling it.)"
DaystromInstitute,3b1gnp,halloweenjack,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:35:17 2015 UTC,"I think like jrs100000 said, its highly likely that the environmental systems can easily create the gases they need (a la the protein-resequencer) or that the neurocine gas has multiple uses on the station. The station is enormous (I feel like the show never truly emphasized how enormous it truly is) and was designed by Cardassians, its possible the gas has another useful application and so the station always has plenty on hand. Your question might be more akin to ""why don't they just remove the CO2 from cars if it can poison you when inhaled"", it could be integral somewhere else onboard.   That being said, if a single program can override environmental controls and kill everyone, you think the Chief might have put some more safeguards in place or something."

It is possible that the Cardassians might have shielded the gas from detection.  Alternatively, the crew knew about the gas but had not gotten around to it. With a station is such a state of disrepair and some crisis every other week. It may have been that O'Brien did not have the time to remove the gas. They made it secure so it would not be released and moved on to something more pressing."
DaystromInstitute,3b1zb4,Eagle_Ear,9,Thu Jun 25 09:10:58 2015 UTC,"In terms of production, Message in a Bottle came after DS9's Waltz and before Who Mourns for Morn.  The most likely reason it never came up in any of the DS9 episodes (in-universe) is because everything was highly classified. The Prometheus was a classified prototype; only four people in all of Starfleet were trained to operate it. We never hear or see of it again, so it's likely the project was scrapped.  They were probably able to ""get away"" with it because raising it as a diplomatic incident would have required making knowledge of the Prometheus public and, therefore, letting the Dominion know about it. Behind the scenes diplomatic negotiations probably were along the lies of: ""you killed us, we killed you, let's call it even.""  It is unlikely that the Romulans were able to capture and hijack the Prometheus without setting a trap to make it look justified, something they no doubt used in those negotiations. They probably tricked the Prometheus into venturing into Romulan territory, or had damaged ship lure it in, then accused the Federation of attacking it. With all witnesses dead, and highly classified research in the air, the whole thing was probably swept under the table."
DaystromInstitute,3b1zb4,drafterman,8,Thu Jun 25 11:13:57 2015 UTC,"We never hear or see of it again, so it's likely the project was scrapped.   Not quite. We saw a Prometheus-class in Endgame.

I'm betting that the ship was pressed into production but didn't make it in time to fight in the war in serious numbers."

Simple, the federation needed the Romulans, if not helping them, at the very least not helping the Dominion, to provoke conflict even if it's just diplomatic between the Federation and Romulus at a time when the Federation was desperate would be mad.  Don't get me wrong, stealing a ship and killing federation citizens is not something the Federation would take lightly but the greater good would come into effect as soon as the Prometheus was back in Federation hands."
DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,CertainlyKnot,31,Wed Jun 24 14:52:10 2015 UTC,"I won't repeat what many other users have pointed out about tone. Instead, I'd like to focus on Star Trek's episodic nature.  One of the best things about Star Trek was the feeling that something radically different could be right around the corner. I don't just mean a new planet or species, but a whole new type of episode. A whole new genre could pop up any given week.  Will it be a political thriller with paranoia and tense scenes of distrust? Will it be a monster-of-the-week horror? Will it be a tense submarine-style combat? Will it be a fun romp in the holodeck? Will it be a time-traveling ""set what went wrong right"" adventure?  You didn't know, and each week presented you with a new flavor. A lot of people applaud the diversity on the bridge, but the diversity episode-to-episode is just as vital to the ""anything is out there"" spirit of the show.  It's charming, it's fun, but it's dying. Few shows indulge in the idea of each episode being a distinct concept-episode that spins its own satisfying story and them steps aside for the next adventure. I don't want Trek to succumb to what most other shows succumb to. I want a Trek that doesn't get samey, a Trek that has something new for you at the close of each episode.  I didn't like the Xindi arc in ENT specifically because it forced Trek to get samey. It prevented it from having a wide assortment of adventures to reasonably choose from, and that made it feel all the more out of place when they'd occasionally try to have a breather episode in-between dire ""the-clock-is-ticking"" moments that beg for single-path storytelling.  But Star Trek's not single path. Part of its charm is how the crew wanders through the final frontier encountering all its wild sights. That's what I'd want captured in a future Star Trek show."
DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,jimmysilverrims,10,Wed Jun 24 16:26:29 2015 UTC,"Exactly.   In a lot of ways TNG was like the Twilight Zone, but with recurring characters. An anthology.

Time travel. The sky was the limit."

DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,calgil,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:14:52 2015 UTC,A compromise would be DS9. A strong arc but also random and different episodes every so often. Frankly I think your point is well made...Trek as it was simply wouldn't survive today. People prefer repercussions from episode to episode and a feeling of building to something rather than feeling rudderless. 'When is Danaerys going to get to Westeros?!' and 'how far is Walter White going to go?!' are nowadays superior to 'I wonder what next week's episode will be about!'  That said I think I'm in the minority with this view in the Institute simply because that sort of classic trek never interested me. I don't really like TNG but I adore the later seasons of DS9.
DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,IkLms,-1,Wed Jul 1 11:37:27 2015 UTC,I think you are completely wrong on that. The worst part of TNG and TOS was that lack of long tied together stories. Straight up episodic content sucks ass to watch
DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,Heaney555,5,Wed Jun 24 23:21:23 2015 UTC,Straight up episodic content made Star Trek. It's why it's so good.
DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,lyraseven,112,Thu Jun 25 09:34:47 2015 UTC,"I actually think Star Trek is at its best when it's allowed to stretch its legs. Perhaps 22 episodes a season is rather much if we want another good half-dozen seasons out of a resurgence, but ten is too few if we want long story arcs and the good old moral-issue-of-the-week or intra-ship socializing that make up some of the very best Trek episodes there are.  Likewise, gritty is fine occasionally, but part of what previously made Star Trek unique was its optimism. Sometimes that could get grating, but there's a balance to be struck. TNG rarely beat you over the head with anything; half the time the moral-issue-of-the-week boiled down to half the department heads on one side, half on the other with Picard as the voice of middle ground.  In a modern remake of Star Trek, one intended to pander to Netflix's idea of what people want, can you imagine episodes like 'Elementary, my Dear Data' and 'Ship in a Bottle' happening in a gritty, story arc focused Netflix series? Let alone happen, and when issues such as 'what is life?' are brought up seriously considered instead of flippantly dismissed with one lazy catch-all answer? In fact, would we get anything as serious-but-light as the various holodeck malfunction episodes?  I think DS9 just nearly had the balance between long, ongoing galactic politicking, both implied and directly participated in, while TNG had nearly the perfect balance of weighty philosophy vs whimsical comic relief vs serious drama (e.g. Pen Pal, Data's Day, Chain of Command in that order).   TNG gave a sense of wider events going on, in which it dipped in and out while dealing with its own unique problems, all of which were as interesting or more than what was going on in the galaxy. The recurring poker games set a fantastic sense of camaraderie that there wouldn't be time to indulge in in a ten-episode, heavily arc based season, as did the holodeck excursions and plays the crew put on.  While DS9 did have its moments of whimsy, by and large they failed (that baseball episode, anyone?), and it had its stabs at philosophy but in my opinion came on too strong much of the time (that episode with Sisko a segregation-era writer[1]). It ironically for the largest viewpoint spacecraft we follow felt almost claustrophobic in its narrow focus on the politics surrounding the wormhole, without those two things. I understand that all that politicking was a natural consequence of the wormhole, and they were certainly interesting in their own right, but damn if I didn't long for the days of flying into a fairy-dust nebula and turning into spiders now and then.  There's a middle ground to be had - a cup of both DS9 and TNG, a dash of Voyager's ambition but with better, fewer writers and far less meddling, a tiny pinch of TOS' camp now and then, in a 14-16 episode season with a plot arc and the occasional 'day off', and I think we could have the perfect Star Trek.  [1] It's a fine story with a good message in its own right, but they didn't half belabor it and it was kind of distasteful, in my opinion, to use the third black main character they've ever bothered with for a racial equality episode that didn't even bother with sci-fi allegory. It smacked of tokenism and box-ticking (""hey, we haven't done a segregation allegory in a while!"" ""Sure, but allegory is hard, can't we just send him back in time?"")."
DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,thenewtbaron,9,Wed Jun 24 15:20:09 2015 UTC,"I am going to give a suggestion for a setting. It is one I give almost every time something like this comes up.  Captain Nog, about 20-30 years past DS9. he is piloting a craft sort of like a larger defiant. He is doing an expedition/help set up new colonies in a newly opened area of the delta quadrant. he has contact with starfleet but he is a bit outside of the normal sphere of influence..basically they can help him but it would be weeks till they get there. there are a couple of main colonies - a mainline federation one, a semi-independent human, and maybe a couple of other species that we haven't seen a great deal of in past treks.  crew would be a first officer human who was mildly borged but was able to be saved. molly o'brien as weapons, a gregarious klingon/half-klingon doctor, a cardassian engineer. fill in others as needed.  First season could be able establishing/contacting the colonies and gaining their trust and getting them to trade or work together. small threats such as pirates.  second season could be about the pirates setting their sights directly on the colonies however nog is able to get help from pirate's homeworlds who are sick of the pirate's shit.  I think Nog would be a good choice because he is battle tested but doesn't much like battles - his bloodlust has been tempered. He relies on his ability to make deals, understanding people's motives and their systems/tech.  with that time frame, if you wanted to do any guest shots from TNG, Voy, or DS9, they would be appropriately aged. You can bring the changelings back if needed. Maybe the pirates are running away from advancing borg. if you want a bit of gritty, actually show the aftermath of a borging on a whole colony. if you want a downer and full ending you could have captain nog, sacrificing his ship and life to give the colonist a way to escape."

You would think that with a shorter season, they're like a condensed version of the longer shows, but the strange thing is that they seem to actually have less rushing than network TV, not more.  If you've seen either of the two shows, you'd know that they both have frequent moments where they're content to just let the camera run. Pregnant pauses give replies weight. Moments watching a character alone and soaking in the scene happen just enough to let episodes breathe and feel unrushed.  Compare that to most network television, even a fair chunk of Star Trek. If A-Plot dialogue isn't happening, B-Plot dialogue is. There are very few moments, save for a handful of episodes, that allow a scene to breathe.  So, I suppose that's what I'd like. I don't want an arc that loads up a lot of content and takes up a lot of episodes, especially if it just goes around in circles in a stalling pattern.    In fact, would we get anything as serious-but-light as the various holodeck malfunction episodes?   Actually, I've never been happy with holodeck episodes.   I don't feel like Star Trek's ever really made a holodeck episode that didn't hinge on a contrivance or leap of logic. This, combined with the silliness of the setting, can make the philosophizing feel out-of-place or heavy-handed.  A holodeck is insane. It's effectively magic, and the ethical questions raised by its very existence are never really questioned. If the holodeck comes back, I'd like any humor do be of a Terry  Gilliam sort. Something that critiques the maddening absurdity of a society that's created life capable of existential crisis just so they can play poker with Stephen Hawking.  However, I agree that Star Trek's optimism is what stands it out from the crowd. I don't want BSG, I want Star Trek and part of that is embracing the fun, friendly parts of the show. I feel like losin that is kind of losing Star Trek's identity.  I want something that's, as you say, kind of a mix. I didn't really realize how much I wanted that until you said something, so I guess that's a delta? Do we do deltas with this?"

Buffy the Vampire Slayer-esque seasons with individual story arcs to which most episodes ultimately contribute in some way. That's a pretty common way to do seasonal TV intended to be consumed linearly instead of in random snippets during syndication. It's a good way, too, but long story arcs (longer than maybe a three-parter - I know I needed a break after Chain of Command) can get a little heavy without something to break them up and that's where Q, the holodeck, transporter malfunctions and strange nebulae effects come in - and aren't all of those things contrived and near-magical?

Moriarity was fundamentally a self-serving crook able to use the right-sounding words to give his Federation adversaries pause while he screwed with them. He also didn't really object to the Enterprise 'playing god', he was glad to be alive and wanted to make the most of the opportunity and that's where his conflict came in - he wasn't able to leave the holodeck.  Done later, on VOY or beyond, and made more of an issue of how right it is to create super-realistic simulations of people at all because they come sentient so frequently, we could have a Measure of a Man-esque episode where the use of advanced holodeck AI itself is on trial.  If we had a hope in hell of Star Trek ever doing a really dark show, there could even be an episode with 'the woman in the red dress' so to speak becoming sentient and charging those who've used her program with assault... but Star Trek wouldn't touch that with an eleven foot pole. To be honest, I don't think ST specifically should either, though it'd be interesting for someone to do sooner or later."

Hell, I could stand a Q who's a touch darker and tougher on whatever crew we followed, in response to the occasionally darker and tougher tone of the setting we're fantasizing about right now. A Q whose lessons turn even more mean than he could already be because someone like Janeway pushes their luck too far one day (do yourself a favor, skip any Q-related episode of VOY besides Death Wish, but watch that one) would be a terrifying thing to behold, and if they could still make it sympathetic like they did in Q Who, I'd pay to see that."
DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,Ramuh,8,Wed Jun 24 16:36:00 2015 UTC,I am a bit curious to see a Q that's both charismatic and ostentatious and legitimately frightening.

Q as a disciplinarian, though, a genuinely angry Q, genuinely provoked and not through a situation he manipulated (like Picard's claim of readiness, which Q prompted out of him at length), Q putting a crew through a genuine punishment that will stick with them forever, and not a funny pretend time-out just to scare them... that's scifi worth making.  It'd make his future appearances as menacing as I think they were meant to be originally, but the scarcity of truly serious moments from Q, and Deja Q happening too soon after his first appearances/after not enough 'lessons', kind of wasted a lot of his potential, in my opinion.  I think we'd have seen vengeful-deity Q if Sisko or anyone around Sisko had ever dared to punch him again. He let that go once because it was brave and unexpected. Any more, and it'd be contemptuous, and that'd have been a mistake. But no one dared. I think they knew they'd used their one free pass."

You would think that with a shorter season, they're like a condensed version of the longer shows, but the strange thing is that they seem to actually have less rushing than network TV, not more.   I could be wrong, but I think part of this is the lack of commercial breaks - first of all, the programming is a bit longer each episode, and secondly and more importantly, it's not broken into little segments and there's no ""gaps"" in the flow of the episode (even if you watch a show without commercials that originally had them, there's still a fade out and fade in that breaks you into reality).  I also think that most of the things you're calling for basically play into Trek as a feature film rather than as a TV series at all - shorter and more condensed... grittier and without the confines of network TV limitations... the problem with the films is that they also have to pander to wide audiences and that's similar crap to network influences.  I agree with others that a moderate season of 12-20 episodes is totally fine. I love trek episodes (and other series' episodes) that take you out of the ongoing plot even in the midst of a long arc and does a one-off lighter story. Some of the concept episodes are the best Trek episodes (others are the worst. It just comes down to proper writing).  Gotham is a network series that has managed to have a lot of the arcing and grittiness that I expect from cable series but it has done so on network. I don't think that Trek necessarily can't be on network. It just needs to be somewhere where the network allows it to be something different than classic trek."

Also, because the Netflix stuff doesn't have to fit into some kind of programming an episode doesn't have to be exactly 42 minutes, which also helps I guess."

I also note that for network shows, if you watch them without commercials, the cliffhanger doesn't accomplish anything except jarring you into reality and making you realize how the dialogue going into the commercial totally doesn't flow into the dialogue coming out of the commercial."

DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,Heaney555,14,Wed Jun 24 18:14:24 2015 UTC,"I think if Star Trek is going to hold weight and address big issues that are important to us in present-day, it'll have to get dark. The best television works with shades of grey and elements of real death-facing danger and uncertainty. I'm not saying the show should be grim, but something closer to DS9 feels like the only thing that will produce the level of thoughtful, hard-hitting television Star Trek deserves.   Star Trek had no problem taking on more serious issues than we face today in between episodes about Tribbles or fistfight with the Gorn. It did not bend to the populist desire for ""dark and gritty"" until Enterprise was released, and I think Enterprise suffered greatly because of that.  A new show should certainly return to the philosophical episodes with serious and applicable moral dilemmas, but the single most important theme in the entire franchise is optimism for the future. Optimism is more important than the characters, than then setting, than the idea of FTL exploration itself. Federarion,ng optimism is why Tomorrow Land felt more like ""Star Trek"" than did ST 2009.  I think Roddenberry's entire point was to give us hope for our future, and perhaps to inspire us. The show was not about Klingons and warp drive, it was about how great things could be if we got past our petty primitive bullshit, if instead of being motivated by greed and hatred we started working together for the betterment of ourselves and mankind. It is one of the only franchises I can think of that shows mankind as inherently good, that shows science as overwhelmingly positive force, and that shows government as effective and reasonable. Almost all other futures portrayed in modern media feature either an evil corrupt government, a humanity even more barbaric than we are, or science as an uncontrollable force that we were fools to play with (killing us by terminators, matrix squidbots, zombies, I am Legend vampires, dimensional rifts, or hybrid dinosaurs).   We need Star Trek, we need inspiration to better ourselves, and we need to believe that the future can be better.  You can add dark storylines and threaten the utopia that is the Federarion, but if you destroy it or compromise it, or take away the optimism of the show, you take away the soul of Star Trek."
DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,NEM3S1S,9,Wed Jun 24 15:54:05 2015 UTC,"optimism is why Tomorrow Land felt more like ""Star Trek"" than did ST 2009   That's funny (and perhaps very apt), because Damon Lindelof worked on both screenplays.  I can't really go much deeper than that, as I haven't actually seen Tomorrowland, but it's interesting to see something coming from the same writer that has such a different spirit.  And to add onto what you're saying about optimism, I've felt like Star Trek's at it's best when it's showing optimism in the face of darkness.   I've always felt like Star Trek gets most boring and most full of itself when it's just shadowboxing its ideals of a bright future for humanity. As if humanity and the Federation are simply above difficult moral issues or vices.   The best episodes of Star Trek, like The Drumhead show that the road to this bright future isn't paved. It has to be blazed, and it has hazards and obstacles all its own.  Because, to be honest, it's infinitely more inspiring to see imperfect people in a perfect world doing their best to make it better than to see perfection continue on a perfect path of flawlessness.  Star Trek should always be a bright candle, but it burns just a little bit brighter when you're willing to take it into dark places, and while I don't know if that's what /u/CertainlyKnot means in their vision of a new Trek, but it's something that I believe a new Trek should do."
DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,NEM3S1S,7,Wed Jun 24 16:41:19 2015 UTC,"Star Trek should always be a bright candle, but it burns just a little bit brighter when you're willing to take it into dark places, and while I don't know if that's what /u/CertainlyKnot means in their vision of a new Trek,   I agree with everything you said. There wouldn't be a show if everyone just happily lived in paradise, and there wouldn't be any moral lessons if the crew never faced moral dilemmas.   My point was that no matter what darkness they pass through, they should end up back in the light. Threaten paradise, but don't destroy it. I'd like more episodes like Under the Pale Moonlight, not Walking Dead style ""everything is hopeless"", nor 24 style ""ends always justify the means"".   At one point there were plans for a ""gritty"" series set in the 25th century after the Federation fell due to war with the Romulans that ended with a massive exchange of WMDs (omega based I believe). A single captain in an old ship was trying to reunite the Federation (stolen directly from Andromeda, which was also Roddenberry's IP), but in the chaos all they were really trying to do was survive at any cost. That is not Star Trek, it's just set in the Star Trek universe.  There are dozens of ""gritty"" shows about survival and doing whatever it takes, Trek should be generally optimistic. It should not cater to the public's current appetite, it should show optimism and hope, and make us like it - just as it did in 1960s when people wanted simple Westerns and instead got veiled criticisms of racism and the cold war."

DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,edsobo,7,Thu Jun 25 09:35:45 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree. I don't watch TV anyway, so I'd love for it to be on Netflix. I don't think it's the only successful venue, but I get what you're saying. They do make good shows. If there's going to be a Captain Worf, it's going to be on Netflix. The only problem is getting Paramount to agree. I don't like all-at-once releases. The suspense of waiting for next week is something I actually really like. The only time I think it gets old is when an entire series is done in serial, like Once Upon a Time. For me, the cliffhanger ending got really old after season 3. The whole series doesn't have to be in serial, much like how the early seasons of DS9 weren't. I think you're wrong here. Plenty of shows, Trek included, use the 22-episode format, longer in some cases (I've seen 26-episode seasons). Being a Doctor Who fan, I understand all too well the frustration of a short season. I want to spend half the year with the crew. Also remember that Star Trek is (or was) first and foremost a morality play, that's how Roddenberry intended it. Storytelling is second to that purpose. DS9 used serial storytelling to push morals, but knew not to overdo it. Having filler episodes is perfectly fine. Some of my favorite episodes are filler (Death Wish (VOY), for one). I understand the desire to avoid the reset button, but it was really only VOY that got carried away with that. DS9 didn't hit the reset button, with each episode's events actually affecting later ones, in a non-serial way. I really like DS9. As a Doctor Who fan, I can tell you exactly why I'm STRONGLY OPPOSED. Who was a fun, family-friendly show about a magic man in a blue box, who traveled across time and space saving people and being a generally cool guy... until Matt Smith. With the arrival of Doctor #11, the show took a very dark turn, the Doctor became more vengeful and scary, to the point where literally every villain he ever faced put aside all differences and united against him... twice. He risked his companions' lives, screwed up a lot of things, hit the reset button on the universe when it got particularly bad, and was overall a very unpleasant dude. Star Trek is a fun, family-friendly show about a bunch of explorers in a spaceship travelling across space saving people and being generally cool... can you see where I'm going with this? Trek is not a dark show, and is not well-suited for it. It keeps things light, so that when things do get dark, it means something. When you're used to a generally lighthearted atmosphere, you feel the weight of the dark moments that much more. Forward, yes. Forward based on the Abramsverse, please Rod no. If the show were to go forward based on what we know from Trek '09, we'd assume that ""Red Matter"" exists, that the Romulans have Borg tech in mining vessels (yeah, mining vessels), and that Romulus is destroyed (Side note: We can't call the star ""Hobus"" because that's not canon). There are two ways to go. One is to ignore what was put forth in the Abrams films and continue along business as usual. The second is to jump into the future far enough that it doesn't matter either way. Isn't this the same thing as #6?"
DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,usonano,7,Wed Jun 24 17:00:55 2015 UTC,"EDIT: The comment I was responding to was deleted. The gist of it was pointing out that Doctor Who can also be quite dark.  Definitely the second airing, the original was originally designed as a kid's show and is generally lighter (and ironically, highly serialized). However, the new version never got irredeemably dark until Smith's Doctor.  Warning: I'm going to talk about Doctor Who a lot, but trust me, I have a point.  TL;DR: If a new Trek series is to be successful, it has to have tonal shifts. A constant tone, be it dark or light or somewhere in between, will kill the show faster than a Redshirt in TOS.  Back when Doctor Who started, it was very fantastical and theatrical, in that, no matter what, you always knew that the Doctor was going to save the day at the end. You see that a lot in old shows, even in TOS (look, I'm referencing Star Trek!). You knew that even if The Master had the Doctor in mortal peril or the Daleks were closing in, The Doctor always had a way to fix things in the end, and he always did. We got our happy ending, and we had fun. TOS was the exact same way. The Enterprise got in trouble, Kirk and Co. worked out a solution, and the ship went along its merry way.  Cut to the new millennium: It's 2005, and Doctor Who is on the air. When the series got restarted with Eccleston as the Doctor, the showrunners did the smart thing by updating to present-day effects, settings, and dialogue, while also retaining the original's basic feel. The first episode is way dark, people are killed (offscreen deaths, heavily implied), all of London is in a panic, but our smiling and sassy Doctor comes through in the end and saves the day. As the series continues, the Doctor maintains his cheery demeanor, but, in the words of my mother: ""When the Doctor loses his smile, you know stuff is about to go down."" We always feel hopeful because the Doctor is hopeful. When he loses his upbeat mannerisms, we as the audience immediately shift into another mindset. ""The Empty Child"" episodes show this really well. That whole two-parter is immensely dark (literally, it takes place at night to drive home that point), but the Doctor is for some reason really ok with everything. As the story progresses, he gets a little more serious, until the end, when everything works out and he triumphantly declares: ""Everybody lives!""  Tennant's Doctor was much the same. Always joking, always sarcastic, always so happy to be alive and to share the universe with his companions. But Smith's wasn't. By the time he took over, he had lost his former charm. It's what they played on in the 50th Anniversary special, that he had forgotten who he was in an attempt to bury his past. He got careless, he got vengeful, he even straight up damned a few civilizations. He went from the man who had mercy on a Dalek, to a man who would wipe out the entire cosmos to get what he wanted. It wasn't until Smith's final episode that he finally realized just what he had become, and welcomed his death as just and fair. Of course, he regenerated, and now we have a Doctor who's more along the lines of every Doctor that isn't Smith. He's quirky, upbeat, hopeful, but has a very serious side, just like all the rest.  Believe it or not, Star Trek actually had that exact same character arc, only in Trek, they planned it, they accounted for it, and they resolved it. Captain Kirk was the bold captain who merrily trekked across the stars, looking out for his crew and going on many missions exploring the wonders of the galaxy. He never shied away from a fight, but he was first and foremost a man of peace.  Cut to a few decades later. Kirk has lost his best friend, and is desperately trying to search for him. In a heated battle, his own son is killed by a Klingon. Having lost his son and his friend, Kirk began to have a different outlook on life. He took risks, only instead of risking his own life, he began to risk the lives of his friends and loved ones, even the whole galaxy. In a brash move, he rocketed back in time to save some whales. He could have very well caused a massive chain reaction that would have had terrible consequences, but he did it anyway. He openly questioned and insulted God to His face, knowing full well what could happen to him and everyone else present. Sure, it ended up just being a powerful alien and not actually God, but still, he didn't know that.  Kirk's arc does have a good conclusion, though. His hatred towards the Klingons is one of the key themes of The Undiscovered Country. Was this hatred a plotline weaved into the series three movies earlier done intentionally to set up this one? Who knows, but they resolved it beautifully.  I mention the Doctor as a specific example because he's the core of the show. As he goes, the show goes. When he's upbeat, the tone is upbeat, and we're happy. When he's serious, the tone is serious, and we're uneasy. The writers balance this excellently to create deep and engaging stories that never get too dark. Star Trek does the same thing. It can get dark, but it always resolves to a hopeful place at the end. The same thing happened with Kirk's story.  The most important thing to notice about both examples is this: The tone never stays the same. By beginning and ending on high, hopeful notes, the darker moments are immensely more powerful. Think about Wrath of Khan. When Spock died, it was intense, it was impactful, and remains one of the most well-done scenes of all time, because it was beautifully contrasted against a very hopeful and generally happy backdrop of the rest of Trek. By contrast, think about Harvey Dent in The Dark Knight. The whole movie is so dark and so monotone that his fall from grace and subsequent death had exactly zero impact. It's a good movie, don't get me wrong, but when a dark moment is thrown against a dark backdrop, there's nothing to care about. Now stretch that into an entire season and you start to see the problem.  I know this is a long post and seems like a lot of meandering, but the point is this: Doctor Who and Star Trek are two of the most-beloved and longest-running franchises in television history, and they are that way for a very good reason. Sure, they have their missteps, but as long as the writers have the core principles that the show was founded upon at heart, they'll find a way to course-correct and make something great."
DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,jimmysilverrims,4,Wed Jun 24 22:33:31 2015 UTC,"Netflix or Amazon would be amazing, but I don't know if Paramount is forward-thinking enough to go that direction yet. Things are going to change quickly, though, so I wouldn't be surprised if something like this happens sooner rather than later."
DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,usonano,4,Wed Jun 24 23:47:29 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you've said and would love to see Trek on Netflix, but since you asked me to change your view:  Netflix has done well, but this is ground that HBO has traveled many times before. They've put out several high-quality series with strong continuity. They aren't afraid of dark programming with social commentary relevant to the current times. The only drawback is that HBO would (probably) go with a weekly release instead of all-at-once, but that hasn't hurt them in any of their other offerings."
DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,Kazinsal,2,Wed Jun 24 15:13:34 2015 UTC,HBO would be amazing for Star Trek. Their production quality is fantastic and they are willing to spend money for a superior product.
DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,adamkotsko,2,Wed Jun 24 19:06:03 2015 UTC,"But would their model really work for Star Trek?  Don't get me wrong, I love a lot of HBO programming, but their whole schtick is ""gratuitous sex and violence"". Entire terms like ""sexposition"" had to be invented just to describe how much sex they cram into every show.  And while Star Trek can be argued as having plenty of sex appeal (TOS is guilty in particular), I can't imagine a bloody Star Trek. Can you?"
DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,adamkotsko,2,Thu Jun 25 03:35:32 2015 UTC,"Hmm.. I wonder if they could respect the philosophical and cerebral aspects of, say, TNG while still having the epic battles of, say, DS9. Sexy Star Trek is okay but I honestly felt like it doesn't really fit the theme of the show (especially in ENT, but unfortunately ""The Naked Now"" also comes to mind. I wish I could forget ""The Naked Now"").  Basically all this to say I agree with you, I didn't really consider the sexy or bloody aspects of HBO."
DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,snoobic,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:54:15 2015 UTC,"I think another issue with signing with HBO over Netflix is audience. I don't know many Trek fans without Netflix, but I know a great many Trek fans without HBO -- myself included. In theory a show that Netflix produces themselves has a lot greater potential reach re: regions. While CBS or whoever currently owns Trek's TV rights would have the final say over regions of distribution on Netflix, HBO is limited also by how many countries they have service in (basically US/CAN/UK/BR and a chunk of the EU) and how many people in those smaller countries have HBO vs. how many have Netflix.  I suppose we couldn't make an accurate estimate as to how many people Netflix vs. HBO would receive a new Trek series, because the will of CBS and anyone else who has some sort of rights to Trek TV has to be factored in, unlike a new theoretical IP where it's simply a matter of ""how many people have English-language Netflix"" vs. ""how many people have English-language HBO"".  (Unrelated to this particular thread, but my opinion on the whole idea: just give Ronald D. Moore the reigns of whatever type of Trek show can be made and I'll buy the blu-rays. A new Trek fusing the feeling of both DS9 and Galactica would likely become my favourite Trek series.)"
DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,phtll,6,Thu Jun 25 04:06:36 2015 UTC,"In my view, it needs to be far enough in the future that 99% of the present continuity isn't immediately relevant. Setting a new show in the aftermath of the Dominion War or the destruction of Romulus (especially since the latter was so randomly foisted on the Prime Timeline by the reboot movies) would return to narrative territory that is already pretty parched and used up -- the TNG/DS9/VOY-era galaxy has had 21 seasons of exploration in 14 years! I say if people want more stories building off of that era, they should frankly just read the novels, which provide more than enough material to keep you busy for years if not decades.   More generally, I'd point out that the greatest failure among modern Star Trek shows was also the one that was most hemmed in by existing continuity -- namely, Enterprise. Both DS9 and VOY picked up on their predecessors, but they didn't presuppose that you'd watched all that went before and mostly avoided stories that only made sense if you knew the previous canon well (though I think DS9 was a little too self-indulgent in that area, especially with all the Mirror Universe stuff).   I think a big part of what made TNG such a hit is that people felt like they were getting in on the ground floor. No subsequent series was able to capture that. But we have a model for how to do it -- just shove it forward into the future. Change what you want to change and explain it by pointing out that a lot happens in 100 years or however long."
DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,calgil,2,Thu Jun 25 08:35:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in my mind I've wanted a show set in the year 3000 similar to what Fuller suggested for 'Federation'. Something that shows the dissolution of the Federation. A serious change to the galaxy's political landscape."

DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,HowdyDoodlyDoo,3,Wed Jun 24 22:37:21 2015 UTC,"The theory is the more output required, the more problems will be encountered: diluted output from a small staff, or inconsistency from a large staff."
DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,azpx,0,Wed Jun 24 20:30:55 2015 UTC,"Usually because a longer season is not the idea of the creatives, but the execs. They have in mind what they need to tell a story (or stories) but then are forced to churn out more too. It's often why filler can be terrible even though it doesn't have to be - the creators never thought it necessary, they were forced to think of it, and forced creation can understandably produce mistakes."
DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,NEM3S1S,2,Wed Jun 24 21:03:02 2015 UTC,"Mostly all good points, but let's not forget that some of Trek's best episodes came from a need to create filler episodes. Some of the worst too, granted. But definitely some of the best episodes were ones that didn't contribute to the overall arc."
DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,Bramblinman,2,Wed Jul 1 11:47:36 2015 UTC,"You know, as much as I'm irritated by the split-season nonsense going on with AMC these days, it might lend itself to story arcs that are not overly long but fleshed out enough to tell compelling tales. Since shows go on Netflix more and more often, there's also less of a worry of forcing something to be purely episodic to meet syndication demands. You can also get more intimate with a character as their life situation changes."
DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,GiantSquidBoy,2,Wed Jun 24 18:11:45 2015 UTC,"I think the episodic format works much better for Star Trek, however I think there should be much more focus on character development across the series - something that DS9 did really well, especially with the many recurring characters.  In the other Trek shows, it feels like most of the characters are the same at the end of the show.   Another thing I'd love is more of an ensemble cast. Things like a proper away team (including a medic, on-site engineer, security, etc) rather than taking away the bridge crew. Of course, the captain and first officer can go on most of these and a bridge crew member can be involved with the odd away mission. A proper shuttle pilot would also make sense."
DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,iansarmy1,3,Wed Jun 24 22:23:57 2015 UTC,"1.   Agree completely.    2.   Agree.    3.   Mostly agree.   A weekly schedule isn't necessarily bad if done well. Shows like Babylon 5, DS9, Breaking Bad, etc... has proven it. But I love binge watching some shows. I couldn't put down my tablet when I started watching Marco Polo.    4.   Mostly Disagree.   I don't think a ""Season"" needs to be limited anymore by a number of Episodes. What is produced should be what's in the best interest for the story, whether that's 5 Episodes or 30. With a rich universe like Trek, I think an overwhelming amount of Episodes could be made per season and they'd be great...given the right cast, crew, etc...    5.   Somewhat agree.   Dark isn't inherently bad or good for storytelling. But, it can get tiresome. This is why we saw lots of fluff/light filler Episodes in DS9. Moreover, going after some contemporary issues with Star Trek's blind optimism would be a refreshing change of pace from modern Television, which is either mind-numbing stupidity or Dark for the sake of dark. Instead of dark, how about a show where the story reflects what atmosphere is needed?   6.   Somewhat agree.   While going forward would be OK, at the same time, I feel like Trek would have an opportunity to do something amazing with the reboot universe. Let's see another ship and crew explore the galaxy while the Enterprise gets its time in the Theatres. They could have some fan-service moments (who didn't enjoy the nod to Nurse Chapel or the Mudd incident?) but blaze their own path!   7.   points up to #6"
DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,garibaldi3489,4,Thu Jun 25 10:15:26 2015 UTC,"don't think a ""Season"" needs to be limited anymore by a number of Episodes.    I was more-or-less speaking practically.  If Netflix does Star Trek, it's likely going to be the most expensive show they've ever produced. (I think I read somewhere TNG cost about as much as GoT does today, adjusting for inflation). Unlike pretty much every other show they've made, a Star Trek show is going to need a hefty special effects budget.   The aliens can't just be something glued to an actor's forehead. The space battles needs to be dynamic and striking. Spectacle is, in my mind, a big part of Trek. TMP-level beauty and scale is something I'd like out of a new Star Trek, and that means some serious special effects.  Which means that a run of Star Trek needs to be practical. I could have 22 episodes with a very modest budget and very few mind-blowing effects and sequences, but I'd much prefer just 10 with the best possible budget.  I'd love Trek on-tap all the time, but I'm trying to keep my expectations reasonable.   Dark isn't inherently bad or good for storytelling.   Well, I feel like weighty issues lend themselves to darkness.  I mean, if you think that staring at a problem knowing there's no good solution is dark, than I want dark. I want character to face no-win scenarios and have to make hard decisions that ask what characters are willing to sacrifice and do in the name of their philosophy.   That said, I'm tired of the ""gritty reboot"" trend, which is why I said I don't want a Trek that's grim. I don't want brooding either. I don't want character to be miserable all the time. I just want the show to be more willing to approach issues that might not always have a happy solution. To be willing to take the really hard issues and not give themselves an easy out.  By that same token, I don't want them to abandon Trek's cheeriness. Damn, this is getting tricky. I think I'm getting a different idea about what I want from Trek the more I think about it, but I do want the show to be willing to dig into darker issues (although I want it to be balanced out by the show's optimism and humor too).   They could have some fan-service moments (who didn't enjoy the nod to Nurse Chapel or the Mudd incident?) but blaze their own path!   I'm still worried that a show trying to remake Trek, even partially, will be burdened by all the expectations. I actually didn't like STID at all, specifically because of how much it tried to recapture moments from the TOS films."

DaystromInstitute,3ayhbn,jimmysilverrims,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:04:05 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree with your line of reasoning and have said before that the best way to go would be shorter seasons (10-15 episodes) in the style of high quality serialized cable dramas, with both shorter and series spanning arcs. I also would just a like a simple crew on a starship setup with new characters instead of some of these silly ideas like trying to revive Berman era Star Trek with 60+ year old actors (Captain Worf) or adapting some overused TV formula to Trek universe (CSI or some young adult coming of age drama set at the Academy).   It's almost guaranteed that CBS will farm a new series out to one of its subsidiary networks or a partner like Netflix. Netflix has interested for a while but its talks with CBS haven't gone anywhere. I think the stumbling block is that they're concerned about overexposing the franchise right now, and also the minefield of where and when to set a new series. Would it be in the JJ universe, the Prime universe or another hard/soft reboot of TOS or maybe even TNG? I don't think anyone quite knows what to do with Star Trek right now. The new films, no matter what your opinion is of their quality, were mainly just cash grabs meant to capitalize on the popular nostalgia for TOS, and they'll leave the franchise in an awkward situation after they're finished."

Your post is actually a good example of why I'm not a fan of the format: it being a ""CMV"" didn't add anything. Under the CMV format, we would have removed any comments who agree with you, and that seems kind of silly given how reasonable your opinion is.  We did not handle this experiment well and we will learn from it in the future. It was an experiment which we only put into play three days ago, and we've decided it didn't really work out. Better to end it now, then to let it drag on for a few more weeks and end it then with even more posts under the CMV tag.

Everyone was saying that Netflix was the best solution for Trek, specifically this kind of Trek. I wanted to hear arguments against it and imagine other ways to go about it.  I even got great responses that made me change my mind. Does that add something? Isn't that the point of CMV posts?  I mean, this was my very first post here at Daystrom. I'd been lurking for a while, and the CMV tag inspired me to finally make something. It did better than I ever could have imagined. Everyone seemed to really like it. It feels pretty darn low to have it pulled without getting any say in the matter, especially when I didn't do anything wrong.   Your post is actually a good example of why I'm not a fan of the format   This is sort of what bothers me. You keep saying ""we"", but I didn't have any say in this. No user got a chance to have their say. And then here you slip and admit that it's really you that doesn't like the format.

Just because you're not making any more CMV posts doesn't mean that my post has to be removed. How come my work has to get erased because of some format shuffle?  I mean, I can't even think of a way to repost this. I only made this post to explain my view and try and get it changed. Now that my view is changed I have no idea what I'm supposed to post. What am I supposed to write down in a repost?  Besides, the comments were the real interesting thing, and a new thread won't have any of them.   This just seems silly. Why not just make another meta post saying ""CMV is cancelled"" and let my post just be? I don't think anyone's going to be confused if there's no tag anymore."

That's actually one of the points which came up in the mods' discussion of this experiment: shouldn't any opinion posted to Daystrom be open to changing? Isn't that the entire point of an in-depth discussion subreddit?  You can also post Trek-themed questions in /r/changemyview, I've seen them posted there before. You could even start your own subreddit dedicated to the concept, and we'd be happy to promote it.

DaystromInstitute,3azz1p,androidbitcoin,5,Wed Jun 24 21:29:18 2015 UTC,I Enterprise it was indicated that the Denobulans had been using genetic engineering in a responsible manner since something like the 20th century (I'm not sure about the date). If the Federation had laws against genetic engineering at the time of its creation the Denobulans probably told them to go pound sand. That wouldn't necessarily mean that Denobula and the Federation weren't formally allies.
DaystromInstitute,3azz1p,Mirror_Sybok,5,Wed Jun 24 23:13:42 2015 UTC,"I would move that given the size of Denobulan families, they may be less eager to join Starfleet, and I believe there was some beta canon about them taking their time even joining the Federation because Romulans murked a ton of them during the war with the Coalition of Planets and it made them very hesitant to get involved in ""big"" politics again. Even if in the future they've recovered, they may still be contributing to Starfleet in ways that may not necessarily involve providing manpower to Starfleet.  As a side to this, your sexual activity may mean special considerations and restrictions may be placed on you. Deltans have to take a vow of celibacy to even join. Denobulans aren't quite so extreme, but their social structures around sex are radically different. Remember when Phlox tried to get Trip to bang his wife, or at least teased him about it knowing he couldn't handle it? Maybe Starfleet in the future is just too much of an uptight pack of herberts for average Denobulans to want to serve.  But truthfully I've never been bothered by an alien never showing up again in alpha canon. Like a large city, it's not unreasonable for us to catch a glimpse of something new to us and never see it again simply because we only see so much at a given time. There's tons of aliens who show up once and never come back - cat women with three breasts, at least a few different muckmen aliens, fishmen, whatever. The TOS movies especially have lots of unique aliens who are never expanded on or shown again that are definitely members of the Federation."
DaystromInstitute,3azz1p,Berggeist,12,Wed Jun 24 22:54:44 2015 UTC,"Maybe they chose not to join the Federation.  Most of the species we see in the Series (around 95% or more) are not member species.  Perhaps they joined the Ferengi Alliance, or the Cardassian Union, or were swept into the Klingon Empire.    The main problem Enterprise had with introducing new species is the fact that they were clearly never seen again in the continuity of Trek.  What happened to the Suliban?  Where'd the Xindi go?  For that matter, where are all the Tellarites and Andorians in the 24th century?    Sadly, there is simply not enough information to really come up with a decent theory.  I'm going to go with the notion that they prefer the civilian sciences over Starfleet and those who do join up mainly choose postings near Denobula."

I guess they just aren't on the Enterprise D or stationed on DS9."
DaystromInstitute,3azz1p,fishey_me,2,Fri Jun 26 03:25:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah that makes a lot of sense. The Enterprise is checking out uncharted far-off territories, but Andorians are close to home. DS9 is a relatively small little civilisation on the frontier to nowhere, it just so happens no Andorians were there. Sure it'd be perfectly reasonable to have seen one but it's also not a massive plothole that we didn't.   I tend to think that as known space got bigger, the Federation expanded and galactic politics moved on, Tellarites, Denobulans, Andorians and Xindi just sort of became smaller players on a bigger stage. Being important at the beginning doesn't necessarily mean continued important. Perhaps their populations did not explode as did those of Earth and Vulcan. Perhaps they simply did not commit themselves as fully to Starfleet as a program. Perhaps they simply didn't maintain diplomatic relations well enough to remain relevant and they just sort of faded from view. Space is a big place and it's easy to not be seen, especially when everyone's looking at humans, Vulcans, Romulans, Klingons and Cardassians - the 'big players' in local politics."

Those worlds have been in the Federation so long, and there are so many officers from those races, that all those officers are concentrated in the same assignments."

DaystromInstitute,3azz1p,Count_Spockula,4,Thu Jun 25 01:15:01 2015 UTC,The only issue that I might see with that idea is that the Denobulans are pretty easy going and sociable even by human standards. If there were a significant number of them I feel like we'd be more likely to see a bunch of them mixed into other crews. You wouldn't have to worry about the Denobulans causing the kinds of social friction that Vulcans seem to be fond of causing.
DaystromInstitute,3azz1p,Mirror_Sybok,8,Wed Jun 24 23:51:43 2015 UTC,"Even if someone is easy-going and sociable, there is some difference in preferred environmental conditions between different species. Vulcans come from a planet with a much hotter climate and thinner atmosphere. Many may find that a ship set to common sea-level Earth conditions, favored by most humans, to be slightly or even very uncomfortable. That might not bother them for a day or week, but on a three-year deep space mission? Same goes for Andorians, though their home world would seem to have the opposite conditions.  That might be a good reason to have some ships that are suited and crewed predominately by one non-human species, even if humans seem to dominate Starfleet (for whatever cultural or historical reasons)."
DaystromInstitute,3azz1p,zuludown888,1 point,Thu Jun 25 02:32:49 2015 UTC,"Excellent points, but the show doesn't give us any indication that the Denobulans or Vulcans or even Andorians experience discomfort in the environment preferred by most humans. At worst, the Andorians could be argued to tire more easily in hot environments since a strategy for Archer when fighting Shran was to play carefully so that Shran would wear out. You are right though. If it hasn't been spelled out on screen they can always add details like that later."

Because the during the Earth-Romulan War, the Romulan armada bombed Denobula on their way to Earth. This had a devstating effect, not just on their infastructure, but on their very spirit. The Denobulans never re-gained their desire to ""go out there"", to explore the galaxy, they became content to stay in their little part of the galaxy.  I suppose they are a little like the Dutch, or the Portuguese, formally a big player in the grand history, now content to live peacefully in their home."

That leaves an awful lot of races to cover in a fairly limited amount of time, and with the huge starships and space stations in the TNG era they would be pretty easy to miss. For all we know, there were half a dozen Denobulans, several Xindi, and a Suliban employed in various stations aboard the Enterprise D and we just never happened to come across them."

DaystromInstitute,3azz1p,brokenlogic18,3,Thu Jun 25 00:17:22 2015 UTC,"I have two bits of head-cannon that can help make sense of this.  First, Starfleet is a HUGE organization.  There was a thread here long ago attempting to guesstimate the size of Starfleet.  The estimation was that, given the fleet sizes and number of fleets we saw in the Dominion War, Starfleet probably numbers around 20 thousand ships, if I remember correctly.  (If anyone has the link, that would be awesome.)  Now, we know that there are all-Vulcan crewed ships.  It makes sense that other races, likely the Andorians at least, have ships of their own too.  It is not racist to point out that, while all species aim to be equals in the Federation, some species do have unique social or biological traits that make functioning in a ""mixed"" setting difficult.  Imagine an Andorian (evolved in a very cool climate) serving on a Vulcan ship (a species evolved on a largely desert planet with average temperatures well over 40°C).  Do they set the thermostat really low to accommodate the Andorian, or do they set it high to accommodate the Vulcan crew?  I imagine that most member races of the Federation that join Starfleet have the option of joining a ship crewed primarily by members of their own species, or similar species, provided enough members are available to crew a ship.  I also think that members of Starfleet have the option of serving in a mixed crew, should they so desire.  The flagship of the fleet, generally a ship named ""Enterprise"", is required to be a ship with a mixed crew.  I would also imagine that other ships of the ""explorer"" type are also required to be mixed crews, given that they are usually the point of First Contact with other species.  My second bit of head-cannon is much less likely to be true.  I imagine that most species continue to have their own fleet staffed by their own people, much like the United States has a Coast Guard that is not part of the Navy.  Such a fleet would be designed, built, and crewed by the planet it belongs to (perhaps with the assistance of Starfleet); while the purpose of this fleet would be for home defense, establishing and maintaining sovereignty, law enforcement functions, and the like.  Logically, it would probably stand to reason that such fleets would be ancillary to Starfleet, the primary fleet of the Federation, and might, at times, be called-upon to conduct joint actions with Starfleet.  Particularly so during wartime.  We know that there are 150 member worlds in Starfleet over a span of 8,000 light years.  We know that Earth is probably home to billions of humans.  If every member world has a population of one billion, well, I assume you can do basic math.  The rationalization that Starfleet has somewhere in the range of 20 thousand ships then leads us to believe that the membership of Starfleet is probably no more than 10 million people.  Let's say we double that to accommodate personnel stationed on starbases or planets.  That leaves us with a membership of around 20 million, with a potential total population of the Federation at around 150 billion.  That would make the enlistment rate in Starfleet somewhere around one in ten thousand.  0.01%.  This seems to be a ludicrously and unbelievably small enlistment rate to me.  There MUST be home fleets, or species that don't participate AT ALL.  Otherwise it just doesn't make sense.  You could also postulate that Starfleet is a majority Terran organization, and everyone else either joins their home fleet organization, or just freeloads off Earth's protection of their interests.  If Starfleet is a large majority human, then, assuming an Earth population of 6 billion, that is a 0.3% enlistment rate.  That is roughly the size of active duty personnel in the United States Armed Forces today.  If you include reserve personnel, that number/percentage doubles.  That would actually make sense, given what we see on the screen.  However, it doesn't make sense that all of those other worlds would sit idly and not join Starfleet, or their own ""Coast Guard"" type fleet.  Unfortunately for this bit of head-cannon, while I personally think it makes sense, if there had been a time when we would have seen such a thing, it would have been in the Dominion War.  And we saw not even a hint of this.  Betazed was notably taken by the Dominion when its protective Starfleet fleet wasn't even in system due to being away on training maneuvers.  Clearly Betazed had no, or minimal, defenses of their own.  Unfortunately, this leaves us with a massive disparity between the population of the Federation and the size of Starfleet.  Which might point us to a theorized massive stagnation in Starfleet in the first four decades of the 2300s.  Perhaps along with a greatly stagnating rate of technological development, recruitment by Starfleet suffered as well."

We assume that the Federation is this amazing and wonderful organization that every planet should want to join, but our knowledge of Denoubulans is extremely limited.  It's just as likely that they were uncomfortable sacrificing their sovereignty to a larger interplanetary government (think Norway and the EU) or perhaps there are pacifist aspects of their culture where they found armed conflict unacceptable and allying themselves with more militant races such as the Andorians and Vulcans put them at risk of having to join them in conflicts (think Switzerland and the EU).   How could a planet that has such a deep history with all the founding members of Starfleet have such a poor presence within the organization?   Our view of Starfleet is heavily skewed because we have only seen the day-to-day lives of five Starfleet crews, all of which were overwhelmingly human.  We know that many Starfleet ships have a single dominant species on board - such as the mostly-Vulcan USS Hera.  Starfleet is also an enormous organization with a vast territory to cover.  If we assume 150 member worlds with an average citizen population of 6.5 billion, we're looking at 975 billion Federation citizens.  Even if only 0.5% of the population served in Starfleet - a fair number given that the US Military comprises a similar percentage of the US population, but Starfleet serves as a scientific and exploratory arm in addition to a military one - that would still be nearly 5 billion officers and crewmen serving in the fleet.  If Denobulans are Federation members, it's more likely that they are in Starfleet and well represented (just as we can assume Andorians and Tellarites are), but we haven't seen them because our extremely limited view of Starfleet has been too small of a sample size.  This is also probably why we have been a vast overrepresentation of humans in our view of Starfleet."
DaystromInstitute,3azz1p,6ksuit,0,Thu Jun 25 06:51:53 2015 UTC,"We don't know how many Denobulans are present in Starfleet because we see only a very very tiny fraction of what happens in the ST universe.

DaystromInstitute,3axvqc,butterhoscotch,25,Wed Jun 24 11:20:47 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest the combination of the Dominion war combined with the fear of Borg retaliation for the Admiral and Captain Janeways' destruction of one of their trans-warp hubs will encourage the integration into new classes of ship the glut of exotic, and advanced, technology brought back from the Delta quadrant by Voyager.  The Federation will certainly become the most advanced Alpha quadrant power; perhaps not by as wide a margin as the Federation of the Admiral Janeway of the alternate timeline, but by a comfortable distance. USS Voyager alone started punching well above its weight class in the Delta quadrant, let alone the Alpha, so now imagine a warship built from the ground up incorporating all the cobbled-on technology that improved Voyager by such orders of magnitude.  Culturally, there's no going back even if there isn't another war with the Borg in retaliation for Voyager's actions. No one's really going to think much of the Federation's self-assessment as well behaved, neutral elder statesman of the Alpha quadrant in the face of so much military activity from 2364-2378.   We already know that some cultures will, faced with Voyager's return, assume it to have been in the Delta quadrant on some sort of secret mission; establishing a foothold, alliances or trade of some kind. This will be hard to deny when Starfleet starts incorporating Borg technology into its forthcoming models and word of Seven of Nine gets around. Certain races are going to want a slice of that pie, and I don't know that Starfleet or the Federation are idealistic enough to save it after recent experiences. I suspect Starfleet is going to have to walk softly and carry a big stick for a while whether there's a war with the Borg or not, and once you've got a reputation for doing that it's hard to get rid of that reputation and replace it with one of peace-loving, harmless adventurousness.  That sort of attitude creates a feedback loop; people are drawn to Starfleet who experience Starfleet as youths. Brought up actively believing Starfleet a paramilitary organization will be a lure to a different class of person than the generation brought up genuinely believing Starfleet to be entirely non-military - but perhaps that's for the best, because Starfleet's claim to said has always been dubious at best.  So where are we in a hundred years? At best, we haven't had a war with the Borg or other Alpha quadrant powers, yet we've still got a far more militarized fleet - perhaps even an entirely different governmental branch to Starfleet, this one purely military. A military, even a post-scarcity military, needs something to do, so I can very much see the Federation, with the best of intentions, starting to bend the Prime Directive: helping here and there, meddling further and further each time over the course of several generations, until the Federation's military fleet is, de facto, (inter)galactic nannies at best... or 'peacekeepers' at worst.  We could be looking at the beginnings of a galactic hegemony, perhaps even a new Dominion, in the Alpha quadrant.  Perhaps that would be a good thing.  Oh, and I almost forgot. Of the Gamma quadrant...   I wonder what Odo's meld might do to the Great Link, in the long term. As we all know, the meme of freedom is a stubborn one, and even among the beneficiaries and maintainers of any deeply unequal caste structure there are those noble or at least honest enough to see the benefits to and morality of the Federation way - or at least, the Federation line - who will be powerfully curious to learn more, at the very least.  The Gamma quadrant isn't going anywhere, certainly, and nor is the Dominion, so it was hasty of me to fail to mention them previously. They're not a hasty bunch, though, so beyond a few exchanges of diplomats and if we're lucky cultural experts I don't expect to hear very much from them for a good few decades, perhaps longer. By the end of the century I discussed above though, I would bet good gold-pressed latinum that they'll join the Federation.  It's in their nature to merge as a cohesive group, after all, and they can't stay isolated forever. The unity the Federation offers will be powerfully attractive to their kind. The other major factions are too domineering even for them; the Founders control through respect, breeding and assumed wisdom while the Klingons and Romulans, in the end, control through brutality.  The reason I don't think they can't stay isolated forever is simple. Who else exists as one merged consciousness, but already has a controlling single mind? The Borg. The Borg will be powerfully attracted by the Founders' abilities when they learn of them, and while the Founders have a lot in common with the Borg - or at least its Queen - the Borg already has a controlling mind, and it doesn't share. So the Borg are going to come a-ssimilatin' and the Founders are going to come to us."

Did the major powers ever really believe this?   TL;DR: The Federation is a prime example of Teddy Roosevelt's ""Walk softly and carry a big stick"" maxim. Equally capable of using diplomacy or military action to suit its needs, and has done so ever since its founding.  The pre-Federation (Earth and allies) stopped Romulan aggression and set up the Romulan Neutral Zone before the Federation officially became a thing.   Going back to at least Kirk's era the Federation and the Klingons were eyeing each other up and briefly went to war before the Organians stepped in, before going into a Cold War scenario that lasted up until the Klingons went and blew up Praxis from over-mining, setting off a coup between the highest echelons of both the Klingon Empire and Starfleet to set off a war that was stopped only through the actions of the Enterprise-A and Excelsior.  When the Romulans came knocking again their fancy new ship with the experimental plasma weapon and cloaking device never came back, followed by a Starfleet operation into Romulan territory where they yanked a cloaking device right out under their noses.   While the Romulans would improve their cloak to render this operation somewhat useless, it shows the Federation pushing back against Romulan aggression and willing to throw its best captain, crew and starship under the proverbial space bus if things hadn't worked out. ""Oh he went insane. Sorry.""  When the Genesis Device was exposed the Klingons went on the diplomatic warpath, immediately believing the device to be a superweapon meant to tip the scales and not being a terraforming device in the slightest.  Heck, a group of Klingon battecruisers got atomized by that giant V'ger space cloud, and here goes Starfleet sending the Enterprise in and the thing just disappears, from the Klingon perspective, as if it was never there.  By the time of TNG in the 24th century the Federation was truly seen as ""well behaved, neutral elder statesman of the Alpha quadrant"" because they had walked up to any bully that stood up to them and punched them in the face, or by turning around and helping the Klingons out so Qo'nos didn't become an inhospitable wasteland for the one-two military/diplomatic punch the Federation is uniquely suited to dish out.  That isn't to say the Federation didn't get a bit complacent in victory, since it did, but then Q snapped his fingers and had the Borg punch the Federation in the face, and like a bear awakening from a long hibernation, they slowly started putting themselves back together.  Even when the Klingon Empire went on a massive military buildup (first attacking the Cardassians) and attacked an unprepared Federation, Starfleet again turned around and started punching the Klingons in the face, slowly pushing them back into Klingon space to the point where even the zealous Klingons saw they were slowly going to lose the war.   The Federation even infiltrated the Klingon military headquarters on Ty'gokor to reveal a Changeling, though they could have very easily assassinated the Chancellor and several of the Empire's finest captains if they were, you know, a lot more evil and/or pragmatic.  Combine all of the above events with the Dominion War and the Federation's standard policy for diplomatic and cultural expansion  and you have what appears to be, to foreign powers who seem to always think militarily and strategically 24/7, an expanding juggernaut that can really only be slowed down by something equal to or greater than it (Borg, Dominion, etc).  Great post btw. Didn't intend to type out all this much."

Collectively, their trust and respect can't be underestimated in intergalactic politics. Look how much trouble the Maquis alone caused when their trust in the Federation was snapped.  The moment the Federation starts arming for bear, it has to stop going around domineering other cultures the way it does - for example, by offering asylum. To cultures that don't share the concept, that might seem like an incredibly aggressive act, and an aggressive act enacted by a smooth talking, cultured expert politician like Picard, practically the Federation incarnate, in a flying hotel is a very different thing than one enacted by someone like, say, Janeway in charge of a warship.

I think another change we'd see is a design trend away from ""luxury liner"" cruisers like the Galaxy. Ships are going to be leaner, require less crew, and have more space devoted to armaments and defensive systems. Your exploration vessels are going to be the older models the Federation still has lying around after the war, your remnant Galaxies, Intrepids, Nebulas (Nebulae?), etc. The only new exploration vessels you'd see would be huge dreadnoughts like the Sovereign which also comes heavily armed.

Yes, they took severe losses alongside the Cardassians when the Obsidian Order and Tal Shiar tried to destroy the Changeling homeworld, but the Federation and Klingons seem to have taken harder hits than that throughout.   Even taking into account the destruction of Romulus (which I hesitate to do) they still have numerous other worlds, colonies, allies and territories. Because of this, I believe they would be one of the dominant forces following the war. Because of this....  2) Starfleet may take on more military roles. War tends to shake things up. Powers that might have allied themselves with the Dominion will suddenly find themselves without friends or military power. Think of the collapse of many Eastern Bloc countries following the end of the Soviet Union. Starfleet may continue with a military mentality for some time following the end of official hostilities and assume a peacekeeping role.    3) War tends to encourage new technologies. Between captured Dominon tech and newly developed Federation designs, I think a lot of older space frames will finally be mothballed or sold off as surplus (or however Starfleet gets rid of old equipment.) Miranda and Excelsior ships will probably be replaced by more modern designs, despite the reliability of the older spaceframes.    4) The Klingons took some of the hardest causalities on the allied side. You have the Klingon-Federation conflict, the Klingon-Cardassian War, and finally the war between the Klingons and the Dominion. The Empire's not going to be able to easily recover, and because of that the Federation's sphere of influence is going to take a hit.   Despite all this, I'd like to think Starfleet would return to a mission of science and exploration. WW2 gave way to the space race - it's not inconceivable to think the end of the Dominion War might ultimately lead to a similarly positive future for the Alpha Quadrant."
DaystromInstitute,3axvqc,LeicaM6guy,5,Wed Jun 24 15:37:02 2015 UTC,"I think the aftermath of the war will really test the integrity of the Federation as there is a lot of potential for internal strife.  We like to treat the Federation like a monolithic entity and we tend to forget that it's composed of at least 150 member planets, and who knows how many colonies, species, and cultures.  I doubt that there was unanimous agreement among all Federation members to declare war on the Dominion in the first place. How did those anti-war members feel about having to send troops and supplies to the war effort and having their very survival threatened? Heck, what about Federation members with divided opinions among their own people? How much internal political conflict would there have been within each Federation planet/colony? What will happen to those planets/colonies that did not believe the war was justified or worth the cost? Are they still willing to remain within the Federation?  There will also likely be a new balance of power within the Federation after the war. Planets that were more affected by the war may see their influence wane while planets less affected may see their influence grow. Earth will likely become even more powerful and prominent due to its central role in executing the war and all the industry mobilized for the war effort. Will everyone be happy with that change?  Then you have the reconstruction effort. We know that at least Benzar and Betazed were conquered by the Dominion. Earth itself was attacked, although the damage wasn't that bad. How many other worlds were conquered or devastated by the Dominion? It may take a massive effort to rebuild those worlds. But how much help will each Federation member agree to provide? The Federation may be founded on mutual cooperation but the amount of resources required to rebuild the devastated worlds may require a lot of sacrifices from everyone. That may push the anti-war worlds/colonies away even more since they already sacrificed a lot for something they didn't believe in and now they're being asked to sacrifice even more.  You also have the problem of what they're going to do with the Cardassians and the Breen. The official Federation policy will likely be to give all their territories back and help them rebuild. But is everyone going to be happy with that? So many sacrifices were made and so much blood was shed to win the war, are people just going to be fine with letting the Cardassians and Breen off the hook? How many Federation members would want to hold the Cardassian/Breen territories they took for their resources and force the Cardassians and Breen to pay reparations?  Not to mention all the problems they'll run into with the Klingons and Romulans. I doubt that they'd let go of the Cardassian/Breen territories they conquered and they certainly won't let the Cardassians/Breen off the hook that easily. And what about Federation planets/colonies that were liberated by the Klingons or Romulans? Would the Klingons and Romulans just leave those worlds or will they attempt to lay claim on them? Is the Federation willing to fight another war to prevent the Klingons and Romulans from abusing the Cardassians and Breen or to take back the Federation planets/colonies they took?"

Cardassians they would help since its just the civillians left. They might hold trials of remaining military leaders. The Breen I doubt they would be able to get reparations with out further war. The Breen didn't loose their whole fleet like the cardassians and jemhadar   Not to mention all the problems they'll run into with the Klingons and Romulans.

They have a staunch ally in Martok so the Klingons would negotiate. The Romulans probably didn't conquer that much territory but I could see some tensions and negotiations due to that scenario"
DaystromInstitute,3axvqc,warcrown,3,Fri Jun 26 05:00:47 2015 UTC,"This may be brief, as it's late and I'm on my phone, but:  TL:DR The Federation will focus on outreach, new members, expanding the protectorate program, and begin distinctly reevaluating the prime directive.   I'm of the opinion that the Dominion War and many of its substantive effects are a result of the Federation's inaction on a number of fronts due to the Prime Directive.   They didn't intervene on behalf of Bajor against Cardassia. They didn't intervene to the extent they could have with their Klingon allies when Gowron came to power. They didn't step in forcefully when Cardassia and the Dominion forged an alliance. Their pursuit of the Romulans was half-hearted and Sisko was all but forced to make a compromising hail-Mary play to get them into the war.  Now, take the case of Bajor. The Occupation was horrific. As a result, Bajor was not a useful ally during the war.  Imagine that, but swap Bajor for industrialized but pre-warp civilizations, and swap the Cardassia for the Dominion. I promise you it wasn't just Jem'hadar doing the work of the Dominion. You think the Founders have a Prime Directive?  I think that the Federation's commitment to the protection of life, liberty, etc. get bolstered by the horrors of the war. I think that, like the Marshall and Columbo plans following WW2, the Federation sets out on a massive reconstruction and outreach program. I think that diplomacy and outreach to those pre-warp civilizations affected begins. I see the Federation walking the walk after the war, because to do otherwise would be to let the Dominion destroy what the Federation stands for.  I get why people want the dark future, but I don't see it. The Federation is 150 worlds - billions upon billions of souls, born and raised in a pre-war era of (to steal a phrase) proto-post-scarcity idealism. Rebuilding of therapeutic and bittersweet, and I don't for a second see the people of the Federation forgetting their values as they reconstruct their monuments to them.   Besides, out of universe, the hopeful future is what Star Trek is about. Following the Dominion War, I am distinctly hopeful about the Federation's future."
DaystromInstitute,3axvqc,spillwaybrain,5,Thu Jun 25 04:41:33 2015 UTC,"Well, a lot of people are dead.  A lot of Starfleet officers are dead.  So, you're going to see a huge number of people promoted quicker than usual/before to make sure there is an adequate number of Commanding Officers, Chief Engineers, etc. Which means you're going to have a lot of less experienced officers take on higher levels of responsibilities. So, mistakes and decisions that would not have been made by more experienced officers are more likely to happen."
DaystromInstitute,3axvqc,CaptainJeff,2,Wed Jun 24 14:16:03 2015 UTC,Idk about that. There may be a manpower shortage but why would it be top heavy?

DaystromInstitute,3axvqc,brutallyhonestharvey,2,Fri Jun 26 18:28:55 2015 UTC,"Not cannon, but: Star Trek Online has a mission where the Dominion fleet that got ""lost"" in the wormhole (Sacrifice of Angels) comes through after all, just several decades late. They don't realize time has passed and attack, and it's up to the player to stop them.  It's only one mission, but I always thought it was a great idea. What would happen if the Dominion fleet (with Changeling commanders and Vorta lieutenants) came back, not knowing the war was long over? The Jem'Hadar alone would probably wreak havok, and would the Federation be prepared? One fleet may not make the difference, but what kind of damage would it do to an unsuspecting Federation (unsuspecting because it would come out of the blue). What of a now devastated Cardassia, ripe for the picking?"
DaystromInstitute,3axvqc,tobiasosor,2,Wed Jun 24 15:16:08 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's an arc containing several episodes part of the ""Cardassian Struggle"" storyline: ""Second Wave,"" ""Of Bajor,"" ""Operation Gamma,"" ""Facility 4028,"" and ""Boldly They Rode.""

DaystromInstitute,3axvqc,tobiasosor,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:53:06 2015 UTC,"What about the possibility of war crimes charges brought against the Federation? A ""rogue"" element in The Federation created a virus to wipe out an entire race of people. When Section 31 was exposed and a cure was found the Federation Council elected to not give the cure to the Founders thereby endorsing genocide.    Now the Federation can argue all they want that Section 31 has no official standing and were working alone. But in the end The Federation stood by and did nothing and chose to not cure the people that were set out to be exterminated. We know that high ranking Starfleet officers have worked with 31 in the past. They couldn't have come up with the virus on their own.    Would the fact that 31 is a ""rogue"" element in the Federation matter to the interstellar community?  What if a Cardassian faction had done the same thing to the population of Earth? Cardassia would be made to pay for what they did.  Shouldn't Earth?"
DaystromInstitute,3axvqc,Numlocks,0,Wed Jun 24 15:30:28 2015 UTC,"Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.  The combination of paranoia and dramatically increased military throw-weight means that the Federation is well on its way to becoming a despotic authoritarian government.  We see hints of this throughout the war as civil liberties arches all the way in the role of military and government is challenged.  The attempted coup/junta of the Lakota incident is just a probe.  You have corrupt admirals extending their power in all directions, and look at the Star Trek 9 for an example.  Neighboring political upheaval like we see in nemesis are perfect trigger points for converting civilian power to military ""in the name of safety"".  We didn't see it happen on screen, but I would be shocked if it didn't based on the entire run of Deep Space 9.  Here in the United States, we have demonstrated enthusiasm for trading freedom for the perception of safety. Can we assume human nature will really change so much in a few hundred years?  Sure, there are nonhumans but tell me with a straight face that earth doesn't set the political direction of that government...  The future of the Federation it is dark. I would like to see it on screen."
DaystromInstitute,3axvqc,Chairboy,4,Wed Jun 24 15:42:59 2015 UTC,"That seems like a rather wild extrapolation. Earth and the Federation have both seen existential threats before, and they have had power hungry admirals attempt to throw their weight around, but it takes more than a couple of nutcase higher-ups with far less actual power than you give them credit for to turn a voluntary alliance of 150 different planets into a military dictatorship. People like Picard and Sisko aren't going to stand by and allow that sort of thing to happen, and as we see in Paradise Lost, you don't need to be a paragon of virtue to figure out that an admiral ordering you to fire on other Federation ships might not be the good guy.    The future of the Federation it is dark. I would like to see it on screen.   I will never understand the urge some people have to see good things corrupted and destroyed. Star Trek is one of the only science fiction franchises out there to have an inherently optimistic outlook on humanity and our future, and I would rather keep it that way."

DaystromInstitute,3awu79,butterhoscotch,7,Wed Jun 24 03:32:01 2015 UTC,"I don't think we have near enough info on the economics of starships to make decisions here. Before deciding, I need to know the following about each class:   Cost (in time, human resources, materials, currency, and opportunity) for each unit as a whole and breakouts for each system. Repair and maintenance costs. Metrics on investment return. This is vague and would probably be measured differently for each class so we'd need a way to compare metrics. A role matrix so that we can determine not only how each class is intended to be used but how they end up being used in real life, off camera, where we've seen so little of them.   This is important work and the only way we could have a window into the ST universe to gather this information would be another series. I'm sure we can all agree here that this new series is necessary and non negotiable. Thank you."
DaystromInstitute,3awu79,chimney3,2,Wed Jun 24 06:12:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I think these are the right questions to be asking. I'd want to see all of this in a spreadsheet before I'd feel comfortable advocating rather than speculating!  That said, my feeling is that 90% of what Starfleet does can be done by any old starship. We know starships are somewhat modular and can be refit for very extended individual lifespans. It feels to me that ""cutting the fat"" would mean building fewer new, experimental classes and keeping the Mirandas and the Excelsiors around even longer.  Though perhaps there's lot of utility in experimenting with a variety of new ship designs in the field, seeing what designs and processes work best, and then mass producing a few of the most-winning class for decades on end.   This is important work and the only way we could how to gather this information would be another series.   We all agree!! : D"

DaystromInstitute,3awu79,Lacriphage,10,Wed Jun 24 16:33:17 2015 UTC,"I'm going to assume we're talking post-Dominion War era. If that's the case, let's get the easy one out the way first. All Miranda-class ships get mothballed immediately. They've far, far outlived their usefulness. We already have replacement classes in production with the Steamrunner-class and Sabre-class.  Moving on to the next obvious target, the Excelsior-class. This class is almost guaranteed to be completely mothballed, but tricking out a few ships with the latest tech probably wouldn't hurt for research purposes. From what little we saw of Lakota, it's worth a shot. Like the Miranda-class, we already have replacement classes in production with the Akira-class and Nebula-class.  If the oft-forgotten Oberth-class is still steaming around, that entire class would be mothballed as well. Plenty of replacements in large runabout-type vessels or small science ships like the Nova-class.  The Galaxy-class is an interesting case, as has been discussed in-depth before on this subreddit. It's still the largest ship Starfleet has, but its inflexible multi-role design limits its functionality. The fact is, Starfleet already has a superior multi-role vessel in the Nebula-class. It's modular design being far more suited for such duty. The biggest advantage the Galaxy-class has over most other designs is force projection, which it did well. Unfortunately, with the introduction of the Sovereign-class, we now have a class better suited for such missions. As such, I'd probably halt Galaxy-class production, if it hadn't already been done. I would not, however, mothball the remaining ships. They're far too much of investment to do so.  The Intrepid-class, too, seems a bit inflexible in its design. While I wouldn't halt production, I would probably decrease it. What seems to be a fast, interdiction-type vessel isn't all that useful during peacetime. It'd probably be limited to quick response type missions like responding to natural disasters and what not.  Other than that, nothing really comes to mind off the top of my head. One of Starfleet's assets is its large fleet of different classes, I think. The biggest gap for a lot of time was dedicated warships, which have since been filled by the Defiant-class, Prometheus-class, and arguably, the Sovereign-class."
DaystromInstitute,3awu79,Tannekr,11,Wed Jun 24 04:11:32 2015 UTC,"Regarding the Galaxy-class, several mid-level decks in the saucer section are expressly designated to be modular and reconfigurable while underway for various mission types. Additional medical bay space, cargo holds, personnel transport, science labs, and so on. I'm not saying that the Nebula may not have more flexibility, just that I think you give the Galaxy too little credit.  Same goes to the Intrepid-class. Voyager's seven years in the Delta Quadrant would seem to indicate to me that that ship is ridiculously survivable and could be used quite easily in a long-range exploratory role alongside designs like the Luna and Vesta."
DaystromInstitute,3awu79,Kant_Lavar,3,Wed Jun 24 04:48:51 2015 UTC,"In regards to your points about the Intrepid-class, you're right that it's shown to be incredibly hardy, which makes it great for operating alone. However, Intrepid-class ships are rather small, which, I think, severely limits their exploratory capabilities. I know Intrepid-class and Nova-class ships are usually described as long-range science vessels in non-canon, but it's not something I entirely agree with, given their size."
DaystromInstitute,3awu79,Tannekr,5,Wed Jun 24 04:54:26 2015 UTC,"Voyager is a tough little ship, and very maneuverable but it seems to be on the weak side of the ships we have seen on screen. Very little fire power relatively speaking, they are always out gunned.  With a refit however, remove a few science labs add a few torpedo launchers, ablative armor and another phaser array and you have a fast cruiser size ship that can run missions as the head of a task force featuring smaller ships, such as the defiant because it will be fast and tough enough to hang in the fight with them, big enough to serve as a command ship and with a combat refit able to dish out damage and covering fire."
DaystromInstitute,3awu79,Tannekr,3,Wed Jun 24 04:59:10 2015 UTC,"This sort of works in my theory of the Intrepid-class being a good interdiction vessel. It's proven to be capable of operating alone, it's extremely quick and fast, and its smaller size makes it easier to hide. These are all qualities you need in performing hit-and-run tactics on important targets behind enemy lines."
DaystromInstitute,3awu79,Intropy_,3,Wed Jun 24 05:03:09 2015 UTC,"I think its a cruiers, like the vorcha or the valdore perhaps but compared to those cruisers its probably the weakest of the bunch, given star fleets preference for creating science ships. However given its size and its inherent toughness despite not being designed for combat i think it could serve in that role with the proper modifications.   I envision it doing deep space recon and long range science mission, While the combat variant does long range patrols of deep borders and hit and run attacks on border outposts, flanked with two defiants and an akira it does sector patrols and serves as the command ship, with the intrepid captain having command over the smaller ships."
DaystromInstitute,3awu79,Tannekr,1 point,Wed Jun 24 05:10:04 2015 UTC,"That makes some sense, but I can't see how it would be superior in that role to a Defiant."
DaystromInstitute,3awu79,gogodoctor26,2,Wed Jun 24 08:06:25 2015 UTC,The Intrepid-class is much faster than the Defiant-class.
DaystromInstitute,3awu79,mistakenotmy,2,Wed Jun 24 18:07:34 2015 UTC,"the size of the galaxy alone should make it useful for refleif missions,transport missions or other missions which require lots of cargo space.  In the dominion war it served as a large combat support ship and I think with the right modifications it can shine in that capacity.   The intrepid could serve a few roles, long range science and scouting missions seem to be its forte, both of the combat and non-combat variety given its size.   In fleet battles it could fill in the role right below the galaxy class, serving as support for the larger ships with fast moving covering fire and support for the smaller ships in the same way. Its size and ability to operate alone without starbases also means it can serve as the command vessel of task forces consisting of smaller ships assigned to long range frontier missions.  I only have a few episodes to go on but it does seem that starfleet does sometimes send multiship task forces out, for patrols and combat. Its possible given what happened during the war that they will be more inclined to send out multiple ships and keep large garrison forces for rapid response in all of their territories. I dont know if their citizens would accept anything less given the breaches in their security, like losing betazed. Their people may well demand more ships, and more combat ships to protect them."
DaystromInstitute,3awu79,Tannekr,3,Wed Jun 24 05:00:36 2015 UTC,"Well we dont really know if prometheus class ever entered production, since it was a prototype, my gut says no though. The gimmicky vector assault mode would prove to be a problem when larger ships start blowing apart the attack shuttles hah.  That leaves the defiant and sovereign. You can make the case however that if you refit the intrepid, galaxy and akira class ships you could make a pretty handy battle fleet, complete with powerful battle ships, quick attack ships, independent mission capable ships, basically a modular combat taskforce . That force could serve in peace time possibly until further more specialized classes are developed and fielded.  The great thing about that too, is depending on refit most of those ships can serve other roles, intrepid, galaxy, sovereign and akira can anyway.  I would probably keep a few excelsiors around, they are large ships which are more rare it seems then smaller ones. I would probably mothball steam runners, at this point they seem to serve the same purpose as the akira and possibly even the intrepid.    I think one of starfleets faults is its failure to have a really well defined set of characteristics for ship classes. Even the us navy has ship class's and roles (cruisers, carriers, destroyers) that serve particular functions in the fleet (force projection, anti ship combat, independent missions, relief efforts)"
DaystromInstitute,3awu79,mistakenotmy,3,Wed Jun 24 04:56:07 2015 UTC,"I agree except with the Galaxy. To me, that is how a Fleet Starship should look. It's wide and confident, sleek and intelligent and just the right color of grey to be imposing but not foreboding. Along with the Ambassador class, I'd say those are two of the best looking, most intimidating classes of ships in all of science fiction."
DaystromInstitute,3awu79,williams_482,2,Wed Jun 24 08:31:06 2015 UTC,but its inflexible multi-role design limits its functionality   Sorry but what?  How does being designed to perform multiple roles make it less flexible?  I would think being made to do many different things makes it more flexible.    An admiral doesn't always get to choose what ship is available for a given mission.  The closest ship may have to take the job and it may not have time to stop at a starbase to swap out a mission pod.
DaystromInstitute,3awu79,SStuart,2,Wed Jun 24 05:10:16 2015 UTC,"What I'm trying to say is that the Galaxy-class mission parameters are open-ended. Starfleet wanted a class of ship that had the ability to do whatever was needed of it. The problem, however, was that the actual design of the Galaxy-class doesn't accomplish this goal particularly well. Their approach was just to make a really big ship and shove everything into it. As a result, the Galaxy-class suffers from really bad jack-of-all-trades syndrome. It can do anything, but it wasn't particularly great at any of it. If you want to adapt a Galaxy-class to a specific mission, it'd likely have to undergo a retrofit.  On the other hand, the Nebula-class (despite its quite small screen time) would seem to be better suited for this goal. If you assume that the upper hull module could be replaced for different mission parameters, suddenly you have a hull design that IS flexible. Sure, a Nebula-class fitted with a weapons platform wouldn't be suited for a exploration mission, but it's just as easy to make a Nebula-class with a gigantic sensor palette that would be suited for exploration. In addition, instead of creating an entire starship or retrofit an existing one to alleviate the changing mission parameters of Starfleet, you can just swap out the module on a Nebula-class. The Galaxy-class simply doesn't boast enough modular design to actually accomplish its mission parameters well."
DaystromInstitute,3awu79,JTK102,2,Wed Jun 24 06:37:30 2015 UTC,"I guess I just don't see being a multi-role vessel as a bad thing.  Being a jack-of-all trades isn't always bad. The class does everything very well.  Not the best, but also not badly.    It brings to my mind the saying ""The best is the enemy of the good, or good enough.""  How many times have we seen the Enterprise-D get out of situations because it was so adaptable?  Space is unpredictable.  Maybe I am crazy but I would take a well rounded generalist ship like the Galaxy when going into an unknown situation.     It can do anything, but it wasn't particularly great at any of it.   I honestly don't know how this idea became so prevalent.  Did we watch the same shows?"
DaystromInstitute,3awu79,Hilomh,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:15:24 2015 UTC,"The Galaxy class could do practically anything, and it was pretty good at all of it. It could have been better at any number of roles, but why bother subtracting from one aspect or another when it's already a match for most contemporary rival battleships, well equipped for studying the vast majority of interesting things it might come across, can move itself around quickly enough to carry out long range exploration or respond to threats within a reasonable radius, etc.   If the Federation didn't have what seems like a clear technological advantage that allows their multipurpose ships to match up with dedicated vessels of neighboring powers that would be a reasonable complaint, but they do. Why not take advantage?"
DaystromInstitute,3awu79,Tannekr,2,Wed Jun 24 18:34:04 2015 UTC,"Did you watch TNG? The impression we got was that the Enterprise was well suited for any mission, certainly more than any other ship int the fleet.   Time and time again, characters refer to the Enterprise as the best prepared ship to handle matters of diplomacy, warfare, exploration and investigation. This is also reinforced in DS9 when we consistently see Galaxy class ships leading fleets (Venture in ""Way of the Warrior"") and serving as the foundation of battle fleets (Dominion War)  I understand that some folks may not like the Galaxy aesthetic, but it is starfleet's largest ship (by far) and on-screen evidence shows that it can handle about anything."

When you need to transport a lieutenant to a new post on Risa because the old one fell off a cliff accidentally, you send a Miranda to do the job, not fancy expensive ship with better things to do.  There's a billion things that starships have to do.  On the show, we get to see the cool stuff, but there are plenty of captains who must do nothing but mundane crap.    Now, as far Miranda's serving on the front line in war, yeah, that seems a bit crazy..."
DaystromInstitute,3awu79,lyraseven,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:37:58 2015 UTC,"Starfleet isn't any random Federation citizen with an old starship. It's a professional military organization and maintaining a modern fleet is important. You don't know how tomorrow's politics are going to turn out and you need to be ready should war break out, or really, anything that gets thrown your way.  Because of Starfleet's complacency in the early 24th century, they were stuck with an ~85-year old design in a war against a tactically superior force. The crew of those ships would have been far more effective on a more modern class of ship, say, a Sabre-class."
DaystromInstitute,3awu79,williams_482,3,Sun Jul 5 17:47:49 2015 UTC,"Starfleet should be split into two different organizations focused on two separate missions. One should focus on exploration and science. The other should be focused on enforcing interstellar law, defending the Federation and allies, and search/rescue operations. Starfleet insists that its mission is purely peaceful, but other powers in the galaxy will doubt this claim until the Federation forms a military organization separate from Starfleet. I may sound like Admiral Marcus, but he did have a point."
DaystromInstitute,3awu79,lyraseven,3,Wed Jun 24 15:25:56 2015 UTC,Why should they be separate? Both organizations would need to have a fleet of fast ships with excellent sensors and the ability to defend themselves against potential attackers. It makes more sense to have a single fleet with two roles and a wide variety of ships than two separate fleets.
DaystromInstitute,3awu79,williams_482,6,Wed Jun 24 18:39:07 2015 UTC,"I would, in stages, remove the weapons and Starfleet computer databases from the entire existing fleet and sell it on to pleasure cruise providers (Sovereign, Galaxy and Nebula), researchers (Intrepid), collectors (i.e. Kivas Fajo types) and so on and so forth.  With the funds as a supplement (not that they're needed, but why waste?) I'd create an entirely new fleet, adapting the Borg (and other Delta quadrant) technology brought home by Admiral Janeway.  I see no reason to 'improve' upon the Borg equivalent of the Galaxy-class in terms of design; which is to say, a cube. It's a wonderfully efficient shape for what it does, which is transport a ton of people around. That isn't the Galaxy class's only job, but it's one of them, and the Cube fulfills it in spades, without sacrificing on space for its other roles. Imagine, the equivalent cost of something aesthetic but inefficient like the Enterprise-D spent on a nice, neat utilitarian cube.   You'd likely be able to afford (in terms of both space and cost) all sorts of redundant/backup/luxury systems, such as more holodecks, a hospital instead of a mere sick bay, on-site large-item replication factories (never run out of shuttles again!), the possibilities are endless. You could even have a floor (or several) that behaved pretty much like the civilian parts of DS9; shops, restaurants, bars, theatres/concert halls, a miniature city for the crew and families, guests and passengers.  You could have entire floors dedicated to specific roles and only powered when in use - a floor of suites for diplomatic visitors, as many floors of barracks or small quarters for evacuees, colonists, refugees as you could ever need plus extra that can be converted as needed for specialized transport - that of prisoners, endangered species, mass cargo, etc.   To say nothing of unlimited space for researchers of all flavors - even the most niche of scientists. I mean, it's not like the Federation can't afford to feed anyone who isn't working, so someone specializing in a specific type of extremely rare space phenomena can't hurt to have around, contributing where he can at other times but really good to have around the one time you really need him. Room to have all the equipment a science vessel could ever need just lying around too, though even if it didn't, it has those giant-item replicator factories, remember?  It's the modern philosophy of the aircraft carrier, in space, and post-scarcity.  So I've replaced larger, multi-purpose/transport vessels with cubes, but what of Starfleet's other roles?  I think the Intrepid class proved itself in Voyager; now imagine what it could do in the hands of a crew with more than three competent members. So I introduce a new class - Borg, Dominion, Klingon, you name it enhanced Intrepid class which someone creative can name. It still has to look 'pretty' (e.g. not a cube) because its job is to replace all other exploratory, point-of-contact vessels on the fringes of known space, and we don't want to intimidate anyone who's aware of the Borg.  It's fast, tough enough to explore with and plenty big enough for the purposes of exploring uncharted space; if it discovers something that bears prolonged or better equipped investigation it can flag the spot for a cube to get to and move on itself. It can cope on a skeleton crew and minimal external assistance, so we can cut down on people needed to make the ship fly and fill the rest of the 'crew' capacity with diplomats, linguists, anthropologists, those spies the Federation leaves in deep cover with civilizations about to reach warp capability, sociologists, and other, more typical space-y scientists.  As for warfare, once again I think we need to take a leaf from the Borg PADD. Not a tactical cube, but their version of the probe. It's a long rectangular prism: makes a smaller target when fleeing than a cube, can pull off more complicated maneuvers and has a more efficient layout for an offensive warship in my opinion.  It affords a nice long, thick horizontally mounted warp core (all the better to shield us with) and a nice long, relativistic kill vehicle cannon (that's a near-light rail gun to Pakleds) too - how many times have we encountered enemies who seem to just soak up energy-based weapons? Sometimes the old solutions are the best solutions.   Plus, the shape of the probe allows for crew to move around it far more effectively than a cube or traditional Starfleet design, if needed - with only a few floors there's no need for turbolifts or Jefferies tubes, nor even wall partitions for the most part - soundproofed sleeping barracks should be about it; this is a warship, not a flying hotel like Starfleet used to build. So we get around by ladders if lots of us need to be moving at once, or those little lifts we generally used to use only in Engineering otherwise.  We don't even need a centralized bridge, though there should be one for the time spent traveling to and from engagements. Other than that, I'm envisaging wall-to-wall tactical and ops stations on the top floor along both sides.   A large open-plan Engineering on the middle floor, along with that absurdly long, thick warp core we mentioned earlier, the rail cannon and its cooling systems in the middle, with torpedo bays and shield emitters along the sides, the better to effect repairs.   The final and bottom floor is communal sleeping space, mess hall, kitchen, sick bay, transporter room (for boarding parties, as well as the obvious usual stuff) and two small holodecks: one simulates a gym to keep crew fit, the other is on personal-use rations to keep crew sane. Keep in mind how small a holodeck can be while still appearing as spacious as the user/s please.  We can churn out as many of these as needed in a matter of weeks since there's nothing extraneous going on inside - no labyrinth of corridors, few dividing walls, no Jefferies tubes or turbolifts or private quarters (not even for the commander, who may not be a captain proper anyway - we'd have so many of these things built in a week when needed we'd have more of them available than first officers ready for a promotion).  Finally, while this is less of a ship-class thing and more of a shift in the organizational paradigm Starfleet prefers, in our warships we're going to adapt a little Borg command structure, too. The computer is going to take a greater role in allocating assets for maximum efficiency, allowing for a much flatter command structure and that many more bunks freed up from those who merely organize others in favor of more individuals able to concentrate solely on their task.  Each floor's commander issues commands to the computer which relays them to the appropriate group via comm badge, allocating each as efficiency and availability dictates, drawing from those finished their previous task or summoning off-shift engineering staff to relieve the tired and replace the injured. The computer can already fulfill most commands vocally and this is used to great effect (see any episode Seven of Nine or Data goes rogue and uses computer commands to establish force fields, site-to-sites, etc on an ad hoc basis), now imagine it allocating human resources when it can't fulfill a command itself. For example, the commander tells the computer to prioritize repairs on the weakest shield emitters, so the computer directs Shield Maintenance Team Delta, who just finished work elsewhere, to starboard level two third emitter, and so on.  So, Starfleet now consists of three classes of vessel:    Troop carrier/hospital ship/colony vessel/cargo ship/scientific communities on cubes,  First contact and diplomatic exploration vessels with light or quick-response science duties on the Intrepid class's successor,  Skeleton crewed, wall-to-wall phaser (and other energy weapons we've discovered along the way, just in case) banked, torpedo bristling war machine rectangular prisms pointing rail cannons."
DaystromInstitute,3awu79,lyraseven,4,Wed Jun 24 05:28:25 2015 UTC,"What could selling a couple hundred (thousand?) starships get them that would speed up the production of newer ships? All they need are engineers to design them and replicators, energy, stock matter, and time to put them together. Of those, only time could be argued to be in short supply, and you can't trade a starship to get more.  Dumping the existing fleet seems like a needlessly risky thing to do. You have fleets of ships good enough to hold their own against anyone else in the quadrant, you may as well hang on to them until you finish your ""we-are-not-the-borg-we-just-have-similar-ships-and-want-basically-the-same-thing"" Giant Death Cubes."

Un-replicatable components or components of those components, such as bio-neural gel packs.

Dumping the existing fleet seems like a needlessly risky thing to do. You have fleets of ships good enough to hold their own against anyone else in the quadrant, you may as well hang on to them until you finish your ""we-are-not-the-borg-we-just-have-similar-ships-and-want-basically-the-same-thing"" Giant Death Cubes.   Of course you keep the existing ships until you're ready to replace them; or rather we sell it off in small increments, as and when each vessel is replaced. After that, in a vacuum, sure, you could always find some use for old ships, even if it's as a fire ship IN SPACE. But the idea is that with the massive influx of obscenely advanced fully-fledged technological applications, and the theory behind it, the new fleet will obsolete the old by such orders of magnitude that keeping the old one around would just be pure sentiment, and we'd be better off taking some currency with which to procure any of the aforementioned goods or services.  Remember that USS Voyager alone was fighting in the biggest leagues there are - holding out against Borg cubes, even if the outcome would be a loss in the end. Now imagine a fleet of ships built from the ground up with the cutting edge in Federation as well as stolen Borg, Klingon, Romulan and miscellaneous advanced Alpha quadrant peoples, plus a couple of decades of future Federation tech and improvement upon said stolen tech.  I'm talking about leapfrogging the next few generations of each role's ship classes here - again, you saw what Voyager could do with seven years of ad hoc upgrades duct taped onto the hull. We're talking imitation Borg cubes here, maybe not quite as strong as the real thing, but that's because they're merely the people carrier of the new fleet. The hospital ships, cargo transports, pack mules. The exploration vessels are upgraded Intrepid-sized ships packing the punch of a Defiant plus all the other tech we've cribbed here and there, and they're not even the fighting force. For that we've got my proposed quick-response flatpack battleships ready to hemorrhage out from our shipyards, packed with more firepower than a Borg cube and covered in ablative armor that Borg weaponry barely smudges.  The alternate Admiral Janeway didn't bring back everything from her timeline [as far as we know] but what she did bring us, together with the other technology we've magpied over the years Voyager was gone, is plenty. It's a level of power that will make anyone but the Borg think twice about taking us on alone - they'd have to be willing to accept, and adapt to, a level of asymmetric warfare they haven't known in generations.  We can afford to sell our castoffs as show pieces or pleasure yachts."

DaystromInstitute,3awu79,MexicanSpaceProgram,2,Fri Jun 26 10:24:14 2015 UTC,"Well first off I think we'd need to define what major roles are needed in Starfleet. I think the same Science, Engineering, and Security careers we see in personnel should also carry over to ships well. Also keep in mind my spaceship background includes a lot of Eve Online and a bit of STO. So if some of these ships sound too specialised, that's why.  So let's start with Science. Their major roles would be exploration and research.    Short term/rapid research and exploration vessel: the existing Nova class. Ancillary materials say it was already planned to be Starfleet's new explorer after the Galaxy class. It's missions would be more ""first encounter"" and makes recommendations for future missions with more advanced ships to continue. A jack of all trades/master of none vessel. Advanced exploration vessel: the existing Intrepid class. It's already designated as a long term exploration vessel anyway, and Voyager showed that. Focused more on long term autonomous operation. Advanced research vessel: the new Manhattan class. Intended to be a mobile laboratory, after the previous two classes make their initial findings, this ship comes in with dedicated and specialized crew and equipment to further conduct research.    Next is Engineering. Their major roles would be upkeep (construction and repairs), and mass medical.    Rapid relief vessel: the new Minutemen class, inspired design by an early concept for the Defiant class. It would feature a modular/swappable bay that can be configured for medical relief, construction, or supply movement. These would most commonly be seen as the Federation hauler as well. In case of disaster these ships are the first on the scene to provide humanitarian aid. Advanced relief vessel: The existing Olympic Class. It's already a hospital ship with plenty of internal space. Throw in a few of the modular bays from the Minutemen class to round it out. Heck make it so the two ships can swap their modular bays without external support.   On the modular bays, think of a cargo container that can slide in and out of the ship. They can either come pre-specialised for certain mission types (construction, extra cargo space, mini hospital), or be a more jack of all trades/bit of everything equipped. The Minutemen class comes with one such bay, the new Olympic class would come with at least one of each type.  Finally Security, or lesser known as military. These ships help keep the peace in the Federation.   Rapid Escort: The existing Defiant Class. I think we're all familiar with this one. These ships are commonly seen on patrol all throughout the Federation. Advanced Escort: The existing Galaxy class, transitioning to the existing Sovereign class. These are the ships of the line of Starfleet, analogous to the aircraft carriers of today politically. Park one in orbit of a planet and the neighbors know not to try to pull anything. Also used to move VIPs and other important cargo, and the primary ship type for the Diplomatic corps. They are also on a perpetual patrol of Federation space, but more commonly between more developed worlds and along borders, but not so close to borders that they trigger the other empires' ""I don't like the military presence you have along our border"" flag. Rapid Assault: the existing Prometheus class. Mostly still around because I'm a sucker for the MVAM. This is the fastest way to bring a large amount of firepower to a situation. Advanced Assault: The new Tetsuo class, successor to the Akira class. Equipped with higher power phasers than the rest of the fleet, along with a fighter bay of Delta Flyer II type fighters. If the Advanced Escort's jobs is preventative, the Heavy Assault's job is reactive.    Other random notes:   All pre-existing ships get shoehorned into either the Advanced Escort or Short term exploration and research roles until either the manpower to keep them flying isn't there or the hull or other major non-replaceable components give out in which case they are salvaged.   Any of the ship roles with rapid in their name is that, their job is to be the first on the scene in their roles. Roles with advanced in their name hang back until after the situation is assessed. As a result the ships of the rapid role outnumber the ships of the advanced role.   And also following in ""Starfleet is not a military organization,"" the assault roles are the fewest in number and hang back on more developed or strategic positions.   The rapid roles are small ships (crew of 50-80) by intention. They can be quickly crewed and built, and have a secondary role of being training ships for the academy. Part of graduating from the Academy's Officer Training School would be to complete a tour of duty or two on a rapid role ship."
DaystromInstitute,3awu79,ctour95,2,Wed Jun 24 15:36:03 2015 UTC,"Just one point of contention. The Galaxy Class and Sovereign Class more closely resemble Command Cruisers/Attack Cruisers, rather than escorts.   They're generally organizing operations and movements in fleet settings. Generally Flag officers have a leading ship of the line based off of ""Enterprise"" Hulls.   Your heavy escort/assault vessel is more or less the Akira Class."

I'm reminded of a post called ""Meet the Staff"" made in r/wtf made a year ago, which will appear in a reddit search.  It's a page from a local business where the entire staff is composed of dozens of young women, with five or so male senior managers. The men in charge, pictured at the bottom, certainly have peculiar hiring habits. Also, more pertinent to the plot of ""Bound,"" a few women, not all women, but some, will like the Orion temptresses use their feminine wiles to manipulate men in the workplace, which is an insult to the professional women (and men) who count on the quality of their work to get ahead. This happens every day. For better or worse, in these circumstances it's up to men to recognize what's going on and reel it in, should they find themselves in a position of power and making these mistakes.

I can think of quite a few TNG episodes where parts of the crew (or even just individuals) where controlled by some alien powers, where they couldn't have done anything against it and it wasn't their fault. While it might be reasonable to argue that most of the time there should've been some more character developement  as a result from this, the rest of the crew never held it against them in the long run. The only example of that, that I can think of is Siscos dislike for Picard, which is completely understandable."

DaystromInstitute,3avkdr,elementsofevan,10,Wed Jun 24 21:41:46 2015 UTC,Roddenberry agreed with you near the end of his life and even pledged to have a gay character but died before making it happen.
DaystromInstitute,3avkdr,zuludown888,13,Tue Jun 23 21:47:55 2015 UTC,"In actual fact, he said TNG was going to have gay characters in 1986 at a fan convention before the show started shooting, according to David Gerrold at least. Never happened.  Roddenberry could have made it happen, of course. He still had creative control over TNG for several years after that. We all know that Berman and others were opposed to the whole idea, and as (I believe) Ron D. Moore has said any opposition didn't come from execs at Paramount."
DaystromInstitute,3avkdr,elementsofevan,8,Tue Jun 23 23:59:01 2015 UTC,"Wikipedia has a source that says he was going to make it happen in the fifth season of TNG.   According to The Advocate, Roddenberry promised that in the then-upcoming fifth season of TNG, gay crew members would appear on the show. Other stars of the franchise chimed in, with Leonard Nimoy (who played Spock) offering his support in a 1991 letter to the Los Angeles Times saying, ""It is entirely fitting that gays and lesbians will appear unobtrusively aboard the Enterprise—neither objects of pity nor melodramatic attention.""[16]  However, Roddenberry died soon after his interviews and the announced plans to have a gay crew member on TNG never materialized. Control of the Star Trek franchise fell to Rick Berman.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexuality_in_Star_Trek"
DaystromInstitute,3avkdr,zuludown888,12,Wed Jun 24 00:05:35 2015 UTC,"Here's the interview with Gerrold:   Another reason why you left TNG had to do with “Blood and Fire,” a script that went unproduced and caused a firestorm internally and for you personally. You happen to be a gay man, you wrote a script that pushed Trek across a boundary it had never broached: introducing gay characters into the landscape, and it ultimately got shot down despite the initial public support of Gene Roddenberry…  Gerrold: The long story with “Blood and Fire” is that a month after Next Gen was announced Gene and I were at a convention in Boston. We’d both been invited before anyone knew there was going to be a new Trek series, so there was a lot of excitement at the convention because this would be the first time Gene would speak in public about the new series. There were 3,000 people in the room waiting to hear the news. They had a lot of questions. But there wasn't really anything to say yet. We were still getting moved into offices and had not really made any serious decisions about what the new show would be. So it was mostly just promises that we were going to do our best to catch lightning in a bottle again.   One fan asked, “Well, are you going to have gay crewmembers, because in the 60’s you had Black and Asian and Latino, etc.?” Gene said, “You know, you’re right. It’s time. We should.” I was sitting on the side, taking notes, of course. So there it was: Gene had said it in front of an audience of 3,000 people in November of 1986. I was a little bit surprised and delighted that Gene was willing to go there. We got back to L.A. and Gene said it again in a meeting, and somebody in that meeting – I won’t say who – said, “What, we’re going to have Lt. Tutti-Frutti?” Gene balled him out and said, “No, it’s time. And I promised the fans we’re going to have gay characters.”  Then, Rick Berman, who was not yet aboard the show but was still a studio exec, passed us a memo saying, “Here are some of the stories I think you can do.” It was a three-page memo listing, I guess, about 50 ideas, and the third one was an AIDS story. And I thought, “Well, I’ve got this from Gene and Rick, so the studio has no problem.” Now, my cause at the time was blood donorship, and I knew that people were so terrified of AIDS they had even stopped donating blood. So I wanted “Blood and Fire” to be about the fear of AIDS -- not the disease but the fear -- and one of the plot points involved having the crew donate blood to save the lives of the away team. I thought, “If we do this episode right, where blood donorship is part of solving the problem, we can put a card at the end telling viewers that they could donate blood to save lives, too.” I thought it was something Trek should be doing, raising social awareness on an issue, and if we did it right, we could probably generate a million new blood donors at a time when there was a critical shortage."
DaystromInstitute,3avkdr,BewareTheSphere,5,Wed Jun 24 00:14:25 2015 UTC,Roddenberry was well out of control of TNG by Season 5-- I'd take that promise with a big grain of salt.
DaystromInstitute,3avkdr,lemurr,10,Wed Jun 24 00:36:22 2015 UTC,"Perhaps the easy explanation for this kind of situation is that the orion girls' pheromones affect males because they're males. Doesn't have to do with their individual sexuality preference, but because they're male and inherently different than females. Even if they were gay, their male nature is affected. That's why the orion girls can affect males across different species.   Disclaimer: I do not know about the orion species' hormone physiology, haven't looked into it. Don't even know if their physiology is explained online or on any book."
DaystromInstitute,3avkdr,zuludown888,4,Wed Jun 24 04:04:30 2015 UTC,"It would be fitting with Star Trek's usual ethos of ""strength in diversity"" and such ;)  Trek has never handled gender and sexuality in the (comparatively) enlightened way it has race and culture (I mean, some of Kirk's lines in TOS are shockingly sexist). There are probably a lot of reasons for that, but I think the biggest for why it hasn't ever tackled sexuality in quite the same way is that, ever since Star Trek went off the air and became a hit in syndication, it has been an enormous cash cow for Paramount. Even if Paramount executives never stepped in during the 80s or 90s or 2000s and said ""don't do a story about gay people, don't have a gay crewmember, don't address LGBT issues in anything but the most oblique way possible,"" there was an incentive for the people in charge of Star Trek to not rock the boat too hard and to play it safe (I'd say that's the defining feature of Voyager, for instance).  And, up until relatively recently, Star Trek had a lot more to lose, financially, than to gain by embracing LGBT people. It's a shame, and I think it's an offshoot of the same problems that created several television series and movies with rapidly declining quality as the second generation of Star Trek went on, but it is what it is."

I mean having more of a multicultural, multisexual (please let that be a word) presence aboard a starship. In Bound for instance, it seems that the ENTIRE male population of Enterprise is at a very basic level attracted to these women. The (supposedly) straight female officers aboard have no feelings whatsoever towards these women. Therefore, it's safe to assume that me ( a gay man) would have no attraction towards these Orion slave girls either."

That being said I think 'Bound' is probably a bad example. The pheromones the Orion slave girls secrete accelerate the crew's metabolism, causing aggression and delusional behaviour among men and headaches and discomfort among women. It's likely these effects were independent of sexual orientation - it just means the aggressive behaviour may have been more generic among the non-heterosexual biologically male crew members rather than directed specifically towards fighting for the Orion's affection.   This is just speculation of course."
DaystromInstitute,3avkdr,iansarmy1,0,Tue Jun 23 21:36:42 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Any unseen gay crewmembers may have gone a bit mad just without the sexual attraction element. Biologically we're obviously much closer to straight men than we are to women and it's obviously doing something physiological.
DaystromInstitute,3avkdr,feor1300,3,Wed Jun 24 08:22:53 2015 UTC,"I'm all for having gay people be part of future Trek - diversity is an important part of the show.   But in the episode ""Raijiin"" from Enterprise not only the men were attracted and seduced by her, but also women. Otherwise straight women - so sexual preference has no effect on your ability to be subdued or not in that case.   Likewise with something like Orion women - thats a physiological side effect of their bodies pheremones - not just a visual stimuli. Gay or not - your brain still has the receptors for that junk, those women are basically living heroin, just be near them and you're hooked.   So in respect to ""a gay guy will have saved the day!"" I really don't think thats the case with the examples of seduction seen in Trek as all the examples seem to affect your brain's chemistry."
DaystromInstitute,3avkdr,doubleUsee,5,Wed Jun 24 10:47:32 2015 UTC,"It's a dumb episode and an example of how later Berman era Trek tried to ""sex things up"", but it always came off like a 12 year old boy wrote the script after finding a Playboy under his parent's bed. The idea was that the Orion women produced a chemical that effected men and women of any sexuality. But, the episode focuses on all of the male crew being silly heterosexual caricatures led by their genitals and the Orions come off as typical fem fatales. So I think you're left with a situation where a gay male wouldn't have solved anything according to the internal logic of the plot, and trying to inject some sort of message about homosexuals into an already jumbled mess of an episode would have failed completely."
DaystromInstitute,3avkdr,williams_482,10,Wed Jun 24 13:00:51 2015 UTC,"It's depicted in Trek that only heterosexuals exist essentially.   According to what? Jadzia is shown happily kissing another female, so she clearly has no purely heterosexual hangups, we won't even get into the mirror Kira/Ezri thing. And we see hundred and hundreds of individuals in the background who we never see any indication of their sexual preference. To assume that all of them are straight just because we don't specifically get told otherwise is silly."
DaystromInstitute,3avkdr,doubleUsee,24,Tue Jun 23 21:43:37 2015 UTC,"Almost every main character throughout all the series and movies end up in some sort of heterosexual romantical/sexual relationship, or at least a situation at some point. There's been starshiploads of captains, Officers, doctors and such - statistically at least a few of them should've ended up expressing some kind of anomaly as for his or her sexual orientation / gender orientation. That's quite lacking, which is kinda the point. OP's example isn't that great, I agree, but I would've loved to know of a few crew members to be gay. As for now, none of them are known - except for you name Jadzia  - for this. There may be non-heterosexual crewmembers, but throughout the series we constantly never get to see this, even though heterosexual relationship are, in some series and episodes more than others, displayed in detail."
DaystromInstitute,3avkdr,enterprisecaptain,7,Tue Jun 23 23:07:12 2015 UTC,"Although we don't have many examples of homosexual characters in Star Trek, that is very weak evidence that they don't exist.   Out of universe we know that the lack of obvious LGBT characters was intentional for a handful of unfortunate reasons, but in universe the odds of ~35 ""single lifetime"" humanoids (leaving out Dax, whose many lifetimes probably transcend sexual orientation as we know it; Odo, who is non-humanoid, sexless, and mostly asexual; and both Data and the Doctor, who can probably change their sexual orientation with a couple lines of code if they are so inclined) all appearing to be straight isn't exactly out of the question. Additionally, a good chunk of that 35 could be bisexual but were never shown as such on screen, and there is simply no way to tell if any of them are or are not transgender.  There have also been a handful of subtle references to homosexual relationships being rather unremarkable throughout the series. My favorite is in Rules of Acquisition, when Quark isn't particularly concerned that his ""male"" business partner Pel tried to kiss him, but literally faints when he learns that she is actually a woman."

That's what I loved about BSG and the depiction of Gaeta's sexual orientation. It was never a plot point, nor was it something that was seriously focused on in the show. We literally just see him intimate with Mr. Hoshi in one scene, then back to it all without really touching on it again. Gaeta was just Gaeta, and his sexual orientation doesn't matter. I always felt that homosexuality in Star Trek would, and should be depicted in the same way, since that is how it should be in the real world.  From Wikipedia about Gaeta's sexual orientation:   Gaeta is bisexual. In an interview with AfterElton.com, Jane Espenson states that Gaeta is completely ""out"" to his crew but that they would not have that concept as it is not an issue in their world. She defines him as ""someone entirely free of labels, who has probably had a number of relationships, mostly with males."""
DaystromInstitute,3avkdr,doubleUsee,3,Wed Jun 24 10:09:37 2015 UTC,"That's what I loved about BSG and the depiction of Gaeta's sexual orientation.   For those of us who watched only the television episodes, Gaeta's sexual orientation was not depicted at all. When you mentioned this, I had to do some research to track down this one scene in which Gaeta was intimate with Mr Hoshi, because I didn't remember seeing a scene like this. Turns out it was only in a webisode.   On the other hand:   We had 4 seasons of ""will they, won't they"" between Bill Adama and Laura Roslin. We saw the on again, off again relationship between Lee Adama and Kara Thrace.  We saw Lee Adama marry Dualla.  We saw Gaius Baltar have sex with Six repeatedly, as well as running an all-female sex cult for a season. We saw the Tighs' marriage: for worse and worse. We saw Galen Tyrell marry Callie.    And, amongst this riot of heterosexuality, we get one scene of a homosexual relationship - which wasn't even shown on television. Star Trek already depicted homosexuality in that way: never on television (there are a few homosexual relationships mentioned in the post-television continuity novels). So there's no change required in Star Trek to meet Battlestar Galactica's standards."

They might both be in women's bodies now, but they're attracted to what was, not what is.  A more damning trill episode is the one where they're first introduced and Beverly Crusher shuns a trill symbiont that she is ""in love with"" when the male host dies, and the new one is a woman. She gives an impassioned plea about her personal heterosexuality being immutable:   ""Perhaps it is a human failing, but we are not accustomed to these kinds of changes. I can't keep up. How long will you have this host? What would the next one be? I can't live with that kind of uncertainty. Perhaps, someday, our ability to love won't be so limited.""   Trek is super weak on LGBT representation. Evil lesbians count negative as far as representation is concerned."
DaystromInstitute,3avkdr,lyraseven,10,Wed Jun 24 02:04:00 2015 UTC,"That wasn't Crusher objecting to the new host's gender - in fact, I was astonished that she didn't. Instead she objected to the constant switching of host bodies. In the short time she'd known the symbiote, it'd had three bodies - and, in fairness, the person you love constantly jumping bodies is an issue that goes beyond sexuality and starts being more about the person's adaptability to change, which Dr Beverly 'let's just see if Worf really kills himself before we try a risky new treatment' Crusher has a very low stat in.   Plus, even a pansexual might pause to wonder just how much of the person they love survives the jump across bodies in a newly-discovered symbiotic species."
DaystromInstitute,3avkdr,molasses,2,Wed Jun 24 02:31:30 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but I remember when that episode came out what a letdown it was (as a bisexual woman) that Crusher just shut down as soon as the body of her dear love was female. I mean come on, she managed to fall for the Riker body (ew)."
DaystromInstitute,3avkdr,lyraseven,3,Wed Jun 24 07:17:35 2015 UTC,"Right, but when she fell for symbiote-in-Riker, that was a kind of new she could deal with, and even then just barely. It must have helped that she would subconsciously have felt at ease around Riker, even Riker's body controlled by a symbiote. So when the symbiote switches bodies again, that's an upheaval, and when it's to such a drastically different body than the last two, that just brought home what it meant to be in love with a body-hopping symbiote and she couldn't do that.  I honestly think the new host's sex wasn't even remotely the issue, and that that was a deliberate choice by the writers - it would've been easier to make it about sex if that was the issue than to avoid, but they instead made it more complicated than that.  Of course, Crusher's non-verbal reactions to the new host could be interpreted at disappointment that it's a woman, but I personally think she had made up her mind before she saw the new body or knew what sex it was, and that seeing how different the symbiote could become overnight just confirmed that she didn't want the complication."
DaystromInstitute,3avkdr,molasses,2,Wed Jun 24 07:27:45 2015 UTC,I would agree with you if they had ever had even a single gay or bisexual character on TNG.
DaystromInstitute,3avkdr,lyraseven,2,Wed Jun 24 22:22:34 2015 UTC,"When have they ever needed to explicitly pin down a character's sexuality that way, though? Even the characters with many heterosexual relationships could be bisexual for all we know.  Personally, I think it's rather ignorant and distasteful to insist that if a character is gay, bisexual or pansexual we have a right to explicitly know.   What we've got instead is a ship full of people many if not all of whom are not explicitly averse to having relationships with their own gender, and most of whom are explicitly open to relationships with aliens whose genitalia we can only guess at.  Why would anyone need to be pointed out as 100% gay, in or out of universe? When would this be pointed out without it coming across as awkward and tokenist?"
DaystromInstitute,3avkdr,molasses,2,Thu Jun 25 12:33:55 2015 UTC,"I am guessing you must be straight. Bear with me, it's relevant, and it's not a criticism, just an observation. You say it is ignorant and distasteful for me to insist that they make a character's sexual orientation explicit... if that orientation is something other than straight. Now I have to ask: did you find it distasteful when two characters of the opposite gender hooked up? Or when, in the TNG episode with the genderless race, where Riker fell in love with one who identified as female, his sexual orientation (straight) was made explicit?  Straight people see their own sexual orientation reflected everywhere in modern culture. It can give them a sense of belonging that runs very deep, and yet... they don't even know they have it, most of the time. Those of us who are different are made very aware of our difference on a daily basis. When TNG was new, I was in my 20's. I was still searching for acceptance (in many ways), there was no Google, Will & Grace didn't exist yet, LGBT was still LGB and the B had just been added, there was no Craigslist, there was no OK Cupid, there was no way to meet or even know of anyone like me (even though I was living in a failrly large city) unless I went to the one (ONE) lesbian bar that existed and hung out there by myself (how uncomfortable! and probably unproductive, as ""lesbian bar"" did not equal ""haven for bisexual women""). Or there was the personal ads in the back of the local free paper (too frightening for me at the time). Or there was a phone number date line thing you could call to leave messages and listen to messages (like personal ads, but with a voice). I only had the guts to call it once and listen to a couple ads. I longed to see that part of myself (my sexual orientation) reflected somewhere in society, even once... It's really quite lonely being bi. Particularly back then.  So the short answer to ""why would anyone need to be called out as gay"" is very similar to why they needed to be called out as bi. There just wasn't enough (i.e. any) representation in pop culture at that time. It's exclusionary and hurtful. This exclusion goes mostly unrecognized by the dominant culture, because they see themselves reflected everywhere, and feel accepted."
DaystromInstitute,3avkdr,lyraseven,4,Thu Jun 25 15:33:15 2015 UTC,"You say it is ignorant and distasteful for me to insist that they make a character's sexual orientation explicit... if that orientation is something other than straight.   Talk to me, not your straw man.  What I said was that needlessly, arbitrarily designating a character gay and letting us know it would be distasteful. If a gay character is revealed as gay because he encounters someone with whom he wishes to pursue a relationship and there's an episode about that, that's one thing. Otherwise, you end up with this:    Greg: Why are we always holding hands?  Terry: How else would people know we're gay?  Greg: Oh. Yeah, you're right.   Of course, Riker pretty much did come out as at a minimum bisexual in that episode with the agendered race, didn't it? That was a good way to 'out' a character without making it about tokenism. There was a point to his being outed, just like there's generally a point when any character in Star Trek falls in love - no one does it just to establish their orientation.  Also, I'm going to say something quite blunt now. You are free to skip it if you're unwilling to have a forthright conversation in which we all speak our minds. Past this 'trigger' warning, if you like, here be dragons:  I don't care about your orientation. I don't care about your experiences, either. All I care about is that television isn't outright, maliciously hateful toward any minority, unless for the purposes of humor. That you feel sad when you don't see enough other gay men on television is not a reason to put more gay men on television, it's a reason for you to seek help, because from my perspective, you are discriminating in reverse. You're upset with the reality of the situation, which is to say that most people aren't LGBT, and have internalized the kind of 'othering' you seek to reverse on television.  The solution isn't to demand to be depicted universally, which just - rightly - antagonizes people, the solution is to let society heal from its wounds at its own speed. What that means is letting cultural issues work themselves out, and what that means is not meddling with writers and establishing quotas. Great subversive, culturally relevant fiction doesn't come from forcing writers to make their characters gay, it comes from (1) telling them not to, or (2) them realizing that barely anyone else has yet.  So when people like me talk of not wanting LGBT characters 'in their faces all the time' they're not saying 'we don't want to see or hear about gay people', they're saying 'we don't want to see or hear about gay people unless it is germane to the story'. Most of those people don't want to see or hear about anyone's sexuality unless it is germane to the story, straight or not.  Also, regarding the straw man thing - don't assume. It makes an ass of you. I may be straight, I may not. I've disclosed elsewhere that I would be considered to have a minority status, but I'm not willing to out which on reddit."

It's still somewhat of an exclusionary bias on Crusher's part, and could well be considered discriminatory - in fact, now that I think on it, I think that she engaged in what could well be a future equivalent of sexism, by treating the symbiote as a different person even though by that point, it seemed like Trill were completely in control of the host body and free from its mental/emotional influences.   Still though, even then I think it was less that the third host was female and more that it was the third time she'd been faced with adapting to a new and unusual situation with this one person."
DaystromInstitute,3avkdr,Flying_Cunnilingus,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:04:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree. It's also hard to tell where the writers were going, because it seemed that Trill in TNG Had control to come extent and there was a sort of separation, but in DS9 we know there's a complete melding of not just the host and symbionts, but host and other personalities. For instance, Jadzia picks up a lot of traits of the other hosts. She also seems far more sexually fluid, casually mentioning that she's been a mother and father multiple times."

Imagine if you woke up tomorrow and your SO was in a completely different body, went from 6' with dark hair and broad shoulders to 5'5"" with blonde hair and a lithe build.

Plus, how many characters do we see or hear explicitly rule out ever being in a homosexual relationship? There could be plenty of gay and bi characters which we've just no reason to know about.   For example, it didn't occur to Riker to ask what the genitalia of that agendered race looks like when he fell in love with one of them, when the Trill symbiote Crusher fell in love with was implanted into a woman, Crusher only specifically said she was put off by the upheaval of the body-swapping as opposed to the new body's physical sex, and so on."

I don't see any benefit to tokenism, as I call what many have come to call 'representation' these days.   It provides no benefit that I can see - satisfying the arbitrary demands of people who can't 'relate' to anyone who isn't like them perpetuates the notion that the ethnic, sexual or gender minorities are fundamentally, irreconcilably different from one another. That's bad, as far as I'm concerned.  I don't want a television landscape filled with ethnic, gender and sexuality groups proportioned according to the most recent census, I want a television landscape filled with characters. The ones writers write, free of arbitrary meddling by others.  I have what would be considered a minority status myself and I can honestly say I have never enjoyed a show less merely because I'm not 'represented' - honestly, what a meaningless phrase."
DaystromInstitute,3avkdr,cavilier210,4,Wed Jun 24 13:50:48 2015 UTC,"I think you're not looking at the picture wide enough here. Sorry to get personal here, but I'm a gay man, and growing up, not having any sort of representation did do bad things, because bad representation exists. People like me on TV were either drugged-up deadbeats or AIDS sympathy pools. You can't say that doesn't have an effect on someone just because you yourself are fine with it. Maybe if I saw an environment friendlier to people like me, I would have not faced so much turmoil because of who I am, turmoil that, frankly a lot of people just don't have to deal with in the same way.   I looked up to heterosexuals just fine, but when you say that Captain Picard, Indiana Jones, etc. should be good enough for anyone, you're being dismissive of other people and reinforcing that there is a ""normal"" type of human being, and I hope you see the consequences of that.   When Whoopi Goldberg saw Nichelle Nichols on TV, she knew she could be an actress. Lupita Nyong'o saw Whoopi in The Color Purple and knew she found her calling. In a way, Gene Roddenberry's very intentional decision to cast a black woman, what you may call ""tokenism"" is the reason we have an Oscar-winning actress telling people, not just black girls, but everyone, on magazines, in interviews, and even in Sesame Street, that their skin is beautiful in all its colors. I'm glad a black woman was on that bridge, instead of a white man who ""we should all be able to relate to anyway.""  Imagine ""Far Beyond the Stars"" with a white man in the lead role. Would it even make sense? You can argue that everyone is the same on some level, which is more true than many people honestly admit, but you can't deny that we all have different experiences and that we can paint trends in these experiences according to how people are categorized by other people.   Good television shows have a duty beyond entertaining. Star Trek has always been a cut above because it understands that it has a role not only in showing us a bright future, but in trying to lift up the present as well. That's what makes truly transcendent television, and more than anything is why Star Trek has such a solidified place in our pop culture."

'People like you on TV'.... Being also gay doesn't make someone 'like you' nor intended to 'represent you'.   you're being dismissive of other people and reinforcing that there is a ""normal"" type of human being, and I hope you see the consequences of that.   What I said was that if you can't relate to people who don't share your minority status, that's on you, not on TV to fix. Because if it's valid to feel unable to relate to non-fellow minorities, it's valid for non-minority people to feel unable to relate to minorities. Is that valid?  I have a minority status you see on TV even less than gay men. I still don't have a problem relating to anyone because of it. Because depicting fictional characters who share my status doesn't make them 'like me' nor any more or less fun - or different in any way - to watch.   In all honesty, I'd be concerned about the mental health of any of my friends feeling that they couldn't enjoy TV that doesn't have characters the same color, orientation, gender or size as them - but I wouldn't expect TV to cater to them for it. It's just as racist to think there are too many white people on television as it is to think there are too many black (and so on), and maybe you can't help thinking that way, but it's on you to change your thinking, not TV to adapt to suit you. In making yourself feel so 'othered' by normal behavior that you 'other' non-minorities, you've become everything our predecessors who suffered genuine inequality and lack of representation (as in, in government) fought for."

DaystromInstitute,3atmd0,drafterman,29,Tue Jun 23 12:21:26 2015 UTC,"This is actually not too unreasonably hard to tackle from a genetics/virology point of view.   Every time an organism - be it a bacteria, an amoeba, a giraffe, a targ, or a person - is infected with a virus, that virus's DNA is incorporated into your genome. If a somatic cell is infected, that DNA will be passed on to future generations.   Much of the intron genetic material humans carry are the dormant remains of viral infections long, long ago.  Now, when a retrovirus infects a cell, it incorporates its genetic material into the host cell, and among its genetic material are genes that when transcribed by the host cell, trick it into making copies of the viral portion of the altered genome. Once the viral DNA is replicated, it is encapsulated with protein becoming a functional virion, and the cell is lysed releasing the virions which go on to infect other cells.   Some viruses very reliably only replicate their own genetic material, whereas some - due to mutations/splicing errors/etc - accumulate host genetic material. This leads to some viruses becoming very large. On earth, the largest known virus is the mimivirus, which has over 1 million base pairs - more genetic material than many types of bacteria.   If the virus used by Dr Crusher mutated to both adopt the ability to preserve some host DNA and infect species, in addition to its normal function, to activate intronic DNA -- it could very easily infect a spider living on the ship (say in the arboretum), be replicated with that spider's DNA, spread by whatever virulence factor it has,  be transmitted to Barclay, inject arachnid DNA it had recently acquired and cause Barclay to regress to arachnid form instead of the ancestral forms other crewmembers transformed into."

Its like saying ""Chimps have 95% of our DNA with some differences in expression yada yada"" Remember, Picard started to become some kind of Marmoset or Lemur, which would suggest that he was de-volving to an evolutionary step earlier than our ape ancestors.

Its like saying ""Chimps have 95% of our DNA with some differences in expression yada yada""    It is far-fetched to say that all humans have spider genes in their DNA from birth.   The reason that biologists say that we share 95% of our DNA with chimps is because chimpanzees and humans are both descended from a shared ancestor, with the split happening only about 5 to 7 million years ago (this diagram shows a family tree, with ""Homo"" representing humans and ""Pan"" representing chimpanzees). Humans and chimpanzees have each inherited large amounts of DNA from this shared ancestor, with which we each share a lot of common traits. This shared ancestor of humans and chimpanzees would have had traits like two hands, two feet, fur, opposable thumbs, and so on. But one line of descent led to chimpanzees and another line of descent led to humans.  As an analogy, consider that you and your siblings share some DNA because you are all descended from the same parents.   When it comes to spiders, our shared ancestor is a lot older. Humans are mammals. Mammals are vertebrates (with backbones). Spiders are arthropods. Arthopods are invertebrates (without backbones). Therefore, we need to look back to a time before animals split into a group with backbones and a group without backbones. This happened about 525 million years ago. In fact, arthropods arose slightly before that, about 555 million years ago. And, that shared ancestor was probably a segmented worm without legs. One line of descent from that segmented worm led to spineless fish, then backboned fish with internal skeletons, then eventually us. Another line of descent from that segmented worm led to animals with external skeletons, then animals with external skeletons and legs, then eventually spiders.   So, the genes we inherited from our shared ancestor with spiders come from a segmented worm which didn't have legs or any form of skeleton, internal or external. The genes for eight legs arose in the other line of descent; they're not in our ancestry.  As an analogy, consider that your cousins share some genes with you from your grandparents. However, they also have genes from the parent who married your aunt/uncle. You can not have any genes from this unrelated uncle/aunt-by-marriage."

Frankly all I have to say to your cousin analogy is consider this. The virus occurs on the USS Defiant and only you and your cousin are on board. Your cousin gets it first, then you contract it. The virus acts by activating the introns on the genes that you share. So then what? Do you both turn into each other? Or because your genes aren't share enough you sit there and explode? Dr. Crusher even explained it was the latent introns being activated by the virus that caused everything. Those deep down genes that are remnants of past organisms.

I'm just basing it according to your logic. I would assume that a lemur is waaaay less related to us than apes are. Lemurs arent even monkeys. It would have had to go lemurs to monkeys to apes, evolutionarily. I wonder how far back Klingon evolution goes to go from those horrid creatures into the fine example of a Star Fleet officer that Mr. Worf is.  You say that you would turn into an ancestor of both of yours. So by what youre saying I guess we would all just turn into that original bacteria that gave rise to all other organisms on Earth. But how fun would it be to say ""Commander Data the entire crew has been turned into bacteria, and oh looks like I'm turning into one too, please go save us all"" then the next 45 minutes is Data just trying to find bacteria on the ship. Spiders, lemurs, klingon beasts, whatever dude, it don't matter. If you gotta twist science a little or bend a few rules to make a great episode I really don't see the problem. We may not have Spider genes, but theres a comment down here that is well written that makes a lot of sense about how we can keep viral DNA pretty much over the eons. And the other comment  that as part of  /r/DaystromInstitute all we can do is come up with plausible explanations to that which has already occurred. Thats all. Have fun with it.  Also, only because this bothers me so much. You said ""You can not have any genes from this unrelated uncle/aunt-by-marriage"" Now do you mean 0 genes whatsoever? Or am I mistaken in saying that you and I, however distant we are from each other on Earth or in terms of families, share plenty of genes. They say all humans share 99.9% of DNA, but you're flat out saying that I cannot have any genes from even my aunt-by-marriage? What if we had the same exact color hair or eye color. I totally understand where you're coming from but we share DNA with everything, even trees. You and a tree will have some DNA in common, maybe not entire genes, but you will share something.

Also, all primates are descended from an original lemur-like ancestor (we've evolved further away from this shared ancestor than lemurs have). So, while you're absolutely right that the science in this episode is already faulty, a human reverting to a lemur doesn't stretch credibility quite as much as a human reverting to a spider. It's easier to suspend belief for small things like a primate becoming another primate than for big things like a mammal becoming an arthropod.    You said ""You can not have any genes from this unrelated uncle/aunt-by-marriage""    Don't take an analogy too literally. :)   You and a tree will have some DNA in common   Yes.

It wouldn't even be ... well I like what you're saying by ""core"" DNA, I gotcha, but remember its all the same in a ribosomes eyes. Its all about whats getting expressed in the nucleus of the specific cell. Cause think about how nuts even our own body is. Each cell has the exact same copy of DNA (barring mutations) yet each cell uses it differently, expresses it differently. It is factual that we share 95-98% of DNA with chimps (sources vary), and we do indeed share entire genes with some other species. But what makes that 5% difference matter so much is how its all expressed. The differences in lie in the instructions for proteins in expression as well as definite differences just here and there. Say me and my good friend Bubbles the chimp share 95% of our DNA. Well 2% of that might be where some of the T's that are in 3 genes, he has C's instead. Over 5 million years I gotta say that a 5% difference between us with so many similarities and differences in the final product is nothing short of extraordinary! You're 100% correct with the spiders and even the trees. We aren't sharing any genes with them I bet, and we definitely don't have genes for making...say...spiders silk... but we do indeed have a percentage of DNA similar to theirs, but its not ever gonna work like how it did in the show. You're right even the lemur is pushing it. But I'm still going to sit back and say ""eeeeeeeeehhhhhh thats how it happened...""

But that's just not true. We may share genes with any animal which split off from us from a common ancestor and both lines preserved those genes. We just don't have arachnoid genes because we NEVER had arachnoid genes. But any mammal? Probably."
DaystromInstitute,3atidl,adamkotsko,15,Tue Jun 23 11:34:20 2015 UTC,"http://en.memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Grappler  We're not given any specific info on the length. It is most likely fired with magnetic acceleration like a rail gun. The cord is probably made of carbon nano-tubes, though we're never told. We are however told that the hook is magnetic."
DaystromInstitute,3atidl,Greco412,12,Tue Jun 23 12:32:22 2015 UTC,"Once the tractor beams exist, those systems are more versatile than a physical grappler. If you need to tow something and the tractor beams are out, you have bigger problems and you don't need the tractor beam that badly. Meanwhile, the advantages of the tractor beam over a grappler are as follows:   As a beam, rather than a projectile, it's much easier to aim. You don't need to 'lead' your target. Tractor beams require more advanced technology, but a less complex fire control system.  The beam can spread, reducing shear forces and reducing the risk of breaking the thing you want to tow. Lack of reliance on a physical cable means you can mount several of them around the ship for marginal costs in volume. Tractor beams can move objects in any direction, not just a simple pull.  In short, there's very little reason to stock a grapple once tractor beams have been field-proven."
DaystromInstitute,3atidl,BestCaseSurvival,2,Tue Jun 23 17:01:33 2015 UTC,That makes a lot of sense -- thanks!
DaystromInstitute,3atidl,themojofilter,6,Tue Jun 23 22:35:38 2015 UTC,They place way too much importance on magnetism in these things. What would they do if aliens didn't use ferrous metals in their ship designs?

DaystromInstitute,3atidl,zuludown888,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:17:40 2015 UTC,"Why is the grappler necessary in the first place? Isn't the tractor beam just a graviton beam? Isn't that exactly how the artificial gravity works? They've got artificial gravity, after all, so did they just not figure out that they could strap one of the graviton emitters to the hull and go to work with it?"
DaystromInstitute,3atidl,ACAFWD,5,Wed Jun 24 03:32:29 2015 UTC,I assume the tractor beams need targeting technology which might not have been around yet. The power requirements for a tractor beam are probably pretty big as well. It takes a lot more effort to tractor beam something big and moving than it does to hold a bunch of people onto a floor.  Ninja edit: Gravity gets exponentially weaker the farther away you get from the source. People on a ship are centimeters away from the gravity netting on the floors of starships. A target of a tractor beam is likely hundreds of meters away from the tractor beam.  Assume the gravity netting is 5cm under an object and that an object of equal mass is 500m away from the emitter. The gravitational force of the object sitting on the emitter would be 108 times greater than the gravitational force on the object being held by the tractor beam.
DaystromInstitute,3atidl,happywaffle,5,Wed Jun 24 04:12:50 2015 UTC,"Correct, and (total head canon here) it seems that ""modern"" tractor beams counteract the exponential reduction problem by emitting some sort of additional matter or energy, which allows gravitons to exist closer to the target, and thus ensures that the required energy output isn't astronomical. (This also, incidentally, is what makes the tractor beams visible.)  Another interesting note: a graviton-based tractor beam can't just exert a constant pull on the target. It would of course accelerate towards the beam emitter and collide with it. So it needs to exert an interesting combination of push and pull to maintain the desired distance.  These two considerations might have been beyond the abilities of NX-01-era technology."
DaystromInstitute,3atidl,uptotwentycharacters,2,Wed Jun 24 17:16:33 2015 UTC,"I've heard some fan theories that say tractor beams are a special application of shield technology, so since the NX lacked shields it wouldn't be able to use tractor beams either. I believe shields are said to be a form of graviton technology as well. And just because a technology exists doesn't mean it can be used effectively for all purposes, for example they do clearly have artificial gravity technology but they may lack some additional technology needed along with graviton technology to allow tractor beams to function."
DaystromInstitute,3aq7qn,kraetos,76,Mon Jun 22 16:52:01 2015 UTC,"As counterpoint to Garak, I'd like to nominate Q.  His maturation as a character was, to say the least, interesting.  In the first few episodes, he is portrayed as a mixture of a ""tough-love parent"" with a bit of ""kid with a magnifying glass burning ants"" thrown in.  He was shrouded in mystery, inconceivably powerful, and seemingly at the mercy of his own whims.  He was not perfect (i.e., Picard verbally out-danced him when quoting Shakespeare (TNG: ""Hide and Q"")), but was convinced of his own superiority.  Perhaps most importantly, he introduced the Federation to its greatest, most ruthless enemy: the Borg.  This was a move that was very in-line with his ""tough love"" moral compass; a move that not only taught Picard et al. a valuable lesson about reining in their sense of galactic confidence, but also helping prepare them for the oncoming, relentless brutality of these odd, hiveminded, albino cyborgs.    This was perhaps his greatest lesson, and is a bit of a theme with regard to Q - his penchant for teaching (be it on a personal level, or a Federation-wide level) while giving out ""bloody noses"" once in a while.  And that is a notion that is perfectly in-line with an entity whose age spans millions of eons.  His later appearances were less inclined to the broad-scale teaching moments that would benefit the whole Federation and instead focused on more intimate matters - namely, Picard - even if surrounded by an unflappable air of absolute superiority and a sizable dash of comic-relief (TNG: ""Deja Q,"" ""...how do I convince you that I'm mortal?!""  ""Die."").  Nonetheless, Q's quest to help Picard discover himself was instrumental in aiding the personal development of a man who was so very career-oriented.  Don't get me wrong - Picard was already in touch with himself, but I do like to think that Q added to the details of Picard's soul.  In other words, Q took one of the Federation's best career men and helped him with himself.  For his appearances on Voyager, Q opened himself up to being taught regarding the nature of children.  And what symbolism!  We, as gallant explorers, chart the cosmos akin to how a child sits in his cardboard box at home and dreams of exploring the living room in his spaceship.  In that sense, Q provides a wonderful allegory for the viewer...that by learning about raising his own child, he is in fact learning how to raise humans.  It's too bad that wasn't explored a bit further.  Aside from Q's introduction of the Federation to the Borg, one of his most influential appearances was in VOY: ""Death Wish,"" in which Q explores the nature of existence in a way that he hadn't yet done on-screen.  In most of his TNG appearances, Q is content to teach humanity a lesson regarding how to continue existing.  ""Death Wish"" turned it upside down in that Q was himself taught about what it means to die.  That there is something liberating to the notion that immortality isn't the apex of evolution.    In other words, where Q was teacher in TNG, he was pupil in Voyager.  That shift in personality paradigm is unique among characters in the Star Trek universe as far as I'm aware.  And, however, you qualify/quantify ""interestingness,"" this undoubtedly is just that.  Interesting to the hilt.  I don't want to outright compare Q to Garak, but I will say that what Q was able to - again this word - ""teach"" the crew of the Enterprise and the Federation as a whole (while himself being taught in Voyager) must be on par with some of the most influential encounters in the entire run of Star Trek.  *Edits: grammar."
DaystromInstitute,3aq7qn,KalEl1232,7,Mon Jun 22 17:15:27 2015 UTC,"I wasn't a fan of how much they mellowed his character in Voyager.   TNG Q has a case, but I don't think Voyager Q does."

DaystromInstitute,3aq7qn,Ardress,11,Mon Jun 22 20:35:51 2015 UTC,"The problem with Damar though, is that while his story may be interesting, he himself is not. He's a quite, bored, pouting man. I never see him and say, ""Yeah! Damar is in this scene!"" Contrast that to Dukat, Garak, and Q. All of whom are charismatic, intelligent, and talkative. They are loved characters because they are a joy to see on the screen. Damar isn't. He's just a dull man who has had the fortune of knowing far more interesting people."

DaystromInstitute,3aq7qn,mono-math,3,Tue Jun 23 14:07:49 2015 UTC,"And his story only really became interesting in the final series, or at the earliest, season 6. He was a bit of a nothing character before then."
DaystromInstitute,3aq7qn,fishey_me,11,Tue Jun 23 09:42:42 2015 UTC,"Dukat was certainly well developed and Alaimo is a great actor, but his almost uniformly pompous and evil demeanor (especially from the outset) made him very hard to sympathize with, which turned me off from wanting to learn more about him. The only time I really felt anything for him was when his relationship with Ziyal was developed. Otherwise, he was a bad guy who either didn't know or didn't care that he was literally the most despicable person in the Star Trek franchise. I mean, the Borg were scary, the Dominion was powerful, and Khan was ruthless, but Dukat... he wanted the people he subjugated to praise him for being a despot, and never realized why they hated him for it. Now, that's very well written, very interesting, and in some places a lot of fun to watch, but I don't think he's more interesting than Garak, personally."
DaystromInstitute,3aq7qn,KargBartok,9,Mon Jun 22 20:11:14 2015 UTC,"My favorite moment is when DS9 thinks it is under attack, and Dukat offers help. When he tries to abandon them, a subroutine left by his commander forces him to stay and he is suddenly not in control."
DaystromInstitute,3aq7qn,addctd2badideas,9,Tue Jun 23 00:11:50 2015 UTC,He doesn't actually try to help. He tries to leverage concessions from them instead. He got what he deserved.

DaystromInstitute,3aq7qn,stingray85,17,Tue Jun 23 07:15:34 2015 UTC,"He developed very well defined relationships with the main cast members from his show, his backstory was satisfying, and he played a key role Deep Space Nine's overall arc.   All of this could be said of Nog as well. Moreover the overall development of Garak - as a Cardassian turncoat who ends up having some kind of loyalty to his new Federation friends - is not that challenging. Nog on the other hand is the first Ferengi to join the Federation, coming from a Ferengi culture that almost universally deplores Federation society. His development as a character is much more interesting, more like some of the most interesting main characters like Spock or Worf - trying to fit into an essentially alien culture without abandoning their own."
DaystromInstitute,3aq7qn,choralmaster,15,Mon Jun 22 23:41:39 2015 UTC,"I think my reason I love Nog so much is because he goes from a do nothing, illiterate who's goal is to get in as much trouble as possible, to being something because he got someone to actually care that he does well.  And because he has that nurturing presence in his life, he takes it the rest of the way to make something of himself.  And, on top of that, because of his actions, he motivates his dad to try and do the same.    Also, the funny thing is, even as he makes himself into a Starfleet officer, he still shows pieces of himself throughout the process.  He still loves a little bit of mischief now and then. :)"
DaystromInstitute,3aq7qn,SqueaksBCOD,16,Tue Jun 23 00:29:12 2015 UTC,"Not only that, he does not get his happily ever after.  Often times in media the message sent is that if you ""do the right thing"" and/or ""follow your heart""  you are making the right choice.  Well losing a fucking leg is certainly one way to give family friends the chance to say ""I told you so!""  So on top of all you said, we get to see him struggle with a realistic aspect of war, in a way we don't often see in Trek.  I love his line It's Only a Paper Moon when asked if he is ok and he says ""No, but I will be"" we don't get that often.  We don't get to see people not be ok, but then move on often in Trek.   Nog often showed us raw realness.  Like when he cried out ""because I don't want to end up like my father!"" in explanation of why he wanted to join starfleet.  That is a very relateable emotion, but not one often admitted too, especially in Trek.  Seeing your parents' short comings can be painful, but also it does happen.   I also really love how the explored him still being a Ferengi, while being in Starfleet. ""In Treachery, Faith and the Great River"" and ""In the Cards"" he ends up making the entire station happier by following Ferengi values!  Following the values of a race that was largely intended to be a farce of some of the worst aspect of humanity leads to all being happy - that is wonderful!  Showing how nothing is black and white and we can all find a way to get along.  He never gave up his culture, he just looked for ways his culture could be usefully integrated into other cultures.  O'Brien showed interest in playing the trading Ferengi game in the end, because he saw it could work and was happy to look at things  that work.  I love that Nog did not metamorphosize into a Starfleet drone, but rather become a Ferengi Starfleet officer.    Nog really was a wonderful addition to trek.  Though I might concede others might be more ""interesting"" he likely takes the award for closest to regular cast member based on his usage."

DaystromInstitute,3aq7qn,anonlymouse,6,Tue Jun 23 13:14:31 2015 UTC,"While I agree that Elim Garak is a very interesting character, and perhaps in my top ten, I don’t agree that he is the most interesting character in the Star Trek universe that reoccurs. Instead of going to someone like Q, who is more like Tom Bombadil than an actual god, or going to the traveler, who appears to be something less than Q, but incredibly fascinating intellectually, I would like to keep this in the realm of Cardassians, because they tend to offer more than their next closest intriguing counterparts, the Romulans.   As some have mentioned already, Damar would be a much better example of a Cardassian who is more interesting than Garak, when thought is applied to the formula of what makes one interesting. First of all, Garak is more a tortured soul who has done a lot of torturing. When it comes to Garak, I am afraid that the actor who portrays Garak is far better than deserving, that being Andrew J. Robinson. When looking at Damar, he rose from the ranks, became a leader, rebelled, and died as the savor of Cardassia. There aren’t many in the Star Trek universe who can compete with that, and I would suggest that only Worf really could, at least for non-humans.  But Damar is more of a religious icon in the end, and not all that interesting. His story is very interesting, but as a character, it wasn’t until season 7 of Deep Space Nine that he began to really shine. So moving onto perhaps the second most interesting Cardassian, and although we all tend to despise him, he is even more worthy than Damar, and that is Gul Dukat. Dukat went from being the leader of the Bajoran sector to rising the ranks even higher to being one of the top leaders in the Cardassian Empire. During his rise, he sure raised hell for Bajor in subtle ways. However, several events shaped him and changed him into an insane character, such as the death of his daughter, Tora Ziyal, as well as his personal war with the Klingons. Things got even more strange as he was taken over by the Pah-Wraiths on multiple occasions and ended up being an ultimate vessel for them as their Emissary.   But even Dukat is less interesting than my top pick for most interesting reoccurring Star Trek character, and that would be Enabran Tain. Nobody in the Star Trek universe that is reoccurring has such interest as far as I am concerned. Characters like Gul Dukat and Damar have little in the way of intrigue as Tain. Garak owes everything he is to his father, Enabran Tain, and it is Tain that appears to have been the one that rose through the ranks of the Obsidian Order to lead it and to be, from what I remember, the only one in recent times to retire without dying. In order for someone to have been in his position, they would have to have done a lot more than what we associate with Garak. For my money, the Tal Shiar is more about espionage and gradual manipulation, but the Obsidian Order is more heavy-handed. They are spoken of more and Cardassians seem to be more afraid of them than Romulans are of the Tal Shiar. And Tain is their leader. Not only that, but he united the two most influential espionage institutions in the Alpha Quadrant, Section 31 aside. This man somehow ended up as a prisoner of the Dominion, was rescued by his complicated son, and then retaliated with a union of the Obsidian Order and Tal Shiar’s fleets in order to secretly destroy the homeworld of the founders. Tain has balls. I find that Tain is the most interesting reoccurring Star Trek character.  Edit: Screwed the pooch on that one. Tain was taken prisoner AFTER the failed attack on the founder's homeworld."
DaystromInstitute,3aq7qn,yoshemitzu,15,Tue Jun 23 02:24:37 2015 UTC,"Garak is more mysterious than interesting. Sure, mystery creates a kind of interest, but once you've figured out the mystery it's rather dull. He would have been more ""interesting"" if his back story had never been explained (much like we're still wondering what that hand gesture Guinan made to Q was all about).  Weyoun on the other hand was very interesting. He was a character with unconditional love for all changelings, and every time he had to go against DS9 - and thereby Odo - he was having his own internal conflict. Much like the Prime Directive is a thorn in the side of anyone with a conscience, making it impossible for an easy answer to come about. We saw this in the most pronounced way with Weyoun 6 and 7, seeing both of them act in equally logical fashions given their personal ethics, but quite in opposition to each other. Weyoun 6 wasn't a defect, he was inevitable. And all the Weyouns are a look at what happens when you have complete conviction to a principle, and things suddenly stop being as easy as you'd imagined. How do you keep going without breaking your conviction in either way?"
DaystromInstitute,3aq7qn,hseldon10,7,Mon Jun 22 19:51:36 2015 UTC,"He would have been more ""interesting"" if his back story had never been explained (much like we're still wondering what that hand gesture Guinan made to Q was all about).   I think the most fascinating aspect of Garak is that his backstory isn't truly ever explained. We know he's Tain's son, and from this, we can infer that his ""sons of Tain"" monologues from ""The Wire"" weren't entirely dishonest, but we never actually learn the truth of what Garak did to Tain that alienated him so much from his father, his mentor, and in a sense, his idol (Edit: I absolutely love Robinson's acting when Tain accuses him of betrayal, and Robinson retorts ""I never betrayed you...at least, not in my heart"").   Garak wanted to be the level of spy that Tain was (the only leader of the Obsidian Order ever to live long enough to retire), but all we know (or at least can suspect) is that despite the cutthroat, willing-to-do-what-it-takes spy/agent that we see from Garak at times, he was principled enough in some way that even he had lines he wasn't willing to cross.  This makes him fascinating to me, and while I'd love to know what happened, I agree with your general thesis that knowing is often not as satisfying as the mystery."
DaystromInstitute,3aq7qn,sisko4,9,Tue Jun 23 00:01:45 2015 UTC,"Garak only appears in DS9.  Q appears in TNG, DS9 and VOY, helping the saga be knitted together.  We never actually know a lot about Garak. We have to guess. Sure, he's mysterious, but we never know if he actually grows as a character. It seems that his purpose is mostly to be a moral counterpoint for whatever plot he happens to be a part of.  In contrast, Q actually creates plot. He starts off and ends TNG. He helps establish a contrast between Picard and Sisko. He also pesters Janeway in ways we all wish she was pestered more often.  Q also has character growth, and his whole species evolves with him.  Some of the best quotes around Star Trek were uttered by Q, yet there are few memorable Garak quotes.  Conclusion: Q is the better recurring character."
DaystromInstitute,3aq7qn,noobviousreason,10,Mon Jun 22 21:08:12 2015 UTC,"To be fair to Garak though... Q is literally a wildcard that any writer can abuse without much care for existing plot or structure.  He's like those time travel episodes that reset the status quo at the end, combined with an infinite holodeck.  Garak has to remain within the confines of the overall narrative, as his actions have consequences that play out slowly... Q on the other hand can do anything... even things that appear like character growth."
DaystromInstitute,3aq7qn,MeVasta,3,Tue Jun 23 04:29:43 2015 UTC,"I think you may have just inadvertently written a very strong vote for Q.  Time travel + infinite holodeck sounds pretty awesome and that doesn't even scratch the surface of his full ability to intrigue and entertain.  Throw in some John Delancy comedic skill, some priceless chemistry with the mains and most importantly a great misanthropic counter point to the federation's optimism and that's a pretty tough act to follow.  I agree that writing him may be a relative cakewalk but the issue here is ""interesting"".  I think Q dancing on the bridge with the Mariachi band is just about the most colorful and glorious thing in the shows history."
DaystromInstitute,3aq7qn,sunnyandtony,3,Tue Jun 23 07:08:39 2015 UTC,"I like your point about Q creating plot, but I have to disagree on the quote part.  Q and his episodes have a lot of comedic moments that are remembered fondly, but Garak has at least the same amount of humor about him, combined with mystery and intrigue. Some examples:        ""I never tell the truth because I don't believe there is such a thing.""        ""Of all the stories you told me, which ones were true and which ones weren't?"" - ""My dear Doctor, they're all true."" - ""Even the lies?"" - ""Especially the lies.""

DaystromInstitute,3aq7qn,Nexgod2,5,Mon Jun 22 20:31:33 2015 UTC,"I think Khan is a potential challenger to Garak.  Khan also has an interesting back-story, as he was the most successful of the genetically engineered humans, and escaped the fate that fell upon the others.  From what we know, he prevailed because he was one of the more benign Augments.  He has much in common with Kirk: opportunistic, well-read, womanizing, coercive, even vengeful.  Yet, in contrast, Khan is ruthless and gives no hesitation to hurting, torturing or killing others for his own ends.  Unlike most Trek villains, Khan hasn't needed the luxury of superior technology or physical prowess to be a formidable opponent.  He proved his ""insidiousness"" in taking single-handedly taking over the Enterprise by surprise.    Despite how much Khan and Kirk hate each other, they still appear to have a mutual respect for one another. Khan was the only enemy to outwit Kirk at his own game.  He is one of the few recurring characters that even non-trekkies know about just because his character is so compelling and imposing."
DaystromInstitute,3aq7qn,vir4030,4,Tue Jun 23 02:28:10 2015 UTC,"Guinan is by far the most interesting recurring character. I hope she qualifies because honestly she's very interesting! The time travel episode with Data is a great example of her  excellence! She's extremely mysterious, and unlike a lot of complaints of Garak, her nature is never really a mystery to solve, she just is! She's very all knowing. Also can I some love for for Lwaxana Troi, maybe not the most interesting, but she definitely has her moments!"
DaystromInstitute,3aq7qn,Snedeker,0,Tue Jun 23 04:15:04 2015 UTC,"Absolutely!  Q isn't interesting, he's a plot device.  Who's Garak?"
DaystromInstitute,3aq7qn,SqueaksBCOD,3,Tue Jun 23 07:31:57 2015 UTC,"I'd like to come at this in two ways. First, why Garak isn't that interesting of a character, and second who is actually the most interesting.  Ok, so everyone loves Garak. He's an unassuming tailor with a secret backstory. Everyone underestimates him and treats him as a non-entity, but deep down he is more powerful than anyone could ever imagine. Essentially he is a run of the mill schoolboy fantasy character. He follows the exact same path as Harry Potter, or Spiderman, or Luke Skywalker. He's a tried and true archtype character that everyone is comfortable with, and while ""entertaining"" is not very interesting.  I'd suggest Kai Winn for the most interesting recurring character in Star Trek. She's universally hated, but it is too easy to call her simply evil. She develops as a character, but is never redeemed. She changes, but stays the same. She schemes as much a Garak, but she does it in a way that is offputting and uncomfortable, and is still just as successful.   If I could have a second (more minor) character that is more interesting than Garak, I would pick Michael Eddington. He is entirely unexpected and atypical. You could spend hours analyzing his motivations and actions. He is a well respected member of Starfleet who throws it all away for the sake of his beliefs. If you rewatch some of his scenes knowing what will become of him, he must have a steady nerve that would put Garak to shame."

DaystromInstitute,3aq7qn,NoName_2516,5,Tue Jun 23 05:21:26 2015 UTC,"Well, you see, the issue here is the pure subjectivity of what one considers an interesting character, and for what reasons.

Just to give you an idea of characters who fit these requirements that you're not considering:   Shran Weyoun Neelix? (don't remember if he shows up in intro sequences) Nog Vic Fontaine (questionable, I know) Damar DUKAT Q, as already explored by /u/KalEl1232 Dolim Daniels (little background, though) Guinan (oh come on, it doesn't matter if Whoopi was listed, Guinan counts) Khan (if you want to count movies) Kor Kang Koloth (with these three I admit I'm scraping the bucket) Ro   TLDR: That's just like, your opinion, man."

DaystromInstitute,3arne7,fikustree,12,Wed Jun 24 19:51:29 2015 UTC,"The Eugenics Wars being in the 90s never bothered me just because the date has already past. No matter what date you pick it's going to pass, so shoving it back to a later date is at best a temporary fix, and the more vague it is the less relevance it has to the audience. I'm also fine with the Trek timeline obviously not being our timeline.  Romulans not having a ton of exploration also didn't bother me, although by the time I was watching Trek they'd long been established as a sneaky and mysterious evolutionary fork. But what on Earth ""reunification"" would mean for the Romulans and the Vulcans still makes me scratch my head to this day. Still, that's a TNG matter.  That being said I do want to contribute to the topic as well as discuss the OP. The Organian Peace Treaty is a pretty huge deal that actually provides the drive for at least one later episode (noteworthy, given how standalone so much of TOS is supposed to be), and yet it's never talked about again outside of TOS (maybe TAS?). A Klingon ship controlled by Klingons attacks Federation ships no problem in Star Trek III, so what went on? Was the treaty a short term one and then the Organians peaced out or something? Did Kirk come back off-screen several episodes later and realize he can try the 'man needs freedom' argument? Can you still attack if you're not working for your government?  It's -definitely- not in effect at all by TNG.  It's a shame, because I think the Organian peace treaty is a really great concept. Two major powers getting their noses tweaked and forced into a colonization and civilization-stewarding competition when they'd both love to tear into each other, and they're supposed to be friends someday. TOS kind of introduced the notion of the Federation and Klingons working together when they had to team up to laugh away that energy being who fed on anger, and not being friends but for a time not being enemies.  Then nobody ever talks about this weird, forced peace treaty ever again."
DaystromInstitute,3arne7,Berggeist,4,Tue Jun 23 05:53:56 2015 UTC,"I think the Organian Peace Treaty is a good example of the fact that the writers are pretty free with TOS canon -- even within TOS itself.

Basically the Federation, but much more nosey.  Or, the Federation mixed with Judge Dredd.  Picture Bender saying ""They must learn our peaceful ways, by force!"".  Amusingly, their arrival coincides with several alpha quadrant ships that have met peacefully at the Organian homeworld to try and figure out where the Organians went.

DaystromInstitute,3arne7,CitizenjaQ,8,Tue Jun 23 12:19:01 2015 UTC,"Right, that's how it's explained away. Or that Kirk being a starship captain prevented Lester from being with him romantically. They're both plausible, and there's no way to know the original intent for sure. But Lester's hatred of her own womanhood makes me believe it was that quality which prevented her from being offered a command.   JANICE: The year we were together at Starfleet is the only time in my life I was alive.  KIRK: I never stopped you from going on with your space work.   JANICE: Your world of starship captains doesn't admit women. It isn't fair.  KIRK: No, it isn't. And you punished and tortured me because of it.   JANICE: I loved you. We could've roamed among the stars.   KIRK: We'd have killed each other.   JANICE: It might have been better.   (Kirk has a look around the room, and finds a wall-sized device with strange carvings. Janice sits up, points a remote at it and it lights up, pulling Kirk onto its surface. Janice gets out of bed, flips a switch on the device then stands in front of it too. She flips another switch then the machine works. We are shown images of Janice and Kirk going into the other's body.)   (Kirk steps down first and switches the machine off. He carries Janice back to the bed)   KIRK: You had your chance, Captain Kirk. You should've smothered the life in me. Then they would have said Doctor Janice Lester died of radiation poisoning in the line of duty. Why didn't you do it? You always wanted to. Didn't you? You had the strength to do it. But you were afraid. You were always afraid. Now Janice Lester takes the place of Captain Kirk. I already possess your physical strength. Only this Captain Kirk is not afraid to kill. Now you know the indignity of being a woman. For you this agony will soon pass, as it has for me. Quiet. Quiet! Believe me, it's better to be dead than to live alone in the body of a woman.

Kirk getting split into his aggressive and passive halves, Riker getting duplicated, Tuvix - that's not to say that these episodes were all bad, but they raise too many questions that are left unanswered and don't all seem to work consistently.

DaystromInstitute,3arne7,uptotwentycharacters,10,Thu Jun 25 09:25:37 2015 UTC,"And even their initial foray in ""Neutral Zone"" was retconned into a Borg attack!   That was actually never intended to be the Romulans.  http://en.memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Borg#Background_information   The Borg were initially conceived by Maurice Hurley as a race of insectoids. Hurley wrote in to ""The Neutral Zone"" a plot point that Federation and Romulan starbases along the Romulan Neutral Zone had been mysteriously wiped out, having been ""scooped off"" the face of the planet in the same way that would later be referenced in ""Q Who"" and shown in ""The Best of Both Worlds"". This was intended to lead into a series of episodes that would have introduced the Borg as a main villain in the wake of the Ferengi's complete failure to meet with audience expectations of a major Starfleet antagonist.      I feel like if they could go back in time, the writing staff for TNG forward would have liked to request that the authors of Space Seed (and Wrath of Khan!) leave the date vague and open.   What exactly do you base this on? It seems to me that this 'feeling' is mostly based on your own perspective on the Wars, and not any particular aspect of TNG-era writers' philosophy.    EDIT: To answer your actual question, I am HUGELY INFURIATED by the tendency of TOS to act like the Federation is exploring - quite literally - over the whole galaxy, when later series make it quite clear that the Federation is a drop in the bucket. Here are some quotes that show what I'm talking about:   PIKE: Can you hear me? My name is Christopher Pike, commander of the space vehicle Enterprise from a stellar group at the other end of this galaxy. Our intentions are peaceful. Can you understand me?  KELSO: Screen on, sir. Approaching galaxy edge, sir.  BARSTOW: You may not be aware of its scope. It occurred in every quadrant of the galaxy and far beyond. Complete disruption of normal magnetic and gravimetric fields, timewarp distortion, possible radiation variations. And all of them centring on the general area which you are now patrolling. The question is, are these natural phenomena or are they mechanically created, and if they are, by whom? For what purpose? Your guess, Captain.   From here.  EDIT 2: That is, however annoying that is to me, TNG stomped all over it."
DaystromInstitute,3arne7,Darth_Rasputin32898,13,Mon Jun 22 23:44:02 2015 UTC,"The ""other end of the galaxy"" quote is also an example an of inconsistency in TOS, that of warp speed. Particularly in TOS, there were cases of ships moving far faster than the claimed warp speed would seem to allow, going by the ""warp factor cubed"" equation (stated as early as the Star Fleet Technical Manual and finally made canon in Star Trek: Enterprise). I seem to recall that even by a very loose interpretation of this line (i.e., viewing it as referring to the thickness rather than the diameter of the galaxy) would imply a distance of around 1,000 light years, which would take several years at the Enterprise's cruising speed of warp 6. Basically the distances stated in TOS did at times lead to the Federation seeming much larger and more advanced than it was later established as being."

I didn't say it made no sense to read that comment as you did, so I gladly make said concession. What I meant was that this comment is at best ambiguous, and so interpreting it in a certain way - to be exact, the way that leads us to ignore concrete onscreen statements (yours) - requires a bit more evidence. She does say the lack of mention was in order to 'be true to [the Wars]' so it seems they did not mean to overwrite or blur anything, even if she wasn't referring directly to the dates. Like I say, I think that's a bit too far from your line of reasoning about TOS:   TOS was written when no one expected whole other TV shows to be based on it, so it's ok to ignore the few concrete dates it used   In fact, it looks to me like there's a second statement that further suggests the actual goal of avoiding the Eugenics Wars was to avoid confusion rather than rewrite Star Trek history:   Furthermore, in an audio commentary for Star Trek: First Contact, Brannon Braga states that it was decided not to have the Eugenics Wars in this episode because ""it would just be kind of strange."" This decision was also made, however, because Voyager's writing staff didn't want to bog the ""Future's End"" two-parter down by having to explain the Eugenics Wars to the majority of the audience (who, according to the series' research, were irregular viewers of Voyager and not hard-core fans of the series)."

I think that different people draw the line at different episodes.  For some people, it's too farfetched to believe that Janeway and Paris became salamanders and were brought back. For others, the idea of the Borg queen capturing 7 of 9 to find any way to invade the federation, but had never thought of, I don't know, sending more than one cube, is just unbelievable.

Especially for communicating with people who are off-world.  What are the practical limits of real time communication in the Federation?  The Star Trek Encyclopedia had a warp speed chart, and according to Ex Astris Scientia listed warp 9.9999 ( 199516x light speed ) as the maximum speed of subspace radio, with relays. If anyone has a better (or canonical!) reference for this, please do share!  So, the one-way communication latency for a single light year when sending a message at 199516c is...   365.25 * 24 * 3600 = 31557600 seconds/year  subspace speed is 199516 ly / year  31557600 / 199516 = 158 seconds latency per light year (one way)   ... OK so that's 5 minutes round-trip per light year. Earth <-> Alpha Centauri (4.4 ly) is going to have a latency of 1390 seconds / 23 minutes round trip at that speed.  The Encyclopedia isn't canonical, and we have examples of interstellar real time communication... so I guess we have to assume TNG-era subspace radio can be much, much, much faster than 199516c."

Maybe they could use CMO command authorizations to remove authorization from the senior officers?

DaystromInstitute,3aq5ks,andrewkoldwell,8,Mon Jun 22 16:46:44 2015 UTC,"Agreed. The Command Codes allow them to override systems in case of medical emergency and allow them to ""lock out"" others who are ""unfit for duty"".  Having authority and using it are two different things. There are probably all kinds of audits in place and if a CMO is abusing their command codes (ie: using a medical override for personal gain, relieving someone of duty when they're still fit for duty, etc..) they would probably be Court-martialled."

DaystromInstitute,3aq5ks,drdeadringer,3,Mon Jun 22 17:33:43 2015 UTC,"Environmental controls are the ones that interest me. It seems likely their command codes could override life support and possibly airlocks in the event of an airborne pathogen. For more extreme cases, such as those where they have to make the hard decision of sealing off a section of a ship to prevent the death of the entire crew, maybe they require confirmation from the next-highest-ranking medical officer on the ship. And in disastrous cases such as in ""Genesis"", where a whole goddamn ship is turning into monsters, maybe they can even activate one of the self-destruct systems with confirmation from other command or medical personnel. After all, if the command crew is incapacitated by mutational monster virus, you wouldn't want a rescue ship to just blindly transport over an away team and risk the same fate."
DaystromInstitute,3aq5ks,jwpar1701,2,Mon Jun 22 17:54:15 2015 UTC,"I disagree with the other ocvmmentors that focus on their medical authority. Yes they could override the Commanding Officers in certain situations etc but they were also fully trained Starfleet Commanders. Dr Crusher's command codes could activate the self destruct as we saw in ST:FC although she was technically serving as the ship's XO  ""Computer, Commander Beverly Crusher. Confirm auto-destruct sequence, authorization Crusher 2-2 Beta Charlie.""  Chief medical officers were eligible to take the Bridge Officer's Test for promotion to full commander and they were considered capable of assuming command of a starship. Dr Crusher was a fully trained and capable command level officer, as she was occassionally given night watch on the bridge and led the skeleton crew onboard the Enterprise while the rest of the crew looked for Data."
DaystromInstitute,3aqohj,ILikeDickButt,8,Mon Jun 22 18:56:15 2015 UTC,"Well honestly, i wouldnt build just one ship. Starfleet needs an entire battle fleet, built for combat from the ground up. Destroyers, cruisers, battleships and carriers. These need to be built for battle and to be independent from their science ships."
DaystromInstitute,3aqohj,butterhoscotch,7,Mon Jun 22 22:34:55 2015 UTC,"I want to preface this with something. The Scimitar was destroyed by what may have been the first joint Federation/Romulan alliance that didn't involve war. The Romulan Valdore-type Warbirds under the command of Commander Donatra worked with the Enterprise-E to disable and destroy the Scimitar, the captain of which was responsible for the deaths of the Romulan Senate and the destabilization of the Romulan political system during a time of change. The Romulus after the events of ""Reunification"" the Dominion War, and the Reman uprising would almost certainly have been prepared to make peace with the Federation, meaning that the Federation wouldn't need to build a battleship.   Rather, the Borg are probably the singular threat that would require the Federation to task Starfleet with the creation of a battle fleet, which is where the Defiant-class came from.   And the Defiant simply has to be central to any discussion about the Federation/Starfleet and warships, because it was among the first and it's design says a lot about how Starfleet might conceptualize combat strategy. The Defiant could have been a hulking dreadnought armed with dozens of phaser arrays and photon torpedo launchers and such, but that's not the direction they went in. While the ship was armed to the teeth and had state of the art defenses, it was also incredibly nimble and relatively small. Its armaments were better than a Galaxy-class, but it could maneuver better than a runabout and it was highly capable of quick directional changes and sudden acceleration and deceleration.   If I were tasked with creating a Federation/Starfleet battleship, I would create a second-generation Defiant. It would be a corvette, a highly powerful escort ship with the power of a Warbird but the maneuverability of a Bird of Prey. The main things I'd change for the Defiant would be to put the damned bridge in the center of the ship. Everything else, though, I'd simply allow to upgrade as technology improved, things like better phaser canons, better armor (ablative), better shields, better engines, better propulsion, a better cloak (the phase cloak off Pegasus?), etc. I already think the concept of the ship is absolutely right on.   Think of it this way: you can build one Sovereign-class like the Enterprise-E or like three Defiant-class ships. All else being equal (experienced crews) which would you rather face?   It reminds me of the White Star-class ship on Babylon 5, actually, where it's high-technology inside medium-sized ships which are highly capable in combat. And, just like the White Stars, Starfleet would create a fleet of these ships which would serve as the military wing of Starfleet, capable of defending the Federation from military threats instead of sending in science vessels."
DaystromInstitute,3aqohj,Willravel,3,Tue Jun 23 03:56:23 2015 UTC,"Super ships are terrible idea.  They can only be in one place at a time, they are too valuable to risk in decisive engagements, and your whole empire is put at risk when your opponent inevitably finds a weak spot on this single vessel.    How many times have we seen a Federation captain take down a tactically superior opponent because they made the mistake of using one giant ship, when a fleet of more reasonable vessels would have almost certainly been effective?  Just off the top of my head: The Doomsday Machine, two Borg Cubes, the Scimitar, Regent Worf's command ship, the NuTrek Dreadnought, ...Im sure there are at least a half dozen others.  The only super ships that were even marginally effective were the Negh'Var and the Dominion Dreadnoughts, and those had to be supported by massive fleets and were only useful against large and relatively static enemy formations."

DaystromInstitute,3aqohj,CubeOfBorg,2,Thu Jun 25 01:34:12 2015 UTC,"Central skeleton with redundant M/AM power plants, redundant impulse reactors, and a battle bridge buried deep in its center. Mission specific modules could be attached to the skeleton to provide additional shields, weapons, cargo holds, troop transport, etc. Modules could be swapped rapidly with support vessels constructed to ferry modules between dreadnoughts.  There could even be a Ferry module if necessary to allow a dreadnought group to form with one of them acting as the milk cow. The modular design would depend on an ablative armor system that allows the ship to ""wrap"" installed modules in both shields and ablative armor after installation.  A dreadnought group could have a milk cow capable of applying ablative armor to its sister ships between battles.   The weapons system would be built around the idea of projecting force as far from the ship as possible.  The primary weapons systems would be based around delivering the most destructive force possible as accurately as possible at as great a distance as can be achieved.  The focus would be on beam weaponry, which would still be effective at short range as well.     The assumption is that the ship will be damaged by enemy fire.  Maneuverability is not paramount because the only way to reliably avoid being hit by the enemy is to out range them.  Shields obviously have to be as powerful as possible.  Redundancy is necessary for all major systems. Etc.  The end result of this, I believe, would be a hideous ship that looks like the love child of the Borg and the Federation.  EDIT: And as far as close range, I believe the ship should be designed to act as part of a dreadnought group.  Close range warfare should revolve around the ships 'getting each others backs' at all times.  After battle, if downtime is anticipated, the group can decide which ship is least battle ready and give it the role of milk cow by ferrying the necessary components to and from it."

More about /r/fangirls' origins (fun story time!): this digs a bit into the subreddit drama that happened about 4 months ago with /r/Supernatural's head moderator (edit: who is no longer a moderator of /r/supernatural). Short & sweet: he was a bad moderator & he was mean to a lot of people. He additionally had a very negative view of women who're fans (which isn't/wasn't just on him: a lot of people on Reddit think ""fangirls"" and shiver with disgust, images of sex-obsessed hysterical & shrieking tweens crossing their minds instead of incredibly talented fan artists, fanfic authors, podcasters, vidders, responsible & knowledgeable wiki admins, even subreddit moderators, the list goes on...).  Anyway, the moderator, in one of his rants, said this:   I even contemplated shutting [/r/supernatural] down for good, but then realizes you failfucks would just whine to an admin to bring it back with you in charge. (This would actually help you, by forcing people to go join /r/fangirl or whatever you're calling it.) So I'm keeping it out of spite.   From there I was like, ""holy shit - something like /r/fangirls could be an awesome subreddit!"" lol.  I'm the moderator of /r/fandomnatural - which is the fandom-side subreddit for the TV show Supernatural (& which may have been the subreddit the quoted guy had been meaning to indicate). The tone there is really similar to /r/trollxchromosomes & so I started out /r/fangirls with the general idea that we'd develop into a female-oriented group of fans with a good solid sense of humor (hence that banner lol) & diverse interests & fandoms that we could both share & learn about (& discuss to death lol) together in a safe environment (cite: the 2nd rule of /r/Fangirls).  Lengthy story there but it was definitely through a pretty funny chain of events that /r/fangirls came to be. And just FYI this origin story's not anywhere in the subreddit - all that drama is in the past & out of it came a super fucking cool group of subscribers, an awesome mod team, & a really nice space for everybody to talk about ALL the stuff they're a huge fan of in one place.

DaystromInstitute,3amiww,dr_john_batman,14,Sun Jun 21 18:09:22 2015 UTC,"Not a terrible theory at all, but some of your statements are a bit out of date.  Even Starfleet ships don't use dilithium as anything except a M/ARA reaction moderator and Romulan ships certainly don't use M/ARA cores, but instead power generation systems based on harnessing an artificial singularity.    If I could hazard an alternate theory, maybe the Thalaron generator wasn't only a weapon, but (in a different operating mode) a way to boost the power output of the Scimitar significantly to support its enhanced tactical systems."
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,qx9650,8,Sun Jun 21 18:23:39 2015 UTC,"You're right about Romulans not using M/ARA cores, but we know that for some reason they still mine dilithium in industrial quantities on Remus, suggesting that it still represents some kind of strategic resource. This isn't what I had in mind originally, but it makes a certain amount of sense to think that while Romulan ships use a forced quantum singularity, Reman ships might not simply because Remans possess an abundance of material used to build M/ARA reactors.  The idea that the Thalaron generator was a power source as well as a weapon hangs together somewhat better, though, since the reason nobody else builds them in spite of having higher tech levels than the Remans is that they're against international law. It still doesn't explain how the Remans built a ship of that size, technological sophistication, and power without attracting the attention of the authorities, but I don't think you're on the hook for that any more than I am."
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,qx9650,2,Sun Jun 21 19:32:12 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Without more info to flesh out any theories, pure conjecture's where we're at.  We could assume the Remans do use a M/ARA reactor type, but even then dilithium wouldn't be a huge strategic resource just for the consideration of warbird power and propulsion.  If we can conjecture another scenario, perhaps one where the Remans actually significantly lag behind the Federation in power generation (which might explain the Romulans using singularity cores - not for the sake of superior technology but perhaps because that's the only tech they ever fully developed) and use a dilithium reaction similar to what was shown in TOS on the Enterprise, we could further guess that something like a dilithium power generator on a vastly larger scale could power the Scimitar and all its systems.  Could be the huge downside is that it's incapable of long-range interstellar flight and the trip to Earth pushed the Scimitar's range to its limit."

And that could be the primary concern Starfleet has in designing their ships.  Having a fast mobile fleet can be far more effective than a powerful slow one. Having a slower fleet means you have to split your forces more. You have leave more ships behind to defend your territory. It'll take you longer to mass your fleet. You'll have a harder time going after multiple targets. It doesn't matter if you have a bunch of super powerful ships if they can't get to the battlefield fast enough to make a difference or get back home when you get invaded.   Having a fast fleet means you can keep more ships together at the same time since if the enemy attacks your territory, you can send your ships back to defend rather than having to station them back in your territory. You can more easily exploit enemy weaknesses. You can use more of your ships to attack the enemy.  So I think Starfleet designs ships in order to maximize the efficiency of their warp drives. They build ships that can go the fastest based on their size and power. That's likely the biggest flaw with the Defiant. It's a powerful ship but it has problem going fast. That will be a huge detriment when the Federation gets invaded by the Borg since Borg ships are fast. There's no way to position the Defiants to get maximum use out of them. If you put the Defiants at earth, what happens if the Borg decides to invade Vulcan or Tellar and the Defiants can't get there in time? If you spread the Defiants out, then you can't gather enough of them at one place fast enough to make a difference."
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,frezik,5,Sun Jun 21 20:58:55 2015 UTC,One of the advantages of the Defiant-class is that it's small and easily mass produced. It's putting weapons capacity on par with the Galaxy-class into something that can be cranked out in month. It's similar to the Jeep Carriers of WW2 in that regard.   So the solution to its speed problem is to just make more and spread them out.  That's also why the Defiant being on par with a refit Excelsior-class isn't totally warranted. You can build 3-5 Defiants for the original cost of an Excelsior.
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,butterhoscotch,6,Mon Jun 22 04:09:47 2015 UTC,"That is a lot of assumptions regarding cost and build time, for starters."
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,RoundSimbacca,2,Mon Jun 22 08:13:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure. It may cost less to refit an Excelsior than to build a Defiant. However, you can only do so much with old designs that you may end up wanting to build new anyways.  With what DS9 showed us about the survivability of Excelsiors compared to Defiants implies that even with refits, you can only go so far on an outdated platform."
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,KingofMadCows,2,Mon Jun 22 13:52:08 2015 UTC,"Just because the Defiant is small doesn't mean it's easy to mass produce. It is still a very advanced ship that requires a lot of high tech equipment. The quantum torpedoes and ablative armor it uses are clearly not very common. Just saying that they gave the Defiant the weapon capacity of a Galaxy is easy but you can't just strap the guns from a battlecruiser onto a frigate. In order to make the Defiant's weapon on par with the Galaxy class, it would required a lot of miniaturization, that would likely greatly increase the cost of those weapons since you're basically trying to shrink those weapons down to a fraction of their size.  The degree to which the speed problem can be solved by numbers depends on how big the speed gap is. Remember, warp speed scales exponentially. If the Defiant is slower by a significant margin compared to other ships, the numbers needed to make up for that would increase exponentially.  Also, the Excelsior is a 70 year old ship. I would imagine that there's a limit to how much it can be upgraded."
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,frezik,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:07:25 2015 UTC,"Miniaturization is easy when most components can be replicated. All the difficulties are in the initial design. With a requirement to have easily replicatable materials at the project's outset, Star Fleet engineers would favor designs that can be popped out that way.  The Defiant-class was fast enough that the Valiant's mission to circumnavigate the entire Federation was expected to take 3 months (going by the Memory Alpha summary; haven't watched that episode in a while). Its engines are good enough."
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,KingofMadCows,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:07:14 2015 UTC,If miniaturization was easy then they'd be able to fit a Galaxy with many times the amount of weapons and defenses as the Defiant.  It's been stated that the Defiant has problems going above warp 9. The Valiant couldn't even go above warp 6. The highest speed they were able to push the Defiant was warp 9.5.
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,frezik,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:02:01 2015 UTC,"Galaxy-class vessels have a whole bunch of things that can't be miniaturized, such as crew compartments. They're supposed to have a colony evacuation capacity of 15,000 people. I'm sure they'd be quadruple-bunking all the quarters, but there's obviously a lot of empty space on those ships."
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,KingofMadCows,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:19:17 2015 UTC,"What does that have to do with the systems that can be miniaturized? If they're able to shrink the Galaxy's weapons down enough to fit them on the Defiant, then they would be able to fit more of those weapons on the Galaxy. The fact that there are things on the Galaxy that can't be miniaturized is beside the point. The point is that if miniaturization was easy then every ship would benefit. It wouldn't be an advantage exclusive to the Defiant."
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,SStuart,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:00:31 2015 UTC,"I doubt the Defiant had even half the weapons capacity of a Galaxy class. The Galaxy Class not only had much LARGER weapons (a torpedo tube that was basically a rail gun) but also a much deeper power reserve and more ammunition. The Galaxy Class also had many more redundant systems than the Defiant.   In short, the Defiant was an attack ship, the wartime Galaxy was a multi-role capital ship that was designed to fight a sustained battle. We never really saw the Defiant engage large Dominion designs during the war (the Valiant tried, with disastrous results)."
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,disposable_pants,7,Mon Jun 22 17:44:10 2015 UTC,"A numerous fleet comprised of smaller ships has a lot of wartime advantages:   A fleet of small ships offers more tactical options than one large ship.  A fleet can be in multiple places at once, hit a target from multiple angles, and presents multiple targets. Decentralization makes a fleet more resistant to damage than a single ship.  Frequently we see even the largest, most advanced ships in the fleet rendered vulnerable after a few hits when shields/weapons/warp/main power is down.  Multiple ships in a fleet can be completely destroyed while others remain fully functional. Repairs can be conducted more easily when a damaged ship can access resources/personnel from a fully functional one.  If a single ship is left dead in space they are in significant trouble; if a few ships in a fleet are dead in space they already have help nearby. Multiple officers capable of captaining a ship offers valuable redundancy in case one commanding officer is killed or incapacitated. Usually finding many capable captains would be difficult, but in wartime there are already more uniformed personnel available and more opportunities to prove oneself.   Contrast this to how larger single ships are far better suited for a peacetime mission of exploration and friendship:   A fleet of ships arriving above an alien planet might be perceived as an act of war; a single ship (even a large one) will likely come across as less threatening. Larger ships (such as Galaxy and Sovereign class) are better suited to accommodating civilian occupants, which the Federation brings along on exploratory and colonizing missions.  On a smaller ship civilians could easily get in the way (as Jake and Quark have done while on Defiant-class ships) and there doesn't appear to be an option to mass-eject civilians (via saucer separation, for example). Peacetime militaries are smaller organizations and are notorious for stagnant career advancement -- fewer captains, fewer ships.   A smaller fleet of larger ships for peacetime and a larger fleet of smaller ships for wartime makes perfect sense."
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,butterhoscotch,3,Sun Jun 21 22:30:30 2015 UTC,"larger ships can also be more easily refit and modified to fill various roles and can be more flexible. Look at all the problems the enterprise was forced to deal with, disaster relief, vip and prisoner transport, disaster prevention. Most of these missions the defiant could not handle. There are various reasons for all size of ships."
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,SStuart,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:16:12 2015 UTC,"I disagree. A tactical fleet in space would probably be composed of different ships (with different sizes and roles). Larger ships, with much heavier firepower could not only pick off smaller ships, but could also be very useful at targeting objects with heavy shields (i.e. space stations).   An example of this was the DS9 ""Way of the Warrior"" battle, in which the Klingon Flagship used their heavy guns to bring down DS9's massive shields. Smaller ships seemed not to be able to do that.  Larger ships also can serve as command centers, carriers, troop transports, supply ships AND heavy weapon dreadnoughts. It's not a either/or choice."
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,philwelch,23,Mon Jun 22 17:35:41 2015 UTC,"Why would you build a Prometheus or Defiant that's ten times the size when you could build ten Prometheuses or Defiants, have equivalent if not better firepower, and not present a huge target for the enemy to focus their firepower on?  Big ships like the Galaxy class are good for solo exploration, and big warships like the Negh'Var are good for whatever the Klingon psychological equivalent of small penis compensation is, but the real backbone of even the Klingon fleet is the small but powerful Bird of Prey. In war, where you have large fleet actions, megaships are a liability."
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,speedx5xracer,6,Sun Jun 21 21:22:05 2015 UTC,"The Dominion, Romulan Star Empire, and Borg collective all appear to disagree with your assessment of big ships as either a liability or a compensatory measure. The latter two go so far as to make absolutely enormous ships the mainstay of their navies. Even if they suffer from a lower power-density, bigger ships do appear to offer a genuine advantage in shielding and weapon capacity over smaller ships. Take one of the examples I used in my original post, USS Defiant and USS Lakota going at it during Leyton's coup: Lakota's upgrades aside, Defiant is a new ship with newer toys and is more specialized for combat, but Lakota is able to fight to a draw because she's simply bigger and has a bigger reactor. Smaller ships have a consumption advantage, but bigger ships still appear to retain the overall energy production advantage. It's just less efficient.  Big ships also offer capabilities and even entire mission roles that small ships don't, even if they're all strictly warships. Two Defiants might replace a Galaxy-class for firepower, but they don't offer the manufacturing, transporation, medical, maintenance, or electronic warfare capabilities of that ship, they don't offer the flexibility or independent operating ability of the Nebula-class, they don't offer the sprint speed, scanning, or even the sheer firepower and shields of the Sovereign. And remember, on top of all of these militarily-useful capabilities are suites of weapons and shields that are competitive with the dedicated warships of other species.  My point isn't that the Federation needs some huge warship, my point is that the reason they don't build one isn't because they're not valuable, but because they appear to emphasize power and system density as design characteristics for combat starships and that there's a size sweet-spot depending on what characteristics you're going for. If you prefer the characteristics the Federation appears to for strictly combat-oriented starships, the sweet spot looks like it's right around the size of the Prometheus. Based on the size to which other militaries build their capital starships and how we see them perform in large fleet actions each other and smaller ship, though, it seems like the sweet spot for overall firepower and shielding appears to be right around the size of the Galaxy-class, maybe a little smaller. And Starfleet already builds some of the most competitive combat ships in that size bracket, like the Galaxy and Sovereign-classes, they just don't look like warships to us because they stick a bunch of other crap onto them (crap which admittedly often provides substantial military advantage when used off-label), and because Starfleet defines the term ""warship"" very narrowly."

Smaller ships have a consumption advantage, but bigger ships still appear to retain the overall energy production advantage. It's just less efficient.   IIRC the Lakota was fighting to destroy the Defiant from the start of their fight, the Defiant was not. So I wouldnt say the Lakota fought to a draw. The Lakota was able to give the Defiant a run for their money but if the Defiant was willing to destroy the Lakota from the begining the outcome would be vastly different."
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,BuddhasLittleWarlock,7,Sun Jun 21 22:57:57 2015 UTC,I was going to say the same till I read your comment! The Defiant crew was holding back quite a bit not targeting key systems to destroy or disable a fellow Starfleet ship and crew. The Lakota on the other hand was told the Defiant was crewed by Changelings so they were genuinely trying to destroy or stop the Defiant until they learned the truth. By which time the Defiant could have easily destroyed the Lakota.
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,BuddhasLittleWarlock,5,Sun Jun 21 23:14:40 2015 UTC,It's actually a major plot point that Lakota is pulling punches as well; what ends that battle is Benteen's shock and horror when Leyton orders her to destroy Defiant.  http://en.memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Paradise_Lost_(episode)#Act_Five
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,philwelch,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:40:15 2015 UTC,Then how is that argument relevant if both ships were pulling punches?
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,philwelch,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:30:56 2015 UTC,"It essentially means that going all out without using quantum torpedoes (quantum torpedoes are specifically what Leyton orders Benteen to use) or otherwise delivering a killing blow they came out even, suggesting that without using their most powerful weapon systems they were equally matched. Both were in a position to take the kill and declined, similarly implying that the two ships are as equal as matters (they can destroy the other) in terms of their most powerful weapons.  An answer that's not as entirely serious (but maybe not totally incorrect, either) is that in Star Trek being able to disable your opponent is a narrative signifier for decisive advantage, and being unable to disable your foe without having to kill them is the same for parity."
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,IkLms,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:55:14 2015 UTC,"But if both ships could easily destroy each other using Quantum torpedoes, isn't it more about the weapons systems than it is about the size of the ship?

An answer that's not as entirely serious (but maybe not totally incorrect, either) is that in Star Trek being able to disable your opponent is a narrative signifier for decisive advantage, and being unable to disable your foe without having to kill them is the same for parity.

DaystromInstitute,3amiww,Bruce_G,9,Sun Jun 21 23:12:12 2015 UTC,"The bulk of the Dominion fleet is small fighters. The large battleships exist, but they may perform a different role.   The role for which small, numerous, well-armed ships excel is that of fleet-based ship-to-ship combat. In such a setting, a large ship presents a target for the enemy to concentrate firepower on while sacrificing maneuverability and, to some extent, firepower. If you have ten Defiants, you can focus fire on more targets than if you have a 10x as large Sovereign. You can also be in ten different places instead of one.   Larger ships have two advantages. One is that they can have enough power for a single superweapon (cf Scimitar) and another is that they can carry more troops. But in space, troops are useless and superweapon are only worth firing at big megaship targets, so having a larger number of small, dispersed ships is a winning strategy there.   The role of megaships is probably to take planets. The superweapon can scour the surface of the planet as a terror weapon, and the troops can land and assault surface targets. Which explains the Borg cube, since the first two times we see one, its mission is to assimilate the Earth. And which also explains why Starfleet doesn't have these ships; terror and conquest aren't the Federation way."
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,SStuart,3,Sun Jun 21 22:41:01 2015 UTC,"Certainly the Dominion battleships may be multirole vessels, but we see them frequently in pitched fleet action performing the space superiority role, where they're generally portrayed as being pretty effective. Similarly we see the much-less-massive Galaxy-class perform very effectively at bullying smaller, more numerous dedicated warships. The performance of the Romulan Navy is similarly strong, and their entire fleet is composed of ships larger than the Galaxy-class which are apparently designed for space superiority. The notion that large ships don't perform well against fleets of more numerous, smaller vessels simply isn't well supported by the on-screen evidence.  The demonstrated characteristics of small ships like the Defiant-class and Jem'hadar fighters also make them unsuitable for a variety of other military mission roles; they're heavily dependent on fleet support, they're comparatively slow, and they're limited to a single mission role. The Prometheus-class appears to solve these limitations to some extent, but it's hardly a small ship, and she still doesn't provide for other wartime mission roles and support capabilities that you would typically have accompany the fleet.  Finally, I have not yet suggested a ship ten times the size of the Sovereign, nor am I going to. The closest I got was wondering why we don't see a Sovereign-sized ship with similar weapon density to the Prometheus."
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,carnstar,2,Sun Jun 21 23:10:13 2015 UTC,I meant that the Sovereign was about 10x the size of the Defiant.
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,Phreakhead,5,Mon Jun 22 00:45:17 2015 UTC,"Outside of the Borg, they don't disagree with that statement at all. They have a couple very large capital ships but the bulk of their fleet is smaller more agile fighters.  A large capital ship exists because it can transport ground troops, act as a flagship/command and control and possibly for surface bombardments or docking for fighter type craft.  A large fleet of smaller ships has a massive military advantage against a single large Capital ship. They provide more targets to the enemy forcing them to distribute their firepower and allows for outflanking the enemy and/or attacking from multiple directions.  Look at the first meeting of a Galaxy class shit with the Dominion. It was completely destroyed by a fleet of only 3 smaller craft.  Large capital ships are useful in peacetime for power projection and for exploration since sending a fleet is a waste and will come off as hostile. But, in combat a large capital ship is worthless without a fleet surrounding and protecting it.  Compare it even to Naval fleets now. The big Carrier capital ships may indeed be powerful but they are extremely vulnerable and useless without the support a vast number of smaller more agile ships to keep attackers away from them."

Once the Federation fixes its shield problem I don't think we see any Galaxy class ships die on screen (obviously some should be lost, but no evidence I can think of...)

At least one of the Jem Hadar ships should have been destroyed by the Galaxy's weapons. Nonetheless, the Galaxy survived (until being rammed) with most functionality in tact.   That's impressive!"

DaystromInstitute,3amiww,jerslan,5,Sun Jun 21 22:14:10 2015 UTC,"Strangely enough, the warp core doesn't produce the warp field, the warp coils do. For whatever reason the warp core refers to the main reactor."
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,DevilGuy,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:40:29 2015 UTC,"The warp core is not the main reactor.  The warp core uses a dilithium moderated M/AM reaction to generate warp plasma, which is fed to the warp coils, housed in the nacelles, to generate a warp field.  Fusion reactors generate high-energy plasma which is fed into the Electro-Plasma System (EPS), which supplies electrical power throughout the ship. Plasma from the fusion reactors is also fed into the impulse engines as reaction mass for sublight travel."
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,JohnnyGoTime,2,Mon Jun 22 02:33:49 2015 UTC,The M/AM reactor is also tapped at points along the Plasma Transfer Conduit (PTC) to supply energy to the EPS.  The Warp Core or Fusion Reactors can supply main ships power.
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,Shizzlick,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:37:20 2015 UTC,"True, though I suspect it's most likely an emergency bypass as opposed to standard practice. A modern-day analog would be high and low pressure air systems. There's usually a cross connect so HP air can feed the LP system but it's less efficient as the HP air has to be regulated down to the lower system pressure, so each system has its own pumps and the cross connect is only opened when the LP compressor(s) are unavailable.  It could also allow for high power transfers for weapons or shields during combat. Usually when we see combat at warp, the ships are quickly forced to reduce speed."
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,chattymcgee,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:44:30 2015 UTC,"No, it is a standard main power source for the ship.  From the TNG Tech Manual (non-canon).  Standard Cruise Mode dictates the following:   At least one major power system to remain at operational status at all times. At least one additional power system to be maintained at standby. (For example, if the warp engines are currently providing propulsion and power, Cruise Mode operating rules require either the main impulse engines, the Saucer Module impulse engines, or an auxiliary fusion generator to be at standby.)   Also from the Utilities Section:   MAJOR UTILITIES NETWORKS  These utilities distribution networks include:  • Power. Power transmission for onboard systems is accomplished by a network of microwave power transmission waveguides known as the electro plasma system (EPS). Major power supplies derive microwave power from the warp propulsion power conduits and the main impulse engines. Additional feeds draw power from the saucer module impulse engines as well as a number of auxiliary fusion generators. A secondary power distribution system provides electrical power for specialized requirements.   Basically the ship has four sources for main power.  It can use any, or any combination, depending on the particular need at the time."
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,frezik,2,Mon Jun 22 03:52:21 2015 UTC,"Good question, but not one I think we can easily answer with canon information. There are no well-explored examples of ship classes that have multiple powerplants, except maybe the Enterprise in 2009's Star Trek. We don't really know enough about that ship's capabilities to make any really solid judgements about whether it outperforms single core ships, or even whether single core ships are the norm in that reality."
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,Borkton,3,Sun Jun 21 20:14:12 2015 UTC,"I'm on mobile so my apologies for brevity of my answer and any spelling errors or autocorrect substitutions that creep in.  I would say the development of the Saber, Steamrunner, Norway, and Prometheus classes are all direct results of the Defiant program. But not because of the Defiant herself, but two of her major technological innovations: the M-Type Warp Core and Phaser Pulse Cannons.  The M-Type Warp Core is unique to warp cores seen in other ships in that it seems to utilize three seperate and distinct M/A Injection Assemblies. You know those big pulsing tubes made of magnetic constriction segments above and below the reaction chamber? One pushes ionized Deuterium Plasma from the injectors to the Core, the other pushes Antimatter (in this case antihydrogen) to the Core. The M-Type utilized three sets of them pushing to one Core.  This gives them unprecedented control over how much power they generate, and an upper limit unheard of for a Core that size since they're not relying on singular sets of Injectors. Admittedly they're finicky, requiring quite a bit of fine tuning and almost constant maintenance and retuning, but even then, it's a powerful advantage. The  more serious drawback is that Starfleet power distribution technology is still playing catch up. At full power, the M-Type pushes more Electroplasma than the EPS Conduits are designed to channel at any one time.  The aforementioned classes are built larger than the Defiant specifically to fit redundant ECS Conduits to more safely use the M-Type Core Systems.  Then there's the Phaser Pulse Cannons. An unmistakably effective weapon debuted with the Defiant Class. Since it's proven itself, Starfleet couldn't sit on their laurels and let it go to waste. The drawback, however, was that PPCs have a very narrow targeting arc compared to traditional Phaser Strips or even old style Phaser Beam Emitter Points. Meaning any ship that carries them had to be smaller and more nimble to use them properly. Hence why the aforementioned classes are larger than the Defiant (ECS) but smaller and more maneuverable than the big Galaxies or Sovereigns (PPCs).  I would argue that due to the various successes we've seen spread across the Sovereign, Prometheus, and Defiant lines, as well as the Ablative Armor tech and Transphasic Torpedoes brought back by Voyager we'll see yet more mid-size, Multi-Vector capable Starships with focus on maneuverability, armor, and redundant systems leading the charge."
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,butterhoscotch,2,Mon Jun 22 07:13:57 2015 UTC,"Question: Over time, couldn't the PPC's be miniturized to the point where they could fit in a turret-like structure? Even if not effective as offensive weapons, they would be useful for flooding an area with phaser fire to detonate any incoming torpedos before they'd impact the ship/shields."
DaystromInstitute,3amiww,sunnyandtony,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:19:52 2015 UTC,my guess would be that tracking targets effectively at the speeds ships move in star trek (significant fractions of C at impulse) would render any mechanical turret useless.
DaystromInstitute,3an7f5,Kamala_Metamorph,31,Sun Jun 21 21:45:05 2015 UTC,"To me, there's kind of a single idea that's at the heart of most Star Trek races (the whole ""planet of hats"" deal from TVTropes, to a certain extent, is similar). And I don't mean this in the way that you'd say, for example, the Klingons are a race of warriors. I mean there's an emotion at the heart of each of them that informs their actions.  For the Klingons, it's respect. A Klingon will fight to the death if he feels he's been disrespected, and entire wars can end due to one great display of respect (Ent-C, or Undiscovered Country). Get the idea?  For the Cardassians, it's domination. Superiority. This shows up in almost every aspect of them as a race--the authoritarian dictatorship that rules over their people; the way they treat Picard, torturing him in a manner that's unlike anything else seen in the Trek universe; look at how Jellico handles them in the same episode, too. And Dukat, as the primary Cardassian character, absolutely exudes this. He's always out to get the upper hand in every situation. They're often willing to achieve this at any cost, up to and including allowing themselves to become subordinate to the Dominion (I'm sure if you asked Dukat, he'd tell you that was only ever a temporary situation). But where does that arise from? Well, I'd say it's because they worry so much about feeling inferior. They got their butts kicked by the Federation, they were ousted by those lowly Bajorans... that doesn't jive with their cultural ideas of themselves. So there's an increasing desperation to prove that they are as superior as they believe themselves to be, as this harsh military dictatorship taught them they were growing up.  Now, for the Romulans--the core of their species is fear. Paranoia is how it manifests most frequently. They left Vulcan because they feared the changes that Surak's enlightenment would bring. They hide in cloaked ships and watch so that they can never be caught by surprise. Look at the various plots we see them engaged in--""the Defector"", where it's apparently just common to have such tests of loyalty, even at the highest echelons of Romulan society, out of fear of betrayal. This shows up in ""Face of the Enemy"" too, with Toreth assuming Troi is testing her. It takes Geordi a long time to win the Romulan's trust in ""The Enemy"" because he is so fearful of a trap. How does Sisko get them to join the war against the Dominion? He plants evidence that will scare them into action.  Fear also leads the Romulans to making everything tightly controlled. There are eyes everywhere, so you better not act up (a government fearful of rebellion). Romulans employ spies so frequently because it's a way of keeping tabs on threats, much like a cloaking device. They come up with complex and very strictly worded agreements that they expect everyone else to adhere to perfectly, because the consequences of it being broken are so terrifying to them. They consider themselves excused for breaking the same agreement, however, because to them, they're just making sure it's enforced. That's also the same reason they're so quick to jump on every incursion of the neutral zone. It's the interstellar equivalent of shouting ""don't come any closer!"" while cowering in the corner with a stick.  This results in some superficial similarities to the Cardassians--the Cardassians rule with an iron fist to prove that they are better than their subjects, and thus more fit to be the ones in charge in the first place. The Romulans control things so tightly because they're afraid of what might happen if they don't.  Where this gets interesting is that the idea of the ""respectable Romulan adversary,"" that's present from their very first appearance. What often makes these characters respectable is that they're willing to overcome this fear, even if only for a moment. The Romulan Commander in ""Balance of Terror"" is brave enough to reveal himself to Kirk, the first in Romulan history. Admiral Jarok in ""The Defector"" bravely makes a huge sacrifice for what he sees as the good of his people (and yet this is still somewhat motivated by fear--fear of what losing could mean to the Romulans). The Romulan Commander in ""The Chase"" extends a small olive branch of hope, very quietly, to Picard; he knows that talking to the enemy like this is a dangerous thing to do, and yet he has a moment of courage in that fear that enables him to do it. R'Mor from ""Eye of the Needle"" is scared of the possible consequences from beaming a Voyager member aboard, but he bravely volunteers himself as the first test subject instead.  I would posit that the Romulans are on the verge of overcoming this trait. Where that would leave them, I'm not sure; I think without fear, the next overriding emotion would be passion. Might the Romulans, in whatever iteration of Trek we see next, be a race of passionate artists and scientists instead? who knows."
DaystromInstitute,3an7f5,RetroPhaseShift,11,Mon Jun 22 05:13:18 2015 UTC,"This jives very nicely with my own personal ""head cannon"" about the Romulans, which is very much influenced by the novels ""My Enemy, My Ally"" and ""The Romulan Way.""  The later goes into great detail about ancient Vulcan history and the Romulan exodus from Vulcan.    In short, Vulcan's first contact with an alien race was disastrous. Aliens appeared proclaiming peaceful intentions, which was a ruse for a war of conquest.  Vulcan fought them off after a bitter war, and afterward began to embrace the teachings of Surak.  The Vulcans who were most traumatized by the war could not embrace pacifism, and decided to leave in a fleet of 12 sub-light generation ships, 4 of which made it to Romulus & Remus after centuries of travel at relativistic speeds, meaning that Vulcan ""aged"" at a much faster rate, and that Ancient Vulcan is not as far in the past for modern Romulans."

Where that would leave them, I'm not sure; I think without fear, the next overriding emotion would be passion. Might the Romulans, in whatever iteration of Trek we see next, be a race of passionate artists and scientists instead? who knows.   Unless I'm forgetting something, most recently in the timeline, Sisko solidified an alliance with the Romulans. Based on this information, if there was another Star Trek series made around now, which would be about 15 years after the events of Voyager, might it be possible that a Romulan joins the crew? I think that would make for a fascinating character, someone highly distrusting, lacking at diplomacy but excelling at stealth and guerrilla warfare. We don't have that insight into the Romulan mindset. And it would be cool for a relatively weak federation ship the series would follow to be outfitted with their stealth technology, to see a federation ship have some Romulan influences in its design and function.  I also want to know the deal with the boxy clothes. Is it purely a fashion thing, it is supposed to hint at a peculiar anatomical trait of shoulder things? If a Romulan wore a Federation uniform, would it hold that shape? It's really the main differentiating feature from the Vulcans.   I have also thought, with their appearance, and fashion, and general level of threat as a hateful but inferior power, that the Romulans are quite similar to North Korea. This could probably become a deep discussion of its own, but it's not an observation I have explored thoroughly."
DaystromInstitute,3an7f5,lergerhs,9,Mon Jun 22 23:17:51 2015 UTC,"The last we see of the Romulans  in the prime timeline is in Nemesis, and there is indeed the implication of detente, in an attempt to close out the TNG movies in a similar manner to the TOS movies. Of course, 09 has Romulus destroyed, which is a whole other ballgame. I do agree that a Romulan main character would be fascinating. I always found it such a waste that DS9 did away with the Romulan operating the cloak thing so quickly.  As far as the fashion goes, I believe the wide shoulders are an attempt at projecting confidence and intimidation. It makes them look very broad and strong, stronger than they are (although if they're anything like Vulcans, that's still rather formidable). Especially so on viewscreens, which seem to be the main way of communicating with enemies. It's another way of trying to hide their fear.  I would say the Cardassians are more like North Korea than the Romulans are. The Romulans are capable of participating in the intergalactic politics at the same level as the Federation and the Klingons, but the Cardassians just aren't. Every time they confront one of the other powers they're beaten. The level of control and superiority they preach are more in line with the whole ""best Korea"" deal. And yes, I realize that's a joke, but it gets the point across well. They want everyone to believe they are powerful enough to take on South Korea and too proud for anything less, but we all know that if they ever tried anything,  it'd be proven wrong quite quickly. There's also that whole aspect of poverty and going hungry that's present in Cardassia but not Romulus. The average Romulan, from what we see of them, leads a decent life. The average Cardassian? Not so much, just like North Korea. Cardassia also seems pretty devoid of natural resources,  for whatever reason, which also parallels North Korea quite well."
DaystromInstitute,3an7f5,RetroPhaseShift,4,Tue Jun 23 00:21:58 2015 UTC,"In the Beta canon novels, the Romulans are moving towards detente.   The events of Nemesis started a cycle of internecine political bloodletting among the elites that culminated in a wholesale displacement of the prior political elite. The new Romulan regime ended up being dominated by moderate pragmatists who were terrified by the past events and just wanted a normal life, even peace. Space is divided into two blocs, the Romulans being first among equals in their Typhon Pact bloc, but the Romulan government has consistently acted as a moderate power. Federation-Romulan detente is now openly talked about.  The consequences post-Nemesis have not been discussed. The general sentiment I have gotten from the authors at Trek BBS is that they would not favour destroying the entire civilization with its home world, and that indeed they see no reason why expansive starfarers like the Romulans would be destroyed if their homeworld was lost."
DaystromInstitute,3an7f5,RandyFMcDonald,3,Tue Jun 23 00:39:32 2015 UTC,"The Romulan Commander in ""The Chase"" extends a small olive branch of hope, very quietly, to Picard   I always thought he was fishing for info about reunification dissidents.  Get Picard talking, see if he'll name names or give up some useful info.  That's why Picard's short response was appropriate."
DaystromInstitute,3an7f5,Sorryaboutthat1time,5,Tue Jun 23 23:09:45 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I never once got the feeling he was anything less than sincere. There's no reason to think it's related to reunification really, as that's not relevant to the episode at all. But the setup for their conversation is that Picard is lamenting the apparent fruitlessness of the discovery. A message of peace from their common ancestors that the Alpha Quadrant species are still too immature to appreciate. And at that moment, he receives a communication that indicates that perhaps the message didn't fall on entirely deaf ears after all.  Edit: The conversation itself is below:   ""It would seem that we are not completely dissimilar after all; in our hopes, or in our fears.""  ""Yes...""  ""Well then perhaps, one day...""  ""...one day...""    It's a ""between-the-lines"" sort of moment. He's definitely not getting any info out of this. If anything, it puts him at risk, because it could be interpreted that he's sympathetic to reunification."
DaystromInstitute,3an7f5,RetroPhaseShift,11,Wed Jun 24 03:47:03 2015 UTC,"I think the crucial difference between the Cardassian Union and Romulan Star Empire is that the former is explicitly expansionist and imperialist in its methods and goals, while the latter is more isolationist.  The Romulans, even in TNG, seem to be largely unconcerned with the Federation beyond seeing it as a potential threat. They don't invade the Neutral Zone, they don't seem to be focused on conquest or even control of the Federation -- indeed, the only time we really see an aggressive Romulan plot is in ""The Defector"" (one of my favorite TNG episodes, btw), and it turns out all to be a ploy to test Admiral Jarok and then (perhaps merely as a secondary objective) to capture the Enterprise. Even the relatively successful attack in ""Balance of Terror"" can really only be described as a probing attack against Starfleet's defenses.  On the other hand, we do know that the Romulans and Klingons fight frequent and bloody wars against one another (""Birthright"" talks about this, and it's certainly hinted at elsewhere), so perhaps there's a more explicit plan for conquest against the Klingons, but it could as easily go the other way (presumably a war between the two powers hasn't been fought since the Federation and Klingon Empire cemented their alliance).  I think it's interesting that the Cardassian Central Command views deception and subterfuge unfavorably, while at the same time the Obsidian Order was described as being even more skilled than the Tal Shiar. The Romulan military certainly seems to be more tricksy than the Cardassian military did (that's not to say that the Central Command didn't lie or whatever, but they didn't seem to employ intricate plots like the Romulan admirals in ""The Defector"" or ""Data's Day"" did).  There's also some indication that the Cardassian government is less stable than that of the Romulan Star Empire. Probably the best example of this is in ""Chain of Command"" where Gul Madred describes growing up on the streets, but seems to imply that this was a thing of the past corrected by the current military government. In any case, the Detapa Council's assertion of power post-""The Way of the Warrior"" doesn't seem to be a particularly surprising thing to anyone, and so it's perhaps an indication that frequent changes of power are expected on Cardassia, if only between military leaders, civilian authorities, and possibly the security services.  In contrast, the description of the Romulan Star Empire seems to be pretty much based on a well-balanced assembly of power in the Romulan Senate. The Senate evidently controls basically everything, even the Tal Shiar, which is different from the virtual autonomy displayed by the Obsidian Order.  It's hard to say much more about the Romulans than that, because we haven't gotten nearly as much (canon) information about them than we did the Cardassians."
DaystromInstitute,3an7f5,zuludown888,9,Sun Jun 21 22:47:18 2015 UTC,"Those are great distinctions on how the Romulan and Cardassian Empires are different.    On the other hand, we do know that the Romulans and Klingons fight frequent and bloody wars against one another (""Birthright"" talks about this, and it's certainly hinted at elsewhere), so perhaps there's a more explicit plan for conquest against the Klingons, but it could as easily go the other way (presumably a war between the two powers hasn't been fought since the Federation and Klingon Empire cemented their alliance).   I'd always assumed that the Romulans largely left the Federation alone because they knew with 99% certainty that the Federation had no intentions of military conquest. Their confrontations with the Klingons, however, made perfect sense. The Klingons' desire for combat and the spoils of war would only be kept in check by a large and powerful Romulan military.   Who do the Cardassians really have to worry about? We know for certain that they do share a border with the Federation, and possibly the Breen. We know that technologically they're absolutely inferior to both the Federation and the Klingons. In the TNG episode The Wounded a Galor class starship opens fire on the Enterprise-D. Rather than taking it seriously, Picard and Riker seem mildly bothered by the attack. Picard even tells the Gull that should the two ships engage in combat, the Galor-class vessel would be badly outmatched. In the same episode, we see the Phoenix run through vessel after vessel with impunity. In the DS9 episode The Way of the Warrior we see 1/3 of the Klingon Defense Force bring the Cardassian Union to it's knees in less than a week. Even the Klingon Empire seems technologically superior to the Cardassians.   The Cardassians don't have the military might of the Romulan Empire. They had to give the Obsidian Order more latitude to conduct their affairs - it was the only way to let them compete in the realm of the bigger more powerful Empires."

I think the question of why the Cardassians and Romulans would view the Federation as a threat is an interesting one.  The Federation, from what we can see, is aggressively expansionist. Now that expansion is always portrayed as peaceful (and we have no reason to believe that it is anything but entirely peaceful), but nonetheless the Federation seems to constantly be (1) sending its vessels further into deep space, away from its borders and (2) colonizing further and further from its core worlds. It is also culturally at odds with virtually all its neighbors, preaching an ideology of freedom and individual rights that is totally different from those of most of the societies it encounters.  So I think, faced with that, it's entirely reasonable for the leaders of these authoritarian societies to see the Federation as something of a threat. And if they're guilty of projecting their own reasoning upon the Federation, then they'll think that the Federation is unwilling to make many accommodations for them (in that sense, the alliance between the Federation and the Klingons is something of a minor miracle, and it may be why it seems to have taken so long for a real alliance to take hold after the events of Star Trek VI).  So even if it isn't objectively rational for the Romulans or the Cardassians to fear Federation conquest, I can see why they do fear it.   The Cardassians don't have the military might of the Romulan Empire. They had to give the Obsidian Order more latitude to conduct their affairs - it was the only way to let them compete in the realm of the bigger more powerful Empires.    I think it's also pretty clear from DS9 that the Cardassian Union is pretty small, by interstellar empire standards (though to be fair, DS9 seems to subscribe to a view that the Federation is much smaller than the description Picard gives in First Contact). Bajor and Cardassia seem to be within a few light years of one another, for instance. I think this also kind of colors their relations with the Federation, who seem to be much larger (and yet the Federation insists on colonizing worlds in Cardassia's backyard).   So, yeah, it seems that the Cardassians aren't really in the same league as the Federation/Klingons/Romulans. If those are the ""Great Powers"" of the Alpha and Beta Quadrants (that we've seen), then Cardassia is in a lower grouping -- a regional power that is able to challenge the Federation for dominance in its small sphere of space, but which couldn't hope to rival the Federation in influence anywhere else.  Presumably the alliance with the Dominion significantly improved Cardassian technology, at least in the military realm.  This does raise the interesting question of how exactly the borders of Star Trek's local space really fits together. Like I said, in DS9 at least it seems to be pretty closely-packed."

Small compared to the Federation or Klingon Empire, sure, but I think they were still fairly large. We're given the sense that the Cardassian Union occupies a very large volume when Thomas Riker stole the defiant and took it to the Orias system. The Cardassian Union appears to occupy many systems and has a fairly large fleet, though that fleet does appear to be technologically inferior."

I'd say it's the opposite. Riker is able to reach Orias (probably not right on the Federation border, where Starfleet could get a good look at it via subspace telescope) in a matter of hours. At most, a few days pass in the course of ""Defiant."" Even at maximum warp, you're looking at it taking days to make it to a star system that is more than a few light years away.  It's possible that the Cardassian empire is a lot like the Russian Empire, with the capital right up next to the frontier (Bajor perhaps being the baltic nations in this analogy) and vast areas of space occupying its ""Siberia,"" though."
DaystromInstitute,3an7f5,zuludown888,2,Mon Jun 22 03:53:43 2015 UTC,It certainly sounds plausible.
DaystromInstitute,3an7f5,TooMuchButtHair,3,Mon Jun 22 04:10:12 2015 UTC,"the keldon class was already being built before the dominion alliance, a signifigant leap forward for the cardassians, able to take down galaxy class ships and other ships on that tier.  When this ship appears, galor class ships change in role to support ships which attack in squadrons of 3.   This shows how the active the cardassians are in developing military technology and what a priority it is for them. the federation gains an advantage for several years in technology, with the launch of the galaxy and nebula class's they have ships that can knock around cardassian ships if they are in equal numbers (note how in chain of command the fleet of cardassian ships is significantly large in numbers)  And then the cardassians launch a newer more powerful ship, and reorganize their fleet around it. With their new ship they can fire a beam that can punch a hole right through a galaxy class ship, while being supported by smaller galor gunships or destroyers if you will.  That shows more aggressive military think then the federation ever does, a dedication to gaining the upper hand and competing militarily and advancing their technology at an impressive rate (although for all we know they stole it)  This very single minded dedication, which allows them to compete just barely with larger empires, is also what causes their empire to collapse partially.   The complete dedication of resources to the military industrial complex causes their people to starve, which causes a revolution (before the dominion takes over). Their dedication to becoming an expansionist empire reminds me of japan in world war 2. They put every thing they have into it, trying to become an imperial super power at the cost of nearly everything else, until they start a war they cant win."
DaystromInstitute,3an7f5,butterhoscotch,5,Mon Jun 22 04:52:29 2015 UTC,We've never seen a Keldon take down a Galaxy Class.... The Galaxy Class seems to be far superior to anything the Cardassians have in their fleet.
DaystromInstitute,3an7f5,SStuart,3,Mon Jun 22 18:28:29 2015 UTC,"What is presumably a keldon blows a nice clean whole through a miranda class pretty easily, unless its a weaker ship firing but i dont see how that betters your argument. I consider that cruiser to be on that tier, or near it at least. Maybe a little weaker but if it can do that to a miranda it can probably do the same to a galaxy. The Orbital weapons platforms, using cardassian tech also butcher the allied fleet, so I cant believe their tech is so obsolete that its impossible."
DaystromInstitute,3an7f5,butterhoscotch,3,Mon Jun 22 22:46:16 2015 UTC,"Worth noting that what we see of battle scenes are bits and pieces of chaos, and pretty much every shot shows a ship with it's shields already down. With so much stuff going on that wasn't shown, I don't think we can draw any conclusions about the quality of this or that class of ship from those scenes.   The weapons platforms, of course, are an entirely different matter. It's pretty clear from the dialogue that they are formidable weapons, with the obvious flaw that they can't really move around."
DaystromInstitute,3an7f5,williams_482,3,Tue Jun 23 04:29:35 2015 UTC,"What happened in the wounded is not an accurate depiction of how the cardassians fared later on during the war, blowing holes through federation battleships.  Even at the time of the events of wounded, it may not be a fair depiction of their abilities. the war with the federation had only ended one year prior, or put another way just a 2 or 3 years after the galaxy class launched.  its possible the federation was able to advance their technology briefly. What we do know is that the cardassians were considered a threat, either through numbers, talent or technology the federation feared them. It is somewhat common knowledge that caradassian tech is slightly behind the federation, but not so much that they are not a threat as a space faring empire."

The Romulans are a people that came into existence when driven (almost certainly in great numbers) from their homeworld by violent fascists. Vulcans live longer than humans as well, so the resentment and need for vengeance was probably passed down from the original victims to multiple generations pretty easily. The Federation might have been pragmatic and recognized that the Romulans weren't gunning for the entire group when they went after Vulcan."
DaystromInstitute,3an7f5,Mirror_Sybok,3,Mon Jun 22 05:18:12 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call that really aggressive in terms of gathering territory or attacking the federation. At most, they killed and replaced a Federation ambassador. Evil, to be sure, but not exactly expansionist."

Admiral Valdore even says that he was led away from the Senate when he ""questioned"" conquest as the goal above all else.

DaystromInstitute,3an7f5,SStuart,6,Mon Jun 22 18:22:18 2015 UTC,"It seems that Romulans have a lot of freedom. You can do whatever you like so long as those freedoms do not interfere with the government. Romulans are loyal people. So the need to crack down and oppress their people in a totalitarian dictatorship like the Cardassian Union is not needed. So the Tal Shiar can be put on offence instead of oppressing their own people. Which leads me to the next idea.  Since Romulan spies are needed as much to oppress their people, the can put them to work on their neighbors. To do what? In order to tear them down from the inside. So they send their spies to support terrorist groups and guerrilla movements. Basically they try to create confusion and chaos within their neighbors. Once the Romulans think that they neighbor is in trouble, they do something to test their neighbor's resolve. Something like the Balance of Terror. Where if the neighbor  show weakness, its time for war. They conquer their opponent. Consolidate. Regroup. And do it again. Rinse, wash, repeat.  If they can't undermine or conquer their neighbor like the Federation or Klingon Empire, they try to keep them off balance so they don't attack the Romulan Empire. For example, its very likely that they keep the different houses in the Klingon Empire fighting each other so they don't unify and attack the Romulans.  The reason the Romulans are secretive is because they want to keep their true strength a secret. Which implies that they are weak. Because if they were truly powerful, they would flaunt it. But they don't. If knowledge is power, to be unknown is to be unconquerable. Best to create the illusion of incredible power in order to intimidate potential attackers. A society closed to outsiders make it hard to gauge what is going on in the Star Empire."

Which implies that they are weak. Because if they were truly powerful, they would flaunt it. But they don't. If knowledge is power, to be unknown is to be unconquerable.   This is a fallacious argument. There is still a tactical advantage to be had hiding your true strength even if you are very powerful. It keeps your enemy guessing and wary in approaching you, rather than having good intelligence on your forces so they can devise ways to counter them. Subterfuge and wars by proxy can be effective strategies in and of themselves, rather than open military conflict in order to conquer another power on par with yours. This is in line with the Romulan MO we have seen throughout the series.   Second of all, it seems to me it was always heavily implied the Romulans could go tit for tat with the Federation, it's also worth noting we do not have strong evidence pointing toward them being weak. In fact, the Romulans entering the Dominion war resulted in the alliance being able to go on the offensive for the first time. This is mentioned on screen, not to mention the Romulan fleet being present in every major engagement on screen after they entered the war."
DaystromInstitute,3an7f5,geniusgrunt,2,Mon Jun 22 05:34:48 2015 UTC,"The reason I believe the Romulans are weak is because in the TOS they did not have WARP drive. Scotty told Captain Kirk that the Romulans have simple WARP. We can out run them. Romulans came late to WARP. They got it only have a tech exchange with the Klingons.   By having WARP drive, the Klingons and Federation can expand far and wide. Not the Romulans. They had to creep thru space at sub light speed. So that means that the Star Empire is the small empire. A small empire means fewer people, smaller economy, basically less resources. Which translate to a smaller military. The Romulans can beat their chest and saber rattle. But then they will look like a chihuahua. Better to keep a potential opponent in the dark about your true strength."
DaystromInstitute,3an7f5,General_Fear,5,Mon Jun 22 23:35:27 2015 UTC,"It is hard to imagine that Enterprise era Romulans would have been a credible threat to Earth and their allies without having warp drive, never mind fighting them to a standstill. It would have taken them years, possibly decades, to send fleets from Romulus to earth, with NX class starships making warp speed hit-and-run attacks on them the whole time.   The Romulan warbird in Balance of Terror was essentially a test bed for a new plasma torpedo. It's quite possible they didn't have a particularly fast warp drive, but I don't think there is any doubt that they had one. How else would they get across the neutral zone or between federation outposts in a reasonable amount of time?   TOS has a lot of strange inconsistencies when it comes to how warp and impulse speeds are portrayed, with numerous references to ships moving at ""high warp"" towards a stationary ship at speeds obviously well below the speed of light (Elaan of Troyius is a textbook example of this), or ships without warp drive covering huge distances. I think any discussion of ship speeds in TOS needs to be examined very carefully before any definitive conclusions can be drawn."
DaystromInstitute,3an7f5,williams_482,2,Tue Jun 23 04:51:33 2015 UTC,"Thanks everyone. I learned a lot about Romulans today. I also find it interesting that, despite the lack canon Romulan stories... we mention the novels more than we mention Nemesis and ARU Star Trek 09 ! Hell, we discuss Cardassians more than we discuss the movies.   Not complaining. Just an observation. (If you felt the need to correct this imbalance, feel free to make a top-level comment.)"
DaystromInstitute,3an7f5,adamkotsko,4,Tue Jun 23 07:34:12 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the only truly good Romulan episode is ""Balance of Terror,"" though ""The Enterprise Incident"" is pretty good for a season 3 TOS episode. After that, it seems to me, almost every plot in which the Romulans are involved is utter nonsense. The interesting thing about them is that they're evil Vulcans, but TNG-era Trek never does anything with that aspect except for the ill-conceived ""Reunification"" plot that was basically an excuse to get Leonard Nimoy on screen. From alternate timeline Tasha Yar's Romulan daughter all the way through to Nemesis, the film so bad it nearly killed the franchise, the writers haven't known what to do with the Romulans and so they have apparently decided to hang every half-baked and ridiculous plot idea on them. There's basically no reason for them to exist -- the Klingons and Cardassians are the same kind of thing, but so much better done."
DaystromInstitute,3an7f5,velocicopter,4,Sun Jun 21 22:52:46 2015 UTC,"It's funny, because I always sort of viewed the Romulans as a kind of ""cornerstone"" race in Star Trek, along with humans, Klingons and Vulcans, but they really are quite underused. Towards the end of TNG, and obviously throughout DS9, it becomes apparent that the writers just fell in love with the Cardassians more, and fleshed them out more then they ever did with the Romulans. The Romulans barely even make any impact in the original films, and don't even get top-billing until Nemesis. For one of the series original and somehow most memorable antagonists, they really are under-utilized throughout the franchise. It almost lends an air of mystique to the species, which sort of makes sense canonically, but I think, as you said, the simple fact is that nobody really knew what the hell to do with them."
DaystromInstitute,3an7f5,butterhoscotch,5,Mon Jun 22 21:47:04 2015 UTC,I think they feared over using the romulans and making them less interesting and wanted to keep them in the shadows as a surprise foe perhaps. Look at what happened to the borg.

While individually, a fighter usually does not have the firepower to effectively threaten a capital ship, en masse they can. In addition, they can deliver point-blank pinpoint firepower on weaknesses a starship might be unable to exploit. They can also provide a distraction to enemy gunners - shots fired at fighters are not shots fired at starships - and can keep an enemy from simply draining power from an unthreatened shield into ones friendly starships are shooting at."

I would argue that an automated system, even a reconfigured EMH program, wouldn't have the same intuition and instincts of an organic pilot. As far as remote operations go, that's a risky proposition. A powerful enough jamming signal from the enemy ships and those communications links are gone and your fighters are useless. An emergency transport system and an emergency EV suit would allow a pilot to abandon a stricken fighter in combat and survive through to SAR operations, either by the mothership after combat operations were over or during combat by shuttlecraft."

Operating in complex combat situations requires an AI, and with an AI come certain risks, especially when you start equipping them with powerful weapons and shields.   I suppose signals used to remote control drones would be to easily blocked by the enemy ? We often see communications blackouts in Dominion battles. Even worse, they could turn the drones around and use them against the Federation."

After a certain point in order to get more weapon hardpoints you need additional craft. It's more cost effective throw weight to construction time to build fighter craft.  Does a fighter have enough punch to break through shields? Probably not. That's typically why they operate in wings of multiple craft. Also they can exploit gaps in shielding. Full power to starboard shields because that's where the galaxy/defiant class ships are? Fighter wings attack from the port side.

Conversely, nothing was able to break the first Ironsides. Cannonballs would just bounce off.   So where do Star Trek's capital ships fit into that? It doesn't seem like fighters could carry enough big torpedoes to break a large ship's shields. They might be useful against other fighters, but once one side's fighters have won, they can only buzz around. No true superiority has been achieved, so the effect is no different than keeping them all at home.   They would be put to much better use doing U-boat style harassment of enemy logistics. That forces the enemy to expend disproportionate resources protecting their supply lines."

My beef is, sure the mines might have replicators, but where are they getting the raw materials? Starships have recycling and ram scoops, but a mine is only going to have what replicator matter it carries expressly for the purpose of replicating its neighbor. It could have a lot, but it can still be depleted by a wide spread phaser beam or enough torpedo spreads to detonate the mines over and over until there is nothing left with which to replicate.  You may be thinking, maybe the mines also have transporters or tractor beams  so they can collect the old debris. Maybe they do, but a lot of shrapnel and raw replicator matter is going to fly off at high speeds and will be uncollectable. Even if it's just a little bit that gets away, the replicators still offer diminishing returns which could cheaply be run down to zero by an enemy with phasers."

They were designed to take parts of destroyed starships as replacement matter, and given that a typical battle cruiser is going to have a lot more mass than a thin curtain of mines they don't even need to collect all that much to break even."
DaystromInstitute,3akibp,williams_482,4,Mon Jun 22 22:31:00 2015 UTC,"A long range torpedo would be far safer. A torpedo is already a drone. Its a suicidal drone programmed to fly a kamikaze mission. A long range torpedo is the same torpedo with more fuel stored onboard.  There's no limit to how far a long range torpedo can be fired from. It all depends on how big you're willing to make the long range torpedo. The bigger it is the more fuel and more powerful engines it has. At no point does a person need to directly pilot it. Computers are more than capable of doing all of the flying.  These long range torpedoes, or cruise torpedoes, could be built one of two ways. Either build them very big, with huge warheads and also defensive systems (shield generators and phaser banks) or build them small and cheap and rely on sheer numbers to get through to their target.  In an era of FTL sensors and directed energy weapons that travel at the speed of light there's no point in making a manned fighter. They're doomed. The only limiting factor is how fast the defending point defense system can fire. Every shot is a kill shot.  Swarms of long range torpedoes would be the way to go."
DaystromInstitute,3akibp,Hyndis,2,Sun Jun 21 10:05:41 2015 UTC,"photon torpedos are also far more likely to impact, making the option even more attractive.    At this time, fighters also have a huge advantage in survival. If properly used, either in large numbers to swarm or in a direct unit with a larger ship. If they shift their fire to the fighters, or too much fire on the fighters, the large ship will obliterate them.  If they ignore the fighters and take on the large ship, the fighters will blow them away.  Now add intelligent designs to the fighters. Give them shields that can take a destroyers phaser blast or disruptor volley and give them phasers on par with a destroyer.  Now you have a serious threat that is not a death trap. Its high risk, high reward. People will volunteer for it. Right now ships arent even designed to defend against them. Add in stealth technology to make them difficult to target and sensor jamming or prioritize them in an attack and they actually become very survivable.  This is why is said depending on tactics they dont need to be death traps, but sisko used them very recklessly."

DaystromInstitute,3akibp,frezik,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:01:51 2015 UTC,"Fighters are obsoleted in Star Trek, unless when they are akin to the raiders that the Maquis used against small cargo ships.    In a large battle against capital ships, fighters are useless.  The main phaser bank can lock on to a quickly moving spacecraft and vaporize it, just like the Enterprise did with the sentry ships in the episode with Macduff and the lost memories.    This is because there are two distinct technologies at play here.  Very fast photo torpedoes that are nearly impossible to destroy en route and phasers that have a ""bullet"" velocity of the speed of light.  If you are aiming a phaser at a moving target, you don't have to lead the target.    These two innovations make a bomber's effectiveness against a capital ship negligible.  The small craft cannot produce enough energy to shield itself from enemy phaser or disruptor fire, it could take longer for its payload to reach the enemy ship than if launched with a photon torpedo launcher on a ship, and can't pack the punch of a scout class vessel like a small bird of prey or runabout."
DaystromInstitute,3akibp,thesynod,9,Mon Jun 22 14:31:54 2015 UTC,"I personally subscribe to the school of thought that says space combat is really should really only be left to large ships.   That being said, I think that the fighter craft in trek are just shuttles with advanced weapons and engines. They most likely are deployed to attack from a different side or their pinpoint accuracy, as others have stated. I could see these fighters being deployed after an enemy ship's shielding had gone down, targeting vital areas like a sensor, compared to larger ships really only firing on engines/nacelles and the hull.   The fighters might also fill an empty atmospheric niche in starfleet. We see Klingons ships able to go into atmosphere for bombing runs, but we rarely see starfleet do the same. Most atmospheric action uses the shuttlecraft.  But assuming all in-universe usage is the same as what we see on screen during the dominion war, yeah they're deathtraps."
DaystromInstitute,3akibp,nikchi,4,Sun Jun 21 07:12:12 2015 UTC,"The fighters might also fill an empty atmospheric niche in starfleet. We see Klingons ships able to go into atmosphere for bombing runs, but we rarely see starfleet do the same. Most atmospheric action uses the shuttlecraft.   Transporting stuff down to the surface of a planet with a shuttle is a valuable ability. Sometimes transporters don't work, either due to some weird space anomalies or due to a transporter scattering field someone's put up to keep uninvited guests away.  Close air support can be done from orbit. A starship's sensors and weapons are both accurate enough to pinpoint and fire upon exact targets even from orbit. Any starship allowed to linger in orbit long enough to do a detailed sensor scan will be able to wipe out any hostiles on the ground with impunity. This is why space superiority is so critical. During battles such as the Siege of AR-558 space superiority was contested. Had the USS Defiant been able to remain in orbit the Jem'Hadar would have been easily wiped out. Unfortunately Defiant was chased away by Jem'Hadar ships. Neither side could establish orbital superiority to provide fire on the ground.  Atmospheric shuttles might have been able to help, but these shuttles could only hope to operate if the skies above were friendly. Hostile starships in orbit could shoot down these shuttles with ease. And since you already need a friendly ship in orbit to secure the skies in the first place, shuttles aren't needed for close air support. Let the starship securing orbit handle that."
DaystromInstitute,3akibp,Hyndis,3,Sun Jun 21 10:11:15 2015 UTC,"I agree that large ships seem to be much more effective when facing other large ships. However, from a cost perspective it is a lot cheaper to produce a number of small vessels compared to a large starship. In some situations they will suffice, especially when facing lower technology ships. And when deployed in large numbers even small, low technology ships can overpower a starship.   For example Voyager suffered heavy damage from continious strikes made by patrol ships when crossing Kazon-Nistrim space saving Chakotay's baby.   Another instance is where Voyager faces the Swarm and faces almost immediate defeat if it were not for a flaw in their ship design."
DaystromInstitute,3akibp,ablitsm,3,Sun Jun 21 10:55:52 2015 UTC,"It's important to keep in mind that in an era of industrial replicators, by far the most expensive part of a starship is it's crew.

DaystromInstitute,3akibp,williams_482,6,Sun Jun 21 15:54:17 2015 UTC,"Well, I always thought it was an obvious thing to have, if you had a purpose built fighter with several quantum torpedoes and decent shielding, a Galaxy Class could easily become a carrier.   As for the Cannon reason they would build and then field such a worthless fighter? Easy answer is they didn't. The Starfleet fighter  started life as a cargo vessel. It wasn't meant to be a fighter and was only retrofitted into a fighter by the Maquis. They were then used to great effect against the Cardassians. Starfleet then decided to continue on with the refit model and adopted it into their mainstay forces. The reasons for this I think are twofold:  While in a conventional battle they're overpowered by Cardassian ships, the Maquis showed that the Cardassians don't adapt well to unconventional tactics. We never see them put to that use but I wouldn't be surprised if they were and a bulk of the dominions forces are Cardassian ships.  2nd and most importantly, Starfleet doesn't have any choice. Their shipyards are destroyed, they're losing planets and resources, why not strap some weapons onto them and see what happens? Reinlist Locarno and let him go nuts."
DaystromInstitute,3akibp,darthboolean,3,Sun Jun 21 07:31:04 2015 UTC,"I've said it several times before about the Galaxy class becoming a carrier in wartime.  If you look at Rick Sternbach's blueprints, the Galaxy carries a ridiculous number of shuttlecraft and has absolutely massive hangar space.  Replace those dinky Type V personnel shuttles with Runabouts and Peregrines and you could easily have 20+ fighters.  That's a legitimate fleet right there.  If they launched those for escort every time they went into the Neutral Zone the Romulans wouldn't fuck with them.  And I don't know about the Peregrines, which seemed basically unshielded every time we saw them, but Runabouts can take several direct hits from capital ships and keep right on flying, plus they can be outfitted with torpedo launchers and respectable phasers, and are warp-capable if their mothership is destroyed.  And let's not forget that every starship bigger than Defiant has a shuttlebay big enough to carry at least a few fighters.  Screw the dinky personnel shuttles on front-line starships, seriously.  Runabouts have plenty of cargo space, crew quarters, Warp 4+, weapons, and shields.  Every starship not relegated to ferrying admirals and dignitaries between the core planets should have a few for emergencies.    Reinlist Locarno and let him go nuts.     I have a theory that Locarno was a pseudonym to avoid association with his father, Admiral Paris, and sometime after that Academy incident is when he was found out and went back to going by Tom Paris.

Let the big ships draw fire, keep emissions low, aim for getting in past the enemy shield as the big ships deal their damage. Now you have a directed pulse phased within their shield.

DaystromInstitute,3akibp,BloodBride,3,Sun Jun 21 09:17:11 2015 UTC,"there are various tactics they can use with fighters, we really didnt see any"
DaystromInstitute,3akibp,butterhoscotch,8,Mon Jun 22 08:30:34 2015 UTC,"I think there were fighters partly because Starfleet was so overwhelmed by the Dominion that they were putting every ship they could into the war.  Also, they may have underestimated how much the Dominion was able to upgrade the Cardassian ships. It's been shown many times that Cardassian ships are far inferior to Federation ones and that the Maquis were able to cripple them with shuttles."
DaystromInstitute,3akibp,KingofMadCows,2,Sun Jun 21 06:19:35 2015 UTC,"I get the impression that fighters are intended to be expendable, which is why they're so rarely seen. Each ship can only fire so many shots at once (this is partially mitigated by phaser arrays which appear to be able to increase rate of fire at the expense of power, though disruptors and torpedoes apparently lack this ability). Therefore, the idea is, if you swarm a ship with enough fighters, some will get through, and may be able to cause some damage if they hit a weakened shield. This kind of attack will be extremely costly, which is why it's only used in emergencies, though it can be worthwhile if it distracts the enemy long enough to allow one of your own starships to recharge its shields. And fighters are likely the cheapest way to get lots of micro-torpedoes into a battle, as they don't need to be built to last and probably only require an hour or two worth of fuel. Of course, the survivability of individual fighters is fairly low (as compared to a starship with like 500 people aboard, none of whom are in really serious danger as long as the shields stay up) which is why the Federation especially is reluctant to use them except in emergency situations."
DaystromInstitute,3akibp,uptotwentycharacters,3,Sun Jun 21 16:34:42 2015 UTC,"I think so only in so far as starfleet has so little battle sense and fighters have been out of use for so long, they have no idea how to use small attack craft. Not even shuttles. Small attack craft, which is a much better descriptor since I cant say if those ships used are truly fighters, have been shown to be capable of being quite powerful.  Starfleet sending waves into capital ships with no cover? that does look a lot like suicide."
DaystromInstitute,3akibp,butterhoscotch,10,Sun Jun 21 03:17:14 2015 UTC,"I guess I have never thought of shuttlecraft or anything fighter sized as being powerful enough to do any good.  In the Trek universe it seems there is a minimum size to a ship that can be combat capable (BoP, Defiant, Bug, etc).  Otherwise they are to small to have a meaningful armament, defense, or power plant.    Looking at it the other way, from the capital ships perspective.  We have examples of larger ships shooting numerous targets at once (see here at 22 seconds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlobZcUJ9lg).  Starfleet phasers rarely miss (pulse phasers being an exception) so maneuver is less of an advantage for a fighter.  The Defiant is given credit for being a maneuverable ship but in her fight against the Lakota the Lakota doesn't miss much if at all (see here at 1:38 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBmmlHR1Bwg).  Fighters would be more maneuverable still but I don't think enough to make up the difference.  I think, and i could be wrong, that people look at modern naval strategy with carriers and fighters and automatically apply it to Trek.  However, modern fighters have significant advantages in speed, a whole new medium to work in, not to mention the lethality to be dangerous to other naval ships (1 plane can kill 1 ship).  Where as in Trek a fighter has none of those advantages.  In fact they are actually behind in one (speed) and don't have another (different medium).    Maybe fighters in Trek could swarm a larger capital ship, however the superior speed (warp) could let a capital ship disengage and come back on a vector/profile of its choosing.  Now, I think that only applies to Trek.  Other franchises do have fighter setups and they make sense in context of their respective shows.    I also think Starfleet does fight stupid (well maybe it would be farer to say all the factions fight kind of dumb).  I wish the VFX guys and writers wouldn't have just thrown ships at each other in DS9 fleet scenes.  Why go to ""knife range"" if you don't have to (I get it looks cooler, not to mention having ""lines"" make no sense in space combat). At least have the fleet let loose with a bunch of torpedoes from range, or do something other than ""charge!!""  Edit: Typo"
DaystromInstitute,3akibp,mistakenotmy,3,Sun Jun 21 04:36:59 2015 UTC,It's not so much maneuverability but of size. The defiant is still an order of magnitude larger than a fighter and thus easier to track.  An elephant and a mouse can both change directions on a dime? Mouse is still harder to hit.
DaystromInstitute,3akibp,DisforDoga,3,Sun Jun 21 06:24:48 2015 UTC,"Along the same lines, an elephant goring you hurts a lot more than a mouse's nibble."
DaystromInstitute,3akibp,nikchi,3,Sun Jun 21 07:18:54 2015 UTC,Sure. But if you could have as much mass in mice as you did in an elephant the amount of mice would pick you to bone in an instant.
DaystromInstitute,3akibp,DisforDoga,4,Sun Jun 21 07:29:02 2015 UTC,"But then the other point in the post is that a large ship can warp away at speeds unreachable by the fighters. And then reengage on its own terms. Also have to account for the shields. A small phaser would do no damage at all compared to a large ships phaser with its ship sized phaser banks.  So for a fighters to do any damage shields would need to be down or there would need to be a swarm of them. For there to be a swarm, they need ships to carry them to the front lines. If we use ships currently in service then we'd need an armada to carry enough to the front lines and at that point there's an armada."
DaystromInstitute,3akibp,nikchi,3,Sun Jun 21 07:42:40 2015 UTC,"Fighters are a force multiplyer. A tool like anything else. Yes they have to be based somewhere. However if the only real argument against them is that the enemy can abandon the field of battle then you have literally just won the battle.  Shields? Look at it this way. Yes a galaxy class phaser will have more power than a fighters phaser. However if you have as much mass in fighters as you do in a galaxy class your tonnage would be more efficient in terms of fighting. You could point all of your phasers at the enemy instead of not being able to bring half of your weapons to bear at any given time. It would require more to diminish the effectiveness of the force in that each bit of ""overkill"" in destroying a fighter is wasted energy. As well as not requiring crew to perform repairs instead of continuing to operate other weapons as multiple fighters do.   Then there's also the fact that captains love to divert shield power to the side being engaged. When fighters are in play the other ships cannot ""full power to aft shields"" because fighters on the starboard flank will eat them alive."
DaystromInstitute,3akibp,DisforDoga,3,Sun Jun 21 08:03:15 2015 UTC,I also agree they could have added a new dimension to the show by intelligently showing fleet battles. they did not.
DaystromInstitute,3akibp,butterhoscotch,2,Mon Jun 22 08:32:52 2015 UTC,"the delta flyer has been shown to have very powerful weapons with a three man crew, and very powerful shields. While not as strong as a cruiser like voyager, they pack a hell of  apunch and can take numerous hits, while even dodging hits.  hits can be dodged in the trek verse, we have seen evasive moves work and we have seen phasers and torpedoes miss. Now  we know hits are not absolute once the fire button is pressed, we add on that.  We take a delta flyer, with its insanely powerful weapons and shields, and we drop every thing else off it and we add even more weapons. We add sensor jamming and stealth tech.   Now we only use it in groups of 3, sending out 6 or 12 at a time. They work in tandem with voyager, they can take multiple hits, if one takes too much damage it can pull back. If the ship under attack doesnt target voyager, voyager willopen up on it. If it does target voyager 12 delta flyers with beefed up weapons will tear open its shields and it it up."
DaystromInstitute,3akibp,butterhoscotch,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:28:51 2015 UTC,"One big thing to remember is that the fighters have emergency transporters, check the TNG episode ""The First Duty.""  Most likely as soon as those fighters got hit, they transported back to a carrier (I'm guessing Galaxy Class ships) to get back in another fighter and keep the battle going."
DaystromInstitute,3akibp,Roderick111,2,Sun Jun 21 18:10:54 2015 UTC,Remember that a transporter cycle takes about 6 seconds and shields need to be down.  A Galaxy class ship isn't going to risk it's more than thousand person crew just to save one pilot.
DaystromInstitute,3akibp,chronnotrigg,2,Sun Jun 21 22:45:50 2015 UTC,Ok so they don't have carriers in the rear with rotating shield modulators that you can beam through.  All the pilots die. Happy?
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,PhotonSharpedo54,21,Sat Jun 20 20:25:16 2015 UTC,"Great production values. They had the benefit of being around during the rise of CGI, of course, but it also showed in the set design. When I picture the interior of a 24th century Starfleet vessel, it's not the Ent D I see. It's Voyager."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,thebeef24,9,Sat Jun 20 22:39:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely. The Enterprise-D set had a lot of obvious 80s influence, while Voyager actually looked like it was from the future, and still does. It's not my favorite Trek plot wise, but damn there were a lot of cool/beautiful sets and some really great effects."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,jake_w_smith,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:25:42 2015 UTC,"Exactly! And as much as I love DS9 and the Defiant, it's obvious the Defiant sets (except the bridge) were put together on a bargain budget. The Voyager sets obviously had some money thrown into them."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,thebeef24,2,Sun Jun 21 04:17:33 2015 UTC,"That's also very true for me. The Voyager set looks brilliant and feels like home - much more than the Enterprise-D. I also love the bridge design: Very futuristic, functional and theatrical. Voyager also had some great lighnting with the blue hues from consoles or the warp core in Engineering."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,tadayou,49,Mon Jun 22 09:49:54 2015 UTC,It's not all bad. It's just not TNG or DS9. It's a good series and some very good characters. The Doctor is the best part of the show and any episode surrounding him is usually a good one. As a character he can hold his own with almost any character from any other series. Seven of Nine is a good character also and Janeway is an interesting character although I still have lots of questions about her that I feel never get answered on the series. And Tuvok is a good character as well.   The series is a lot of up and down which is why I think people don't like it as much. There are just not as many good episodes as some of the other series which is why people react to it the way that they do. Overall I like it but if I had to pick a series to watch Voyager wouldn't be the one I would pick.
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,ozakalwe,17,Sat Jun 20 21:19:51 2015 UTC,Agree on all points. I also think a lot of people feel like voy had a lot of potential that it didn't live up to. It didn't max out. The BSG reboot came shortly after and showed what a lot of people thought voy could be.
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,RousingRabble,11,Sun Jun 21 03:52:12 2015 UTC,"I discovered a weird thing on a recent rewatch of Voyager. I got to the finale and I really, really wanted more. The story felt unfinished somehow, as though I hadn't spent enough time with the characters or gotten resolution to the story.  The end of TNG, on the other hand, left me completely satisfied that I'd experienced a coherent story and enjoyed my time with the characters. DS9 had a less satisfying ending that left me with questions and annoyances, but I still felt sated on some level, as though the story and themes of the show had been fully and appropriately explored.  I can't put my finger on exactly what Voyager didn't ""finish"", but the feeling is definitely there in a way unique to the series, for me."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,sindeloke,8,Sun Jun 21 08:05:51 2015 UTC,That's because they spent 7 seasons and still left several characters largely undeveloped.
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,RousingRabble,2,Sun Jun 21 12:41:41 2015 UTC,Despite having many episodes Seven still has so much potential left. Maybe because her character is the only one which changes massively throughout the series. She starts as a drone and constantly changes to various steps of acceptance and understanding for humanity.  But if we ever continue the Voyager storyline we need to get rid of her relationship with Chakotay. One could even say that he is taking advantage of her inexperience. He is roughly double her age and has ten times more experience with relationships.
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Hellstrike,2,Tue Jun 23 06:14:30 2015 UTC,I would also say the doctor changed. But they and maybe b'elanna and tom are the only ones with real development.
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,RousingRabble,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:06:45 2015 UTC,I would say that most of the characters had significant changes. But Seven and the Doctor have the most potential left due to them being in a completely unfamiliar situation (being on Earth with billions of humans)
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Hellstrike,6,Tue Jun 23 11:19:56 2015 UTC,"I think it may be to do with the way that the finale essentially came out of nowhere: they spent seven years in the Delta Quadrant and then boom, suddenly Admiral Janeway shows up to bring them home. No buildup, no foreshadowing, just a sudden shortcut and now the story's over. That's very different from ""What You Leave Behind"", which was wrapping up a heavily-serialised multi-episode story arc. And the difference between ""Endgame"" and ""All Good Things"" is that the latter heavily featured callbacks to the series premiere ""Encounter at Farpoint"" and essentially resolved the whole business with the recurring character of Q, which made it feel more earned. Additionally, ""All Good Things"" ended with the characters still exploring space aboard the Enterprise, so it was more like the story hadn't ended, just the part that we would get to see.   I actually think that if the finale of Voyager hadn't involved time travel, and had actually involved Voyager actually taking 23 years to get home and had shown vignettes of the crew growing older and changing over the years, people would feel more at ease with it. It would feel like a resolution in the same way that ""All Good Things"" is: like ""This story could've continued on, but the series can't go on forever, so this is essentially what happened after the first seven years."""
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Cole-Spudmoney,3,Mon Jun 22 06:19:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I think ""Endgame"" is a great and fun episode of Voyager that incorporates good acting (Kate Mulgrew! Alice Krige!), amazing visuals and a fun story. But it's a terrible series finale for a show that spent seven years on a journey to get home.  The final image of the show (""Set a course for home"") certainly is rather poetic, it's a nice send-off. It still doesn't really bode well as an end to that show. And I hated that Voyager's crew wasn't able to return home on their own."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,tadayou,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:39:19 2015 UTC,"I think that is partly because we don't know what happened to the characters. In TNG we know that they stayed on the Enterprise, doing their thing that they have done for the last years. But Voyager, they got home, but we don't know what happened to them. We know from Future Janeway that the Voyager was most likely turned into a museum the moment it came back, but we have no clue what happened to the crew afterwards."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Bobby_Bonsaimind,6,Sun Jun 21 18:57:58 2015 UTC,"I think Voyager is better if you come in around late third season. (And, to be fair, you could say the same about TNG.)  The early Voyager episodes weren't bad (which is something TNG can't say), but they introduced a lot of interesting directions that were soon abandoned without explanation, and that was really frustrating to watch."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,InscrutableTed,2,Sun Jun 21 06:36:08 2015 UTC,"However, there are still a few gems in Seasons 1 and 2 that you shouldn't miss - think ""Eye of the Needle"", ""Death Wish"" or ""Deadlock"" and surely a few other good episodes."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,tadayou,2,Mon Jun 22 09:36:21 2015 UTC,"The BSG reboot came shortly after and showed what a lot of people thought voy could be.    Moore has said that Voyager's failings are what prompted him to do the BSG reboot, so that's sort of what it was made to be."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,nermid,15,Mon Jun 22 05:11:41 2015 UTC,"Voyager is my favorite series.  Now, I know DS9 is objectively better. I know TOS is more groundbreaking. And I know TNG has better writing and is more believable. I also know VOY has some awful episodes, bad writing, worse acting, and damaged a lot of the canon (most obviously neutering the borg). But there's one thing it has that the others don't: a heart.  At its core, VOY is the story of a family that grows together and struggles to get home. They aren't the most complex or deep characters, but they interact with each other with a genuine affection and show their own emotional connections to their families on and off the ship that we do not see in TNG (Picard is aloof, Troi's annoyed at her mom, no one knows where Riker's family is, Data has no emotions, Worf controls his except his anger and really only cares about honor anyway, La Forge is lonely but happy go lucky at the same time, etc.). Voyager's characters are real people.  And I like them. Yes, even dull Kim. Even poorly acted Paris. Even annoying, bipolar Torres, and ""the blood of my people"" Chakotay. And, yes, even Neelix, whose encounter with his own death and the memories of the deaths of his family make him one of the most compassionate characters in any Star Trek series ever.  I love Voyager because I love the characters in it. I can rewatch it any time and it's like visiting old friends."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,13104598210,3,Sun Jun 21 03:32:46 2015 UTC,"They aren't the most complex or deep characters   I dunno about that. I think that they had the potential to be just as interesting, or even MORE interesting than the characters on DS9 (and DS9 is my favourite show). The basic concept is good. The acting is good, it is really just the writing that fails. And some characters get off better than others!"
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Grubnar,2,Sun Jun 21 10:50:02 2015 UTC,"I want to hear more. You mentioned a bit why you didn't care for the other characters like TNG, and you liked VOY character in spite of their flaws, but I still want to know what you did specifically like about them! :)"
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Kamala_Metamorph,4,Sun Jun 21 04:09:40 2015 UTC,"It's tough to say, but I think I just found them all relatable on one level or another, but I think it was more the way they interacted with each other. It was more intimate, personal, and...real than the way characters interacted on TNG (too professional), TOS (except Spock/McCoy/Kirk, there was limited personal interaction), and DS9 (very political and culturally complicated relationships).  I'm not saying I dislike the other series--I love them all--but VOY appealed to the part of me that yearns for a family, love, and relationships."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,13104598210,13,Sun Jun 21 16:40:16 2015 UTC,"I'm going to make some enemies with this one...  But Neelix.  And Kes.  I'm watching Voyager through for the first time.  Watching S03E15 as I type this actually.  So I've not got a seasoned opinion encasing the whole series, but I did have some expectations going in, and for the most part, Voyager hasn't disappointed.  Yes, it rehashes a lot of the stories from TNG and executes them maybe not as well as often.   But what got me excited about the series was the premise of them being alone in unknown territory again.  I missed that tension from TOS.  And the show does a good job of maintaining it.  I also love the interactions between Starfleet and people that don't give a shit or don't know about Starfleet.  That was some of my favorite content from TNG and DS9:  Real, likable, normal people throwing their lives like wrenches into the well oiled machine that is Starfleet.  And where TNG had 'episodes' of that theme with Ro Laren and the like, Voyager keeps it on board 24/7 as a pillar of it's crew, through the Maqui members, Neelix, and Kes.  You'll have situations where all the head officers try to do things by the books, but then a character outside the chain of command makes a radical suggestion to do things differently... And they go with it!  It's Star Trek... but different.  That's the best part of Voyager in my opinion."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,ohreuben,5,Sun Jun 21 01:11:38 2015 UTC,"Exploring. I love TNG, but for the bulk of the series, the 1701-D never seemed to be on the frontier of explored space - they were always checking on existing colonies, rendezvousing with other Starfleet ships, or performing diplomatic/ambassadorial duties to known worlds. I never got the sense that they were ""on their own"" like I did from TOS. Voyager, even with its faults, was great about feeling like a real explorer."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,EBone12355,5,Sun Jun 21 16:45:10 2015 UTC,"It seems to be uncommon, but I actually really like Neelix... in episodes where he's prominently featured. When the episode is about him or involves him in some substantial way, the writers tend to make an effort to give him some depth and make him sympathetic. It's the episodes where he's just a drop-in character for a scene or two where they tend to fall back on the ""annoying wacky alien"" shit.  I do like Kes, too, and I wish she could have stayed. But to be honest, I don't like Neelix and Kes together – it works on paper, but they have absolutely no chemistry together. Before I'd actually watched Voyager from beginning to end I was disappointed when I heard that they apparently ended up breaking up, but now having watched the episodes in question I think it was a good decision."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Cole-Spudmoney,4,Mon Jun 22 06:25:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I like Neelix, and don't really get the hate for him. Especially once the stupid rivalry arc with Tom Paris ends, he becomes a very likable character. His background (war on Talax, smuggler and freelance trader) is interesting and surprisingly deep at times (as early as Season 1's ""Jetrel"", no less!).   I also agree on Kes and Neelix. I think they should have been more in a mentor-tutor relationship, where Neelix becomes a father figure to Kes and saves her out of pure empathy for a young kid who has lost her way. This would have enabled a much deeper exploration of the bonds between two people and could have been much more poignant at the time when Kes becomes more independent and even leaves the ship. Heck, they could have still thrown in a side-story were Neelix becomes weary of Tom for flirting with ""his girl"" in this character constellation.   At last, I think their dialoge in both ""The Gift"" and ""Fury"" redeems much of the romance. I think their final scene together (in ""The Gift""), just before Kes leaves Voyager is beautifully written and acted - and very mature and believable."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,tadayou,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:03:56 2015 UTC,"I don't like Neelix and Kes together – it works on paper, but they have absolutely no chemistry together.   You know, if they'd settled that issue properly, that would have made sense. Neelix and Kes hooked up because of the whole way they met and how she got rescued. This is not such an uncommon story, and oftentimes couples that start this way find out later that they're not suited for each other.   But they never resolved it properly, which means that instead of a proper story we have... a couple with no chemistry and you don't know why they stay together."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,conuly,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:39:35 2015 UTC,"Well, they do break up in season 2, so I guess they do kinda resolve it..."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Cole-Spudmoney,26,Thu Jun 25 06:07:48 2015 UTC,"Though they were stranded on the opposite side of the galaxy from their home, far away from the Federation, they maintained their sense of identity in the face of adversity, held onto their ideals. The entire time they could have done anything to get home, and time after time they all agreed that skipping 10 years of their journey was not worth the loss of a life, even if they had very little comprehension of what that life-form could have been. Their other Federation counterparts who had also been stranded abandoned those ideals and it cost their own lives.  Edit: Spllelling is hrad."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,DS_Unltd,9,Sat Jun 20 20:56:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with your sentiments, but I'm wary of saying ""abandoning human/Federation morality means the universe will kill you"" in regards to the Equinox ship/crew."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,BigTaker,13,Sat Jun 20 21:53:39 2015 UTC,"I like the episodes with the Equinox, but I think they also magnify the issue of Voyager not taking any wear and tear throughout the seven years they were in the Delta Quadrant. It would have been that much better if the ship got beat up, but maybe instead of being as damaged as the Equinox, start showing thrown-together repairs or alien technology acquired through trade as stand-ins for destroyed systems. I realize the ""back to new"" look was pretty much a network decision the writers and crew had to abide by, and I don't think Voyager should have resembled the Equinox by the end, or how she was during Year of Hell, but it would have added to the realism and given the show drive that it was missing."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Ovarian_Cavity,5,Sun Jun 21 00:19:29 2015 UTC,Something Battlestar Galactica did phenomenally.
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Taliesintroll,6,Sun Jun 21 01:28:08 2015 UTC,"I didn't want to make the BSG connection, because honestly they were two different shows, but yes. If Voyager had shown just an ounce of hurt, the stakes would have been that much higher, like BSG. After New Caprica, you could tell Galactica was hurting, and that made any further engagements difficult."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Ovarian_Cavity,2,Sun Jun 21 01:51:08 2015 UTC,The funny thing is that everything on voyager was CGI so it would have been easier than building new models and shooting them every few episodes. Of course the problem is CGI eats your budget and is a colossal time sink (especially in the 90s) so spending money on it probably was kept in check outside of special episodes.
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,mnky9800n,2,Sun Jun 21 16:43:11 2015 UTC,I would have liked to have seen areas of the ship that were no longer habitable and some serious scaring on the ship with like makeshift discolored plating on the side.   Voyager was super fond of the reset button. Freaking Berman.
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,dickbuttzz,9,Sun Jun 21 01:30:35 2015 UTC,"Posted this in another thread a short time ago:  Voyager has a lot of problems concerning its potential and all. However, I will compliment it by saying it really does do more ""boldly going"", seeking out new life and civilizations than TNG or DS9 did. TNG, especially in the later years, tended to become a bottle show and became almost entirely concerned with shipbound life. Comparing something like season 4 to season 1 is really quite striking. Voyager on the other hand does feel more like TOS in the sense of a new planet or a new species much more frequently. They probably felt the need to get off-ship more with DS9 being station-bound, but I'm glad they did because in my rewatch of TNG I've noticed just how little ""seek out new life and new civilizations"" actually gets done. They do one big location world early in the season, blow all their money on it, and then do Data and holodeck shows for the rest of the year with a Klingon or Romulan show thrown in once in awhile. Their missions are mostly diplomatic or astronomically concerned. Less, ""oh look, a fascinating species!"" and more, ""oh look, a red dwarf star!"" And to make it worse, so often whenever the ship supposedly has been doing these things, it's always off camera. ""Captain's log stardate 45-blah-blah-blah. We've just returned from first contact with the Treladians, and are looking forward to shore leave at Starbase 74."" For all it's flaws, Voyager didn't do that. They couldn't rely on old nemeses (until they started over-using the Borg), so we get ""Oh, a planet with a fascinating transporter device!"" ""Oh, a class-D planet!"" ""Oh, a scary space cloud!"" ""Oh, a scary space monster!"" ""Oh, scary space darkness!"" ""Oh, a race that lives in scary space darkness!"" ""Oh, a planet that experiences time much faster than we do!"" ""Oh, yet another planet that appreciates the arts!"" My point is, variety."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,ItsMeTK,3,Sun Jun 21 01:04:13 2015 UTC,"Oh, a planet that experiences time much faster than we do!   An excellent argument in favor of Voyager right there, that was a fantastic almost-real-science premise and a thought-provoking episode."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,sindeloke,15,Sun Jun 21 14:46:00 2015 UTC,"I'm currently in season 4 of my latest rewatch. Yes, there are some problem episodes where all logic was thrown out of an airlock. Yes, they neutered the Borg and created a quagmire of canonical episodes that'll keep this subreddit busy for decades. Yes, Janeway basically murdered a guy and there were no repercussions. That being said-  The show is fun to watch. I love the banter between the doctor and the rest of the crew. I like the idea of the ship finding it's way home, never able to ""retreat"" to friendly space. I think it really flushed out the Q backstory. We learn more about the mindset of the Maquis. We finally get to know a strong female captain who doesn't get to use an empath as a ""hint button"" during negotiations."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Sidethepatella,15,Sat Jun 20 21:19:57 2015 UTC,"I think that if you want to have the Borg as recurring adversaries on a TV series, they will necessarily have to be ""neutered"". You can't feature an implacable, invincible enemy (on a par with the Collective's last full appearance before First Contact, in ""Best of Both Worlds"") and not have the heroes win in some form or another without introducing weaknesses. The more times you use them, the more loopholes you have to introduce in order to make them beatable, and featuring an ex-Borg main character in Seven of Nine just compounds the issue further.  It could be argued, however, that First Contact was as guilty of ""neutering"" the Borg as Voyager, and FC certainly formed the basis of their characterisation going forwards. Voyager takes the blame more often because it featured the Borg more than any of the other series, but the genesis of the ""modern"" (i.e. beatable) Borg began with First Contact."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,CNash85,6,Sat Jun 20 22:15:33 2015 UTC,"And honestly, if you watch their appearances in TNG, they were getting consistently less terrifying as time went on. In Q Who? they were untouchable gods and Picard had to simper and beg Q to rescue them. In BoBW, Data hacked a cube to defeat them. By the end of TNG, fucking Lore was subjugating Borg (""free"" or not).  The Borg were being neutered from the moment we met them."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,nermid,2,Mon Jun 22 05:29:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks, people often forget that The Next Generation is just as guilty of the Borg's villain decay as Voyager."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,tadayou,6,Mon Jun 22 09:40:51 2015 UTC,"If Voyager never directly engaged the Borg and was constantly running away from them for a season or two, that might have worked."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,philwelch,4,Sat Jun 20 23:28:42 2015 UTC,That could have been cool. Al la Battlestar with the Cylons at the start.
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,dickbuttzz,3,Sun Jun 21 01:32:26 2015 UTC,"Remember, in ""Q Who?"", the Ent-D couldn't outrun a single Borg Cube; Q had to save them by flinging them back across the galaxy. If Voyager kept escaping from them, you'd see people complaining that Voyage had neutered the Borg's speed... :D"
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,CNash85,3,Sun Jun 21 13:02:46 2015 UTC,"Voyager was faster than the Enterprise-D. Also, they could have devised illegal cloaking devices or done other crazy, inventive things to get away from the Borg."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,philwelch,2,Sun Jun 21 17:44:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, Janeway basically murdered a guy and there were no repercussions.   Which episode was this? Tuvix?"
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Username8888,2,Sun Jun 21 02:31:29 2015 UTC,"Yep, I know Tuvix can be a touchy subject in this subreddit, but I'm firmly in the ""murder"" camp.  That actually supports the discussion here- so many years after the show ended we're still caught up in the discussion over the choices of the characters."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Sidethepatella,13,Sun Jun 21 06:06:09 2015 UTC,"I liked the doctor. He showed development from a hologram to an individual with a distinctive character voice, with dialogue different from the other characters."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Blue387,4,Sat Jun 20 21:52:38 2015 UTC,"The Doctor was by far my favorite character in the show as well. They did a great job showing his development. And while the mobile emitter was a tad bit contrived, it was excusable as we were able to see the doctor interact off the ship with others.  I also think the Hirogen were pretty interesting as a race. The Vidiians as well. The Kazon not so much however. The Q episodes of voyager were some of the worst."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Ralod,14,Sun Jun 21 03:10:43 2015 UTC,"I think it was a decent show, not my favorite, but it did something the previous three didn't exactly do, which was to give a theme throughout the entire show; getting back to Earth. Even as a kid, I really liked the mixture of a continued story while making most episodes stand alone ones.   While DS9 is my favorite show, you didn't have to know the major plot point for the season in order to understand what was going on, but at the same time, there was no plot point that carried from episode one to the last. That is what VOY ended up doing. It made a plot that everyone could easily follow for the arc of the entire show, and then had just about every plot in each show have some kind or relation to the overall mission. It felt tighter than DS9 or TNG. Althought there were some plot points that were carried through TNG, I think that those could easily be forgotten or lost. TNG was a really replacing TOS, which is what it was meant to do. It was a weekly show where people could sit down and watch it for the first time and enjoy it. They could come in on season one or season seven and still relate with the show because it was mostly new each episode and it didn't take much information to get hooked.   DS9 was the same way in the first season or so, but by the third, you really had to watch it a couple times a month to get a decent idea of character development and story arc. And in my opinion, that is what killed ENT, is that you had to really watch each episode, or at least two or three a month to follow the story (good show, but VERY different than TNG, DS9, and VOY).  But what VOY did that was really great is that you could come back and know only that the crew is returning to the Alpha Quadrant and still only see one episode per month and relate to the story. I think there were a lot more plot holes in VOY and I think that the props started looking bad and the CGI just made me frustrated, but overall it was a good show and the one thing that makes it stand out is the balance between having a story arc and not having to see every episode in order."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,sunnyandtony,6,Sat Jun 20 22:37:09 2015 UTC,You make a really good point about how Voyager was easy to watch in the days before DVR and Netflix than DS9.
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Sareki,5,Sat Jun 20 23:23:21 2015 UTC,"Most people who complain about one Star Trek series tend to be reflecting what that series does differently than their favorite one. Everyone wants their favorite show to have continued.   Each show is fairly different than the last, and that is how it should be. I don't really want to go on the same journey again and again. I want to go on something new, and that reflects the Star Trek philosophy of boldly going where no one (or no show) has gone before.   For me personally, the only stuff I complain about is the new movies because they are missing that social commentary that the series was originally about. I personally prefer Star Trek as a tv series rather than as movies, but there is more money in movies than tv. I am not saying that the new movies are rubbish, because I totally went and saw them in theaters, and I will see the next, too, but they are just stories and they don't get at any serious moral or ethical dilemma in our society. Sure, there might be some if you look hard, but you shouldn't have it. It shouldn't be a puzzle. It should be somewhat blatant and obvious so that you can see how those problems impact others and how they are worked out."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,sunnyandtony,23,Sun Jun 21 00:45:31 2015 UTC,"Voyager is a very interesting show because most of the characters are not 'the best and the brightest.' Specifically, Tom, B'Elanna, Kes, Seven, Neelix, The Doctor, and Chakotay could not be part of a Starfleet crew under other circumstances. This leads to a set of characters from whom Federation ideals are not their top priority (DS9 also plays with this idea). This allows for some interesting episodes, like Thirty Day, Lineage, and Prey.   I personally find most of the characters on Voyager rather interesting, specifically Tom and B'Elanna. They both go from being on the fringe of society to being well respected officers with a baby on the way. There aren't many main characters in the Trek universe that change as much as these two (maybe Kira and Odo?).  I also think that Voyager has the best diversity of any of the casts. There are three female main characters and four people of color. The other great part about the female cast is that Seven, Janeway, and B'Elanna are all in STEM fields (well... Janeway was before she moved to command). Voyager passes the Bechdel test at significantly higher rate than the other Trek shows, because these three talk about the problem of the week almost every week.   Edit: The Voyager cast as a whole is very good at comedy. Bride of Chaotica, Someone To Watch Over Me, and Body and Soul are some of the funniest Trek episodes."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Sareki,8,Sat Jun 20 21:43:08 2015 UTC,"Voyager passes the Bechdel test at significantly higher rate than the other Trek shows   I must say, while nearly 90% is extraordinary, I'm kind of surprised every episode doesn't pass it."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,danitykane,11,Sat Jun 20 23:53:14 2015 UTC,"Some of the episodes that didn't pass are interesting as well. For example, Muse (a B'Elanna ep) and Sacred Ground (a Janeway ep) both fail."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Sareki,9,Sun Jun 21 00:03:37 2015 UTC,Sacred Ground doesn't pass? Is it because none of the female guest stars have names? I've always considered that a weirder part of the test in that it doesn't always make sense in some contexts.
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,danitykane,6,Sun Jun 21 00:08:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's because 'The Guide' isn't a name... that is a quirk of the test. But all tests that are so simple are going to have problems. I think the test is most telling on an overall basis. On Voyager, you have three women cast members, and Seven and Janeway are featured in most episodes, so you get a really high pass rate. Compare that to Enterprise, which did the worst of the 90s-00s Treks. Going back to only two women and then sidelining one of them really hurt its score."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Sareki,6,Sun Jun 21 00:20:54 2015 UTC,"I think the test is most telling on an overall basis.    Yeah, I think the test is meant more to show a trend than anything else, especially when there's a not-pass trend, considering how effing low the bar is.   Also, when I saw this before, I only focused on Voyager... I'm only now noticing that DS9 fell backwards in later seasons. What happened?"
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Kamala_Metamorph,4,Sun Jun 21 03:54:11 2015 UTC,"What happened?   Neither Cardassians nor Klingons put women in positions of military power, and Klingons don't even put them in positions of political power. Thus the more the Dominion War became a focus, the more screentime was consequently devoted to dudes.  (DS9 did have one of my favorite moments for feminism in any Trek, though, which is the episode where the matriarchal alien refugees want to settle on Bajor. The fact that the main cast is just sort of bemusedly disapproving of their extreme sexism but rolls with it without comment is so refreshing. Because of course that's exactly what they do with every heavily chauvanist society they meet as well, so them doing it with a misandrist society too means that that's just how they act around sexist societies, and not that chauvanism is uniquely ok by Federation standards.)"
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,sindeloke,2,Sun Jun 21 14:52:51 2015 UTC,matriarchal alien refugees want to settle on Bajor   fascinating! what ep is this?
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Kamala_Metamorph,3,Sun Jun 21 14:57:16 2015 UTC,"2:10, ""Sanctuary."" Great Kira episode."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,sindeloke,7,Sun Jun 21 15:24:06 2015 UTC,"On that note, not to stray too far from Voyager, was that Enterprise did go backwards. T'Pol was a good character, but she was really alone amongst women. They went back to the 60s and made Hoshi the bridge secretary, even if she's a language expert. I would have loved to see a woman at the helm or security (or even another captain, but who's keeping score?)."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,danitykane,3,Sun Jun 21 00:24:55 2015 UTC,"There were several ENT episodes where Hoshi was needed for her langauge skills, and they had an arc about her overcoming homesickness/finding out if she really wanted to be in Starfleet."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Bruce_G,2,Sun Jun 21 02:59:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that trivia. I'm extremely surprised that ""Sacred Ground"" didn't pass the test - it's such a great Janeway episode and I absolutely adored the actress who portrayed the guide. In the end the episode fails at doing one minor thing (giving a spiritual character a name) but pass the test at so many other levels (i.e. Janeway stoically facing tribulations to save on of her crew - and another woman, no less)."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,tadayou,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:45:11 2015 UTC,"Those episodes are at least female-centered, so I'm okay giving a half-pass. (Other opinions may vary, and this is okay.)"
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,conuly,5,Thu Jun 25 05:01:25 2015 UTC,"Voyager is also one of the few things that gets to challenge the very bones of the Bechdel test, as one must inevitably ask if, when Janeway is discussing the warp core with another Janeway in Deadlock...does that count? Is Janeway from the wrecked ship the same character as Janeway from the pristine ship?"
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,nermid,3,Mon Jun 22 05:15:25 2015 UTC,"And the series even does that twice with Janeway, no less. And before that already with a genetically split B'Elanna in Season 1!"
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,tadayou,3,Mon Jun 22 09:47:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's actually a more important question in Faces. In Deadlock, Janeway and B'Elanna are tying to solve the problem of the week, so it passes from that. In Faces, the B'Elannas never talk to another woman, just to each other."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Sareki,16,Mon Jun 22 14:52:20 2015 UTC,"I recently panned DS9(my favourite trek) for its lack of believable/likable female characters so it's only fair that  give credit where its due.   IMO VOY did the best job with female characters of all the Treks:  B'Elanna developed tremendously from the start to the end of the show. She wasn't always likable (intentionally so) but most of the things she said and did made sense for a person like her. Her transition from maquis hothead to Starfleet hothead to Starfleet engineer was slow, smooth and believable. Was she a Latina stereotype? Perhaps, but I can look past it because of how much effort they put into developing her from that starting point.  Janeway was the captain of the ship and was, by all accounts, an excellent science officer prior to role as captain. She was strongly principled, well-respected and highly intelligent without it feeling too much like a PSA encouraging girls/women to pursue the sciences. For the most part they also managed to humanize her without wrecking her standing as a badass Starfleet captain. The exception to this is the absolutely horrific Janeway Lambda One holonovel, a cloying mess of feminine stereotypes and obnoxious characters. Still, Janeway always comes across as a competent captain and her gender is very rarely invoked as a plot device. You may not like her decision making, you may think she's inconsistent, but she's got fucking guts.  Seven is one of my absolute favourite Star Trek characters and it has way less to do with the catsuit than people might think. VOY meandered awfully for the first three seasons and didn't manage to develop many of the characters worth a damn in that time (hence their desire to kill harry at the end of S3 to thin the herd). It lacked purpose, it lacked direction and it lacked consequence from week-to-week. Seven comes in and delivers that sense of purpose. Episodes including her prominently tended to be good ones because it seemed like the writers were inspired by the possibilities she presented. Jeri Ryan may also have been the best actor on VOY IMO (that's right, come at me bro); she managed to provide a tremendous amount of depth and nuance through her tone and mannerisms while having a limited amount of emotional range to work with. Only after they tried and failed miserably with T'Pol did people seem to realize that it's a lot goddamn harder than it looks.     Was she hot? Yes, she was (and still is) an absolute smokeshow. Was the catsuit a bit much? Probably yes too. But that's secondary to her very interesting nature and shouldn't be held against her as some affront to the positive portrayal of women on TV. It always bothered my to hear other VOY cast members crib about how Seven's character was developed at the expense of all others. Without her, and without Jeri Ryan playing her, I am absolutely convinced VOY would not have made it through 7 seasons."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,smilodont,7,Sat Jun 20 23:24:23 2015 UTC,"I completely agree that Voyager did a great job with their female characters. I think even Kes had some good moments in the third season, once she got away from Neelix. I also read your link, and I think another positive aspect of Voyager that the Tom and B'Elanna thing worked well (unlike, IMHO, Worf and Dax)."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Sareki,3,Sun Jun 21 00:16:12 2015 UTC,"The exception to this is the absolutely horrific Janeway Lambda One holonovel, a cloying mess of feminine stereotypes and obnoxious characters.   I think it's perfectly acceptable for her to have weird tastes in her leisure time. You and I spend our off time overanalyzing a 20-year-old sci-fi TV show. She can make-believe she's a teacher to some annoying kids.  As for Seven...well, all of the post-TNG Trek shows have the unfortunate marks of somebody from the network saying ""sex sells. Put some sex in it. Can we make this more about sex?"" The sexy decontamination wipedown scenes in Enterprise and everything about Mirror Kira were so obvious about it that I'm amazed the writers managed to keep Seven as clothed as they did."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,nermid,2,Mon Jun 22 05:24:09 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree with your point about her holo-novel. Hobby-shaming is not cool, neither in the 21st nor the 24th century. I still think the daVinci programm was a mucher nicer reflection on her character (and the set was a beautiful contrast to Voyager's grey corridors)."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,tadayou,2,Mon Jun 22 09:55:13 2015 UTC,"You and I spend our off time overanalyzing a 20-year-old sci-fi TV show.    Hahahaha. This should be on the header or something, so that we can point to it whenever anyone complains about a character."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Kamala_Metamorph,2,Mon Jun 22 17:57:39 2015 UTC,"Well, to be perfectly honest, if I were watching my life, I'd say /u/nermid is a boring character whose interests aren't really believable..."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,nermid,3,Mon Jun 22 23:21:16 2015 UTC,"I often feel like B'Elanna is such an underrated character. Roxann Dawson was a very talented actress who made some really stupid situations work (I think in Season 2 she had two or three character episodes in row, where she was just talking to a computer most of the time). For some reasons, fans don't give much credit to her, but for me she's easily one of the highlights of Voyager."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,tadayou,5,Mon Jun 22 09:53:10 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you. There are so many B'Elanna episodes that would have just been terrible in the hands of a lesser actor (e.g, Faces, Dreadnought). Or think about that shower scene at the end of Juggernaut. That is some wonderful silent acting. She also shows her range in Remember and The Killing Game. In both cases, she doesn't just act like B'Elanna, she creates a new character and plays that person.  I completely agree that she is one of the highlights of Voyager, but she is never mention as one of the better actors. The list is usually Picardo, Ryan, and more recently Mulgrew (I think after people saw her on OITNB). But Dawson is very good... maybe just not given many opportunities to showcase her skills.   Edit: typing is hard..."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Sareki,3,Mon Jun 22 15:02:28 2015 UTC,"I still hold a grudge against Seven for taking the role of Bad-ass Warrior Chick away from B'Elanna, and relegating B'Elanna to Reluctant Girlfriend. :-/  Also, I never liked that Faces killed off the Klingon side of her. Why is the human always the default.  Would've been much more interesting if the human side had been sacrificed.   (Not to diminish Seven's character or Jeri Ryan's talent. But since apparently the writers thought there was only room for one, I'm mad that they took it away from an established character.)"
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Kamala_Metamorph,2,Mon Jun 22 17:55:20 2015 UTC,"I still hold a grudge against Seven for taking the role of Bad-ass Warrior Chick away from B'Elanna, and relegating B'Elanna to Reluctant Girlfriend. :-/   I agree and disagree. I think B'Elanna just had less screen time after Seven came and I actually think it effected her role as the problem solver (eg Parallax) more than as a bad-ass. For example, Juggernaut is in the fifth season and that is a pretty bad-ass B'Elanna episode. I think more than Seven, Roxann and then B'Elanna being pregnant played a bigger role in the character literally kicking less ass.   As to her relationship with Tom, I think this is actually a positive development for B'Elanna's character. One of her hang ups is that she believes she is unlovable. But through Tom's romantic love and Chakotay's paternal/brotherly love, B'Elanna is able to work through some of those issues. Personally, I think that Tom and B'Elanna are the most fulfilling romantic relationship in all of Trek. I would agree that since they only allowed 2-3 episodes per season to be B'Elanna centric, that once she and Tom here together, screen time had to be taken away from 'bad-ass B'Elanna' and given to 'in a relationship B'Elanna'."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Sareki,5,Mon Jun 22 18:18:25 2015 UTC,One of my favourite episodes is the one where Voyager is trapped in orbit around the plant that has faster time than the rest of the galaxy.
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Kubrick_Fan,4,Sun Jun 21 13:04:36 2015 UTC,"Easily an episode that is up there among Star Trek's classic stories. ""Blink of an Eye"" is beautiful - the writing, the acting, the concept, the execution.   My only gripe with the episode is that those aliens are seen writing in English (which really stands out, because in virtually every other episode of 90's Star Trek they invent an alien script). But it's such a minor nitpicking that it doesn't distract from the overall quality of the story."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,tadayou,3,Mon Jun 22 10:10:00 2015 UTC,"As a Captain, I felt Janeway was perfect for the series.  A lot of the decisions she has to make (especially early on) would have far reaching repercussions.  Every Captain in Starfleet is presented with crises and dilemmas constantly, but most other Captains have the entire Federation to rely on for support.  Janeway, especially early on, mostly just had Tuvok.  Chakotay was a Maquis and the possibility of mutiny was addressed more than once.  Paris was good at piloting, and aside from snarky common sense, wasn't exactly a tactical genius.  Kim was inexperienced, B'elanna was loyal to Chakotay. The ship didn't even have a counselor, and without Neelix filling In everywhere and the Doctor ascending his programming, they would've been doomed.  Janeway held them all together, was never afraid of pulling rank, and never let the crew forget that they were Starfleet officers first and foremost.   She's no Picard, but that's a pretty high standard to hold oneself to anyway.    Overall, the story arc is captivating. The only thing I wish they did more of was to take on aliens as crew members and utilize more alien technology.  We see the conversations where they say they traded x for a replicator or whatever, but aside from a few Borg pods in the cargo bay we don't see much implementation of said technology.  It would've been sweet to see Voyager return home with like a new particle Canon and an additional warp engine or something.  Aside from Neelix, Kes and Seven they take no one with them.  I would've preferred some more political asylum or a prisoner who has to make it back to Starfleet.  At the very least I think the Equinox should've been incorporated long-term. They could have salvaged it for parts (combined their ships) had it as a support ship,  plus the Delta Flyer as a mini fleet, or at least absorbed their crew.  It would have shown the toll that Voyager and her crew were taking.  Instead, they magically heal up back to New every episode or two."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,I_AM_IGNIGNOTK,3,Sun Jun 21 00:56:03 2015 UTC,"Definitely the Doctor, one of my favorite characters from any Trek (and the only one I think I'd like to revisit in a new series, if the actor were a little younger). Seven of Nine is also a fantastic, if somewhat overused, character.  Most of the premise of Voyager is great. It was the execution that failed. Voyager ""reboots"" like BSG and Stargate Universe committed to the premise in a much darker vein and were more successful for it, I think. But the basic idea behind the series was very solid and it could have been a great show in a different media ecology."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,gerryblog,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:16:36 2015 UTC,"It was the execution that failed.   I suspect that's the crux of the Voyager hate. I mean, it's not a bad series - not great, but hell, there are plenty of episodes from each series that are really awful. But when you compare what might have been to what we got... geez."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,conuly,3,Thu Jun 25 04:58:20 2015 UTC,"The Doctor and Seven of Nine work well. They had some very good FX and make-up work and the actors did a good job with what they had to work with.  They had good ideas in spades, just not a lot of follow-through."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,Borkton,3,Sun Jun 21 18:09:40 2015 UTC,"Voyager often doesn't work as a ""series"", i.e. there's hardly any sense of continuity or character growth outside of Seasons 2 and 4, but the show certainly has quite a few gems of brilliant episodes. I find Voyager terrible for bulk watching as there is rarely any story momentum that carries over into another episode. But some of these stories are right there at the top of what Star Trek has to offer. Seriously - at its best, Voyager tells some fantastic science fiction stories and explores the human condition not unlike TOS or TNG did.  That, and I absolutely adore Kate Mulgrew and find her performance mesmerizing to watch at times: She put so much heart and soul into that role, often even outperforming mediocre scripts. And there are other talented actors and actresses as well: Tim Russ, Roxann Dawson, Jennifer Lien, Jeri Ryan, Bob Picardo - not to forget some great guest stars that take over an episode from time to time.  Edit: And despite its non-serialization, Voyager still has some mini-arcs that are rather good: There are two obvious arcs in Season 2 (Kazon/Seska) and Season 4 (Borg/Seven of Nine) but also some smaller arcs: The Q Story (including the brilliant ""Death Wish""), The Pathfinder Arc (featuring Reginald Barclay and Deanna Troi from TNG), the story of the Borg children (Season 6 and 7) and even a small and unconventional two-parter in Seasons 4 and 5 (""Demon"" and ""Course: Oblivion""). And there's the whole will they/won't they romance of B'Elanna Torres and Tom Paris in years 3 and 4 that also culminates in a couple of great episodes (among them the brilliant Season 7 episode ""Lineage""). Just to give you some ideas."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,tadayou,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:26:04 2015 UTC,"The Q episodes on Voyager are the only Q episodes I am willing to watch. (Well, other than the single scene where Q get punched by Sisko, that's great.) Which is good, because I utterly refuse to watch any episode with the Borg Queen, so it evens out.  Ugh, the Borg Queen. If she's going to be creepy and sexually repressed, I want to know why she doesn't just modify a drone to... well, anyway, those episodes make me cringe in all the bad ways."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,conuly,3,Thu Jun 25 04:30:23 2015 UTC,"In my view, it's mainly ""the further adventures of Next Generation"" with a different crew. The ensemble never seems to me to ""click"" in the same way as TNG, but the formula is a strong one. In my recent rewatch, I certainly didn't think there was a huge drop-off in quality from DS9 -- if anything, a more episodic approach was refreshing after how tangled things became in the final season of DS9. I also think that the writers tried for bolder thought experiments than in TNG sometimes, which is a high-risk, but also high-reward strategy.  In addition, they were consistently better at setting up compelling two-part episodes than TNG in my opinion.  For my money, though, the best part of Voyager is Seven of Nine. I know she was overexposed, and I know her outfit is embarrassing, but she is one of the few Star Trek characters with a carefully plotted character arc. Especially in her first season (4), the development of her character was logical and compelling, with two or three serious turning points, culminating in the season finale where she finally definitively chooses individuality. In my opinion, if you take seasons 4 and 5 together as the story of Seven of Nine, it's much better put-together than the Dominion War.   More generally, it's great to finally have a female-dominated ship in the supposedly Super-Progressive Future of Star Trek. Janeway deserved better writing, but her performance is awesome and she's my favorite captain other than Picard. A female chief engineer was long overdue as well.   And this brings me to the downvote-inducing portion of my post -- I think people are overly hard on Voyager due to sexism. You see it clearly with Seven of Nine, where so many fans are willing to dismiss a great character performed by one of the best actors in the history of Trek, just because she's wearing a tight outfit. And it's especially insidious in her case, because they use her outfit as a pretext for claiming that they object on feminist grounds -- and so they fight sexism by reducing Seven of Nine to her body and dismissing her."

Things and characters I liked about Voyager:   I didn't mind the design of the ship.  It follows the design philosophy shown in Trek and is appropriately sized (I hate those fucking warp nacelles that have to move before they go to warp, though). The Doctor (and Lewis Zimmerman the handful of times he appears) is fantastic, in no small part due to Robert Picardo's talents. Torres wasn't a bad character, and she was well-played by a competent actress, but the writing was just so awful, and what wasn't terrible dialogue was ""initiate an inverse tachyon beam through the main deflector to compensate for the subspace phase variance"". Paris works quite well, though towards the end of the series it's ridiculous how many things they have him doing or being an expert it.   Things and characters I really don't care about one way or the other:   Kes. Tuvok. Harry Kim - he might as well have just been a recurring guest star he was that boring.   Things and characters they should have scrapped:   Neelix. Naomi Wildman and those annoying Borg kids.  And Icheb - get rid of Wesley of Borg already. Chakotay was just awful - when he wasn't just sitting around being boring, he had entire episodes dedicated to that ""akoochimoya"" pseudo-Indian bullshit.  The early stuff with him and Seska asking the Maury Povitch question was embarassing. I can't stand Janeway - even when she's not being a egotistical tyrant, she still sounds like a robot, and she's second only to Torres for bad technobabble. Seven of Nine.  It got to the point where every 2nd or 3rd episode was about her, and her declaring things to be ""irrelevant"" stopped being funny after about ten seconds.  Also, ""nanoprobes"" being the answer to everything was just as annoying as the Torres and Janeway technobabble. Overuse of ""will we get home again this episode?"" plots. Magic reset button."

I agree about Chakotay, I feel his native american heritage was so poorly handled, as if the writers didn't bother to do research about native american practices and just filled his character with tired stereotypes..."
DaystromInstitute,3ajik7,MageTank,2,Sun Jun 21 16:56:14 2015 UTC,"Interestingly enough, the Native American consultant they used to develop the Chakotay character and the Indian cutural aspects of the show was a guy called Jamake Highwater, who was completely discredited as being an Indian (he was an Armenian Greek passing himself off as one), and an expert on their culture in the 80s.  Obviously you can't really blame the writers or producers of the show, but that's what happens when you use a single source on a token character - it's like wanting to have a black character, and basing it on entirely on Will Smith."

Yes, it is. There's no reason they couldn't have fobbed some of that off on Harry, given him something to do besides lack any form of growth.

In one episode on Voyager, the whole crew is going crazy trying to solve this brain teaser puzzle. On TNG, a fad like that had a decent shot of being an evil alien conspiracy.

In fact, TOS wasn't really written with continuity in mind at all. Just the way that TV networks operated back then was very different. Continuity was discouraged because shows were made with the intention of being rerun by TV stations, often times out of order.  That's not really the case with Voyager. The show was made during a time when serialization in TV shows was much more common place. The premise of the show required it more since the whole point is that they're out there stranded alone without support while other shows took place in the Federation so it makes much more sense for problems to be resolved between episodes since they can get support from Starfleet."

Corroded iron particles.  JANEWAY: Would you mind telling me how iron could rust in space without oxygen?  KIM: I wish I could.  JANEWAY: Mister Paris, alter our course to follow that trail of rust. One quarter impulse.  PARIS: Aye, Captain.  (Later, on long range sensors.)   KIM: Captain, look at this. I'm picking up traces of complex hydrocarbons in the rust. Benzene, ethylene, acetylene.  PARIS: That sounds like gasoline.  CHAKOTAY: Gasoline?  PARIS: It's a liquid fuel that was used centuries ago on Earth. They burned it to drive internal combustion engines.  JANEWAY: How did it get out here?  TUVOK: I'm detecting a small object. It appears to be the source of the rust and hydrocarbons.  JANEWAY: Put it on screen. Magnify.   (They all stare at one of Henry Ford's products, floating in space.)   After it's beamed to the cargo bay, it's clear that no time has passed for Tom to examine the vehicle and perhaps replicate new fuel, though it's possible it could have thawed out?

A good question about their relationship would be: Why did it take Riker like ten years after being on the Enterprise, and about like twelve years after his career had begun to stall after he started refusing promotions, to finally start getting back together with Troi? Like they're just friends for well over a decade, and then one day they're studying reports on the Baku people together and they decide to start taking baths together and shaving each other.  Maybe Troi hit the Betazoid high sex-drive phase early because she's half-human, and Riker was feeling frisky because he's Riker and also the magic youth radiation, and that's all it took to break the ice after all that time.  I buy their relationship in Insurrection and Nemesis more than I did the Troi-Worf thing though. I mean that was a weird one."

They're a long-lived people (150-160 years, on average), and even though she's half-human, she seems to favor her Betazoid heritage more fully (appearance, empathy, etc.), so it would stand to reason that her hormonal and emotional development might be closer to their timeline than hours. A human woman in her 30s would be somewhat more likely to want to start settling down, but a Betazoid woman in her 30s might see dating a guy like Worf as being an interesting life experience."

Actually, I don't think it's really weird from Troi's perspective (I mean maybe in the ""Parallels"" universes where they were married, but I guess the point of that episode was that anything can happen) -- they just went on a couple of dates, after all.  But Worf seems to take even the prospect of dating a lot more seriously, and also the women he seems to find attractive (Kehleyr, Jadzia, Grilka) are all pretty different from Troi. I just have a hard time seeing him with her, and certainly not pining away after her memory like in ""All Good Things."""

He is culturally, though not biologically, of mixed heritage, which creates a sort of internal conflict that Deanna would...erm...empathize with very well, her talents notwithstanding. He also holds his Klingon culture in high esteem, but has a certain understanding of more typical norms of cultural expression by dint of his human upbringing.   I think that being with someone who could understand the sort of internal conflict he experiences and could have a literal insider's perspective of it, who can respect his fondness for his Klingon ways while also being able to clearly see how they are tempered with humanity, and being able to support and empower him, to help him better himself in all these ways, would be extremely gratifying for him.   Throw a little bit of transference in the mix, pour on some of his gruff charm, and their attempt at a romantic relationship makes perfect sense, as does their continued deep and meaningful friendship when their romantic hopes lapse.  They never would have worked in the long run, because he's not her Imzadi and their chemistry was never quite there, but it was good for them to explore that aspect of themselves, and their togetherness."

At some point both decided that their professional careers took precedent and that it would suit them better to retreat to being friends - which I find understandable and mature, to be honest.  Cue ten years later and they are suddenly bombarded with some kind of radiation that regenerates people, makes them younger and even brings out puberty symptoms in Klingons. They are both, basically, intoxicated when they decide to act on their feelings in Insurrection, but after those events they also decide to stick with their rekindled love.

A small strike team of 3-5 tactical officers with phasers set to stun would be able to blitz in, capture the Ferengi, and leave within a matter of moments.  The town might hear some commotion but they wouldn't see anything.

Probably useful to know that early.  Kill Neelix because he's a time waster.  Arturis is the guy from Hope and Fear who royally screwed them. It'd save some time to just know he's not telling the truth.  Stardate 54553.4 was the day they got sucked into the Void. They were moving at the time, so I figure they'd probably be far enough away from the entrance if I told them not to move the ship at all that day. Saves some time in the Void, if so. Obviously this is assuming they didn't catch any of the other hints dropped, because events would be occurring much quicker with the Neelix, Arturis and Seska hints.  Everything from here on out is a direct solution to the problem, rather than a quibble.  The Barzan wormhole is obvious.  Stealing a Voth ship is probably sort of a risky one, but their transwarp tech is fast. That'd shave insane amounts of time off their journey.  Stealing the transwarp coils without Seven makes Dark Frontier never happen. They wasted probably half of the coil's durability on the rescue mission. It could've been used to bring Voyager even further ahead, rather than the back and forth to the Unicomplex.  The Equinox hint is probably my favorite one because it's the most chilling. The Equinox was able to boost their engine capacity and reach much higher speeds with the nucleogenic compounds and Voyager could've benefitted too, were it not for their morality getting in the way. Rescinding the Prime Directive gets rid of that morality.  Ignore Vaadwaur...again, an obvious one. Would've shaved off at least a few weeks.

If the timelines truly did diverge with Nero's arrival seconds before the 2009 film begins, then George Sr. and Winona were already a family before they left.

Roughly speaking, it goes like this:   There's a lot of time travel back to times before Kirk's birth, many of which had to be carefully managed to make sure history repeated to within tolerances of 'close enough.' Even if those specific time travel events don't happen, time travel is common enough that some time travel is eventually going to happen, and with a smaller, more desperate Starfleet crew who may not be able to afford to be as careful.   Either the failure of future events to cause the right time loops, or future events causing the 'wrong' time loops, will alter history sufficiently that   James Kirk was not born on earth The Kelvin's interior design and computer technology is far in advance of where it 'should' be. There are many more aliens in the Federation than there 'ought' to be. It's Starfleet already, not the United Earth Space Probe Agency. and so on."

DaystromInstitute,3aibxd,gerryblog,19,Sat Jun 20 13:37:35 2015 UTC,"Of the late 20th Century, Admiral Kirk once said, ""this is an extremely primitive and paranoid culture."" Spock was able to determine they were in the correct era by ""the pollution content of the atmosphere."" Our legacy was known well to denizens of the 23rd century -but only in legend.  After Khan came Colonel Green, ""who led a genocidal war early in the 21st century on Earth"" according to the Excalbians. This was no longer perfecting humanity through eugenics, it was culling the herd. Humanity devolved into tyranny and self-destruction a handful of decades after Kirk's brief visit to 1980's Earth and while he knew we were not the bloodthirsty scavengers of the Post Atomic Horror, he knew we were destined very soon to easily and swiftly become them.  But the post-atomic horror did happen. Spock said of Khan's time, "" Your Earth was on the verge of a dark ages. Whole populations were being bombed out of existence."" I don't believe he was being hyperbolic when he said we were on the verge of a dark age. He wasn't alluding to us potentially falling into a dark ages, he was indicating factually that Khan's era came before the Post-Atomic Horror -a dark age.   ""There are a great many unanswered questions about those years."" Kirk said in Space Seed. Because we did fall into a dark age, by its very nature it means we lost so much of our history and education. I submit they don't know anything about the 20th century and mainly because very little from our time survived the wars and the dark age to follow. Longer held, more enduring cultural information carried on but the brief 20th century anomaly that is our culture simply did not. It was too digital, too disposable, too insubstantial to endure what Spock referred to as ""a strange violent period"" in Earth history.  So what survived? Aside from a few literary works or the like, what endured was a deeply felt and long-held resentment for the selfishness and the barbarism of the time before the dark ages. The stories and legends that passed on after paint us, in this little understood era, with one brush -as the generation that failed, that got it wrong, that nearly destroyed the world. I'm not surprised that anyone but an historian would be particularly interested in our popular culture and I doubt very much of it survived the cataclysm."
DaystromInstitute,3aibxd,ademnus,2,Sat Jun 20 17:02:45 2015 UTC,"In ST IV, ""extremely primitive and paranoid"" could have been emphasized a lot more considering they recently dealt with Khan for the second time and that his time in the period was approaching."

I think Khan actually was successful at putting into place reforms that society, on the verge of a dark age, desperately needed. He did so by crushing dissent, because the truth is democracy isn't terribly efficient, it's not always great at handling large problems, and his way was the only way to get the job done. It's reprehensible to the Enterprise crew because it goes against their values, but even they have to admit that he did some of the right things at a time when everyone else was letting the world fall apart."

DaystromInstitute,3aibxd,adamkotsko,13,Sat Jun 20 15:47:18 2015 UTC,"Well, two things: first, this gets into the notoriously thorny issue about what we're supposed to do with the fact that the Eugenics Wars never happened in the 1990s like they were supposed to. But second, and I think more importantly for this argument, the Federation sees what appears to us as a peaceful era as an brief interregnum between horrific world wars. According to Star Trek canon the Atomic Horror that will destroy all our political institutions is coming in the next few decades.  As a side note, the claim that the world is more peaceful than ever is contested, to say the least. America has been at war with someone or another, for instance, nearly every year that all of us have been alive. When you add into this the needless suffering caused by unequal distribution of wealth and widespread ecological devastation, it's easy to see why the future would view us negatively despite the fact that by one measure (deaths due to violent conflict) we've had a decently good run the last few decades."
DaystromInstitute,3aibxd,willbell,3,Sat Jun 20 16:18:37 2015 UTC,"Well, today isn't the same timeline as Star Trek. According to Star Trek, Khan led a eugenics war with super-humans in 1996. Since that never happened to us, we are clearly in an alternate time line.  That said, we have to look at their timeline to understand our appraisal of it. They do see us as barbaric, though no more or less than Khan, but they see us that way for a reason. According to the timeline of Star Trek, we ""bombed whole populations out of existence."" We then had a nuclear war that nearly destroyed the entire world. After that, we fell into a dark ages where we purposely addicted soldiers to drugs and waged even darker wars and perpetuated genocide until humanity decided to learn from the mistakes of its history rather than continue them. This is not our present, we are on a different timeline. Although we may yet have that barbarism still as our future. It remains a vital component of the narrative of Star Trek now as it was in the 60s; that we have a potential future of peace and space exploration awaiting us if we can just stop destroying ourselves."
DaystromInstitute,3agxhl,Spikekuji,71,Sat Jun 20 02:02:43 2015 UTC,"Currently, she is stone dead, which could be considered unfit for duty but then Spock died, Scotty died, and Data was never alive and they all served just fine.  That said, consider that her replacement, Worf, was ""quick to anger, leading to escalations of tensions which is not an asset when dealing with new species or delicate diplomatic missions."" He is impatient, judgmental, lacks rational and critical thinking skills and is willing to shoot a viewscreen if he thinks the face on it is menacing in some way.  So it was probably a job requirement.  Ok, got all of that out of my system -let's be serious.  Generally speaking, it's been my experience that a great many people in law enforcement type positions, military or otherwise, are naturally aggressive people. I think it's a requirement for the job in a sense. Troubled police officers or MPs, with aggressive tendencies and difficult upbringings are so commonplace they have become hackneyed tropes on television -which Tasha and Worf in their own ways fell prey to as characters. Tasha's failed colony and rape gangs transmuted to Worf's single parent woes and misunderstood-adopted-son-from a-foreign-culture upbringing. But does it make them unfit for the job?  Well, in one sense, yes. Anyone who has serious flaws like impulsiveness or aggression is ill-suited to positions of great responsibility. Maybe they'd pass as a security team member but not the bridge officer and department head. But while we dislike those qualities in leaders today, we certainly have them so is it unrealistic that the Enterprise have an officer who has flaws? Not at all. There is one common denominator, however, between both of them;  Jean-Luc Picard.  Jean-Luc requested Sito Jaxa for the Enterprise to give her a fair chance to prove herself after the academy incident. He gave Ro Laren a chance to become a fine officer when everyone hated her. He fought his ex-lover over Data's rights, after allowing an android not legally established as a person yet to serve as his bridge officer. He also met Tasha Yar and decided she should have a chance to be on his ship even though he knew StarFleet hadn't agreed. And he promoted Worf against what was probably everyone's better judgement when Tasha died. Because that's what he does -he fights for the underdog, the unproven and the unwanted.  So, yes, Tasha was in many ways not the ideal officer for the job. But he wasn't interested in having the best at the time -he was interested in forging the best. It seems to me he believed the very best officers were always diamonds in the rough and he seemed to like to seek them out and take them along like foundlings, turning them into ""the finest crew in StarFleet."""

Her quickness to action was a slight liability on diplomatic missions (and when she occasionally pointed her phaser at the viewscreen if it showed someone she didn't like) but it's equally likely that she earned medals and distinctions previously.  Recall that several of the Enterprise crew have served in ground actions during the Cardassian war - O'Brien and Ro Larren stand out as having notable experiences.

In ""All Good Things"" she questioned Picard's judgement, but in the end she carried out what would seems to her as outrageous orders.

DaystromInstitute,3agxhl,Em-Power-Me,3,Sat Jun 20 03:46:13 2015 UTC,Agreed. We saw development of other characters on TNG; Yar simply wasn't around [alive] long enough to develop
DaystromInstitute,3agxhl,lessthanpi,8,Sat Jun 20 21:47:22 2015 UTC,"If I were to suggest Tasha Yar was unfit for duty, it would only be because of the amount of hand-holding the character seemed to require. It's likely due to the writing of the first season, but I remember thinking how she too often has to spell out her concerns, fears, or strategy to a higher command for approval or comfort instead of taking initiative for her own well-being. I would argue that an officer at her level should be more refined in making judgment calls, or could at least be direct when seeking advice.  To me, the breakdown of the ship archetypes categorized Yar as the young sproutling -- bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, just waiting for guidance and approval. Usually we see this in a male character. We see other officers letting their personal lives potentially interfere with their duty, but because they fit into these defined archetypes, we accept them a little bit more easily.  We will accept that a mother will be emotionally charged when her boy is in danger. We will accept that a first officer will be fueled with ire and 'tude when the crew and his captain are being questioned without explanation. We will accept that Data will strut into an opportunity for discovery and use android kung fu to safely dismantle a threat. We will accept our brave captain's error of willingly accepting an old ship back into his life despite suspicious circumstances. We will accept a child would get himself into trouble or be a boy genius. We will accept a sensitive empath to be the feminine voice. We will accept the defensive warrior to be aggressive and distant.  Why? Because these are very predictable archetypes that we support and enjoy as an audience. We have room for parental instincts, loyalty, curiosity, youth, etc to get in the way of sound reasoning. What seems to be Tasha Yar's unfortunate downfall is that audiences and writers have been catered to her archetype -- the brash youngster from a rough upbringing struggling to be a better person -- to be more fit for a male character.  Instead, we have Tasha Yar crying in front of our stoic captain early on. We have her admitting all her deep fears and broken past lives haunting her during a time when we expect all Starfleet officers to be pulled together. We have her flexing her inferior decision-making skills during dangerous times when we expect more out of an officer. We see her being confident and appropriately defensive, then entirely vulnerable and broken.  It's not unlike stories we are treated to throughout the series. We watch Riker crumble in his own subconsciousness. Picard breaks and rebuilds and breaks and rebuilds. Worf is tossed into a targ stampede with his identity. Data is constantly trying to understand his purpose.  However, Tasha Yar had the unfortunate timing of hitting all the wham-bam character developing points when we weren't invested into the character and the writing wasn't as solid. In my opinion, we see this situation with Deanna Troi, too. She's so feminine that it's hard not to write anything but romance fluffy duffy plots for her. Tasha Yar wasn't meant to be like Troi or Crusher -- two very maternal characters... but she had some very progressive plot points written very clumsily on fresh soil. And so, we remain critical of a character who didn't get a good chance to develop.  Oh dear...I'msosorryforthenovel."
DaystromInstitute,3agxhl,Berggeist,3,Sat Jun 20 08:02:50 2015 UTC,"Don't apologize at all. It's completely right. Tasha as written is all over the place, and it's way too much way too soon - before we even have time to know her we've seen her frozen by Q, in lust, attempting sexual healing of her traumatic past with a robot, then kidnapped by a planet of unfortunate casting decisions and that's three episodes into the show. I think the fact that the second episode of TNG being an episode where everyone acts out of character before their character is even firmly established is a perfect symptom of first season writing tripping over its own intentions.  Tasha could have been done right with a slower pacing and a lot more opportunities to be good at her job, but with the Tasha we had in the first season there are times I wonder how TNG would have fared had Denise Crosby stayed on. If Tasha had been executed well, she might have become iconic - her base story has the potential for a lot of nuance with a thoughtful rewrite.   That being said I can't help but wonder if her job on the E-D is ""cursed"" from a screenwriting perspective. How many times does Worf get knocked aside to show how tough the threat is? Would Tasha have been the Charlie Brown of the ship?"
DaystromInstitute,3agxhl,haujob,5,Mon Jun 22 11:01:51 2015 UTC,"I find this idea very curious, in the sense that it's a specifically non-military view of things.  To wit: there is no world where an American General (or Admiral, or what-have-you) got to his/her position by being a ""good little boy/girl"". This idea of sucking-off your superiors and never making a ruckus is rank propaganda.  You rise in the ranks by being an ass. A competent ass, to be sure, but an ass, none the less.  Was Picard the tempered sage because he didn't get stabbed in the heart in a bar brawl? Nope. And no Starfleet consequences came of it. Because being an anti-Vulcan is what Starfleet wants. Picard feels from his gut, shoots from the hip, all those cute cliches. And he became the captain of the flagship because he wasn't a little bitch.  Yar, arguably, was a bitch. But she wasn't a little bitch. She had a purpose, a drive, a want to become something better than what she had to, had to, leave behind.  All things considered, she would have made a better captain than Janeway, if things had turned out differently. She was everything Starfleet purported it wasn't.  And that's what made her everything Starfleet needed. And that's why she was on the Enterprise. She was Tom Paris before Tom Paris. The rogue, the outsider, the trouble.  And she was perfect for her role, in a Roddenberry Trek that still understood that the knave was also a noble. Redemption was his bag, man. Of humanity in the meta, and the individual characters as the plot device.  I didn't like seeing her go. I liked it even less when I found out it was shitty IRL contract negotiation stuff. But her character, as designed by folk Roddenberry trusted with the property, was exactly how she should have been: broken, with nothing other than hope showing through the cracks."
DaystromInstitute,3agxhl,Berggeist,3,Sat Jun 20 04:35:26 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Tasha would have easily become stronger through the series and achieved, especially with the changes in the series as it continued to develop from changes in staff and Roddenberry's death. In a different world there could have easily been a two parter about riots on her homeworld and a deep plot about another call for independence. This could have had a lot of great hooks. How does Tasha feel when confronted by people who don't appreciate the Federation how she does, even after receiving the benefits? Does Tasha ever consider why the Federation allowed things to get so bad before stepping in? Does she ever consider whether her decision to join Starfleet was a youthful mistake? How does her family and her homeworld view her, returning as an accomplished Starfleet officer? How does she come to terms with the differences in who she is then and now? Even with so many stand-alone episodes, TNG managed to do slow-burn character storylines over the long haul - Worf and his identity, Data evolving as an android, even Wesley growing up right into the role expected of him before he up and backpacks across Galactic Europe with The Traveller.  The seeds were there, but I guess not all of them take."

Officers that didn't believe in the no-win scenario?  I'd argue that in Picard's era, Prime Starfleet was in a sense atrophied - it wasn't Prime Kirk's world anymore (e.g. peace with Klingons?), and as such Picard himself exemplified a higher aspiration (perhaps) of less militarism and more galactic archaeology and exploration. But then he is transformed over time, and at the end, Enterprise is engaged in some pretty serious galactic (and temporal) wars.   Therefore - Tasha Yar died before her temper would best serve the tactical and practical needs of Starfleet. She's self-sacrificial. Sort of Joan-of-Arc."
DaystromInstitute,3ahhlw,wikipediareader,23,Sat Jun 20 05:45:19 2015 UTC,"It seems like a job requirement, in the Starfleet of the 24th Century, to be a keen antiquarian.  They listen to and play music that is centuries old, quote Shakespeare, and play Sherlock Holmes, Robin Hood, and prohibition-era gangsters on the holodeck.  Old culture is highly valued--probably because it's only pre-colonization-era culture that is reliably shared between all Human worlds of the Federation.    Five-card stud would have an allure exactly because it is the oldest variant.  Being the 'original' would give it a certain cachet--make it more authentic.  Out of universe, I expect it was chosen for its simplicity and dramatic usefulness.  The audience only has to be familiar with the barest rudiments of the game to get the scene, and there's nothing getting in the way of the writers making direct character statements by their choices to fold or bet."

Their interest in the twentieth century tops out around the invention of the nuclear bomb, and most of what they value from our cultural (classical music, certain games) is far older than that. And it's very easy to see why -- from their perspective we were suicidally self-destructive monsters who very nearly destroyed the future.

There was that one episode with the parasites that took over a Holodeck version of the Orient Express... On Enterprise, Movie Night regularly showed ""classics"" from the mid 20th Century. On Voyager, Tom Paris was obsessed with 1950s Americana... B'Elanna even built him a TV Set once. There's also his Captain Proton holonovels, which are reminiscent of the old Flash Gordon serials. Being fair, his interest is considered ""eccentric"" but it's hardly treated like ""Nazi or Slaveowner Cosplay"". Vic Fontaine's Casino in Quark's holosuites, set in 1960s Las Vegas. Though in fairness they do address the racism thing, but Sisko is seen as holding on to the past too tightly and not ""he's right, it would be wrong for us to enjoy this"". Sisko's obsession with Baseball (a largely 20th Century Sport) Bashir's Bond-style holosuite programs. Which the rest of the crew thought was fun and eventually played them with him. Bashir and O'Brian recreating the Battle of London air battle from WWII.   So yeah... Your entire premise is flat out wrong.  Edit: Every time I walk away, I think of something else :) There are tons of references to parts of the 20th Century.

I do find the variants with more cards on the table easier because there is more information for me and there is (in respect to the total number of cards) less hidden information.   I think that a society that values intelligence and ability over emotional stability (Barclay, Paris), would prefer a variant that relies less on hidden information and bluffing than logic.

The pod's onboard computer specifically warns him of the dangerous environment, yet Kirk continues out into the wilderness anyway.  In all likelihood Kirk knew that Delta Vega had dangerous underwater life, but few species that could survive the surface. If you notice, Big Red can barely keep up with Kirk on land, sputtering and slipping on its clearly aquatic legs (they highlight this in the film's commentary).  Being hotheaded and impatient at the time, Kirk risked traversing the tundra rather than waiting for Starfleet to come and take him into custody. It's in-character for him to take such a risk.  Alternatively, in a world where all information on a planet can be recalled and referred to instantly, there's little gained by memorizing the fauna of every planet, espece those already charted that you in all likelihood will never visit.

I'd say that's the most likely explanation here. Kirk may have learned about Delta Vega and just forgotten about it. It wouldn't have been particularly useful information at the time anyway unless he knew in advance he was going to be there at some point.

Federation law entitles individuals to complete control over their bodies and its DNA, especially if that DNA is used against the owners consent.  The second explanation is that Federation law differentiates ""murder"" based on sentience/consciousness. The Riker and Pulaski clones weren't complete yet, they weren't conscious and thus hadn't been ""born"" yet. In such a state, technically all Riker did was perform an abortion.

Picard complies.  ""Star Trek Insurrection"": Picard discovers a plot to remove an entire village of people from a planet. The plan is sponsored by the Federation and overseen by Starfleet Admiral Hanson, who orders Picard back to Federation space. Picard and some of the senior Enterprise officers begin an Insurrection and actively interfere in this plan.  I mean, really not much had changed between that episode and that movie. Picard even lectures the Admiral on how wrong it is to forcibly relocate a people, not matter their population size or level of technological advancement.   It just always bothered me how damn similar these situations were, and when push came to shove, Picard took wildly polar opposite actions.  Actually, another TNG episode comes to mind, season 3's weirdly named ""Ensigns of Command"". This episode took place before both of the above incidents, and was a pretty similar situation. Picard settled right in the middle for a stalemate by the time that episode ended."
DaystromInstitute,3afgjj,disposable_pants,21,Mon Jun 22 14:01:17 2015 UTC,"Regarding the relocation of human settlers in at the end of the war with Cardassia and the events in Insurrection, the two situations are actually pretty different:   The settlers on the border with Cardassian space are Federation citizens and thus subject to Federation law -- there's ample legal precedent for the government forcing its own citizens to move (eminent domain, condemning buildings, etc.).  Morally, those citizens had input in the decision to move them but just didn't win their case.  Practically, fighting against the relocation would risk war and potentially millions of deaths. The Ba'ku in Insurrection were not part of the Federation and neither were the other species trying to displace them -- the Federation had no jurisdiction there.  Morally, the other species was subjecting the Ba'ku to relocation against their will and without giving the Ba'ku any input into the decision.  Practically, there was no large evil (war) being averted by relocation -- it was being done for self-serving reasons.   I can fully understand the different reactions to these situations."

Both situations are morally wrong and Picard adresses this both times. However, he also recognizes that the morality of an act also must include the consequences of that act, which in the case of the human settlers was a war with Cardassia.   But here is the kicker, had Picard been faced with similar terrible consequences from relocating the Ba'Ku, he would have never done so. The reason for this is as /u/disposable_pants stated, namely that the Federation had jurisdiction over the human settlers, putting Picard in a place to make the decision for them in which he from that same position had to look at the larger picture. In that particular situation, he simply could not have done anything else. This is adressed in the solution, where the human settlers choose to give up Federation citizenship.  So I think that whereas both situations are clearly very similar, the actions of Picard are perfectly rational and moral in both cases and were different only because the situations demanded it."

If the Ba'ku achieved warp flight (before we knew they already could) and suddenly discovered themselves in the middle of Federation space, it's probable that the Federation would negotiate with the Ba'ku, either offering them Federation membership or recognising their right to self-determination and withdrawn their borders out of the Ba'ku solar system (sort of like how Vatican city is technically it's own state within the larger Italian state)."

It's less clear had the planet been just outside Federation space whether or not Starfleet would have stopped the Son'a.

VOY takes a stance for assisted suicide, with Quin making the case that death should be a choice when life has lost its value.  Both are really great episodes on the topic."
DaystromInstitute,3afgjj,BigTaker,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:32:32 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Picard is in favour of assisted suicide."
DaystromInstitute,3afgjj,sindeloke,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:07:53 2015 UTC,"I think the kicker in ""Ethics"" was simply that Worf hadn't properly thought it through. Typically people who go through major trauma, like the loss of a relative, a limb, a marriage, or anything of a similar level of significance, take about six months to get back to a rational equilibrium. Up until then you can expect serious depression and, along with it, seriously impaired judgement. Worf was all of what, three days in?  They side-step the issue by putting him through the surgery, but it seemed to me that the message of Riker forcing him to turn to Alexander, and Worf being unwilling to do that, was that Worf still had other priorities above his own death (like his son's well-being), and just needed time to reconcile them. Given time to adjust, he might have made a different decision.  Quinn, on the other hand, wasn't depressed and hadn't gone through any noteworthy life changes. He was attempting a carefully considered revolutionary sociopolitical act. Janeway questions him pretty extensively and doesn't turn up any sign that he's coerced or his judgement is in any way impaired, so she decides it's his call. Worf under the same circumstances would likely have been afforded the same courtesy by his friends (not just Jean-Luc ""Cultural Relativism"" Picard)."
DaystromInstitute,3afgjj,BigTaker,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:57:34 2015 UTC,"There was a culturally aspect to it too:  PICARD: I understand from Doctor Crusher that Worf will never regain the use of his legs.  RIKER: That doesn't mean his life is over.   PICARD: That's a very human perspective, Will. For a Klingon in Worf's position, his life is over.   RIKER: I can't accept that.   PICARD: Will, if you were dying, if you were terminally ill with an incurable disease and facing the remaining few days of your life in pain, wouldn't you come to look on death as a release?   RIKER: Worf isn't dying and he is not in pain. He could live a long life   PICARD: You or I could learn to live with that disability, but not Worf. His life ended when those containers fell on him. We don't have to agree with it, we don't have to understand it, but we do have to respect his beliefs."
DaystromInstitute,3afgjj,MageTank,4,Sun Jun 21 15:42:16 2015 UTC,"Though Archer's actions are by no way the right course, I believe it's a little more understandable. The Caatati had been drifting about the quadrant, presumably surviving on the kindness of strangers for years. They had resources, albeit minimal. Without changing their mindset and start finding a way to support themselves, they would likely continue. Would ALL of Voyager's resources and a chance to beat up Seven of Nine saved their race? No, it would have just been a very small stopgap measure. On the other hand, Archer needed the coil for a very specific reason. There was a super weapon out to blow up Earth and he needed the coil to prevent a very specific impending disaster. What if the Caatati had told Voyager ""if you don't give us your stuff, we're all going to die, like right now""?"
DaystromInstitute,3afgjj,BonzoTheBoss,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:49:24 2015 UTC,"I agree, I don't think the scenarios are directly comparable. the Caatati still had ships, presumably warp-capable (because otherwise how did they catch up to Voyagers warp core after they dumped it? They were travelling at warp if I recall), so they could have found a habitable planet somewhere to settle, or at least gather resources on. Their situation was dire, but not urgently so.  As opposed to the Xindi threat, where they suspected the weapon may be deployed any day now and destroy their entire planet, which would (apart from a few long-haulage cargo ships and isolated colonies) cause humanity to become extinct. We saw the implications of Xindi success in ""ENT: Twilight""."

The third leaves half the Klingon empire worshiping a clone with the message that it's not just valid, but even important to be true to your faith, even when things shake it.

DaystromInstitute,3afgjj,BonzoTheBoss,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:48:31 2015 UTC,"I think there's slight differences between the first two episodes you mention and the last. The former deals purely with Federation cultural values (even specifically, Picards) and the obvious possibility that Ardra was a fraud. Also those were only individual planets that had no affect on the wider galactic community.  The latter deals with Klingon culture which, arguably, has religion at its core. Not religious worship of deities, but of Kahless and his ideals of honour and conquest. These things are deeply ingrained into contemporary Klingon behaviour. You could say reinforcing the ideals of ""honour"" (real honour, the kind Worf practices) in a steadily declining society is a good thing. The corruption of the Duras family is well known, but it was also just the tip of the ice berg, the culmination of decades, even centuries of societal decline.  Introducing the Kahless clone as a figurehead could potentially bring stability to the empire, and a more stable empire is better for everyone. Also there's the fact that Kahless was (probably) real, and while doubtless his exploits are exaggerated, personified in his clone is the chance for real unifcation between the houses.  Of course this all sort of falls apart when you consider the actions of the empire in DS9, invading Cardassia (""there is no greater honour in war than victory"") and declaring war on the Federation. Conversely that could have been prompted by the Founder infiltrators but still."

He's a bully who takes what he needs because he thinks that he and his quest is more important than other people.  I agree; the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few (or the one) but he could have easily have promised to come back with an even better warp drive, saying ""We'll give you this shiny new Warp 5 drive, it'll save you two weeks off your trip"".  He's still a horrible person and should have asked the vulcans or andorians to take care of it, but Archer was superman, so he needed to do it himself.

DaystromInstitute,3afgjj,jimmysilverrims,9,Sun Jun 21 15:59:05 2015 UTC,"Well, in the episode's defense they're pretty upfront about how Archer stealing from them was a Bad Thing.   Fellow officers and respected criticise him, the victimed crew is portrayed very sympathetically, and in general this is presented as a really, terribly dark period in Archer's life.  That said, I always found it odd that they didn't come back and say ""Sorry"". I expected it to be at the resolution of the Xindi Arc, but all we got there was... blue Nazis. :/"
DaystromInstitute,3afgjj,disposable_pants,6,Thu Jun 25 13:22:33 2015 UTC,"Archer doesn't bother to even make it up to them by coming back in a month   There could be many legitimate reasons why this wasn't shown:   The Enterprise could have returned, but no mention of it was made The Enterprise could have returned, but the alien ship was gone (maybe it was rescued or destroyed) The crew of the alien ship may have told the Enterprise that they'd run out of food soon if left adrift -- why go back in a month if you knew they would be dead in a day? The alien ship may have been too far away to reasonably rescue at the end of the mission -- didn't the Enterprise wind up back at Earth at the conclusion of the Xindi arc? The Enterprise could have made arrangements with the Xindi/some other species to contact the ship instead of them   In short, it may be more complicated than ""they could have gone back but didn't because they were mean.""  And there's no way he could promise them a new Warp 5 drive, let alone easily promise that -- Earth only had one Warp 5 ship at that point and the Enterprise was falling apart around them.   He's a bully who takes what he needs because he thinks that he and his quest is more important than other people.   The second half of this statement challenges the ""bully"" assertion -- it's repeatedly made clear that he's knowingly engaging in wrongdoing only because humanity may not survive if he doesn't.     He's still a horrible person and should have asked the vulcans or andorians to take care of it   Something in that area of space drove Vulcans insane (their High Command was asked for help and declined) and the Andorians weren't allies yet."
DaystromInstitute,3afgjj,BonzoTheBoss,2,Fri Jun 19 19:35:14 2015 UTC,"Something in that area of space drove Vulcans insane   It was the Trellium-D.

Exposure to Trellium-D was fatal to Vulcans, causing a degredation of their neural pathways, leading to paranoia, violence and eventually death."
DaystromInstitute,3aelqd,adamkotsko,48,Fri Jun 19 14:21:44 2015 UTC,"I've always felt like one of the biggest missed opportunities in Trek is how they never really gave proper consideration to the lifestyle of the Borg.   The Federation is grossly spoiled with how dominant the ""essentially human but..."" lifestyle is throughout the galaxy. For all the grand speeches and pontification of the vast complexity of the universe, the final frontier is pretty simply populated.  One sentient species to a planet. Humanoid. Cultures with barriers no worse than the cultural divides between peoples in Earth's own history. In fact, there's very little out there that we haven't alread experienced or imagined down here.  Every exception to that is treated as just that: An exception. The Milky Way of Star Trek is a realm where men live alongside men, and the ways of other beasts are either barely explored or completely absent.  The Borg are the sole exception to this. They are the other way of life in the galaxy. The only alternative to our own culture with enough numbers to make them too hard to ignore.  But even then, they're only treated as an ""other"". They're a plague, a monster, an unstoppable force of conformity. So often they're presented this way that we forget that the Borg are also life.  I can imagine, perhaps in the Mirror Universe, a Borg that practices good PR. Their philosophy is, in its own way, a bit zen. Connecting all species together in flawless harmony. Sharing all advancement in even distribution throughout all who've joined. Expanding through the universe and sharing everything learned along the way with each member that joins into the fold.   Hell, the Cybertronian religion centers around the credo ""Til all are one"", and isn't that what the Borg seek too? I feel like it's both a valid way of life and something that others would be drawn to.  As for whether the drones are happy, they aren't. Not to say that they're unhappy because it's equally apparent they aren't that either. They simply don't experience individual or even collective emotion. But they wouldn't be the first philosophy that feels emotions and even a concept of the self needs to be shed away to achieve a greater state of being."

She constantly talks about the confidence and purpose that the Borg gave her, she at first speaks of permanent disconnection as a trauma she can't bear, etc., etc. Her experience seems to be somewhat unique due to the young age at which she was assimilated, but it can't be totally unrepresentative.  Her continued embrace of Borgness even after deciding irrevocably in favor of individual humanity shows exactly the kind of empathetic imagination you're calling for. It's kind of like how Archer, after carrying Surak's katra, belatedly admits on behalf of all of Star Trek that the Vulcans weren't just pointlessly repressing their emotions, but that there was something to it...."

Animals have a contented state of no-mind that exists because they cannot have thoughts. I would consider them generally happy (free of suffering even if not free of pain). Normal people are dominated by their individual mind, by their thoughts. They suffer due to their own ego. (They have both pain and suffering). An ""enlightened"" person has a contented state of no-mind that comes from quieting the mind. They are mindful and live in the moment and are not ruled by their egos and thoughts. The live in silence in their heads. (They have pain, but choose not to suffer, therefore they are happy too).   The Borg are a very different type of mind. They have one mind, but that means each individual has a state of no-mind constantly. However they don't have silence in their head, they have white noise. They cannot be swept up in their individual thoughts or perceptions because there are billions of other thoughts and perceptions. They have no suffering, they live in the moment and don't create suffering.   So, yes, as I would measure it they are happy.   But to the ego dominated minds of the federation they are scary. Only to someone who believes that even their own name is an illusion do the Borg make any sense.   However, I will have to mull over the nature of the hive mind. It does have ego. Can the collective suffer while the individual is free?"

The only time we see drones exhibiting emotion is when they're disconnected, and that tends to be fear and/or confusion more than anything else (usually when the memories previously suppressed by the collective flood back).  Seven of Nine might be the lone exception. When she was on Voyager she was clearly showing agitation/irritation, but that might have been a reflection/projection of the Collective's feeling's as well.  My theory is that Unimatrix Zero developed from these suppressed emotions/personalities. You've connected everyone's conscious minds together, but the subconscious mind came with it and formed it's own sort of collective in the form of a Dream World for individual drones to live/explore as their individual selves.

Sometimes surviving isn't just about being alive at the end of the day, it's about ensuring you'll stay alive in the long run. It's about being the biggest fish and having the best antibodies. It's also about diversifying. It's well known that evolutionary chains tend to survive the elements because of diversity and exposing a pool of organisms to something completely alien produces genetic abnormalities that will better weather the unpredictable nature of the universe. Assimilation is a process that streamlines the act of diversifying, though in a way I believe they are missing the point. They won't change the way they are thinking or the way they do things, they strip off useful information and throw away the rest."

They have the opportunity to explore and learn, much like the Federation and others, but they have come to the conclusion that their directive is the best way, the only way, and have determined all arguments that come to different conclusions to be flawed, or based on irrelevant concerns. Happiness is not relevant, as only the advancement towards their ideal matters - if happiness helped them towards that goal, they would be happy. The Collective has determined that it will not assist them, and until new information is presented, they are unlikely to reconsider it, as contemplation is wasteful when you already know (or at least, have decided) that your truth is the only truth that matters.  Your initial statement about drones being happy is interesting, but I think it bypasses the reality of a drone - they are no longer allowed their own thoughts. They are forced, as part of the process/the result of assimilation, to believe in the purpose of the Collective, and to always be committed to its goals and needs.

Whatever philosophy the Borg hive mind ascribes to is one such philosophy, where the pursuit of ""perfection"" takes precedence over happiness.  Who are we to say they're wrong? (aside from being individuals who don't want to be forcibly stripped of our free will)  I've often thought that an interesting take on the Borg would be if they were happy, in some sort of lotus eater thing.  Like if everyone who was a drone spent all their time in Unimatrix Zero mixed with the Matrix mixed with personalized heaven.  So it's not a black and white ""Freedom vs. Slavery"", but a more nuanced ""Personal choice and reality vs. Pure happiness in a simulation and subsumed purpose for the collective whole"".

Maybe the word I'm looking for is plasticity.  The Borg do have a kind of sturdiness, but it is one that is largely built on force of arms.  When Hugh does not have the military power of the Borg backing him up, he's easily shocked by the rather simple idea that resistance is not futile.  The Borg's form of life is much more brittle than, say, the Federation's form of life.  Quark points out that when humans don't have their creature comforts, they become savages - but that sort of breakdown results from a radical change in material conditions, not a failure in their form of life.  Quark makes another good point when he talks about the Federation being like root beer, killing you with kindness.  I forget the exact quote, but the Federation makes you like them.  Resistance is every bit as futile as it is with the Borg, but the assimilation is a far more permanent sort because Federation values get internalized in a way that Borg values are not.  Borg values require physical implants; Federation values just require you to like root beer.  My point is that Federation values are easily internalized and therefore far more plastic; they offer their own version of confidence and conviction that the Borg cannot even aspire to.  And that confidence and conviction is a vital part of any viable form of life, and a viable form of life is necessary for anything resembling happiness.

And later, when some of the Borg were taken in by Lorr, they showed anger towards the crew for instilling that sense of self. They didn't feel free, they definitely were not happy. I think it really showed that if they were to be reintegrated into the collective, they would have actually understood happiness as we do. You never fully appreciate what you have until you no longer have it. They didn't know anything else was possible until Hue was taken in by the crew, and then returned.

The other is comparatively small, and only the young will enter into a body through the ear and wrap themselves around the cerebral cortex as they grow. This constriction causes compliance and even madness.  So, you see, the two species are entirely different.   The slug likely evolved its toxins as a countermeasure to being eaten. A humanoid species picks them up as a snack, swallow it, then it worms its way to the base of the skull and release a neurotoxin.  The eel uses the brain as a housing for their young. There is no neurotoxin involved, only constriction as it grows within the skull.   They're both considerably different species, and have very different abilities. It's jjust that they both can be used to achieve similar means.

Deleted scenes from the film establish that Nero got the slugs from the Klingons on Rura Penthe, who used them to interrogate prisoners, and include dialogue stating a different mechanism for their effects: they are from a planet bathed in constant sunlight, and when placed into dark spaces, they furiously attempt to burrow their way out.   Ceti Alpha V was most certainly not 'bathed in sunlight.'"

In reality, that 8-hour estimate could be shuffled up a bit.  Outside of that, I would imagine that time-sharing becomes pretty ideal.  If, say, I want to watch a famous basketball game, my pleasure would be enhanced by going with others.  Miles and Bashir/Jadzia and Kira oftentimes hit up the holosuites together, so there might be come ""economics"" in that time-sharing which extend your 8-hour period to something much longer."
DaystromInstitute,3abnxm,KalEl1232,4,Thu Jun 18 20:31:16 2015 UTC,"While this was never seen to be the mode of operation on the Ent-D in the 2360s, holodeck hardware should theoretically be able to accomodate multiple, segregated simulations simultaneously, i.e. true time-sharing. It would be no different than the times we see multiple users in different locations within the same simulation (as in Elementary, Dear Data).   To an objective observer, a holodeck functioning in this mode would look more like the Quantum Leap imaging chamber, with individual perspectives wrapped around different users. The only limiting factor would be computer processing power, but whether this was a constraint on a ship where a holodeck user could casually order the computer to provision resources for the creation of a sentient nemesis for Data is debatable."
DaystromInstitute,3abnxm,absrd,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:26:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the very concept of the holodeck kind of breaks down when you consider how it works with multiple users.

DaystromInstitute,3abnxm,jerslan,15,Thu Jun 18 20:39:56 2015 UTC,"The Enterprise had all sorts of Recreational Facilities on board, so the Holodecks were probably not 100% booked all the time. Additionally, those 1012 people weren't all off duty at the same time. They had shift rotations, though I can't recall if it was 3 shift or 4 shifts.... For the sake of argument lets assume 3 shifts. 1/3 of the crew would be working, while another ~1/3 is off duty and awake, while the remaining ~1/3 is asleep... There were no apparent full days off except in special cases (ie: health issues).  It was probably a sign-up with the computer for an available time-slot on a first-come-first-serve basis. This would also account for apparently impromptu Holodeck visits (ie: when Lwaxana takes Alexander to the Holodeck)."
DaystromInstitute,3abnxm,jerslan,10,Thu Jun 18 21:00:36 2015 UTC,"there are 3 duty shifts on the enterprise, and of course not everyone is off duty at the same time, but at any given hour of the day, a portion of the crew is off duty.

Having different people on different shifts and therefore having their off-duty times spread throughout the day does not increase the availability of the holodecks. As /u/pandashuman calculated, there are only 10,944 hours of holodeck availability per month. That won't increase just because the crew is off duty at different times throughout the day."
DaystromInstitute,3abnxm,ObjectiveAnalysis,-3,Thu Jun 18 21:22:22 2015 UTC,"It decreases demand on those hours.  Since not everyone will be demanding them every hour of every day.  Even when they're off-duty, everyone isn't demanding to spend all their time in the Holodeck either. Some may never use the Holodeck simply because there are other things to do they enjoy more.  It's only a problem if there aren't enough other things to do."
DaystromInstitute,3abnxm,Algernon_Asimov,3,Thu Jun 18 21:38:25 2015 UTC,"Given that, according to pandashuman's calculations, there's only enough holodeck time available to give each person 8 hours per month, it won't take much demand to exceed that limited supply. Even with people working and with other recreational activities, it's still not hard to imagine that 2 hours of holodeck time per week might not be enough."
DaystromInstitute,3abnxm,Anubissama,2,Thu Jun 18 21:50:27 2015 UTC,We often see people using the holodeck together on groups though which would allow everyone in the group more time.
DaystromInstitute,3abnxm,jerslan,1 point,Fri Jun 19 10:30:46 2015 UTC,"Yes.   Again, that doesn't increase the number of hours that the holodecks are available. It merely demonstrates that people pool and share their hours to use those limited hours more efficiently."

So for example a married couple on board of the enterprise has 22h per month if they use them together."
DaystromInstitute,3abnxm,Algernon_Asimov,1 point,Sat Jun 20 11:32:28 2015 UTC,"Lets also remember that a good portion of that 1012 is children... Do we know what the child:adult ratio was on the Enterprise? I would guess there were probably about ~100 kids on board of various age ranges (including several teenagers). We can probably take 90% of the kids out of that equation as they'd be too young to go to the Holodeck without an Adult accompanying them.   As seen on-screen, actual demand on Holodeck time was apparently lower than the supply (as far as the Enterprise-D was concerned), since Barclay and others could go to the Holodeck seemingly on a whim and run programs for several hours (Barclay even fell asleep while running one of his more, uh, fanciful programs)."
DaystromInstitute,3abnxm,jerslan,6,Thu Jun 18 22:13:34 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised if hours were traded or given away as gifts etc. Maybe some people just dont like the holodeck.

I'm pretty sure there would be parental control functions in the holodeck, to allow kids to play in G-rated environments without access to adults-only options. Remember that Wesley and a friend were playing unsupervised on the holodeck in one episode - and I'd be more likely to restrict a teenager's use than a child's use. The teenager is more likely to want to look at adult-oriented programs than a young child, who probably just wants to play with cuddly animals.   In fact, given the way entertainment technology (robot toys, computer games) gets rolled out today, I would bet that holodeck technology was first made available as games and stories for children, before being further developed for adults.

But, the holodecks are Starfleet property, and I imagine that Starfleet has very strict protocols about what can and can not be viewed in those holodecks, and who can and can not view it. However, the Enterprise must also have civilian communications networks and computer networks. Those would probably be firewalled from the Enterprise's main computer and have less strict protocols."

DaystromInstitute,3abnxm,MexicanSpaceProgram,3,Fri Jun 19 18:29:30 2015 UTC,"This is very good.  I'd suggest a couple small changes.  For the adults on the ship, holodeck time probably accrues similar to vacation time at most jobs.  You'd get a certain amount each year, but its not all available at once.  For that case, let's say each adult earns 1 hour a week, but it stops accruing once it reaches a max value of 24 hours.  It becomes a use it or lose it.  Children get the time a little differently, usually based off of the parents time.  It might become a reward, an allowance, school trip, or something to get them out of the quarters for a few hours.  Also, it should be based on age as well.  It makes more sense that a teenager should get more holodeck time than an infant.  Breaking it up like this should prevent a bottleneck of people trying to use them at once, and allows some of them to be designated for official use.  Plus, it makes using them rare enough that they're still a valuable incentive or reward."
DaystromInstitute,3abnxm,topsecreteltee,3,Fri Jun 19 16:09:15 2015 UTC,"How do you suppose Barclay fits into this? If there was a limit of 8 hours per month, a total of about 2 hours per week (generally speaking) how would he have been able to accrue enough time on the Holodeck to form addictive habits?   Perhaps he was 'borrowing' time from other crew members, or perhaps taking unbooked slots of time as they come up and no one had signed up for them.  Perhaps there wasn't a rigid set limit at all so much as there is a mutual understanding of common courtesies. Like, you could book a ton of time on the holodeck but that would be rude."
DaystromInstitute,3abnxm,MageTank,7,Fri Jun 19 09:55:07 2015 UTC,"Right now, I'm leaning away from the whole ""everybody gets so much time per month"" model and thinking a lot more like ""book your time in advance, first come first serve"" style.  Unless there's a line of dialogue somewhere in TNG about only getting to use the holodeck once in a while, I think Barclay is reason enough to assume it's just not as much of a craze as we think it should be.  If standard allotment is referenced in dialogue though, it does make sense that Barclay could be aware of a number of crew members who don't much care to use their time and he asks to use theirs every month, and since they aren't necessarily aware of how many other people he's borrowing from as well, no one would suspect his addiction."
DaystromInstitute,3abnxm,sleep-apnea,6,Fri Jun 19 12:52:20 2015 UTC,"It's probably less personally available holodeck time than you'd think, since presumably they'd use it for a lot of training and other official things that would take precedence, e.g.:   Bridge Officer Testing (TNG Thine Own Self).

DaystromInstitute,3abnxm,williams_482,2,Fri Jun 19 05:56:21 2015 UTC,"I think it would depend on the nature of the training, and how many departments had to go through it.

DaystromInstitute,3aby2y,comport,12,Thu Jun 18 21:21:06 2015 UTC,"Couple issues here.   The El-Aurians were assimilated sometime around 2265. The temporal plot in First Contact was enacted in 2373. Why the delay? If you're assimilating some group of timeline observers to weaponize time travel, why not start right away? And, if they had started right away, they would have found out quite quickly that the temporal vortex could only create useless time loops, where nothing changes, and this tech would be discarded right away. Also, why would you need more than one? The problem appears again: why mass assimilate them? There's also no real proof that Guinan wasn't unique. For all we know, some incident have her the ability to observe timelines - typically supposed to be the Nexus. Maybe no other El-Aurians necessarily have this power. You can't presume that the El-Aurians would produce a 'poor technological return on the investment.' We don't know anything about them. The fact that the only other species we really see swarmed is Species 116, who have a Voth-like technological level and were a highly desirable target."
DaystromInstitute,3aby2y,Darth_Rasputin32898,5,Thu Jun 18 21:47:56 2015 UTC,I think point two can be dismissed as not wanting any other force to have the El-Aurians.
DaystromInstitute,3aby2y,nikchi,3,Fri Jun 19 03:58:40 2015 UTC,"Another view that could tie into point three. It's possible that the trait to see other timelines was rare among the El-Aurians themselves. Maybe incredibly rare, as in only a handful of individuals; perhaps even just a single individual in a generation. And since it's unlikely that such a trait would be immediately superficially obvious, a mass assimilation was required just to find such individuals. It's clear that if the Borg COULD find such a person and were somehow able to understand and acquire it via assimilation, it would be a logical expenditure of resources given the potential power it holds."

Chances are they could, not the best chances but still good. Now think of a 100 Borg cube. Could a planet of El-Auriens beat an armada of 100 Borg Cubes? Maybe, just maybe.

For them it's the Journey that matters. Meeting new people, hearing their stories....   The amount of intel gained alone would be worth it. Since they would have knowledge of cultures way out of the Borg's reach at that point in time. Considering that they often traveled on long voyages, they probably had some pretty decent maintenance and sustenance tech (maybe even helped the Federation develop replicators earlier than they otherwise would have). Given that Guinan was on Earth, alone, around the time of the late-1890s and early 1900s? We can assume there were many that traveled alone. They would have needed considerable auto-repair mechanisms to accomplish such long journeys as solo voyages. Possibly this enhanced the Borg's own auto-repair capabilities."
DaystromInstitute,3acd00,Hellstrike,4,Thu Jun 18 23:21:04 2015 UTC,"I feel that they've already done the Academy / cadets thing with the Trek reboot films (which I hate - seriously, Cadet to Captain in two hours, and Uhura bonking Spock?).  That said, there's a few of the ideas I'm not terribly big on.  Seven as Captain?  I guess it could work, but for the fact that Seven has already stated she had no interest in joining Starfleet (VOY Imperfection), and VOY showed enough of her personality to choke a donkey (wear catsuit, say things are irrelevant, call people drones).  Anything to do with T'Pol?  I'm not particularly interested in seeing more of T'Pol.  Her character as it was just a pseudo-Spock with tits, and a really annoying personality (especially at the start of the series when she's crapping on about how wonderful Vulcans are and how messed up humans are).  War involving the Romulans and Vulcans was done to death in Enterprise in my opinion - they had that whole thing with the Romulan drone ship, and the Vulcan / Andorian conflict.  Can't really see what else they'd add to that given continuity in TOS, and the fact that Spock ends up working towards Unification anyway.  ENT-era Borg was just a really awkward tie-in with First Contact (ENT Regeneration).  Personally, I think it was a mistake - as was adding the Ferengi to Enterprise.  Not so much in terms of continuity, just we've seen enough Borg and Ferengi in the other series for a lifetime - find something new.  Things I wouldn't mind seeing / having a new series based on:   Chakotay et al and Ro in the heyday of the Maquis, operating on a shoestring on the frontier, and being hunted by the Cardassians and Starfleet (which would be interesting to see a series where the Federation are portrayed as antagonists).  It could start with everyone happy on their colonies, then some people cede their planet to someone else and tell them to bugger off, and go downhill from there. Something like DS9 but based in the TOS Era (e.g. Deep Space K7). Series based some time directly after the Khitomer Accords (STVI), e.g. rebuilding the Klingon Empire after Praxis, renegotiating the Neutral Zone, though it's an uneasy peace and no side trusts the other, and the Romulans try to capitalise on the instability."
DaystromInstitute,3acd00,MexicanSpaceProgram,2,Fri Jun 19 11:50:06 2015 UTC,"How much did we see of the Academy in the reboots besides Kirk boning girls and eating an apple?  Also you fail to take character development into account. Yes, both Seven and T'Pol are just eyecandy early on but develop far beyond walking boobs during their series. Seven starts to care about others (and she thought she would die in imperfection so we might not see her true motivations there either) and T'Pol becomes humanity's advocate at the Vulcan high command (metaphorically speaking) because she sees that mankind is not at all what Vulcans think of it."
DaystromInstitute,3acd00,MexicanSpaceProgram,2,Fri Jun 19 12:14:09 2015 UTC,"The academy?  A reasonable amount (Kobayashi Maru etc.), plus the whole backstory of Kirk's family and why he got into Starfleet, ditto for Spock.  I just don't see what else there is to see about Seven or T'Pol.  Half of Voyager's later seasons where Seven episodes, and we get the backstory of her parents and her relationship with the Borg Queen and attempting to atone for assimilation, I just don't think there's that much left to look at.  T'Pol I just didn't like from the get go - but they dealt with all of her backstory anyway between her ancestors on Earth, her time in the Vulcan Security Service, the background of the Vulcan High Command, all that stuff.  She was second-lead actor in a series that went on for four seasons - what else is there really left to do with the character?  I'd much rather see:   Something new, or at least something starring a minor cast member (e.g. like they did with O'Brien going from TNG to DS9). Some part of history / the federation we haven't seen before (e.g. my suggestion for a series based on the Maquis, with the Federation as a well-meaning antagonist). Something at a politically interesting time (e.g. directly after the Khitomer Accords)."
DaystromInstitute,3acd00,MexicanSpaceProgram,2,Fri Jun 19 12:22:35 2015 UTC,"The foundation of the Federation was certainly an interesting time about which we don't know much besides what a Holodeck simulation of it looks like.

DaystromInstitute,3acd00,Kamala_Metamorph,2,Fri Jun 19 13:39:13 2015 UTC,"The founding of the Federation-era gave us Enterprise - let's not repeat the mistake.  As for T'Pol and Seven - they were major characters over four seasons with a range of entire episodes dedicated to them - I really don't think there's much their left to explore (at least not enough to warrant a standalone series with them as the lead).  O'Brien worked well as a transplant from TNG on DS9, because it gave you a familiar with character that you didn't really know all that much about, in a completely new role and environment.  Ditto with Worf, since there's so much to work with given what's established with his history and the Klingons in TNG."

I can't agree with this, though:   This suggest that in terms of overall power levels there is nothing in the Milky Way Galaxy that even poses a remote threat to the Borg.   The Federation has routinely encountered civilizations far more powerful than themselves.  Off the top of my head (in addition to the ones you've already mentioned):   The Caretaker The Traveler Wormhole aliens Apollo V'Ger Nagilum Beings from the TOS episode ""Charlie X"" Being that killed Tasha Yar on TNG (Armus, I believe) Excalbians   That's only a fraction of the ones we know of, which are undoubtedly a fraction of similarly-powered civilizations in the galaxy."

In fact, the act that most demonstrates interest in the Federation/Romulans occurred prior to the J25 encounter: the Neutral Zone attacks and the secret assimilation of the USS Tombaugh in 2362. The only conceivable purpose to start a war between to powers you could ostensibly steamroll - at the same time - is to prompt them to devoid usable defensive technologies late to be turned to their advantage. The mere fact of the Borg having been beaten so many times shows that, while they do not lack for powerful vessels or resources, they do not possess creative innovation.  (Also it's arguable that the Dominion could pose a serious threat to the Borg - you should include that example.)"

I honestly don't think they could. The dominion are at best a match Alpha Quadrant Powers only because of their numbers and relatively similar technological levels. The only reason they can match off against the Klingons and Federation in open warfare is in large part due to their ability to bring soldiers to the battle, but even their high numbers still pale in comparison to the Borg's general operations. We know that they summoned up a force of over 2,000 Ships waiting at the Wormhole to pass in a 6 month time span, of which a great many consisted of less powerful attack craft and frigates.   I honestly don't believe that the Dominion has that sort of firepower. Also I would submit that the USS Tombaugh was simply a bit like the borg Sampling a Dish. They found a Federation Long Range Research vessel and assimilated it to get an idea bout the species, (along with the Hansons who kept poking around in their ship), and not a distinct intrest, just having a ship in the area bump into the locals"
DaystromInstitute,3aaif1,Darth_Rasputin32898,5,Thu Jun 18 15:42:07 2015 UTC,"The problem with those criticisms of the Dominion is that we still don't know, concretely, how many ships/systems they control vs the Borg and how fast they can degenerate them, along with issues as to whether the Borg can assimilate Founders.

DaystromInstitute,3aaif1,Zhe_Ennui,6,Thu Jun 18 16:15:37 2015 UTC,I'm actually going to say that we don't understand the Borg's Transwarp Network /however/ we do know they have Exit points that take them across quadrants and have exit points in at least 2 of the known Quadrants   I guess what I'm trying to say is that mining a Wormhole really wouldn't have been an issue for the borg. They very fact that they have the infrastructure to not require a Womrhole to move their fleet across quadrants I believe stands as proof enough that technologically they were far ahead of the Dominion. It's /possible/ that the Dominion are secretly hiding the infrastructure to create a Transwarp network... but their situation with the Bajoran Wormhole strongly suggest they don't have the technology in any way shape or form.

Why?  The Dominion can be quite secretive. Their vassal states, Vorta administrators, and Jem'Hadar soldiers all comment that the Founders stay out of sight. I think it's completely plausible that they chose to use the wormhole as just a convenient excuse to be able to attack the UFP.  In any case, like I say in the comment I linked, any advantage one side has can be upset by just assuming the other has more ships."
DaystromInstitute,3aaif1,DisforDoga,6,Thu Jun 18 16:31:24 2015 UTC,"As secretive as they can be, I don't think they would willingly lose an entire fleet, and ultimately the war, to preserve this one technological edge.   As soon as the wormhole ceased to be a viable path into the Alpha quadrant, Dominion forces would have started pouring in if they had other means to do so."
DaystromInstitute,3aaif1,hummingbirdz,-2,Thu Jun 18 18:11:17 2015 UTC,"Willingly lose the whole war? Not what I meant.  What I meant was that they might have wanted to expand into the Alpha Quadrant prior to the wormhole's opening, but didn't consider themselves ready to expand their (hypothetical) transwarp network to those places. It's conceivable that they sent their fleet through the wormhole without transwarp conduit generating equipment or Vorta aware of its existence because they preferred to expand on that advantage in the Gamma Quadrant, rather than give it away and risk higher demands from their Cardassian and Breen allies."
DaystromInstitute,3aaif1,hummingbirdz,5,Thu Jun 18 18:24:23 2015 UTC,They only needed those allies to begin with because they didn't have enough tonnage to do the work themselves.

DaystromInstitute,3aaif1,hummingbirdz,3,Thu Jun 18 22:17:42 2015 UTC,"I like this theory a lot. I am very much a proponent (maybe this comes from TOS I'm thinking of the Metrons from Arena and the catpeople from TAS), that the Federation is pretty low on the totem pole. It is a quadrant level power, but there are many powers who operate on galactic, intergalactic, interdimensional, or existential scopes.  The borg are probably dealing all the time with power struggles on these levels.  Although I don't think it has to be the Q that they are interested in from this perspective. I think they poke the federation like we poke an ant colony. Maybe they do so with a purpose like farming even, but its a very low priority and thats why we see the sort of limited attacks."

DaystromInstitute,3aaif1,yankeebayonet,3,Thu Jun 18 22:54:01 2015 UTC,"Perhaps the Borg don't try to assimilate these species? Maybe they want to protect the collective against them in other ways: killing them or whatever other things you do to defend against them. Perhaps you study them to try to understand how they got to be so advanced and try to allow the collective or some part of it to go through a similar process.   Maybe there is a Borg queen somewhere attempting to ascend to higher planes. The queen is necessary here because such a process could be risky for the entire collective, or prevent it from assimilating things on our plane which seems to be its central purpose in life. So an individual imbued with the collective is required to test the waters.   It probably depends a lot on the level of power of the species. I mean Q, you probably just want to learn what makes it tick and how to best avoid it. Metrons though are not necessarily energy beings, I think they are just supposed to be crazy advanced. So maybe you figure out how their technology works and how to assimilate them.   It seems likely that the Borg would want to find a way to assimilate beings rather than just humanoids. Maybe they already have, but they don't or can't use that on humanoids? Maybe their is a general balance of power between the Borg and other species with more advanced powers than humans/Federation."

DaystromInstitute,3aaif1,metakepone,4,Fri Jun 19 03:02:51 2015 UTC,"I've been skeptical about these posts because we never see the Federation engage the Borg with real force. There were around 40 ships at Wolf 359, but a strapped operation during the Dominion War had over 400. Of course the Federation wouldn't survive an all-out assault, but there must be a reason the Borg never sent one.   Logistics. We don't know what supplies the Borg might need, but they do need them. If they didn't, Borg space wouldn't be expanding the way it is. Sure they have the transwarp conduits, but that seems to only allow force projection in a limited way since they are still comparatively compact. Also, we see an average assimilation party in Voyager consist of several ships, not just one cube.   I think it's far more likely that the Borg are more limited than they appear. Maybe one cube is all they can send against the Federation and they see it as a worthwhile attempt to disrupt a power that will one day rival and pose a danger to themselves."
DaystromInstitute,3aaif1,Darth_Rasputin32898,2,Thu Jun 18 18:23:51 2015 UTC,What do you think the Borg would do with a Q?  Could the Q not simply eradicate the Borg from the timeline on a whim? Could they not 'see' the signals which keep the collective synchronised and know exactly what they were thinking and what they planned? I don't know what interested the Borg would have in a species that's essentially omnipotent.
DaystromInstitute,3aaif1,Darth_Rasputin32898,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:26:34 2015 UTC,"Hmm, after just watching Deja Q, maybe the Continuum is enacting a moratorium on the Q's interfering and ""provoking"" (or even eradicating) species, which explains why Q was kicked out. After that point, if I'm not mistaken, at least in TNG, Q is no longer just messing with the TNG crew, but instead trying to teach them lessons about who they are and the consequences of their actions. This is even seen in ""Q Who?"", where Q's goal isn't to haze the Enterprise crew as much as it is to show them a taste of whats out there in the galaxy."
DaystromInstitute,3aaif1,jimthewanderer,2,Fri Jun 19 23:34:27 2015 UTC,"True but at that point they could have simply been digging around for Iconia, as the Iconian Thread Suggest that Federation and Romulan colonies were caught in the cross fire was only a side effect.   Also the Q had most definitely appeared to the Federation Several times /before/ the incidents in the neutral zone. The Episode Encounter at Farpoint would also suggest that the Farpoint outpost (and thus the location of the first Q encounter) wasn't all too far from the Neutral Zone.   To expand upon that more, we know in an alternate timeline that while Captain Picard Creates, Q is ultimately responsible for the effect of the incident was at the heart of the Neutral Zone. Is it possible the Borg have the ability to peak in on Alternate timelines and perhaps were interested why there was so much Q activity in or around the Neutral Zone?"
DaystromInstitute,3aaif1,Darth_Rasputin32898,3,Thu Jun 18 15:18:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, I suppose that level of 'supernatural vibe' is conceivable, but there still seem to be a lot of Borg activity around more ordinary species, like the Brunali. If the Borg were only attacking then for raw material they'd have gone through all of them at once.  I guess you've really got to add this one to the list of possible Borg motives:   Longer term benefits from the innovation of 'less advanced' cultures (farming). Rapid growth (potshot; see the 'alternatives to farming' thread). Access to higher dimensional powerful life forms and the 'incredible ancients' of Star Trek' (you/drafterman).   I feel like all of these are true, though, to some extent. Like I speculated to the user who came up with #2 (name escapes me), the Borg were probably exploiting his tactic in the late 22nd century and the 23rd century, resulting in their major population growth which persists to the 24th century. Now, their massive size forces them to devote ships to patrol duty to prevent new hive minds and drones from reverting to pre-assimilation activities. This situation forces their attempts at growth to angle towards technological rewards rather the raw materials. To this end, they seek out the more powerful life forms and species where evidence of their activity is, with the double effect of frightening other interstellar states into developing technologies which may also late benefit the Borg, who (mostly) cannot think or invent.  What do you think? ^"
DaystromInstitute,3aaif1,warcrown,3,Thu Jun 18 15:22:43 2015 UTC,"And the motives aren't inherently mutually exclusive either, It's possible that the Borg's motives are three folds or even more then that. Being single minded or having a single purpose doesn't really fit their character. Also the Brunali also still seem quite capable of doing incredible damage to them even in a severely weakened state (having the biological knowledge to cripple a cube using a single individual and their genetic knowledge).   The Federation was toying with this idea but deemed it unethical, but it does bring up a curious question of if the Federation was capable fo such a thing."

Thus ruling out the fact that you'd need infinite energy to accelerate to c, and the time would stop for you while your mass would be infinite as well even though your size would be infinitely small.  So if the special theory of relativity doesn't apply here, would Lorentz transformation do? I don't think it would, though I'm not a physicist, so don't take my word for 100% true.

Between warp 1 and 10 however we haven't observed anything strange happen. Maybe it's similar to special relativity where you start really noticing the effects only at relativistic speeds, even though those effects happen at slow speeds too though they are so miniscule you can't measure them easily. Since in the warp scale, especially when you reach the 9.9 area, every single decimal difference makes huge difference in speed (warp 9.975 vs 9.985, the latter being faster at least by 1000c), the difference could get visible at something like warp 9.9999999 and so on and also be very easy to spot at warp 10 obviously."

Evidence for this is that the warp scale was changed between TOS and TNG.  After the change, the scale is v=cw1/3 geometrically up to warp 9, and exponentially up to v=infinity at warp 10.  (Before the change it was v=cw3).  This is generally what we see on screen.  It is reasonable to assume that ships travelling at warp do not experience relativistic effects, so two ships moving at warp 6 (392.5c) would detect each other closing at 785c, which would correspond to warp 7.4, using the above scale. (((c610/3)2)/c)3/10=7.4  A general formula for adding warp speeds W and X would be (W10/3+X10/3)3/10, but again, this is just a consequence of the chosen scale, not a consequence of relativity.  http://en.memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Warp_factor http://www.calormen.com/star_trek/warpcalc/"

DaystromInstitute,3abzkc,uptotwentycharacters,3,Fri Jun 19 03:37:02 2015 UTC,"Thats what the writers say in regards to the function for the warp scale, however, ignoring the functions given at the two links in my post, here is a function that meets the criteria of warp 0 goes to 0c, warp 1 = 1c, warp 10 goes to infinity, and some other warp values extrapolated from on screen are close:  v/c=(w2.06)*9/(10-w)1/w   Using this, doubling warp 6 gives you warp 7.9  Warp factors aside, I thought about it and there really isn't evidence either way to say if ships travelling at warp experience any relativistic effects or not.  For example, if they state that they are going somewhere and it will take 4 days, maybe they experience 4 days during the travel, or maybe they know that it will be 4 days later at the destination when they arrive but they will experience less time during the travel.  I can't think of an instance where they state how long it will take to get somewhere and then state a different amount of time they have to do something on the ship before they get there.  If you want to take not just time dilation but some sort of space contraction into account, as you said at warp 10 the ship is supposed to occupy all points in the universe simultaneously, which implies that at warp 10 it is infinitely large.  Perhaps ships travelling at warp become slightly longer in the direction of travel, or the space around them becomes slightly shorter, and this effect is similar to relativistic lorentz contraction.  As a side note, I did some reading and apparently the integer warp factors are supposed to be thresholds where it takes a marked increase in power to go faster, but after that point the power requirements are less, so my comment about them just being an arbitrary speed definition was incorrect."

DaystromInstitute,3abkey,LordEnigma,10,Thu Jun 18 19:41:23 2015 UTC,"Biological evolution in the Trek universe is linear and deterministic, with organisms moving from 'less' to 'more' evolved in a predetermined pattern, beginning with bacteria and ending with Q, in lockstep with with technological development and moral enlightenment.  Species that deviate from the prescribed evolutionary path, or that do not advance their biology, technology, and morality in equal proportions may become ""stuck"" and find themselves unable to progress along their evolutionary path.  This seems to be what has happened to both the Borg and the Dominion, as their technological and physical prowess approach the physical limits of the universe, but find themselves unable to depart by transforming into energy beings.  Solving this riddle is what motivates the Borg obsession with assimilating perfection and what drove the Founders to scatter their young through the universe.

And then Janeway's like ""Okay show me what a more highly evolved Hadrosaur would look like"" and it shows them something that sort of looks like the Voth.  First time I saw that episode, I was really hoping it would show Janeway a chicken or something.  Anyways, it's really clear (from ""Threshold,"" ""Genesis,"" ""Distant Origin,"" and other episodes) that Brannon Braga has no clue what evolution is, how it functions, what DNA is or how it works, etc. I'm willing to forgive a lot of nonsense in Star Trek (making up new particles and having them do all kinds of crazy stuff, for instance) but the just horrible biology is kind of galling. Like shit didn't they have science advisers on the show? Couldn't they have run some of that by a biologist?  I guess it goes all the way back to TOS's ""Hodgkin's Law of Parallel Development"" thing, but at least that was motivated by cost concerns. I'm willing to put all that aside in light of that. Same goes for having most aliens look like people with some funny makeup on -- I know it's because it would be prohibitive to have most aliens be big spiders or something (though TOS was able to get some mileage out of having aliens be clouds of gas, so there's that). I never really needed an in-universe explanation for that (and really ""The Chase"" is an episode I mostly loathe)."

This was the one glaring flaw in what turned out to be a really good episode, and it drove the 10 year old dinosaur expert in me nuts.   Janeway asks the computer for the ""most evolved"" dinosaur, and is given a holographic Parasaurolophus which the computer refers to as a ""hadrosaur,"" a technically correct but curiously vague classification, as there were a wide variety of Hadrosaurs (such as Edmontosaurus, Corythosaurus, and the Reddit admin favorite Lambeosaurus). From what we know of them, hadrosaurs were grazers that lived in huge herds and were probably not noticeably smarter than cattle, antelope, or other similar mammals today. Although perhaps they would qualify as ""most evolved"" (whatever that actually means), hadrosaurs are almost certainly not the most likely group to eventually evolve into sentient beings.   A more sensible choice from a scientific standpoint would have been a small Theropod such as Troodon, often considered one of the smartest dinosaurs because it's brain was much larger in relation to it's body than most of it's contemporaries. When people with some knowledge of paleontology are screwing around with theories about dinosaurs eventually evolving into sentient beings, Troodon is generally the one that gets brought up as the most likely ancestor.   Of course, it's possible that the writers decided they wanted a herbivorous dinosaur with a beak and funny head crests instead of something more fierce then I guess I can't fault them for that.

There's that Enterprise episode ""Dear Doctor"" where the whole plot hinges on a whole host of dumbness concerning evolution, for instance (amazingly, Braga didn't write that one. He did say it was an episode that he ""really loved"" though).  As for the general shape of the Voth and their supposed ancestry -- yeah it would have made a lot more sense for the Voth to have been descendents of any of a number of more suitable dinosaurs.

DaystromInstitute,3aay01,contrasupra,10,Thu Jun 18 16:59:10 2015 UTC,"I think any explanation for this is going to be pretty far-fetched, but here goes.  (1) It could be that, yes, the universal translator is somehow able to translate alien time increments into human time increments.  (2) It's possible that ""year"" is another time increment that is based on some phenomenon (the decay of a specific radioactive isotope, say) that has somehow become standard throughout the galaxy, even beyond the Federation. Maybe an ancient galaxy-spanning civilization used it and introduced it many hundreds of thousands of years ago, and resultant civilizations adopted it, too.  (3) By pure coincidence, nearly every civilization we've seen on Star Trek has adopted a time period called ""year"" that roughly corresponds with an Earth year. That's not necessarily a measurement of the time it takes for their planet to complete an orbit around its star, but for whatever reason they correspond.  (4) The Ancient Humanoids from ""The Chase"" did it. They only started life on planets (or moons, I guess) that have the same ""year"" as Earth. It was just something that they did."
DaystromInstitute,3aay01,zuludown888,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:14:13 2015 UTC,"I'd go with 2). It makes sense that the Federation would have standardised measurements, although I don't really think there's any canon evidence either way for it."
DaystromInstitute,3aay01,obsidianordeal,12,Thu Jun 25 03:09:35 2015 UTC,"I think the ""years"" of different species might be a bit closer than you'd think.  Pretty much every species encountered in Trek comes from a Class M planet. Class M planets are Earth-like planets, planets that exist in the Goldilocks zone that allow them the proper circumstances to have liquid water, a breathable atmosphere, proper temperatures, etc. Other planets can have life, but Class M planets are much, much more likely to produce advanced life.  So, most of the species on Trek would therefore have originated on a planet that orbits their respective sun at a relatively similar distance. As far as I'm aware, any planet that lies in that sweet spot that can develop life would naturally orbit their sun at a relatively similar speed. (Planets always orbit faster the closer they are to the sun.)  So, I'd say everybody's own measurement for a year (the time it takes for their planet to orbit the sun) is actually pretty similar, give or take a few Earth years. Probably close enough that the universal translator doesn't feel the need to make any changes."
DaystromInstitute,3aay01,StatlerPat,21,Thu Jun 18 18:43:41 2015 UTC,"The thing is, the habitable zone of a star would vary depending on its size and brightness. The sun is a very typical star, but other, much larger or brighter stars could also have planets that bear life, if they are far enough away. Conversely, smaller or dimmer stars could have habitable planets, only somewhat closer to them. The ""year"" for a planet around the former would be much longer than ours, while the year of a planet around the latter would be shorter.  For instance, the habitable zone of 40 Eridani (the star that's usually proposed as Vulcan's location) is considerably closer to its star than our sun's is. That's because 40 Eridani A is a K1-type dwarf star and is significantly smaller than our sun."
DaystromInstitute,3aay01,zuludown888,4,Thu Jun 18 18:57:00 2015 UTC,"This is very true, I totally forgot about size and brightness.

Ours is 364 days but as someone else pointed out a Vulcan year is probably closer to 230 days.  (Memory Alpha gives Vulcan as having a year 456 earth days long, however.)  I have no idea what an Andorian year or a Tellar year would be.  Supposing the theory is correct about a year being similar for all planets with advanced life inhabiting the ""Goldilocks"" zone is correct, then we assume Andorians and Tellarites had a year that spanned 200 to 400 days.  So, just like they created a new method of datekeeping with Stardates it's entirely possible they created an entirely new calendar that somehow averaged the year of all four founding worlds of the Federation to create a new ""star-year.""

They seem a LOT more relaxed about certain things....  Lt Paris was involved in a major accident that lead to 2 deaths and kicked out. He then joined the Maquis and was caught soon after... Basically, he committed treason, and they put him in a relatively low security penal colony in New Zealand. Later, he's temporarily reinstated to full rank simply because he might be useful to Voyagers original mission (after which he would have been given a full pardon and sent on his merry way). When Voyager is lost in the Delta Quadrant, temporary reinstatement becomes more permanent....  Eddington is a somewhat different case... He flat out poisoned several Cardassian colonies in the DMZ to force them to leave so the Maquis could take them over. He also stole technology that was vital to peace with the Cardassians.

DaystromInstitute,3ablwc,disposable_pants,3,Fri Jun 19 23:01:40 2015 UTC,"All we know is:   She disobeyed direct orders; Eight members of her away team (that she was leading) died; She did not speak to her defense;   The court-martial then concluded that her disobedience to those orders caused those deaths and she was sentenced to Jaros II for an unspecified amount of time (dialogue suggests she was at least a lieutenant at the time, probably making it 3-5 years she was on Jaros by the time of Ensign Ro).  Beyond this is speculation. If we assume the court-martial process is anything like 21st Century America, the severity of the events she was subject to a general court martial, the highest level of court martial (the others being summary, which does not apply to officers, and special which are for less severe cases). Given her lack of defense, Ro probably did not challenge or suggest any alterations from standard procedure meaning:   She was detained until trial; A panel of officers was selected to see the trial; She was tried in a court, with prosecution attempting to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt; Despite her lack of defense, she was probably appointed counsel regardless; The panel found her guilty with at least 2/3 vote, and subsequently decided upon her sentence; She did not avail herself of appeals;   As to whether or not she could be imprisoned while retaining her rank? Yes. This can happen. Here is an example of an Army Captain (equivalent of Navy Lieutenant) who was sentenced to 45 days in prison with a substantial fine, while retaining his rank in the military.  Reduction in rank is also a possible outcome, to varying degree. The examples I see seem to be related to higher ranking officers, but that could simply be because only such cases are considered ""notable."" Most striking is the reduction in rank of Michael Murphy who was effectively demoted from Colonel to 1st Lieutenant, the same as demoting a Navy Captain to Lieutenant, junior grade! I guess he took Q up on his offer to change his past!  At the moment I can't find the precise combination (imprisonment + reduction in rank) but both seem to be within the tool box of military jurisprudence with respect to Court Martial. It would depend on the specific nature of the offense on Garon II, the defense mounted by her appointed counsel, the case presented by the prosecution, and the disposition of the judges on the panel.  Given that they didn't completely drum her out suggests a lot of things. It suggests that it wasn't a act of malice or gross incompetence. If I had to speculate, I say that they were in a situation that Ro thought was life or death (or equally severe), and had a choice between two courses of action. She was given orders to do one over the other, but those orders came from above, from some commander on a ship miles above her without the benefit of her perspective on the ground. As leader of the away team, she made a snap judgement call to save lives...  ...and failed. For whatever reason - lack of all the information, lack of experience, happenstance - it was the wrong call. She had the right intentions, she was trying to save lives/prevent death and took the course of action she thought was necessary to achieve that end. If no one died, she probably would have only gotten a stern talking to or, perhaps even commended for ""officer"" thinking in the heat of the moment.  The panel probably recognized this, while also seeing the potential in her. She probably would have gotten by with only minor reduction in rank had she spoken in her defense. But guilt and stubbornness prevented her from doing so. If they couldn't see why she did what she did, whining about it wouldn't help. She took her licks and did her time."

Why the need for the intermediaries of AI routines? Along the same line, why does the Queen need to be an AI?

As for the Queen being an AI of some sort, it just feels correct to me. We've seen what appear to be multiple Queens and one of those depictions indicated that the Queen's body was more like a shell, assembled and occupied.

Placing AI into the role of internal opposition helps us to avoid rubbing up against prior canon.

DaystromInstitute,3abkfj,Berggeist,3,Fri Jun 19 17:53:44 2015 UTC,"Definitely an interesting idea, but I have some tweaks that I think may improve it.  It kind of starts with my own thinking on the Borg Queen/Locutus. In recent discussions, I've advanced the idea that the fundamental problem that the Borg are dealing with is that they need to assimilate other species to grow, but assimilating other species as drones comes with the chance of their individuality and minds causing a split from the whole, as happened to Hugh, or the Borg in Unity.  Now, as the population of the Borg massively increased (beginning in the 22nd century but mostly in the 23rd) the Borg began to encounter the problem of rogue Borg more and more often. It's pretty much to be expected when your whole army is conscripted. And so, the monitoring processes you talk about begin to take more and more priority in the decision making process. Highly telepathic and heavily indoctrinated drones are used to personify the monitors, and they take over crackdowns on rogue Borg. (This is why the Queen was investigating the Unimatrix Zero rebellion.)  However, I don't agree that the ideal of 'perfection' is a 'fantasy.' It's taken a while, but I feel I've found the definition the Borg seem to be using.   SEVEN: Particle zero one zero. The Borg designation for what you call Omega. Every Drone is aware of its existence. We were instructed to assimilate it at all costs. It is perfection. The molecules exist in a flawless state. Infinite parts functioning as one. CHAKOTAY: Like the Borg.   I believe Chakotay is wrong here, the Borg wish. Apart from growing stronger or acquiring better technology from others, they also need to hone their internal mechanisms to remove inefficiencies and friction. Their very size is an obstacle to their goals."
DaystromInstitute,3aajsc,Darth_Rasputin32898,13,Thu Jun 18 15:13:16 2015 UTC,"They're probably from the Neutral Zone outposts. Also, remember that the Borg have been nibbling around the edges of the Alpha Quadrant since at least 2293 (the year that the Enterprise-B is launched), since that's when the E-B picks up the El-Aurian refugee ship, although they may have been in space longer than that; the location of the El-Aurian system has never been specified, but it's assumed to be somewhere in or near the Alpha Quadrant. There was enough evidence concerning the Borg for the Hansens, Seven of Nine's parents, to get a ship from Starfleet for the purpose of investigating their existence. Since we know that individuals and small groups have occasionally struck out beyond the borders of their interstellar ""nations"", to explore or simply get away, and in some cases have travelled quite a ways (such as the Klingon schismatics of VOY's ""Prophecy"", who left the Empire before the Khitomer Accords were signed), and since those travelers would be pretty vulnerable to attack and assimilation (such as the Hansens were), it's not at all improbable that the Borg could have gotten them in that way."

DaystromInstitute,3aajsc,adamkotsko,8,Thu Jun 18 16:14:09 2015 UTC,"Ooh! I actually just had an idea on that!  I was just saying elsewhere that it seems like the Borg cube encountered by the Hansens, which had a massively atypical number of drones (129,000) was taking back a number of drones newly assimilated from the Alpha/Beta Quadrant back to the Delta Quadrant for safe integration, much like the cube from VOY: Unity. What occurred to me is that the discovery of that cube by the Hansens coincides with the Federation-Cardassian War.  The consensus here is that the Unity cube was the one that was targeting Federation/Romulans outposts in coordination with the Wolf 359 cube. So it seems to me that the situation of that cube the Hansens discovered may mirror the Unity cube's: attempting to spark war between other powers and then returning with drones collected in the process. Though this idea could stand some more fleshing out than I can give on mobile, it seems that the Borg may have had some hand in promoting the Cardassian War and that the Unity cube helped out!"
DaystromInstitute,3aajsc,disposable_pants,5,Thu Jun 18 16:44:52 2015 UTC,I can think of at least three places:   The Borg harassed the outskirts of the Cardassian Empire much in the same way they nibbled around the edges of other Alpha Quadrant powers Some colonist/expedition/trader either intentionally ventured far afield or was flung (Voyager-esque) out of the AQ Cardassians traveled into the Gamma Quadrant via the wormhole and encountered the Borg there   None of these would be too difficult to imagine.

DaystromInstitute,3aajsc,BigTaker,4,Thu Jun 18 15:54:08 2015 UTC,"Well, an interesting idea would be that the Romulans became aware of the Borg cube being active in Federation space and sent a cloaked Romuan Warbird to intercept it (I imagine the Romulans have several cloaked vessels active in Federation territory) in order to scan/assess its capabilities.   Then the Battle of Wolf 359 occurred and the Warbird was drawn into the conflict: a stray phaser or torpedo disrupting the cloak or whatnot."

But if they truly were fighting the Borg and had the means to defeat them, they would have been unforgiving to any Federation ships they encountered (imagine how arrogant the Romulans would have been with the Defiant?). I've been looking over maps of the Star Trek milkyway and I see that the Romulan Empire is the closest to Borg space, so the scooping of outposts could have also started on the edge of Romulan space at around the same time that El-Auria was taken by the Borg. Not trying to say I'm right, but I'm just saying it could be possible."
DaystromInstitute,3aajsc,RandyFMcDonald,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:06:34 2015 UTC,"Sure. There are any number of possibilities here.  I would note that in the Beta canon, there are no depictions of such a widespread and long-lasting Romulan war with the Borg. There is a short story suggesting one reason Alidar Jarok defected is that he thought the rivalry with the Federation made no sense given the encroaching Borg threat.  http://memory-beta.wikia.com/wiki/Suicide_Note  The Reeves-Stevens' Federation also includes a claim of a Romulan battle with an encroaching Borg cube. While the battle itself never happened, the Enterprise-D crew did think it a plausible story. (That novel doesn't fit into the current Beta canon, but maybe it does under the broader strokes theory?)  I don't think it unlikely that the Romulans knew of the Borg and were concerned by them, perhaps even before the Neutral Zone attacks. Beyond that ..."
DaystromInstitute,3aajsc,DMPunk,1 point,Sat Jun 20 19:21:19 2015 UTC,"The Star Empire is indeed much closer to the Delta quadrant, but it's still far from Borg space"
DaystromInstitute,3abddu,domodojomojo,4,Thu Jun 18 18:50:20 2015 UTC,"Having not read the novels, I'm guessing the Borg aren't aware of their origin being connected to Earth/humanity."
DaystromInstitute,3abddu,BigTaker,3,Thu Jun 18 19:57:43 2015 UTC,"Correction, they're called the Caeliar, the Gestalt is the governing body (in so much that it could be called a government when you exist as a cloud of mimetic matter).  I absolutely love Destiny but the problem you raise is one I haven't been able to resolve myself. Since the hyper-evolved Caeliar go to great lengths to ensure the integrity of the causality loop, you'd assume the Borg had this knowledge and drive too.   Perhaps the extragalactic energy beam that destroyed their civilization would have been fired when they completed their great work, regardless of whether or not the NX-02 was present. Although ex-Columbia crew members make up the first Borg drones so this still presents a problem."
DaystromInstitute,3abddu,brokenlogic18,3,Thu Jun 18 20:27:43 2015 UTC,"The Borg - attempting to assimilate Earth in 2063 - would not have been yet aware of the Columbia's essential role in their formation. My guess is that after thousands of years, the original human drones were either killed or their memory faded. After all, humans were Species 5618, not 001. It seems many essential things about the Borg happened after the events on Arehaz."
DaystromInstitute,3abddu,Darth_Rasputin32898,2,Thu Jun 18 20:36:46 2015 UTC,"Oh no doubt about that. But the Borg have had a somewhat obsessive fascination with humans. Assimilating a counterpart, the queen accompanying both assaults on Earth and taking a specific interest in Seven, etc. Seems like a lot of attention for what is probably not that unique of a species. Also they don't attempt to deliberately assimilate any other Federation species or the Romulans and Klingons for that matter. There are a few drones that we've seen from those but you never hear about an all out attack like the ones on Earth until Destiny. Could this be born of a remnant of that origin?"
DaystromInstitute,3abddu,Mjolnir2000,2,Thu Jun 18 20:48:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe the Phoenix wouldn't have flown without 24th century engineering knowledge. The Borg knew this, and devised a plan to trick the crew of the Enterprise into interfering.  Alternatively, maybe changes to the timeline only propagate forward - because the origin of the Borg's was in the past relative to First Contact, it didn't matter if that future was erased. It's like how alt-Tasha still existed after the Enterprise C went back even though her timeline was erased."
DaystromInstitute,3abddu,DMPunk,2,Fri Jun 19 05:51:59 2015 UTC,"My only theory is that the Borg judged it worth their time to assimilate Earth in 2063 because one of three things would occur: they would fail and it was irrelevant because they knew the original timeline guaranteed their ascent at least as far as the 24th century, they would succeed and the causality loop would reverse that success and they would still be in the exact same position as they were had they failed. OR they succeed, the causality loop negates their specific future, but creates a new future where the Borg rule the galaxy anyway because it creates an entirely new chain of events that would remove their original origin from happening but create a new one where their time-displaced drones in 2063 become the new genesis of the Borg as a species."
DaystromInstitute,3a9u7b,ILikeDickButt,14,Thu Jun 18 11:05:50 2015 UTC,"The Enterprise was outgunned because... well, it was outgunned. The Enterprise had 10 torpedo tubes/launchers and 16 phaser arrays compared to the Scimitar's 27 photon torpedo launchers and 52 pulse disruptor cannons."
DaystromInstitute,3a9u7b,BigTaker,15,Thu Jun 18 12:44:26 2015 UTC,"To further the answer, the Enterprise may have been advanced, but the design focus was certainly not on firepower. More of an all-purpose vessel. Strong, but not specialized for one function like the Scimitar."

DaystromInstitute,3a9u7b,Grubnar,23,Thu Jun 18 13:25:52 2015 UTC,"I would guess you could build 10 Defiant class ships for one Scimitar. And faster.  During the second world war, one German general half-jokingly said; One of our Tiger tanks is worth ten Russian T-34 tanks ... too bad they always bring eleven.  So there is strength in numbers, and in a war situation, the Federation would have simply outproduces, outnumbered, outmanoeuvred, and outfought the Romulans."

DaystromInstitute,3a9u7b,mojoworkin85,8,Fri Jun 19 18:41:10 2015 UTC,"I think it all comes down to tactics. The defiant class was designed for a specific type of warfare against a specific threat. The Borg. It was probably a defensive weapon against another Borg incursion but the Romulan cloaking device on the lead ship and the benefit of imaginative commanders proved it as a valuable forward tactical asset against the Dominion. It was not designed for long range exploration and most would have rarely left their home system.   The sovereign class is a different animal entirely. I know this is blasphemy but, its precursor, the galaxy, was just too much of a pure explorer. Let's remember that it was designed when the Romulans we're still in a decades long period of isolation. The Klingons were long time allies, the Borg were unknown, and the only real conflicts the Federation had were the Tzenkethi and the Cardassians. To put it bluntly it was designed in what you could call the the Pax Federatia.    When the sovereign came around it was a completely different political time. It wasn't a pure battlecruiser like the Prometheus but it wasn't a galaxy either. It was more like a balance of the two.   Now let's take a look at the Scimitar. This ship was designed during the early days of the Dominion War. Romulus was neutral at the time but they weren't stupid, they knew at some point they would be drawn in. The existence of the non-aggression pact, open borders to invasions, and the wholly genocidal theleron weapon strongly suggest that they were betting on joining the Dominion's side since the Federation would never condone such a weapon. If Sisko and Garak hadn't intervened that might have been what happened.   I suspect that they were planning to produce 3-5 of these monstrosities for very specific uses. In fleet engagements with the Klingons the weapon could be used to wipe out entire fleets of ships. Against the Federation the advanced cloak would allow them to slip behind the lines and wipe out the population of a member world or a colony while the armaments and fighters easily kept the planetary defenses at bay. The result is the neutralization of the Klingon offensive capability and the stretching of starfleet to protect every world in the entire Federation. This would have inevitably been the end of both nations.   When Vreenak was ""assassinated"" it changed the game. They could no longer use this weapon of mass genocide without jeopardizing relations with their allies. If they did they would be fighting on their own against the two greatest alliances that the quadrant had ever seen. So they kept the lead ship a secret until after the war when the could apply military pressure against the one remaining power that could pose a hindrance to the expansion of the Romulan Star Empire.  So yes the Enterprise was outgunned but the Scimitar was designed to do just that. The fatal flaw was the hubris and obsession of her commander not the design."
DaystromInstitute,3a9u7b,SHADOWJACK2112,6,Thu Jun 18 16:31:50 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it wasn't the romulans who designed the ship but rather shinzon and his group of rebels and it wasn't for the purpose of conquering the feds or klinks but rather to aid in shinzon's rebellion
DaystromInstitute,3a9u7b,BigTaker,5,Thu Jun 18 23:09:00 2015 UTC,"The Defiant would be equivalent to a fast attack destroyer. Small, fast, designed to outpower and out manoeuvre similar vessels.   The Scimitar was equivalent to a Battleship. Slow, but bringing overwhelming firepower to the battlefield."
DaystromInstitute,3a9u7b,sleep-apnea,4,Thu Jun 18 15:10:26 2015 UTC,"Again, the Scimitar had more photon torpedo launchers & pulse canons."
DaystromInstitute,3a9u7b,legendx,2,Thu Jun 18 13:49:56 2015 UTC,"The Defiant class is very powerful for it's size.  But it's still quite small with a crew of only 50 people.  It's more than a match for other ships that size like birds of prey, or the Jem'hidar fighters.  But it fought a refitted Excelsior class to a stand still.  So it's got as much fire power and shield strength as a ship of around 300 people.  The defiant is much smaller then a Sovereign class ship, which it'self is quite a bit smaller then the Scimitar.  The whole point of the Scimitar is that it's just huge and full of weapons.  It's designed to take on multiple large ships at once.  The Defiant is just way out of it's league against something like that."
DaystromInstitute,3a9u7b,slagathor1995,6,Mon Jun 22 18:20:55 2015 UTC,The defiant is a small ship (and a different class but ignoring that for a moment).. On a completely arbitrary scale of 1-10 for combat effectiveness and cost:  Defiant:  Combat: 7  Cost: 3    Scimitar  Combat: 10  Cost: 10  You can do the math to see many defiants can outmatch a scimitar for a fraction of the cost. To straight up compare the defiant to the scimitar is madness.
DaystromInstitute,3a9u7b,Roderick111,6,Thu Jun 18 16:15:03 2015 UTC,the only thing that seemed to out match the uss enterprice was the ability to fire under clock

DaystromInstitute,3a9u7b,SStuart,3,Thu Jun 18 18:44:46 2015 UTC,Yeah it's a shame. TNG deserved a better send off.
DaystromInstitute,3a9u7b,uptotwentycharacters,5,Thu Jun 18 18:47:50 2015 UTC,"The Defiant is a rare example of a pure warship in Starfleet, being designed completely for combat. Ships like the Akira and Sovereign classes are more combat oriented than, say, Galaxy and Excelsior class ships, but are still designed with multi-role (combat + diplomatic and scientific missions) capability in mind, since Starfleet doesn't consider it worthwhile to build large ships only capable of combat. And it's also important to keep in mind that the battle between the Enterprise-E and the Scimitar wasn't really a fair fight, as the Scimitar had begun the fight by surprising the Enterprise and disabling her warp core, leaving her with far less power available for engines and shields. If this had not happened, it would likely have been a far more even fight, even with the Scimitar's ability to fire while cloaked.  It's also important to realize that the Scimitar is a good bit larger than the Enterprise, which means, all other things being equal with regards to technology, it would be more powerful in combat. However, it would also be much more expensive, quite possibly more expensive than a squadron of smaller ships with the same total combat effectiveness. So the Scimitar might be worth 1.5 Sovereign class ships in combat, but the Federation could produce 3 Sovereign ships for the costs that went into building Scimitar. In other words, Scimitar may have been built as a big, powerful ship to create a show of force and impress people, rather than to be a cost-effective warship."
DaystromInstitute,3a9u7b,SStuart,4,Thu Jun 18 18:37:31 2015 UTC,"The Scimitar is depicted to be MUCH stronger than the Enterprise. The Enterprise isn't even in the same ballpark. Let's keep in mind that the Shinzon was even trying to disable the Enterprise at first, and had to explicitly tell the crew NOT to destroy the Enterprise on the opening volley.   The Defiant is not a 7 compared to the Scimitar's 10. (responding to the comment blow). The defiant isn't even close to a match to the E-E or the Galaxy Class."
DaystromInstitute,3a9u7b,DMPunk,4,Fri Jun 19 01:40:08 2015 UTC,"True, but keep in mind that the opening volley from the Scimitar did knock out the Enterprise's warp core before she could raise her shields, which obviously put her at a major disadvantage for the rest of the fight. And yes, the Defiant isn't a match for a big ship like the Enterprise, but it is far more powerful relative to its size than most Starfleet ships."
DaystromInstitute,3a97ry,brokenlogic18,12,Thu Jun 18 05:56:21 2015 UTC,"Has Barclay's anxiety ever actually hurt his personal or professional life to a degree to which it could be considered an anxiety disorder?  Yes, he has some trouble with social situations but I don't think it was portrayed as being serious enough to make him unable to deal with life’s ordinary demands and routines, which is the line that separates mental illness and just weird or abnormal behavior."
DaystromInstitute,3a97ry,KingofMadCows,11,Thu Jun 18 06:39:19 2015 UTC,"Twice during his career he develops a serious holodeck addiction (aboard the Enterprise and later with Voyager) and even recreates real people on the holodeck - which is implied to be unprofessional and unwanted. At least his later addiction turned obsession interferes with his professional life, as he refuses to accept orders from his commanding officer.   Of course his obsession later on enables Starfleet to actually contact Voyager, so the fallout of his behavior is never really examined. If Pathfinder would have been a failure, it is somewhat likely that they would have made him resign his commission."
DaystromInstitute,3a97ry,tadayou,3,Thu Jun 18 09:25:15 2015 UTC,"If his first holodeck ""addiction"" didn't interfere with his professional or personal life then can it be considered an addiction? I'm fairly certain that is a defining criteria for something to be considered a mental illness. That and if the behavior is illegal or highly disruptive/harmful to others. And making holograms of real people may be considered ""icky"" but it's not against any laws or regulations. This is could be an issue of what people consider to be abnormal behavior/thoughts and what are considered to be mental illness. Just because someone thinks or behaves out of the societal norm doesn't mean they're mentally ill. There are plenty of people who behave and think in ways that most people may think are disturbing or even bad but they may not be considered to have any mental illnesses because it doesn't negatively affect their lives, and it's not illegal or harmful to others. Heck, even certain behaviors that are considered illegal may not be considered mental illnesses, like doing certain drugs or being homosexual/transsexual in places where those things are banned.  And his second holodeck problem was more due to an obsession with Voyager rather than an addiction to the holodeck."
DaystromInstitute,3a97ry,KingofMadCows,2,Thu Jun 18 21:10:14 2015 UTC,"I think it is implied that his holodeck ""addiction"" interfered with his personal life in the sense, that he spent most of his time there, even interacting more with holo characters modeled after his crewmates than real people.

It just seems that Barclay goes a little too far.   And his second holodeck problem was more due to an obsession with Voyager rather than an addiction to the holodeck.   Your point being? Certainly that problem was triggered by his obsession to find Voyager. But by ""Pathfinder"", Barclay spent most of his time on the holodeck in a program were was seen as part of the crew. Again, he created holo characters instead of spending time in the real world. It's not just some inspirational escapism, it seems to be very disruptive (to the point that he uses the program to defy orders and trap security guards).

Barclay is clearly shown to receive treatment from Troi, though I'm not sure when exactly this started. I'd say people aboard the Enterprise (or in the Pathfinder Project, later on) are very aware of Barclay's condition, but they let him work there nevertheless. Heck, even though he has those issues, Barclay received a commission and became a member of Starfleet due to his skills - I doubt something like this were likely in modern day military organizations (or even academic and economic ones).   Is Barcaly ever truly laughed off? I remember a few people are annoyed by his inquiries (think his obsession with transporter creatures or Voyager) but do they ever make fun of him or even bully him? I haven't seen his TNG episodes in a while, so I'm seriously curious."

If 24th century treatment of mental health issues is so outstanding that Tasha is able to be a functional human being, most people in the 24th century have probably never noticed anyone with a mental illness that seriously affects them.  Aside from her habit of pulling a phaser on anything that looks at Picard funny, Tasha shows few if any symptoms of PTSD. That sets a certain minimum standard for how good mental health treatment can be for a motivated individual.  I would suggest that with the raised standards of living for Federation member worlds, a rather advanced academic understanding of the mind and brain, people who aren't mental health professionals just don't ever encounter anyone with pronounced mental issues."

Despite the side effects (foremost of which is an erosion of personality), he seems able to funciton at a fairly high level. Clearly there is an understanding of at least the more mechanical/regulatory aspects of the brain's operation though the more abstract things like personality and emotion may be harder to nail down."

She says it isn't gone, she's just masked it because they understand how well the brain works.

I am making a giant assumption that since Troi studied psychology on Betazoid they have one of the best counseling programs in the Federation if she wound up as counselor on the flagship.   Jack, Lauren and Patrick from DS9 - They seem to have at worst anxiety/personality disorders. I know people are freaked out because they are genetically modified.

Others value being seen with us, feeding off that unique/superior feeling. People will be driven by base urges towards those who are attractive. Some have psychological weaknesses that convince them that attraction is important.  A society that has easy access to great plastic surgery removes the unique quality of attractiveness. Anyone can look like that, it is not special.  How can one value being with an attractive person when everyone they know can do the same, they'll simply hop off to the holosuites.  Base urges are likely a non-issue in a society with holo technology. Similarly, psychological problems are likely to be far less common and less intense.  In the Federation, it just makes sense for people to focus more on career, self improvement, friendship, love and family than to worry about their looks.

I suppose someone could argue that he went bald as a cadet, used some treatment to grow his hair just after he graduated (when we see him in ""Tapestry"") and then it slowly receded again, but this time he let it stick? It's possible, but doesn't jam with the lack of vanity we know from Picard.   Of course, he was a lot younger so maybe he got less vane as he aged? If Shinzon is any indication..."

We select our mates by qualities we find attractive. Also, global travel has increased genetic mixing between distant families. These combined drive our evolution toward our shared ideal of beauty. Genetic variation makes our offspring healthier. Healthy offspring have better proportioned bodies. Ideal proportions enhance beauty. This is a process known as domestication. Just as we have domesticated our animals to produce cute aesthetically pleasing offspring, we have domesticated ourselves to be the same."

I believe this is another instance of what we're told being different than what we're shown. While we can all point towards Gene's comments on Picard's baldness, the fact of the matter is that we see time and time again instances of one character finding another attractive (and this is before they get to know them, so there's no accounting for inner beauty.) If people can be considered physically attractive then there must be some general standard of beauty that is valued when finding a mate.   Given that, i cannot see a reason why people would not want to take an extremely simple procedure to look better. Once it becomes that easy it's honestly not too different from wearing makeup, doing your hair, or having an affectatious beard. I think it's silly to suggest that star trek society has evolved to a point where physical attractiveness is meaningless, and if attractiveness is important to at least a portion of the society, then people will elect to improve themselves."

They probably would get to Earth, but were in no hurry since there was no threat on that side. Romulans always struck me as more paranoid and insular than expansionist. The Klingons would probably be a much bigger problem for them, requiring the bulk of their attention.  We know the Vulcans were in Sector 001 as early as 2063, though.

Doesn't mean your capital has those resources. Japan in 1942 controlled this, yet the Japanese home islands had very little in strategic resources. The only things they had were factories that ran on imported raw materials.  The Federation could very well be the same way, the Sol system simply has the factories, military command and R&D facilities, the raw materials to fuel them are actually located in other star systems.  Look at what the first thing Earth does when it becomes interstellar capable: it sends out colony ships and builds a merchant marine before building a starfleet.

DaystromInstitute,3a6pvf,androidbitcoin,10,Wed Jun 17 17:38:32 2015 UTC,"It makes little sense to transport directly to a planet if you are exploring. This would seem to expose the away party to unnecessary risks. The best way to play it safe when venturing into the unknown is to have a ship in orbit prepared to offer backup.  Transporter signals are also well known to be capable of being sabotaged. Perhaps a counter measure was discovered, where one could disrupt the signal along its trajectory. So if one were to send an explosive via transport then an outside party would be capable of detonating said explosive at any point along the trajectory (including immediately after it leaves the ship/starbase/etc.). If one were to send living beings, they could be killed at a whim.  Shields, phasers, photon torpedos, evasive maneuvers and plain old strategic retreat are things that keep Starfleet officers alive. Transporters cannot employ any of these measures, so unless they are utterly immune to all sabotage (we have seen countless examples that this isn't the case) then it would massively increase the risk.  If the Federation had employed this technology in earnest, they would open the door for anyone who figures out a counter measure to effectively render the Federation completely inert. A few enemy starships sprinkled throughout Federation space could effectively disrupt all travel and defense for Federation worlds. If Starfleet had been decommissioned, then it may take decades to get back to the point where the Federation could send their own ships out to eliminate this threat."

However, phasers are powered by the warp core (though they could use the impulse reactors as a backup, albeit at reduced power, as fusion doesn't produce nearly as much power as a matter/antimatter reaction). And photon torpedoes, although not requiring much energy to fire, do themselves contain antimatter which may be difficult to transport. If antimatter cannot be transported, there certainly are ways to design a ""ship"" as a transportable orbital fire-support platform without any antimatter-based systems, though it would require several deviations from normal starship design practice (i.e. replacing the photon torpedoes with more traditional fusion or kinetic weapons, and adding extra batteries and fusion reactors to power the phasers)."

DaystromInstitute,3a6pvf,1ilypad,6,Thu Jun 18 02:57:42 2015 UTC,"My theory on this subject:   Transporters are essentially a form of inter-dimensional travel via ""subspace.""   They're often envisioned as working as a ""beam"" in real space, but in fact, the spatial displacement is occurring without traversing the intervening space.  The subject is essentially disassembled and then fed through a microscopic subspace (read: inter-dimensional) portal as a ""matter stream."" The transporter is also able to handle reassembly via this subspace portal. This is why a transporter pad is not required at the remote site. The source transporter can essentially reach through the portal it creates to reassemble the subject via the same mechanisms used for disassembly on the pad.  Subspace travel has no known range limit, as evidenced by the Bajoran wormhole and other anomalies.  What does have a limit is sensor data, and the ability to reliably maintain a stable artificially created subspace corridor over which to transmit a subject.  The Iconians were able to overcome this obstacle and create stable, humanoid-sized subspace corridors that required no disassembly/reassembly.  The reason that shields, atmospheric disturbances, and large geological barriers are a hindrance to transporters is that in order to safely transport to a location, you must have a perfect, latency-free sensor reading of that destination so that you can open and maintain a subspace corridor with an exit point at that location.  In the Prime Universe at least, this obstacle has yet to be overcome by existent Alpha quadrant races."
DaystromInstitute,3a6pvf,jerslan,3,Wed Jun 17 18:39:20 2015 UTC,"It was proven in the reboot and various episodes that some transporters are are capable of transporting vast distances    In Canon: I believe the technology for long range matter transportation wasn't worked out until the late 23rd century. The reason they can teleport so far in the reboot is because Prime Spock brought back the long range teleport formulas that Prime Scotty figured out after he was rescued in the TNG episode Relics. It's just a piece of future tech that they acquired.   His vision was to make Starfleet obsolete as individuals can transport themselves, materials, etc to distant planets, space stations, etc without the need of a ship. Militarily you could transport weapons, bombs ect right in front of oncoming ships.   Scotty finally made his vision a reality 200 years later. It just took awhile. You can see the progression of it developing as the timeline unfolds.  Ent: Used only in Emergencies due to it being.. dangerously buggy and inaccurate. Primarly used to transport cargo to and fro.   ToS: More commonly used but are still looked at wearily by the population since the uncommon accidents still occurred. Relied more on shuttles to transport to and fro.  TnG: Teleportation technology is much improved is used more commonly and is accepted for inter-planetary travel (Earth apparently has a system since Sisko and Nog were moving from SF to New Orleans quickly - plus moving between surface and orbital). though accidents still occur, they tend to be much more minor. No one is afraid of the transporter anymore, except for the elderly McCoy.   PostTNG/reboots: The rescued Scotty figures out the math behind long range teleportation, finally allowing transport across planetary systems and local stellar groups. Khan used this tech in the reboots to transport from Earth to Kronos."

A Klingon would not simply go through the motions of an important and life altering ritual because he is expected to do so.  If Worf truly didn't wish to die, he would have felt guilt over being an unworthy Klingon but ultimately owned the decision and lived the rest of his life on his own terms.  I cannot see any iteration of Worf's character that would knowingly declare his wish to perform this ceremony while secretly believing that the person he asked would be uncooperative.  That is extremely manipulative and dishonest, and completely outside of Worf's character.  However, he may have subconsciously chosen Riker, for all the reasons you mention.

This is something that bothered me as well as I rewatched this episode - Riker is one of the two best choices on the ship, but when the field is narrowed to crew who have any familiarity with Klingons, he becomes the worse of the two.   I do think that Picard is able to maintain a dispassionate distance and calmly advocate for Worf's choices in part because he wasn't chosen.   This mirrors the dynamic between Crusher and Russel - Russel is able to advocate for a very utilitarian approach because she sees Worf as a patient, not as a friend and patient. She has the luxury of distance to observe that the certainty of Worf's suicide (short of major, extensive and involuntary therapy while restrained) is a worse possibility than the potential for him to recover with her experimental procedure.   This thematic repetition made me like this episode a lot more than I remembered, because it does a really good job of presenting both sides of a controvertial issue, from multiple different perspectives, without making any of them obviously wrong or completely right. Compare and contrast with ""Measure of a Man,"" where Riker's job as the advocate for the prosecution is to be a bully. Here, it's a lot more nuanced than I remembered.

Let me show you something. I've been experimenting with DNA based generators. This is a genetronic replicator. It reads the DNA coding of damaged organs, translates that into a specific set of replicant instructions and then begins to grow a replacement.   CRUSHER: I've read of some of the preliminary work you've done.   RUSSELL: The early results have been very encouraging. Beverly, the genetronic replicator can create a completely new neural conduit for your Lieutenant Worf.   CRUSHER: Replace his entire spinal column?   RUSSELL: Exactly. Instead of splicing and pasting together broken connections like a couple of glorified tailors, we create a new living system.   CRUSHER: I had no idea you were already using this on humanoids.

DaystromInstitute,3a2tl8,TheHYPO,2,Wed Jun 17 01:55:41 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with both you and /u/thehulk0560 in part - as far as functional organs are concerned, I feel that a kidney vs. a bladder are miles apart. (Caveat: I have no medical training). As far as I understand it, a bladder is simply a sac whose sole job is as a holding bag for urine before excreting it from the body. An article on the bladder doctor suggests that they took the patient's own existing bladder cells and put them basically into a bladder ""mold"" and replicated them and that created a new bladder. Given that the bladder is really just a storage bag, I can see how this would work (it still had to be attached to the existing diseased bladder though). Comparatively, I would have thought that creating an organ like a kidney that has a biochemical function and might (I don't know) be made up of more than one type of tissue would be notable more complicated than simply growing some existing kidney cells in a bean-shaped mold. Then again, I could be wrong.  I also note that it's very preliminary and the a) long-term success and b) widespread application of this technique is still unknown.  That said,  the article indicates that they are working on over 20 different tissues and organs. If they are already working on that, it seems unlikely that we're still 400 years away from routine regrowth of at least some damaged organs.  I recognize this is a spinal column and that's probably one of it not the most complicated elements of the nervous system besides the brain itself, and it may be a lot harder to both grow and then actually replace a complete spinal chord.  This argument doesn't quite hold if you accept that Russell is suggesting that she's never done ANY organ replacement. We all know Picard has an artificial heart (not a replicated or even a donated one - you'd think they would have a good method of keeping donor hearts in some sort of stasis and would have a decent supply of them available in hospitals by 400 years from now, but maybe the artificial ones were found to be superior to donor hearts.  in any even, things like bladders or kidneys may not be on Russell's radar because there's already solutions like the one in that article - she may be only looking at spinal chords or brains or lungs or eyes or other more complicated organ structures.  I think if we are trying to find reality in trek timelines, it's somewhat impossible, given TNG is set 400 years from now, imo, because technology will likely advance so far in 400 years that we today can not even comprehend what will be invented and developed. Further, the mere creation of the sci-fi story will spur technological advancement.  For example, the computer systems of TNG that seem so ridiculously advanced in 1987 are actually not THAT far off from today's technology thanks to the internet and other networking technology. Voice-recognition has improved dramatically and things like IBM's Watson mean that we're on our way towards computers that can respond intelligently to what are asking.  The Enterprise itself is a massive technological achievement that indeed might take 400 years or longer to achieve (in around 50 years we've only really come from a 3-man spacecraft to a dozen-man space station and a shuttle that can carry half a dozen. In another 400 years are we going to be flying around at light speed in 1000-person ships? I don't know.  But I do suspect that there will be technologies that ""do things"" for us that we can't even envision. I dunno... maybe implants that allow us to take photos with our eyes or control devices simply by thought. Given we have google glass today, it wouldn't surprise me if 400 years from now it's routine to either have implants or wear a device that gives you an augmented reality view. Lots of other things that we can't envision today. Maybe an iron-man style suit will be technologically possible. Who knows.  I feel like (bearing in mind the time they were created) all of the Trek series include both reasonable guesses at the technological levels of those timelines (massive spaceships) along with very conservative guesses (will we still be pressing buttons or using ""disks"" to transport data, etc.).  One thing that does bother me is that when we had Enterprise (2150s) debut, I frankly have doubts that within 140 years we'll be at the level of a ship of that caliber (warp drive or not - we're talking artificial gravity, weapons, communications, sensors, etc.), and then to go to the 2360s - about 200 years later), I don't see the Enterprise D as a big enough advancement from that NX-01 technology (we're supposed to go from a space shuttle to gravity-plated warp ship with elevators and a self-sustaining power supply within 140 years, and then in 200 years go from that to essentially just a bigger version of that).  I'd have loved to have seen NX-01 be a lot more stripped down and closer to today's technology (I haven't watched Enterprise a lot, but they don't even use ""disks"" like TOS did, do they? They sort of retconned that out to match today's technology?... More cramped accommodations, less fancy equipment; ladders rather than elevators. Maybe have gravity limited to certain critical areas (I know, sfx costs go up)... I think that would have been a more believable evolution. When Cochrane did his warp flight in 2063, he was in a cramped cockpit attached to a missile not that far off of the spacecraft of the 1960s (100 years later) - then within 100 years more, we're looking at a ship the size of enterprise. Maybe I'm wrong and maybe it's really just the engine/power technology that's the sticking point in space travel and building a huge cruise-ship in space isn't terribly complicated as long as you have the power to operate/propel it...  but getting all that material into space in the first place still seems like a very resource-intensive job."

Russell is clearly made out to be wrong, though - she's more interested in testing theories and advancing medicine than she is in helping patients right in front of her. Picard, on the other hand, is doing his usual moralizing. Could be that Stewart is just a way better actor."
DaystromInstitute,3a2tl8,TheHYPO,2,Wed Jun 17 01:23:49 2015 UTC,"She's made out to be less personable. That doesn't make her wrong. She was willing to put aside her research to help Worf, although we'll never know if she would have suggested it if he'd agreed to the future leg braces. But when she suggested the procedure to the patient, the choice was between a risky procedure and the patient's certain death. That's not 'clearly wrong' to me."
DaystromInstitute,3a2tl8,calgil,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:36:36 2015 UTC,I believe the choice was between a risky procedure and the patient WANTING to die or possible suicide... Am I wrong?

DaystromInstitute,3a2tl8,TheHYPO,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:26:11 2015 UTC,"Death because the quality of life offered would make death the best solution (not our morals but it's made clear Klingons view Worf's situation as worse than death. So it's a choice between a risky procedure, death, or a fate worse than death)."
DaystromInstitute,3a2tl8,MageTank,2,Wed Jun 17 17:28:24 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't include death in that set. When she offered the procedure, I don't think Russell considered that Worf would commit suicide. She simply knew that he would not be able to walk (and would be very unhappy about it) or she could experiment on him and risk him dying to try and get him to walk again (and advance her research).  But every other character is unwilling to accept that Worf is in a ""fate worse than death"" because he can't walk except Russell. It begs the question of whether she was not emotionally attached to Worf, or if she was just concerned only with her research and didn't care about the patient."
DaystromInstitute,3a2tl8,skwerrel,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:47:35 2015 UTC,"In Worf's case, Russell's position can be argued, certainly. In the case of the cargo bay patients, Dr. Crusher at least comes down on Russell pretty hard. Picard suggests - but does not order - that Russell be allowed to operate on Worf because otherwise Worf will kill himself. It's Russell's larger philosophy that paints her as a villain, on the same spectrum as Crell Moset in VOY: ""Nothing Human"" (though not nearly as harshly)."
DaystromInstitute,3a2tl8,MageTank,6,Wed Jun 17 18:50:39 2015 UTC,"It's a good question. To be honest, Riker seemed like a random choice out of anyone from the main crew that Worf could have called friend. The only thing I can think of was there was a conflict of interest by asking Picard to kill him, as Captain, but that isn't fair because a similar conflict would have to occur with Riker.   This brings up an interesting question...Did Worf consider Picard a friend? We know he respected him and that he was his commanding officer, but would Worf consider him a personal friend, or just a superior that he respected?"
DaystromInstitute,3a2tl8,deathsmiled,9,Tue Jun 16 21:03:30 2015 UTC,"I think when Picard joins the poker game at the very end of the series, they are basically implying that up until that very moment, he wasn't ""friends"" with anyone on the senior staff (with the exception of Beverly, and then only due to their past relationship).  The spot at the table was always open to him, and he specifically chose not to sit down."
DaystromInstitute,3a2tl8,skwerrel,2,Tue Jun 16 21:33:20 2015 UTC,"Which what I was trying to imply. It seems a condition of the ritual is that it is performed by someone in your house or a close friend. Picard didn't fit that criteria, making him exempt. Riker was the closest thing to a friend, though I felt that one of his martial arts students might have been a better choice..."
DaystromInstitute,3a2tl8,TheHYPO,2,Tue Jun 16 22:42:28 2015 UTC,"I agree. What I don't understand is why Riker wouldn't do it. I remember when I watched it with my dad in the 90s; he said Riker got ""soft"" and was kind of whiny or a pussy (can't remember exactly). I had no clue what he was talking about until this year when I rewatched it. This episode in particular I thought wtf? He character leading up to this made me assume this is something he would do without hesitation even if he didn't agree."
DaystromInstitute,3a2tl8,drafterman,2,Wed Jun 17 00:05:12 2015 UTC,"I think the writers were probably trying to show that cultural appreciation and respect only goes so far. At some point Riker hit a line where he couldn't not be human, even if he intellectually understood that his friend didn't need or want him to be human. The very friendship that caused Worf to ask Riker to perform the ritual (because his culture/nature tells him it is right and good to seek a loved one for this) is what leads to Riker's refusal (because his culture/nature tells him you don't kill a friend who has every prospect to live a long life just because they're crippled).  However,  I say ' I think the writers...' because I actually don't think it fit Riker's character, and agree that he probably would've gone through with it - for Worf, knowing it's appropriate within the context - even if he didn't really agree with the Klingon point of view on that subject. But then again, maybe this was meant to be an intentional display of hypocrisy/weakness - showing that when it really came down to it, Riker couldn't stomach Klingon culture after all."
DaystromInstitute,3a2tl8,kslidz,2,Wed Jun 17 00:27:35 2015 UTC,"Riker also isn't shy about advocating for an alien culture to change - or at least insisting that alien cultures are merely guests on the Enterprise. There was a thread here recently about him rudely ordering Ensign Ro to remove her Bajoran earring when she first arrived. He wants the J'naii to accept gendered people. (It's the very next episode, in fact, and Frakes's delivery of some lines is very similar. Compare ""That doesn't mean his life is over."" here and ""She is [normal]!"" in ""The Outcast"".)"
DaystromInstitute,3a2tl8,Kamala_Metamorph,2,Wed Jun 17 01:06:37 2015 UTC,"This may not be a comparable situation, but in ''Reunion'' when Worf is about to kill Duras, Riker enters at the critical moment and yells ""Worf!"" as in ""don't do it Worf"", even though I'm sure Riker understands Worf's motivation and it's probably also a very Riker thing to do... I think when it comes to killing, it's a whole different ballgame than to just say ""that's their culture"".  When Timicin's culture requires him to die in ''Half a Life'', I don't think anyone on the ship would agree to be the one to CAUSE the death, even if they respect that that's what his culture requires and don't stop him from returning to his people to ""finish the job""."
DaystromInstitute,3a2tl8,eXa12,5,Wed Jun 17 15:34:30 2015 UTC,"But Worf never truly wants to go through with suicide.   Ultimately I agree with this. It's made evident throughout the series (especially with DS9) that Worf is in love with the idea of Klingon culture, but is completely disconnected from it in practice. Notably Guinan and Dax recognize this and call Worf out on it each during one of his ""Klingons do not..."" tirades. Worf, essentially, is Don Quixote for Klingons. He has this romanticized ideal of Klingon honor and culture that has no basis in reality. Granted, this is excusable, given that he was raised by humans; his idea of Klingon culture is colored through Federation goggles. It'd be like a Chinese-American, raised since a child in America, adopting Chinese culture as learned through wuxia movies like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""  Ultimately, Worf is idealistic, not realistic. For this alone we can accuse him of only superficially requesting Hegh’bat, without realistically desiring it.  However, I completely disagree with your notes on Riker regarding his relationship with Worf.  Riker vs. Picard: Klingon Culture  Both Riker and Picard are very knowledgeable of Klingon culture, at least as far as Federation humans can be. But, the kind of knowledge and how they acquired it differs greatly. Picard has been tapped by various Klingons for certain rituals. To choose the next Emperor and to help defend Worf during his discommendation. To prepare, Picard no doubt researched Klingon law and customs fastidiously.  By contrast, when opting for the Klingon exchange program, Riker, while doing some research, chose immersion. He dived into Klingon culture, eating their food, consulting the only Klingon he had available. No doubt he tried a number of holodeck programs available to him.  The resulting difference is that Picard is more in tune with the letter of Klingon culture, whereas Riker is in tune with its spirit. The faux pas you attribute to Riker really aren't. It isn't required that Riker kill the commander. Indeed, when Worf tries the same against Martok and fails Worf was not seriously trying to kill Martok nor did Martok kill Worf in return. Again Worf's statement that killing one's superior is expected is evidence of his idealistic interpretation of Klingon culture. In reality, actually killing one's commander is probably a very rare circumstance.  Both his conversations with Kurn, and his knowledge about gagh are excusable, given that the latter is probably due to incomplete knowledge in Federation databanks, and the former because Kurn was supposed to be adapting to service about a human vessel, as Riker was expected to adapt to service on a Klingon vessel. It didn't work because Kurn wasn't serious about the exchange program, it was just a deceit to get close to Worf.  As far as ""human trickery,"" both Riker and Picard are guilty of this, moreso Picard. Picard, on numerous occasions, has used his political relationship with Gowron to ""motivate"" obstinate Klingons to do his bidding. Threatening to tattle on a Klingon commander or governor is hardly the Klingon thing to do.  Ultimately I think Riker is more in tune as evident by their actual interactions with Klingons. Simply put: Riker fits in. Watch the scene where he is dining with the other Klingon officers. He seamlessly fits in with their banter and laughter. He earns their respect, not as a superior, but as an equal. Picard is standoffish. He may understand what is expected, but he doesn't really roll with the punches as smoothly as Riker does.  Riker's relationship with Worf  It is understated, but it is there. The fact that the show didn't hit you over the head with it every episode, or explicitly state it doesn't mean it wasn't there. As they say, a quality of a truly close relationship is the fact that you don't have to say it's there. Consider that, with two acquaintances, it feels awkward just sitting together not saying anything, whereas truly close friends can just sit and hang out and feel comfortable.  Riker taps Worf to be his second in command in Peak Performance (season 2), Worf asks to go with Riker to his next command in Icarus Factor (season 2), despite being disgusted by J'naii culture, Worf opts to go with Riker to rescue Soren in Outcast (season 5). Worf probably respects Picard more, but that is the respect one has toward a boss (one who is admittedly aloof and separated from his troops, as Picard laments in The Defector). His relationship with Riker is definitely more familial.  Would Picard have done it?  I think it's an interesting question as to whether or not Picard would have gone through with it. I think Worf chose Riker because his relationship with Riker is more closely to family than Picard, where the relationship is more professional, not because of subconscious knowledge that Riker was the choice least likely to go through with it.  In his conversation with Riker, Picard chooses his words very carefully (as he always does). Importantly, he never explicitly condones or approves of Worf's decision to die. He merely notes to Riker that the Klingon point-of-view is very different from the human point-of-view. Of note:   We don't have to agree with it, we don't have to understand it, but we do have to respect his beliefs.   And:   He's asking for your help because you're his friend. That means that you're going to have to make your decision based on that friendship.   Picard's use of ""we"" rather than ""you"" implies that Picard doesn't agree with that course of action. Later, Picard encourages Beverly to go with the risky procedure precisely because he doesn't want Worf to commit suicide. Die, perhaps, but die fighting to live. His decision is not rooted in acceptance of Klingon culture, but acknowledgement of Worf's stubbornness.  Additionally, Picard's ambiguous reference to ""help"" - to me - suggests that Picard is trying to get Riker to actually help Worf away from this course of action, to find a middle path between killing Worf and out-right refusing. To use his friendship with Worf to actually, legitimately, help him through this, whatever that help that may be. Picard is the king of the middle road, finding the secret route that unties the Gordian knot.  I don't think Picard would have gone through with it. Picard probably wouldn't have been as judgy as Riker was, but he would have done his damnedest to convince Worf otherwise (as he's done before when Worf's Klingon-ness conflicts with Federation values)."

DaystromInstitute,3a2tl8,13104598210,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:46:21 2015 UTC,"All fair points. I agree that Riker fits in with Klingons better than Picard does. By nature, Picard's relationship to the Klingons is more official and authoritative. Riker can pretty much be one of the guys. He often fits in with Klingons better than Worf does, in fact - precisely because Worf is so concerned about being the ideal Klingon. Riker's real strength is his willingness to try just about anything once, a devil-may-care attitude that many Klingons appreciate.  Still - the friendship between Worf and Riker gets pretty much no screen time between season 2 and this season 5 episode, while multiple stories focus on Picard participating in Klingon law alongside Worf.   If nothing else, Worf not even informing his captain of his decision just seems odd to me."
DaystromInstitute,3a2tl8,jerslan,3,Wed Jun 17 19:27:52 2015 UTC,"That's a really interesting theory! Messes a bit with my head-canon that I adopted last week though. Lt. /u/drafterman last week suggested that Riker / Worf actually had a very strong understanding and mutual values because both were men of action.   Maybe you or the Lieutenant could merge these two theories together??   edit: Though, I have to add, based on everything we know about Worf, I'd have to fundamentally disagree that he would purposefully avoid death. He wouldn't consider it an honorable dodge, even though he values guile, he values his honor way more. He would consider avoiding suicide a cowardly move and I can't see how to reconcile your theory with that."
DaystromInstitute,3a2tl8,RandyFMcDonald,3,Tue Jun 16 21:45:03 2015 UTC,"Worf and Riker have more in common, yes - but Worf doesn't confide in Riker like he does in Picard. (See the end of ""The Drumhead"", ""Sins of the Father"" and ""Redemption"", etc.) I've no doubt that Worf would rather hang out with Riker, shoot some pool, drink some prune juice, punch some dudes. They enjoyed working together and did it well. But if it's supposed to be a family member, Picard seems more like a father than Riker does a brother.  Then again, I can't recall a single father-son relationship in TNG that went terribly well, so it might have been a blind spot for the writers."

DaystromInstitute,3a2tl8,berlinbrown,2,Wed Jun 17 09:57:10 2015 UTC,"I think the difference is that Picard is somewhat of a father figure to Worf, whereas Riker is closer to a peer, in age, rank, experience, and in his prowess as a warrior.  When Worf wants leniency, understanding, or sometimes even a kick in the butt, he goes to Picard for the kinds of things you'd talk to your father about.  Even a Klingon would try to avoid asking one's own father to kill them.  Fathers should never have to bury sons, in any culture.  And since Alexander could not perform the rite, and Kurn was unavailable, I think Riker was the next logical choice, as the closest thing Worf has to a brother-in-arms.  They have a solid friendship and working relationship, and have trusted each other with their lives many times.  Worf assumed, incorrectly, that Riker would give Worf's culture the same respect as Picard, and honorably perform the ritual.  And it is exactly that ""cultural tourist"" part of Riker that refuses.  Simply because a ritual has been practiced for thousands of years does not mean that it is still valid.  We see this kind of dilemma unfolding through Vulcan rituals of antiquity that have illogically survived the transition to logic many times in Enterprise, and somewhat in TOS, yet in TNG and DS9, incongruous facets of Klingon culture are often given much wider latitude than Vulcan illogic.  (VOY breaks this trend)  Riker loves to experience those things that are unique to modern cultures - the food, the sex, the, um... the sex... - yet he has no patience for outmoded rituals or attitudes rooted in the past that (in his mind) should no longer exist in a developed society.  This could be as simple as a draconian legal system (TNG: ""Justice"") being defeated with a single sentence, or as complex as Klingon posthumous honor that's tackled a dozen times or more with varying results."
DaystromInstitute,3a2tl8,Telewyn,2,Wed Jun 17 01:05:40 2015 UTC,"Riker often directly commands Worf on dangerous away missions,   Come on, you should know better. Riker sends people on away missions regardless of his feelings for that person because he is a good first officer. Personal feelings don't factor into the decision.   and while they play poker in a group, their one-on-one hangout sessions decline steeply after their first two years on the Enterprise.   We don't know what happens off camera.   Alexander is so clearly incapable of performing the ritual that even entertaining the possibility would betray Worf’s own fear.   This isn't a weak objection at all--he clearly is too young and raised too human to handle it.   If he really wanted to die, Worf should have asked Captain Picard.   Yes, this is a strong argument. But since the ritual ideally requires the youngest son, the hierarchical relationship between the suicide and the person performing the ceremony might be important. It might be dishonorable to ask an older generation/elder figure to perform the ritual."
DaystromInstitute,3a2tl8,metakepone,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:01:20 2015 UTC,"We don't know what happens off camera   You're right, but the safe assumption is that they don't socialize as a pair much off camera.   When we see them both in Ten Forward (on camera), they're rarely together unless they're part of a group. Other than that? Yeah... They're buddies (at best) and respected co-workers.... They're not friends in the same way that Data and Geordi are. I suspect it's just a personality difference."

DaystromInstitute,3a3425,Ramady,7,Wed Jun 17 18:11:11 2015 UTC,"Well I think explaining Troi's presence is rather simple: Psychiatrists/psychologists are needed, particularly on a long-term mission. Using Starfleet doctors and psychologists rather than civilian ""contractors"" (whatever that means in the Federation's economy) is good because it fosters a sense of commitment on the part of the doctor, it helps the espirit de corps of the whole organization, and you're going to need a branch of Starfleet dealing with medical matters anyways.  What's tougher to explain is the presence of civilian scientists like Keiko. Starfleet has botanists, after all. It has all kinds of scientists, historians, anthropologists, etc. Why bring Keiko along instead of Lt. Botanist?  One reason could be that Keiko is an especially skilled botanist, renowned for her expertise. She's not just any botanist -- she's one of the best botanists in the Federation. Tagging along on the Enterprise might be a tremendous honor and opportunity for her (on the other hand, it might be kind of a drag -- see Dr. Lense's description of her role on the Lexington. But the Enterprise seems to have a more varied mission than did the Lexington).  Another alternative is that Starfleet simply does not have enough qualified scientists in every field, and so it reaches out to civilian universities and laboratories in order to fill in gaps.  One odd thing is that the waiters we see in TNG are civilians, but it looks like in a few of the movies (Star Trek V and VI, off the top of my head) that the Enterprise-A had uniformed crewmembers perform those duties. Maybe that changed in the intervening decades, or maybe the Enterprise-D was a special case, given its enormous size."
DaystromInstitute,3a3425,zuludown888,5,Tue Jun 16 22:35:35 2015 UTC,I would subscribe to the Keiko is an outstanding Botanist theory. I imagine she made a proposal and asked for resources. The Enterprise-D is a heck of a resource. In order to be granted access someone would have to be among the best.
DaystromInstitute,3a3425,danatblair,6,Tue Jun 16 22:51:39 2015 UTC,"Troi was a practicing psychologist but her role was also to be an adviser to Picard, especially in diplomatic situations. A Starfleet officer with the ability to have access to privileged information and have at least basic training in combat and starship operations was better suited to the role than a civilian.  Keiko probably worked for some civilian organization and was on board for a set time period to conduct specific research that required the Enterprise and its facilities."
DaystromInstitute,3a3425,iansarmy1,10,Wed Jun 17 04:44:43 2015 UTC,"I think it's simply because, whether you're in Starfleet or not, you have a lot of freedom as to your role on a huge starship like the Enterprise-D. The bridge officers, though, with few exceptions, need to be Starfleet officers. Apart from that, though, it seems that anyone could be picked to fill Keiko's role on the Enterprise, Starfleet or not. Clearly, the entire tone of the Enterprise-D means that you've got to have some level of civilian intermingling, so it just happened that one of the civilians filling that role was Keiko."
DaystromInstitute,3a3425,Darth_Rasputin32898,5,Tue Jun 16 21:20:00 2015 UTC,"That's because those decisions are arbitrary. Deanna is a Starfleet Counselor because she wanted to join Starfleet and be a Counselor in Starfleet. Keiko is a civilian botanist because she wanted to be a botanist but not join Starfleet.  Military and government employees often work with external contractors, even on military installations. Though the Enterprise is a vessel, it's size and complexity make it more of a military base or city. Remember, the ostensible goal of Starfleet is exploration and it's unlikely that all exploratory activities are performed by Starfleet. There are plenty of civilian scientists doing civilian sciency things. So rather than have and maintain their own fleets of ships, they piggyback on Starfleet vessels. It would be contrary to the Federation principles of exploration to deny civilians this kind of access. So Keiko was aboard as a civilian botanist, but probably doing her own research (personal research under some sort of grant) or in support of some civilian scientific agency that was granted access to the Enterprise for this purpose."

DaystromInstitute,3a3425,kslidz,4,Thu Jun 18 18:36:24 2015 UTC,"Well, we know the Enterprise carried many civilians. I think the whole intention of the Enterprise-D was to be more of a space-traveling city than a military ship. They were trying to bring a little slice of Federation life (not just Starfleet life) to the new life they explored. One way you can think of it is that a number of civilians applied to be taken along with the Enterprise and other Galaxy-Class ships, to further their own research and careers. Keiko wasn't working for Starfleet, she was working for her own career and interests and Enterprise presented an opportunity to her and a bunch of other civilians.   Troi on the other hand is a bit strange. We see that she is in fact an officer, which means that she went to the academy, but I really can't see her ever going through the academy training, she seemed at best a non-comm."
DaystromInstitute,3a3425,MageTank,5,Tue Jun 16 23:04:38 2015 UTC,"Deanna is Ship's Counselor to everyone, including the Captain and other Starfleet personnel. She would, by necessity, need to be vetted and given appropriate security clearances (probably pretty high level, so she can Counsel the Captain regarding Command Decisions and such). Now, they could give this to a Civilian, but it's way easier to use a trained Military Officer. Since most Starfleet ships wouldn't have Civilians on board (this seemed to be limited to Galaxy-Class ships), Starfleet would already have an appropriate means of training Officers as Counselors.  As for Keiko? Her job as a Botanist on the Enterprise didn't require her to need a high level security clearance. Since the Enterprise could utilize Civilians, they could pick the best and brightest minds regardless of Military Status. In these cases they reported to Department heads (which all appeared to be Starfleet Officers).   That sort of brings up another point... There were about a thousand people on board at any point in time... Clearly Deanna couldn't be solely responsible for their mental well-being. She likely had some Civilian therapists who helped off-set that work-load, especially since she seemed to spend an inordinate amount of time on the Bridge. So if we assume that Department Heads must be Starfleet Officers (so that all Departments are within the proper chain-of-command), then that's another good reason for Deanna to be an officer."

I think the term ""starfleet"" covers both.  The military side of starfleet would involve people that at some point might have to use military force.  A starfleet research vessel might have mostly civilians with a military captain and security staff in case they get attacked. A purewar vessel would only have military staff.  The Enterprise is a bit of both.  Keiko:  It makes sense for scientists to have both military and civilian members as is done today.  People engaged in research would probably be civilian, in areas where science knowledge is needed for warfare, military would be better suited (energy, medical staff, phenomenons, etc.).  Studying and cataloging plants would be mostly a civilian duty.  Troi:  She is not just a shrink.  She holds a command role.  I can't remember the episode but she had to do training that would allow her to take over the command of the ship if she had to.  This has to be military."
DaystromInstitute,3a3425,GimliGloin,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:09:37 2015 UTC,Deanna is an officer because she took officer training in her spare time onboard the enterprise and passed the tests required. it's the B plot of one of the season 7 episodes.

The events of The Ultimate Computer, while tragic, wouldn't be enough to besmirch one of the greatest scientific minds of his time.  Funnily enough, I can't help but draw parallels to Henry Pym in the Ant-Man comics.   You see, Henry Pym is arguably the brightest mind in the Marvel universe but while he has an unparalleled understanding of theoretical physics and robotics, he lacks what the other great minds of his time have. He doesn't have the paternal nature that makes Reed Richards an inspiring leader in the field, or the charisma to join Tony Stark as a captain of industry.   Like Daystrom, Pym was an imperfect man with social issues—the guy was an actual brilliant engineer, flaws and all.  But, like Daystrom, he wanted to do something that would make the world a better place. In a world full of heroes and conflict, he wanted to do more than any one man ever could.  Daystrom built M-5, Pym built Ultron. Both were devastated when their creations turned into monsters because this would be how history remembered them.   But where Ultron lived on, M-5 was defeated. I think that influences Daystrom's image a lot. Who knows what he went onto do post-The Ultimate Computer."

DaystromInstitute,3a3hm2,willbell,20,Tue Jun 16 22:55:33 2015 UTC,"Let's call this one the ""Potshot"" theory.    Say the Borg want to assimilate the galaxy as efficiently as possible.  They have two broad options when they want to assimilate a given civilization:    Swarm the civilization with a squadron of cubes, or  Send a single cube and hope it does the job.   Option 1 works 100% of the time -- pretty much every galactic power would crumble if several dozen Borg cubes showed up on their doorstep.  On the surface this would seem like the most efficient route; the Borg would never lose.  But what if Option 2 is effective 80% of the time?  It costs the Borg far less (it only requires a commitment of one cube instead of a number of cubes) and allows the collective to expand more quickly.  Even if just two cubes guaranteed success, sending one cube with an 80% success rate is the better choice:   100 cubes could be split into 50 teams of 2 and conquer 50 civilizations, or 100 cubes could be sent out individually and (with an 80% success rate) conquer 80 civilizations in the same amount of time.   The Borg pick Option 2 -- where they get 80 wins for the same investment -- over Option 1 (just 50 wins) every time.    If an individual civilization beats a cube here or there and hangs around, who cares?  The Borg will conquer all of their neighbors soon enough, and from there they can simply wear that civilization down until they succumb (consider that in their first appearance Q tells Picard that the Borg are fine with simply winning via exhausting their target).  The Borg don't care about any individual species.  They take potshots at everyone in order to assimilate many species as quickly as possible.  From our perspective they're half-assing it; from their perspective the cubes lost to the Federation are simply an accepted cost in an otherwise efficient strategy."
DaystromInstitute,3a3hm2,disposable_pants,3,Wed Jun 17 01:54:01 2015 UTC,"Okay...but for the second iteration, they have only 80 cubes left for option 2, which is only 64 wins. By the third iteration, they're just barely breaking even at 51.2 wins. By the fourth, they've lost 50% of their 100-cube fleet for 40 wins."

In the meantime, all those extra worlds can be used to produce more cubes and drones -- after Wave 2, for instance, the Borg have 44 extra worlds to use to produce new resources.

So, let's just say they can create one cube in year per planet, the planet is not usable again to make a ship, and the ship is available the next year  option 1 would go like this  for the totals 100 total ships/50  new planets, 150 ships/ 75 new planets, 225 ship / 112 new planets, 337 total ships/168 new planets, 505 total ships/ 252 new planets, 727 total ships/363 new planets  final total after 6 years is 727 total ships and 1020 total planets  option2  100 total ships(80 surviving) ships/80 new planets, 160 total(128 surviving ships)/128 new planets. 336 total ships(268.8 surviving)/268.8 new planets,  537 total(430 surviving)/430 new planets,860 total ships(680 survive)/680 new planets, 1360 total ships(1088 survived)/1088 new planet  final total after 6 years is 1088 ships and 2674 worlds  which options do you think the borg would take?"

How would you explain the incidences where the do actually swarm their opponents?"
DaystromInstitute,3a3hm2,Vuliev,5,Wed Jun 17 02:47:57 2015 UTC,"You have a point about the Brunali, but our only information about S116 comes from Arturis, who doesn't talk at all about the Borg exploiting them:   ARTURIS: My people managed to elude the Borg for centuries. Outwitting them, always one step ahead. But in recent years, the Borg began to weaken our defences. They were closing in and Species 8472 was our last hope to defeat them. You took that away from us! The outer colonies were the first to fall. Twenty three in a matter of hours. Our sentry vessels tossed aside, no defence against the storm. By the time they'd surrounded our star system, hundreds of Cubes, we had already surrendered to our own terror.   To me, that would seem to lend support to the Potshot Theory.  Unable to mount a comprehensive assault on S116 because of the overwhelming threat of S8472, they simply keep taking potshots at S116.  Even with their forces concentrated elsewhere, the Borg are still able to start corralling S116.  But once S8472 is pushed back to fluidic space, the Borg are able to marshal an assimilation force so large that S116 is unable to evade it, and the Borg utterly crush them.    To me, it seems like Potshots, Farming, and Assimilation make up the foundation for Borg operations.  The Borg are unable to directly innovate or reproduce (or they see doing so as inefficient), but are masters of ""slavery"" and reverse-engineering.  Based on the Borg's approaches to S116 and humanity, I think their thought process might go something like this:   A new species is encountered.  Assimilate the individuals/ships encountered. Analyze species and technology in detail.  If physiology or technology is promising, goto 2. A few Spheres or scouts are dispatched to attempt assimilation of more ships to confirm species is a desirable target for further expenditure of resources.  If confirmed, goto 3.  (Might be that the Borg skip this step entirely.) Take potshot at homeworld or nearest large colony.  If unsuccessful, analyze data from the Cube.  If the species is still a valid target for assimilation (they took out a Cube, they almost definitely are), shoot again.  If unsuccessful again, goto 4. Analyze data from Second cube.  Determine technology rating and compare to tech rating from the first Cube's data.  If  Δtech is high enough, commence Farming.  If Δtech is low but tech rating was high, marshal a large assimilation force and Assimilate.   S116 has incredible value both with their technology (particle synthesis, quantum slipstream) and as drones (extreme mental capacity--good for tactical drones), so it makes sense that the Borg would want to assimilate them rather than farm them.  By contrast, humanity's strength is in its innovation.  Humanity/Starfleet regularly out-adapts the Borg after taking an initial beating (high Δtech), and there's no way the Borg don't recognize that, so they opt to farm us for tech."

Unable to mount a comprehensive assault on S116 because of the overwhelming threat of S8472, they simply keep taking potshots at S116.    I think you're slightly misinterpreting what Arturis said. He said that Species 116 had been outwitting them 'for centuries,' referring to the single 'potshots.'  Since the Borg were focusing on Species 8472, they stopped taking potshots at Species 116. The final harvest just happened to take place shortly thereafter.  See my other comment. This potshot idea suggests to me that the Borg are recovering from a period in which they were using this method to get lots of systems and are no recovering from it with a lower-intensity farming strategy for expansion."

The swarm attack only came after the 8472 problem was resolved.
DaystromInstitute,3a3hm2,Hellstrike,3,Wed Jun 17 22:47:03 2015 UTC,"Maybe they see any settlement of an interstellar species within a certain radius as a danger to them. Not in a direct military attack, but the planet could be used to act as a listing post or an early warning installation.   So therefore a ship drops out of the conduit every couple years (which requires nearly no resources because it was already travelling that way), bombs the colony from the orbit to ensure that all risks to the collective are neutralized, collects any technology of interest and a couple speciesman to add to the distinctiveness of the collective."
DaystromInstitute,3a3hm2,disposable_pants,2,Wed Jun 17 15:20:29 2015 UTC,"It perfectly accounts for those species so long as they're part of the 20% that can fend off a cube's attack.  Under this theory the Borg knows that some percentage of its attacks will fail (20%), yet the strategy still makes sense.  For the two cubes sent to Species 116 and the Brunali that fail, eight cubes sent to others succeed.  The Borg don't care because they'll simply send another when they get around to it knowing that eventually the species that survived will succumb.    From the perspective of either of those species this might look like farming, but it could easily be the Borg's indifference toward them.  Those species simply aren't important enough to warrant a full-scale attack; from the Borg's perspective, no one is."

This is exactly my point, though: they do, in fact, launch 'full-scale' invasions of powers with numerous cubes, far greater than the 'teams of 2' you suggest. Arturis mentions that several hundred cubes were used against his species.  Also, the notion that only 1/5 of civilizations (entire civilizations, not single planets, such as the Borg have attacked in the Federation so far) could withstand attacks by single Borg cubes doesn't hold up, either. The first issue is the presumption that Borg cubes are of generally equal and impressive strength, which many develop based solely on Wolf 359. However Starfleet was actually winning the Battle of Sector 001 with a smaller fleet than at Wolf 359, and Voyager was frequently able to hold it's own against Borg cubes throughout the series (it's also worth noting that the Wolf 359 cube was supported by one or two other cubes). The other issue is that the Federation is significantly larger than just Earth.   HANSON [on monitor]: Your engagements have given us valuable time. We've mobilised a fleet of forty starships at Wolf three five nine, and that's just for starters. The Klingons are sending warships. Hell, we've even thought about opening communications with the Romulans.   While Hanson was naturally referring to the Klingon reinforcements, it's hard to believe that alternate Starfleet preparations were being made at other planets and bases. That lone cube would immediately be pounced on by the rest of Starfleet. Despite being able to quickly adapt and evade enemy weapons, those processes could not last indefinitely. That's why Voyager's chief issue (so far as it had any) was power. That, and the locals.  In other words, the math is just speculation.    All this aside, this theory and the farming theory - while both are sensible, I'd say - depend on different interpretations of the Borg's motives: whether they are trying to expand quickly or attempting to increase the value of their targets in the long term. However, I do feel that this 'potshot' strategy has opened my eyes to something going on with Borg tactics that's a little bit deeper than either one individually.  The latter motive here makes less sense as the current Borg motivation because, as I discuss in this post from about a month ago, the Borg had experienced a 'population explosion' in the late 22nd and early 23rd centuries, much like Starfleet experienced a massive increase in fleet size starting around the 2340s.   One problem with controlling 'thousands' of solar systems, as the Borg have been said to, is that you've got to manage, patrol, and create infrastructure connecting those disparate regions of space. Otherwise, you're liable to run into all sorts of problems, like the Borg Cooperative and other rogue Borg groups.  So, what I'm thinking now is that there's been a fundamental change in the Borg attitude toward expansionism. What they used to be able to do was march single cubes into enemy space and conquer efficiently much as you have described (but definitely not at an 80% success rate). What they're doing now is trying to consolidate their command of all those systems they gained and maintaining their defenses against the numerous enemies they've made.    Some more of my thoughts on why the Borg weren't actively trying to take out Earth with Wolf 359 and Sector 001 may be found here. Basically, the relevance is that the Borg seem to hesitate before assimilating large amounts of people because it could have deleterious effects on the integrity of the whole."
DaystromInstitute,3a3hm2,disposable_pants,3,Wed Jun 17 21:36:59 2015 UTC,"In other words, the math is just speculation.   Absolutely -- the 80/20 numbers (and the example of two-cube teams) just serve to illustrate how the Borg can have an efficient conquest strategy that doesn't hinge on massing ships such that they're guaranteed to win every battle they start.     Arturis mentions that several hundred cubes were used against his species.   I see two possibilities here that would fit squarely with the Potshot Theory:   Borg home space may have expanded to the point where it enveloped the worlds of Species 116.  Think of Species 116 as an American Indian nation and the Borg as the United States.  The U.S. frequently sends armed parties into or through native territory for generations, and some Indians manage to fight them off and maintain their sovereignty... until American settlers move in right next door and decide they're going to push just a little farther west.  Then the U.S. sends in the cavalry and rolls over the Indians.  Basically, Species 116 didn't warrant a full-scale invasion until they were directly underfoot. Species 116 (and other civilizations that report massive Borg invasions) may have been a legitimate threat to the Borg, or at least the Borg may have projected that they would develop into a legitimate threat given enough time.  Maybe the Borg are indifferent to the vast majority of civilizations (and therefore just send periodic ""potshot"" cubes at them) but will make an exception for particularly dangerous species.   I think the farming theory has plenty of merit, but the more I think about this strategy the more it makes sense."

DaystromInstitute,3a3hm2,disposable_pants,2,Thu Jun 18 00:55:43 2015 UTC,"The problem still remains that it's improbable to expect a single vessel to defeat an entire civilization.   There are quite a few civilizations that seem to be primarily limited to one world, and more who would be effectively destroyed if their homeworld was assimilated (their remaining colonies would just be mop-up work).  The Potshot Strategy could defeat most of those, score an occasional lucky victory against more powerful civilizations, and eventually wear down even the strongest multistellar powers (small-scale attacks on the Federation have shown to be a significant drain on resources, for instance).     What do you think of the possibility that their tactics have simply changed as their political situation has changed?   I actually think that's unlikely -- space is big, and the chances they've already seen developments like they've experienced with humans is high.  We're not the toughest people they've come up against, we can't threaten them in any new way, the countermeasures we've deployed against them (or have thought about deploying against them) aren't all that novel.  Whatever assimilation strategy they started with almost certainly included a way to handle civilizations that won't simply roll over.    I see lots of solid reasoning behind some of the ideas that involve the Borg having difficulty assimilating huge numbers of beings all at once, but logically they'd know about that issue from the very start -- at some point they had to assimilate multiple full civilizations centuries before humanity even made First Contact.  If they ran into the problem of mass assimilation long ago they would have developed a solution long ago as well, which means they wouldn't need to (again) alter their strategy in the 24th century."

I don't think this is a problem that can be simply 'adapted' out of. It's not like altering your shield modulation. It's at the inherent nature of the Borg to alter and develop when nrw brains are hooked up to the hive(s), so the problem of making sure the longer-term drones are jostled back into their prior lives. This pretty clearly is what happened with the Wolf 359 drones.   actually think that's unlikely -- space is big, and the chances they've already seen developments like they've experienced with humans is high   Not my point. I didn't mean that the Borg would change from this 'potshot' model to a lower intensity 'farming' model because of the 'distinctiveness' of the recently assimilated species, like the Federation, I meant the sheer number of assimilated star systems and space to control through spotty transwarp would have ballooned drastically in the 23rd century, forcing to Borg to halt major territorial growth and focus on consolidating their power, which puts a great damper on cube availability for swarm attacks. Whether or not they'd noticed the issue (as I think they must have - hence moving humans/Klingons back to the DQ), it'd still exist."

Say we have two scenarios:    A collective of 1 million assimilates an additional 1 million drones.  A collective of 99 million assimilates an additional 1 million drones.   I'd speculate that the potential for disruption in Scenario 1 (where newcomers make up 50% of all drones) is far higher than in Scenario 2 (where newcomers make up just 1% of all drones).  The numbers may have increased over the centuries, but the overall problem -- assimilating a number of minds that is a significant proportion of existing drones -- can't be new."
DaystromInstitute,3a3hm2,Darth_Rasputin32898,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:12:24 2015 UTC,"I... didn't say the problem was new. I said the problem was inherent.  Besides, it's not like the entire sum of the Borg ever collectively carry out one mass assimilation. They send ships to do it, and those ships contain a lot less than millions of people. They carry numbers of drones in the thousands.  That would account for why the new drones in VOY: Unity (80,000+) would abandon the Borg after disconnection. In fact, there is another example of a cube returning to the Delta Quadrant after a massive influx of drones: the Hansens encountered a cube with 129,000 drones aboard... before using a transwarp conduit to go to the Delta Quadrant. This is the highest reported drone complement, followed by none other than the cube from Unity. This suggests to me that the Hansens were unlucky enough to encounter a cube which was sampling the Alpha/Beta Quadrant fauna around the 2350s, somewhat like the Borg ship or ships that took out the Neutral Zone outposts."
DaystromInstitute,3a3hm2,CitizenjaQ,3,Thu Jun 18 16:26:50 2015 UTC,"I like this.  Think of the Borg like a giant, multi-threaded supercomputer. It has tasks with higher priority (slowly expanding controlled territory) that get the bulk of its resources. Smaller tasks  - patrolling borders, assimilating travelers, searching for Omega molecules - get fewer resources. There's always a little bit of slack, so you apply those resources to low-priority tasks.  It might even be that the cubes sent at Earth were older and obsolete. Rather than spend time upgrading them, the Collective just assigned it a task that it very well might fail at, but if it happened to succeed, hey, cool. I mean, sure, you can keep your Windows 98 PC around, but at a certain point, it's less bother to just junk it."
DaystromInstitute,3a3hm2,mgward985,2,Thu Jun 18 14:03:10 2015 UTC,"I like the second part of this - it's a lot like using your older units in Civ to launch an attack against barbarians... It works most of the time, you might get a free tech or a settlement, and when you finally lose the unit, oh well."
DaystromInstitute,3a3hm2,lyraseven,3,Thu Jun 18 15:12:46 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that in assimilating entire civilizations, the Borg can immediately begin incorporating those civilizations' technologies in its newest cubes, so in the paradigm you describe above, high turnover is not necessarily against the interests of the Borg. They likely recycle their oldest cubes into newer ones adapting the technology of recently-assimilated races as a matter of routine; throwing them at civilizations the way you describe is efficient for the reasons you discussed and because it's a way to put a marked-for-recycling Cube to one final use.  Plus the way they'd see it, a Cube which is beaten by its target culture identifies a weakness in their design, and they can scour the technologies and tactics of the neighboring races they've succeeded in assimilating to learn how they deal with whatever that neighbor had that worked so well against a Cube, can adapt it for their needs, and launch the next wave as either multiple Cubes with superior tactics, or a single, upgraded Cube adapted to the new weapons/shields/etc of the target race.  We see an example of this after their first, failed attempt at assimilating the Federation. What did the Federation have that allowed them to resist so effectively? A supreme, borderline Borg-like in its arrogance belief in their own superior morality and system of unity, yet made up of individuals, fiercely protective and proud of their individuality. So how did the Borg adapt to counter that? They assimilated a single individual, but the individual who most exemplifies what the Federation stands for.  They created a symbol: This individual was your culture incarnate, and now he is ours. He was your greatest speaker and defender of your ways yet now he speaks for us, and believes what we believe in. Why do you think you can resist? He'll tell you himself, now: resistance is futile.  The Borg strategy isn't wasteful, it's coldly, brutally efficient. A defeat is just as much an opportunity to adapt and improve as a victory.   Perhaps more so, since true defeats are so much harder to come by."

It makes sense if you know nothing about the target and it could go either way, but this is the Federation - the most powerful and widespread player possibly in the galaxy aside from Borg. You would know in advance if you're going to try to take it you will have to try option 1 because option 2 is much less likely to work in this situation...the two options aren't always equally viable."
DaystromInstitute,3a3hm2,disposable_pants,3,Fri Jun 19 08:21:24 2015 UTC,"The Federation is far from the most powerful or widespread player in the galaxy.  Think of how often Federation ships are completely outclassed by advanced species with godlike powers, or how the Dominion nearly toppled the entire Alpha Quadrant even though they couldn't send reinforcements through the wormhole.  If the Borg is aware of all these highly developed species (and probably hundreds more -- think of how little of the galaxy we've seen so far) what makes the Federation stand out to them?"
DaystromInstitute,3a3hm2,calgil,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:52:26 2015 UTC,"I said 'powerful and widespread' but I think I meant 'powerful widespread'. There are lots of omnipotentish species out there but Federation territory spans a quarter of the galaxy or thereabouts...their strength combined with their huge territory and huge population probably makes them one of the hardest civilisations to conquer with the exception of species the Borg probably wouldn't even attempt like the Q. Even the Dominion have glaring weaknesses that the Borg would easily overcome. But the Feds? You take any planet and you have swathes of hostile planets ready to encircle you and bring you down...the Federation is a mix of lots of different powerful players. One Borg cube would never have been enough to bring down the Federation or survive such an attack. The sheer time it would take is itself ludicrous.  No, the Federation obviously requires a full force. As do probably their close neighbours...doubtful the Federation would stand by while the Klingons, Cardassians or Romulans are absorbed into the Borg."
DaystromInstitute,3a3hm2,BonzoTheBoss,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:39:21 2015 UTC,"Federation territory spans a quarter of the galaxy or thereabouts   Not even close. Picard states that the Federation contains 150 member worlds (probably a few more by now, we see at least one new member in Insurrection) spread across ~8,000 light years. Even assuming he meant 8,000 in width and not in total volume, and assuming that each of those 150+ member worlds have multiple colonies in other star systems, that's still miniscule compared to the total size of the galaxy.  This image, while not canon, offers a fairly representative image of the scale of the Federation. I think in this particular image they've exaggerated the size and scope of Borg territory, as they make it look like the Borg controls the majority of the Delta Quadrant, which doesn't seem right. Even assuming that Voyager only crossed the smallest corner of their space, it still only took them like a 2 weeks to cross it? And then Kes flung them ""10,000 light years, well beyond Borg space."" So Borg space is like 20-30,000 light years across?  This image might be a better example, it still shows how small the Federation and other ""major powers"" are, but gives a more representative view of Borg space.  My point is the Federation may be strong... compared to the civilizations immediately surrounding them, but they are not a ""galactic powerhouse"" dominating ""a quarter of the galaxy"".  Could you elaborate on the ""glaring weaknesses"" the Dominion possess that would make them an easier target? They seemed more than a match for the Federation and their allies, the only reason they lost the war was because they were unable to bring reinforcements through the Wormhole from the Gamma Quadrant and had to rely on local manufacturing and resources from the Cardassians and Breen. And even then the Federation and allies almost lost! When the Dominion tried to bring in reinforcements the Prophets/Wormhole Aliens basically confiscated their fleet! And those 2,500 ships were only the first wave!  Even if the Dominion is on par or slightly smaller than the Federation (I have no evidence, but it always struck me that the Dominion is larger than the Federation) it's obvious their military industrial capacity is far greater than the Federations. Not that that would necessarily save them in the event of a Borg attack, but having thousands of disposable ships you can kamikaze into Borg cubes will at least buy them time. More time than the Federation would have if the Borg decided to launch a whole-sale invasion."
DaystromInstitute,3a3hm2,calgil,0,Fri Jun 26 08:16:39 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I overstated it, but what I meant was that by virtue of being the most powerful and largest single unified power across both Alpha and Beta, it stands that generally those quadrants are under the heavy influence of the Federation...even if the Federation itself doesn't expand that far, through virtue of diplomatic exploration ships like the Enterprise, the Feds' sphere of influence is huge. Sure Ferenginar, Bajor and Q'onos are not Fed worlds, but I doubt any of them would stand by if the Borg attacked Fed space - even if they didn't help military they would no doubt help somehow simply because they KNOW the Federation is better than the Borg and they have a relationship with the Federation. Through that means and applying the same logic to no doubt dozens of other non-Federation powers, the Federation sphere of influence with which it may oppose the Borg expands ever further. And let's not forget that the Federation have forged diplomatic ties with dozens of Delta Quadrant species such as the Ocampans and...others, let's not forget they have liberated Borg drones, and have a working relationship with the Q who the Borg would not want to have to deal with (not saying the Q would step in at all, but they're now factored in, more than they would be if any random Gamma Quad species were attacked). To my mind, even if it's not a constant or even formal 'territory', I think the Federation just clearly wields the most widespread influence and power throughout the galaxy. They've seen shit and have a history of unpredictability too. The Borg would easily look at the federation and essentially say 'ok this power has its fingers in a LOT of holes across the galaxy. They're small themselves but there's way more possible factors here than usual. Overwhelming force recommended.'  As to the Dominion, I know they were hamstrung in the War and perhaps would have won if not for that, but I really do believe that's simply because they were the aggressors, the spies for decades before...they had been militarising, preparing. Give the Federation that same prep time and they'd win nine times out of ten. Why? The Dominion is about absolute order but as a system it hangs on them precariously; their actions are informed by fear instead of principles (fear of solids, fear of no ketracel-white, fear of failure). We don't know what their home systems are like but how many other vassal species are there bullied and scared and coerced into servitude? What other systematic weaknesses (drug addiction!) could be easily exploited by an aggressor. I would guess a fair few. Which is why of course we Feds see them as the villains...they impose order, and I think that leads to unstable order. On top of that, there are a few factors that I really do think are glaring weaknesses:   As said, ketracel-white. It's giving your soldiers an extra thing to 'go wrong' in the field, an extra thing to worry about. An unexpected Borg assault could happen to knock out its production and the Dominion is instantly crippled, unable to rally effectively.  The Changeling homeworld. All the God-king eggs in one basket. If the Great Link is destroyed, the Dominion is over, no matter how big it is. Even if Earth were to fall the Federation could still rally. Even if Changelings resist assimilation, they can still die. Borg aren't stupid. Where assimilation is impossible or comes with great risk, they will adapt and kill. Changelings are very vulnerable to biological warfare. Borg can adapt to this and utilise it. What if Changelings are NOT resistant? A lone morphing Borg drone could lay waste to the entire Dominion...all footsoldiers would weep in reverance as this omniscient Founders guns them down. Changelings seem to have such a poor understanding of solids that they can't work out useful/unuseful relationships with them. The Federation are diplomatic wizards at this point - barter, promise, orate, lie, they can get new allies if needed. The Changelings allied with Cardassia and failed to see the utter instability of Gul Dukat as well as the fact that he wasn't really a speaker for his people. They just don't 'get' solids so they would never get solid help.   Perhaps I'm looking too shallowly at the Dominion as I've read of it, but I genuinely feel the Borg would carve them out very quickly."

There are assertive decision makers like the Queen but maybe even they must deal with the mental inertia of billions acting on instinct.  This could make a situation where individual decisions makers can occasionally influence 'smart tactics' but the rest of the interactions are the mindless reaction/action swarming behavior of an ant collective.
DaystromInstitute,3a3hm2,iansarmy1,3,Wed Jun 17 02:56:32 2015 UTC,"For me it all keeps coming back to the question of why the Borg never launched a larger attack on the Federation with multiple ships? Voyager shows us that they certainly had the means and the desire. Instead they sent one cube at a time and then resorted to a convoluted/nonsensical time travel scheme, while also poking around the edges of Federation space with scout ships.   In ""Dark Frontier"" the queen then twirls her mustache and acts like the Federation is unbeatable by conventional means, and tries to convince Seven to develop a assimilation virus to use on Earth via another needlessly convoluted scheme.

You're talking about a ""species"" with perhaps trillions of individual drones spread out across tens of thousands of light years. Even with collective integration and instantaneous communication, there may well be factions. The Borg command structure could be some sort of ""congress"" where compromises are made between factions with different priorities or theories about how to do things.   And I don't mean ""congress"" in the literal sense of there being some sort of assembly where individual Borg debate with each other. I mean something more like a human mind, where different impulses, needs, desires, fears, etc. all have to be reconciled somehow in order to make decisions. What Freud would have called the ego.  The result is behavior that is often times inexplicable and irrational and prone to self-doubt and vacillation.  Sending one cube to Earth could have been a compromise between a ""faction"" bent on conquering the Federation and another ""faction"" with other priorities. Maybe the single cube even started out as part of an armada but during the course of the journey to earth some other element of the borg ""ego"" gained power and decided to change the collective ""mind"" and redeploy resources somewhere else."

Sometimes, the enemy will mass a huge force, keep it in the base and will send one unit at a time into your base, or will try to expand into mineral patches inside your base. I always assumed that the introduction of Data/Picard caused a change of conditions that disrupted the collective intelligence of the Borg. This of course was disproven by the introduction of the Queen, who is very well aware of her desire to assimilate the Federation.

If you ask me, the Borg behavior towards humanity is explained by two reasons: one, they see that same spark of potential that Q does and they don't want to inadvertantly destroy it and two, they know that powerful entities like the Q, the Traveler, the Organians, the Metrons, the Thasians, Trelane, etc are also interested in humanity and they don't want to get on their wrong side while conquering the Alpha Quadrant (plus figuring out what makes humanity tick might enable the Borg to attract an entity and assimilate it)."

DaystromInstitute,3a3h8s,KingofMadCows,7,Wed Jun 17 00:11:23 2015 UTC,"Except, by the time of ""Sins of the Father"" the house of Mogh is all but extinct. Both Ja'rod and Mogh died on Khitomer, but whereas Duras took over control of his house, Worf was taken into Federation custody and Kurn was presumed dead. From a Klingon point of view, this basically mean that the House of Mogh was extinct. It existed, yes, with Worf as the head, but as a Federation citizen, raised by humans, in Starfleet, he was completely discounted in terms of Klingon politics. It's for these very reasons that they decided to pin the attack on Khitomer on his house!  So, what of the actual resources and allies of the House of Mogh? The allies probably went their own ways and formed or joined other alliances. Most likely, the next most popular and influential houses broke apart the House of Mogh community into their own sub-alliances, similar to what happened to the Greek Empire after the death of Alexander the Great.  As far as the assets of the House of Mogh (tangible things like land and property, as well as cash and other liquid assets), that depends on Klingon law and events we don't know about. Did Worf renounce claims to these assets when he was taken in as a Federation citizenship? Did he voluntarily relinquish rights to these things at some point, realizing he would never fully join Klingon society? Were they seized due to lack of management?  Again, most likely, I think tangible assets would have been claimed by various House of Mogh successors, with no one around to contest them. Liquid and monetary assets would probably have been secured by the government until Worf came of age, then turned back over to him. He probably managed them remotely. Kurn probably seethed at the dismantling of his House's property, but by the time he was old enough to know or do anything about it, it would have been too late.  After Worf accepts discommendation, all that goes away. Anything still in his ownership is probably seized by the government. House of Mogh is now gone in all but name.  Later, when Worf and Kurn back Gowron, and he restores their honor and gives Kurn a place on the High Council, they regain some strength. Kurn has his own allies at this point, and some houses probably return to the fold. Others, if they grew strong enough in their own right, probably maintain leadership over their own alliances, unfortunately becoming rivals or competitors to their old allies. It's unlikely the government would return and previously seized assets, except some nominal property (ancestral land, perhaps).  The House gains in popularity and strength, especially with the decline of Duras, to the degree that they could threaten civil war if Gowron opposes them (as discussed in Rightful Heir). But, alas, once Worf sides against Gowron during the Klingon-Cardassian war, the House of Mogh terminated again. All assets are taken again, along with their titles and honor. Kurn is ""killed."" The House of Mogh exists only as a footnote until Worf joins the House of Martok, ending the House of Mogh forever."

DaystromInstitute,3a3h8s,dannyboylee,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:46:19 2015 UTC,This all makes me wonder if Martok used his substantial political capital to reinstate the House if Mogh after he became head of the Empire?  Or was Worf content to remain part of a noble and respected house?
DaystromInstitute,3a3h8s,CocksonHammerstroke,3,Thu Jun 18 02:33:20 2015 UTC,"Time is counted in hours and days when it comes to the power of rival houses, compound the death of the house's leader and failure of a new leader to step forward with Worf being raised by Starfleet and you have a recipe for a quick decline.  Consider also that Duras may have ascended in the mid-term to greater power, further exasperating the difference in power."
DaystromInstitute,3a3m2o,berlinbrown,8,Tue Jun 16 23:32:50 2015 UTC,"How fast is impulse power compared to warp power?   Full impulse is 1/4 light speed. Warp 1 is light speed for any scale, though the values are different for higher warp in ENT/TOS vs the TNG era."
DaystromInstitute,3a3m2o,Darth_Rasputin32898,3,Tue Jun 16 23:40:53 2015 UTC,"Hang on a moment.  While I'm not one to question a commanding officer, this leads to a major problem- If Full Impulse is .25 C, and Warp 1 is 1C, can a vessel simply not travel at, say, .5 C?  Is it because it's too power-intensive for the speed?    I feel like some sort of abuse of this window could (somehow) be abused as a weapon or extremely useful tactical advantage.  Say a Renegade vessel is being chased by Starfleet at full Impulse (.25C) and they have a vessel that goes slightly faster at .251 C.  It's not much of a distinction, but over a few seconds, you're talking differences of AUs.  If the Starfleet vessel has to go to warp for a small burst, they could (probably would) overshoot this renegade vessel, and the vessel could take advantage of that to get away along a different vector or otherwise gain some leg up.  I always assumed that Full Impulse was just shy of breaking the Light Barrier (maybe .9+ C, depending on the power output of the individual ship's engines)."
DaystromInstitute,3a3m2o,tsoli,7,Wed Jun 17 00:00:10 2015 UTC,".25c is a wholly artificial cap by Starfleet to reduce problems of relativity.  Also, engine efficiency drops like a rock up past .5c.  The Galaxy Class can get past .75c if she uses all her engines (stardrive and saucer).  The Intrepid class can do even better.  In battle or an emergency situation the ship can go faster if the Captain decides it needs to."
DaystromInstitute,3a3m2o,mistakenotmy,3,Wed Jun 17 00:05:41 2015 UTC,"In addition to what /u/mistakenotmy said, ships are capable of warping at sub-light speeds.

DaystromInstitute,3a3m2o,Darth_Rasputin32898,4,Tue Jun 16 23:43:54 2015 UTC,"Impulse. Warp drive is for escaping, presumably because you can't maneuver closely enough at FTL to aim weapons effectively."
DaystromInstitute,3a3m2o,dxdydxdy,3,Tue Jun 16 23:47:56 2015 UTC,"That's what Memory Alpha has to say on Voyagers Speed:    The 'Star Trek Voyager Technical Manual' page 13 has full impulse listed as ¼ of the speed of light which is 167,000,000 mph or 74,770 km/s. ¼ impulse for Voyager would be 18,665 km/s. Voyager's ¼ impulse is 10 times faster than the shuttle's. Therefore, the term ""¼ impulse"" isn't a fixed speed as much as it's ¼ of the full speed of the impulse engines' maximum."
DaystromInstitute,3a3m2o,dxdydxdy,3,Tue Jun 16 23:48:43 2015 UTC,"Are there degrees of impulse power  There are varying degrees of impulse power, because you can move at different speeds. Half-impulse and anything else are just references relative to what is the speed that has been declared to be 100% impulse. It seems like the logical candidate here would be the nominal top-speed the ship is rated for.  Avoiding obstacles in warp  The show states that one can't move in any way other than a straight line in Warp. Consequently, to change direction, one would have to drop out of warp, rotate and get back into it. That being said, the important part here are better computers and sensors. The sensors have an impressive range, and work FTL, as do the computers. Those can additionally calculate the positions of any major obstacles (like planets, ...) in advance, thanks to the precise maps the sensors provide. Smaller obstacles are handled by the deflector shield.  Movement and Combat  What we can be sure of is that the rate at which a ship is able to rotate, and its acceleration is finite. That means, that there are certainly going to be differences in the maneuverability of two opposing ships. The thing is, what are you trying to achieve by moving something as large as the Enterprise against smaller fighters? You're not going to be able to outmaneuver attacking fighters, so you'd rather use the energy you saved for shields. Thanks to the EPS system it's possible to do that. Since we see the ""big""-ship for most of the time the fight looks very static."
DaystromInstitute,3a3m2o,mistakenotmy,5,Tue Jun 16 23:41:23 2015 UTC,"The show states that one can't move in any way other than a straight line in Warp.   I think the quote from Tom Paris is ""When faster than light, no left or right.""  It seems strange to me that absolutely strait and no maneuvering is how warp works.  One reason for 2 nacelles was the ability to change the field to allow limited helm control.  I think ""left or right"" may be more in line with drastic helm changes.  A ship at warp can't change course 90 degrees ""on a dime"" so to speak (or even 30 degrees).  However, detecting an object a few light years away in the ships path and changing course 5 degrees slowly over a few minutes seems reasonable.  Then once past the object, returning to the original course."

JANEWAY: Tom, what's the first thing they teach you about manoeuvring at warp?  PARIS: Faster than light, no left or right. When possible, maintain a linear trajectory. Course corrections could fracture the hull.  JANEWAY: Exactly. We'd have to drop to impulse every time we made a course change but, what if we let Voyager do the driving?  PARIS: Ma'am?  - from Fury (VOY).We're in ""Briefing room - 2371"".   I'm not sure, I mean, I can see your point, but why would they have to do all of that insane jumping in the episode if they could just make more or less minute course changes."
DaystromInstitute,3a3m2o,uptotwentycharacters,4,Wed Jun 17 00:03:40 2015 UTC,"The ""no turning at warp"" seems to be something mainly referenced just in that episode, and not really supported elsewhere. I'm pretty sure in TOS: ""The Ultimate Computer"" starships perform combat maneuvers at warp 3 or 4, and in ""Elaan of Troyius"" Captain Kirk specifically orders a turn at warp 2. Given that these involve low warp factors, it's most likely that turning at warp is only a real issue at high warp. ""Faster than light, no left or right"" may be a general guideline rather than a technical limitation. ""When possible, maintain a linear trajectory"" does seem to imply that sometimes it is not possible and a ship must turn at warp."
DaystromInstitute,3a3m2o,mistakenotmy,3,Wed Jun 17 06:51:09 2015 UTC,"I forget the specifics but do they need more drastic course changes than a few degrees here or there?  It just seems like an artificial constraint that was thought up for that episode and never seen again.  I totally see being slow and careful with course changes in warp, but absolutely no changes seems a bridge to far, at least to me."
DaystromInstitute,3a3m2o,mistakenotmy,3,Wed Jun 17 00:10:33 2015 UTC,"To take your questions slightly backwards, the way battle is portrayed is part writing and part VFX team.  Some of it is because of limitations of the technology of the time.  We see different examples of fighting even in the same series.  The Enterprise 1701-D will at time fire slowly (Rascals) or very fast (Survivors or BoBW).    Impulse is sublight travel and can be measured in percentage of c.  ""Full Impulse"" is defined by Starfleet as .25c or 1/4 light speed.  Many ships can go faster than this, .75c or even .9c with impulse engines but the time dilation effects due to relativity make that ill advised (not to mention the engines are less efficient at those speeds).  In combat ships can go as fast as needed at the captains discretion. I would assume Starfleet ships have better engines than freighters and have a higher top speed if needed.  Warp is a real space FTL system.  It bends space around the ship creating a pocket of space.  That pocket can then go FTL without violating relativity.  The ship does need to maneuver around large objects.  Space dust and microscopic particles are pushed aside with the main Navigational Deflector."
DaystromInstitute,3a3m2o,MageTank,5,Tue Jun 16 23:49:43 2015 UTC,"Good point on your first paragraph.   This was the 80s-90s though, air combat in film had certainly been done.   BSG seems to use the most realistic (seeming) space combat where you protect your base ship and then send out fighters.    Star Wars had some of those scenarios as well.  The rebels seemed to rely on fighters as opposed to larger ships.  But I can see where a Enterprise size vs another Enterprise ship would rely on less maneuverability and more on larger more serious firepower."
DaystromInstitute,3a3m2o,mistakenotmy,3,Wed Jun 17 00:27:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you have to remember that large objects still have mass, even in space, so it requires a great amount of energy to move effectively, not to mention the ship has to be extremely structurally secure to avoid shearing forces from maneuvering quickly. The Enterprise-D is the better part of a kilometer long, its not going to be flipping around like a gymnast. Even the Defiant at 120 meters is still pretty big."
DaystromInstitute,3a3m2o,JBPBRC,3,Wed Jun 17 00:41:42 2015 UTC,"This was the 80s-90s though, air combat in film had certainly been done   True but model work and tracking shots were very expensive.  So keeping those to a minimum is a serious budget saving measure for a TV show.  Babylon 5 was one of the first to use CGI on TV and it served them very well.  However, the look suffered because of the limitations of early CGI.  Fighters I think is an interesting debate.  I think it really depends on the universe the show is set in.  In real life carriers and fighters make sense because the fighters add a whole new dimension to the battle.  In space a fighter can be seen as ""just a small ship"" as it doesn't bring a whole new medium into play like an aircraft does. In some universes the increased maneuverability, speed, or numbers make the fighter dangerous.  In Trek there seems to be a lower limit on the effectiveness of a ship.  A ship that is to small may be more maneuverable but isn't powerful enough to damage or be effective against a larger ship.  Small warships seem to be the break point.  With things like the Defiant, Jem Bug, or Klingon BoP being small(er) and still combat effective."
DaystromInstitute,3a3m2o,CaptainJeff,3,Wed Jun 17 00:43:55 2015 UTC,"Also, It seems that a space vessel could move at high rate of speed and still fire?   They absolutely can. In Balance of Terror the Enterprise is in full retreat from the Romulan plasma weapon and are at ""emergency warp"". They don't say how fast that is but I presume maximum possible speed plus a small Scotty boost.  At any rate, Sulu, Kirk and others are discussing detonating the plasma weapon with a phaser blast before it can hit the Enterprise, and would've, if not for the phasers being offline from battle.  In The Motion Picture the Enterprise also fires a photon torpedo to destroy an asteroid while in that weird wormhole/warp anomaly thing.  Same thing again in Q Who with the Enterprise-D in full retreat mode at maximum warp while lobbing photon torpedoes at the Borg Cube, and Into Darkness with the Vengeance attacking the Enterprise while at warp."
DaystromInstitute,3a3m2o,Hellstrike,2,Wed Jun 17 00:50:52 2015 UTC,"Also, it seems that military combat in Star Trek is modeled after naval conflict as opposed to earth air combat.    Correct. Specifically, submarines as opposed to surface navy. The issue is that with Earth air combat, the aircraft need to keep moving at a high rate of speed in order to stay in the air (let's leave helicopters and related things out of the picture). So, you can't really have air combat with stationary vessels. Space, however, does not have that limitation. Indeed, it's much more like submaries in that there is 360 degrees of freedom of movement, and no requirement to keep moving while engaged in combat."
DaystromInstitute,3a3m2o,CaptainJeff,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:30:03 2015 UTC,"Modern air combat looks very different.

DaystromInstitute,3a1jll,adamkotsko,12,Tue Jun 16 14:37:29 2015 UTC,"I feel like this idea humanizes the Borg a little too much.  One of the Borg's greatest strengths are their totally, genuinely unphasable they are. Everything about our culture—the borders we outline our societies by, the rules of engagement and proper combat—are completely irrelevant to the Borg.  When we first meet them, their first act is to invade the Enterprise. They do it instantly, with no preface or malice. To them, it's nothing. It's routine. It doesn't even acknowledge the presence of the crew.  That was a huge first impression, and it created a foe like nothing faced in Trek before. These weren't Klingons. These weren't Romulans. This wasn't some enemy of the Federation, this wasn't a government or an army.   This was a force. They weren't frightening by design or intent, they simply were frightening. And that's all the more terrifying.  Because time after time there are implications that they aren't trying to incite panic or fear. When they say that resistance is futile and that you will adapt to service them, they're simply informing you. How you react to that statement is meaningless, it's simply what will happen.  Locutus is a perfect example of this. Locutus is a horrifying puppet that could only revulse the Federation further against the Borg, but that didn't seem to be the Borg's intent in its creation.  And that leads me to another great thing about the Borg, their complete incompatibility.   Unlike every major foe fought in Trek, the Borg don't think like humans. The way they operate is strange and completely alien. It divorces itself from anything recognizable and buries deep into this strange uniform hivemind.   That's terrifying. In Trek, negotiation and peace have always been the greatest weapons for the side of good, but in this instance it's not Klingon stubbornness or Romulan distrust that's stopping discussions for peace. It's the simple fact that negotiation isn't an option. It's not that they don't want to, it's that they can't.  So, I suppose my point is, I don't think that making the Borg terrorize makes them too much like us. They're not us. They're worse, they are actually terrifying."
DaystromInstitute,3a1jll,jimmysilverrims,8,Tue Jun 16 15:13:19 2015 UTC,"When they say that resistance is futile and that you will adapt to service them, they're simply informing you.    I do get that sense sometimes. From a certain perspective, it comes across as weirdly good-natured: ""Just a heads up... Resistence is futile.""  More generally, I think this is a strong objection but it risks rendering the Borg simply incomprehensible -- which seems to me to go against the spirit of Star Trek, as well as creating too easy an out for explaining away any apparent contradiction or confusing action by the Borg: ""Their ways are not our ways...."""
DaystromInstitute,3a1jll,DS_Unltd,4,Tue Jun 16 15:18:53 2015 UTC,"I think the ""Resistance is futile"" idea is a double-edged sword. On one side, it's simply a statement. ""I will break you and bend you to my will. It will happen and there is nothing you can do about it."" On the other side, it does have a distinct psychological element to it. ""I'm just going to let that sit with you for a bit, let it sink in. I'm not going to break you now, but I will break you, and you will know it."""
DaystromInstitute,3a1jll,disposable_pants,7,Tue Jun 16 16:18:00 2015 UTC,"There's no doubt that the Borg themselves deeply believe that it's an objective fact. (Think of how much it rocked Hugh's world when Beverly informed him that resistence was not futile.) But I think my theory accounts for that, because every currently living Borg would be someone subjected to exactly the psychological terrorism I describe. They don't have to be conscious of the fact that it's a psychological tactic anymore -- it runs on autopilot."

Why bother informing someone of what will happen if their reaction is meaningless?  If I'm going to take apart a car to see what's inside, do I talk to it first?  If communicating with a species to be assimilated provided no benefit to the Borg they wouldn't do it.  They're pursuing perfection, and one component of perfection is dispensing with that which is unnecessary.  Therefore there must be a reason behind ""Resistance is futile"" and any other communication the Borg elect to participate in."
DaystromInstitute,3a1jll,Algernon_Asimov,7,Tue Jun 16 18:22:09 2015 UTC,"I like to think it's vestigal.   That's one of the great things about the Cybermen (creatures from Doctor Who whom the Borg clearly take inspiration from). They're men, actual humans from a world identical to our own. A planet just like Earth, but with its back pressed up against the threat of an icy extinction.  So the people of this second Earth did what they needed to keep humanity alive. They kept changing themselves and changing themselves, excising what made them weak in a desperate attempt to hang onto life.  But in doing so, nothing that made them truly alive remained. They continue their march to convert, unaware of their original purpose or how horribly they've peverted it.   Before the Borg ever had, the Cybermen would announce ""Resistence is futile"" not to warn, but to simply inform. It's not speech to them, it's the cursory animation of a dissected tongue. It's a twisted remnant of the humans they've converted. To them, it's not an elected action, it's just SOP.   And that's what I see in the Borg. Mindless, unstopping singlemindedness that has long abandoned any sense of reason. Why do the Borg speak to their prey? Because it's SOP. It's part of the cycle that the Borg will continue until all are one. They do it because that is how it's done. They will not act in reason. They will not deviate.   They are the Borg. You will be assimilated."

I don't think we can credit the sole, or even primary, inspiration for the Borg to 'Doctor Who' when there are so many other examples of cyborgs to draw from. I think that, visually, the Borg are more likely to have drawn inspiration from 'Robocop' (here and here), which came out only 2 years before the Borg were first seen."
DaystromInstitute,3a1jll,Meat_Confetti,2,Tue Jun 16 22:10:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think the Cybermen are the sole inspiration, or even the primary inspiration, for the Borg. Visually, they're extremely different creatures and you're right in pointing out the decidedly Cronenbergian style the Borg are undoubtedly meant to capture.  However, I don't think it takes much to argue a strong connection between these two characters. Star Trek has dipped into the Doctor Who pot plenty of times throughout its run (sometimes to the point of extremely transparent emulation), and take elements from Cybermen verbatim—most famously their iconic phrase ""Resistence is Futile"".  The connection between the Borg and the Cybermen goes deeper than just the parts they're made of. Both tap into the same fears of the uniform overwhelming the individual. Both emphasize the sameness in thought and purpose of the species and the alien ""hivemind"" they possess.  The Borg are certainly a unique amalgam of tropes and archetypes, but there's a very distinctive whiff of the Cybermen about them. I think it's extremely safe to say they were, at least in part, an inspiration for the Borg."
DaystromInstitute,3a1jll,jimmysilverrims,3,Tue Jun 16 22:24:25 2015 UTC,"I think what's most scary about the Borg is how tangible their ethos actually is to us the viewers.  They may be alien to the Federation, but they feel pretty familiar to us.  They're an allegory for the Corporate State.  They have a simple business model, which is to extract resources from their environment and build capacity so they can extract yet more resources. They seek to impose their order on the galaxy, replacing diversity with homogeneity.  They value efficiency, and seek to acquire everything they can.  Individuals are irrelevant, so long as the brand lives on.  Sounds like every multinational corporation there is, to me.  And with that in mind, the design of their ships is no mystery: they're meant to look like industrialized office buildings."

The Borg don't represent something as specific or limiting as ""the Corporate State"". They are a representation of something much greater, something much more universally feared and felt.  The Borg are conformity. The Borg are the antithesis of individuality. They are overwhelming in numbers. They are overwhelming in power. They are many, you are one.   That is what the Borg represent. More than any sort of consumer/corporation narrative. More than any specific allegory. They represent that primal fear every person has, that fear of losing oneself to an innumerable uniform mass that seeks to eradicate them."

DaystromInstitute,3a1jll,shyataroo,3,Tue Jun 16 18:42:21 2015 UTC,"I agree that the Borg - on a fairly basic level, I think - are engaging in a form of psychological warfare, as you suggest, but not exactly in the sense that they are making 'an attempt to make the vast majority of the target population really believe that resistance is futile,' with the objective of making the newly assimilated drones more docile. I, like /u/jimmysilverrims, think the mostly-homogenous hails are more to do with the idea that the Borg are following SOPs, or standardized operating procedures. The psychological warfare of the Borg, as I see it, doesn't have anything to do with acquiring drones, it is more to do with prompting and acquiring technological developments.  Like I discuss in the PotW comment thread, the primary purpose of the attacks on Earth were to prompt enough concern and fear among Federation citizens to prod them into generating new defensive technologies and tactics for the Borg to assimilate at an unspecified future point. In a follow-up comment, I discussed how I think the 'Borg scoop' relates to the farming tactics. Basically, the point was to possess a manageable amount of new drones and further impress the Alpha Quadrant powers with their capabilities - since they used this method against the New Providence and Ivor Prime colonies before each battle. However, the Borg did not plan to maintain control of Earth, because:   In VOY: Unity, a colony of ex-drones - 80,000 total - who are primarily from the Alpha and Beta Quadrants are discovered. It turns out that they were all assimilated around the time of Wolf 359. It seems that Wolf 359 was actually the work of at least two (or three) Borg cubes, one of which carried out the final attack on Earth and was defeated by the Enterprise, and one which had the job of collecting, carrying back, and assimilating all the drones that the group acquired for safe, uninterrupted integration.  Recall, there were still drones on board the Nekrit Expanse cube. The Cooperative was still concerned about the possibility that they'd reactivate and link up with the other Borg in the Delta Quadrant. I think that the escaped drones were the ones who were only partially assimilated at that time.  In any case, the mere fact that the Borg would bother carting back literal shiploads of people shows that mass assimilation is not a pleasant or lightly undertaken operation. The turmoil of additional drones' thoughts and memories needs to be soothed, and fending off Klingon BOPs is not a good way to do that.   Additionally, the Borgs' tendency to mount surgical strikes via transwarp exposes another facet of their strategy: they do not engage in conventional wars. Leaving bases in the Alpha Quadrant on former Federation and Klingon planets would only invite open warfare that would force the Borg to destroy more of the Federation than would be conducive to the atmosphere of frenzied technological development they want to create. I address this in a different comment:   Via the farming theory as it stands thus far, the purpose of the attacks was solely to prompt the Federation to develop technologically. Whether or not Earth is actually captured is irrelevant to this goal.  If the Borg succeeded, then the Federation would be positively terrified, serving the Borg's purposes fine. If the Borg failed (and they did) then the Federation would still be terrified at the thought of an enemy encountered formally only about a year before stomping through their territory and disabling an entire fleet singlehandedly.  If the Borg had captured Earth, they would not have held it - the would have grabbed as many people as possible and ran away. A Borg installation in the Alpha Quadrant would only incite direct conflict with those powers, not the stable, paranoid R&D period the Borg actually want to induce.   So the Borg don't really employ psychological tactics against individuals - they employ psychological tactics against societies.  A good deal of this hesitant attitude toward en-masse drone assimilation probably has to do with the nature of the Borg hive mind itself. As massive as the Borg are, the threat of Hugh-like factions splintering of when dangerous ideas and thoughts are assimilated becomes significant. In my response to the post you linked on the Borg Queen, I theorize that the purpose of the Queen's 'bringing order to chaos' really deals with the idea that mass assimilations are difficult, and, as you said, dangerous because of the vast number of unhappy conscripts suddenly disrupting the preexisting drones' harmony.  Factions like the Borg Cooperative from VOY: Unity show this quite explicitly. After the large-scale battle (by Starfleet standards) of Wolf 359, a total of around 80,000 fresh drones are moved to the Delta Quadrant in a Borg cube. Shortly after arriving in the Delta Quadrant, a natural disaster severs their link to the Borg and the new drones - who we can guess were in a partially assimilated state - immediately move to a new planet, leaving the dead drones where they are. However, those drones nearly reactivate and relink with the rest of the Borg. What I think is interesting to note here is that those 'dead' drones seem to be fully assimilated as opposed to those who fled to the planet, indicating that there is an initial period where Borg drones need to acclimate to the conditions of the hive, and that disruption (be it an electrokinetic storm or Klingon Birds-of-Prey) can result in undesirable rogue Borg elements."
DaystromInstitute,3a1jll,berlinbrown,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:37:14 2015 UTC,"I think that for your theory, the crushing of creative thinking and innovation is solved by the very process of psychological warfare. The Borg send in advance attacks, causing the races attacked to begin technological development to counter the threat. The Borg then Assimilate the new technology.  The Borg psychological conditioning not only keeps individuals from disturbing the Collective consciousness, but it also spurns the development of new tech and ideas for them to harvest. They don't need creative thinking  or ingenuity. If they have a problem they can't solve, they simply farm up a solution.  tl;dr Borg are Reapers on a smaller scale."
DaystromInstitute,3a3ml7,grapp,6,Tue Jun 16 23:37:28 2015 UTC,"A lot of non-Federation peoples in Star Trek seem oddly content to not explore the nature of their immediate world.   In the DS9 episode, ""Shadowplay"", a group of holographic villagers (unaware they are holograms) have no interest in exploring beyond the borders of their valley to look for missing (offline) villagers. The idea seems beyond them.   I get that the idea from the writing perspective was that the valley was their entire universe. It would be like an alien asking 20th century humans if we looked for Amelia Earheart in the Andromeda galaxy, but these holograms clearly have a concept of distance and space and the valley edge is like 15 minutes away. No one ever went any farther than that?  A lot of civilizations in Star Trek have very little inertia or seem extremely static. They exist for the show and then effectively cease to exist outside of that episode. The few exceptions being the Dominion, Romulans and Klingons."
DaystromInstitute,3a3ml7,exNihlio,5,Wed Jun 17 03:39:40 2015 UTC,well the holograms were programmed not to want to go outside the valley
DaystromInstitute,3a3ml7,eXa12,2,Wed Jun 17 10:00:00 2015 UTC,"At least, once they were taken to the edge of the valley and shown they weren't ""real"", they worked out that whoever programmed them probably made it so they'd never explore too far."

DaystromInstitute,3a23ii,Darth_Rasputin32898,5,Thu Jun 18 15:11:08 2015 UTC,"Well, to answer this question, you've got to look at as much of Borg history as possible. In the past, I've written a couple posts on this subject, one on ancient Borg history and another on recent, human-relevant history. So, I think I might just compile a timeline of sorts.   ~1400: The Vaadwaur never encounter the Borg. In fact, the Vaadwaur may never fall, if we assume that the Borg were one of their enemies in the war that defeated them. The Borg had emerged as a regional space power akin to the Breen by the 21st century, implementing the transwarp network at a similar time. By the 23rd century they were in their period of most aggressive growth, and they were obviously extremely powerful by the 24th century. Their absence would definitely impact interstellar politics for the better over this period of time. 23rd century: They'd never end up taking out the El-Aurians. 24th century: The lack of Wolf 359 and Sector 001 attacks might actually make the Federation less prepared for the Dominion war, as many of the newer ships deployed against the Jem'Hadar were first shown in combat against the Borg at Sector 001 (the Akiras, Steamrunners, Sabers, etc)."
DaystromInstitute,3a23ii,disposable_pants,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:08:37 2015 UTC,"I think your Vaadwaur point is interesting. But the Vaadwaur claim that the Borg were just a nuisance to them in the 13th century. I know the Vaadwaur were pretty dishonest but why lie about this? Also what do you ""mean akin to the Breen""? also my initial post addressed both the El-Aurians and the Starfleet not upgrading. Sorry if that sounded accusative."
DaystromInstitute,3a23ii,adamkotsko,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:35:45 2015 UTC,"My 'akin to the Breen' I meant that the Borg occupied a similar political/military role as the Breen did in the Dominion War: a relatively small and secretive power that still has enough unique advantages to dramatically alter the course of major wars with the help of a powerful ally (like the Breen significantly altered the balance of power near the end of the Dominion War).  And, the actual Vaadwaur point is that the Borg had 'only assimilated a handful of systems,' which does imply they were relatively weak, but not that they couldn't pose a threat.  Finally, I think it's a pretty common observation that the Borg contributed to Federation advances (in fact it's the main theory on why the Borg only used one ship at a time)."
DaystromInstitute,3a23ii,Darth_Rasputin32898,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:49:04 2015 UTC,Yes your right it something that has been said before. But the point is that I made that observation at the start of my post and you simply reiterated it regardless of whether this argument has been seen in other posts. I'm sorry if that came across confrontational.
DaystromInstitute,3a23ii,volkmasterblood,3,Tue Jun 16 20:39:54 2015 UTC,"Sisko would discover the Bajoran wormhole regardless of the Borg existing or not -- the Prophets had an active role in his conception, so it's fair to say they had his role in their little drama planned out from the start.    I also disagree with the point many are making -- that the Federation's technology would stagnate without exposure to the Borg and that this would put them at a significant disadvantage in the inevitable war with the Dominion.     The war with Cardassia would still have happened so the Federation would not jump straight from peacetime into conflict with the Dominion. The Dominion was deliberately cautious before advancing into the Alpha Quadrant -- it's mentioned multiple times that they think longer-term than most other major galactic powers.  The Borg not existing wouldn't push the Founders to invade the Alpha Quadrant more quickly, so the Federation would still have a year or two (at least) between first contact with them and open war. Even with this relatively small amount of time for preparation, the Federation has consistently shown huge potential for rapid innovation.  If they were caught flat-footed they wouldn't stay that way for long.  The Federation either already possesses or can almost instantaneously develop extremely effective wartime technology that -- for the most part -- they simply elect not to use.  Cloaking technology is the most prominent example, but also consider how Section 31 develops a genocidal virus to eliminate the Founders over three years before the end of the Dominion War.   The Federation is an obvious analogue for the United States, and like the United States it doesn't matter if it's caught with its pants down -- in a protracted war it's going to beat almost anyone."

DaystromInstitute,3a23ii,RyanATX,4,Tue Jun 16 18:03:34 2015 UTC,"I believe that it would.  The Borg's presence at that time was not the catalyst for it occurring.  Cochran was going to go up in that ship either way.  Their presence, as well as the presence of the Enterprise crew, did alter how it played out however."
DaystromInstitute,3a23ii,RyanATX,4,Tue Jun 16 18:10:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, except the Enterprise-E crew would not be there.  The only events associated with First Contact that the Borg really caused were the strange shots fired at Bozeman, the Enterprise-E crew appearing, having to fix the ship, Riker and Geordi copiloting, and the presence of a fragmented Borg sphere in the Arctic. Oh yeah, and ENT's Regeneration."
DaystromInstitute,3a23ii,Roderick111,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:27:43 2015 UTC,"With the Delta Quadrant being a lot bigger, and having more powerful Empires, there might have been options for earlier alliances as well.  Q would not have brought Picard to the Delta Quadrant for the Borg.  There would have been no reason for Starfleet to look in the direction of the Delta Quadrant, except for the perfectly viable option that their might be closer species as well.  Maybe the Hirogen are closer and mightier than expected (a natural push outwards as other Empires or Federations get bigger as well).  The Gamma Quadrant would remain the same.  The wormhole being discovered later would mean nothing for Voyager though, since they were chasing the Maquis and not anything involving the Dominion.  So Voyager going through the Delta Quadrant would have been much different, and probably slightly easier on many levels, however the trip would have definitely been longer since the Borg would have provided the way back.  On the note of Starfleet being less prepared, I think at first yes.  However, the Defiant's cloaking tech was from the Romulans, and from what I remember was not Borg influenced.  Funny thing I just thought of: since the El-Aurians were not refugees, and they were not escaping the Borg, would the Enterprise B have intercepted a distress call that swept up Kirk eventually?  If no, then Kirk would live a long and potentially happier life, maybe even meeting Picard at one point not at death.  In the episode ""Parallels"" alternate universe Enterprise would not have destroyed the other alternate universe Enterprise escaping from the Borg."

After all, the Bajoran wormhole was closed for a significant amount of time before it was found in DS9. Voyager might have shown up and the wormhole could have been nowhere to be found, making them start all over again. Also, the Bajoran end of the wormhole was close to Cardassian space, and the Cardassians have a tendency to 'annex' other systems. They could have shown about at DS9 Terok Nor and been captured for their Delta/Gamma Quadrant intel and technology."

It'd be like if I got stranded in the city and it was a 2 hour walk to my home vs a 1 hour walk to the nearest metro which was also 2 hours away from my home, but closed in an hour.

Considering that in the beginning of the series nobody really told the Doctor much of anything because of their attitudes toward him, Capt. Janeway could've simply made the decision not wanting to risk confrontation with the Dominion and not notified him. The Doctor was so neglected by his crew mates that they didn't bother to tell him Nelix and Kes had joined the crew, this was actually a breach of protocol as the C.M.O. is supposed to be notified of new passengers/crew so proper medical information can be obtained. The Doctor wasn't considered a person for a rather long time, people treated him like a hypospray, a tool to to be used. As late as season 5 Janeway was willing to violate the Doctor by removing memories) without his consent or knowledge, she even refered to him as being similar to a replicator. I have no doubt that she would've made a course decision and simply not bothered to tell him.  And as time went on with no contact with Starfleet, and the crew's attention attention focused on going home and their daily lives, it's possible that the Dominion just wasn't a conversation piece in general, let alone with the Doctor.  edit: couldn't get last link to work"
DaystromInstitute,3a2di7,dishpandan,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:25:00 2015 UTC,You could be right. but still the war had not started so although they made have been reluctant to go though the space of species that was possibly hostile it still may have made more sense then going though Borg space.

Go to the Gamma Quadrant (and still risk passing through Borg Space) and hope that the Dominion don't destroy you and that the Wormhole is still open for business, or simply fly straight to Earth and not risk a Dominion encounter along with the risk of a Borg encounter. And I do believe that it is safe to say the Dominion were hostile. They had already destroyed a Galaxy Class ship simply to prove their dedication to victory.

With that in mind, since both take the same amount of time, the Wormhole was the riskier move considering the volitile nature of the Dominion and the DS9 region in general. Had they made their way to the Wormhole and after 70 years found it was now collapsed, now in Dominion control or Cardasian control they would have potentially had another 70 year journey to go to the Alpha Quadrant.  By heading directly for home they could assume that they would at least make contact with Starfleet sooner even if they were still a ways out. They also knew a little bit more about what to expect on the far reaches of the Alpha Quadrant due to previous deep space missions. They dont save time per se but they take slightly less risk."

DaystromInstitute,3a0xcv,geogorn,5,Tue Jun 16 10:47:47 2015 UTC,"Two problems I see. First, even if the Borg would assimilate everything, would that mean that they have reached perfection? Maybe they still didn't find a way to stabilize Omega or have other unfinished business.  And second, if you really want to mess around with temporal anomalies, why not simply build that temporal weapon from Voyager Year of Hell and purge the Borg from the universe?  If you are willing to discard the prime directive and several directives about temporal interference than total annihilation would seem more logical than sending an enemy, whose agenda is total control, a weapon from the future where he already archived total victory."
DaystromInstitute,3a0xcv,Hellstrike,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:16:46 2015 UTC,As I said its based on whether you accept that the Borg can achieve perfection or not. Also the take in this article is that any direct attempt to defeat or destroy the Borg by any method is doomed to fail. they will always adapt and eventually assimilate you. Though your right about the temporal prime directive and also the regular prime directive as you would be messing with the timeline and with the development of a species. I suppose this could also be covered in the Federation initially rejecting the idea. Although I also suppose that this final effort to change the Timeline may be adopted by some other species that is the last to be assimilated by the Borg who may not be a federation member. furthermore it creates a separate timeline it cant change the existing one.
DaystromInstitute,3a0xcv,Hellstrike,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:26:03 2015 UTC,Also we know that the Federation's attitude to time travel is far less strict even within a few centuries of the 24th.

I'm sure as you say that could try to build something similar unknowingly or just attempt to erase the Borg from history in a million other ways. But personally due to the fact that the Borg in there own attempt to do this to the federation in first contact failed makes me thinks that these attempts rarely work least of all against the Borg.

The borg during the time of their beginning are likely a lot less dangerous, and these 10,000 years could be used to create anti-borg weaponry of absolutely unimaginable power (Endgame's future Janeway brought back tech ""only"" 30-ish years more advanced). These weapons would not be able to stop the borg native to that timeline, but I can't see how the borg of the past would stand against them.  Nothing can adapt if you wipe it out fast and completely."
DaystromInstitute,3a0xcv,thesynod,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:34:20 2015 UTC,Well my method does prevent genocide. I think creating a timeline where both the Federation plus everyone else can co exist with the Borg would be the most Star Trek like option. Also Picard already rejected the genocide option.
DaystromInstitute,3a0xcv,Darth_Rasputin32898,2,Tue Jun 16 17:39:21 2015 UTC,"Also Picard already rejected the genocide option.    And for that Picard was reprimanded by the high-command and ordered to immediately act on any future opportunities to wipe out the borg. High-command is a lot less idealistic than our favorite french captain.  There are probably other ways to prevent genocide, though. You could stop the borg from every coming into existence by preventing whatever created them. Maybe you could even just reprogram them to pacify them. They are machines, after all. Or rip out their home planet/home system and transport it somewhere into deep space. If the borg truly only learn through assimilation, they'll not be able to ever leave their world because they'd not be able to develop technology to do so.  Your plan also comes with a lot of dangers:   What if the borg did not achieve perfection by assimilating every species in the galaxy? By executing that plan, you would make the borg so powerful that no species could stand up to them in the past and you'd probably not get a second shot at it. (To be clear: I mean that perfection is achievable by the borg, but that the Vulcans were simply wrong in assuming that total assimilation would be sufficient to reach it.) What if, in their own logic, the borg decide that their newly-found perfection must be used to bring all other sentient life to perfection as well? The borg would continue to assimilate, not to gain knowledge but to unify every species. What if you've made a mistake in your calculations and send the borg ship to the wrong time? What if the borg find and destroy the timetravel device before it can be activated? What if the borg have safeguarded their ships against temporal distortions (maybe to prevent it being used as a weapon against them)?   PS: I have a hard time grasping how exactly genocide is bad when timetravel is involved. If you let the borg do their work, you condemn every race in this galaxy to perish. Is that worse than destroying the borg in the past because there would be a trillion times as many victims? Would it be less bad because that particular timeline is erased and only the borg would effectively be wiped out? But the genocide still happened, just in another timeline. What a mess to think about."
DaystromInstitute,3a0xcv,berlinbrown,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:59:57 2015 UTC,"That's the fatal flaw in the Borg though, perfection is a moving target that they can never achieve.  If they assimilate the entire galaxy, are they perfect?  No, because the next galaxy over contains more.  And the next and the next.  Even if they managed to assimilate all life in the universe, then you have parallel universes that they can start assimilating.  What about 8472?  Are they perfect if they can't assimilate the superior species in fluidic space?  The logic is flawed because perfection is flawed."

DaystromInstitute,3a0xcv,MageTank,3,Tue Jun 16 15:00:44 2015 UTC,Wouldn't that render each and every species of the new universe redundant to the Borg collective?
DaystromInstitute,3a0xcv,Roadcrosser,2,Tue Jun 16 12:34:48 2015 UTC,Yeah they wouldn't bother with them as in essence they already assimilated them got all the biology and tech they wanted. this would be the theory as I said its just a passing idea I had.

DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,adamkotsko,41,Mon Jun 15 13:34:33 2015 UTC,"I think the Romulans were probably stronger by the TNG era; the Romulans entering the war seemed (to me, at least) to be what tipped the balance from the Federation and Klingons fighting a losing war to one where they had a shot at winning."
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,pm_me_taylorswift,20,Mon Jun 15 13:41:33 2015 UTC,"I agree generally, but also I always assumed that was more of a factor of having one more participant, and an unexpected one with cloaking technology.     Something akin to Stalin pushing for the Allies to invade... in any way, successful or not, to spread out German resources.    Also no doubt the Romulans, content to watch from the sidelines, were prepared to act quickly if needed (the impression is they go in whole hog outright).   Their general suspicious and calculating nature likely had them ready.  I mean even if a greatly smaller fleet, they're fresh, they can cloak.   That has to be huge."
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,CantaloupeCamper,11,Mon Jun 15 15:52:00 2015 UTC,"Right, just like Germany, the Dominion's war-making capacity was inherently limited -- Germany by the fact that they're hemmed in by multiple powers, the Dominion by their long supply lines. With neither side able to make a decisive victory, it had all the makings of a war of attrition -- and so having more bodies to throw into the maw is going to be more important than the details of everyone's technical capacities (assuming they are at an acceptable baseline level)."
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,CantaloupeCamper,11,Mon Jun 15 16:08:02 2015 UTC,"Totally.  I kinda assumed the Romulans would make a good showing at the big battles and etc, but they were also going to kinda play it their own way.   For the most part take a tactical approach and maybe not throw themselves into the meat grinder entirely.    Particularly when it didn't seem like the Dominion were as big an existential threat to them directly as they were to everyone else.   Thus they could really throw punches without taking many defensive losses, a big advantage.    The Federation and Klingons in no place to make demands would just happily accept, and the Romulans could preserve their capabilities for ... anything else they had in mind (read in sinister voice).     Still, they clearly made a showing and weren't afraid of losses, but I always assumed they'd play a slightly more tactical role overall.    Both would be in their best interests."
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,Akula_matatta,3,Mon Jun 15 16:36:32 2015 UTC,"Fighting an enemy with long supply lines plays perfectly into the Romulan way of war. Their advanced cloaking tech and hard-hitting warships are perfect assets for commerce raiding and ""hit and fade"" strikes. Their warbirds were even classified as ""battlecruisers"" by the Federation - a class historically built to raid commerce on the high seas, while being able to outmaneuver and evade anything capable of matching their massive guns."
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,Akula_matatta,9,Tue Jun 16 03:22:26 2015 UTC,"Not to mention, the D'deridex class was an incredibly powerful warship, at least on-par, if not outclassing a Galaxy in terms of raw striking power. Couple that with the fact that they can appear out of nowhere and wreak havoc behind the lines makes them an incredibly powerful asset, even in limited numbers."
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,CantaloupeCamper,6,Tue Jun 16 03:16:15 2015 UTC,I imagine just a few of them on the loose behind the lines would bring commercial and supply ships to a near standstill in a given region..... and pull a  disproportionate number of ships in pursuit.
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,jbcatalyst2,2,Tue Jun 16 03:22:30 2015 UTC,"It's also implied that in the episode ""In the Pale Moonlight"" that the Romulans were preparing to attack as well: Sisko declares at the end that the Romulans formally declared war at 0800, and already struck 15 bases.

DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,leejs,10,Mon Jun 15 14:10:40 2015 UTC,"Having the warp drive on the bridge actually seems like a damn good idea until you get shot there.  Ever need to connect engineering? Just turn around. Chief engineer both on the bridge and at his post. Never lose comms again!  It's also probably how all small ships would be, an engineering bay with a bridge on the front."
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,riker89,7,Mon Jun 15 14:15:20 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that if the Romulans were that weak that the Federation would never have agreed to the treaty provision that prohibited them from using cloaking devices at all.

DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,Lions08Owen16,7,Mon Jun 15 15:07:19 2015 UTC,"If the Romulans were effectively able to bluff their way into getting a Neutral Zone established to protect their territory there is little reason why the Federation wouldn't also agree to a prohibition on cloaking devices.  And the Federation is generally good enough to stand by its agreements (though why they wouldn't research the technology to adequately protect against it, I can't say).  EDIT: It's also possible, given that we don't know the full text of the treaty, that the prohibition on cloaking devices is not the only prohibition mentioned. Perhaps the Federation insisted on prohibitions against things like biological weapons or other weapons of mass destruction and the Romulans agreed to that only if the Federation agreed to the cloaking prohibitions."
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,jandrese,2,Mon Jun 15 15:29:00 2015 UTC,"I believe the treaty also banned subspace weapons, due to them being  inherently dangerous and catastrophically destructive. In fact, I believe the Hobus supernova was caused by experiments with banned subspace weapons."

They likely could have built one quickly for the Defiant, but it probably wouldn't be nearly as advanced as the Romulan or Klingon cloaking devices.  The Federation is also committed to following its agreements and treaties, so just getting a cloaking device from Gowron was out of the question.

It is mentioned on screen that the Romulans entering the war finally allowed the alliance to go on the offensive leading to the taking of the Chintoka system.

DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,RandyFMcDonald,22,Mon Jun 15 20:56:56 2015 UTC,"I think that one of the Star Empire's most pernicious enemies is, simply, itself. They not only never learned to play well with others, they never really learned to play well with each other. The great figures of Vulcan and Klingon history--Surak and Kahless, respectively--got their reputations by ending conflict among their own peoples: Surak by creating a philosophical system (cthia, as it's called in the superlative novel Spock's World), and Kahless by creating a political structure to unify the great houses and direct their aggression outward. The Romulans, not so much; when you consider that they're basically Space Romans (not to be confused with the other Space Romans, or the Space Greeks, or Space Apollo, of course), it should be remembered that the Roman Empire stopped expanding around 117 AD, and that some of its most vicious fights were internal coups or coup attempts, the most infamous event of its history arguably being Julius Caesar's assassination and the ensuing civil war. We don't know that much about Romulans' internal politics over the centuries, except that they tend not to trust each other; Section 31 takes advantage of this when they set up Senator Cretak for a fall. That may be why human or part-human outsiders (Sela, Shinzon) can rise to power within the Star Empire: they're generally just less crazy."

DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,disposable_pants,2,Mon Jun 15 18:44:36 2015 UTC,Romulans political culture seems unnecessarily backstabby. It leaves one to wonder what they could have achieved had they been more functional.
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,RandyFMcDonald,10,Tue Jun 16 00:26:13 2015 UTC,"""The only way the math seems to work out for fighting to a standstill, with a primitive Earth fleet and some minor assistance from allies, is if the Romulans have a crappy fleet as well, and/or they have a very limited number of super-advanced ships along the lines of the Aenar drones, but a very shallow ""bench.""""  The Romulan War Beta canon novels provide an alternative explanation: The Romulans during the early years of the Earth-Romulan War were fighting other enemies at the same time. Once these enemies were destroyed, the Romulans were able to shift their forces over to the Earth front, and would have conquered the humans had other powers not intervened.  There's reason to think that the Romulans have experienced substantial decline relative to other powers. In the 22nd century, had things gone differently the Romulans might have become the dominant hegemon. In the first part of the DS9 two-parter ""Past Tense"", when the timeline was changed to produce a non-starfaring Earth O'Brien picked up Romulan signals from the vicinity of Alpha Centauri. By the 24th century, after the Federation has succeeded and ended up acquiring a vast territory, the Romulans cannot be challengers."
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,RandyFMcDonald,8,Mon Jun 15 14:14:44 2015 UTC,There was also the whole distance aspect to the Earth-Romulan War. Only a few Romulan ships could get near Earth space in any decent time and even less Starfleet ships could get near romulan space. Hence when a few Romulan warp 5 ships are lost Cheron its game over. Also much of that primitive Earth fleet is upgraded they have this whole interesting sub plot on giving up on the NX as over pricey and hard to build so they just chuck out slightly less decent ships. once there on this war footing starfleet does end up with quite a large fleet.
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,sillEllis,3,Mon Jun 15 14:24:34 2015 UTC,"In the FASA RPG setting of the 1980s, the Earth-Romulan War was fought exclusively in space remote from the core worlds of the Federation and the Romulans. The eventual peace was a peace of exhaustion: no one could afford it."
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,RandyFMcDonald,3,Mon Jun 15 14:36:06 2015 UTC,"That is probably the most believable explanation.  The two powers were so far apart that it wasn't practical for them to be fighting in the first place, and they really weren't competing for resources.  The governments on both sides went ""wait, why are we fighting again?"" and the Romulans sent over some really shrewd negotiators that were smart enough to set up the big DMZ and to somehow get the Federation to agree to the ridiculous cloaking device restriction."
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,sillEllis,2,Tue Jun 16 02:55:23 2015 UTC,"At the time, a cloaking device probably wasn't even thought of as remotely practical considering Starfleet technology of the time.

DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,Chrisehh,2,Mon Jun 15 19:52:27 2015 UTC,And there is no real detailed map of the layout of their empire or who their enemies are.
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,disposable_pants,12,Mon Jun 15 23:34:14 2015 UTC,"I always assumed that the Romulans were heavily propped up by the effectiveness of their intelligence capabilities, Tal Shiar.   Cloaking and knowing your enemy well has to be a big advantage.   Let alone their propensity to manipulate other players.  Almost all the interactions we see with the Romulans seem highly calculated and carefully planned with lots of background data ready for them.      If the Romulans were weak the Klingons should have been able to spank them easily before they were a threat, but that doesn't happen and we know the Romulans tinkered with the Klingons plenty of times.   To me all that calculation indicates the Romulans aren't flying blind.  Something else to consider, the Klingons.   There seems to be a three way balance of power, Romulans, Klingons, Federation.   Federation seems to be stronger than the other two but say if the Federation chose to try to eliminate the Romulans that balance would swing heavily in the Federation's favor (more so than it already is).   I'm not sure the Klingons, treaty or best buds, or not would be ok with that........"
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,CantaloupeCamper,6,Mon Jun 15 15:56:07 2015 UTC,"Every time it counted, we've seen that Romulan cloaking does not provide them with a decisive advantage -- most notably in the blockade that keeps them from intervening in the Klingon succession conflict that their supposedly brilliant intelligence service totally screwed up. And in fact, the last we hear from the Romulans before a human clone kills off their entire Senate is them getting totally played by two rogue Starfleet agents acting alone.   There's only so far that espionage and technological gimmicks can take you. They might allow you to punch above your weight -- but in the end, your weight is your weight."

DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,AngryVegetable,3,Tue Jun 16 11:22:39 2015 UTC,Could that be a combination of the of the Tal Shiar's effectiveness and the paranoid nature of the Romulans?  The Cardasian's are more openly aggressive than Romulans and perhaps the Tal Shiar doesn't need to install fear into the Empire's citizens to work.   Perhaps one was more effective at internal/external security than the other?
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,Nyarlathoth,3,Tue Jun 16 11:32:12 2015 UTC,"True, I felt a real thought police vibe from the Obsidian Order."

DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,lunatickoala,3,Tue Jun 16 12:07:10 2015 UTC,"I agree that I think that Star Trek gives the impression that the Obsidian Order is THE intelligence agency in the quadrant.  The downside I think is that the Cardassian government, and even the Order, is far more factional, and internally violent.  Garak and the Obsidian Order seem as focused internally as externally on enemies and we know the Cardassian government had issues with ambitions guls and such.   I think that greatly impacted and influenced the generally dysfunctional and wonky Cardassian situation.  No doubt there are Romulan factions, and you can end up executed, but there seems to be at least on some level an understanding that everyone is operating for the greater good for the Romulan empire..... Cardassians ... I'm not sure the same can be said for them.  In the end I don't doubt the Obsidian Order is better, as that is what we're told, but functionally and as a threat I think they're greatly diminished by some self destructive streaks.   While the Romulans seem relatively more cohesive and maybe benefit from the ultra secrecy inherent to their entire empire."
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,RandyFMcDonald,3,Tue Jun 16 13:48:06 2015 UTC,Yeah the autonomy of the Obsidian order lead to its own downfall. The Cardassian goverment didn't appear very unified.
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,Steffi_van_Essen,8,Tue Jun 16 13:54:08 2015 UTC,"Disagree strongly.    I think you're too dismissive of the Romulan's performance in the war, and then their follow-up plots.   My key piece of evidence is that Earth was able to fight them to a standstill during the ENT era... Now this war is referred to as the Earth-Romulan War in ""Balance of Terror."" To me, this strongly implies that Earth's major allies do not commit themselves fully to the fight.   That United Earth defeated the Romulan fleet almost singlehandedly seems like too big of an assumption to me, particularly if the only evidence seems to be the name of the conflict. For example, the naming of the French and Indian War completely neglects one of the two sides: Great Britain, which actually won.  Your comments about the state of Starfleet outside of the NX project are accurate, but you simply can't infer that the Romulans' fleet disposition was similarly poor based on the idea that Earth was primarily responsible for defeating them. What Starfleet's relative weakness could also - and equally logically - imply is that they won because of significant intervention by their allies in the war, like the Andorians.   Nevertheless, they immediately deployed it for a rather strange and indirect plot to introduce division among the regional powers.   It seems to me that too often you'll simply refer to an act or aspect of a society, episode, or other Star Trek lore as 'convoluted' and then dismiss it out of hand (like the Augment/Klingon arc in ENT season 4), often missing the point entirely.  That said, I really see no issue with the Romulan drone plot. Why is it so 'strange' for the Romulans to want to try to sow division among the other powers? Having multiple enemy factions choose to fight it out and weakening each other in the process is head-bangingly obvious when you intend to conquer them all.   This does not seem to be a wise use of limited resources to me...   ...Why? Those drones are not rated for combat:   VALDORE: The humans have seen too much. We can't allow them to escape. NIJIL: This vessel is a prototype. I told you it wasn't ready for combat.   ...but they could serve as functionally dozens of warbirds if they did succeed in prompting war.   The only way the math seems to work out... is if the Romulans have a crappy fleet... a very limited number of super-advanced ships along the lines of the Aenar drones...   I also disagree with this assumption, that the drones were somehow a special investment. They were actually typical 22nd century warbirds overstocked with the telepresence system. Their combat abilities accurately resemble typical Romulan starships of that era, i.e relatively powerful ones.   Let's also look at the Romulans' characteristic technology: cloaking... a power that's trying desperately to punch above its weight.   Non sequitur. Use of stealth and ambush tactics does not amount to weakness, e.g Klingons.   We also know from Enterprise that the existence of the Romulans was not widely known among the other familiar powers.   This could be accounted for by the fact that they occupy the Beta Quadrant, whereas the founding Federation members tended to occupy the Alpha Quadrant.   Why would the Romulans accept this condition?   For that question I refer you to this post.   After a century, the Romulans' only advances are what amounts to a suicide run   In all fairness, we never see the Romulan command side of things, as we do in ENT's three-parter. Could be a good reason we just didn't see (or maybe they thought the time was due to test the Federation).   They try to meddle in Klingon politics, but it completely backfires -- and once again their precious cloaking device proves to be worthless.   You want to expand on this? Naturally, it backfired, but there is a difference between failing due to one's own incompetence and another's vigilance.   a completely unofficial covert Starfleet operation is able to develop a much more advanced cloaking device despite Starfleet's relative lack of experience with the technology   As much as you dislike this explanation, this was most likely Section 31, and besides, we already knew the Federation was more technically inclined than the other powers and only held back from military cloaks on treaty.   They are beaten at their own game of espionage when Sisko and Garak manage to manipulate them into getting involved in the Dominion War   Likewise, this is only to Garak's credit.   And any time a human comes along, they are elevated to a leadership position -- whether we're thinking of Sela (Tasha Yar's daughter) or Shinzon (Nemesis).   Same to those two (and I'd point out Shinzon was supported by the Remans, primarily).   Centuries after Earth has achieved post-scarcity levels, Romulans are still using slave labor -- a primitive and inefficient method that also leaves their political system vulnerable to slave revolts, as the Reman uprising shows.   We don't know what those Remans were actually doing.  I'm reminded by this of an early post you made where I discussed how both Remans and Romulans seem to occupy similar careers. That is, Nero was himself a 'simple' miner, and we saw Reman doctors on the Scimitar. Additionally, Remus was described as a center for 'heavy weapons construction,' and the Remans themselves were never actually referred to as slaves (except by Shinzon, who was in a position to exaggerate). Data simply called them an 'undesirable caste,' and anyone familiar with US history knows there's a long way of difference between slavery and an 'undesirable' group.  And about the dilithium mines themselves: we see numerous times in Star Trek that mining requires some level of biological oversight, from The Undiscovered Country to TOS' Devil In The Dark. However fatal the conditions might have been, it's plausible that they were really akin to child laborers in the early US textile industry (those mills were pretty dangerous).   another stupid ""Hail Mary"" scheme to replace Picard with his own clone   There you go again. That's by no means a 'stupid' idea. It just didn't work.  Actually, it might even have worked, since the plot was never initiated.   it cost them dearly in the form of giving away their signature technology of cloaking   ...And gained them superior Klingon shields, ships, and weapons. See this post on their starship design.   all their defenses and secrecy and spies are not enough to prevent one of the most famous people in the galaxy, Ambassador Spock, from infiltrating Romulus itself   Spock's famous for pulling stunts as improbable as infiltrating Romulus. And that's among the Federation? What evidence is there that he is actually famous among the Romulans before his reunification effort?  And, speaking of this, it's essentially certain that he did this with Romulan collaboration. In fact, they even got Romulans who were 'among the most high-ranking in the Empire' to defect to the Federation, of all places."
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,KingofMadCows,6,Mon Jun 15 21:46:56 2015 UTC,"I look at it a little bit differently. The main ""problem"" as I see it is the reason for the long gap between meaningful Federation/Earth and Romulan Empire interactions. In essence, after the Earth/Romulan war, there are no meaningful interactions until ""TNG: The Neutral Zone"" when they explicitly state that they are ending their isolationism. The encounters in TOS were merely skirmishes at best.  Them being weak is a possibility, but since they are known to be fairly aggressive and have been space faring for a long time, I find it unlikely that they are weak. Space seemed quite hostile during the period we saw in ENT and you can't claim other systems if you are weak (ENT: Minefield). Though I'll give you a point in your favor; the reason they had mined the planet could have been because they didn't have enough ships to otherwise guard it. Though, the reason could also have been because they are very protective of what they consider theirs (because of their aggressiveness) and playing on this, I'll give you what I think happened during the Earth/Romulan war.  Section 31.  If I were them I would do two things;   Create a group of people that causes unrest and want something different than the sitting government. E.g. a group that wants reunification with Vulcan. I wouldn't be surprised if they even could find a Vulcan operative to help them after what transpired in ENT: Kir'Shara. Make the Romulans fight on two fronts.   The reason they wanted peace and wasn't seen in a long time might have been that they were occupied with another war. With whom I don't know, but an idea I've been toying around with is the Tholian Assembly. We know Earth has them on their radar after ENT: Future Tense. Both Tholians and Romulans, two normally isolationist/xenophobic species, are both active during the TOS period. A ""cold war"" that suddenly got hot perhaps, with the Federation sometimes caught in the crossfire? And what better way to capture cloaked ships than a web? In Nemesis, a meeting with a Tholian ambassador is also deemed such an important task, that leaving a senate meeting doesn't raise suspicion. But I digress.  What is interesting is that the Romulans in TNG era is technology wise on the same level as the Federation. Technology progresses faster during times of conflict and the Federation had a long standing conflict with the Klingons. It wasn't really until Enterprise C that the attitude truly changed, and that wasn't long before the TNG era. We know it can't just have been industrial espionage since many technologies are so different; disruptors, warp core etc. So there must have been an incentive to develop new technology at an accelerated rate, hence my war theory.  We know the Borg changed everything during the TNG era though. Suddenly an extremely strong new party was right on the Romulan's doorstep, and the doorstep of other factions that might have been in a cold war with the Romulans. An incentive for peace for sure, but also an incentive to learn more about the Federation, since they also were threatened by the Borg and you don't want to be caught with your pants down if the Federation gets any ideas.  Back on topic; Weakness! During the Dominion war, the Romulans alone made a huge impact. Sure, the Klingons and the Federation had taken losses, but the Romulans turned it completely around. That isn't weakness. The Jem'Hadar were grown for battle and must have battle tactics encoded into their DNA, yet the Romulans made a massive difference, meaning that they also had a lot of experience in war, i.e. not weak and favors my war theory above.  We know that they are very good when it comes to reverse engineering technology. Narada was built with Borg technology and most likely Dominion technology as well. I wouldn't be surprised if the Scimitar also was built with this technology since they share many visual characteristics, while the old ships and the Scimitar do not (the green ones). This is done in 14 years, from TNG: Q, Who to Nemesis. From learning about the Borg, collecting technology, reverse-engineering it, building prototypes, to having a finished new class of ships. That is pretty impressive to me.  To answer you question; Maybe. They may be weak, but I don't think so, and I hope it's not so, because I like Romulans, and that would make them smaller in my eyes."
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,akbrag91,3,Mon Jun 15 17:45:43 2015 UTC,"Lots of great thoughts in here, but there is one complication you forgot to take into account: during the late 23rd century, relations between the Star Empire and the Federation improved enough for Romulan Ambassador Nanclus to sit in on what (presumably) was a classified tactical briefing on Operation Retrieve during the fallout from Chancellor Gorkon's assassination. That, in my opinion, is one of the most complicating factors in the political depiction of the Romulans."
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,bakhesh,3,Mon Jun 15 22:46:37 2015 UTC,"It's a bit weird I admit. It's however not unfeasible that the Federation might have extended an olive branch to the Romulans and allowed an ambassador for a time. AFAIK there are nothing known how long that had been though. Short enough for no other shenanigans to transpire at least, and knowing the Romulans, it can't have been that long.  Perhaps having the ambassador on the meeting was due to good faith and official Romulan protests of not being included in such an 'historic meeting'? Though we know there were some, hollow, interactions before that, in Star Trek V, on Nimbus III.  After the incident in Star Trek VI, I'd suspect that any formal ties was once again broken, because in TNG: The Neutral Zone they say that they ""are back"", which implies that they have to have been gone for some time. I doubt that the ties were ever that formal though and having a Romulan ambassador was mostly a symbolic gesture."
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,watcher45,2,Tue Jun 16 08:39:57 2015 UTC,Right. The Romulans in the late 23rd century century may well have been playing nice. Who knows? Maybe we could have had a Federation-Romulan entente if things went differently.
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,RandyFMcDonald,3,Tue Jun 16 00:29:10 2015 UTC,Thanks for the very thorough response. I like the Tholian idea -- and noticing the reference in Nemesis shows a great eye for detail!
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,comradepitrovsky,2,Mon Jun 15 18:17:46 2015 UTC,"Perhaps the Romulan Empire has a large standing navy when you consider the size of their economy. It seems that the Federation going into the TNG era is not on a permanent war footing (with its Galaxy Class explorer ships and whatnot) and when the Romulans enter the Dominion War (which had been going on for a bit) their fresh and ready military makes a big difference on the battlefield.  Also their willingness to recruit Reman slaves to fight, and to put so much resources into a ""supership"" known as the Scimitar might suggest a shortage of manpower and resources."
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,Futuretrack_Five,5,Mon Jun 15 18:51:10 2015 UTC,"I've had similar theories regarding Romulan military strength.  Particularly the use of the cloaking device (and their tendency towards subterfuge).  Cloaking gives you massive strategic flexibility.    Defensive:  It's risky, but you can leave certain areas weakly defended in order to concentrate forces elsewhere, and the enemy is unlikely to capitalize on this weakness because they don't know it's there, and have to assume that potentially a powerful Romulan force may be ready to defend any target they pick.  Additionally, by concentrating forces into fewer defensive areas, you may be able to crush several attacks against you.  Your opponent's successful strikes against poorly defended targets may be considered mostly luck, and with other attacks being decidedly wiped out, would be evaluated as very risky.  Furthermore, it might be difficult to judge the effectiveness of your strikes.  Attack 1 tried to hit an apparently high value target and was annihilated by cloaked Warbirds (apparently high value because it was heavily defended).  Attack 2 blew up a supply depot without any resistance, maybe the supply depot was abandoned, a decoy, or just not as valuable as we thought.    The largest advantage (Both offense and defense) is being able to not engage enemy forces until you have advantage.  If your smaller forces can avoid getting wiped out by superior enemy forces, you take fewer losses, and can use them in situations where they would win, which will decidedly skew combat results.  If you can avoid any 2v3 fights, but pick and choose to commit in any 4v3 fights (strength wise), you're going to make a very good showing of it.  Offensive:  The cloak really shines here to.  You can concentrate your forces and strike the enemy wherever you want. Attack where they are weak, avoid where they are strong.  You fight on your terms, your choice of forces and location of the battlefield.  They do not know where you will strike, they may try to defend everything and be stretched thin, or they may concentrate, and you may pick the ripe undefended targets.  Either way, this confers great advantage to you.  I read somewhere (probably beta cannon somewhere, maybe some of the background for one of the games, I think it was TOS or Movies I-VI era, likely after they got warp drive from trading the cloak to the Klingons) that the Romulans employed a very fast operational tempo.  What seemed to be several strikes along mulitple fronts performed by multiple Romulan fleets was actually one Romulan fleet with a very fast operational tempo attacking multiple locations by traveling quickly over large distances to give the appearance of multiple fleet offenses.  This leads to them being over-estimated in power level, but thanks to the cloak they can often effectively perform there.  For the Dominion War, I agree, they quite likely pushed almost all their forces onto the front to put on a good show for their allies, but left only skeleton reserve and defense forces.  They may have even hinted the opposite with feigned/not-so-feigned reluctance to commit more forces.  Something along the lines of ""We know both of you (Federation and Klingons) have each committed roughly ten of your twenty battlefleets to the offensive, holding the remainder in reserve and defensive positions.  We do not trust you, so we are only committing seven of our twenty battlefleets.  The remaining thirteen are in reserve in the event that this assault fails or one of you tries to take advantage of us.""  While actually they've committed seven of their nine or eleven battlefleets, and are desperately hoping they don't get pushed into committing another three.  It makes me think somewhat of France and even more so of Britain during WWII (managing a huge empire that you're effectively breaking to put on one last hurrah before it crumbles).  The US and USSR were the superpowers for the next several decades, but Churchill got counted in ""The Big Three"", and both France and Britain got permanent security council seats on the UN.  I've been meaning to do a post on Star Trek (particularly DS9 Dominion War) parallels with WWI and WWII and a couple other things, but I need more time, and I don't want to compete with this for post of the week."
DaystromInstitute,39wvbn,AesonDaandryk,3,Mon Jun 15 23:48:10 2015 UTC,"I look forward to your post, whenever you decide to write it. If you read the other comments, you'll see that WWII analogies in particular have been helpful for our discussion. WWI might be more appropriate, though, if the war turns out to be basically pointless."

DaystromInstitute,39z372,pduffy52,10,Tue Jun 16 09:47:18 2015 UTC,"I believe they mention multiple times that the Prophets were actively preventing any Dominion ships from trans-versing the wormhole. It wasn't that they just got rid of the 2,200 Jem'Hadar ships and left it at that. Dukat tells Weyoun ""What if I told you this artifact would make it possible for reinforcements to come through that wormhole?"" or something to that effect."
DaystromInstitute,39z372,BoomierBoom,15,Tue Jun 16 02:27:49 2015 UTC,Odo.  He's going back to teach the Founders to trust solids.

DaystromInstitute,39z372,Cwy123,3,Tue Jun 16 09:55:47 2015 UTC,"First off, there's an armistice declared and a treaty signed. It might be that the Founders actually honor such declarations - they have worked with them in the past (and for example, never actively violated their agreement with Bajor).   Secondly, the Dominion lost in the Alpha Quadrant and has no more allies left. They were very dependent on cooperating with local powers to supply vessels and forces. They probably could not achieve this anymore, after the slaughter of the Cardassian people.   Third, Odo returend to the Great Link. I'm positive that his experiences with solids will change something in the collective mind of the Founders. They seem to respect individuality and Odo's longing for peace may weight greater than their desire for revenge - especially now that he's back for good and not a renegade anymore.  Fourth, the Prophets still protect the Wormhole and are entirely capable of opposing the Dominion. 2,800 ships vanished within a single moment due to the Prophet's will. Even for the Dominion this can't be an insignificant number.  Just some thoughts on the matter."
DaystromInstitute,39z372,butterhoscotch,3,Tue Jun 16 10:10:06 2015 UTC,"I think the war left them a bit scared and raw. The Great Link, I think, not only have Odo trying to change their mentality they also nearly got wiped out, by the Federation.  I think that is holding them back. The Alpha Quadrant to now completely against them with little chance of the Dominion dividing them again. The Alpha Quadrant has fought the Dominion and won. The Dominion will play the long game before doing anything new.  And they will have Odo preaching peace. It might just work to bring about a change in the Great Link.   If that does not work, then they will be patient. Remember the Federation nearly managed to wipe the Great Link. I would reckon the Founders are a little cautious about this Federation."

DaystromInstitute,39zexq,MageTank,10,Tue Jun 16 00:58:20 2015 UTC,"The doctor should be the one making the call on impairment.  If you start letting officers relieve each other without requiring appropriate evidence that can be verified by other professionals, youd end up with anarchy pretty fast as your chain of command turned into a popularity contest.  However, impairment isnt the only reason someone can be relieved by their subordinates. Specifically, giving illegal orders is grounds for relieving the Captain of command, whatever his physical or mental health.  For example, intentionally violating a direct order from a superior would be illegal and require the First Officer or any other bridge officer to disobey the order and relieve the Captain.  This is why the Captain always makes a dramatic speech to the bridge asking them to voice their objections up front before defying an order from Starfleet.  The problem with the Picard clone was that he didnt order the crew to do anything that was specifically wrong.  All he did was make some very bad risk assessments, choosing to face extreme danger for a trivial reason, which falls well within the Captain's legal authority.  If only he had told Worf to start flushing crew members he didnt like out the airlock, or ordered the ship to cross the Neutral Zone and blast some Romulan Colonies, they could have had Picard Clone in a holding cell before the opening credits finished rolling."

Do starfleet crews really have no choice but to mutiny if they feel their captain is impaired?   I think anytime a captain is removed from command, the word mutiny is going to come up.   I'm sure there are situational procedures that allow for the captain to be relieved, they are just few and far between and could result in a charge of mutiny if found to be baseless."

I remember that captain who went off with the phoenix blowing up every cardassian he saw. He was relieved by picard, but not even arrested before they got to port."
DaystromInstitute,39zexq,tadayou,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:08:52 2015 UTC,"Under normal circumstances I'm sure that the crew might be able to contact Starfleet Command. The Enterprise-D was never that far removed from Federation space that subspace communication could not be established. In this case it seems easy for worrying staff members to inquire with the admiralty about how to deal with their Captain.   The situation is certainly more complex when Starfleet ships are on their own. Janeway ran a pretty tight command and there were a few situations were she relieved officers opposing her decisions (think Chakotay in both, ""Scorprion"" and ""Equinox""). I'm not sure what it would have taken to relieve her of command. On the other hand there were situations were officers overruled decisions through debate and discussions (think Insurrection or Voyager's ""Night"").   A situation were the Captain has to be relieved immediately sort of implies that the entire social structure aboard the starship has already collapsed - civilized debates can no longer be held, the Captain is giving nonsensical or dangerous orders, the situation is dire and danger imminent. A mutiny is a choice then, and would probably be accepted by Starfleet/Federation courts, if the circumstances and reasons are sound and understandable. The danger of a mutiny is, of course, that not everyone might follow suit and the crew might be split - which could make a dire situation even more disastrous.   Another thought: Have we ever actually witnessed a Captain being relieved by a medical officer? I know that doctors have quirked about, but did any of them ever go through with it? I'm just wondering how easy it would be for the Captain to ignore their CMO, or what the doctor could actually do in that case?"

Generally speaking a captain has to be able to do what needs to be done, without informing the crew.... possibly even if it is a possibly a suicide mission, or close to it.     If you provide a no confidence mechanism it's possible that the above missions never get done, and generally I think that is too much of a trade off for the security for the rare alien control of the captain type stuff."
