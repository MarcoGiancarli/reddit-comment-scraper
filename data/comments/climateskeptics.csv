Yeah, but I'm pretty certain it had been growing for 30 years before 1979, so it really had been falling back to the levels we enjoyed in the 1940s.  Funny that they picked the coldest time of the last 75 years to start tracking the ice, isn't it?   Overall it was concluded that changes in summer temperatures in the Arctic have a greater impact on the ice than was thought.    Seriously?  I mean, seriously?.    After the failed prediction that the Arctic will be ""ice free"" or ""nearly ice free"" in parts of the summer, by which I think they really mean that the sea ice will be sparse enough to drive a boat through for a couple of days in late September, before it all starts to freeze solid again, by 2013, they've decided to kick the can down the road.  Now they predict the same thing, but for later, like 2025 or 2030.  That should be sufficiently long enough away that they won't have to answer questions when the prediction fails again."

They modified past temps, cooling them under the excuse that technology at the time wasn't capable of making accurate measurements, and then warmed the present by adjusting ARGO data (relatively recent system of buoys accurate to a thousandth of a degree or some such) using SST data.     SST data, which is collected from ships, can range from:      Sailors put water in a bucket, haul it up, drop in a thermometer. Ranging from canvas, to wooden, to steel buckets.     Measuring temp of intake water being used to cool the ship's engine.     Only taking measurements when they feel like it, because a sailor is not going out in a storm to fill and measure a bucket of water.       This covers some other problems with Karl and SST data in depth     Interestingly enough NOAA has the USCRN and USCHN which are climate reference networks designed for gathering data for the climate, rather than the weather (As most stations were designed to do and then adjusted to attempt to determine climate).    Curiously enough you'll notice the pause or even slight cooling from these datasets, sans the SST data."

Usually they give an explanation as to why, but sometimes they don't. I personally haven't see their explanation for the latest series of adjustments.

climateskeptics,3e2ixd,kriegson,5,Tue Jul 21 16:17:16 2015 UTC,"The only ""Why"" they provided:     Q. In general, why do datasets transition?  A. The curation and stewardship of historical weather and climate data, like any vital records, must account for changes over time. These may include: the introduction or discovery of new source data (such as the digitizing of records previously held on paper), changes in the situation or usage policies of data providers, progress in the scientific understanding of data and related analysis (such as the relationship between buoy and ship-borne data), improved quality control techniques, and evolving computational and storage technologies.      In other words ""Because we have to change them sometimes when we get new info.""     No specific explanation as to why the past was cooled or why they decided to go along with using SST to adjust argo rather than the other way around, the only mention that they did.

climateskeptics,3e351n,HAL9000000,10,Tue Jul 21 16:26:04 2015 UTC,"Mostly it's the form of argument and lack of action for me. If someone can reasonably, without resorting to several argumentative fallacies, provide convincing information I'm more than willing to take a look into it.     But alarmists are almost invariably toxic. Resorting to demeaning anyone who disagrees, appeal to authority, ad-hom anything a skeptic might provide as counter-argument.     The fact that the media and politicians have picked up and run with the story while trying to crush the opposition likewise has made anything that comes out of their mouths seem extremely disingenuous at best.      It's that attitude that got me interested in the debate to begin with. I've been told the sky is falling for a few decades now, and it simply never comes true. The more you look into history and natural variability the more you can see it never will be.     Also, contrary to their demands for cleaner energy, no one is willing to loosen the red tape around nuclear. Despite the drought in California, they don't want to implement desalination plants.  Despite their ""grave fears"" for the world, they still charter private jets to massive fundraisers and live like the disconnected aristocrats they are."
climateskeptics,3e351n,kriegson,2,Tue Jul 21 16:42:49 2015 UTC,"The fact is, you can look for and find data and facts that does not come from alarmists.  Your response really seems to sound like you're not a disbeliever in climate change so much as you are annoyed by people who want to tell you how big of a problem it is according to the data.  The reason that media and politicians try to ""crush the opposition"" has to do with the reality that they look at data and listen to scientists who say ""this is not a controversial issue because the data is so clear.  People who say it's a controversial issue are misinformed.""  But you want them to equally report ""both sides"" of an issue in which all of the data says there are not two sides that are potentially equally correct.  I do think media organizations could do a great service if they were to try to shift the debate to a place where there is significant valid controversy: what to do about climate change.    Again, it seems to me that ""climate skeptics"" like yourself are possibly persuadable to the idea that climate change is real but you don't like the possible solutions that are being suggested (or pushed upon you).  And I do think it's a valid complaint to say that we don't have a good debate about how to address the problem of climate change.  But people on the ""climate skeptic"" side of things also have some blame here because you won't even come to the table, so to speak, to discuss the issue.  Also, I agree that nuclear energy should be part of the conversation.  So I don't know, maybe you're reading/talking to/listening to the wrong people?  Lots of scientists and other people will offer very hard facts and data about what's happening.  Data by itself is not emotional either.  I think climate scientists probably feel like the general public (those who trust that climate change is real and a problem and those who don't) won't be able to really understand the data.  And they're busy.  So they don't end up talking to a lot of people.  When they do, a lot of them no doubt feel it necessary to be persuasive."
climateskeptics,3e351n,kriegson,3,Tue Jul 21 18:16:03 2015 UTC,"There's mountains of data on the subject and nothing points towards carbon being the driver, heating being unprecedented or coming anywhere near 2c.      The problem is that most alarmist rely on projections. Skeptics rely on observations.  If the theory (projections) do not match the facts (observations) then the theory is wrong.     This is not a controversial issue      Clearly it is. The 97% consensus concepts are simply marketing or propaganda. Every single study I've seen so far that supposedly entails a consensus on the subject is only ever limited to a handful of people or very careful wording.      There is a petition that has only been circulated in the US and in the US alone it has gained over thirty thousand signatures agreeing that Carbon is not the primary driver, and we are not heading towards cataclysm.    Of the ""Consensus"" papers I've seen, most citing maybe a few hundred scientists at most, this dwarfs them by far.      Not that it matters anyhow, considering that consensus has no place in science. Only verifiable fact. If a single scientist can prove a theory wrong, or observation prove projection wrong, then it is wrong and the theory needs to be revised.     Projections have been wrong time and again when it comes to predicting the rate of warming. They all failed to project the pause on surface and atmospheric temps.    Studies ranging from the vostok ice cores to stomata data indicate carbon is not the driver."

Considering the IPCC is a bureaucratic organization that simply collects studies and votes on which to use for a report, it does not conduct studies.    How about yourself? Perhaps you should stop posting because your opinion doesn't matter on the subject because you aren't a climatologist?

Even if I spend 40 hours researching published data on this issue my opinion simply can't compare to someone who has done that every week for years or decades. It doesn't mean we should stop talking about it but we should be deferring our own opinions on the science in favor of expert opinions.

So given that we can agree that these things are not going to happen next month and that we agree that AGW is a problem and partly human caused, do you think anything should be done at all?  If so, what do you think should be done?  Honestly, I'm really just trying to understand where the skepticism exists.  Also, a scan of your front page is not articles saying ""we believe AGW is real and has major human contributions, but we just don't like the alarmists.""  The front page is mostly articles saying ""here's more evidence that AGW is not really happening and not really caused by humans."

Again, this is hypothetical but this is what many climate scientists believe is the result of our current path.  And if we can both hypothetically pretend that this is happening, then don't you believe that this would be the greatest threat the nation has ever faced?  That's what this is all about: Obama's advisers have told him that this is where we could be headed without changes being made.

Is it back on track with average ice, or is it back on track with what has been widely considered below average years?  the global one seems to show that area has been largely consistent, but I'd argue that area isn't the best way to measure a block of ice.  A block of ice measuring 30 meters deep and a block of ice measuring 1 meter deep can both be equal in the area that they take up.

RSS UAH show pause or cooling   This is an alright argument.   Greenland ice sheet indicates average or cooling above average ice, slow and late melt   The melting has now picked up to above average levels again after a slow start.    antarctic shows record ice,   true   arctic is back on track for average ice.   I see someone has already argued this point in another thread.   The last time it snowed in july in hawaii (current heatwave non-withstanding) was back in the 90's as I recall?   We all know this is a poor argument, because I can just say the canadian rockies had significantly less snow than average this summer and our local ski resort had to close beginning of february because of lack of snow which is the first time since 1987 (this beats out your 1990 year).   If you want to claim the world is warming and a number of locations are experiencing unusual signs of cooling or at least a ""pause"" then you may want to re-evaluate your hypothesis.   Saying ""a number of places"" is not the correct wording to disprove the global warming hypothesis, and you should know this.

climateskeptics,3e0hx3,kriegson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:42:53 2015 UTC,"When I speak of average ice in the arctic I'm speaking of the recent average. Going by sea ice or volume you can see it's not simply dropping more each year. Actually gone up to the average or slightly above for the last decade or so. I'd have to look into concentration however as that's been brought to my attention as another metric we can measure.        North America constitutes 16.5% of the earth's land area and USCHN (or was it USCRN? :P) has stations in Russia, Alaska, Hawaii, Mexico and much of the mainland of course.      Ultimately however there is plenty of literature that acknowledges the surface temp pause and takes the atmospheric pause for granted. We're mostly looking for heat in the deep ocean (debunked) or within a few hundred meters.     Given that this heat is found via expansion, and sea level rise has actually slowed in the last decade or so, this would infer that said expansion may not be very significant at all."

Some paleoclimatologists and historians claim that the pleasant conditions of the MWP allowed the settlements in Iceland and Greenland to prosper and Norse explorers to venture to the coasts of Labrador and Newfoundland to hunt and fish. They interpret records of bountiful harvests over much of Europe to mean that the region benefited from a series of extended summers and mild winters.

climateskeptics,3dnehw,nixfu,9,Sat Jul 18 19:00:33 2015 UTC,"And I still don't care.  The people in the 1930s and 1940s were so advanced that they were able to design airplanes, rockets, and figure out nuclear energy, but no one was able to take the temperature of the air or water with enough accuracy, and rather than make random mistakes, so many people over-estimated the temperature that we now have had to adjust the global temperature down by half a degree.  We're still so bad at it that they are adjusting temperatures today, and now they want me to get excited about 0.05º of warming?  Bah.  Now, when the current El Niño gets going, then we'll see some record temperatures.  Not any puny 0.05º.  What I really wonder is if we will continue to climb at 0.05º per year, or if we'll have some cool years coming, too?  I'm guessing we'll have a cool year in the mix there as well, like we always have.  So, in a ""warming world"" we should expect to have another record cold year or two by 2020, right?  But, having a new record year, ever, isn't proof of much.  It's how much we warm over another decade, three more decades, five more decades that matters.  We know the world warmed rapidly after about 1976.  They've adjusted the record so many times, though, it's hard to know if the warming is a series of small steps, or a few big leaps.  What is clear is that after about 2003, the rate seems to be different.  Maybe this will be the ""big step"" year that moves us back to the 0.17º per decade warming we've come to expect.  Or even, dare I say it, the 0.2º per decade that the climate scientists told us that we should be expecting to see by now."

The world's oceans are not actually ""oversaturated"", but they are the clear mitigating factor for why rising global temperatures have tempered in recent years.   Of course they are.  The majority of the heat the climate system has accumulated in the last century has been absorbed by the oceans.  The mean temperature increase for the oceans has been about 0.09°C over the last 60 years or so, which represents about 0.27 W/m2 of forcing over that whole period, if I am recalling Levitus, et al, 2012 correctly.   But now it appears that oceanic carbon absorption (and resultant acidification) slowing down the rate of global warming might appear to be reversing trend.   I think your argument is still faulty.  Atmospheric CO2 has continued to increase during the pause at the same rate, or even a slightly higher rate, than before the pause.

Some passages, emphasis mine:   Carbon dioxide reacts with seawater to make carbonic acid. Deep seawater naturally has more carbon dioxide, and less oxygen, simply because it is old. It has been breathed for centuries by everything alive in the ocean without remixing with oxygen from the surface. These frigid depths are a natural source of acidic water that wells up from time to time. When the water is acidic enough it dissolves calcium carbonate of the sort that makes up pteropod shells.  ‘In the Southern Ocean, that usually happens at 750 meters down,’ Bednaršek told me. The depth is important, as Antarctic pteropods typically dive no deeper than 400 meters. ‘But we found the dissolution was starting to happen at 125 to 375 meters.’   It's not ""silly little local readings"".  These are precise measurements at various oceanic depths.  There are tangible effects from acidification.  And it's fine if you disagree.

climateskeptics,3dn2iy,Will_Power,2,Fri Jul 17 19:52:51 2015 UTC,"He makes the mistake of trying to apply it [the exponential function] to population, though, which generally follows either a logistic or gaussian curve.   Actually he's both correct and yet incorrect in doing so.   Populations can and DO in fact (for a while) follow the exponential function in terms of rapid expansion... and then other limiting factors take over: constraints on space, resources (food & water), disease, etc.  Ideally, yes populations WILL then either realize their own problems and reduce/stabilize their growth so that it transitions to an ""S-curve"" logistic function; or else perforce other external factors will take over (war, disease, etc) and the transition will not be smooth, and the population may in fact collapse.   He's just talking about the exponential function.    This is the key. What he's really doing is attempting to confront the fallacy (as repeated almost incessantly by virtually every politician, economist, etc) that ""regular steady growth"" of things is a ""stable"" thing, regularly phrased as ""smart growth"" or ""sustainable growth""-- people often justify that because the rate seems to be low, especially at things like 1% or 5% -- when in fact due to compounding, any ""steady"" rate of increase (if maintained) will eventually become exponential, and invariably problematic.  If you watch the whole series, he actually spends a big part of the time talking about how this affects things like finances and economics (especially true relative to ""fiat"" money expansion, and banking credit money, etc); as well as the affects on local systems (i.e. if your cities population is expanding at an almost steady 10% per year -- whether due to in-migration or births -- you're going to need to double your local infrastructure capacity {things like water & sewer & housing} every ~7 years; and then double it again by the end of the subsequent 7 years, and again 7 years later, etc).  That is NOT a bad thing for people to be confronted with -- and it definitely IS something that is non-intuitive for people who don't comprehend (at a basic, root level of their thinking) what ""steady growth"" means -- as he notes (repeatedly) it's STILL ""growth"", and growth can/will eventually butt up against things.  Does he eventually get to talking about ""Malthusian"" kinds of things? Yes... but I think he actually does so in a RATIONAL manner.  Keep in mind that Malthus himself wasn't ""wrong"", it's that the so called ""Malthusians"" didn't really comprehend what he was talking about; that he was really trying to explain why ""poverty"" was a persistent and recurring cyclical thing; and he qualified his predictions of ""doom"" (which were predictions of major problems rather than ""apocalypse"" -- and a ""Malthusian Catastrophe"" as described by MALTHUS was simply overgrowth which creates a predictable tragic population decrease {aka ""crash""} back down to a lower level... and then the cycle starts over again.)  The so called ""Malthusians"" misunderstood and misrepresented that, and went about in ""Chicken Little"" fashion screaming about the ""Sky falling"" (much like the Alarmists are doing with CAGW).  And yes this guy DOES hit on ""global warming"" but you have to keep in mind that this is really a series of lectures/essays that the guy initially created DECADES ago -- and which were then later (at the end of his career (keep in mind he was born in 1923, and died in 2013 at age 90); being published as a series of essays in 2004 (when he was 71), and having a previously recorded series of lectures (IIRC the actual video was done in either the late 1980's or the early 1990's, when he was approaching retirement) and then converted & uploaded to YouTube around circa 2008 -- the point being that is was a fairly EARLY part of the ""Global Warming"" before the political hysteria took over; and when it still seemed fairly plausible."
climateskeptics,3dn2iy,LWRellim,3,Sat Jul 18 15:00:40 2015 UTC,"I've started watching the rest of the videos in the series. I find them quite intriguing so far. In the second video for instance, it appears that he switches the topic from math to a Malthusian discussion about population... I wonder what course this is.  Edit: he is Albert Allen Bartlett, emeritus professor of physics at the University of Colorado at Boulder and this is his famous lecture on Arithmetic, Population and Energy.  Edit 2: it's interesting to note that he was wrong (he shows some statistics about oil production in the US and makes predictions in part 5 of the lecture - which we know today to be incorrect).  Edit 3: it is only at the very end of part 7 he utters the words global warming. That's not too bad actually, by alarmist standards."
climateskeptics,3dn2iy,Florinator,2,Fri Jul 17 17:50:05 2015 UTC,"See my other comment/reply ITT under Will_Power's comment because nearly all of it is relevant here.  The points he makes are all fairly pertinent, and not (IMO) ""alarmist"" -- though one can easily see how naive/foolish people could come away from this lecture series and then go out and (especially if they then fall under the spell of someone like Al Gore with his BS) try to become yet another ""Captain Save the Planet from Humanity"".  I really think the people that do that... are entirely missing the point.  Per example, what do the ""Captain Save the Planet"" types regularly talk about?  They love phrases like ""sustainable growth"" and ""smart growth"" -- both things that he specifically takes to task and called nonsensical.  The thing is that there is ALWAYS the risk whenever you teach something, that some students will ""get"" only part of your message -- and will then, from their distorted partial comprehension, go off on a tangent to push a very PERVERSE theory & worldview.  We've already noted one of the ""ditches"" of this -- the alarmist view (i.e. that humanity is a parasitic bacteria infesting the planet and dooming it {and ourselves} to some dystopian catastrophic apocalyptic end) -- but there is also the OTHER ""ditch"", and that is the Kurzweil et al, ""futurology"" types who go off on their utopian fantasies that technology will solve everything, create a ""post scarcity"" world (i.e. infinite unlimited... everything) and that as a result everyone (regardless of how many) will become uber-rich and served by dozens of AI robots tending our every need, etc., and that it will all be done with ZERO ""tradeoffs"" or compromises... why?  Well because progress (in their view) is exponential, it's happening faster and faster and faster and that everything is approaching some magical ""singularity"" (aka the ""nirvana"" or ""rapture"" of the nerds).  But note what he is ACTUALLY talking about, what he ACTUALLY focuses on: the pragmatic/practical things -- things like if the Denver area population continues it's ""steady"" rapid rate of growth, that it will mean finding twice as much water building twice as many sewer treatment plants; and then a few years later building twice as much again (a quadrupling of initial capacity), and then again & again.  His point being that THAT is probably not possible, it is not ""sustainable"" in that location (i.e. that much like the growth in the Los Angeles area, limits are going to be reached & overreached, in terms of water, etc). That in my opinion is not an ""alarmist"" view, it's an entirely rational and practical one."

climateskeptics,3diin9,Florinator,7,Thu Jul 16 15:37:06 2015 UTC,"Climate science is a whole different ballgame compared to evolution. Evolution is a proven and established theory that receives little (if any) criticism from the scientific community, and the only arguments against it are religion-based. Accordingly, creationism has no place in schools. However, climate science is the subject of active research and the conclusions drawn by alarmist politicians are based on faulty science presented to them by political activists."
climateskeptics,3diin9,etgohomeok,3,Thu Jul 16 20:14:25 2015 UTC,"Still, evolution is an excellent example of where the ""Science is settled!' argument is faulty.     While the basics of evolution are consolidated, we're still learning quite a bit about it.     For instance we discovered that homo-sapients and neanderthals interacted quite a bit and it appears that our ancestors were biased to be quite violent towards neanderthals. All of this relatively recently. Our ancestors may have been the primary cause for their extinction.     Neanderthals have been classified as different sub-species at times, or even as entirely different species.    Quote an interesting bit of study     Similar to climate science, obviously a few things are rooted in observational, reproducible fact. Carbon is a greenhouse gas that can warm the planet, humanity has emitted a degree of carbon, and the planet has warmed.    Not all three of these are necessarily related however."
climateskeptics,3diin9,kriegson,4,Thu Jul 16 20:44:21 2015 UTC,"There's also still no absolute proof that the only evolutionary force exists through natural selection at conception. In fact there's quite a bit of growing evidence that the subconscious regions of your brain influence your DNA & biological traits passed to your offspring. And when you really think it through, it is seemingly impossible to achieve the perfection of many species' designs without a guided evolutionary force.   Every single bit of that thesis accepts the general theory of evolution, but just like climate skepticism, you will get ridiculed for discussing it & equated to creationists."
climateskeptics,3diin9,qp0n,2,Thu Jul 16 21:43:11 2015 UTC,"I find it said hearing some religious folks talk about it, many are convinced that people who believe in evolution think pokemon exist. Evolution by my definition is simply that organisms do naturally and ""unnaturally"" change overtime physically and genetically, affected by internal and external forces. Genetic roulette vs  survival of the fitter.   Eg humans exist because the extensive development of the brains in mammals helped them survive. Those with better weapons, tools, clean water, medical care access have a higher probability than those without as well as be able pass on some of these traits on to their offspring through genetic giftedness to teaching.   And ""unnaturally"" has quotations because I dont believe anything to be unnatural.

I see a dangerously luddite, anti-capitalist movement raging against the very industry responsible for the vast majority of human prosperity. I hold no affection for fossil fuels. If fusion was perfected tomorrow and battery tech cheaply outstripped the energy density of petroleum I would jump for joy.   But we live in the real world.

And even if it won't affect us, do you feel well knowing you're destroying coral reefs and natural habitats of creatures that are defenseless against this change?  Personally, I don't want to take any risk on this.  Capitalism isn't the perfect socio economical system. But we have to improve it every time we can. So I don't see anticapitalist movements as something bad in a democratic society, but rather as healthy challenges to a system that leads to so many injustices (wealth gap, homeless people, working a lifetime 24/7, etc.).

Banning fossil fuels right now would literally kill billions. You've come into this argument with your decision already made. We do not know how bad the effects of climate change will be. Our best guess at equilibrium climate sensitivity is literally exactly the same as it was 25 years ago. It has a range of 3C. That doesn't speak to me of increased confidence of outcomes.   And even if it won't affect us, do you feel well knowing you're destroying coral reefs and natural habitats of creatures that are defenseless against this change?   I consider human life infinitely more important than animal or plant life.   but rather as healthy challenges to a system that leads to so many injustices   Why does a system that is clearly the best need challenges?

Somebody who probably was some kind of accredited oceanographer noticed and we debated briefly.  He(?) claimed acceleration. We debated inches, projected forward until 2100. He clearly said there was acceleration and that meant something like 12 inches. Whereas I was like, only  6 inches. .. We differed on an order of magnitude of a few inches/century.   Meanwhile the media claim many feet. With Al Gore saying 6 feet by 2100. Note that this guy disagreed with me on a matter of inches, but with Gore by a matter of feet. But, funnily enough, he had no plans whatsoever of correcting Gore, but wanted to correct me! (duh, Gore's massive exaggerations have generated grant money for them).  btw,  I am still of the opinion there has been no acceleration."

climateskeptics,3dbmt7,deck_hand,5,Wed Jul 15 15:04:39 2015 UTC,"The question isn't ""are isolated areas seeing local sea level rise as compared with their shores,"" because that's basically meaningless.  The actual question here is ""are all of the oceans, as a whole, rising at a much more rapid rate than they did 100 years ago.""  With all of the adjustments and fudging going on with the data, I'm not sure we know the answer to that question.  We might not know for decades.  The climate alarmists talk about 2 meters of sea level rise in the next 85 years or so, and of course some are saying ""even if we don't emit one more thing, we're locked into 6 meters of sea level rise.""   They don't mean along one shore, they mean the average for the entire planet.  So, maybe we'll see an acceleration that can give us 2 meters in the next 85 years.  If there was no acceleration at all, we could expect the 21st century to have a rise of about 8 inches, same as the 20th century.  This is actual rise.  That would mean that the liquid surface of the world would basically expand by 16 inches.  It would slow the rotation of the planet.  Now, how much sea level rise acceleration would we need to see to be able to know that we're going to see 2 meters of rise by 2100?  How much by 2030, how much by 2050, how much by 2070, for example?"

It's pretty much done.
climateskeptics,3d9yf0,kriegson,3,Tue Jul 14 17:43:22 2015 UTC,Alarmists took natural variation's upward tick in temperatures and tied their scam to it.

If there were a lot more renewables in the Middle East, they wouldn't have the financial resources they now have. 2) if the United States didn't have an oil addicted president there wouldn't have been a ruinous war in Iraq, that led to the creation of ISIS.   So it's rather a short sighted, greedy worldview that leads to climate change and the same worldview based on relentless exploitation of resources, like fossil fuels, water, or even of people, leads to a lot of fuckedupness in our world. It's a mind frame that needs to be changed in order to stop climate change.

Besides, it's easy with 20/20 hindsight to be mad about oil ""destroying"" the environment, but that's a.) not true and b.) you literally wouldn't be here to whine about it if oil hadn't become the underlying fuel of freedom (love that phrase).

But the USA wouldn't have existed without slaves, Europe's wealth wouldn't have been there without colonialism and no industrial revolution would have been possible without coal or child labour.

The whole ""Flat earthers"" was fabricated specifically to cast doubt on historic science. It's a myth specifically for the purpose of which you are using it. Disinformation.     C02 causes warming to a degree. Humans emit c02. The climate is changing.     These things are not necessarily related. The climate is always changing. We have no evidence carbon is the primary driver as it has had little to no correlation in the past.

You can make certain-sounding claims about those feedbacks   I don't think I made them certain-sounding. I said they ""could be (and likely are)"", which is what the collective evidence shows. I base these views primarily on the IPCC synthesis reports, together with my own background in paleoclimatology which also supports a sensitivity on the order of 2-3 °C. Feedbacks within the system are of course not as well understood as simple energy-balance equations, but applying those equations to our situation and saying we can expect mild warming as a result is also clearly not realistic nor 'settled'.   Regarding 1°C being ""mild,"" it really is. We've seen 0.8°C warming since the low at the beginning of the 20th century. How much of that warming do you attribute to CO2 increases?   Thats the million-dollar question. Given my assumptions on climate sensitivity, my answer would be all of it. Of course, the warming signal is overlain by natural variability on various scales (AMO, PDO, ENSO, Volcanics, etc) which obscures the trend derived solely from radiative warming. Which is why I put my confidence in other lines of evidence (models, paleo data) than just looking at historical trends."
climateskeptics,3d7bs5,Gsacculifer,5,Tue Jul 14 21:50:28 2015 UTC,"Sensitivity of near-surface temperatures could be (and likely are) significantly higher.   That was disproven eighty years ago.  Greenhouse effect was not discovered in the eighties, it was both discovered and applied to global climate much earlier.  But, not only surface temps did not increase by 3-6 degrees C by the end of twentieth century, they actually went down during 1950x-1970s, when anthropogenic CO2 emissions were as high as ever.  The contemporary plateau (aka ""the pause"") merely reconfirms it.   Saying that 1°C warming is 'mild' is purely subjective, he hasn't implied anything like that at all.   Was he supposed to use the word 'beneficial'?  Because anything under 2 degrees is beneficial, I believe this is the official IPCC position expressed in one of the reports, though I would have to spend some time searching to find it."
climateskeptics,3d7bs5,claircontlar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:43:36 2015 UTC,"That was disproven eighty years ago.   Enlighten me please. Most estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity (2xCO2) are in the ballpark of 2 °C, which additionally agrees well with paleoclimate records. The latest IPCC report puts it in the range of 2 to 4.5 °C, with a most likely value of 3 °C. These refer to surface air temperatures.   Greenhouse effect was not discovered in the eighties, it was both discovered and applied to global climate much earlier.    Which is relevant because...?   But, not only surface temps did not increase by 3-6 degrees C by the end of twentieth century, they actually went down during 1950x-1970s, when anthropogenic CO2 emissions were as high as ever.   3-6 degrees? Where are you pulling these numbers from? Warming from CO2 doesn't rule out natural variability. Taking full length temperature records from 1880 to the present day (e.g. using Hadcrut4 or NASA gistemp), we've experienced about a 0.6-1 °C temperature rise (depending which points you want to pick). In that time CO2 has gone from approx 280 ppm to approx 400 ppm, or multiplied by a factor of 1.4. These values are again all consistent with an equilibrium climate sensitivity to a doubling of CO2 of around 2 °C.   Was he supposed to use the word 'beneficial'? Because anything under 2 degrees is beneficial, I believe this is the official IPCC position expressed in one of the reports, though I would have to spend some time searching to find it.   Yes, please find this. I want to know exactly where in the IPCC report it says that warming below 2 °C is beneficial. Given the nature of polar amplification (hell, the entire shift from the last ice age to the modern day only encompassed a 2 °C global temperature change), I would say that even 1 °C could respectfully be described as a problem, at least one that requires thorough investigation."

This is something we've learned relatively recently that prompts more questions.    Were our predecessors inherently aggressive towards the previous species? Possibly one of the main reasons for their extermination?     There was someone even prompting they might release a study indicating evolution was more localized, more occurring over the last 10,000 years than the ""hunter-gatherer"" stage, though I don't know if anything came of it.

We now know that humans and neaderthal's lived at the same time and actually lived together peacefully. There are some sub theories of evolution which suggest they aren't actually different species, just difference races of man during that time period.

I do realize that human produced aerosols affect the climate, so how much of the change in temperature in the last 20 years is due to human produced aerosols?  And, how much is due to land-use changes altering albedo?  You can feel free to include darkening of lands down wind of coal fired plants and forest fires when you calculate the temperature delta due to anthropogenic albedo change.  Then, how much climate change have we humans caused due to the increase in greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4)?  Now, since we know how much we've emitted, and what the temperature change has been, calculate exactly what the transient effect on climate we've had for a doubling of CO2.

Yes, because they know exactly how much the sun contributes, the variation in recent times, that the recent rise in temperatures doesn't correlate with the sun (while it does correlate prior to the 20th century), and that the contribution from co2 is far greater than the variation we can expect from the sun (eg in the same range as the last 1000+ years).  If you think all that equates to ""the sun has no bearing on temperature"" and ""the sun [does] not affect the climate?"", you either have a serious problem with language comprehension, or you're playing dumb on purpuse.

The study is about predicting the Sun’s SELF-activity. Their prediction, using a new idea for a model of how the sun works, shows a decrease in solar activity. The magnetic wave components of the sun, when in phase, can create strong solar activity. When they are out of phase, that results in low activity last seen in a time called the ‘Maunder minimum’. This occurred 370 years ago. At that time there were few sunspots noted and this coincided with a period of lower-than-average European temperatures.""  http://doubtfulnews.com/2015/07/mini-ice-age-headlines-are-misleading/  It's not good for science or discussions.

As a result of the decrease in solar irradiance, both experiments show widespread cooling with respect to CTRL-8.5 (Fig. 2). The relative annual global mean near-surface temperature change for the period 2050–2099 is a cooling of 0.13 and 0.12 °C for EXPT-A and EXPT-B, respectively. This offsets or delays the global warming trend by ~2 years and is small compared with the modelled global warming.  This  is  consistent  with  other  recently  published results, which indicate that any change in global mean temperature due to a future prolonged solar minimum would do little to substantially offset or delay the warming due to projected increases in long-lived greenhouse gases.   How do you decide which predictions stated by the same people on the same page are plausable, and which aren't? Also, what gave you the impression that the people predicting lower solar irradiance also predict lower global temperatures / a little ice age? Because among scientists, there's no question that a variation in the suns output on the order we've seen over the last millenia is not nearly enough to make up for the effect of CO2."

climateskeptics,3d4x2u,fantoman,11,Mon Jul 13 19:27:29 2015 UTC,"The paper specifically states consensus of Nobel laureates. Please show me where in the article it discusses meteorologists or climatologists to support your opinion.  :P       First off, the consensus itself is a disingenuous concept as it applies a blanket statement to a very complex field of study.     Does everyone agree it has warmed? Sure! Do we think mankind had some influence? Sure! Do we think mankind was the only influence? That it will have disastrous consequences? That carbon is without a doubt the primary driver with 0% uncertainty?     Likely no. So let's address where the concept of the ""consensus"" came from:     The United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) claims to represent more than 2,500 scientists who agree that man-made global warming is a serious problem. But this is misleading. While a total of 2,500 (or some similar number) scientists participate in some way in the writing or review of its reports, the IPCC’s working group responsible for assessing the causes of climate change and its future trajectory consists of only about 600 scientists, and many of those are activists working for environmental interest groups. For the Fourth Assessment Report, only 62 were responsible for reviewing the chapter that attributed climate change to man-made greenhouse gas emissions, with 55 of those being known advocates of the theory of man-made global warming. Of the seven impartial reviewers, two disagreed with the statement, leaving only five credible scientific reviewers who unequivocally endorse the IPCC’s conclusion, a far cry from 2,500.  In 2004, science historian Naomi Oreskes wrote an essay for the journal Science that examined abstracts from 928 papers reported by the Institute for Scientific Information database published in scientific journals from 1993 and 2003, using the key words “global climate change.” She concluded 75 percent of the abstracts either implicitly or explicitly supported the IPCC’s view that human activities are responsible for most of the observed warming over the previous 50 years while none directly dissented. Oreskes’ essay, which was not peer-reviewed, became the basis of a book (Merchants of Doubt)and an academic career built on claiming that global warming “skeptics” were a tiny minority within the scientific community. Her claim appeared in former Vice President Al Gore’s movie, An Inconvenient Truth.  Oreskes’ definition of consensus is silent on whether man-made climate change is dangerous or benign and her literature review inexplicably overlooked scores of articles by prominent global warming skeptics including John Christy, Sherwood Idso, Richard Lindzen, and Patrick Michaels. More than 1,300 such articles are now identified in an online bibliography at populartechnology.net.  Anthropologist Benny Peiser attempted to replicate Oreskes’ findings and found only one-third of the papers endorsed the alarmist view and only 1 percent did so explicitly. In 2008, medical researcher Klaus-Martin Schulte used the same database and search terms as Oreskes to examine papers published from 2004 to February 2007 and found fewer than half endorsed the “consensus” and only 7 percent did so explicitly. Schulte counted 31 papers (6 percent of the sample) that explicitly or implicitly rejected the “consensus.” Finally, Oreskes’ methodology assumes the abstracts of papers accurately reflect their findings, an assumption proven false by In-Uck Park et al. in research published in Nature in 2014.  In 2009, a paper by Doran and Zimmerman published in EOS claimed “97 percent of climate scientists agree” that mean global temperatures have risen since before the 1800s and that humans are a significant contributing factor. This study, too, has been debunked. The survey asked the wrong questions. Most scientists who are skeptical of catastrophic global warming also support those statements. The survey was silent on whether or not the human impact was large enough to constitute a problem or would cause a problem in the future. Moreover, the “97 percent” figure represents the views of only 79 of the 3,146 respondents who listed climate science as an area of expertise and said they published more than 50 percent of their recent peer-reviewed papers on climate change. This is not evidence of consensus.  In 2010, a paper by William Anderegg et al. published in Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences claimed “97–98 percent of climate researchers most actively publishing in the field support the tenets of ACC [anthropogenic climate change] outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.” Actually, the authors found that 97 to 98 percent of the most prolific 200 climate researchers (not necessarily scientists) say they believe “anthropogenic greenhouse gases have been responsible for ‘most’ of the ‘unequivocal’ warming of the Earth’s average global temperature over the second half of the 20th century.”  The views of 200 researchers out of the thousands of earth scientists who have contributed to the climate science debate is not evidence of consensus, and may instead be evidence of editorial bias in favor of a small clique of writers who have come to dominate the peer-review processes of science journals. Once again, the authors did not ask if authors believe global warming is a serious problem or if science is sufficiently established to be the basis for public policy. Anyone who cites this study as evidence of scientific support for such views is misrepresenting the paper.  In 2013, a paper by Cook et al. published in Environmental Research Letters claimed their review of the abstracts of peer-reviewed papers from 1991 to 2011 found 97 percent of those that stated a position explicitly or implicitly suggesting that human activity is responsible for some warming. This exercise in abstract counting doesn’t support the alarmist claim that climate change is both man-made and dangerous, and doesn’t even support the IPCC’s claim that a majority of global warming in the 20th century was man-made.  This study was quickly debunked by a paper by Legates et al. published in Science & Education. Legates et al. found “just 0.03 percent endorsement of the standard definition of consensus: that most warming since 1950 is anthropogenic.” They found “only 41 papers – 0.3 percent of all 11,944 abstracts or 1.0 percent of the 4,014 expressing an opinion, and not 97.1 percent – had been found to endorse the standard or quantitative hypothesis.” Scientists whose work questions the consensus, including Craig Idso, Nils-Axel Morner, Nicola Scafetta, and Nir J. Shaviv, protested that Cook misrepresented their work. Richard Tol, a lead author of the United Nations’ IPCC reports, said of the Cook report, “the sample of papers does not represent the literature. That is, the main finding of the paper is incorrect, invalid and unrepresentative.”  In striking contrast to these studies, which try but fail to find a consensus in support of the claim that global warming is man-made and dangerous, many authors and surveys have found disagreement and even a majority of scientists oppose the alleged consensus. Surveys by German scientists Dennis Bray and Hans von Storch have found that most scientists disagree with the consensus on key issues such as the reliability of climate data and computer models and do not believe key climate processes such as cloud formation and precipitation are adequately understood to predict future climate changes.     Even prominent “alarmists” in the climate change debate admit there is no consensus. Phil Jones, director of the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, when asked if the debate on climate change is over, told the BBC, “I don’t believe the vast majority of climate scientists think this. This is not my view.” Mike Hulme, also a professor at the University of East Anglia and a contributor to IPCC reports, wrote in 2009: “What is causing climate change? By how much is warming likely to accelerate? What level of warming is dangerous? - represent just three of a number of contested or uncertain areas of knowledge about climate change.”     As this summary makes apparent, there is no survey or study that supports the claim of a scientific consensus that global warming is both man-made and a problem, and ample evidence to the contrary. There is no scientific consensus on global warming."

climateskeptics,3d2f1a,kriegson,4,Sun Jul 12 23:54:10 2015 UTC,"I thought it might be pre-mature to discuss this idea, but in light of this article, I'll chime in.  I can see people arguing that a steady input from a source into a closed system will cause an increase, and the ocean's ability to absorb ever higher levels of CO2 may be falling.  A steady supply and falling ability to deal with it can certainly cause an increase in rate of CO2 concentration.    The fact that the increase in concentration seems to be very smooth and increasing at a very consistent rate, and has been from the very day we began good measurements in 1956.  Our emissions have not risen at a smooth, predictable rate, and it is puzzling why the atmospheric concentration is so smooth, given the vast differences in global emissions by man.  The US has been ""not growing"" since 2005, and in fact has fallen some from that time.  The EU has been ""not growing"" for even longer.  Many of the other Western Developed nations have also been either flat or falling in emissions over the last decade or so.   Now there are claims that China has had a massive decrease in CO2 emissions for at least the first 4 months of this year.  Not a small decrease, a massive one.  The news articles I read claimed that China emitted about the same amount of CO2 as the UK during those months, which, frankly, I have a lot of trouble believing.  But, regardless, even if the reduction is not that drastic, the claim is that they had reversed the growth of their emissions.  China, being the number 1 emitter on the planet with twice the emissions of the US, added to the lack of rapid increase of the US and the EU and Australia and Canada and Japan, should be a good test case to see if the change in globally averaged CO2 emission levels for the first, say 6 months of this year, show a drop in atmospheric CO2 levels.  If they do not, then how does anyone claim that our CO2 emissions are responsible for the increase?  If we can drastically lower our emissions, will it even effect the rate of increase in atmospheric CO2?"

So to anyone who is not logged in (i.e. the general ""lurker"" public), and/or is a rather ""new"" user, the effect would -- for all practical purposes -- be much the same as if the comments were [deleted], or in fact as if they had never even existed.  Yet for the ""expert"" users... it would be as if the mods were POWERLESS to actually ""remove"" comments.  And yeah, that kind of a system would create a somewhat ""weird"" two-tier conversation...

(Incidentally, I know of zero scientific bodies that say they accept the IPCC's estimate as gospel.)  What the IPCC said is that they think it is 95% likely that the majority of warming post 1950 is due to human causes.  So they are 95% sure that 50% or more of the warming from 1950 to now is due to all of mankind's impacts, not just CO2.  Keep in mind that AR5 was the same report where they reverted to a wider (and lower) range of ECS, and was also the report released before so many papers attributing the hiatus to natural variation came along.

For example, BP ""believes that climate change is an important long-term issue that justifies global action""-- hardly a ""denialist"" statement. Even President Obama recently admitted that not a single CEO he talks denies climate change, even those in the fossil fuel industry.

Taleb is so alarmist that he makes other Alarmists look reasonable.  I would say that he is a new Kaczynski but I'm not sure if Taleb is sincere or if he just enjoys the celebrity like Mann."

My position on the climate is to avoid releasing pollutants in the atmosphere, on the basis of ignorance, regardless of current expert opinion (climate experts, like banking risk managers, have failed us in the past in foreseeing long term damages and I cannot accept certainty in a certain class of nonlinear models). This is an extension of my general idea that one does not need rationalization with the use of complicated models (by fallible experts) to the edict: ""do not disturb a complex system"" since we do not know the consequences of our actions owing to complicated causal webs.

A very simple experiment is to put 4 weather stations out in a field close together and to continuously read their temperature outputs (eg. every 10 minutes) and to compare them. Then put a further 4 in more disparate locations and to compare them. Next determine the error margin and use this in the calculations.

I have been reading about this kind of hypothesis for a long time (a few years, at least) and it's on solid ground, as far as I can tell.  The reporting, however, leaves a lot to be desired.  People who don't read much past the headline are already losing their minds over the ""Denier claims that we're going into an ice age in 15 years.""    We won't know for a good long time whether the changes in the Sun's magnetic field has a tiny or a large effect on the Earth's temperature.  Those people who have been saying for decades that the TSI of the sun only varies by 0.1%, and changes in the solar magnetosphere have not had any appreciable effect on temperature over the last 150 years will either be vindicated or refuted only by the Earth's actual response to this change, and we're not going to know for, what? 25 more years?  If the sun's ""Grand Maximum"" was responsible for a good bit of warming over the last half of the 20th century, and the 26th cycle (not the next one coming up, but the one after) is truly equal to Maunder Minimum levels, we might see a drop of temperatures of half to three quarters of a degree over the next 100 years.  It won't happen over ""a decade"" as I've read some people suggest.  If not, well, the CO2 is in control people might have more evidence on their side.

I haven't grokked the above article enough to decide for myself whether it's crackpottery, or whether it's something already known, or if it points out something new.

FWIW, Clive Best has looked into a lot of this stuff and explains things pretty clearly:  http://clivebest.com/blog/?p=4432   The subtle point though is that it is only because the IR refractive index of the atmosphere is less than 1, that convection can start and be maintained at all. I think everything is linked together through one “atmosphere effect” which includes convection, latent heat and radiative transfer. So to discuss the “greenhouse effect” in isolation from convection and evaporation is wrong and so is discussing thermodynamic effects without including radiation.

For those who don't want to watch it, here's what happened:  A columnist for the Toronto Star, sort of Canada's version of the Guardian, I suppose, went to an anti-oil, well, anti-everything protest. Ezra was there interviewing people as a journalist.  The Star columnist called him over to talk to her 9 year old daughter, who she had put up to it.  Ezra had a quick conversation with the kid, and when the mom wasn't getting the reaction she wanted she stepped in herself.  Ezra (quite nicely) pointed out the many ways the mom was being hypocritical, and after awhile the conversation ended.  Then the mom wrote a column about the encounter in the Star. And lied about practically everything that happened. Not a little bit lied.  Basically fabricated the entire thing.  The only parts that were true were she went to this protest and Ezra talked to her and her daughter.  Everything else she basically made up.  Which was dumb, because Ezra filmed the whole thing.

Yes, Obama is delusional. But the thing is, so are the majority of those presently holding positions of authority in the West. It is actually dangerous to express a contrary opinion. The liberals are using cultural Marxism to disrupt and break down Western nations, so that they can rebuild them in their own image, and the new religion of manmade-global warming is one tool they are using to achieve their Marxist ends.

Because the science has never been proved. The science has not been worked, the scientific method has not been used. There is no scientific proof of human produced CO2 causing catastrophic global warming. And there is no scientific proof that human produced CO2 is at a significant amount compared to natural sources. Natural warming causes out-gassing of CO2 from the oceans. CO2 is plant food - we need plants to feed the poor, let alone everyone else.  Solar and wind power generation subsidises cause 15K deaths PA in the UK due to fuel poverty. Likewise biofuel growing in the 3rd. world causes deaths due to food poverty.  The Enlightenment, Democratic Capitalism, these produced our advanced, rich  and healthy modern world. It's important to ensure that these are working as best that they can. We've had a 500 year battle against feudalism. Feudalism is a disaster and always will be - whether it's communism, socialism, fascism or any other form. We can clearly see that in the last century and our current time.  The solution is to develop technologies that address the major issues of our current times :-  1) energy - yes, we do have a looming energy crisis, but the solution, in the main, is not solar or wind power (although these will be in the mix) but rather 2nd. and 3rd. generation nuclear eg. backyard reactors such as - slowpoke nuclear reactors , and thorium nuclear reactors. The issues are always going to be the costs of energy and their practical form. At the moment petroleum beats all other forms massively.  2) resources etc. - the ultimate direction has to be to develop interstellar travel. We have to be able to populate our solar system and other solar systems. We made massive advances over the last century. We can do so again."

Everything outside of ~ 4 giga parsecs is moving at exactly the speed of light( or faster) away from us right now(comoving distance).  Because space itself is expanding and acceleration, the amount of the universe where things are not moving faster then light away from us is getting smaller every second.  The speed of this expansion is Hubble's constant, and from any single point in space space itself it flying apart at 70.4 km/s per mega-parsec.  With the current future horizon at 4 giga parsecs, this future horizon is coming towards us at 281,600 km/s(nearly the speed of light) and at 8 giga parsec, its moving 563,200 km/s which is nearly 2x the speed of light, and thus unreachable.

Well, if the oceans warming by a couple of hundredths of a degree prevents the surface where we live from warming at all, then doesn't that invalidate the need for concern?  Can't we just say, ""yep, global warming is still happening, but it doesn't matter because all it means is that in 100 years, the oceans 300 meters down will be 0.2º warmer than today.  Who gives a shit about that?  No harm to anyone.""  Remember that a couple of tenths of warming, between 100 and 300 meters down will not harm corrals that live within 10 meters of the surface, won't melt ice in Greenland, won't cause insects to eat more trees, won't change the behavior of migrating birds, etc.  So, the fact that the oceans can and obviously do absorb a lot of the warming that they were so afraid of should cause them to adjust their temperature projections down by a great percentage, and every ""worry"" that they had based on projected temperature will be downgraded."
climateskeptics,3cv8ok,deck_hand,3,Sat Jul 11 13:02:49 2015 UTC,"The only ""Worry"" they have is funding and political support drying up.    Realistically if we take the atmospheric pause for granted, the surface pause is now accepted, and as you stated it's a few millionths of a degree in the great heatsink that is the ocean and the laws of thermodynamics mean it can't just ""jump out of the ocean"" suddenly, then yes there is absolutely no reason to even humor CAGW.      But again, there's that little weasel word, ""reason"". Right up there with ""logic"", ""Facts"" and ""observations"" as the warmists see it."

Meanwhile as I consider that we are actually going through a cooling part of a natural cycle I will make decisions on that basis. My only questions concern how much cooler we are going to get and over what period of time. Looking at the graph I would say a 6'C drop over a 35 year period, and that's a conservative estimate. Parts of the world - eg. SW of WA - are already down a couple of degrees."

climateskeptics,3cv8ok,kriegson,4,Sat Jul 11 13:11:34 2015 UTC,"The thing that I find very disturbing about the warmists is that they have this whole narrative that completely ignores scientific fact. It is a defining narrative for them that explains everything (as they consider it) - a religious truth. Even when the facts state the opposite they hold to the narrative and its explanations. I see otherwise intelligent people espousing all sorts of nonsense. And even more disturbing are the political ramifications - that in order to 'succeed' they have to toe the party line, even if that means that in their scientific and engineering professions that they produce disasters. So an engineer might design for global warming and produce a structure, an urban layout, an energy policy that is totally unable to handle global cooling. If we are cooling, and I think we are, that will produce a disastrous situation in northern Europe etc. . And if Europe is totally unprepared, which it will be going the way it is, it will be far worse.  Personally, for me, the place to be is Australia - a country that is better situated to handle the cooling temperatures - the populations can just move north. SW WA is definitely cooling - the evidence over the last couple of winters is clear. Perth is definitely cooler than 25 years ago - it never used to freeze, or go below zero, in winter."

climateskeptics,3cv8ok,kriegson,3,Sat Jul 11 14:00:50 2015 UTC,"PS: the maths are very simple - given the average temperature of the Earth at 16'C (+ 0.5 / -1.5) -> 289'K - then a 0.35% drop in output from the sun (100/289) produces a 1'C drop in temperature. So a simple chart of the output of the sun against the average temperatures should, obviously, show a causal relationship. The only short term factor that would effect it is cloud cover - cloud is an insulator. However over the long term this should not be a factor."

climateskeptics,3ctmho,FireFoxG,4,Fri Jul 10 20:29:14 2015 UTC,"this is a bit above and beyond the normal stupidity for the EPA.   That's actually rather hard to imagine (i.e. that their stupidity could get even worse, since the ""normal"" setting for EPA personnel {and really all government bureaucrats in high positions} is already so damnably low).    What I find rather ironically hilarious is this:    “If you’re asking me how much CO2 is in the atmosphere, not a percentage but how much, we have just reached levels of 400 parts per million,” McCarthy said, looking slightly annoyed with the lawmaker’s response.    Now the correct follow up would be to ask her to explain what ""parts per million"" meant... because she apparently doesn't have a clue; it's just a bit of jargon that she has memorized and is mindlessly regurgitating (because it's in the ""talking point memo"" her staff prepared for her). You could probably ask her if we couldn't just solve the problem by ""reversing the polarity"" -- and I'd bet dollars to doughnuts she'd get a ""deer in headlights"" look, and then sputter something about how she couldn't speak to that, and would have to look at the research and consult her experts.  By the way she DOES know (at least in terms of being another bit of ""jargon"") that CO2 it is a fraction of 1% -- but she doesn't want to admit or state that.  So in effect, she's lying (and everyone knows it).  But alas, that is par for the course for these kinds of things.    EDIT: Of course this is nothing unique to the EPA, nor just to government bureaucrats -- it is the kind of thing that is pervasive in nearly all aspects of our society, you can ""trip up"" probably well over 90% of people who are discussing ANY ""technical"" subject simply by asking them to explain what some term or number actually means (or likewise you can play ""buzzword bingo"" etc) ... most people really don't have a clue."

She clearly knows and clearly doesn't want to admit it makes up less then 1% of the atmosphere.   I do tend to think this is the case, but I wouldn't be greatly shocked to find that she simply DOESN'T comprehend the conceptual and is incapable of doing the math.

This points to the abysmal state of the educational system, and that the ""university"" system -- if we are honest -- never (ever, in any of its iterations) was actually successful at imparting the knowledge it claimed to.

The surface warming of the 00s is also substantially slower than the 90s, which warmed at a rate of +0.008°C/year.

climateskeptics,3crsb4,Zebramouse,6,Fri Jul 10 06:37:25 2015 UTC,"Our analysis indicates that during the most recent decade, cooling in the top 100 m layer of the Pacific Ocean is compensated by warming in the 100 to 300 m layer of the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans with the largest contribution in the tropics. The Southern Ocean plays a secondary role in warming the 100-300 m layer, but this warming is steady over both of the past decades. The Atlantic Ocean does show a switch from warming to cooling, but its area is so small that it cannot meaningfully con-tribute to the hiatus signal in surface temperature over the past decade.  Analysis of deep hydrographic data in comparison with satellite measurements of sea level change indicates a contribution of 0.76 mm/year of sea level rise due to thermal expansion within 700-2000 m. Assuming a thermal expansion coefficient of 1.3 × 10−4 °C−1 for that layer, this implies an average warming of 0.0045°C/year between the mid-90s and mid-00s and between 700 and 2000 m. The WOA pentadal estimate shows a heat content increase of 2.4 × 1021 J/year or about 0.0015°C/year (1993-2002 period, 700-2000 m layer). The latter is consistent with the 0.0013°C/year rate of warming for the 700-1500 m layer as measured by the Argo array in the 00s . Together, these findings suggest no significant increase in the rate of warming below 700 m since 2003.  JC comment:  In plain words, there doesn’t seem to be any observational evidence that Trenberth’s ‘missing heat’ is hiding below 700 m.      So not only does warming slow further according to this paper, but there is no missing heat hiding in the ocean either."

The ocean is a heat sink, and we have found no expansion (indicating deep sea heat) 2000M  according to other papers (can provide if you would like).      And yes, there was slowing of global warming. The paper itself says .08 last decade and .02 this decade if I recall.     The most relevant question as I see it however, is how the heat in the ocean (Cold reservoir) could end up having a significant impact on the surface and atmosphere (warm reservoir) considering that heat can't escape without an engine according to the second law of thermodynamics.     and    That we have a study concluding the sea level has averaged more or less the same sea level rise this century as the previous century, and it was rising twice as fast in the previous inter-glacial period.     Congrats, this paper backs warmists into a corner. All we need to do is prove the sea level rise is insignificant and that thermal dynamics prevent the heat from escaping. No catastrophe possible."
climateskeptics,3crsb4,kriegson,0,Fri Jul 10 15:00:53 2015 UTC,I don't know if I got all that from this. I do think the argument that warming ocean temperatures must equate to a corresponding rise in sea level is probably confounded by many complex systems. I think the obvious reaction to ocean heat can't escape is the ocean CO2 saturation discussion that always comes with global warming talk.
climateskeptics,3crsb4,SoCo_cpp,4,Fri Jul 10 15:16:31 2015 UTC,"But the ocean c02 budget has already been closed if I recall. I'll have to dig around a bit for it.     Ultimately though something is off if they claim they can determine the heat is in the ocean due to expansion (Though it's not causing any expansion below 2000m) and the net sea level has not risen any faster in the last 110 years regardless of carbon.      Sea level was rising twice as fast in the last inter glacial period, and we obviously don't have the excuse of man made carbon creating heat which gets stuck in the ocean."

As for the CO2 levels, the assumption is that the ocean has much more CO2 saturated in it ready to be released as ocean temperatures rise. There is a counter argument that the atmosphere is already saturated with CO2 and adding more will not increase warming, but that argument is very poor and decimated easily."
climateskeptics,3crsb4,SoCo_cpp,4,Fri Jul 10 15:41:34 2015 UTC,"Glaciers melt, retreat, reform constantly. Some are currently refusing to melt currently and we have record antarctic ice with arctic ice making a recovery (Can provide sources on both, not on hand currently).     At any rate, there doesn't appear to be any abnormal melting of glaciers.       There is a counter argument that the atmosphere is already saturated with CO2 and adding more will not increase warming      The argument that we've already reached 100% opacity in the atmosphere (where carbon is concerned) so essentially carbon is doing as much as it can?     I'm curious to see the counter argument on that one.     Also consider that previous time periods had higher temps and carbon, but carbon always lagged behind temp both in temps rising and carbon following and in temp falling and then carbon falling.     If carbon is simply an insulator that prevents energy from leaving, how does the energy start to leave before carbon does on a downward cycle? Especially with lag of a few hundred years? You can also see with stomata carbon reconstruction that the correlation between temp and carbon is very weak. Solar is the strongest and most consistent.      Also consider    CO2 flux into the atmosphere is really very small, only about 2.5% of which 83%, according to [1], is already absorbed by nature. This leaves only 0.4% of the total CO2 flux into the atmosphere that, supposedly, nature cannot deal with. Just 0.4%. Why nature can deal satisfactorily with 99.6% of the flux, but can't absorb this additional 0.4% is quite a puzzle."

There is quite a large layer of low pressure atmosphere in higher altitudes where very little of any kinds of gasses exist. This is all space that can be filled with a thicker layer of CO2 as long as the colder temperature up their allows such saturation levels, yet warming bellow should extend up making an endless upward route for more CO2.  CO2 has many complex cycles and its levels go up and down a lot, like seasonally with plant consumption, seasonal temperature shifts, ocean saturation changes, as well as tons of other causes. I don't think a lag in CO2 levels after temperature shifts seem too odd with all the different forces effecting it."

Why I take issue with the rhetoric/policy is we define the health of the earth as a likeness to what was for very narrow slice of time.

My experience, skills, morals, available tools, and humanity determine what I do about it.   You seem to want climate science to support specific policy actions on the devolving world, or what mitigating efforts are most cost effective and it simply cannot.

This is another false meme no where in the IPCC report. A vast majority of the scenarios they outline are ones of sustained economic growth. Why would you say the era of consumption is over?   1 A well-respected book, Climate Shock by Martin Weitzman of Harvard University, says that we have a small but non-negligible (5-10%) chance of these ""change of coastlines and vegetative climes"" occurring in the next 100 years or so. This jives with the IPCC. They outline many several emissions scenarios and all cases of globalization and growth/environmental focus contain 1.1 to 2 C warming outcomes where there are no major catastrophes. There are some scenarios with 800 ppm outcomes and the others are 600 and below. The IPCC says that a doubling CO2 (from here 800ppm) will add 1.5 to 4.5 C much of that range is non-dangerous warming. In my opinion, this is something to research, not panic over, and this certainly doesn't mandate, or end debate on, government subsidies to inefficient technologies or require a dissolution of sovereignty in order to mandate quotas on outputs in ever corner of the globe."

climateskeptics,3comwr,kriegson,3,Thu Jul 9 18:20:24 2015 UTC,"It's ruining trust in science. It won't be easy getting it back.   Well, the idea that ""science"" had some uber-sacred reputation...  Is really a bit of a farce. For the most part the ""trust in science"" was a relatively recent and short-lived aberrational thing -- mainly a post WWII & 1950's era phenomenon, built on top of probably 3 main legs:    the ""triumph"" of physic in the form of the Atomic bomb, and most specifically, the fact that this was seen as cutting short the Pacific Theater of WWII, especially the much dreaded ""invasion of Japan"" -- the emotional & psychological response to this on the part of servicemen (and their families) really cannot be overstated -- for many millions of men they felt something akin to the lifting of a death sentence, and being suddenly ""gifted"" the remainder of their life. The development & availability of antibiotics -- again the effects of this really cannot be overstated; it fundamentally altered medicine (especially surgery) and brought it out from what was essentially akin to dark ages ""magical"" gamble into a relatively low-risk, predictable & reliable profession (at least from the patient perspective relative to prior practice). the post WWII ""payoff"" of all the technological & industrial investment from the prior decades -- including everything from electrification to radio/television, the production of farm machinery, widespread availability of appliances with electric (and small gas) motors, etc -- again this almost cannot be overstated, and has to be understood in the context that for virtually an entire decade the lion's share of American industry had been almost entirely committed to war-goods-production; the ending of the war was akin to a proverbial ""dam"" breaking and the flood of life-altering consumer (and farm/commercial) goods was unprecedented.   The thing is of course, that most of that really had very little to do with what people think of as ""science"" -- most of it would be better placed under the label ""technology"" -- but the public's perception was what it was, mistaken or not (and one could argue mislead by poor journalism, and biased government propaganda, as well as certain political groups that continued to push ""science"" as a new authority meme to replace ""religion"" in terms of determining ethics, morality, etc {and arguably specifically to undermine and virtually eliminate ethical and moral constraints, but that is another subject}).  In other words, if you are imagining that ""science"" had some long history of being some kind of a pure & entirely unadulterated, wholly ""objective"" endeavor... well, I'm afraid you've bought into a propaganda myth; because there is no such long history of that, there is only the very brief decade+ little delusional ""nirvana"" that happened after WWII (I suppose you could argue that it persisted into the 1960's, and culminated with the Apollo moon landing, and in part that would be true, but in point of fact the reputation of ""science"" was already being damaged and beginning to crumble by the middle of the 1960's).    EDIT: And one work I often cite in regard to this -- that ""Science"" did NOT have a long untarnished history, but rather that it (like every other human endeavor) has been rife with corruption, fraud, hoax, political and economic distortions, etc -- is Charles Babbage's work titled: ""Reflections on the Decline of Science in England, and on Some of Its Causes"" -- and the key point is that it was written/published waaaay back in 1830. (And note he decries a ""decline"" of science, meaning he believed it had already peaked in terms of its reputation.)  Note for anyone who downloads it (previous link is to free ebook formats), or who reads it online, perhaps the most interesting bit is contained in Chapter V, Section 3 where he discusses the many and various forms of ""data fraud"" that so called ""scientists"" all too often practice; one would almost think that many of today's Climate ScientistsTM use that section as a handy guidebook, because they seem to utilize nearly every technique he derides."

Skeptics ideally should be somewhere in the middle. Not easy though when anyone who wants to discuss it from the alarmist side seems only to want to hurl abuse and logical fallacies.

climateskeptics,3comwr,UFGarvin,10,Thu Jul 9 17:03:01 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind this kind of a name-calling attack is NOT really aimed at the skeptics. Rather it is aimed at the ""minion"" masses, to wit:    At the end of the room a loud speaker projected from the wall. The Director walked up to it and pressed a switch. ""… all wear green,"" said a soft but very distinct voice, beginning in the middle of a sentence, ""and Delta Children wear khaki. Oh no, I don't want to play with Delta children. And Epsilons are still worse. They're too stupid to be able to read or write. Besides they wear black, which is such a beastly colour. I'm so glad I'm a Beta.""  There was a pause; then the voice began again. ""Alpha children wear grey. They work much harder than we do, because they're so frightfully clever. I'm really awfully glad I'm a Beta, because I don't work so hard. And then we are much better than the Gammas and Deltas. Gammas are stupid. They all wear green, and Delta children wear khaki. Oh no, I don't want to play with Delta children. And Epsilons are still worse. They're too stupid to be able …""  The Director pushed back the switch. The voice was silent. Only its thin ghost continued to mutter from beneath the eighty pillows.  ""They'll have that repeated forty or fifty times more before they wake; then again on Thursday, and again on Saturday. A hundred and twenty times three times a week for thirty months. After which they go on to a more advanced lesson.""  [Until] at last the child's mind is these suggestions, and the sum of the suggestions is the child's mind. And not the child's mind only. The adult's mind too—all his life long. The mind that judges and desires and decides—made up of these suggestions. But all these suggestions are our suggestions! **    Basically it comes down to getting people to (subconsciously) repeat: ""Skeptics are troglodytes, and they are ugly and evil; I'm glad I'm not a skeptic, because I don't want to be an evil ugly troglodyte.""  And so on, now it's a bit more sophisticated than that it isn't a single name/insinuation but rather a collection, indeed a host of such insinuations, all essentially baseless... often even using words that are meaningless* to the minions but which are spoken in a derogatory tone, manner and context that the implications of the term & the disparagement are clear.  All with the goal of course of ""herding"" the proverbial sheep.  *For example I'd be willing to bet that -- other than as some vague term of disparagement with negative image connotations, or as some ""monster"" in fantasy gaming -- not 1 in 100 people will be able to tell you what the term ""troglodyte"" actually refers to (i.e. the historical meaning & source of the word). In all probability Jerry Brown doesn't have a clue either (nor in all likelihood does his speechwriter).  ** EDIT: For those who don't recognize it, that's from Huxley's ""Brave New World"" -- a novel that I think a lot of people treat as a sort of ""guidebook""."

So the committed just see it, note how long it is, and move on, thinking the op has been well and truly rebutted.  Thing is, if you actually read them (don't, they literally make you stupider), these ""rebuttals"" are actually just giant walls of lies, misrepresentations, uncited assertions, strawmen and a variety of other fallacies. Totally gibberish, in other words.  Aside from just throwing around insults, it's his favourite tactic."

Got to the point he simply started saying ""I won't reply. Sorry"" or something to that degree.    Just point out the fallacy of his arguments, literally just the fallicy. EX: ""Ad hominem, ad hominem, strawman, strawman, Goal posting. You still didn't address point X"".        And he gets upset because you give him nothing to work with. Also demand evidence and don't give up on demanding it.

climateskeptics,3comwr,kriegson,5,Thu Jul 9 22:28:34 2015 UTC,"Once I figured out what he was about, my archiesmears tactics became as follows:  1) block him. That way I never have to see his moronic comments or be tempted to reply to them on the rare occasions I do see them.  2) insult him liberally and regularly.  Admittedly this is mostly for my own amusement, though a) he deserves it, and b) he can't resist ignoring it and gets all worked up into a lather, causing him to waste time stewing and commenting and generating walls of text that take him away from bullying other people and spreading climate propaganda for awhile. A worthwhile trade, I think, considering how little I care about whatever response he makes.  Only person I ever saw who had a chain more easily yanked was counters."

Prior to this is snowed in the Socal mountains in May, something that I don't recall happening for a very very long time.  Now I know the weather here is not representative of global weather, but lets look around a bit.  The great lakes still had ice in them around mid May, something that has not happened in some years.  Britain had one of it's coldest winters on record, and it snowed in Scotland just a day or two ago. This in spite of the report of a record hot day at Heathrow, although many Brits question that as they remember having a much warmer day a couple of decades ago.  Perth is setting record low temps as we speak.  Thousands of low temperature records fell this winter.

There was only one thermometer involved, and it was not inside a jar.   Glass is not transparent to CO2 (which is why Tyndall used rock-salt). Added to that, CO2 has no absorption bands in the short-wave infra red (SWIR) emitted by the heat lamp used. The contents of the jar was heated by convection and IR from the hot glass, and an increase in pressure at constant volume (PV = nRT).  Also see: [Peer reviewed] paper proves Bill Nye's faked 'greenhouse effect' experiment is also based on the wrong 'basic physics'   We argue here that great care is required in interpreting these demonstrations and, in particular, that for the case of the demonstration described by Lueddecke et al., the results arise primarily from processes related to convective heat transport that plays no role in climate change.""  [""Nye's experiment] demonstrates an entirely different phenomenon: The greater density of carbon dioxide compared to air reduces heat transfer by suppressing convective mixing with the ambient air.   They repeated the 'experiment' with argon, which has a similar density to CO2, but is not a greenhouse gas, and got almost identical results  http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TupUOEhzgZY/U-UZ3ioqewI/AAAAAAAAGKc/58V2YrjCWiQ/s1600/argonCO2.jpg"

They go with ""fad"" medicine for decades and then come out later and day, ""we were all wrong on this.. oh well.""  For decades, all medical people would tell you that one must drink 8 glasses of clear water per day.  There was a near 100% consensus.  Turns out that was never actually studied - it was just a poster that was created to put up on walls.  The medical professionals (Doctors all) read the poster growing up and assumed it was true.  When presented with a few correlations and some convincing dialog, people can be convinced of all kinds of things - especially if it fits in with their other prejudices.  ""We must (do the thing you want to do anyway) because if we don't (bad things will happen).""  It's an easy formula to gain consensus.  The trouble is, they take this to heart and begin over-reaching and drawing all kinds of other conclusions, ones not supported by any facts, and then arguing that anyone who doesn't believe those outlandish conclusions is either a) crazy or b) willfully lying for an ulterior motive.    If I say ""no, we're not going to see a rise of temperature of 5º C by the year 2050"" (an argument I actually had last year), dozens of true believers pile on and tell me that I'm a science denier.

climateskeptics,3cmb8w,Seele,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:34:53 2015 UTC,"""Facts"" in this case being talking points people have seen a million times.  Look, if you're out to get upvotes while making people aware of rational skepticism, it doesn't start with arguing over the 97% consensus.  Show people the RSS and UAH data from atmospheric readings, show them what kind of rate of change we've seen, and be honest about it.  Don't point to the tip top point in 1998's el nino event, then draw a line straight over and conclude no warming has occurred.    These tactics, they're so tired and worn out.  The absolute truth of the matter is there HAS been a slowdown in the past 20 years.  Temperatures have continued to rise, but not at the rate that we saw the past decades prior.  This is where skepticism should stem from on this subject.    When you fall into these arguments over things like that 30,000 person list, you're just one of literally MILLIONS of others who have said the same thing.  If that petition meant anything it wouldn't need to be brought up over and over."

Don't argue with emotion.  Second - the talking point that the 97% consensus came from a survey of 77 people is in itself dishonest.  You can see where the consensus is with http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/   Thirdly - That petition of 30,000 scientists includes veterinarians.  It does not consist of solely climate-related ""scientists"".  Finally - arguing over who has bigger lists of people who believe what is like arguing over which group should be allowed to tell you how to think.  Look at the data for yourself and draw your own conclusions.  Don't rely on some talking point to win an argument as if this is about picking sides.  There's genuine room for skepticism based on the data, so stick to that."

climateskeptics,3ckkdz,Will_Power,4,Thu Jul 9 16:12:59 2015 UTC,"More fresh water in the ocean SHOULD result in more sea ice   Two quick points on this:   Modelled projections showed less sea ice around Antarctica.  If you are correct, then those modellers missed something very basic. There's a paradox, if you are correct.  Land ice from Greenland and other sources in the Arctic circle has melted, but sea ice is decreasing.  It's the opposite in the Antarctic.     Together, these suggest a more complex interaction between melting land ice and sea ice than you suggest.   Ice that has survived hundreds of thousands of summers is melting.   Let's delve into that as well.  Most of the last 125,000 years has been a glacial period, so of course any glacial melt in the last 10,000 years should be greater than the 115,000 years prior.  If you go back more than about 125,000 years, you are into the previous interglacial.  Sea levels were some 20 feet higher during that one than they are now, suggesting far more land ice melted then than has melted during the present interglacial.  So I'm not sure your claim is true.  Edit: fixed wrong unit of measure."

The AGW remediation movement has become a new religion for people to latch onto and worry about.  It gives their life some sense of meaning.  Previously people worried about going to hell or sinning and they were happy they could repent each sunday. Now they are worried about the apocalypse of a 2 degree celcius increase and they are happy to repent by destroying economies and lobbying to move to renewables with government funding.  The other argument that crops up frequently is that Australia's per capita emissions are higher than anyone else's but they fail to account for the fact that Australia's emissions make up less than 1% of the global total so our impact is negligable."

Seriously, right away you start off with the ""no warming since 1998"" fallacy.  Why do that?  Let's be honest about what that is.  There was an El Nino event.  If you move the starting point forward a year or backwards two years, the upward trend returns.    Here's the thing though - that upward trend is well below what we experienced in the past few decades.  THAT is the slowdown.  There was never any true pause, but people like you claim there is by drawing a straight line from the top of the highest point in 1998 to where we are now.  Isn't it odd we're averaging temperatures today that were once considered the peak of an El Nino event?  Think about that.  There has been a slow down.  Point people to the RSS and UAH data on the troposphere as well as the stratosphere.  The stratosphere is continuing to cool and the troposphere is continuing to warm, but not at the rate predicted.  Seeing that and deciding we could be jumping the gun in declaring how warm things will get, THAT'S TRUE SKEPTICISM.  That's what we need out there.   Stop posting regurgitated denier blog spam.  That guy who pointed out how wrong you were on there being only 30-something percent consensus, he deserves a response from you.   He refuted your claim entirely and pointed out how erroneous it is and you said NOTHING.  Don't put out a bunch of statements like that then run away when someone proves you wrong, stand up, be a fucking adult and admit you made a mistake and move on.

The government last month also said it plans to cut-off new onshore wind farms from a subsidy program a year early.  “We’re suddenly looking at a substantial amount of lost income for clean energy companies which was totally unexpected,” Gordon Edge, director of policy for RenewableUK, an industry lobby group, said. “For example, Levy Exemption Certificates account for just over 6 percent of onshore wind generators’ revenues,” he said.

Summer cooling is no more damaging to the climate than the heating that we do in winter. In fact, it’s substantially less so, since the United States burns more fuel on radiators than it does on air conditioners. According to the most recent stats available from the federal government (which cover 2010), the average American household puts 40.4 million British thermal units into home heating, and just 9.3 million BTUs into home cooling. As I’ve pointed out before, this explains why the long-term shift in population from our coldest, Northern states into the hot and humid South has in sum reduced the amount of fossil fuel we burn to keep our houses at a comfortable temperature. Simply put: It’s more efficient to air-condition homes in Florida than it is to warm the ones in Minnesota."

The design is relatively standard: no worse than many papers in the field. The implementation is still very poor (see for example the discussion at our post on satisficing), but it’s not so bad as to render the data completely useless.

climateskeptics,3cjjwb,LWRellim,3,Fri Jul 10 07:03:35 2015 UTC,"It's a scam, probably one of the biggest in history, But the amount of money you can make is astounding.   Actually it's a whole shitload of scams -- the latest being the ""leasing"" thing -- which is chiefly a back-end financial scam akin to the subprime & MBS stuff.  Increasing numbers of properties are being ""encumbered"" by these things, which the owners often unwittingly agree to, unaware of the impact it has on the property value, the potential liens and other problems it creates, etc.  Even in ""sunny"" places like California and Arizona (where given the high utility rates solar is almost practical), well:    https://www.biggerpockets.com/forums/88/topics/81206-buying-a-home-with-a-solar-lease-agreement http://www.pirate4x4.com/forum/general-chit-chat/1059763-foreclosure-w-56k-solar-lien.html     The thing is that for most homeowners, any and all of this is really pretty ""insane"" from a financial perspective.  Even in the cold of the upper midwest, a moderate sized home, with average/typical insulation, well if you engage in any kind of ""conscious"" energy conservation (by which I mean you're not flagrantly cranking the heat up to insane temps in the winter, forcing the AC to turn your house into a virtual refrigerator in the summer, and aren't leaving lights on all over the house) -- then your average total utility bill (electric AND fuel-heat) should be somewhere UNDER $150 a month, that's only $1800 a year. Even IF the grid-tie-solar were able to eliminate 100% of the kWh costs, that would probably only reduce the monthly bill by about $50 ($600 per year)... the system simply WILL not produce a positive ROI (not even if it were to actually keep functioning for the ostensible 20~25 year ""lifespan"").  In point of fact nearly all of the promoted/promised ""savings"" or ""return"" is based on rather dubious calculations of regular & high, steady increases in future grid-based energy costs continuing across the entire 20+ year lifespan, with the majority, if not all of the ""savings"" coming from the few years at the end of the lifespan (and even then only present due to the exponential nature of the projections). If any of those assumptions is wrong (if energy costs don't increase, if the system requires ANY unaccounted for maintenance, if the lifespan is ""short"" by a few years, etc) -- then the ""numbers"" and the ""savings"" and purported ROI of the whole equation simply vanish -- back in to the thin air they were pulled from.  The reality is that the entire industry is built on ""upfront"" financial shenanigans, mostly government subsidies, but generally also some maintenance lease or contract (which they sell off as a cash-flow asset) -- and even more so on the gullibility & innumeracy of the typical homeowner -- they then do a quick/shitty installation and leave the homeowner with what all too often becomes a non-functioning ""white elephant"" on their roof, and a contractual agreement for a decade to two decades of payments that they are locked in to via a superior/pre-eminent lien on their property (and the homeowner will be lucky if they didn't damage the structure and/or create holes/leaks that will eventually destroy the home -- nor is that to mention the fact that the quagmire of the lease/encumbrance will likely reduce the value of the home even further)."

The IPCC (along with every other major scientific institution) is responding to the reality that there is this accumulation of data and scientific models that converge to come to a very consistent conclusion (albeit not 100%): climate change is occurring at an accelerated rate and it's man-made. So they are using their knowledge of and faith in the scientific method here to determine that this is something that has strong enough evidence to confirm as a problem. This makes it a bit confusing when a guy like this rejects the funeral consensus of course.

climateskeptics,3cfxtb,misterbinny,-4,Wed Jul 8 04:51:19 2015 UTC,"Dont worry, i don't see myself coming back.  I will leave you all with this one simple thought.  The earths climate is a system. The conditions of this system depend on what is present within the system. I am reffering to greenhouse gases. Water, co2, methane, nitrous oxide, and so on.  Now think about a pot of water you want to boil (the system). If you add salt (a lot of salt) you can effectively change the boiling point of the water. While the water would begin to boil anyway when heat is applied, the addition of the salt has changed to conditions of the system which results in an altered boiling point.  By burning fuels (among other things), we are releasing GHG (salt) into our atmosphere (pot of water). We are changing the conditions of the system and I'm sure I dont need to go any further.  EVERY ACTION HAS A REACTION.  The great thing about the scientific community is that it regulates itself. When a paper or piece of research is released, it is essentially thrown into the fighting pit where every scholar in the world can read, review, critique, and come out for/against the findings. If there is a bad apple out there, you can be sure that eventually it will be removed from the bunch (see vaccines and autism) I like to think of it as natural selection but instead of species we have papers. A researchers reputation rests on the factualy correct substance of their work. If manmade global warming was really a hoax, the larger scientific community would already have ripped it to shreds by now.   Slam me with your misguided vitriol, I could give a shit (and i wont respond, ive already wasted enough time here). I just hope that among you, there are skeptical skeptics that will read this and understand that this really is just basic science, there is no veil of secrecy or subterfuge.  TL;DR - earth is a system, we are changing the conditions of that system.  edit: chemistry lulz"
climateskeptics,3cfxtb,dilpickle98,4,Wed Jul 8 17:49:58 2015 UTC,"I find a distinction between how things are supposed to work and how they actually work. You mentioned ""The great thing about the scientific community is that it regulates itself. When a paper or piece of research is released, it is essentially thrown into the fighting pit where every scholar in the world can read, review, critique, and come out for/against the findings."" A fantastic idea in theory. A while ago there was an article on reddit regarding repeatability; I remember getting chastised for criticizing the fact that experiments were not typically repeated for validation. The typical response was ""why would anyone need to repeat experiments for validation, as this would be a waste of money and the experiment had demonstrated what it was supposed to."" It is my opinion that this is a common as reviewers of articles already have enough to do and not necessarily a budget to repeat experiments. The group of people publishing articles likewise wouldn't want to waste their research money retreading paths in exactly the same manner as those have already been blazed. If reviewers aren't verifying experimental results then what exactly are they doing?  Well they would be verifying the experiment had been conducted correctly and the reasoning in the article was logically consistent. There is some evidence to suggest that this doesn't always happen. From Wikipedia:   The Sokal affair, also called the Sokal hoax,[1] was a publishing hoax perpetrated by Alan Sokal, a physics professor at New York University and University College London. In 1996, Sokal submitted an article to Social Text, an academic journal of postmodern cultural studies. The submission was an experiment to test the journal's intellectual rigor and, specifically, to investigate whether ""a leading North American journal of cultural studies – whose editorial collective includes such luminaries as Fredric Jameson and Andrew Ross – [would] publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions""  Another article describes how a fake cancer study was published in hundreds of journals here:  http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131003-bohannon-science-spoof-open-access-peer-review-cancer/  Although the examples above were either largely not from the world of physical science or included open access journals they still serve to illustrate that simply because a study was published in a peer reviewed venue it may still not meet any acceptable standards of what the peer review process was designed for.  This would suggest that sometimes the people who are reviewing journal articles don't understand the content of what they are reviewing or have some other motives. A proper scientific journal requires oversight, or testing of the reviewers.  Jury Duty is another (albeit less relevant) example of the discrepancy between how things actually work versus how they were meant to work.  Having examined the evidence the 12 jurors are supposed to come to a unanimous decision beyond a reasonable doubt as to whether the the defendant is guilty or not guilty while following the directions given by the judge according to the trial, but not every juror pays attention during the trial. What does jury duty have to do with the peer review process?  Well, considering that people will invariably have human traits, they are susceptible to them; the peer review process only works if the people doing the peer review are doing so within the confines of review protocols.   Finally peer review requires checks and balances. A system of checks and balances takes into account our human foibles and attempts to account for them much the same way negative feedback works in AWG theory.  And second finally (can we do ""second finallys?"" Well, whatever, here is a second finally.) The sheer amount of equivocation and presupposition coming from the AGW camp only makes the moderate skeptics more suspicious. When AGW proponents say things like ""If manmade global warming was really a hoax, the larger scientific community would already have ripped it to shreds by now"" they are saying that skeptics think AGW is a hoax. When AGW proponents say ""Deniers think the temperature of the earth hasn't risen, or that it doesn't change"" they are saying that skeptics think the temperature of the earth has remained constant when clearly the evidence shows otherwise. Confounding ""AGW Theory"" with ""Global mean temperature"" is the most duplicitous mendacity. The argument being ""The temperature of the earth has changed THEREFORE AGW theory is correct."" If you disagree that AGW Theory is correct, the AGW proponent naturally points to ""So you deny the temperature of the earth has changed."" In fact the misdirection here is so nefarious that it really does deserve to be given its own name in the list of common fallacies. The premise is supported by the science, but the conclusion has yet to be demonstrated.  TL;DR - Just because something is called ""Peer Reviewed"" doesn't actually mean it is peer reviewed."

This is interesting to me. I had not thought of someone being a moderate skeptic, as you seem to describe. Perhaps I should rethink what the word skeptic means to me. This is r/climateskeptics..... not r/climatedeniers.  I just finished up a stint at an energy research lab/office. I literally never heard climate change even mentioned because its simply, to us and A LOT of people, a fact. This fact drives our reasearch and accompanying work (with the goal of de-carbonization).

climateskeptics,3cfsbp,nallen,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:32:56 2015 UTC,"The concern that started the whole thing is with a surfactant called SLS, sodium lauryl sulfate, which is in a lot of things.  It's a strong surfactant, and some people are sensitive to it, although most people don't notice.   It will ""dry out"" your skin, which in this instance is a touch misleading becuase it's not removing water, it's removing the stearic acid (which is similar to wax) from your skin.  Without the oily layer in your skin, moisture escapes, and your skin gets flaky.   In order for SLS to do this, it has to get into your skin, the micelle formed by SLS is quite smaller, and it can slip into the pores, for some people this is worse than others.  Another surfactant, SLES, sodium laureth sulfate, is similar in structure, but it has a few ethylene oxide units between the carbon chain and the sulfate group.  It turns out this is hugely important to the irritation profile.  Those groups make the micelle of the SLES much bigger, and they don't enter the skin nearly as much, hence they are far less irritating.  Now, SLES doesn't foam as well, adn people like foam, even though it has nothing to do with cleaning.  So to increase foam in SLES shampoos, some companies add SLS or Cocoamidylpropyl betaine, which is a foaming agent (it's glorified coconut oil, all of these things are.)  As it turns out, the SLES and betaine conbine to make the shampoo even less irritating, depending on the ""sulfate-free"" shampoo, it may be significantly less irritating that the sulfate-free (this is the case if the shampoo uses an alpha-olefin sulfonate surfactant.)  So there is not problem with SLES, but it's a ""sulfate"" so now people think it's terrible...even though they don't know why. It's fine, unless you're a statistically trivial group that has unusual sensitivity, then you should not care."

Based on what I've read in these comments, I think it would be correct to say that you did benefit from an effort to use an existing product for carbon capture four years ago.    I think we can look at /u/climate_control's original statement based on that:   If you no longer work on any projects that are related to climate policy, then he was incorrect to say ""profits"" in the present tense.  ""Profited"" would have indicated past projects. Does ""benefitted"" equate to ""profited""?  I don't think the intent of the statement was the strict accounting definition.  That's why I asked if you gained equity or invested money in a venture dedicated to developing carbon capture.  I think the common usage of ""profited"" can include one's salary."

When a user strays from such decorum, they are kindly warned and, if necessary, the comment is removed...   Unless you're Archiesmears or nuclear-is-atomic-outspokenskeptic or basically anyone throwing around epithets and insults at ""deniers"". Those comments are fine.   Instead of the reasoned and civil conversations that arise in most threads, when it came to climate change the comment sections became a battleground... On one side, deniers accused any of the hard-working scientists whose research supported and furthered our understanding of man-made climate change of being bought by “Big Green.” On the other side, deniers were frequently insulted and accused of being paid to comment on reddit by “Big Oil.”... After some time interacting with the regular denier posters, it became clear that they could not or would not improve their demeanor.   One doesn't fail to note that you singled out poor behaviour from two sides... and then went on to say only one of those sides was actually a problem.   ...it became clear to me that the contrarians were not capable of providing the science to support their “skepticism” on climate change. The evidence simply does not exist to justify continued denial that climate change is caused by humans and will be bad. (my bold)   That's a pretty definitive statement considering both the large role natural variability obviously plays and the fact that even the IPCC says the net benefits of warming will outweigh any potential future problems for decades to come. Never mind that decades of time to prepare for potential ""bad"" allows a lot of time for mitigation. I mean, unless you've developed a time machine and can prove what you've said there.   When 97 percent of climate scientists agree that man is changing the climate, we would hope the comments would at least acknowledge if not reflect such widespread consensus. Since that was not the case, we needed more than just an ad hoc approach to correct the situation.   In other words, based on some of the most flawed, cherry picked studies ever done, you decided it was time to start censoring ""deniers""   When a potentially controversial submission was posted, a warning would be issued stating the rules for comments (most importantly that your comment isn’t a conspiracy theory) and advising that further violations of the rules could result in the commenter being banned from the forum.   Which is, of course, a flat out lie. Many, many people are instantly shadow banned, without warning, for not towing you line.   like our commenters, their rejection of climate science is not based on an accurate understanding of the science but on political preferences and personality.

That's it. If you look at decadal (meaning, 1990's were cooler than the 2000's decade, which are cooler than the 2010's decade, etc), or if you use actual math and draw trend lines over the entire data sets, you see warming.

climateskeptics,3cfja1,Florinator,8,Tue Jul 7 20:17:31 2015 UTC,"Take for example his claim that there's been no warming for 20 years. The only way one can deduce this claim is if you take a single slice out of RSS or UAH satellite readings from 1998 onward.       Well yes, most claims of no significant warming for 20 years would be best served by taking 20 years of the best global temp data measuring where GHG would be warming the planet if GHG was indeed exponentially warming the planet.   Of course you can also go by NOAA's USCNH, USCRN for some land temps with interesting results. USCRN was created recently for measuring the climate specifically with stations placed where development was not expected for 50-100 years, so virtually no adjustments needed.   Even the IPCC agrees that the ""Hiatus"" exists. The simple reality of the situation is that if carbon heated the planet exponentially, we would be experiencing exponential heat. Instead as the fellow points out we have not seen said heat. And we have only seen further predictions of less climate sensitivity as we continue to fall short on projection after projection.   That's excluding oceanic warming.     Karl Et al 2015 I assume?      But if you want to claim skeptics are taking data out of context, surely you must understand the hypocrisy of claiming purely human driven climate with hundreds oh wait, Thousands of years where climate and temps have risen and fallen entirely without human intervention, and the vast majority of the time heat follows carbon and not vice versa?     If carbon were an insulator with a massive affect on the climate, why do we see temp dropping for hundreds of years in some cases before carbon follows suite?       denier      Last and least, this old strawman. Do you understand how you undermine your own argument with this word? Like throwing accusations of ""Racist!"" or ""sexist!"" at someone at an argument.

It was the governments that requested the IPCC say something about the warming hiatus, because I'm sure otherwise the IPCC would have happily ignored it. That's how the IPCC works, they vote on which papers get included in their reports and which don't. Those that are incovenient truths, pardon my pun, get left out. There is plenty of peer reviewed research that shows that mankind may not be the biggest climate change driver.  I don't know if you are familiar with climate-gate, these are the very words of professor Phil Jones from East Anglia University:   “I can’t see either of these papers being in the next IPCC report. Kevin and I will keep them out somehow — even if we have to redefine what the peer-review literature is!”"
climateskeptics,3cfja1,Will_Power,-1,Wed Jul 8 22:37:51 2015 UTC,"Well yes, most claims of no significant warming for 20 years would be best served by taking 20 years of the best global temp data measuring where GHG would be warming the planet if GHG was indeed exponentially warming the planet.   That's the problem, right? Why arbitrarily take 1998? Take 1999, 1997, or literally any other year from the temperature record, and you see warming. Again, let me repeat: the only way you get ""no warming"" is if you use only lower troposphere temperatures captured via satellites and draw a straight line from 1998 onwards. That's it. Literally. There's one way to get no warming, and countless ways to demonstrate warming. What you're doing is literally the definition of cherry picking.  Secondly, who said the Earth's sensitivity to CO2 was exponential? I can't find any scientific organization that's argued for exponential temperature increases.    Of course you can also go by NOAA's USCNH, USCRN for some land temps with interesting results.   I'm not sure if you're trying to pull a fast one, or if you're just unaware, but those are for surface temperatures in the US only. Why would anyone draw conclusions about the globe from surface-only temperatures when 99% of the Earth's heat content is contained elsewhere (the rest of the land + oceans). That's very very strange.   Even the IPCC agrees that the ""Hiatus"" exists.   Again, I'm not sure if you're trying to pull a fast one, or if you're just unaware, but ""hiatus"" speaks about the rate of acceleration of the warming. It doesn't speak about the warming itself.    But if you want to claim skeptics are taking data out of context, surely you must understand the hypocrisy of claiming purely human driven climate with hundreds oh wait, Thousands of years where climate and temps have risen and fallen entirely without human intervention, and the vast majority of the time heat follows carbon and not vice versa?   That's not a very good argument. People can cause things that traditionally have been done by nature. Fires were started by nature before humans figured out how to start them. Animals died naturally before people hunted them. Following your train of thought, we couldn't possibly kill animals because animals have died for thousands of years without humans.   What you're conflating here is Earth coming out of an ice-age due fluctuations in the Earth's orbit. This increase in temperatures is what causes CO2 to be released from the oceans. In fact, CO2 concentrations in the oceans decrease during this period. Tons of work has shown that ocean CO2 levels are increasing.    Karl Et al 2015 I assume?   Terrible source for ocean warming. Do you know the difference between the ocean and the Earth's surface?   Last and least, this old strawman. Do you understand how you undermine your own argument with this word?   Well, it seems from this discussion that you do deny that 1) land temperatures are increasing; 2) ocean temperatures are increasing; 3) CO2 is a greenhouse gas; 4) oceans are absorbing CO2; and 5) the term ""hiatus"" speaks about warming all together, and not just the acceleration of warming.

But you appear to be implying that again, I said absolutely no warming or something to that degree. The hiatus can only be accurate as a description if it starts warming again in a verifiable trend that correlates with carbon.  Until then, it's not a hiatus.      Tons of work has shown that ocean CO2 levels are increasing.      Never said they aren't. Again, if carbon increases exponentially why aren't we seeing significant warming?         I'm not sure if you're trying to pull a fast one...     If you are proclaiming the the world is warming towards a catacylsm and an entire region of it is not, that data is significant. Unless you are presuming that north america resides in some kind of climate bubble seperate from the rest of the world? (That would be a strawman :D)   Terrible source for ocean warming.      Karl Et Al 2015 uses large revisions to SST data, the article I referred you to was the various problems evident in carl et al 2015 and SST data in general that assume the oceans are now holding the hiatus heat as opposed to the troposphere where it cannot be found.       At any rate, yes the sat data and 20 year trend still stands irrefutable evidence that CAGW is not as simple or as settled as some think. As I said earlier if CAGW believers proclaim that we are rapidly accelerating to 2C or higher but the temperature where it should be the most significantly affected has simply stopped, that indicates that their hypothesis was incorrect and it's time to go back to the drawing board.      Instead we see an ideology of warming proclaiming that the discussion is over and anyone that disagrees is a denier."

The Tesla will out perform the Mercedes in every empirical measure you want to name, with the possible exception of driving a very long distance trip.  For 95% of one's driving, however, the ~300 mile range of a Tesla is way more than adequate.  Now, if you want to talk about vehicles that are not in the Mercedes super-luxury class, then take a look at my car.  It's a Nissan Leaf, and I get about 100 miles of range on a charge.  I can charge from dead to full in a little over 40 minutes, or from a more normal 20% to 80% in about 20 minutes.  No, it's not as quick as filling a gas tank, but it's not too damn far off of it, either.  Most of my driving is less than 40 miles a day, with the occasional day of 150 miles.  This means that most days, I unplug it in the morning, and plug it back up when I get home, and don't even think about it.  On the days where I drive 4 times more than usual?  If I'm out the whole time, I'll stop by somewhere and top off at some point in the middle of the day.  If I come home during part of that time, I plug in while I'm eating lunch, or mowing the grass, or watching a TV show, or whatever I'm doing that isn't driving.  No, issues, no worries, no shouting ""this car sucks!""  The 2017 Nissan Leaf is rumored to have an upgrade to a 310 mile range, which means that long trips will be no problem at all.  I would be able to drive for, say 200 miles, pull in and eat lunch, then drive another several hours, take a break while the car charges, and then go some more.  Easy, and very, very possible.  Long trips are on the table.  And all this for way, way less than $100,000."

I personally think that we should use the correct tool for the job, not try to use one tool for every purpose.  I live in a house with 4 adults (well, two old adults and two young ones), and we have three automobiles and a motorcycle.  We have, oh, hell, 6 bicycles I think, because the kids out grow some, and I have both a regular bicycle and a recumbent for myself.  Oh, and a folding bike that I bought second hand to take in the camper.    We live a pretty active lifestyle, or at least we used to before I had to work all the damn time.  Going and doing, camping, caving, water sports, riding bicycles, sailing, etc. all require gear, and fairly often I have to pull a utility trailer of some sort.  Also, I've had a 4 wheel drive vehicle of some sort since about 1984 and would not know what to do without one.  I go so many places with bad roads or across muddy dirt fields, etc. that I have to have it, or I'd constantly be stuck somewhere.  On the other hand, our daily driver these days is the Nissan Leaf.  It's small, quick, smooth and lots of fun to drive.  I plug it in at night, and have plenty of juice to do the vast majority of our running about the next day, unless we're doing something like going to the lake, or going camping.  It is used for well over half of the miles I or my wife drive.  It costs me about $10 per month in electricity.  Would I have it for my only vehicle?  No, because it is not suited for all purposes that I need a vehicle to perform.  But, it's the perfect ""other car"" that gets used all the time.    ON the subject of whether I would pay $100 thousand for a Tesla...  only if I were rich enough that I didn't mind spending $100K on a car.  It's a top end luxury sports car, and one that doesn't appeal to everyone.  Some people like to hear and feel the roar of the engine, and I fully understand that.  Generally speaking, if I were rich, I would probably have a whole warehouse full of vehicles, from huge trucks to an insane top end bike to an old-school muscle car, and yes, a slick, powerful electric Tesla.  Since I'm not rich, I can't justify the extra money that a Tesla costs, any more than I can justify spending $100,000 on a top end gas powered sports car.   Since you're one who seems to like the idea of hearing the engine sing, a Tesla might not be a good choice for you, and that's okay.  Notice that I didn't tell you what a horrible person you are for not lusting after the Tesla?  I just pointed out that it was not a golf-cart with a 30 mile range.  It's a luxury electric rocket with lots of power and speed.  My Leaf isn't a rocket, but it's got more acceleration than my Jeep does (to your comment about taking off at a red light).  Still, it seems that many people who are not taken in by the climate armegeddon scare stories tend to be opposed to all things that the other side is proposing as good.  They (maybe you? I'm not sure) hate the very idea of an electric car, a solar panel, a wind turbine, bicycling at any point, etc.  I'm not sure why that is.  I can enjoy a bicycle for what it is, and still like riding a massive Harley.  I don't have to hate bicycles because they don't sound like thunder when they go by.  Again, instead of embracing a single tool for all purposes, learn to appreciate each tool for its designed purpose. You might not like to ride bicycles at all.  No skin off my nose.  I'm not forcing you to."

Credit goes to /u/fooljoe for this summary explaining the problems:  Established tools, like the EPA's fueleconomy.gov, are completely at odds with the conclusions of this study. Checking that site, we can see that even in North Dakota, which is cited in the study as the worst place for EVs, the Nissan Leaf has roughly half the emissions of the average new car (250 vs. 480 g CO2 / mile.)  The reason for the disparity is a gaping hole in the NBER study: they completely ignore upstream (i.e. refinery) emissions from gasoline. Considering that it takes about the same amount of energy to refine a gallon of gas as it takes to power an EV the ~25 miles that gallon will take the average car, it's easy to see how such a glaring omission will bias the results.  Here's another highly questionable assumption of the study: Looking at the supplementary appendix, we see in Appendix D a table of electric vehicles and their gasoline ""equivalents"". In most cases the choices seem to make sense, for example the Honda Fit EV is compared against the gas version of the Honda Fit. However, we see that the Nissan Leaf is compared against the Toyota Prius! It's a rather ""interesting"" assumption to cherry pick the most efficient gasoline vehicle on the roads (and an ""alternative"" type of vehicle in its own right) against the most popular EV, which will of course dominate the results."

Many new open-access publishers simply charge fees and have no substantial review process in place which leads to all kinds of pseudo-science being published.  When considering the quality and legitimacy of open-access journals, it would be wise to consider checking first with the Directory of Open Access Journals. Those which are registered and verified (they have to meet a number of specific criteria) with the DOAJ are likely (but not always) more trustworthy than those which are not. ""Atmospheric and Climate Sciences"" is not registered with DOAJ. It would also be worth checking if they are a registered member of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) or Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA).

An analogy:   Conventional fluid mechanics theory very strongly predicts that dumping a bottle of water into lake Michigan will increase the rate of flow over Niagra Falls.

Without either of those, the AGW theory would be and should be completely dead.    I'm not saying that the Stephen-Boltzmann equations for Co2/watervapor/methane/etc IR induced heating are wrong(aka greenhouse effect).  Only that increasing the concentrations once we hit full opacity of the atmospheric window will not add more heating.  The proof is in the observation.

The lapse rate is a description of temperature change as altitude changes.  That rate is entirely determined by the composition of the air (mainly it's specific heat). So, as you allude, most changes in lapse rate on our planet are due to variations in water vapor.    Also I think the direct effect of the anthropogenic CO2 fraction on the lapse rate is probably acknowledged by every serious scientist to be less than miniscule, because CO2's specific heat is not dissimilar to other atmospheric gases.   The lapse rate alone does not specify what the temperature is at any given altitude.  To do that, requires stipulating the temperature at some altitude, and calculating up or down from there.   And the obvious altitude from which to start predicting a temperature profile would be the effective emission altitude, the height of  the effective planetary temperature.    This raises the obvious question, What determines the effective emission altitude?   And that's where, as I understand it, conventional theory says greenhouse gasses and radiation come into play.  More GHG and/or incoming solar radiation causes the atmosphere to 'swell up' and raise the effective emission altitude, leading to higher surface temps as one goes down to the surface.  Less GHG and/or insolation causes the atmosphere to shrink, lowering the surface temperature.   Thing is, by far the biggest GHG is water vapor. So we should see the effective emission altitude change with humidity.   Of course, changes to humidity also affect the specific heat of the air, and thus the lapse rate. So that would complicate things a little.     I'm thinking conventional GHG theory is the skeptic's friend.  The alarmists need to go outside it and rely on a speculative and unseen positive feedback, which has only existed in models - models which go well beyond conventional GHG theory."

From my understanding, Co2 is predicted to cool the stratosphere which causes the troposphere to heat which holds more water, both of which ultimately acts like a ""higher albedo downward facing parabolic mirror"" for IR.   In any case, The biggest problem is most models assume a perfect 255K black body emission profile.  The is one of the few studies i've ever seen that assumes a more accurate 288K Stephen-Boltzmann model.  It think this section of the black body wiki should help explain the lack predictive power and of understanding, which this paper is trying to.   The cooling of a body due to thermal radiation is often approximated using the Stefan–Boltzmann law supplemented with a ""gray body"" emissivity ε ≤ 1 (P/A = εσT4). The rate of decrease of the temperature of the emitting body can be estimated from the power radiated and the body's heat capacity.[51] This approach is a simplification that ignores details of the mechanisms behind heat redistribution (which may include changing composition, phase transitions or restructuring of the body) that occur within the body while it cools, and assumes that at each moment in time the body is characterized by a single temperature. It also ignores other possible complications, such as changes in the emissivity with temperature,[52][53] and the role of other accompanying forms of energy emission, for example, emission of particles like neutrinos.[54]   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body#Radiative_cooling  The AGW models usually only assume the basic idealized equations.  In reality this is massively complicated by the fluid nature of our earth, with convection and the emissivity with temperature being the biggest failures of most models. This paper may explain some of the missing inputs."

Here's how Einstein handled peer review:   It was only after Einstein came to the US in 1935 that he came face to face with the peer review process. He and his younger colleague, Nathan Rosen, sent a paper on gravitational waves to Physical Review, a journal which had established its reputation as the premier physics journal in the US. The paper had the potential to be highly controversial as it challenged the idea that gravitation was a wave.  John Tate, the editor of the journal, hesitated over Einstein’s paper for a month. He then send it to a reviewer for comments and the reviewer returned ten pages of comments which cast doubt on many of the central claims in the paper. The editor returned these comments to Einstein, asked him to consider the issues, and make any changes he saw necessary.

climateskeptics,3c943s,KryptOrchid,4,Mon Jul 6 16:30:07 2015 UTC,"Basically, this ""the end justifies the means"" motto represents the ethics of responsibility, as opposed to the ethics of conviciton. These are the two everyday ethics all of use use in our lives.  Those applying the ethics of conviction (EoC) always ""know"" beforehand which decision/action/sentiment is good and which is evil. It is how children are raised and most religions work this way. ""You must not steal"" or ""charity is good"".  Those applying the ethics of responsibility (EoR) know that only the outcome (the ""ends"") can judge if a decision/action/sentiment was good or bad. This kind of ethic usually takes over with growing intellect and life experience, although many people never leave the EoC phase. Another motto here is ""the road to hell is paved with good intentions"". Or like we say in Germany ""gut gemeint ist das Gegenteil von gut"" (well-intended is the opposite of well done).  With the EoR, there's of course the problem that you cant see the outcome beforehand. But with sufficient intellect and life experience you can often predict and calculate the different outcomes of different decisions. And when you fail you ""take responsibility"" as in you ""live with the consequences"".  Alarmists are typical EoC people. They value authority and hate personal risk, are often young and inexperienced or intellectually weak. EoR people are skeptics by nature.   And here is the clue: when immature people hear the motto ""the end justifies the means"" they understand ""certain ends are absolute and justify every means"". This is actually, how it's mostly quoted and explained in the media for example. Ive never seen a journalist who understood the true nature of the motto."

EoR people are skeptics by nature.   I loved your reasoning, up until this bit. It is this kind of composition bias that maintains one's EoC mentality and keeps people from educating themselves, because ""they are already part of the more intelligent group"", right?  Both camps are made up of EoC and EoR personalities, the number of which solely depends on the size of the group. As you mentioned yourself, many people don't leave the EoC phase which is the reason why there are a lot of blind followers in both groups. However, since the skeptics community is smaller than the environmentalist community, there is also a distinct lack of EoR people. This hurts the skeptic community in the long term. This, for example, explains why there are still climate change deniers, a relative lack of peer reviewed papers that disprove antropogenic climate change, or the fact that some skeptic arguments that have been debunked over and over again are still being propagated by a select few."

As an EoR person on the other hand, it is likely that you will eventually leave the mainstream. Most of us skeptics once believed into the threat of catastrophic warming. It sounded plausible and little was to say against it. But we grew older and wiser, and eventually we stumbled over arguments against the theory of the climate of doom we couldnt just ignore or dismiss as an EoC person would do.   Im pretty sure that there is a very significant correlation between your choice of ethics and your membership in which camp.  No doubt there are shades of grey here, and youre right that not all skeptics are skeptics for the right reasons, and some aint skeptics at all.

You are right in stating that EoC people need an authority to guide them. However, which camp this authority is in is unimportant; within the mainstream or not. Like I said, it largely depends on the group size. I'd like to add to this that it also depends on one's peers. There only needs to be one charismatic enough EoR in the peer group to make an EoC switch camp. However, making a sweeping statement like you did that skeptics are largely EoR is simply false, as a lot of skeptics just regurgitate whatever is put in front of them without giving it a second thought - which can be seen as a skepticism-paradox. Such statements only have the unwanted effect that they foster a confirmation bias (i.e. an unfounded feeling of ""we're smart; they're not"") within those that don't deserve it.

I dont think so.   The mainstream exists only because of EoC people in the first place. Statistically they lump together in the bigger group more often than in the smaller group. This is of course no instantaneous process. The mainstream isnt always the majority. But the majority always follows the mainstream, with a few years delay.

Gas grills, the ones that 61% of Americans have (according to the article) produce half of the emissions that charcoal grills do, and roughly a third of the emissions of an electric grill.  But! they neglect to mention that charcoal is wood, and thus adds no extra carbon dioxide to the environment that would not be there anyway, because the wood would have emitted the carbon dioxide anyway, and that carbon dioxide came from the atmosphere in the first place.  So, we're down to two choices: gas grills at 5.6 pounds or cooking with electric at 11 pounds.  Let's say that we didn't cook on the grill, and instead cooked inside, like we would in the rain, in the winter, or something.  A great many people have electric ranges.  Guess what?  It takes the same amount of energy to cook indoors, and if we're cooking indoors during the summer, we use air conditioning to remove the heat put into the kitchen from the cooking, using even more energy, which releases even more carbon dioxide.  What they are really saying is: Americans, feel guilty about cooking.  You cook, and eat, and enjoy life, and that is BAD, and you should feel bad.  Americans should not celebrate anything, or cook their food.  If you feel you MUST, east something that doesn't taste as good!  Have a little common courtesy and retrain from enjoying yourself, ever.  You must sacrifice your enjoyment, your way of life, for the common good.  If you are enjoying yourself, the world is doomed.

Some of the data points (rates of CO2 emissions per hour, etc) that the article author then used (misused? abused!) came from that article; but she went off from them in an entirely unwarranted and baseless extrapolation, something that the author other that article in fact very clearly warned AGAINST doing, to wit:    West cautioned against letting this data spoil your holiday fun, saying, ""Considering that the U.S. emitted 5.8 billion tons of carbon dioxide in 2000, the emissions from grills are relatively insignificant. In fact, all of the grills in use July 4 would have to remain lit every hour of every day for three years to approximately equal the average annual U.S. carbon dioxide emissions.

This is simply yet another ridiculous lie that you have been fed, and apparently swallowed without really examining the (rather massive) absurdity of the claims.  Take for example this gallery of the ""comparative calorie content"" of various foods, raw/vege vs meats/processed, etc. which was heavily upvoted in various threads on Reddit just a week or so ago.  Now, for the moment we'll ignore the ridiculous original purpose of the thread (apparently intended to assert/prove that the RH items are ""healthier"" for humans)...  And instead we'll focus on what YOU are claiming, the so called ""CO2"" side of that, and thus (LOL) the ""healthier to the planet"" (egads). How exactly are people going to be obtaining these foods?  From where in terms of source, via what distribution chain, and stored in what manner?  Now what is the ""energy"" impact of that?  Everything on that right-hand side is LOW calorie, quite literally low ""energy density""; in fact THE major component in most of the foods on the right is water content (in some cases, like the peppers, ""air"" is actually even larger); the second major component is a form of cellulose fiber, fiber that while readily digestible by ruminant species, is essentially indigestible by humans, and simply passes out of the gastrointestinal tract as a waste item.  MASSIVE amounts of energy are going to be needed to harvest, haul, process (and don't kid yourself there is MASSIVE ""processing"" of those RH column food items, the little ""baby carrots"" at the top as probably the most prominent example, those things are actually ""cut/trimmed"" in a lathe-like fashion), much less properly store (generally in refrigerated cargo containers) and finally distribute.  Did we mention the level of waste with those food items?  Yes waste, spoilage both enroute and discard at the end point of sale, as well as within the home.    The plain truth of the matter is that the food items on that RH column are massively wasteful in virtually every regard.  Simply by volume alone, to transport the equivalent caloric energy they will require on the order of 5x, 10x, even 100x more than the items in the LH column. And then in terms of final consumption, well even somewhere around HALF of the volume of food in that RH column will end up being discarded as ""spoiled"" and thus not even eaten (and the remaining half will be of very little nutritional benefit, simply increasing the volume of excrement waste {again manifold over the calorie/energy-dense foods on the left} that must be handled by urban sewage systems, and not to mention that due to overrunning the capacity of such systems all too often released into the environment without proper treatment).     wtf is rationality?

""Rationality"" has different specialized meanings in economics, sociology, psychology, evolutionary biology and political science.    Yes of course it does.

Not only because increased co2, but the plants would have less nitrogen around and inside them.  If those co2 numbers were 1,200, the overall plant mass in this planet might decrease, because around the equators would be really hot. Even if they would have enough water, they would need to evaporate it really fast, and that slows down the growth significantly. And as we know, there is not much rain right now too.. That is why those plant species are evolved to survive in heat and drought.  And the oceans do suck that sweet growth nectar (co2) in it, that would hurt the plants in the oceans too, because it makes the water acidic.  I cannot say where the balance is, where the plant mass would be maximum, but it must happen due slow co2 increasing, decreasing, or maintaining this level.

climateskeptics,3c9pg6,nimbuscile,5,Mon Jul 6 20:35:44 2015 UTC,"It's the median you want. Notice at the top of the page it encourages you to read the HadCRUT4 documentation paper before use. The paper describes in detail how the ensemble members are constructed.  In essence, they use an ensemble of time series to quantify uncertainties. Each of the 100 ensemble members contains gridded temperature anomalies, from which one can calculate the global mean. The median of this ensemble gives the 'best estimate' time series. So the median is the appropriate thing to use for HadCRUT4.  Incidentally, I don't think your justification for data choice is very compelling. Choosing it because it shows most clearly the lack of warming since 1998 means you're essentially choosing your result before you do your investigation. The reason we have multiple surface temperature datasets using different methods is because there are a number of different, but roughly equally defensible, approaches to temperature reconstruction. By using multiple datasets we hope to capture the spread in our estimates associated with these different approaches. If you have a particular purpose in mind for the data, you might be able to justify picking one or excluding others, but for general analysis I'd suggest checking all available data. As you'll see here, differences among surface temperature observational datasets are actually rather small."

I will just use the median from the original link given that it is the median for 100 ensemble members so it should be pretty close to the mean.

Incidentally, I don't think your justification for data choice is very compelling. Choosing it because it shows most clearly the lack of warming since 1998 means you're essentially choosing your result before you do your investigation.

The 'median' refers to the median of the ensemble members used to calculate uncertainty. This is an important distinction. I suggest reading the HadCRUT4 documentation paper found on their website.  FYI - all surface temperature datasets need adjustments. If they weren't adjusted they would show jumps in temperature where observing practices changes. In fact, it's not just surface temperatures. Satellite temperature datasets also need adjustments because the instruments used can't be identical and because they flew on different satellites with subtly different orbits. For surface temperature homogenisation, you can read the documentation of the respective datasets. For satellite temperatures there are some papers, such as this one for UAH (this PDF is a little out of date but it's all I could find quickly) and this one for RSS."

climateskeptics,3c9pg6,technologyisnatural,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:03:19 2015 UTC,"The median refers to the 'best estimate' of the temperature anomaly from the ensemble members. The ensemble members reflect the sensitivity of the calculate temperature anomaly to the assumptions used in the construction of the dataset, so they essentially measure the uncertainty.  One could calculate a global mean from any one of the 100 ensemble members. To get the HadCRUT4 best estimate one would take the global mean of the median of the ensemble members.  When using the HadCRUT4 data please also read the documentation and what's included in each of the files. For example, the global-mean annual file is described here.   These 'best estimate' series are computed as the medians of regional time series computed for each of the 100 ensemble member realisations. Time series are presented as temperature anomalies (deg C) relative to 1961-1990. Quoted uncertainties are computed by integrating across the distribution described by the 100 ensemble members, together with additional measurement and sampling error and coverage uncertainty information.  The data files contain 12 columns:  Column 1 is the date.  Column 2 is the median of the 100 ensemble member time series.  Columns 3 and 4 are the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval of bias uncertainty computed from the 100 member ensemble.  Columns 5 and 6 are the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval of measurement and sampling uncertainties around the ensemble median. These are the combination of fully uncorrelated measurement and sampling uncertainties and partially correlated uncertainties described by the HadCRUT4 error covariance matrices.  Columns 7 and 8 are the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval of coverage uncertainties around the ensemble median.  Columns 9 and 10 are the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval of the combination of measurement and sampling and bias uncertainties.  Columns 11 and 12 are the lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval of the combined effects of all the uncertainties described in the HadCRUT4 error model (measurement and sampling, bias and coverage uncertainties)."

The fellow there was writing down the temperature readings from the weather station, a Stevenson screen box. I mentioned to him all the adjustments and he frowned. He said that reading temperatures was not a highly technical undertaking. He’d been doing it for years and didn’t understand why his readings would have to be adjusted.  I asked him about the corrections for time of observation. He said that he reads the morning temperatures 45 minutes later in late summer, as there is not enough light to read it properly. I was surprised that they didn’t just tell them to take a flashlight, but, there you are. I have no idea what the time shift would do before sunrise. His point was that it really didn’t matter. A station some 20 km away (Moose Mountain) is regularly 10C warmer or colder. The night before, a regional rainstorm brought 2 mm of rain to Barrier, but 12 mm to Moose Mountain. When I said that the homogenization techniques involved used stations hundreds of kilometers apart, he just shrugged, indicating that was foolish and meaningless.   I'm a little confused here. There are ""recorders"" who write down the data from a Stevenson screen? They do this presumably twice a day? And they don't necessarily do so at the same time each day? Questions:   Are the times of the readings recorded along with the data? Are the times recorded in localtime? Or GMT? Or GMT-relative? If done in localtime, is the collection-time adjusted according to DST? If DST is taken into account, is the change in DST taken into account? (More relevant in the US, where DST changes with the political wind). Are the min/max reset daily or twice a day? For each screen/station, is there a ""backup"" recorder? One who will do it in case the primary is on vacation or sick?  If not, one would expect to find gaps in the data. What is done with such gaps? If there are one or more days of non-recording, how are the min/max recorded on the day the recorder returns? The min/max should be thrown out, obviously, but does the recorder toss/ignore those data, or is that done further in the data-processing line?   Surely responsible scientists have addressed these questions when considering raw data. As a noob in this field, I would appreciate anyone with a scientific paper, for instance, that clarifies these points in a hopefully somewhat clear manner."
climateskeptics,3c484y,logicalprogressive,7,Sat Jul 4 16:53:20 2015 UTC,"EVERYONE who has any interest in climate science should read the full paper int he article. This should be a SERIOUS blow to the Malthusians.  Anyone with even a basic understanding the fluid dynamics can tell you this.  Any radiative imbalances are countered by convective adjustments in a fluid.  The increase rate of convection would explain the reduced levels of pressure differential based extreme weather events(IE hurricanes and tornado), because increased convection will reduce the probability of a large localized pressure differential(aka heat).  Basically the air is recycling faster which makes it more uniform.  It's kinda like putting a giant whisk into the atmosphere to homogenize any hotpots.  This is also the reason why wind speeds go up as you get farther from the sun (Neptune have the highest windspeed in the solar system). Less homogenized because there is less convection, so local hot spots can grow relatively hotter, which means higher pressure differentials.  PS, check this out, from the paper.   Similarly, if one mentally replaces Venus’s carbon dioxide atmosphere by the nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere at the same pressure of 90.9 atm, its surface temperature would increase from 735.3 K tо 793.4 K (or from 462 tо 520 C)   I love physics."

In response to fossil fuel emissions? Global mean surface temperatures will continue to rise. Arctic sea ice will continue to melt, as will glaciers in general. Sea levels will continue to rise. Ocean energy gain will rise. We will see increasingly frequent and extreme weather events worldwide- droughts, floods, fires, storms and hurricanes.It is likely that we will see these impact episodically on food production, and thus on food prices. We will see increasing cases where climate change will be implicated in driving migration and conflict. It is also likely that we will see increased burden of those vector-borne diseases exacerbated by climate change- perhaps particularly Dengue Fever.   Almost all of what he just said, so far, are just statistically insignificant noise, or statistically beneficial (as in less hurricanes, less droughts, etc).   The only thing that has caused a noticeable global increase in inflation adjusted food prices was the ethanol mandate.   As for the diseases... Maybe they should be asking themselves why DDT is banned.  Or how raising energy prices would make it easier to deal with. Or how a statistically insignificant amount of warming is leading to anything?"

Also, volcanoes, even if long lasting, can vary in intensity by extreme amounts over a very short periods.   In anycase, We had limited knowledge of the dynamics under the WAIS until very recently.  To rule out the volcanism under the ice as a mechanism for the glacial slide is stupid.  Judging by the clear build up of ice on the rest of the antarctic continent, with volcanism being one of the few anomalis features of the WAIS...

climateskeptics,3bzhq2,moirende,6,Fri Jul 3 19:06:35 2015 UTC,"There is a basic, fundamental problem with sites like Digg and Reddit: they are businesses that depend on committed volunteers to build a strong community and do a LOT of heavy lifting. Unfortunately, a site also has to find ways to make money too, as ultimately they are accountable to their investors first and foremost. You know, the people who put a little bit more skin into the game than the occasional dollop of Reddit gold and moderating a sub in their spare time.  Challenge is, volunteer communities tend to hate that sort of thing and resist efforts to make changes that might help improve profitability if they are perceived to be damaging to ""the community"".  See Digg. Worse, a left-leaning site like Reddit that is literally stuffed to the rafters with activists and people who haven't the barest glimmer of understanding of how economies actually work - see Reddit's love for politicians like Warren and Sanders and Greece's Tsipras - is always going to have a hard time trying to become more profitable. Most of their user base has no money, is not a desirable demographic, and will resist such attempts to the death. I mean, look at what they're doing right now. People who claim to love Reddit are literally taking whatever steps they can to destroy it.  For me, I see what is happening right now as the logical extension of allowing people like nallen to have the influence he has. Activists are always more interested in stifling debate and discussion and tearing things down when they don't get their way or see something they don't like. It's what they do. And unlike normal adults, they have the time and the over-commitment to follow through.  It's hard to see all this ending well. What does Reddit do now? Re-hire a staff person who resists finding ways to make her company more profitable? Clean out all the social justice warrior mods who've made their major subs private and recruit new ones?

If it does not show up, I can simply laugh at their foolishness.    I don't own any coal burning power plants, so I don't control what amount of CO2 my electricity use puts into the air.  If the proposed (and funded) nuclear power plant near by goes online, I think it's supposed to replace about half of the local fossil fuel use in local power plants anyway - which the environmental nuts hate because they can't point at us and say we're bad people for putting CO2 in the air, and they hate nuclear just as much.  I'll put solar panels on my roof when the installation costs come down enough to justify the cost.  I'll be happy enough to get power from solar, and it would off-set summertime air-conditioning bills nicely.  But, I don't have land suitable for massive wind farms, or geothermal plants, or pig-shit recycling centers, so that's the best I can do.  This is not about individuals - it's about big money and political power.  Us little guys just sit on the sidelines and watch."
climateskeptics,3bw7mq,Candygram_for_Mongo,3,Fri Jul 3 15:02:27 2015 UTC,So let us say the keepers of historical temperatures fraudulently adjusted the data to make it appear global warming is worse than it really is. Who in authority is going to determine this and prosecute?  No one. Power and authority do not work that way. Too many interests are vested in the science being accurate and too much credibility and power and money are at stake  Such a fraud will only come to light if something drastic comes to light that refutes the entire global warming thesis and those in power begin to look for scapegoats to blame. And this is highly unlikely to happen.

Before I ended up in the US I thought Americans were completely gun-crazy. But living here more than a decade has nuanced my position a bit. Stricter registration rules wouldn't make much of a difference, numerous studies show that. The only people that would be negatively affected are law-abiding citizens, which are unlikely to commit any crimes to begin with. Read about Haynes v. United States, it's fascinating. The government cannot force convicted felons to register for firearm possession, since, as felons, they are not legally allowed to own guns, so registering a gun would equate to self-incrimination, which the government cannot force you do. So they can still prosecute the bad guy for illegal possession of a firearm, but they can't prosecute him for not registering it. You would be surprised how much Americans do care about the law and the Constitution. It's not just empty rhetoric.

Two other studies have similar failings (and findings, around 90% usually). One being from the IPCC in which some 2000 members or so were polled, but not all of them were necessarily scientists (IPCC is a bureaucratic organization after all, and only about 20% of them are scientists).  Hardly a convincing ""Consensus"" on the subject with tens of thousands of scientists in the US alone if you include engineers.       Another was an online poll which sent out about 10K 2 question survey's and received only a 30% response rate, only 77 of the respondents were scientists and the survey was simply ""Do you think it was warmed since 1880"" and ""Do you think mankind has a significant affect on the climate"".       All are terribly disingenuous to claim everyone agrees on AGW. Especially when you aren't quantifying what aspects of AGW are they agreeing on.     Is climate change 100% influenced by mankind with no external factors? Is it dangerous? Is carbon the primary driver?

Some prime examples, that either show the author of this piece (Ed Caryl) didn't read the article he's commenting on, or he is purposefully lying about its content:  Caryl: But there was cooling for four decades after 1930 without any major volcanoes.  Box et al., 2009: Two interdecadal cooling periods are 1932–46 and 1955–82. The 1955–82 cooling phase was most significant during autumn in east and southern Greenland. The 1932–46 cooling phase was relatively weak and not statistically significant.  Once again, the climate denier's inability to understand statistical significance betrays their agenda. You can't say there were decades of cooling since 1930 if the trend lacks statistical significance - it's little different from taking a political poll with a 3-point margin of error, seeing a candidate head by 1 point, and declaring them as the leader.  So the actual cooling period observed is much shorter, 1955-1982. Not only is it absurd to claim that the local trend in one region must be driven by CO2 in order for CO2 to be a climate driver, this period is coincident with both the volcanic eruption of Agung in the early 60s and this explicit statement in the conclusions of the paper: Box et al., 2009:  Considering also that Northern Hemispheric cooling in 1940–70 is attributable to the “global dimming” effect of increasing sulfate aerosols, the sulfate cooling effect is, again, felt more strongly in Greenland, and indirectly via altered atmospheric dynamics not via local radiation budget modification.  The period under consideration is affected by aerosol loading of the atmosphere, which is a well-known phenomenon and in no way weakens the theory that CO2 can drive the climate.   His language is a bit colorful, but I think he makes a valid case against what Ed is claiming"

They give us a snapshot of the environment at the time.  What you're forgetting is that orbital changes trigger initial warming, not CO2.  When those orbital changes have settled and temperatures continue to rise, it's because CO2 takes over as the driver, causing a feedback loop:  warmer environment leads to more life on the planet, which leads to more CO2 being put out, until the whole system finds it's balance.  All the CO2 that Earth emits naturally over time finds a counter balance with something there to absorb it.  We're introducing CO2 levels that haven't been seen in millions of years, all because there's nothing to absorb all (some, but not all) of our CO2.  It lingers each year, and that's why it's building up.    Back to ice cores though, the snapshot of the environment through the reading of air bubbles also tells us when CO2 levels were much higher in the past without catastrophe, other non-vaporous gasses were also high.  Oxygen, for instance, acts a counter-balance to the effects of CO2, and therefor simply looking at CO2 levels isn't enough when determining the importance of the temperatures at that time.   The rest of the long-term records are from far less reliable proxies, fodder for the big lie and the ""global"" weasel wording.

You stand alone in your crusade against paleoclimatology, a respected field of science by even ardent skeptics.

That has not been my experience in the slightest.  Paleoclimatology is a field of science where quite often several different teams analyze the same data with no communication between them and arrive at the same conclusions.  In this way it is one of the fields of science involved in the great climate change debate that is relied upon heavily within the debate itself, not as a matter of contention, but as a basis of understanding.  Here's an example:  http://wattsupwiththat.com/2015/06/15/medieval-warm-period-confirmed-via-cave-study-of-3000-years-of-climatic-variations/  WattsUpWithThat, arguably NOT an ""alarmist"" website, is using data from caves which reveal the medieval warm period.

climateskeptics,3bjalz,ozric101,0,Tue Jun 30 05:41:42 2015 UTC,"If you measure the temp in a local place did the CO2 for another place cause the warming?   You're forgetting that such a reading is 90% dependent on the water vapor of the region.  Water vapor is 90% of the greenhouse gas effect for us down here.  Water vapor also can be moved around with the jet streams and weather patterns etc.    So yes, warming can occur in one region as a result of CO2 from another, BUT, CO2 exists fairly uniformly throughout the atmosphere.  The thing that controls the vertical concentration of gases is not their weight but the adiabatic temperature. If weight were the controlling factor then the mixing ratio of water vapor would be constant up to the homopause, which it isn't. In contrast, the mixing ratio of CO2 is relatively constant through the atmosphere (see reference link) up to very high altitudes.   The difference is that CO2 sublimes at -79 C while water boils at 100 C and freezes at 0 C. This means that while the partial pressure of CO2 follows PV=nRT for its temperature dependence up to very high altitudes, the partial pressure of H2O is set by the vapor pressure of water (if above 0 C) and the sublimation pressure of ice (if below 0 C). Since the major gases in the atmosphere except water and CO2 all go as PV=nRT, their mixing ratios are constant with altitude. The equilibrium vapor pressure of water decreases with altitude (because temperature decreases with altitude and so does the vapor pressure/sublimation pressure) so its mixing ratio decreases.  This is also why statements to the effect that water vapor is more important as a greenhouse gas are simplistic in terms of a CO2-induced radiative forcing. The concentration of CO2 is relatively constant through the troposphere whereas H2O decreases rapidly. CO2 longwave effects are most important at altitude, where the H2O mixing ratio is much lower than near the surface."

There is an economic theory which explains simply why the specialization happens. Say John can pick 2 apples and 3 pears a minute, while Steve can pick 3 apples and 2 pears a minute. If they do their thing, they have 5 apples and 5 pears together. But it looks like John is better at picking pears (say 6 per minute), while Steve is better at picking apples (say 6 per minute), so if they specialize, they have 6 of each per minute, so it's an overall improvement over the previous configuration. Specialization, like I said, means progress. If we start from scratch and follow this principle of improving life for everyone, in the end we would evolve to a similar type of society.

Did it take them 5 years to figure out that he wasn't showing up to classes? The official statement from MU also mentions as reason the fact that he booked his flights through an unapproved agency. Gimme a break... All companies I worked for have these travel agencies which are awful and I always find flights on Expedia that are 20-25% cheaper than the approved agency. He is quite a controversial character, for sure, some interesting stuff went on at the University of Colorado before he resigned, but I also believe that MU doesn't present the whole picture. They had an agreement with Salby and allegedly they did not hold their end of the agreement, so in response, he probably didn't hold his end (teaching) either. I wouldn't give MU a clean pass though."

One was a direct co-worker which I myself had interviewed and recommended to my bosses. It took more than a year to realize there was something wrong with him, and after another year we finally got rid of him after he got caught stealing equipment.

climateskeptics,3bfs1w,Feldheld,6,Mon Jun 29 19:03:06 2015 UTC,"I dont know of course. The accusations are very concrete though   That's how a successful smear works, though. Macquarie University is being somewhat climatological with the truth here - the accusations are simultaneously very 'concrete' in how they are presented and very oblique in how they reference reality.  Salby was recruited to do research, not to teach. When he took up the position, the resources promised in his contract were withheld, and the university blocked him from disseminating it. The 'refusal to teach' in the official statement apparently refers to his professorial duties being reduced to those of a junior student teaching assistant, a reassignment which Salby disputed as being incompatible with his contract.    http://joannenova.com.au/2013/07/macquarie-university-sabotages-exiles-blackbans-strands-and-abandons-murry-salby/   and on top of that he had a similar history with his former employer Uni. of Colorado.   Again, that is how a smear propagates. What precisely is 'similar' about it? This is apparently in reference to a 'leaked'  internal memo from the grant foundation, the National Science Foundation, regarding an investigation into Salby's grant applications. The memo actually found the accusations against Salby to be ungrounded, but, with smear, appearance is what counts, and an accusation is as good as a conviction.   http://joannenova.com.au/2013/08/murry-salby-responds-to-the-attacks-on-his-record/  Another summary here:  http://www.city-journal.org/2014/24_3_global-warming.html"

climateskeptics,3bfs1w,Feldheld,2,Tue Jun 30 07:01:11 2015 UTC,"Why would Macquarie smear him?   That is the modus operandi of activists: shut down opposition by any means necessary.  See point 13. in the first link in my previous comment.    In April, The Australian (the national newspaper), published an article which grounded reckless claims by the so-called Australian Climate Commission:  http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/opinion/last-summer-was-not-actually-angrier-than-other-summers/story-e6frgd0x-1226611988057 (Open access via Google News)  To promote the Climate Commission’s newest report is the latest sobering claim:  “one in two chance that by 2100 there’ll be no human beings left on this planet”  http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/opinion/if-you-want-to-know-about-climate-ask-the-right-questions/story-fni0ffxg-1226666505528  Two of the six-member Australian Climate Commission are Macquarie staff. Included is its Chief Commissioner.   The Chief Commissioner is Tim Flannery.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Flannery   Wasnt he known as a skeptic...   No, or at least he was not obviously skeptical. He was known as the author of a popular textbook on atmospheric physics which did not challenge the consensus in any obvious way. Here is what they thought they were hiring:  http://web.archive.org/web/20110408230601/http://www.envsci.mq.edu.au/staff/ms/research.html  http://www.researchonline.mq.edu.au/vital/access/BibliographyStatistics/Salby,%20Murry%20L?letter=S&highlights=true  He only began his controversial investigation into the carbon cycle because he was diverted from the main thrust of his research. See (6) in the link in previous comment.   During the protracted delay of resources, I eventually undertook the production of a new book – all I could do without the committed resources to rebuild my research program. The endeavor compelled me to gain a better understanding of greenhouse gases and how they evolve. Preliminary findings from this study are familiar to many.  http://www.thesydneyinstitute.com.au/speaker/murry-salby/ Refer to the vodcast of July 24, 2012.  Insight from this research contradicts many of the reckless claims surrounding greenhouse gases. More than a few originate from staff at Macquarie, who benefits from such claims."

The modus operandi of climate activists so far has never been to smear skeptics by blaming them of some unrelated misbehaviour but attack them directly for their skepticism and ostracize them using good old group pressure. And Im sure most alarmists view skepticism as a far more horrible sin to commit than ordinary fraud."

I am not seeing any similarity at all. You need to spell this out.    The modus operandi of climate activists so far has never been to smear skeptics by blaming them of some unrelated misbehaviour but attack them directly for their skepticism   This is clearly untrue. For instance, there is the pre-emptive accusation of being in the pay of big oil to spread 'misinformation'. The unfounded accusations of dishonesty in research grant applications aimed at Salby is very closely paralleled by the false accusations against Willie Soon.    ...and ostracize them using good old group pressure.

If it is cooler in 2020 than 1990 I will devote some time to burning some fossil fuels to celebrate. Time will tell indeed.

If the next five years get even warmer we should drop this debate, be on the same team, and solve this mess.   So if 2020 is slightly warmer than 2015, but the temperature trend continues to diverge from expected warming based on assumptions of strong positive feedbacks, should we then drop the debate?  Is that all you'll need to claim victory?"
climateskeptics,3bcs2f,Will_Power,2,Mon Jun 29 02:12:07 2015 UTC,"u/firefoxG would put money on the whole debate being over in 5 years. So I am assuming that u/firefoxG meant that a decreasing temperature trend, due at least in part due to the solar minimum as per the OP topic, would be so obvious as to kill the debate.   I am not trying for any victories here, I just like the ideas on this sub to be falsifiable. I am not claiming AGW authorities have made the catastophic part falsifiable, it should be. But perhaps this sub should try and be better. I agree that your 'slightly warmer' sinario is not decisive. It would be a victory for everyone in fact and would suggest a smaller magnitude of climate sensitivity, but I would still think that AGW exists. Where would you stand in that senario? If it doesn't cool in the next five years does it put the solar influence as per OP theory to bed for you?"
climateskeptics,3bcs2f,lostshakerassault,6,Mon Jun 29 02:56:21 2015 UTC,"So I am assuming that u/firefoxG meant that a decreasing temperature trend...   That could be what he meant, given the context.  I would say that should the hiatus continue for another five years, that would invalidate the strong net positive feedback hypothesis, but recent a recent paper demonstrates how desperate many activists are to pretend there is no such thing.   I am not trying for any victories here, I just like the ideas on this sub to be falsifiable... But perhaps this sub should try and be better.   I think you have it backwards.  Climate scientists put forth a very clear, falsifiable claim: warming would accelerate during the 21st century.  If that were happening, this sub wouldn't exist.  This sub does exist because that hypothesis isn't being supported by the data.  The hypothesis was never, ""slight warming, resulting in warming records being set every few years,"" yet how often do you hear the hype around ""Hottest Year, Evaaar!""?  In case you haven't noticed, the trend in the literature is continual revision downwards of climate sensitivity, both ECS and TCR.  At some point those lower revisions aren't going to jive with the hype around potential effects of warming.  At that point, the majority of activists will have moved on to something else, with a few die hards still wringing their hands about warming.  I would think that another five years of hiatus would do the job, but then again, activists are more resilient than most folks.  So it really isn't incumbent upon this sub to offer an alternative hypothesis, only to keep the purveyors of data honest and keep past declarations of doom from slipping down the rabbit hole.   I agree that your 'slightly warmer' sinario is not decisive. It would be a victory for everyone in fact and would suggest a smaller magnitude of climate sensitivity,    Actually, it wouldn't be a victory for the IPCC and its thousands of contributors.  It would be a humiliating defeat.  I get what you are saying, though.  You are saying that the threat so many people worry about is manageable.   but I would still think that AGW exists. Where would you stand in that senario?    I would stand where I stand now: CO2 is a GHG, and has had a sizable impact on the warming experienced during the 20th century.  Feedbacks are not nearly as strong as hypothesized.  The forcing from increases in CO2 follows a logarithmic curve, so additional CO2 should still increase radiative forcing a bit, but not by enough to worry about.   If it doesn't cool in the next five years does it put the solar influence as per OP theory to bed for you?   I think you should recognize that mainstream scientists already acknowledge that solar influences were a major contributor to the 20th century warming.  They just maintain that mankind played a bigger role in the latter half of the 20th century.  As for me, I don't expect much (if any) cooling in the next five years.  If the sun plays a bigger role than the IPCC currently believes, it won't show up for quite a bit longer.  That's for two reasons:   Solar cycle 24 (the present cycle), though weaker than previous cycles, is still stronger than solar cycles during the early 20th and late 19th centuries.  You could think of this one as a cycle that should force temperatures up or down. The lag associate with solar forcing is about 12 years.  (See figure 3 in this: http://www2.mps.mpg.de/dokumente/publikationen/solanki/c153.pdf)   It is projected that solar cycle 25 will be very weak.  If that proves true, then given points 1 and 2 above, there should be notable cooling about 20-25 years from now.  How's that for a falsifiable hypothesis?  Now, if warming doesn't increase significantly in five years, would that put the strong feedback hypothesis to bed for you?"
climateskeptics,3bcs2f,Will_Power,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:41:55 2015 UTC,"I agree. If warming continues outside climate models placing new estimates of climate sensitivity in a range where changes occur at a rate where we can easily adapt, I think we would be pretty much in agreement. Five years might be enough to convince me. Probably more like between 5 and 10, especially since this year might be an El Nino like 1998. This isn't based on any analysis, just a reflection of how compelling I find the evidence that running an experiment in the atmosphere where most experts predict poor outcomes just isn't worth clinging to fossil fuels for.  If you agree that CO2 does have an effect, do you have a level of CO2 that you would be uncomfortable with? ie is 4000ppm CO2 of absolutely no concern to you? Are there negative feedbacks that might get saturated?"

The literature (which the IPCC opted to ignore, for some reason), suggests we don't even have enough fossil fuel reserves to much more than double atmospheric CO2 from preindustrial levels.  (In other words, 560 ppm is about the limit we can produce.)

There is no team.  This is science.  No matter what the alarmists say, or anyone else, there is no credible path forward that involves cutting Co2 emissions or lowering consumption. No amount of discussion will convince people to lower their standard of living to combat something that is projected to be less then 5% p.a. GDP loss by 2100.  The ONLY paths forward are not going to happen through resource restrictions, but ONLY through technological advancements which will only become possible with INCREASED resource use.  As an example, a giant sunshade in space, or some other form of geoengineering.   I hope you are correct but if you are not will you accept global warming?

Then they claim that is 100 times greater than the natural rate which would imply that the natural rate is .0477 extinctions per year or one species of animal going extinct every 21.28 years.  They also claimed that the rate of extinction is ""unprecedented in Earth's 4.5 billion year history.""  So evidently when the asteroid that took out the dinosaurs hit we never had more than 4 species a year die.  Same goes for the permian extinction which killed 96% of all species but definitely never more than 4 a year.  So of estimated 2,000,000 species of animals on the planet 4 are dying off every year meaning that every hundred years we are losing 0.023% of animal species.  If we continue on this path then 1000 years from now we will have lost almost 1 out of every 400 species on earth, gasp!!!

Further more I find the statement 'the science is settled' to be absurd.  For example it is hard to imagine any thing being as settled as for example Newtonian physics.  And yet Einstein came along and everyone had to realize the old settled physical laws only applied under certain conditions.  Considering that every living thing on earth is a variable in what makes up the climate it inconceivable that we know enough to make the certain predictions of doom and gloom.  Also the attempt to block any discussion or debate makes me very suspicious.  Science should always be about reexamining what is believed to be fact.

climateskeptics,3b4svk,Rex130,9,Fri Jun 26 05:33:13 2015 UTC,"Publication records in journals are a bad proxy for scientific focus around this time.   There was a sea change in the way scientists worked and published starting in the late '60s with the introduction of the 'publish or perish' criteria for career success. Before this point, scientists published only when they had a discovery that they considered worthy of communicating to their peers, and the papers would be complete and carefully written. Most scientific communication was less formal, being done through direct consultation, conferences, books or memos.   From the '70s onwards there has been an explosion in new journals which tend to be filled with material of vastly lower quality than before. Peer review was introduced as a desperate attempt at quality control. It is not a seal  of correctness or quality, but simply an indication that the paper was considered fit to publish.  The 'paper counting by keyword' exercises from Oreskes, Petersen, Connolley and others simply don't take this into account. Added to that, keywords are not necessarily a good way of investigating a domain of knowledge."

I proved my point, and still had to keep showing papers, and reports.   You did not prove your point (you made a point which is different), because you could not answer my questions that I gave you, and you only gave me one article that could be taken as a paper as all the rest were opinion pieces.     I sent in data from studies and observations.   Not once did you send me data. Don't even try to kid yourself with this.    Then you asked for a peer review because you were not winning your argument, I did that too.   I asked for peer reviewed because you were only giving me opinion pieces with no references. It's sad that you think you won the argument when you could not provide reliable sources (except for one in which you could not answer my questions I had about that source) for the point that you were trying to make.   Don't cry about it.   What a childish statement from a childish little man who cannot even provide reliable sources or answer questions about a the sources he has."

A while back my university lecturer gave us a presentation on setting out the results in our thesis. An important lecture, by any account. At the time, silly me was under the impression that the results section was for presenting your results, whether they be positive, negative, nonsense or completely random and show us nothing at all. At least the data are there for others to see. My lecturer had different ideas. To him, the thesis is a ""story"" and the results section is like a chapter of that story. If some results ""don't tell the story you want them to, you leave them out."" This man had a PhD in Anthropology, so it's not like he's uneducated or unfamiliar with the academic process. He just straight up told us to leave out results we don't like the look of. No one else around me seemed to question this, just accepting it and presumably doing it in their theses.  Everything wrong with academia today, and this mentality is being taught in classrooms around the world.

If the conclusions are not valid it is hard to design experiments that build upon false conclusions so they kind of get weeded out a bit over time.

I respect GRACE data fine (More than the 16 years of surface temps that you guys like to focus on - ice data is less noisy).

It depends on what you're looking for and what you're trying to prove or disprove. For instance a near 2 decade hiatus of rising temps isn't much in  the million year scale of much higher periods of carbon and heat where carbon never forced the climate, but in the context of comparing it to the IPCC projections it certainly is quite relevant.      That said, how much of the ice re-formed? As mentioned in the last comment (And ignored by you) we have a sea level rise that is not indicative of any substantial increase between periods of supposed human forcing and lack therof along with record levels on the opposite pole."

The theory is climate change by methane excursion.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleocene%E2%80%93Eocene_Thermal_Maximum  If you're talking about billions of years ago, yes CO2 was higher but the sun was also dimmer. Would have been a lot colder without CO2.   and lack therof along with record levels on the opposite pole.    Are you talking about ice or sea level. Sea level is measured by Jason satellites indicating a mean global rise. Sea ice extent might have increased in the antarctic but thinkness and glacial volume has decreased as indicated by GRACE."

It's quite reasonable to say that data from post-war industrialisation is probably pertinant.  And one avoids some of the confounding factors from early industrialisation such as soot.

That leaves you with the conundrum of explaining why:   CO2 forcing was increasing during the cooling period from ~1940-~1970.  (If you want to say it was aerosols, I suggest you read Bjorn Stevens's latest paper.) CO2 levels increases faster during this century then the previous, but the rate of warming slowed.

Why has CO2 forcing now twice diverged from temperatures in the last 65 years?   Because it's not a simple 2 variable system. There's also ice and ocean circulation. El Nino/La Nina cause peturbations on a decadal timescale. These average out over the long term but cause the staggering of surface temperature.  Once you account for these effects much multidecadal noise can be accounted for.   http://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2310.epdf  Surface temps are noisy. Exact corellation can't be expected, unlike ice-volume or sea level rise, both of which have consistant trend."
climateskeptics,3b0b72,endlegion,5,Thu Jun 25 16:36:25 2015 UTC,"But if you're blaming carbon for forcing, consider we had ranges of 250 ppm and 550 ppm as recent as the industrial era.

climateskeptics,3b0b72,endlegion,6,Thu Jun 25 10:56:55 2015 UTC,What sea level rise? Here is a comment I posted earlier today on the same topic.
climateskeptics,3b0b72,Florinator,-2,Thu Jun 25 06:14:59 2015 UTC,"AS I have posted to your other comment:  http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/envs501/downloads/Nicholls%20%26%20Cazenave%202010.pdf  To answer your question about what is going on:   Satellite altimetry shows that sea level is not rising uniformly In some regions (e.g., western Pacific), sea level has risen up to three times faster than the global mean since 1993. Spatial patterns in sea-level trends mainly result from nonuniform ocean warming and salinity variations , although other factors also contribute, including the solid Earth response to the last deglaciation and gravitational effects and changes in ocean circulation due to ongoing land ice melting and freshwater input. Spatial patterns in ocean thermal expansion are not permanent features: They fluctuate in space and time in response to natural perturbations of the climate system; as a result, we expect that the sealevel change patterns will oscillate on multidecadal time scales   More importantly:   tide gauge measurements available since the late 19th century indicate that sea level has risen by an average of 1.7 ± 0.3 mm/year since 1950. Since the early 1990s, SLR has been routinely measured by high-precision altimeter satellites. From 1993 to 2009, the mean rate of SLR amounts to 3.3 ± 0.4 mm/year , suggesting that SLR is accelerating.   Also I was wrong: Sea level rise was greater than predicted. http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/424.htm#11321  Meaning that both ocean temps and ice/frozen-land loss were under predicted - Meanwhile the skeptic blogosphere continues to obsess over the (still within 95% confidence interval of some models) over-prediction in Surface Temperature (Which can be corrected with El Nino/La Nina modifications - But these would be irrelevent over longer timescales)."

Using an evidence based approach, mankind has known the earth is round for quite some time, even coming very close to calculating the exact circumference before even Jesus lived.  Carl Sagan's Cosmos covers Eratosthenes and this very topic., it's quite interesting.  The types of people who believed the earth was flat were people who didn't listen to experts who knew better.  Their logic was that they could see it with their own eyes, the ships going off into the distance were sailing right off the edge.  They were ::gasp:: round-earth deniers."
climateskeptics,3ay8ps,Kelly_jernigan,2,Thu Jun 25 19:46:57 2015 UTC,"*Actual ancient history  Very early Egyptian and other Middle-Eastern civilisations portrayed the Earth as flat land suspended in an ocean, and with a ""roof"" of some kind over it. This is particularly reflected in some of the prose that made its way into the Bible and has been used to justify flat-Earth beliefs today.  Ancient Chinese astronomy makes no mention of any roundness of the Earth, indeed some depictions made it square. In Siam, now Thailand, the flat-earth idea was part of Buddhist scripture until the 1800s, as part of the Traiphum cosmography.[3] However, most religious scholars considered it as a metaphorical description. It's unlikely it was ever taken painfully literally in Siam, even before King Mongkut (the one of The King and I fame) officially introduced more modern geography during his reforms and westernisation of the country.  In Western science and theology, that the entire world really was flat was discredited the moment it was properly considered and looked at, and had faded by the time of Classical Greek philosophy. Pythagoras suggested that the Earth was round, and Aristotle provided convincing evidence for it in Ancient Greece, although the main source to suggest Greeks prior to Aristotle thought the world was flat is Aristotle himself. Around 240 BCE, Eratosthenes measured the circumference of the Earth to an impressive degree of accuracy. By the Middle Ages, even the Catholic Church's most beloved of scientific theologians, Thomas Aquinas, was advancing the Earth's roundness as a fundamental of logic.*   http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Flat_Earth  Yes, at one time, all people of science thought it was flat.  And the few that didn't, had to convince the rest it wasn't.

Figueres has said repeatedly that communism is the best way to deal with climate change and that the Chinese (!!!) got it right. And in order to achieve said goals, these people put out a message that resonates with people; people looking for a deeper meaning in life. Religion is as good as gone from the Western World for the youngest generations, but unfortunately that leaves a void for most people, that must be filled with something. Like I said, a deeper meaning to life, a higher calling of some sorts. Enter climate change. It satisfies the same psychological needs religion does, because you fight for the greater good, replace God with Mother Earth, Satan with Big Oil, sins with carbon emissions, repentance with recycling and you're good to go. I do believe that most people are honestly concerned and do believe that the danger is imminent. I also believe that the main AGW demographic is mostly young, relatively well off, that don't have to provide for a family [yet]. I read recently that couples who decide to have children are less likely to buy into the climate change doom and gloom or are likely to change their mind if they did before. And it makes sense, you can't believe the world will end in a couple of decades and then decide to have kids, what would be the point?  On the other side of the debate you have people who don't buy into the message and speak out, which basically causes them to be attacked and marginalized by the other side's militant activists.  I believe the largest group of people don't care enough to say anything and they just go on with their lives. Most opinion polls in the US at least show that climate change ranks very low on people's most important issues list. It doesn't even make the top 10."

Manmade climate change, by contrast, is expected to bring temperature rises of up to 6.6C in the same period if drastic action is not taken to cut carbon emissions.    First off where does this 6.6C temperature increase come from. From my understanding the Earth's temperatures have been increasing by roughly 0.8 per century. How exactly will we now amplify this number by 8, as CO2 at these current levels - or roughly 400ppm - can't cause this.

To then assess how this perception varied among respondents with different levels of expertise, we sub-divided respondents based on their self-assessed area of expertise – climate science vs. meteorology and atmospheric science – and whether or not they have published peer-reviewed research in the previous five years, and if so, on what topic. Our premise was that AMS members who are actively conducting and publishing climate science research have greater expertise on climate science than AMS members who have other areas of expertise.  We found that more than 9 out of 10 climate science experts (93%) who publish mostly on climate change, and the same proportion (93%) of climate experts who publish mostly on other topics, were convinced that humans have contributed to global warming."

climateskeptics,3avlud,kriegson,4,Wed Jun 24 14:24:45 2015 UTC,"Undoubtedly people are going to argue and fling insults, though one side has decided to coin a new cultural meaning to a phrase specifically to demean and strawman anyone who dares to not explicitly agree with their agenda, and push mass media and journalists to exclusively use this term as well when referring to anyone on the other side of the argument.         It's not unlike how when talking about the Zimmerman trial or Ferguson riots, one instantly gets accused of being a racist by the ""other side"" in an attempt to invalidate their argument. In fact I'd say it's basically the same tactic.      ""Go against the Agenda? You must be an X. Hey mass media, journalists. Anyone who goes against the agenda, label them an X.""     While it works to demean others and in the eyes of the ignorant, convince them the other side isn't worth listening to, it does absolutely no favors in convincing people in the middle. Thus their attempts to remove any middle from the debate with the ""You're either with us or against us"" attitude.       Their fuckup in this regard though is that science isn't about popular opinion and they can be demonstrably proven wrong."
climateskeptics,3avlud,MillenFalc,2,Wed Jun 24 14:35:06 2015 UTC,"Both sides came up with terms.  ""Denier"" and ""Alarmist.""   Frankly, just like I don't know why someone is automatically a denier for being an actual skeptic, conversely I don't know why anyone automatically is an alarmist if they simply believe in the theory of AGW.  Anthropogenic global warming is simply the theory that mankind can change the climate through carbon emissions, it doesn't say anything about how bad things will get or what actions are needed, or whether we should even be panicking or in the very least ""alarmed.""  The theory doesn't care about any of that, it just focuses on the role CO2 plays as a greenhouse gas and the fact that we are causing it to build up, that's it."
climateskeptics,3avlud,Will_Power,5,Wed Jun 24 14:42:11 2015 UTC,"I generally use five labels, going from least alarmed to most alarmed:  Denier --> Skeptic --> Lukewarmer --> Warmist --> Alarmist.  Denier: rejects AGW.  Skeptic: accepts that CO2 is increasing and will increase temperatures somewhat; rejects net positive feedbacks.  Recalls past dire warnings of catastrophe that never came about.  Lukewarmer: accepts that CO2 will increase temperatures, accepts that some positive feedbacks are likely.  Rejects high ECS/TCR based on observation.  Warmist: accepts that CO2 will increase temperatures, believes that feedbacks are strongly positive.  Basis belief on GCMs and paleo studies.  Alarmist/Activist: thinks nature is always on the precipice of disaster.  Thinks an increase in CO2 will trigger catastrophic tipping points.  Believes that the Antarctic and Greenland will melt and raise sea levels by 20 meters in the next 85 years.  Thinks mass extinctions will result.  Whines a lot.    ""Denier"" and ""Alarmist"" are often misapplied as pejoratives to those who don't match those views.  For example, Bjorn Lomborg is a clear warmist, but gets labeled ""denier"" because he thinks climate change shouldn't be our top policy concern."
climateskeptics,3avlud,kriegson,3,Wed Jun 24 15:14:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah there's a middle ground that exists, hence ""warmists"" and ""Skeptics"" as compared to ""Alarmists"" and ""Deniers"".      Like I said though, how often do you see the NY times using ""alarmist"" as compared to ""Denier""? Or CNN? Or the UN? Or Obama? Or pop culture figures like bill nye? Denier is a derogatory term developed for and being used to push a political agenda by demeaning and marginalizing the opposition by people with quite a bit invested into climate science.       Alarmists are just that: The folks who are on the extreme end of the argument who claim runaway warming is causing or will cause catastrophic results, and they usually lead up with calling anyone who disagrees ""Deniers"". I'm not sure I've seen anyone in a major news network use the term. Maybe fox, that's about it.          Alternatively even skeptics can believe in AGW, we just debate the degrees of climate sensitivity and actual impact of warming (Does have positive elements to a degree) and I imagine even warmists can share common ground there. Just because the two terms are used doesn't mean the argument is entirely partisan, though that's what some would have you believe.     Science embraces a broad spectrum of perception, it helps to have more ways to look at something.     Politics does not. ""It's either us or them, and we don't listen to them."" is inherently unscientific.     One side demands you ignore the other. Said other side does quite the opposite, drawing attention to what is said, comparing the data and pointing out flaws, failed past predictions and the problems with future ones. One side is political, one is scientific. There are folks in-between but the powers that be would like to turn a scientific argument which should welcome criticism and more points of view into a polarized political one.     Edit: Sorry for the rant, heh."

That's exactly what has drawn me to this subreddit.  So often this debate is presented as two extremes.   From skeptics I've been convinced that the planet could actually adapt to the excess CO2, that the rate of warming is variable and can change rates from one decade to the next so basing forecasts on how warm things will get is too soon, and that we also have quite a ways to go so far as getting accurate temperature readings from around the globe.

climateskeptics,3avlud,kriegson,5,Wed Jun 24 14:57:20 2015 UTC,"It depends on how the ocean surface temps were gathered. A recent study (k15?) used ship data and buoys. The problem is that the ship data has a degree of uncertainty of around .12C either way!     The methods of gathering the temps range from literally pulling up water in a bucket and dropping a thermometer in, to checking the temps of water being pulled in to cool the engine. Hence the degree of uncertainty.     The problem is that they then used this data to adjust buoy data and then basically went with the highest possible temps on their projections.       Their changes to models also do not reflect what NASA, IPCC and British Oceanic institute have used in their own adjustments.  But that's just  Karl et al., Science 4 June 2015 *Dissemination of its problems  If there are more studies on ocean surface temp pertaining to the theorized heat transfer of the pause, I'd like to see it. Alternatively a different study found there was no significant sea rise below 2000+ meters.     If the heat from the atmosphere was being absorbed by the ocean as a heat sink, the lower temp/lower depth areas would be getting warmed by the heat being absorbed and the ocean would expand, causing a sea rise in the cooler depths (steric sea level rise). But there's no indication of that.       Lots of back and forth, but yes we're just beginning to understand our climate. Doomsday predictions with ""The science is settled!"" doesn't help further our understanding."

It took 225 years to come .8C, but it will take only 75 years or so to double that?    I get that as society progresses our CO2 output will increase, but how can we go from a rate of .8C over 225 years to .8C over 75 years and not be warming still?  I don't get it."
climateskeptics,3auwu0,MillenFalc,4,Tue Jun 23 21:13:01 2015 UTC,"I'm confused by this concept that we're still warming but not...    Well, one of the biggest issues with the AGW theory is that, although warming is natural (we're in an interglacial period), they say that the current warming is unprecedented and accelerated. Well, if the warming is constant (the graph goes up at a steady slope, as opposed to, say, a hockey stick ;-)), then it means it's not accelerated, right? Accelerated would mean that each year is warmer than the previous one by a higher differential than before. So not only is the warming not accelerating, but it's a lot less than even the most conservative IPCC models predicted! And this is also using highly questionable surface temperature data, which is adjusted and homogenized over and over again, such that past temperatures are different (mostly lower) with each new iteration of the temperature record (these data sets are published, almost like Windows, every few years, they have version numbers).  Second, there are many scientists who argue that only the satellite data is good enough to judge the global climate. The satellite data is the only truly global data. Think of Africa or Siberia, where we may have no weather stations for thousands of miles. So, the satellites don't show the same warming that surface data shows. If you plot a graph, you can use statistical methods (linear regression, etc) to figure out the trend. Currently you can go as far back as 18 years and 4 months and get a zero trend. In my understanding this is The Pause. It's the lack of warming in the last 18 years."

When the rate of warming over the last decade or due was less than that of previous decades, scientists started publishing papers in the literature about what might be causing the ""pause"" or ""hiatus.""  They were defining it more as a ""slow down"" than a ""cessation"" (though some data sets show a halt in warming), but the term implies ""cessation"" to those who haven't followed the literature.  Regarding the rest of your comment, we saw a warming period from ~1910 to ~1940, then a slight cooling period from ~1940 to ~1970, then another warming period from ~1970 to ~2000.  Temperatures since then have been increasing more slowly.  Those who think we can warm more in 75-85 years than we have in the last 105 years (since the 1910 warming period started) assume that positive feedbacks will accelerate warming.  It is the question of feedbacks, in my opinion, that is really at the center of the whole debate."

We have scientists who still don't know all there is to know about the human brain, but when someone goes to a doctor with a headache, we know enough that we generally can tell why that is.  The climate is very much the same way.  CO2 levels haven't been this high in a really long time, I think like hundreds of thousands if not millions of years?  We know it's a GHG, we know things are warming, we put the two together and the debate rages on :)   Global sea level rose about 17 centimeters (6.7 inches) in the last century. The rate in the last decade, however, is nearly double that of the last century.4 All three major global surface temperature reconstructions show that Earth has warmed since 1880.5 Most of this warming has occurred since the 1970s, with the 20 warmest years having occurred since 1981 and with all 10 of the warmest years occurring in the past 12 years.6 Even though the 2000s witnessed a solar output decline resulting in an unusually deep solar minimum in 2007-2009, surface temperatures continue to increase.7 The oceans have absorbed much of this increased heat, with the top 700 meters (about 2,300 feet) of ocean showing warming of 0.302 degrees Fahrenheit since 1969.8 The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass. Data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment show Greenland lost 150 to 250 cubic kilometers (36 to 60 cubic miles) of ice per year between 2002 and 2006, while Antarctica lost about 152 cubic kilometers (36 cubic miles) of ice between 2002 and 2005. Both the extent and thickness of Arctic sea ice has declined rapidly over the last several decades.9 Glaciers are retreating almost everywhere around the world — including in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska and Africa.10 The number of record high temperature events in the United States has been increasing, while the number of record low temperature events has been decreasing, since 1950. The U.S. has also witnessed increasing numbers of intense rainfall events.11 Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the acidity of surface ocean waters has increased by about 30 percent.12,13 This increase is the result of humans emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and hence more being absorbed into the oceans. The amount of carbon dioxide absorbed by the upper layer of the oceans is increasing by about 2 billion tons per year.14,15 Satellite observations reveal that the amount of spring snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere has decreased over the past five decades and that the snow is melting earlier.16   References   IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, Summary for Policymakers, p. 5 B.D.

In 1896, a seminal paper by Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius first speculated that changes in the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could substantially alter the surface temperature through the greenhouse effect.

Spatial patterns in sea-level trends mainly result from nonuniform ocean warming and salinity variations , although other factors also contribute, including the solid Earth response to the last deglaciation and gravitational effects and changes in ocean circulation due to ongoing land ice melting and freshwater input. Spatial patterns in ocean thermal expansion are not permanent features: They fluctuate in space and time in response to natural perturbations of the climate system; as a result, we expect that the sealevel change patterns will oscillate on multidecadal time scales   More importantly:   tide gauge measurements available since the late 19th century indicate that sea level has risen by an average of 1.7 ± 0.3 mm/year since 1950. Since the early 1990s, SLR has been routinely measured by high-precision altimeter satellites. From 1993 to 2009, the mean rate of SLR amounts to 3.3 ± 0.4 mm/year  , suggesting that SLR is accelerating."
climateskeptics,3at76g,MillenFalc,2,Wed Jun 24 21:03:44 2015 UTC,"Unpersuasive.  1) We are still rebounding from the Little Ice Age that ended in the late 1800's. Of course sea levels will rise in response to that natural variation anomaly and in general since the beginning of the current interglacial period.  1a) You know better than trying to use the last 10 years as an indicator of a trend. Doing so is cherry-picking at its finest.  2) Of course it has warmed since 1880, a whole 0.8 degree C in 135 years. The reason is recovering from the LIA.  2a) This is a red herring. Global warming ended 18 years ago and temperatures have remained unchanged since then. Every year has the chance of being the ""hottest year ever"" due to noise in the temperature signal when temperatures are unchanging on average. You neglected to mention 2014 was ""the hottest ever"" by 0.01 degrees C while the error bars exceeded +/- 0.05 degrees C. That's not a record I'd write home to brag to mom about.  3) Yes. The magical heat that passed through the atmosphere unnoticed and lodged itself into the ocean depths where it cannot be measured. Somehow it will raise itself on the figurative 7th day and wreak havoc on the Earth. If you believe that then you also believe the Moon is made of green cheese.  4) Keep up with the news. Greenland is frozen over, it's nearly July and they have yet to have a spring melt. Antarctica has the greatest sea ice extent in recorded history and they are moving into winter. When you hear hoofbeats, think horses before you think it's zebras. Everything says I t's getting colder in the polar regions.  5) That's plain disingenuous. You neglected to mention Antarctica while mentioning Arctic sea-ice extent which calls into question your seeming impartiality.  6) Is Mt. Kilimanjaro ice-free yet as was predicted? Have the Himalayan glaciers collapsed as predicted? You don't mention the enormous Hubbard glacier in Alaska which is advancing by leaps and bounds.  We are still coming out of the LIA when villagers in the Alps prayed for God to intercede and stop the advancing glaciers destroying their settlements. Of course they are receding, what did you expect them to do?  7) Forget the ""acid oceans upset my tummy"" campaign. It never got traction in the in the '80s, '90s and it hasn't gained any in this century. The reason is no evidence offered makes a compelling case it is harmful in any way.  8, 9, 10) There is so much factually wrong information here that I'm getting bored to rebut it point by point so I'll conglomerate these.  Daytime high temperatures are decreasing, Northern hemisphere winter snow cover is increasing, what you call ""extreme weather"" events are decreasing, tornado events are decreasing as are land-falling hurricanes in North America. Spring is arriving later and fall is arriving earlier.  Alarmists need alarming things happening to promote the political payload of global warming. Things just aren't going your way while the rest of us enjoy the benign climate we are experiencing."
climateskeptics,3at76g,Lucifuture,2,Thu Jun 25 11:25:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response, I'll try and address each based on what I've found through research, cool?  1 - The main drivers of the Little Ice Age cooling were decreased solar activity and increased volcanic activity. These factors cannot account for the global warming observed over the past 50-100 years. Furthermore, it is physically incorrect to state that the planet is simply ""recovering"" from the Little Ice Age.  1a - I don't think the point was to draw a trend from the 10 year span, but to point out that the last 10 years were simply the hottest on record.  Also, add another 8 years and it does become a trend according to the point made about no warming since 1998.    2 - Addressed in response to 1  2a - I think it's too soon to draw the conclusion that global warming has ended.  The ""no warming since 1998"" point  relies on the spike in temperatures generated by an El Nino event.  If you use this as a starting point, the trend is definitely flat, but if you move your starting point forward one year, or backwards two years, the upward trend becomes very obvious.  It's too soon to say global warming has stopped, and while I'm glad we can agree that 10 years does not a trend make, I'm disappointed to see that you think only 8 more years does.  I'm not sure how long we need to establish a trend when it comes to something so massive and complex as climate, but surely it's more than 18?    3 - The data comes from Levitus et al 2012.  I've read a lot of comments from respected members of this thread who cite that paper.  I think you might be standing alone in refuting it.  4 - I'd really like your take on this graph:  http://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/land-ice/  From what I can tell, there are periods that the ice appears to bounce back a bit, but overall the trend is clearly a recession of ice rather than new ice being added.  I think we agree that 10 years doesn't make a trend, so why would a slight uptick in ice one year make a trend?   5 - A few things I remember about the Antarctic, and I'm curious what a sound rebuttal is:  First, because of the melting Arctic and other ice sheets, there's a lot more fresh water to turn into ice in the Antarctic.  That sounded like BS to me, but is it possible?  Second, the ice Antarctic gains in the winter melts away entirely each summer, and it's the summer melts that are alarming scientists because land ice that has survived hundreds of thousands of summers is now melting away.  This is ice that was not in the water already, but accumulated on land, which means the melting of this ice adds to the sea level whereas the melting sea ice doesn't (I think you may have heard the analogy of ice in a glass of water melting and not raising the levels.)  The second point is what gives me pause.  How can really old ice like that be melting in the summer when it hasn't in such a long time?  6 - This is a point made about what has already happened, not what others have predicted, and it didn't state that all glaciers around the world are receding, but almost all.  When you think about it, it makes sense that not all would be receding as more moisture is in the atmosphere.  What do you think about the findings here?  http://www.geo.uzh.ch/microsite/wgms/  6a - The little ice age reference I guess can refer to point 1 on my list.  7 - The evidence stems from these four sources:   http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/co2/story/What+is+Ocean+Acidification%3F http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/co2/story/Ocean+Acidification C. L. Sabine et.al., “The Oceanic Sink for Anthropogenic CO2,” Science vol. 305 (16 July 2004), 367-371 Copenhagen Diagnosis, p. 36.   I'm still on the fence about ocean acidification myself, but the evidence does at least seem compelling so I guess I at least lean towards it being a viable point to make.  Do you have data that shows the opposite is true?   Daytime high temperatures are decreasing, Northern hemisphere winter snow cover is increasing, what you call ""extreme weather"" events are decreasing, tornado events are decreasing as are land-falling hurricanes in North America. Spring is arriving later and fall is arriving earlier.   8, 9, 10 -  Nighttime temperatures are on the rise according to:  https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/cei/graph/2/03-05  Extreme weather events are on the rise according to: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/cei/index.html  Overall snow coverage has decreased, and snow melt comes sooner according to: http://nsidc.org/cryosphere/sotc/snow_extent.html    Alarmists need alarming things happening to promote the political payload of global warming. Things just aren't going your way while the rest of us enjoy the benign climate we are experiencing.   This is the second time now you've called me an alarmist.  Is it ok to just start calling you a denier then?  I'm at best a ""warmist"" in that I acknowledge the data but am skeptical on the projections.    I'm not sure your list of rebuttals here would hold up to scientific scrutiny if a joe shmoe like me can come up with stuff..."

We find that 66.4% of abstracts expressed no position on AGW, 32.6% endorsed AGW, 0.7% rejected AGW and 0.3% were uncertain about the cause of global warming. Among abstracts expressing a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming. In a second phase of this study, we invited authors to rate their own papers. Compared to abstract ratings, a smaller percentage of self-rated papers expressed no position on AGW (35.5%). Among self-rated papers expressing a position on AGW, 97.2% endorsed the consensus. For both abstract ratings and authors’ self-ratings, the percentage of endorsements among papers expressing a position on AGW marginally increased over time.

This is why I don't bitterly complain that they started during the coldest year in the last 80.  But... it's clear that the ice would have been growing from about 1945  until 1979, and then began to reverse.  Really, though, the ice didn't start actually shrinking until after 1990, and it was back to 1970s levels by 2013.  If it falls a bunch this year, the 2015/2106 winter, then we can call the last year or two of growth a fluke, but if it stays where it is, or even grows more, then it appears that the anomaly is the low years, not the normal ones."
climateskeptics,3as8da,Florinator,6,Tue Jun 23 21:37:34 2015 UTC,"""No sea ice loss"" clearly indicates a massive decrease in sea ice, which is caused by AGW. The way climate science is properly done is to start with a conclusion and next find evidence to support that conclusion. Any evidence found that is not in agreement with the conclusion can be dismissed (on the grounds that it doesn't agree with the conclusion.) There is obviously no point in doing any research that conflicts with the credence of AGW theory because that would be in disagreement of the foregone conclusion, you will be burned at the stake, and may god have mercy on your soul.  By the way, what is the probability that an AGW model makes accurate predictions? 5%? maybe 10%? That is close to a 90% failure rate. This is what people call ""Science."""
climateskeptics,3as8da,WarmBidet,2,Tue Jun 23 05:37:17 2015 UTC,"Oh I agree there is no massive decrease. At most they are stating 5%? But hardly the ""No ice on the caps"" that was predicted by gore or ""Children won't know what snow is"" predicted by some other wanker.     But simply taking the mean from 1979 to now doesn't indicate much if the trend does not continue (upwards) or plateau, though as mentioned going from 1979 (the end of the cold age) is in itself selecting a point in which ice was at its height and basically has nowhere to go but down.     So while we did loose ice, it appears that it might be returning again. Which is not really all that surprising as these things tend to happen in cycles."

Not only did that not remotely happen, but global sea ice returned to values from 30 years before.  And apparently WaPo ran an article about this, and the federally-funded twats said then that if we hold them to their predictions this shows an ignorance of science. That they had slightly overestimated and it wouldn't be until 2015 that Arctic sea ice would disappear.  Well, guess what?

climateskeptics,3aqncz,Disingenuous_,2,Tue Jun 23 05:03:35 2015 UTC,With regard to climate change the question should be about the rate of growth. Was this glacier growing faster before AGW? While definitely still growing 'steadily' has it slowed down or sped up at all? The article doesn't really make this clear.
climateskeptics,3aqncz,lostshakerassault,8,Tue Jun 23 01:45:07 2015 UTC,"... before AGW?   There has been no GW for over 18 years and the amount of 'A' in AGW has never been determined, most likely because it is so minor. What Alarmists cannot come to terms with is we have a benign climate driven by NV that is still rebounding from the LIA and their much hoped-for CAGW just isn't in the cards."
climateskeptics,3aqncz,logicalprogressive,0,Tue Jun 23 08:11:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, there has. The oceans have increased in heat content by over 10 billion billion kilojoules of energy over the last 20 years.

climateskeptics,3aqncz,thepaperskyline,2,Wed Jun 24 07:34:57 2015 UTC,I see you are using Joules instead of temperature. Could it be because the temperature change is pathetically small?
climateskeptics,3aqncz,logicalprogressive,0,Wed Jun 24 14:24:10 2015 UTC,I see you have no understanding of heat capacity or how much water is in the ocean.
climateskeptics,3aqncz,thepaperskyline,6,Wed Jun 24 15:57:17 2015 UTC,"As mentioned, AGW has never been quantified and there is currently no indication of GW due to lack of heat rising in the troposphere (where it would be getting caught if it was being caused by greenhouse gasses).     That said we were rising out of a ice age somewhere between 1300 and 1870 and in the great scale of things may still be.  So I think it would be more relevant to compare growth historically over a few thousand years if possible to build a good comparison between post and pre industrial growth and compare to a previous warm period such as the medival optimum or Holocene optimum."
climateskeptics,3aqncz,kriegson,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:01:23 2015 UTC,"Again instead of shotgun blasting my comment with irrelevant arguements against AGW, try to stick to the topic if you are replying. I said AGW. If you don't like the AGW hypothesis that is fine, but we all know what I was talking about. We don't need to read stuff about the troposphere when AGW is mentioned with respect to something entirely different.   If we need to look at thousands of years, as you say, how is your post about 100 years of a single glacier suddenly relevant? This article then doesn't support either arguement as my comment said. If you have an arguement as to why the article is relevant to global climate change I'd love to read it."
climateskeptics,3aqncz,lostshakerassault,3,Tue Jun 23 14:40:14 2015 UTC,"If you have an argument as to why the article is relevant to global climate change I'd love to read it.      If we were actually experiencing the projected temps with unprecedented warming and claims that glaciers are melting (implying they will not return) and apocalyptic affects like the ice caps will be gone, I would think glaciers would not still be growing.     In other words this article runs contrary to alarmist notions.      Alternatively, if one was curious we might be able to actually determine something useful by reconstructing the glacier and comparing it to previous time periods in which we were leaving an ice age."
climateskeptics,3aqncz,kriegson,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:55:33 2015 UTC,"I see, so when this glacier fits your argument you suddenly don't require a thousand years of data. Again, as I said in my original comment the issue is the rate of change, not growing or melting, which is not mentioned in the article. Perhaps this glacier was growing at 10km/day until recent climate change. Maybe it has been accelerating. More importantly, maybe, is that this is a single glacier and perhaps doesn't reflect any global processes at all. None of this is addressed in the article, and I think my point still stands that it does not support either argument.  If you are going to spend time learning about this complicated and broad topic I have found it is important to evaluate what you are reading. There is a lot of crap out there, like this article. (Although the Hubbard Glacier is clearly interesting in itself even if it doesn't say anything about climate change.)"
climateskeptics,3aqncz,lostshakerassault,3,Tue Jun 23 15:42:18 2015 UTC,"I see, so when this glacier fits your argument you suddenly don't require a thousand years of data.       I don't need to prove I'm right, I simply need to prove they are wrong. That's the nature of peer review in a scientific study. If someone claims god exists, I don't need to prove an alternative, I just need to prove you don't have sufficient evidence to indicate your hypothesis is correct.      At any rate, this is evidence against proclamations of ""unprecedented warming"" that AGW is based upon. Along with a sea ice mean over the last few decades that has actually risen on average, record levels of antarctice sea ice, no rising oceans below 2000 meters (indicating no heat hidden within them warming the cooler areas) and no rising heat within the troposphere, these are all indicators that the hypothesis of unprecedented warming caused by humans creating irreparable damage to the environment is false.     That's all I need, to prove the projections do not match the real world data."
climateskeptics,3aqncz,kriegson,0,Tue Jun 23 15:51:24 2015 UTC,Still not understanding my point about the rate of change? There is no inconsistency if the glacier's growth has slowed down. Right? The article does not address this. Agreed?
climateskeptics,3aqncz,lostshakerassault,3,Tue Jun 23 16:36:04 2015 UTC,"OLI landsat 8     All that is mentioned is that it is ""Steadily"" growing and indications show it may grow further than it has in the past.      Twice in the past hundred years—in 1986 and again in 2002—the moraine has made contact with Gilbert Point and blocked the entrance to Russell Fjord. With nowhere to drain, runoff caused the water level in the fjord to rise rapidly.      One estimate suggests that the fjord could permanently close by 2025. But Hubbard’s terminus is nearly 14 kilometers (9 miles) wide, and does not advance at the same rate across its entire width. The region adjacent to Gilbert Point, where the closure would occur, advances more slowly because seawater passing through the gap constantly erodes the ice. Based on the current rate of advance at the gap, Stearns estimated that closure could occur by 2043. Stearns cautions, however, that these closure dates are “projections based on our current observations, and should be viewed with skepticism.”       Nowhere has it mentioned speeding up or slowing down, the rate can't be measured uniformly. All we can conclude (unless you can provide something to the contrary) is that it will continue to grow steadily."

climateskeptics,3ant4d,deck_hand,3,Mon Jun 22 17:47:14 2015 UTC,"OP's post is not ""wrong"" but it's not the same thing as knowing what is happening on a global scale.  OPs post is not actually a serious claim that the US experience means that the whole world is cooling, or that one data set trumps the data for the rest of the planet.    It's really just a bit of snark, saying, ""warming, what warming?  We're cooling"" and using the US data set as ""evidence.""  It does bring up questions of the accuracy of current temperature assessments, and whether or not the claims of ""hottest temperatures EVAR"" are true, or are they fabricated with careful selection of temperature sources and/or adjustments of the record to ""prove"" the theory they have been championing for 35 years.   It's not the same thing as the LIA or the MWP, because we see evidence of it on numerous continents.   Yes, we do have that evidence.  So why, when those were brought up as evidence that temperatures might not be unusual, some of the climate scientists who lead the charge and set the original tone of the scientific push for Climate Change denied that a) we had any evidence that the two periods even existed and b) that the LIA and MWP were just regional fluctuations in weather, and we had no proof that they were global in nature.  The Climate Scientists who insist that we must dramatically change pretty much everything in our society to prevent any more change in temperature, and that if we don't act now, Climate Change will destroy life as we know it are the ones who tried to disappear the MWP, because it was inconvenient. They tried to insist that a handful of trees in Siberia were a more accurate estimate of temperature than hundreds of years worth of actual observations across the planet, bore-hole proxies, spelothem proxies from caves all over the planet, and written testimony on things like first frost, frozen rivers, number of growing days, etc.   Okay, you obviously don't know much about academia   How many science degrees to you have?  We can compare, if you wish.  I have spent the last 30 years spending time with, comparing notes with, etc. family with PhDs.

So for younger academics who can easily be crushed by poor peer review scuttling your papers, there absolutely is very strong incentive to go with the consensus or be out of work sooner or later.  It's a pretty stark choice. Particularly in climate science, where we've seen what they do to people who stray from the accepted line. Anyone who thinks young up and comers don't pay attention to all that is kidding themselves.   So when activists trot that one out... well, that's what activists do, work to create the impression that reality is something other than it is.  Nobody wants their career to evaporate because they went against the grain. Nobody. And the boys at the top... They run this business like the mafia these days.

You are a slave to the academic system until you get tenure, a grant large enough to get a salary, or private enterprise. This is true across all of academia.  They don't give tenure or grants to anything/anyone that is the slightest bit controversial.  Private enterprise doesn't really do public research, except google and a handful of other mega large corps.  In the field of climate science... It's ONLY grants and university post doc research groups.

climateskeptics,3akion,moirende,6,Sun Jun 21 21:11:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think it is worth the time and effort to go through the list point by point.  Juxtaposing of ""climate myths"" and ""what science says"" is (or, at least, should be) an insult to anyone who graduated high school.  Science is not an entity that can speak; it is individual scientists and scientific organizations that do.  ""Science says"" is an acceptable figure of speech when we are dealing with results of replicatable experiments (as in ""Physics says""), which is not the case with climatology or sociology.  So the trick that the people who created the list (and/or use it as reference) used (and keep on using) was to take the opinion of certain scientists and dismiss the opinion of everyone else because they are not true scotsmen. Good case in point is this survey of consensus that included meteorologists:  http://skepticalscience.com/AMS-meteorologists-97-percent.html .  As you can see, not anywhere close to 97% as long as we do not survey a very narrow, carefully selected group or ""experts"".  And discussing the track record of the aforementioned group of ""experts"" is akin to flogging a the dead horse."

If Archiesmears or any other activist truly believes that list is representative of the truth then they are delusional. If they understand it for what it is and use it anyway, they are dishonest snake oil salesmen. Neither is particularly flattering, but that's the choice you make when you decide to become a propagandist for a hobby."

I do recognize that many of the so called developed nations tend to level out and the population tends to slow to a steady state on their own, without government regulation needed.  Universal education, access to birth controls, etc. seems to be good enough to fix the problem.  People like to have sex, and children are the consequence of sex if the parents did not take actions to prevent pregnancy from occurring.  People eventually learn that more children means more demands on the resources of the parents, and for a better life, fewer kids are better.  I'm not sure the massive number of ""undeveloped nations"" will develop fast enough to keep overpopulation from becoming a real problem.  Wars and famine will punish the nations where the people allow the population to outgrow the resources available to support them."

Ehrlich:       Paul Ralph Ehrlich (born May 29, 1932) is an American ecologist and demographer, best known for his dire warnings about population growth  and limited resources. He is the Bing Professor of Population Studies in the department of Biological Sciences at Stanford University and president of Stanford's Center for Conservation Biology.  Ehrlich became well known for his controversial 1968 book The Population Bomb, which asserted that the world's human population would soon increase to the point where mass starvation ensued.   Among the measures he suggested in that book was population control, to be used in his opinion if voluntary methods were to fail. Ehrlich has been criticized for his views; for example, Ronald Bailey called Ehrlich an irrepressible doomster.  On the other hand, Carl Haub observed that Ehrlich's warnings had encouraged countries to take action to avert disaster.  Ehrlich has acknowledged that some of what he had written had not come about, but has restated his view that over-population remains a major problem.

It's not a constant perfect temp all the time.  During sunspots, heat output increases. On a cloudy day, it's cooler.  You would think that with all the clouds, you would trap so much heat, it would be warmer.  Clouds do trap heat, nights with cloudy sky's are warmer then clear nights.

If that is the case then Laurent Cousineau is advocating his own Facebook page be banned for duplicitous self-bias.    Laurent Cousineau makes many claims. One of his most disturbing claims is that claiming a right to free speech is ""complete nonsense."" He points to examples of false advertising and  dangerous speech acts using speech to create unnecessary panic (Schenck v. United States 1919) to back up his claim.  A single data set can lead to multiple and sometimes contradictory theories. A climatologist looks at the set of data and says ""Yes, this is sufficient to draw a conclusion based on the evidence I see. Yes I believe that CO2 is the cause of the rise in global temperature."" Meanwhile another climatologist would look at the data and say ""No, this is not indicative of cause and effect. CO2 clearly lags behind any temperature change, so we're dealing with some other phenomena that maybe isn't understood with great precision yet."" In Laurent's opinion, offering an alternative explanation or dissenting opinion is what qualifies as ""complete nonsense"" and is not protected under free speech. Next by NOT acknowledging "" ... that over 100 million people will die because of climate change in less than 20 years"" apparently indicates some type of culpability to views that do not tout AGW theory, in other words if you are in a crowded theater and ,it may or may not be on fire, but you don't yell ""Fire!"" then you would be guilty of something. But the only obvious thing here you would be guilty of is not buckling under the pressure of these accusations.

I understand what you're referring to because it's something I first learned about back in high school.  That's not meant as some jab at how old the talking point is, quite the contrary.  It's a very fascinating point to make.  It's a point that that takes into account the role water vapor plays, which is a feedback, not a forcing, and is also isolated to the bottom layers of the atmosphere.  CO2 exists uniformly at all layers of the atmosphere, and by far the planet's temperature ultimately depends on the atmospheric level of carbon dioxide.  As to human CO2 emissions in comparison to natural emissions - natural emissions are also absorbed by processes that have settled after many thousands of years.  The relationship between how much CO2 is emitted naturally and how much is absorbed naturally is a balancing act.  Human emissions of CO2 has no counter-balance, and so it lingers year after  year sending CO2 levels upward.  That's the role human beings have to play on the greenhouse effect."
climateskeptics,3aek8s,WarmBidet,13,Fri Jun 19 17:04:08 2015 UTC,"by far the planet's temperature ultimately depends on the atmospheric level of carbon dioxide.   That is incorrect. By far the planet's temperature ultimately depends on the amount of solar radiation is receives. The CO2 level doesn't change at night vs. daytime and yet, nights are cooler than days.   Human emissions of CO2 has no counter-balance, and so it lingers year after year sending CO2 levels upward.   Think about it, where does the CO2 come from? Fossil fuels. How did it get there? Plants and animals extracted it from... the air! All this CO2 we're emitting through the burning of fossil fuels was in the air at some point. And yet, there was no runaway greenhouse effect, earth didn't turn into Venus. Speaking of Venus, check this out. I think he's a bit of a looney, but I can't find anything wrong with his math/physics."
climateskeptics,3aek8s,cosmic_punk,-2,Fri Jun 19 17:21:03 2015 UTC,"That is incorrect. By far the planet's temperature ultimately depends on the amount of solar radiation is receives. The CO2 level doesn't change at night vs. daytime and yet, nights are cooler than days.   No, it's correct.   When solar rays enter the atmosphere they create a byproduct called Beryllium-10.  Looking at ice core samples, climatologists can see periods of great spikes in Beryllium-10 with no corresponding changes in global temperatures.  Yes, night time temperatures are cooler than daytime temperatures, but CO2 and the greenhouse effect is why we don't have a temperature difference of 500F like the moon does.  To expand more on night time temperatures as well, since you brought it up, they are on the rise.  This is a telltale sign of increased CO2 levels as less heat energy escapes at night.     Think about it, where does the CO2 come from? Fossil fuels. How did it get there? Plants and animals extracted it from... the air!   Fossil fuels represent plant matter going back sometimes over 650 million years.  We're talking about CO2 trapped in a system that has existed for eons.    All this CO2 we're emitting through the burning of fossil fuels was in the air at some point.    Some point being millions of years ago during prehistoric climates, and given the time frame fossil fuel deposits can represent (sometimes spans of many millions of years) surely you can take some pause at the notion of burning through those deposits in the matter of a few hundred years at best.   And yet, there was no runaway greenhouse effect, earth didn't turn into Venus.   Earth has any number of things that makes it special to us and one of those things is in fact climate change.  Milankovitch cycles, changes to Earth's orbit, attribute to almost all climate change cycles in the past.  Even if the planet got to 1000ppm with our atmosphere composition, eventually sheer orbital influences would some day return the planet to an ice age, sending CO2 spiraling downward, because CO2 cannot compete with such forcing.    When it comes to how bad things can get, I don't want to wait until our CO2 levels match something not seen in eons.  Even past higher concentration of CO2 had other higher compositions of thing like Oxygen which balanced the heating effect of CO2, so comparing to prehistoric climates isn't even all that accurate in the unique climate composition we are creating."

That's because CO2 isn't the cause of those instances where temperatures rose, changes in Earth's orbital pattern are, but orbital changes only attribute so much to the warming effect as CO2 takes over as the main driver of temperature.  Earth's orbit changes, things warm, life thrives, CO2 levels go up.  Earth's orbital change levels out, yet temperatures continue to rise.  By changing the planet's state to something warmer, more habitable for life, CO2 levels naturally increase and further contribute to the greenhouse effect."

The regression coefficient between global RT and tropospheric temperature becomes −2.98 W m−2 K−1 if water vapor effects are removed, slightly less than expected from blackbody radiation (−3.2 W m−2 K−1), suggesting a positive feedback from clouds and other processes."

The shorter waves when moving upwards can be partly blocked by molecules like H2O and C02.  [Note that -unlike real greenhouses- there is convection - nothing is trapped].  the trillion dollar question hinges on   is this more important than natural variability? the effect is not linear, but how logarithmic is it? is public policy effective?   In my very limited opinion CAGW is BS. That C02's properties are less important than natural variability.  How can this be? well, because the profession of climatology is full of cr**.

Lysenko’s opponents were imprisoned or killed. Nina Teicholz’s book The Big Fat Surprise shows in devastating detail how opponents of Ancel Keys’s dietary fat hypothesis were starved of grants and frozen out of the debate by an intolerant consensus backed by vested interests, echoed and amplified by a docile press.   Kinda sound familiar?   Saw much of this same phenomenon anytime I questioned the robustness of the evidence in support of the Big Bang Theory. ~10 years ago I got entranced by cosmology after finishing my math degree, back when universities still pretended to teach people to question everything, and that was my first encounter with this kind of rebuke. No matter which community of cosmologists it was, big or small, the second I made any reference to doubting the BBT as ""fact"" it was like I had to walk the plank.  The capitulation of 'Everything far away is shifted a little towards longer wavelengths, that's enough for me on that whole origin-of-the-universe debate!' has always felt incredibly disturbing. Of course it could be true, even most likely, but isn't it kind of important to be sure first? Isn't that what the definition of science is; the search for truth? I thought that if you are to base the entire future of the entire field of science on this quite radical assumption, perhaps it should be more thoroughly tested. But it was like nobody wanted to even think about it being false because of how much other science now depended on it. Since the field was just a hobby, I had no vested interest, and every attempt at discussion immediately became a personal attack, I just said ""fuck it"" and gave up caring what the truth was, which is what I bet most climate alarmists are banking on.  What's ironic is that there are now finally increasingly sound theories suggesting alternatives to the BBT that are getting at least a modicum level of respect & consideration. So, astro-physicists (who are driven to explain everything, which makes them extremely resistant to 'starting over') have shown enough openmindedness & humility to allow the consensus to be debated.  ... but global climate science? A far younger field of science? Full speed in the opposite direction, straight to 'We know everything, the debate is over, now hand over all the keys'."

There is no way we will see a 5 degree temperature rise in 100 years.  http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut4/data/current/web_figures/hadcrut4_annual_global.png   Even the 2C figure predicts more than a meter’s rise in sea levels by 2100   Funnily enough that is not occuring either.  http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadsst3/data/HadSST.3.1.1.0/diagnostics/Figure_5_colour_globe.png  The only factual thing in the whole article is that nothing of value will come out of the Paris accord."

climateskeptics,3acj38,e-socrates,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:50:04 2015 UTC,"I just brought up deaths because it brings to the forefront that it is a serious issue. The real way you measure heat waves is through things like the probability/frequency, high temperature, and length of the heatwave.  ""Here, we review the evidence and argue that for some types of extreme — notably heatwaves, but also precipitation extremes — there is now strong evidence linking specific events or an increase in their numbers to the human influence on climate."" (Coumou & Rahmstorf, 2012)  ""We can state, with a high degree of confidence, that extreme anomalies such as those in Texas and Oklahoma in 2011 and Moscow in 2010 were a consequence of global warming because their likelihood in the absence of global warming was exceedingly small."" (Hansen et al., 2012)  In regards to the 2010 Russian heat wave I mentioned there was ""a three-fold increase in the risk of the 2010 threshold being exceeded, supporting the assertion that the risk of the event occurring was mainly attributable to the external trend."" (Otto et al., 2012)  "". . .worldwide, the number of local record-breaking monthly temperature extremes is now on average five times larger than expected in a climate with no long-term warming. This implies that on average there is an 80% chance that a new monthly heat record is due to climatic change."" (Coumou, Robinson, and Rahmstorf 2013)"

climateskeptics,3acj38,RobAlter,0,Sat Jun 20 02:50:28 2015 UTC,"I'll give you a serious reply since I was being a bit of a dick there. I agree that if you have a region of warm air next to a region of cold air, the warmth will drift just do the the concentration gradient. Warmer atmosphere also heats up land, ice, and water due to temperature imbalances. But the Earth isn't heated evenly due to greenhouse gases. There is more heating at the poles, for instance. The places where greenhouse warming occurs can also disrupt wind patterns because it changes concentration gradients of temperature which drive things like wind and precipitation. So you can get regional funneling of heat that will then dissipate to surrounding areas. This heat may even come from some other region which makes that region colder than it otherwise would have been. That is why you can have regional places like Siberia experiencing up to ten degree Celsius warming where another place like the Eastern US might be getting record cold. Like I said, weather is very complicated."

climateskeptics,3acj38,donaldosaurus,0,Sat Jun 20 05:27:52 2015 UTC,My guess would that there would be less overall differences in temperature since you have the poles heating up much more rapidly than the equator. But I don't really know enough to give you a good answer to that question. Sorry.

climateskeptics,3acj38,Kelly_jernigan,4,Sat Jun 20 02:49:41 2015 UTC,"The theory is that IR leaving the ground at the speed of light is captured on the way up and half of it is redirected back to the ground.  This transaction takes place in thousandths of a second; generally in the amount of time it takes for a molecule of CO2 that has been moved into an excited state by absorbing a photon of light to bump into another molecule (99% likely a nitrogen or oxygen molecule) and release a photon of IR in a random direction because of the collision.  The ""surface warming"" that occurs due to that theory is because of localized warming, because some IR comes back to the surface instead of escaping to space.  In order for the heat to be transported anywhere else, it first has to be realized locally.  It is entirely possible that additional CO2 above the Southeast section of the United States (where, apparently, we create more extra CO2 than anywhere else) is adding extra heat locally, and that heat is being ""whisked away"" before our thermometers can measure it, and instantly transported to Siberia.    It's also possible that cool air from somewhere is rushing in, and would normally have cooled our little corner of paradise to abnormally low temperatures, but that cooling has been perfectly matched for 5 or 6 decades by the rising heat generated by the awesome amount of extra CO2 we generate here.  I find it unlikely that such a coincidence has happened for such a long time, keeping the temperature in perfect balance like that, while wildly warming other places.  You believe in fairy tales, such as the ability of CO2 here to warm the air 5000 miles away, or the idea that IR from a few hundred meters up in the air can warm the ocean depths between 700 and 2000 meters, while the water between the surface and 700 meters is cooling.

If you take the Indian ocean out of the mix, how much is the rest of the world's ocean, 0 to 700 meters down, warming?

Communicating the strength of scientific consensus (Ding et al. 2011 ; Maibach et al. 2014 ; Van der Linden et al. 2014 ) might be most helpful as a heuristic for those without much science knowledge or strong preconceptions. More detailed information including science-based response to counter-arguments could help those with some science knowledge already and openness to learn more. Certain websites (such as RealClimate.org or SkepticalScience.com) do this well, as do outreach-engaged scientists communicating through varied media from conventional news reports and op-eds to videos and science cafes. To make inroads against the hyperscepticism among ideologues noted by Kraft et al. ( 2015 ), more culturally tailored approaches (Kahan 2015 ) probably are needed.    http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/1088937X.2015.1051158   this one is clearly more relevant than Kahan   This one is not more relevant... it's just the first to come up with a politically correct conclusion.  It also wasn't even a poll... It cherry picked questions from existing polls.  The purpose of this study was to test existing polling data to determine the best ""culturally tailored"" questions to elicit the best outcome FOR the consensus.  It's obvious to see how that make this study useless as non biased valid polling data... given that the purpose is literally to figure out which, of the most culturally biased questions, will result in a predetermined polling result.  To quote the study...    Alternatively, a climate-knowledge scale might be constructed with a deliberate balance of questions that intuitively appeal to opposing climate-change beliefs (e.g. Kahan 2015 ). For example, instead of asking about late-summer Arctic sea ice compared with 30 years ago (falling), we might ask about midwinter Antarctic sea ice compared with 10 years ago (rising). Facts can be selected to form ‘ gotcha ’ questions in either direction. The meaning and correlates of such an offsetting-bias scale would be controlled by the mix of questions selected by the researcher, however, limiting its interpretation. Our simpler, neutral polar-knowledge scale bypasses this limitation and thus offers a different window on biased assimilation."

So, there was a huge age group that was on the Al Gore train back then, and all of them had the same outlook on it.  Now, I;m sure it was not just the Al gore movie that made them turn to the religion, but they had to be taught it somewhere.  Then came the videos of professors and teachers pushing their ideas...

I would think the only direct comparison you could make would be something like birds killed by oil spills (Direct cause) vs birds killed by wind farms (Direct cause).      For the gulf oil-spill it looks like estimates range from 7k to 800K. I would have to dig around a bit to see if they have any concrete number...but then you have to consider this is an accident, not a direct result of drilling oil, but rather an unintended consequence of a disaster.

climateskeptics,3aat3r,kriegson,0,Thu Jun 18 23:19:32 2015 UTC,"Sats and balloons show no warming in the atmosphere.    That's false.  Atmospheric temperatures continue to rise according to rss and uah tlt readings.   Global warming goes by the theory of green house gasses preventing energy from escaping the atmosphere, but said atmosphere has not warmed.   Nighttime temperatures are up, which is a telltale sign of the greenhouse effect.     So where is it then? They claim it's in the ocean now!    The ocean absorbs something like 93% of the heat energy compared to atmosphere and surface which absorb a small fraction of the heat.   Though measurements below 2000m indicate there is no sea level rise in the lower, cooler portions of the ocean (Which would be expanding if heat was being stored there)    Yes, ocean heat content has increased, that's established fact.   never-mind all the physics issues you would run into proclaiming that the ocean can absorb all of the heat from the atmosphere in a matter of a few years (on the milti million year scale that is our climate, that's a few moments)   I don't even know how to address that, frankly.  I just cringe at the thought of someone telling an actual climatologist they don't understand the physics of the globe's climate mechanisms as if that person didn't dedicate their lives to doing just that...    and the fact that we have had higher levels of carbon and heat before mankind even existed   Yes, orbital changes called Milankovitch cycles almost always triggered climate change in the past.  Orbital changes that warm the planet would cause more co2 to be released, and eventually co2 takes over as the cause for rising temperatures.    If carbon = heat exponential, why did it cool? And why did it cool with temp leading carbon by hundreds of years, each cycle?   Co2 is no match for changes in esrth's orbit.   Just a handful of things off the top of my head.

climateskeptics,3aat3r,JRugman,3,Fri Jun 19 13:18:49 2015 UTC,"Sure! In fact I also saw another post of yours I think (windfarms and birds) requesting sources and posted some  sources pertaining to it. Warmists tend to deny date that we provide and refuse to show their own,   I have another post covering the basics, lemme find that and paste it over.      Here's some of the sat/balloon data indicating a tiny amount of warming since 1979, no where near what was projected (.4c per decade iirc?) Feel free to compare anomalies to the mean. Consider between 2003 and 2015, no warming.      NOAA's ""pristine"" land data set in places where development wasn't expected for a few hundred years, so you're basically looking at raw data. No adjustments needed. You actually get a slight cooling trend.      And it's not in the ocean either You might wonder what the sea level rise has to do with ocean temp.      Warming of the deep oceans, however, would cause thermal expansion of the deep oceans and add to sea level rise [called steric sea level rise]. The authors examined several datasets including satellite altimetry, ARGO floats, and the GRACE gravitometer satellites, and find that the thermal expansion of the deep oceans and contribution to sea level rise is ""negligible,"" and thus, there is no evidence that the alleged ""missing heat"" ""trapped"" by greenhouse gases has somehow sunken to the deep oceans. In addition, the ""missing heat"" is also nowhere to be found in the upper oceans, nor the atmosphere (because in reality it was lost to space as increased outgoing IR radiation over the past 62 years).   The authors find the sea level budget of total sea level rise is ""closed"" with ""negligible"" contribution from the deep ocean, thus no warming or thermal expansion from the ""missing heat"" in the deep ocean can be accounted for: ""...the sea level budget is closed when using the CCI, AVISO and NOAA data. Hence, in these cases, the deep ocean (below 2000 meters) contribution is negligible.""       Now that aside, consider we have had higher carbon levels before, sans humans. Stating there is warming since 1880 or the 19th century is cherry picking considering we were (and possibly are) still coming out of an ice age. You have to look on a much longer scale if you want to see natural variability. See the vostek ice cores and stomata records | source.     Vostek can show us how carbon actually lags behind temp when it comes to changes for hundreds of years, time and again. Further, carbon remains after temp starts to fall, and then follows. Wouldn't it be the other way around if carbon was a driver/amplifier?      I have an actual study for stomata elsewhere...but a pretty signifigant bit we can determine from Stomata is some pretty recent fudging of carbon data      Callendar claimed humans had increased CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels, and had thereby changed the atmosphere from 274 ppmv to 325 ppmv by 1935-- resulting in a 18.3 percent increase which had caused the global surface temperature to rise 0.33 deg. C (5). However, CO2 data available at the time showed concentrations ranged between 250 ppm and 550 ppm (Figure 4). Callendar has been accused of cherry-picking data from a sampling of 19th century averages, using 26 that supported his ideas, but rejecting 16 that were higher than his assumed low global average, and 2 that were lower (6).       Ultimately carbon is not a significant driver of warming or amplifier of it in our climate.      Also, a lot of warmists are playing along with the recent NOAA K15 study, claiming there never was warming by cooling the past and warming the future a bit and giving themselves .12c adjustment area to do it in (Ocean surface temps).     This disseminates that study and the problems within it. Until this study many were weary of acknowledging the pause, but were still trying to claim ""Once the pause ends it'll be much worse!"". Even IPCC V (as mentioned in the paper) acknowledged the pause.      Some see K15 as definitive proof that ""defeats"" the skeptics which is what makes it so popular, it claims the pause never existed. Though  K15 makes adjustments that virtually no one else has. So either the IPCC, NASA, British Oceanic Institute and numerous other warmist scientests are wrong or K15 is wrong.         Most of us believe the planet is warming (We are leaving an ice age after all) carbon can create heat, we emit carbon. That's where the debate begins though: Carbon has been higher in the past, temps have been higher in the past. So what is driving the climate? To what degree do we have a part?      ""The science.."" is certainly not settled. There is no 97% consensus that AGW is the one and only affect that could warm the planet (A whole nother can of worms, do have sources for that too :3) , and that it is dangerous. Those who seek to shout down, demean and bully the other side into silence don't have the world's best interests in mind.     Edited some grammar."
climateskeptics,3aat3r,kriegson,-3,Fri Jun 19 14:23:20 2015 UTC,"Because of all the data we have against it.   Do you have a source for this data?   Sats and balloons show no warming in the atmosphere.   That's incorrect. There's been a consistent warming trend measured over multidecadal time scales since the 19th century.   Global warming goes by the theory of green house gasses preventing energy from escaping the atmosphere, but said atmosphere has not warmed.    That's not a theory. Satellite measurements of radiation leaving the top of the atmosphere provide empirical evidence of the greenhouse effect, and shows that the amount of energy being trapped in the climate system continues to increase."

climateskeptics,3a8lg5,TheFerretman,-5,Fri Jun 19 20:23:40 2015 UTC,"This person is a complete imbecile.    CO2 is essential to life on earth and whilst plant thrive if CO2 levels increase, they would die if CO2 levels in the atmosphere were lower. In other words, we can’t afford to see CO2 levels drop, but in contrast, there are huge benefits to world food production from rising CO2.   They would die if we lowered CO2 levels?  400ppm is something the planet hasn't seen in something like 20 million years, I'm pretty sure if it lowered the plants wouldn't die, they would do fine.  As far as food production, I'm pretty sure flooding doesn't bode well with crop development...   CO2 levels have varied massively in the past and apparently with very little impact on climate.   Absolutely not true at all.  Orbital changes called Milankovitch cycles have almost always been the sole cause of climate change in the past, but the change in CO2 levels as a result then drive the climate change further.  When orbital changes result in a warming, CO2 increases which continues the warming long after the orbital change.      CO2 levels change significantly over the ice-age cycle. A naive observer might conclude that changing CO2 levels caused the cyclic temperature change, however the evidence is that CO2 levels change after something else causes the temperature to rise or fall.   Yes, that something else is a change in Earth's orbit.   CO2 is what is falsely called a “greenhouse” gas (false because greenhouses work in a different way). CO2 changes the properties of the atmosphere so that (in theory) we should see an increase in surface temperature when CO2 levels rise. But the effect is very small with a theoretical contribution amounting a fraction of a degree so far – in other words, much smaller than the natural changes we know are happening. And whilst CO2 levels are tending upward, it is generally accepted that on its own even doubling CO2 levels would only causes somewhere between 0.6-1.2C of warming.   It's called a greenhouse gas because, like any gaseous compound in the atmosphere that is capable of absorbing infrared radiation, it traps and holds heat in the atmosphere.   The climate is a complex system, and periods of invariability don't suddenly reverse the properties of the CO2 molecule.  To understand how sensitive the climate is to carbon dioxide on time frames of a century or less, scientists also study the transient climate sensitivity. They imagine that carbon dioxide will continue to increase at roughly the rate it has been, and then ask how much warming would be realized around the time when the concentration has doubled the preindustrial value.  On this shorter time scale, it’s likely the planet will warm between 1° and 2.5°C (2°-4.5°F).    The difference between transient and equilibrium sensitivity comes from the fact that some parts of the Earth system—mountain glaciers, sea ice, precipitation—react within years or a few decades to a warming or cooling nudge. Others—including ice sheets, permafrost, and especially the deep ocean—respond sluggishly, sometimes taking centuries to overcome the inertia of their previous state.   That is the only actual “science” in this subject. And contrary to the repeated and intentional lies told to the public about us sceptics, this science is accepted by both sceptics and alarmists.   Sceptics?     CO2 levels have been rising. As Prof Salby has demonstrated, much of this change is likely natural.   No it isn't.  We know it isn't.  Carbon 12 exists in all plants.  Carbon 13 comes from gasses emitted from the planet, like volcanoes and such.  Carbon 14 exists in all plants but is slightly radioactive and decays almost entirely after fifty thousand years or so.  Carbon 12 is what's on the rise, meaning the burning of very old plants is to blame.  Fossil fuels.   However some of it is likely due to humans. But even if all the change were human, it would at worst, double the levels of CO2 which has no harmful impact on any plants, animals and the worst anyone can say is that it would slightly lower the alkalinity of sea water (something that happens daily in the sea when CO2 levels build up over night).   Most of it is, given our fingerprints are all over it, and this stupid fuck just advocated for sending CO2 to levels not seen since the Paleocene epoch.  Fuck this guy and his complete stupidity.  He claims he's just a ""sceptic"" then clings to denier talking points that are so old and refuted I was in high school when I last heard someone say this shit with a straight face."

Take a look at other gas concentrations.  Oxygen acts as a counter effect to CO2, and while CO2 WAS 800ppm, Oxygen levels were far higher as well.  Introducing 800ppm CO2 without any of the other properties of the ancient climate could be disastrous.  It isn't even the CO2 that's the end problem, it's the frozen stores of methane in the tundra that would be released that's the end problem.    Y U so mad, bro?

climateskeptics,3a70bv,Florinator,3,Thu Jun 18 06:13:12 2015 UTC,"Which ""Fact""? Most scientists do believe humans have a factor in global warming, but that's the key word. ""A factor"". The degree of which is still under debate.     But the ""97% consensus"" is thrown around implying that everyone agrees that AGW is 100% man made. The consensus is derived from several studies, but off the top of my head:     97% from cook: He took papers (not scientists) even without explicit standings on AGW and simply created two groups. If the paper did not quantify or endorse AGW or alternatives, it was put in the ""Denier"" category.     Everything else was put into the ""Consensus"" category. Ranging from a paper from deforestation in china affecting the red panda, to crop gains and everything inbetween. If you actually go through the papers and attribute them properly, you get Something like this. The graph is referring to the link on it, going here which properly attributes each study used.      As you can see, only .5% endorse and quantify AGW from the horse's mouth itself.      Two other studies were as I recall, one which was a survey of some 2000 scientist at an event. That event being IPCC (obviously biased) and 2000 being a insignificant number among literally tens of thousand scientists including engineers who would know a thing or two about heat transfer.       The other one was an online survey in which they sent out 10K surveys but only received 3K responses (Which they admit is normal for a survey, but still seem to think makes this a useful study) with only two questions:     Has it been warmer since 1880 on average.    Do you think mankind has a significant affect on warming the climate. Of the participants only something like 77 were verified as scientists.            At any rate, find me a ""Consensus"" study and I'll probably be able to find an issue with it.      Check the sidebar here. We agree that C02 causes warming, we have contributed C02 and that it has been warming (Albeit recently paused for nearly 2 decades). The debate is how important of a factor carbon is, how much warming can we attribute to mankind, and how can we rationally react."

I can't take you seriously because you can't even get the very basics right.  This is the very first sentence from the Skeptical Science article about the paper.   A new survey of over 12,000 peer-reviewed climate science papers by our citizen science team at Skeptical Science has found a 97% consensus among papers taking a position on the cause of global warming in the peer-reviewed literature that humans are responsible.   And here's the abstract from the paper.   We analyze the evolution of the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming (AGW) in the peer-reviewed scientific literature, examining 11 944 climate abstracts from 1991–2011 matching the topics 'global climate change' or 'global warming'. We find that 66.4% of abstracts expressed no position on AGW, 32.6% endorsed AGW, 0.7% rejected AGW and 0.3% were uncertain about the cause of global warming. Among abstracts expressing a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming. In a second phase of this study, we invited authors to rate their own papers. Compared to abstract ratings, a smaller percentage of self-rated papers expressed no position on AGW (35.5%). Among self-rated papers expressing a position on AGW, 97.2% endorsed the consensus. For both abstract ratings and authors' self-ratings, the percentage of endorsements among papers expressing a position on AGW marginally increased over time. Our analysis indicates that the number of papers rejecting the consensus on AGW is a vanishingly small proportion of the published research.   ""expressing a position..."".  Please start getting better information."
climateskeptics,3a70bv,ChaeDoc_II,4,Thu Jun 18 14:01:42 2015 UTC,"First off, you completely ignored the dissemination of cook's consensus, if that's what you are referring to. Secondly, you need sources and citations. Preferably peer reviewed, otherwise you're just aruging hearsay. If the skeptical science source is actually a peer reviewed study, please link it.     That said, If you accept skeptical science as a valid source, then you should accept watts up with that and their sources on the subject.     I'm not trying to gallup here, but as you can see there are a number of peer reviewed positions.      For instance however:     A claim has been that 97% of the scientific literature endorses anthropogenic climate change (Cook et al., 2013. Environ. Res. Lett. 8, 024024). This claim, frequently repeated in debates about climate policy, does not stand. A trend in composition is mistaken for a trend in endorsement. Reported results are inconsistent and biased. The sample is not representative and contains many irrelevant papers. Overall, data quality is low. Cook׳s validation test shows that the data are invalid. Data disclosure is incomplete so that key results cannot be reproduced or tested.

Edit:   and the ocean is getting more acidic   No, it's not. The oceanic pH is around 8.2. Everything above 7 is alkaline, everything below is acidic.

And since we're on the subject, you can't have warmer oceans and less alkaline oceans at the same time.

I don't think you understand my point; Here is ELY5: you can't have a warmer ocean and a more acidic because of extra CO2 absorbed ocean at the same time.   I actually would prefer if we stuck to ELI5 lol  Anyways I think they're saying the ocean's acidification has gone up as it has absorbed CO2, but as the climate warms and the oceans begin to warm, we're now facing an added problem of CO2 from the oceans now contributing to the CO2 levels rather than taking away.  I think you're being a little too declarative?  is that a word?  In how you say the oceans should work.  What I mean by that is you're declaring that if it's not doing this in excess, then it isn't doing that in excess, but you're ignoring what state the oceans are actually in with regard to this transition.  I feel like I'm talking out of my ass mostly, but isn't it possible that even though our oceans are warming, they're still cool enough that the excess CO2 in the atmosphere is contributing to acidification first?"
climateskeptics,3a2nus,Muffy1234,3,Wed Jun 17 18:47:06 2015 UTC,"Cooler water can store more CO2 than warmer water. So the oceans can't be warming and absorbing CO2 at the same time. If they stay at the same temperature then yes, they could absorb CO2 which would affect the pH. But here is the thing, we don't have global measurements of pH. In fact there is a very controversial study that left out massive amounts of pH data because it didn't fit the conclusion.

We know they are warming though, and we know the oceans absorb CO2.  If there's excess CO2 to absorb, and the climate is warming, that would explain both happening.  It's sort of like yeah ok, colder water can absorb CO2 better than warmer water, but that doesn't mean that the warmth the oceans have experience will undo the amount of CO2 being absorbed right away, which  could also be increasing due to our output.  I am rather appalled at the lack of clear concise data on PH levels though.  No data should be ever thrown away just because it doesn't fit consensus, so that's the part that appalls me basically, not having data since someone got rid of it etc.  With regard to ocean acidification,   wouldn't excess CO2 in the atmosphere, as in more CO2 to absorb, contribute to more being absorbed in the first place?"
climateskeptics,3a2nus,PPCheese,5,Wed Jun 17 21:13:00 2015 UTC,"we know the oceans absorb CO2   No, we don't really know. We think we know. Look at this map provided by NASA's OCO2 satellite that went live last year:  http://www.earthmagazine.org/sites/earthmagazine.org/files/2014-12/PIA18934_0.jpg  NASA's own observations are quite difficult to reconcile with the ""accepted science"". It appears that the rain forests are net producers of CO2 as well as the oceans. Why are there so many hotspots over the oceans? And barely any in the industrialized world, which is supposed to be the biggest CO2 contributor? The only hotspot that matches the expectations is China. Some of the oceanic hotspots (below the Kamchatka peninsula) could be explained by volcanic vents bubbling up CO2, but how about the rest?"
climateskeptics,3a2nus,TheFerretman,0,Wed Jun 17 21:30:03 2015 UTC,"This map is interesting, one thing I do notice is that it looks like just south of the equator there is a nice line of high CO2 concentration, while just north of the equator there seems to be a lower concentration of CO2. Could this be due to shifting monsoon rains? This leads to the only problem I have with this map, which is that the period of time for which the measurements were made is only a month long and not over the entire year. This means that we do not get a full picture of how the concentration of CO2 behaves throughout the whole year.  On a side note, was this when they had all those fires in Malaysia? Because there is a lot of CO2 in that area."

climateskeptics,39z0vu,Muffy1234,-2,Wed Jun 17 01:37:41 2015 UTC,"What natural physical process caused the little ice age in the first place.   Most likely solar variability. The LIA coincided with the Maunder Minimum - a period of very low solar activity. We know that solar variability isn't responsible for the current warming because it's activity has been dropping for the past few decades, as global temps have been rising.   The simplicity of your counter statement ignores the historic variations and demands all new change is caused by man.   Not true at all. Most of the field of climate science is concerned with understanding the natural processes that have caused climatic change in the past.   What level of contribution is yet to be established and the failure of models to come close to the actual is pathetic.   Actually, it's very clear that the contribution of human activity to the warming since 1950 is at least 50%. The models we have now are accurate enough for us to be taking their results seriously.   Mild increase, I would look to the lower variation models with error margins and take another 5-10% off. So I would be looking at 0.1dC globally for the decade providing the Hansens of the world do not revisit the information and modify it.    How much would you be prepared to bet on that prediction?   As for skeptical predictions, this side of the industry is insufficiently supported and constantly denied government funding and so are not in the position of producing models that will only reflect expected natural variations. So why would you bother.    Why do you think that climate modelling can only be done with government funding? Why do you think that 'skeptical' predictions that only reflect 'expected' natural variations do not benefit from government funding? Surely if this information has value then there should be a market for it, allowing for private sector solutions? Indeed, there are plenty of initiatives currently working towards improving the private sector's involvement in climate modelling, especially when it comes to forecasting long term impacts."
climateskeptics,39z0vu,blueishgoldfish,4,Wed Jun 17 11:48:14 2015 UTC,"The facts are simple, we have no idea of solar activities for any accurate historical record and so we cannot place a bias or effect on this. We have no accurate sea temperature levels prior to 2003 when they finally fixed the Argo project and we have only the information from satellites with many holes in the data due to thermometer calibration issues that are well documented.   The models are crap and the reason for the demand for a government funded series of development for a more realistic models construction is because those who are of the AGW advancement crowd insist that any privately funded research is biased and thus cannot be accepted. Your lot scream about Big Oil and Big coal and then deny any research from them as valid. It has been done and it has been checked and then your side go and say that the research is invalid because an i was not dotted. Meanwhile you use pamphlets from Green peace and claim a high confidence in the research.  This is the problem of your creation and thus the only solution is to employ a group independent of the destructive confirmation bias that exists within the zealots of AGW and to work with the intent of natural path prediction. That you demand funding from government and scream down any attempts to provide similar funding to the counter discussion is typical of those who know that they are presenting a house of cards. Here you have demanded I place a bet on my prediction and yet you have not placed your position as the counter point to be true.  This is called arguing the false hypothesis, You are demanding from the intelligent side of the argument a firm position and then leaving yourself all the unclaimed ground as validity for your argument. That is not science it is basic social engineering and highlights that you are trying the accuse the accusers tactic to revert responsibility of the failure of your position to demand a single point of success from your opponent. You will then utilise any minor variation to claim victory even though your original and the documented position still has failed to reproduce the results. Even though the IPCC position is not valid, you somehow believe that you have invalidated your opponent. This again is not science and to demand as such shows that you are trying to argue the false rather than support the true case of the hypothesis. This is not science and by not proving something does not make the alternate case correct. All it does is prove both cases have missing information to make the position accurate.  Mind you if you believe that citing an article that then cites the author (who is not a climate researcher but does have qualifications in Philosophy and Political Science) as support for their own position is actually really pathetic. This is why the AGW side struggles, because you frequently cite people with qualifications severely lower than the qualifications of those who argue against you and then somehow believe a Canadian employee of an NGO is somehow more knowledgeable. It is a pathetic attempt to claim validity of position and hope that the reader does no further research on the author in question. It is really pathetic and weakens your position."

climateskeptics,39z0vu,ascylon,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:15:25 2015 UTC,"That's the whole idea of making a bet. You don't know how emissions are going to change in the future. But if you think that the impact of human emissions on climate is negligible, it makes no difference which emissions pathway you choose, since they will all be as inconsequential as each other. So you might as well go for the lowest.  Personally, I'd consider making a bet on model results from the RCP4.5 scenario, at least until 2045. I'd hope that emissions would turn out lower than that, but without some major global upheavals in the next couple of decades I'd say that overall emissions are going to continue rising for some time yet. After the 2040s is when the different pathways start to realy diverge significantly.   You can bet on the lowest RCP scenario, then claim victory if emissions follow RCP 8.5.   Only if you're betting against a sucker. You'd want to set out the conditions of the bet in advance to make sure all eventualities are covered fairly. But as I said before, if you think human emissions have no impact on global temps, then whether emissions follow RCP2.6 or RCP8.5 shouldn't make any difference."
climateskeptics,39z0vu,SkepticalDad,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:26:41 2015 UTC,"How about this.  We bet on the model results that actually follow emissions.

If they fall to another RCP scenario (like 4.5), we choose the model ensemble from today that projected warming based on that scenario."

Instead of calling you a denier, what I'll call you is a critic.  There are those people who are responsible for trying to educate the public about public health problems and then there are critics.  The educators have a huge responsibility to try to communicate with the public about things that science tells us are problematic.  Examples include educating the public about sexually transmitted diseases, vaccines, seatbelt safety, the economy, climate change, and much more.  They always have incomplete information and they will always make mistakes in trying to communicate with the public.  Their intentions are pure.  And on the issue of climate change they are using the absolutely best scientific evidence we have to inform the public.  Most of the science says that climate change is happening and humans are contributing to it.  Relatively little evidence exists to refute this.  And so public health educators have to try to tell people that all of this is a big problem.  Critics get to sit back and have no responsibility for public actions but point out all of the mistakes that are made, usually ignoring the underlying weight of evidence for the claims being made.  Would you rather have them say ""well, we can't tell you exactly what's going to happen, so do whatever.""  ?

The rate of warming was quite ordinary in 1970-2000, it was ordinary whatever time period you choose.  In any case, the point is that we never bothered to argue with ""the consensus"" because there are several -- the original survey as described in Wikipedia eight years ago, the opinion of ""the experts"" (the survey that included meteorologists), the Lewandowski paper, etc.   Their intentions are pure. And on the issue of climate change they are using the absolutely best scientific evidence we have to inform the public   Absolutely best scientific evidence?  Really?  How much does it take to ask the following question:  ""In regard to your claim about the excessively rapid rate of warming, what exactly is the current rate of change, in degrees per decade?  How does it compare to the rate of change (in same units) throughout the period we have temperature records (past 120 years)?  How does it compare to the proxy-reconstructed record?""  It doesn't take much to establish that the currently observed climate change is within natural variability.

So if we can get that carbon number down then we can rest comfortably knowing that we've done all we can do to offset the impact of human activity.  But if that number keeps going up, then we go into the unknown.  The unknown, literally, means that we don't know what could happen.  It could mean dramatic catastrophe or something else.

And screw you for claiming that I'm pretending like I think we're headed for the most extreme climate in the earth's history -- the ENTIRE point of all of this is that we're potentially headed for a time where, yes, massive numbers of people could be displaced and the global ecology could rapidly change (and weather becomes more extreme, killing more people, causing more property damage, etc....)  Further, different species have come and gone at different climates -- many go extinct when climates change.  So the earth's ecology dramatically changes when the climate changes.  And how it will change -- we just don't know.  And at least previously though the change happened very gradually and naturally.  Here, it is happening in part because of how we are using energy sources (fossil fuels) -- so in this case we are both the cause of the accelerated change AND we (some of us) are aware/accepting of the fact that we're causing it.  And so it's happening more rapidly than it has in the past.

What many news networks - and people in that matter - did was took the most extreme model for predicting ocean rise and published it as if it was news.

The boat ramp down the block from me used to have a ramp that you had to drive down to get your boat in the water, now the water is always at the top of the ramp.  The cesspools in the neighborhood are now always full of water and cesspools need to be raised into little hills.  The local beach is visibly not as wide as it used to be 10 years ago, the waterline is much closer to the steps that lead down to the beach.  I know it's not just my area too, I was doing insurance adjusting for my job and I would see other locations that had similar situations.  One autobody shop I dealt with had to relocate.  It's not just one occurrence, these conditions most certainly did not exist like they do now, and we have never had a storm like Sandy in the past.

The one that has been wrong over and over again, the one that keeps ""adjusting"" temperatures in the past to make the current day appear warmer? The one that predicted using computer models things that keep failing to come true (see: no more snow, more extreme weather etc). There's a difference here between denying science - which you seem to believe many do - and pointing out that it fails to live up to the word science. Science stops being science when one is told not to question it and accept the ""consensus""   What if I told you that allowing the CO2 level in the atmosphere reach 1000 PPM would allow plants to grow better? What if I told you that when CO2 levels fall below 150 PPM plant life begins to die out?  What if l told you that far less people die due to hot weather than cold? What if I told you that the climate we are in now - where the mean temperature is ~14C - is actually considered cold? (The average world temp has varied between 12 and 22 C in the past). What if I told you that we had warming that does not at all line up with the ""consensus"" that CO2 drives temperature change and that in the past we actually had cooling in times where CO2 increased? What if I told you that CO2 makes up less than 1% of the atmosphere and is only responsible for roughly 3% of all warming and that water vapor is responsible for nearly all of the rest and that modeling water vapor is very difficult in all computer models?    what to do   In your opinion what should we do? Should we give the government even more power to control literally every aspect of our lives in some vain attempt to ""stop"" climate change, something that will not ever stop? Should we get rid of capitalism, something that has made the world far better than before and allow ourselves to be controlled, because ""the climate is changing in ways that it hasn't in the past"" Past being recorded history."

Science denial is going to hurt the GOP,    I agree, but ignorance of history and science is also hurting liberals.  Making claims that can be shown to be false in minutes does not help you, or your cause.  Yes, sea level rise is a thing.  Warming contributes to sea level rise, and as the sea rises, coastal floods will inevitably become more common.  The question is not ""will warming cause more damage due to flooding?"" because that's obvious.  It's even obvious that if it continues to warm, the seas will continue to rise.  What you need to know is that the Atlantic is not continuing to warm.  It's actually starting to cool off, and the North Atlantic is cooling faster than the rest of it.  A large part of the issue you, in the New England states, are having with sea levels is not due to warming, at least not directly.  It's due to the speed of the North Atlantic Circulation.  The Gulf Stream moves a lot of water north and east, and the faster it moves, the more water it sucks away from the coast.  It's slowed down a bit in recent years, possibly due to fresh-water melting into the sea.  That slowing as reduced the pull on the coastal waters, and allowed the seas to come up when compared to the land.  So, long term we have sea level rise due to thermal expansion and glacier melt, and short term we have more sea level rise due to something other than thermal expansion.    So, yeah, sea level rise is an issue for you, but temporary flooding once every couple of years isn't what was discussed or shown by the predictions referenced in 2008.  They were talking about permanent sea levels being higher than the streets of Manhattan.   The claims were exaggerated.  Admit it."

And they feel just as justified banning and downvoting people there that go against the grain of the sub as we do here. I don't have a problem with that.  If people want to go somewhere to try to make a difference or change people's minds, there are lots of subs that would be good for that. R/skeptic was long ago colonized by climate alarmists and could do with some alternative voices beyond old climate_control doing yeomans work there. R/energy is another.  But if anyone does, also remember: the decks are stacked against climate skeptics at those subs and there are a number of participants who clearly engage in outright vote manipulation and widespread sock puppetry. So you will have a rough ride.  I do not advocate doing the same in reverse. I do not advocate going to those places and starting arguments for the sake of it. Those kinds of behaviours are just as counterproductive there as they are here.

climateskeptics,39t3s0,lcd_monitor,0,Sun Jun 14 23:22:32 2015 UTC,"You skirted the question. If ""bias"" is the problem, why is Wattsupwiththat okay?"
climateskeptics,39t3s0,logicalprogressive,8,Mon Jun 15 03:14:08 2015 UTC,WUWT is the world's most visited website for news and information on climate. Their content is known for being free of the pervasive leftist propaganda and misinformation that afflicts most other climate related outlets.
climateskeptics,39t3s0,nimbuscile,2,Mon Jun 15 03:40:08 2015 UTC,"Actually, this is a point worth talking about. Who gets to decide what bias is? I'm pretty sure the subreddit system is implicitly designed to maintain biased content by encouraging like-minded people to construct echo chambers. Likewise, WUWT is explicitly a climate-contrarian website. It's a gathering of like-minded people, and its content is often scientifically questionable (not saying other sources aren't scientifically questionable - we're just using WUWT as an example here).  As an example of the problem with bias arguments, I've heard people argue media institutions like the BBC are both right and left-wing biased. They clearly can't be both!   I think it would be better not to judge information by its source like this. Of course, it's fine to interpret information in light of its source. For example, if I read something on WUWT I know it will come from a particular viewpoint, and interpret it accordingly. I will also do some fact-checking. I'd do the same for some of the stuff on SkS. Regardless of the activism at SkS (like their stupid 'atomic bombs' measure of global warming and their fixation with 'deniers'), some of their science pages are rather good (their guide to representative concentration pathways, for example)."
climateskeptics,39t3s0,Will_Power,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:08:56 2015 UTC,I've heard people argue media institutions like the BBC are both right and left-wing biased.   Really?  The Beeb?  I'm surprised at that.
climateskeptics,39t3s0,nimbuscile,2,Tue Jun 16 20:46:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not, and here's my point. I guess you'd probably be surprised that people think it might be right-wing biased. The argument goes that it actually gives voice mainly to pro-big-business views and actually gives more time to the Conservatives than the Labour party. At least in its news coverage. I suspect people say it's left-wing biased because it is compared to the - in my view - mainly right-wing print press in the UK. The particular bias depends on a lot on the choice of programme in the BBC though. I'm not here to argue whether it's biased one way or the other - just that objectively demonstrating bias in media is pretty difficult."
climateskeptics,39t3s0,Will_Power,2,Tue Jun 16 21:39:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, good point.  Someone in /r/energy some time ago (I wish I would have bookmarked the comment) noted how schizophrenic even The Guardian can be, decrying global warming in one article, then talking about all the great holiday destinations that were only a plane ride away the next."
climateskeptics,39t3s0,nimbuscile,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:37:05 2015 UTC,"I think the most important thing is to think about the way in which every source may be biased, rather than having a conception of biased and unbiased sources. I don't think a complete lack of bias is even possible. We just need to be appropriately sceptical (;)) and address the arguments of each source in its own context rather than writing off the source entirely."
climateskeptics,39t3s0,lcd_monitor,0,Wed Jun 17 06:52:14 2015 UTC,"Oh, so now the argument is ""it's not biased if it's the most visited!!!!""""  Yawn.

If that's the kind of person you want to get your science information from, then fine, but don't complain about your back hurting when your manual labor job starts to wear on you.

The tide rose 13 feet in one hour and inundated wharves, causing the East River to converge into the Hudson River across lower Manhattan as far north as Canal Street. However, few deaths were attributed to the storm because flooding was concentrated in neighborhoods with far fewer homes than exist today.   Hurricanes are a natural phenomenon that have been happening long before we started emitting CO2.  Also, I think the ""sea level rising"" is what was suppose to cause New York to be under water."

Exactly what is the ""settled"" agreement on ECS, for instance.  I will not argue that warming has not occurred.  That's not a theory, it's an observation.  I will not argue that CO2 has gone up. That's an observation, not a theory.  I will not argue against the idea that CO2 absorbs and emits infrared radiation, since this is also an observation, not a theory.  I will not argue that mankind has been responsible for some, perhaps most of the rise in CO2. There is good, reliable evidence that this is the case.  It's not an observation, but a conclusion based on good evidence.  I will question the accuracy claimed by alarmists about the current ""anomaly"" of temperature as differentiated from several points in history, since we have poor data today, and worse data 50 years ago, and even worse data 75 years ago.  The data from 1000 years ago is purely a guess based on third hand proxies, and the error range is likely to be large.  There are a good number of scientific papers (peer reviewed!) that show that todays temperature is not significantly different than the temperature of 1000 years ago, nor is it significantly warmer than the temperature of the Roman Warm Period, the Minoan Warm Period, or the Holocene Climactic Optimum.  So, forgive me if I suggest that agreement with the ""broad strokes"" of AGM is not enough to shut down discussion."

climateskeptics,39g36b,RabidRaccoon,11,Thu Jun 11 15:28:37 2015 UTC,"I agree, and have something that might add to this. Before mankind's rapid advance in emissions in the 1940s, the planet was warming by around 0.8ºC.  The Climate Scientists lead by Hansen and Mann have said that the warming from 1979 to 1998 (or 2003, if you prefer) was twice that rate (0.16º per decade) because of the extra CO2 in the atmosphere.  Or, more correctly, because the extra CO2 in the atmosphere caused the IR released by ground heat was slowed from escaping the atmosphere because it was reflected back to the surface by CO2.    Now, 35 years after the extra warming rate induced by that CO2, the rate of surface warming is still smaller than the rate they said we had in the 1980s.  For more than a decade, the massive amounts of IR being reflected back to the surface has failed to cause the surface to warm anywhere near what it did decades ago.  If we look at the ""long term trend"" we can see that acceleration is not happening.  In fact, over the last 30 years (a period where we can see climate in action) we see deceleration in rate of surface warming.    If we see half of the decades warming at 0.16ºC per decade, and half of the decades flat, the long term trend will be 0.08ºC per decade, exactly what the trend was from when we first measured it until the very beginning of the ""anthropogenic period.""  If we see 0.19ºC warming during the hot years, and 0.03ºC cooling during the cool decades, we still see about a 0.08ºC long term trend.  The science may be settled, and still be wrong.  If the science says that man-made CO2 is going to cause 4.5º of warming by 2100, I think time will show that the scientists who drew that conclusion were wrong."

Rather, I should say that we've only started getting good data very recently (last 10 years) ...  http://www.argo.ucsd.edu/  And there is indeed a problem with ""missing heat.""  Currrently it is assumed by Alarmists that this missing heat is hiding in the very deep ocean just out of range of the Argo floats.

climateskeptics,39ef0e,moirende,9,Thu Jun 11 12:56:50 2015 UTC,"The really interesting thing is that even with the existing data (the ones that show the lack of temperature change over the last 18 years), I've said for a while that ""global warming has not stopped.""  I say this because we've had two or three other flat periods of between 20 and 30 years, and then the temperature change begins again.  This, in my opinion, proves that the warming after 1979 was not new or different than the warming after 1910.  The ""hiatus"" after 2002 is not new or different than the ""hiatus"" after 1943.  They are the same, and if they are the same, then the change in CO2 levels are not the cause of the recent warming, and ""human produced aerosols"" were not the cause of the 1940s to 1970s hiatus.     The upshot of this is that I expect there to be no acceleration due to increased CO2 and increased atmospheric water vapor, over the approximately 0.8º C per century long term trend.  We'll have multi-decade trends of higher or lower, but if they don't move to the late 20th century levels and stay there, and move even higher, we're not going to see anywhere near the projected amount of warming.  Remember that 0.8ºC per century of warming that is our long term trend is 1.6º C of warming over pre-industrial times - well within the estimates of the IPCC, even though it completely violates all of the logic that they are using as to the cause of the warming.

You're literally the third person in a row I've conversed with in this subreddit to end a conversation because I'm just so unreasonable... Except, I'm not doing the unreasonable thing you claim I am.  I'm not saying one data set overrules all others, I'm saying a consideration of ALL data sets is the best way to go, the most recent consideration bringing into account these temperature readings, therefor the most recent consideration having a clearer picture.  The other data sets past papers who attempted to form hypothesis regarding the perceived hiatus are still very valuable as they provide all kinds of data to consider.   You seem to be looking for evidence to confirm of a belief, not trying to base your views on evidence.    Basing my views on evidence is exactly what I'm doing though when I take into consideration these new findings.  I know these debates get heated, but accusing someone of wanting the studies to find something like AGW is pretty low.  If anything I'm biased against what climatologists tell us, because my desire for it to all be a hoax is what drives my interest in the topic.   One paper is apparently all you need.   Yes, one paper with new findings is all I need to help shape my perception of what's going on.  That's how this works.  You know, I find it funny that for all the railing against the 97% figure regarding agreement among climatologists, when new data does come along that reshapes our perception, you fall back on the older research lacking in these figures because there were simply a number of papers written.  It's the epitome of argumentum ad populum.     This is simply not true. The landmark paper about ocean heat content is Levitus, et al, 2012. What it showed was the ocean heat content only represents a forcing change of well under one watt per square meter of ocean surface. The paper you love so very well doesn't overturn Levitus.   Doesn't overturn Levitus?  What does that mean?  It doesn't find that temperatures have risen since 2012?   I googled the paper just to look it over, but I was inundated with links to sites like Watts up with that which claimed the study was flawed.  In these new reports, one of the things they mention is that scientists have been misunderstanding the readings, a ""temporary glitch"" in understanding the data being collected."

This new paper doesn't show an increased warming rate at all.   The research found that the Earth continued getting warmer at a rate very nearly like that predicted by climate models throughout the first early years of this century. They concluded that overall global surface warming during 2000–2014 was 0.116°C per decade, more than twice the estimated 0.039°C per decade that IPCC had reported for the period beginning in 1998.   Levitus 2012 was a 50-year reconstruction. Why would ocean warming stop in 2012?   I didn't say it did.  I was simply asking you to explain what you meant by ""overturn""...

Is your argument that the scientists who published their findings never took the time to see they were already rendered invalid by a popular paper written 3 years ago?  That doesn't seem to be very logical to me, but if it's as you say, then improved data gathering techniques should help put that notion to bed.

My current understanding is the theory for a long time now has been that the Oceans were taking most of the warmth increase we are seeing and that's how its always been.  Explaining the pause != claiming it is real. We now have additional measuring points and that additional evidence appears to confirm there was no pause as was expected by the experts in question. Further, there has never been a measured pause in Ocean temperatures, but I'm sure you don't want to get into that."

climateskeptics,39h003,PPCheese,6,Thu Jun 11 19:08:03 2015 UTC,"Thats a study on sea level rise and possible errors in how it was reported.      I thought rising oceans were a constant threat of climate change?   Warming of the deep oceans, however, would cause thermal expansion of the deep oceans and add to sea level rise [called steric sea level rise]. The authors examined several datasets including satellite altimetry, ARGO floats, and the GRACE gravitometer satellites, and find that the thermal expansion of the deep oceans and contribution to sea level rise is ""negligible,"" and thus, there is no evidence that the alleged ""missing heat"" ""trapped"" by greenhouse gases has somehow sunken to the deep oceans. In addition, the ""missing heat"" is also nowhere to be found in the upper oceans, nor the atmosphere (because in reality it was lost to space as increased outgoing IR radiation over the past 62 years).   The authors find the sea level budget of total sea level rise is ""closed"" with ""negligible"" contribution from the deep ocean, thus no warming or thermal expansion from the ""missing heat"" in the deep ocean can be accounted for: ""...the sea level budget is closed when using the CCI, AVISO and NOAA data. Hence, in these cases, the deep ocean (below 2000 meters) contribution is negligible.""      ""This shows clear rises in temperature reporting, even when he fudges the graphs.""  You need to read, not just look at the pretty pictures. He's showing the IPCC data as compared to the K15 data. Of course the IPCC claims there is warming, but even they acknowledge the hiatus. K15 disagrees with the IPCC, and pretty much everyone else on the subject, making adjustments to the models no one else has done.    So either everyone else is wrong or K15 is fudging data."

This however wasn't what we were talking about. You're side stepping the initial claim that sea level temperature rise has not had any such hiatus.  The IPCC itself has never acknowledged a haitus in global warming. They are the first ones to point out that most of that heat is going straight into the oceans.  What next? Going to tell us about how ""they used to say it was going to be global cooling and a new ice age!"" because of one article in Time magazine 50 years ago?

Well let's see, you're twisting what it is I'm asking you to prove and  you're leaning on an obvious strawman about CO2 being the ""main driver of climate.""  If you went to the doctor and he diagnosed you with cancer, presented you with his evidence, made a compelling case, and then you went to another doctor for a second opinion, wouldn't you want that doctor to make a case for why you don't have cancer?  As far as CO2 being the main driver of climate, you forgot a word:  change.  CO2 currently is the main driver of the current climate change.  This isn't some universal rule that climatologists cling to in explaining past climates, in fact the main driver of climate change in the past has almost always been earth's orbital changes called Milankovitch Cycles.

You are so confident in that one paper, than you can't even wait to see the comments submitted to the publisher, or how it is treated in subsequent papers?   So really, #5 should be: How many of those 60 or so papers that pursued hypothesis around the hiatus actually were measuring the ocean's temperatures correctly?   You think all datasets only measure the ocean surface?"

You think all datasets only measure the ocean surface?   Well no! but now I'm confused.  Do all datasets show a hiatus?  I got a question, if this study holds up, and it means satellite data on the sky stands alone in an apparent pause, what would that tell us about the relationship between the sky and the sea?  Like maybe the top of the ocean is holding all this heat after all, but our atmosphere isn't warming like everything else is, or maybe even we are reading everything wrong.

Yes, the pause is widely acknowledged.  Go to Google Scholar and search ""climate pause|hiatus"" (without quotes, of course).   Do all datasets show a hiatus?   Some do, some don't.  OHC does not.

Go to Google Scholar and search ""climate pause|hiatus"" (without quotes, of course).   That didn't answer the question.  If someone is studying tree rings in Patagonia, are they seeing a pause?  Does EVERY piece of data feedback show us a pause, and this one small group has found it in the ocean only?   Some do, some don't. OHC does not.

The significance of this paper is that it adjusts ocean surface data, not land surface, not deep ocean, not atmosphere.   Ok that does answer my question lol.  Well from my understanding the significance of this is that the ocean absorbs about 90% of the heat.  Surface and atmosphere only absorb a small fraction.  I feel like their importance does get slightly overstated, but they are climate indicators none the less.    Also, I know we need much better temperature readings around the world.

That didn't answer the question.    It does, you just don't like the answer.  The terms ""pause"" and ""hiatus"" come from the peer-reviewed literature.   Well from my understanding the significance of this is that the ocean absorbs about 90% of the heat. Surface and atmosphere only absorb a small fraction.    You are correct.  Levitus 2012 says, IIRC, 93% of warming has been absorbed by the ocean.  It also noted at the oceans collectively warmed by 0.09°C over ~50 years, representing a change in global forcing of just 0.27 Watts per square meter of surface area.   I feel like their importance does get slightly overstated, but they are climate indicators none the less.   Ah, but here's the thing.  It is those areas that should warm first, followed by the deeper ocean.  If they are warming more slowly than expected, the OHC doesn't matter too much.   I don't believe ANY data set has actually showed a pause, however.   Sure they have.  Play with the various data sets here: http://woodfortrees.org/plot/  You'll note the surface data (HadCRUT, GISS) sets slowed in their rate of warming.  Atmospheric data (UAH, RSS) slowed every more, to the point of halting.   A slowdown, perhaps, but it hasn't stopped. warming that is.   A slowdown is exactly how the scientists defined the pause.  They never referred to the pause as a complete cessation.   When it comes to deep sea temperatures, are the finding even the deepest parts are warming?   Data below 2000m are very sparse.  I don't recall the paper now, but it suggested the lowest depths have cooled very slightly.  Keep in mind that temperature at depth changes very slowly and long after the changes at the surface.   Well they're gonna feel pretty stupid if this debate over this one paper's findings triggers all kinds of scrutiny and it turns out to be right.   Yeah, though that would only affect the ocean surface data set.  The others wouldn't be affected by the Karl, et al paper.   I've read about how they were/now are getting temperatures for ocean surface and I feel like they're in the right direction.   That surprises me.  The data Karl, et al used were from engine intakes on ocean vessels.  Those thermometers were not of scientific quality, in my opinion, and were subject to heat contamination from the vessel itself.  I will be very surprised if the paper stands up to scrutiny."

One time he humorously wandered off the topic saying:   You know, the most amazing thing happened to me tonight. I was coming here, on the way to the lecture, and I came in through the parking lot. And you won't believe what happened. I saw a car with the license plate ARW 357. Can you imagine? Of all the millions of license plates in the state, what was the chance that I would see that particular one tonight? Amazing!   To me, that's a core problem with climate science. We don't have another earth to compare against, and our dataset is arguably too short and filled with spacial and measurement inconsistencies. So the hypotheses and conclusions are bound to often be incorrect. But these very problems are exactly what those with an agenda can hide behind.  I would argue that this new conclusion about the hiatus never existing definitively proves that we absolutely do not know what we are looking for, nor do we have any reason to believe any conclusions we can draw from it. If you can say that it is or it isn't, simply by reading the data one way or another, how are we to know which way, if either, is correct?

If someone receives a subsidy from the government and their business fails, do they still get to keep the money, or do they have to pay it back when it fails?  For example, let's say I get the government to pay me $15,000 to make solar panels, and I invest $5,000 of my own money, so the company has $20,000 to start with. I sell two panels for a total of $10,000 back, it cost me $15,000 to make them, so I am $5,000 in debt in the end and therefore the company fails. However, of the $15,000 in cost, I paid myself $10,000 salary. The business went bankrupt and so $5,000 goes into the wind (presumably), because the business cannot possibly pay that back. Do I still get to keep the $10,000 salary that I paid to myself, giving me a personal end profit of $5,000?  Is there something I am ignorant of, or is this just legalized theft of the taxpayers? I am serious. Do they not have to be personally liable for the missing money from the subsidy?"

climateskeptics,39c6f3,logicalprogressive,2,Wed Jun 10 20:42:38 2015 UTC,"The article it refers to is a proposed refugees by 2020     Which is hilarious because the same claims were made before.   United Nations “Climate Refugees”  In 2005, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) warned that imminent sea-level rises, increased hurricanes, and desertification caused by “man-made global warming” would lead to massive population disruptions. In a handy map, the organization highlighted areas that were supposed to be particularly vulnerable in terms of producing “climate refugees.” Especially at risk were regions such as the Caribbean and low-lying Pacific islands, along with coastal areas.  The 2005 UNEP predictions claimed that, by 2010, some 50 million “climate refugees” would be frantically fleeing from those regions of the globe. However, not only did the areas in question fail to produce a single “climate refugee,” by 2010, population levels for those regions were actually still soaring. In many cases, the areas that were supposed to be producing waves of “climate refugees” and becoming uninhabitable turned out to be some of the fastest-growing places on Earth.  In the Bahamas, for example, according to the 2010 census, there was a major increase in population, going from around 300,000 in 2000 to more than 350,000 by 2010. The population of St. Lucia, meanwhile, grew by five percent during the same period. The Seychelles grew by about 10 percent. The Solomon Islands also witnessed a major population boom during that time frame, gaining another 100,000 people, or an increase of about 25 percent.  In China, meanwhile, the top six fastest growing cities were all within the areas highlighted by the UN as likely sources of “climate refugees.” Many of the fastest-growing U.S. cities were also within or close to “climate refugee” danger zones touted by the UN  Rather than apologizing for its undisputable mistake after being first exposed by reporter Gavin Atkins at Asian Correspondent, the global body responded in typical alarmist fashion: with an Orwellian coverup seeking to erase all evidence of its ridiculous predictions. First, the UNEP took its “climate refugees” map down from the Web. That failed, of course, because the content was archived online prior to its disappearance down the UN “memory hole.  Then the UNEP tried and failed to distance itself from the outlandish claims, despite the fact that the map was created by a UNEP cartographer, released by UNEP, and repeatedly hyped by the outfit in its scaremongering campaigns. Eventually, as more and more media around the world began picking up the story, a spokesperson for the UN agency claimed the map was removed because it was “causing confusion.”  It was hardly the first time UN bureaucrats had made such dire predictions, only to be proven wrong. On June 30, 1989, the Associated Press ran an article headlined: “UN Official Predicts Disaster, Says Greenhouse Effect Could Wipe Some Nations Off Map.” In the piece, the director of the UNEP’s New York office was quoted as claiming that “entire nations could be wiped off the face of the earth by rising sea levels if global warming is not reversed by the year 2000.” He also predicted “coastal flooding and crop failures” that “would create an exodus of ‘eco-refugees,’ threatening political chaos.”  Other UN predictions were so ridiculous that they were retracted before they could even be proven wrong. Consider, as just one example, the scandal that came to be known as “Glaciergate.” In its final 2007 report, widely considered the “gospel” of “settled” climate “science,” the UN IPCC suggested that Himalayan glaciers could melt by 2035 or sooner. It turns out the wild assertion was lifted from World Wildlife Fund propaganda literature. The IPCC recanted the claim after initially defending it."

climateskeptics,39a8hn,kriegson,3,Wed Jun 10 14:13:22 2015 UTC,"I think they have no choice but to run from this new study.  It's too big a gamble to move the numbers to fit the warmup.  What happens in ten years if we still don't have a warm up, you can only move the numbers so far before even the alarmist say something about it.  If the temps don't go up, and keep not going up, but noaa keeps pushing them up... eventually it's going to look real stupid."
climateskeptics,39a8hn,Kelly_jernigan,3,Wed Jun 10 20:56:38 2015 UTC,"eventually it's going to look real stupid.      The people who support AGW tend to either be very invested in it fiscally or emotionally. Alternatively they may simply have very short memories and can't recall all the doomsday predictions that have failed to come to pass which makes things pretty stupid looking currently.  Aforementioned supports just ignore them outright and come up with more outlandish predictions.  If anything, they'll have to ditch the study because it contradicts IPCC and and NASA if I recall. IPCC admitted a slowdown and if you're on the AGW team you bow to the IPCC."
climateskeptics,39a8hn,kriegson,-1,Wed Jun 10 21:03:39 2015 UTC,"Actually, here's the full comment from the author:   So let me give you two examples from our paper. One of the new adjustments we are applying is extending the corrections to ship data, based on information derived from night marine air temperatures, up to the present (we had previously stopped in the 1940s). As we write in the article's on-line supplement, ""This correction cools the ship data a bit more in 1998-2000 than it does in the later years, which thereby adds to the warming trend. To evaluate the robustness of this correction, trends of the corrected and uncorrected ship data were compared to co-located buoy data without the offset added. As the buoy data did not include the offset the buoy data are independent of the ship data. The trend of uncorrected ship minus buoy data was -0.066°C dec-1 while the trend in corrected ship minus buoy data was -0.002°C dec-1. This close agreement in the trend of the corrected ship data indicates that these time dependent ship adjustments did indeed correct an artifact in ship data impacting the trend over this hiatus period.""  The second example I will pose as a question. We tested the difference between buoys and ships by comparing all the co-located ship and buoy data available in the entire world. The result was that buoy data averaged 0.12 degrees C colder than the ships. We also know that the number of buoys has dramatically increased over the last several decades. Adding more colder observations in recent years can't help but add a cool bias to the raw data. What would you recommend we do about it? Leave a known bias in the data or correct the data for the bias? The resulting trend would be the same whether we added 0.12 C to all buoy data or subtracted 0.12 C from all ship data.   Quite a bit different than what you actually said."
climateskeptics,39a8hn,lcd_monitor,5,Wed Jun 10 16:27:52 2015 UTC,whether we added 0.12 C to all buoy data or subtracted 0.12 C from all ship data   So basically the data is crap.
climateskeptics,39a8hn,Florinator,0,Wed Jun 10 17:54:55 2015 UTC,All measurements have error. Identifying the errors and correcting them is a pretty standard process.
climateskeptics,39a8hn,lcd_monitor,6,Wed Jun 10 19:15:31 2015 UTC,"So why use data with a margin of error a factor more than the current proposed warming (which is also within the margin of error .3/4c if I recall) if you are trying to get accurate measurements?     We have satellites and more accurate instruments, so it seems a little disingenuous to use crap tools and propose it is on the most extreme end of the spectrum immediately and promise to correct it later =/"
climateskeptics,39a8hn,kriegson,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:59:02 2015 UTC,"The margin of error isn't more than the ""proposed warming."" You're comparing a specific subset of oceanic measurements with over 140 years of  global trends.    We have satellites and more accurate instruments   Satellites aren't more accurate and ""other instruments"" need to be deployed in the ocean some way, be it ships or buoys.  You can read it directly from RSS: "".  A similar, but stronger case can be made using surface temperature datasets, which I consider to be more reliable than satellite datasets (they certainly agree with each other better than the various satellite datasets do!)."""
climateskeptics,39a8hn,lcd_monitor,2,Thu Jun 11 02:38:03 2015 UTC,"Surface sets more accurate?  Many are demonstrably compromised in the US alone.  Pretty sure Canada and America at the very least have concluded something around a 30% and 47% accuracy ratio when simply predicting your 7 day forecast and then some on average (I do know it is posted somewhere...) and to boot, surface stations weren't designed for the goal of measuring warming on a global scale. I don't see how you can contend that they are more accurate than satellite datasets.      That said their oceanic measurements:       Are making adjustments no one else is.   2: Contend with the golden standard (British oceanic institute IIRC?)       3: Flies in the face of things the IPCC and other organizations already agree on.      So basically either everyone else is wrong, or something in the study is wrong."
climateskeptics,39a8hn,kriegson,-1,Thu Jun 11 12:13:44 2015 UTC,"Surface sets more accurate? Many are demonstrably compromised in the US alone.   Not really. You can read about it from RSS themselves. Carl Mears blatantly states that the 10k+ surface instruments are more reliable than the satellites. How does he know? The 10k surface instruments tend to agree with each other, where as the satellite records rarely agree with each other. Too much disparity between readings makes too fuzzy of a data set.  That's a pretty big admission considering RSS gets money for providing satellite temperature records.    Pretty sure Canada and America at the very least have concluded something around a 30% and 47% accuracy ratio when simply predicting your 7 day forecast and then some on average   Weather's forecasting is chaotic. They're not trying to forecast any trends or anything like that. Climate modeling isn't chaotic; we know that December in the US will be colder than June in the US. Climate modeling is about projecting trends, not specific weather metrics on a specific day.    Are making adjustments no one else is.   That's why it's research. Research is doing things nobody else has done. When the community looks it over, they'll decide if these corrections should apply to their data set or not.    Contend with the golden standard   Judith Curry uses that word, golden standard, but pretty much no other climate scientists call it that before this. This is a poor argument, anyways, as the whole point of research is to find out why our existing understanding is wrong.    Flies in the face of things the IPCC and other organizations already agree on.    Again, the whole point of research is to do something new and find out why our existing understanding is wrong or incomplete. That is exactly what research is for. Using your logic, no research should ever be conducted and we should only listen to authority figures. Yikes."
climateskeptics,39a8hn,lcd_monitor,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:10:37 2015 UTC,"Well, if you can agree the RSS is reliable consider this.     Of course we should research and push the boundaries of what we know, that's my problem with the whole ""The science is settled"" nonsense we see spewed. Studies that are skeptical or observations and papers that do not show predicted warming are often considered invalid.     At any rate, adjustments will be quite a bit necessary considering if I recall, the ships had something around .12 +/- due to heating from the engines. If we're looking at a possible .2 these last few decades, that's quite a bit to be fussing with. Quite a huge potential margin for error, in regards to the study this thread is referring to."
climateskeptics,39a8hn,kriegson,2,Thu Jun 11 14:20:25 2015 UTC,"Well, if you can agree the RSS is reliable consider this.    You missed what I said, right?

""The science is settled"" nonsense we see spewed. Studies that are skeptical or observations and papers that do not show predicted warming are often considered invalid.    There's media coverage and actual scientific coverage. Non-scientists often have a hard time differentiating the two, and consider articles on things like IFL and Buzzfeed to be the actual science publication itself. Don't make that mistake.  A lot of the skeptical publications have very frightening flaws. Take for example the publication about the US surface network. Watts et. al. didn't even correct for time of day in their analysis; taking a temperature reading at 9pm is treated the same as taking a temperature reading at noon. One can easily see why this is flawed. Apparantly, Watts. et. al didn't.    If we're looking at a possible .2 this last few decades, that's quite a bit to be fussing with.   Sure, but fortunately, it's not the whole temperature record, right? In the last two decades, there has been a larger change in instruments moving towards buoys. It's a small subset of the temperature record that was shown to be flawed. That's reflected in the fact that the adjustments didn't really change a whole lot. The before and after graphs show very little deviation. In fact, on the whole, the NOAA update actually decreased the amount of overall warming we've had; it simply changes when the uptick starts."

A temperature reading taken at 9pm in 1920 is given the same standing as a temperature reading taken at noon in 2010. It's pretty easy to see why this is dumbly flawed.  This also doesn't establish anything relating to satellite margins of error. According to RSS directly, none of the satellite records are in high agreement with each other; there's a wide disparity across satellite data sets. According to RSS, this makes them very unreliable. The disparity across surface station measurements varies significantly less."

What the authors did was sacrifice a portion of the century long trend in exchange for increasing the trend over the last 50 years.  The short version is:    Bouy and ship data don't match when it comes to temperature Ship data is biased cold in the early record due to it being measured by bucket, and warm in the later era due to it being measured by engine intake Bouys become more and more common in the later stages after 1970, increasing that cold bias through their growing numbers They decided to warm the bouy data to match the ship data because they didn't have bouy data for the early record. The reason they chose the 1950 start date is because the 1940s and before were warmed buy adjusting the ship temperature data upwards before that   So the early record went up, decreasing the overal trend in rising temperatures, while the mid part in the 50's went down, increasing the trend from then till now.  So at the end, adjusting data and then cherry picking time periods proves nothing to anyone but those with an alarmist agenda.

Which side is so opposed to even the possibility of skepticism that they've gone full-McCarthy on the entire field of climate science; routinely destroying the careers of anyone that dare stray from 'consensus'?  Skeptics would love to discuss the causes of the erroneous, over-inflating models; the poor core assumptions baked into the entire field; the radiative forcing coefficient; the contradicting satellite temperature data; the growing corruption of data adjustments; the causes of warming other than CO2; etc. etc. ..... and afterwards, we'd love to sit down for a chat about possible alternative solutions to 'your problem' not involving a gargantuan price tag & unprecedented expansion of world-governments.

While many of us (am guilty) tend to assume nefarious motives in all who are alarmed, the truth is a good number are sincerely concerned, but rather than conduct their own appraisals of the data, they place absolute faith on the reliability of the models and are unaware of the finer points in the data that drive skepticism.  http://wattsupwiththat.com/2015/06/06/my-one-on-one-meeting-with-bill-mckibben/"

climateskeptics,396wvd,Imapopulistnow,10,Tue Jun 9 21:18:18 2015 UTC,It's all just variations on Universal Bolshevism.
climateskeptics,396wvd,SpiritofJames,7,Tue Jun 9 21:53:36 2015 UTC,"It's a modern version of the 'hero complex'. Fueled by the internet & information age it has become painfully clear that on this huge highly-populated planet, virtually every single one of us will not 'make a difference', 'make the world a better place', 'be a hero' as an individual. The problem is that even after coming to this realization, the hero complex doesn't simply go away.  Instead, people latched onto government as a way to feel important & give their life meaning. Since we live in a (sort of) Democracy, a lot of people feel like anything that government accomplishes - they accomplished. So they now yearn for macro problems that require macro government solutions.   But of course, that means they can only satisfy their hero complex as long as there is a huge crisis to manage. The Climate Crusade was an ideal candidate; a way to 'save the world' without ever facing any real danger... an enemy so abstract they can swing their sword at nothing for the rest of their life then go to their deathbed feeling like they rescued every living thing on the planet. (It's truly a perfect, elegant 'crisis' if you think about it!). But rather than worrying about whether or not it was a legitimate, imminent crisis that would warrant the big solutions they crave, they leaped first and looked never, demanding every resource at the first cry of ""wolf"".   And thus where we find ourselves today; despite global warming, climate change, ""Climate Disruption"" turning out to be a false alarm, it was too late, the cape was on and they were already out the door, nothing was going to stop them from becoming heroes. So they proceeded to manipulate a minor concern into a titanic panic, and manufactured their own customized climate villain from which we all can be rescued."

Everyone should focus on themselves, wealth acquisition, and their immediate loved ones. Then everything will work out, as long as you aren't too different from me. The carrying capacity of the earth is infinite and the health of natural ecosystems is irrelevant to the future of the human species on this planet. The free market is not just a convenient way to organize trade efficiently it is an infallible system that should be applied to everything. Any amount of regulation for any purpose by government is bad. Economic survival of the fittest trumps all other moral concerns. There is a supernatural being in the sky that will make sure evil is punished later, but street level crime requires extremely harsh punishments now. Global warming is manufactured crisis and an attempt to make me poorer and distribute my wealth equally amongst the global population, nothing more. The number of people impacted by terrorism relative to other global concerns is irrelevant, it is a priority because it is scary and full of graphic violence that we can easily solve with more powerful violence. I hate anyone who can't see these evident truths and they are destroying the USA.  This is the nature of many American conservatives to me.

Would like to reread it a couple of times to be sure i get all nuances.  In general though, the characterization of the American conservative (are you not an American by chance) is a stereotypical collection of the most extreme views of a very few on the right.  I would liken them to a description of extreme anarchsts or devout Marxists in ths respect.  Also, with respect to those who pursue causes, while of cousrse such pursuits are noble, my original point had to do with the fact that some persons, by their nature, are hardwired for personal reasons of self esteem to pursue causes in a particuar manner and within a strong emotional rather than analytical framework.

climateskeptics,396wvd,Seele,5,Wed Jun 10 20:18:01 2015 UTC,"Here goes. I learned this over many years, being a conservative working in liberal policy areas.  I sought to understand how could both sides have such strong but oftentimes diametrically opposite perspectives on what is right.  First, people are incredibly diverse. To think that we all generally think in the same fashion simply is a false assumption.  Roughly 3/4s of all people approach matters from the perspective of the present and past real experiences.  They do not care to think is abstract terms.  The rest are the intellectuals - not necessarily high IQs, but rather have a future oriented perspective where they think in abstract and conceptual terms.  This intellectual group can further be divided into two roughly equal subgroups.  Those whose abstract views are feeling based and those who are let's say math based.  The feeling based subgroup places a greater priority on social issues, equality, justice, harmony, community - the math based place a greater priority on systemic cost effectiveness, efficiency, bottom lines, prosperity, etc.  It is natural to think that likeminded thinkers are the good guys and those who think differently must be evil, nefarious boobs.  But if you think it through, the world operates best when their is a balances between both sides.  Too much feels and the systems they come up with are inefficient, ineffective because feels rule.  Too much efficiency and cost effectiveness and the systems function at a higjer level but the benefits are not socially just.  Feeling preferred intellectuals possess a number of unique attributes, strengths as do the math preferred  I used the term math because the other adjectives, logic preferred or rational preferred infer negativly on the feel preferred side and there are no negatives in this matter, just different approaches, both of which are essential for a society to function well.  Also everyone is emotional and most everyone is rational which is why it is important to state as the preffed approach,   Feeling preferred intellectuals are obviously well attuned to communication, non-verbal, written and verbal.  Thus they populate at much higher rates fields such as academia, journalism, authors, actors and public policy.  Math preferreds obviously are good at math based skills and populate at higher levels the fields of business, systems  management, programming.  Many are weaker in interperson skills using communication shortcuts and placing results over empathy.  Mitt Romney's ""binders full of women"" is a perfect example. That was shortcut speak for ""binders full of resumes from qualified female candidates"" but in communication shorthand, it sounded insulting.  Romney is an excellent manager of systems and processes but in empathic communication, not so much.  I too prefer systems efficiency and communicate without proper empathy using shortcuts, so bear with me when i offend...  That are other qualities possessed by feeling based intellectuals that have con Mitt Romne"
climateskeptics,396wvd,Imapopulistnow,-2,Wed Jun 10 15:21:55 2015 UTC,"So you are making an arguement as a conservative, based upon anecdote and complete conjecture, that liberal thought is based on emotion? Can you taste the irony? Did you just pull ""3/4 of all people.."" out of your ass? Please. This is not an example of reason based thought. After your first comment I was expecting much better.  The fact is most studies suggest that people with a liberal bias have more capacity for reason based thought. Self-described liberals are also better at handling conflicting information. Conservatives in contrast have a larger portion of the brain activated during fear and anxiety. Also this sub constantly complains about the liberal bias of climate scientists. Scientists are biased to using reason on which to base thier opinion. I don't think you could argue otherwise.  Ideals of social justice, equality, community ect aren't just about emotion. A successful society needs cohesion and common goals. I don't want my neighbour to be desperate and poor not just because of empathy, but because it is dangerous to have a desperate person next door, and if my neighbor is busy trying eat he/she can't help me with common interests of our neighbourhood.  Perhaps you are biased to thinking conservative thought is based on reason because you would like to think that opposing viewpoints are not reasonable? If that this the case use facts for your arguement not a bunch of made up stuff based upon your personal experiences and biased opinions. You have no facts to support your main arguement here.  The fact that you did get correct is that people and their opinions are incredible diverse. That is why the OP article is shit, as was your comment about the nature of liberals. The topic here is supposedly climate change. Not an echochamber for critism of liberal thought. The comments on this sub alone are often enough to make me think that intelligent discussion on this topic is elsewhere, perhaps discussing more rational arguements about climate change.  That being said I'm certainly not saying that r/climate is much better. (but it is a little bit:)   Thanks for your response."
climateskeptics,396wvd,lostshakerassault,4,Wed Jun 10 16:29:13 2015 UTC,"You are correct about conservative thinking running through the amygdala to a greater degree than liberals.  It is why many conservatives feel much greater  guilt and shame.  A passion for a cause is a different kind of emotion than that which is generated by the amygdala.  By your response, that i gave a 75% probablility to, i must congratulate you in not being one of the passionate of a cause type liberals.  But i suggesst you consider that the gatekeepers and the messengers - not most scientists - are, and that this influences both the science conducted and the reporting of it.  The article below contains elements of the process that I attempted to describe to you.  Be good  http://wattsupwiththat.com/2015/06/06/my-one-on-one-meeting-with-bill-mckibben/"
climateskeptics,396wvd,Imapopulistnow,2,Wed Jun 10 16:45:51 2015 UTC,Cheers. I apologize for my tone.
climateskeptics,396wvd,lostshakerassault,4,Wed Jun 10 16:53:22 2015 UTC,"Writing on an ipad which make long posts difficult. Pls disregard last sentence of previous post and i will pick up here.  Other qualities of feeling preference intellectuals include having strong passions for what they believe in.  And these passions must be genuine affording little room to compromise.  As with all human thinking, emotions act as a very strong filter of the inputs that we are willing to accept.  A tsunami wipes out a village and it is God's way as an example.  When one is passionate about something then one tends to advocate for it, seeks out  facts only to support and  Discards facts that conflict.  So with these observations in mind, much of the conflict in climate change revolves around the approach of those who are in charge of the science and those who report on it.  The gatekeepers for awarding funding are academics and government policy personnel who view the science not in a clinical fashion of objectivity and seeking greater truth and knowledge, but rather with a passion that we must fix the climate to save humanity.  Facts and suppositions that support the passion are emphasized while those that do not must be supressed or bettercyet not looked at at all, since the cause - the passion to save humanity - is of far greater importance than the facts, particularly if such facts would dilute or compromise the cause.  Journalists are perhaps the most passionate of all groups  They entered a field that pays little but gives them an opportunity to purse their passion.  Thus they report in a biased fashion.  Now back to that other 3/4s of the population grounded in the reality of what they see and have seen as opposed to the visions of what can be.  These folks by their nature can percieve deception, when what people say does not match up with what they observe.  Thus when passionate advocates tell them they must do xyz to save the world, they sense hyperbole, exageration, bullshit.  Ot is my opinion that climate change science has in fact been distorted because its funding and messaging has been dominated by the feeling preferred intellectuals.  It would be far better for it to be managed in a clinically rational, logical,systematic manner.  If so, it would garner much greater confidence among the public that the products emanating from the science were objective and balanced rather than biased towards the passion of those who approach the subject with such passion."
climateskeptics,396wvd,Imapopulistnow,-1,Wed Jun 10 15:51:05 2015 UTC,"Lots of guess work here. ""Feeling preferred intellectuals"" being climate scientists? It is conservatives who disregard conflicting facts more readily. See links in my previous comment. ""It is my opinion."" Sure. Do you have anything constructive or evidence to offer to support it.

climateskeptics,396wvd,lostshakerassault,4,Wed Jun 10 17:10:21 2015 UTC,"I understand.  You a scientist or engineer by chance?  You are most definitely based in reality and not abstract which btw means that while the abstractors are pontificating, you are someone who actually gets shit done and makes the world work (if I were to leave you alone perhap ;)  Anyways, as i wrote i am not an empathetic communicator, i take shortcuts and this leads to misunderstandings and outrage.  So be it.  Regarding liberals, i should have emphasized that one small, but very influential component on the left consists of abstract feeling preferred folks.  Abstract, feeling preferred is only 1/8th of the population and in this group likely 40% (out of my ass guess) would be conservatives - religion and sorts. So, of the total pop, the abstract liberal feelers make up maybe 8%.  But they are highly infjuential because, 1. they are excellent, empathic communicators and 2) they are driven, they measure their individual worth by how successfully the pursue the cause.  The scientists are not, or rarely are abstract feelers. The nature of the work requires attention to detail and precision.  It is the gatekeepers; politicos, govt policy makers, academics, as well as the messengers; actors, journalists, writers who are.  Btw, i worked in policy for two governors, one a liberal dem and the other a moderate GOP.  Also in financial mgmt and have made economic study my passion.  Climate change is just a sideline based on understanding the human interactions involved.  Fwiw, i believe in man made climate change.  I believe its magnitude is exaggerated as are its consequences.  Also, my passion for understanding how humans think stems from likely being somewhere on the Aspergers spectrum and needing to understand the whys in order to learn how to adapt and live on a planet filled with these alien creatures such as yourself ;)"
climateskeptics,396wvd,Imapopulistnow,0,Wed Jun 10 17:33:17 2015 UTC,"I still take issue with your breakdown of the population. Offer a source for these numbers. You claim to be a rational thinker yet I don't see any evidence of this in your argument. Guessing at numbers and framing an argument around it is the opposite of rational.  My experience is that scientists, who you agree are not abstract feelers, are mostly liberal. Most conservatives that I know tend to be less educated, religious, or involved in economics, business ect. But this is my experience and it is probably totally biased. I can see all your logic but you have cited NO evidence to support your ramblings. You suggested that journalists and decision makers are largely abstract feelers so climate change gets a free pass on the agenda. This is a bold claim and you have nothing to support it. The fact is very little, other than lip service in my opinion, is being done about climate change. Look at recent agreements. The ""problem"" is being left to future generations because of the fear of the economic consequences.   I'm with you on climate change. It is no doubt an observable effect with consequences, but the magnitude is exaggerated sometimes, but also just largely unclear. I am biased to doing something about it as opposed to saying that it is too difficult or that too great a sacrifice is unavoidable so let's just forget about it. My impression however is that I think it is too late already."

Of course, all of my left leaning friends (and family) keep harping on my love of the GOP, because I don't embrace their pet causes.    I disagree with about an equal number of issues from the left as from the right.  As many people in this sub-reddit know, I do agree with the statement that climate change has happened and is still happening.  I also agree that actions of mankind has contributed to that change.  Where I differ is that I think that the reported scope of that change is different than reality, and that the projected warming is overestimated, so that the projected harm from such warming is also overestimated.    I think that the Left has some things that they want to do, which includes a move to renewable energy - primarily because they hate big business and there is no bigger business than the fossil fuel industry. There is also apparently a fairly large amount of sympathy from the left for non-US developing nations, with the idea that the fact that they are not on equal economic ground with the US is ""unfair"" and they try to suppress US growth while encouraging the growth of other nations to make it ""fair.""  The GOP, of course, has the opposite attitude, where anything we can do to make the US the #1 strongest economic and military force on the planet is a good thing.  That is likely not a good thing, either.  So, I'm an independent, taking what I like from both the left and the right, and sometimes going a third direction when the left and the right agree, but I don't.

So it isn't like I am carrying some bias or grudge on the issue.  What I got from the response article is that the professors concerns are valid, but not because of identity politics embracing students, but because job security is extremely low for professors, and anyone who might criticise them is a threat. So the professor has done the typical human thing which is to experience a fear, then attempt to rationalize the fear by finding a cause - falsely attributing it to the students, rather than the real cause, the job security situation itself.  This doesn't mean the original article has no purpose or value ... but I think the response helps to add nuance to the discussion...and I am a fan of nuanced understandings."

That fundamentalist christians are just as likely to try to get him fired for perceived acts of religious discrimination. Or nationalistic students trying to get him fired for perceived acts of treason. etc  The point is that the core problem is the job insecurity, not this particular subset of students.  Arguably any professor could rewrite the same article and show their fear of any other minority group of students equally as justifiably. And that argument would just as poorly show that that minority group of students is something to be reasonably feared above all of the other 'threats' out there.

Rbutr is a web based platform for alerting people to alternate views with the aim of encouraging discussion of controversial topics.  http://rbutr.com/  The author, also a redditor explained it to me here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/38kgix/climate_science_is_not_settled/crx95nd   Hi Seele, Shane here, creator and founder of rbutr and author of the article you linked to on SkepticalScience.  Can you clarify how it is that you think rbutr can be abused?  Because the example you provide is not a subversion of the tool, but an intended application. The only people who will ever actively engage in with a tool like rbutr, and participate in these sorts of discussions are the people most fervently committed to their beliefs.  The objective isn't to block these people out and say ""No, you must be uncertain of your position!"", but instead to invite them in and say ""Give us your best"", and then, having their best right in front of you, smashing their best to pieces with evidence and logic.   The [un]skeptical Science Krusher Krew are active users of rbutr:  http://www.skepticalscience.com/rbutr-Puts-Climate-Information-In-Front-of-Those-Who-Need-It-Most.html  But, according to the author, climate skeptics have so far not been inclined to use it.   PS: I have reached out to Jo Nova, The Galileo Movement and Anthony Watts several times with regards to rbutr, asking them to write about it, use it, or give me the opportunity to write an article for them. Watts and Galileo never replied, Jo Nova said ""I can see benefits, but also that it will be very difficult to stop people gaming it"" - to which I can very confidently say there has been no gaming yet. Only individuals with strong convictions - exactly as planned, and as expected.   Maybe we should, though I suspect it would lead to flame wars, doxxing and brigading by militant alarmist wackos."

The bot merely observes that ""Someone has disputed that link, over 'here'"" - the arguing has already been done.  rbutr cannot be abused in order to force a bubble on to anyone else. rbutr, by its very structure, automatically provides access to alternative views. If you are being exposed to an alternative view via rbutr, then you can in turn access a counter to that alternative view, and so on.  For example, in the post you are responding to is a rebuttal to our very own homepage. Click on the rebuttal.

New climate data by NOAA scientists doubles the warming trend since the late 1990s by adjusting pre-hiatus temperatures downward and inflating temperatures in more recent years.

We were told that we would have more cyclonic activity, more severe cyclonic activity, snow would be a rare event, there would be more floods, more droughts, more tornados, etc, etc.  None of the predictions have come to pass.

Perhaps it’s skulking at the bottom of the ocean alongside the missing heat.  Sea level rose by about 7-8 inches in the 20th century, according to the tide-gauges. After adjusting for calibration errors and a bewildering variety of tamperings with the satellite sea-level data, that rate has not changed much. And why would it?

With that speed it will be 6 mm out of orbit by this time 2 years from today.  He ran his trusty models on it, and 100 years from now, the moon will look more like a star in the night ski.

Would you not want there to be a hiatus? Or are you so vested in climate change that you want something bad to happen?    Why do we even allow titles like this?    So, the scientific evidence NASA referenced less than a year ago (showing a hiatus) is now inaccurate? Or am I misunderstanding this.    Let's all keep in mind this is a single study out of hundreds of thousands, using a wholly new data set. The IPCC itself has acknowledged there may have been a slowing in the rate of warmth over the past decade-and-a-half not accounted for in climate models. Piers Forster, professor of climate change at the University of Leeds, pointed out that the IPCC report relies on numerous sets of data, not just NOAA's.  Imagine how it will play out in the news if this study is discredited.    It's odd how when you look at the article and scroll to the bottom, there are other articles which agree with the global warming hiatus    Yes, this is the only study denying the hiatus, which has scientific consensus at this point. The insane title here is the only thing that drove me to comment all over this thread. Hoping an outlier study like this, which is under a lot of criticism right now, is going to ""end the discussion of the so called"" scientific consensus just pisses me off.    The hiatus is in fact the opposite of cherry picking. This paper is doing the cherry picking, by disparaging extremely accurate datasets like those mentioned above, while increasing the influence of datasets that are only available for the past 10 years. The net effect here is to depress the historical temperature data, and to increase the recent data, leading to this trend.  Even though the individual data sets that do span the entire period of study do not support the conclusion, and the newer heavier weighted datasets do not support the conclusion either since they don't cover the full time period in question.  In my opinion, they are adding in confusion to come up with a result they desperately want for political and funding reasons. There is no consistent dataset in existence for the entire time period in question that supports the study's conclusion on the warming trend."

Like model validation for how Greenland snow goes from loose pack to defined layers that present in the ice cores used for ancient O2 isotope ratios (which measure atmospheric temp by proxy). Seriously, that one tiny detail is the product of like 4-5 scientists life work.   Where climate science has issues is that papers state very sound facts, but the facts are very well defined in a very particular way. Like the O2 ratios from this core is some plot over time.   The media takes these small details and makes huge implications and extrapolations from that. There are few papers that put all the small stuff together to give an actual scientific view of what's going on. The integration of all of this fantastic data, and the modeling of what it means for the climate is also very difficult. Where I see errors are in some of these last steps, and then how it gets portrayed to the public (a minefield).   My issues with that particular post in /r/science were: 1. Media misrepresentation of what was actually happening (and where those results for within other published papers on the subject).   Some of the weighting methods raise red flags, and they don't match the datasets that I have lots of experience with (and know is super high quality)."

Seems that overall measuring of ‘sea surface’ has problems. Original bucket & thermometer (no depth control), ship intake (well below surface and varied depth due to load +/-20 feet), buoys (seem to rock in the wave with depth resolution of a meter), then IR satellite (cannot get thru the clouds) to microwave (get thru the clouds, but not the rain & surface mist). Oh and did I mention one of the satellites was doing reasonable until they had to boost the altitude, then had problems with pitch, yaw and just had no idea the height it was flying. The number of adjustments to correct is staggering. Includes (but not limited to); wind speed, rain, cloud amount/percent and cloud water vapor, daytime diurnal warming, high latitudes, aerosols, SSTs <10C, columnar water vapor, higher latitudes show a slight warm bias, seasonal cycle wind direction for SST retrieval, fast moving storms and fronts, wind direction error and instrument degradation.  http://images.remss.com/papers/rsspubs/gentemann_jgr_2014.pdf  Still their abstract reads – Errors were identified in both the MW and IR SST data sets: (1) at low atmospheric water vapor a posthoc correction added to AMSR-E was incorrectly applied and (2) there is significant cloud contamination of nighttime MODIS retrievals at SST <10C. A correction is suggested for AMSR-E SSTs that will remove the vapor dependency. For MODIS, once the cloud contaminated data were excluded, errors were reduced but not eliminated. Biases were found to be 20.05C and 20.13C and standard deviations to be 0.48C and 0.58C for AMSR-E and MODIS, respectively. Using a three-way error analysis, individual standard deviations were determined to be 0.20C (in situ), 0.28C (AMSR-E), and 0.38C (MODIS).  To put that in perspective, the error bars would be the white shaded areas on all the graphed figures above."

Now the surface temperature coverage is very bad, overall, but for the US it's pretty amazing compared with other areas of the world: most of the oceans, large swaths of Africa, the Arctic, etc.  So guess what happens? They use computer models to fill in the missing data (also known as making stuff up). And then they show us this data, which purpotedly proves the warming. They use models to generate data and then validate the models against that data! This is a bit of a faux-pas in statistics. My boss would say: set about 30% of the data apart for validation, so I'd only use 70% to train the model and the remaining 30% to validate it."

Can you clarify how it is that you think rbutr can be abused?   Because the example you provide is not a subversion of the tool, but an intended application. The only people who will ever actively engage in with a tool like rbutr, and participate in these sorts of discussions are the people most fervently committed to their beliefs.  The objective isn't to block these people out and say ""No, you must be uncertain of your position!"", but instead to invite them in and say ""Give us your best"", and then, having their best right in front of you, smashing their best to pieces with evidence and logic.  The worst thing to do when you see rbutr being used by people that you disagree with is to decide that it is a tool of no use to you. The exact opposite is actually true. You now have a captive audience of people who disagree with you, that you are guaranteed to reach with your evidence and arguments.  If the other side are using low quality material and propoganda, then call it out. Respond to the propaganda and clearly explain why it is such.  You may never change the mind of the person submitting the content or the author of the content...but who knows how many neutral observers may be swayed by your level headed response.  And that is all that matters in the end. How many neutrals can you reach with the evidence and the logic?  PS: I have reached out to Jo Nova, The Galileo Movement and Anthony Watts several times with regards to rbutr, asking them to write about it, use it, or give me the opportunity to write an article for them. Watts and Galileo never replied, Jo Nova said ""I can see benefits, but also that it will be very difficult to stop people gaming it"" - to which I can very confidently say there has been no gaming yet. Only individuals with strong convictions - exactly as planned, and as expected.  Maybe I should try to reach Joanne again and see if she will reconsider? Maybe we can mobilise a force of climate skeptics to push their agenda on rbutr? Maybe the two sides of this coin will finally engage on issues thoughtfully?

climateskeptics,38jvk5,joshuay,1 point,Sun Jun 7 09:09:16 2015 UTC,To clarify: The precautionary principle
climateskeptics,38jvk5,joshuay,1 point,Sun Jun 7 09:19:48 2015 UTC,"Precautionary principle:       The precautionary principle or precautionary approach to risk management states that if an action or policy has a suspected risk of causing harm to the public or to the environment, in the absence of scientific consensus that the action or policy is not harmful, the burden of proof that it is not harmful falls on those taking an action.  The principle is used by policy makers to justify discretionary decisions in situations where there is the possibility of harm from making a certain decision (e.g. taking a particular course of action) when extensive scientific knowledge on the matter is lacking. The principle implies that there is a social responsibility to protect the public from exposure to harm, when scientific investigation has found a plausible risk. These protections can be relaxed only if further scientific findings emerge that provide sound evidence that no harm will result.  In some legal systems, as in the law of the European Union, the application of the precautionary principle has been made a statutory requirement in some areas of law.

climateskeptics,38ivjm,betaplay,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:38:44 2015 UTC,"Point taken.    However, let me just point out that you started the response with the exact type of language I'm talking about: ""the types of folks who lead witch hunts against them"".  The first issue with this type of comment is that it calls out some group as an outsider, somehow different than the narrative, e.g. “the types of folks”.  There is no reason to characterize people into “types” when we are talking about physical things, so this stands out right away as a biasing factor.  Of course the “leading witch hunts” part is a much more obvious example of another bias.  Were we talking about witch hunts?  What witch hunts? Is someone being persecuted here?   I’m not trying to be inflammatory at all, I’m just pointing out how weird it is to come into these blogs and this sub from the perspective of an outside observer who doesn’t carry these assumed biases.   Thanks for the resources.  The first source is interesting.  It does look somewhat less biased than some and I see that there are some skeptically leaning papers as well as at least one seemingly in support of AGW (e.g. A long-term context (931–2005 C.E.) for rapid warming over Central Asia) on the current front page.    The second source seems interesting as well.  I’ve seen GWPF studies before and seem rigorous (I personally don’t have enough time to really dig in and make up my own mind on many of these sources/issues).  However, I think it’s a little disingenuous that they position themselves as having no stance on AGW yet they consistently push against it and rarely, as far as I can tell, apply the same scrutiny to skeptical researchers and work.   I’ve been to Steven Goddard’s site a few times and I’m definitely not impressed.  It’s a hodgepodge of graphs (often uncited) out of context with political messages (not policy, I’m talking politics), always referring to “alarmists”,  “agendas”, ”propaganda”, etc.  All the typical red flags. Reads exactly like someone specifically trying to cherry pick anything they can find that might refute AGW which is, of course, the exact opposite of objectivity.   Sorry for the dealy – I’m not on here often.  May not respond further but didn’t want to leave you hanging."
climateskeptics,38ivjm,FireFoxG,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:02:16 2015 UTC,"biases   Eh you'd have to try really, really hard to find people entirely impartial on the argument. Now that doesn't necessarily mean compromising data (Doubtless, some do on both sides) but they can be found.      That said, you can still disseminate useful data from a group with Bias. Heck the IPCC even admits that the pause exists which flies in the face of the recent ""Pause no longer exists!"" paper flying around. And they're a bureaucratic organization, not a scientific one.      Thanks for replying! You don't need to feel obligated, I've stumbled across some other good sites from time to time but they're a pain to find again (with google anyhow). But you can see there's a range from about impartial as you can get to near conspiracy theorist on either end of the spectrum."
climateskeptics,38ivjm,e-socrates,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:47:22 2015 UTC,"Oh man.  I've been reading Goddard and it's stuff like this that really turns me off to the objectivity ""skeptical"" view (he's not actual skeptical, he's clearly antagonistic) and those who write of it.  Post from June 9th. https://stevengoddard.wordpress.com/2015/06/09/global-warming-scam-in-complete-collapse/.   Starts by saying that the north Atlantic is cold now. Ok, that's true, great.  Then a map to back that up (pretty much uncited) but still ok, fine. There is a small but negative temperature anomaly right off the coast in this local area.  So this data backs up the point, great. Then three pictures of snow and a headline of snow ... Scandenavia?  Ok?  This is sophomoric and not particularly relevant but I'll roll with it.   His next conclusion is that the ""government"" (which government? where?) is tampering with the data.  His quote: ""Government climate scientists respond predictably by further tampering with temperature data, and claiming record warm sea surface temperatures.""  His evidence is a NOAA graph showing warming. Nothing he has posted so far indicate any tampering whatsoever, especially if we are to believe that the map - the only posted data to support his point - are made through a government agency (which they were).  In fact the map looks like pretty good evidence that the ocean is warming, just like the fraudulent ""government"" is claiming.   There is no evidence of tampering, nor any reaction from a government body, nor is there any contradiction between the global temperature and the local temperature in Norway.  By this point he has blown all credibility.   Then he posts: ""These people are engaged in deliberate and blatant fraud.""  What is he talking about?  He posted one piece of data earlier (the map) and it matches this NOAA graph quite well. That whole map is orange and red with positive temperature anomaly with a tiny negative blurb near Scandinavia.  How could we possibly take this information - that he himself has posted in support of his argument- and conclude that there is fraud somehow involved?  The data don't even begin to imply this. It's just baffling.   His last point is that the temperature is falling.  He posts a uncited graph with a volatile trend from somewhere called ""Woodfortrees.org."" This, or course, doesn't help his point - it's not even titled or labeled.  I have no idea what this graph is of.   His conclusion: ""[a] fraudulent agenda of the White House and their stooges in government agencies ... are creating fake data in support of..."" AGW.   Agenda?  Stooges?  Fraudulent? Fake?  Blatant red flags.  No objectivity here.  Even if there was a shred of credibility here the post makes absolutely no sense.  His conclusion is contradicted by his the provided data within the very same post!  You have to understand how batshit crazy this sort of thing reads to an outsider.  And many ""skeptical"" blogs that I find linked to tend to read just like this.  That's my major point.  If the main point of this sub is that we need to be skeptical of climate science - in the true sense of the word - than my conclusion is that we need to be doubly skeptical of sources like these.  It's hard to make any other conclusion given posts like this."

I don't think it looks ""batshit"" any more than than the dogmatic ""Climate deniers are wrong again! They're going to kill the planet!"" that the mass media spews on a daily basis.      woodfortrees is used quite a bit on both sides of the argument as an accessible source for plotting temps to anyone who knows what data-sets they are searching for, for instance.

This particular site fails in this all the time, and obviously uses this omission to bend the message to make a point.  If you aren't a scientist, you shouldn't pretend to be a scientist.   All avenues of communication have issues, including peer reviewed literature.  It's just not looking good for this to be your breakthrough moment - quite frankly the effect of AGW seems clearer year after year as the the actual data becomes available. This is happening and the, frankly, weird descriptions of ways in which it ""might not"" are becoming strange an unbelievable.  Whatsupwiththat is a fun read but I can't really take it seriously because it almost never really covers  it's thoughts with the rigor of a single journal entry, let alone a meta-analysis (as would be required, at the very least, to prove his conjecture).  And more often than not the base assumptions contradict those of actual scientists studying this field as their profession  I see, and have seen, no reason to believe that there is some global conspiracy going on here.  It was a weird thought to begin with and it only gets worse the more you look at it. The links here are downright biased in their voice with very few exceptions.   EDIT:  And to answer your question.  Climate scientists have rigorously examined Ice core samples, soil samples, and thermometer-based long term temperature samples. They provide strong evidence of human influenced global warming given all the uncertainty.  Unless there is some sort of multi-national conspiracy that somehow joins Japan, the US, China, all of Northern Europe, and other climate affected regions in some sort of climate hurrah I fail to see your point.  As usual, it's just not based in fact."

They are a statements of what we know based on peer reviewed published science.  If the data do not agree with physics as we know it then you look at the data first and then if that fails you look at the physics. Yeah sounds strange, but when the physics dates back to the time of Isaac Newton and is based on the laws of conservation of energy, momentum and mass the chances are the data are a problem.  Once again physics has been proved right. The models spotted a problem with a new data type.   This is in reference to the archetypal story (circa 2006) of why NASA scientist Josh Willis  discarded data that didn't fit the models. Basically, under pressure & about to give an important talk, with the ocean surface apparently cooling, Willis discarded sensors that showed cold (he says he also found sensors that showed a little too much warmth, too).

There are 21 pages, lots of formulae, graphs and two pages of citations. Here is the Abstract:  Richardson et al. (2015) suggest that the irreducibly simple climate model in Monckton of Brenchley et al. (2015) was not validated against observations, relying instead upon synthetic test data based on subjective assumptions including an underestimation of warming, an illogical parameter choice and a near-instantaneous response to forcing at odds with ocean warming and other observations. However, the simple model informed by our choice of parameters performs better against recent observed temperature change than the general-circulation models. Its predictions are closer to observations than theirs. When informed by the IPCC’s choice of parameters, the simple model is indeed validated in that, as Richardson et al. concede, it correctly replicates the IPCC’s sensitivity interval. Furthermore, a near-instantaneous response to forcing is an ineluctable consequence of a near-zero or net-negative temperature feedback sum. Given the large uncertainties in both the initial conditions and the time-dependent evolutionary processes determinative of climate sensitivity, subject to obvious caveats a simple sensitivity-focused model is not inherently likely to exhibit significantly less predictive skill than the general-circulation models. The simple model finds high climate sensitivity estimates implausible."

""Right after the year 2000, NASA and NOAA dramatically altered U.S. climate history, making the past much colder and the present much warmer,"" Goddard wrote.

One of many different groups who are collecting data, from many different data sources and collection methods.  Take away NOAA's results, and the consensus is still there.  Also keep in mind that even if you took away all the real climate scientists, the evidence of global warming is obvious.  For local examples, winter roads here in Manitoba are open for a much shorter period each summer.  The shipping season up in Churchill is longer, but the railroad leading to is out of commission more often because the tundra it sits on is melting.

Heat is not stored in the ocean (at least our ""missing"" heat) but consider they started claiming this due to the pause not showing any real warming in land or atmospheric data. ""We can't find the data, it must be in the ocean!"". But again, wrong.        No time to go through everything, but I'll see if there's any other relevant points to address. Argument by spewing more information someone can reasonably inspect is not a very good argument =/        Hottest on record is extremely disingenuous What record? Between the last 5 minutes and now? The last two years? Twenty years? If you take that out of context, is the data still useful? This is how a lot of warmists take data and imply things that simply aren't there or relevant.     Look at all that unabated warming! Looks quite scary! Until you actually look at the numbers and consider .3/.4C is within the margin for error, IE false readings and such. Thus no warming can reliably be claimed, and thus warmist trying to lower the bar to match the data rather than match reliable data to hit the bar.      And lest you forget, see the outrageous claims have been made about temp raising, affect on environment that simply haven't come to fruition and no one bothered to correct or apologize for making."

How can such complex models be trusted when they have not been reliable in the past?  How much data has been ""adjusted""? Why and according to what standards? There are numerous variables that affect the Earth's atmosphere. How can scientists be so sure they are all accounted for and accurately measured?  Recently, it has been stated that the oceans are absorbing excess heat. What's the next currently unknown variable to be brought to light?   While it makes sense to reduce the use of fossil fuels as the energy was stored years ago and is not part of the present atmosphere, the fear that is being pushed upon us that the human civilization will be brought to its knees in a couple generations is unfounded."

So on etc. You are right, it's far more complicated than you have made it out to be! Consider carbon has been higher, immensely so in previous eras, yet there were no detrimental affects. In fact, they were positive! Larger, less efficient life was supported by the climate, more places where crops could be grown, longer growing/harvesting seasons, etc.          Considering we got this data from ice cores in the arctic, one wonders how higher levels of carbon could exist along with the ice that theoretically should have melted under such levels of carbon which would, theoretically of course, cause much more heat!  But even that aside, carbon = heat in our climate is a correlation, not necessarily causation. We haven't found those warm spots in the atmosphere that would indicate heat is getting trapped by carbon. Not to mention historically we've had events where carbon followed heat, not vice versa which throws the entire thing into question.       But yeah, like you said, Terribly complicated ;)"

There was only one thermometer involved, and it was not inside a jar.   Glass is not transparent to CO2 (which is why Tyndall used rock-salt). Added to that, CO2 has no absorption bands in the short-wave infra red (SWIR) emitted by the heat lamp used. The contents of the jar was heated by convection and IR from the hot glass, and an increase in pressure at constant volume (PV = nRT).  Also see:   [Peer reviewed] paper proves Bill Nye's faked 'greenhouse effect' experiment is also based on the wrong 'basic physics'    ""All involve comparing the temperature rise in a container filled with air with that of the same or a similar container filled with carbon dioxide when exposed to radiation from the Sun or a heat lamp. Typically, a larger temperature rise is observed with carbon dioxide and the difference is attributed, explicitly or implicitly, to the physical phenomena responsible for the climate change. We argue here that great care is required in interpreting these demonstrations and, in particular, that for the case of the demonstration described by Lueddecke et al., the results arise primarily from processes related to convective heat transport that plays no role in climate change."""

Your premises: If you hold a belief that something is a myth, a conspiracy, or factually incorrect then there must be someone behind it; who is propagating the myth.   Your conclusion: If someone is propagating the myth, they are doing it for selfish purposes. If nobody is behind the myth, then its not actually a myth but is real.  Here are a few of your assumptions:   Corporations have incredible amounts of money, while the government doesn't.  Corporations are organizations that have self-interested and career focused people in them, the government does not.  The government is indifferent about whether AGW theory is accurate.  Corporations and Governments can be considered as a single unified entity, the motives and actions of individuals in those organizations can be ignored.  To put your argument into perspective I will use an example.  ""There are people who believe that God is simply a myth. But who is behind the idea that God is real? The Pope? The Clergy? Priests? Since none of these people in the church is responsible for their religion then there is only one explanation, that God is real.

climateskeptics,38eyuo,phondeux,16,Thu Jun 4 02:36:36 2015 UTC,"You need to do some study concerning what is a myth, and how myths arise. Man-made global warming is a real modern myth, and displays the same characteristics as the myths of ancient times, but AGW is a living myth whereas the myths about Zeus and Hades and Hera are dead myths -- people once believed in them and defended them, but no longer do. The modern myth of AGW is being actively defended in the same way the ancient myths were defended by their cults of believers.  No individual can deliberately make a myth. No organization can deliberately make a myth. Myths arise from the collective subconscious of a people, and are a response to fears and needs that may never be articulately expressed. I believe the modern AGW myth is a response to the worry that mankind is somehow destroying or killing the planet Earth. This is associated with the widely held conviction that the human race is somehow inherently evil. We see aspects of these two beliefs expressed every day in the media, which has made the myth of AGW a trendy, feel-good belief to embrace.  Individuals and groups cannot create living myths, but they can manipulate them and profit from them, just as the priest castes of old manipulated the ancient myths for their own ends, and profited from them. They can enforce belief, or at least lip service, by making sceptics shunned individuals. In ancient Greece disbelievers in the Mysteries were sometimes torn to pieces by fanatical cult members. We haven't quite reached this  level of fanaticism, but recent calls to criminalize scepticism show that we are only a skip and a jump away."

There is a lot to say and I can't possibly touch every aspect of this issue, because it's very complex. Look up game theory. This is not about a conspiracy, it's about the interest of each player involved. The government wants to sustain itself, it's just the nature of government. Governments always grow bigger and more expensive, never smaller and more efficient. So if climate change helps towards that goal (more regulation, higher taxes, more control), the government will do it. Everyone has skin in the game. Corporations get cheap loand and tax credits (wind mills, solar panel companies, Tesla, etc), scientists get research grants, regulators get job security, etc. It's a very complex game and every player tries to maximize their own profit, whatever that means for them. The government doesn't want climate change to be real, the only thing that the government wants is to strengthen its power, but it's not because of some dark room secret meetings, it's because every person involved wants to keep her/his job and please her/his boss."

Numerous people have vested interests in climate change. It vindicates environmentalists, resulting in more media support and attention, which results in more donations to conduct more operations and repeat the cycle.      Various folks who couldn't get into the ""Good ol boy's club"" of big oil decided to create their own club house-     1: Buy shares in green companies.      2: Create a demand for green products.     3: Create legislation that fines your competitors for not using your green companies recycled products or energy standards.      4: Profit.       The green industry is absolutely exploding in worth, but still only supplies a tiny degree of the energy the US consumes and the products are often niche. Other countries might be further along in dependence, but people are starting to realize it's not all sunshine and rainbows. In the netherlands somewhere I recall a story where people were told wind farms would result in cheaper, greener energy.     Instead they got slapped with far more expensive energy bills to pay off the wind farms for the next few decades and still have to rely on other sources to a degree.      That aside, consider the carbon market. Imagine the stock market, only you make up your own money and determine how much it is worth and who has it. Then you can take your carbon credits and cash them out for real money. No seriously, look it up.      There is no global conspiracy, there usually never is.

As for supplying the US with cheap oil, it's not necessarily some kind of oil scheme. In case you hadn't noticed it occurred almost immediately after Russia took Crimea (?) not when the green energy boom started. And likewise it has had a crippling affect on Russia's economy for their aggression. OPEC also tried to undersell the US oil to regain control of the market and force the US out, but they also failed. Hence the recent fluctuations.      The US oil production had a few affects. It undermines ISIS who is attempting to gain funds by selling oil at something like 25$ a barrel, and Russia who's main export is oil in light of their recent agression, as well as breaking the strangehold of OPEC.

climateskeptics,38eyuo,imjgaltstill,0,Wed Jun 3 22:43:56 2015 UTC,"Do you think that it's fair that the top 10% richest control 50% of the world's wealth?  Just kidding! It's the 1%  Nah, 0.1% actually  0.01%  Impressed? Stay on your seat  0.001%  Woah that's impressive, that's 1 in how much, a thousand? A million?  0.0001%  Yep, that's one in a million, but wait it's even less people than that  0.00001% that's one in ten million  0.000001% so many zeroes it doesn't even make sense anymore!  0.0000001% welcome ladies and gentlemen to the second lowest level, don't stand up yet though  0.00000002%  That's the number, rounded up, that's 85 people that control 50% of world's wealth. Is not the illuminati, is just bill gates and carlos slim and amancio ortega and the other richest people in the world (source).  Now I want you to think again about how it can possibly be fair that 50% of the world's wealth is being held hostage to the will of just 85 men. Those men control half of the economic world, they're the chosen ones by the capitalistic system, 85 people that have as much money as the remaining over 7000000000 people, over 50 million individuals each.  Now think if those people actually did something with their money, fortunately they actually invest it to make more money, that's why its called capitalism and not fascism, however now imagine that instead of feeding the production machine they actually helped the world, if their money was cruelly taken away to feed those who would literally die otherwise by the millions and to provide homes to the homeless who would otherwise die in the streets. So cruel for 85 people, so good for over 85000000 people at the very, very least.  85 people, in the time you've spent reading this that many people have died, and by the time you wake up tomorrow over 85 people will have died of entirely preventable causes, possibly 850 or more. How many people have to suffer so that the 1% richest (or even the 0.00000002% richest) can see a couple extra zeroes in their bank accounts?  Capitalism works, it is the way to go, but it needs to be regulated and the rich need to be taxed, a person can be just as happy with 10 million than with 10 billion (aka 10000000000 dollars), so why let'em waste that money in luxuries when there are people who are literally dying because they lack vaccines worth 1 dollar?"

So the rich should pay 100 times more, but get the same privileges like someone who doesn't pay tax at all? And you call that fair? Don't be silly.  Here is the best explanation of how our tax system works by a economics professor."
climateskeptics,38eyuo,imjgaltstill,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:22:54 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. That explanation is describing a simple mathematical mistake made by 9 people that doesn't really correlate with reality.  In reality the men just said: ""alright we're friends so we'll pay in direct proportion to how much money do we make so that we can all have beer"".  The poorest man was homeless, he couldn't buy enough food to eat everyday let alone a 10$ beer so it was only fair he didn't pay anything, the second one barely had a home so it was either a beer or being kicked out so it was still fair he didn't pay.  The third and fourth man were in a tough situation and they were still saving to fix their roof and heating respectively so the other men agreed they didn't have to pay for the beer.  The fifth and sixth man were ok, so they paid a little for the beer since they barely made it to the end of the month with a barely  acceptable lifestyle.  The seventh and eighth man were well-off so they could pay for such an expensive 10$ beer every day without much problem (their children would have to go to a public university and they wouldn't have enough money to buy a new car though).  The ninth man had a good job as lawyer and thus it was only fair he paid almost twice as much for a beer since he didn't have any of the worries of the previous eight men, he had a great house, two quality cars, a large pool, a lot of savings for the university of his children, hell he even felt a little guilty of enjoying life so much while his eight other friends had to struggle so much! So he paid those 18 dollars without thinking twice.  The tenth man owned a medium-sized company, he was envied by the rest as he had a nice mansion, several luxury cars and a yacht. However he tried not to show-off since he inherited the company from his father (he worked 40 hours a week at it though) and knew the others didn't have that much luck.  Then when the bartender lowered the price of the beer they got mad at that single rich man, he had won at life, but he just had the luck of being born in the right family. The third man was an orphan, the fifth man had to work 60 hours a week before finding the right job and the first one literally had to get into prison just to get food to eat and a bed to sleep (until he met the other friends).  Then while they were talking about how to share the money the tenth man made the mistake of talking about his new luxury car (he was a great fan of cars, it was his only passion and he knew everything you could know about them), however that was it and the other nine stopped thinking and chose to beat him up.  Was it fair for the tenth man to be beaten up? Was it fair for the others to have such a hard lives just because they weren't born in the right family? Or that they didn't have the right influences to lead them to success?  Nobody deserves more money than another person, so at the very, very least they need to contribute in the same proportion through their taxes. The last man didn't even mind paying, it was nothing to him, with 59 dollars the first man could have bought some cheap clothes for himself and food for an entire week, yet the last man didn't even think it was money, he didn't even understand the situation of the others and that's why he talked about luxury cars instead of letting them be.  The world is not a fair place, it's only fair that those who have it easiest have it a little harder so that those who have it the hardest can have it a little easier."

It isn't some devious top-down conspiracy orchestrated by a secret society of shadow agents like something out of a movie... rather it is a golden goose of justification born more by accident and coincidence than intent. When everything you ever wanted to do can be done in the name of 'saving the world', how can anyone stand in your way?  It is the perfect swiss-army-knife of a crisis that provides an exploitable 'ends' to justify any 'means' for busybodies of all types ... when the perks of a myth are so plentiful, you don't need to orchestrate it, people will fuel it and reinforce it themselves. Best of all, there is literally no way to ever know when the 'problem is solved'. It has provided for political ideologues & social engineers what 'terrorism' has provided for warmongers; justification for anything, indefinitely.  I think the timing is the most responsible for the hysteria; a 'threat' that gives a collective purpose & can satisfy everyone's hero complex is very attractive and soothing in the minds of a society with so few 'things left to fix', 'wars to fight', or 'causes to make their life mean something'.

climateskeptics,38bjli,Miguelinileugim,3,Wed Jun 3 06:19:45 2015 UTC,"Put an ice cube in a cup. Allow it to melt. Has the water level risen or fallen?     It will fall. In the ice is trapped oxygen (or in regards to the arctic, various gasses and matter) and a more rigid molecular structure not to mention most ice is already under the water. Not that we aren't getting record levels of ice in the antarctic anyhow.      More extreme weather? I seem to recall we're having record low extreme weather in general. Fewer hurricanes make landfall, much less become severe and destructive.      Extra dangerous sun rays? I thought the idea of global warming was that the atmosphere prevents heat from escaping. Wouldn't it prevent more radiation from entering if it's stopping things from getting out?"
climateskeptics,38bjli,kriegson,-1,Wed Jun 3 16:14:26 2015 UTC,"In the arctic it doesn't matter how much it melts the sea level will stay the same, in the antarctic though most of that ice is over the continent, being sustained by land, and thus if it melts the sea levels will rise.  Also, the fact that the ice caps are melting faster than ever proves that climate change is actually happening.  Also i don't know why you say that extreme weather is decaying.  Note: Ozone keeps UV rays within non-lethal levels, without it life on earth wouldn't exist outside of the sea, however ozone does not trap the heat inside of the atmosphere unlike CO2 and other gases, which are also thought to destroy ozone (not sure) and definitely don't filter UV rays."
climateskeptics,38bjli,Miguelinileugim,3,Wed Jun 3 16:23:10 2015 UTC,"We're getting record levels of sea ice in the antarctic through.     Of course climate change is happening, it's always happening. The debate is how much of it is caused by humanity and the problem is that many focus strictly on what is caused by humans as opposed to taking in both what occurs naturally and what can be attributed to mankind.    IPCC for instance excludes any natural items that might influence the climate. Hence monitoring carbon as opposed to more influential climate change gasses, like water vapor or methane.      Lack of hurricanes, Tornadoes, wildfires     If we're having less severe weather even occur then obviously we are having less extreme weather in general.      It's worth nothing the strongest greenhouse gas is water vapor, and of the existing carbon that contributed by mankind is infinitesimal. I don't see us causing any significant problems in solar radiation, considering."

And in regards to that, the 97% consensus simply doesn't exist. The supposed study that found it was a sham, I can explain why if you're curious.    Scientists aren't politicians... scientists are intellectuals and far more honest than the rest of society.       First off, most warmists cite the IPCC.

The government is just a puppet, just like nearly every politician, they just follow the power and the money, and in the US most of the power is private, corporate money.

Our popular media is filled with nothing but endless stories of death, destruction, and the apocalypse."
climateskeptics,387yfj,Florinator,2,Tue Jun 2 16:34:50 2015 UTC,"[Spoilers follow]  I just saw this. It's not really Global Warming themed. In fact its politics are fuzzy to the point of incoherence - a plot point is that there's a doohickey which makes people feel negative about the future because of some phlebotium and that negativity is going to lead to the apocalypse by means that are very vague indeed. The film mentions global warming, but nuclear bombs are shown going off too. It is implied that negativity stops NASA launching rockets for exploration but also makes a nuclear war more likely which is a bit like the theme of Interstellar retold by someone who didn't like its political implications.  I saw it based on the trailer because it looked cool. And it has some nice effects and George Clooney (grumpy), Hugh Laurie (grumpier), Britt Robertson (optimistic) and all play their rather cardboard cut out roles well. Raffey Cassidy's character is a bit more interesting and is basically an example of how to do child characters that aren't irritating as shit like Anakin Skywalker. Then again Disney should know how to do that because it's their livelihood.   In fact the fact that Robertson's character is recruited because ""she can fix things"" because she's optimistic. Her being optimistic and telling Clooney's character not to give up hope causes the probability of the world ending in 60 days to drop from 100.0% to 99.9994%. Which is dumb as hell, but it shows that we're dealing with Hollywood platitudes (""if you think positive, the world is affected""), not Hollywood politics. The ending is a complete deus ex machina that makes almost no sense at all.  So saying it's ""failing because it's Global Warming themed"" is a bit misleading. It's failing because you watch the trailer and think ""that looks interesting"" and by the ending you think ""is that it?"".   Also why has Clooney's character as built a doomsday countdown timer (accurate to the second!) out of Nixie tubes even though he has loads of technology from from an ultra advanced parallel reality and his probability of apocalypse (accurate to 0.00001%!) is displayed on a regular computer screen?  It does have some dumb ideas in it though - like idea that a society where 'dreamers and scientists' don't have to worry about 'money, politics and distractions' would be technically advanced. That's like kids believing if MOM didn't make them do CHORES everything would be great."

We don't disagree that human beings are affecting it. But we (or at least I) don't believe in some sort of catastrophic disaster whipping out the world populations. Don't believe there is some sort of ""tipping point"" at which the climate will enter a never ending warming cycle  There have been times in the past in which both temperature and carbon dioxide have been far higher than they are now. Carbon dioxide also has advantages that keep getting ignored because it is some sort of poison.The other problem I have is that all of these climate experts continue to make predictions that never come true later to claim that their models were incorrect. But yet these same models are used time and time again year after year to make predictions."

He implies that it is not only normal, but desirable to live through a 6C event. Then he implies that reaching Eemian maximum would be no big deal, conveniently forgetting to tell you that it took 3,000 years to reach those levels (that’s the width of the giant vertical spike on the graph). Then he tries to make the reader think that an ice age is more likely. Then he completely denies that there has been any temperature increase at all. While he's talking about how insignificant an 8% increase in CO2 is in the span of just 20 years, he forgets to tell the reader anything about the scales of his graphs, and he forgets to tell you that CO2 has never been as high as it is now on any of his temperature graphs.   C’mon – use your brain. Coral reefs can’t move to cooler water in 20 years – that’s why 50% of them are already dead.  You can’t grow a rainforest or an alpine meadow in 20 years either. It takes hundreds of years for biodiversity to migrate. What make you think that a vertical spike – and I mean vertical – less than 1 pixel resolution on the graph – will not cause truly devastating loss to our biosphere?

The ""scientific consensus"" was squarely against them.   See, even though by the early 1950's research was beginning to suggest a connection between these ulcers and bacterial infection, a paper written by a particularly influential researcher in 1954 concluded that bacteria couldn't survive in the stomach.   It was an uphill battle from that point on. Despite some successfully treating ulcers with antibiotics (including one who infected and cured himself in 1958), papers to this effect were routinely rejected or ignored.  Another paper in 1962 was published, once again supporting the consensus position.  Those pushing the antibiotic solution started being shunned at conferences, getting their papers outright rejected, and so on. In 1968 the same guy who'd previously cured himself with antibiotics way back in 1958 was fined for treating his present day patients with antibiotics.   The cause was taken up by other scientists, but the ""consensus"" establishment continued to harangue and delegitimize them all the way through to the 1990's.  That's forty years of ""consensus"" science actively working against the actual truth folks.  And even today it's not hard to find people who will make excuses or point to supposed flaws in the non-consensus papers or flat out deny they ever took the consensus position in the first place.  Anything about that sound reminiscent of another science debate presently underway?  The old saying is that science advances one retirement at a time.  That's what will happen in climate science. No meaningful progress will be made until the Manns and Trenberths and Desslers and Gleicks get old and drop off the radar."

CO2 emissions have been going up unabatedly, yet the temperature hasn't. Ergo, temperatures are not [that strongly] correlated with CO2. So the basic assumption of climate science (that CO2 is the main driver of climate) is wrong. Yet, instead of redoing the climate models, climate scientists insist that the heat must be somewhere else (the deep oceans for instance or the tropospheric hot spot or natural variability). Even if one or all these theories were true, it does not invalidate the fact that the climate models are wrong and must be scrapped. The main argument here is that if climate models can't model climate, then WTF?  Everything else that has to do with climate change (politics, government policies, regulation, etc) is based on this shoddy science (the climate models and their flawed predictions).

Lower real wages would have the net effect of reducing the amount that people worked, thus decreasing the overall supply of labor.

And I'm not talking about statistical significance, but something more similar to division by zero.  Take the second graph for example, with a slightly positive trend line drawn onto it. It's absolutely misleading, the underlying data has no trend whatsoever, and at no point is the variability outside what even a Mk 1 eyeball can discern as being ""normal"". What the data actually says is that for the past 25+ years the start of spring has been variable and that's about it.  The same thing in the first graph actually, only the first 3 years happen to be early springs, other than that the entire thing is perfectly within bounds of natural variation. Even with, since using linear trends for data like that is a fool's errand. And using flower blossoming dates as indicators for when it's spring? Madness. Both data series are way too short and variable to draw any conclusions.  What causes significant yearly changes in seasonal temperatures and start/end dates in Northern/Central Europe depends on where the wind happens to be blowing. Where I live if you happen to get a persistent and strong high-pressure system over western Russia in the winter, it will be bloody damn cold. If you get it during summer, it will be bloody damn hot. If there's a strong low pressure system in the North Atlantic, in general things will be milder either season."
climateskeptics,37yxdz,ascylon,4,Sun May 31 18:46:35 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed reading your comment and have a few thoughts on it:  1) If Fig. 2 were a company's gross sales, most any eyeball would say they were increasing over the past 28 years, with or without a helpful trend-line.  Global warming proponents insist the Earth is warming and have enshrined a 30 year data record length as being sufficient to draw a meaningful trend; if so, the slope should be negative instead of positive.  2) Natural variation implies trends over varying periods of time; for instance the trend since the Holocene Optimum is a negative temperature slope spanning many thousands of years. I don't see why natural variation should be discarded just because it's 'natural variation'.  3) The last paragraph is interesting but adds little to the argument. The causes for why temperatures are higher or lower than average are immaterial if the argument being made is about the presence or absence of a long term temperature trend."
climateskeptics,37yxdz,ascylon,2,Sun May 31 20:26:37 2015 UTC,"1) I disagree. I also dislike ""if this dataset represented something else, then you'd agree with me"" -arguments. Also whatever the global warming proponents say, 30 years is among the worst lengths for trying to discern trends related to human influences, especially without accounting for natural variation. The simple reason is that there are at least two known forms of natural variation that have exhibited a period of about 60 years in the past century, and have done so in a fairly synchronized fashion (AMO and PDO). ENSO variablity has also followed that same characteristic.  2) Natural variation should not be discarded, and that's exactly my point. With a very high variation compared to the length of the dataset, drawing any kind of linear trends is foolish, at best. In fact with most forms of climate data drawing linear trends without looking at the characteristics of the underlying data is only useful for propaganda purposes (""hey look at this linear trend and its statistical significance, this proves that a temperature has increased/decreased/done nothing!""). Trend estimation is only an aid in interpreting data, and like all statistical aids can mislead just as easily as aid if misused. Another reason why linear trends are silly is what you just said; they can be manipulated by cherrypicking start and end dates.  3) It is an attempt to point out that the characteristics of a dataset need to be understood before doing statistical analysis on it, or one is liable to shoot oneself in both feet. Whenever someone draws a linear trend (or any kind of statistical wiggle) it needs justification, because it is implied that a linear trend describes the data better than the data itself. Unless it is meant as a predictive statistical wiggle, but rarely in climate stuff it is."

Now you might think those 19% are calculated on the base of the net price of fuel. Cause you know, it would kinda make sense.

Every now and again you'll see an alarmist scientist spout some techno babble in order to justify making the claim during the height of the storm, but it's all pure speculation.    There has always been bad weather and floods and storms and droughts and all those things.  Sometimes they seem worse now, but mostly that's because today we have a lot more people and a lot more infrastructure than the past, so when something hits it's a lot more likely to impact people and create a stir. Add to that a worldwide communications network that allows for extensive media coverage of virtually any disaster, an insatiable appetite to fill 24hr news channels with content and a concerted propaganda push by those looking to use global warming as an excuse to implement their preferred political policy, and viola, it feels like a crisis when really it's just business as usual. Ever notice how six, twelve months later there's usually some report or other that comes out and says, well, the contribution of global warming to that weather event was actually inconclusive?  Of course it was.  But the general public never does, so the alarmism at the time served its political purpose, and was never meant to be anything more.  Remember, weather data is incredibly noisy. The only way to tell if global warming is making things worse is to tease out otherwise barely detectable trends over hundreds of years.  That's how little impact global warming really has on extreme weather.    Think of this: we've actually had over a hundred years of warming now since the end of the Little Ice Age. If weather was really as susceptible to tiny amounts of warming as alarmists claim, then there should be easily identifiable trends beginning way back then and extending until now. Those trends do not exist, or if they do they are so inconsequential, and particularly once population and infrastructure growth are controlled for, that they might as well not."

You end up with 'plausible assertability', the equally dishonest counterpart of 'plausible deniability'.  2) The old fallacy of the argument from authority: Authority has spoken. Authority is infallible. The matter is thereby settled. Who are you to question?   Yes, we do draw on the knowledge of experts all the time, and without this resource there would be scant progress in science. It is the assumption of infallibility that is at the root of this fallacy.

Start war, destroy utilities, use contractors that you own shares in to provide protection thus making your company more profitable, ditto with contractors rebuilding their utilities. Shipping weapons back is too expensive, so the US mil weapons they shipped over get sold off instead.   Same concept with climate change. Some scientists receive millions in funding, at that point it's a matter of simply justifying what they want to buy as a scientific expense. Several politicians own shares in green energy or buy them all and then force policy through that will require people to use their services or penalize those who don't. EX: Wind farms. Low output, high cost, low efficiency, but they become mandatory to place and use state funding to do it.  They own shares in the company and thus basically transferring state funds into their own pockets.      Not to mention the carbon market.

Your green energy programs can still happen, just not at the level they (and you, I believe) want it to.  Quick edit: where I spend my money is what this determines.

climateskeptics,37tz7s,cysghost,10,Sat May 30 14:18:31 2015 UTC,"You want silly or concrete facts?  Take a look at Germany and their 'Energiewende' policy of moving away from coal and nuclear (in the wake of Fukishima), which has had multiple negative effects on the people of Germany.  They have worked to shift to renewable energy on a huge scale, and one of the results is that the power grid has become very unstable due to surges and sags in power due to sudden changes in wind and sunlight.  The result is that in some areas, manufacturing plants have to shutdown during periods of low power output.    Another discovery of this shift is that because of the unreliable nature of renewables, many coal powerplants have to be kept idling, ready to be brought on line to take up the slack.  It cost the same amount to operate a powerplant at idle that produces no power as it does to run it at production capacity, and that cost has to be absorbed by someone, and in this case it has been passed on to the consumer.  So maintaining the new renewable energy sources along with the old has not reduced prices, but driven them up, resulting in what the Germans call ""Energy Poverty"" where the poorest people cannot afford electricity for their homes.  At last count I saw was near a million people.  So no, being one of the pioneers of renewable energy, and thus climate change mitigation efforts, is not good for your country or it's people, and has introduced third world conditions in one of the most advanced economies of the globe.  We can talk about  how the green energy push created extremely high unemployment in Spain next if you like.   If there is too much power coming from the grid, wind turbines have to be shut down. Nevertheless, consumers are still paying for the ""phantom electricity"" the turbines are theoretically generating. Occasionally, Germany has to pay fees to dump already subsidized green energy, creating what experts refer to as ""negative electricity prices."" On the other hand, when the wind suddenly stops blowing, and in particular during the cold season, supply becomes scarce. That's when heavy oil and coal power plants have to be fired up to close the gap, which is why Germany's energy producers in 2012 actually released more climate-damaging carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than in 2011. If there is still an electricity shortfall, energy-hungry plants like the ArcelorMittal steel mill in Hamburg are sometimes asked to shut down production to protect the grid. Of course, ordinary electricity customers are then expected to pay for the compensation these businesses are entitled to for lost profits...  ...When Stefan Becker of the Berlin office of the Catholic charity Caritas makes a house call, he likes to bring along a few energy-saving bulbs. Many residents still use old light bulbs, which consume a lot of electricity but are cheaper than newer bulbs. ""People here have to decide between spending money on an expensive energy-saving bulb or a hot meal,"" says Becker. In other words, saving energy is well and good -- but only if people can afford it.  http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/high-costs-and-errors-of-german-transition-to-renewable-energy-a-920288.html  WASHINGTON — The Spanish professor is puzzled. Why, Gabriel Calzada wonders, is the U.S. president recommending that America emulate the Spanish model for creating “green jobs” in “alternative energy” even though Spain’s unemployment rate is 18.1 percent — more than double the European Union average — partly because of spending on such jobs?  http://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/spains-experience-with-the-green-economy-save-the-planet-lose-some-jobs/"

As far as I know no one questions the existence of climate.   There are those who question the so called settled science. There isn't any science that is settled. Gravity, it seems that every so often scientists discover something in the universe that throws a wrench into their equations and make them question the laws of gravity.   Climate science as we know it today is in its infancy. We've only had weather satellites for 40 or so years. Those early satellites provided only cloud cover pictures and nothing more. Worldwide satellite weather observations providing moisture, temps and what not are not that old. To use sketchy data from 70-80-100 years ago and basing a science around it is faulty science to say the least and to say the science is settled is asinine and not worthy of real science. On top of all that, any scientist who doesn't accept questions about his work or shuns other theories/explanations isn't a true scientist. Then you have the science by consensus. Please name any other science that is done by consensus."

This is an assignment from John Cook's MOOC based in UVA, amirite?    I want to shed some light on the anti-climate change fanatics...   That terminology is very ambiguous. Do you mean people who are fanatically trying to prevent 'climate change', or do you mean the people the former characterize as 'deniers'? Yes, I know from context that you mean the latter, 'deniers', but this terminological slip up really reveals the degradation of thought and language that bad politics brings.    For instance, your partners dad who is so absorbed in political books...   You want 'My granny believes in Jeebus, so I put hot chili powder in her underwear. Har Har, serve the bitch right' kind of anecdotes - except with climate change skeptics instead of grannies who knit socks for orphans cos Jeebus told her it was a good thing.    ...that he believes their agenda and argument triumphs over any scientific report   Degradation of thought and language. Wrongly implies that 'the science is settled, the debate is over' and that any dissent must be based on irrational criteria.    Because seriously, whats the harm in looking out for the environment   I don't know where to begin on this one because it is so dishonest. See degradation of thought and language above. You take a very specific, very extreme political agenda, and rephrase it as a general feelgood agenda that only really perverse people could oppose. It is like defending Stalinism by saying 'whats the harm in looking out for worker's rights?'.   opposed to being stubborn and doing jack shit.

He devoted 25% of the program to Giordano Bruno and tried to paint him as a martyr of science who was killed by the big bad Christians for thinking too hard about the organization of the solar system. In reality, he was imprisoned for worshiping the Egyptian God Thoth and was given 10 years to recant his claims that Hermetism was the one true religion before they finally executed him. He only thought the earth revolved around the sun because he literally worshiped the sun, not because he was a great scientist.

You will never hear about the low tornado count in recent years, the lack of major hurricane landfalls on U.S. coasts over the past 10 years, or the low number of wildfires this year.

climateskeptics,37l4ls,cth1ic_warrior,-1,Thu May 28 17:54:37 2015 UTC,They just passed a bill in Alberta that says if students want a gay straight alliance club the school has to allow it. Which is fair.

climateskeptics,37l4ls,Muffy1234,15,Fri May 29 18:17:21 2015 UTC,"I disagree entirely. I have two kids in the  public school system in Alberta and both are subject to near relentless environmental and leftist proselytizing.  Leading up to the last provincial election my oldest's class was told to encourage their parents to vote NDP (Canada's most left-leaning politicians) because they would be ""best for the school system.""  Same went for my brother-in-law's kids across the city. His oldest, in the last year of high school and having recently become old enough to vote, routinely came home spouting NDP talking points and made no secret of his intention to vote for them.  He finally shut up about that and the evils of Keystone when his dad reminded him that he works in the oil patch, an NDP government could easily implement policies that would see him lose his job, and if his kid (with no plans for university or getting a job upon graduation) thought he was going to keep living for free in the basement forever he had another think coming.  Lincoln said ""The philosophy of the school room in one generation will be the philosophy of government in the next.""  As near as I can tell the school system is doing its best to put that in action."

climateskeptics,37l4ls,Florinator,-7,Thu May 28 18:49:27 2015 UTC,"That's odd because of all the years I've spent going through school at a public, same with siblings (one is just graduating) have never felt there was a great evironmentalist being forced on us.   And you do realize it's because of the PC not diversifying our economy from oil (not saying we shouldn't completely stop production of the oilsands/fracking) that Alberta lost so many jobs from falling oil prices? The oil companies have even said they'd are willing to talk with notley about the taxes on the companies. So no the NDP taking control of the province is not the end of the end of the world as many wild rosers proclaim"
climateskeptics,37l4ls,Muffy1234,8,Thu May 28 14:42:50 2015 UTC,"Why would I expect you to notice or think something that is a regular part of a students daily life is odd or biased? If that's how things always are then you have no reason to think it should or could be different.  But parents notice when their kids continuously come home and talk about this stuff, trust me.  While I agree that diversifying the Alberta economy is a good thing, people losing jobs in the energy industry thanks to a downturn in oil prices has absolutely nothing to do with whether that has happened.  Companies making money hire people as necessary to do work for them. Diversification or not all those people would still have been working there because their employers were making money, and now they're not.  Companies are willing to talk because they have no other choice so all that's left is to mitigate any potential damage.  But just today CNRL announced they were pulling WAY back in spending this year (by $2.5 billion) due to concerns over the NDP's plans, something they didn't do when prices first dropped.  And increasing taxes and royalties on an industry already under stress is a dumb idea that only leftists could think is a good one."
climateskeptics,37l4ls,moirende,-6,Thu May 28 17:31:21 2015 UTC,"Or only you and your far right friends hace noticed it because you hate all ideas that stray away from yours.  No, not all those people would still be working there because there would other options for employment aside from the oil and gas industry.  Really if the PCs didn't continually drop the taxes on the oil companies (THAT was a stupid idea), the NDP wouldn't have to worry about the awful financial situation the PCs left us in."
climateskeptics,37l4ls,Muffy1234,8,Thu May 28 17:50:52 2015 UTC,"Far right. Heh. I suppose in a world where someone who thinks anything short of full on socialism is far right, I might be.  And I don't hate ideas that stray from mine, either, except the dumb ones.  Like the ones the NDP seem to manufacture wholesale.  The rest of your comment basically boils down to you admitting you don't have the slightest idea how economies work.  That said, we certainly appear to agree that the PC's did an awful job managing the books and the tax revenues for oil and gas over the years.  For what it's worth, while I think the NDP are mostly idiots and fools and are going to be gone four years from now in a daze of scandals and mismanagement of pretty much everything, I don't take anything away from them for beating the PCs. They deserved to lose."
climateskeptics,37l4ls,moirende,0,Thu May 28 18:42:22 2015 UTC,"No, I don't fully support socialism. but it seems like a lot people here think anything left of PC is socialist. I disagree with the idea that the NDP manufacture bad ideas, do I support all tgere ideas? No. But they were better ideas than the Wild Rose.  Are you sure? Because it doesn't seem like you know how the economy works.  I think the biggest downfall for the PCs was that they didn't face much opposition for decades. Believe it or not I was torn between voting for NDP and PC, but like most of alberta found it tough to trust the PC after the big Redford incident and poor management of tge provinces taxes"

climateskeptics,37i30w,climate_control,-21,Wed May 27 20:12:40 2015 UTC,"Dumb. If there is anything resembling a ""church of environmentalism,"" it only exists because of the people who -- for some reason or another -- reject the prevailing science on climate change.  Without the ""skeptics,"" it would just be a cerebral effort to respond to the science -- the same way that we respond to science when it tells us things like whether or not we should smoke cigarettes.  Is there some science that tells us cigarettes aren't as bad as we think?  Sure.  Are the problems that come with cigarettes mostly problems that will happen in the future?  Yes.  And indeed, there exist some people who have lived past 100 after smoking cigarettes for decades.  Those people apparently have a different genetic makeup such that their body is able to resist the harmful effects of cigarettes for longer (they still would probably live longer without smoking).  But does this mean that you should then just keep smoking cigarettes until we get cancer, and then respond?  I'll let you decide.  And there are other analogies that are helpful for understanding why any logical society should do more about climate change.  For instance, do you spend all of your money in your paycheck every week because you assume your salary will keep increasing and you'll never have any emergencies?  In other words, do you make all of your decisions based on what feels right now or do you follow the simple principle that it's good to consider what experts would say about how best to prepare for the future?  Look at it this way: you have it all wrong if you think that it's smart at all to wait for 100% certainty before making a decision about anything.  If there's essentially above 90% certainty that some problem is happening, how is it logical to resist responding to that problem now?  Especially if you know that it will possibly be too late to respond after you have 100% certainty -- how does a smart person decide that the smart thing to do is to remain skeptical until you have that 100% certainty?"

In the religion of environmentalism, only the socialist scientists on the big-governments payroll can read raw-data and provide an opinion on it.  Fun Fact: A person does not need to be a scientist to understand the raw data behind the climate. The raw data shows that the temp of the planet has not risen since 1997 and I don't need to be a qualified scientist to say ""The temp of the planet has not risen since 1997"". A 3rd grader can see all of the holes in your argument.   If you are unmoved by NASA as a source then I'm certain there's nothing I can tell you to persuade you to think differently.   NASA is a big-government body that is paid by the socialist governments of both USA and the UN to say what the socialists want. So no, NASA is not a good source, it is a source filled with corruption.  Why not link to sources that:  A) Do not work for the government B) Do not work for a public college/university/entity C) Have never received even 1 cent from the government at any point in their life D) Have no ties to leftism, socialism, or communism. E) Has no political influence F) Posts ALL of the raw data and does not hide it (like the UN, IPCC, NASA, etc).  Almost most of the sources I read follow the above guidelines, which is why I do not believe in catastrophic man-made climate change.  Here's a list of over 400 qualified scientists that refute climate change:  http://joannenova.com.au/2013/09/monckton-honey-i-shrunk-the-consensus/  Why can't anyone (such as yourself) refute this entire website:  http://wattsupwiththat.com  I keep hearing you guys say that man-made climate change exists, and when I bring up links and sites, you never counter-argue them. You just call us idiot deniers and leave it at that. And that's the reason the vast majority of people don't believe in man-made climate change. One side (my side) continues to debate and provide raw data, the other side (yours) hides data, lies, is filled with political corruption, and is entirely made up of socialists."
climateskeptics,37i30w,angdev,-4,Wed May 27 23:24:31 2015 UTC,"The problem with what you're saying about people not counterarguing is that you throw a bunch of different information out and I'd have to write a dissertation to truly refute all of it.  I don't have time for that -- and you don't have time to refute all of the evidence I could throw at you.  You say I ignore all of the stuff you link but I can only imagine that you ignore all of the climate scientists who are almost universal in agreement on the issue.  But I'll indulge you just a bit.  The claim that climate change consensus is at 0.3% comes from a Christopher Monckton, who is apparently a British public speaker, conservative politician, and journalist.  Not sure what his credentials are beyond this but I have no reason to believe he understands climate change or scientific writing any better than the average journalist -- and I have reason to believe that he's got an agenda to advocate for a certain political point of view.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Monckton,_3rd_Viscount_Monckton_of_Brenchley  Apparently this guy comes up with the 0.3% figure because he says the 97% number was derived from a study where they ignored a huge percentage of the ""research"" on climate change.  He says that they threw out over 8000 research papers out of 11,944 on the topic because of a hidden agenda.  Monckton writes:  ""They examined 11,944 abstracts. But they arbitrarily threw out almost 8000 of them on the ground that they had not toed the Party Line by expressing the politically-correct opinion (or any opinion) on climate change.""  For starters, Monckton hasn't actually written a scientific article where he shows his work.  Therefore, I have no ideal way of seeing why he thinks that all of the supposed additional research should not have been excluded from the calculation.    Funny thing though -- the article he's talking about doesn't at all say what he says it does.  That is, it doesn't matter why he thinks these 8000 articles shouldn't have been excluded because HE'S WRONG -- there weren't 8000 articles that were excluded.  According to the original article he's referencing (see here:http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/2/024024/article), the 97.1% number comes from the analysis which showed that 10,188 out of 11,944 research articles from climate science journals agreed with the anthropomorphic global warming thesis.  A very small, insignificant number of articles were thrown out for reasons like they weren't peer reviewed or not climate related.  Anyway, why you and others here believe that you don't need to be a climate scientist to understand how to interpret the data is ridiculous.  I understand that you want to believe you understand the science but you just don't.  That's going to sound condescending but it's just a reality.  It's really not different than you claiming that you could perform brain surgery and me trying to tell you that you can't.  And then you'd say I was being condescending for questioning you.  I'm not saying you're stupid for being unable to fully understand the research.  I'm saying you can't understand it and most people can't truly understand it.  Sure, you understand some of it -- maybe you can understand climate science the way that a nurse or a medical equipment sales representative understands certain aspects of surgery.  But you don't understand it well enough to perform an analysis or read the data the way an expert can."

It's really not different than you claiming that you could perform brain surgery and me trying to tell you that you can't. And then you'd say I was being condescending for questioning you.   This is an incorrect analogy. If all I needed to do to perform a brain surgery was read in some simple numbers of a raw data stream then your analogy is correct.  Do I need to be a scientist to read the temperature from a thermometer? How about 2 thermometers? How about 3 thermometers? Can't a simpleton such as myself read a number? Like take this example: 35, 50. Which of these two numbers is larger? Do I need science to understand this? No, I do not. Thus I do not need to be a scientist to understand climate change. Other qualified individuals, mostly scientists and engineers, take measurements of things like the Earth's temperature and CO2 levels, and place them in what is called ""a log"". This log has numbers like this: 23, 60, 35, 69, 69, 69, 12. I look at these numbers, think for 3 seconds, and conclude ""catastrophic man made climate change does not exist"".

Again, I understand that you think that this is sufficient to understand the data.  But I guarantee you that even a climate scientist who questions the data would tell you that you can't understand the data.  Anyway, I'm not sure why you say that the CO2 levels on earth or the earth's temperatures would support your arguments anyway.  The warmest years in recorded history are all from the last 20 years.  CO2 levels are higher than they've been in recorded history.  Which numbers are you looking at?"

Which numbers are you looking at?   Well for starters according to this scientist (35m video) the Earth was much much warmer in the past than currently, and we are still 4-6 degree's C colder than average. Also, CO2 levels have increased anywhere from 10%-30% since 1997 yet the planet has remained the same temperature since then. Also, just because CO2 and Temp may be linked, why do you believe CO2 causes Temp to rise? Isn't it just as likely that rising Temps causes a rise in CO2? Isn't it the Sun, not CO2, that warms our planet? Causes day to be hotter than night? Summer to be hotter than winter? The Sun is what controls our climate, not humans, and not CO2. The correlation between the sun's solar activity and our Earth's temperature is very high. The correlation between CO2 and temp is almost 0."

And then there is the issue of recorded history. What is it? 150 years? Geophysicists laugh at you... you think you've figured out how climate works based on 150 years of rudimentary observations. I bet you didn't know that weather stations were never intended to study climate! The surface temperature data is so bad NCDC adjusts it constantly.

Which brings us to the reality that some social or public health problems are things that the public doesn't sufficiently recognize on their own as problems they can or should be concerned about.  For example, decades of improvements in vaccinations against horrible diseases has led a significant chunk of the population to think that we don't need some or all of the vaccinations we're getting.  We need experts to inform the public about such things.  And so every nation has experts trying to inform the public about the problem.  And if you look at polling numbers by country here (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_opinion_by_country), you'll see that the developed nations tend to have higher levels of concern than non-developed nations.

Medicine still isn't climate science, and never will be, no matter how many inapplicable analogies you make.  .   And in close to half of all countries climate change is perceived as a threat.   Your wikipedia link is to a poll from 2008.  Now its easy to get people to say ""yes"" when asked if they are concerned about climate change.  It does well in a vacuum.  Now ask people to rate climate change in terms of all their other problems, and you'll find polls consistently show it to be dead last.  .   I don't watch MSNBC. I read science journals.   You certainly don't seem to cite any scientific facts or arguments.  Indeed, nearly every one of your arguments is either a terribly inaccurate analogy or a blatant appeal to authority.  You haven't mentioned a single number or measurement.  Not very scientific.  You may not watch MSNBC, but you use the exact same arguments and analogies.  They're all standard low-level, dumbed-down talking points for people who need it simplified.  .

That you presume that the dumbest, most alarmist claims by some loud voices about the climate change problem represent what all people believe if they accept the prevailing climate change science.  It's not a moral crusade at all.  It's a basic concern for the near and far away future of the planet for generations alive now and future generations.  It's a commitment to accepting the science which says that (1) the amount of carbon in the atmosphere is at a modern historical high, (2) humans are causing this, (3) this problem is warming the earth, (4) within a few decades, if the average temperature rises by just a few degrees fahrenheit, the global ecology could become destabilized. (5) Much of the problem is the unknown.  How will these changes affect species of plants or animals, for instance, that our global ecology depends on?  How will the ecological changes affect the severity of weather patterns?  How will these changes affect ice formations around the world?  Is it true, as many experts claim, that millions or billions of people will become displaced and will have to move?  Theories suggest that with the whole global ecology being altered more rapidly than in history could cause severe problems.  None of this is the kind of alarmism which says stuff like ""the earth will flood"" or ""storms will kill billions of people at a time.""  Like I said, the greatest concern is for the unknowns, the projected possibility that small increases in the average global temperature could cause lots of little changes to the global ecology with extraordinary global effects.  Now given all of that, consider the other side of this, which is what climate scientists and politicians on the side of climate change acceptance believe needs to happen to address these potential problems.  If we listened to you, you'd think they were asking you to give away your children and all of your possessions.  But all we're saying is that we could do things like make significant changes in favor of investments and subsidies for companies in the renewable energy industry.  Electric cars.  Solar/wind energy.  Etc....   Even if for some reason the climate skeptics are right, there is literally only good to be had from shifting towards renewable energy.

You alarmists seem to think that renewable can replace fossil fuels without disrupting the economy at all.  You're deluded and the alarmist's incredible regressive policies have lead to dramatic hikes in the cost of everything, particularly food and energy.

That is, the observations support the inclusion of the Iris effect in skillful climate models.    This doesn't make sense. The observations aren't better explained by CMIP5. The models more closely match satellite readings when factoring in the Iris effect.   In order to have observational data to support the iris effect, one would need to gather real life measurements on specific properties of the Iris effect. Take for example, what the paper says:   But a drier upper troposphere would also allow more solar radiation to be absorbed by the Earth and atmosphere, rather than reflected back to space by the clouds, so that the net effect of reducing high clouds is not obvious. On balance, the effect is thought to be negative. The estimate of climate sensitivity with an iris effect, however, depends not only on the rate of reduction of high-level clouds, but also on the cloud optical properties of the most sensitive clouds. If the thinnest clouds are preferentially removed, the effect on outgoing longwave radiation is stronger than that on reflectivity, and the iris effect is stronger. On the other hand, if the reduction in cloud cover affects thicker clouds more strongly, the loss in reflectivity plays a more important role, and the iris effect is less pronounced.    They're even saying it right here. Nothing in this paper shows data for the optical properties of thin clouds and its relation to climate sensitivity."
climateskeptics,37go3p,lcd_monitor,5,Wed May 27 15:42:29 2015 UTC,"The models more closely match satellite readings when factoring in the Iris effect.   Agreed.

They can discount other methods, such as aerosols, because the limited actual gathered and experimental data shows that these aerosols do not have as strong a negative forcing as previously believed.   The experimental and gathered data doesn't quantify how real, or to what extent, the iris effect will have; it is just a ""best guess"" value similar to the ""best guess"" value that aerosols had before they were actually quantified using real data."
climateskeptics,37go3p,lcd_monitor,4,Wed May 27 16:02:22 2015 UTC,"the authors disagree with you    The paper is titled ""Missing iris effect as a possible cause of muted hydrological change and high climate sensitivity in models.""  This is a brazen challenge by the authors to other climate scientists to find a better explanation for the evidence than Lindzen's Iris effect.    I'm sure we'll see some responses, but your ""something else might be able to do exactly the same thing as the Iris effect but not actually be the Iris effect"" is nothing but wordplay."
climateskeptics,37go3p,technologyisnatural,1 point,Wed May 27 16:24:53 2015 UTC,"You can read the paper itself. You'll see many qualifications, such as:   But a drier upper troposphere would also allow more solar radiation to be absorbed by the Earth and atmosphere, rather than reflected back to space by the clouds, so that the net effect of reducing high clouds is not obvious. On balance, the effect is thought to be negative. The estimate of climate sensitivity with an iris effect, however, depends not only on the rate of reduction of high-level clouds, but also on the cloud optical properties of the most sensitive clouds. If the thinnest clouds are preferentially removed, the effect on outgoing longwave radiation is stronger than that on reflectivity, and the iris effect is stronger. On the other hand, if the reduction in cloud cover affects thicker clouds more strongly, the loss in reflectivity plays a more important role, and the iris effect is less pronounced.    There are a lot of ifs here and no new experimental or gathered data to guide the navigation of said ifs. It doesn't mean it's not interesting or invalid."
climateskeptics,37go3p,lcd_monitor,7,Wed May 27 16:36:07 2015 UTC,Your quoting is really misleading.  You're grabbing sentences from multiple paragraphs which are explaining all the evidence for the Iris effect.  That last bit you keep quoting is just talking about the strength of the effect.    Your actions are ridiculous because I linked the actual article above.  Anyone can read it and see that you are just trying to sow confusion.

The presence in or introduction into the environment of a substance or thing that has harmful or poisonous effects.  Now consider:  Carbon dioxide content in fresh air (averaged between sea-level and 10 kPa level, i.e., about 30 km altitude) varies between 0.036% (360 ppm) and 0.041% (410 ppm), depending on the location.  In greenhouses, CO2 is increased to 0.15% 1,500 ppm to improve plant health.  Based on the above, carbon dioxide is not pollution.  When does it become pollution?  In concentrations up to 1% (10,000 ppm), it will make some people feel drowsy and give the lungs a stuffy feeling. Concentrations of 7% to 10% (70,000 to 100,000 ppm) may cause suffocation, even in the presence of sufficient oxygen, manifesting as dizziness, headache, visual and hearing dysfunction, and unconsciousness within a few minutes to an hour."

Oh, wait, heavy precipitation events have been predicted to be a consequence of climate change for decades:   Changes in the probability of heavy precipitation: Important indicators of climatic change, Groisman et al 1999  Edit (emphasis added by me):  Climate Change 2007: Working Group I: The Physical Science Basis - 10.3.6.1 Precipitation Extremes   A long-standing result from global coupled models noted in the TAR is a projected increase in the chance of summer drying in the mid-latitudes in a future warmer climate with associated increased risk of drought. This is shown in Figure 10.12, and has been documented in the more recent generation of models (Burke et al., 2006; Meehl et al., 2006b; Rowell and Jones, 2006). For example, Wang (2005) analyse 15 recent AOGCMs and show that in a future warmer climate, the models simulate summer dryness in most parts of the northern subtropics and mid-latitudes, but with a large range in the amplitude of summer dryness across models. Droughts associated with this summer drying could result in regional vegetation die-offs (Breshears et al., 2005) and contribute to an increase in the percentage of land area experiencing drought at any one time, for example, extreme drought increasing from 1% of present-day land area to 30% by the end of the century in the A2 scenario (Burke et al., 2006). Drier soil conditions can also contribute to more severe heat waves as discussed in Section 10.3.6.2 (Brabson et al., 2005).  Associated with the risk of drying is a projected increase in the chance of intense precipitation and flooding. Although somewhat counter-intuitive, this is because precipitation is projected to be concentrated into more intense events, with longer periods of little precipitation in between. Therefore, intense and heavy episodic rainfall events with high runoff amounts are interspersed with longer relatively dry periods with increased evapotranspiration, particularly in the subtropics as discussed in Section 10.3.6.2 in relation to Figure 10.19 (Frei et al., 1998; Allen and Ingram, 2002; Palmer and Räisänen, 2002; Christensen and Christensen, 2003; Beniston, 2004; Christensen and Christensen, 2004; Pal et al., 2004; Meehl et al., 2005a). However, increases in the frequency of dry days do not necessarily mean a decrease in the frequency of extreme high rainfall events depending on the threshold used to define such events (Barnett et al., 2006). Another aspect of these changes has been related to the mean changes in precipitation, with wet extremes becoming more severe in many areas where mean precipitation increases, and dry extremes where the mean precipitation decreases (Kharin and Zwiers, 2005; Meehl et al., 2005a; Räisänen, 2005a; Barnett et al., 2006). However, analysis of the 53-member perturbed physics ensemble indicates that the change in the frequency of extreme precipitation at an individual location can be difficult to estimate definitively due to model parametrization uncertainty (Barnett et al., 2006). Some specific regional aspects of these changes in precipitation extremes are discussed further in Chapter 11.  [...]"

The whole thing stems back a number of years when a bunch of far left people started attending cons and being quite rude and disruptive to authors who demonstrated conservative leanings in their writing or personal lives, to the point where panelists would see half the room get up and leave the moment they started to speak, regardless of the topic.  Some writers felt that the Hugo's had in effect been hijacked by so-called ""Social Justice Warriors"" who were making sure only the writers they approved of were being nominated.  Most of whom, as it turned out, were those with pretty far left political leanings.  Personally it wasn't something I noticed much though I'll admit that seeing Scalzi and Stross nominated year after year for some pretty mediocre stuff (they have good stuff too) was making me scratch my head.  Anyway, this group of conservative-ish writers started publishing a slate of works that they thought were deserving and encouraging their readers to buy memberships to Worldcon and vote.  Scandal! Outrage!  Despite this sort of thing being common practise, apparently it was only okay when the proper sort of people did it.  And then unfortunately this really loco dude (who also figured in the Gamergate controversy in a big way) latched on to it and published his own slate and got so many people to buy memberships and vote that almost all the nominees were his slate.  Sigh. So now maybe the Hugo's will be a giant disaster this year with maybe even no awards given out.

Data gathered by the military and intelligence agencies is often of much higher quality than what civilian scientists normally work with.

EDIT: The reason I ask is that I don't think you're talking about the same climate models. The climate models used for climate projections model the fully 3D equations of fluid dynamics on a spherical (or, for some models like the UK Met Office, oblate spheroidal) Earth, with correct dimensions. One can verify this by hunting down some climate model code. For example, NASA GISS make the code for a slightly old version of Model E available here. I downloaded the source code and found the value of the Earth's radius to be set (in a single place) to be 6375 km, which is pretty much right (the exact value depends on how the model handles the Earth's not-quite-spherical shape). I also find it unlikely the model would break by changing the Earth radius a bit, considering one can spin them backwards and still find sensible results. If one changed the Earth's radius by a lot one would get very different results - probably multiple jet streams as observed on Jupiter. In other words, you can't model an Earth-like climate with a non-Earth-like planetary radius. Fortunately, climate modellers aren't stupid and they therefore set the Earth's radius correctly."

If you put an ice cube in water and let it melt, it should raise, right? Wrong. So stay the same? Still wrong.

Melting arctic (btw antarctic is gaining record breaking ice levels, some observation posts actually had to be abandoned if I recall?) would cause the sea levels to lower.      Carbon is beneficial to plant growth, as is raised temperatures. And water vapor. Hence a green house being used to grow plants.

The climate is non-linear chaotic system.  Specifying all reasons for past changes is not only difficult, it would be computationally impossible.   Yet, if one could determine what boundaries past climatic changes stayed within, there would be a basis upon which to suggest that maybe an excursion outside those historical bounds might have a heretofore non-existent cause.    But, this is where you've gone right outside the bounds of what can be described as the scientific method and straight into Crank-town:   This ""paper"" does nothing to present any new evidence that the same reasons for historic natural warming are occurring now.   One merely needs to point out that the existing evidence doesn't rule out natural variation. No new evidence is required.

I am genuinely curious what the logic behind climate skepticism is, and why you think the points I've outlined above are somehow illogical?  Please try to answer without mentioning the usual references to Al Gore, climate religion, doomsday, etc. I get all that, I appreciate that. I'm more interested in the logical process you've gone through to conclude that humanity can't possibly influence the atmosphere, and why you believe it's perfectly normal and healthy to extract 40+ gigatons of fossil carbons each and every year, in perpetuity, without some long-term consequences.  Please explain. Thanks!"

The reef was severely damaged by ­Typhoon Sendong in 2011 and Typhoon Pablo in 2012. ­Researchers estimate coral damage at 99 per cent.

Typical ""have cake and eat it too"" mentality that money grows on trees or rich people should pay for everything.  They want to deny that a rise in CO2 actually helps grow the plants to help end the world hunger they constantly crusade over.  They want the earth to get cooler despite all the historic evidence that if it got cooler, we'd have massive famine (can't grow anything if the ground is frozen).  They believe that water will magically disappear if the earth warms up and ice caps melt, although basic science would point to more rain (and more plants!) in some areas while some may get drier.  Bernie Sanders' appeal is that he is anti-rich and promises to go after the evil bankers.  I'm no fan of rich people myself, but I'm even less a fan of poor people.  As a middle classer, I know that any policies he will enact will only pass the burden to the middle class to help the poor.

As far as I can tell, 100% of the current ""warming"" is adjustments.  Also, the temperatures are rounded to the nearest whole degree when they are reported, and most of the thermometers used are only accurate to within about a half a degree,  meaning that we don't really know, within a half a degree or so, what the actual temperature is.    And thirdly, our thermometers are almost all placed within areas which have seen massive amounts of urbanization within the last 100 years.  Where they may have been dirt roads and tiny wooden houses, with carts pulled by horses, 100 years ago, now they are surrounded by asphalt, concrete, cars, jet airplanes, air-conditioners, electrical equipment and all sorts of heat producing items.    The scientists do try to homogenize, but they do so by averaging too warm stations with less-affected stations, and this mostly has the effect of adding to the warm bias of the record, not reducing it.  There are hundreds of documented cases of stations showing warmer temperatures in the present after homogenization, rather than showing a proper lowering of the adjusted numbers.  We very well might be seeing warming at some level, but I don't trust that the numbers they are using are right within a half a degree.     If you put error bars around the temperatures shown, today's temperatures and the 1940s overlap.  Yes, I believe wholeheartedly that we are warmer now than we were in the 1970s.

climateskeptics,36j9tv,technologyisnatural,3,Wed May 20 22:24:28 2015 UTC,"Well, that's an interesting way of putting it. A simple answer is that the effects of climate changes are so pervasive that they clearly will impact peoples' lives. People in poor countries are more vulnerable to climate changes, so these groups will suffer more. In general I think its groups that are already vulnerable to natural climatic hazards who will suffer most.  Some countries (in parts of the subtropics, for example) are at risk of important climatic shifts which will impact their ability to feed, hydrate and generally look after their populations. Some of these people are likely in for a tough time."

Poor people don't have resilient infrastructure, so they will suffer from the extra 2σ weather events.   But the poor suffer from the current 2σ weather events as well.  The obvious solution - independent of the impact claim - is to establish a resilient infrastructure.  But that doesn't come from handouts (as amply demonstrated in the 'good intentions are not enough' debate), it comes from organic economic development.  And I think most people are aware at this point that, after political stability, cheap high quality energy is the driver of economic development.  Greenist energy policy recommends deliberately raising energy prices worldwide - perversely preventing vulnerable populations from establishing the infrastructure they need to lower the impact of even today's environmental challenges."

climateskeptics,36ebrn,Florinator,-5,Tue May 19 00:17:15 2015 UTC,the best analogy is that climate change acts to load the dice to favor extreme outcomes for weather.
climateskeptics,36ebrn,PCCP82,5,Tue May 19 00:22:52 2015 UTC,"It would be a nice analogy, if it were true, but it's not. When the earth is warming (like it did in the 90's), we observed that the warming is more pronounced at the poles and less near the equator. The difference in temperature between the poles and the equator is one of the factors that drives the weather. More temperature and pressure differential, more energy, more violent storms; less of that, smaller storms. So basically global warming means less extreme weather. At least that's what the IPCC is saying..."
climateskeptics,36ebrn,0phantom0,-4,Tue May 19 01:52:14 2015 UTC,"no actually its the opposite. you are making it worse. the temp difference is still quite high. its below freezing on Greenland atm.   you are weakening the polar jet stream by reducing the temp difference between the two. It used to be able to separate the mid latitude climate from the polar one. there will still be a lot of baroclinic energy-- hence reasons why Boston got so much snow.  very cold air displaced by jet stream? check. very warm water from gulf stream off the coast? check. coastal storms? check.  One of the concerns is that the planet could go from a 3 cell climate ( tropics, mid latitude, polar) to a 2 cell system. but that's just a hypothesis that may eventually take on predictive value once you guys are done getting in the way so that nothing could have been done to prevent it.  oh, and plus when you warm the air up, it can hold more water vapor. so that's going to be a thing."
climateskeptics,36ebrn,0phantom0,5,Tue May 19 02:16:36 2015 UTC,"so if we have a monster hurricane season with hurricane after hurricane, we can certainly say its NOT because of global warming, or that global warming is pausing more?"
climateskeptics,36ebrn,PCCP82,5,Tue May 19 00:14:02 2015 UTC,"No matter what happens, or doesn't happen, it's because of global warming. Except if it cools, then we call it climate change.  One thing we know for a FACT is that the climate has never not changed by natural means. We know that for a fact, that before humans it got much hotter and it got much colder. What most people disagree with is that the greenies (green cuz of all the grant $$ thrown at them) claim that the climate will stay exactly the same if humans reduced Co2. Which is absolutely stupid because we know it's not so because history says otherwise.  To me it reminds me of junk science. The climate researchers know absolutely nothing about the climate. It reminds me of the way medicine was practiced before we had any clue of germ theory. The quackery that went on during the 18th and 19th century by doctors is laughable today, but they were absolutely serious about the 'science' of blood letting. Let's have fun with radiation! Don't you know that mercury cures all ails? Have a headache? Take some narcotics - it's perfectly safe! These are doctors, some of the most respectable professions - and the 'settled science' of the day was that radiation is perfectly safe!  The 'settled science' community has a track record of being so absolutely wrong, as with the prediction of hurricanes. You bet if we had record hurricanes for natural reasons they'd be claiming it for global warming, just as they're claiming the lack of it. It's time to start setting benchmarks. You want to claim it's settled? Then set some benchmarks. Give us something we can judge your science on. You think hurricanes will decrease - let's make that a benchmark. You think the temperature will increase by X degrees - let's set that as a benchmark. You say the ice caps will melt? Let's set a benchmark.

climateskeptics,36fdp5,Feldheld,5,Tue May 19 03:10:57 2015 UTC,It's what you'd expect from the Ice Worship Cult
climateskeptics,36fdp5,logicalprogressive,3,Tue May 19 03:34:58 2015 UTC,Tell that to the people in Boston!
climateskeptics,36fdp5,Florinator,-5,Tue May 19 02:03:22 2015 UTC,"the cause of Bostons extreme cold weather was caused by a persistent ridge near Alaska. high amplitude event. this happened through most of winter-- hence why cali is dry and hot and Boston got hit as bad as they did.  speaking of Alaska, that ridge is still there. its 40 degrees above normal all this week in Alaska above the arctic circle. all of the snow has melted way ahead of schedule, and its about to be 24 hour sunlight there.  can't have it both ways you fucking dipshit."
climateskeptics,36fdp5,PCCP82,5,Tue May 19 02:46:32 2015 UTC,"can't have it both ways you fucking dipshit.   True, I can't, but apparently you can. So why don't you go fuck yourself?"
climateskeptics,36fdp5,Florinator,-1,Tue May 19 02:57:13 2015 UTC,"the agricultural zones shifting north was predicted since the 1990s.  the high amplitude weather patterns we have been experiencing is a consequence of the future. despite perfect weather conditions for extreme cold, it wasn't a record cold season for Boston. Feb-April was 5 degrees F below normal; good enough for 2nd coldest and coldest since 1916.  But lets talk about whats going on in the arctic circle, and how places in extreme northern Canada just smashed their all time high record for May by 10 degrees Celsius. on May 18th.  models show that part of the world being up to 40 degrees F above normal for the next week with no break. 40 degrees above normal.   oh, and the sea ice is breaking apart north of river Mackenzie.   its May 18th. one month until the equinox."
climateskeptics,36fdp5,PCCP82,5,Tue May 19 03:21:33 2015 UTC,"Washington DC broke a 130 year old record for cold this winter. The Hudson river was still frozen in March, when cherry trees used to be in full blossom in prior years. And Denver, CO had snow on Mother's Day. What's your point?"
climateskeptics,36fdp5,Florinator,-2,Tue May 19 03:24:41 2015 UTC,"none of those things matter though, and they are all set up by one degree or another, arctic amplification. that's the point-- zonal flow was almost non existent this winter. that could be the new norm.  and the point is, this week, its about to get real north of Alaska. if you don't appreciate that ice reflects most of the suns rays that hit it back to space, and oh by the way, its 40 fucking degrees above normal on the shore of the arctic ocean and they are about to have 24 hours of sunlight for 2 months, then you are too incompetent for this conversation."
climateskeptics,36fdp5,PCCP82,6,Tue May 19 03:33:55 2015 UTC,"Meanwhile Antarctica is gaining ice and the Mawson research station might have to be closed since they are having a hard time getting supplies to it because of too much sea ice in the way. That's a lot of sun rays being reflected back to space...   then you are too incompetent for this conversation.   Aw, how cute, you managed to drop an insult as well. I don't blame you though, when you're lacking good arguments you throw in everything you have."
climateskeptics,36fdp5,Florinator,-1,Tue May 19 03:54:04 2015 UTC,"Antarctica is gaining ice because the glaciers are flowing into the sea, and the freshwater sits on top of the salt water and it freezes easier...  but the ice melts all the same every year. there are only significant differences as the ice gets close to to March minimum. Antarctica is not at risk of melting out anytime soon....  but the arctic is a litttttle different. most of the sea ice there is 1.5-2 meters thick."
climateskeptics,36fdp5,PCCP82,6,Tue May 19 04:05:54 2015 UTC,"So overall, do we have more of sun's rays reflected back into space or less?"
climateskeptics,36fdp5,Florinator,-5,Tue May 19 04:17:27 2015 UTC,less
climateskeptics,36fdp5,PCCP82,-1,Tue May 19 11:02:02 2015 UTC,"More crop supporting reigons would be all well and good, but negitive effects will likely outweigh the benefits.  Some already warm crop supporting reigons will become less arable with the warming climate, changing rainfall patterns will leave some croplands dry (but could create good growing conditions in new locations.) and more frequent extreme weather events, as well as more common pests and pathogens will cut into crop yeild."
climateskeptics,36fdp5,DrRoflsauce117,1 point,Tue May 19 04:28:37 2015 UTC,"To add to that most regions (for Canada at least) that are suitable for agriculture are farmed or ranched already and a main reason we do not farm the forested areas. Is because the soils are very poor for growing crops (high pH, low organic matter, usually high clay content in A and B horizons, etc.)."
climateskeptics,36fdp5,Muffy1234,6,Tue May 19 05:47:49 2015 UTC,"Hey Muffy, serious question, it looks like you know biology and I've been wondering about soil pH and that kind of stuff. I rake my leaves from the lawn when the trees shed them and in past years I used to just dump them, but this year I decided to use them as mulch (poor man's mulch, if you will). I got a fig tree a few months ago and covered the area around it with these leaves. Was that a good idea? Will the decomposing leaves help the soil as far as the fig tree is concerned or harm it? How do I check the soil pH?"
climateskeptics,36fdp5,Florinator,2,Tue May 19 14:39:30 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply. From what I've read about fig trees is they are a fairly hardy plant when it comes to pH so they can tolerate slightly acidic conditions. Which means as long as you aren't using a lot of pine needles or have dog that will urinate on the tree your soil pH should be fine. Now for testing soil pH you can check some hardware stores (do you have a Lowe's?) Or you can buy kits online at amazon.   For the mulch I would grind it up make it damp and place it about a foot below the surface around the root system (this stimulates decomposition and will keep the soil moist). Make sure not to put too much mulch around the roots though just to make it doesn't become anoxic (I can't tell you the proper amount as this varies location to location. Just make keep am eye on the tree to make sure it doesn't start to die off). Overall mulch will help your tree and I would recommend doing it. On a side note, if you want nice flowers and fruits from your fig tree routinely add fertilizer that is high in phosphorus  (>20%).  Hope that helps!"
climateskeptics,36fdp5,Muffy1234,3,Tue May 19 23:02:28 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the detailed reply, it is much appreciated! This fig tree is a very recent fixation of mine... I'm quite familiar with subsistence farming from my childhood in a faraway land and I hated it back then, but today I see things in a different light. Seeing food grow is friggin' fascinating. I'm having delusions of quitting my engineering job and growing orchards... Anyways, I can't wait to taste these puppies!"

Yeah I've primarily worked in agriculture (research, private industry, and inspection/regulation) and I definitely know what you mean by appreciating growing food (that's why I loved the research so much). Hopefully they turn out for you!"

climateskeptics,36durj,breakwater,7,Mon May 18 19:13:55 2015 UTC,What intensity? There hasn't been a major hurricane hit in 9+ years.
climateskeptics,36durj,0phantom0,-2,Tue May 19 00:21:26 2015 UTC,"that only counts if you:  1) only give a shit about USA 2) don't consider Sandy a hurricane, despite only being outdone by Katrina in terms of cost of dmg  I agree that the Atlantic Basin has been quiet, and hurricane genesis involves a few factors. its unclear about what the effects of windshear might be, but about the limit of where predictions can be made is that the potential for more intense storms exists by virtue of increased water temperatures.  there have been 5 cat 5's in the pacific in 2015 already."
climateskeptics,36durj,PCCP82,6,Tue May 19 02:29:19 2015 UTC,"Al Gore and his awesome super truthful (factually incorrect) movie said we'd have more hurricanes. Everybody was drinking the ""more hurricane"" Kool Aid. How much money was raised on the ""we need to fix this now else we'll have Katrinas every year"" war cry. Yet they were so absolutely completely wrong. Completely wrong. So we're supposed believe that everything's settled, that their models can forecast 50 years in the future, but they completely bumble something 5-10 years in the future like the Great Global Warming Pause and the Great Hurricane Pause."

climateskeptics,36fg55,HunterAP,8,Tue May 19 03:10:43 2015 UTC,"Which part was BS? The part where climate scientists colluded to remove opposing editors from journals?  The part where they were caught manipulating data?  Perhaps the part where they talked about ways around FOIA requests?  I don't know what part of that you thought was BS, but those things are pretty damning.  None of which has been disproven.  Hell, we have their email, and none of them have denied the validity of the emails.  I'd really like to know what about climate gate you think was BS.  I'll tell you what was BS...  The various excuses and misdirection that the alarmist blogosphere posted in response and the whitewash that followed.    Judith Curry, an author of some of the early papers used by the IPCC, got a look at climate gate, and joined the, 'luke-warmers,' realizing that the people she was associated with might have some skeletons in their closets.  She has since been on a crusade for openness/transparency in the climate science community.  Many of the, 'alarmists,' consider her an enemy.  God forbid the climate science community being open/forthcoming about anything."
climateskeptics,36fg55,Florinator,5,Tue May 19 06:01:29 2015 UTC,"Rather than relying on surface temperature to keep track of global warming, it is far more reliable to look at total ocean heat content or its twin, ocean sea level (which reflects ocean heat content plus land ice melt).   Bwahahaha... I LOL-ed.  Edit: emphasized the stuff I was laughing at."
climateskeptics,36fg55,HunterAP,5,Tue May 19 02:02:04 2015 UTC,"Actually, I agree with that assessment.  Sea level rise is the best mechanism for measuring climate change.  The problem for the other side of the aisle is that there has been no increase in the rate of sea level rise during the satellite record.  http://sealevel.colorado.edu/"
climateskeptics,36fg55,Feldheld,6,Tue May 19 02:20:10 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, measuring sea level rise is very hard. Water is rather liquid and constantly moving due to waves, currents, moon gravity, weather events, and not even the ground below holds perfectly still."
climateskeptics,36fg55,deck_hand,5,Tue May 19 03:19:15 2015 UTC,"Like /u/HunterAP, I tend to agree with this assessment.  Sea level seems to be the best ""global thermometer"" that we have.  It shows that ""warming"" started back many years ago and may have gone through some acceleration after the ""cool period"" of the 1950s, '60s and '70s. Well, to be honest, there was a HUGE change in rate the day the satellites went online, and AGW became the cause of the day.    I don't see any acceleration that wasn't coincidental in change in data collection methods."
climateskeptics,36fg55,PCCP82,-3,Tue May 19 14:14:29 2015 UTC,"Verdict  Mr Newman’s implication that discrepancies resulting from the recent climate fluctuation somehow invalidates climate models is incorrect.  Climate models have been thoroughly and critically tested against observations and are able to simulate with fair accuracy the component of climate change caused by human emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols as well as natural factors like solar variations and volcanic eruptions.  However, long-term climate simulations do not and likely never will reproduce the timing of shorter-term random fluctuations, like the recent slowdown in surface temperatures. In the long run, this fluctuation, like many before, will just be noise on a gradually increasing temperature signal.  That the discrepancy is a “well-kept secret” is demonstrably false given the large number of scientific papers discussing and trying to explain exactly this issue.  Review  This is a sound analysis that effectively explains the appropriate way to assess the reliability of models. Scientists can glean much scientific insight from comparing observations to model predictions, especially when there are discrepancies between the two. In contrast, the critique of models employed by Maurice Newman does not increase scientific understanding. – John Cook"

climateskeptics,36du1f,climate_control,10,Mon May 18 16:31:01 2015 UTC,Rare joint statement by world’s first and third biggest carbon emitters calls on developed countries to honour pledge of $100bn annual climate aid by 2020   Its totally not about the money though.
climateskeptics,36du1f,moirende,4,Mon May 18 16:31:27 2015 UTC,"Thing is, neither China (#1 emitter) or India (#3 emitter) is even close to being done industrializing or hooking their populations up to the grid.  And neither one of them has the slightest intention or forgoing any of that to make the Naomi Kleins of the world happy. Like, none of it.  The ""West"" decarbonizng is therefore effectively pointless. We're already doing that.  And China and India are happily picking up all the slack and then some.  So what needs to happen is to figure out a way to let those two (and eventually Africa, too) climb up the ladder too.  Yet the ""solutions"" I consistently see mooted basically give them a free pass.

My other issue, going off yours, why in hell are we using fire to take out cars?

climateskeptics,36b31b,climate_control,7,Sun May 17 22:47:57 2015 UTC,"Here's the original version of the article.  There have been several changes ...    There has always been an odd tenor to discussions among climate scientists, policy wonks, and politicians, a passive-aggressive quality, and I think it can be traced to the fact that everyone involved has to dance around the obvious truth, at risk of losing their status and influence.  The obvious truth about global warming is this: barring miracles, humanity is in for some awful shit.  Here is a plotting of dozens of climate modeling scenarios out to 2100, from the IPCC:  So what so what so what's the scenario?  The black line is carbon emissions to date. The red line is the status quo — a projection of where emissions will go if no new substantial policy is passed to restrain greenhouse gas emissions.  We recently passed 400 parts per million of CO2 in the atmosphere; the status quo will take us up to 1,000 ppm, raising global average temperature (from a pre-industrial baseline) between 3.2 and 5.4 degrees Celsius. That will mean, according to a 2012 World Bank report, ""extreme heat-waves, declining global food stocks, loss of ecosystems and biodiversity, and life-threatening sea level rise,"" the effects of which will be ""tilted against many of the world's poorest regions,"" stalling or reversing decades of development work. ""A 4°C warmer world can, and must be, avoided,"" said the World Bank president.  But that's where we're headed. It will take enormous effort just to avoid that fate. Holding temperature down under 2°C would require an utterly unprecedented level of global mobilization and coordination, sustained over decades. There's no sign of that happening, or reason to think it's plausible anytime soon. And so, awful shit it is.  Nobody wants to say that. Why not? It might seem obvious — no one wants to hear it! — but there's a bit more to it than that. We'll return to the question in a minute, but first let's look at how this unsatisfying debate plays out in public.  Are scientists keeping it real? The latest contretemps was sparked by a comment in Nature by Oliver Geden, an analyst at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. In it, he made a simple argument. Politicians, he says, want good news. They want to hear that it is still possible to hit the widely agreed-upon climate mitigation target of 2°C. Even more, they want to hear that they can do so while avoiding aggressive emission cuts in the near-term — say, until they're out of office.  Climate scientists, Geden says, feel pressure to provide the good news. They're worried that if they don't, if they come off as ""alarmist"" or hectoring, they will simply be ignored, boxed out of the debate. And so they construct models showing that it is possible to hit the 2°C target. The message is always, ""We're running out of time; we've only got five or 10 years to turn things around, but we can do it if we put our minds to it.""  That was the message in 1990, in 2000, in 2010. How can we still have five or 10 years left? The answer, Geden says, is that scientists are baking increasingly unrealistic assumptions into their models.  Can we really suck a bunch of carbon out of the atmosphere? Geden focuses on one such assumption: that substantial negative emissions will be possible in the latter half of the 21st century. We will be able to suck thousands of megatons of carbon out of the atmosphere, so humanity can go net negative by 2100, even if we emit a bunch more carbon in the short term.  The mechanism for negative emissions is supposed to be bioenergy — burning plant mass — coupled with carbon capture and sequestration. The combo is called BECCS, and in theory, it buries more CO2 than it emits.  If you work enough BECCS into your model, you can almost double humanity's ""carbon budget"" — the amount of carbon we can still pump in the atmosphere without passing 2°C. After all, if you can suck half the carbon out, you can afford to pump twice the carbon in.  But is large-scale BECCS plausible? There's the problem of finding a source of biomass that doesn't compete with food crops, the harvesting of which does not spur additional emissions, and which can be found in the enormous quantities required. The IPCC scenarios that come in below 2°C require BECCS to remove between 2 and 10 gigatons of CO2 a year from the atmosphere by 2050. By way of comparison, that's between 5 percent and 25 percent of total 2010 CO2 emissions. All the worlds oceans combined absorb about 9 gigatons a year; all the world's terrestrial carbon sinks combined absorb about 10 gigatons a year.  These scenarios means potentially doubling the capacity of terrestrial carbon sinks, capturing and burying — permanently, without leaks — thousands of gigatons of CO2 a year? How will it be monitored? What if it leaks or is breached?  There's no consensus on the viability of widespread BECCS, which, after all, doesn't exist yet. One 2014 commentary in the journal Nature Climate Change raised serious doubts about the feasibility of large-scale BECCS and the wisdom of betting the climate farm on it. They note that ""deployment of large-scale bioenergy faces biophysical, technical and social challenges, and CCS is yet to be implemented widely,"" and that ""widespread deployment [of BECCS] in climate stabilization scenarios might become a dangerous distraction.""  Tips and tricks for producing optimistic model conclusions But BECCS isn't the only way to make models produce happier results. The scenarios that show a high likelihood of avoiding 2°C also presume policy regimes that are positively utopian: a rising price on carbon, harmonized across every country in the world; the availability, maturation, and rapid deployment of every known low-carbon technology; all bets paying off, for 50 years straight. It would be quite a run of luck.  Is it possible in models? Yes. Is it possible IRL? Climate modeler Glen Peters doesn't think so:  There are other ways to massage the models as well. Peters draws attention to this chart, from the IPCC AR5 report:  Row four is the total carbon budget available to humanity this century, in gigatons. As you can see, if you move right or left on the chart, relatively small changes substantially alter the carbon budget. If you tweak the scenario from having a 66 percent chance of staying under 2°C to a 33 percent chance, the carbon budget goes from 1,000 gigatons to 1,500 — 50 percent more breathing room.  If you decide 2°C is too difficult, maybe 3°C is okay, your carbon budget goes from 1,000 gigatons to 2,400, more than doubling. That sure looks a lot easier. (Though, important note: even hitting that easier target would require substantial BECCS!)  Kevin Anderson, of the UK Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, is another frequent critic of these model assumptions. He says that models have often included unrealistically low estimates of current and future emissions growth, unrealistically early peaks in global emissions, and unequitable estimates of emission curves in developing countries (implicitly assuming stunted development).  Add to all these considerations the high rate of decline in emissions necessary after global emissions peak. It used to be that 2 percent annual global emission reductions was considered the maximum feasible (without serious economic contraction). Now models routinely show 4 or even 6 percent annual reductions, a rate of emissions decline that has never been achieved by anyone, anywhere, ever, much less consistently over 50 years.  Peters also shares this figure, from researcher Robbie Andrew:  In these scenarios, emissions never go net negative, though BECCS does get used. As you can see, for each year that emissions continue rising, the rate of decline afterward has to be steeper to stay within the budget.  Now policymakers are being told that emissions can peak in 2030 and still stay under 2°C. To get that result in a modeling scenario, emissions have to fall 6 percent a year for decades, even with large amounts of BECCS thrown in. To find that plausible, one has to imagine all of human society turning on a dime, beginning in 2030, deploying massive amounts of nuclear, bioenergy, wind, and solar, and doing so every year for decades.  It's ""possible,"" yes, but at a certain point that term loses much meaning. Something that would require human beings to quickly and fundamentally change their collective behavior may not violate the laws of physics, but it unlikely, given what we know about human beings, path dependence, and political dysfunction. That's why I once called it the ""brutal logic of climate change.""  Are scientists to blame? The question is, who is responsible for telling the truth about these scenarios? Is it scientists? Niklas Höhne, director of the New Climate Institute, offered a reasonable response to Geden:  ""The IPCC has never advocated for any target and has not commented on the feasibility, nor has the UNEP gap report [which shows the gap between current emission commitments and what's necessary for 2°C]. Both have shown the scenarios and the related assumptions, such as the need for net negative global emissions in some cases,"" he said.  ""Both reports do not make a judgement on the feasibility. They leave that to the policy makers.""  I think there's a good bit of truth in this. Scientific climate models are not meant to produce predictions or even plausible scenarios. Their only job is to show what assumptions and inputs yield what outputs. Change some of the assumptions but not others -- say, more wind, less nuclear -- and you can get a good comparative understanding of the two policies. But models are never meant to predict. Theoretically policymakers ought to know this. But political misuse of modeling is as old as modeling."
climateskeptics,36b31b,technologyisnatural,3,Mon May 18 05:23:44 2015 UTC,"The article is too long for one post ...    Nonetheless, the heated reactions elicited by Geden's piece do show that he's on to something. You can see some of those reactions on BuzzFeed, ClimateWire, and Responding to Climate Change (RTCC). A few are just crazy and knee-jerk, like Bill Hare of Climate Analytics, who ""lumped [Geden] in with climate skeptics and other naysayers 'who systematically downplay the risks of climate change and argue against action to reduce emissions on spurious and ill-founded grounds.'"" That is roughly the opposite of what Geden does.  Others respond by, in my view, missing the point. Stefan Rahmstorf and Michael Mann both insist that Geden is wrong, that 2°C is still physically possible.  I don't take that as the main thrust of Geden's argument, though. Lots of things are physically possible that nonetheless require heroic assumptions about collective human behavior (like, say, aggressive mitigation policy, in the face of powerful vested interests, harmonized across the globe, sustained for decades ... and also many gigatons worth of BECCS). The question is not whether such a scenario violates hard laws in the physical sciences, but whether it is reasonable to expect given what we know about human beings.  That's not really a scientific judgment, though, is it? Geden makes the same mistake when he writes, ""the climate policy mantra — that time is running out for 2°C but we can still make it if we act now — is a scientific nonsense."" No. It may be a nonsense, but it's not a scientific nonsense. No branch of science, certainly not climatology, can tell us what the humans of 2050 are capable of. We are all, on that score, making educated guesses, and a knowledge of history, politics, and economics will be just as important to that judgment as any knowledge of the physical sciences.  That, I think, is what Rahmstorf and Mann are really trying to say: it may be nonsense, but it's not our nonsense. It's somebody else's nonsense!  Who owns the nonsense? I imagine the scientists want to blame the policy advisors and the politicians — after all, they didn't hide the unrealistic assumptions, they are right there in Appendix MMCVIIc(9) for anyone interested.  And yes, theoretically, the policy advisers surrounding politicians should make clear to them exactly the assumptions required to produce the 2°C outcome. And politicians should be straight with their constituents about those assumptions.  However, as the kids say these days, politicians gonna politic. They all have enormous incentive to try to thread the needle, to accept the 2°C target on one hand while maintaining that current policy commitments are adequate, or might some day be adequate, on the other. To do that, they need evidence that success is still within reach.  There is not a politician on earth — no, not even Bernie Sanders — who wants to tell his or her constituents, ""we've probably already blown our chance to avoid substantial suffering, but if we work really hard and devote our lives to the cause, we can somewhat reduce the even worse suffering that awaits our grandchildren."" [crowd roars]  And Geden is right that scientists have very little incentive to tell the unpleasant truths either. They can stick to physical science and the ""possibility"" of 2°C for quite a bit longer, I would imagine. Geden fears that the next big thing, the next deus ex machina to save the 2°C target, is going to be solar radiation managements (aka geoengineering). If they're told to model it, what can scientists do? They'll model it.  The sad fact that no one has much incentive to break the bad news (except, ahem, my colleague Brad Plumer). Humans are subject to intense status-quo bias. Especially on the conservative end of the psychological spectrum — which is the direction all humans move when they feel frightened or under threat — there is a powerful craving for the message that things are, basically, okay, that the system is working like it's supposed to, that the current state of affairs is the best available, or close enough.  To be the insisting that, no, things are not okay, things are heading toward disaster, is uncomfortable in any social milieu — especially since, in most people's experience, those wailing about the end of the world are always wrong and frequently crazy.  Who wants to put on the posterboards, go out to the street corner, and rant? Yet here we are. The fact is, on our current trajectory, in the absence of substantial new climate policy, we are heading for up to 4°C and maybe higher by the end of the century. That will be, on any clear reading of the available evidence, catastrophic. We are headed for disaster — slowly, yes, but surely.  Even as many climate experts are now arguing that 2°C is an inadequate target, that it already represents unacceptable harms, we are facing a situation in which limiting temperature even to 3°C requires heroic policy and technology changes (or some very, very good news about climate sensitivity).  And yet ... the world doesn't appear to be ending; there's no big, visible threat. Climate change moves so slowly that its pace is evident primarily through graphs and statistics. It rarely rises above the background noise.  So people want to hear that there's hope of 2°C. Politicians want to say that there's hope of 2°C. When asked, modelers are still able to produce scenarios that show 2°C. And nobody wants to be the one to pee in the punch bowl."

climateskeptics,3692nk,IIRC,16,Sun May 17 10:39:05 2015 UTC,"It's not that Alarmists are bad at making predictions... ALL PEOPLE are bad at making predictions... Alarmists just don't believe that they are nad at it.  Honestly, this is one of the major factors that separates the left/progressive side of political spectrum (from which most Alarmists hail) from the right/conservative side:  Faith in experts.  The left are proponents of social engineering guided by social expertd, proponents economic management guided by economic experts, educational mamagement guided by educational experts, and environmental management by environmental experts.  In order to give those experts the power necessary to try to do their jobs, the left in turn favors centralized political structures.    I do not trust experts.... because I am one.  (I am a microbiologist with a Ph.D. specializing in Synthetic Biology, Bioinformatics, and Biosecurity).  Experts are specialized in EXPLAINING DATA.  Prediction, if it is being done in a scientific manner, is a data driven exercise. Sure, there might be a theoretical model guiding the prediction, but insofar as the prediction is actually scientific, the model is validated on data.    The reason this emphasis is important is that there are a whole boat-load of fields such as economics, ecology, climate, sociology, etc which are data-limited.  What I meen by ""data-limited"" is that the subject of the discipline changes faster than the collection of sufficiently granular data necessary to describe it.  For example, an accurate description of the climate at any given moment would include separate temperature, humidity, precipitation, cloud formation, aerosol, and paticulae readings for every unit of atmospheric volume, as well as temperature, salinity, sediment, pH, and oxygen content readings for every unit of ocean volume.  And for this to be useful, these volumetric slices of ocean and atmosphere need to be very small (ideally less than 1/2 of the size of the smallest relevant phenomenon... say 1/2 the size of a thunderstorm cloud for atmosphere).  Likewise, the time resolution should be fine enough to capture all the natural fluctuations.  That's a MASSIVE amount of data that must be gathered continuously.    Another aspect of data-limited fields is that they study exactly one instance of their phenomenon.  There is exactly one Earth Climate.  There is exactly one global economy.  There is exactly one Earth ecosystem.  This matters because science uses controlled experimentation to address the limits of real-world data when making models.  But, if you can't make a controlled experiment, because you can't, say, duplicate the entire planet.  The ability to rescue data-limited fields from the limits of data collection in real time is lost.  We might be able to capture all the employment statistics for the economy on a monthly basis, for example, but employment fluctuates on a daily basis.  Some of those monthly employment counts will represent where the economy was at the beginning of the month and some of them will represent it at the end of the month... so the monthly numbers don't even represent a snap-shot in time, but rather a weighted average over the month with the weighting chosen arbitrarily by when individual measurements can be taken rather than rationally pr evenly.  Without continuose and sufficiently granular data to inform models, predictions by experts in data limited fields where experimentation is not possible CAN NOT be trusted.  In practice this is all fields that are directly driven by public policy or that public policy responds to.  That is because public policy deals with the large interconnected real-world where things change rapidly and data collection is hard.  Thus, a distrust of experts in mattets of public policy is the only approach that makes sense.    Thank you for the Gold kind strangers of the internet!"

In the worst case humans will return all the CO2 back into the atmosphere that plants once took out of it. Back when all the now fossile carbon was still atmospheric CO2, has there been a ""runaway"" greenhouse effect? Obviously not.  No living thing can live without leaving a mark on its environment. All living things multiply until no more increase is possible. It is the most natural thing. Cutting our life line fossile fuel is as logical as comitting suicide out of fear of death."
climateskeptics,367xlf,Feldheld,8,Sun May 17 23:09:33 2015 UTC,"I won't get into the numbers or theories, but this is a story that finally persuaded me to call shenanigans:  http://www.livescience.com/378-key-argument-global-warming-critics-evaporates.html  Basically, there are three different measurement sources for temperature data: ground stations, weather balloons, and satellites.  Up until 2005, only ground stations indicated an unusual warming trend.  Neither weather balloons nor satellite measurements were able to confirm that data.  And then in August of 2005, the journal of Science published three separate studies, which simultaneously concluded that both weather balloons and satellites had been measuring temperature data wrong.  Forever.  In the same month.  This allowed ""scientists"" to go back and ""fix"" those temperature sets to match their theory about global warming.  Which is exactly what science is about: adjusting the data to fit your theory.  Particularly when you have to adjust two sets of data to match a third.  This left ground stations in control of temperature data.  And ground stations are susceptible to cherry picking, heat islands, and several other problematic influences, which is why they should be the least reliable of the three.  So, shenanigans."
climateskeptics,367xlf,JBlitzen,11,Sun May 17 01:50:38 2015 UTC,"Basically this subreddit (and many skeptics) exist because there is a world of difference between the alarmist tripe that gets peddled in the media and what the consensus science says.  We are certain of some things (CO2 is a greenhouse gas, we are emitting CO2), but very uncertain of other things. Like how much exactly the planet will warm due to the gases we are emitting. And how that warmth might change things.  My primary motivation is economic. People want to eliminate the best way to generate energy (fossil fuels) without thinking about how that might affect our civilization.  Also, the whole nuclear thing bugs me. If climate change really is the biggest threat facing humanity (as many have stated), then why not use the best way of economically eliminating CO2 emissions? Yet nuclear power plants continue to be closed. The only answer to this paradox is that people truly do not believe that climate change is the biggest threat facing humanity."

climateskeptics,367xlf,technologyisnatural,9,Sun May 17 05:00:39 2015 UTC,"so how is this a climate change skeptics subreddit and what is the point?   The direct effect of doubling atmospheric CO2, sans feedbacks, is an increase in temperature of about 1°C.  This is referred to as the Stefan-Boltzmann equilibrium.  Where the skepticism comes into play is when there are claims of very strong net positive feedbacks.  We just don't have a strong level of scientific understanding (LOSU) about feedbacks, so claims of strong certainty about net feedbacks are logically fallacious.   If you don't believe climate change is happening, what motivation do you have to deny the bulk of the scientific community?   I use peer-reviewed literature to support my case.  I encourage people to go right to the literature and examine it for themselves, including the statements of LOSU.   To those who do believe in climate change here, what's wrong with trying to fix it?   Have you noticed that those who scream loudest about climate change will only accept three policy axioms?   AGW is our biggest threat. The only way to stop it is with a tax. Only renewables shall be used for energy.   Disagree with any of those, and hell will rain down upon you.  Look at the recent case of Bjorn Lomborg, a climate believer, who dared disagree with at least one of those maxims.

We cannot control localized weather phenomena, tornadoes, hurricanes, droughts are all out of our control.  The closest we can get to controlling the weather is seeding clouds, and that technology has been around since the forties, and is not really controlling the weather, much less the climate, and yet some have the gall to insist that if we just start living in the stone age, and give a great deal of money to powerful governments, everything will be fine.  What seems like a daily occurrence now of a legitimate scientist coming forward to say that the most recent data published by NASA/NOAA/GISS does not match a personal archive they have of temperature data they have stored for a decade or so, and now the records that are published show the past being colder than it was, making the present ""the hottest ever"".  Those records of the past don't just change themselves.  Michael ""hockey stick"" Mann has been engaged in a defamation suit with a guy who claims he falsified data to get his graph.  Mann has used every legal trick in the book to drag the case out in hopes of making it too expensive to continue.  One of the recent developments was that legal briefs were requested for support of either side of the case.  Of the 97 percent of scientists who agree on consensus, thousands of scientists around the world, not one scientific body or scientist submitted a brief in support of Mann and his graph.  Not one.  I could go on."
climateskeptics,367xlf,NosuchRedditor,2,Mon May 18 16:19:00 2015 UTC,"A couple of points.  The economic costs of changing out our energy systems will be enormous in terms of living standards, quality of life, the ability to compete in the global economy.  Also, at the current level of development it is not practical to do so.  If climate change was as disasterous as is being predicted by some, then perhaps society would need to accept the massive changes needed to comply, but there are many reasons why the doomsday scenario is suspect.  Climate change is a tool used by those who use abstract intellectualism to envision a better world without consumerism, capitalism, with social justice and equality, not understanding or misunderstanding basic human motivations. Their motivation is far broader than the climate, but rather to change the basic economic and social structures to comform to their abstract world view vision.  Of course not everyone in the scientific community shares these concepts, but the leaders, the gatekeepers of science funding and data, frequently do.  The general public may articulate ths in a different way, but their common sense tells them that climate change is a deceitful science not to be trusted.  Most skeptics you will find are rational thinkers who wish to understand both the true risks of climate change and the true consequences, both advantages and disadvantages, in order to make an informed judgement of the trade offs.  But the narrative being generated by the gatekeepers is not one of balanced and objective analysis, rather it has been one of controlling the message, attempting (horribly I might add) to manipulate to opinions of the general public, with a good likelihood of distorting historical data bases that further public skepticism.  Basically they are engaging in the ends justify the means approaches and ppl can sense it.  Personally, i will accept as fact that increased co2 concentrations will increase temperatures by about 1/3rd of the modelled rates as this is real.  The net effect of positive and negative forcings is where manipulative science comes into play.  Anyone who has worked with modeling understands the very high degree of variability that can arise through lesser levels of bias in the multible input assumptions that must be used.  Human nature again comes into play.  The climate scientist whose model shows moderation is not a team player.  The scientist whose study shows that co2 say increases agricultural productivity and drought resistence is an outcast, not to be granted additional funding, or tenure, or promotions.  These factors boil down to a complete lack of trust or confidence to undertake a course of action that will be highly injurious to the economic welfare of society - and one that will harm the poor to a far greater extent than others as their energy costs represent a higher proportion of their incomes."

Q: Let me ask you specifically about last week's scare here in Washington, and what we might have learned from how prepared we are to deal with that (inaudible), at B'nai Brith.  A: Well, it points out the nature of the threat. It turned out to be a false threat under the circumstances. But as we've learned in the intelligence community, we had something called -- and we have James Woolsey here to perhaps even address this question about phantom moles. The mere fear that there is a mole within an agency can set off a chain reaction and a hunt for that particular mole which can paralyze the agency for weeks and months and years even, in a search. The same thing is true about just the false scare of a threat of using some kind of a chemical weapon or a biological one. There are some reports, for example, that some countries have been trying to construct something like an Ebola Virus, and that would be a very dangerous phenomenon, to say the least. Alvin Toeffler has written about this in terms of some scientists in their laboratories trying to devise certain types of pathogens that would be ethnic specific so that they could just eliminate certain ethnic groups and races; and others are designing some sort of engineering, some sort of insects that can destroy specific crops. Others are engaging even in an eco- type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves.

For example, triggering earthquakes or volcano eruptions at a distance by generating certain electromagnetic waves; deflecting wind currents; sending in a vector of genetically altered insects to devastate a selected crop; using lasers to cut a custom-tailored hole in the ozone layer over an adversary's land; and even modifying weather.

We don't ignore it, but it doesn't mean anything! Look, there was warming in the 90's. Then the warming stopped. So, of course every year since then will be hotter than the average record. How could it not be? If the temperatures went up and stayed there? That's like an obvious duh. I like to say this every time, the last 15 years of my life have been the tallest I've ever been.

Plants, like trees take in CO2 and give out oxygen. Also, from what I have learned since starting my own garden is that plants like way more co2 than we have currently. Which is why greenhouses tend to pump in high concentrations of CO2 in order to increase yield and bloom Not sure why I was taught that or why green houses implement that practice if plants don't need CO2"

What I have a problem with is this. Yes the models used by all the organizations can accurately match up with the climate in the past (which really isn't that difficult since we have records and can add or remove variables). But when they try to predict the future (any length in advance) the models crumble. They are more often then not, wrong in predicting what will happen by leaps and bounds - or have a large ""certainty"" region. When one goes out and point out that the models are wrong we get vilified as being, as you well put it ""member of an isolated band of heroic rebels"". No sir I am not some sort of heroic rebel, I'm simply pointing out that the models used by these organizations have been wrong time after time. That all these ridiculous claims made by experts are many times then not, nothing more than scare tactics. (for example, saying that millions of people will become ""climate refugees"" if action isn't taken now is a scare tactic anyway you look at it).   Secondly, and most notably, science has been and will forever be a land of skeptics. People will always question science - as they should as that's what science is - no matter how obvious the claim maybe. All the great minds of the past did nothing more then question the science of the day.  The moment one stops questioning science is the moment it stops being relevant. It stops being worth discussing and stops being worth even doing. There's not point in questioning science if everyone will just call you a denier or heretic.   I will forever question all science as that's what it there for. I will question all math - especially statistics as they can be manipulated in whichever way they person wants. You may call me what you wish, but being a skeptic does not make me a denier."

climateskeptics,360iuh,nimbuscile,1 point,Fri May 15 03:58:21 2015 UTC,"Just for the record - that's not true. Stating 'some level of confidence' is a bit general, but the IPCC First Assessment included confidence assessments with its statements. Of course, statistical assessment of uncertainty is a precise way of quantifying confidence that has been used since the early days. But it took me just a few minutes to find Svante Arrhenius' classic paper ""On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air upon the Temperature of the Ground"" (1896) [PDF], which, on page 2, includes explicit treatment of probable error.   As one may see from the probable errors I have place alongside the least concordant values and also for one value for where the probable error is extremely small, the differences are just of the magnitude one might expect in an exactly fitting formula."

This opinion is based upon nearly three decades of in-depth study into the matter of climate change over multiple time scales. What has become apparent, from an ever growing body of evidence, from many diverse sources, is that the climate of the past has constantly changed, with a range of variability far exceeding anything experienced within recent history, say for example, since the inception of the Industrial Revolution."

Variability has always been a key topic in climate research, and if this has become more extensive or visible in this recently, it is simply the result of improved science communication, more specific research questions and evolving capabilities within climate science. The evidence also suggests that even if “seepage” is real, at the very least this seepage has had no influence in watering-down UK public opinion and political action compared to other countries – and that possibly the opposite has occurred because the public are more convinced by seeing scientists being objective.

climateskeptics,35segu,logicalprogressive,2,Wed May 13 02:51:31 2015 UTC,"One of the things that is seldom talked about (and which Judith's article only touches on briefly) is that the newer, and often smaller, natural-gas-based generation facilities... can be more readily placed in a variety of distributed locations, i.e. nearer to the actual load (if not directly on-site); and of course they can be brought online (or taken offline) much quicker to meet the (generally predictable) demands.  That actually reduces the overall load on the system, as well as the losses due to transmission.  By contrast both the major ""renewable"" (hydroelectric) as well as the old coal-based power plants typically needed to be large facilities placed in some location that had nothing to do with demand, and more to do with supply, either in some remote damn (for hydro) or with access to high-volume transportation/delivery (for coal): i.e. along large lakes & rivers, or near major railways.  Natural gas doesn't have any of those limitations, and it can (and generally is) readily and inexpensively and reliably transported on an as needed basis and in sufficient volume directly to the load location: end result is that, rather than pay the ""peak"" electricity rates, high-volume electricity consumers (typically industry) now have the option of generating substantial amounts of their own electricity on-site (and normally for substantially less than the peak pricing of the grid).    There is even a valid argument that the utility industry has been taking a number of steps to PREVENT this type of ""distributed"" power generation.

climateskeptics,35rsev,Kelly_jernigan,2,Thu May 14 15:08:00 2015 UTC,"I didn't want to say this outright, because I needed time to think about it.   It is not scientifically valid to say ""smoking kills"" or even that ""smoking causes cancer"". Many scientific papers lead in with this statement, but it's an exaggeration. The problem in these statement is that a majority of smokers have a life-expectancy similar to that of non-smokers and a vast majority of smokers never acquire cancer of any kind that is attributable to smoking1. You find that shocking? Yes, well, the problem is: doctor's aren't good at statistics. More generously, they have a moral impetus to ""help us"" rather than get concerned with making accurate, scientific statements. Let me be clear: smoking is bad for us -- statistically speaking. But it is also bad for science for these scientists to inflate the numbers over make overreaching statements.  Says the UK-based anti-smoking page: ""in the UK about 8 in 10 non-smokers live past the age of 70 but only about half of long-term smokers live past 70."" Assuming they aren't inflating numbers here, that means only 3 in 10 smokers die before the age of 70 due to smoking. It means that five in ten do actually live past 70! That's a majority!   EDIT: Don't believe me. Read this paper  What resolves this disparity is the fact that the medical community has a different idea of the meaning of the word ""cause"" than the rest of us. To be logically and scientifically accurate, it's better to say ""smoking cigarettes dramatically increases the likelihood that a smoker (not necessarily you) will acquire lung cancer at some point during his or her life"". It's also accurate to say ""smoking cigarettes shortens life expectancy"".   I wonder if the medical community's loose understanding of the word cause has not, in fact, seeped it's way back into the hard sciences.   EDIT: So in a sense, Bill Nye is right, but only because the medical science is so bad."

climateskeptics,35pvjh,DVDAallday,3,Tue May 12 16:37:37 2015 UTC,Why is he using January through May to measure winter percipitation?
climateskeptics,35pvjh,umilmi81,5,Tue May 12 16:51:44 2015 UTC,"Because that was the time frame when the Northeast got tons of snow dumped on them. The alarmists' explanation is that GW creates more moisture, which leads to more snow (forget those times when they said kids just won't know what snow is). Obviously increased moisture was not the case, ergo, the hypothesis is false.  http://www.cnn.com/2015/02/10/us/northeast-snow/index.html"

climateskeptics,35qvwo,Florinator,2,Wed May 13 00:01:00 2015 UTC,"Genuinely curious here, how would the engine work? As I assume antimatter isn't combustible."
climateskeptics,35qvwo,Muffy1234,3,Wed May 13 00:23:35 2015 UTC,"The proposals I've seen for antimatter engines just allow the antimatter to annihilate regular matter, creating a very hot volume.  Think of it like fusion with much less fuel required.  In both cases, a propellant would still be required.  (The propellant would be superheated and pushed out for thrust.)"

climateskeptics,35qvwo,Muffy1234,2,Wed May 13 01:31:32 2015 UTC,"I dug up the paragraphs on antimatter rockets from Kaku's book. Here are some numbers (nerdgasm warning!!!)   Physicist Gerald Smith of Pennsylvania State University believes that in the short term as little as 4 milligrams of positrons would be sufficient to take an antimatter rocket to Mars in just several weeks. He notes that the energy packed into antimatter is about a billion times greater than the energy packed into ordinary rocket fuel.  When built, the Penning trap would weigh 220 lbs (much of it being liquid nitrogen and liquid helium) and would store about a trillion antiprotons in a magnetic field. [...] He states thath this Penning trap should be able to store antiprotons for about five days (until they are finally annihilated when mixed with ordinary atoms).  Antimatter is the most precious substance on Earth. A gram would cost about $62.5 trillion at today's prices."

climateskeptics,35qvwo,Muffy1234,2,Wed May 13 05:24:17 2015 UTC,"I think that one would allow fast propulsion, just not faster-than-light travel.  For the latter one needs a warp field."

And now that I think about it... well since this ""rogue antimatter"" has never been seen or recorded before... then, whether it's increasing or decreasing (whichever trend they decide it's doing) then the obvious conclusion will be that it MUST be due to modern American style industrial-capitalism, and we will need to regulate and reduce that (along with reducing the population/affluence of humans).  I mean that's the only logical explanation, right?"

(I'm a bot)     Although powerful storms have been known to produce positrons - the antimatter versions of electrons - the antimatter observed by Dwyer and his team cannot be explained by any known processes, they say.  Another possible explanation is that the positrons originated from cosmic rays, particles from outer space that collide with atoms in the upper atmosphere to produce short-lived showers of highly energetic particles, including γ-rays.  The team's data are a ""Cast-iron signature"" of positrons, says Jasper Kirkby, a particle physicist who heads an experiment investigating a possible link between cosmic rays and cloud formation at the CERN particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland.
