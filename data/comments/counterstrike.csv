counterstrike,3e0udr,R0xasmaker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:19:39 2015 UTC,Honestly the only way to really get better is to put the time in. You need to learn about spray control as well. Call of duty plays way differently as the amount of recoil and spray and miniscule in comparison to CSGO. As for cases you can get them in random drops after playing matches. Play enough and you will be rewarded in both skill and presents from lord gaben! :)
counterstrike,3e0udr,sucarah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:33:59 2015 UTC,Thanks! Also I noticed when I would shoot someone sometimes I would empty a whole clip in them and they wouldn't die.
counterstrike,3e0udr,sucarah,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:51:59 2015 UTC,Quite often if you empty an entire clip on one guy its likely you didn't hit them at all. Try small controlled bursts aimed at slightly above centre of mass.

counterstrike,3e0udr,yEzas,2,Tue Jul 21 03:02:06 2015 UTC,"Workshop > training_aim_csgo2  Good map to work on your reaction time and spray control.  Play lots and with other people, not bots.  Got a friend that's really good at CSGO?  Play competitive with them and 'practice' how to play a round.  If you know how to play as part of a team first, you can work up the wins while working on your individual skill.  On that note, in CSGO it's just as important to play passive as it is aggressive.    Some notable players who made great vids on YouTube to 'learn' the game from are AdreN and TheWarOwl... of course there are many others but these guys also really want to teach the game."
counterstrike,3e0udr,SoberPandaren,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:44:59 2015 UTC,"1. Play dm, casual, don't go competitive you will get low rank and will be hard to increase it.

counterstrike,3e0udr,YourBoySilver,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:41:47 2015 UTC,"The best way that I found, is to go find a clan server and play there with some regulars. You'll lose a lot, but when you go back to ranked or a pub server, you'll definitely notice that you've gotten better at the game.   My only complaint about the ranked system is that it's kind of bipolar, so you'll either play with people who are the 'same skill' or with people who are far above. It's a bit more manageable just playing with a regular clan though the browser."

counterstrike,3dx3ra,MightyFinePine,5,Mon Jul 20 06:47:18 2015 UTC,"Its really hard to get ranked silver for Smurfs, doing bad on purpose isn't so easy when the other team just walks into your crosshair and takes a second to realize they see an enemy. I am pretty sure gold nova has always had the most Smurfs. I smurfed a while back but I haven't played in a few months so I no longer have a rank on it or my main. I also only used it if I was impaired or too tired to focus well."
counterstrike,3dx3ra,Labeled90,4,Mon Jul 20 11:07:28 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but they have made it significantly harder to derank. Smurfs can no longer jump out of the windows on agency or over the railing on vertigo. They can't just rush mid every round and die. They have to play actual games and do damage to the enemy in order to downrank. So it takes a fair amount of time to lose rank now, meaning many will settle on Nova rather than downrank past it. So silvers are safer but 50% of Nova games may as well be mge."
counterstrike,3dx3ra,DannyBlindfire,4,Mon Jul 20 11:44:57 2015 UTC,"Happens even after you hit MG. Last night I solo queued and 4 team mates were de-ranking. Literally trapping me in a corner and we all die. They told me they were smurfs trying to de-rank =/  I just sat there, didn't talk or anything, I also reported all 4 for griefing since they were trapping me and not actually playing the game."
counterstrike,3dx3ra,Mad_Orbitz,2,Mon Jul 20 14:07:02 2015 UTC,I was MG2 last weekend.   played 5 games more . Each one with a super smurf on the other team.   And a toxic player on my team every single game. (trashtalking his team from round 1.)  I am now mg1 again.   I also sometimes play with my bro whoÂ´s legendary and his friends who are legendary too. When we play together the enemy roster is usually legendary or the rank under that.   Even at that rank. There is often a smurf on the other team.
counterstrike,3dx3ra,svenniola,3,Mon Jul 20 19:29:05 2015 UTC,Its where most smurfs (in my experience) get their first ranks. Guilty as charged I know this because I got it on my smurf. So did a few friends and when I was in that skill level (~GNM) thats the response I got from people who were smurfing.
counterstrike,3dx3ra,Cryonaught_,6,Mon Jul 20 06:57:39 2015 UTC,Because they get trashed on by hackers or they got boosted. So they make new accounts and beat up on newer players to sate their epeens.
counterstrike,3dx3ra,Camelope,3,Mon Jul 20 07:20:49 2015 UTC,I smurf to play with my mates around that rank as we can't 5 stack all the time. And until my smurf hit MG2 I mainly used smgs (-p90) and shotguns.  The few times I did pickup a rifle/awp was when I noticed an enemy smurf trash talking.  That's my reason/excuse.
counterstrike,3dx3ra,stinglock,2,Mon Jul 20 07:49:20 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're doing it right. No matter how seriously some people take it, it's still just a game and you should always be able to enjoy it with your friends."
counterstrike,3dx3ra,THE_CUTSMAN,4,Mon Jul 20 17:23:18 2015 UTC,"Bad excuse, shouldn't smurf, ruins the game."
counterstrike,3dx3ra,Crossbows,2,Mon Jul 20 13:49:05 2015 UTC,yeah the whole rank gap queuing thing was good so people couldn't get boosted but it really forces people to get alt accounts to play with low level friends.
counterstrike,3dx3ra,fiveifrenzy6,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:25:08 2015 UTC,"It does ruin the game but also not being able to play with lower ranked friends is annoying,  this is why there needs to be an unranked 5v5 matchmaking."
counterstrike,3dx3ra,Paperclip2022,0,Mon Jul 20 16:55:52 2015 UTC,there is. community competitive matches are not ranked or anything and are 5v5
counterstrike,3dx3ra,Crossbows,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:04:03 2015 UTC,Why would you P90 on a smurf....?
counterstrike,3dx3ra,schne867,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:02:03 2015 UTC,I said smgs (minus p90).
counterstrike,3dx3ra,stinglock,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:48:56 2015 UTC,"Well hey that makes a lot more sense, I think if I smurfed I would use the scout almost exclusively."
counterstrike,3dx3ra,schne867,0,Tue Jul 21 17:19:06 2015 UTC,"From my experience, its to be able to play with friends without your silver/nova friends being so far behind the curve they have no fun.  Source: I am one of those legit Novas that had a lot of really high ranked friends."
counterstrike,3dx3ra,Color_rad_oh,2,Mon Jul 20 17:17:17 2015 UTC,When you get to DMG+ you literally play a hacker(s) 4-5 games. I know this because I've been around LEM for a while and I play probably 5 matches a day.  I'm lucky if I get one match that seems legitimate.  Most people at this level talk about getting a new account so they don't have to play with cheaters because it gets really frustrating having to waste so much time playing matches that aren't the least bit competitive and basically meaningless. Smurfs and cheaters really suck but it is what it is. There isn't much we can do about it but continue to overwatch.
counterstrike,3dx3ra,fiveifrenzy6,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:23:31 2015 UTC,"I seriously doubt you encounter cheaters that often at DMG or LE, I've been there for a while and I've noticed the games are pretty consistent. I'd say my experience is the opposite of yours, I get 1 cheater every 5 games or so. Outside of that I think it's important to realize you might just actually be at your appropriate rank... I do not have a smurf and I play with gold nova friends all the time. The only reason I would consider using a smurf account would be to play with friends and not have them get wrecked all day."
counterstrike,3dx3ra,schne867,2,Mon Jul 20 17:00:46 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I usually play with a 5 que of similar or higher ranks (these are people I've been playing with for years and have done leagues with). I usually have people watching matches too who can observer the other team if things are suspicious and I can say for sure that wallhacks are extremely prevalent.   When a player has terrible cross hair placement, and movement but always lands their first shot on you when attacking no matter where you play its pretty obvious whats going on. The wallhacker trademark wide peek without cornering gives it away too. I've had to win so many games like a DM after coming across players like this because I know my aim, reaction time, and CH placement are better than a nova 4 with walls. If I'm able to run and gun D2 on CT side while the other team sprays like silvers at me and get a 3-4k every round but standing still watching an angle I get insta-killed, something isn't right.   The times we do actually que against legitimate players as a 5 man we win with a 5+ round lead. I've also had several people banned mid game which is always hilarious. But seriously hacking is ruining CSGO's competitive scene and there is no good alternative since ESEA is too sketchy, CEVO, and FaceIt still have a lot of hackers. Though I do like playing on those more. The servers are better but its more of a hassle to get everyone in the same server."
counterstrike,3dx3ra,fiveifrenzy6,-1,Mon Jul 20 17:19:24 2015 UTC,"I hear ya, IMO peekers advantage is still a big deal. I am terrible at holding angles, I feel like everyone past DMG knows the angles and prefires them. It is funny to watch some people not check corners and immediately one shot players holding positions though. I always ask myself ""why didn't he check any of the other corners?"" The servers themselves in comp seem fucked as of late too. Hackers have ruined Counterstrike as a whole since the start of the franchise and apparently it's a very hard thing to stop. Take into consideration that every other legitimate player has the same chance of playing against a cheater so your rank should still be a good determinant of where you stand against non-cheaters on the ladder. 5 mans have always had ups and downs for me but if everyone is DMG+ in your group I'd say just keep chugging away, the more cheaters you kill while they have the advantage of wallhacks the better you get."
