barricade,3a11uj,totally_professional,5,Tue Jun 16 15:19:30 2015 UTC,Another great chapter! The bombing seemed inevitable but it still came as a surprise! Very good!
barricade,3a11uj,Veshe,3,Tue Jun 16 13:08:12 2015 UTC,"I didn't think the bombing was inevitable. The story, up until now and also discovery of the lab notes, has been mostly centralized around Charlie and her fight for survival. It could have gone on for many more installments about Charlie and Jay's trials. This new turn seems, to me, to be bigger picture. Now the group has something other than self preservation and searching for Jay's sister, they have a few things to learn now. One is what is happening in the world around them and two is studying the zombies' behavior.   I do agree that this installment is very good."

I kept striking him as hard as I could, slamming the shovel into his head again and again.  Again.  Finally he collapsed before me.   I could see my arms were splattered red, even in the moonlight. My face felt wet.  Fighting back a wave of nausea, I turned and ran towards the fence. The second one was just about to drop down.  I reached him as he landed and started striking. My arms were shaky, but the height of adrenaline was coursing through my veins.  With the last of my strength burning, I only had to strike him a few times before he crumpled.  The third one stopping climbing once her final hunting companion fell. She stared at me through the fence for a long moment.  My legs were shaking so violently I nearly fell where I stood, but I held her gaze, staring directly into her dead eyes. She grunted, almost pitifully, then dropped back down the fence and ran without looking back.  I collapsed to the ground, pressing my bloodied palms into the gritty bitumen.   Too shaken to move, I threw up on the ground until all I could do was dry heave.  Sobbing, I pulled the shovel closer towards me, and watched the fence line.   **  **  **  Part 039  New IndieGogo page to support Barricade  More info about the IndieGogo page"

They once were persons too, with lives and families and friends... I sometimes dream about a post-apocalyptic world and that to me is the worst thing about it. You might have to kill people you love/loved, to save others or just yourself. And if you're not careful, you could be the one hurting others, by getting infected.

I'm so worried about Charlie now but at least she has a gun. Granted I'd never want to use it because the sound would bring more."
barricade,2olsqt,Lez_B_Proud,3,Mon Dec 8 09:00:03 2014 UTC,"My biggest fear with the gun would be the temptation to use it on myself, definitely, at this point. Aside from that. I'm totally with you on the sound factor."
barricade,2olsqt,Howardzend,4,Tue Dec 9 00:22:34 2014 UTC,"Definitely can see both your points here.   The interesting thing (to me) about both the weapons she has now is they're both dangerous for different reasons. The shovel, despite her attachment to it, is clumsy, arguably slow and messy to use. Fairly quiet, but also requires a bit of brute force. It's also tricky to carry around.  The gun... Well, as you guys said, the gun is potentially loud and could attract more of these things. After seeing what the elderly couple were driven through, I'm thinking the idea of suicide would definitely lurk somewhere in Charlie's mind..."
barricade,2olsqt,itwasmadeupmaybe,2,Tue Dec 9 11:36:55 2014 UTC,Oh definitely.  But I can't see her doing that and leaving the other two to wonder what happened.  I agree with you about the shovel too.  I'm glad it gives her comfort but I'd want a better blunt force object myself.  Something like the spiked aluminum bat from ZNation perhaps lol.
barricade,2olsqt,vr47,2,Tue Dec 9 19:49:13 2014 UTC,"I was thinking she should pick up a knife or a claw hammer, it would be really lucky for her if she found a battery operated nail gun because yah that shovel and gun though great weapons, both have large draw backs."
barricade,2olsqt,itwasmadeupmaybe,3,Wed Dec 10 17:47:02 2014 UTC,Bottle silencers.  I doubt she has that kinda knowledge.
barricade,2olsqt,vr47,2,Mon Dec 15 03:50:27 2014 UTC,"Yeah, but maybe she could run into someone who has that kind of know how?"
barricade,2olsqt,itwasmadeupmaybe,2,Mon Dec 15 16:40:16 2014 UTC,House should be full of supplies.  It was described as untouched.  Looked like they died at start of out break due to food left out.  No broken windows or doors I cant wait to see this play out.  Sadly im upset on the lack of her being able to smell the bodys.  Also no bugs?
barricade,2olsqt,vr47,1 point,Mon Dec 15 03:49:26 2014 UTC,"Well think about it, there are zombies every where right? Maybe the zombies smell like dead people and so she has just gotten use to that smell?"
barricade,2olsqt,InternetKillTV,1 point,Mon Dec 15 16:38:17 2014 UTC,I don't think these are undead type of zombie.  They bleed and breathe and eat so im convinced its a rage type.  If so I dont recall it being brought up. But a good point none the less.

barricade,2olsqt,itwasmadeupmaybe,5,Mon Dec 8 12:22:50 2014 UTC,"Now that's a real twist!  What have we seen with zombies? Inteliigent zombies that actually try to eat brains. Zombies that are undead but are mostly normal. ""Rabies"" zombies . Bioweapon zombies with varying degress of being tamed.        But zombies that act like animals? Like actual packs of wolves? That's something else."

barricade,2o4gdw,0neir0naut,9,Wed Dec 3 05:30:04 2014 UTC,"The emphasis on sensing the zombies rather than shoving them in our faces is fantastic and works wonders. They always say a monster is scary right up until you see them, I don't know who ""they"" are but they're certainly right here! You've managed to create an astounding amount of dread for me as a reader up to now with very few actual encounters and it's great. Writing as Charlie alone is also clearly giving you the ability to explore seemingly less significant aspects of the world around her, but that attention to detail from the character really helps you understand the gravity of the situation. How detrimental one wrong move can be. Constantly on guard.  Heh, funny, first piece of writing I've ever really analysed or reviewed of my own free will. You really have something special going here!"

barricade,2mxtnp,goofynarwhal,3,Fri Nov 21 11:27:54 2014 UTC,"Another great installment. Thank you, you are really talented and I am excited everytime I see a new part of this story :D"
barricade,2mxtnp,InternetKillTV,2,Fri Nov 21 17:19:25 2014 UTC,Put off reading this one so that I wouldn't have to wait so long for the next but I caved and now I'm just itching for more!!
barricade,2m93qv,WindrunnerSpire,13,Fri Nov 14 03:58:36 2014 UTC,"I've been waiting for this. I knew you would split them up eventually, but i thought it would be Jay to go out on his own. This will create a lot of writing options for you.  Are you going to keep everything from Charlies perspective or are you going to let us know what Jay and Annie are doing while Charlie is off on her own?  As always great work and keep writing these. It's like a drug for me, i can't get enough."
barricade,2m93qv,XGinga,21,Fri Nov 14 04:31:54 2014 UTC,"Each time I have them make a decision, I try and think about what the most realistic option would be. To me it felt more ""real"" to have Charlie take the risk, and let the siblings stay together. I can't see her forcing them apart to avoid risk.  I also like the idea of having a strong female character who isn't ""over the top"" - she's strong, but she's still a normal person who fears and worries.  Your question... I don't know. At the risk of sounding dramatic, I don't even know if she will see them again. I like to think she will but I can't say that's definitely where it's going at this point, and it's all still quite ""by the seat of my pants"".   Thank-you for your kind comments! :D"

barricade,2m93qv,1337_Degrees_Kelvin,4,Fri Nov 14 06:46:15 2014 UTC,I'm really enjoying the story so far. I like how each part reveals a little something else about each character. Keep up the good work! :D

barricade,2l7upe,Jarvicious,22,Tue Nov 4 01:38:47 2014 UTC,"That's a good question! Unfortunately the answer is, I don't know. :(  I'll keep writing them until I feel the story reaches a natural finish... I don't want to force it to drag on until it becomes tired and ridiculous, if you know what I mean. And I'll keep posting them here while people are enjoying them.  I think I've mentioned a couple of times, when I wrote that first part of this story, I never expected it to go anywhere, so there has never been a grand plan of what's going to happen. It's been a bit of a ""fly by the seat of my pants"" kind of adventure, which has been pretty enjoyable for me (although sometimes  stressful!). A couple of times I wrote chapters and felt really happy with them, submitted them, and then went ""Oh. Damn. How do I get them out of that/fix that/where do I go from here?"" So that part has been quite interesting!  edit: I do have a couple of ideas of things that will happen now, but whether they'll actually make it into the story or not is still unsure. It's important to me that it doesn't become wildly unrealistic and that the characters don't make frustratingly poor choices. I hope I've stuck to that fairly well so far, so some ideas might not make it in if I can't make them ""realistically"" work... if that makes sense. :) Also, thanks for your comment! :D"
barricade,2l7upe,Firefly_07,6,Tue Nov 4 01:50:22 2014 UTC,"I've read every part with enjoyment. I really like the seat of your pants approach; and knowing that you are writing like that makes it more exciting because it's not just me that doesn't know what is going to happen next. I feel very immersed in the whole story. You are a great writer. I'm no critic by any means but just like everyone else (I think), I read something or watch a movie and think that things could have been a little different here or there. I don't do that when reading your work. There is a certain completeness to each part, yet I'm still on the edge of my seat at the end wondering what they will do next. Please keep writing for me and everyone else who reads your stories."
barricade,2l7upe,Firefly_07,4,Tue Nov 4 02:21:38 2014 UTC,"Thanks, that means a LOT because this is exactly what I've been going for! Although it also adds a bit of pressure because I don't want to mess it up when we've come so far. :)"

barricade,2l7upe,Remember2Remember,3,Tue Nov 4 14:56:24 2014 UTC,"Oh good, because I do this at work sometimes too (not about barricade!), it's really nice to know I'm not the only one who everyone is confused by and/or thinks is crazy. :)"
barricade,2l7upe,Epsilon109,6,Tue Nov 4 22:36:57 2014 UTC,"Right now, the way you've set it up, it really is very depressing. I get the feeling that if I was these guys, I would give up and walk out to meet the zombies bare handed, despite my naive belief that I would survive. No. The way you've written it, its real. I can't see myself surviving, and Charlie and all them seem to have very little chance. These guys though, they keep fighting, and I want them to survive so bad. That's the talent of a true writer right there. Please, keep going, make them survive!"
barricade,2l7upe,InternetKillTV,-2,Tue Nov 4 05:30:42 2014 UTC,I think it's actually a little over-harsh... I'm getting a little sick of Charlie's melodrama.

They meant a lot to me when I read them. :)  Thanks for your comment too, /u/TheFutureFrontier. I was sorry to read that you're finding Charlie melodramatic but I'm hoping to convey the sheer exhaustion, desperation and absolute lows they would be feeling after what they've been through. Something for me to keep in mind in future. :)"
barricade,2l7upe,sporksmaster,3,Tue Nov 4 22:36:13 2014 UTC,They're teenagers. i think it's a little expected that there will be angst all over the place. I just want to see where this guy's going to take them. Will there be more angst? Will there be some actiony angst? Or will angst be thrown back into the corner and replaced with life in a zombie-infested world?

barricade,2ixv37,ThisDragonCantDance,10,Sat Oct 11 13:08:04 2014 UTC,"SPOILERS FOR TWD TELLTALE GAMES:  I think he is referencing The Walking Dead game.  It is kind of a choose your own path game and you play in episodes.  It will make you care about the characters like you wouldn't believe.  Anyhow, in the last episode of Season 2 the main character Clementine (a girl about 10-12yrs old) and one of the members left from her group Kenny find a town called Terminus.  They are out of food and winter has arrived.  After deliberation, the town says they will take child (Clem) but Kenny will have to move on.  At this point you (as Clem) have to make a decision to leave with Kenny (whom you have known since the first season) or stay in the town, leaving Kenny on his own.  In my game I stayed with Kenny.    Edit*BTW please keep writing these, I'm sure I speak for everyone when I say that we all appreciate you taking the time to write the words and share them with us.  It is a REALLY awesome game, I enjoy its episodes more than the actual t.v. series."

I guess Kenny would make the ultimate zombie, or zombie fighter. If you did include Kenny, as the three ran away and Kenny is kicking zombie ass and looks to be taking mortal damage, he can come back the next day or later in the night and be like ""it was nothing"".

barricade,2ici7p,Applekami,3,Sun Oct 5 19:42:41 2014 UTC,I think it's the first time it was mentioned.   I always thought she was Jays kid from a former relationship.
barricade,2ici7p,neunen,6,Sun Oct 5 19:49:28 2014 UTC,I kinda assumed she was just a kid they found on the street...

barricade,2hlvrv,shadowatmidnight104,9,Sat Sep 27 18:32:29 2014 UTC,"Very nice. I like your snapshot-storytelling style. Tying it into a higher narrative, like in Barricade, is a proper skillful thing to be able to do, I reckon."
barricade,2hlvrv,llBoonell,3,Sat Sep 27 10:59:56 2014 UTC,"Thank-you! :)   I hadn't really considered I'd done a similar thing with them both - the start of this one was written in February, and Barricade of course was all accidental/unplanned!"
barricade,2hlvrv,Hi5GhostFaceKilla,4,Sat Sep 27 11:05:14 2014 UTC,"Note: I should probably mention I removed a few names (places, characters) because I kind of got stuck with Barricade and using a name I wouldn't have used if I'd known their story was going to continue.  So if there's any slightly awkward sentencing, hopefully it's just the places where I've edited out the place/person name for now. :)"

barricade,2hlvrv,ReplicantLP,5,Sat Sep 27 19:09:58 2014 UTC,"Your style and ability to enthrall readers is uncanny. I'm having a hard time deciding if I want to keep reading Barricade, or this story even after such a small glimpse into its world. You are very talented, please keep writing and do not get discouraged. If you ever want to self publish I'm sure with 1500+ redditors here, we could crowd fund a small run of several hundred copies :D"
barricade,2hlvrv,ThisDragonCantDance,3,Mon Sep 29 17:25:20 2014 UTC,"I feel I have to say that you are incredibly skilled in starting a story in the middle of a scene and just drawing the reader in, making them want to read more, understand more, and immerse themselves in the world they've just gotten a glimpse into."

Glad you posted it, truth be told I had forgotten about this story, checked this sub for any new barricade instalment (I actually read 14 this morning, 8am bst), but one can hope! I was pleasantly surprised to see this posted! :)"
barricade,2heauw,WindrunnerSpire,21,Thu Sep 25 03:16:59 2014 UTC,"I love the approach you're taking. Its not all horror and scary and action. Like, that stuff is necessary to keep it moving, but the amount of it you've used is perfect. This seems much more... Real. Not like a movie script. I love it."
barricade,2heauw,shadowatmidnight104,19,Thu Sep 25 05:51:28 2014 UTC,"Thank-you, that really means a lot, because the pacing has been really important to me. I appreciate knowing someone thinks I have it right! :)"

barricade,2heauw,ReplicantLP,16,Thu Sep 25 08:08:21 2014 UTC,"I never expected my original comment in /r/AskReddit to go anywhere, so I had absolutely zero plan. I thought I'd post it, nobody would even see it, and that would be the end. Even after I'd posted the third one, I didn't expect anyone to remain interested.  I'm kind of seeing where the story goes along with you guys, and it's pretty neat. I've had a couple of ideas that I'd like to put in, but didn't really get the chance to sit down and do a big plan.  With the book I had been trying to write, I had pictures, research, all kinds of notes. Barricade has definitely been a different experience but really enjoyable. :)"

You're doing such a fantastic job!  What's the genre of the book you're trying to write? I'd be interested in reading it!"
barricade,2heauw,ReplicantLP,8,Thu Sep 25 10:11:31 2014 UTC,"I would call it adventure/fantasy - it takes place in a completely made up world and is the story of the female main character's quest to save her father. (That kind of makes it sound ridiculous /blush).  I'm thinking about posting some of it, but I'm just working up the nerve first. It's something I was working hard on and so if everyone hates it, it will be hard to take. I'm a wimp. :)"

barricade,2fsv4a,brakzorak86,2,Mon Sep 8 21:07:58 2014 UTC,"OP, great work. I've  been reading since a few minutes after you posted 001 in the thread you started in. Not that I want you to give away details, but have you thought about the future of the story or are you just writing it as it comes to you? If you've thought about it, how far ahead have you planned? Hours? Days? Given the pace of your story so far- which, by the way, I've got nothing against- it seems like it would be a loooooong time until there is any kind of reasonable resolution to the story. Just wondering if you've got plans for that kinda thing..."

Don't feel bad if you can't get one daily which I was amazed at the fact you already have five up so far. I enjoy reading them and even if you put one up per week that would be cool.

More than one a day is hard for readers to drop in on and can seriously drain you. I found that one a day at most proved to give me time to think and to get my ideas in line, as well as giving my readers some time to discuss what had happened. I wish you the absolute best of luck!  Then again, you could just be the ultimate writer and be able to write non-stop and never run out of material so if that's the case, keep it up!  Edit: Just finished reading the current ones that are out. Nice hooks through and through, starts in the middle of the action (I love that style so much), gives light backstory in the lulls of action. Keep it up. You have my attention.

barricade,2f8u29,Frozenhorizon,1 point,Tue Sep 2 16:06:09 2014 UTC,"Definitely some of the best writing I've seen this side of the internet. Keep it up. :D  By the way, should you happen to want to publish this as a book, I'll try to buy a copy."

barricade,2f8u29,Crackbat,1 point,Tue Sep 2 20:21:47 2014 UTC,You are incredibly talented! Thank you for sharing and please keep going :)
barricade,2f8u29,Crackbat,1 point,Tue Sep 2 22:54:54 2014 UTC,"Welp, you have another fan! Please continue, I love zombie stories and your writing style is fantastic!  Although, could you include a bit more details as to what the characters look like? It would make the characters more real, give them more of a presence. Perhaps a short background. Doesn't have to be their life story, just a few tidbits. :D  I look forward to your next installment. ^_^"

barricade,2f8u29,Makkel,1 point,Wed Sep 3 03:24:22 2014 UTC,"This is more enthralling than anything I have read in the past 3 years. Are you a writer, or just REALLY in to zombies?  *PS; Never stop writing."
barricade,2f8u29,BRBaraka,1 point,Wed Sep 3 05:18:11 2014 UTC,"I'm not a professional writer. When I was a kid I would write stories about anything I could think of, for hours on end.   Barricade is the second piece of writing I've worked on in at least the last decade, if not longer. The other is something I started this year and only work on intermittently. With that one, I go through long periods of hating everything I've written and spend a long time considering how I can rewrite it all."
