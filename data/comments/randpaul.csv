randpaul,3e3cml,jayeskay,4,Tue Jul 21 17:17:31 2015 UTC,"He's still doing better on real issues than any other republican candidate, and I would certainly prefer him to be there than to go home. He's about the only voice of reason in politics besides his father."
randpaul,3e3cml,AtlasLied,3,Tue Jul 21 18:44:19 2015 UTC,"I definitely think so, too. He's the only candidate in the Republican primary who actually wants to change the way we approach issues and shrink the federal government. His approach isn't purely libertarian, but it's the closest any Republican candidate has ever been (with the exception of his father, of course)."
randpaul,3e3cml,AtlasLied,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:30:50 2015 UTC,Yeah but rand understands that in order to win he needs to appeal to a wider audience. This means I don't necessarily agree with his budget proposal when it comes to defence spending but I can swallow it given his stance.
randpaul,3dznj5,AndrewCherry17,6,Mon Jul 20 20:47:22 2015 UTC,"Chris Christie is at the absolute bottom of the Republican trash heap as far as I'm concerned. In addition to being an all-round bully, this is a guy who used Hurricane Sandy relief aid to blackmail local politicians into doing favors for his big business developer buddies, shut down traffic to penalize hundreds of thousands of motorists for one mayor not supporting him, evaded paying income taxes on his NJ governor's stipend, and basically trampled all over New Hampshire's ""Live Free or Die"" motto when he went there and said ""you can't enjoy your civil liberties if you're in a coffin."" He's known for conducting meetings and communications without any record to avoid anyone pinning anything on him.  He used to be hailed as some sort of ""moderate"", but when you look into it all that means is that he has absolutely no principals and will make deals with anybody so long as it benefits him."
randpaul,3dznj5,zugi,4,Tue Jul 21 01:51:38 2015 UTC,Anyone know these cases Christie keeps referring to using the Patriot act?
randpaul,3dznj5,RPDBF,2,Tue Jul 21 02:36:03 2015 UTC,"No. And Christie cleverly says he ""has gone to foreign intelligence courts to get the type of monitoring that we need."" FISA is a notoriously secret court, so there's likely no way anyone can learn about the cases or even confirm that what he's saying is true."
randpaul,3dy4ji,DEYoungRepublicans,4,Mon Jul 20 14:13:43 2015 UTC,"I can't find anywhere on his website where he's going to be speaking, I would have gone if I knew he was in Texas!"

randpaul,3dt1c9,2012ronpaul2012,6,Sun Jul 19 04:24:20 2015 UTC,I am on the national finance committee (glorified title).  I helped organize a couple Rand Paul rally's and fundraisers in Denver that Rand attended.
randpaul,3dt1c9,jjgames,5,Sun Jul 19 23:32:21 2015 UTC,That's awesome!  I went to his rally at Choppers three weeks ago and really enjoyed his speech on the Bill of Rights.  Do you know who his Colorado liasons are that introduced him?  I was just recommending to the moderators we beef of this fan page with campaign contacts to help get people connected.
randpaul,3dt1c9,jjgames,2,Sun Jul 19 23:42:02 2015 UTC,Owen Hill (he was out of town so his aide did introduction) - a Colorado State Senator from Colo. Springs.  Scott Renfroe - Colorado State Senator.    Ted Harvey - Colorado Representative from Douglas County.

randpaul,3dt1c9,RustDeathTaxes,6,Sun Jul 19 13:17:12 2015 UTC,"Don't get too frustrated.  It is very early and no campaigns are organizing in later states.  Colorado is Feb or March caucus and campaign is just now looking for space, finding endorsements, getting organization started, etc.    Focus will be on doing really well and being really well organized in IA and NH and NV."
randpaul,3dt1c9,jjgames,2,Sun Jul 19 23:36:26 2015 UTC,Hard not too because you have all this passion for him as a candidate but its like your passion falls on deaf ears with the source. I've donated nearly $200 already (which for my wife and I is a lot).
randpaul,3dt1c9,Dpelosi5,3,Mon Jul 20 00:26:18 2015 UTC,I know what you mean.  I told them I was willing to help about 10 months ago and only recently has anything happened.
randpaul,3dt1c9,RustDeathTaxes,4,Mon Jul 20 20:49:53 2015 UTC,I'm also from NJ and have signed up numerous times. I think I might just make my own flyers and assemble a small team to hang them out on my own.

It just so happens that currently there are ""Muslim terrorists"", as well as other terrorists who don't make spotlight.

randpaul,3dnbws,DEYoungRepublicans,6,Fri Jul 17 17:47:24 2015 UTC,Hmm I thought Sanders had more individual donors than Paul. Something like 300M to 114M people. This makes it look like Paul had much more individual donors than Sanders.
randpaul,3dnbws,JBeezy,2,Fri Jul 17 19:30:30 2015 UTC,"Yea, that is clearly visible. You can see that Rand has donors from large metropolitan areas like NY, LA, Florida, and Texas, like Sanders, but also has support from Appalachia and the midwest."
randpaul,3dnbws,dlrepublic,2,Fri Jul 17 20:03:39 2015 UTC,"Neither of them have a donor count in the millions. The U.S. Population is less than 370 million.  Sanders has about 200,000 donors and Rand has something like 108,000."
randpaul,3dnbws,Pure_Politics,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:14:51 2015 UTC,yes. typo. the point is still the same. Sanders has a large grassroots movement than Paul.
randpaul,3dnbws,JBeezy,0,Sat Jul 18 05:01:54 2015 UTC,"That's arguable, really. Sanders might have more people showing up to his events and donating, but these are not the only indicators of how large someone's following is.  There are a number of variables of which I could elaborate on, but no one here wants to read a 500 word essay."
randpaul,3dnbws,Pure_Politics,3,Mon Jul 20 18:30:33 2015 UTC,This is very cool for a brushstroke idea. Are the other candidates available? I'm curious if others have this type support outside the small areas we assume their money is coming from.

randpaul,3dioah,Tenal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:12:17 2015 UTC,"They harm the campaign by not using his art, logos, and official campaign statements and positions.  Voters need consistency and this takes that away.  On top of all of that, flyers do not secure votes. Door knocking, phone calls, TV ads, radio ads, and internet ads sure do though.  Direct mailing to voters takes a minimum of 7 ""touches"" to have a chance of securing an undecided voter. The design consistency needs to be maintained for maximum effect.  Imagine if Coke had dozens of different logos, slogans, messages, etc. That would confuse consumers and send them to competitors."

randpaul,3deol9,Ailbe,10,Wed Jul 15 18:06:57 2015 UTC,"Because the mass media has to do its part to silence any message even slightly off message from the ""two"" major parties.  I say that in quotes because I'm quite convinced we only have 1 party with two factions now.  Both factions are big government, corporate money riddled and corrupt.  The only real difference is what kind of big government they vote for.    The media did their best to silence the Ron Paul campaign and apparently they feel the need to silence the Rand Paul campaign as well.  And America will let them because the next episode of ""Fuck You Reality Sucks"" is coming on."

randpaul,3de3f0,Selongb,8,Wed Jul 15 15:34:42 2015 UTC,"I'm not really worried about that. Once the debates start happening and we are getting more than just 30 second soundbites out of the candidates people will open their wallets.     Also, money just means they can buy things.  Seeing Hillary and Bernie on the tv/radio/ads etc more than anyone else isn't going to change my mind.  If anything, it should motivate people to discuss with their friends and neighbors more."
randpaul,3de3f0,krykel2,3,Wed Jul 15 20:38:30 2015 UTC,"But it's really effective in convincing the minds of people who may not be as informed. If they're viewing one positive Rand ad while 5 more are attacking him, that'll inevitably influence a lot of people."

randpaul,3dcmq2,JakeF12345,3,Wed Jul 15 05:45:46 2015 UTC,"There's another article describing his position on the Iran deal here.  TL;DR:   “The proposed agreement with Iran is unacceptable and I will vote against the agreement,” Paul tweeted Tuesday afternoon. “The deal is bad because 1) sanctions relief precedes evidence of compliance 2) Iran is left with significant nuclear capacity. It also lifts the ban on selling advanced weapons to Iran.”  “I sincerely want negotiations to continue, but I want to get a good deal,” he asserted. As opposed to a bad deal with Iran, Paul said that instead of declaring war and tightening sanctions on the ayatollah regime, the United States should keep negotiating beyond the deadline, based on the interim agreement.   Considering he does not wish to declare war, it isn't too far from his dad. While at the same time this position realizes that giving out nuclear power to enemy states is a bad idea..."
randpaul,3dcmq2,DEYoungRepublicans,5,Wed Jul 15 14:16:55 2015 UTC,"It's kinda weird how his father put up a video today supporting the deal and that the neocons would complain how Iran can trade weapons in a couple of days. It's either Paul trying to play the game here and do exactly what his father said -- which was disregard the amount of years before they can even trade these weapons, or that he's really turning into a neocon.   I'm kinda disappointed at Rand if it's the second choice.  Source: http://youtu.be/SWAKUCKDjso"

randpaul,3dcmq2,pmcfarl,2,Wed Jul 15 11:19:53 2015 UTC,"Ron Paul supporters (of which I consider myself one) don't seem to be very politically astute. Ron Paul ran a campaign where he would rather be right than win.  Rand Paul is trying to actually win. If you were a Ron Paul supporter and you are not supporting Rand Paul, you have lost the plot.  Rand Paul is playing this perfectly. He's playing the game. Rand wins nothing but alienation from the base by supporting this. And for what? This thing is as good as a done deal. This 60 days is nothing but a dog and pony show. Rand wins nothing by supporting it. Instead, by coming out against it, he gives cover to the conservatives who don't like the deal, and becomes a lead Republican opinion on what is wrong with the deal. If Rand Paul doesn't like it, it's worth noting why he doesn't like it. Every leftist newsie with a camera will want to ask him about his position. And the ones on the right will roll him out like royalty and talk about what a smart guy he is. And It turns out that his points are pretty salient: 1) sanctions relief precedes evidence of compliance 2) Iran is left with significant nuclear capacity 3) it lifts the ban on selling advanced weapons to Iran Rand Paul's opposition to this makes him look like a reasoned statesman caught in between the ravenous Lindsey Grahams of the world, and the ever persistent perception of a capitulating Obama among conservative voters. People don't really understand how brilliant Rand Paul has run his campaign so far. Especially the old Ron Paul folks who would rather be right than win the presidency. That time has passed. Now is the time for playing the game, and Rand has the best show on the road in that regard. Rand Paul isn't in this game to merely spread the libertarian message the way his father was. He's in it to win. Whether he will or not remains to be seen, but that is clearly the goal, and he's pretty well positioned right now, all things told. Over the next 60 days, this deal is going to be hammered. Rand Paul would gain absolutely nothing either pre-presidency or post-presidency, by supporting this deal. He gains plenty, and actually has a chance to considerably elevate his profile by coming out against it."

randpaul,3d9d9b,BioDigitalMachine,6,Tue Jul 14 16:58:19 2015 UTC,We need to be flooding /r/politics with content like this to counteract the flood of Bernie Sanders in there.

Reddit isn't going to sway the election.  Talk to people on Facebook and in your communities, engage in healthy debates with family and friends, and wait for the primaries to start playing zealot.  Did you support Ron Paul, donate to his campaign, do groundwork for his campaign, and watch him get blacked-out by media while states' primaries were rigged in Romney's favor?    All I'm saying is- make sure you're not pissing in the wind in supporting Rand.  Last bit is that everyone on Reddit is entitled to their own opinion.  /r/politics is noisy enough as it is; no use flooding it with more noise- you'll invite downvotes and be less likely to have your message heard.  As I'm writing this, there are ~20 confirmed contenders for POTUS in the 2016 election.  Sanders has big hurdles to jump before he can get the Democratic nomination- he openly admits that.    If you want to meaningfully educate people about the 2016 election, don't focus all your energy on /r/politics."

randpaul,3d7qx3,Nostraadms,5,Tue Jul 14 08:15:07 2015 UTC,Not disagreeing but Ron Paul's AMAs went well. Though obviously Rand isn't Ron on a lot of issues.
randpaul,3d7qx3,ball_gag3,5,Tue Jul 14 13:33:10 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Of course, there are tons of people on reddit that do not agree with his platforms but he is capturing many independents as well. This wouldn't be the first time a Republican candidate did an AMA. Gary Johnson also did an AMA and it seemed like it was accepted well. I think it would only help his cause as many of the people who will be voting for him would be mellinials and younger."
randpaul,3d7qx3,MorningLtMtn,7,Tue Jul 14 13:35:27 2015 UTC,"Not sure he'd be smart to do an AMA in a place as economically illiterate as Reddit.  The people here were just cheering Bernie Sanders on his congratulating Greece on their ""No"" vote.  Notice that none of them, including the media, are saying a word about how stupid that was - especially now in retrospect."
randpaul,3d7qx3,jjgames,3,Tue Jul 14 14:50:50 2015 UTC,"There isn't much upside to doing one now during Republican primaries.  Reddit isn't a hot bed of Republican votes.  If Rand nomination I think an AMA makes a lot more sense because of the independent, younger voters on Reddit."
randpaul,3d7qx3,Glennus626,5,Tue Jul 14 14:38:01 2015 UTC,"I think Rand's strength is that he appeals to more than just Republican voters. The guy is for liberty, far more than the majority of ""liberal"" candidates.   Hillary has basically said she will attack Iran, if president. She supported Doma when her husband signed it into law, now she's finally for gay marriage (good for her, too little too late), most likely selling influence to foreign buyers while SoS, in bed with plenty of big business, etc.  Sanders is all for change until it comes down to voting for an audit the fed bill. Suddenly he doesn't care that megabanks control the country."
randpaul,3d7qx3,jjgames,2,Tue Jul 14 15:54:26 2015 UTC,"I completely agree, it is a major strength of his.  BUT most primaries only allow Republicans to vote.

randpaul,3d7wpv,IMULTRAHARDCORE,3,Tue Jul 14 05:28:13 2015 UTC,If he reacts strong on immigration here then it would look like he agrees with Trump. There will be a time when Rand is strong on immigration but now is definitely not the time!

Heck, I'm sure there is a good chunk of the 3K subs here that are just here to see what 'the crazy paul-bots are saying'.

Those who are taxed then have less money, because it was taken away. This is called subtraction. Yes, I am being condescending."

randpaul,3claa7,damnit_darrell,3,Wed Jul 8 22:03:19 2015 UTC,"Long shot absolutely but it requires a different approach.    Rand doesn't believe the government should be involved in marriage at all right? So with that, there wouldn't be the discrimination and so it'd be a moot point.   On abortion, yeah he's prolife but that's not something he's come out strong on so I'm not sure he'd go out of his way to restrict abortion rights.   And rascist? Well that's easily proven false based on his legislative work over the last year."

The economy thrived and the divers population was able to live in close proximity without violence.   In Iraq under the baathists, Christians, Sunnis and Shiites lived together in the most liberal country in the Mideast. Women had more opportunities than in any other country in the mideast.  I am sorry if that doesn't fit the Fox News narrative, but those are the facts."

randpaul,3cfau9,Gregorofthehillpeopl,2,Wed Jul 8 17:08:43 2015 UTC,"Look into the Sykes Picot Accord, one of the more damaging stupid ideas to come out of the destructive WWI. Upon the demise of the Ottoman Empire, the French and British decided to divide the spoils of war and cut the mideast into two pieces: one that the French would administer and the other for the British. Syria was the greater part of the French portion of the spoils of war. Like the British part, the boundaries of these new polities took into no consideration the ethnicities, language groups and religious boundaries that had existed for centuries. That is where the problem of Syria and Iraq began.  Given the seething caldron of tribes, religions, etc. neither the British nor the French were able to maintain control of their ""Mandates"".  The Baathist Party, controlled by the Assads, led Syria from the time of its independence from France in 1946. The country that the Baathists took control of was ethnically, religiously and linguistically divers. Many of the tribes and ethnicities were perennial enemies. The only way to maintain peace and order and assure that the majority Sunnis didn't kill all the other tribes was through rigid order, imposed with brute force. With time the people accepted the Baathist rule more or less willingly because it assured security. The Christians, Druse, Alawites and Shiites understood that the Baathists made it possible for them to live in a country whose majority was Sunni.   So, now I will answer your question. Given that the ethnicities in Syria no longer have physical boundaries that would allow each of them to have their own polity, the best alternative for Syria and Syrians was Bashar al Assad. But now, Syria is coming apart and there is no way to put it back together again. Even so, the Assad regime is basically the only hope for Syrian Christians, Druse, Alawites and Shiites. Assad will be overrun and the Sunnis will kill the other ethnicities or force them to emigrate, losing everything that they had ever worked for."

randpaul,3cbemn,jaberwocky69,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:26:37 2015 UTC,"""Abolishing the IRS"" is a talking point. As long as we have a tax system of any kind there has to be a central way to collecting and processing the taxes. The system can be cleaned up and chunks of it could be gotten rid of over time, but there will always be an IRS (even if it changes names)."
randpaul,3cbemn,iwascompromised,-4,Tue Jul 7 01:50:08 2015 UTC,"Whom it benefits and disadvantages is the question. Depending on the perspective the advantages and benefits are great if you want to reduce the government's ability to be efficient and effective as a government should be. However, if you want to actually have a government that is effective then I'd say you disadvantages are disastrous. If Rand wants to abolish the IRS, in my opinion, he is saying he wants to reduce revenues and rewrite the tax code to benefit big business and shrink the government to the size of a bathtub so it can be drowned. Basically an attempt to greatly reduce social services and safety nets.  Edit: Sentence structure"
randpaul,3cbemn,craptain_kirk,3,Mon Jul 6 20:48:05 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, i think it's more for simplifying the tax code and reducing lobbying in Congress to get benefits from tax loophokes. In turn more money in the pockets of the people and more time"

randpaul,3cbemn,iwascompromised,3,Tue Jul 7 01:48:33 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. To fully understand what Paul is wanting in regards to taxation, you should probably read the relevant portions of his recent book where he discusses in some detail his flat tax ideas, both on individuals and corporations, and his ""Economic Freedom Zones.""    As to actually abolishing the IRS, this is my interpretation (not from his book): yes, there will still be some federal agency with primary responsibility to collect federal taxes, both individual and corporate. Just because of the sheer size of the tax base (the number of individuals and companies paying taxes), regardless of how complicated or how simple U.S. tax law may be, this agency will have to be big, bureaucratic (not any negative connotation of the word), and will still have a great amount of power, including a criminal enforcement and a collections branch. With all that said, it does not necessarily have to be the IRS per se… there are many congressional Republicans, not without some justification, ahem, that don't trust the current IRS nor that agency's leadership. Could the IRS still exist but just collect and enforce under completely different tax laws and codes? Absolutely. Could the IRS be abolished and replaced by a completely different and new agency? It would take done doing, but the answer is the same. Absolutely."

So I don't know when exactly NC will hold its primary, but it appears it will either be in February or March. And interestingly enough, at least on the (R) side, by holding the primary so early the party will be forced to allocate delegates on a proportional basis rather than winner takes all. Interesting.

I don't see how the information in part 1 means that Hilary's statement in part 2 is a lie.

Suddam Hussein also worked for the CIA as an assassin before they put him into power, before the Iraq War which resulted in millions of deaths.  This is why Rand Paul is so good, he understands this agenda and that the government helped create ISIS as well.

You know... the way the system is supposed to work! And also... say ""legalize it"". The young kids will get a thrill up their leg like chris matthewes."

Another member of the island is sick.  Since that sick person has a ""right"" to healthcare, then the person with medical knowledge is forced to treat the sick one?  That is slavery, and Rand's argument makes perfect logical sense.  He is also a doctor himself.  Edit: Rand Paul also does loads of charity work giving free eye surgeries to the poor all over the place, and even in foreign countries.  This is how our system is supposed to work, with charity and free markets, not with scam single payer care.  You sanders supporters think MORE government involvement is going to reduce your prices?

He is talking about the right to service. Rand says that being treated by a physician is a service. Saying that you have the right to someone else's service is non-sensical. In a free society, service is not a right. In a free society, service is a contract. You pay for a service and that person gives you a product.   In a totalitarian state, which the socialists want, healthcare service is a right, so a physician is not allowed to refuse to give his service to a patient - that is slavery because it is against the physician's FREE WILL.

He said that the idea that you have a right to someone else's services means that you are entitling yourself to someone else's labor. Currently, that's all fine and dandy, but in the event of a shortage of laborers, what are you going to do? Well it's your right, right? So you have to force someone to do it, or else it's not a right. Therefore, the idea that you have a right to healthcare is silly.  Sanders and all of his supporters reporting on this know exactly what he meant by that. Even though I dislike Sanders, I don't believe he's fucking stupid. So, they couldn't come up with a proper retort to this, and instead said, ""YOU THINK DOCTORS ARE SLAVES, ARE YOU CRAZY???!!!"" And now they've ""won"" the argument."

randpaul,3bj0tb,Gorgonaut666,4,Mon Jun 29 19:04:29 2015 UTC,"Check out this video on rent control.  The arguments for rent control often come along the lines that people have a right to affordable housing. The problem is that by controlling what landlords can charge for housing, we destroy the incentive to build more, or even to maintain what housing units are there.   In places where rent is kept below the market value, more people use that rent. However, since there is no incentive to increase the supply of housing, you end up with shortages. Sharing is all well and good, but sharing nothing doesn't get you ahead."

And now you want me to pay for someone else's medical bills also just because I worked hard to get where I am?

You - and I - pay more in taxes because the infrastructure that exists to provide a high school and college education to people is designed to be ultimately reinvested in by those who are successful beyond the average because none of us live in a vacuum - you can only thrive in a system if the system exists. You could work hard to get where you are only because 'where you are' is a position made possible by a functioning society and economy that rewards hard work.    Collective democratic decision-making is how a society functions in a non-hierarchical political system, and a voice equal to the other members of your society to contribute to that decision-making is the most freedom you can get, in terms of self-determination, without infringing on the freedoms of others - you know, libertarianism?"

You know what that means? The right to be left alone, to do what you want, who you talk to, fuck and un-fuck, and gasp who you treat as a private practicing physician.   If you're in a hospital, that's a whole different story. But if you have your own practice, it is against someone's freedom to be forced to provide a service.

At the end of the day I don't agree with either 100%, but I would vote for these two well before I'd vote in any corporate candidate. Anti establishment above all,  how the politician plans to work is a secondary concern for me. Socialism and free markets can solve problems,  it just depends more on what problems are being solved.  For instance I may not feel a free market solution to health care is correct,  but I would take a free market solution over doing nothing like we did for the entire 20th century. ..whereas socialism may not be the right way to deal with college tuition,  but I would support a socialist solution over doing nothing. Make sense? I support both guys because at the end of the day they seem to truly be fighting for normal every day Americans.

How much are you paying for your internet? If you're in the US, probably a shit-ton for shit service. The UK has strict regulations on monopolies to enforce competition and low prices, this works wonders for the people because a few big companies can't run rampant and extort the population. The free market doesn't work, for ordinary people. Corporation's motives are always profit first, everything else second. If they can charge a million for a cancer cure and still get business, they'd do it, even if it only costs them $10 to make. The idea that free markets correct themselves is also ludicrous. There's a concept in economics called information failure or assymetric information, slightly related to Huxley's brave new world. Most people will not care enough, or will not be told that they're being extorted, resulting in market failure and extraordinary wealth gaps between rich and poor that were seeing today.  That's a big difference between Sanders and Paul. Sanders doesn't support a free market, Paul does. Sanders is anti-establishment, Paul is not, he's accepted a ton of money from AIPAC."

randpaul,3bj0tb,tacosforbreakfastt,6,Mon Jun 29 19:59:20 2015 UTC,"Clean drinking water is vital to life, and much more so than access to healthcare as you will die much faster from dehydration than from cancer. So, as of right now we have decreed that access to drinking water is a right. Now, we are going to say you can only charge so much per liter of water. On the surface this looks like a fantastic idea, we outlaw price gouging and ensure everyone has access to cheap clean drinking water. Except it doesn't do any of that; this actually does the opposite. If Pepsi and Coke can no longer sell bottled water at dollar a pop because of the regulations ensuring they don't gouge the price, than they won't make a profit. If they don't make a profit, they won't ramp up production, distribution and marketing for said bottle of water. Let's propose for a moment that a town in Nevada gets all of it's drinking water from bottled water companies, being in the desert and all. Coke and Pepsi have zero incentive to transport bottled water at a loss to that town. Because fresh water is a right, they must be forced to do so, or the cost must be subsidized.  Let's examine the free market scenario. That desert town in Nevada still gets all of it's drinking water from bottled water companies. One bottled water plant has a snag and shuts down production, increasing the cost of all other bottles of water. No regulation is imposed that would limit the cost of bottles of water, so the remaining bottles of water increase in price. In the desert town, prices for bottled water (already above normal due to the reliance of the town on that resource) increase higher. The result of higher prices encourages more companies to ship bottles of water to that town, as they will receive a higher profit than for delivering elsewhere. Even if those big bottled water companies don't take advantage of that, private business or individuals can also take advantage, buying bottled water in bulk and reselling it in the town. The increased competition helps to offset the increase in price, as the various vendors and persons are all trying to get higher prices than elsewhere, but lower prices than their competitors.    Making access to healthcare a right does far more harm than good because it tries to replace the market incentives with governmental force. Not only is it unethical, it is counter productive."

randpaul,3bjywr,CallTur,8,Mon Jun 29 21:01:06 2015 UTC,"I always like to hear what Paul says himself directly rather than the summaries of things. That link has a 1 hour video, so forgive me for not sifting through it to find where he talks about climate change (if you find it please let me know where in the video it starts.) But even the excerpts mentioned in the article (as opposed to the click-baity title) seem pretty reasonable to me:   Paul made clear that he is against pollution and thinks the country should take measures to cut back, but he doesn't back ""alarmist"" claims that the earth is headed toward a downward spiral due to increasing temperatures. Still, Paul went on to blast the growing amount of ""onerous regulations"" on emissions.   It sounds like he's not denying the science of increased CO2 in the atmosphere (absolutely conclusive) or of man-made influence on increased temperatures (pretty conclusive), but he questions the economic magnitude of its effects and the necessity of various big government regulatory schemes for reducing it.  As of a few years ago even the most ardent scientists were saying ""you can't invoke global warming to explain any one storm or event"", but these days most people seemed to have dropped that caveat and bring it up every time there's a hurricane, tornado, regional drought, etc. Paul also calls folks out for that.  Also thank you very much for the article, because now I have a conclusive response to those who claim Paul is a young-earth creationist:   ""The earth is 4.5 billion years old, and so, you are going to say we had four hurricanes and so that proves a theory? No."""
randpaul,3bjywr,zugi,-1,Mon Jun 29 21:23:44 2015 UTC,"Its not conclusive at all.  Global warming is a fraud. Do you realize how many factors come into play when it comes to global warming?  The climate is always changing, nobody is denying that.  The factors contributing to climate and temperature are so deep that any scientist that claims there is conclusive evidence of global warming is a fraud.  There is no possible way scientists can measure all of the millions of factors that go into global temperatures.  The sun, moon, and solar system are even at play, not just Earth oceans and atmosphere.  There is a biological aspect to is as well.  Plants and animals have a symbiotic relationship and we live in a very complicated biosphere.   I can sympathize becasue I used to be somewhat brainwashed on the issue as well.  You have to realize there are a lot of special interests that benefit from the global warming narrative.  Energy companies are often pushing the narrative like GE.  You have to ask yoruself why?  Its because they want energy artificially scarce so they can charge more.  Also they want regulations that make it hard for any competitors to compete in the energy market, while they gain monopolies/oligopolies.  A lot of the reason for the wars in Iraq and other places are because special interests like oil companies pushed for it.  They didnt like that Saddam Hussein was pumping too much oil and reducing the market prices.  They wanted to control the oil to create artificial scarcity so they can charge more."

randpaul,3bjywr,tacosforbreakfastt,-2,Tue Jun 30 04:53:53 2015 UTC,"Ohh since government organizations can never be infiltrated, corrupted, or encouraged to publish certain viewpoints.  From your link:   Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals1 show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing climate scientists agree: Climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities. In addition, most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position. The following is a partial list of these organizations, along with links to their published statements and a selection of related resources.   So read their wording ""very likely due to human activities"", so they are admitting themselves its inconclusive.  Also just because energy companies and other special interests and universities with vetted professors can publish 97% propaganda in the ""peer reviewed scientific journals"" means nothing when looking at reality.  They are obviously spinning the narrative when those 97% were not even fully sure, they were only ""very sure"".  Again another quote from your link illustrates the same point:   There will always be uncertainty in understanding a system as complex as the world’s climate   Then it goes on to list the many organizations spouting the same narrative.  Organizations that are easily influenced by money or corporations and monopolies.  Also they are pressured by the infiltration of our culture to go along with the global warming narrative because if they don't, liberals will call them ""deniers"".  Even when they admit themself its inconclusive.  Lets give up our way of life and ban CO2 because of inconclusive evidence of a problem that actually helps humanity and boosts the economy."

randpaul,3bjywr,ImInterested,2,Tue Jun 30 21:11:10 2015 UTC,There's a big difference between the truth and what the public wants to hear.
randpaul,3bjywr,aew360,3,Mon Jun 29 23:09:51 2015 UTC,"Not disagreeing but I just wanted to point out a few things. The increase in CO2 levels over time is irrefutably documented here and other places. I happen to know this because 20 years ago, before the phrase ""climate change"" was even a thing, when the military (Air Force and the Missile Defense Agency) needed to predict atmospheric chemistry levels properly for various internal modeling and simulation purposes, they used a model of increasing CO2 based on the year and date of the simulation. They had no dog in the climate change fight, they just wanted to get the right answers.  Now CO2 itself is a harmless gas - we all breath it out and plants breath it in. Obama's EPA labeling it as a ""pollutant"" several years back so they could regulate it is a complete power grab, like calling oxygen or nitrogen a ""pollutant.""  The effects of CO2 on temperature are indeed based very complicated, so researchers write computer models that try to account for all the things you described (the sun, moon, oceanic and atmospheric currents, algae growth, forestation and deforestation, etc.) The big question is whether there's any way to validate that these models are correct. If not, it seems that whoever's model produces the scariest answers gets the most funding from this administration. That certainly doesn't set up incentives for scientific honesty and fairness."

randpaul,3bjywr,brianpv,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:24:34 2015 UTC,"They ""try"" to account for those things, but I think it is ridiculous to think that they can actually do it. Every time one thing changes it changes a multitude of other things in feedback loops or chain reactions.  For example the CO2 increases temps, then it increases cloud cover which increases the albeto effect.  Then what does that do to algae plooms, or arctic ice? That is just one example. Volcanic activity also plays a huge role in CO2 production. We live in a dynamic ever-changing system and to think they can predict the future of climate change just seems crazy to me.  I am not denying that burning fossil fuels increases CO2. But the CO2 also fuels more rapid vegetative growth. The millions of factors and chain reactions cannot be simulated in their computer models with today's technology or probably even with some alien technology. Also I have seen a lot of evidence of very flawed science being used to justify global warming, promoted by energy companies that benefit from the narrative.  One thing is for sure, the energy monopolies like GE benefit the most from the global warming narrative.  While Obama bankrupts coal for them with all of the regulations.    Sure CO2 can cause warming, but our planet has natural ways to balance itself.  That CO2 was not always locked up in fossil fuels.  We are not going to have a runaway greenhouse effect like on Venus.  If we do have some mild warming it is a good thing for humanity and the economy.  It wasn't until the last ice age subsided into a warming trend that humans entered into the next level of civilization. To change our entire way of life, and limit CO2 emissions is not the answer. Its not near conclusive that there is even a problem needing answered in the first place.  If there is then the free market is the answer, and human ingenuity is the answer.  Limiting creativity and ingeneuity by overregulating the market is just going to stagnate things and make it worse."

Probably there are scenarios where a few people benefitted under Obamacare in the short term.  But a lot more people are getting hurt.  Also in the long term everyone is going to hurt bad especially our children as this system comes in. They are even talking about death panels as a serious thing.  I would hate to see your family member denied care because we need to hire more teachers instead.  The cost of care is skyrocketing under the insurance individual mandate.  You probably are still paying huge fees for deductibles and copays and whatever else.  The care is also dropping and many doctors are even quitting or retiring early because of obamacare regulations.  In the past care was affordable.  The poor got taken care of. Doctor's were basically required to give about 10% of their work for free to charity and they did.  Rand Paul is a doctor himself and he recently flew to Guatamala to give free eye surgeries to people.  He did it again recently in the states.  We the people can be the safety net for each other, rather than relying on the government to be our safety net, because governments can be bought off and corruption can set in."

That's not a reasonable suggestion in their situation.  I admit that from the looks of it the ACA isn't addressing the rising costs of healthcare. But people were getting DENIED because of preexisting conditions, and thats NOT right.  FWIW, Paul has said he wants to remove the ""bad"" parts of obamacare, so I'd like to think clause about denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions would remain."
randpaul,3bjxrm,RandPauI2016,2,Tue Jun 30 12:26:23 2015 UTC,"Look when you force insurance companies to insure someone with preexisting conditions it messes up the market, which causes a lot more people to hurt.  That is what is not right.  Insurance companies will be forced to charge everyone more.  Also the medical industry will start charging more too because of the insurance influence on the market, so costs rise for everyone. Now people are FORCED to by health insurance.  The insurance companies wrote the ACA so they can screw you.  Once you are forced to buy their product they can charge whatever they want.  If you have a condition that needs medical care, why should your care be free? You pay it out of your pocket, and its done.  If you can't because you are poor then look to some charity to help you.  If we had freedom we wouldn't have so much poverty and people relying on insurance.  That is right, if you can't afford your healthcare then you are poor, lets stop pretending.  Insurance companies insure people based on risk.  People should be able to get away with not even having insurance, because costs should be much much lower.  If we had a free market then costs would be super low, and wages would be super high, and we wouldn't have such bad issues in our society.  The reason you can't afford your medical care is because the economy has been gutted and restricted, so we are not as prosperous as we once were.  I don't know Paul's particular plan.  I know he believes in free markets, because everyone knows from history and countless studies that free market capitalism is what results in the best quality of life for the most amount of people."
randpaul,3bjxrm,sgiacomin,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:33:44 2015 UTC,"Let's say that even if someone with a pre-existing coverage could afford a plan, there is still a chance that an insurance company could deny them coverage because of it.   I'm for basically for the smallest government possible so there's no need to bring up points about free market.   It's not a good idea though to deny coverage or charge outrageous premiums.  The idea that someone shouldn't be denied health care simply b/c they've had cancer before, or that they might have a mental illness is very American IMO.  ""The Bill of Rights isn't for the high-school quarterback..."""
randpaul,3bjxrm,RandPauI2016,2,Tue Jun 30 21:45:59 2015 UTC,"You are missing the forest through the trees.  Why do they need a plan?  Why don't they just pay the cost out of pocket?  Why does everybody need a plan?  Do millionaires or billionaires need a health insurance plan? Why?  They can afford healthcare service on their own without isnurance.  Insurance is there for people who choose to buy it.  If they can't afford health care without insurance its because they are poor, which is caused by too big government wrecking our economy.  I am sure if they want to pay enough then someone will adjust the risk and get them their beloved insurance, they will just pay more.  Lets put charities in charge of the safety net instead of governments.  Private charities can help people a lot more.  In the past doctors gave 10% of their work for free to the poor, it was part of their hippocratic oath.  But now that is changing because of government involvement.  Rand Paul recently flew to Guatamala to give free eye surgeries to remove cataracts for the poor there.  That is how things should work.  But since everyone thinks its governments job to serve the poor, charities aren't allowed to thrive as much as they could.  Also there is a tax burden on everyone meaning they can't have as much money to donate to charities."

They couldn't get it no matter what.   I get your point about if the government got out of the way then services might actually be affordable enough to pay out of pocket.   However, we can't expect people to put aside their personal needs to vote based on what is ""right."" Especially when it comes to health matters which could mean life or death.   Healthcare is a business not a charity. Not to say that charities don't have their place., but innovation in healthcare treatments come from companies which need to make a profit.   Its this innovative treatment that people want access to. But when the free market has not allowed that to happen then government is needed.   All congress had to do was pass a simple law saying ""No person can be denied health insurance."" I don't know why they had to create the entire ACA."

You have not closed a social gap, you have shrunk the middle class and grown the poor. The economy will adjust to the new standards because they will have to if they are paying their employees double what they are. An inflated economy will cancel the higher minimum wage.  And free/public college education? Oh my. Well first off, colleges are already over populated, and that is with tuition rates. So now you will flood the system. It will become hyper competitive, and you can expect waiting lists years long before you can start to enroll. Oh, and who is going to pay the professors? I'm pretty sure if I went and got my PhD to teach at a university I want to get paid. So when you tell me my new salary is 1/20th what it used to be, I am going to quit. So we have waiting lists, over population, and staff that is probably sub par as well as way understaffed. On top of all of that, you have now devalued a bachelors degree. If everyone has it, it's pretty much worthless. 20 years ago a bachelors was worth a lot more than it is now. A Masters degree would become the new bachelors in terms of value, and a PhD would carry the same value of a Masters. Companies will adjust to those standard now. And lets not forget that in today's society a company might open up one position that 100 qualified people apply for. Well guess what, now 1000 people apply for it. Except it won't be an adjusted entry level now, it will be less than that. You have essentially turned you undergraduate degree into the equivalents of a high school diploma. So when you finally finish school and come out with a masters...you won't get paid like it, but more like having your bachelors. Except that's really not that much more than a high school education at this point. Assuming you can even get a job as the job market will be so flooded with applicants.

randpaul,3bgodj,AkivaAvraham,2,Mon Jun 29 01:45:42 2015 UTC,I used to agree with this.  But what about divorce?  Marriage in the eyes of the government is the right for two people to conjoin assets and then use the courts to disentangle those assets.  Are we better without this right?  But I do think its arbitrary to limit the number of people to only two.  Its a funny thing to try and make entirely fair and reasonable.
randpaul,3bgodj,AmericanAristotle,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:30:34 2015 UTC,Interesting point. I think some might say that you should create this contract before hand.

randpaul,3bgodj,joosegoose25,-5,Mon Jun 29 04:36:48 2015 UTC,"A bit disappointing, especially his assertion that the founders of this country derived their wisdom from a religious upbringing, what with the majority of them being Deists and not Theists. I wish that people of Rand's generation could fully comprehend that their interpretation of marriage is simply theirs and not everyone's and that marriage is not a religious institution. I can go to the court house as an atheist and get married without any reference to God or any religious figure or belief. Weddings are religious ceremonies, marriages are not."
randpaul,3bgodj,SkyJW,3,Mon Jun 29 03:32:02 2015 UTC,"Weddings are religious ceremonies, marriages are not.   And if the government were completely removed from the equation, this would remain true. If Rand and people of his generation don't personally recognize yours or my nonreligious marriage as a ""true"" marriage, then who gives a shit? You wouldn't have to do the same for them and their marriages either. Legally all that would matter is your right to contract, which he stands for."
randpaul,3bgodj,joosegoose25,0,Mon Jun 29 04:13:23 2015 UTC,"My point concerning the marriages has nothing to do with whether or not they approve of a nonreligious marriage, it's the fact that he and other Republican candidates are interpreting the Supreme Court's decision as a reinterpretation of what a marriage is when their definition of marriage is derived from their belief that marriages are religious institutions when we as society have already legally recognized that religion is an optional association to be had alongside marriage, not the root of marriages themselves. And when marriages have already been legally granted the ability to be performed in a non-religious fashion, it means that any religious justification for why homosexuals cannot be married is null and void.   If you want to be against gay weddings you can be since those are religious functions and some churches may not be willing to perform a wedding or any other religious event for a homosexual couple when they view the union between a man and another man or a woman and another woman to be void under the jurisdiction of religious doctrine. But to assert that recognizing gay marriages now means that government can creep into people's churches is a non-sequitur: if a gay couple wants to get married at a church, they can go to a gay friendly church, if they don't then they have the option to be married in a secular fashion at a courthouse since churches and other religious institutions do not have a monopoly on the marriage trade.   I have no issue with his belief in contracts between consenting individuals, but the arguments concerning a perceived perversion of the definition of what marriages are or that this opens its doors to the harassment of the religious is illogical. And I should specify that I am a supporter of his, I just think he's being a bit caught in two places as a presidential candidate with a libertarian bent."

Even though I am personally religious and don't like the idea of gay marriages for religious reasons, politically I agree with you. I think only actual sound argument that can be made here is that government should be removed from the equation because it should have never been involved in the first place, not that it needs to be removed because it's trying to redefine what a religious sacrament is."

It is what people have been taught.

randpaul,3bexh9,beatmastermatt,9,Mon Jun 29 01:38:55 2015 UTC,"Look where the New Deal has gotten us. It didn't pull us out of the Great Depression; world war 2 did. And, consider social security too. It's a ticking time bomb that congress is too scared to touch. If any effect at all, the New Deal's was negative.   You're right that socialist policies have been implemented here and there over the years, including the bank bail outs and Obamacare, but that doesn't mean they have ever been proven to work.   And, you're right: a Sanders/Paul debate series would be great!"
randpaul,3bexh9,boughtitout,2,Mon Jun 29 02:32:23 2015 UTC,"Actually, you're not quite correct.  The recovery from the depression didn't actually occur until after WW2 when the US gov't cut taxes by nearly 50% as hundreds of thousands were coming home from war and all the manufacturing jobs supporting the war effort had dried up as there was no longer a need to build planes, tanks, etc...  The government can't tax and spend in order to create any real growth to an economy (it can work in the short term, but doesn't lead to any real sustainable growth unless you want to always be at war.... this seems vaguely familiar......)"
randpaul,3bexh9,DaveB42,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:04:03 2015 UTC,"The period afterward was definitely the true period of recovery, but wasn't there a severe drop in unemployment during the war?  The government employed millions of men to go fight. The war machine employed millions more to produce the war materials needed, many of them women joining the work force. The economy grew as a result.  I agree completely that government spending doesn't cause any real long-term growth."
randpaul,3bexh9,boughtitout,2,Mon Jun 29 18:48:37 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends on how you define economic growth.  All of the jobs that were created in WW2 were fueled with capital that came from tax revenue, subsidies and creating a short term demand for the manufacturing of goods to be used during the war.  However it wasn't a means of creating wealth which is the true factor of measurement when analyzing economic growth.  From a macroeconomic standpoint, it was a redistribution of tax revenue in order satisfy the demands for the war.  It's a Keysian fallacy that the government can spend money to create lasting economic growth.  In the short term, this logic is great if you're a politician and you want to tout the accomplishments of government management of an economy.  This same logic can be applied when the politicians claimed that we ""recovered"" from the 2008 recession.  This feeds the boom bust economy which makes recessions predictable.  There's another one around the corner..."

randpaul,3b2p1b,DEYoungRepublicans,13,Thu Jun 25 14:11:14 2015 UTC,"Rand Paul is poised to become the first major presidential candidate in memory to sue the government he seeks to lead as president.   The Kentucky senator will take legal action against the U.S. Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service for what he says is the denial of his constitutional right to vote on more than 100 tax-information treaties that the Obama administration unilaterally negotiated with foreign governments, The Washington Times has learned.  In what the suit says is a violation of Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution, President Obama has not consulted the U.S. Senate about the treaties nor given the Senate an opportunity to approve or disapprove of the treaties. The administration calls them “intergovernmental agreements.” They require foreign banks to gather and share private financial information about millions of Americans living and working outside the U.S. — information they would not have to disclose to the U.S. government if they lived and worked in the U.S.  The treaties or agreements are the enforcement mechanisms of the Obama administration’s Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), enacted by a Democratic-controlled Congress in 2010.  The act is despised by many of the estimated 8.7 million Americans living overseas, a record number of whom have — with great anger and reluctance, according to those who have spoken to the foreign and U.S. press — renounced their U.S. citizenship rather than attempt to comply with FATCA.  What percentage of them simply want to evade paying taxes to the U.S. government and to the foreign governments in whose countries they work and/or reside is unknown. The U.S. is one of the few countries that taxes its citizens on income earned and property held both at home and abroad.  President Obama pushed for the passage of FATCA as a means of capturing hundreds of millions of dollars in income and property taxes owed to the Treasury by those Americans living and working outside the U.S. But many Americans living abroad say the Treasury and the IRS are treating them as guilty of tax evasion until proven innocent.  “Obama owns this,” said Indiana-based GOP superlawyer Jim Bopp, the lead attorney for Mr. Paul and other plaintiffs in the case. “FATCA passed Congress right after Obama was elected, when the Democrats had majorities in both houses” of Congress.  “The issue is inescapably partisan for that reason and for the fact that no Republican [in the U.S. House] supported the passage of FATCA,” Mr. Bopp said. “The U.S. government didn’t start enforcing it until Obama started to target U.S. citizens overseas in the belief that they had a lot of money but not a lot of political clout sufficient to fight back.”  Nations that have approved these bilateral agreements or treaties with the U.S. include such major economic powers as China, Britain, India, Israel, Ireland, Canada, Australia, Japan, Germany, France, Spain and Switzerland, as well smaller states once considered as tax havens such as Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, Lichtenstein and Luxembourg. So far, 112 nations have agreed to collect or receive private financial information about Americans in those countries and to turn the information over to the U.S. government.  Constitutional clash  Mr. Paul, a Republican who announced his presidential bid in early April, will join six other plaintiffs in the suit that a new organization called “Republicans Overseas Action” expects to file in a southern Ohio federal district court the week of June 29. The court’s Republican makeup is considered at least open to the constitutional arguments that the plaintiffs lay out.  The other plaintiffs base their claim of legal standing to sue the Treasury and the IRS on FATCA’s requirement that they surrender personal information in violation of the Fourth Amendment’s ban on unreasonable search and seizure and on the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishments — in this case, unusually large financial penalties for late filings, however innocent, or for noncooperation.  FATCA requires foreign banks to violate the privacy of their American customers by disclosing bank balances and all financial transactions. The U.S. law levies a hefty 30 percent fine on foreign financial institutions that don’t cooperate with the Treasury’s requests. The fine is actually levied against the American customer of the foreign bank, but critics say no bank can keep its customer base with fines of that magnitude.  The law also directly fines the American holder of a foreign account as much as 50 percent of the highest balance that was in that account at any time during a 12-month period as penalty for not reporting.  Mr. Paul’s suit argues that the administration purposely avoided calling the arrangements “treaties” and instead labeled them as “intergovernmental agreements” to escape having to get Senate approval. Earlier this year, Mr. Paul introduced a Senate bill to repeal FATCA. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has not scheduled debate on the bill.  Michael DeSombre, an American residing in Hong Kong, is the worldwide president for Republicans Overseas Action. He sees Democratic presumptive nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton as vulnerable on the FATCA controversy.  “When FATCA was enacted in 2010, Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. Many overseas Americans complained how unjust and destructive this law is to U.S. embassies and consulate general offices around the world. What I want to know is what did Hillary do with those reports in this election,” said Mr. DeSombre.  The other plaintiffs in the suit Mr. Paul has joined say they have been denied banking and financial services in the foreign countries where they live and work. The foreign banks don’t want to be burdened with the expense and paperwork to comply with FATCA and therefore simply refuse to accept Americans as clients.  The Republican National Committee and the recently formed Republican Overseas Action aim to get as many of those Americans living or working outside their country to register in one or another of the swing states that decide the presidency in close elections. Republicans Overseas Action is paying for the lawsuit Mr. Paul has joined as plaintiff.  The driving force behind the suit is a longtime conservative activist on the Republican National Committee, Solomon Yue of Oregon.  “The best way to defend 8.7 million overseas Americans’ right to privacy and constitutional protections is to cripple the IRS, FATCA and enforcement tools through legal action on constitutional grounds all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court,” said Mr. Yue, founder and vice chairman of Republicans Overseas Action Inc.

""I like that booty, you know where to put it"", isn't this a clear example of sexual degeneracy and immorality infiltrating our culture?

Was it awkward that Kevin Hart contributed nothing for the entire three minutes? Was Chantelle a good choice as a back-up dancer for the ""left cheek, right cheek"" sequence? Are you on team T-Pain or team T-Steak?   Go!"

Looking at ways to reduce NASA’s spending is long overdue.  In addition, NASA has consistently been flagged by organizations like Citizens Against Government Waste, which most recently highlighted NASA’s multibillion-dollar Constellation program, a project that has been focused on the exploration of the moon and Mars. Despite spending more than $10 billion on this program, NASA has made very little progress since the program’s inception.  Finally, since President Obama has determined to realign the goals of NASA away from human exploration, and more on science and “global warming” research, the need to fund the agency at levels not consistent with the goals of the past provides the opportunity to direct funds toward deficit reduction."""

randpaul,3ayh3r,jscoppe,-2,Wed Jun 24 15:41:59 2015 UTC,Pandering to the black vote is stupid for a republican. Unless he's going to pander with increased social programs or something too. This just turns off the libertarian white vote which are where the majority of his votes come from and he just threw it under the pc bandwagon. Does he stand for anything that he wouldn't bow down to the PC for? This just doesn't seem like something a libertarian should be saying and I dunno if he'll get my vote because of it.

We can debate the appropriateness of a governmental agency flying a particular flag, but it is approved by elected representatives and falls under the 1st amendment.   I myself fly a Gadsden flag in my yard. Everyone's interpretation of symbology is different; that's the way it is with symbols.

I think what he is talking about is for the SC legislature to remove the ""stars and bars"" ""so-called Rebel Flag"" from the state flag. If they are the ones who put it there is the first place, then they also have the power and right to remove it.

Btw, you do realize that there was no discussion here. Right? You know that right ?   Let's set aside for a moment that the entire idea that the flag really means something special to small government southerners is ignoring the fact that that came completely from its use as a pro-slavery, pro-white dominance symbol. Let's also set aside that even if a symbol means one thing to a small group of people that doesn't make it ok as a government symbol when everyone else sees its history and has a very different reaction. Let's leave that all that aside.  This has utterly nothing to do with your assertion or mine. You asserted that Rand Paul's position in this context should be classified as ""shit statists say""- that it somehow doesn't match a libertarian ethos. My reply to you focused on the fact that this isn't about any sort of statist impositon, but is about whether it is appropriate for the flag to fly on official displays on public property. In that context, your reply is a complete non-sequitur. Now, do you want to actually respond to the matter under discussion at all?"
randpaul,3avysq,JoshuaZ1,-3,Wed Jun 24 20:59:32 2015 UTC,"Let's set aside for a second you aren't a condescending asshat. The fact that you seemingly dismiss those who side with the confederate flag as a ""small group"" and then suggest everyone else see it as a emblem of hate speaks volumes about your intellectual integrity. Just because you can aim your remote at your TV and turn on CNN doesn't make you an expert on what ""everyone"" thinks.

The fact that you seemingly dismiss those who side with the confederate flag as a ""small group"" and then suggest everyone else see it as a emblem of hate speaks volumes about your intellectual integrity.   The small group here isn't everyone who ""side with the confederate flag"" but rather ""small govt southerners"" who care about the flag (your own description).

randpaul,3avjqp,herbadah,2,Tue Jun 23 21:10:32 2015 UTC,"In the catalog of responses he had to choose from this is the only one that makes sense politically.  A well thought out rambling one hour lecture, hemming and hawing on a circuitous path through history is totally out of the question.  That's what it would take to lay out a fair case for that flag, right now it's a mine field.  With so many opportunities to say something that could be taken out of context, why risk it?  I know it's stretch for logic, but don't forget the newsletters Ron Paul had to deal with that deep-sixed 2008.  Logic isn't the media's strong suit, they'd love to connect the dots here labeling Rand a racist ""just like his dad"" (vomit).  Rand put the kibosh on that with a clear statement.  There's no room for nuance now, the primary season is about six months away.

It's like states still hanging the union jack flag. (This point was made by Glenn Beck and I think this is a good analogy) In the flag's current state, for me at least, it holds the connotation of racism, but that could be my misinterpretation."
randpaul,3avjqp,Fcorange5,2,Wed Jun 24 20:12:46 2015 UTC,"to many people they feel it means racism, but thats the beauty of a symbol, it can mean different things for different people. i think banning any sort of symbol is only going to make things worse, it further charges the many sides and makes it harder to speak openly about these problems. it makes it a us vs them sort of thing, a black vs white, good vs evil. Both sides of course feel they are on the high ground, but itll just cause trouble.   These sort of emotional outbursts are how things like the patriot act get put in place, after a tragedy theyll be a surge in the government trying to shore up more power to itself, or at least thats a worry I have.

News flash for you: They attack us because we and our allies won't leave them the f*ck alone; we kill their babies through sanctions, we invade, we occupy, we drone-bomb, we arrange coups that take out democratically-elected leaders, we install puppet regimes, we prop up brutal dictators and military juntas and brutally oppressive apartheid states that happen to be pro-US. Every intervention we've done in the middle east for the past two or three generations has backfired on us. You'd do well to read some things from the Ron Paul Reading List that he gave to Rudy ""9/11! 9/11! 9/11! 9/11!"" Guiliani after their famous exchange in that 2007 GOP debate. Chalmers Johnson's Blowback, Robert Pape's Dying to Win, Michael Scheuer's Imperial Hubris, and the 9/11 commission report itself.  Our key ""allies"" over there are the brutal Saudis that behead more people than ISIS and fund terrorists worldwide, and a brutal apartheid state that shall not be named. All these ""allies"" do is get us in deeper shit. That's the worst kind of ""ally"" to have. We should give them their walking papers.  ISIS has no navy ships or ICBMs or long range bombers. They are not an existential threat to us. They wouldn't be doing as well if we hadn't funded and equipped them via Syrian rebels. They have shown no ability to govern, so as soon as their money and weapons supply runs out, they'll fall apart."
randpaul,3argd0,bkny88,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:00:54 2015 UTC,Right so the world should just sit back and do nothing while they murder and rape their way to dominating the middle east and north Africa. They'll acquire chemical weaponry from Syria and nuclear material from Pakistan. Collect long range missiles from the governments they take over. Threaten peaceful nations with them.

It seems like he answers foreign policy questions either in mindless platitudes or with horribly incorrect statements. I personally think the basis for his campaign is a joke, but that's a whole different story.   But Rand's real advantage is that the moderate vote looks to be very split between Walker, Bush, and Rubio. And if Perry, Trump, Christie, Kasich, Graham, or any other moderate candidate picks up steam, they dilute that vote which more than likely won't belong to Rand in the first place. So it all comes down to how many candidates remain upon Iowa's caucauses."

I could live my life just fine if i didn't hear another thing come out of Sanders mouth.

America was born out of capitalism. I am glad Bernie stands for civil liberties and is against the Patriot Act.  I am glad he realizes that this system is corrupted now for the wealthy.  But the cause of all of our problems has been too much government.  Those wealthy people bought off the politicians and that is why they are able to scam us, and that is why there is greater income disparities.  Too much government has wrecked everything. Just look at the banker bailouts of 2008. Or take ObamaCare for example, but yet Bernie wants to go full on with more government creating a single payer system.  Good grief.  It seems Bernie thinks the answer to our problems is MORE government.  More government will just make things worse.  Having a stronger more powerful government just allows the rich to get more power when they buy off the government.  It really bothers me and is very troubling that Americans can't understand that if we just follow the constitution and limit our government to its designed purpose we can get liberty and economic prosperity again."

The society laid many of the foundations of the Labour Party and subsequently affected the policies of states emerging from the decolonisation of the British Empire, most notably India and Singapore.  Originally, the Fabian society was committed to the establishment of a socialist economy, alongside a commitment to British imperialism as a progressive and modernizing force.   Today, the society functions primarily as a think tank and is one of 15 socialist societies affiliated with the Labour Party. Similar societies exist in Australia (the Australian Fabian Society), in Canada (the Douglas-Coldwell Foundation and the now disbanded League for Social Reconstruction), in Sicily (Sicilian Fabian Society) and in New Zealand.

The reason is that on the real issues that distinguish Rand Paul from the Republican crowd, he and Bernie agree, so there wouldn't be much debate. So instead of focusing on warrantless domestic spying, over militarization of the police, the out of control war on people who use drugs, the excessive use of force by police against minorities, etc., the debate would focus on economic issues.  On those Bernie wouldn't go full socialist because he wouldn't have to. He'd go with the populist form of big government: the rich are stealing from us, businesses and greed are causing the downfall of our way of life, increase the minimum wage to $15/hour to solve all our problems, free healthcare for all because no one should die, just regulate an end to pollution and low prices, etc. Even if Paul parries each populist thrust with a well-reasoned counter, Sanders' easy-peasy big government views would get all the cheers."

Zero pollution would be very expensive and hard to obtain. We’d have to shut down the economy. Letting people pollute as much as they want is also clearly bad. So somewhere in the middle, the costs that society incurs from the pollution that happens is about equivalent to the benefits from generating that pollution.

The media should only report on fact and how it affects American lives. This eye surgery has nothing to do with anything, and id like to think Rand would appreciate the fact that a ""good deed"" goes unnoticed because people shouldn't do deeds for publicity they should do them because it's inherently a good thing to do.

randpaul,3aafjl,DICKPIXTHROWAWAY,3,Thu Jun 18 23:05:15 2015 UTC,The difference between growth in tax deferred plans and compound taxed assets is quite substantial.   I have already sacrificed liquidity by enrolling in tax deferred programs and in some cases have already been taxed on some of them with the understanding that I will have tax deferred growth. Being taxed on these funds will cut my estimated funds for retirement by a huge number and in some cases tax me when I have already been taxed and been under the understanding that I would not be taxed again.  If this plan is implemented I'm not gonna be happy. It is raising my taxes.

randpaul,3aafjl,sippinonthatarizona,4,Thu Jun 18 20:19:11 2015 UTC,There's a valid concern with capital gains taxes as many people have 401k and retirement accounts which would have their gains be completely wiped out by a 14.5% tax. Other than that I don't see the problem.
randpaul,3aafjl,stephencrane,7,Thu Jun 18 20:48:59 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't only the gains be taxed? The current tax code already has a 15% long-term capital gains tax (which can go up to 22.5% at higher tax rates). So, it seems like this would be a straight-up reduction in capital gains taxes."
randpaul,3aafjl,timepad,8,Thu Jun 18 21:31:56 2015 UTC,"ya, this plan does not hurt 401ks."
randpaul,3aafjl,sippinonthatarizona,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:54:08 2015 UTC,401k's are taxed as regular income upon distribution not as capital gains. 14.5% is > 0% tax on growth. 14.5% compounded by 40-50 years is a very large tax hike.  This is how many americans plan on funding their retirement.

Tax free growth and distributions. Good idea if you plan on making more money in retirement than you are making now.  CNN says Paul doesn't plan to touch retirement incomes.  However if the video's ""no special tax breaks"" claim is true this would mean taxing the growth of roth IRAs as well as the distributions. Which would mean people have had their money locked away for years for little to no benefit. Oh and also they have to work several more years to reach their retirement goals.  http://www.rothira.com/what-is-a-Roth-IRA"

You can control your withdraws from your 401k to keep yourself as low as 10% tax rate. (certain RMD's may apply)  Should this ""special tax break"" be removed instead the 401k will be taxed at 14.5% every year on the growth. That website will help you calculate the impact that has on your savings.   In the example. It lowers your retirement fund by 15% before you withdraw anything. This number could be bigger or smaller depending on the size of your retirement fund and how long you save.  Compound this by another 14.5% tax and you get a net 27.5% tax compared to what is currently as low as 10%. That's almost triple the current minimum taxes."
randpaul,3aafjl,timtom45,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:10:37 2015 UTC,"I guess i'm confused on the compounding part. Are you saying that it is treated like a CD or savings account, where you are taxed as income every year, and not like investments that are only taxed when they are settled?"

randpaul,3aafjl,duggabboo,2,Fri Jun 19 15:20:22 2015 UTC,Dr. Paul has said this is the first part of his plan.  I assume the next part(s) of the plan will address spending cuts and reallocations.  Social Security and Medicare aren't going away.  The federal government will just have to become more efficient in order to keep them funded.

Everything! needs to be cut, but establishment democrats and republican refuse to acknowledge this.

Social security, medicare, and medicade cost monies.  These programs inevitably cost more and more monies due to a growing population and increased costs.  If we do nothing to decrease the growth of these programs, which cost monies, the government will have to spend ALL of it's monies it has on these programs alone in 10 years.  Using ALL of the monies that government collects to pay for social security, medicare, and medicade would leave zero monies for the boom boom guns because monies minus all the monies equals zero monies.  understand now?"

Sad for the accountants but good for everyone else and the entire economy.    this same argument is made by the unions when people try to automate their jobs. they state that there will be job loss and  that is true in their sector but that money will go into other sectors and overall wages will go up as we are producing more for a lower cost."

Performing a job less efficiently (current tax jobs) or creating a good for a higher cost (such as construction workers refusing to allow machines to do their work) decreases the amount of money in the economy to go to other parts.  For example, if we are to follow the devil advocate way of thinking, in order to boost the economy we should simply get rid of all machines and start doing everything by manual labor.

They focus on one industry and forget about everything else.    If a person has 300 dollars extra because they didnt have to pay an accountant, they will go and spend that somewhere else (say buying a new tv) so the revenue for best buy just went up.  The economy doesn't have industries in isolated bubbles, yes it hurts, but if you held up progress to protect industries we would still be riding horses.  What about the horse ranchers? the people that provide food for the horses, the supply line?  I mean, looking at history and applying the same logic you can see how silly this is."

Cut deductions. Watch the economy roar.  By RAND PAUL June 17, 2015 7:09 p.m. ET  Some of my fellow Republican candidates for the presidency have proposed plans to fix the tax system. These proposals are a step in the right direction, but the tax code has grown so corrupt, complicated, intrusive and antigrowth that I’ve concluded the system isn’t fixable.  So on Thursday I am announcing an over $2 trillion tax cut that would repeal the entire IRS tax code—more than 70,000 pages—and replace it with a low, broad-based tax of 14.5% on individuals and businesses. I would eliminate nearly every special-interest loophole. The plan also eliminates the payroll tax on workers and several federal taxes outright, including gift and estate taxes, telephone taxes, and all duties and tariffs. I call this “The Fair and Flat Tax.”  President Obama talks about “middle-class economics,” but his redistribution policies have led to rising income inequality and negative income gains for families. Here’s what I propose for the middle class: The Fair and Flat Tax eliminates payroll taxes, which are seized by the IRS from a worker’s paychecks before a family ever sees the money. This will boost the incentive for employers to hire more workers, and raise after-tax income by at least 15% over 10 years.  Here’s why we have to start over with the tax code. From 2001 until 2010, there were at least 4,430 changes to tax laws—an average of one “fix” a day—always promising more fairness, more simplicity or more growth stimulants. And every year the Internal Revenue Code grows absurdly more incomprehensible, as if it were designed as a jobs program for accountants, IRS agents and tax attorneys.  Polls show that “fairness” is a top goal for Americans in our tax system. I envision a traditionally All-American solution: Everyone plays by the same rules. This means no one of privilege, wealth or with an arsenal of lobbyists can game the system to pay a lower rate than working Americans.  Most important, a smart tax system must turbocharge the economy and pull America out of the slow-growth rut of the past decade. We are already at least $2 trillion behind where we should be with a normal recovery; the growth gap widens every month. Even Mr. Obama’s economic advisers tell him that the U.S. corporate tax code, which has the highest rates in the world (35%), is an economic drag. When an iconic American company like Burger King wants to renounce its citizenship for Canada because that country’s tax rates are so much lower, there’s a fundamental problem.  Another increasingly obvious danger of our current tax code is the empowerment of a rogue agency, the IRS, to examine the most private financial and lifestyle information of every American citizen. We now know that the IRS, through political hacks like former IRS official Lois Lerner, routinely abused its auditing power to build an enemies list and harass anyone who might be adversarial to President Obama’s policies. A convoluted tax code enables these corrupt tactics.  My tax plan would blow up the tax code and start over. In consultation with some of the top tax experts in the country, including the Heritage Foundation’s Stephen Moore, former presidential candidate Steve Forbes and Reagan economist Arthur Laffer, I devised a 21st-century tax code that would establish a 14.5% flat-rate tax applied equally to all personal income, including wages, salaries, dividends, capital gains, rents and interest. All deductions except for a mortgage and charities would be eliminated. The first $50,000 of income for a family of four would not be taxed. For low-income working families, the plan would retain the earned-income tax credit.  I would also apply this uniform 14.5% business-activity tax on all companies—down from as high as nearly 40% for small businesses and 35% for corporations. This tax would be levied on revenues minus allowable expenses, such as the purchase of parts, computers and office equipment. All capital purchases would be immediately expensed, ending complicated depreciation schedules.  The immediate question everyone asks is: Won’t this 14.5% tax plan blow a massive hole in the budget deficit? As a senator, I have proposed balanced budgets and I pledge to balance the budget as president.  Here’s why this plan would balance the budget: We asked the experts at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation to estimate what this plan would mean for jobs, and whether we are raising enough money to fund the government. The analysis is positive news: The plan is an economic steroid injection. Because the Fair and Flat Tax rewards work, saving, investment and small business creation, the Tax Foundation estimates that in 10 years it will increase gross domestic product by about 10%, and create at least 1.4 million new jobs.  And because the best way to balance the budget and pay down government debt is to put Americans back to work, my plan would actually reduce the national debt by trillions of dollars over time when combined with my package of spending cuts.  The left will argue that the plan is a tax cut for the wealthy. But most of the loopholes in the tax code were designed by the rich and politically connected. Though the rich will pay a lower rate along with everyone else, they won’t have special provisions to avoid paying lower than 14.5%.  The challenge to this plan will be to overcome special-interest groups in Washington who will muster all of their political muscle to save corporate welfare. That’s what happened to my friend Steve Forbes when he ran for president in 1996 on the idea of the flat tax. Though the flat tax was surprisingly popular with voters for its simplicity and its capacity to boost the economy, crony capitalists and lobbyists exploded his noble crusade.  Today, the American people see the rot in the system that is degrading our economy day after day and want it to end. That is exactly what the Fair and Flat Tax will do through a plan that’s the boldest restoration of fairness to American taxpayers in over a century.  Sen. Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, is running for his party’s presidential nomination."

This says it all.  The elitists are running our country identically to how the liberals are running California.  That is why companies are leaving California for Texas in droves.   The first $50,000 of income for a family of four will not be taxed.   No payroll taxes and no taxes for famlies of four less than $50,000 would be a HUGE middle class stimulus. An ACTUAL stimulus ,not creating FIAT money and handing it to Wall Street like Obama and Bush !!!!!  Rand is going to SLAUGHTER Hillary at the polls !!!!"

randpaul,3a8hgg,gccobra,13,Thu Jun 18 01:41:44 2015 UTC,"But do not be fooled. Libertarianism has a complicated history, and it is by and large a sordid one. Its leading 20th-century theorist was the novelist Ayn Rand, who, for all her talk of freedom, was an authoritarian at heart. She was intolerant of dissent and conspiratorial to  a fault. Libertarians elected to public office on the basis of her ideas, including former Republican Representative Ron Paul, Rand Paul’s father, have adhered to such radical positions as abolishing the Federal Reserve.   It's very hard to want to keep reading after this paragraph. There is nothing here that resembles a logical argument - it's just a collection of shock words. Sordid. Authoritarian. Intolerant. Conspiratorial. Radical.  Ayn Rand was not the leading libertarian theorist of the 20th century. She was not even a libertarian. She was an objectivist. Ron Paul did not get elected on the basis of her ideas, but on the ideas of Rothbard and Mises and Hayek. Abolishing the Federal Reserve has nothing to do with Ayn Rand, and the idea certainly did not originate with her. Calling ""libertarianism"" authoritarian is an oxymoron, which he accomplishes through his less than clever use of a straw man. And it's curious that the word ""Stalinism"" never appears in the article apart from the headline. In all, this is trash."
randpaul,3a8hgg,naked_gun,5,Thu Jun 18 03:27:39 2015 UTC,"Lol, it was a complete strawman, propaganda article.  The article has Stalinism in the title, yet never even mentions Stalin or Stalinism.  The central bank is a main tenet of the communist manifesto, and the Fed did not even exist until 1913.  Many of the Founders were famously against any central bank.  The level of BS in this article was hard to handle.  It would take hours just to refute all the lies and misleading points.  Its sad that people are so in the dark these days, that they will read this kind of thing and believe it actually has some substance."

His last book is called, ""The Future of Liberalism"" and his last article is called,"" Why Conservatives Cannot Govern"". Need I say more?  The author is simply spewing rhetoric behind a title that makes a statement he could never even hope to justify with logic.  TL/DR  The author is a leftist shill who is letting his alligator mouth write checks his butterfly ass could never cash."
randpaul,3a8hgg,ot1s_f1r3fly,6,Thu Jun 18 04:50:58 2015 UTC,"Libertarianism at is core is complete individual freedom. In any system there will never be an utopia but if a society strives towards ultimate individual freedom the people will at least gain some individual freedom, which is the exact opposite of Stalinism. Yes all societies strive for a governing utopia but Libertarianism and Stalinism are starkly different.  ""Stalinist policies in the Soviet Union included: state terror, rapid industrialization, the theory of socialism in one country, a centralized state, collectivization of agriculture, cult of personality, and subordination of interests of foreign communist parties to those of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union—deemed by Stalinism to be the most forefront vanguard party of communist revolution at the time.""  -Wikipedia"

randpaul,3a8hgg,MorningLtMtn,2,Thu Jun 18 08:18:28 2015 UTC,"Lots of other great comments here. For me, the following paragraph was quite revealing:   For libertarianism is among the most rigid of modern ideologies. The theorists who formulated its core principles were seekers after political purity. They created an ideal world designed to work perfectly — but only if human beings acted consistently. Society, to them, was like a Swiss watch: Let every part play its designed role, and the whole thing would run on its own accord.   She makes it sound as if libertarians want to control everyone's life, dictating everyone's actions... by giving them the freedom to do whatever the f@#$ they want? It makes no sense.  There are two ways of being a libertarian, in my view. There are what I call the 'purists' who see anything that seems to not 100% bow down to their view as evil, disgusting, and worth yelling about. These are the kinds who got extremely pissed off about Rand Paul supporting Romney. These are people who want their (or at least I call it) positive view followed to the letter. By positive I don't mean good/bad, but its about creating their ideal.  The second way is seeing authoritarianism, bureaucracy, and disrespect for people's autonomy and freedom as a problem. This is trying to destroy the negatives of those who completely disregard libertarian values. One doesn't have to be a libertarian per se to value freedom and autonomy of individuals.   I see Rand Paul as a bit of a combination. He see's the former as an ideal, but the problems that really need to be fixed right now are more of the latter."

I don't know why Libertarians wouldn't support that. I mean they might not provide funds, or register as republican (depending on the state) to provide him primary votes, but I think pretty much all of them should provide moral support in the primary. If Rand loses the primary, they'll still get their vote for Gary Johnson in November. If Rand wins the primary, then they really have to make a decision... but this article put the cart before the horse.  I'm not a professional handicapper, but I'd say Rand has about a 25% chance to win the primary (which is actually decent with as crowded as the field is). However if he wins the primary, I think he's got a 2/3 chance to win the general against someone like Hillary."

randpaul,39ucar,TRKillShot,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:43:15 2015 UTC,I have a good idea of what his ideas are. My point is that he needs to advertise them more during the primaries.
randpaul,39ucar,catchingtherosemary,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:12:48 2015 UTC,I completely agree.  It would help take the attention away from his foreign policy for those in the Republican Party who have issue with that and give them something they can't disagree with.
randpaul,39ucar,trosamurijack,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:30:37 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. He's smart tho, he's intentionally staying focused on hot topics in the public eye and media. The cannons are loaded when the RINOs decide to start talking economy again"
randpaul,39ucar,BrewerPhil,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:06:42 2015 UTC,"His book goes into detail as well. Though, when it comes to winning, it's going to be more about the social issues than the fiscal issues that matter."
randpaul,39ucar,wekulm,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:48:41 2015 UTC,I think he wants to draw Democrats into the Republican primaries and talking economics would drive them away.
randpaul,39tubf,EvanBuck,8,Sun Jun 14 18:42:23 2015 UTC,"I think Ben Carson is too much of a neocon. He could go with Wyden and get some dem votes, and it would show bipartisanship which a lot of the country would like after seeing government be gridlocked for so long."
randpaul,39tubf,Murica76,5,Sun Jun 14 19:29:05 2015 UTC,Ben Carson lacks experience and statesmanship. While he may appeal to Rand's base he will not appeal to many independents. He says too many stupid things.
randpaul,39tubf,JMF3737,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:49:47 2015 UTC,"Ben Carson does have a great view on healthcare (from what I've seen so far). I haven't seen any detailed plans from him, but his emphasis on HSA's make it sound like he is for a universal system which literally injects american/individualist values into it."
randpaul,39tubf,RealEmaster,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:49:05 2015 UTC,"A universal system can't be individualist though. A better option is to get rid of government intrusion in healthcare, and that will bring the price down better than any government program could."
randpaul,39tubf,Murica76,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:59:13 2015 UTC,"Its called HSA accounts. Everyone gets an HSA, and can spend their health money on their health as they see fit. It rewards saving money, instead of spending as much as you can."
randpaul,39tubf,RealEmaster,2,Sun Jun 21 18:15:01 2015 UTC,"I think Susana Martinez is a very strong possibility. She's more of a standard conservative, but has been positioning herself to not upset libertarians with some of her recent moves. Most notably by reigning in civil forfeiture here in NM."
randpaul,39tubf,gonzoforpresident,3,Mon Jun 15 01:36:30 2015 UTC,I think she would be a good choice. Good conservative credentials. Popular in a blue state. Minority. Woman. She would make a lot of sense.

randpaul,39tubf,Eric_Blair_Was_Right,2,Mon Jun 15 01:50:06 2015 UTC,Best answer in the thread
randpaul,39tubf,photonblaster9000,2,Mon Jun 15 14:32:32 2015 UTC,"Condi would be good. Can't think of another minority woman who has national recognition, Democrats included. (Obviously the First Lady) However, Rands foreign policy is completely different from her's. Rand wouldn't have invaded Iraq. Eh Rubio might be good."
randpaul,39tubf,Vornado0,2,Mon Jun 15 02:03:06 2015 UTC,"Justin Amash, Thomas Massie, or Ted Cruz"
randpaul,39tubf,DEYoungRepublicans,2,Mon Jun 15 06:56:40 2015 UTC,"I think the question should be what are Rand's strengths and weaknesses? Then, who fill those gaps. Assuming he wins the primary and must campaign against Hillary, He is young, lacks foreign policy experience, and lacks executive experience. To fill those, we're probably looking for an older statesman with either military or gubernatorial experience. It makes an interesting case for Romney or Huntsman though neither are looking too interested at the moment. Bush would be a very interesting pick as well. He hasn't gone after Rand with the ferocity others have and make a nice mix of new and old."
randpaul,39tubf,JMF3737,2,Mon Jun 15 15:03:31 2015 UTC,"Carson and Cruz are too inflammatory for a national campaign, Carson's view on homosexuality was costly.  He would have otherwise been the one of the best political moves and not entirely unprincipled.  Napolitano would be the best steward of the constitution. I hear behind the scenes when the judge gets together with Rockwell and Woods he is the most libertarian man at the table. That's pretty hardcore but ultimately he is a TV personality. Amash another great pick for a non establishment hack. Massie too. He is a solid liberty lover. Amash being a better fit. I think Paul/Massie is too white and too from Kentucky. Amash is a bit swarthy and ads a little color. I think his parents are Christian's from somewhere in the Middle east. So that's a score. Stossel, he works for Fox. I think the REALITY is the GOP will shove Rubio down Rand's throat as an ""insurance policy""."
randpaul,39tubf,randouser,2,Sun Jun 14 22:45:55 2015 UTC,"Rubio wouldn't be a bad choice I think. He would definitely appeal across demographics. Also, he seems earnest even if somewhat distant from Rand's viewpoints"
randpaul,39tubf,JMF3737,2,Sun Jun 14 19:30:47 2015 UTC,"I think Marco ""combover"" Rubio is as big an establishment tool as they come. He couldn't be bothered to read tpp before committing to it. He is part of the gang of 8 and he is an unapologetic warhawk who favored the permanent extension of the patriot act. He is seemingly offensive to independents, libertarians, millennials and the antiwar crowd. He is to Rand Paul what George bush was to Reagan."

randpaul,39tubf,RealEmaster,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:54:54 2015 UTC,"believe it or not- my suggestion was not a joke.  im aware it may be unchartered territory to make a vp choice with differing views, but rand is not your typical candidate and i think in addition to bringing crossover appeal to many independents- i think she is also right about a lot of what she says.  as im writing this i realized that she is not even a republican but i dont care i stand behind my pick."
randpaul,39oya8,photonblaster9000,5,Sat Jun 13 10:13:42 2015 UTC,There ya go. Common sense answers continue from the Paul family.

randpaul,39nsym,NASA_is_awesome,6,Sat Jun 13 21:37:46 2015 UTC,"It's a risky experiment   It's not risky at all. This will drive home that everyone else wants to take money out of the economy and then put it back in to politically favored parties. Rand Paul's point is to just stop taking money out of the economy, and show that jobs will flourish when the government stops disincentivizing them. He'll start in economically troubled areas, show that it works, and then spread it to the country as a whole.  I guess I see zero risk."
randpaul,39nsym,zugi,4,Sat Jun 13 08:39:38 2015 UTC,America should be an economic freedom zone
randpaul,39nsym,8494,1 point,Sat Jun 13 16:16:43 2015 UTC,"something like that would alleviate poverty and help lift EVERYONE up.   Government can not alleviate poverty, only help cause it.  But if I had to guess his plan would not include helping banks give bad loans, then letting them pack them in securities and sell them to the Federal Reserve where these banks charge a transaction fee on selling their shitty assets overpriced.  (This was Obama's plan to ""alleviate poverty""). Anything that includes less of this should help."

randpaul,39ldil,jscoppe,6,Fri Jun 12 16:44:50 2015 UTC,"In 2012 Ron Paul dominated the place, there were some huge shenanigans and the results were delayed, and delayed. Anyway, I am not surprised that they do not want to hold it, there is no way that it would work out for the establishment politicians since they can't control it as well as they can the media (such as fox not including Rand in the polls)."

randpaul,39ggzf,sleeplessorion,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:07:09 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you assign a very low chance of her winning the election. Conditional on Hillary winning the Democratic nomination, what probability do you give her for losing the general?"
randpaul,39ggzf,JoshuaZ1,2,Sat Jun 13 17:14:56 2015 UTC,"A lot of factors are at play, and no one has really started full on campaigning yet, so it's pretty hard to tell. But, if it ends up a Paul vs Clinton race, I'm going to guess that Paul has probably a 60% chance. I think that his ""let the state's decide"" position on a lot of key issues will help him out, and I think that him being against domestic spying and police militarization will help him out, because those are pretty hot topics right now.   Now, there's still well over a year to go, so a lot can change. Someone's inevitably going to have a fuckup, and the media will milk it until next November.   I think if you look at the past few winners and losers, you'll see that everyone that's won has been more charismatic and likable/relatable than the loser. Clinton does not come off as being likable, and Rand does. I also think Clinton has a lot of scandals in her past, and probably some skeletons in her closet that might come out."

I'll go in depth to try to explain it in the hope that more of you all will make a similar page.   Basically, a Facebook page is like a second profile that's connected to your personal account. You'll see a link on the sidebar part of your newsfeed to create a page. Then, it'll give you the option to categorize what your page will be. I chose the organization one (it's the middle one on the top row) and then it'll prompt you to enter more information. Basically just a name, a description, a profile picture, and then you're target audience. I would pick 18 to 65+ just so you can get everyone haha. After that, the page will be created. I would then add a cover photo.  There will be no link from the page to your personal profile. The only way people will know you're involved to that page is if you invite people to like it, but it won't inform them who the page owner is. I HIGHLY recommend everyone to make a page for their city and county. Rand's numbers have been lacking, and we all know how the idiots at Fox News feel about him. A social media campaign is free, effective, and can do a lot to help him out.  If anyone has any more questions, let me know!"

randpaul,38y4tv,jcm267,5,Sun Jun 7 20:58:54 2015 UTC,"I guess the writer of this article is blissfully ignorant of the FACT that most of the equipment and arms ISIS is using, was bought and paid for by the American taxpayer.  Every time the war whores (hawks) invade a country we give up our bravest young men and women and TRILLIONS in our grand-children's tax dollars, ,with ZERO return.  We are neither safer, nor more prosperous from these wars and we never will be."
randpaul,38y4tv,ot1s_f1r3fly,2,Sun Jun 7 22:42:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a pretty funny article.  It seems to start the clock at Obama, ignoring the decade before that where we invaded and toppled the stable dictatorship in Iraq that had been keeping Islamic fundamentalist tendencies in check. After toppling Hussein, we dictated all the rules, like how Iraq had to remain one country with the arbitrary borders established by the West many decades earlier even though that created an odd and unstable mix, and that the Iraqi people had to repay the debts incurred by the dictator who brutalized them, and that we'd keep running and then forming their government, and that we'd keep lots of U.S. troops there for years. It's funny that the author blames Obama for the U.S. leaving Iraq, even though it was the government that we established who basically told us to leave after we occupied the place for almost a decade.  The U.S. destabilized the whole region and created the chaos that let ISIS prosper, and this was all fully supported by the hawks in both parties who seem to think they can predict the future, invade, occupy, micromanage, and everything will turn out great.  History shows that people want to be self-governing, so to run an empire you have to be brutal. I don't think the U.S. should be running an empire, and we don't have the stomach for the brutality that's required. Running empires has been frowned upon for almost a century now anyway, and we fought a pretty serious war 75 years ago to try to put a stop to that sort of thing. So it's odd that the hawks are so anxious to bring it back."

In late 2014 he was excited about the trade agreement but it hadn't even hit the Senate and no one could read it yet. When Obama tried to fast track it, Rand was upset over it and the entire idea of fast track. He stated that it's not like he'd never like it if it was an okay agreement but stated he didn't like the fact that obama tried to keep it secret due to fear of it ""breaking the republic"" if it got out. Rand is against anyone allowing fast track and thinks that the Senate needs to read what it signs. He also says fast track prevents any form of amendments to these laws. Paul might think, hey, 2/3rds of this isn't bad, but this 1/3rd has to go. He can't do that if fast track is passed"

Articles about it tend to bury that fact, so you have to look carefully to find that data on pages 12-13 of the detailed poll results, but AC360 did put the summary numbers up right before the end of tonight's broadcast.  It's odd that Republicans refuse to take notice that Rand Paul fares the best against Clinton. They should be singing his praises as the only one bringing young people and independents into the party, but instead party old-timers are actively trying to turn aging stalwart Republican voters against him."
randpaul,38bjgb,zugi,3,Wed Jun 3 04:51:49 2015 UTC,"Republican officials don't take note of it because they're more concerned with pushing their agenda through than they are with bringing forth a candidate who can beat the Democratic nominee.

That's why during the last two elections they nominated a guy who looks like Death and a Milquetoast Mormon who seemed less human, more TI-1000 against an individual who is a poor president but an excellent candidate.   Hmm, to me both recent Republican candidates lead to the opposite conclusion. Neither McCain nor Romney were considered ""true conservatives""; they won the nomination because Republicans really wanted to win and thought those guys gave them the best chances. Romney was a pro-choice governor who had introduced a universal healthcare model in Massachusetts that was almost identical to Obamacare, but ultimately he seemed more electable than the more conservative candidates like Santorum, Perry, Bachman, etc.  And after 8 years of Obama, Republicans just want to win even more fervently. But perhaps settling on the best candidate to win happens much later in the process; in the early stages it's a fight to see who can be the most extreme conservative."
randpaul,38bjgb,zugi,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:48:18 2015 UTC,"Romney was a pro-choice governor who had introduced a universal healthcare model in Massachusetts that was almost identical to Obamacare   Two things which Romney vehemently ran himself away from. His Obamacare-esque program was constantly used as a source of criticism and he himself declared that his abortion positions changed. So neither of those qualities helped him with people who may have voted for him based on those issues since he didn't run as a pro-choice, universal healthcare Republican.    But perhaps settling on the best candidate to win happens much later in the process; in the early stages it's a fight to see who can be the most extreme conservative.   Doesn't work that way with the way the primaries work. Typically the person who is going to win the nomination will win it within the first 10 states, so they can pull the ultra conservative personality out at that time and then if they win they just moderate themselves. It happens literally every election on both sides and so the search for the best candidate after the ""let's prove who's most conservative"" phase never actually happens. If we actually had a system where someone couldn't just win Iowa and New Hampshire and proceed to just win the nomination that might happen, but the fact that a state like Iowa can be the death knell for several campaigns all at once is ridiculous."

Yes, you need to have some tenure to get things done but when you've spent 30 years or more in the same seat, you're there for yourself, not the people.  The people would have led you to another job somewhere at some point.   I feel like our biggest threat to Liberty and Freedom right now is the politicians that think they can do whatever they want in the shadows and face no consequences. It's apparent in every aspect of society right now from mass surveillance, to police shooting and killing unarmed citizens. Don't even get me started on the clusterfuck of non reguations in the drone program.   I support Rand because he is focusing on putting the power back into the people.  By bashing Rand in their own defense, the rest of  the GOP is only highlighting to the people how dumb they think we are and how we don't have the capacity to understand what they think ""needs to be done"".  I know there are things the public shouldn't and cannot know, but that doesn't equate to all out anarchy abroad when it comes to our war policies.

""no"" ""I just want to drive this point home, do you take back what you said?"" ""no"" (paraphrased of course). It's like the guy even understands what paul is saying but refuses to let up just to please his superiors. If banks are too big to exist (sanders' view of course) corporate funded media giants are probably too big and too influential to exist too. They just argue from a nit-picky standpoint that, in the grand scheme of things, actually slows progress. Rand has better things to do than talk to some dumbass like this."
randpaul,38653d,drewshaver,2,Tue Jun 2 03:08:09 2015 UTC,"I wonder if it is against their party's rules or if they need their party's permission to have a debate with members of different parties before they have won their party's nomination if it were to be funded separately from the parties.  If not we could promote the idea of a debate for marginalized candidates of the different parties. I know that Bernie Sanders has been promoting this concept. We would need to find a suitable organization willing to host it and find a way to fund it whether it be through advertisements, grass roots donations, the candidates paying in, or some other means.   If they do need their party's permission though I doubt they would be able to get since they are after all marginalized and I imagine that is against the Republican and Democratic Party’s interest to have a bipartisan debate before nominations are chosen."
randpaul,38653d,Praxeological,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:43:39 2015 UTC,"I was happy to see that letter, but also rather perturbed that he made no mention of third party candidates. Especially from someone who so vocally opposed the duopoly earlier in his career.  I think we could demonstrate popular support for open debates, though, if we hold an open primary. Sort of like what American's Elect tried, but open to duopoly candidates. I've been working on a website this last month that could help us host this sort of thing, but got flooded with Sanders votes early on and need some more traffic to balance things out.  My plan is to basically to sort of bounce between the camps to drive traffic by highlighting which candidates are winning. e.g. Rand only has 10% right now but you could drive that way higher with 30 or 40 votes.  I've also got it set up to promote ordinary citizens as politicians (a la Liquid Democracy), here's what my page looks like: http://www.reclaimcongress.org/delegate/user/drewshaver  You don't have to confirm me as your delegate to vote in the primary -- just hit cancel and you can be your own delegate (you actually can be your own delegate even if you confirm, too, thanks to Liquid Democracy). Ideally after you vote take a couple minutes to set up your own platform and share that link with your friends in the Rand camp. I can also add affiliate options related to the candidates and/or ideologies if you'd like, just need to collect some relevant images.  After the poll has some semblance of not being biased, then we go to the Johnson and Stein camps to get some more voters, then we can sort of do that on repeat until each camp has a couple people watching the poll and driving traffic to make sure they don't fall too far behind.  At some point if we get noticed the major powers will attempt to marginalize us by saying 'well internet voting isn't the same as public opinion polling' but that is bullshit because even if Clinton is polling well that doesn't mean she has the activist support like Rand and Bernie.  I am not too concerned about funding, if we can get traffic then we can crowdfund pretty easily. We don't necc. need to find an org to host it I am in the process of launching a non profit along these lines anyways."

More than double what Paul had, and more than 37 times the amount the Koch's gave to Rand Paul.  So basically, the guy is a shill and a dishonest douche here with an agenda."
