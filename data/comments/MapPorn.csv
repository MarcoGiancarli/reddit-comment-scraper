They're not talking about a global holocaust, just how few children humans should be having.  Is it the ""earth cannot sustain us"" comment? Because that's absolutely true. At 2003 consumption rates, it took 150% of all the resources produced by earth in a year to sustain the planet, and consumption rates have only gone up worldwide since. Source."
MapPorn,3e1w2e,TheThomasMRyan,21,Tue Jul 21 15:17:51 2015 UTC,"The entire idea about families having 12 kids is a fictional problem.  ""Population control"" is the go to solution for people who don't know anything about demographics or economics.  The idea of these huge families in the third world eating the world to death is bullshit.  Lifestyle is the most important factor.  Families in the developed world often only have one or two kids but use more resources than fifty people in the developing world.     Some developed countries, most notably Japan, are even having catastrophic problems because decline birth rates left too few young people to entire the economy when the disproportionate elderly population retires.  China has recently repealed its famous One Child Policy to prevent such a scenario."
MapPorn,3e1w2e,wolfram184,8,Tue Jul 21 16:09:29 2015 UTC,"Both are factors.  The growing populations in developing countries don't have a major impact now, but as they develop those expanded populations will.

We produce energy (specifically renewable energy) at a rate much higher than before, much easier. Vertical farming, solar power, 3d printing, all of these things will make it easier to deal with overpopulation.   However if we allow our population to just continue growing old, we will turn into a social security state. Young people will be essentially removed from media and society, people will grow up depressed and probably alone, sex will become more and more taboo (look at Japan...), and our economy will suffer drastically.   Even while we might think something like a population decline would be good, in reality it causes a ton of problems, mostly social and cultural problems. Nobody wants to live in a place where the majority of the population is 65+."
MapPorn,3e1w2e,daimposter,2,Tue Jul 21 16:27:21 2015 UTC,"I didn't downvote but I do have some problems with his statements.  First, it seems like he's implying they are making an informed and willful decision to have lots of a babies. His words just seem very typical of those that say ""fuck poor people, stop having babies"".   Second, while poor countries do need to have a major drop in fertility rates, wealthy countries are struggling with the opposite. He said ""we need to stop having more than 2 kids"". You need more than 2 kids to sustain a population. Even if you have just enough kids to maintain a population (2.3 globally, 2.1 in wealthy countries), the population is going to become proportionally older and older.  This will cause a lot of economic problems."

IIRC Africa is the up-and-coming population boom, since a lot of the continent has high birth rates to counter infant mortality and medical advances are doing away with mortality rates.

Poorer African countries still has very high fertility rates, but other continents are either stable or slated to shrink a little. E.g. Europe's population doesn't decline mostly because of immigrants relocating here.  If a certain organization would stop saying condoms are evil and don't work, things would probably go better. And if we did a better job of eliminating poverty.  But even with that, the global fertility rate is 2.5 children, which is pretty close to a stable population (a stable population requiring a fertility rate a little bit above 2.0, since some people die before reproducing)."
MapPorn,3e1w2e,sivsta,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:55:23 2015 UTC,"The crux with bringing more people out of poverty, is we will be consuming more resources per person and hence, more overall."

Also even as more people are brought out of abject poverty, they don't instantly rise to the energy use and emission levels of us in the west. As we adjust and develop more sustainable technology, they'll hopefully be able to leapfrog more wasteful technology—if we don't restrain them with expensive patents, leaving only more wasteful technology legal to build.  People brought out of abject poverty and into the wealth/development segment where their birth rates stabilize consume so little compared to us that suggesting people stay in abject poverty to reduce global consumption is not only amoral, but nonsensical."

Its only in the cities where people could only have one child.

If the plural of what you're talking about is quantifiable then you use ""are."" If not, you use ""is."" So ""there are too many people"" is correct, but ""there is too much humanity"" is also correct.  In your example, the word you're directly referring to that is too large is ""amount"" which is a singular word."
MapPorn,3e1w2e,absump,0,Tue Jul 21 14:03:22 2015 UTC,"In your example, the word you're directly referring to that is too large is ""amount"" which is a singular word.   Of course.

MapPorn,3e1w2e,limukala,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:18:07 2015 UTC,"That is also incorrect.

Just like you wouldn't say ""there is 3000 kg of mangoes in that container,"" rather, you would say ""there are 3000 kg of mangoes in that container."" You could say ""there is 3000 kg of mango in that container"" without being incorrect, however.  I suppose you could make it singular if you wanted, but then you would have to use the singular form, e.g. ""there is 3000 kg of person in here,"" but that is taking artistic license with the language, and still an extremely strange construction."

But hey, wikipedia gives me a super-pedantic way out:   The Russians named the Yukon River, believing that “yuk-khana” was a Deg Xinag phrase meaning big river.[6] However, “yuk-khana” is not a Deg Xinag phrase meaning big river.[7] Probably, the Deg Hit’an borrowed the name from an upriver language and borrowed the “big river” meaning from the Central Yup’ik name.[8] Most likely, Yukon was derived from an obsolete Gwich'in word,[9] which included the concept of long water or wide water, but did not mean “big” river or “great” river.[10]"

Except for the fact that the US Geological Survey was likely explicitly restricted from providing a detailed view of US military installations, regardless of how detailed the information they had was. The Soviets, meanwhile, would have no qualms about releasing such details.  The rest of your statement may well be accurate, however.

MapPorn,3e161a,Multipoly,13,Tue Jul 21 09:24:14 2015 UTC,"MTR is allowed to own and opperate some of land arround subway stations. They put up high rise apartments, malls, and offices around stations. The land is valuable, so they can charge high rent and make a ton of money."
MapPorn,3e161a,solla_bolla,2,Tue Jul 21 09:48:15 2015 UTC,"Even without the land development, the MTR is the most profitable metro system, thanks to factors mentioned by cito-cy below."
MapPorn,3e161a,grabpot,9,Tue Jul 21 13:33:25 2015 UTC,"In addition to what solla_bolla said, Hong Kong is also extremely dense and the MTR is higher capacity than other metro systems (longer trains, shorter headways, less seating) and benefits from economies of scale since one train can carry 2500+ people with only one driver.  Stations are laid out to maximise ridership and avoid overlapping catchment areas. In Hong Kong the density of stations is less than in cities like Tokyo, New York City,  London and Paris. The MTR has only 86 stations compared to New York’s ~421.   Due to the topography of Hong Kong (mountains and sea) the city is very linear in nature and therefore works well with the linear nature of a metro system. For example, Hong Kong Island is served solely by the Island Line (which has a daily patronage of more than 1 million) because the urban development is laid out in a long and dense strip on the north shore of the island. The bulk of the HK Island population is within walking distance of this single line."

There are some things on the mountain, super rich  houses and a tourist tap mall called Victoria Peak.   The island itself is basically a narrow strip of relatively flat land to build the city on, reclaimed land into the harbour, and steep mountain slopes. If you are waking around the island only like the first couple blocks are actually flat land, the city starts almost immediately rising up with the mountain."

MapPorn,3e161a,TheOneFreeEngineer,2,Tue Jul 21 18:31:35 2015 UTC,"See I saw the lines for the cable cars up the mountain, looked at the mountain on my second day there and said to myself, hey I don't need to wait three hours, I'll just walk up... That is a rough hike up on foot. And I got lost and somehow ended up in a apartment complex at the very top of the mountain. I only found the mall when I had given up and was walking back down the mountain. I was so exhausted by then I didn't get to enjoy the mall (I was also too poor).

Also significantly less labor time--it is sort of hard to imagine now, but if you go to a more or less ""pristine"" landscape there are edible things everywhere. Even in the Kalahari desert finding enough food to live is fairly simple. Also there is greater food security--succesful agriculture depends on a fairly stable climate and collapses quickly when that changes. Foragers, on the other hand, can use a much wider variety of food sources in a given area, and if worst comes to worst are able to move to a new place. Also there is a question of distribution, as foragers are famously egalitarian and don't horde property.  Honestly just in general agriculture was a huge mistake."

Well, the nation of Panama would probably work. My off-the-cuff guess is that you'd need to move a non-trivial fraction of one or the other ocean (probably Atlantic because of coriolis?) through the gap every year in order to create a heat-pump between the oceans.  What would happen?  Well, ideally once human beings and other species got acclimated to a much warmer environment (might take a few tens to hundreds of thousands of years) we would see massive re-forestation of previously arctic areas (as was the case in the eocene) and an explosion of speciation.  Of course, this assumes that human beings don't die off (thus we get to see it) and that we don't have a population explosion of our own that precludes the above."

MapPorn,3duaae,GirlNumber20,6,Mon Jul 20 02:39:17 2015 UTC,"History would have been distorted long before the Spanish Armada happened, what point is the armada when it is connected by land after all?  I'd imagine the big divergence arrives around the time of the Romans. Britain would have been invaded earlier and the Romans may have stayed longer since Britain wasn't isolated. That's provided that Doggerland didn't become it's own empire to rival the Romans. That would have been extremely fertile and flat land.  With the fall of the Romans, the Saxons might have controlled all of Britain and Doggerland. Similarly the history of the Vikings would have been vastly different, so much for their famed sea faring.  By the time we get to 1588, Europe would look completely different politically. The British would likely never have never become a naval superpower so no British empire. The Dutch were landlocked so no navy there. The Portugese however would still have been in a perfect position to colonise. I'm sure actual historians have written up proper ""what ifs"" around this but beyond only a few years nothing we speculate is likely to be accurate at all."

MapPorn,3duaae,Zastavo,44,Sun Jul 19 17:50:48 2015 UTC,"It isn't dramatically similar (certainly as far as coastlines are concerned), but Tolkien apparently states in a number of his letters that Middle Earth is intended to be an ancient forgotten version of the European subcontinent- with certain similarities in plants and animals and climate. I don't know* if Tolkien knew much about 16,000 BCE Doggerland, but the Doggerland map certainly helps a bit in bringing the two worlds together.  From the LotR Wiki: the Hobbits' Shire might lie in the temperate climate of England, Gondor might lie in the Mediterranean Italy and Greece, Mordor in the arid Turkey and Middle East, South Gondor and Near Harad in the deserts of Northern Africa, Rhovanion in the forests of Germany and the steppes of Western and Southern Russia, and the Ice Bay of Forochel in the fjords of Norway. Far Harad may have corresponded with Southern Africa, and Rhûn corresponded with the whole of Asia.  Additionally, the mountain ranges are at least somewhat representative of those on Earth, concentrated along the southern areas corresponding to Italy and southern France and Germany, and forming a kind of circle around the Balkans (Mordor).    *EDIT: I accidentally a word."

It is as though you had no idea what the cold war borders looked like outside those areas, or didn't even look at them on the map.

A European has his own country to live in and doesn't face persecution (say if you're Dutch, for example). A religious Jew faces shouts and hate crimes living in Europe and had no country to call his home until the creation of the State of Israel.  To this day, there are ceaseless efforts by Israel's neighbours to annihilate it and today must defend itself because the Jewish people have one, very small country, one of the densest in the world, and now, for the first time in history, the Jews can protect themselves with an army to ensure the survival of Judaism in the Jewish State, which stands with arms outstretched to any Jew seeking safety in the world. This is something an American Christian takes for granted.   People think that Judaism is a major religion. There are 1.6 billion Muslims in the world, and a similar number of Christians (fewer). A lot of noise is being made about Jews for a population of 16 million worldwide. That's a thousandth of Islam."

Sure, they could choose not to, except for the fact that by choosing to not wear the clothes they would in some cases be going directly against their god and/or facing discrimination from their own community. And if no one has the right to be religious without harassment, surely it then follows that there is no universal right to the freedom from discrimination? You may say that religion is a choice and so does not impact on freedom from discrimination, but to some degree religion really isn't a choice - if you genuinely believe a religion is true, then there's no choice about it - you can hardly choose to not be religious.  I'm afraid I just don't really follow your reasoning - they're not 'displaying their clan affiliations' in order to troll (a point which you have apparently abandoned, though?), they're acting in accordance with their religion or at least avoiding disdain from their own community. Why should they not be free from harassment solely for being religious? And why would being free from that imply a terrible police state?  One final point: do you think the fact here in the UK that generally Christians can wear a crucifix without being harassed for it implies that the UK is some kind of terrible police state?"

Also keep in mind that in many points in history, it didn't matter if a Jew had converted to Christianity, Islam, or whatever religion the captors followed. The convert would still be seriously persecuted and possibly killed simply for having Jewish ancestors. For instance, in the Holocaust (a central, defining event in the Western Jewish psyche), anyone who was a quarter Jewish could be sent to the gas chambers, even if before the Nazis they had been a nun or totally irreligious.

Also what will Israel do as the Arab Israeli population keeps growing as a percentage? Or the fact that Jerusalem, even with all the housing restrictions on Arabs, is heading towards being an Arab majority city In the coming decades? What about the fact that without withdrawal from the West Bank, a one state solution is already happening?"

It's as if you choose not to say why and just lead people to think that Israel is in the wrong 100% of the time. You cannot selectively leave out history. In addition, the case with native Americans is different in the sense that a people came, non-threatened, claimed a land and murdered the indigenous.   This selective distribution of news of events is one of Israel's main problems today.   You also forget (or choose not to say) that 21% of Israel's population is Muslim, or Arab Israeli, and they live in the country enjoying the rights and benefits of an OECD country which they could never enjoy living across any border, north or south, and for thousands of miles east.   I encourage people to read about Israel's history and not rely on what has been reinforced onto them by their family and biases.

In addition, the case with native Americans is different in the sense that a people came, non-threatened, claimed a land and murdered the indigenous.   Neither the Arabs are responsible for that, It was Europeans. Why dont you take European land ? Why travel from Europe to Asia and replace the existing people ?    You also forget (or choose not to say) that 21% of Israel's population is Muslim, or Arab Israeli, and they live in the country enjoying the rights and benefits of an OECD country which they could never enjoy living across any border, north or south, and for thousands of miles east.   Really ? who are you to decide that ? you think you have reason that some how they should be ruled ? can you guarantee that a Muslim can ever be leader of Israel ?  If not they are second class citizens.    I encourage people to read about Israel's history and not rely on what has been reinforced onto them by their family and biases.

Even Marseille and Nice's départements, where crime has a historical presence since before WW2, murders are still at 2.8/100 000.   The only place obliterating these numbers are Corsica, where independendism adds murders on a well-implanted crime scene, and the overseas territories, which are thousands of kilometers away, and where social problems are numerous.   I don't have any sources, but I'm guessing Guyane sees a lot of illegal placer mining (a lot from Suriname and Brazil), hence more murders than all the rest of the overseas départements.

Do they make them in Panama and ship them to Ecuador?  Or do they make them in Ecuador and ship them to Panama?  Either way, wouldn't that make it an Ecuadoran hat?"
MapPorn,3du22v,Tutule,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:13:46 2015 UTC,"Panama hats are from Ecuador. From the Wiki:   Straw hats woven in Ecuador, like many other 19th and early 20th century South American goods, were shipped first to the Isthmus of Panama before sailing for their destinations in Asia, the rest of the Americas and Europe, subsequently acquiring a name that reflected their point of international sale, ""Panama hats"", rather than their place of domestic origin.   It's the same thing with Turkey fowls being called ""Turkey"" despite having origin in India, or other things in different languages (ie Oranges being called Portugals or some variation in other languages)   edit: I don't understand the downvote. Any ways I re-read your question. The hats are made in Ecuador and sold in Panama.  In Spanish (and English for that matter) the hats are called Sombrero panama and not Sombrero panameño (Panama hats not Panamanian hats). These are the true typical Panamanian hats which resemble other Central American typical hats."

Edit: I'll add to this... if you drive Interstate 39 south of Rockford in the middle of the night and look to the east, there's a glow in the sky and the sky is much lighter than that above you or to the west - it's the lights from Chicago lighting the sky up.

Therefore, it's cool to be able to tell where I lived on this type of map because of how Interstate highways shape the interior of the US.

Rather, it is a light rail system that will have some stops located near Metro stations. There is a chance, in my opinion a negligible one, that WMATA will operate the line.   A comment from the related article makes a good point:   Will the Purple Line appear on the Metro map? If WMATA operates it - then Yes. If WAMATA does not operate it - then No. (Maybe they'll put a logo for it, like MARC, VRE and Amtrak get). Simple as that."

There isn't the political or organizational will right now with the massive internal issues WMATA has.  But that doesn't mean it won't be added to the map.  It will be heavily integrated with Metro, connecting 4 of the lines on the outer peripheral of the system and providing WMATA with a much needed way to divert passengers when a line is plagued with a problem (like the Red Line regularly is).  It will also run with similar frequency to the Metro trains.  And the goal of the MTA currently is to allow easy transfer to Metro and hopefully use of the Smart card fare system that Metro uses.  So there are lot of good reasons for Metro to add it, unlike VRE or MARC."

The NY Subway was designed, originally, to commute people in between parts of the city, and was kept (relatively) cheap so labor could move around the city. The DC metro, however, was never meant to be used as a method of transit around town, only to get people from outside in. The Metro is closer in design to NY's LIRR or NJ's Path Train, or even BART. The metro doesn't serve the people living in DC as well as it serves the people coming in for work. If you look at a map of the Metro over an actual map of DC, you'll see how little is served, and how most stops are downtown.   But, you're right: NY could definitely use a loop train to connect Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Going through Manhattan sucks."

MapPorn,3ds6w2,axclover,-4,Sun Jul 19 00:36:39 2015 UTC,"I understand how bad the income inequality is in America, most of all new wealth created goes to the top 1%. But, I still think China's income inequality is way worse. America's population is about 300 million, China's is ~4 times that. Additionally, the market really only opened up recently there and when it did, a tiny minority of people who were friends/family of the government were allowed to take control of state owned companies, or just given better treatment. Those people have become immensely wealthy over the past three decades and their wealth continues to accumulate, so much so that now there is a new threat to China: the super rich trying to leave. You can see here about how in 2013 rich Chinese came to America using the EB-5 program, essentially paying $500,000 to obtain a visa. At  6,895 rich Chinese leaving the country, that's $3,447,500,000! But there are also the people who wanted to do that, but couldn't because of the Chinese government keeping an eye on them... or being too close to it. Lots of government workers would like to.. but can't. Look at Xi Jinping, Hu Jintao, and any other high ranking Chinese officials, all of their relatives are millionaires. There is even a town in California known as 二奶村  by the Chinese, which means... ""Mistress Village."" You can find videos on youtube about how mistresses of rich Chinese mean will go there and buy multimillion dollar houses... with CASH! Then you can also see the videos on youtube about young Chinese who are racing Bentley's, Ferrari's, Mazerati's, whatever. Then there are millions of poor Chinese who have never been on a plane or even left their little village. Eating meat is still considered a treat for these people because it is too expensive! There are a ton of poor people in China, and quite a few rich ones too. I just think it is much worse there than in America. That's all, just want to hopefully give you some more info + my view."
MapPorn,3ds6w2,marinuso,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:52:26 2015 UTC,"The USA has basically all the incredibly rich people. Compared to people like Bill Gates, Warren Buffet and the like, not even the richest Chinese come even close. Their wealth is unimaginably vast. If Bill Gates were a country, he'd be the 37th largest economy in the world. By himself.   For the USA to have a higher GINI coefficient than China, all that's needed is for the gap between America's poor and China's poor to be smaller than the gap between America's rich and China's rich. Given how incredibly rich America's rich really are, that seems possible.   There's a limit to poverty, before you starve to death. There is no limit to wealth."
MapPorn,3ds6w2,axclover,-3,Sun Jul 19 03:30:02 2015 UTC,"OK, this makes sense.

I love him and his 50% pledge or whatever it's called that he has been trying to convince others with extreme wealth to become huge philanthropists.

So for my map to be comparable, its color jump should really occur between 85% and 95%, not between 70% and 80%."
MapPorn,3dqxfl,678678678678,3,Sun Jul 19 04:52:32 2015 UTC,"How about you make <10% completely white, 10% to 30% almost white, 30% to 60% medium and >60% strong?  I mean surely there's a compromise to be made here."
MapPorn,3dqxfl,toms_face,3,Sun Jul 19 06:02:13 2015 UTC,"I wasn't trying to present an ""ideal"" map, just show how skewed the original one was.  And skew isn't necessarily a bad thing.  The appropriate color scale really depends on what you're trying to illustrate.  If you want to highlight the small Francophone communities in Western Canada, then the original map does a good job of that.  If you want to convince people that the French language is endangered in Canada, then the second map would work better.  For a general overview of Francophone prevalence throughout Canada, I'd probably do something like this."
MapPorn,3dqxfl,678678678678,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:40:00 2015 UTC,"Valid qualification, and we can pause to remember visual data always has an agenda.  The illustration of francophone minorities and francophone non-homogeneity are both interesting and politically relevant.   But since the minorities are thinly distributed outside Quebec, a low threshold is needed to make the map work."
MapPorn,3dqxfl,experimentalshoes,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:33:59 2015 UTC,"since the minorities are thinly distributed outside Quebec, a low threshold is needed to make the map work.   I'd agree that the map ""works"" if its primary goal was to illustrate which parts of Saskatchewan are 1% versus 2%.  The low threshold does a great job of showing that.  But because 30% looks just like 90%, I'd say it fails to ""work"" as a general overview map of Francophones in Canada."
MapPorn,3dqxfl,678678678678,9,Mon Jul 20 04:37:33 2015 UTC,Something like a quarter of New Brunswick are native French speakers. And IIRC they speak a slightly different dialect than the Québécois.
MapPorn,3dqxfl,neil_before_scrodd,8,Sat Jul 18 19:58:49 2015 UTC,"Every region has a slightly different dialect tbh, even different regions of Québec. Acadians(New-Brunswick francophones and other maritime francophones) typically throw in alot of english words in french sentences."
MapPorn,3dqxfl,nicktheman2,3,Sat Jul 18 22:09:51 2015 UTC,"I did the Explore program at Universite Sainte-Anne is Nova Scotia one summer. They taught us ""international"" French, but the teachers also went over the differences in Acadian French."
MapPorn,3dqxfl,cooliomcknight,2,Sun Jul 19 00:41:00 2015 UTC,Some of the Acadian dialect today comes from the spoken dialect in France from the 1600s.
MapPorn,3dqxfl,TipmanSpike,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:01:34 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair, most of the areas outside of Quebec that have significant French Populations (Northern Ontario, Northern New Brunswick, Southeastern Manitoba) are not very density populated."

MapPorn,3dqxfl,mutantlid,2,Sat Jul 18 20:15:40 2015 UTC,Why would they use three different shades for a difference of ten percent? (unless I'm reading the legend wrong- on mobile)
MapPorn,3dqxfl,TheIrelephant,4,Sat Jul 18 20:24:35 2015 UTC,"My guess would be that the ranges are made as a percentage of the data, rather than round number percentages.  For example, it's likely that 25% of the regions fall within 0-4% range, another 25% in 4-9% range, 25% in the 9-31% range, and 25% fall in the 31-93% range.  This way, you get ranges that are more representative of the specific data set you are visualizing.  The trade off is that the data divides into very precise ranges (0-4%), and conversely, broad ranges (31-93%)."

MapPorn,3dqxfl,correcthorse45,28,Sat Jul 18 20:41:16 2015 UTC,"Even weirder is the fact that this (your situation) is not the norm for the world.  In Europe, there might be places minutes away that speak a different language"

MapPorn,3dqxfl,correcthorse45,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:06:24 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say Strange as much as it was a development spurred by a necessity to communicate with one another over the vast distances that the US is. It's a good thing if people from the equivalent distances of Lisbon to Moscow (LA to NYC) can talk to each other without issue.
MapPorn,3dqxfl,Kestyr,4,Sun Jul 19 05:56:39 2015 UTC,"We reeducated an entire generation back in the early 20th century to speak English. German and various native tongues were very prevalent before then (and Spanish and French in certain areas). Less than English speakers, but there were quite a few pockets where English wasn't spoken."
MapPorn,3dqxfl,RsonW,3,Sun Jul 19 07:34:35 2015 UTC,"Yep. Basically the middle of the country between the Rockies and the Appalachians were German and Scandinavian, while the West and East coast were settled a lot by Anglo and Irish stock. As they were in the middle of those two, it was only a matter of when it would happen, it was gradually happening up to WW1, then it intensified with the two world wars happening in short succession."
MapPorn,3dqxfl,Kestyr,8,Sun Jul 19 07:36:41 2015 UTC,"If you think about it, the city of Detroit was originally French, and so were many of the cities in that area. In Ontario, the city of Sault-Sainte-Marie also still has a French name, while some others changed name (Sainte-Anne-des-Pins was renamed to Sudbury). Some communities in the area have remained francophone ever since!"

Also, in Europe you can't be within an hour of both Paris and London unless you have a private jet.
