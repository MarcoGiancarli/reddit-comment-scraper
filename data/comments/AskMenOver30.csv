AskMenOver30,3e0ux7,sfca,7,Tue Jul 21 02:24:29 2015 UTC,"If I give each date a score on the ol' 10 scale.....  Evening Movie:  8/10.  Would be perfect except for the actual movie.  Recommend sitting in back so if the movie sucks you just get up and go for a nice walk in the park.  Comedy:  6/10.  Could be fun, but bars are noisy and it's tough to have a decent conversation in them.  Add to that the possibility of shitty comics and I can't go over 6.  Poetry:  1/10.  I give it that one point only because somebody must like such things or they wouldn't exist."

Worst case scenario, you get to drink wine in public in a park and then go for a walk.  Who knows, maybe you'll discover a new love of mocking movies under your breath together (if you sit far enough away from other folks).  ""We'll go, we'll drink wine, we'll chat.  We'll enjoy a movie.  Or we'll mock the hell out of a cheesy romcom.  Or if it's too terrible to mock, we'll drink wine and go for a walk in the park.""  Sounds like a great date to me!"

At this point, I can admit that I was straight up cruel to her and said/did some harsh things in an attempt to get her to go away. She just pestered me, trying to talk to me via Skype and explain how she was feeling.   Before you were ever cruel and intentionally mean to someone you knew that was suffering from depression why didnt you block all forms of communication from her (skype, phone etc). You choose to lash out at her.   She sounds clingy and bothersome but youre purposefully cruel which is MUCH MUCH WORSE. I dont know if you just liked the attention you were getting and enjoyed feeling ""wanted"" but your actions are manipulative.   Where to go next?

Boo hoo my daddy talked mean to me isn't an excuse to be an asshole. My parents were very abusive, too - physically, emotionally, verbally. I never used that as an excuse to manipulate people. I just left at 17 when they weren't looking and cut off my relationship with them.   Eh - that was a very long time ago now - likely before you were born. I'm not sure how old she is, but y'all sound very young.   Whatever her deal is, if you don't want to talk to her, just stop talking to her. You don't owe her anything, do you? Making people feel like they owe you their time and sympathy or whatever is manipulation. It's classic textbook manipulation.   Some people aren't content unless they're miserable.

If you think she's truly depressed then don't block her or tell her to go away or any of that, at least not yet. I think that's just about the worst thing you could do. She feels rejected as it is and you may currently be the only outlet she has.  You've been patient and honest and respectful to yourself and your girlfriend, which is all good. Very good. There is no reason why you should allow yourself to be burdened by this, but in the grand scheme of things, this is not a true burden. If you think it is then you've got some serious life challenges ahead of you.   I agree that you should suggest she seek professional help. I agree that you should be honest and explain how awkward the situation is.  I agree that you should remind her of her positive traits. I agree that you should stop reaching out to her. Where I differ is that I think you should continue allowing her to contact you and just listen when she needs it and patiently keep telling her the same honest truth (all the things mentioned above) every time she contacts you. Eventually she will move on.   If at some point she seems to be taking advantage or becomes manipulative then it would be time to consider blocking her, but, when you do, be VERY clear about why.   We are difficult people to work with. I know your struggle. I personally appreciate you asking for advice. Just be a little more patient. Good luck."

Learn a damn good lesson from this, to start with.  When you see a crazy woman, whether in your personal life or in the business sphere, walk away immediately.  Case in point: I just was approached by a woman who recently graduated from an Ivy League school with respect to a position at my company.  Her resume was quite impressive.  However, within five minutes of meeting her, I realized she was also nothing but trouble, despite her academic achievements.  I knew women like her back when I was in college.

Then what good is any of that if I wasn't spending time chasing ladies. There's other stuff like grad school but you get the idea. Gaming gets in the way of that.
AskMenOver30,3dw90n,Lilcheeks,5,Mon Jul 20 12:41:24 2015 UTC,So you filled up on healthy food and didn't have time for filler.
AskMenOver30,3dw90n,cyanocobalamin,3,Mon Jul 20 13:04:47 2015 UTC,"You could say that.   I mean, if I really wanted to play a game I could find a way. Every once in awhile I see a PC game that looks interesting but I never really bother because I know I wont give it the time to make it through. Last few games I played I never finished."
AskMenOver30,3dw90n,Lilcheeks,10,Mon Jul 20 13:10:25 2015 UTC,"Definitely a 30+ gamer here.  My first suggestion is that if you're playing modern online competitive games, stop.  Games like League of Legends are packed with angry, foul-mouthed teenagers, and no one should have to endure that after a certain age.  Cut the negativity out (if you're playing online games at all), and you'll be a lot happier.  As for what you should play?  Hell, play retro games!  YouTube celebrities like the Angry Video Game Nerd and Game Grumps have made the games we grew up on wildly popular again.  Download an NES or SNES emulator and replay all the games you enjoyed, or try the games that your local Blockbuster never carried.  There are some good new retro-style games as well.  If 2D platformers are your thing, check out Shovel Knight, Cave Story, or Rogue Legacy.  Braid is good but ridiculously hard.  Make no mistake, 8- and 16-bit style games are in fashion right now.  Indulge in them!"

If something looks interesting, I'll put it on a wishlist and wait for it to go on sale rather than buy it right away. And if it doesn't really grab me in the first hour or so, I'll move on to something else. I also find that I'm more interested in games from smaller studios than the major titles these days."

I've been trying really hard to get into Witcher but TBH it's just annoying me to no end.  On the other hand Last of Us and Dying Light had me extremely anxious to end my day so I could play more.

Reddit Dads  Awesome group to play with, no pressure about you have to play at certain times.  Very low key and accepting.    Our rules include ""Don't be a douchebag"" and ""Defend your fellow gamer to the death.""    I've never liked online games before, but since finding this crew I have something I never knew mattered in a game before, companionship.  They are an amazing group of guys (and some women too) who just want to play within the confines of our busy schedules.  I love playing games with my daughter, but it isn't the same because a lot of it is assisting her instead of playing.  She enjoys it it, but also wants time to play herself.  This is one of the reasons we are turning our spare bedroom into a mini den for her.  She will get my old PS3, my working Nintendo 8-bit, and a fold out couch in case company comes over.  If you are looking for a game that gets you outside, try Ingress.  Like geocaching and capture the flag combined."

The thing for me was that gaming and reading aren't the same, when I'd game I was kind of building something, making something - even just grinding gave some sense of achievement. The next sword, the next skill point, whatever. Reading is more like advanced TV, everything is already made for you and you just have to consume it. Gaming felt more interactive.   So I replaced it with more interactive hobbies, Lego or erector sets with the kid, go-kart engines and horribly-ugly-so-far welds when I get some time alone. It gives me that same sense of completion that gaming used to - and honestly I just think that's part of life's progression.  I'll probably never stop gaming entirely but it is no longer a priority. It's a rainy-day hobby, something I'll do when I can't really do anything else."

AskMenOver30,3dw90n,lespritdelescalier11,2,Mon Jul 20 03:54:47 2015 UTC,"30 plus gamer here. Used to game semi-competitively.  In my mid to late 20s, I knew most of what there was to know about games at that time. I even got to the point where I was selling games online for a second income. I played games before work in the morning, and I played them when I got home. I got very sick, and all I did was lie on the couch and play games.  Shortly after I turned 30, I was feeling well enough to return to work, and my gaming obsession began to wane. I took up sports instead. I barely gamed at all for several years. Part of it was that I realized my body wasn't going to last forever, so I should get out there and be active while I could, but part of it was that I just needed something new.  I'm 34 now, and I balance gaming, sports, and my personal life. Most people who meet me wouldn't necessarily think that I'm a gamer. I don't really talk about it anymore unless amongst those who game frequently.  If it's the wrong time, don't fight it. Maybe you're just growing out of it. Maybe it's just a phase. I know you want to share gaming with others, but you can't force yourself to like something you don't."
AskMenOver30,3dw90n,Inigo93,2,Mon Jul 20 04:13:10 2015 UTC,"I was a gamer until I became a dad.  At that point I had more important things to do with a baby in the house and such.  Then the kid got older and he became way more of a gamer than I ever dreamed of.  But his taste in games was way different than mine.  Try as I might, it was very difficult to find a game that we both liked.  So... I pretty much dropped out of gaming and let him rule the console.    He went off to college two weeks ago.  It's been so long... Honestly, I have no desire to go back to gaming."

There are some more modern Monkey Island games on Steam right now.  If you're ok going retro, the Space Quest games were hilarious back in the day.

I much prefer in-depth strategy and the long play vs. the twitchy deathmatches of my youth.  I fully expect to be gaming in some form until I'm dead of old age.  I think it is quite likely that you just don't like what you used to, and you're afraid that's reflective of the hobby as a whole.  It concerns me that you feel the need to qualify your question as a lame topic.  There is nothing lame about games, nor is there any shame in liking them!  As an aside, and nothing to do about gaming, but if you feel you're in a rut, and that things that used to give you pleasure no longer do- these are both symptoms of depression.  As you mention you have anxiety and ADHD I imagine you already spend more time than you'd like taking to doctors, but it may be worth your time talking to one about how you currently feel.  They can help."
AskMenOver30,3dw90n,Charlie-Green-Rug,3,Mon Jul 20 06:31:17 2015 UTC,"I think the important thing is to let your passions inform your actions, not the other way around.  So don't play a game just becuase it's a game. Play it because it's related to something you love. My favourite games are hardly considered brilliant games. X Wing & TIE Fighter, Star Wars Battlefront, Dawn of War 1 and 2, Total War... there's not much else I keep coming back to. Skyrim sucked up a lot of my time but I've pretty much played that world out now, same with Fallout.  I play these games not because they're popular, new or generally thought of as good. I play them because I love Star Wars, medieval history and tabletop wargaming. I keep coming back to these games and games like them because they feed an interest in me. I would never play a generic FPS like call of duty, nor do games like the GTA series have any attraction for me.  Just playing games for it's own sake is going to leave you feeling bored and listless because there is no passion there to grab you."
AskMenOver30,3dw90n,GasStationCoffee,2,Mon Jul 20 06:55:44 2015 UTC,"I miss it, but I've changed. I don't miss the same things.  In my 20's, I wanted the escape from my depressing, boring reality. I chose WoW.  It helped me avoid dealing with my floundering marriage, my terrible emotional skills and existential crisis wondering what I was doing with my education and career.  I made some good friends, I kept some old ones, so it wasn't all bad, but I can't do that anymore.  My work ethic has changed since then.  I still play games, but I play them in their place. I play them when I need a different form of stimulation or I need to relax. I play them to bond with my kids. I play them to pass the time when I'm taking a dump.  I don't plan 40 man raids and spend hours collecting consumables.  I don't need to be server first, getting the purple-est of pixels and dealing with guild drama over who gets the glowy, epic sword.   It's a change in priorities. Gaming still has a very strong place in my life, but it's not everything. I'm not a gamer who is named GasStationCoffee.  I'm GasStationCoffee who has many hobbies, including gaming."
AskMenOver30,3dw90n,ItsGotToMakeSense,2,Mon Jul 20 14:16:27 2015 UTC,"I've lost some, but not all interest. I used to be a fairly hardcore completionist who would devote 6 to 12 hours a day to some games and felt a genuine sense of fulfillment when I accomplished something difficult in a game.    But now I've grown up and have a family and responsibilities, and a new set of priorities and perspectives. In short, games don't matter as much as real life to me anymore. Maybe this is because I get my sense of accomplishment from my real life now, so in-game achievements don't feel as fulfilling.    As a result I tend to play shorter games and with less commitment to them. I play for fun only, and if they stop being fun then I stop playing."

Numerous online gaming communities are just toxic and not fun to be around. I don't like the fact that games these days are DLC driven. I don't mind DLC itself but I hate when games that cost $60 out of the box have a pay to win mode where those who have lots of disposable income (or someone else's) and time are able to excel at. Don't even get me started on how difficult it takes these days to learn some game controls.  Two things I love since I started to game since the late 80's are the improved graphics and the ability digitally download games so I never have to set foot in a gamestop."

I think that really wore me out mentally over the years. No sure when I last truly enjoyed WoW and wasnt just making myself busy with it.  portal/portal2 - I think portal and portal2 kinda ruined other games for me, it was the last two games I truly enjoyed and simply could not stop playing until I was finished, then HAD to do coop, then devoured some of the fan-made maps (there aren't enough good ones). Now all other games seem incredibly boring and same-shit, the same old two or three mainstream concepts rehashed over and over and over again...  Also dont have many gamer friends anymore due to different job and some of my older friends marrying and having kids and I moved and freaked out over how much time I had wasted in games, especially WoW. So I uninstalled everything, started taking guitar lessons and founded a band, we just launched an EP on iTunes. Plus I am happier going out these days, meeting international people and when Im home I just prefer to watch good tv shows or movies.  Dont know how to rekindle my love for games again... I used to looooooovvvvee QuakeWorld and UT99 and in-house wc3 DotA games, then portal and portal2 and the last game I obsessed over was Stick of Truth.

Do you think your tastes may be maturing, as others have mentioned, rather than declining, and are there perhaps types of games that you've not tried because you previously thought them ""boring""?  Have you considered the simulation genre (Euro Truck Simulator, for example)? Those games can be very satisfying to older people, but tend to be too slow-paced for young 'uns and without the quick gratification they need.

AskMenOver30,3dw90n,cyanocobalamin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:07:55 2015 UTC,"I've also tried substituting with reading to no avail.   I've read a number of articles ( and experienced this myself ) that my capacity for reading for long amounts of time has gone down since the internet and other kinds of electronic stuff.  The articles were clinical studies, but one included an anecdote by a book publisher.  Everyone was able to improve their capacity to read for significant amounts of time by reduce internet use, reducing things like video games and gradually building up their reading times, almost like weight training.   I want to be a good dad but my anxiety and ADHD makes things difficult at times.   What children see their parents do has a much stronger influence on them than what their parents say.  You have the right idea in thinking about moving toward reading as a hobby.  Vigorous cardio has  been show to help with ADHD, a lot ( anxiety too ).  There was a video game called ""dance dance revolution"" where people have to do simple dance moves.  I read an article about a gamer who lost 70lbs doing it.  That is how much exercise it can give you.  Have you also thought about getting your anxiety treated?  Shrinks had different educations and talents.  Their personalities matter too.  Experience with your particular problem helps too.  If the first one you try doesn't work well after a good try, try another one.  The great cognitive therapy author Dr. Burns made an anxiety self help book called ""When Panic Attacks"".  It could be a good adjunct.  Good Luck, you are changing in a positive way.

I just spend almost 3K on two video cards and a monitor for my computer hoping that I would be a bit more inspired to play the many games I have, and still honestly find myself in a rut.  Although, I seem to have stopped enjoying all of my hobbies, not just gaming, and I can't seem to find anything I really like to replace them.

I've found that sometimes you need to do other things. Explore the world around you.   Personally I collect succulents, cacti and tropical plants (maybe not the best hobby with a 5 year old around). I have also taken an interest in IRL blacksmithing. I have chickens and a couple dogs. Flower beds.   Gaming is great in the winter, but during the summer there's lots of stuff to do outside and I hate wasting it.  Expand your horizons."

Over the subsequent years my wife and I continued to play board games together some evenings after the kid went to bed and that was much more enjoyable than playing something by myself on my PC. My daughter is 5 now and she enjoys playing some of my old Wii games as well as board games. I also plan on introducing her to tabletop RPGs when she gets a bit older. If it's something you want to continue you might try looking at some of the Gamewright games for younger kids. We have a copy of Hiss and Feed the Kitty that have just enough complexity to keep me interested while still being simple enough for a 5 year old."

The industry as a whole just seems to me to go really down hill. Owning a PS4, I look at the offerings that are out there and they don't at all feel fresh or new, but more of the same, with the same story, same 'go-fetch' tasks and the same mechanics.  Add in the overall decline in quality of releases and the subscription model for content and it just me underwhelmed.   Staying up late to play a game just isn't worth being tired in the morning when my kids are up at the crack of dawn in the morning. Games require quite an investment of grind to stay current with your friends or clans, so sitting down for 30 minutes (about the most amount of free time I have in a weekday) just isn't enough to keep up and I'd find myself playing way more meaning I was tired all of the time.

For me, a big part of not getting bored with gaming was ditching video games altogether. Video games, even ones with detailed storylines, just became more of a time waster than a contributor to my life. I haven't played video games since my early 20s, and based on what I've seen on the market over that period, I don't think I've missed out on much.  I still play 1st edition D&D, but it's hard to keep a group together and maintain the commitments when everyone is very busy, and it's hard to assemble the right group of people who can focus instead of screwing off. These days, most of my gaming is strategy board games which are good for a one-night gathering of adults who are willing and able to devote the mental energy, and it's more conducive to a mixed-group of people (making sure significant others can be included)."

I'm guessing that's largely a result of the reddit demo, but I went back and reread your post twice, and you don't mention anywhere what type of games you're referring to- PC, console, board, RPG, or CCG.  It reads to me like you mean board games or pen-and-paper RPGs, but maybe that's just my own experience talking.   I've played all of these at one time or another, and I miss them too.  I'm mostly just too busy, too tired, and it can be difficult to find other, like-minded adults to play with (I'm referring here to pretty much any of these besides the video games).  The good news is: if you miss it, and have time to pursue it, there are tons of great new games out, and ways to connect with people with whom to play them.   Check out /r/boardgames, /r/rpg, and find gamers on sites like Meetup.  Good luck!"

I play less hours per week, but i drink for less hours a week too. Free time has gone down across the board, so i wouldn't say it is just gaming.   I find myself doing it out of feeling the need to more than actually wanting to.   Get a new hobby. Don't do it due to obligation. You will end up quitting."
AskMenOver30,3dw90n,Evsie,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:57:54 2015 UTC,"I do it a lot less than I used to, and I never play online (because I'm not good enough for it to be worthwhile, and don't have the time to put in to get better). I used to put a LOT of hours into a text based mmorpg, I gave that up years ago, it's just not worth the time. I have work, kids, a home... 40+ hours a week on a game just isn't realistic any more and it wasn't the kind of game you can just dip in and out of.  I still have a play with my daughter from time to time, but that is about me playing with her, it's not about the gaming. If you have outgrown your hobby that's perfectly fine, go find a new one.   You're not losing a part of yourself, you're just realising that games are just another form of entertainment. It's now ""shall I play Batman for a couple of hours or stick a movie on?"" rather than the primary source of entertainment.   What I would say is this: Find a new hobby. It doesn't matter if that's learning a new skill, reading, movies, music, cooking, whatever you find that floats your boat, otherwise you can get stuck in a loop of work and kids and work and kids with nothing to break the monotony and give you pleasure (let's not pretend that being a parent is all fun and games).   You're more than the hobbies you pursue, so don't worry so much about stopping one or two of them. Actually I'd go further than that, I'd say that for the vast majority of people if you're  still enjoying the same things in your 30s as you did as a teenager you either got very lucky young or something's not quite right. I expect my hobbies and interests to continue to change throughout my life as I experience more and more stuff along the way... that just seems healthy to me."

These build innumerable qualities for developing 5-year-old brains, and are great bonding time. Let them build whatever they want, let their imaginations run wild.  I suggest this, because, with a little patience, you can add a gaming aspect to it. We used to use Legos to build our worlds for a Dungeons and Dragons-style game. Be the game master, set aside an area for their 'inventory' and each new area you go into, you both get to build. It's not so much about winning or losing, it's about building a great story and experience with contributions from you and your kiddo. You can follow the DnD rules, with more elaborate settings, or make up your own quest, write it down and make it like a visualized choose-your-own-adventure books. After a few games, have your kid be the game master, let him control the world and provide a story for your character.  This may not be exactly what you want, but it's something we really enjoyed as kids, and is something I expect to play with mine."

AskMenOver30,3dwum9,Jobcv314,8,Mon Jul 20 05:08:30 2015 UTC,"First, the obedient comment bothers me. Even if he thinks it, why say it? That's weirdly controlling IMO. But that wasn't your question.  To your question. Yes, I would ""date"" someone I don't have feelings for at first. Because you don't often develop strong feelings until time passes. Two months could be enough time however you have a distance issue so it may take more time. Who ""dates"" someone they love already? You have to date them to know them well enough. But the concept of dating isn't one I participate in, or at least haven't yet. I've only had a few relationships an each lasted a few years. An each began as a friendship. After a whole it was obvious something was there so we hung out to know each other better as friends. Then things sort of went from there. Maybe some people would call that dating I dunno. I don't though. Unless he's playing you, and only time will tell (by him somehow closing that distance gap for example in the next few months, as you seem to imply he tried to do that emotionally I assume by calling, texting ect). If he's on the level then yes a person can encounter in life a person who has the qualities he's looking for, and then want  to see if there's more there as time goes by. You're kind of at the early stage though where you're both evaluating as far as I'm concerned. And it sounds like you're doubting his sincerity. If he lived ten minutes away I think you'd have less issues. Maybe consider whether he's going to truly close that distance gap for real eventually. It's be wrong to assume he will so soon because you only have two months history. But if within four months he has no plan then I'd say he's either playing you or he's just a dreamer who has no intention or ability to ever be closer in distance. And then you'll know he's a waste of time. Empty promises are always a sign of a person who just wastes your time."

Would I seriously date a woman who I don't really have feelings for, but she matches all the criteria for a woman you will want to marry?  ... Yes... but only for a handful of dates.  The developing of feelings thing isn't always ""wham-o"" quick, so if someone on paper was an awesome I'd hang in there a little bit before I saw it wasn't working.  2 months is a little long.  Personally I'd pull the plug after only 3-4 dates.    Honestly it sounds like you're the one who doesn't have feelings for him and I can't tell if it's a cultural thing or not from your post.  I'm not sure what you are expecting but somehow he isnt' living up to your expectations.  If you're not happy, find someone else to date.  If you are happy, talk with him and give him a chance.

I can go for up to 90 days on a vacation and hope to stay 10-12 weeks while working remotely minimal hours to pay for the trip.

AskMenOver30,3dserr,Inigo93,6,Sun Jul 19 03:41:32 2015 UTC,"My second anniversary with the wife is the 10th of august.  The first anniversary was pretty bad, we went out to dinner and had a whole night planned that promptly got cancelled when my mother called (she was the babysitter of our two kids aged 6months and 2,5 yrs). She couldn't handle putting them to bed.  This year I think we got plan something where we travel far away so quitting is not an option... But that's also scary."
AskMenOver30,3dserr,Skjalg,8,Sun Jul 19 09:28:10 2015 UTC,"First year with my now wife.   Big surprise mystery weekend planned. I'd told her to keep it free for both days. We were living together at that stage so I wanted to do something totally unexpected,  and I booked a mystery weekend pack - you know, you pay for a flight / hotel pack without knowing where you're going. Just turn up at the airport with clothes.   Two days before we're due to leave and she emails me saying 'hey are you cool to catch up with [ex-one-night-stand-from-her-past-that-she-moved-countries-to-avoid-having-to-deal-with-drama] and his friends for dinner this Saturday? It's just him staying at our place though, probably Friday and Saturday nights? He's invited us to drinks on Friday as well.'   Errrr...what? You want to know if it's cool to scrap our first anniversary plans just so your ex - who I've never met - can stay at our house, including heading out for drinks a couple of nights in a row?   Some tense discussion later, the travel plans are shelved but so are the visit plans with her ex. She just...didn't think. At all. Completely on the oblivious mindset of someone secure in their relationship where things are going well - 'of course my boyfriend would be fine with it, why wouldn't he be? We're great as a couple!'   I was supremely pissed, primarily about the lack of consideration and secondarily that my extravagant, spontaneous gesture got completely rubbed out.   Anyhoo. That was 10 years ago. Married, kids, etc.  Long term afterthought outcome - this year, the other dude in the story got his stupid ass blind drunk at a friends wedding and spilled to a mutual friend that the act was his 'do or die, wedding singer' moment - he fully intended it to be the glorious union of two soul mates and was sorely disappointed at the outcome. (He then propositioned the matron of honour in front of her husband and was ejected from the premises while his own poor wife was comforted by my wife. Life is hilariously complicated. )   Edit - phone autocorrects"

AskMenOver30,3dril4,dmasterdyne,7,Sat Jul 18 19:30:19 2015 UTC,"I bet most of the posters (myself included) on this sub can relate. You have a degree, and in medicine, so thats a great achievement in itself. I think much unhappiness comes come from comparing ourselves to others. There are always going to be people that have it better or worse than you. Always.   I think we're also in a new era, where the old ways of looking at traditional life stages (in western culture) is no longer the precedent nor standard. Im 32, all of my good friends are educated BA/BS+ , and about half are married with kids, and the other half are putting kids on hold and are pursuing other endeavors.  To my parents generation that seems crazy. I don't think it's right, or relevant, to compare my ideas of success to some past generational standards, but it's something i cant deny that i see all around me. Sociocultural change happens gradually, we're all trying to figure things out on spaceship earth, you're not alone in the way you feel, may your best days be ahead of you."
AskMenOver30,3dril4,sockpuppettherapy,5,Sat Jul 18 20:14:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know what you mean about comparing yourself to others. It's just hard sometimes when it feels like everyone else has things figured out and has a plan they're already putting in practice, when you don't feel that way. But you're right about the old ideas of success not being that relevant anymore. In my parents' generation, you'd finish college/university, get a job with a company, and stay there until you retire. Meanwhile, you'd marry and have kids, the whole deal. Nowadays I don't think that model is as relevant anymore."
AskMenOver30,3dril4,sockpuppettherapy,2,Sat Jul 18 20:52:46 2015 UTC,"Life has seemed shallow and pointless for a while now.   What things do you personally value?  As in, what kinds of things do you hold to be important in your life?  I think most people quantify their happiness by the ""things"" they have.  And you partly do this in your post (not having things is, apparently, what makes you unhappy).  And when you do that, it makes everything shallow.  I've seen people in their 20s and 30s start to feel this way, where it appears as if they're trying to check off things in life that they should be hitting, and that such things should make you happy.  Advanced degrees, family, children, taking trips, drinking, number of women you've slept with, etc.   But the things mean nothing, hold no value in and of themselves.  It's the personal context that makes it worth something.  Personally, I find most enjoyment in the trip to most things.  It's not the degree that matters to me, it's what you can do with it to get to an ultimate goal (personal business).  It's not the number of places you go, but what you personally get out of the actual experience.  It's not that you have a family or girlfriend or whatnot, but that there's an emotional center you can return towards and build with a lucky other individual.  I'm a scientist by profession.  The PhD itself doesn't matter; it doesn't get me free plane rides or some renowned recognition.  But it does give me opportunities to do research on things that I, personally, am interested in learning.  That might seem overly simplistic, but... yeah, I'm a simple person.  If life's boring, maybe it's time to slow down a bit and enjoy it a little.  Maybe start thinking about projects or ideas that you'd like to achieve and build on your own, get yourself out of your comfort zone."
AskMenOver30,3dril4,mechtonia,2,Sat Jul 18 20:54:18 2015 UTC,"And you partly do this in your post (not having things is, apparently, what makes you unhappy).   Not at all. I'm not sure what part of my post suggested that, but it's not things I lack. It's the feeling of life having meaning and value.   But the things mean nothing, hold no value in and of themselves. It's the personal context that makes it worth something.   Yes, I agree with that."
AskMenOver30,3dril4,blu3dice,2,Sat Jul 18 20:59:24 2015 UTC,"Not at all. I'm not sure what part of my post suggested that, but it's not things I lack. It's the feeling of life having meaning and value.   You said so yourself:   While most of my friends are already married with children, have careers, etc., I'm still alone, and after a recent breakup realized I've never had a truly long-term relationship. I have a medical degree but I'm starting to become bored/disappointed with the profession and can't help but wonder if I made a mistake not picking something else, like computer science.   Each of the things you've mentioned in that list of things is just that: a list of things.  You're not saying that you want a family because you'd like to have emotional stability.  You're not saying that you dislike the medical profession because it's grueling and not giving you enough personal time.  You're saying you're bored.  It frankly sounds like notches and achievements that should make you happy but really haven't.  If you feel like things are very shallow, then perhaps you yourself are a bit shallow in terms of what exactly you want or how you want it.  That's not meant to be a criticism; some people like that sort of thing.  If you're just compiling shit together because, well, that's life and you should do those things, then yes, that's pretty shallow.  And if that's what you do not like and want more, then perhaps it's time to re-evaluate the types of things you do want."
AskMenOver30,3dril4,lolexecs,2,Sat Jul 18 21:07:36 2015 UTC,"Read about Survivorship Bias.  We are inundated with stories of passionate, successful people but we never hear about the guys with the same drive, the same talents, and the same methods that just happened to miss a few lucky breaks and end up living an unremarkable life.  Comparison is the thief of joy.  It sound cliche but I just try to be a little better version of myself each day, to learn something new, be in a little better shape, or accomplish something new.

The great majority of adults in the world dont have this type of restlessness. You dont struggle or want for anything. You're not the woman who walks for hours each day just to retrieve clean drinking water for her family or livestock. Or the man I read about recently in Detroit that works at a minimum wage job and spends up to six hours a day walking and taking public transportation just to get to and from work. When everyday is just about survival -- food, water, housing, safety etc, boredom doesnt exist.    Challenge yourself to make a change. If computer science interests you take a class this fall. Not everybody has some great passion yet to be discovered. Accept your privileged position in life and enjoy it, give to others and or make changes in your life that brings about something new and meaningful. And it doesnt have to be something big and grandiose either. I know someone that started volunteering for a program that finds, fixes and donates bikes to low-income families with children. But the changes to him spiritually were profound. You can do the same. Make your existence matter to someone else and it'll mean more to you as well. I hope this ramble made sense, best of luck."

You're still seeing your ""motivation / drive"" as something external to you that you discover.  You want to be given this from someone. You want less freedom. You are, in the most literal and objective way, asking for someone to come along and tell you exactly what the meaning of your life is.  But nobody will. Nobody gives a fuck about you. Not even your own mother. Not your girlfriend, not your children, not your grandparents, not your best friend.  You have to create your own meaning.   people who had some great business idea   Look at the word ""had"". They ""had"" an idea. Like it was something thrust upon them externally, like they ""had"" cancer. They ""had"" an inheritance. The truth is, they didn't ""had"" anything. There is no ""had"". In fact, there is no such thing as an idea.  Ideas do not exist.  What they did do, is they let go of their sense of self. They created a sense of meaning. They started being aware, and they just did stuff. The ""success"" or the ""millions"" were a side effect that probably didn't even matter to them."

AskMenOver30,3dl2kw,sockpuppettherapy,17,Fri Jul 17 13:11:21 2015 UTC,I think teenagers and college age kids have always been worried about trivial things.  I wish I still had time to fill my mind up with meaning behind song lyrics and theories about what motivates video game characters.
AskMenOver30,3dl2kw,drunkadvice,3,Fri Jul 17 03:40:12 2015 UTC,What's surprising to me is that this has spread to the early-20 something crowd.  Maybe partly to do with fast information and a desire to belong in a world where things don't last anymore?
AskMenOver30,3dl2kw,sockpuppettherapy,2,Sat Jul 18 16:57:32 2015 UTC,I attribute it to delayed adulthood.  Early 20 somethings doesn't mean getting married and starting your adult life anymore.  Lots of them are still in school or moving back home.  Parents take on all of the responsibility and shield kids from it.  They need to occupy their minds with something.  Part of me is jealous.  But most of me is happy that I'm past all that.  I've never understood pokemon and pogs and I like it that way.

I have enough friends and know enough people to know that they don't choose to be home; it's simply unaffordable for most people, given the amount of debt.  Maybe that's different now than when I was 25, though.  The superficiality and selfishness is really what bothers me the most.

The difference is that the younger 20 somethings in 2005 were far less likely to have access to a platform like Reddit to vent about it.

I myself lived in Croatia, Germany and England and anywhere I meet American exchange students they are openminded and easygoing about casual sex and drug use. That is what I see in your TV and movies, people are sex positive and it is not taboo? Maybe that is not a good representation, I also have a gay childhood friend from Croatia and after he moved to California he said life there is better for him, he does not have to hide his personal relationship from people at work or pretend he is not gay."

Not scream, just roll my eyes. :)  Not their problems, but their attitudes.  I remember how I felt, some of mindsets I had at younger ages.  I remember how big some problems looked though they turned out to be nothing.  I respect their feelings of distress given the context of where they are in their lives.  It is their attitude, acting like they know something when they don't, acting like they discovered something revolutionarily new when they didn't ( been, done that, watched it rust away back into the dust, and so did the other 6 billion people who came before you ) that causes me to roll my eyes."

I kept my bag of fucks locked up in my safe at home. (might make a meta post about it later)  I enjoy the perspective, back in the days when I gave my fucks out like candy.  It's nice to sit back a read about my younger thoughtless self, and all the stupid whiny BS I didn't understand about the world.

You will get there too.  It probably balances out with ageism that comes from their direction.   To them everyone above a certain ages is a joke, with no life, is just playing cards waiting to die while the nurse changes our IV.  The most typical questions we get asked here are about age related dick problems, our regrets, and what advice we can give to 23 year olds.  Believe it or not, even at advanced ages people have better things to do than give advice and they have exciting open vistas they are looking at in their lives( even sex).  They have other things to talk about other than those often repeated mundane questions.  They have vitality.  Yah, many people above a certain age don't, but look at all of the younger people on reddit that don't either."

Those fuckers vote. They have spent decades shaping* national and international policy from a remarkably ignorant, self-centered point of perspective. They're responsible for the worst current effects of both conservative and liberal political mindsets. They not only watch FOX and/or MSNBC, they believe the shit that is spoon-fed to them. They collect social security. They were raised in a boomtime of economic privilege and opportunity, are living off the fruits of the efforts and struggles of the generation before them, and instead of making the world better for future generations have decided to stay in luxury by cannibalizing the youth.   Hell, in Japan the elderly have already overtaken teenagers in crime stats.  In comparison, acting cringeworthingly angsty, having poor communications skills, and constantly needing approval pales by comparison, at least in terms of making me want to scream."
AskMenOver30,3dl2kw,Khatib,4,Fri Jul 17 17:58:27 2015 UTC,Honestly no. Having people constantly invalidate your problems fucking sucks. It's a shitty thing to do and it makes you feel like shit.
AskMenOver30,3dl2kw,raziphel,6,Fri Jul 17 13:53:24 2015 UTC,I find a large margin of difference between invalidation and simply not validating.

AskMenOver30,3dgyfz,newhappyrainbow,31,Thu Jul 16 04:46:10 2015 UTC,"I had an experience with a woman your age (and I guess my age currently) when I was in my early 20s.    Right off the bat, the sex was fantastic.  Better than I had ever experienced in my life up until that point.  I couldn't believe that a woman could be so comfortable with her own body, so eager to please, and enjoy every minute of it.  It really loosened me up personally.  Of course there were the high fives with my friends (""Dude!  six times in twelve hours!!""  ""Whoah... man, so jealous!)  Meeting her friends was weird.  Some of them, who had kids a few years younger than me, would speak to me like a child.  That was infuriating and demeaning.  Meeting her family members was way messed up.  Her nephew was a couple of years younger, and was totally polite, but it was still strange.  I don't know what she was thinking doing exposing me to them, but she was little bit country.  Lastly, I was totally unprepared for her to get attached.  She got a little stalker-y, and I'm not saying you're like that in any way, but that, along with everything mentioned above, gave me severe anxiety.    I was genuinely scared to break up with her, but I did anyway.  I think I broke down crying, feeling like adulthood had just been thrust upon me, while in reality I was just 4 years out of high school.  Of course, I couldn't realize any of that at the time.  10 years later I dated an older woman with the same age difference.  She had her quirks, too, and it didn't work out, but I was able to recognize those personality flaws 10x faster having actually lived as an adult.  Edit: To add, she had already made her life's choices when I hadn't yet made mine and it really threw me off. She asked me about kids (she had none) and if I wanted any.  She didn't, I had no idea at the time.  She asked where I wanted to live the rest of my life, I didn't know while she did.  Again, felt like I was being thrusted into adult life sooner than I was prepared for."
AskMenOver30,3dgyfz,nolifecrisis,10,Thu Jul 16 05:03:55 2015 UTC,"Situation is exact opposite of what you describe. At the risk of sound callous, I think (despite me telling him about my casual lifestyle before anything got heated) he thought the sex was gateway to a relationship and was upset when I immediately quashed that. My biggest upset is whether, as the older more experienced partner, I should have been somewhat more clairvoyant as to the possible outcome."
AskMenOver30,3dgyfz,Fenris78,11,Thu Jul 16 05:29:27 2015 UTC,"I think the honest truth is that almost any casual relationship one person is going to want more than the other. Psychologically we often pursue things that retreat from us, there was even a film to that effect IIRC: The Tao of Steve. So by remaining relatively unobtainable you may actually increase the likelihood of them thinking they want a relationship - but I don't mean to suggest you're at fault.   When I was mid 20s I was jaded from a previous relationship and dated a long series of women and finished every one, apart from one where the woman held me at arm's length. I made more effort to get her to like me but she still finished with me. In all honesty, in the long run, it probably did me good.  I think that if you're honest from the onset you're morally in the clear. If they develop feelings that's not your fault. Men have been doing the same thing forever. The worst you're doing is disappointing someone, and the comes with the territory when you're dating."
AskMenOver30,3dgyfz,Fenris78,4,Thu Jul 16 06:16:56 2015 UTC,You are basically saying exactly what I feel. I did nothing wrong aside from being not being cognoscente of how the age difference defines maturity.
AskMenOver30,3dgyfz,nolifecrisis,5,Thu Jul 16 06:35:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think the age difference is even that big a part of it. If you had the same relationship circumstances with someone our age, I think you could end up with the exact same result.  People deep-down want to be desired. If you demonstrate that it's purely a casual relationship that you're happy to walk away from at any time, it triggers the other person to try and prove their worth to you, so that you actively want a relationship with them. In this kind of situation, if you suddenly did flip your position and go after a relationship with them, there's good odds that they'd get cold feet very quickly - they've made you want them, and that's all they subconsciously wanted to start with.  Aside from that, this has made me think, it there was a 38 year old guy saying he just wanted casual sex with girls in their mid 20s I'd find it a bit distasteful. I'm surprised at my double standard! Still, I spent some time with a ""sugar mummy"" in my early/mid-20s (she was 40) and no regrets - although in that situation it was her who at the end of it wanted more of a relationship out of it than I did."
AskMenOver30,3dgyfz,markevens,3,Thu Jul 16 07:38:25 2015 UTC,"You probably should have been more clairvoyant, honestly.  Men aren't great with recognizing emotions to begin with, and a man in his 20's won't even know how to recognize them while they're manifesting.  Of course, there's a switch in their brain to make them tell themselves they have everything under control, so they won't recognize the confusion going on.       So I guess, be aware of that.  No matter how forthright and upfront you are, there's the real possibility of emotional baggage that even they won't be able to realize they're experiencing."

AskMenOver30,3dgyfz,nolifecrisis,15,Thu Jul 16 06:37:39 2015 UTC,Here's a big secret: guys actually get attached just as much as gals do.  The difference is mostly about social pressures.

AskMenOver30,3dgyfz,El_Cid_Vicious,2,Thu Jul 16 07:07:13 2015 UTC,"There is nothing wrong with having emotions involved in sex, even casual sex.    What is needed in casual sex is the ability to not get over emotional."
AskMenOver30,3dgyfz,stares_at_screens,2,Thu Jul 16 15:21:58 2015 UTC,"That's more what I meant. Everyone has emotions about sex, but the ability to separate love and sex is paramount."

I think you did everything right. You were honest right upfront and when he tried to push that boundary, you immediately said ""No, that's not going to happen."" I don't think you could have done anymore than that, and in this situation, you're not responsible for his feelings, IMO, despite what /u/nolifecrisis said. Now, if you continued to sleep with him after this (even if he says he gets it now, it's just sex, yada yada), I do think that would be irresponsible."

AskMenOver30,3dgyfz,nxqv,19,Thu Jul 16 06:57:57 2015 UTC,I had a few cougars in my 20s. Their jealousy over girls closer to my age usually ruined it.   Avoid sleepovers.

All I ask is honesty and protection."
AskMenOver30,3dgyfz,stares_at_screens,15,Fri Jul 17 04:05:39 2015 UTC,"Had a cougar divorcee who was 37 when I was 23 or so.  She was a client and was hitting on me at a function. I split because, well, she was a 37-year-old divorcee who was a client.  She invited me out for a drink a few days later which I accepted because I figured I could let her down easy. Two drinks in she said, pretty much verbatim, ""Here's the thing: I find you hot and want to fuck you but in no way do I want a relationship. This is just about the sex.""   I couldn't have paid the check fast enough.  Lasted a good six months and the sex was great. (The first time she got me naked she looked at my dick and said ""I'm super into blowjobs"" before, well, yeah...) I was absolutely blown away (heh) by a woman that was that upfront about her sexuality.   In the end it fell apart because you can't base a relationship on nothing but sex but it was great while it lasted and I learned a lot. I think you'll find that young guys are pretty immature but if you're very upfront about what you want out of the relationship then you can't be too much to blame when things go south. Set some rules and if either of you start breaking them, cut it off."

AskMenOver30,3dgyfz,sublimesam,4,Fri Jul 17 06:54:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is really anything about a guy's specific age that would indicate whether he'd fit into your target specific or not.  Some guys in their 20s can become attached very quickly, and some not, it's not so much about their age as emotional maturity I think.  You may want to feel them out a bit on that before making advances, lest you end up with someone who think's you're ""the one"" for him and he'll follow you to the ends of the earth."
AskMenOver30,3dgyfz,anillop,7,Thu Jul 16 10:52:49 2015 UTC,"I think you should avoid any guy below 25. Because you could easily be taking advantage of someone younger than that.  Aside from that, the only thing you should worry about is clearly setting his expectations. As long as you communicate you are not looking for a serious relationship, and that's not negotiable, I think it's fine.  Many, if not most, guys in their mid twenties would absolutely be into having a casual relationship as long as it was clear at the outset. In fact, the age difference with you makes it so that they should expect a casual relationship. But never assume they get it unless you spell it out."

Stay fit, dress well, have a good haircut, be wealthy (it can be anything that sets you apart from the general public) Be nice and unthreatening, then be forward. You'll strike out a lot but the slutty girls will respond. If you want to go chill, ask if you can buy her a drink, if you want to find a slut, ask if you can touch her perfect ass.  Be entirely honest about your intentions BEFORE you get busy. Getting turned down at the endgame is way better than tricking someone into bed. Be clean, trimmed, use protection religiously, get tested every 6 months whether you think you need it or not and be verbal about your assurance that you are clean of STIs.

AskMenOver30,3dgyxd,kngghst,2,Thu Jul 16 18:14:44 2015 UTC,"As someone who is has an extreme lean towards ""Acts of Service"", compliments have always been a weak point for me."
AskMenOver30,3dgyxd,wtmh,3,Thu Jul 16 16:59:07 2015 UTC,"Acts of service person chiming in too! We need to start a club. Before I learned about the love languages thing, I always used to say ""Talk is the cheapest thing in the world"" because I felt words were often so useless in general.   Do you hate greeting cards for birthdays, holidays, etc just as much as I do? I mean both giving and receiving? I usually start writing Christmas cards around now so that I get them done a little at a time because I hate doing it so much."
AskMenOver30,3dgyxd,MoeBetterBooze,4,Thu Jul 16 17:59:47 2015 UTC,"Mmmhm. I don't care for cards, gifts, or people telling me I look good, etc. I'm always thankful, but they just don't do it for me. They feel so hollow and having no real consequence to my every day life. In the same vein I don't buy people flowers, or dote on people's new haircut or outfit.  But if someone picks me up some food? Awww yisss. Basically my favorite person in the world. And in return I'll give 'em a foot rub. ^_^"
AskMenOver30,3dgyxd,wtmh,7,Thu Jul 16 18:12:03 2015 UTC,I think anyone who has ever had a GF or who has been well socialized realizes how important this is.   Men also enjoy giving compliments.
AskMenOver30,3dgyxd,cyanocobalamin,4,Thu Jul 16 11:40:29 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why you wouldn't complement the person you love. What do you love about them? Tell them that. It isn't that ""women expect to be desirable and to be told so"" exactly, or it is much more nuanced than that. Yes, I want to be desired by the person I am in a romantic relationship with. Don't you? I tell my boyfriend all the fucking time that he is sexy, I also tell him he is smart, and he is funny, because he IS and because I love all that about him, those words just come out, it has nothing to do with him WANTING or NEEDING to be complemented, his feeling good and having reassurance that I find him sexy/smart/funny is a by-product of that.  Yes, people want to know and be told by their partner that they are wanted, desired, and loved. Some might need that assurance more than others and it is up to you what you are comfortable in giving and receiving. Some people are unreasonably needy too. I don't think this is even a gender thing. It is really nice when your partner says ""your ass is so hot"" just because that is what came to their mind, even if you already know they love and want you and that your ass totally does look really hot.  I wonder if a relationship could last without them but I suppose if both people in the relationship are either mind-readers and don't need to verbalize or if they don't want or need reassurance ever...then ok! I think complementing your partner is a normal part of relationships because it reminds you and them what things about them that draw you to them.  To answer your last question, I never actively required complements. I don't require thinking ""he needs to complement me more"" because there are other ways to show appreciation but I think appreciation IS something I require in a relationship and that goes both ways. Why would I be with someone I don't appreciate or desire? Why would be be with me if he doesn't appreciate or desire me? I don't know how verbalizing appreciation wouldn't happen without actively avoiding it. It should flow naturally. When my boyfriend and I are having a conversation or telling each other about a project we are working on, it is hard NOT to say ""wow that is awesome, what a great idea."" It is hard not to say ""that shirt looks so good on you"" when we are constantly admiring each others body."
AskMenOver30,3dgyxd,RobotPartsCorp,9,Thu Jul 16 21:34:18 2015 UTC,I'm having the opposite issue with my current girlfriend of 6 months. She hardly ever reciprocates whenever I say something nice or complimentary (she barely even acknowledges I said something) and I'm finding women in my age range (38-45)have been burned by so many bad guys they're almost so numb that they have a hard time recognizing a good guy when they see one. We're taking it slow and so far so good as she's a great woman in general but she's not the warmest of women I've met (my ex-wife was an Ice Queen so I have standards).
AskMenOver30,3dgyxd,blackpony04,3,Thu Jul 16 12:33:18 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of ways to tell a person that they mean a lot to you. Some are through words. Some are through actions. I find the meanings conveyed through deeds tend to be far more honest than spoken ones--not to mention I am fairly shit at both giving and receiving compliments.

I honestly can't say I know for sure, as I've always gotten them and in truth they always make me feel good when they're sincere.   Dropping empty bullshit is stupid and if you're with someone who wants you doing that all the time, they're insecure. But if you can't compliment the person you're with at least fairly regularly, whether it's their appearance, or their actions and accomplishments, that might not be the best person for you to be with, or you might have communication issues."

AskMenOver30,3dgyxd,green_lightning,3,Thu Jul 16 06:43:35 2015 UTC,"The notion that a woman's value is (even partly) determined by her physical beauty is a damaging one, especially as we age. Do any of the men in here feel a need to be told that they are beautiful? Imagine how it would feel - the craving to be beautiful contrasted with the ongoing work of gravity and time.   Try to notice media that are designed to make women feel ashamed about their bodies, which is by and large all media. We are surrounded by ads and material that exists only to ""prove"" to women that they do not meet ""the standard"", and then to sell them products to rectify this situation. The result is that many (most?) women feel shame about their appearance, which leads to a craving for outside affirmation (compliments).   This sucks for everybody. Unfortunately, constantly telling women that they are beautiful, however kindly meant, only serves to reinforce the idea that they should be beautiful, that beauty is important. So I don't do it.   I compliment the things that I think really are important. Humor, kindness, empathy, resilience. Physically, I compliment strength, health, flexibility, endurance, and daring. When it comes to appearance, I pretty much just compliment clothing choices or maybe makeup application. Like, ""wow, nice dress, really flattering"".   I've found over the years that women are incredibly relieved if you show that appearance isn't important, especially beautiful women. Really good looking women have been hearing how hot they are since they were 15, and if they have any brains at all they have certainly wondered whether their main value lies in the shape of their face. Don't even allude to appearance in front of these women."
AskMenOver30,3dgyxd,backgammon_no,4,Thu Jul 16 08:31:41 2015 UTC,"It's not like this idea just comes from the media. Most men in this subreddit would say that looks are important to them. Looks are important to most people when it comes to attraction, so letting your partner know you think she's pretty is just another way of letting her know you're still attracted to her."

AskMenOver30,3dgyxd,backgammon_no,4,Thu Jul 16 15:13:27 2015 UTC,"Right, so recognizing that defining women by their beauty is damaging, we need to stop perpetuating the idea.

Edit: I always understood that song to mean ""an ugly wife will make you happy, because she has few other options and you will not have to try very hard""  Chorus: If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life, Never make a pretty woman your wife. So from my personal point of view, Get an ugly girl to marry you.    Chorus  A pretty woman makes her husband look small, And very often causes his downfall. As soon as he marries her, then she starts, To do the things that will break his heart.    But if you make an ugly woman your wife, You'll be happy for the rest of your life.

I don't want any more kids. I've done diapers and teething and sleepless nights and potty training, I have absolutely no desire to do it again.   For the most part it's much easier now because most of us have learned to communicate - am I doing a thing which pisses you off? Tell me about it, I'll either stop doing it or explain why I'm not going to stop doing it and we'll go from there. Just being pissed off because you didn't want to tell me about it leads nowhere good.   But there are still some who tick off way more of that list than is healthy (I'm sure there is a correlation to fake tan), and there's a ""Cosmo type"" that I don't do well with either.

AskMenOver30,3ddi2c,Balls2dwalls,6,Wed Jul 15 22:06:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not yet 50, but a number of my friends are (and I have a relationship podcast that caters to the middle-to-older aged crowd, so we get listener questions and comments often enough).  Where you meet people is very different. Aside from work, you aren't forced into close proximity to a whole bunch of other people as you were when you were in school. Sure, there's still an active bar scene for older people in a lot of areas, but there's a high degree of dissatisfaction among the older men and women I've spoken to about the bar scene. Also, you tend to start seeing the regulars in these places - there isn't a lot of new blood, as it were. You really have to push yourself into new hangouts - take some adult classes, pick up a co-ed team sport, etc.  Also, having already gone through the marriage and family thing, many men aren't looking for a repeat. Sure, they'd like a companion but, just as they are with friends, they don't necessarily want to just be tied to 1 person. Of course, that's not something a lot of women are cool with, so it makes for a challenging dynamic. At middle-age, though, the dating pool is considerably smaller (even with high-ish divorce rates, there are a lot more people who are still married when they're 50 than when they're 20) and so many adults have to either change their standards or be more willing to be in a non-committed relationship.

I'm not middle aged yet but I am already seeing a shift in a) the kinds of people I want to date, b) my options for how to meet them, and c) people my age and older having significant shifts in their life goals. I feel I identify more with the older crowd and the bar scene definitely needs new blood, I would go to bars if I thought that was likely, but not especially in a small town in this age pool (over 30 for my purposes).  Not looking for a marriage/kids repeat is one thing I find appealing about lots of older men. I am having trouble finding any to date, though, because they either don't believe me when I say I don't want kids, or maybe they're insecure dating someone 20 years younger despite my professed interest. I would much rather date a 55 year old guy than a 25 year old. I can't imagine ever dating someone in their 20's again. Maybe I'll change my mind when I'm a cougar :)"

A thousand times repeated and it wouldn't be repeated enough.  This is why I sit alone.  This is why I slip out the door quietly when a woman tries approaching, it's not that she's not smart/pretty/good enough.   Even though I want her, I want to please her, I want to provide to her; I can't give her what the majority of women tend to look for.   I don't want to pay all her bills for her.   I can't be her savior.   I can't give myself over to her and it kills me inside.  Unless the woman can actually be a real friend, one that realizes that people aren't property to be owned, one that gives as well as receives without demands for more than can be given, which is only marginally greater than impossible, I can't have her in my company.   Also, I surprisingly have a couple of FWBs, despite it all (Will probably have to drop one, the 15+ year older one, because she's hinting at wanting to own me)..

The key to this one is probably to find someone that's dated younger before and your making the use of birth control obvious. I initially didn't believe it either, but it became apparent to me in my early 40s that I (M) actually had a better shot at dating a woman under 30 than over 40 -- just commented about this a few hours ago in a different thread.  To turn it around, a single, well-off guy in his 40s/50s has a lot to lose, and very likely had at least one experience with a woman that was trolling for babies and financial support. This is probably the only real downside to the fact that guys are fertile into their 90s, lol."
AskMenOver30,3ddi2c,AyeMatey,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:46:15 2015 UTC,It's a lot easier in a more urban/progressive area I've found.

They all seem to think I'm weird for not trying to trap a guy into being my babydaddy like they've done three or four times already. So many don't even know their birth control rights and options.

AskMenOver30,3ddi2c,TotesMessenger,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:55:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the trap thing is very real, and that will make most older guys very suspicious of the motives of a significantly younger woman showing interest.   I have a couple homes, one in a very rural area, and there's virtually no way an inter-generational romance could happen for most there because 80%+ of the social life there revolves around church or a heavily-connected charity. So basically only social outcasts hooking up with other outcasts would be how it could happen. At my house that's closer to the city that has a larger population and wealthy neighborhoods where trophy wives are the norm, it's much more common, along with younger women from local colleges experimenting, etc.   The irony is that in the rural area, the younger women would be much better off dating older men and not getting onto the baby track so young."

AskMenOver30,3ddi2c,1991_VG,8,Thu Jul 16 01:38:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah: flirting is done by driving a Mercedes, Porsche or Lexus, or having a vacation property near some ski slopes.  Dating is no longer ramen noodles and a movie.  It's a weekend in Sun Valley, or a trip to Monterey.     Seriously - flirting is flirting, but it can be and often is more subtle with older people.  More nuanced, slower maybe.    Older people look for generally the same thing in a partner that younger people look for: compatibility, excitement, someone fun to hang around with, someone to pursue shared activities with.   Sometimes those activities are quieter than when they were younger - a driving tour of wineries, versus a hike up Mt Rainier.  But sometimes not.  50 yr olds can run ultramarathons, ride bicycles 100 miles, or climb mountains just fine, if they've taken care of themselves.  And finding a partner at 50-ish is the same as when you're 30-ish - you do the things you like to do, and look for people who share those interests.  Go waterskiing or go to renaissance faires or to ComicCon, or whatever it is you like to do. There you will find people you like.   When the kids move out it makes for lots of free time, which means good possibilities for dating. Can stay out all weekend, all of the following week too, even.    Are there things younger people might not notice?   Not sure what you're getting at here with ""might not notice"".   One big thing I look for in a partner is a healthy attitude. Health is taken for granted by younger people, but people 40 and up have begin to reap what they've sown, so to speak, on the health and habits front. If the person has had poor sleep habits for years, they probably won't be active, or up for a surprise vacation.  If the person hasn't made exercise or fitness a part of their daily routine, the body will sag, and they may have problems doing regular things (hikes, or bike rides). If they haven't made a habit of being gentle with themselves, they can have become bitter or cynical or negative.  If they haven't been wise with finances, they'll still be cramped, money-wise, and not able to share the dating load - to pay for a dinner out, or to fund their own gear for activities. (Having money challenges is fine and normal for someone who is 26, but when you're 46, people are expected to be more independent financially)   At 50-ish, it's hard to switch or reverse the effects of 20-year habits. The effects are sort of set firmly, at that point."
AskMenOver30,3ddi2c,Dubsland12,2,Wed Jul 15 14:44:45 2015 UTC,"What I mean is those subtle nuanced and slower techniques, maybe. Younger, inexperienced, or insecure women in particular might not pick up that an older man is flirting with them or that he is interested because they're used to what younger men do - if there is a difference. I suspect there is, as you mention the subtleties. I'm very curious about those but I don't get to observe it for myself very often."

AskMenOver30,3ddi2c,RealLADude,4,Wed Jul 15 15:36:53 2015 UTC,"A 22 year old woman is (generally speaking) going to be insecure about the normal fact that she has a couple stretch marks on her hips from puberty, the normal fact that one breast is a tiny bit bigger than the other, or this and that. She may want to fuck with the lights off, or cover herself up when you get her clothes off. If you guys have a disagreement, she's likely going to take it very personally and it will be a big deal to her because she doesn't know anything else.   Okay, I can only go to 33 years old, not 44. But at 33, I know that stretch marks, have one boon be a tiny big bigger than that other, a bit of cellulite even though I'm thin, etc, is normal. I'm not as upset at having a disagreement because disagreements happen. I'm also a lot less self critical, and I'm less concerned about being not annoying and the perfect partner. I realize I'm not a perfect human being and that I don't need to put up with a guy that expects me to be a perfect non annoying demure little woman. And I'm more accepting that the man I'm with is an imperfect human being as well, that picking up his dirty socks because he never puts them in the hamper is not a big deal if he's a good partner in every other way.   I will say that at my age, I've been divorced, I've been hurt and had my heart broken, had to deal with life, had kids. So I'm not as ""fun and free"" at times as a 22 year old. So that's a downside to being older. I also have commitments, I wouldn't be able to just go out at the drop of a hat the way many younger people can, I'd have to make arrangements. So in my view, one age group isn't better than the other, they're just different."

AskMenOver30,3ddi2c,farox,2,Wed Jul 15 20:07:13 2015 UTC,"BS is code for drama. I've found that ultimately almost everything related to ""drama"" is her demanding unreasonable levels of commitment too early, or just flat out commitment well in excess of what he wants. That shows up as things like:   Needing substantial financial support from the guy to live normally. This usually at a minimum implies his paying her rent. Her wanting to move in right away, or far worse, to combine households in a new place, e.g. he's supposed to sell his place, buy the place she wants, and provide a white picket fence fantasy. Tests. Dear god, the tests. Many women are insecure in general but there seems like the really insecure ones are super active in the dating market (which is smaller at 50 and a lot of women aren't dating, so it gets really strange). So they'll have ""emergencies"" to validate the guy cares, to the point there's so many the guy stops caring. Related to the tests, games. Playing hard to get and then freaking out when the guy loses all interest in chasing. Trying to make sex transactional (so pay the rent/buy those shoes and you get laid, but it won't happen otherwise). Trying to make the guy jealous, etc.   Part of the disconnect I think is the usual sex v. commitment battle that's always present, but the game has changed a lot, as guys that are older are willing to walk away or simply not play, and women that are older think they can still do what they did in their 20s to get commitment from a guy and get away with it, when the reality their dating market value goes down now and not up if they're hard to get."
AskMenOver30,3ddi2c,PlusGoody,3,Wed Jul 15 19:05:03 2015 UTC,"It's kind of blowing my mind how much I hear about the babytrap. What gives? I don't personally know any women who have done this, but I tend to socialize with other women who are child free or waiting to have children. I want commitment of some kind, but it's not the traditional scary definition of commitment. I don't need a ring or a baby or a financial agreement. It's not so black and white, you know? (Sure you do.)"
AskMenOver30,3ddi2c,NomadicAgenda,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:42:01 2015 UTC,"Well, to me there is BS and there is baggage.  Baggage is kid issues, crazy ex's, financial black holes, health issues, etc. Sometimes their fault, sometimes not.  BS is behavior to me.  Some people never grow up. They stop at 15 or so and their BS is the same as 22 year old BS.  I find in general the BS reduces as we age, but the baggage increases. I ve got mine too, you just have to decide what you are willing to accept."
AskMenOver30,3ddi2c,NomadicAgenda,3,Wed Jul 15 21:28:48 2015 UTC,"I'm 50 and there are less games.  If I like her, I tell her.  After the date, if I want to text her, I text her, I don't play the ""is it too soon, is it too late?"" games.  I have neither the time nor the interest in them.  I also don't use pickup lines, but then I don't go to bars where pickup lines are used.  I live my life, I go do things, and if I see someone interesting there I go up and talk to them.  If there's a connection, we keep talking, if not then we stop.  I know on the first date whether there will be a second, and I absolutely drop it if there's no connection or chemistry.  I really enjoy my life and the idea of being with someone for the wrong reasons just to be with them is abhorrent to me.  She and I both have better things to do than make each other miserable just so we have company.  I think that's the biggest difference for me.  I put up with a lot of shit in my youth just so I had someone to cuddle.  These days I can cuddle myself or rent a cuddler if I absolutely need it (and a professional at that, none of this amateur nonsense), so we'd better have a connection or it's a waste of both our time."

AskMenOver30,3dajnb,umichscoots,7,Tue Jul 14 19:50:31 2015 UTC,Don't deny your agency. Humans have a capacity that no other creature has: to observe oneself and decide if that's the self one wants.  Change is absolutely possible. But only the change you want.
AskMenOver30,3dajnb,Lightspeedius,2,Wed Jul 15 00:42:28 2015 UTC,"Some people say that. It's empirically proven to be incorrect. People can and do indeed experience long term change. I certainly have, my goodness! One of my most gratifying recent experiences in recent times was meeting someone I hadn't seen in decades who didn't initially recognise me. When they did recognise me their response was ""woah"".  I'm definitely not suggesting you change into someone other people would be happy with. I'm suggesting that if you want something different for yourself you can have it. Even if all you want is to be satisfied with your life as it is. Maybe you're quite happy with being a real mess? I definitely known people who are and I respect them for that.  It's not easy work, but I'm not sure of anything more worthwhile in life. That said, there are actually some pretty straightforward techniques for getting insight into oneself and more agency quickly. Mindfulness practice is one such technique.  If you ever do decide you want to pursue this path, definitely take a look around your local community. I would be surprised if there aren't cheap or free community groups around. Not all will suit you, but any that are committed to a non-judgemental approach should offer something helpful."
AskMenOver30,3dajnb,Lightspeedius,2,Wed Jul 15 02:37:11 2015 UTC,I'm basically reaching that conclusion and it sucks.  I just keep on enjoying what I can out of life and have not let being alone retract from what I like to do.

The reason I'm asking is because I wonder if you're end goal is if you approach these situations as trying to get them into bed. If so, then those ones will think ""oh, just a fuck? That's fine"" and then move on.  Also, this:   I am firmly in the camp of never having children and 9 times out of 10 it's a deal-breaker for the other party   Is probably the deal breaker you're talking about. But, not everyone woman want's kids either. There are a variety of women that don't, but more than not they do."
AskMenOver30,3dajnb,devtastic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:41:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  For me, a lot is 3-4 times per year with different people.  Never in the first couple dates (except once but that's a completely different story).  Basically what happens is this: if we get to the stage of having  a physical relationship, I want to make sure we're on the same page about kids before I get emotionally involved.  This is where it all falls apart because it seems every person I've ever gotten to this point with wants kids.    I am firmly in the camp of never having children and 9 times out of 10 it's a deal-breaker for the other party Is probably the deal breaker you're talking about.   But, not everyone woman want's kids either. There are a variety of women that don't, but more than not they do.   I agree and it sucks because it's not entirely socially acceptable to forego parenthood where I'm from.  People are raised to think they aren't complete unless they become a mommy or daddy, and even in this thread there's a person saying I'll change my mind someday.  I would never ever try to dissuade someone who wants kids from having them, and so I break it off."

AskMenOver30,3da78d,dzendian,6,Tue Jul 14 18:27:03 2015 UTC,"For a lot of people, ""vacation"" isn't about traveling, but about getting some peace and some time to yourself to do things you've been wanting to do. Anything that fills you with a sense of accomplishment (like the home repairs) makes for a good day.  But treat yourself, too. Go out to dinner (or lunch), or order pizza in when you normally wouldn't during your regular routine. Little stuff like that really adds to the relaxation and helps take the ""work day"" edge off.   And take a day just to go for a drive. Go someplace you don't normally visit, or just see where the road leads. See something cool along the way? Stop and check it out."

Staying at home can be a nice change of pace, but it's easier to break old habits in a new place. You don't even have to go far; rent a hotel room for two days and hang out by the pool. Who cares if the hotel is only 30 minutes from your house?"
AskMenOver30,3da78d,Nellisir,3,Wed Jul 15 01:53:05 2015 UTC,"What's your definition of vacation? Each person has their own way of enjoying their time. It can be travelling, sitting on a beach, or just simply sipping a beer and watching some TV show."
AskMenOver30,3da78d,iamconstant,2,Wed Jul 15 02:48:13 2015 UTC,"Two options:   Take advantage of the time off and do things that you want to get done, but don't ""normally have the time"" to get down. I use quotation marks because often those things aren't a high enough priority to get done and you'd rather rest after a day of work. Go somewhere. This can be broken down into two section as some people prefer a script vacation. By this, I mean that you have everything timed going from one location to another. Other people prefer a lax vacation, where you don't have plans outside of going somewhere and everything in between is unknown.   I've had vacations where I just took a day off of work and played video games all day. To me, that was time worth spending and relaxing. I've done a week long event of this and after two days or so you really get cabin fever and want to escape. At that point I went outside and took a walk, or started to fix something in the house I needed to get taken care of, or whatever.  You can still travel. I get car sick easily, but I take bonine and I'm usually fine. Packing some ginger snacks (I love ginger chews) really helps prevent sickness. I can't recommend Dramamine. It definitely helps, but it doesn't last as long and it ruins your appetite and you fall asleep.  The most important thing about vacation, though, is avoiding work. Don't think about work, don't check emails, don't take work-related calls. Nothing. Do something for you. It doesn't matter what you do as long as it's not relating to work."
AskMenOver30,3da78d,waspocracy,2,Tue Jul 14 20:53:23 2015 UTC,"I'm super lucky that my family has a beach cottage less than two hours drive from my house.   But even if I didn't, there's a group of about ten or so people that all come and hang out. We drink beer, play music, smoke some J, eat really, really, really well (10 people; 13 lobsters, 5# of steamers, 3# mussles, dozen ears of fresh corn, chorizo, and chowder. This is one meal). We go kayaking, fishing, swimming, sunburning, hiking.  Even if I had to pay, due to the amount of people I have, we could easily afford it on the cheap. Probably about $125 for the week per person.   That's the way to vacation in my opinion."
AskMenOver30,3da78d,graffiti81,2,Wed Jul 15 11:31:12 2015 UTC,For me it's not planning anything.  No stress of being in location x at time Y.  Just do whatever you feel like whenever you feel like.  Go with the flow of your day.  Improvise but stay Zen about it.

The nagging, daily, social awkwardness problems most of us all have to some extent don't necessarily get any smaller, but they get dwarfed by the real problems and concerns that life brings as you get older.    You only have so many fucks to give, so when they're all taken by the more important stuff the small shit gets shrugged off.    At 40 years old I have the same thoughts going through my head in social situations that I did when I was 15, but I just don't fucking care about them anymore.  I have real concerns like two kids and all the shit that entails, aging parents, a house that needs constant upkeep, my parents' house that needs constant upkeep, worries about where my job is going to be in the future.  The list goes on for fucking ever.    The thought in the back of my head that I need to get the oil changed and tires rotated on my car far outweighs my concern with what you think about me during our brief encounter."

AskMenOver30,3d5wly,blot101,44,Tue Jul 14 12:15:03 2015 UTC,"50 here.  I posted this elsewhere, but it's relevant here.  When we are born, much in the same way that a woman is born with all of the eggs she's going to make, I feel we are born with a finite amount of fucks. When I was younger, I was extremely generous with my fucks. Hell, I was practically Oprah with my fucks. You get a fuck, you get a fuck, EVERYone gets a fuck!  Then one day around 30, someone asked me to give a fuck about something, I reached into my bag and noticed that I didn't have a whole lot of fucks left. I was almost worried about that until I realized that being worried about how few fucks I had left would cost me yet another fuck.  At this point, I started to become a lot more selfish with my fucks. There were some really important things I still gave a fuck about, but the bar below which I would not give a fuck rose significantly and everything below that simply didn't get one of my fucks. Now that I'm 50, it better be pretty fucking important or not a single fuck will be given. I've got like 5 fucks left at this point, and I'm saving them up for someone special.  The fact that I decided to give a fuck about this post enough to reply should really impress you :)"

AskMenOver30,3d5wly,1991_VG,3,Tue Jul 14 04:35:36 2015 UTC,"It's a bit misleading. It's not that giving a fuck is a finite amount, it's that over time your start to question why you're acting giving a fuck about whatever. Over time you start to realize that the really obvious reason you give a fuck about anything is b/c of potential gain (or conversely the avoidance of loss). Ultimately, this is the pleasure principle - you seek pleasure, avoid pain. What you realize is that the gain/pain that you are confronting/avoiding is illusory or extremely supplemented by fantasy as to be basically illusory.  For example, how much sex you get. This is the ultimate fuck given but is it valid? When you unwrap the enigma of sexual desire and what's really at stake you realize how an impotent man can love a woman. Your body wants orgasm but your desire is different than your wants, needs or your instinctual drives. Desire is only coincidentally related to sex. Imagine the weight lifted from your shoulders as a man - it's the ultimate freedom. You leave the treadmill behind and life is full of treadmills that you run on fearing something that will automatically occur if you stop. Not giving a fuck is mostly about seeing the treadmills for what they are - as mechtonia has written: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenOver30/comments/3d5wly/how_is_it_that_most_older_men_dont_give_a_fuck/ct23kz0"

AskMenOver30,3d5wly,boojieboy,22,Mon Jul 13 23:14:23 2015 UTC,"It's because your self-worth is no longer driven by what people think of you.  I am 32, and I know that my 'value' as a man is driven by the results that I can deliver and my productive capability in whatever avenue I decide to take up.  Often, achieving those results and maximizing my productive capability means I may have to deliberately embarrass myself or anger others.  Given that perspective, social awkwardness and other people's judgements become an intended side-effect rather than an accidental one.  It's all a means to achieve a desired result; since I do this knowing that I can achieve (what I intend) despite what others may think, I no longer care what others actually think."

When she smiles and nods in response to my smile, it's because I'm safe - I'm not going to hit on her because we're not swimming in the same pool any more, so I'm not nervous about what she thinks, so I don't get wrapped up.  Younger guys?  Mostly I'm evaluating how they would be if I hired them, not comparinig physiques.  Older guys?  They've been scarred and scraped as much as I have, and we tend to be way more tolerant of weirdness because we've all been on the planet long enough to have idiosyncracies that work for us: everyone's a pervert, everyone's neurotic, everyone has goals they'll never meet: if anyone starts acting like Donald Trump to establish dominance, it's met with mild bemusement.  Your heart will have already been broken so deeply that nothing else will scare you.  You will have been desparate and destitute, and crawled out of it so that won't have any purchase over you.  You will have been betrayed, abandoned, alone, frightened, and angry, but if you keep you humanity and empathy you can use those experiences to see through the bluster and in to the pain of others, and know that they'll come through it at well.  For me, the lack of fucks isn't a cavalier disregard for the rest of the world, it the depth that comes from a long life, knowing what is important and what isn't, and knowing that everyone suffers in some way.  I may be less intense than when I was younger, but I'm infinitely more kind.  That only comes from being less focused on myself and what others think, which gives me the freedom to focus on others and see their struggles more clearly."

AskMenOver30,3d5wly,Varian,2,Tue Jul 14 00:58:23 2015 UTC,"I think there's a few things at play here. To start, we've already been through and had to overcome the shit that's making you anxious. I've been on a hundred first dates, good and awful. Why would I be scared of one more? I've been married. I've been divorced. I've been beaten bloody. I've been fired. I've watched people I love die. I've also experienced overwhelming joy. There's no fear left in the things I've already been through.   There's also no competition left - for the most part, older dudes are going to be fairly settled into their lives. I'll (probably) stay in the same career for the rest of my life. We've established families. We're (mostly) financially secure. If I don't have to compete with you for any of those resources, what could I possibly have to be anxious about in that regard?  Lastly, I think the cultural difference is huge here. I grew up knowing that the only things people could know about me were things that I explicitly wanted them to know. If I was uncomfortable with a fact about myself, I could keep it hidden, and nobody questioned that I kept things private. I think that's not the case for the younger generation - you guys are expected to share everything with everyone all the time, so you're incredibly self conscious about every little thing. You're constantly worrying about being judged, because you're constantly being judged. I'd bet that if I grew up with that kind of social pressure on me, I'd have some serious social anxiety, too."
AskMenOver30,3d5wly,SuicideFuntime,2,Tue Jul 14 01:29:16 2015 UTC,"It's just a life experience thing...   They've been through much of those experiences before. A ""practice makes perfect"" type thing.  Plus, you've had long enough at your current development stage to get really comfortable in your own skin. That confidence helps.  A 25 year old guy is still worried about finding the right person to settle down with. They're probably still up to their eyeballs in student loan debt, if they've even graduated. They're likely in the early stages of their career if they've even gotten started on it.  At 40, I've long had most of my debt paid off, house aside. I'm about as close to retirement as I am to high school.   I'm more worried about the medical care for the kids... ""Will little Timmy need braces? What are we going to do about Jenny and her ADHD?""  I'm more worried about my retirement accounts... ""Am I saving enough? (no, not really.)""

AskMenOver30,3d5wly,Rocksteady717,3,Tue Jul 14 10:30:57 2015 UTC,"Life is about practice. Trial and error. Most anxiety in my experience comes from not knowing if you'll succeed or fail, and being terrified of failure. I could be wrong in this since I don't have any disorders, but the times I've been most anxious have been the times where I cared the most about the outcome, but knew the least about how to achieve that outcome.  For me, this is like those times you took a bike and jumped it off of a piece of plywood that was propped up on a cinder block and made into a ""ramp"". The first time is always terrifying, but life is about how you deal with that anxiety. How you push yourself to take that risk. Judging the risk vs. the reward correctly, and most importantly knowing what to do if you fail. Knowing these things, or at least having a good guess, kills the anxiety. You get on the bike, ride it off the ramp, and eat shit on the pavement. Did it hurt? Yup. But now you know that failure isn't that bad. So you get back up, brush yourself off, lick your wounds, and do it again, until you get it right.  Now you're an adult, and probably not jumping bikes anymore, but risk analysis will always be with you. For some people even being in a social setting is a huge risk of ridicule and hurt feelings. However, if you put yourself in those situations, and allow yourself to fail, you'll get better at it. Yes, you're going to say stupid shit and get made fun of, but you know what? It's not that bad. You got on the bike and ate shit on the ramp, good for you, get up and do it again, and every time you do it you'll be better at it. Success and failure are not just outcomes, they're lessons to be learned and dealt with.  Older men just have more practice at life. We've tried, succeeded, and failed more. I'm using the bike analogy to help you down the path, but what you'll also find out is that a great deal of apathy comes with wisdom in old age, which falls into the risk analysis category. But as a young person, you're not at that level yet. Things are going to be really important to you now that won't be 10 years from now, so hopefully this will help you deal with these things.  The only true failure is the one who didn't try in the first place."

Then after a while you begin to realise that most things don't really matter, stuff just resolves itself and the world keeps turning. Most people don't matter, their shit stinks like yours does and the ones you want to keep around are the ones who tend to stay around.   You find someone to grow old with and you live together, maybe you have kids which keeps you busy. Then you find you start going to weddings and funerals and actually you realise your image doesn't mean shit. Whats important is that the people you grew up with and who shaped you are leaving you and theres nothing you can do except maybe be a decent human being to others and if you have kids teach them to be decent human beings as well.   Money, jobs, looking good, worrying about strangers is fairly irrelevant when you consider that growing older means your childhood gets dismantled piece by piece and the only course of action left is to accept that by becoming the most badass person you can. Growing old doesn't mean growing up it means accepting that childhood is gone so you now have to be the best person you can and you can't do that if you're trying for universal glory.

Only then you begin to get past your worries and begin to crawl out of the muck and start seeing the world for what it really is. A lot of bullshit that people believe is real."
AskMenOver30,3d5wly,BigAngryDinosaur,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:07:44 2015 UTC,"When I was young, I tried very hard to be more like everyone else so they'd like me. As I got older, I realized that if I wanted anyone to like me instead of the character I was playing, I needed to be authentic and myself. I stopped trying so hard to be what other people wanted and started trying to be a better version of myself.   When I got older still, I realized that having people who I didn't like, like me, was a worthless achievement. So now I just try and like myself more and enjoy the company of people I like, who like me for the same reasons I like myself."
AskMenOver30,3d5wly,scootah,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:07:31 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, older men don't gaf. The perfect example is this ~55 y/o guy at the gym today. He somehow managed to lose his soap on his way from the shower to his locker. What does he do? Proceeds to walk around naked for like 10 minutes trying to find it. I even heard him stop and ask two people if they saw him walk out of the shower room with it."

AskMenOver30,3d5wly,nonsensepoem,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:58:09 2015 UTC,"Just turned 40, and yeah, my sentiments exactly.  I learned that worry and anxiety doesn't change the outcome for the most part."
AskMenOver30,3d5wly,Connir,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:37:53 2015 UTC,"Boils down to life experiences that give you perspective.  Many good posts are already here, but age isn't the only factor.  As a grey beard I have been through some perspective changing experiences, but so have men and women who've served overseas. I have several friends who are young vets ... they get it."
AskMenOver30,3d5wly,Windig0,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:30:51 2015 UTC,"Social anxiety probably gets better as you get older, but if you are an anxious person in general, other anxieties (health, loved ones) might get worse.  At least this is what has been true in my case."
AskMenOver30,3d5wly,wtknight,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:40:42 2015 UTC,"Because at some point you realize what is really important in life for you and your loved ones.  What other people think about you in a social setting is not even close to being a top concern.  What the guys at the gym think, even less."
AskMenOver30,3d5wly,CherryBlaster,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:11:23 2015 UTC,"At work, there's only one person whose opinion of me / my work matters: my boss.    At home, there's one main person and a handful of people whose opinion of me matters: my fiancee and my closest family.  Beyond that, if you like me, that's fine. If you don't, that's fine too.  The person who spends their life trying to please everyone is going to lose their sanity pretty quickly."
AskMenOver30,3d5wly,fitnerd21,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:35:16 2015 UTC,"""I just ran out of bullshit.""  Not 100% relevant, but the basic idea rings true. You eventually realize how exhausting it is to care about all the little things that don't really matter, and then you stop caring about all that bullshit. Howard Beale just takes it a bit further than that."
AskMenOver30,3d7rgm,adick-shin,2,Tue Jul 14 04:22:02 2015 UTC,"I played in my late 20's.  No problems, loved it.  Great for the social life and fitness.  A lot of the guys around me that kept playing into their 30's started needing shoulder and knee surgeries.  That's what stopped me.  I know a couple of boys who are pushing 40 are playing in an over 30's comp. They seem pretty happy in it.  If I was to go back, it would definitely be in an over 30's league.  Partly as I'm less likely to get injured by a guy like 21-year-old-me.   Partly as it'd be more suitable from a social and business networking standpoint."
AskMenOver30,3d7rgm,_tweaks,2,Tue Jul 14 08:12:24 2015 UTC,Enjoy!
AskMenOver30,3d7rgm,cyanocobalamin,2,Tue Jul 14 12:21:33 2015 UTC,My nearly 50 year old ex-boss still plays in a competitive league. He used to look like he got ran over by a bus the day after every match but he loved it. Definitely had a boxer/hockey player nose!
AskMenOver30,3d7rgm,blackpony04,2,Tue Jul 14 14:36:11 2015 UTC,"I've been playing steadily since I was 14, but with decreasing frequency since I was about 27 or 28. I'm now 35. It's gotten harder and harder, as I have less and less time with work and kids to train properly. But it's still fun, and I look forward to the season every year. I just moved from Toronto to Atlanta, so my XV season has switched from spring/summer to fall/winter; I'm now hitting the gym trying to get my ass in shape to join a new club in the fall and avoid embarrassing myself."
AskMenOver30,3d7rgm,whizbangpow,2,Tue Jul 14 15:56:45 2015 UTC,"It's still great for fitness and strength and that whole team thing... it's not so great for your shoulders or your back or your knees or your neck...   Unless you're some kind of pretty boy back, in which case you'll be fine, just don't strain a shoulder combing your hair.   (I kid, you won't be fine, it'll mess you up too... just not as fast)"

AskMenOver30,3d6kml,LookCloserMyFriend,7,Mon Jul 13 22:38:19 2015 UTC,"I didn't date much before getting married so I can't help you there.  On marriage, the clichés are true. Marry your best friend. Looks/aesthetics will change over time so if the only attraction is physical it ain't gonna last. Know the things the person does that bug you and make peace with those habits before you get married (odds are, they aren't changing anytime soon)."
AskMenOver30,3d6kml,HoobidyMcBoobidy,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:57:12 2015 UTC,What if my best friend turned out incompatible? It's hard to make new best friends.
AskMenOver30,3d6kml,h0ttentot,4,Mon Jul 13 23:20:29 2015 UTC,Let me rephrase that part. The person you marry should be like your best friend in the way you interact with each other. It may not be the specific person you think of as your best friend.
AskMenOver30,3d6kml,HoobidyMcBoobidy,3,Mon Jul 13 23:48:21 2015 UTC,Understood and relieved. My other best friend doesn't have a vagina.
AskMenOver30,3d6kml,h0ttentot,4,Tue Jul 14 00:18:59 2015 UTC,"Good reasons:  Deep, abiding, proven love. Someone you know intimately, as they know you-- and are still willing to be with you. A partnership that can overcome any obstacle.  Bad reasons:  Fame, sexual attraction (and nothing else), financial security, loneliness."
AskMenOver30,3d6kml,ec_rider,3,Tue Jul 14 04:56:46 2015 UTC,"Good Where I live in the world, you ain't ever buying a house without two incomes. If you want to have kids you're not going to do that alone, assuming you're a man. Constant companionship. Paired people live longer than singles because you have someone constantly reviewing your behaviour as ""THAT'S the 3rd night this week you've drank"" etc. Bad You do miss your independce. You can get resentful of missed opertunities. Things don't always work out in the long run, and separation can be painful. I don't have the time to list the downsides of having kids (optional in LTRs), but I miss sleep. Humans are probably designed to be serial monoganists. To keep a relationship going requires hard work."
AskMenOver30,3d6kml,EugeneHartke,2,Mon Jul 13 23:50:48 2015 UTC,"Good reasons:   You can't imagine your life without them They make you want to be a better person They add to your happiness and contentment You're compatible sexually, emotionally and lifestyle-wise You're aware of each other's flaws but accept each other exactly as you are   Bad reasons:   You don't want to be alone/co-dependency Pressure from partner/family/peers Confusing sex with love Pregnancy"
AskMenOver30,3d6kml,nankerjphelge,2,Tue Jul 14 12:55:29 2015 UTC,"Good?  They make you feel better, or happier, or just better, or any/all of the above.  Bad?  Sex.  Money.  Looks.  Fame.  Power.    There are more bad reasons than good ones."
AskMenOver30,3d6kml,Dr_Legacy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:10:24 2015 UTC,"Good reason for long term relationship - inherent in this dynamic is the constant need to be accepting, achieve compromise and improve as a human being.
