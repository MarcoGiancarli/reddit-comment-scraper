They did manage to get one to port Stanley when the Argies were there. That was quite a good story."
INGLIN,3d4dw3,Snowy1234,7,Mon Jul 13 15:47:27 2015 UTC,he Vulcans they trained in didn't actually have the range for the journey   Source?  It's my understanding that this is absolutely incorrect and the Vulcans most definitely did have the range to hit targets in Russia - it's what they were designed for.   wasn't designed with air-refuelling equipment..   True of the initial run of B.1s.  B.2s had it as standard and a lot of the B.1s had it fitted as an upgrade.
INGLIN,3d4dw3,IxionS3,0,Mon Jul 13 16:01:47 2015 UTC,"Certainly. Allowing for all weather conditions, the maximum range is 2000 miles (Wikipedia and other similar references)   According to google, the distance between the base and Moscow is 2008 miles.  Even with a prevailing wind they are going to have to ditch in Russia, something they most definitely not trained to do..  Those pilots were the subject of many jokes in flying circles back in the 60s. My dad, a navy pilot back then, was trained to drop nuclear ordnance from both sea vixens and hunters (equipped with huge drop tanks) because the RAF/Vulcans couldn't be relied upon."

Mine says 2607 miles for the B.1.   Even with a prevailing wind they are going to have to ditch in Russia, something they most definitely not trained to do..   From what I've heard the Vulcan pilots on nuclear duty were told to turn south and look for somewhere friendly after dropping, on the grounds that ""home"" probably wouldn't be there any more.  There's a reason there was a hard requirement for them to be able to get airborne in less than 4 minutes.   Those pilots were the subject of many jokes in flying circles back in the 60s.

INGLIN,3ckgc3,NobodyMinus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:21:37 2015 UTC,"It may be a faster plane, but it was significantly less able to shoot down German fighters than the hurricane during the Battle of Britain. Mostly due to its wide and sluggish turning circle.  The kill figures had nothing to do with aircraft numbers, and in fact are skewered towards the spitfire because German pilots were claiming to be shot down by them rather than the hurricane. In dogfights the hurricane was superior in almost every aspect to the spitfire.  The highest overall kill rate in the Battle of Britain went to a Polish hurricane squadron. The next three squadrons were also hurricanes. Also worth noting was the sheer number of explosive cannon shells the hurricane could withstand. The Germans couldn't understand how ineffective their this munition was to a canvas-covered wood frame. In contrast, one canon shell could take out a spitfire. Finally, most damaged Hurricane airframes were easy to repair with simple wood replacement and some fresh canvas. Spitfires required significant bodyshell spares and complex fixing/riveting procedures.  As the German fighters got faster and dogfighting changed to shoot-and-run, the spitfires became more useful than the Hurricanes (which were converted into bombers). At this point though, the spitfires were mostly fighting over France and were losing aircraft 2:1 to the German fighters."

INGLIN,3c8qmz,Geaux12,3,Mon Jul 6 05:47:18 2015 UTC,"Mercia:       The Kingdom of Mercia (Old English: Miercna rīce), usually referred to as Mercia /ˈmɜrsiə, ˈmɜrʃə/, was one of the kingdoms of the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy. The name is a Latinisation of the Old English Mierce or Myrce, meaning ""border people"" (see March).  The kingdom was centred on the valley of the River Trent and its tributaries, in the region now known as the English Midlands.  The kingdom's ""capital"" was the town of Tamworth, which was the seat of the Mercian Kings from at least around AD 584, when King Creoda built a fortress at the town.  For 300 years (between AD 600 and 900), having annexed or gained submissions from five of the other six kingdoms of the Heptarchy (East Anglia, Essex, Kent, Sussex and Wessex), Mercia dominated England south of the River Humber: this period is known as the Mercian Supremacy. The reign of King Offa, who is best remembered for his Dyke which designated the boundary between Mercia and the Welsh kingdoms, is sometimes known as the ""Golden Age of Mercia"". Nicholas Brooks noted that ""the Mercians stand out as by far the most successful of the various early Anglo-Saxon peoples until the later ninth century"",  and some historians, such as Sir Frank Stenton, believe the unification of England south of the Humber estuary was achieved during the reign of Offa.

Although the loss of the Thirteen Colonies marked the end of the ""First British Empire"", it certainly didn't mark the start of colonial decline. Lands in Australia and Canada were gained (and retained, coughcough1812) in the years following 1783. Although the loss of the American colonies were a bit of a hit, it wasn't a crippling blow to Britain or her Empire, and it also encouraged eastwards expansion to Asia and India, establishing what would be come far more prosperous colonies throughout India and gaining more control through conflicts such as Anglo-Mysore wars and Anglo-Maratha wars which would push Britain's, more so the East India Company's economic and military power at the beginning of the 19th century. Also, with Napoleons defeat at Waterloo in 1815 ending the 23 year long state of conflict on the European continent after the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, Britain emerged as the foremost world power. This would be the start of Pax Britannica  that would last until 1914 where Britain was the foremost world power, and the empire expanded, going from strength to strength. The British Empire, as well as European power peaked in about 1922. At this point, a huge majority of the world was under the control of a European nation. It was around this time that the decline of colonisation and Empires began, with India finally being granted independence in 1947. The last country to gain independence was Hong Kong, quite unfairly in 1997.  The end of the First British Empire was brought about by the American Independence, but it certainly didn't hamper Britains expansion, if anything it marked the start of Britain as a world power.

The remaining five series were drawn. As of December 2013 [update], the win–loss ratio in Ashes Tests  (from 1882) stands at 126 wins for Australia to 103 wins for England, with 88 draws.   In the 130 years since 1883, Australia have held the Ashes for approximately 76.5 years, and England for 53.5 years.

INGLIN,38w7mm,tadskis,-1,Mon Jun 8 07:37:08 2015 UTC,"Records show Irish lands exported food even during the worst years of the Famine. When Ireland had experienced a famine in 1782–83, ports were closed to keep Irish-grown food in Ireland to feed the Irish. Local food prices promptly dropped. Merchants lobbied against the export ban, but government in the 1780s overrode their protests. No such export ban happened in the 1840s.   2.The Famine gave considerable impetus to the shift from Irish to English as the language of the majority. Those most gravely affected by the Famine were mostly in Irish-speaking districts, and those districts also supplied most of the emigrants.   3.Island of Ireland's population had fallen to 4.4 million, about the same as the population in 1800 and 2000 and only a half of its peak population 8.5 million. On the other hand, the population of England and Wales doubled from 16 million in 1841 to 32.5 million in 1901.  So pre-famine mostly Gaelic speaking Ireland consisted almost half the population of GB. Problem? Hunger happens, no matter, let them die or run away into America but export food without restrictions. Profit - huge population shift at the expense of Ireland and less trouble for English domination with greatly reduced numbers of those pesky catholic Irish Gaelic speaking troublemakers. They managed to make enough trouble even being decimated in relation to England but imagine what a pain in the ass they could have been if there were 15 million Irish in Ireland in 1900?  That was truly marvelous strategic job, even comrade Stalin took the lesson and repeated it again very successfully after a century in Ukraine when he decided to export crops from there during famine."

World War II of article  Bill Millin:       Millin is best remembered for playing the pipes whilst under fire during the D-Day landing in Normandy.  Pipers had traditionally been used in battle by Scottish and Irish soldiers.  However, the use of bagpipes was restricted to rear areas by the time of the Second World War by the British Army. Lovat, nevertheless, ignored these orders and ordered Millin, then aged 21, to play. When Private Millin demurred, citing the regulations, he recalled later, Lord Lovat replied: ""Ah, but that’s the English War Office. You and I are both Scottish, and that doesn’t apply."" He played ""Hielan' Laddie"" and ""The Road to the Isles"" as his comrades fell around him on Sword Beach.  Millin states that he later talked to captured German snipers who claimed they did not shoot at him because they thought he was crazy.

West Falkland was left abandoned, and Puerto Soledad became mostly a prison camp.[24] Amid the British invasions of the Río de la Plata during the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, the islands' governor evacuated the archipelago in 1806; Spain's remaining colonial garrison followed suit in 1811, except for gauchos and fishermen who remained voluntarily.    So in fact it seems Spain and Britain (Spain, really) were the last countries to settle the Falklands before the Argentine Confederation claimed them.  Then Britain ""reasserted it's claim"" and took the whole archipielago.  To me it sounds like at least the spanish part of the islands should be argentinian."

When ship rigging changed in the 1700s they needed somewhere new to fly the flag from. To do this, they stuck a pole, or staff, in the ship's bow. As it was used to fly the Jack it naturally became known as the jackstaff. So, the jackstaff is so called because the Union Jack flies from it, rather than the flag suddenly changing names because it is being flown from a jackstaff."""

Don't give these fuckheads credibility. They're stupid, moronic, silly, unpleasant thugs. They have no real points to make and most of them would have only began reading politics and following politics 5 minutes before the elections. Any intelligent person would know that the best way to change a society is not through rioting or violent protest, but through peaceful demonstrations, joining and supporting a party (or making one), standing for parliament or becoming an influential persons or journalist or public servant to change things for the way you want. Not, defacing war memorials, clogging up a beautiful public space and assaulting police who are there just doing their jobs."

If the party they voted for (most likely Greens or Labour) got into power, then they wouldn't be ""demonstrating"". So, yes, they are moronic idiots that are just wasting every bodies time.   Sorry, but people who protest like this, I have to assume are idiots. They remind of people chanting on FB, filling a feed with nonsense about something they know nothing about. I gurantee if you go to these people and ask them what they're protesting, they will give you an answer, but the more you let them talk and the more you question them the more they begin to get desperate and the more they contradict themselves. Protesters  are treated with such exaggerated respect, when 99% of the time 90% of them know nothing about politics or world affairs or how governments work. Even protesting in general is treated with exaggerated respect, when it should be looked down upon. Protesting, except for a few general cases, never change anything, usually rioting does and that's why they turn into riots. Even Martin Luther king acknowledged this, protesting is almost always useless and meaningless and a waste of time for everybody. I've already said what the better alternatives are."

But I would definitely suggest you see: 1. The British museum 2. Stonehenge 3. White cliffs of Dover 4. Parliament/Buckingham (the usual Touristy buildings) 5. Angel of the North (which is in the North)  6. The Lake District 7. The Manchester museums (they are all great. They have everything from WW2 planes, to a piece of a World Trade centre to machinery and trains and artifacts) 8. If you like football then I suggest visiting the stadiums that interest you 9. The Roman Baths, it's a building just like the baths in ancient Rome, it's quite interesting 10. Westminster Abbey, which is one of the oldest churches in the entire world and some of the most prominent figures are buried there (Darwin and Newton for example).  If you are more interested in visiting places for of a more fun experience then Chester zoo, Alton Towers, Thorpe Park and the Royal Albert hall may be on your list, but given you are a student I'm assuming you won't be able to just splash money around.   As for your do's and don'ts, just get on with it. People, if they realise you are an immigrant or tourist they will be patient with you and help you out. However, make sure you queue up correctly, it may be a stereotype, but it's a very true one. When you come to an escalator, stand on the right side, if you want to walk up then walk up the left side. If you are in London, then get an oyster card, it's a pay as you go travel card, you can use them for buses, Trains, trams and some national trains. Also, don't expect conversation, it's not considered rude to begin talking to people, but it's just not expected and don't take offence if everybody seems to be ignorant of your existence. Small talk is sometimes okay like when waiting for the bus, but it's usually only about the weather or football at best, it's not like some countries where people will have a full out conversation with you. Politeness however is expected, but this is usually rather universal all over the world, holding the door open for people, not being loud and rude in public, giving your seat to an old lady or pregnant woman, putting your hand up as a gesture of good faith when somebody in a car gives way, I'm sure you already do these things in your own country.   As for that, just enjoy the country. Don't worry too much about it, it isn't as scary as it seems and English culture is pretty easy to pick up on and most people are not sensitive and won't take offence to hardly anything you do, they might scough and tut though. Also, if you are here in the next few days, probably stay away from Downing street for a bit, since there is protests currently going on."

Also if your going to a football match then Man U will be pricy, try a lower league team, cheaper and better atmosphere. Think of it like seeing a bar fight compared to a multi million pound boxing match. If you're thinking of green and pleasant countryside, head for the cotswolds, and for more adventurous terrain the Lake District, Snowdonia, Yorkshire Dales, Scottish Highlands or indeed Dartmoor.   Avoid all 'pubs' advertising 'authentic great British pub food', especially near touristy places. They are not real pubs, they are shitty restaurants for making money, and the food will inevitably be pretty poor. Ask a local for a good pub.   If you're off to Stonehenge, visit Avebury and West Kennet nearby as well (they're actually more interesting imo). Avoid the pub in Avebury (Red Lion), it's a tourist pub as mentioned above."

With regards asking about a pub - yes don't just ask a random person in the street, but if during your travels you do have a conversation with somebody for whatever reason, you should perhaps ask them.   Regards cotswolds - it's pretty stereotypical of English countryside and pretty villages, but not in a bad way. However Britain is full of such landscapes, every County has them if you know where to go. Bare in mind however if you're off the beaten track amenities will be few and far between, after all they are rural villages. Perhaps the best option would be to do a day's walking from one village to the next (buy an Ordnance Survey map). Have a look at the 'Long Distance Footpaths' as the are known - they shall take you to nice places.   The National parks are quite varied in their landscapes, have a look at photos of them on the Internet and you'll get a feel for them. They all have informative Wikipedia pages too of course.
