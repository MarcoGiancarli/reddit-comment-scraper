dynastywarriors,3e1578,deeefoo,2,Tue Jul 21 03:53:44 2015 UTC,"I will definitely buy them soon after launch, assuming we get confirmation that the released versions have PS4 quality or better, and aren't riddled with poor porting bugs/performance issues."
dynastywarriors,3e1578,eleuthria,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:56:27 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping for at least PS4 quality for both PW3 and SW4-II as well. But their most recent two releases have been PS4 version, so maybe they're starting to move on to current-gen ports?"
dynastywarriors,3e1578,eleuthria,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:06:14 2015 UTC,"Which two releases are you referring to?  DW8XLCE and DW8E on Steam were both PS3 versions with a few extra graphical options to improve shaders/shadows, but still using textures that were worse than the PS4 versions."
dynastywarriors,3e1578,Cald3ron,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:57:01 2015 UTC,"I meant Bladestorm:Nightmare and Toukiden Kiwami were the most recent KT ports. They were both ported from the PS4 version, IIRC. Though they had their own share of unique problems.  As for DW8 XL/E, I heard that they also bumped up the enemy count to be higher than the PS4, and that's all I care about really. Give me consistent performance at 60fps (no crashes or bugs) and onscreen enemy count equal to the PS4 or higher, and I couldn't care less if it's a PS3 port. Online has already been confirmed for SW4-II."

Enjoyed them both greatly."
dynastywarriors,3e1578,vox165,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:47:28 2015 UTC,"Most people seem to have no issues with DW8 and Toukiden, but there's just been so much negativity surrounding KT lately that it's making me nervous for PW3, since I'm a huge One Piece Fan.   I've been excited for SW4 ever since I saw the gameplay trailer, and now that it's coming to PC in some shape or form, I'll be more than happy to play it. Thanks for the port review, but I imagine I'll get my hands on it pretty quickly after it comes out, I've been dying to play it."
dynastywarriors,3e1578,knudow,0,Tue Jul 21 05:07:37 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you view the negativity; most (if not all, that this point, thanks to TotalBiscuit) the negativity is being generated because they are making ""bad"" pc ports.  I cannot comment on Bladestorm as I have no personal experience.  However, I see a lot of the negativity for Toukiden because it is 30 fps cap/1080p cap/gamepad required.  I personally have no issues with those. All that means is it runs exactly like it runs on the ps4; if they do that with sw4-2, and it runs exactly like it runs on the ps4, then im golden. KT saved me 400$ (again, first was Toukiden) by making me not have to own a ps4 to play the game.  Regarding PW3, however, BANDAI appears (according to the Steam page) to only be the publisher, while TecmoKoei is the actual developer. I imagine TK will be doing the port, which if dw8xl (which is on the same, if not a similar engine? i believe) is any indication, it will be fine."
dynastywarriors,3e1578,knudow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:34:50 2015 UTC,"You're right, Bandai is only the publisher and Omega Force is still the developer. However, what I'm hoping is that Bandai as the publisher can have some quality assurance, since they said that the Steam and PS4 versions will be equal. If KT ports the PS3 version for whatever weird reason, then I imagine it'll run fine like DW8. But if they port the PS4 version, there might be potential issues, which is why I'm worried.   If PW3 and SW4-II run exactly as it does on PS4, then I'm golden as well. I've already got a gamepad anyway. Plus we get the added benefit of no framerate drops and possibly more enemies onscreen (as with DW8 XL/E). The problem is that KT isn't quite experienced with PS4 ports, I hope they fix any issues with PS4 porting before PW3 and SW4-II come out, then I'll be one happy Musou fan. If we do end up getting the PS3 port for both, if they at least bump up the enemy count to match PS4 and have it run at consistent 60fps, then I'll still be happy."

dynastywarriors,3dvr0u,TheBearAJ,3,Sun Jul 19 22:55:37 2015 UTC,"I have Empires for PS4, but I'm pretty sure it's the same thing. There isn't a real split-screen setting, but if you start an empires mode you can play together during invasions and maybe defenses too. Just make sure to select the other player a character during the screen where it shows you how many troops each character has during the battle. There should be a prompt at the top or bottom of the screen telling you which button and when you can do this (the left and right bumper will be used I believe). If you end up at the screen where you can pick your weapons and look at the battle info before the battle, then it's too late and you will have to wait until the next battle to play together. Hope this helps!"

dynastywarriors,3doozw,Grandy12,4,Sat Jul 18 00:17:04 2015 UTC,Not really.  The only mod I remember for DW8XL was the Japanese voices before the DLC for it came out.
dynastywarriors,3doozw,Wadek001,2,Sat Jul 18 01:04:57 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. Mods come out frequently for the Japanese, Korean, and Chinese versions, which usually do things like give characters new movesets, change their textures, or miscellaneous things like that. The editors used, though, usually only have limited compatibility with the English versions, as the people making them are specifically focusing on Chinese, Japanese, or Korean audiences and only add English compatibility as an afterthought. So, English mods tend to be very limited.  Back in the day, I made a tweaking mod for DW5XL's Traditional Chinese PC version. It was a lot of fun and added things like more varied NPCs without changing core gameplay, but it was impossible to distribute because the data file ended up being well over a gigabyte."

dynastywarriors,3diedm,misturcheef,2,Thu Jul 16 21:31:44 2015 UTC,"Out of the latest DW games, 8 is the best. It simply has the most features and options. You can do almost all the things from 7E in 8E, though it has a slightly different pacing. It takes a little longer to be able to command officers in battle if you are not a ruler compared to 7E. It can take longer to get new weapons and items also, since unlike in 7E where you could just visit town and buy your items, in 8E you have to build these structures in your territory. You don't have the option of building things until prefect, and cannot build outside your assigned territory until making Strategist or Marshall (along with other higher level commands).  In 7E you had a lot more freedom starting straight from Prefect.  I wrote a bit more about a similar inquiry here if you're interested."
dynastywarriors,3diedm,misturcheef,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:25:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe something like 6 or 7 Empires. As an old fan of DW, I'm getting a bad taste in my mouth with the newer games..."

E7 brought back dual weapons, few more maps,boob slider (I would be a farce if I didn't mention it).  CAW's can appear in your battles in which is the best feature since you don't expect it."
dynastywarriors,3dfapv,Carmel_Chewy,5,Wed Jul 15 20:37:12 2015 UTC,Dynasty Warrior spinoff games have always suffered from being a niche within a niche.  The spinoffs have always been pretty fun as a DW fan because they tend to add/change a few things to make them fresh/different from the mainline series.
dynastywarriors,3dfapv,eleuthria,2,Wed Jul 15 21:10:55 2015 UTC,I like DW but i could never get into the whole mecha genre. So when I tried DW Gundam it was kind of cool to see the whole show retold DW style.  Can't say the same about One Piece though.
dynastywarriors,3dfapv,rinwashere,2,Wed Jul 15 21:20:40 2015 UTC,"I personally loved One Piece, so Pirate Warriors was good for me, but it was not a strong title on its own.  It tried a lot of different things (platforming, QTEs, basic puzzles), which didn't fit well with the Dynasty Warriors gameplay.  Pirate Warriors 2 scraps that and goes with traditional DW gameplay.  Pirate Warriors 3 takes that and improves on it even more (my current favorite Warriors game of all).  If you've only tried the first One Piece Pirate Warriors, I highly recommend giving the series another chance with PW2 (or PW3 when it comes out soon, it's even better)."
dynastywarriors,3dfapv,eleuthria,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:30:20 2015 UTC,"I think Hyrule Warriors was a pretty solid game. It did have its own quirks, but it still felt like a true Warriors game, with smooth combat and ridiculous attacks.  SW4 looks to be pretty amazing as well, and very unique with its Hyper Attack system. The characters are more diverse since there are less of them, and their moves and attacks look prettier (a big plus for me), with more reach. I think SW4 is the prettiest Warriors game to date.  Pirate Warriors 3 looks amazing, I'm a huge One Piece fan and it definitely feels like a true Warriors game, with enough quirks to make it One Piece.   I like the spinoff titles much more than the parent series, since they tend to add more of their own things to make them unique."

If you were on the fence and read about it or asked around, the clunky stop and start controls were not popular.  If you play Fist of the North Star you feel the combo system. Very smooth. Gundam was the opposite."
dynastywarriors,3de4dj,Deivid89,2,Wed Jul 15 15:41:58 2015 UTC,"Ive played SW4 a bit, half way through story mode completion, as for Difficulty, I can say it does go up, the game is not really that hard (Not played hardest difficulty yet aside from one battle and got 3 hit KO'd)  There are mutiple story modes, most are short like 4-5 battles, then there are some very long ones, say 8-10 battles approx, it does rank up in difficulty, it shows the number of stars ranging from 1-10 for each battle.   For example, Nobunaga has about 8-10 battles. The last battle is 7 stars out of 10, Battles 8 starts and higher still need to be unlocked in battles that take place later in later story paths.  Hope this helps. :D"
dynastywarriors,3de4dj,SilentJudgement,2,Wed Jul 15 16:41:41 2015 UTC,"Alright thanks a lot! One quick question, would you recommend SW4 or DW8: Xtreme legends?"
dynastywarriors,3de4dj,SilentJudgement,2,Wed Jul 15 17:00:29 2015 UTC,"What platform for you have? Is it DW8XL Complete Addition? If so, that is a better game. I feel SW4 lacks features and has a really boring (subjected to opinions) replayable mode. Otherwise SW4."
dynastywarriors,3de4dj,SilentJudgement,2,Wed Jul 15 17:16:18 2015 UTC,"I would be playing on the Ps4 and most of the time with a buddy but also hoping that single player is fun, I believe it is the full game on the ps store."
dynastywarriors,3de4dj,SilentJudgement,2,Wed Jul 15 17:21:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah its pretty expensive in the store. But the game had content than SW4 and feels more ""modern"", SW4 pretty much plays similar to the older games SW2 for example.  But its down to your choice, if your a fan of the series, you will enjoy either. But as far as coop goes, DW8XL is better, the ""Chronicle Mode"" on SW4 is not coop ( I think)."

(Worst case scenario, you'll just be blindly comboing into enemies while reading) I think that most people who hate subs have this issue, after listening a lot of lines you can make up whether it's a common shout or a relevant dialogue. Sometimes it's actually vital for the stage as your strategist/superior may issue precise instructions for you to follow (DW8/XL), other times, it's just a unique chitchat between generals during the stage (which is always nice to read), most of the time however it's just a shout of praise or mockery between generals and your character. That said, I never regarded dialogues ""important"" per se, but as a nice bonus that adds life to the game."
dynastywarriors,3d0yul,Chinoko,2,Sun Jul 12 22:40:00 2015 UTC,"I grew up reading subtitles a lot, particularly Japanese media, so I'm able to understand very short phrases and dialogue. But when the lines are longer, yes it does kinda distract me as I have read it while slaughtering enemies. The in-game dialogue is usually more important to the individual mission, since they give you status updates and objectives."
dynastywarriors,3d0yul,deeefoo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:30:30 2015 UTC,"In DW8, I normally don't read the non-story texts since the translation is wrong (I defeated an officer becomes ""They now understand the importance of strategy""). During gameplay, the text is readable enough that it's not so hard to read it while killing people. I think 3/4 of the text is important though since they help understand the story and are hints for the star goals."

This takes some getting used to; you'll have to figure out how to cancel combos so you can attack the enemy you want to attack.  It's a good idea to play as the commander whenever you can so that you don't have to worry about saving their butt. I remember playing the Nanman Campaign, Wu side, as Sun Ce, and the only reason I didn't lose after all of my allies got wrecked was because playing as any of the Sun family in that level causes them to be the commander.  If you manage to get 1,000 KOs, your entire army's morale skyrockets, and they become essentially unbeatable."

dynastywarriors,3cdzbd,sohoodnerd,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:59:40 2015 UTC,"I think this only applies for capturing a specific base, not capturing a number of total bases."
dynastywarriors,3cdzbd,novembr,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:16:33 2015 UTC,"I'll give a ""general"" answer, hoping to cover all situations:  (source: I play lots of 2p with my bro as well)  To meet those objectives you need to flip a base to your colour in person. Either player may do it, it is a joint effort. But it must be a human player. It can be the same base more than once, if the enemy flipped it back during the battle.  The 3 base objective is within 15 minutes. The 4 base objective is within 10 minutes. Specific Base is within 3 minutes.  A base is always credited to the human player ""if present"", even if you don't swing your weapon/instrument/implement/foodstick once."

With the consoles as strong as they are now it's really hard to get excited for a new DW or SW game, even when they do improve aspects of them from game to game. I would love a game where I play one character and go through more of a story driven mission. There are so many characters now that they are loosing their personality, they have gone from prominent rolls to showing up in one or two cutscenes. You seem to learn more about the characters now from the narrator now than you do from the videos and gameplay. Now I just feel like I am griding trying to level up characters there are so many, and no longer feel like trying to max them out is a worthwhile goal."
dynastywarriors,3c9dlu,otheranotherbrother,2,Mon Jul 6 07:17:01 2015 UTC,"the original Samurai Warriors I felt stood out because it did an amazing job of blending story with hack and slash. Numerous stages and branching paths for every warrior, and within each stage there were multiple paths of victory/defeat. It really made me feel connected to the warriors, and it was so cool seeing all the different ways the stories could play out.  2 I noticed a shift away from this, and then once I read about 3 and watched some videos, I quit buying SW games altogether, and stuck to Dynasty Warriors.  I haven't played 4, so I can't speak there.  But I really wish they'd go back to how they did things in the first one, even if it meant less characters, I want that deeper amount of storytelling and alternative paths again."

It had a shrunken roster, but it was a lot of fun to play. You were scored on how quickly you cleared each batch of enemies, and it was much tougher than standard DW games.  It's not quite like DW for the PSP, as there are no bodyguards, the roster is a lot smaller, there's weapon collection, and there aren't any special forts or bases or anything to conquer, but it's still a really neat game with some nice touches.  The DS game, though, is pretty universally looked down upon. You don't even play as any of the Dynasty Warriors characters."

dynastywarriors,3b8pro,jakerfv,7,Fri Jun 26 21:46:23 2015 UTC,"Dynasty Warriors 8 XL Complete Edition is only missing one component the PS3 version had: Online multiplayer. It has never promised to have DLC that was released after DW8XLCE's release. The name itself is a giant screwup on the localization's part, I'll give you that, but it should never have been expected to include DLC that was made and released after DW8XLCE's release ON CONSOLES. To think otherwise puts you in the same category of worth as the Steam Forums.  Dynasty Warriors 8 Empires had DLC at launch, yes, but if you owned the equivalent DLC in Dynasty Warriors 8 XLCE, you automatically got that content in DW8E without paying anything extra. At launch, there was... $10 in new DLC. Specifically, the ""Edit Parts - Face, Hair, and Accessary Pack"". It was even specifically noted which DLC carries over on BOTH THE DW8E DLC LISTING AND THE DW8XLCE DLC LISTING. So ""Tons of extra DLC""? I have not bought any DLC for DW8E yet and I have full access to the content in 12 of the 13 DLC items that DW8E launched with.  The whole ""We need to criticize KOEI to get them to improve"" thing... won't work. They already know they can sell very well on consoles, if they decide porting causes too much damage to their reputation... they're not gonna port it. at all.

dynastywarriors,3aknux,RonRizzo,11,Sun Jun 21 03:26:03 2015 UTC,"Japanese names of the period were somewhat fluid, where you had a childhood name, then were given one by a parent when you reached maturity, or were rechristened by a superior, or took a courtesy name, or made a life changing decision, and so on. So I'll focus on the times of his life when Hideyoshi had a name change.   Not much is known of his early life, but he was born of a peasant footman. As a young man, he first joined the Imagawa clan for a time under the name Kinoshita Tokichiro, then returned to his home province of Owari to join the Oda clan as a lowly manservant, of course under Nobunaga Oda.   In 1564, he distinguished himself as a negotiator, convincing or bribing several retainers of the rival Saito clan of Mino. Then he played a large part in the siege of Inabayama Castle in 1567, and became known as one of Nobunaga's most capable generals, taking the name Hideyoshi Hashiba.   Finally, after Nobunaga's assassination as Honno-ji Temple, when he was at the height of his power, he arranged to have himself adopted by the Fujiwara clan, close to the imperial seat of power, and acquired the title of imperial regent. He was thereby formally given the name Hideyoshi Toyotomi by the imperial court in 1584.  So as you can see, the name he was known by that is most relevant to the part of the Sengoku Period before the rise of the Tokugawa clan to power is Hideyoshi Hashiba, general of the Oda, though he is most remembered as Hideyoshi Toyotomi, one of the three great unifiers of Japan.   Perhaps his name changes over time as you progress within the game? That would be cool.   Source: Wikipedia."

There are more variations in the way the game proceeds and the story line is determined by how you rule. Leveling is kept within your current empire. Every time you start a new empire, the stats reset (there is an option to carry over weapons/skills etc. at the cost of points). Character creation adds an interesting aspect to the game but didn't change the game play too much. I personality enjoy the regular dynasty warriors more, it's more straight forward hack n slash, stress relieving kind of game I like."

Same hack-and-slash formula, lots of new gameplay mechanics, such as weapon elemental stats, and character specific move-sets. If you're into the Three Kingdoms history, then you'll be disappointed with the way they tell it in 8. IMO, they did a much better job at explaining the history in 2-4. All in all, if you liked 4, you're probably going to love 8. Just be prepared to scratch your head at points in the game if you have no prior knowledge of the historical events, because they do a poor job at being descriptive as to why certain things are happening."
dynastywarriors,3a7pf0,Mr_Garfunkle,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:22:57 2015 UTC,8 is generally enjoyable but there are a lot of differences from 4.   Peons are dumbed down because of their sheer numbers in 8. Generals are basically bigger mooks and aren't real threats as they don't seem to know how to use their own movesets. (The higher difficulties only lengthens their life bars and increase their damage) Character design as well as the gameplay is a lot more anime-ish   If you don't mind all these changes I'd say go for it.
dynastywarriors,3a0gsm,iamragnar,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:56:56 2015 UTC,"I don't have a PS4, but I think Pirate Warriors 3 will be a fun co-op game. I played Pirate Warriors 2 co-op with a friend, and it was a blast. Given the anime nature of the game, it is a bit more over-the-top than the parent Dynasty Warriors series, but that's what makes it fun.  Samurai Warriors 4 looks like it can be a good co-op game as well, since the gameplay actually incorporates having 2 characters be in 2 places at once, which I think could work well with co-op."
dynastywarriors,3a0s50,AleksVin,2,Tue Jun 16 09:36:43 2015 UTC,"Okay herer's a few I can think of at the top of my head.   First: When going to fuse your machine's plans keep the one that have equipped on it's own. Use the best of the other plans and fuse all the lesser one to it first then fuse that into your main plan. It prevents the main plan from becoming max upgraded with negligible stats. Unless of course a new plan is better. Also only upgrade the special equipment if your near the end of a plans upgrade number and you won't be getting a new one soon.  Secondly: Be aware some suits/machines have certain strengths and weakness' and should use plans accordingly. I.E. Epyon with a very heavy melee plan or either Freedom with Shot heavy plans.   Third: Be aware of what ""level"" suits you're using. Grunts have very limited movesets and generally weaker than any MC suit/gundam. Using certain skills can help you bypass those weakness' though.

dynastywarriors,39tvdd,TheMistyHaze,16,Sun Jun 14 18:51:19 2015 UTC,"Personally, I hope they incorporate some gameplay elements from their other Warriors titles, such as  -being able to lock the camera onto named enemies (HW and PW)  -being able to dodge/roll (HW and PW)  -dashing/sprinting (HW and PW)  -maybe Hyper Attacks from SW4  -being able to simultaneously control more than one character on the battlefield (SW)  -increased general mobility during combat  -more range to attacks, more AOE options  That's pretty much it from me, other things such as the story aren't as important to me as gameplay."

dynastywarriors,39tvdd,deeefoo,1 point,Mon Jun 15 05:55:45 2015 UTC,"I'd love to see hyper attacks in the next DW game but I want them to change a few details. I think that EX attacks for the hyper moveset would a good personal addition.   Secondly, a different method to activating hyper attacks. In SW it would only take the place of another combo. It wouldn't work for DW because the first strong attack often has a useful function. For most characters, it's a guard break and for other characters (eg Guan Yu and Xiahou Ba) it's a useful ability unique to that weapon, even being listed in their descriptions. Plus, it would prevent a lot of annoying EX attack reshuffling. I suggest that their should be a button specifically for swapping hyper and normal movesets. Maybe even a special ability like the shadow sprint which can immediately swap to the hyper moveset during a strong attack."

dynastywarriors,39tvdd,Organizing_Secrets,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:57:53 2015 UTC,"Samurai Warriors 4 added them.  It's basically an alternate set of attacks that begin with your special (triangle/Y) instead of your regular (square/X).  Every character has an entire hyper attack moveset, but they're completely different from regular attacks.  These attacks are designed for clearing regular enemies.  They involve significant and fast movement and large area of effect.  They don't work at all against officers.  It basically means there is no such thing as a ""brawler"" type officer where they are designed for 1v1 and suck at clearing enemies.  Every officer is capable of obliterating a battlefield (and next-gen systems mean more enemies than ever)."

Bring back the musou campaigns reminiscent of DW2-5, they (more or less), accurately told the history of the Three Kingdoms era and it actually felt like you were a part of an army, as opposed to you BEING the army. (In DW8xl I often times wonder how a battlefield can feel and be so empty). I did like the hypothetical scenarios, if they could incorporate that into a DW2-5 musou mode it would be amazing.   None of my problems with the more recent games have anything to do with game mechanics, but more so on what they've done to the history behind the series. Just the other day, for example, I was watching the cutscene in DW8xl where Liu Bei receives news of Guan Yu's death, and I couldn't help but think how much more impactful the very same scene was in DW5. The story in DW6+ is...lacking."

If so, I would certainly support the re-addition of duels.  I also wholeheartedly agree that characters less obsessed with the (dreaded) theme of benevolence should be added to Shu. Indeed, Shu as a whole should probably take a shift away from its obsession with benevolence, as it has been getting annoying.  I'm not sure why you would want to remove Zuo Ci. I've always liked him, and he spices up the roster a bit. I just hope that he's more integrated into the overall story next time (not the actual story of the kingdoms, but perhaps something akin to Lu Bu's story in 8 Xtreme Legends).  And Yuan Shu we can probably expect to be added sometime soon. Seriously, people have been asking for him forever. I do however hope that Yuan Shao retains his current personality and that Yuan Shu gets a slightly different personality than him so that they can be told apart."

All the others are cheaper, even well known titles such as Just Cause 3, Call of Duty Black Ops III and Might and Magic Heroes VII.  On top of that, people both tend to expect lower prices on PC games (whether due to a lower base price, frequent sales even for new games or something like GreenManGaming with it's discount vouchers), lower prices on games which aren't 'big names' (the fact that this is more expensive than CoD: Black Ops III is amazing) and lower prices on ports of existing games."

I was just wondering, I thought the system would search for content/DLC based on the GameID (which contains the region info, I haven't checked if this code is in the box though), but considering it appeared on both region PSNs, my guess is that it's searching for the content via name?  Well, since I can't see it right now, I'll have to wait, but seems like I have a 50/50 chance of making it work, since now I know that I may have a Canadian version (Now that I think about it, I think the back was written in french, but my memory may be failing me right now), which would probably work, or the EU version, which won't."

dynastywarriors,38tscs,wiseman207,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:14:02 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  A war simulation DW:E is not.  It really just serves as the mechanic for serving up custom forces/battles/scenarios.  Territorial expansion is really just a heavily stylized weapon/tech tree.  I don't know how deep the simulation goes, but it seems to be pretty scattershot, lots of rubber-banding from the AI as far as troop counts go, etc.    That being said: You CAN tumble backward and even lose if you're not careful, though.  You CAN make subsequent battles easier by launching raids first.  You can bank resources (gold/materials) to give you an edge in big battles.  General strategy for the hardest difficulties: the more time passes, the more resources you have.  Release low-level generals to save money.  Get good weapons.  If you don't have a healing strategem, get one of those too... strategems replace items in DW8E.   Once income starts outstripping monthly cost, you can stop playing risky defense missions and use repairing to stop the threat of losing from invasion."

XL is essentially an expansion pack.  There are a few notable differences in the combat system, but since you've probably not played it in a while, you most likely won't have to unlearn old habits. If you remember the old Musou attack, that ended up getting moved to your rage mode musou attack (see the tutorial), and outside of rage mode, you have 3 different musou attacks that eat up one bar of musou each."

Exploring the history of a different culture was the whole reason I got into DW and SW in the first place (""history""). However, African nations seem less likely to record history on the same level as China and Japan, therefore it might be difficult to craft a playable story. You've got oral history, sure, but it might be a challenge to create an entire roster of characters who have interwoven storylines (fighting on opposing sides of the battlefield, etc).  That being said, I would still play a game where weapons were more tribal and the setting was much different.

In China/Japan's case, there are recordings that were indeed very rooted into their tradition, especially in Japan's case. I am probably misinformed, but many traditions and history were taken away by radical changes, especially colonizations: I'm sure Native Americans have their own amazing stories of battles and myths, Aztecs as well, South-East Asiatic civilizations too, etc... I would love a hack&slash game of the Slavs against Mongols for one, with both historical and fictional events from the bylinas. I'm ashamed that the museum isn't focusing the pre-colonial period of Africa as much yet after coming to respect different cultures from different rulers/countries I mostly learnt from Civilization games (I think Polynesian ruler Kamehameha has by far most epic story background, mixing myths and history) I don't think any culture ""deserves"" anything over another, as much as I like ancient history and folklore myself."

It has what you liked about Hyrule Warriors, but a much bigger cast with much more variety in attacks (each character is very unique).  Pirate Warriors 2 would be my recommendation for a game that's out right now.  Pirate Warriors 3 if you're not in a hurry (comes out in a few months).  EDIT:  The DW Gundam games are also good in my opinion, but they seem to be a ""love it or hate it"" series for most Dynasty Warriors fans.  I heavily recommend the Pirate Warriors games (#2 and #3, #1 not nearly as much) over the Gundam games (which I also would say #2 and #3, and Reborn, not so much the first one)."

dynastywarriors,38lz39,Nikrane,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:11:07 2015 UTC,"Hard question to answer as somebody who has watched the anime, but I think from a pure gameplay standpoint it will be enjoyable.  I'm a bit more confident in that because I'm able to fully enjoy PW3 (calling my my favorite Warriors game to date) even though my knowledge of Japanese is extremely limited.  The gameplay alone is top notch.  However, this does remind me of one detail that may be a dealbreaker:  Pirate Warriors 2 is not dubbed, so all voice acting is still in Japanese.  Everything else is translated, they just didn't do english voice overs."
dynastywarriors,38lz39,eleuthria,2,Fri Jun 5 16:25:23 2015 UTC,"I was in the same boat as you, with Hyrule Warriors being my first Warriors game. Since HW is one of the newer entries in the series, it has a bit more polish and the older games may not feel the same. HW has the dashing mechanic and smoother attack animations, which made the pacing feel just right. I've tried DW8XL and SW3, and it just didn't feel quite the same.   However, Pirate Warriors may be what you're looking for. It's the most similar to HW in terms of gameplay mechanics and over-the-topness. It's got the same dashing mechanic, as someone here mentioned, as well as the ability to lock the camera onto named enemies just like in HW (honestly I don't know why all Warriors titles didn't implement these yet). The characters are very diverse and colorful, each with unique movesets. The environment and setting is cool as well. Due to the anime nature of the game, you can expect over-the-top attack animations that will make the Great Fairy dropping the moon look normal. I would say to wait for PW3 to come out in a couple months, since 3 will cover the main story of the anime. Word of caution, the games will spoil the series for you, if you're okay with that. Here's some gameplay footage of all the playable characters   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DRHlrhSMUU  SW4 also looks promising, though I haven't had the chance to try it myself yet, unfortunately.  But by looking at gameplay videos, it looks awesome. Combat in this one is even faster than in HW, thanks to the Hyper Attack system. There's also the whole leveling up, capturing bases, finding weapons, though most of that is in every Warriors game. Attacks in this game are also more over-the-top than its DW counterparts. Here's some gameplay footage   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0FMjOL-l9Y  I'm really excited that PW3 and SW4-II (the sequel) are coming to Steam this summer, since the Wii U's the only home console I have. As you can probably tell, I love over-the-topness in these games, which is why I'm mainly focused on HW, SW4, and PW. You should definitely check them out."

dynastywarriors,38jsrj,knudow,2,Thu Jun 4 19:14:24 2015 UTC,There's co-op and versus.  Co-op is simple enough. Fighting together as allies in story mode. A 2nd player can join player 1's game.  Versus apparently has you leading squads against each other. There are a few different modes. IIRC they were variations of capture a location and defeat more things than the opponent.

dynastywarriors,37zfka,jws1995,4,Sun May 31 18:27:45 2015 UTC,"I agree. warriors orochi 3  Edit: just a heads up though; its subbed not dubbed. If that's not a deal breaker you'll love it. And the co op can be a little frustrating to set up, but is fine once you're playing. Also, you control 3 characters by instantly swapping between the three  Second edit: after dw5 they stopped making the story mode about individual characters. Everyone misses that. Now the story mode is done by kingdoms. In the case of Warriors orochi, it's one long campaign. But very fun. The reason I'm listing all these caveats is because dw5, in my opinion, was the pinnacle of the series. im not saying the new games are bad. But they a very different from what they were"
dynastywarriors,37zfka,luthin2000,3,Sun May 31 19:23:38 2015 UTC,"As for creating your own character, the DW games have nixed Destiny mode, unfortunately, which is what it sounds like you are describing. The closest you'll come to for creating your own character is either one of the Empires games or Samurai Warriors 4, which has a mode where you can play as a created character.  Some are suggesting Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate, and it's true that it is one of the most robust musou games (I always gush over Gauntlet mode), but know that it is sort of a crossover game between DW and SW with ""fantasy"" elements, and is not historical in any meaningful way.  Most warriors games still have co-op multiplayer."
dynastywarriors,37zfka,novembr,2,Mon Jun 1 00:31:12 2015 UTC,Empires 8 could be for you. That said Samurai Warriors 4 is a fantastic game and well worth your time. I've seen it pretty cheap second hand too.
dynastywarriors,37zfka,Basuru,2,Mon Jun 1 10:08:45 2015 UTC,DW7 for story. DW8 + XL for gameplay. DW8E is a lot better than DW7E.  Sw4 is also fantastic.   Is recommend DW8 as it is mope complete and fun.   Not played WO3. Can't compare.
dynastywarriors,37zfka,SilentJudgement,2,Mon Jun 1 14:26:39 2015 UTC,"For Xbox 360, I would recommend Warriors Orochi 3 as the ""best"" Warriors game for that platform.  Dynasty Warriors 8 being the fallback if you are set on a more historically grounded game (WO3 takes the characters but not the setting)."
dynastywarriors,37zfka,eleuthria,1 point,Sun May 31 19:13:59 2015 UTC,"Hi JWS1995.  From the things you are mentioning it seems like you might enjoy a game like Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires. In empires you can create your own character and choose to server under a kingdom or rise to power and start your own.  If you want to try something new Warriors Orochi 3 provides a new feel and addition to the game. It has characters from DOA, Samurai Warriors, Dynasty warriors and a few others but adds a crazy mix to the battle.  If you have any interest in the Sengoku Period (warring period) of Japan i would highly recommend the upcoming game Samurai Warriors 4-II. I have personally tried the Japanese version and like it a lot :P."

dynastywarriors,37qtup,Dead_Kaiser,5,Fri May 29 17:38:35 2015 UTC,I like 7 better. 8 has a weird level system that makes chaos mode incredibly tedious.
dynastywarriors,37qtup,CuTEwItHoUtThEe,2,Fri May 29 18:06:14 2015 UTC,"7E was good but 8E has some improvements that would be hard to give up afterwards. I like the leveling system more, but being an officer isn't as appealing.   While you do get to do most of the same things as an officer as in 7E, it can take longer. In 7E as a prefect you could decide who goes into what battle, meaning as long as you made it to prefect, you could command the battle. In 8E, you can't choose who goes into battle until a higher rank if the ruler is participating, I believe (e.g. strategist or marshal). So for a while if the ruler is participating in the battle, you can't issue orders. Overall, though, officers can pretty much do all the same stuff as in 7E that I know of, the pacing of it is just different. Edit: One thing I do miss, was in 7E you could make ""deals"" (I forget the specific action name) with groups in your kingdoms to trade one type of resource to gain more of another; these are gone in 8E, unless hiding under a different name/function that I haven't encountered yet, but I don't think so--at least not for officers.  Getting better weapons can be a pain too, since you have to wait until you get a high enough rank to build the requisite buildings for better items/weapons/strategies (7E had a town where you simply bought them all). Initially as a prefect you can only build in your own territory (again, until you make strategist or marshal), which is only 2 buildings. The A.I. ruler will not build these for you, or I've never seen it, anyway. This makes the new ""quest"" system necessary for gaining good weapons early in the game (and since it's seemingly random, you may have to take and use weapons you may not choose otherwise). Quests are also good for raising friendship, but for some reason the option for them goes away once you make prefect. I guess so they can't be abused? Dunno.  Stratagems have their own gauge in 8E, not just one-use. There are more of them and they are more flexible, such as placing offensive towers anywhere and not just in bases. The downside to this is that I think they slowed the filling of gauges to offset this advantage, also making the items/bonuses which affect gauges more appealing.  Also, just the standard combat improvements that DW8 brought, in general. That should not be understated.  Really, there are just so many small changes that it's hard to go through them all. These are just off the top of my head. I'll add more if I think of them. I will say that everyone may not like some of the changes, but the game does feel more challenging than Warriors games have felt in the past. Depending on your own feelings towards these games, that could be good or bad.  Edit: I also really like the map layouts of 8E more than 7E. I noticed that in 8E, the layouts are more strict and tactical, i.e. the route needed to take to get from one base to the next isn't as multi-faceted as it was in 7E, where the maps were more symmetrical or even. This can make things hectic when you have to defend/attack a particular base in a hurry, as you'll have to consider the best route. Some may not like this (especially those who want DW to go back to DW3's more ""open"" maps), but I think it works better for the Empire games than the standard Warriors games. Zipping from one base to the next isn't always as easy as it once was.  Edit2: 8E also has a fatigue function, meaning officers (including you) who fight too much will see lowered stats until they rest up. Some people might hate this, I think it makes sense, but not sure of it was included to be ""realistic"" or for balancing reasons, or both."
dynastywarriors,37qtup,novembr,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:27:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much for your reply, I ended up purchasing DW8E and I am enjoying it a lot so far! I have some other questions, would you mind giving me your opinion?  I first played on Normal, and it was very easy. So I created another officer to play on Hard and (used bonus points to Start at Level 10, but I used a different weapon so I didn’t mind using bonus points to unlock all Weapons) and it was easy too. So I started on Chaos, used bonus points to Start at Level 10, unlocked Weapons/Items and… it is easy too.  Am I supposed to use these Bonus Points or do they take away the challenge? I thought since it was a game mechanic, I should use these bonus points for higher difficulties to maintain a challenge curve but it seems they kinda ruin it. I noticed enemies they do more damage to me in Chaos, but that is about it – no changes in aggressiveness when playing on the Tactical Map, they don’t Plunder me, they don’t Betray me or stuff like that.  1 - The question: is there a “challenge” way to play this game? Maybe the expert player does not use the bonus points limit themselves to a handicap like not changing weapons on battle? Please, I’m not bragging, I’m just trying to know if the veteran player have a well-established-way to challenge themselves in the game :)  2 - Regarding events (the cutscenes), could you let me know if there are more in 8E? I got these:     Love confession, sworn sibling, succeeded a ruler, betrayed a ruler, assassinated a ruler, escorted a ruler, infiltrated a vault, defended a city, banished (after withdraw a battle when betraying a ruler), had a lot of buildings, raised my own banner, preparation for a last battle and unified China.   3 – Can I save or set online Vagabond units as Favorites to appear on my game again later? It was very fun to see the Tekken Team as a Vagabond Unit to rise up to power by dominating a city. And also to see Persona 4 characters on the battlefield (very good design, congratulations to whoever you are!).  4 - What about 7E, are there more of these cutscenes or in-game decisions? I heard you can appoint your own Five Tiger Generals in 7E, like you could in Romance of the Three Kingdoms.  5 – If I enjoyed 8E, should I play 7E or will it feel like a dumbed down version of 8E?  6 – Have you created any Custom Scenarios? Can I download yours and play? How? :D"
dynastywarriors,37qtup,novembr,2,Mon Jun 8 12:49:33 2015 UTC,"Well, to a competent player of the game, who knows all the skills and tricks to keep from dying or from being overrun, the DW games, including Empire, aren't incredibly challenging. But, yes, I'd say don't touch the bonus points if you want more of a challenge.  As for the events, I think you covered most of them. I'm not certain of exactly how many there are, honestly. Maybe Google would be a better option...the answer may be out there somewhere.  I think I remember seeing an option for saving CAWs you encounter in 7E, but haven't attempted it in 8E yet. I believe it involved accessing the save file for the campaign you saw them in from the CAW screen somewhere. Sorry I'm unable to check at the moment.  Again, I'm unsure of the cutscenes or special events in either game off the top of my head.  I think if you played 7E after 8E it will feel a little limited, except that you are able to start commanding your own officers a bit quicker. You can gain money and resources more quickly and your gauges fill at the speed of normal DW games (again, quicker), so if you find 8E too easy then I think 7E will just end up feeling like a cakewalk to you. Stratagems are fewer and more restrictive in 7E, too, though healing stratagems only being one-use does add a little more difficulty, but that's offset by being able to use musou much more frequently. Overall, a lot of people complain that 8E didn't change things up enough, but on the other hand it changed enough to where it's hard to go back to 7E. If you already had 7E I'd say don't bother upgrading unless you really love Empires and had money to burn, or wait for a sale. And I certainly wouldn't recommend going backwards from 8E unless you reeeeally love Empires and just want a slightly different experience.  No, I haven't created any scenarios myself. If it were more robust than it is, like having a battlefield editor, I'd probably be more inclined."

In Pirate Warriors 2, Whitebeard's 2-bar musou attack (or dual power Blackbeard's 1-bar musou which was the same) would clear out 100+ enemies.  Basically any enemy within double the draw distance.  In Pirate Warriors 3...just about every character seems to be capable of clearing 30-50 enemies in a single combo, but that's probably due to Pirate Warriors 3 having the highest enemy density of any Musou game (or at least it feels that way since most maps end with 2500-3500 KOs)."

dynastywarriors,3723s0,themilo540,3,Tue Jul 7 07:51:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the earlier DW games were much better in that regard, where foot soldiers would do more than form a half-circle around you in a perfect arc for you to rain down godly judgment upon them.  They'd actually fully surround and knock you around if you weren't careful, and going up against officers while they had foot soldiers still alive around them was a hell of a lot more dangerous as a result."
dynastywarriors,3723s0,eleuthria,3,Sun May 24 08:00:15 2015 UTC,The difficulty really was toned down as the later ones came wasn't it....
dynastywarriors,3723s0,ShadoWalker3065,3,Mon May 25 07:10:49 2015 UTC,Same here. The later series just doesn't capture the scale either. Some of the battles still feel grander and more epic in scale in DW3 compared to 8. The maps for 8 are just so maze-like and too many small coridors. I want the grand plains back with numerous ways to an objective. Plus the elephants were really cool.
dynastywarriors,3723s0,ShadoWalker3065,2,Mon May 25 07:13:10 2015 UTC,I love you

dynastywarriors,3723s0,709zzy,1 point,Sat May 30 16:54:03 2015 UTC,I'm not going by the Japanese standard so DW 3= North American DW 3 not Shin Sangokumusou 3.
dynastywarriors,3723s0,Mudcrab_Hustler,3,Sat May 30 17:40:38 2015 UTC,"Although DW4 is my favourite, I can understand not wanting to play it because it's pretty old. If you want a good DW game that has great storytelling, decent gameplay and better graphics then I would recommend DW7. DW8 has even better gameplay but the storytelling is very weak, I think probably because they already did a great job of that in DW7 so gameplay was more focused in 8."

The battles were pretty boring, and the whole formation system could've used a little more work. Would've also been nice if they had waited for XL, so we could've had a bigger cast of characters. The music in different regions in the empire screen was the best part of the game for me."

dynastywarriors,36micz,instantwinner,3,Wed May 20 20:39:43 2015 UTC,"From what I can tell, it has different stories from the original and a challenge mode instead of chronicle mode. So it's not the same game, more of a re-imagining."

Map moral plays a huge role in level difficulty, so the changes to Hyper attacks will make a big difference.   I bought SW4 pre-owned for £15 and have put about 50 hours into it, so it's worth it if you will have the time to get that monies worth before SW4-II comes out."

Its sales pitch is to present the ""perfect version"" of the title, words which are reminiscent to Chronicle 2nd's marketing. The producer adds that it is ""another side"" of the same game, neither a continuation nor a Xtreme Legends expansion. It is the last title to celebrate the series's tenth anniversary. The first 100,000 people to reserve the title received an Ii themed microfiber towel. Buy the game new to receive an idol outfit for Naotora. Other outfits are available at various Japanese stores. The Treasure Box edition includes a picture frame, clock, 56 character cards, and an original soundtrack CD.

dynastywarriors,36micz,AceYousef,2,Thu May 21 15:47:06 2015 UTC,"I think the best one to start is DW4, I dont know why you should start sooner in the series, since they pretty much have the same story.   DW5 is my personal favorite, but I think it's an hard place to start, because DW5 focus on characters and not on the 'general story'. So if you dont know any characters, maybe you will be lost"
dynastywarriors,36micz,KoeiTecmoAmerica,5,Thu May 21 18:02:05 2015 UTC,Hi Ace & Bolak.  Going back to the roots of the game can be enjoyable but you have to remember the games take some time investment to unlock all the joys of the game. Each version has differences and if you're relatively new to series i would just jump into the later versions. I think its a great time to jump into any of the games in the series.   @Bolack I personally would wait for Samurai Warriors 4-II.
dynastywarriors,36micz,ShadoWalker3065,1 point,Thu May 21 21:15:26 2015 UTC,Will samurai warriors 4II contain all the content from the previous game? I sold my ps3 some time ago so I don't own a console to play the previous samurai warriors game. Also will a normal dw can be able to jump into it expecting similar gameplay with different characters/settings??
dynastywarriors,36micz,KoeiTecmoAmerica,2,Mon May 25 07:25:43 2015 UTC,"Hi Shado,  I'm not sure what you're trying to say. However  Samurai Warriors 4-II has improved on and evolved from previous versions. Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors have differences in mechanics and style. However if you have experience with Dynasty Warriors games I'm pretty sure you won't have a problem with this :)."

dynastywarriors,3613b5,DJKazumaMartinez,6,Fri May 15 05:15:08 2015 UTC,"First of all, Wu needs some love. They went from being the biggest kingdom to the smallest. Just because Koei is terrible at integrating them into the story doesn't mean that they should suffer because of it.  That being said:  Wei:   Bian Shi (Cao Cao's wife/Cao Pi's mother) Cao Hong Cao Rui Man Chong   Wu:   Cheng Pu Lu Kang Sun Shi (Sun Ce's daughter/Lu Xun's wife) Xu Sheng Zhuge Jin   Shu:   Liao Hua Zhou Cang (I don't care if he's fictional) Zhang Yi Nobody else because Shu has enough people and I don't want Ma Yunlu   Jin:   Jia Nanfeng Sima Yan Yang Hu   Other:   Yuan Shu"
dynastywarriors,3613b5,ScubaSteeeve,3,Fri May 15 05:23:06 2015 UTC,"Solid choices over all to be honest, I still don't understand why they didn't implement most of these warriors in previous games over the waifus and the not that plot driven sons of Shu officers over someone like Ma Su or Liao Hua."
dynastywarriors,3613b5,XinZhaoYun,3,Sat May 16 01:03:27 2015 UTC,The female characters are understandable (Xingcai is the only one to come really out of left field). They give the cast more diversity. It would be really boring to have just a bunch of burly warriors and pretty boys.
dynastywarriors,3613b5,ScubaSteeeve,2,Sat May 16 03:44:40 2015 UTC,"Well you've got a point, but I really feel like they should've invested in more plot heavy characters like Yuan Shu."
dynastywarriors,3613b5,XinZhaoYun,3,Sat May 16 10:59:52 2015 UTC,"I would have rather had Yuan Shu than Zuo Ci, Guan Suo, Bao Sanniang, and Lianshi, but those characters do add a lot of diversity to the cast in terms of gameplay and personality. Hopefully, they can manage both a diverse cast and more important characters now."
dynastywarriors,3613b5,ScubaSteeeve,2,Sat May 16 18:27:25 2015 UTC,I second any decision to get Cheng Pu and more Jin characters and characters for Jin to fight

dynastywarriors,3613b5,kanata665,2,Sun May 17 01:25:53 2015 UTC,I agree with what you said about how Koei has treated Wu in Dynasty Warriors.
dynastywarriors,3613b5,Basuru,7,Wed May 20 07:39:47 2015 UTC,"I want Hua Xiong dammit! He always seemed so cool in 4 but hasn't gotten any love since. Also Cheng Pu. He's essentially in Wu friend zone. Important enough to be in the majority of the games, but not enough to be a playable officer."
dynastywarriors,3613b5,Whiplash91,2,Fri May 15 06:41:16 2015 UTC,Freaking Cheng Pu needs some love and its like several games where he shouldve been here for a LONG time. Lu Bu now has a story so Hua Xiong sounds like a cool candidate

dynastywarriors,35wz89,NENhancer,20,Thu May 14 05:14:58 2015 UTC,Open maps! No more maze maps or maps that force you to follow a path. I want the game to go back to letting you decide where to go and when!
dynastywarriors,35wz89,luthin2000,4,Thu May 14 11:57:50 2015 UTC,"seriously, my favorite memory of DW was playing SHU on Yi Ling for DW3. I was playing Zhao Yun and it was pretty much a choice of which officer did i not want to die. I run to save Huang Zhong but then i am letting Ma Chao die. Those were the days."
dynastywarriors,35wz89,Leftwithnocookies,10,Sun May 17 01:36:51 2015 UTC,"Characters: While of course I would love for them to include people like Cheng Pu, Yuan Shu, Man Chong, Yang Hu, and Liao Hua, if they decide to forego or limit the number of new characters they add, they shouldn't get rid of any. Story: Along those same lines, find a way to give everybody some good screen time. For instance, the two Qiaos? The battle that Sun Ce and Zhou Yu married them after is a pretty important one for Wu, so have them involved there. Xu Huang? Play up his rivalry with Guan Yu instead of giving it to Xiahou Dun (seriously, Koei, stop turning Xiahou Dun into a one-note character and Xu Huang into a no-note character). Also, keep the Hypothetical routes, but make them a lot more interesting. I like being able to keep certain officers alive, but Sun Quan shouldn't get to lead Wu if neither his father nor brother have died. Let's see Sun Jian fight Lu Bu like he did in DW6, or have Sun Ce invade Xuchang and take on Yuan Shao or something. Give Wei under Cao Pi a proper ending. Expand Jin's storyline to include the fall of Wu. Gameplay: Give me a reason to care about all these peons I have to wade through. Make the normal soldiers more formidable, or at least make it important to defeat them. As it is, once I reach a certain level, I can just wade through peons and shrug off their attacks. Also, bring back random duels like in DW4 and DW6. Movesets: First of all, bring back the dodges and counters from DW6. There are a few things that game did right, and aside from the awful way you had to build up your Renbu meter, those were among them. Graphics: In DW6, you could actually see soldiers building and operating siege weapons. I want something along those lines again instead of having mysteriously motorized battering rams and catapults. Also, a lot more variance to the soldiers' defeated animations (or at least have them disappear almost instantly so I don't notice a crowd of soldiers dying with the same exact pose). Modes: I feel like DW7's Conquest Mode was a lot more interesting than DW8's Ambition Mode (did I get those mixed up? either way, DW7's was better). More variety in this mode, more replay value, and release periodic DLC that introduces new battle types. Misc: More unique battlefields. Mt. Tielong over in northwest China shouldn't use the same goddamn map as Guangling in eastern China. Gan Ji shouldn't be holed up in a castle in Jiangdong that looks suspiciously like Luoyang."
dynastywarriors,35wz89,ScubaSteeeve,7,Thu May 14 20:48:07 2015 UTC,"Less breadth and more depth. I would rather less playable characters, but more effort going into each one. Similarly for the stages - smaller, but more varied and detailed stages with more going on.  DW8 just feels like a shallow, empty grind after 20 hours. They've spread the butter too thinly over the toast. Cut the fat, and focus attention on a richer, deeper gameplay experience.  And definitely: SW4 hyper attacks"
dynastywarriors,35wz89,rowe92,1 point,Thu May 14 21:08:32 2015 UTC,There is a Ling Tong fan out there who'd be mad if he got cut hahaha. Pang De got cut for ONE game and outcry ensued.  DW8 DOES feel empty compared to 7 so something needs to change...a lot of things need to be changed :(

I'm sure there's more I'd like but that's all I  can think of for now."
dynastywarriors,35wz89,vox165,2,Thu May 14 07:04:28 2015 UTC,Yes. Mandarin voiceovers would be awesome.
dynastywarriors,35wz89,dude2dudette,4,Thu May 14 14:31:28 2015 UTC,I want it to be a decent PC release

dynastywarriors,35wz89,Shadowclaimer,0,Fri May 15 05:20:10 2015 UTC,Because.... the PC versions have been PS3 ports... thats what I am saying...

And the 1v1 duels when the enemies and allies alike are going in a circle around you.  Now I really want to play 6 again.."
dynastywarriors,35wz89,ShadowbanRevenant,2,Thu May 14 16:54:51 2015 UTC,I want battles to acutally feel huge in scale.
dynastywarriors,35wz89,deeefoo,3,Thu May 14 20:53:54 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm not entirely sure what it is I'd be looking for on a new DW game. First of all, we know that they are planning to 'revamp' the system, whatever that means.   I'd also love to see some character specific stories much like SW4 (e.g. Chang Ban playing as Zhou Yun v.s. Zhang Fei gives you entirely different level objectives; Chi Bi Pang Tong v.s. Zhuge Liang) but I can't imagine there will be quite as much variety as in SW4, simply because what each officer did in each battle after the fall of the Han dynasty isn't quite as well known as what happened in Feudal Japan over 1,000 years later"
dynastywarriors,35wz89,CroakDream,2,Thu May 14 08:27:01 2015 UTC,"Easy, evolving weapons like dynasty warriors 4, enemy officers can re-spawn and die, body guards, co-op mode that allows vs, challenge mode(was awesome). That ability that when you hit was it R3 emits an aura(want it back), other stuff too."
dynastywarriors,35wz89,luthin2000,1 point,Thu May 14 09:13:18 2015 UTC,"I want them to continue using Kingdom stories, it tells a much better, much more coherent story for players than the old personal Musous.  Not to mention individual character musous create an ""exponential content"" issue with personal stories. It means that every character they add to the roster will add substantially more development time on top of what's already necessary to make a character simply to give them a 5 mission + cinematics slapped in a random place in the timeline."
dynastywarriors,35wz89,invertigo666,1 point,Thu May 14 16:03:06 2015 UTC,Hyper Attacks from Samurai Warriors 4. Team Attacks (either via officer bodyguards or bonds) from Pirate Warriors 3.
dynastywarriors,35wz89,NasalDia,1 point,Thu May 14 16:43:26 2015 UTC,"I miss being able to create a character.  The design options were so limited, but damn was it fun to play as a character that almost looked like me."
dynastywarriors,35s6nq,deeefoo,4,Wed May 13 01:45:07 2015 UTC,"Samurai Warriors 3 4 and Pirate Warriors 3 are both significantly faster paced.  They have more enemies on screen at once normally, and the character movesets are significantly different in a few ways.  Samurai Warriors 4, it's entirely the Hyper Attack system.  The entire system is designed to speed up combat while making you feel like an unstoppable force when going through grunts.  They are designed not only to clear a wide area, but move your character forward at a good pace while doing so.  Pirate Warriors 3 doesn't have hyper attacks, but the anime nature of the game revolves around characters that are larger than life with superhuman abilities.  As such, they wanted them to be very flashy, which involves high kill counts and fast paced combat.  Pirate Warriors 2 was also very fast compared to the competition at the time, with many characters having combos which allowed them to clear many enemies and keep forward momentum at the same time.  The big change with PW3 is that there are simply more enemies.  Very few levels involved under 2000 KOs, and many of them require 3000+ for an S-rank.  Earlier DW games required you to purposely not clear enemy spawn positions and farm grunts to get even close to those numbers.  I don't know of any other Warriors spinoffs that match the speed/high enemy count fighting of those two yet, and it's mostly because they are the first two Warriors games to be designed for next gen.  Hopefully when DW9 (and hopefully WO4) come out, we'll see similar changes."
dynastywarriors,35s6nq,eleuthria,1 point,Wed May 13 02:25:20 2015 UTC,"The Hyper Attack system seems like a really neat concept, and I hope it's implemented into more future titles. HW and PW also feature dodging and sprinting, helping to increase combat speed even more.  On the part about Pirate Warriors being faster-paced because of the anime nature, I completely agree. Pirate Warriors and Hyrule Warriors are both completely set in fantasy worlds with characters capable of superhuman feats, which may explain the over-the-topness of these particular titles, such as summoning meteors or even the moon to drop on your foes. Which I love, by the way. I really do hope future Warriors games start to incorporate more over-the-top elements in them, which is brought me to enjoy the Warriors franchise in the first place. Samurai Warriors 4 already looks to be coming close, with that one dude who summons ice and stuff.  Hopefully more games will come to PC as well (I know PW3 is), since I would love to give SW4 a go."

dynastywarriors,35s6nq,knudow,1 point,Wed May 13 05:20:41 2015 UTC,The only thing I hate about the Pirate/Gundam/Whatever Warrior spinoffs is the base system. All the maps feel like squares joined by corridors.

dynastywarriors,35s6nq,eleuthria,1 point,Wed May 13 20:57:56 2015 UTC,"Possibly.  The game's mechanics are excellent, the characters are diverse, and there's a pretty big roster without a bunch of clones.  I really do think it's the ""best"" Warriors game so far from a pure gameplay standpoint."
dynastywarriors,35s6nq,eleuthria,1 point,Wed May 13 22:23:04 2015 UTC,"I think Pirate Warriors and Hyrule Warriors are the best, out of the ones I've tried. Fluid gameplay mechanics, diverse roster, great flashy visuals, ability to sprint at will, more AOE options allowing for a higher KO count. Also, the ability to lock the camera onto named enemies, which helps a lot. I think future Warriors games should incorporate all these elements."
dynastywarriors,35s6nq,RustyKumquats,1 point,Thu May 14 17:35:45 2015 UTC,"Hyrule Warriors was fun too, though I unfortunately didn't play it until after I  had gotten used to Pirate Warriors 3 and Samurai Warriors 4.  I'm actually finding it hard to go back to previous Warriors games now, they feel so sluggish in comparison."
dynastywarriors,35s6nq,eleuthria,1 point,Thu May 14 17:56:10 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean. I don't own SW4 or PW3 (though I'd like to very much), but after seeing gameplay footage of both, all the previous titles feel much slower (the Hyper Attack system seems to be the cause). I think most of it has to do with the fact that they were both designed for current-gen consoles. Fortunately, that probably means all future Warriors games will adopt the same pacing."
dynastywarriors,35s6nq,RustyKumquats,1 point,Thu May 14 20:00:42 2015 UTC,"Just a little warning, depending on far you've gotten in the anime series, Pirate Warriors 3 will have a HUGE amount of spoilers."
dynastywarriors,35peoq,SierraEx,5,Tue May 12 12:50:32 2015 UTC,"The point of free mode in pretty much every Warriors game is to play the story mode stages with any character, since story mode limits you to characters that actually make sense story wise for each battle. So yes, dw8xl free mode is just story mode without character restrictions. If you are getting the complete edition on steam then your are getting a lot of stages anyways iirc."
dynastywarriors,35peoq,invelios,2,Tue May 12 13:20:03 2015 UTC,"A minor detail about free mode that is mildly infuriating: If you pick a character that is actually supposed to be in the battle, there are now two of you."

Also, there are a large number of Free Mode-only DLC stages, and you can also play as the opposing faction in a lot of Free Mode maps."

You can now musou link with your spouse and sworn siblings.  maybe some can post the patch list because I'm mobile but its a far superior version to that currently on consoles.   60fps and 1080p.

dynastywarriors,32d14w,VNTRevolution,3,Sun Apr 12 19:39:09 2015 UTC,No official news yet that I've seen.  All we have is speculation due to SW4-II showing up on the Steam Database a few months back.
dynastywarriors,32d14w,eleuthria,3,Sun Apr 12 20:02:20 2015 UTC,"I bought the SW4 special anime pack, without realizing it was for the ps4 (which I don't own) and actually made about 30 dollars selling it to gamestop. That gave me just enough money to get SW4 for the ps3 and get yakuza 4 (which is awesome) so I don't know if the anime pack is great for everyone, but I loved it."

I just need to get a memory card to download the like 7 other games that aren't downloaded since I have to make space every time I get a new game. I'm also getting the next Mortal Kombat which is 2 days away so I guess I should just save the money until something pops up that I don't have at all.
dynastywarriors,322krm,Lotoran,3,Fri Apr 10 01:47:51 2015 UTC,"As of now only current costumes and costumes from DW7. You can bet on it that they'll release more which usually includes new and old costumes.    Also be prepared this game has terrible frame rate issues and we on xbox seem to have been left out on the recently released horse and bgm dlc.  The current dlc we have is edit parts, new voices, residences and scenarios."

dynastywarriors,31stog,sheizlegend,1 point,Wed Apr 8 03:00:42 2015 UTC,I believe this is an issue with Xbox One controllers across any game. There's a vibration feature in FFXIV: ARR however despite me enabling it in my options it doesn't do it. I don't think games can use the One controllers vibration for some reason. Yet.
dynastywarriors,31ny0b,NiceMugOfTea,6,Mon Apr 6 19:58:47 2015 UTC,"Whenever you meet an officer in a battle, be it as an enemy or an ally, you gain friendship with them. Every time friendship level increases, you can visit that officer on the map and trigger an event cutscene where you can get more if you choose the correct dialogue option. Most officers will become your ally after you reach Level 4 friendship. Officers who serve as final boss for their regions need to have their regions conquered before they can be recruited. Reaching level 5 friendship allows your custom characters to use that officers moveset. So if you have specific people you want to play as, be sure to fight a lot of battles in their home region.  And my favorite moveset is Ii Naotora's."
dynastywarriors,31ny0b,stunderthepants,2,Mon Apr 6 20:37:49 2015 UTC,"Cheers, that makes sense.

dynastywarriors,31bh3l,GGProfessor,7,Fri Apr 3 15:37:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely not safe for Shu. Though he's more of the idea that even if IRL Liu Bei and the Shu boys were assholes, they could at least be written better"
dynastywarriors,31bh3l,CaptSteelbeard,5,Fri Apr 3 20:39:00 2015 UTC,"His comments are pretty interesting in how they highlight the values dissonance between modern American/western audiences and traditional Asian audiences. Clearly, much of what was written about Liu Bei and the warriors of Shu was exaggerated or made up outright, but even ignoring that their actions and morals don't exactly hold up to scrutiny in a contemporary light. But in the time Romance of the Three Kingdoms was written and pretty much since then, Liu Bei and Shu have been considered the tragic heroes of the age. While the ""virtue"" they speak of doesn't seem to mean much to modern audiences, it clearly resonated with audiences at the time. And now that values have changed so much, the particulars had to have been made more and more vague to keep Liu Bei and Shu as the good guys - because the virtues that may have been extolled in China centuries ago simply will not stand for audiences today."
dynastywarriors,31bh3l,Baturinsky,5,Fri Apr 3 21:12:26 2015 UTC,"I think that if Romance of the Three Kingdoms were written today, the Sun family would be re-written to be the main protagonists because they really kind of highlight western values (Sun Jian the Han loyalist, fighting for his family, Wu being a rather prosperous area, the battle of Chibi being about being underdogs) and the later Wu years really kind of highlight what's wrong with us today, (Corruption, bribery, poor leadership.)  Also I kind of really like Wu."

Shu's not as ""BENEVOLENCE!"" as they're potrayed, but this guy just out and out fangirls over Cao Wei and as such has a lot of hatred for Shu Han. Justifies his own personal biases using parts of history he likes, or Dynasty Warriors or the fictional depictions depending on which one portrays his favored characters the best, and his blog reads like a typical Tumblr blog aside from that."

dynastywarriors,31bh3l,ScubaSteeeve,5,Sun Apr 5 14:41:39 2015 UTC,"So biased......he calls people monsters without knowing what actually happened or what their actual motivation was, he should be more carefull trying to judge other characters, when we have so little information about most of them  Pretty pretentious to think he knows everything about every character in the period, most of it is just random guesses based on what happened under battles"
dynastywarriors,31bh3l,MrSuitMan,3,Fri Apr 3 23:21:46 2015 UTC,He hates my favorite characters. But I do like some of his analysis. I wish he did weapon analysis on all characters though (He only mentioned it for a few characters).

dynastywarriors,31bh3l,knudow,1 point,Sat Apr 4 09:42:46 2015 UTC,"Fortunately, the DW versions are all opinion based and very open to scrutiny. He does clearly let his opinions of historical versions impact a few ratings, Shu feels this the most. On the opposite end of the spectrum, he admits that his Pang Tong love may make the real one seem better than he thinks. I guess he finds it difficult to separate the two for some reason."
dynastywarriors,31bh3l,emperornel,-1,Sat Apr 4 01:37:55 2015 UTC,"See, I don't like Shu, either. In fact, I hate how the series always seems to focus on them the most and how most people who learn about the Three Kingdoms learn that Shu were the ""good guys."" But I don't like the entire concept of his list.  The low ratings he gives to any female character who isn't either a sexpot or a gruff, violent murderer really pisses me off, too. It just reeks of either misogyny or neckbeardism."
dynastywarriors,31bh3l,JRS-130650,6,Sat Apr 4 04:05:21 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that. Unless I miscounted, he poorly scored about 5 female characters out of about 15. And his reasons seemed pretty justified. One of them he scores low because her character is defined purely by her realtionship with her husband, deservedly so since its a pretty anti feminist character writing. Hardly seem misogynist to me. Two of them he scores low because they're designed loli like - again reasonable.  There are plenty of women characters that he scores high that are neither sex pots or gruff murderers. Yue Ying. Guan Yinping. Xingcai.  Looks like you're a bit quick to call out misogyny/neckbeardism without looking at his points first."
dynastywarriors,31bh3l,Grandy12,3,Sat Apr 4 09:28:00 2015 UTC,I think that the scores are pretty fair for the women too. Cai Wenji and Lu Lingqi get a low positive because they're underused but have potential. I don't know enough about the Qiao's to be able to give a good opinion on them though.

dynastywarriors,3021up,iamnotreallyreal,16,Mon Mar 23 21:09:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly, and let's be real, there should be a stinking cover with Liu Bei, Cao Cao, and Sun Quan on the front, somehow, someway. Those are three very powerful warlords that more or less defined the era. However, for poster boy besides Zhao Yun, Lu Bu I suppose. DW has made him into a popular machine. Or Guan Yu, as he is the acclaimed God of War, after all. But I think the covers should better represent specific battles or moments, like Zhang Fei's stand at Changban or Huang Gai's raid in Chibi or Dian Wei's rescue at Wan Castle. There's so many good moments that could be very well done as covers, I believe."
dynastywarriors,3021up,DrFatKid,2,Tue Mar 24 06:02:05 2015 UTC,"This is something I've always been surprised they didn't do more of. Using covers of epic moments like that (To be fair, Zhou Yun's Changban rescue is also important, given that Liu Shan's incompetence was a major factor that led to the deterioration of Shu, after Zhuge Liang and Jiang Wei had done well to maintain it during their life-times)"
dynastywarriors,3021up,dude2dudette,9,Tue Mar 24 12:26:06 2015 UTC,Sun Ce all the way.
dynastywarriors,3021up,Basuru,9,Mon Mar 23 21:16:50 2015 UTC,I'd say Xiahou Dun because he's a badass.

dynastywarriors,3021up,dragoduval,2,Mon Mar 23 21:28:49 2015 UTC,I'm ok with Wang Yi as a poster girl. Lu lingqi on the other hand is still...I dunno...boring? Maybe she just needs a better outfit. Definitely more armor.

dynastywarriors,3021up,Enzedderr,4,Tue Mar 24 19:55:30 2015 UTC,"I have always thought they should have a 4 way poster show casing all the kingdoms. Something similar to the older cover arts.  Perhaps like the old Ironman 1 poster but with Cao Cao - Ironman, Liu Bei - RDJ, Sun Ce - Villainman, Pepper - Sima Zhao, Military - Lu Bu.  Personally though... I would love Koei to create some characters for other Kingdoms during the Jin period. Then put Sima Shi, Sima Zhao and Wang Yuanji on the front possibly overshadowed by Sima Yi. Really give some focus to the 2 generations and the transition because at the moment once it transitions to Jin the game feels so empty as the number of notable officers dwindles."
dynastywarriors,3021up,Hank_Moody_,1 point,Tue Mar 24 00:23:29 2015 UTC,The iron man one.
dynastywarriors,3021up,Chinoko,5,Wed Apr 1 22:38:07 2015 UTC,"Imo there should be a posterboy for each kingdom, assuming that for such role you wouldn't expect him/her to be a leader or a strategist and to be somewhat relevant throughout the time: Zhao Yun, historically, is probably still the best posterboy candidate for Shu, if not him it'd likely be Ma Chao or even Xing Cai. Wei has really a lot of talents, I'd personally prefer Zhang Liao but I think people'd disagree so Yue Jin or Wang Yi are also good choices. For Wu it'd definitely be a Ling Tong/Gan Ning duo or Zhou Tai."
dynastywarriors,3021up,WalrusSoup,3,Tue Mar 24 05:17:24 2015 UTC,"I'm really partial to XingCai, just because she is my favorite.   That being said, It's a little tough to pick a poster child for the entire series because there are so many. Historically, we could say the big three could be taking that role and need to be on the cover, but they don't really stand out as far as marketing (at least thats my opinion). It's a little hard to find 'the' image to go with the game since the characters and playstyles are so different. If putting a specific character on the cover other than the most generic one was done, then it may also lead people to think the game was about them entirely. Which would be fuckin awesome, though. Putting girls on the cover may also lead people to think that it could be a fanservice type game in some respects because there are some characters that are really well equipped.   That is a really difficult question. I'd love to see a game in the DW territory with some characters given the dark souls treatment though. I've always wanted to bring my characters outside the typical hack and slash and into something a little more serious or dedicated to specifically them: even if its not historically accurate."
dynastywarriors,3021up,gilgagoogyta,2,Mon Mar 23 23:22:46 2015 UTC,I think that the cover will benefit from the most beautiful of characters. You know who I mean...  Pang Tong.
dynastywarriors,3021up,kanata665,2,Tue Mar 24 15:16:34 2015 UTC,I mean.......I think Yue Jin was pretty badass. And he's kind of like wei's zhao yun. So I vote for Yue Jin

dynastywarriors,3021up,theknyte,2,Tue Mar 24 08:37:48 2015 UTC,I think the perfect cover would be a silhouette in the foreground with their back to the viewer. And they are facing off against thousands in the background coming towards them. I don't know what better way to sum up DW in a single image.
dynastywarriors,3021up,ScubaSteeeve,4,Thu Apr 2 13:20:08 2015 UTC,"Anybody but Zhao Yun, to be honest. Out of all the characters in the game, he is the most generic, one-dimensional, and static of the bunch. He has no defining personality traits that aren't shared by at least half the cast. Yes, he's a fearsome and heroic general. But his personality in the game is just so boring that I very often forget he's even in the game.  Myself, I like the idea of rotating ""poster boys/girls"" depicting famous scenes. Having two officers duke it out on the cover would be ideal. Lu Bu is always a safe choice. Zhuge Liang and Sima Yi (or Zhuge Liang and Zhou Yu or Lu Xun) would be great for a more tactical game like Empires. Guan Yu and Zhang Fei are both just as famous as Zhao Yun and have much more developed personalities. Xiahou Dun's recognizable enough. Yue Jin, Gan Ning, Sun Ce, and Zhang Liao aren't quite as famous, but they're genuinely interesting characters with compelling designs. Sun Shangxiang and Lu Lingqi are, to me, a bit more compelling as poster girls than Wang Yuanji, who seems to have taken the role lately.  Hell, I'd rather have Xu Zhu as the poster boy than Zhao Yun."

Basically it's like everything the old versions were but there's ""more"" of everything. More plebs on the screen, more unique characters, all characters had their own unique move set & weapon etc.  If you liked old dynasty warriors, there's really no reason to not like the current dynasty warriors."
dynastywarriors,2zyw7z,Ryuzakku,1 point,Mon Mar 23 03:14:28 2015 UTC,"Coming from someone who started with DW4 Empires, I've had a much better time olaying that game than the new ones. They're still great, but I feel the old games were balanced better,  were harder and had more strategy to them (as much strategy as a DW can provide,  anyways)   In battles,  a good battle would let me get 400 or 500 kills. Typically 250 or 300. I've only gotten to 1000 a few times,  and that's cause I was kill farming. DW8 empires, one of my first battles I scored 1800 kills with no issue at all. My loadout could attack a million people at once and everyo e died in one or two hits, even officers in a lot of cases,  and this is on normal mode."
dynastywarriors,2zyw7z,Raknarg,1 point,Mon Mar 23 14:08:43 2015 UTC,"I started with DW4 and played each game since then. I think you'd really enjoy DW8. The story is done very well, each kingdom having several levels and even alternate history stages acting as ""What if"" stages showing if said kingdom did not go thru a major downfall or rose to victory at a time they may not have. So it excels but at telling the true main story but also giving you a handful of alternate scenarios near the end of each kingdom for fun.  There is a lot of weapon collecting still. Between weapons having different stats/elements on them and the challenge of collecting everyone's level 5 and, I believe, level 6 weapons (in Xtreme Legends) there's plenty to collect.   I would highly recommend Dynasty Warriors 8 Complete Edition if you have a PS4. Otherwise, DW8 on PS3 and if possible also pick up Xtreme legends for more characters and stages."
dynastywarriors,2zyw7z,Saikaku,1 point,Tue Mar 24 04:19:59 2015 UTC,"I also just got back into Dynasty Warriors. My last version was Dynasty Warriors 3, in my opinion, one of the funnest PS2 games.

dynastywarriors,2zxlhg,Conk_PR,4,Sun Mar 22 19:43:32 2015 UTC,"8 XL or 8 Empires are the newest ones. XL is the more traditional style where you just go through stages and stuff. Empires lets you create a character and play through campaigns as an officer or ruler, make political decisions and stuff. Eventually conquer China... I'd say it depends on what you're looking for. XL is much easier to pickup and play for a bit then put it down, whereas empires is a bit more of a commitment and more complex."
dynastywarriors,2zxlhg,Grimstar3,2,Sun Mar 22 20:12:41 2015 UTC,You'd recommend XL over the base Dynasty Warriors 8? I feel like the base game has a lot more content.
dynastywarriors,2zxlhg,GGProfessor,2,Sun Mar 22 22:00:29 2015 UTC,Oh right... I forgot XL was only an update without the base game... Yeah I'd opt for 8 then

dynastywarriors,2zxlhg,OmegaRed131RGX,1 point,Mon Mar 23 22:04:55 2015 UTC,"Hi I'm going to jump on to this thread with out spamming the forum.  I was also looking into getting back into dynasty warriors mainly for pick up casual play for my ps3. I know a lot of people are recommending Dynasty Warriors 8, but I have a bit of cash flow problem. I was wondering what people's thoughts were about Dynasty Warriors 6 or Dynasty warriors 7?"
dynastywarriors,2zsm1u,zycros,1 point,Sat Mar 21 10:17:31 2015 UTC,"I honestly can't remember much about 7 empires but I'll try my best to list the differences.   bases were bigger in size and all had gates that can be opened and closed depending if there were enemies within the vicinity or not. character's ""way of life""( can't remember what they were actually called.) determined what kind of strategems can be used. Ex: virtuous characters can use healing Strategems. Leader characters can use march. only 1 EX attack per character. there were more events in 7. Ex: encountering a mighty officer (such as Lu Bu or Xiahou Ba) during battle will trigger a cutscene where you defend yourself successfully from a barrage of attacks and the officer commends you for being a worthy foe. All done in first person view. I believe there was more dialogue between officers who knew each other, if you betrayed a kingdom and encounter said kingdom on the battlefield, or if you are a well known officer. Strategems can only be used once( I could be wrong about this one.)   Overall 8 empires is a step in the right direction when it comes to character combat and Strategems but everything else took a wrong turn."
dynastywarriors,2zrh0g,CroakDream,2,Sat Mar 21 01:05:39 2015 UTC,I am really loving getting to control 3 other units makes taking over the maps so much more fun. I made all 4 of my units royal lancers which is great. Its worth noteing you can either use your mercs or story characters.

dynastywarriors,2zrh0g,vox165,3,Sat Mar 21 05:51:43 2015 UTC,I don't think most people play koei games for graphics. Though I will say sw4 looked fantastic.

dynastywarriors,2zrh0g,wiseman207,1 point,Sat Mar 21 09:58:36 2015 UTC,"This game seemed like a B-list Koei title... which means the typical Koei action shortcomings are even more pronounced.  The graphics are rough.  The game can handle a lot of action on screen, and that's important since that's what these games do best.  It was passible on PS3 but was only barely improved for PS4, so it's seriously lagging behind.  AI on the per-troop level, pathfinding issues, invisible walls... all present in every Koei game and here too.  The characters are a bit less colorful and interesting than Warriors games.  They're very one-dimensional, somewhat ugly, very forgettable.  However, it's still got all the basics.  It's an action/RPG/strategy hybrid so it can scratch a lot of itches at once.  You can smash face, level up, and then plan how you'll smash face again.  Leading troops is a satisfying power trip.  I can recognize it's bad but I still like it, because a lot of ""better"" games are unsatisfying in more profound ways, despite their technical competence."
dynastywarriors,2zrh0g,wiseman207,0,Thu Mar 26 14:43:14 2015 UTC,Are they? I've only played the hundred years war mode but I thought it looks fine I've not really noticed any bad textures. The cutscenes are abit meh but the game itself looks good.
dynastywarriors,2zrh0g,iamnotreallyreal,1 point,Sat Mar 21 07:01:58 2015 UTC,"Good graphics are always better but there's diminishing returns after a certain point.  I wouldn't call Bladestorm's grpahics good, but this is an enhanced port of an 8 year old Koei game.  Graphics evolved with computing power to create more complex games over the years, but I don't think we've seen significant increase in gameplay complexity for a while, so what is there to warrant increased interface fidelity anyway?  Most games nowadays have been changing in other ways... taking existing formulas and incorporating online interactions, etc.  If you don't demand cutting-edge graphics, you'll get by on Bladestorm.  I'm an old man who used to play text-based adventures.  Pretty much every game is at least ""good enough"" nowadays."
dynastywarriors,2zrh0g,wiseman207,1 point,Thu Mar 26 15:17:04 2015 UTC,I'm glad koei has put out a demo for this game but I won't be buying it anytime soon. Never played the original so this game would be a good introduction to the series for me. It immediately reminded me of Kessen 3 mostly because of some aspects of the combat system. I will buy when the price is lowered or when there is a sale going on.

dynastywarriors,2zq6hi,kitsunezeta,3,Fri Mar 20 20:26:47 2015 UTC,"First off, DW8XLCE does not come with any DLC. The ""Complete Edition"" is a hell of a naming screwup by the localization team, but basically amounts to the base game ""Dynasty Warriors 8"" and the ""Xtreme Legends"" expansion pack (which were available separately on PS3).  Now, to address the related question of ""does DLC I buy for DW8XLCE transfer to DW8E"", the answer is YES for applicable DLC. DLC that is common to both games (music, alt costumes for officers, and wallpapers) will be ""shared"" - buying it for one game will effectively buy it for both. On PC, the DLC that this is applicable to will have a notice on the individual DLC item pages."

dynastywarriors,2zla1d,BlackMageUltima,3,Thu Mar 19 15:03:41 2015 UTC,"On PC - if that's what you're using - it's not an easy option. I think consoles can, but I don't play that. The PC offers local co-op. I don't think competitive play is an option.  A friend of mine and I also used to play DW5 a lot, but now we live far apart. For DW8:E, we used Teamviewer, and basically he tricks my computer into thinking he's on local co-op. But it's a subpar experience.   tl;dr - it won't work"
dynastywarriors,2zla1d,dmang789,1 point,Thu Mar 19 20:43:36 2015 UTC,Online Co-op is map invite based on console. You open the map to Online play. A friend joins and picks an officer (Think co-op in base game except rather than a set campaign its just a bunch of scenarios). You can't go Kingdom against Kingdom. You can add his character to your Kingdom and make sure that his character is in your list of people you are bringing to the fight. However you have to also make sure his character doesn't leave for whatever reason (AI is fickle sometimes). Once the fight is over though the battle ends and you are returned to the menus and have to reinvite later once another battle starts.  Effectively... co-op in Empires games are limited both local and online. This is even more so in DW8:E. If he wants the game just to play together then I would say no. You are better playing DW8:XL together unless you are on PC where you can't at all. If Samurai Warriors 4 comes out on PC and with Online co-op I would recommend that as you can create a character in solo mode if you want as well.
dynastywarriors,2zla1d,Enzedderr,1 point,Fri Mar 20 01:18:52 2015 UTC,That's very disappointing. I appreciate the detailed answer. I'll advice him to stick with Xtreme if he only chooses to own one.
dynastywarriors,2zla1d,Enzedderr,3,Fri Mar 20 03:58:08 2015 UTC,I was very disappointed as well. I love the Warriors games but buy every iteration because my room mate and I can play together. After having so much fun with DW7:E I was thinking that DW8:E would be amazing. To find out that Online Co-op is limited and that Local Co-op is even further limited to only Invasion battles I was very disappointed. I played the game solo for a few days but I am sorely missing the co-op play and have barely touched it since.

dynastywarriors,2zav68,BlackMageUltima,3,Tue Mar 17 01:24:56 2015 UTC,"For me, although I struggled at the beginning, but here are some tips!   Stratagems / Unity or Recovery Turret - I didn't even know what stratagems were until hard mode where I realized how good they were.  Training / Doing focus merit training on your character is a way to level up, higher levels = better stats Invasions / When picking merit quests, AVOID the timed suggested officers/bases, in hard mode it takes way too long to grind them out, either choose one, or none, at least until you're ready Invasions / Avoid large clumps of officers - given Pre-Game Bonuses / Weapons Bonus pretty much gets the job done, if you don't want that, then maybe the 10+ levels bonus, which is fairly cheap"
dynastywarriors,2zav68,double_rainbows,2,Tue Mar 17 02:49:20 2015 UTC,"Never train unless you have asolutely nothing better to do, the AI will always receive more merits than you would via training, focus on completing battle/political objectives but don't penalize/cripple yourself to complete them. Forge alliances strategically, they're important, it may avoid you being attacked by extension from other kingdoms, possibly do them with kingdoms who are connected with you so you can receive extra officers in battle. If you're not planning to attack a territory that may attack you relentlessly, build castle walls, it improves overall defenses on the territory they're built so you wouldn't need to defend them as much as you'd have to (try to build them on territories meant to be ""choke points""). In conjuction with the point above, avoid defending (especially when the province is damaged), it's a waste of time, troops, fatigue and resources: you'd do a much better job to raid and invade towards enemy capital. As a ruler, avoid recruiting personally, the chances are low as you can't raise relationship yourself. Stratagems: Turrets, Altars, Grand-Scale stratagems (Like Inferno), pop them asap to win the battles, if you manage to defend the bases capturing the rest is a cakewalk. For weapons rage/musou/stratagem (explosion, lightning attack) enemy officers when they have no retreats left (triangles on health bar), works on defense and invasion battles only. SwornBrothers/Partner always give you some very high (read as: best) star weapons after a while.   Trust me, hard is still fairly easy, chaos however is on a whole another level, you'd have to exploit everything the AI does to win. Edit: format and typos"

dynastywarriors,2zav68,iamnotreallyreal,2,Tue Mar 17 14:30:17 2015 UTC,"Use those bonuses to give you a helpful boost at the start of your campaign. Strategems are your friend. Unity is the most useful one in the game imo.  When starting out as a free officer, try to join a kingdom and get promoted ASAP to a marshall or strategist in order for you to build item shops, academies and weapon forges. Also proper strategizing during combat. I know this game doesn't have much in the way of actual strategy, but it helps when you are invading and have one side of the map be defended by 2-3 officers while you lead a few other officers up the other side and take all those bases along the way. Basically, use your officers to your advantage."
dynastywarriors,2zav68,AppleChiaki,1 point,Tue Mar 17 07:31:12 2015 UTC,"Use the Unity Stratagem, and put all your money into building forges, then buy better weapons.   Sadly doing this will quickly make the game as easy for you as normal is."
dynastywarriors,2zav68,HanKwen,1 point,Tue Mar 17 15:17:18 2015 UTC,I would also suggest trying to get the high level weapons which help a lot. Weapon boxes randomly pop up when defeating officers with a musou or rage attack.

dynastywarriors,2z7bak,SlarkeSSC,5,Mon Mar 16 05:03:31 2015 UTC,Go with Xtreme Legends. Empires is a strategy spinoff you should only approach after knowing how an actual dynasty warriors main game plays.
dynastywarriors,2z7bak,soad3821,2,Mon Mar 16 05:13:01 2015 UTC,plus Xtreme Legends has a Complete Edition out so its the main game + Xtreme Legends expansion. Xtreme Legends is just extra story and missions without the main game. Only recently have they bundled the two together.
dynastywarriors,2z7bak,AppleChiaki,1 point,Mon Mar 16 05:14:26 2015 UTC,Would you recommend PC controls or a controller?
dynastywarriors,2z7bak,AppleChiaki,2,Mon Mar 16 05:24:27 2015 UTC,definitely controller even though the PC version doesn't show you the controller's button graphics for any of the button prompts on screen. (i.e. showing WASD and Enter and stuff when you clearly have a controller plugged in) It's more work because reconfiguring the buttons to the way you want is a chore and a half before you even start playing because the default controller config I think is a little esoteric.
dynastywarriors,2z17w1,santodeobo,3,Sat Mar 14 16:58:56 2015 UTC,"You got seriously lucky at Fan Castle. You managed to defeat both officers before your base count reached 0. The base captain himself doesn't control the base, they just count as more troops when defeated.  Here's how you pick which bases to upgrade since you seemed annoyed by that. Look at the lines that connect to them. Red is enemy controlled territory, Blue is friendly,  white is contested space which is considered the frontline. The 1st base you upgraded was a good one, the 2nd base you upgraded wasn't because even though it looks like it was on the frontlines, it really wasn't because the only way the AI would capture it would be to go through the middle base. Same goes for the 3rd base. The 4th base to the left was a good base to upgrade, because if you notice, it has 2 white lines connecting to it.   So if you are really concerned about frontline bases, look at the supply lines. The best ones to reinforce at Fan Castle would be the base all the way to the left and all the way to the right, which you did, but also the center base, which you did not. This is a good general rule of thumb."

I had it on PS3, ended up getting a PS4, and got the Complete Edition on PS4.  Also, any DLC you bought for the base game will carry over to Xtreme Legends, regardless of which way you go or if you change platforms. Once you buy the DLC, you have it for all platforms.

It plays more like an expansion than regular dlc so you can continue the storyline and all the enhancements retroactively apply to the main game. Characters/weapons etc.

A Warriors game set in medieval Europe!?!?!?! I didn't know about this, I have to play it!!""  Then I tried the demo and stopped playing in a few minutes because I was expecting a Warrior's game.  I tried it years later with a more open mind and this time I loved it.  You are a mercenary. If you go alone you can't do much, but you can get near an allied unit and merge with it. Now the unit moves with you and every time you attack the whole unit attacks. Some units are stronger against other units, some are weaker. You have to change units depending on the situation.  You can try the 360 demo (I don't know if the PS3 has the demo too). Apparently the Xbox One demo got released yesterday."

dynastywarriors,2yiqrz,5chneemensch,2,Wed Mar 11 01:52:16 2015 UTC,"Bladestorm is a tactical action game where you take control of a squad instead of going 1-man army. You get 3(?) attacks/buffs on your buttons with a cooldown, and a basic autobrawler (hold it to send your squad out to autoattack stuff in your vicinity) button on one of the shoulder buttons.  Squads have strengths and weaknesses. Some squads are even outright designed to counter only one specific thing, and are otherwise useless. Having the wrong squad for the wrong enemy will put you at a severe disadvantage which often results in you taking really heavy dmg. Deployed spearman for example will almost one-hit kill your charging horseriders, and possibly kill you instantly.  Squads gain xp for using them. So if you don't you a squad, it will fall behind in stronger maps. Some squads unlock later in the game and start at low level where you have to replay one of the easier maps to get them somewhat useful for the lategame stuff.  That's all I can remember for now.  E: Afair you can hold up to 3 ""cards"" that you can use to summon a squad right next to you, too. Very neat."

The game itself is quite repetitive, but it slowly introduces the complexities of it's rock-paper-scissors-etc combat and massive upgrade tree.  I really liked it, and was excited when I saw it on PS4 (until I realized it was just a re-release).  The game is long, and has some rudimentary sandbox elements, like Empires.  However, in Bladestorm you don't necessarily care which kingdom is winning (unless gunning for particular cutscenes or secrets).  I recommend it... and if you want to play to completion you'll rack up near 100 hours on it.  I affectionately called it Bladestorm the Hundred Year Chore."

Some of us play DW for the narrative and the rich semi-historical lore it's based on.

dynastywarriors,2xxwva,D3is,2,Wed Mar 4 23:53:19 2015 UTC,"Haven't tried Sima Shi, but I made my custom officer a lightning sword primary user, and it was unbelievable.  Wasn't positive if it was new to DW8:E, or if it was on DW8XL (haven't played that one enough to be sure).  Lightning Sword + Flying Swords = so nice for massive clearing.  Lightning Sword feels almost like the rush attacks in Samurai Warriors 4 when you do SSST."
dynastywarriors,2xxwva,eleuthria,2,Thu Mar 5 04:02:58 2015 UTC,"Lightning Sword was in XL I believe. Off the top of my head, new weapons added in DW8:E are: Bladebow, Emei Piercers, Dragon Column, Formation Rod, Fire Blade (I think that's what it's called), and the Revolving Crossbow (I think, can't remember it being in DW8XL)."

Basically, you don't have much AoE aside from maybe His first EX(I go in order of attacks here.). However, when he has some rods placed down, he can activate them to hit the area the rods surround. It's pretty cool.  However, his first EX is my go to clearing move. Or dueling move. I love that."

On steam, however, there are two separate ""instance"" of the DLC on the store - one for DW8XLCE, one for DW8E - due to Steam's requirement that you own the game to be able to use the DLC.  At this point in time, the only NEW DLC for the Steam release is the ""Edit Parts - Face, Hair & Accessary Pack"". Everything else is ""common DLC"" from DW8XLCE."

dynastywarriors,2xunvc,Kraay,4,Wed Mar 4 00:37:45 2015 UTC,"Playing on normal, you can unite the kingdoms within 8 hours of play if you understand the game and lead your own kingdom. In terms of replay value, it's very much so there, you just have to make it yourself, with custom characters."
dynastywarriors,2xunvc,tholt212,2,Wed Mar 4 01:31:02 2015 UTC,"How's the AI? Do they use any strategy, or do they just stand in place waiting for you to come and slaughter them like they did in Extreme Legends."
dynastywarriors,2xunvc,Cynical_badger,2,Wed Mar 4 04:05:51 2015 UTC,They occasionally use Stratagems and the like. And they do follow offensive/defensinve stuff depending on the type of battle. Overall I like it quite a bit more than EL as someone who has loved the series since 2.
dynastywarriors,2xunvc,tholt212,4,Wed Mar 4 04:30:44 2015 UTC,"I rate 8XL ahead of Empires. So far it seems like you could have every single character in a given scenario as a generic custom character and there'd be zero impact on the game, the lore just feels so inconsequential.  I mean, I married Lianshi and Sun Quan stepped down and promoted me to ruler for fuck's sake."
dynastywarriors,2xunvc,nussbuster,6,Wed Mar 4 07:54:49 2015 UTC,"While I agree 8XL is better than 8E the point of the empires games is that all lore gets thrown out of the picture and it's just kind of a sandbox mode to conquer china as you see fit with whatever characters you want. Do you want Liu Bei and Cao Cao to work together to fuck everyone over? Empires lets you do that, but the main point is it allows you to create whatever characters you want and do whatever the hell you want while following the same base formula and not having to adhere to the story and officer groupings."
dynastywarriors,2xunvc,D3is,3,Wed Mar 4 09:14:44 2015 UTC,"Well... I tend to take longer now since I start as a vagabond unit in the 4th scenario. Trying to unlock some events.  But really replayable? Depends on if you don't mind doing a lot of the same thing. Maybe even lagging behind the AI  As for the AI... There's a good reason why you should only be playing as a ruler. The AI ruler NEVER builds a weapon forge, item shop or academy, stuff that really helps you get stronger. Not just the AI ruler, but also the AI prefect, marshal and strategist never seem to build anything but resources.  Also, having a chance of getting a new officer is great, but certain playable officers IMMEDIATELY leave to another kingdom or become a free officer once you have them. It's RNG controlled at that.  I guess I'm repeating others here though. When it comes to replayability, it all depends on the WoL, way of Life, system. Doing certain things to gain titles that then go towards a WoL in the end. For instance, I managed to get benevolent ruler and unmatched intellect, due to what options I picked during the game. there are, from waht I've heard, about 50 WoLs to get. And there are achievements if that's what you like to get."
dynastywarriors,2xunvc,hickwarrior,3,Wed Mar 4 08:03:06 2015 UTC,"Overall, 8E is better than 8XL but it feels way too similar to 7E.  There arent as many innovations as I had hoped but IMHO 7&8 were too similar.    I know I'm a filthy pirate for torrenting this but I wanted to see if 8E was different from 7E and it is not for me,"
dynastywarriors,2xunvc,palkiabros,3,Wed Mar 4 05:19:35 2015 UTC,"It's better in the combat imo, with the rock paper scissors combat, giving you an actual reason to switch between weapons."

dynastywarriors,2xunvc,Kipreel,1 point,Wed Mar 4 23:09:26 2015 UTC,"was speaking on the 7-8 leap, not the 8 to XL leap."
dynastywarriors,2xunvc,tholt212,2,Wed Mar 4 23:39:42 2015 UTC,"I'm curious to why you think empires is better than XL. Once you have a couple of territories you never have resource problems making quests pretty pointless. Raids don't achieve a massive amount, you are almost always better off recruiting a new officer (which seems to have a hilariously low chance on higher tier guys) or just recruiting more troops for an upcoming invasion. Playing as anything but a ruler is really pointless. The battles feel repetitive and the in fight strategies are neat but ultimately pointless as all they do is speed up the battle slightly. I also wan't to add that the battle objectives are really dumb as they often defeat the objective of strategy. So many times the battle objective is to capture a base the other side of the map within 3 minutes which is basically saying fuck strategy just charge at that meaningless base miles away.  The game just feels empty, the battles are just a run from base to base till you win (all your allies are really useful for is holding the enemy off until you deal with them in person). The officer fights don't feel special it just feels like killing a peasant with more HP. Due to this the game is really repetitive, don't get me wrong, i love grinding. I have played XL for 200 hours to grind half of the cast to level 150 but nothing about the grind in Empires feels rewarding.  Nothing in empires really makes up for the fact that it has weaker combat and story in XL.  I love Dynasty warriors but 8E is the first game I feel wasn't worth the money I spent on it. Conversely I think 8XL is probably the one of the best games in the entire series."
dynastywarriors,2xunvc,RocketGruntPsy,1 point,Thu Mar 5 18:25:14 2015 UTC,"I'm a really big fan of custom characters in any game, so that gives me a little bias..  The stratagems are a unique addition to the formula that while unnecessary and cheap do provide a different experience than previous entries.    In terms of graphics and replay ability, I think the ps4 8E is slightly better than 8xl.  I may be a bit bias here because I bought 8xl on current and last gen systems, but I really regretted the expensive graphical update of 8xl.  Overall, I'm not a big fan of 7 or 8, maybe 8 a bit more because of weapon sets and the rock paper scissors.  But I'm really a fan of 6 (I know don't kill me).  I liked the presentation, combat flow, story, renbu, and empires.    I'm on mobile so I'll type more if you want me to when I get my PC."
dynastywarriors,2xunvc,palkiabros,1 point,Thu Mar 5 18:53:44 2015 UTC,"Nah it's ok, just preference I guess. I played both on PC and the visuals for 8XL are truly glorious while Empires uses console graphics as a port.  I do think the custom characters is empires big plus point but all the battles feel the same to me. I think its because most of the time you are fighting in small wooden bases just hitting things until the number at the top hits 0. Especially in some bases where you just kill the base captain guy 8 times in a row because only 1 set of units spawn.    The battles in XL just feel like they have weight to them mainly due to the scripted story but also as the maps are are visually different with their own soundtracks giving a different experience each fight as opposed to empires where every fight kind of feels the same.  I love the concept of empires (and have liked some of the previous empires) and the idea of stratagems was really nice but I don't think that the idea was executed and integrated very well."

Awesome game, happy I bought it."
dynastywarriors,2xunvc,TG_Naptown,1 point,Wed Mar 4 15:44:34 2015 UTC,"I haven't played an Empires game in a long time, nor a proper Dynasty Warriors main title, but I'm loving Empires. The AI isn't terrible, not great of course but they aren't quite pants on head retarded. Tons of replay value with how much can be customized and all. As for time, I'm not too sure on that to be honest."
dynastywarriors,2xunvc,Zorkamork,1 point,Wed Mar 4 21:31:01 2015 UTC,"I dunno about AI, I haven't noticed anything yet. There is a lot of story in both 8XL and 8E, personally I prefer the story telling method in 8XL, however once completed you kinda don't feel like playing it anymore. Meanwhile in 8E, the story is more subtle, but the main lore story is no longer in focus. I prefer 8E due to its replayability, there are so many different paths to go down while playing, and you can start your adventure in a specific time period with your character. Not to mention that you can create multiple characters, and your new character can meet up with your previous character that you completed the game with. Kinda cool to me at least.. I think both 8XL & 8E are great at least. In their own ways."
dynastywarriors,2xunvc,zIRaXor,1 point,Fri Mar 6 02:12:14 2015 UTC,The game for pc should really cost as much as the ps3 version that is the only bad thing I feel about it >_<
dynastywarriors,2xunvc,ama8o8,1 point,Fri Mar 6 22:09:18 2015 UTC,"It's pretty good.  Missions can get repeated sometimes if you end up defending the same territory over and over again.  Really easy to rack up thousands of kills.  The game is cake up through normal, easy on Hard, and pretty tough on Chaos.  It seems like there's a genuine lack of knockback in this game.  Sometimes it can be difficult to tell that you took damage, and you'll wonder why your health bar is low.  Enemy AI is pretty simple.  Chase you, occasionally swing, occasionally musou, attack the nearest base.  Musou will take you out if you're hit, so when fighting officers don't start long attack chains that you can't cancel.  If you're surrounded, common soldiers will take advantage of your attack cooldowns and hit you from behind.  Thus your health gets chipped away.  Customization and kingdom control are 100%.  DW8 was a pretty good DW, IMO.  DW8E is thus a pretty good Empires game."

dynastywarriors,2xorg3,Hero-Sloth,3,Mon Mar 2 17:32:49 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend XL if you've never played Dynasty Warriors before. Empires is fun (for me, personally) because it's kind of like a sandbox with all the characters you know from the main games and how the story would be different if different things happened. Obviously you miss out on that if you're not familiar with the characters or story. Xtreme Legends (or, perhaps better yet, the base game) actually lets you get to know the characters and the story a bit.  Of course, if you're already familiar with the Romance of the Three Kingdoms story, you can probably more or less get the same enjoyment out of Empires without playing any of the other Dynasty Warriors games."
dynastywarriors,2xorg3,GGProfessor,2,Mon Mar 2 23:50:41 2015 UTC,In that case I'm gonna pick up XL when I can.  If I like it then I might pick up Samurai Warriors 4 II if it gets a Western release.
dynastywarriors,2xorg3,Enzedderr,1 point,Mon Mar 2 23:56:40 2015 UTC,Definitely a good plan. For new players DW8:XLCE gives the current best available experience as GGProfessor mentioned.

So now my hype is basically killed, because I feel like we'll end up getting the watered down textures/etc of the ps3 version.  In terms of online, the lack of online hasn't bothered me (then again,none of my friends play).

I don't mind the lack of online that much even if it's clearly not the first Empires title for pc or another retail game, however the flaws are not something that a free Nobunyaga set can hide..    I remember myself being surprised when reviews in japan gave it a lower score than DW7E but I can see the reasons now, considering it was even worse on consoles when it was released. There was so much talk about Koei's exploring possibilities of the pc from the DW8XL pc fans, but now it just feels like Koei is just throwing a bone on pc fans.

For starters:   Everyone starts at the same level, and you'll find early game most everyone falls to you easily, just because as the main character you level so much quicker. If you take time out from battling to improve buildings, relations, try some more political tricks or the like, the computer still levels up. Late game, if you haven't got yourself a decent weapon, can be a pain. Plus if you don't rest up, your stats plummet. Which symbols? Merits are just this games name for exp. You can do a lot as a common officer, but far from everything. Some things unlock as rank increases, done as your good/bad karma builds."
dynastywarriors,2xlpo2,NiceAndTruthful,4,Sun Mar 1 22:34:09 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the help :D. The merits now make so much more sense when I look at them as exp.   The symbols at the top where it states your name and level, I know what the symbols are, but if I am just an officer, does it still read it as that is the total number of troops for the whole kingdom or just me? Same goes for material and gold. It would be weird if i could sell all my kingdoms materials.   Also if that shows the whole kingdoms troops, how do I look at my own? Or restore other officers troops?  In the last empires I played there was this big deal about the yellow turbans, but it was just a quick 5 minute battle and the yellow turban was destroyed. Is that all? Very lackluster if there is no big celebration and it was like nothing happened.  Edit: As an officer what kind of choices can I make? I don't really understand how my choices effect the kingdom or it just me trying to improve myself?"
dynastywarriors,2xlpo2,NiceAndTruthful,2,Sun Mar 1 22:57:32 2015 UTC,"The resources are the kingdoms, not just yours (Which can be an ache if you're a prefect with moron of leader who refuses to build sufficient mines...), as to why you have access to them? I assume its to help actually be able to afford some of the higher cost things to do. 5000 gold is a bugger to get if you don't have access to a kingdom and you're trying to be good/moral.  The Kingdoms troops are where you get your own from. The total number able to be taken into battle is shown at the start of fights. If you're arranging the invasion, you can allocate all the units yourself, if not you get give a number depending on the leaders whims (Generally they  just give all the officers as fair a number of troops until they run out)  Restoring other officers health is something you can do, (Your health and therefore total stats decreases as you battle more and more, to show fatigue.)  Koei do seem to be relying more and more on players in head plots and less on writing up their own. Few interactions between officers, big battles are just... battles like any other."
dynastywarriors,2xlpo2,buffalo_x,2,Mon Mar 2 00:54:08 2015 UTC,"This is definitely one of the most bogus empires I have played. Just seems like you make a choice that doesn't matter, then go to battle. I really enjoyed DW 5 Empires because it was like you could pick a card and you could see it's effect. and the cutscenes from the big battles like the Yellow Turban Rebellion or even Dong Zhou were really cool and you could tell that was the big battle.   I appreciate your help on this one though! I understand it a little better but I'll probably be tossing this game into my backlog of games."

dynastywarriors,2xmzht,WarTaak,2,Mon Mar 2 04:46:36 2015 UTC,"I'm actually right there with you. I enjoyed my playthrough, but I don't know how much there is for me to keep playing with. I'd add these to your list of issues:   I liked the Edit Mode, but I like to create authentic-looking Edit Offcers. For this game, I tried to recreate the outfits from Dynasty Warriors Blast. But despite the breadth of options, a lot of them just aren't suitable. It's ridiculous that I can make someone with blue skin, but I can't make someone with Sun Quan's hair color. I hate that the game just completely ignores canon relationships. If I'm playing a historical scenario, I shouldn't end up with Sun Shangxiang giving Sun Ce a love confession or Guan Yu and Zhang Fei betraying Liu Bei. Is it really that hard to establish these things at the start of a scenario? Allied ruler AI is just stupid. Sun Jian absolutely refused to do any drafting, so the only soldiers our army had were the ones I gathered myself as an officer. He'd launch invasions against enemies that had a 20,000+ advantage in terms of troops. So. Many. Typos. Seriously, Koei, whoever you've got testing these things out in QA is terrible. I'd do a better job. The Scenario Editor takes way too long and isn't nearly flexible enough. I like to try to create historical scenarios, but you can't even change the year and stop Zhang Jiao or Dong Zhuo from showing up alongside Sima Zhao or Jia Chong.   I mean, I'm glad I have it, but this is the one Warriors game that I won't feel compelled to own on each platform. I have the PS4 version, but I don't think I'll get the Steam version at all."

Anyways, I do wish canon relationships would be recognized as well, that would make things soo much better. I haven't experienced a dumb ruler AI just yet, but I'm sure I'll find it soon. And good lord the typos.. Zhen Ji is one thing now? I don't think so.    I feel like it's a good game, but it does have a lot wrong with it currently. I'm sure with some polish from Koei which they seem to be showing, specially the Japanese verison, it should be great!"
dynastywarriors,2xmzht,IrisDreadnought,1 point,Mon Mar 2 08:17:04 2015 UTC,"Regarding the female names: as of Dynasty Warriors Next, Koei decided to start eliminating spaces from their names, which makes sense for ""Sun Shangxiang,"" ""Wang Yuanji,"" and ""Diaochan,"" but makes absolutely no sense for ""Zhenji"" (Zhen is her surname, Ji is her title), ""Daqiao"" (Qiao is her surname, and Da means big), or ""Xiaoqiao"" (same thing as with her sister).

I believe 7 empires was as well. Like the song list goes from #100 to #500 randomly in 8 Empires. So either there's a glitch or DLC.

XL will get you straight to the action, while Empires will require some management aspects in between all the battles."

Empires kind of assumes you already know the characters and a lot about how the games work, so it doesn't give you a lot to get to know them or their stories, and doesn't give you much of a tutorial.  Xtreme Legends, meanwhile, will let you familiarize yourself with the characters and the story. I haven't played it, personally (I usually just get the base games and the Empires games), but it seems like a pretty good place to start with the series."
dynastywarriors,2xkq58,CunningScoundrel,2,Sun Mar 1 17:18:53 2015 UTC,"My first play through was as a ruler and im currently playing while following a ruler. I was able to do random quest on the side to get weapons and such, which you cant do as a ruler, and then i was promoted to prefect, so no more quest, and its pretty much the same as a ruler just with less things to do. So as a free officer/vagabond/or just basic officer in a force, you are able to do quest to get weapons(and some of them are decent) which you cant do when you are in a ruling position(prefect+)"

If the territory didn't have an item shop or weapon forge to begin with, one would never show up.    I am only ~4 years through my first game, but this is a big problem if true... There doesn't seem to be as active of AI as there was in Empires 7/6 which is the main source of any dynamic fun.  They make alliances and invade sure, but I'll have to check numbers on the others.  I wish there would at least be a recap of what the officers in your territory did each month so I know they are active."
dynastywarriors,2xjwzu,BLACK_W4T3R,2,Sun Mar 1 13:54:22 2015 UTC,"That doesn't happen, AFAIK. You're on your own if you're playing under a ruler. AI never really does anything, outside of what you do. Might as well take every promotion you can get so you can gain the weapons, items and stratagems you could use.

dynastywarriors,2xjwzu,BLACK_W4T3R,2,Mon Mar 2 15:25:31 2015 UTC,"I was having the same problem as you were until I got promoted to a prefect on my first playthrough.

dynastywarriors,2xjwzu,Astalto,2,Sun Mar 1 15:28:53 2015 UTC,"Yep. Common officers don't benefit, but Prefects can build on their territory, and marshals/strategists can build anywhere.   The AI only builds Training Grounds, Mines, and Marketplaces."

dynastywarriors,2xi3e3,TheAyatollahOfTrolla,3,Sun Mar 1 00:01:40 2015 UTC,"Regarding defensive battles: you'll lose some officers if your Secondary Base gets taken, even if you win the battle. You won't lose the city, but you will get a ""Narrow Victory"" message.  As far as how to make them easier: use the ""Fortify Bases"" command to pump up your frontline bases and secondary camp. This is very necessary when defending, less so when attacking. The enemy tends not to take the offensive when it's defending, so it's less of a concern there unless you're outnumbered."
dynastywarriors,2xi3e3,ScubaSteeeve,1 point,Sun Mar 1 00:56:46 2015 UTC,For split screen before you go to battle and your selecting your officers that's when you can choose to play split screen by touching the touch pad on the 2nd controller
dynastywarriors,2xi3e3,Cacahuates915,1 point,Sun Mar 1 00:22:21 2015 UTC,Yes that is the way to do it in invasion/defensive battles however there is no split screen support for raids and quests. There is online co-op however no split screen which is a real turn off for me. I love a lot of the changes to the system... but the fact I can only split screen for major battles sucks hard.  AFAIK there is no way to local co-op quests and raids. This is mainly because they only provide benefits to you the player where as battles are for the kingdom. I like this new separation but the fact that my friend and I have to rotate controller half the time because he can't split screen in annoys me to no end.
dynastywarriors,2xi3e3,Enzedderr,1 point,Mon Mar 2 00:20:06 2015 UTC,"Like the other guy said, it's from losing your secondary base. The little stone fort icon. You can prioritize defending that and still be fine, so long as you take time to defend the main base if they go over there.   Defending should be the easiest option available to you. 5 minutes of officer combat. Recovery turrets are immensely helpful if available. Just put officers to Defend. Throw a turret at the base with the largest collection of your AI officers, and try and handle the rest. You'll want to beef up the fort farthest away from you that will be hardest to defend, or in some cases, Summon an officer there, throw a turret so they won't die, and head to the main melee.  When you say super buff, do you mean like when they (and their troops) have immense health bars? I really haven't found a suitable explanation for why that occurs."
dynastywarriors,2xi3e3,RaithMoracus,1 point,Sun Mar 1 01:27:01 2015 UTC,I started off by leveling up the bases furthest away but came to realise it's not worth it because they will fall eventually and you only need to to defend your main and secondary base for 5 minutes.
dynastywarriors,2xi3e3,CroakDream,1 point,Sun Mar 1 06:53:26 2015 UTC,"If you're not a primary officer (and therefore don't control just who and how much you throw at the defense), and you're playing at higher levels with large health bars/buffs on the enemy team, sometimes you really want to delay that second squad.   I'm not really suggesting it for standard maps with easy navigation, but if you're on a larger one where you're starting at the other end of the map from the Secondary Base, well, it's preferable. Some of them I had to retry quite a few times to make it through, and what I said was arguably necessary to complete it.   Maybe not at a higher skill level, or with a larger understanding of the game mechanics, but learning why it was only a Narrow Victory repeatedly, the hard way, and finding a way to prevent that on Chaos Mode, did lead me to that strategy."
dynastywarriors,2xi3e3,RaithMoracus,1 point,Sun Mar 1 07:12:41 2015 UTC,"In defensive battles I always just reduce the number of men I give to my officers to as little as possible. The goal is to only have one or two bases to defend.  It's super risky in that if you fail, you lose everything almost instantly.  However, it makes defense incredibly easy as all the enemy heroes are going to charge one spot and you can slaughter them all there."
dynastywarriors,2xi3e3,umiman,1 point,Sun Mar 1 01:42:09 2015 UTC,"i've noticed the defending difficulty spike as well.

The Sima family, Lu Bu, Chen Gong, etc, will ask for advancement pretty often. Lu Bu paid 1000 for Prefect, then 2000 for Strategist. Etc, rinse, lather, repeat. You'd have to be a ruler though. Prefect won't do anything for you.   Sima Yi does seem to have some large boost towards the political actions. Maybe you're right and it's the Fixed Strategy? I wouldn't know however.  E: for military strategy benefits, some of them aren't always available. Ultimate Training, namely. There's also Compassion and a couple others I can't think of. I'm not sure about anything in other contexts like you're talking with Sima Yi."

As mentioned, local co-op is only available in major battles, not in quests and raids. Online co-op is available for everything. This is because raids and quests heavily impact the solo stats of your character (I think). Raids and quests build your name while battles build your kingdom. I like this approach however hate the lack of local co-op.  DW7:E, everything was local co-op or online co-op. The difference is that there was not such a huge gap between solo/kingdom. The only issue was that the second person was just a tag along however I still enjoyed the ability and loved playing it with friends."

dynastywarriors,2xeptb,GGProfessor,3,Fri Feb 27 23:35:29 2015 UTC,"From what I heard, the framerate is absolute trashpretty bad on the PS4 version, don't know how TK fucked that up. If you want 60 frames, play on PC. Although you might want to wait and see if they are going to fix all the bugs on PC version.  The only real advantage PS4 has over PS3 is lots of on screen enemies at the same time. Otherwise it's not that great honestly. The high texture doesn't really hold up, every has a ""fake"" look.  Edit: this is why we need Eurogamer to do a ""face-off"" article to give some hard numbers, seriously. Even 30 fps is ""fine"" to some people (no, I'm not just bashing console gamers, there are plenty of PC gamers that swear they get 60 fps on the latest AAA games on their 4 year old machine) but it's very easy to tell dips when you get used to 60.   This is not exactly a AAA game, so not a lot of coverage. Still, if you want some sources in English (it's a pretty well know issue among taiwanese and chinese DW fans):  http://www.gamrreview.com/review/92495/dynasty-warriors-8-empires-ps4/   Other issues, like a frenetic camera that gets lost in giant crowds, and framerate dips can sometimes hinder the experience, but for the most part everything else seems to work as it should.   http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2015/02/27/review-dynasty-warriors-8-empires/136745/   Sure, there can be tens, if not a hundred enemies on screen at once, but not only are they carbon copies of one another, but when special musou attacks go off, the frame rate can slow down to a crawl.   http://gamingbolt.com/dynasty-warriors-8-empires-review   Enemies are clones of each other, many animations appear clunky and awkward and the frame rate dips often and at the oddest times. Whatever the case may be on the PS4, it’s safe to say that the Xbox One should be capable of a better looking Dynasty Warriors than this.   http://gamepinion.org/2015/02/25/review-dynasty-warriors-8-empires-ps4-reviewed/   Visually the game is more or less the same as last years Xtreme Legends. There are some issues with frame rate, but it’s something that the series has always struggled with, considering it’s expansive scale."
dynastywarriors,2xeptb,gotta_ban_them_all,2,Sat Feb 28 04:00:11 2015 UTC,The PS4 frame rate is perfectly fine. Don't know where you are getting your info from.
dynastywarriors,2xeptb,NotSafeForShop,2,Sat Feb 28 14:53:14 2015 UTC,"So it sounds like, whether the PS4 has framerate issues or not, I'm not missing out on much by getting the PS3 version. Just some more units on the screen? Not a big deal to me."
dynastywarriors,2xeptb,gotta_ban_them_all,2,Sat Feb 28 22:43:13 2015 UTC,"Right, if you already have a PS4, then get the PS4 version, it's not like Dynasty Warriors games on PS3 runs butter smooth either. But if you don't already have one, this game is not worth getting a PS4 for, just go with the PS3 version."
dynastywarriors,2xeptb,sweeten16,1 point,Sun Mar 1 03:31:16 2015 UTC,What about xbox one framerate? Is it bad?
dynastywarriors,2xeptb,RaithMoracus,1 point,Sat Feb 28 07:22:56 2015 UTC,"I haven't noticed anything. I think I found two Xbox One reviews, and neither mentioned it either.   Sometimes I'll have some minor pop-up issues. Walk into a base and run into a spot turret that wasn't there 5 feet ago, but that's whatever. It stays pretty stable using Instant-On, over a few days, too. So no memory leaks or anything like Ghosts had going on.   The lack of a 'Saved' notification messes with me. Occasionally (rarely) it will show a brief slow-down returning to the menu from saving, but that lasts less than a second.  Loading screens still suck. The loading between every cut scene is an enjoyment killer, and makes Alliance/Serve offers from Vagabond Units a major pain in the ass.   No other issues with performance I can think of. Every menu option has a loading screen. There's no help when it comes to controls (I was halfway into my first playthrough when I learned how to use Stratagems. In my second playthrough when I learned how to use Rage.).   Achievements don't always pop. Lack of popular interest makes it difficult to understand the full requirements. It's too bad developers don't provide steps/lists like Xbox does with its Preview Dashboard Quests. Sometimes they'll pop up later after coming back to the game. Some of them I'm kinda scratching my head wondering how I didn't earn it.   I've still put probably 20+ hours into it by now, though. So yeah, no framerate issues that I know of."

Things like that. I remember my character dismounting off a horse and getting teleported onto the top of a tower. I also remember an enemy reinforcing me and becoming my ally...  There's a lot of translation issues. For example, it would confuse the attackers and defenders a lot in event messages, making you confused. Also some typos here and there and I even saw a few names being given to the wrong people.  Unit pop-in is crazy in this. I'm pretty sure it wasn't this bad in Xtreme Legends. Here units will pop in right in front of your face. It's like you're getting ambushed everywhere."

dynastywarriors,2x9p95,tairy-greene-machine,2,Thu Feb 26 21:53:09 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand your question. In DW empires you have to capture smaller bases to connect your supply line from your main base to theirs in order to get their leader to appear and then kill them to take the territory. You can also play as a vagabond and do varipus other mission types but as far as i can tell most people just play as a ruler since that is the only way to ""win"""
dynastywarriors,2x9p95,tairy-greene-machine,1 point,Thu Feb 26 22:06:37 2015 UTC,Ok sounds somewhat similar to Hyrule Warriors. Is the whole game co-op? And can both players play as custom characters at once?
dynastywarriors,2x9p95,tairy-greene-machine,2,Thu Feb 26 22:09:42 2015 UTC,there is co-op and online co-op in DW8E but i don't know what types of missions allow it. You can both play custom characters but you have to set it up so that the 2nd player character is in the 1st player's army/vagabond unit before you start the battle.
dynastywarriors,2x9p95,Pulviriza,1 point,Thu Feb 26 22:20:50 2015 UTC,"Weird, some battles wouldn't allow it?"
dynastywarriors,2x9p4z,fbrushfire,2,Thu Feb 26 20:08:08 2015 UTC,Free officers are just free officers available for recruitment. Vagabond units is a group of free officers. I've seen someone mention that in DW8:E vagabond units can revolt against your Kingdom.
dynastywarriors,2x9p4z,CroakDream,1 point,Thu Feb 26 21:10:37 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay!  That's pretty cool. So you can't recruit vagabond units and they just kinda... sit around until they decide to revolt, or?"

dynastywarriors,2x7ryi,Saerjin,1 point,Thu Feb 26 08:44:23 2015 UTC,"Uhn, I'm not entirely sure if any of the games are quite out for the Xbone at the moment..Koei in general seems to prefer Sony consoles, so I do hope you have one.  Generally, there's three versions of every Dynasty Warrior game by now. Vanilla, Xtreme Legends, and Empires.  Vanilla is, well. Vanilla. The base game.  Xtreme Legends is a expanded version of the base game in some way or another, usually, it will let you play the new content on it's own, but to play the content in the base game, you'll need to ""link"" it with the vanilla version, so you'll need both.  Empires is a bit more strategic, mixing the Romance of Three Kingdoms series of Koei with DW. It's standalone, and usually with a create-a-character option, which is nowadays limited only to it.  There's also Samurai Warriors, and Warriors of Orochi, the only other two ""warriors"" series of Koei that will probably continue running for any extended period of time.  My first DW game, proper, was 7, skipped over Xtreme Legends because I wasn't entirely willing to shell out the money at the time, along with Empires because no english dub.  8, meanwhile, I did get vanilla + Xtreme Legends, and it was pretty alright.  Assuming you have a PS3/PS4 for 8, either can work to getting you back in, hopefully!  If you have any particular questions, ask away."
dynastywarriors,2x7ryi,LockedupScarlet,1 point,Thu Feb 26 11:16:40 2015 UTC,"Get the ""Dynasty Warriors 8 Extreme Legends Complete Edition"" (""Shin Sangoku Musou 7 with Mushouden"" in Japanese) if you are on XBone, note it does not come with all the DLCs. It's basically Vanilla and Xtreme Legends but it's still plenty of contents.  Worry about the rest later if you like DW8XLCE, which is the ""core"" game."
dynastywarriors,2x7ryi,gotta_ban_them_all,1 point,Thu Feb 26 14:07:14 2015 UTC,"Is base DW or XLCE available for Xbox One? I think we've only got Warriors Orochi 3 and Empires.   Empires has been fun. I've put a couple nights into it by this point. Took one playthrough to get used to it, but my second playthrough was in Chaos Mode and aside from being extravagantly frustrating to start out in, I found it pretty enjoyable. I'm trying to get all titles in this playthrough, and going back to Normal is really just too easy.   I wish there was a bit more emphasis in character personality, rather than the free-form ""Be who you want to be"". Also I could swear Lu Bu used to play a larger role. I barely see him in this.  It's also a bit easy to game once you're established enough. In my Chaos playthrough I scouted their best warriors before fighting them, and by the end, Threatened my way to Victory since I had the largest collection of Level 50+ officers. Seriously, I rolled over 6 or 7 countries using Threaten. The entire southern half of the map.   But if you just want to get back into the swing of things, I really don't think you'd have any reason to complain with Empires."

dynastywarriors,2x2jit,ScubaSteeeve,9,Wed Feb 25 03:12:12 2015 UTC,"The DW series definitely needs it. I love the games but there are a lot of redundancies in their design.  They aren't strategy games, no matter how much think they are. KOEI need to up the difficulty to create more challenge, and be a little more concise with what they are trying to achieve.  I'd like to see them attempt duels again, or really amp up the general vs. general. Perhaps they should take a bit of inspiration from Brutal Legend (albeit do it better) by having bases that can generate different kinds of siege weapons or units (ones that actually have a significant effect on the battle). I feel like they need to put players on the defensive a little more, instead of rewarding them for going in guns blazing. Maybe even make it more MOBA-like. Just give us something that has a little more theory to it.  Dynasty Warriors combat is intense, fun and cathartic, but I feel like it's wasted on a game that doesn't really know what it wants to be. I think they need to go back to the drawing board, but keep the combat the same (unlike what they did with DW6, were they changed the combat but left everything else the same). Honestly I'd enjoy it if they ditched the whole strategy element all together, and just made it an arcadey beat em' up."
dynastywarriors,2x2jit,ITSTIMETODDDDDDDDUEL,4,Wed Feb 25 12:24:20 2015 UTC,"This so much.  The series really is in need of SOMETHING, but they can't and mustn't do what they did in DW6.  The combat system was kinda jacked, while nothing else changed."
dynastywarriors,2x2jit,ChillyToTheBroMax,2,Wed Feb 25 15:47:20 2015 UTC,One huge thing I'm hoping for is making each character more unique. While playing hyrule  warriors each character played crazy different. Playing dynasty warriors again makes it feel more generic to me.   I'm sure it's hard to make the 100 or so characters unique.   I guess I'm just wanting CAG combat in my dynasty warriors.
dynastywarriors,2x2jit,cg001,1 point,Wed Feb 25 15:02:54 2015 UTC,"That's also attributed to the fact that the characters of Hyrule have already been explored and narrated over, in their past games."

dynastywarriors,2x2jit,Lensecandy,6,Wed Feb 25 23:40:35 2015 UTC,"There's a full interview coming with Akihiro Suzuki later this week. Expect to see it up here (either from me or someone else) when it happens.  Not sure if anyone is still following Dynasty Warriors Blast (I, personally, stopped playing shortly after they started doing all of the promos), but they recently added a whole bunch of characters. Among the new additions, however, are ""evolved"" versions of the two Qiao sisters that look a bit more, for lack of a better term, grown-up. It's worth noting that these designs are unique among the game, as they're still recognizable as the original characters but have a totally new design (the alternate versions of other characters in the game are all either past games' designs or collaborations with outside artists that look nothing like Koei's version of the characters).  Daqiao Xiaoqiao  Personally, I'm rather pleased with these. It always bothered me that Sun Quan's wife looked so much older than Sun Ce and Zhou Yu's wives. Here's hoping that they bring these designs in to Dynasty Warriors 9."
dynastywarriors,2x2jit,ParkJiMin,3,Wed Feb 25 03:13:01 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, that new design for Daqiao is beautiful. I wonder if they'd carry it over to 9, I wasn't too fond of her looking so doll like in 8. 3 and 5 were my personal favorite outfit designs."

dynastywarriors,2x2jit,Lensecandy,1 point,Wed Feb 25 03:38:15 2015 UTC,"Perhaps they'll revamp the gameplay by adding other warrior's gameplay features in the original game. Hopefully they'll develop it with the pc port already in mind, although I'm concerned about how they'll execute it, since trend of making new games is getting shorter and resources are scarcer. I hope the sales from the DW8 games are enough to make Dw9 worth of a quality investment."
dynastywarriors,2x2jit,Forest-Law,1 point,Wed Feb 25 11:42:39 2015 UTC,"This series has near unlimited potential, yet they are very slow to explore new ideas and make drastic changes. I think they should choose one path whether it's strategy or beat 'em up and focus primarily on that. Fans might not agree but i feel like cleaning up and starting fresh will do wonders.   Some ideas:   Cut the characters down to 20 or 30(most popular) Reduce the amount of square/triangle combos and focus on giving each character fun and diverse moves that transition well into eachother (allowing the player to create his/her own combos).  Keep only one musou attack for each character and make it much harder to fill up the gauge. Reduce the map count and focus on having better designed maps that offer more diverse gameplay styles. Cut the amount of soldiers on the map by a significant amount (like 50-60%).  Give soldiers a much better AI and scale them with ranks. Instead of running into 50 privates and killing them in one slash, let me see two groups of 5 competent AI instead. Make groups of archers deadly on any difficulty. Place them in strategical spots and give us options for engagement. Imagine arriving at Hu Lao Gate to be greeted with arrows pouring down with brief intervals (with the huge decrease of soldiers on the field, it'll make it possible without huge framedrops). Clean up the UI. The map, dialog box and health/musou bars are too damn large. Zoom the damn camera out a bit. I can't see enough of what's going on when my character takes up so much screen space.   Honestly, i just want more focus on overall quality in every area. The series always had huge amounts of content. I'd rather they reduce that and focus on everything else. Maybe the specific things i mentioned aren't ideal for dw, but rather a new series. I would just like to see them headed towards a more polished and less chaotic path."
dynastywarriors,2x2jit,TheMistyHaze,5,Wed Feb 25 22:41:24 2015 UTC,"I strongly disagree on the characters part. Every character has SOME diehard fans, and it's downright foolish to cut them, as DW6's lackluster reception showed. I'd propose, as an alternative, a modular system where the core game is focused on select characters and highly refined. The other characters would be Free Mode/Conquest or Ambition Mode only initially. Then, the DLC would be additional, fully-loaded campaigns centered around the other characters. It would integrate into the main story, but it wouldn't affect the focus of the main game. It'd be priced a bit high, but hopefully no more ridiculous than the current DLC is (I'd pay $10 for six to eight characters' worth of additional content)."

People on the KW forums have already gotten their hands on physical copies (not all stores enforce release dates).

dynastywarriors,2wlfh6,sircastic09,1 point,Sat Feb 21 00:03:50 2015 UTC,Definitely story first.  Good way to test out movesets.  Battles are more engaging. Unlocks characters in a reasonable fashion.
dynastywarriors,2wi7rz,NotHideyoshi,5,Fri Feb 20 02:46:46 2015 UTC,"Dynasty Warriors is about the Three Kingdoms War. Dynasty Warriors: Empires is about a fat, pillar-weilding girl with the voice of a chipmunk and a neon green afro who goes to war against the collaborative forces of China with the help of her trusty Captain, Cao Cao. With zero context as to why  There is no real story to Empires. It's more like a board game. You have an overhead map of China with different segments owned by different rulers. You can recreate maps of China that resembles different moments in history in the normal games, or you can randomize everything so that Meng Huo, Zhenji, Huang Gai, Dian We, and Wei Yan all own their own territories and have any possible officer you can think of working for them regardless of faction. You can play as any character of your choice, and serve whoever you wish. And if serving isn't your thing, be a ruler, get your own spot of land, and fight to conquer China under your name. After each fight, territories will shift, and you can save up money to upgrade your gear and characters in an assortment of ways.  What I consider to be one of the greatest features about these games, however, is character customization. Mess with sex, skin, hair, body type, clothing, and weapon style to create whatever kind of characters you want. With the ability to choose from any EX movesets in the game, and mix and match Musou attacks from other weapons as well. Why not make twenty characters of your own and throw them into the struggle for China? If you'd like, you can make it in the options so that your custom characters can have their own territories, serve those countries, or be wandering officers that come to serve you instead.  There's plenty of other smaller features. But if anything should grip your interest, it'll probably be one of those two things."
dynastywarriors,2wi7rz,TrivialCipher,1 point,Fri Feb 20 07:12:31 2015 UTC,So is it grind-heavy? I didn't like ambition mode.
dynastywarriors,2wi7rz,TrivialCipher,1 point,Sun Feb 22 07:27:51 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't necessarily call it grind-heavy as much as RPG-esque. You start at level 1 with no real special weapons or perks. But you grow stronger as the game goes on by levelling up and spending money to upgrade yourself and your weapon. With each fight, you seize or lose territory. As well as the ability to take on mercenary missions depending on whether or not you're ruler or officer. So you won't ever be doing the same useless missions over and over in order to gain something.  With each playthrough, you'll start off small and grow larger. However, once completing a map, you can choose to carry over your gear to the next one if you wish. There's certainly character progression. But done in a much more bearable way than Ambition Mode."
dynastywarriors,2wi7rz,Brothel_Copter,4,Sun Feb 22 07:51:05 2015 UTC,"Empires has no plot or specialized battles. Instead it gives you a map of china separated into a bunch of regions, starting you with one of them. You have to grow your army while conquering other places, and there are bonuses along the way that keep it interesting.  It's a really good game for replayability"
dynastywarriors,2wi7rz,riraito,2,Fri Feb 20 04:41:51 2015 UTC,Agreed. I couldn't wait for empires and bought xtreme legends on sale. Ambition mode is close but no cigar to empires
dynastywarriors,2wi7rz,misturcheef,1 point,Fri Feb 20 06:41:26 2015 UTC,I have all empires games except for 8. Cannot wait until it comes out. 7's was awesome with the character customization.
dynastywarriors,2wi7rz,emperornel,1 point,Fri Feb 20 11:59:47 2015 UTC,Is Empires like Civilization?
dynastywarriors,2wi7rz,Brothel_Copter,1 point,Fri Mar 13 21:53:51 2015 UTC,"If you explained them vaguely, then yes. It  the elements of resource management and territory control.  It's much simpler and I personally don't think the overworld AI gets harder as you increase the difficulty. And battles are, as you can imagine, not remotely similar to civ since you're fighting and such."
dynastywarriors,2wgjum,jsilvrs,2,Thu Feb 19 19:08:37 2015 UTC,"If you are already playing XL, it's too late to do the import the save thing, unless you want to delete your XL save. You don't have any previous save right now anyway.  Just link the 2 games (Import/Mixjoy whatever it's called) and play in it XL. Back then in the earlier games, you have to do that everytime you start Xtreme Lengends, now you only/still need to do it once in a while, so don't sell your DW8 disc.  Edit: You don't really lose anything, and forging weapons in XL is so much easier. The ""downside"" is Cyclone/旋風 was insanely OP in vanilla and got nerfed, but it's still very OP on certain characters with enormous oppai."

Or for fuck's sake put out one 30 dollar package. Too much I say, too much. Their next game will get a pirate from me unless there are actually features that need paying for."
dynastywarriors,2wf67k,goingbananas44,2,Thu Feb 19 15:49:33 2015 UTC,A sense of battlefield like Dynasty Warriors 6 (pretty much only thing good about that game). Not a maze with gates and corridors.
dynastywarriors,2wf67k,gotta_ban_them_all,2,Fri Feb 20 01:29:23 2015 UTC,"PVP. Flesh out the general vs. general. Bring back duels and balance them, expand them, generate meta.  Also, put more thought into the core design of the game. Cut out everything that doesn't work, ditch or rethink the strategy elements, and put the players on the defensive. Give us challenge, because challenge gives the game meaning and more weight. Lu Bu is memorable because he butt fucks you. Give us something to fear, to overcome. Give us something to care about.  The combat is wonderful, cathartic, intense and fun, so keep it the same but expand upon it. Give us more combos, maybe add parries or counters, give it more strategy. Don't redesign it like DW6, keep it the same but give us more to explore with it, more to get better at -- players like feeling good at a game, especially when it's a fighter or a beat em' up. With that said, cut back on the avatar strength; save the ""RPG side"" for tinkering and tailoring our characters to our liking, not for making the game even easier and more exploitable than it already is.  Finally, a survival mode. Give us something to test our skill. Give us the ability to measure how good we are, so we're inspired to get better.  In summary: Challenging and concise game design. The same combat, but deeper. Rewards for our ability, not our patience for grinding. Survival mode.  Dynasty Warriors unfortunately habours a lot of daft design choices. KOEI really need to rethink how the game plays. I feel like the fun of the combat is wasted on a game that inspires no real dedication from the player. Give us more of a reason to fight, corner us, direct us through the use of adversity and dominant strategy."

I know some weapons already have it, but that's only a few and an extension would be fun for combos and such. If they can/open to, integrate special attacks like how they did for Warriors Orochi, but that's probably why EX attacks exist.  Also online play, especially when future installments get a PC port."

I got hooked and bought every single one that came after 4. 5 is currently my favorite and Zuo Chi used to be my favorite character. But now it's Lu LingQi, and I'm trying my best to find her Collab costume dlc for the PS4 on XLCE ( Xtreme legends complete edition ).  Also I think Hu Lao Gate from DW4 and Yellow Turban Rebellion from DW5 have the best background music out of all the games."

I believe it was battle of He Fei Castle Wei side, used to sit in the castle and Wu would take out the entire army then all attack the castle.   Used to love getting everyone attacking at once, haven't had a moment like that really since. Or it could just be I was younger and it seemed more epic than it was."

dynastywarriors,2wduiz,vox165,1 point,Sun Feb 22 03:36:08 2015 UTC,"I have foggy memories of playing DW3 at my cousin's house ages ago. I was absolutely terrible at the game. I'd start a new file each time I came over. Yellow Turban, Hu Lao Gate, Yellow Turban, Hu Lao Gate, Yellow Turban, Hu Lao Gate. For what must have been months of going to see my aunt and uncle overnight, I'd never managed to beat Hu Lao gate. I don't even remember who it was I played. Just that it was always the same person despite me not enjoying them very much.  Playing as Guan Yu was a brand new experience. Not only would I go on to beat Hu Lao gate, but actually get to experience the rest of the story as well. Something about him just seemed more powerful. And is probably a huge reason I ended up liking Shu so much. (Wu fanboy now. It is what it is.)  Perhaps the real reason I got hooked on the series was fulfilling that childlike satisfaction of knocking down bad guys ten at a time. Stack that on how much this game's gotten me into the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and the sheer amount of stuff to do in each game, and it quickly becomes my favorite time sink."

Bought SW4 and my god was it perfect.  Gameplay flows so well and feels so natural fitting for the genre. Between Hyper attacks, various extended combos and character swapping I just can't get enough of it. The only things that disappoints me about SW4 are the weapon customisation (having 1 style of weapon and no weapon building from DW made me cry a little) and the lack of local co-op for the adventure mode since I love playing the game with my roommate.  Definitely looking forward to future Samurai Warriors games though if they can maintain that quality and I hope the Dynasty Warriors series can learn from their gameplay changes and improve upon their own further. Its already good but I feel it could be great with just a few minor tweaks towards SW style."

It wasn't until I unlocked Cao Cao and Lu Xun's death element weapons that I was majorly hooked into the series. DW4 just improved on this with the addition of officer creation and the C3 combos. Although I can't forget Ma Chao's OP-ness when on the Shadow horse (can't be dismounted). I've stuck with DW and SW ever since, I skipped SW3 and the first bits of DW8 (I plan on getting Empires). I've played misc. other Koei games since then as well. Also haven't played SW4 although it seems like I should."

If so I would recommend going with Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends Complete Collection for PS4, as it contains an excellent story mode and the basic DW gameplay style. DW8: Empires will function differently, with no real plot and strategy elements which, while I love, make it a very different experience in some regards. Though it will also have a character creator that I think will be excellent.  As for Hyrule Warriors and what it brought to the table...for the most part it seemed to take a lot of inspiration from recent Warriors titles. I will say that even compared to the ""EX"" attacks found in DW7 and 8, Hyrule Warriors in my opinion how much more..bigger and flashier special attacks for many of it's standard moves. Impa having things like raining water knives or creating a big bubble that sucks up enemies before she slashes it open was very flashy and fun and often effective at killing large numbers of enemies. While I can't say I'd want it to go THAT over the top in future DW games, I find it's presentation to be top notch and one of the things it had that stood out to me over other DW games."

I guess based on that I will eventually check out Empires but thanks for the advice.  So without the over-the-top combo moves in HW, I'm going to expect that ""take forts to slowly build my army while handling various scenarios while at the same time completing the main goal"" type of thing.  which... is damn good in my book."
dynastywarriors,2w97h2,Saikaku,1 point,Wed Feb 18 02:07:11 2015 UTC,"Well don't get me wrong, between some characters movesets and EX attacks, there are some pretty over the top combos in the game. Just not on the level i'd put Hyrule Warriors on.  I do highly recommend Empires down the line, it is always my favorite spin off of each title. Just that DW8XLCE is so good too, and makes an excellent starting point if you've not been playing the series. Download it, enjoy the story and character progression and eventually take a shot at Empires for the unique experience it brings. :)"

There's an entire story arc dedicated to Yukimura and Nobuyuki Sanada. Munenori Yagyu and Koshosho both have character arcs that are spread out across multiple stories. We see Nagamasa Azai get fleshed out a great deal. There are a few twists thrown in, and just when you think you knew a character, you see another side of them.

dynastywarriors,2vxd89,TheAscended,1 point,Tue Feb 17 19:14:51 2015 UTC,"I outlined some of the challenges in my other comment, but here's a more technical glimpse at it.  In Japan, PC gaming isn't mainstream like it is in the West. The number of people that build PCs especially for gaming is very low, but the number of people who have PCs that just might be able to run the port of the PS3 version is a bit higher.  ""Why not just include both hi-res and low-res options?"" you may ask. The answer is simple: that's a new feature they have to code, from scratch, and doing so simply isn't cost-effective. The Japanese audience wouldn't care enough, and the Western audience isn't nearly big enough to justify it. Same reason why there isn't English voice acting this time. (Seriously, 82 characters plus NPCs. I'm pretty sure the voice acting budget for that alone would be more than whatever profit Koei makes from releasing Empires in the West.)  It might suck, but it's simply Koei acknowledging the financial situation they're in."
dynastywarriors,2vxd89,ScubaSteeeve,-1,Sun Feb 15 03:54:03 2015 UTC,"Wait empires is not going to have English voices? They just lost my purchase.  The idea that the fan base isn't big enough to support a proper port is complete nonsense and their practice to not even localize voices along with shitty ports is just a self fulfilling prophecy of not selling ""well enough."" Even though DW8XL has been the top seller on steam multiple times. Japanese companies outside of Konami have no idea how to handle western markets or PC."
dynastywarriors,2vxd89,TeHSaNdMaNS,2,Mon Feb 16 04:15:36 2015 UTC,Wait empires is not going to have English voices? They just lost my purchase.   Really?   Japanese companies outside of Konami have no idea how to handle western markets or PC.   REALLY? Do I have to bring up the trashy silent hill ports?
dynastywarriors,2vxd89,Scandalbaby,-1,Mon Feb 16 21:21:18 2015 UTC,"Yes really. I'm already irked by the poor optimization, lack of custom monitor resolution, no online play and low res textures. I however Enjoy the empires games enough to let it slide. Now that I know that they are not going to bother with localizing the damn game I say screw it.  I should have said recent konami ports, particularly MGS."
dynastywarriors,2vxd89,TeHSaNdMaNS,0,Mon Feb 16 21:26:58 2015 UTC,"The English voice acting being gone has been old news for months.  So, do you know how much money goes into making a port? It's not simply one person going, ""Okay, let me put this in the compiler, flip the toggle switch from PS4 to PC, then let's go break for coffee.""  And voice actors: around 90 voice actors, including in-demand/busy talent like Yuri Lowenthal (who voices multiple characters), Kyle Hebert, Tony Oliver, Kyle Hebert, and Vic Mignogna. The minimum rate for a voice actor is $100 an hour. Considering the sheer amount of dialogue that goes into a game, even if it takes each character actor only one eight-hour day to complete all of his/her lines (there's retakes, and as someone who's worked in a studio, let me tell you, nothing ever goes right on the first take, especially when reading from a script), you're looking at an estimated $72,000 just for voice acting, and that's a conservative estimate considering the fact that Koei has to negotiate these voice actors away from higher paying projects (seriously, which do you think pays more: Dynasty Warriors or Naruto?), you're probably looking at the game's entire localization budget.  Also, top of the Steam sales charts? Not really, not that Steam releases sales figures anyway. Compare Dynasty Warriors to a modestly popular but much older game, Just Cause 2, and you'll see that despite being two years older, Just Cause 2 almost always has had more concurrent players online than DW8XLCE, aside from very brief periods coinciding with the launch. This doesn't bode well for Steam sales.  So, how well has DW8XLCE sold for Steam? Koei hasn't released figures, but Chin (Koei's European community manager) has said on his Facebook that the numbers weren't good. And even in Japan, where the Warriors games always outsell compared to the US or European markets, DW7 Empires didn't break over 150,000 units in Japan."
dynastywarriors,2vxd89,ScubaSteeeve,2,Mon Feb 16 06:20:15 2015 UTC,"I'm well aware of what localization costs are. It's not cheap but also doesn't require huge sales to make it profitable and in the case of Koei doing a decent port of their game and actually building up a fan base would lead to greater profits.  It's also very misleading to compare a game with an established player base with an active Modding community putting out mods like the multiplayer mode. The game is better compared with games in a similar place like Konami's Metal  Gear solid franchise.  Konami is certainly pleased with their sales performance stating that PC Units accounted for 10% of all sales, outperforming the new generation consoles and all handhelds. That 10% does not include MGSV: Ground Zeroes which only released this year.  So this is another Japanese Publisher with little experience on the PC releasing a game that lots of people enjoyed, with a good port and accounting for 10% of all sales in the last fiscal year alone. I find it hard to believe that Konami can't afford to give us a decent localized port that would be profitable. Especially since a game has a much longer life on PC providing sales years after it's initial release."
dynastywarriors,2vxd89,TeHSaNdMaNS,1 point,Mon Feb 16 15:26:04 2015 UTC,"Good points, but the point remains that the Empires games are very poor sellers compared to the main titles of the series, especially overseas. I'm not saying Koei shouldn't try to improve the releases, I'm just stating that they have probably done a cost analysis and concluded that it's not worth the investment at the current point in time. I don't think boycotting the game because of one missing, non-crucial feature is likely to have any positive impact on the company's decisions in the future."
dynastywarriors,2vxd89,ScubaSteeeve,0,Mon Feb 16 20:16:14 2015 UTC,It is kind of crucial in DW8E...unless you want to stop what your doing and read the prompts every time something happens...its much easier to hear. I would gladly pay for an english language dlc. But that is just me.
dynastywarriors,2vxd89,TheAscended,1 point,Tue Feb 17 19:17:18 2015 UTC,"I'm a fast reader, and I'd like English voice DLC, too. But I doubt there'd be enough of us for Koei to justify it. I'd honestly be surprised if enough Western copies of the game sell to even cover the cost of hiring English VAs, never mind all the other expenses.  Plus, the VAs themselves might not have been available, too. They might have more lucrative projects going on. In fact, Dynasty Warriors is pretty much a side gig for any voice actors, as it's a non-union position. (Steve Blum used to do the voice of Sun Jian, but he flat out denied it.) If they have something with a bigger budget going on concurrently, they might have actually told Koei ""no."" And DW5XL shows us what happens when they hire replacements for just the new lines (Sun Jian and Zhou Yu sounding nothing alike in their DW5XL lines versus their DW5 lines)."

The PC versions of DW4 through DW7, and especially Warriors Orochi, were actually capable of far outclassing the console versions visually. And compared to the PS3 version of DW8, it still does. But the PS4 is Koei's cash cow.  I expect the next iteration of the series to fix this issue, though that's just speculation at this point. As for the people saying that it would be easy for Koei to release the game with the PS4-level graphics, well, yes, the resources are there, but it's not as easy as it sounds like. PC gaming is a niche in Japan, and the cost to make sure that high-res textures work smoothly on PC would probably negate any revenue they make from PC sales."

I'd say the combat gameplay is on par with WO3 if not a little better and more fluid depending on used weapon. And since it is on sale for $18, it wouldn't be too bad to pick it up.

Each installment is like a whole new game, and the search for English VAs is probably conducted by different people or third parties each time.  Getting DW to the states anyway with dubs is probably not easy, so they may not be able to stay consistent with VAs.  Just guessing.  DW4 was what I first played too, I remember doing Unification of Jiang Dong runs to get HP and Musou upgrades to fully max characters.  I miss the old Jiang Wei, Zhao Yun, Ma Chao, Sun Jian, Liu Bei, Guan Yu, Sun Ce, and Cao Cao voice actors too.  Zhou Yu's voice and weapon were great too."

dynastywarriors,2vf5or,Drummermean,2,Wed Feb 11 11:15:03 2015 UTC,"It goes as far as where Sima Yi essentially overthrows the Wei government to form Jin. Then it has a little bit at the right end where you see Sima Yi and his grandson (Sima Yan, who founded the Jin dynasty), to insinuate the ending of the 三国 era. It doesn't explicitly show Jin conquering Shu and Wu. Honestly though, it's a brilliant series with some fantastic acting.  There's also some non-historic / non-novel subplot involving Sima Yi at the end, but you'll have to see for yourself."

dynastywarriors,2v50br,greatmuta2,2,Sun Feb 8 12:47:01 2015 UTC,"That is the self same mission.  If I recall correctly, the trick is just to send him up to the top left corner of the map, near the islands and where reinforcements come from. If he gets caught, just retreat. Once allies turn up, and if your positioning is good, you can avoid being surrounded, and then its a case of careful micro of the units and a lot of the gathered charging across the length of your ships."

dynastywarriors,2v50br,NiceAndTruthful,2,Sun Feb 8 14:45:31 2015 UTC,"Don't quit, it's a pretty easy game. You just have to use your skills as much as possible so they can level up when it starts getting harder."

dynastywarriors,2v50br,greatmuta2,2,Sun Feb 8 14:42:19 2015 UTC,"I love Kessen 2, it's a decent strategy game, but its how you use your skills that makes it really fun. You and when you beat it, you get to turn around and play as the other team, and when you beat that, you get to adjust the difficulty! The stories are silly, at least they are if you have played DW, but it really shines when you get to throw giant fireballs that destroy any enemies in their path.     Kessen 3 has a much better story, but the game play is annoying. Instead of getting into the actual battles, your whole squad moves around and attacks as a unit. This wouldn't be so bad, but it can be really buggy. Like after a couple of attacks half your team will be behind you and you will only get the damage for 1 person actually doing attacking. I know that probably doesn't make sense unless you have seen a video or played the game, but trust me it will piss you off to no end. You also end up with a really massive roaster of units, which is way too much to put into any battle, and if you try to level them all you fall behind altogether. However, if you only level a specific group, another unit could be forced into the battle and get it's ass handed to it. TLDR: Kessen 3 will piss you off, but it has a good story, and may be worth the play, but I would go with Kessen 2."

dynastywarriors,2v50br,WillLie4karma,2,Thu Apr 23 21:25:54 2015 UTC,"I've only played Kessen III, and I enjoyed it a lot.  It's similar to Dynasty Warriors, but with more strategic elements, as you can give orders to the other generals and even switch control between any of them.  Also, instead of fighting as an individual you fight as a battalion (there's also plenty of variety in the different battalions; gunners, spearmen, cavalry, etc.).  It does show its age, and like most PS2-era games the controls can seem a bit wonky when compared to modern-day games, but if you enjoy Japanese history and light strategy games it's a really fun play."

The second one takes place in China during the Three Kingdoms Era.  Kessen III follows the story of Oda Nobunaga, the first of Japan's great unifiers during the Sengoku Period.  So, the first and third Kessen games take place in Japan.  And I compared the gameplay to Dynasty Warriors because it's more well-know than Samurai Warriors.  edit: So instead of admitting you're wrong you downvote me.  Really nice."

Truth be told, though, if you buy a console for Koei games, you're better off getting a Sony console. I have no dog in the console race, but the releases on the Sony consoles are always supported far more (because they sell far more).  Regarding the Steam version: you can indeed use a USB controller to play. Every Koei PC release has had controller support (they released DW4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 on PC, though only 6 and 8 came out in English, and they all work great with a controller)."

Also, their main website doesn't have the 360 logo anywhere, so it doesn't look like there will be a release for the platform.  As for the steam version, I use a 360 gamepad while playing DW8:XL and it works fine. I had to setup up the controller in the options with my own button layouts, but other than that it worked great. One thing to point out though, XL on steam, the vibration didn't work. There were ways of getting around that and allowing it to work though the use of third party software though, but hopefully they'll sort that out for Empires."

dynastywarriors,2uryud,Captain-Justice,2,Wed Feb 4 18:00:02 2015 UTC,"For Dynasty Warriors 8XL, Co-op is available in all Free Mode levels and I think all challenges (separate record tables for single player and co-op for the challenges). In Story Mode, there must be two playable characters for 2P to join in (so Lu Bu's first mission, which only has one playable character, must be played in Single Player Story Mode). In Ambition mode, you must have two playable officers available.  With Empires, I'd expect it to be the same as with prior iterations: You must have access to two Playable Officers to have Co-op, and 1P will be making pretty much all the decisions (including what character 2P uses)."
dynastywarriors,2uryud,kitsunezeta,1 point,Wed Feb 4 21:08:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the information. I remember often being accompanied by another playable character ally in previous iterations - would you say that the majority of missions would be open to local multiplayer with the odd one being single player only? It is good to hear it is open for most modes though! I'll wait until reviews for Empires roll our before seeking more information on that, but it does hold great appeal to me. I appreciate you taking the time to get back to me!"
dynastywarriors,2uryud,kitsunezeta,2,Wed Feb 4 21:37:23 2015 UTC,"I believe the number of Story Mode missions that only have one playable officer is less than... 5? I can only think of one off the top of my head, and that's Lu Bu's first story mission. In any case, those are the exceptions, not the norm.  In any case, once a mission is unlocked in free mode, you are allowed to play it with any officer(s) in both single player and Co-op inside Free Mode."
dynastywarriors,2uryud,WillLie4karma,1 point,Wed Feb 4 22:04:08 2015 UTC,"That's excellent, thanks for that. I just need to learn a bit more about the other two and I can make an informed decision, but that does sound like a good chunk of content."
dynastywarriors,2uryud,WillLie4karma,2,Wed Feb 4 23:05:00 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what you spend most of your time doing. If it's the grind of leveling all your characters and making perfect weapons (which is what I like to do) than I would suggest DW8. I like the combat better in SW4, but you only level to 50 and the weapon customization is really lacking. I didn't care much for Orochi 3, but I am probably a minority in that capacity."
dynastywarriors,2uryud,destructograbme,1 point,Thu Feb 5 01:40:04 2015 UTC,"I do enjoy the character progression a lot, but my co-op partner just enjoys the experience. I am quietly holding out for Empires for this very reason, however as I understand it that series is a bit less co-op friendly."
dynastywarriors,2uryud,greatmuta2,2,Thu Feb 5 08:39:55 2015 UTC,"I honestly can't speak to co-op in any game, however if what the I read the other person in here say (that it's pretty much just a few stages that have to be played solo) than I don't imagine that being too big of a deal. I did play Warriors Orochi 3 co op a lot, and it was fun. It just took too long to start every mission because the menu was you walking around a zone talking to people. However, I have been told there is a way around that. I also didn't like that you had really weird boss battles where you had to get in siege weapons and attack things."
dynastywarriors,2uryud,greatmuta2,1 point,Thu Feb 5 19:27:40 2015 UTC,"WO3 is still fun but I agree, it's the weakest of the three."
dynastywarriors,2uryud,greatmuta2,2,Sun Feb 8 13:49:53 2015 UTC,"The entire game of Samurai Warriors 4 has Co-Op support online and offline,each mission normally has you pick two officers before starting,the second player controls the second pick,I believe Chronical mode allows it but I'm not 100% sure.I know for sure it supports Online but I don't know to what capacity.  Warriors Orochi 3 ultimate has each player control a team of 3,you'll need to play some of the story to unlock some more people though as when you start you only get 3 characters.I know most modes have Co-Op,not sure about Gauntlet mode though."

dynastywarriors,2uqbxh,setsuna9039,1 point,Wed Feb 4 18:37:46 2015 UTC,it is coming feb 24. The english website mentions a demo coming before release so i'm guessing we'll get one but it doesn't say when.
dynastywarriors,2upn84,luthin2000,3,Wed Feb 4 02:44:42 2015 UTC,Timer is there forever. But it's enough time to do basically everything so don't even worry about it. I don't know anything about your other problems. I only play single player since I have zero friends.
dynastywarriors,2upn84,Degg19,2,Wed Feb 4 04:10:11 2015 UTC,"The invincible enemies were objective based,most likely Supply Captains you didn't kill in time or enemies who are going to defect."

dynastywarriors,2uk585,DjSlugger,1 point,Mon Feb 2 21:16:10 2015 UTC,So honest question whats the difference between Sengoku Basara and Samurai Warriors?
dynastywarriors,2uk585,cryoh,2,Tue Feb 3 19:34:56 2015 UTC,SB is quicker with a greater emphasis on flash and combos. SW is more about the typical DW gameplay style of missions and such.
dynastywarriors,2uk585,Lylim,1 point,Tue Feb 3 20:55:46 2015 UTC,This is Japanese only is it not? I wish I could get a copy.

dynastywarriors,2uk585,Lylim,1 point,Tue Feb 3 23:05:09 2015 UTC,lol don't be sad because anything can happen.
dynastywarriors,2uk585,Pulviriza,1 point,Wed Feb 4 18:13:14 2015 UTC,This is true indeed. One can dream. The ps4 will play the international versions right?
dynastywarriors,2uacd5,Espionage724,1 point,Sat Jan 31 07:30:27 2015 UTC,My understanding is that it's the same across the board.  Obviously Upgrade Stones permanently increase stats too so characters can change that way after being promoted.
dynastywarriors,2u8wr8,cactus82,4,Fri Jan 30 22:45:05 2015 UTC,"SW4 is completely different from both games as far as movement/playstyle.  SW4 added ""Hyper Attacks"", which are a special type of attack which chains like your normal Square button, but designed specifically to do wide area damage and move you forward through waves of unnamed enemies, but get blocked by enemy generals.  Hyper Attacks made traversing around the map and the flow of combat feel very smooth and fast paced, and it also had the benefit of making it so no single character felt useless due to a lack of ability to clear large groups of enemies."
dynastywarriors,2u8wr8,eleuthria,1 point,Sat Jan 31 00:48:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the information about the hyper attacks. As you mentioned, it sounds different from Hyrule Warriors and Gundam Reborn.   I just hope I don't get burned again. But this sounds promising!"
dynastywarriors,2u8wr8,eleuthria,3,Sun Feb 1 00:14:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think you'll regret SW4.  It's a very fun game, and has the most polish (it's the newest Warriors game not counting DW8 Empires which is still an old engine).  One game you should definitely try on PS3 if it goes on sale:  One Piece Pirate Warriors 2 (or Pirate Warriors 3 for PS4 when that comes out this year).  It's worth buying at full price IMO, but if you're looking at SW4 vs PW2, I'd go with SW4.  It's digital only, so it might be a while before it goes on sale since Sony doesn't have a good history when it comes to niche titles going on sale digitally.  Every Warriors spinoff game has it's own unique twists in gameplay, and out of all the versions, Pirate Warriors 2 was my favorite game of all.  Good roster of characters, huge variety in movesets, and it's a full on Warriors game (Pirate Warriors 1 was much more platforming/environment focused, which didn't work well in a Dynasty Warriors engine).  Samurai Warriors 4 and Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate are tied for 2nd place."
dynastywarriors,2u8wr8,kaseius,2,Sun Feb 1 05:06:27 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for SW4, but check out the demo for Sengoku Basara -- basically Samurai Warriors  made by Capcom and crazy awesome."
dynastywarriors,2u8wr8,pieface42,2,Fri Jan 30 23:53:22 2015 UTC,can I do that in America? How?
dynastywarriors,2u8wr8,kaseius,3,Sat Jan 31 00:36:34 2015 UTC,"ah, sorry for the slow reply, it looks like they took the demo down some time ago for some reason... thankfully, it's pretty cheap nowadays. i'd suggest searching up some gameplay of different characters and seeing how it looks to you. i loved the game, and would say that it feels a lot closer to hyrule warriors than hyrule does to the normal musou games."
dynastywarriors,2u8wr8,pieface42,2,Sat Jan 31 02:57:05 2015 UTC,Ahh for some reason I thought you were talking about the new one that was Japanese exclusive at the moment.
dynastywarriors,2u8wr8,WindandClouds,1 point,Sat Jan 31 03:22:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I heard of the series, but didn't know it's anything like Sengoku Basara. I'll have to look into it."
dynastywarriors,2u8wr8,WindandClouds,2,Sun Feb 1 00:15:17 2015 UTC,I never found the Gundam games fun. I'm currently rockin Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate and everything looks smooth at 60fps. Though characters and movesets are outdated it's good if you like killing 1000 dudes a level... And Ayane's tits
dynastywarriors,2u8wr8,PaladinChad,1 point,Sat Jan 31 05:25:57 2015 UTC,Cool. Why didn't you find the Gundam games fun?

dynastywarriors,2tywsg,McRipYourFace,2,Wed Jan 28 15:25:09 2015 UTC,Grew up with this game and honestly my favorite characters would absolutely have to be Ma Chao & Sun Jian throughout. Always loved Ma Chao and to see he was one of the main characters in Warriors Orochi 3 was straight gaaaangsta.
dynastywarriors,2tywsg,Smoothcarpet,2,Wed Jan 28 15:29:44 2015 UTC,"My favorite character is definitely Zhou Tai. Gotta love a chinese samurai pirate.  And as far as favorite kingdom goes, I'd probably say Wu."

I would probably say that Lu Meng is my favorite character, but Taishi Ci, Huang Gai, Zhou Tai, Sun Jian, and Sun Ce are also all very high up there."
dynastywarriors,2tywsg,GGProfessor,2,Wed Jan 28 16:18:01 2015 UTC,All three kingdoms were technically dynasties. While they weren't long running or successful ones. They all had multiple leaders that the people recognized as their emperors

dynastywarriors,2tm1jm,Lifeinsteps,2,Sun Jan 25 13:34:24 2015 UTC,The Kessen series is great.  Kessen 1 is probably the weakest but has a branching narrative based on if you win/lose battles. Kessen 2 does an interesting take on the 3 kingdoms period and the cinematics are quite cool Kessen 3 is the best of the bunch as the gameplay in 1 and 2 is there weakness but Kessen 3 combines a cool narrative with pretty fun gameplay mechanics Kessen 1 and 3 are set in the Sengoku period of Japan

It was great for dealing with people that used the 1shot bullshit.  and musou spammers were the best to fuck with. the greataxe had the spell that gave you all your health back and doubled it...so i'd purposefully run into musou spammers,make them waste their musou on me (so my team doesnt get fucked),hit the spell to heal to full+double health and laugh as i proceeded to kill them.  fuck. i miss that game."

Also yes, Battle Axe was the best for gimmicky stuff like that. I unfortunately lost the screenshot, but if you put all of the tempers into Health as opposed to attack or defense, and used the ability to double your HP, you could reach the 4th bar worth of health. A full normal bar of health was something like 400, but with the B.Axe you could push it easily into the 1300 range.  Good times. :["

You level up during the battle based on k0 count, capture bases, recapture bases, get bonuses to troops or players or special area events based on which bases you control or if you activate special traps. deployable traps.

dynastywarriors,2thbi7,thomjrob,1 point,Tue Jan 27 12:17:29 2015 UTC,"Well, to add on to others, there was. It is called Dynasty warriors online. I heard the 'sequel' is based off of the engine they use in the modern series.  Anyway, why would you? Unless Koei lets another company do it, it won't be very good. My experience with DWO was not great. I liked the people I talked to on a daily basis there and the fact you made your 'own' officer. That was cool.  The main meat of the game however... Pay to win described it well. Let me set that up:  First of all, it's the standard DW gameplay, the older version. So, before DW6. It's a bit clunky, but it worked well enough. However, there was this roulette system, if I can call it that. What it did, was power up your character on the battlefield. You had certain stats, like musou, attack, speed etc. And the higher amount of stars you got, the stronger that stat would become. How do you get that though?  You need to be able to forge that. You needed in-game currency and gems to 'level up' a stat. The gem corresponded to a stat, like a red gem being attack. But the gems were usually very rare. See where this is going?  They sold those gems in the cash shop. Which automatically made you much better. But it was also very grindy, since you needed a GOOD weapon for it to matter at all. So, veterans had the upper hand all the time, and the newbies... needed to grind out a lot of gems, not to mention ranks to get better weapons, just to catch up. That's not fair. Oh, and you could also purchase armor, like boots, whole body etc. They also had stats on them.  Nevermind that though, the lag was definitely intolerable. Not so much if you played by yourself, then the game played like a somewhat normal DW game. But if you find another player, ally or enemy, you're boned. You're going to get such a hit detection lag, it was impossible to just fight other players.  And then add to that a small playerbase and cheaters... It really didn't work. It would also have a subscription at first. Can you believe that?"

It's optimized well for the vita, is similar to empires, has an I interesting online function where others' heroes can pop up in your games, and you can order a couple of your officers around the map with the touchscreen (which can be a bit janky but it's a cool feature nonetheless).

KT has been bringing almost every Warriors title over, so we'll probably get it.    Worst case scenario it doesn't come out in the US and you can probably get SW4 at a cheaper price  after waiting."
dynastywarriors,2t8fr2,eleuthria,1 point,Thu Jan 22 01:07:29 2015 UTC,"The Warriors series typically gets localized, so SW4-2 is very likely going to come over. However, it probably won't be until Q3 or Q4 of 2015, or even next year, so it's your choice if you want to wait or just play SW4 first.  As someone who got the Platinum trophy for SW4 though, I found my purchase of it very worthwhile. The gameplay is an improvement over the original Warriors series in my opinion, and the graphics are also prettier. I am definitely getting 4-2 when it is released in the west."
dynastywarriors,2t8fr2,Ryogi,2,Thu Jan 22 02:30:31 2015 UTC,"Eh, I felt like they did the character switching a lot better, much less time running from one location to another, but other than that and the charge attacks I don't feel like much has changed for the better. I feel like they made weapons and items all around worse."
dynastywarriors,2t8fr2,WillLie4karma,1 point,Thu Jan 22 02:56:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on the weapons and items. I was mostly thinking about the faster-paced combat earlier. I would have liked weapon fusion like WO3U had, for one."
dynastywarriors,2t8fr2,Ryogi,2,Thu Jan 22 03:01:27 2015 UTC,"WO2 had the best weapon system, just because you could make the most insanely devastating weapons of all time. I def agree about the battle system, I think they need to keep the goals system and character switching for all games. Nothing worse than having to ride a horse for 30 seconds at a time just to get to the guys spawning at your base."
dynastywarriors,2t8fr2,WillLie4karma,1 point,Thu Jan 22 03:22:10 2015 UTC,"I played WO2, but only on the PSP, so my memories of that game is pretty fuzzy. Having extremely powerful weapons is definitely a plus, though. I really like the switching function, since not only do you get to play with two characters in one game, you can also plan ahead, which can be quite gratifying if you planned your moves right."
dynastywarriors,2t8fr2,Ryogi,2,Thu Jan 22 03:27:38 2015 UTC,"WO2 is my favorite warriors game for a few reasons. The over powered weapons are amazing, pretty much all my characters were faster attackers than nene and spouted out lightning bolts between every character on screen like an electrical fireworks show, and most importantly having damage so high that I didn't even have to dismount half the time. Now it was not at all easy to get the perfect weapons, well, easier than finding empty weapons on DW 8, but they were well worth the effort. secondly, the final character (which was pretty much the same as regular orochi) took a LOT of work to unlock, and you basically got every achievement just trying to unlock him, so I always felt compelled to play. I ended up buying a second copy of the game just to play for a few stages because I hit my tv stand and messed up my disk after getting juggled to death by bombers."

dynastywarriors,2t3de1,pR05n1p3zy0,1 point,Tue Jan 20 21:16:12 2015 UTC,"Dynasty warriors takes place during the ""Three Kingdoms"" period of china, whereas Warriors Orochi is an alternate fictitious game where a powerful snake demon dude warps Dynasty and Samurai Warriors and other Warrior-style game characters into a new combined world.  DW gives you what is it 5 story campaigns, WO 1 long strange time traveling story, that allows you to pick up other officers upon clearing certain objectives but you get most of the roster from DW and SW."
dynastywarriors,2t3de1,SinlordAzmodan,1 point,Tue Jan 20 21:41:01 2015 UTC,"Dynasty Warriors 8 is based (loosely, but recognizably) on the historical events of the Three Kingdoms era of China and the preceding events. Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate is a crossover between the Dynasty Warriors, Samurai Warriors, and several other series that takes place in a fantasy dimension and tosses the characters together in a gigantic ""jamjar"" where they've all been taken from their homes. It's also a direct continuation, storywise, of the previous Warriors Orochi games, whereas each new Dynasty Warriors game tells the complete story.  The story of Dynasty Warriors 8 (+ XL) is focused primarily on each individual faction and their characters. You'll see character development arcs. There are five main stories in DW8XL (Wei, Wu, Shu, Jin, and Lu Bu), each of which splits into a historical ending and a ""good"" ending. Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate has one main story and two slightly smaller ones.  WO3U has a huge character cast due to its crossover nature, though individual characters don't get much screen time. It also does not have any of the new characters from Dynasty Warriors 8/XL, however. Characters get a bit more screentime in DW8XL for the most part, and you also have Dynasty Warriors characters who aren't present in WO3U.  In terms of gameplay: in WO3U, you take three characters out on the field with you. While you typically fight as one at a time, simply switching back and forth as the situation arises tag-team style, you can also use attacks that involve two or all three of them participating at the same time. You can use any unlocked characters at any time. In DW8, in a story mode stage, you have a limited choice of characters unless you play free mode, but the stage will also include cinematic moments and events more complex and narrative-driven in nature than the ones in WO3U.  In addition, in DW8, you can also choose two weapons for any character to go out into battle, meaning that you can turn a character whose moveset you dislike into a more tolerable one, though they only have access to certain special moves when using their preferred weapon. In WO3U, you're locked into the character's default moveset no matter what.  In short, I find WO3U a lot more grindy because of its huge character roster, most of whom I struggle to keep track of or care about. In DW8, you typically only deal with one kingdom's worth of characters at a time, making it easier to keep track of the story and your favorites. My recommendation would be to play Dynasty Warriors 8 XL, Samurai Warriors 4 (which is one of the most impressive Warriors games made so far), and then if you enjoyed both, Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate."

On top of these, i have also played (not much) Samurai Warriors (not sure which version) and liked all of them.   My favorite is Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate, just due to the fact that i get to play some of the characters i like. I'm someone who doesn't like a lot of characters, and thus limited to a little amount of them.    Kyubi no Kitsune is from Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate. DaJi from Warriors Orochi 3, and Ultimate as well. Daqiao from Dynasty Warriors.  Wang Yuan Ji from Dynasty Warriors. Diao Chan from Dynasty Warriors as well.

dynastywarriors,2swo2t,BeriAlpha,1 point,Mon Jan 19 13:12:02 2015 UTC,"Sadly the warriors franchise isn't really known for it's online co-op, partly because it's just not done well. I haven't tried orochi 3 online because it's hard just to find a game with people on the warriors series, I don't think I have even bothered to try since DW7. Warriors games are deeply rooted in split screen co-op, and I know everyone can level up that way because I have done it before on Orochi 3. I imagine free mode probably works better than story mode for co-op, but I can't say if that will really change anything or not."

dynastywarriors,2s4adw,Valentari,3,Mon Jan 12 01:41:03 2015 UTC,"Empires is part strategy/resource management game, part standard musou game.  In DW4 and 5 Empires, you basically picked a faction, then controlled that faction as it conquered the land. You could recruit officers - any officer, really - and use them all, all while carrying out domestic orders to improve your items, skills, or troops. Each game crew more and more complex, and in DW6 Empires, you could actually choose to play as not only a ruler, but as any officer at all, which meant you could play as a vagrant officer, join a force, rule a force, get married, swear oaths of brotherhood, etc. It also introduced missions which weren't essential to conquering the land but gave you valuable experience, items, gold, etc. and boosted your friendship with officers. DW7 continued that, though it fell back somewhat on the depth of playing as an individual officer to replace it with deeper strategies that you can carry out on the battlefield, including ones that boost your abilities, set fire attacks, etc. You could still get married and such, though. DW8 seems to be moving along those same lines, adding a variety of mission types, and you can also have children (no raising them, just... an officer shows up that looks like a mix between the parents).  Also, the Empires series have long been known for their Edit Officer capabilities. In DW7 Empires, they started letting you replace existing officers with ones you created, too, which means you could have a unique Cheng Pu, Cao Hong, or Zhou Cang running around. You could also even replace the Musou characters if you want, which means that you could pull an Ikkitousen and turn everyone into schoolgirls if that's what you're into."

dynastywarriors,2s4adw,greatmuta2,1 point,Mon Jan 12 03:36:17 2015 UTC,"The actual battles are a mix of Dynasty Warriors and Capture modes from games like Star Wars Battlefront,Battlefield,etc. Only difference is you have to link them in a order to be able to take over the main enemy base,then the commanding officer appears and you beat him to win the battle.If you're defending the same applies or you can try to let the clock run out,if you're attacking you get 20 mins to win and defending is 15 mins to either beat them or defend your main base.  FYI:I've only played empires up to DW6 so there may be some differences now."

You can carry two weapons into a battle in 8, and each have a certain affinity, which makes officer battles kind of like rock, paper, scissors.  Which leads into bladestorms, when using an affinity that beats theirs, a blue symbol appears over their heads, you do more damage and as you do the symbol gets smaller until it's gone, changing the attack into a bit of a button mash frenzy where they can't attack or move.  EX weapon - Your officer's preferred weapon, as I said anyone can use nearly anything (a few weapons may be female/male exclusive) this weapon is their most ""iconic"" one, usually.  EX attacks, moves you can only do while using the previous mentioned EX weapon.  Different musou attacks, a rage attack.

By the time you're fighting the final battle, enemies will be tougher than the first battle.   Again, I have only played the Gathering of Heroes portion, but I can say it provides such a different experience than a typical Warriors game that it really has renewed my enthusiasm in the franchise (I haven't anticipated a new DW game this much in a LONG time). For me, being able to create heroes and then meet them on the battlefield is a unique and rewarding experience, and the game has immense replayability."
dynastywarriors,2ro8kt,NopeFenrir,1 point,Thu Jan 8 02:08:30 2015 UTC,"That's not what I meant with difficulty scaling. The difficulty does scale within a scenario. But I was wondering if it scales between scenarios that you play. You don't have experience with that however.  Also, what difficulty do you usually play at? I know there's very easy, easy, normal, hard and chaos. I was also wondering if enemies took ages to kill, or not. I would appreciate it if you could talk about that.  I still thank you for your input. I really wanna know how I might feel about an empires game."
dynastywarriors,2ro8kt,Mordilaa,1 point,Thu Jan 8 08:02:25 2015 UTC,"There's game difficulty, which is apparent from the get go, and scaling difficulty.  In the beginning of the ""Chaos"" scenario which is gathering of heroes, land in chaos or what have you, the difficulty at first is what you set it because each kingdom is small. As it goes on, and kingdoms acquire land and officers, and those officers acquire levels and soldiers, the battles become more difficult because the soldiers are stronger as well as the officers. So eventually, the difficulty you start with will scale upwards the stronger kingdoms you face.  For scenarios, the kingdoms involved are already somewhat powerful. All officers are level 1 so it THAT difficult depending on the original difficulty. But difficulty in scenarios does scale up with time.  As for scenarios being different in terms of difficulty, no. They are not.  All that's different is officers who are alive and kingdoms in existence.   Wars are difficult because of who fights them, not when they take place.  Make sense? :)  I hope I answered your question."
dynastywarriors,2ro8kt,Mordilaa,1 point,Thu Jan 8 11:53:35 2015 UTC,"""As for scenarios being different in terms of difficulty, no. They are not.""  This is what I wanted to hear. I guess I'll see once I play it.  As for the scenarios getting gradually harder with time as kingdoms expand, that's a given.  You didn't answer my question on how hard it is to kill officer type enemies though. As in, how many hits they can take. I'd hate it to take about 5 minutes to kill any officer. Of course, I wouldn't immediately go for chaos difficulty because it's the hardest mode there is. In empires.  I do think we're talking past each other here though :S"
dynastywarriors,2ro8kt,CroakDream,2,Thu Jan 8 12:08:01 2015 UTC,It really depends on how strong you are. At the very beginning it sucks regardless of difficulty. The enemies Don't hit hard but neither do you.  Unless chaos mode.  One hit kill for you. Shit sucks.
dynastywarriors,2ro8kt,CroakDream,2,Thu Jan 8 12:13:15 2015 UTC,"I can't say for the easier difficulties.I play hard but have tried normal and chaos a few times. I haven't noticed that enemies take more or less hits they just seem to do more or less damage to you.  will it take 5 minutes? no, probably not. Maybe like 3 on chaos but that's down to spending time blocking and timing your attacks."
dynastywarriors,2ro8kt,Mordilaa,1 point,Thu Jan 8 21:47:49 2015 UTC,"I see. That's what I was looking. Guess I'll have to get more patient with my fights in empires, if I can afford to. Gotta keep an eye on that time limit."

Yes and no. If you let them expand and don't focus on expanding and leveling up or buying better weapons then yes it'll be extremely hard later in the game. But usually it begins hard because you don't have good weapons or stats but once you get them, towards the end of the game it becomes extremely easy. I can't say that I've noticed soldiers getting stronger, I know they gain more health but still go down easy enough.  I don't know if they have it anymore but you used to have the option to carry over stats and weapons (back when you could apply stats to them) so that could always alter the difficulty."

DW1 was Sangokumusō and DW2 was Shin Sangokumusou instead of Shin Sangokumusou 2. So therefore DW3 was Shin Sangokumusou 2 and so forth...

I can't really see him doing that with a bench (though I sure can see him resting on it).  Interesting factoid: now, Liu Shan, Sima Yi, and Sun Ce are the only leaders of a major faction (as in, not Others) not to use a sword as their weapon."

dynastywarriors,2q62u7,snomanDS,3,Tue Dec 23 12:06:32 2014 UTC,"The goal is to get 100% subjugation rates in all of the territories/regions before facing the final battle. You gradually increase your subjugation rating by conquering bases in battle, which means you'll have to fight several battles in the same battlefield to get 100% (you don't have to get 100% of the bases on a battlefield to increase your rating, though it does help). The higher difficulty you clear a battle on, the higher the gain you get for clearing the battle.  Over time, as your rating increases, you will unlock new areas. Once you unite all of the areas, you will then face the final battle.  Keep in mind that if officers are defeated, they will leave your army and have to be fought again to be recruited. And since officers only show up in their specified regions, that means that if you lose someone, you'll have to go back to whatever battlefield they're from in order to re-recruit them, even if that region is already subjugated (at least, this is my experience)."

dynastywarriors,2q5gjp,Cynical_badger,2,Tue Dec 23 06:23:12 2014 UTC,"In regards to your first question, not entirely. It depends on what you want to unlock. If it's characters, weapons, or stages you can unlock all of that main stuff simply by Musou mode. Items like mounts such as Red Hare, which is unlocked by completing 100 consecutive Ambition mode battles, are limited to Ambition mode.   I understand what you mean about the openness of battles compared to old titles.  Generally battles are more linear now with specific objectives that are completed in sequence to win. However, challenges exist that may deviate from this main formula and can also produce some very different story outcomes or even make new stages available entirely. There are actually those options you mentioned where you'll have to choose between the main objective and saving a fellow officer or something like that. If you go to the Musou mode selection screen for a specific kingdom you'll see a horizontal tree detailing the campaign, with each stage having optional Star objectives. These challenges sometimes require you to take different routes from the linear ones I described earlier, and if you complete all of them leading up a certain point in Musou mode, you'll unlock a new historical ""what-if"" branch of stages."
dynastywarriors,2q5gjp,Interminable_Turbine,2,Tue Dec 23 15:42:20 2014 UTC,"I don't think I've experienced the option of having to save a commander, or completing the main objective yet, maybe I have and just didn't notice. The battles in Dynasty Warriors are pretty chaotic, and the only information you receive during a battle in this games seem to be from some text from a random guy on the bottom of the screen, and a blinking square on the map. I don't usually feel the need to read it or listen to it unless it's stopping me from moving forward. I don't know, I'm enjoying the game, but I feel like it's missing the immersion and personal touch that previous titles had. Thanks for the response."
dynastywarriors,2q5gjp,the-real-raybeam,1 point,Wed Dec 24 04:45:26 2014 UTC,"You can still see battle conditions, it's usually ""Commander must live, enemy commander must die"" if you're your commander it's just some officer. I think 7 (or 6?) was worse with being able to go straight to the enemy commander and kill him, now you usually have to complete objectives until you can kill them, but sometimes it's different. No cut scenes for every officer though, I don't think many battles have cut scenes mid-battle."
dynastywarriors,2prupb,TrivialCipher,3,Fri Dec 19 09:00:12 2014 UTC,...was that a table?
dynastywarriors,2prupb,sircastic09,3,Fri Dec 19 20:34:07 2014 UTC,"No, it was a bench.  To answer your next question, yes, it was a bench."
dynastywarriors,2prupb,GGProfessor,2,Fri Dec 19 22:10:04 2014 UTC,Didn't see this on the subreddit yet despite it being almost a month old. Just in case nobody's seen the new weapons with their characters.
dynastywarriors,2prupb,GGProfessor,2,Fri Dec 19 09:01:20 2014 UTC,"So hyped for Empires. Lianshi's new weapon is awesome and a much needed improvement, Meng Huo's is cool and fitting, Sun Quan's is badass, Liu Shan's is way too badass for his character, and glad to see Xiao Qiao back to her old fans. I like Yueying with the scythe, but this new weapon is probably more fitting for an inventor character like her, and it's still pretty cool. I can't really even tell what's different about Wang Yi's, but I'm gonna miss her oversized sai.  Edit: I'm not entirely sure how I feel about Deng Ai's new weapon. It feels like he's stuck in a one-upping contest with Xiahou Ba over who can have the stupidest most oversized futuristic laser lance. And Guan Suo's new weapon is cool, but it seems kinda weird to not have someone with nunchucks in here.  Any idea if the old weapons will still be in the game somehow?"
dynastywarriors,2prupb,GGProfessor,1 point,Fri Dec 19 11:32:13 2014 UTC,"I agree with you on all of these but one. To me, Lianshi's new weapon doesn't fit her at all. It's probably a gameplay improvement as her crossbow seems to be pretty bad when I try to use it. But I don't really see her as a nimble brawler type. It seems way out of character.  Don't forget Guan Suo's new weapon too. I'd say it's really fitting considering his old Musou attacks. Definitely brings something new to the roster.  And yeah. Liu Shan's gone from always bothering me to being one of them I'm most excited to play :P  EDIT: All of their old weapons from 8 will still be available."
dynastywarriors,2prupb,stunderthepants,2,Fri Dec 19 11:38:14 2014 UTC,"I can see where you're coming from with Lianshi, but I think you (and I, to some extent) mostly feel that way just because she's been stuck with the crossbow since she was introduced. I don't think it'll take long to get used to the ""new"" Lianshi, and once we do we may even look back at the crossbow and think, ""That was a weird weapon for her."""
dynastywarriors,2prupb,MrSuitMan,1 point,Fri Dec 19 11:44:02 2014 UTC,That's a good point. She also stands out more because I played tons of 6: Empires. In which YueYing and Meng Huo used the weapons in this trailer. So Lianshi's change is very new for me.  I'm totally fine with her getting a new weapon and everything. I'm just afraid the crossbow might not get taken up by a new character as I really like the concept for the weapon. Same goes for Deng Ai's lance. Those weapons are so cool and creative. It'd be a shame to see them be left behind. Although I doubt it'll happen.
dynastywarriors,2prupb,stunderthepants,2,Fri Dec 19 11:49:24 2014 UTC,"Dude. When I saw Liu Shan holding the bench I had no idea where it was going, but holy hell is that an awesome design. It looks fun as hell and fits the character so perfectly that I already like Liu Shan a hell of a lot more now, and I wasn't even in the camp who hated him before.  And they also did the one thing that I thought was impossible and gave Deng Ai a weapon that was even more phallic than his previous one. I'm pretty sure the next step in his evolution will be just to whip his dong out and beat thousands of soldiers to death with it."
dynastywarriors,2prupb,MrSuitMan,2,Fri Dec 19 22:04:47 2014 UTC,"Does it fit him though? I never penned him to be a jokey character. He always seemed like a quiet and meek character to me.  The bench very obvious brings to mind a Jackie Chan sort of vibe. I would never have put Liu Shan as someone could pull off such a fun, jokey weapon and moveset. The weapon animations suggests a confidence that I do not associate with him."
dynastywarriors,2prupb,stunderthepants,2,Sat Dec 20 04:38:34 2014 UTC,"I don't think he's meek so much as he's completely aloof and apathetic. He doesn't avoid battle because he's afraid of it, he avoids it because there are a million other things that he would rather be doing, like taking a nap for instance. I don't even think that he really lacks confidence. His character is just meant to be placed opposite to Liu Bei, who often meets trouble because he cares too much.   That's why I think the bench is a good fit. Liu Shan's EX and Musou attacks indicate that he isn't really taking the battle in the slightest bit seriously. He's just doing it out of an obligation to his father and Zhuge Liang. Taking a bench into battle means he can sit down whenever he wants if he finds the battle tiresome. Pang Tong could also be described as aloof, and one of his Musous is to take a nap in the middle of a fight. I think that Liu Shan's bench makes sense for similar reasons."
dynastywarriors,2prupb,umiman,2,Sat Dec 20 06:20:42 2014 UTC,"I can see where you're coming from. His cowardly, meek visage is meant to be a facade. But I don't think it's in the way you're thinking.  I agree that he tends to avoid battle and that his cowardly personality is a facade. But from what I remember in game (and from a quick glance at the wiki), it seems to be less apathy of ""I'd rather be doing something else"" and more ""I want to purposefully deceive them.""  Here's a character writeup that goes into it a lot more. http://the-archlich.tumblr.com/post/76477116337  The act of taking a nap or taking a seat mid battle is more emblematic of the kind of personality that's more like ""This is tiresome"" or ""This is a bore."" But also because the character can afford to take a nap or seat mid battle, it exudes the idea of ""This is a pain."" As in ""I could deal with this, but I'd rather not."" And that's the kind of ""confidence"" I am referring to. I just never get that kind of vibe from Lian Shu.  A lot can be told from a character's personality from just the attack animations. But I don't think it fits Lian Shu. Rather, I'd think it'd be best suited from some one like Sima Zhao. He's someone who's lax, casual nature fits the bench moveset more.  Alternately, it'd fit someone who was more playful, goofy and cocky. If you ever played Tekken, there's a Jackie Chan clone named Lei Wulong. And he has a custom move where he also fights with a bench and it fits perfectly for him.  I really do like the bench weapon. I don't think it fits Liu Shan. Maybe we'll get a new a character that'll be a better fit."
dynastywarriors,2prupb,Basuru,2,Sat Dec 20 09:40:02 2014 UTC,"That writeup is a good read, so thanks for posting it.  First, I think you're probably right when you say that the bench might be a better fit for Koei's rendition of Sima Zhao (certainly not the real one). But Sima Zhao is a leader who acts as an equivalent of Cao Cao, Sun Quan, and Liu Bei, so I don't think they would give him such a strange moveset. Liu Shan is a fairly minor character in the later Shu story, so it's not as big of a deal.  It's honestly kind of difficult figuring out the meaning behind Liu Shan's words sometimes. At the end of the Jin story mode, when he's sitting at the feast with Sima Zhao, he looks to be very happy that it's over, and he says that it's because ""There's no one around to tell me what to do anymore."" That line reminds me of a stereotypical lazy teenager, and I guess that's why I equate his motives to one, even if it most likely goes much deeper.  I guess we just differ on that ""vibe"" that we get from Liu Shan, then. The ""could deal with this but would rather not"" attitude is something that kind of makes sense to me. Since this is a game where playable officers can destroy enemy armies single-handedly, the vast majority of those officers are of very high confidence in their abilities just due to the nature of the game (Daqiao is the one exception that I can think of). I think Liu Shan probably shares in this innate confidence, and the combination of that innate confidence and the perceived apathy makes the bench a good fit, in my opinion.  And I do love me some Tekken, and it's true that if Lei Wulong were to be placed in a Dynasty Warriors game, the bench would be a perfect fit. But when it comes to Jackie Chan and stuff like benches, while fighting with a bench adds some goofiness to a scene , I think that that feeling is supposed to be secondary to displaying that Jackie Chan/Lei are such great fighters because they are extremely resourceful. I'm not really an expert on Chan's movies, but I think he only ever fights with something like a bench because it just happens to be whats at hand, not because he's terribly cocky.  Either way, thanks for the discussion. This sub could use more stuff like this."

dynastywarriors,2op577,icebear518,2,Mon Dec 8 23:38:58 2014 UTC,"I posted this same thing about a month ago (please note I played DW8 on PS3 so can't really say how it plays on PS3 so left it off the list):  I've played both and now, after far too many hours not doing uni work, finished them both in terms of main story:  WO3U is, by far, the longest game I've played outside of Disgaea 4, in terms of sheer completion. There are so many characters, and so many levels. I now have all character's final weapons (the one's you get through stages, not the ones you construct... so technically each character has two 5 star weapons) and in terms of content it is incredibly detailed. There are a tonne of fun characters to use and the additions from games outside of the DW/SW story and also other games makes for some novel playing. I also actually really love the story and the 4 added chapters on top of the ones from the original WO3 are all great.  SW4: In terms of story-telling is probably one of Koei's best efforts. Every clan now has a distinct story-arc (some of which are really cool). The best part about this game for me, though, has to be that now there is not a single character I am not happy playing as. However, the style of battles has certainly changed with the way missions appear more important, and you feel a heck of a lot more powerful (or just peasents feel a lot less significant) with the addition of ""Hyper"" type attacks. I've still not really delved into Chronicle mode, but I have started it and it looks like it could be really fun. Also, the unique movesets for created characters so far seem to be really cool.   I have one thing that does iritate me about SW4, though. In sections where in games like DW7/DW8 they have actual cut-scenes during conversations, instead they just have character models speaking to one another and then captioned descriptions of what it is they are ""doing"" in that scene, for example:   Muneshige reaches out and grabs Gynchio's hand and starts walking with her   It just says this in a caption instead of just showing them walking with each other... this feels more like laziness on the part of Koei and definitely does take away from some of the more fun parts of the story-telling, especially given that they've delivered better in games like Kessen 2 and 3 which were on PS2.   There are graphical differences between the 2, given that WO3U was made for PS3, really, and then just given a small boost for PS4 and also had the number of enemy troops on screen seriously bumped up. SW4 looks... different. Not necessarily better, just different, though I do like all the models for the characters.   All in all, I would say the 2 are very different games and I would say it depends on what you are looking for out of the game to which one you'd buy (I'd say buy both because both are great and different, but you seem to be looking for only one):  If you want game length, a more fun weapon-system and more characters with a new, unique story WO3U is your go-to  If you want epic story, with the most fun and well-delivered history lesson (obviously with a little poetic licence) with a fun ""create-a-character"" mode w/story and without any characters you will be annoyed to play as (believe me, there are some characters in WO3 that are just plain crap, because they used the DW7 movesets and not the DW8 movesets where they made the rubbish people better. The fact that you have so many to choose from just hides them away, though and just means you end up not really playing as them at all) then SW4 is your way to go"
dynastywarriors,2op577,dude2dudette,1 point,Tue Dec 9 08:26:24 2014 UTC,"I personally prefer Samurai warriors since I just like the aesthetic more. Also you can create your own character and play through a mode where you go around and meet other officers it is pretty cool. I think Orochi has the most content just because it has all the characters from both series, and then also bonus characters.   I think all the games have online coop for story mode, but I am not 100% sure."

dynastywarriors,2om2qf,Orowam,3,Mon Dec 8 03:47:30 2014 UTC,"That's not a bad idea for the Warriors games but, as others have noted, it is likely more a processing power limit issue (especially given the number of troops on screen in SW4)   If you like the idea of having enemy officers actually doing things (and potentially wrecking your shit) then you should look to play Kessen 2 and Kessen 3. 2 great games, I will always prefer Kessen 2, simply because of the duelling system, and how your decisions before each battle really can affect how you play tactically within each battle.  but both are great games. Kessen 2 follows a fictisious story between Liu Bei and Cao Cao, Kessen 3 follows Nobunaga's rise to power."
dynastywarriors,2om2qf,dude2dudette,1 point,Mon Dec 8 09:54:23 2014 UTC,I think the reason they don't fight directly is more a technical one. You will notice the crazy pop in some of the games have when you are trying to render too many soldiers on the screen especially in co-op. I think to process the AI and formations for that many individual units is too much for the system so they just stand there when off screen and do maths.  This should ease now next gen are slowly building up power however its all depending on the priority. I do like your suggestion though and always imagined in my head 2 armies standing around their officers dueling watching in awe.
dynastywarriors,2om2qf,Enzedderr,1 point,Mon Dec 8 04:34:01 2014 UTC,"I wonder if there are any RTSes that solve that issue? Then again, Dynasty Warriors is first and foremost, an action game from the perspective of one soldier."

dynastywarriors,2ojmyy,pawned90210,5,Sun Dec 7 12:11:29 2014 UTC,"The spin-offs!  The Samurai Warriors series is the most similar to Dynasty Warriors itself, but still with a few unique mechanics and stuff besides just a different setting. And the Warriors Orochi series is just a combination the samurai and dynasty series characters into crazy mish-mash plots.  Then we have Dynasty Warriors: Gundam, Fist of the North Star: Ken's Rage, One Piece: Pirate Warriors, and Hyrule Warriors. And if you like the universe they are set in and the Dynasty Warriors series in general then they are all great games, although the first One Piece and Gundam ones fall a little short their sequels are a lot better.  And then finally there's Warriors: Legends of Troy, Dynasty Warriors Online, and Bladestorm: The Hundred Years War. The first two were pretty weak games IMO but Bladestorm I liked. It probably changes the most in terms of gameplay compared to the original warriors series, you actually control squads of units instead of just a hero and can switch between different units throughout battles."

dynastywarriors,2nzz7r,TheElusiveHobo,3,Tue Dec 2 01:20:31 2014 UTC,"First off, if you want the Japanese Voices, make sure you specifically grab the Japanese Voice Option DLC (it's free).  The DLC that actually affects gameplay in any manner are the Powerful Weapon Pack (adds improved 5-star weapons for non-XL characters - should make Ultimate difficulty slightly more bearable), the two ""Weapon System"" packs (""Weapon System"" and ""Weapon System & Upgrade"" - each adds a few more weapon types, including one of my preferred weapons, the Sabatons.), the two New Stage packs (New stage & Animal pack, brings 8 older battlefields forwards for a total of 24 stages for Free Mode, and the New Stage & Camp Symbol pack, which adds 30 stages for Free Mode on the existing battlefields), and The Unique Weapon pack (adds some ""Joke weapons"", if that's your cup of tea). Note that the Powerful and Unique weapon packs also adds some stages to FREE MODE for you to earn those weapons in.  Everything else can be safely skipped over if you don't care about their contents.  (Also, kinda surprised the DLC isn't discounted this time. It was half-off when I bought it.)"
dynastywarriors,2nzz7r,kitsunezeta,2,Tue Dec 2 01:51:09 2014 UTC,"Copied off part of my Steam review:  Most of the them are cosmetic, with a few exceptions:   Japanese Voice Option (free): this one is required since the English dub aren’t excellent. New Stage & Camp Symbol Pack: This is the compilation of all 30 DLC stages released for Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends expansion on consoles in one DLC. If you’ve cleared all stages in DW8 Xtreme Legends Complete Edition, considering buying this if you want more. Some of these scenarios are very challenging, especially Battle Royale. New Stage & Animal Pack: This is the compilation of 8 DLC packs for vanilla Dynasty Warriors 8 on consoles. Each pack is a remake of one classic Dynasty Warriors battlefield into 3 variant scenarios, one of witch will give a special animal in game upon completing a certain objective. So all in all 24 stages, Shu side Qi Shan is the most difficult of all. Weapon System & Upgrade Pack and Weapon System Pack: unlike “Unique/Powerful Weapon Packs” these are not weapon reskinned with slightly different attack value. These two DLCs gives you 9 new weapon system with completely different move sets. 9 actual new weapons. Keeps in mind, however, these 9 weapons will be incorporated in-game in the standalone Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires that is to be released on January 2015."

dynastywarriors,2nwo51,ABentoBox,1 point,Mon Dec 1 03:56:51 2014 UTC,That's a good point. I love DW but I haven't played Samurai Warriors in YEARS so I definitely don't remember anything about it. Thanks for the response!
dynastywarriors,2nwo51,ScubaSteeeve,5,Mon Dec 1 04:24:28 2014 UTC,"Samurai Warriors 4. Warriors Orochi 3 is alright, but with such a huge cast, your favorite characters will play very little role unless they happen to be Sima Zhao, Ma Chao, or Hanbei.  Samurai Warriors 4 has a much deeper combat system. Warriors Orochi 3 is basically Dynasty Warriors with character switching instead of weapon switching, but in Samurai Warriors 4, you character switch as well... except this time, instead of your secondary character popping up out of nowhere, you actually change over to where that character is. The battles also feel larger and more consequential than in Warriors Orochi 3.  Not to mention that you get to know the characters a lot better, both through Story Mode and Chronicle Mode. You can also create a character, which is really neat. Warriors Orochi 3 might have more to do overall, but it feels a lot like a grind."
dynastywarriors,2nwo51,novembr,2,Mon Dec 1 19:08:45 2014 UTC,"As far as sheer amount of content, Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate wins, hands down. An enormous selection of missions and unique characters, Free mode, Musou Battlefields mode, Duel mode, and (my favorite) Gauntlet mode (which can be played for ages). But maybe more importantly, the battlefields in WO3U are much more active. Battles feel like battles with troops and officers taking swings (both at you and each other) instead of standing or shuffling around like brainless goons only taking a swing every so often.   Samurai Warriors 4 is a more traditional DW experience, so if that is what you want, go for that. Be aware though that an updated version of SW4 will be released next year and I don't think it will be an expansion that you can buy separately--more likely a full price rerelease with extra content like WO3U.  Edit: spelling"
dynastywarriors,2nwo51,eleuthria,2,Mon Dec 1 20:30:47 2014 UTC,"Since you have DW8, I'd recommend SW4.  WO3 is awesome and eventually you should get both, but it's not that different from DW8 outside of being able to swap between 3 characters.  SW4 is much faster than DW8/WO3 thanks to the rush attacks.  It's extremely fun."

And also if they aren't dubbing it over why is there a >2 month delay for the USA release? Does it really take that long to just add some subtitles and a different box?  UGH Seriously...
dynastywarriors,2mwkwp,WillLie4karma,3,Thu Nov 20 23:56:08 2014 UTC,I can definitely understand the delay for translation and stuff like that. I don't mind at all waiting a few months for that. I just really wanted the English voices this time around.

If not, if you're buying it for the...cutscenes and voice acting, the original Japanese is much better. I'm not that great in Japanese, but I'm fluent in English and I know good acting when I see (or hear) it and the English DW/SW actors are the epitome of ""you get what you pay for""...  Dude, it's not like Ralph Finnes, Patrick Stewart, Judi Dench and Peter Cullen are doing the voices.  It's like being here in Quebec. There's some awesome movie with great actors and everyone sees it dubbed in French. What's the point? You've missed all of the emotive expression and inflection of the actor's original performance.   At least with subtitles you can hear and feel what is being said and still get the message."
dynastywarriors,2mwkwp,7tenths,5,Fri Nov 21 02:21:57 2014 UTC,"To be honest, I've watched anime with subs most of my life. I can't tell what emotion is what in Japanese based on voice alone.

dynastywarriors,2mwkwp,Smattchew,6,Sun Nov 23 21:37:53 2014 UTC,"While it is a shame I am not too fussed personally. I usually swap to JP with subs just out of preference however I can feel your pain for the lovers of EN dubs. I am guessing that the amount of content they have to re-voice is going to cost way more than the projected sales which is a little disheartening.  I will say that as long as we are getting Western releases for these games I am happy though. I mean, they could choose not to translate at all and then you would be forced to import a JP version. People who don't want the game anymore because it doesn't have EN voices are being a little too picky in my opinion. I understand where you are coming from with all the reading sometimes, even I can get swamped, however its sad that an entire buying decision is based on voice work when subs are provided. Sure its a let down but it shouldn't prevent you completely from getting a game that you like to play.  If anything I would actually be interested in a Chinese dubbing with EN subs. I feel it would make the game feel that little bit greater.  Hopefully Dynasty Warriors 9 will keep EN dub in their release schedule at least."
dynastywarriors,2mwkwp,TweetPoster,0,Fri Nov 21 00:49:22 2014 UTC,It'll be kept I think. They wouldn't release a main DW game without.  And I think they tried it with Chinese dubs once...it was awful IIRC.

dynastywarriors,2mwkwp,smacksaw,0,Thu Nov 20 20:22:16 2014 UTC,Depends how much content they have. What you have to realise though is that Empires contains a lot of new content as well that has to be tailored to all possible outcomes of the campaigns. Combine this with the fact that Empires sales are consistently lower than the Original and XL versions in the past and they probably don't have the budget to manage that work.
dynastywarriors,2mwkwp,Dragoneer1,0,Fri Nov 21 01:02:17 2014 UTC,"The only reason I'm bummed there's no English option is for my very young kids who aren't good readers and listen to the voices to find out what to do.  But if you're an adult...I mean the rest of the world reads subtitles. You can't see a show or music video in Asia without them. Movies and shows in Europe are not only subtitled, but multilingual where they switch between Swedish and English effortlessly, for an example (watch PBS).  I don't care if you downvote me, but god damned we are spoiled if we think we're the only country who shouldn't ever deal with subtitles. American exceptionalism at it's finest. Join the rest of the world and get used to them. I neither like or dislike them - it's just part of the game/movie/show.  EDIT: to add, there's so many awesome Japanese games we never get because there are people vocal about NEVER ACCEPTING subtitles, so we don't get the games. Or worse, they release a subtitled game rather than nothing, it has to go on the PS store because you won't even buy it as a physical release...and you still don't buy it."

I'm really happy this game is getting an English translation no doubt about it. I am still going to buy the game. But this is a feature that people wanted.  I don't see what's wrong about wanting an English dub, then becoming upset when you find out it's not actually happening. The notion that people can't complain about stuff that they are going to buy which have features they don't like and that we should just accept the game as is is ridiculous. By that same logic if you want to play those games that don't get translated just go learn japanese and accept it and stop complaining  People are allowed to want things in games that they plan on buying, and we're allowed to complain or be upset when those things aren't implemented.  Dynasty warriors is one of my favourite games, I have every empires game and almost every base/xl games. The English dub is in almost every one of these games, and was recently confirmed to be in 8 empires so yeah I am a little upset. This is a big part of the game for me, and a lot of other people.   I am still going to buy the game because it's going to be amazing,  but a lot of people won't without the English dub. I already know 2 or 3 people dropping out on buying it because of it.

dynastywarriors,2mi6w0,buffalo_x,2,Thu Nov 20 19:31:24 2014 UTC,English voice acting tends to be horrible. I wouldnt mind it if they didnt make it so cheesy.

dynastywarriors,2lygfl,Labirys,2,Wed Nov 12 03:36:30 2014 UTC,"The quick and dirty way to do it is, of course, to just get them in Chronicle Mode, which is just...SO much simpler than the character-specific method."
dynastywarriors,2lygfl,Karasu-sama,1 point,Wed Nov 12 06:46:14 2014 UTC,How do you do that?
dynastywarriors,2lygfl,Karasu-sama,3,Wed Nov 12 07:37:20 2014 UTC,"I made a post about this in another thread, so I'll just copypaste it here:  *Chronicle mode is BY FAR the easier way to get the ultimate weapons in terms of requirements, you can do it on easy and normal difficulties, and you get two of them at a time.  Now, unfortunately, I wasn't keeping track of when these weapon missions started to appear. I can tell you I had opened up the whole map, my Warrior's level was mid-to-late 40s, he had finished the warrior and swordsman life paths and was working through scholar or strategist, and my biography and events were around 75%. I'm not sure which of these metrics trigger the missions, though it's probably the map.  In any case, wherever you end up, zoom out and look across the map and you should see a battle marker with the crossed swords, except the swords are golden instead of red. Those are the weapon events. When you get there you have to ""challenge"" the officers on the field. These challenge missions are only slightly harder than regular chronicles missions. If you're high level and even slightly competent at partner management, you'll do fine. You might have to kill 3 officers across the field in 2 minutes, or kill them in order, or they're powered up or something. Whatever, on easy difficulty, it's cake.  Do those side missions and finish the stage and BOOM, ultimate weapon both for your character and your partner. And when you're done, another one appears on your map. So swap weapons and partners, work your way to the next one and keep at em."

(3,000 characters max.)   Super Robot Taisen action game. Why has this not happened already? You should have 8 of those by now. Please bring back Aerobiz. It wouldn't cost much to develop and you could sell it digitally. Also, in the SW/DW series, please add a pure strategy mode like Nobunaga's Ambition/Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Empires is chuuto hanpa. Go full strategy.   For any other comments, please fill in below. (3,000 characters max.)   I never buy the DLC. I don't think it's a good value. It would be nice to have free/included content over the life of the game. I pay $60 a year for a ""roster update"" game. At this point you could at least give us free DLC and retain interest in the games. In lieu of that, couldn't you have an ""Complete Edition"" come out after a year with all content included?"

dynastywarriors,2lcew8,ganondoom,9,Wed Nov 5 16:44:46 2014 UTC,"This goes even deeper than any of us realize. Yu Jin=Eugene.  Eugene, Oregon. The home of the University of Oregon. What's the mascot of said university? A duck. Ducking is one of the five principles of dodgeball. Dodge is a car company that makes a certain truck, the Ram. The ram is often associated with Ares, the Greek god of war. In the video game God of War you have to kill all of the gods. Sound familiar? That's right, Kill Bill Volume 2, starring Uma Thurman. Uma Thurman played Medusa in a Percy Jackson movie, a movie about Greek mythology (2Spooky). You know what other god was in that movie? That's right. Poseidon. And what weapon is Poseidon known for wielding? A goddamned trident. Half Life 3 confirmed.  Honestly though, nice post. I'm not sure how much thought Koei puts into these things, but the fact that you were able to draw those connections is impressive. You are a True Warrior of the Three Kingdoms."
dynastywarriors,2lcew8,stunderthepants,2,Thu Nov 6 05:34:26 2014 UTC,"If you want to wade into even more conspiracy theories all his charges except first depict where he as been.  Began with Wei (C2), captured by Shu (C3), prisoner of Wu (C4-5), coming back to Wei (C6).  I don't really see the parallel between him and slash however, one character doesn't warrant a theory at all, to me it just feels like a game mechanic to make his moveset different and reward you for the trouble of collecting orbs."
dynastywarriors,2lcew8,Ledazius,2,Wed Nov 5 14:43:32 2014 UTC,"I think Koei knows more about history than any of us, although some part of the story mode make people facepalm.  They've made the Romance of Three Kingdoms(game series) games for almost three decades, and it reflects in at least one thing in Dynasty Warriors. The name of the generic officers. Those names aren't made up, they are all from either Romance of the Three Kingdoms or Records of the Three Kingdoms. Koei knows exactly which batte to put each generic officers in. Rather, it's the unique officers (for lack of better term) who doesn't obey the space–time continuum. You can't have a playable character appearing in only one or two stages, and you can't have stages with only one or two unique officers. I remember in DW5, more half of the playable officers have their story end at Wuzhang Plain/Baidi Castle/New Hefei Castle."

Not only that, but they like to get stuck on some of the spawn points and not continue moving towards your characters like they should.

Something you should be careful about with Hasedo is that Kagekatsu will run a lot faster depending on what order things occur. I'm not positive as to what factors contribute to this, but I have seen him literally sprint to the retreat point before on the minimap. You may want to change up the order you do bonus objectives to compensate. Don't be afraid to wait a little longer so the right dialogue boxes appear, too."

dynastywarriors,2kslrn,Hulkkis,6,Thu Oct 30 20:11:33 2014 UTC,"Empires is its own game mode, its more of a strategy game that occasionally breaks into dynasty warriors battles.  It also include a custom character creation system, and they'll replace any character if the name matches them (IE: if I make a character named Ma Teng, he'll replace the Ma Teng ingame) so people use it to make custom variants of generic characters."
dynastywarriors,2kslrn,JamesUpskirtMecha,3,Thu Oct 30 20:21:36 2014 UTC,That's great to hear.  This must mean that the DW8XL numbers on PC were large enough that the market is kinda hard for them to ignore.  Hopefully this bodes well for other Musou games getting ported to PC.

dynastywarriors,2kslrn,Scandalbaby,1 point,Fri Oct 31 16:30:47 2014 UTC,it maybe a game with different features but i would like it if it was dw8 and you unlock empires mode and extreme legends mode from doing certain amount of things and not have to pay $40 more dollars for an upgraded version.  basically we are just beta testers for koei with very little incentive for me and i understand you guys like to support koei all the way but something has to change.

Empires is, essentially, a strategy game where you manage resources, hire officers, and then conquer cities by fighting a bunch of battles, but the characters' personalities have been stripped to their core. If you want an actual story to play through, 8XLCE is the better choice, but if you want a longer game and lots of zany options and customizability, then Empires is the way to go."

Munenori is actually playable in a lot of stories because his storyline is highly fictionalized. He's portrayed as an old friend of Choshosho and a retainer of Matsunaga Hisahide who wanders a bit and appears alongside them in stages where they're playable. As such, he's playable in the Oda path during the time when Hisahide is serving under Nobunaga, and he appears again in Motochika's storyline, joining him at the same time that Choshosho does, albeit briefly.  Also, at the end of the Oda storyline, you actually play as the Saika mercenaries/Mitsuhude/people opposed to Nobunaga at Honnoji, and Munenori is among them.  I just started the Tokugawa story, and he hasn't appeared yet. Then again, I haven't progressed very far into it yet, so I'm certain that he will.

dynastywarriors,2kjuk6,IveGotAHadron,3,Tue Nov 11 19:50:39 2014 UTC,"Chronicle mode is BY FAR the easier way to get the ultimate weapons in terms of requirements, you can do it on easy and normal difficulties, and you get two of them at a time.   Now, unfortunately, I wasn't keeping track of when these weapon missions started to appear. I can tell you I had opened up the whole map, my Warrior's level was mid-to-late 40s, he had finished the warrior and swordsman life paths and was working through scholar or strategist, and my biography and events were around 75%. I'm not sure which of these metrics trigger the missions, though it's probably the map.  In any case, wherever you end up, zoom out and look at the other end of the map and you should see a battle  marker with the crossed swords, except the swords are golden instead of red. Those are the weapon events. When you get there you have to ""challenge"" the officers on the field. These challenge missions are only slightly harder than regular chronicles missions. If you're high level and even slightly competent at partner management, you'll do fine. You might have to kill 3 officers across the field in 2 minutes, or kill them in order, or they're powered up or something. Whatever, on easy difficulty, it's cake.  Do those side missions and finish the stage and BOOM, ultimate weapon both for your character and your partner. And when you're done, another one appears on your map. So swap weapons and partners, work your way to the next one and keep at em."

dynastywarriors,2kedf3,polar7646,9,Sun Oct 26 20:36:47 2014 UTC,"I've played both and now, after far too many hours not doing uni work, finished them both in terms of main story:  WO3U is, by far, the longest game I've played outside of Disgaea 4, in terms of sheer completion. There are so many characters, and so many levels. I now have all character's final weapons (the one's you get through stages, not the ones you construct... so technically each character has two 5 star weapons) and in terms of content it is incredibly detailed. There are a tonne of fun characters to use and the additions from games outside of the DW/SW story and also other games makes for some novel playing. I also actually really love the story and the 4 added chapters on top of the ones from the original WO3 are all great.  SW4: In terms of story-telling is probably one of Koei's best efforts. Every clan now has a distinct story-arc (some of which are really cool). The best part about this game for me, though, has to be that now there is not a single character I am not happy playing as. However, the style of battles has certainly changed with the way missions appear more important, and you feel a heck of a lot more powerful (or just peasents feel a lot less significant) with the addition of ""Hyper"" type attacks. I've still not really delved into Chronicle mode, but I have started it and it looks like it could be really fun. Also, the unique movesets for created characters so far seem to be really cool.   I have one thing that does iritate me about SW4, though. In sections where in games like DW7/DW8 they have actual cut-scenes during conversations, instead they just have character models speaking to one another and then captioned descriptions of what it is they are ""doing"" in that scene, for example:   Muneshige reaches out and grabs Gynchio's hand and starts walking with her   It just says this in a caption instead of just showing them walking with each other... this feels more like laziness on the part of Koei and definitely does take away from some of the more fun parts of the story-telling, especially given that they've delivered better in games like Kessen 2 and 3 which were on PS2.   There are graphical differences between the 2, given that WO3U was made for PS3, really, and then just given a small boost for PS4 and also had the number of enemy troops on screen seriously bumped up. SW4 looks... different. Not necessarily better, just different, though I do like all the models for the characters.   All in all, I would say the 2 are very different games and I would say it depends on what you are looking for out of the game to which one you'd buy (I'd say buy both because both are great and different, but you seem to be looking for only one):  If you want game length, a more fun weapon-system and more characters with a new, unique story WO3U is your go-to  If you want epic story, with the most fun and well-delivered history lesson (obviously with a little poetic licence) with a fun ""create-a-character"" mode w/story and without any characters you will be annoyed to play as (believe me, there are some characters in WO3 that are just plain crap, because they used the DW7 movesets and not the DW8 movesets where they made the rubbish people better. The fact that you have so many to choose from just hides them away, though and just means you end up not really playing as them at all) then SW4 is your way to go"
dynastywarriors,2kedf3,dude2dudette,6,Sun Oct 26 22:25:51 2014 UTC,Thanks A LOT for such detailed suggestion. Now I think SW4 is the best one for me at the moment. Annnnnnd I will grab WO3U later when I have more free time to enjoy it as well!
dynastywarriors,2kedf3,dude2dudette,2,Sun Oct 26 22:45:00 2014 UTC,"No problem. I played WO3U over the summer when I had a lot more free time to play it with a friend. We've played pretty much every DW together since DW4. I even ended up getting Devil Kings with him. My method of playing SW4 was to pre-order it for him for his birthday (the Anime edition, of course) and just play it 2-player with him... I live with him, so that helps :P"

dynastywarriors,2kedf3,MuNought,3,Mon Oct 27 15:45:05 2014 UTC,"I've only played the original WO3, so take this with a grain of salt, but I'd personally go with SW4. A lot of the appeal of WO3 is the fusion of elements from SW and DW, so if you go in with only half of background, you get a lot less out of it. Also, WO3 is based on SW3 and DW7, so it's a little bit outdated in character roster and design.  That being said, I really enjoyed how WO3 played, and the weapon system was very easy to take advantage of. The story was refreshing, because it's a break from the usual DW/SW antics, and the addition of outside characters brightens the place up."
dynastywarriors,2kedf3,smacksaw,2,Sun Oct 26 21:04:14 2014 UTC,"That's kind of an interesting point if he's never played WO, however playing WO is also a good way to get you interested in both franchises."

Haven't played a samurai warriors game in a long time but I am loving every a second of it, the combat feels different to me but in a good way, the missions actually feel like missions now cause a drum sounds and your objective comes up which I found cool. I even like the little thing right before a mission it shows all the characters important to that mission come up.   Should also note WO you pick three characters that you can switch between on the fly but they take up one person, in the sense that you switch the other character is gone. SW you pick two people and can switch between them when ever but the other person becomes an npc and keeps fighting, you can also command then where to go and who to fight, loving that for some reason."

I found WO to be refreshing and some of the interactions/rivalries/alliances genuinely bring a smile to my face because they're so imaginative.   I'll put it to you like this: I already own WO3 for Wii U and I'm going to get it for PS4 and I have yet to buy SW4. That's how much better I like it. All of the DW/SW games of late I have bought after they've been out a while and kind of messed around with whereas the WO games I have purchased new and played through them without interruption.  It sounds like you haven't played the old SW games, so you may not be as ""sick"" of it as I am, which is good. But even without that issue, I still say the WO series is just...better. I wish the DW/SW games had the same depth/length/detail as WO."
