lifehacks,3dwkmx,AvidLebon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:51:07 2015 UTC,"I'm only pointing out that there's a popular misconception that serrated knives are somehow better than straight knives for everything, which only exists because people (A) buy knives made of cheap stamped ""surgical"" steel that can't hold an edge, and (B) don't bother sharpening them, ever.  Serrated knives, for the most part, are a crutch. They add blade surface so a serrated knife will take longer to dull than a straight knife of the same material. However, the tips will also wear out faster, and the serrations (particularly on super-cheap knives) also wind up shredding the stuff you're cutting, which may not always be what you want to do.  But having said that, yes, knives come in all sorts of shapes and sizes because, while an 8"" or 10"" chef's knife is great for almost any slicing and dicing task in a kitchen, it's not good at everything. Jack of trades and all that."

lifehacks,3dwkmx,lagoon83,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:28:02 2015 UTC,"Here in Mexico we mostly use green sour lemons, they look like this, it's very rare to see anyone using yellow sweet lemons. They're actually variations of the same thing, the same plant domesticated to obtain different characteristics, just like all dogs -chihuahuas, huskies, labs, etc.- are Canis lupus familiaris, both sweet and sour lemons are different types of Citrus lemon.  In Mexico we call these ones lime. They have a delicate sweet flavour. I'm not entirely sure to which extent this applies to Mexico-USA border, but in the portion from Mesoamerica to South America this is what I'm aware is the regular thing."
lifehacks,3dwkmx,Pelusteriano,9,Mon Jul 20 07:36:43 2015 UTC,"Your green lemons are totally limes at least here in Washington. What you call limes don't look terribly familiar, although they look like a much lighter American lime. Limes here are by no means sweet and delicate. Lower quality ones are tart and almost bitter, compared to the sharp bite of a lemon. The very ripe ones might be sweeter, but they're mostly used to compliment other tart flavors."

Here (in the UK), in my experience at least, yellow lemons are renowned for being incredibly bitter - I don't think we'd ever refer to them as being sweet! Probably says something about our diet, though...   Interestingly, I'd always thought the green sour lemons were what we'd call limes... but now I'm not so sure! I've definitely seen them sold as limes in supermarkets - they're smaller, darker and more round than the limes you linked to.

Did you know broccoli is almost a sweet flavor? Cause it totally is. Just a mild sweetness but it's delicious. Probably the only time I ever gobbled up broccoli. Or in Ecuador I had this purple cabbage looking stuff that tasted delicious and was quite sweet despite seeming to have nothing added to it, just blanched."

lifehacks,3dw3jq,cluster_1,67,Mon Jul 20 01:32:59 2015 UTC,"Actually the dose on the bottle is probably WAY too much. Most bottles tell you to take 1-5mg, when a lot of people find a more effective dose at around 150-300 micrograms. Melatonin follows a U shape dose response, so more isn't necessarily better. You can ask this question over at /r/Supplements for a more in depth explanation.  Edit : meant mg no g Edit: Study done on lower dose of melatonin"

lifehacks,3dw3jq,Daannii,7,Mon Jul 20 02:08:54 2015 UTC,"/r/insomnia might help more.  I had issues with sleeplessness from the time I was 6, and was finally diagnosed and medicated when I was 17. I'm 26 now, and I try to take as little Ambien as possible, and instead supplement just a quarter dose with what might be considered an overdose of Melatonin and Benadryl. The dosage needs for sleeping pills -- especially the really harmless ones -- is hard to judge blindly. You could take a large dose and just happen to have a kind of natural strong tolerance to it.  If you're able to, take a 5mg a few days before a flight where you know you'll need it. If you're noticeably drowsy and drop off, then the recommended dosage is the correct one for you. If you don't see any noticeable changes in inertia/heart rate/clarity with 5mg, then you're just naturally tolerant of this particular herb, and it probably won't hurt to take 10mg or 20mg.  For reference, after 10 years of trying sleeping pills (for diagnosed insomnia), I take 5mg Ambien + 0.25mg Xanax (both prescribed) + 50mg melatonin + 200mg Benadryl + Chamomile tea, in order to get to sleep. I am a 160 lb 5'3"" female with an active lifestyle. This is every night. I am aware that this looks dangerous, and my doctors are aware that I do this. Melatonin looks and sounds like it could potentially be dangerous... But I'm pretty sure an entire bottle couldn't even kill a toddler, even if that toddler deserved it."
lifehacks,3dw3jq,spacecowgirl,11,Mon Jul 20 01:53:53 2015 UTC,Forget the melatonin.  Benadryl (or generic equivalent) will really help you on a flight. It's not going to knock you out. Nothing over the counter will.   But it will make you pretty sleepy and relaxed.   I recently has a 9 hr flight. I took some right after take off. I can't sleep on planes. But I semi dozed off for a few hours and that really helped the time pass.

There are no regulated manufacturing standards in place for many herbal compounds and some marketed supplements have been found to be contaminated with toxic metals or other drugs. Herbal/health supplements should be purchased from a reliable source to minimize the risk of contamination. The use of melatonin derived from animal pineal tissue may carry the risk of contamination or the means of transmitting viral material. The synthetic form of this medication does not carry this risk.

I recently realized that this is what it looked like wearing ankle socks with Chucks. I bought about six pairs of socks very similar to these but started running into the same issue over and over. I'd put on my shoes and fifteen steps out of the house the heel of the sock would have dropped under my foot. I'd reach in there with a finger and fish the sock out but would have to do it every ten minutes.  I came across a reddit post a couple months ago, it was actually a link to the channel of a runner and he explained in detail how to tie this knot. I don't call it a runner's knot, I call it a Chuck knot. Your shoe stays on so tight. The way you tighten the knot as you're tying it negates any loosening as you walk and run around. It takes a little more time to tie and untie then it does to just slip them on like I used to, but it's well worth it. My socks stay exactly where they're supposed to."

I used to need to tie my shoes after like 2km of walking. it was very annoying to stop so often or have a very loose heel.

The eye can only hold a small amount of tear volume and adding drops to the eye creates excess tear volume which is immediately drained. Eye drops when correctly instilled don't last long at all, but by placing them directly at the site of drainage you are shortening that timeframe even more.   The commonly taught method is to pull down the lower eyelid while slightly looking up and aim for the pocket you create. Aiming for the eyeball itself you are more likely to flinch, and the eye drop can actually splash out a little. After administering, then close the eye and plug the nasolacrimal duct with your finger for 30 seconds will keep the eye drops localized longer."

lifehacks,3dkrpl,MattieTheSpud,2,Fri Jul 17 06:36:13 2015 UTC,I'd think wax would create an adhesive for the debris to stick to. A lot of theme parks use this method for their open-front stores. It keeps bugs out and gives you a nice cooling blast when you walk in.

A simple solution for a home bar is to to turn off the light above them, or change the bulb color. Bright white light above clear smooth glassware is asking for every imperfection to be illuminated. Since the glassware is purely decorative it could be replaced with something textured, or colored. Both of which would make the issue of dust a non-issue aesthetically.  At a restaurant I'd go with another commenter, and just accept they need to be washed and polished on the daily. Getting anything in the above paragraph approved through bureaucracy is futile.

lifehacks,3dpbq1,Freymz,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:50:46 2015 UTC,"Actually, the minimalist look is very popular. The key is to make sure that each item visible is special/loved/attractive. Chances are your stuff isn't.  The problem with this question is what looks better to me might not look better to you. Flip through some decorating magazines and notice what features catch your eye repeatedly. Colors, lighting, textures, etc.   It would also greatly help if you could post a photo. Here are some general tips:  -make most of your large permanent items a neutral color and use smaller, inexpensive items to add color. When you get bored of them, it's easy to switch out the colors. A neutral background goes well with any colors.   -look at a color chart. There are lots of ways to blend and mix colors. For a simple start, choose your favorite color. Start with your neutral background and then smaller items in different shades of blue, and in different textures/fabrics. A two color look is amazing if you use a wide range of the accent color and lots of different textures. If everything is the same shade/fabric, it will look flat.  -Pick a few coordinating colors and make the textures more similar for a different but easy look.   -Paint one wall of your room as an accent wall. If you go for a bright color, it will look much brighter than it does on the card. Sheen (satin, matte, shiny, flat) makes a huge difference even using the exact same paint color.   It's cheaper to get one can of good quality paint (Behr) than several cans of cheaper paint. Preparing the wall to receive paint is just as important as actually painting.   -Instead of scattering little things for an accent, pick a bright color and add one large item (rug, deskchair, bookshelf, wall hanging) and a few smaller items that continue that color (pencil cup, desk lamp, bowl/vase).  -It's usually better to pick fabric/object you like and have paint mixed to match, than go the other way. Much wider range of paint mixes than fabric/object colors.   -Start with easily changeable and very inexpensive items as you begin and figure out what you like. Swapping a trash can is much easier than repainting a wall.   -Before starting anything, walk around furniture stores, craft/decorating stores and make notes of what you like. When you notice the same type of thing is written again and again, it's a safe bet.  -Touch stuff. Women tend to do this naturally when shopping. Run your fingertips (more nerves there) over different surfaces and learn what is pleasing to you. Obviously this matters more for things you will be sleeping/sitting/leaning upon.   -Check out a couple basic decorating 101 books from the library. Even if styles change, the principles remain the same.  Also look at /r/interiordesign, /r/budgetdecor, /r/interiordecorating, /r/decor, /r/designmyroom  Have fun. Start cheap (yard sales, goodwill, stuff from friends/relatives) and easy."

Better herb stores have an herb called ""horehound"".  If you chew on just a few grains of it, your throat will be quickly soothed and coated and no longer in agonizing pain for many hours.  But there is a cost.  Horehound has the most repulsive flavor you have ever tasted.  And the awful flavor lasts as long as does its throat soothing ability.  And it stays just as strong to the end as it was in the beginning.  Best review:  ""My throat was so raw I thought I was going to die.  Then it was soothed and didn't hurt anymore.  But two hours later that foul taste had me wanting to kill somebody.""  In past, they made horehound into candy, but it never worked as well as the herb.

Basically a three person job - where one person held you down, another pried your mouth open, and the third took long q-tips dipped in iodine and ""painted"" your tonsils. Terrible, terrible shit. This is going back 30+ years. I'm sick of the tonsil stones though. I have really bad allergies and my constant post-nasal drip makes the summer unbearable."

All in all, it took about two weeks to reach a decently healed state, if not longer. But I was a pretty extreme case. Most go more smoothly than my surgery went."

If I have a particularly stressful gig vocally, I'll even brew a cup when I get home to soothe my throat.

I endured it for three months straight once, convinced I had a nagging respiratory infection that wouldn't go away. Ate bags of cough drops per season. Then at school it was one or two specific rooms that would start my throat getting itchy and having to cough a lot. It was weird. I wanted to simply blame it on the weather but it was too specific and circumstantial.  Last time I went to the clinic for it, they said try antihistamines or anti allergy medicine. I did that and it knocked it out. Often I will wake up in the morning with a ticklish throat and can't really cough it all up, but if I take something antihistamines it goes away in an hour or less.  My guess, those rooms at school just irritated me because they were so dusty. It could happen all year round including fall and winter. So it must just be allergies then too. After taking antihistamines regularly it became less of a problem."

lifehacks,3d6rt0,lycao,42,Tue Jul 14 04:14:04 2015 UTC,"It'll remove the UV and anti-scratch coatings, making them very susceptible to future damage.   The easiest fix is probably ordering new glasses online from some place like Zenni-- I've been very happy with the ones I paid twenty bucks for."

lifehacks,3d6rt0,Anal-Fluids,5,Tue Jul 14 14:18:05 2015 UTC,Yup.  And make sure you ask them for your PD number (pupil distance I believe).. its how far apart your eyes are and needed to order from Zenni.  Its a lot easier to ask your eye doctor for it than to try and measure it yourself.
lifehacks,3d6rt0,ariven,8,Tue Jul 14 15:17:33 2015 UTC,"Not entirely sure, but couldn't buffing actually change the convex/concave of the lens changing the prescription too? I can't imagine it would be noticeable, but just a thought."
lifehacks,3d6rt0,TexasTmac,5,Tue Jul 14 06:32:56 2015 UTC,"Good point; you're removing material from the lens so it'll definitely alter the thickness and probably the profile as well.  My biggest concern, though, is that the surface coatings you're removing are significantly tougher than the inner layer."
lifehacks,3d6rt0,ZombieHoratioAlger,3,Tue Jul 14 07:39:14 2015 UTC,Tougher and also what some people pay hundreds of extra  dollars for. It would be like wet sanding a car and not putting any clear coat back over the resurfaced area causing decreased integrity as well as increase the porosity. This could lead to quicker oxidation and  facilitate other defects.
lifehacks,3d6rt0,TexasTmac,2,Tue Jul 14 07:48:34 2015 UTC,"I'm actually in need of new glasses. How is the fit of the glasses from them? Every time I've gotten glasses in person they had to adjust them to fit my head, so I'm hesitant to order some online incase they don't fit."
lifehacks,3d6rt0,lycao,3,Tue Jul 14 07:23:01 2015 UTC,"One pair from Zenni fit out of the box perfectly, the others needed a tiny bit of bending (which I did myself with some soft-jaw pliers, but the eye center at places like Costco or Walmart will do free adjustments)."
lifehacks,3d6rt0,ZombieHoratioAlger,2,Tue Jul 14 07:34:02 2015 UTC,"Appreciate the info.  Was just looking at the site, and for those prices I'm willing to take the chance of it not fitting, or needing to adjust them/get them adjusted.  Last time I went to the optometrist they quoted me prices of around $400 for one pair. I could get over a dozen pairs from zenni for that much. Definitely going to order a couple pairs from them."
lifehacks,3d6rt0,lycao,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:46:31 2015 UTC,"It will also remove any anti-fog coating.  But that crap only works so well in the first place, and I have 'successfully' removed scratches in safety glasses, face shields, pickguard and all plastic on the guitar (after de-badging), lots of stuff.     It does work, but it'll almost never look factory again, because to get the scratch out you need to remove material, when you get it glossy again you can see the small depression in the plastic you buffed out in how reflections move, still much better than a scratch imo though."
lifehacks,3d6rt0,BonRennington,2,Tue Jul 14 15:51:23 2015 UTC,I'd imagine for deep scratches if you remove enough material to fix it then you'd be altering the optical properties of the lens.

lifehacks,3d6rt0,GDZK,0,Tue Jul 14 06:58:52 2015 UTC,"You might want to try a headlamp restoration kit (here's one I used recently for my headlamps).   Reading /u/Cartmansimon's recommendation of the Novus made me think of it since this headlamp kit has a few different compounds that are applied at different points. Additionally, there is a final coating that I believe adds the UV protectant back on, which would help address /u/ZombieHoratioAlger's points.  If anything, you could use the Novus, and then find out whatever liquid is used in the final phase of the headlamp restoration and then apply this to help protect the plastic.  I'm just guessing though, so take my suggestion with a grain of caution (e.g., try these chemicals on a small portion of the plastic, or on some similar feeling plastic).  If you do use the headlamp kit, do note that during the first 2 or 3 phases, the plastic was very cloudy, and it didn't get clear until the final phase when the last chemical (i.e., my theorized UV protector) gets applied."

lifehacks,3d4vz8,Argit,47,Tue Jul 14 14:18:25 2015 UTC,"I've been trying to hard to acquire this habit lately.  The goal is to wake up at 5am every day so I can get a run in before sunrise. Which I can do - but then I want to nap around noon.  Waking up isn't my problem, as I can easily develop that discipline if it's important to me. My problem is getting at least 6.5-7 hours of sleep at night before my alarm goes off at 5am.  I'm finding it damn near impossible to fall asleep before midnight. It seems like 11pm is when all the best and juiciest text messages are sent and phone calls are made. 11pm is when all the great plans are made. It's the romantic hour.  At 11pm it's easy to say to yourself ""I'll just do it. I'll only have to be tired for 2 or 3 days before I fall into a routine and can fall asleep at 10pm."" Then I end up staying awake until 1am watching YouTube and texting. Suddenly getting a run in before my workday begins doesn't seem so important when your alarm goes off at 5am and you've only had 4 hours of sleep. Somehow laying in your warm bed suddenly becomes the most pleasurable thing you've ever experienced and you say to yourself, ""Ahhh screw it, we'll start tomorrow.""  Shia Lebouf would be sad if you knew this struggle of mine.  Also - I find it a lot more challenging than it should be to not look at my phone or computer or iPad an hour before sleep.   Maybe my problem is I've read this article and every one like it on the internet, but I just can't seem to put a few key strategies into practice.  How's it going for you, OP?  EDIT: Spelling"
lifehacks,3d4vz8,scottiesetsfire,10,Mon Jul 13 15:53:23 2015 UTC,"In addition to everything said, I would recommend taking melatonin a bit before bed.   I take about 1.5 mg 30 mins to an hour before my determined bedtime. It kind of forces me to go to sleep at a specific time and it's only 1.5 mg so I don't wake up groggy or too tired in the morning. It's worth a shot and only cost ~$3.   I use this in conjunction with a sleep schedule calculator, which supposedly helps you wake up at the end of a sleep cycle.  Good luck!"

No horror stories from me about melatonin, it seemed to do the trick, and you know its working because there is a very slight dry mouth, but that actually helped me to think it was working.

But don't self medicate, melatonin is created naturally in your body once its gets darker and shit like that, just don't sit close to screens without proper color temperatures etc stated above. You don't need to press more into your body, and you shouldn't unless a good doctor advice you to. Even though it's not to bad for you, it could definitely fuck some shit up, not majorly or persistent(at least what I know).   Abusing it will cause your body to stop making as much of its own, and also for some reason after I've been taking even as small dosage as 1.5mg for an extended amount of time, I've started to get fucked up afterwards, morning sickness and shit like that. Not really heroin but it wasn't pleasant. Should have stuck with what the doctors told me, after all they have been practicing that medical shit for a while, while most other people who recommend stuff online is just a self medicating junkie.  Shit don't even take my word about not taking it, you might benefit from it. If you are having trouble falling asleep, ask a doctor for his advice. There even is a sub for that /r/AskDocs/, some of them are still self medicating junkies, but you will probably get more valuable information regarding medecine from there compared from /r/lifehacks   Edit: you're down voting me for not supporting self medication? We'll go ahead then, let natural selection take care of the problem. 5 years in med-school is obviously a waste of time, you should listen to drug addicts online instead of people trained in the stuff!"

lifehacks,3d4vz8,PNWoutdoors,4,Tue Jul 14 02:50:56 2015 UTC,"As an ex-runner, I would say there is nothing magical about running at 5 am. If running at 5 am disrupts your ability to get 6.5-7 hours of sleep, then run in the afternoon or evening. The most important thing about exercising (to get maximum benefit) is to do it consistently and frequently.  Consistently means running at the same time frame like 5 am or 6 pm, same days, and length. This helps your body prepare for a run and helps your metabolism. Next, run frequently. At least 3x a week, otherwise your body won't get into a rhythm. After doing this for 4-6 weeks your body will get into a rhythm that you will be able to sleep better and quicker, feel more energized, be more relaxed, lower resting heart rate etc."

Oh, that's interesting, because there are only about 150 million Americans in the entire labor force. Clearly it's the individual's problem.  It's so easy. Just sleep more, dummy. Get some exercise to make sure you are tired at night. Try some chair-cersizes mid-day if you're one of the tens of millions of people who spend 9 hours a day hunched in a cardboard box with your face pressed to one of those pesky blue screens. Don't get up. It's not break time.   Not enough of a workout to get your z's? Maybe get up at 5am so you can get some exercise before work. That way you'll be tired, so you can sleep, so you can get up, so you'll be tired, so you can sleep. Just make sure sleep starts at 9pm, though, so you'll actually need to get in bed at 8pm. That way you can get one hour of focused quiet time to get you ready for sleep.  It's also important to make sure you wake up according to your own personal circadian rhythm. It's just slightly more important that your circadian rhythm wakes you up at 5am, you're gonna be a little fucked otherwise. Rhythm feeling a little out of sync? Just take drugs. Take them in the morning or at night. Maybe both. Whatever works for you! Just shut up and dope up, you big puss!  And watch out for those naps! They'll really get ya!

Second step get some physical exercise in the afternoon, something you're not used to - specifically, harder than you're used to.  Third step - get ready for bed and get in bed and close your eyes at an early hour.   This is where your own personal decision making comes in.  The exercise you did earlier will help to make you tired but you have to fight your usual impulses to open your eyes, watch tv, read, browse the internet etc in spite of yourself.   I don't care if your brain is ticking over with a thousand thoughts, just practise some self discipline and keep those eyes closed and your body/ brain will get trained and give in and you'll be up at 5am on the regular (quickly without the exercise too) in no time.   :)"

lifehacks,3d4vz8,mjselvig,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:18:30 2015 UTC,"The top part is just ""Make yourself so miserable you have to go to sleep""  The bottom part works, but it's hard to break the habit of trying to cram in an extra 15 minutes of sleep. I do it even when my alarm app tracks my sleep patterns, and I wake up afterwards even less rested than the first time.  People are suggesting lying in bed or turning off electronics an hour before actually going to sleep. I don't spend my time reading or particularly enjoy doing it, so that would just feel like wasted time and I would get edgy and miserable.   Usually when I go to lie down and I'm not sleepy, I lie there and more and more thoughts pile on, instead of my mind emptying and making it easier to sleep. My eyes adjust to the darkness so it feels brighter than it is and not like I should be sleeping.  The only thing that regularly works for me (and even then it's not foolproof) is having something firmly planted in my mind that I have to do immediately after I wake up, or a solid reason why I can't fall back to sleep. If there's an early work meeting that'll do it. I managed to get myself up early for a morning jog a couple of times, but like other people said, that just makes me insanely sleepy in the early afternoon."

Well, now you have their MAC, which is only good for telling you the manufacturer of the device (or just the NIC). Some devices will give up the user defined hostname (JoeBobsiPhone, etc). Unless you're setting up some sort of home linux router with squid (to capture traffic logs, or MitM sessions), I don't see how this is going to be much help. Again, never had a device magically connect to an open access point, but if you went the custom Linux box route, I suppose you could run kismet and set the transmit power of the WiFi low enough, and then put the box like next to the cash register so kismet would only record the MAC if someone got close enough to it.

It's been a while since I've read about Google maps and their usage of that, but I'm guessing it wouldn't involve having to connect, but simply relaying to the Google servers a list of available WiFi networks and the signal strength so as to do some poor man's triangulation."
lifehacks,3d0x52,digitalchaos,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:47:40 2015 UTC,"Most devices since the Windows XP days don't automatically connect to WiFi networks.

I believe this is disabled by default these days, however it's been a long time since I've had a fresh install of iOS. iOS will only every automatically connect to networks it's been connect to in the past.  Also, as of iOS 8, Apple devices won't even give out their true MAC address when scanning for networks, so even a passive scan isn't going to capture any real data from an iOS device passing by.  All that said, there is a way to maybe trick someone's phone into connecting, and that's by using really common SSIDs that the ""thief"" may have connected to before.

lifehacks,3d0x52,96teg,9,Mon Jul 13 00:10:06 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but this is crap. You don't need a device to connect to an AP to figure out its MAC. Any wireless device that has wifi turned on is constantly sending probe requests. Just look at them! And if you are looking at probe requests, you already have some even more interesting info available: every SSID in their preferred network list. This tends to give you a great idea where they spend their time. With some effort, you can also look up the physical locations of any AP running those SSID's and deduce the physical addresses.    And this is all without their device even connecting to you.... You could take it a step further and start spoofing  the SSID's in their preferred network list and, if any of them are open, have their device automatically connect. This is like OP's original suggestion, but for EVERY POSSIBLE open SSID in existence instead of just one. Once they are connected, you can intercept and/or tamper with the background traffic of their device (email, etc) to figure out even more info about the person. There are some questionable legal situations though.  All of the above is extremely easy to automate and you can even do it on cheap router hardware if you want. KARMA is one example. Here is a screenshot of KARMA watching the probe requests of a device searching for its preferred network list, then it fakes the ""attwifi"" SSID and convinces the device to connect. http://i.imgur.com/SPRUrxZ.jpg"

It sounds like they were only doing very basic analysis, but I'd be curious of they ended up advancing after the talk.   One thing I have been toying with is the best way to automate going from SSID to physical address. In theory, it's just utilizing geopositioning databases that are based on wireless. Things like Skyhook Wireless or Wiggle, for example. One thing I didn't mention was the idea of having multiple devices collaborate to initiate triggers (motion on a webcam) or to advance the intelligence (knowing if multiple people are being blackbagged or something along those lines).   If you want to get your hands dirty... Pretty much everything but the geopositioning can be trivially done with something cheap like a wifi pineapple even if you aren't extremely versed in the tech.

The mac will only provide supplementary evidence from the router logs that x-device did some specific activity to ip:port.  And this isn't even reliable because MAC addresses can be spoofed.

The OVLT, an area in your brain that controls how concentrated your blood is, will secrete vasopressin.

It's not until vasopressin's effects are nearly maximal that the OVLT will tell you, ""hey, idiot, go drink some water for fuck's sake.""  If you're thirsty, you're already pretty dehydrated.

Vasopressin acts sooner and will concentrate your urine -- the color of your urine is a good indicator of how concentrated it is, which, in turn, is a reasonable method of assessing hydration status.   Is looking at your pee perfect? Fuck no. All the other indices aren't either -- especially when you're dealing with geriatric patients where all of them suck (is anyone registered at Cochrane? Could you check and see which one sucks less, I'd appreciate it). But it is reasonable, non invasive and effective.

You are basically saying she cut sodium (salt) out of her food and then had to start drinking sodium in powerade.   Also if she has that many heart related issues she should look into and discuss a low carb diet with her doctor. It's been shown that the whole high carb (food pyramid) causes heart disease, diabetes, and usually obesity to go with it."

lifehacks,3cvzy7,DrSpaceman4Prez,16,Sat Jul 11 14:51:30 2015 UTC,"Why are you drinking so much water?  You might want to get it checked out with a dr as there are a few conditions that can make a person unreasonably thirsty (ie: diabetes, certain kidney issues related to over secretion of H20).  I'm a nurse and remember a young patient (20-yr old girl) who came into hospital for observations to determine the cause of her needing to drink and the pee about 5 litres of water a day.  She moved to a different unit and I never found out the reason.  Just know that 2-3 gallons is way above normal.  Is it from working out, heat, or high altitude?  If you're sweating a lot you should also bear in mind the need to replace electrolytes (sugars and salts) but don't go overboard on gatorade.  If you're not super thirsty and are making yourself drink that much, I would back off some.  Your body doesn't need that much water to function well.  Worse case scenario is you have lower levels of sodium in your body due to the constant urinating you must be doing.   This wiki page gives you an idea about the problems caused with low sodium levels.  It's definitely worth mentioning to your doctor as it's not normal drinking behaviour and could be linked to kidney or hormone issue."

lifehacks,3cvzy7,violencewithin,5,Sat Jul 11 12:08:32 2015 UTC,"Just make sure some of the water is replacing the electrolytes you're losing through sweat (salts and sugars).  Drinks like gatorade are good for this (or powders like Emergen-C), but most people over consume them and drink them like soda without the exercise to go alongside so they get a bad rep.  Water intake is different for everyone- there are lots of factors that can effect it.  Size, gender, pregnancy/breastfeeding, altitude, ambient temperature and exercise all make a difference."

Snopes actually debunked it as an absolute minimum or a guideline, but not a rule of thumb, or just read here:   [S]ome nutritionists insist that half the country is walking around dehydrated. We drink too much coffee, tea and sodas containing caffeine, which prompts the body to lose water, they say; and when we are dehydrated, we don't know enough to drink.  Can it be so? Should healthy adults really be stalking the water cooler to protect themselves from creeping dehydration?  Not at all, doctors say. ""The notion that there is widespread dehydration has no basis in medical fact,"" says Dr. Robert Alpern, dean of the medical school at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.  Doctors from a wide range of specialties agree: By all evidence, we are a well-hydrated nation. Furthermore, they say, the current infatuation with water as an all-purpose health potion — tonic for the skin, key to weight loss — is a blend of fashion and fiction and very little science."

lifehacks,3cvzy7,Ai_of_Vanity,23,Sat Jul 11 17:29:59 2015 UTC,"As an athlete who works out one to two times a day I tend to drink around two gallons of water every day. The first thing I do in the morning is drink two 16 oz glasses of water. And usually have a third before I work out approximately one hour after waking up. My water consumption/needs are a lot higher than the average persons, but still drinking a gallon of water a day will not hurt as long as you maintain a proper diet that includes all of your electrolyte needs, which isn't that difficult.  One thing I can say is if you are trying to do anything active you should be well hydrated. If you're not getting enough water you will not be able to perform, you will not feel good, and you will not have the motivation to reach your goals because of these things. The amount of water you consume on a daily basis should reflect your needs, and your goals. If you plan on going for a run, you should have been drinking extra water before hand, once you start it is too late for that water to help you on your run as it takes a good bit of time for your body to absorb it properly. When I was in the Navy I was told the hydration for today's tasks was done yesterday.  Most of this is just food for thought, but I felt like it would be interesting for some of you to get a different perspective on things."

The example used was recipes so I'll stick with that. You write a recipe for Chicken stir fry on the first blank page, then on the last page you write Chinese on one line and maybe Chicken on the next. Then go back to your recipe and on that page, darken the edge of the page on the lines that are shared with Chinese and Chicken on the back page. If done correctly (felt tip pen would be handy) you can see these lines while the notebook is closed. If you're looking for Chinese recipes, you go to the back page and check that line, look for each page that has a colored in segment there and you can quickly flip to each one."

What's interesting is how these old school ideas keep coming back with fresh currency for new generations.  FWIW, if you are a note taker, I highly recommend learning to write with, and use a fountain pen.  Beyond the sheer beauty of the instrument, it forces you to slow down and write with a bit more thought.  Among the many virtues of fountain pens is that writing things down physically a bit slower than usual tends to help reinforce it in your mind.  I used to use Koo-I-Noor drafting pens (REALLY slow to write with) when I was putting my notes together for college final exams.  Just doing that made it easier to remember the material.

You do not understand the gas code, or how the systems operate. And 3, taking down or opening up walls. You will not be able to tell by looking at it if it is a bearing wall. I'm dealing with an issue now where a customer saw some crap on a diy site about opening a wall to give his dining room an open feel. Well, it was load bearing, and now the second floor has started to sag. His second floor is now down almost 2 inches in some spots, and he's looking at about 80k in repairs. He broke dwv, buckled tiles,  spilt flooring, and pulled the plate for the second floor (basically his exterior wall is being pulled inside). Don't ask handy men anything. They don't have construction licenses for a reason. Most contractors will let you know what you have for free or for a minimal charge. It's all about being safe. The above mentioned customer is absolutely boned, because there was no permit, license or insurance on the original wall job, his HOI told him to pound sand. Now he has a mortgage on a house he can't live in, and has to scrounge 80k to go home.

lifehacks,3cnpwu,vinostintos,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:53:59 2015 UTC,Gaming headphones aren't good? Not even for gaming?
lifehacks,3cnpwu,montarion,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:01:13 2015 UTC,"No, not even for gaming. Compared to regular or professional grade headphones, a lot more money is spent on advertising them and they usually make their appearance a priority(like you would use them anywhere but inside your room), so generally, they won't provide very good value for your money.   Their sound quality usually isn't on par with other headphones' in their category. I think there are like 2-3 three models that have okay sound quality for their price but they're still not the best option. Their sound is bloated, inaccurate, they have pretty a shitty soundstage and the software they ship with to make them better only makes them worse and more inaccurate.  Those gaming headphones that claim to be 5.1 or 7.1 or whatever don't provide you with better positioning than regular, stereo headphones would. Especially if they're virtual surround, that's not supposed to be very good.  The microphones attached to them are also not very great quality. You'd get pretty much the same sound from a $5 clip on mic. If you want the best of the best, though, you could check out modmics.  And lastly: they have very flimsy build quality compared to other headphones in their price range. A lot of headphones come with detachable cables nowadays, so if the cable breaks, you don't have to throw the whole headphone away. Most gaming headphones still don't have this feature and it's not acceptable for $100-150 headphones to only last for 2-3 years(imo). Especially Razer headphones are notorious for how easily they break.  The general consensus is that open back headphones are a lot better for gaming because they have a wider soundstage and better positioning. But stay away of headphones made by gaming companies like Razer, Steelseries, etc. Sennheiser, AKG, Audio Technica, etc. are all considered very good in audiophile circles.   Something like the Sennheise HD598 + a modmic is really all you'd want from a gaming headphone and more. Or if you wanted something on the cheaper side, the Superlux HD668B is ridiculously good value for its price(<$50). Slap on a $5 clip on mic, and you're good to go.  But don't take my word for it, go to /r/headphones , do your research, post in the daily sticky thread and see what other people say."

It can produce cold so intense you need to use caution not to cause frost bite.  This thermodynamic effect is also the reason why salt is used on ice in the winter.

lifehacks,3cjeb5,realigion,2,Wed Jul 8 12:48:30 2015 UTC,"The point is that heat dissipates from water faster than it does from a solid, cooling it down, one of the reasons why people sweat.  You won't have an ice cold beer this way, but it'll be a few degrees cooler than it was.  If you put it in a freezer, it works better.  If you put it in a salted ice bath, it works the best, but all are using the same principle of dissipating heat."
lifehacks,3cjeb5,thekiyote,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:47:40 2015 UTC,"The can will feel colder, but that doesn't make the liquid lose heat faster."
lifehacks,3cjeb5,realigion,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:04:40 2015 UTC,"Actually, it does mean it cools faster.  This is the formula:  Q = h*A*(Tbeer - Tair)  Q = heat transfer rate of heat from the beer to the air in the refrigerator/freezer A = surface area of the beer Tbeer = temperature of the beer Tair = temperature of the air in the refrigerator/freezer (or ice solution) h = heat transfer coefficient   When you put a wet rag around a can of beer, it drops the heat transfer coefficient compared to air, but Tair is now actually Ttowel, which, at its lowest, will only be 32 degrees (the temperature the water will turn to ice).  Ice is actually a pretty good insulator (poor heat transfer coefficient), which is why igloos.    If you put the beer in the ice bath, the heat transfer coefficient is the same as the towel, but the temperature is lower. How much colder depends on how much salt you use, maxing out at about -6 degrees, but that'd take a lot of salt."
lifehacks,3cjeb5,thekiyote,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:01:51 2015 UTC,"Well more importantly it increases the surface area. That's why ""heat dissipates from water faster than from a solid.""

Tested in batch spot checks in Quality Control anything from 7% to 15% and much higher occasionally. He said the reasoning is that it may sit in mom & pop shops in villages for a long, long time and they don't want the alcohol content to degrade with time and nobody ever complains so don't fix what's not broken.  Export Chang is strictly controlled though and bottled draught is more reliable. Of course in the land of defamation suits, I have to stress that this is purely anecdotal and I am in no way stating it to be the truth.  Most people you talk to - also anecdotally - will verify that you never know how many Changs to have, the only consistencies are its inconsistency and it's morning after effect, which can be brutal even if you don't get completely wasted. My own personal  record is 5 big bottles (only ever once and I'm not as big as most) but I definitely have been tipsy to sozzled on just one big bottle dozens of times.

lifehacks,3cjeb5,b0ltzmann138e-23,49,Wed Jul 8 14:52:47 2015 UTC,How to get cold stuff:  Put loooots of cold stuff around it!
lifehacks,3cjeb5,locke-in-a-box,50,Wed Jul 8 17:40:46 2015 UTC,That's not enough - the key is to speed up the heat transfer from the hot object (can) to the cold objects (ice). Adding the salt allows that transfer to happen faster.  Also - the salt lowers the freezing point of water - allowing the water that is in contact with the can to dip bellow 0 C (32 F) and still be liquid. In essence you are making the ice bath be colder by adding salt to it

The virus that causes warts sticks around for so long because it hides from the immune system, (or so I've read.)  Cutting it out likely triggered an immune response. While i'm happy for you, I wouldn't say it's the bestest way for everyone.  I actually had the best luck with cauterization, but it's tough to get anyone to do that anymore. Once by a doctor who gave me a local that also helped control bleeding, and then she cut and scraped away and finally cauterized. Another time before that where I heated up a length of coat hanger and plunged it into the meaty part of my palm.   Second best is a wart zapper circuit but it's slow and I've had to retreat several times.  The problem with duct tape and/or Salicylic acid is just keeping the treatment on your hands.

lifehacks,3ce9m2,laverns,5,Tue Jul 7 17:46:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not a doctor, but I'd recommend you apply it for a few hours at a time, then wash the wart/check for infection.  The problem isn't so much the length of the application as the fact that ACV isn't a medically pure substance, so other things can grow  in it, and it doesn't inhibit bacteria as well as white vinegar would.  It's great stuff to eat because it has a lot of vitamins and useful compounds for the body, but that also makes it edible for bacteria.  Honestly I'd use white vinegar if you want to use vinegar, or something else entirely.  The reason ACV works is that it's a mild acid, just like salicylic acid (aspirin) or white vinegar, and prolonged contact with a mild acid kills the skin around the wart and the wart itself without causing a lot of pain or risking infection."
lifehacks,3ce9m2,Accujack,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:13:44 2015 UTC,Just don't leave it on there permanently or create a tight seal to keep it wet. ACV is acidic to the skin and will do what any liquid would do if you say slept on a bed soaked in it. Really it's just common sense. By the time you wake up the cotton ball is probably already dry but some silly people would use a waterproof bandage to hold it against the skin for several days and the skin starts breaking down.

Then I'd cut away as much of it as I could using some professional-grade cuticle nippers that I got from a beauty salon. They're sort of like a cross between scissors and a nail clipper, super-sharp, and work great when you need precise control.

lifehacks,3ce9m2,thebigslide,6,Tue Jul 7 14:29:55 2015 UTC,"Warts are caused by a virus, called HPV (Human Papillomavirus) of which there are more than 100 types. The virus is transmitted via direct contact, usually entering the body through an area of broken skin. The virus infects the top layer of skin, which causes the skin to grow rapidly causing the bump.   Being that warts are caused by a virus on the skin reinfection or spreading of the wart are common and can cause them to last longer even after treatment (as it kills the wart --tissue buildup, but not the virus).   It is best to keep to wart covered to prevent spreading, wash hands after touching or applying any treatments. Wash towels, sheets and other surfaces that come in regular contact with the uncovered wart.   The treatments vary for each person because of the many types of HPV, immune system differences and hygiene practices.   Rather than using acne cream, crushed aspirin or any of the other treatments mentioned here, buy a wart removal medication. While some of those options contain salicylic acid, it is in much lower concentrations than actual wart remover (usually 5-10% SA for acne products vs. 15-40% for wart remover).  The proper use of salicylic acid:   Salicylic acid is available as a paint, cream, plaster, tape, or patch that you put on the wart. Be sure to read and follow the specific instructions that are supplied with the medicine. Salicylic acid treatment usually takes from 2 to 12 months to cure a wart.  For best results, soak the wart in water to loosen and soften the skin before applying the salicylic acid. This helps the medicine get into the skin more easily. It is best to apply salicylic acid to the wart before you go to bed. Touch only the wart with the medicine. Cover the area with a bandage and wash it off in the morning.  As you continue to apply the salicylic acid, the wart becomes soft. You can then remove dead tissue daily or once or twice a week with careful use of a file or pumice stone or as instructed on the medicine package. Since dead tissue contains live wart virus, dispose of it carefully. The pumice stone or file will also have living wart virus on it, so don't use it for any other purpose, or you may spread the virus.source   The duct tape can be used in combination with salicylic acid as outlined above (use duct tape as opposed to adhesive bandage) or by itself.   The proper use of only duct tape: * Cut a piece of silver duct tape as close to the size of the wart as possible. * Leave the tape in place for 6 days. If the tape falls off, put on a new piece. * After 6 days, remove the tape and soak the area in water. Then gently rub the wart surface down with an emery board or pumice stone. Leave the tape off for 12 hours. * Repeat this process until the wart is gone, but not longer than 2 months.1, 2"
lifehacks,3ce9m2,yosoyreddito,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:16:53 2015 UTC,Does this apply to planter's warts?
lifehacks,3ce9m2,Pongpianskul,5,Tue Jul 7 15:37:27 2015 UTC,"Yes. Plantar means pertaining to the sole of the foot.   The name ""plantar wart"" merely means, a wart that is located on the sole of the foot.   Though because they are caused by a different strain of HPV, they are not as contagious as warts caused by other types. But the virus does thrive in warm, moist environments (showers, locker rooms, shoes) which can spread the virus (thus causing warts).   Due to the pressure of your body weight from walking the wart tends to flatten out or grow inward, as opposed to producing an outward bump as seen in common warts, but is essentially the same.   A common misconception is that plantar warts have seeds or roots that grow through the skin and can attach to the bone. The wart may appear to have a root or seeds, but these are in fact small clusters of the wart just beneath the top layer of the skin. The wart cannot live in any tissue except the skin.1   The methods can be used for plantar warts, but it is not recommended to use a file or pumice stone to scrape as you risk infecting more of the skin because there is no protruding wart tissue. The tape and salicylic acid treatments are not as effective as more invasive methods performed by a doctor because the infected tissue is mostly under the surface of the skin."
lifehacks,3ce9m2,yosoyreddito,6,Tue Jul 7 16:20:05 2015 UTC,"Counting the old wart scars I have, it appears I once had about 12 warts on my fingers and knees during my highschool year. 2 massive ones on both of my thumb knuckles, then also on my thumbs where the cuticle started. A few more on my other fingers, some under the nail. 2 massive ones on both knees. By the massive ones, I'd say they measured 1/2"" diameter by 1/4"" height. They were damn ugly, I had to wear band aids constantly, and they HURT! It got me pretty depressed to be honest.   I tried:   -Freezing them off (at doctors, more than 10x)  -Burning them (at docs, lots of times)  -Over the counter salycic acid (what a joke. Pretty much became a night time routine, but it never worked)  -Numbing and slicing it off a the docs, then burning. (when the doc got bored I guess)  -slicing it myself with a razor blade (numerous desperate attempts)  -Burning with black and mild cigars on my own (while drinking)  -biting them (yuck!)  I saw a dumb article in Men's health about using duct tape. I tried it....it fucking worked! Magically my immune system activated and started destroying all of them. Within a few months all of them were pretty much gone. Changed my life. God bless you, duct tape.   TL;DR: Warts, desperation, victory via duct tape."

lifehacks,3ce9m2,inherentviceroy,6,Tue Jul 7 16:00:18 2015 UTC,"I went to a podiatrist for a plantar wart, and here's how he prescribed the duct tape method.   1.) Soak your foot in warm/hot water with a tablespoon of table salt to every two cups of water for 15 minutes. Afterwards, dry off and put a clean piece of regular duct tape. Do this for a week to start softening the hard callus/skin of the wart.   2.) After a shower every morning, dry off your foot and put salicylic acid on ONLY the wart, not the surrounding skin, and immediately cover with a clean piece of duct tape. It's usually a good idea to use a large piece to prevent it from coming off during the day.  3.) Before bed, repeat the salicylic acid and duct tape. The next morning in the shower, scrub the dead skin off (it will hurt, especially with a deep wart, but it's the only way), and repeat the process. You CANNOT skip switching out the duct tape, or skip scrubbing off the layer of dead skin.   4.) After your foot is completely pain free and the wart appears to be gone, repeat the first step of salt-water soaks to remove the last of the dead skin, make sure the wart is gone and promote new skin growth.   It's important to note that you MUST clean the shower with Lysol or bleach after every use, especially if you share it with another person. The virus that causes the wart can spread to your other foot or to another person, and that can easily be prevented with a spray down of the tub. The duct tape method did work for me, though it took a couple of months because I had avoided going to the doctor in the first place and had no idea I had a plantar wart. My podiatrist said that for most warts, he's found this is the best and cheapest method. There's a chemical in the duct tape that, yes, can cure a wart on its own, but with the salicylic acid, jumpstarts the process. He tries to not jump to freezing or surgery, and instead sticks with this. But it HAS to be plain, original duct tape. Colored tape or specialty duct tapes have a different chemical makeup and won't work. Hope this helps!"

It gets all its nutrition from the blood supply it redirects to itself.

lifehacks,3bt03j,JBB_Alien,70,Thu Jul 2 01:05:36 2015 UTC,"Exactly. As a frequent traveler, this happens (damn TSA).  My tip - take a hanger from your hotel room. It's almost always a wooden hanger with a metal hook. Unscrew the metal hook from the hanger body. Head to the bathroom and grab a wash cloth and some self confidence. Place the bottle on the counter and put the screw end of the hook right on the cork edge and use the cloth to push down. Hard. The metal hook will slide right between the cork and the glass letting air out and allowing the cork to push in.   Done.   Now drink alone."

You remove any foil covering the cork, place the bottom of the bottle into the heel of the shoe, the bang the bottom of the heel against a wall. At first, it didn't work and I was crestfallen.

Think of it this way: if Google is where you go to search for things, then reddit is where you go to see the things that people have found.  reddit is a beautiful fractal with sections, called subreddits.  But remember reddit can be weird not because reddit is weird but because humans are weird.  So reddit is lot like life: it is what you make it.  But links are only the tip of the redditberg, because people can discuss the links and this is where the true heart of reddit lies.  And reddit displays comments in a way that encourages back-and-forth discussions.  But luckily reddit has a way to deal with comments you think are unhelpful.  With its rapid-fire democracy and shocking quick reactions, reddit can sometimes makes you feel more like a citizen of the Internet than a citizen of your own country.  So if, like me, you use reddit all day it's more than worth a couple bucks a month.  edit: added source link"

I know that there's probably a divergence in death rate between different kinds of motorcycles, and I'd be interested to find that data, but I think you'd have to have a warped perception of statistics to believe that the death rate for low-powered motorcycles isn't still going to be far, far higher than cars."

Further, I would imagine the sub-cultures within the motorcyling community (of which I'm part) to have vastly differing metrics. The BMW safe-drivers club and scooter commuters are going to be different to the Japanese crotch rocket club and the 'chav with no licence and a stolen scooter' demographic in terms of risk.  A quick search for statistics showed little sub categorisation of 'motorcycles' - which is a bit shit / lazy really.

I'm may ghet downvoted a lot for breaking the safety circlejerk about how motorcycles are inherently dangerous, and for being blunt, but I have a lot of experience and I want to share it for those who have never touched a motorcycle (like most of /r/motorcycles).    First thing is first:  scooters and motorcycles are the same.  Scooters do not exist because you want to learn how to ride a two-wheeled vehicle, they exist because they are more ideally suited to city streets.  Large cargo capacity, easier in stop and go traffic,  more nimble.   Do not buy a scooter to learn how to ride a motorcycle, buy a scooter because that is the tool you need.    Okay, so what do I do to learn?  Take an MSF course.  This is the required course for learning to ride in many countries and states.  You have to seek it out and it is usually administered by a private entity.  They will teach you to things that are important:  how to make slow tight turns, how to ride in congestion with a bunch of other bikes, how to drive over obstacles.  Basically it is a confidence building exercise.  The biggest part of riding in having confidence in your skills, but you have to develop them first.  Even if you've been riding forever, the MSF will complete you.  After completing the MSF you will officially be qualified to pilot a motorcycle under 20 miles per hour in a parking lot.     On the confidence thing and crashes:  it doesn't matter if a car teleported out of the sky and lands on you, it is always YOUR fault.   This is all cliched advice, but it matters:   no matter what happens, if another vehicle hits you they will ""SMIDSY"" you.  They will tell the police they didn't see you and you came out of no where, and the only other person they can question is your bleeding body.  Ride like you are invisible.  Have your head on a swivel and watch everything.  Use your mirrors, and if they suck improve them.    More on crashes:  the majority of motorcycle crashes are single vehicle crashes.  That is to say that the rider fucked up somehow.  The only way to avoid them is to ride within your abilities, your bike's abilities, and within your sight line.  Gravel in the road, for example, takes out a lot of riders.  ""But it wasn't his fault.""  Of course it was.  Everything is always your fault and you should ride as such, because the only person who is going to get you out a bad situation is yourself.  The hand of god is not going to swoop down and save you, you are on your own.      Motorcycling:  Do not choose to buy a 2-wheeled vehicle to save gas or money.  Plenty of 3 and 4 banger cages out there for cheap that are much more capable and will even do more than 35mph, unlike many scooters.  Ride motorcycles and scooters for freedom.  Ride a bike because you love fresh air and sunshine or don't care if its raining.  Motorcycling is an art that you practice.  It is a way to connect your mind with a machine.   If you ride a motorcycle, ride one because you always knew you wanted to, not because some asshole on the internet said it would save money.   Cowards are not welcome on motorcycles;  fear is okay fear is healthy, but if you ever panicked in any other activity don't ride a bike because if you panic, you can die.        Gear:  Gear is awesome.  A good helmet can save your brain and face.   A good jacket and pants can keep more skin on you in a crash.  Boots and gloves can keep fingers and toes attached.   You know what almost none of that stuff is going to do?  Stop you from breaking a bone.  Think I'm lying?  Read /r/motorcycles or /r/calamariracerteam.   Almost anyone who broke a bone in a crash was likely wearing good gear.   Fo' real.   I have an 700$ jacket and 500$ pants,  I have MX boots and gloves and all that shit.  If I do something that can break a femur, I will break a femur.   The best I can hope for is to not shatter a pelvis or puncture my spine, that is all.  Moto armor is flexible, unless you done a suit of armor the best thing to do is not crash.    I would at a minimum get a jack of some kind, pants, over the ankle boots, gloves, and a DOT helmet.  Snell is nice but really, don't listen to the gear whores.  If you crash and the crash is enough to hurt you, you're still getting hurt. Expensive gear is not a replacement for good riding.      I might come back and expand upon this post a little later if it isn't downvoted to hell.  I want to make sure my negatives and positives about motorcycling are balanced.  I want people to ride if they want to ride, but I don't want people to ride who are on the fence about it.     Source:  been riding for 15 years of my 30 year life.  Started on 4-wheelers (lethal) and dirt bikes.  First 'street' bike was an XT225, moved onto a KLE650, now have an R1200GSA.  My current bike has more than 100 horsepower. I ride 70% dense city proper, 25% rural, and 5% offroad.  I often take trips where I am in the saddle for 12+ hrs at a time (not an exaggeration in Texas).  I am ""M"" licensed, insured, and registered.  I also perform all my own maintenance and upgrades.  I never want to tell anyone how to ride if they ride, its on them.  I am also trying not full of my self here, I just want to let you know the extent of my experience and that I'm not just a keyboard warrior, I do ride."

Just started this summer again and the biggest thing I always notice about going back is how I'm happy when I drive places. When was the last time you were happy with just the act of driving? I don't hate driving, and I'm not a car person, but just driving on a motorcycle is very calming to me. I feel closer to driving and more in control. Driving a car feels very on-rails, but a motorcycle feels free. Normally I like staying home and am introverted as well, but if I can take my motorcycle suddenly I look for every chance I can go on a drive, even better if it's about an hour away on the highway. I visit relatives more and that leads to better feelings all around."
lifehacks,3bpcgw,YouBWrong,10,Wed Jul 1 07:14:30 2015 UTC,"Seriously! My motorcycle was my first vehicle for three years. But after it got stolen, my boss convinced me otherwise, so I caved in and bought a car. Luckily, it's a Miata so in some ways it's a lot like my Ninja but it's just not the same.   I think about selling it for a bike all the time. I loved going on the carpool ramp from the 91 W to the 57 N - that feels like the drop at the beginning of a roller coaster. And I once had this amazing ride through a lightning storm off the 405 N where you could see lighting hit a few blocks away from the freeway. I don't think anything can compare. Even the simple things like camping, grocery shopping, and going through a drive thru were all an adventure.   And the community! Rider's code anyone? You don't really see car drivers stop for other drivers on the road, but you'll often see several riders waiting around one rider for a tow truck. I remember my first accident where I rode through fresh rain, hydroplaned and hit an island in the middle of the road. So many people came running to the middle of the street to help pick up my bike that, to this day, I am thankful and speechless. Not one person criticized my riding. They just told me to watch out for the edges of the lanes for oil and taught me a few tips here and there, put my bike back together for me and made sure I took off okay.  I did have one major accident that required an ACL/MCL repair in my right knee, but that was a rookie mistake on my part. (Hit gravel turning downhill, bike fell on my knee and dragged me down almost an entire block.) Gear saved my leg. No scrapes or cuts, just some bruising from my tear.

Not to mention rain etc.  I mean just the cost of the Scooter, Helmet, Riding gear etc. would probably take years to even break even since I only save ~40 a month.

lifehacks,3bpcgw,Romald_Thumbkin,3,Wed Jul 1 16:04:42 2015 UTC,"Anyway, I don't understand why people are so worried about how they look on a scooter at all. Any friend or potential SO who would judge you on your transportation isn't worth your time anyway.   You're missing the point.  Scooters are simply not as good as a motorcycle.  Scooters have tiny engines, poor handling and poor brakes.  When you're on two wheels, you need every advantage you can get.  Idiot drivers will not notice you whether you are on a motorcycle or scooter.  So pick the safer option, which is a motorcycle.  Motorcycles are often significantly faster than cars.  That gives you an advantage.  Some motorcycles handle really well, another advantage.  Some motorcycles have fantastic brakes, yet another advantage.  Scooters have none of those.  You are very vulnerable on two wheels, so, again, take every advantage you can get.  I'm a biker and a strong believer in ATGATT.  That is, all the gear all the time.  Full-face helmet, armored jacked and pants, motorcycle boots and motorcycle gloves.  Those will save your bacon in an accident.  But you don't want to get into an accident in the first place, which is why you want the advantages of a real motorcycle.  Licensing wasn't bad.  It was actually a lot of fun.  I took a two day course in California.  First, you go to a classroom where you'll learn a lot and see some good videos.  The next day is a full day of riding on a closed course.  It was awesome and I'd do it again.  Second, smaller bikes aren't that expensive.  You can get something used like a Ninja 250 or Buell Blast for the same price as a scooter, but they're so much better."

lifehacks,3bpcgw,AyoJake,14,Wed Jul 1 12:08:28 2015 UTC,"I hate the perceived notion that having a scooter means you don't have to wear gear. A scooter affords the exact same amount of protection on the road as any other motorcycle: none. Please, if you decide to go this route invest in some gear, a full face helmet, gloves, and jacket at the least. Your scooter may only go 30 or 40mph but that is more than enough to cause some serious injuries. If you are saving a ton of money on gas then you should be able to budget buying gear.   People seem to think all the problems of a motorcycle disappear because they are riding a scooter or moped or Vespa. You should also look into a MSF course to learn about the dangers specific to riding a motorcycle."

lifehacks,3bpcgw,oliver_randolph,8,Wed Jul 1 05:14:13 2015 UTC,"Have you considered the possibility that the people at /r/motorcycles are right?  Scooters are more dangerous than motorcycles because they're not as fast as a bike or car, they don't handle well, and they have inferior brakes.  If you disagree with those then you have a problem with the laws of physics.  You need speed, braking and handling to stay away from potentially dangerous situations.  A moped leaves you vulnerable and without the advantages of a motorcycle.  Further, I don't think I've ever seen a moped rider fully geared up.  I see motorcyclists with proper protection, though."

lifehacks,3bpcgw,_franchize,3,Wed Jul 1 14:09:56 2015 UTC,"So I thought this sounded like a great idea but in real life it is not feasible. And here is why.  I bought a nice creamsicle honda metro a few years ago.  These little scooters get around 100 mpg.  The insurance was like $12 a month for full everything with a 200 deductible.  Sounds great, I know.   However these little things only get a max speed of around 36 mph.  and they dont accelerate very fast.  This made the scooter very dangerous to drive on any main road ways in the city I was in.  Zigzaging through residential streets all the way to work was ridiculous and time consuming.  (only 3 miles but would take 3x longer than if I drove)  I pretty much had to stay clear of all the main streets because people typically drive around 40. And with everyone trying to move over to the left lane to pass me on an already busy street- I was mostly just a hazard to other automobiles.    Even though my backpack was made of reflective material and I was on an orange moped, people almost hit me all the damn time.   Secondly there was other slight inconveniences.  I could only carry with me what would fit in a backpack.    When I would go to work in the morning it would be freezing to ride the moped even though it was in the 100s when I would get off.  So I would have to carry a jacket. So that took up half the backpack.  If I wanted to swing by a grocery store on my way home or run to a store for something, I was limited on what I could carry.   If I was on a time crunch to get to any place after work (i.e. school) the moped wouldn't work because it took too long to travel on it.    Also I could only ride it 7 months of the year, so I had to store it for the other months.  I had a friend with garage space, but that is also a pretty big inconvenience if you don't have that option.  I loved it, it was fun to ride.  but it was more a toy than a car replacement as I had hoped.  When I moved to a bigger city 2 years ago I sold it.    Here is a pic, I do miss riding it in the evenings. but it just wasn't appropriate for city driving.  (I made that fancy seat cover ;)  ) http://i.imgur.com/EEjYWsj.jpg"

A former coworker retired a couple years early to take care of his sick wife. He had a few hours to go for a ride on his bike on a beautiful afternoon. He pulled away from a light and a driver coming the other way lost control and struck him. If he had been driving a car, he'd have been upset at the damage. Instead we buried him.

lifehacks,3bt0by,sewsewsewyourcoat,2,Thu Jul 2 00:06:07 2015 UTC,"No, it's not. Every wire with current running through it creates an electric field. Coiling the wire can create a stronger electric field, as with a solenoid, but a few loops won't make enough difference to matter. Furthermore it makes no difference, in terms of magnetic field, whether the coil is topologically a knot or not. Since there's no big deal about having an extension cord crossing over itself on the floor (i.e., when you haven't completely stretched it out straight), there's no big deal about having it cross over itself in a simple knot."

Assuming you're not tying a tight not that will stress the cord and cause it to fail as a result, it's hard to see how that style of knot could cause it to overheat.   The cord dissipates heat due to electrical resistance, and where the cord crosses over itself that heat will be concentrated to some extent. But the amount of heat dissipation isn't enough that just having the cord crossing over itself on the floor would be a hazard, so how could the cord crossing over itself in the form of a knot be any worse?"

lifehacks,3bntal,perrywhitepressonly,28,Thu Jul 2 16:24:57 2015 UTC,"this is a terrific life hack on how to ruin your nail polish!  Seriously, NEVER EVER do this unless you actually want to make your nail polish unusable.    If you have too thick, gloopy nail polish - even if it is completely dried up like a rock - simply add Polish Thinner to the bottle and shake vigorously.  My bottle of OPI thinner cost me approx $5 and will last me for years.  Goopy polish typically needs 3 drops, while my completely dried out bottle of OPI Ponce de Leon (from the early 90's?) took 1/2 teaspoon to come back to life, good as new.  With polish thinner, nail polish is forever."
lifehacks,3bntal,hazeldazeI,12,Wed Jul 1 00:45:27 2015 UTC,NO NO NO NO! What you need is nail polish THINNER.  Thinner is NOT the same as acetone. Acetone breaks down the bonds that hold nail polish together. Thinner is made replace the ingredients in nail polish that evaporate quickly (which is what lead it to be goopy in the first place) and will NOT damage the polish itself.

lifehacks,3bq17k,jethroisnowhere,3,Wed Jul 1 05:47:28 2015 UTC,"I had to deal with something similar a few months ago when a skunk spayed right outside my back door.  The smell was so bad it woke me up and I was all the way in the back out the house with the door closes.  Not only did it spray right by the door it sprayed because my dog got too close and she was hit right in the middle of the top of her head.     So to get the smell out of the house the only thing that worked for is was airing it out.  Open any doors and windows you can and turn on some fans.  The fans are importand as you want to keep the air circulating so the spray smell doesn't settle and set in.  If anything got sprayed that is fabric, like towels or blankets or something put it in water with vinegar and dish soap.  If any clothing got sprayed was those in hot water with detergent right away,  if you have any air filters in the room you may want to change them after running the dad for a bit as the smell can settle into them.    There isn't much else really, other than air freshener, the kind with deodorizer a work best.  Oh, anything that got sprayed that can be moved easily you can put outside once the sun is up, the untraveled Rays will actually help break down the smell when exposed.    And last thing, be thankful you don't have a dog that got hit in the head...it took more than a month for the smell on her to completely go away even though we bathed her immediately after.   You have my sympathies for going through this, it really really sucks ass to deal with that awful smell.  I hope whatever you try works!"

Finally, at wits end, I looked online.  At janitorial supply stores and online, they have Skunk Bombs (cheap considering how much I'd already spent).  I went and got one, set it of and viola.....smell gone!    They are aerosols that you set off and leave the house after sealing windows, doors and such.  Take pets out of the house!

Now what happened when it exploded was that the metal container could no longer hold the pressure. But that doesn't mean that all of them would explode in those circumstances.   Just get one with a thicker metal lining and preferably one that is thin and long. Keep it under the driver's seat and you should be fine."

Probably twice as much unless you cut it with a rotary moeer first.They can't handle taking off a lot of grass at once. It's a finishing mower.

Even with a huge lawn mower I have and me directing it, something gets stuck once in a while and completely destroys the blades. It does seem to come with replacement blades but that means you have to keep dealing with that more than you normally would since it will run over objects more and get damaged. Then it's the fact that you have something worth $2400 just running around by itself outside and even though it has an alarm it seems very easy to steal. It's basically an overpriced Roomba at this point. Then it's the fact that it's only meant for a small yard, up to about 4000 square feet when they're showing it on what seems to be a huge field. Then it's the annoyance factor: this thing's going to be continuously mowing. Then it's ""quiet"" but it's up to 60-63 dBa which is as loud as someone talking to you. So it's like someone walking around your yard squealing or whatever noise it makes.  I don't know, I guess it's between the people who prefer a Roomba or vacuuming an hour or two every month."

lifehacks,3bf8o2,steak21,23,Sun Jun 28 22:10:41 2015 UTC,"Many things, though you're probably not going to die doing it.   1) Lawnmowers have a self-shutoff mechanism, usually on the handlebar of pushers and the seat of riders, that stops the engine if you let go or get up. This is the primary safety device, ensuring that you don't cut yourself up if something gets out of control. This guy appears to have disabled that on the pushers (probably by just tying down the rod). So, whereas normal lawnmowers will not function if you stop, get up, walk to investigate something, drop your beer, etc, this one keeps going.   2) The gif shows a flat lawn with easy turns, but a small hill, indent, rock, or mistaken turn could send one of those peripheral mowers flying (without shutting down like normal), potentially injuring the operator or a bystander.  3) It isn't totally clear how the pushers are attached, but it looks like running into a tree/poll or ""snagging"" one would result in the same problem as above. All it takes is tipping a push mower on the side a bit and you have a huge deadly spinning metal blade out in the open.   4) Again from quick visual inspection, it looks like in order to turn the whole thing on or off, you need to walk around near the blades of two of the (running) mowers. For example to turn off, you'd need to stop the rider, step off it - into or near the grass exhaust that can easily kick up rocks/etc - and then walk around to the other two to manually stop them.  Of course if you're careful this might be fine, but lawnmowers are engineered to prevent injury - because a ton of people have been injured - and this circumvents some of those safety mechanisms."

lifehacks,3bc5a3,Kautkto,3,Sun Jun 28 01:56:19 2015 UTC,"I agree, but the puritan religious roots of this country is primary reason that alcohol was banned in the first place.  Im not saying it out of malice towards religion, but based on historical fact.  ""Prohibition in the United States was a nationwide constitutional ban on the sale, production, importation, and transportation of alcoholic beverages that remained in place from 1920 to 1933. It was promoted by the ""dry"" crusaders, a movement led by rural Protestants and social Progressives in the Democratic and Republican parties, and was coordinated by the Anti-Saloon League, and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Prohibition was mandated under the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Enabling legislation, known as the Volstead Act, set down the rules for enforcing the ban and defined the types of alcoholic beverages that were prohibited. For example, religious uses of wine were allowed.""  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States"

""Because religion"" is a pretty broad damned explanation and doesn't really touch on the actual reasons why fundamentalist Christians have had such a strong hold on legislature in the U.S.   It's most often misinterpretation of what Christians are supposed to believe that ended up being the basis for laws that to most people (including other Christians) make absolutely no sense.  To be fair, Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Sikhism, etc, have absolutely nothing to do with why certain puritanical laws were passed in the U.S.  So to blame ""religion"" as the cause is really, really , really inaccurate and makes you sound like you have an agenda.

lifehacks,3b9xmx,Limonhed,30,Sat Jun 27 10:31:10 2015 UTC,"Kind of reminds me of old wired telephone cords before the coiled cord - probably from before most readers (including me) were born. Back when they were THE phone company, Ma Bell (Bell Telephone Company) actually did some research to find why handset cords got twisted. What they learned was most users picked up the phone with their right hand, placed it to their right ear and said ""Hello"". Then, if the conversation went on for more then about 30 seconds - OR the person needed to do something with their right hand such as write something, they switched the phone to their left hand and left ear. Putting a half twist in the cord. Then typically hung up using the left hand. After many phone calls, all of those half twists in the same direction added up. This was before the advent of the modular RJ-22 type plug in cord and the handset was permanently connected to the base. Their recommended solution - Hold the base set up, and allow the handset to dangle and untwist itself.  My guess is you are doing something similar - my recommendations, either STOP doing that, OR use the Bell Telephone solution from the 1940s. In the 1980s someone made a 3rd party RJ-22 swivel attachment you could plug into your handset cord to prevent that - You didn't show what kind of connector was on that cord so I don't know if there is something like that for yours.  If it is a wired telephone headset, what you want is an RJ-22 swivel AKA phone cord detangler AKA Cord spinner - google it."

Usually when I feel this way, it's either because my body is telling me something (getting sick, need sleep, long-term unrecognized stress) or because my brain is gushing negatives.  I heard once that the brain is like a librarian (I guess like google now), send the librarian for a very general topic and get tons of results.  Send your mind to one bad-memory/unhelpful thought and the floodgates are open, often accompanied by cognitive distortions.   I have this list posted in two places in my house. When I start to feel really shitty, I try to pay attention to what I'm thinking, and then go look at the list (I also have it saved on my phone).   So the 'nothing good happens to me' probably contains multiple distortions, but the first that come to my mind:  A) black & white thinking (always, never, nothing, everything) #2 on list  B- personalization (this horrible thunderstorm is happening to ME, not just in general to everyone getting wet) #6 on list  C) Control fallacy (there are two types) #7 on the list  I hope this helps in some way. It has helped me greatly when my thoughts start to turn very dark.

lifehacks,3ayjc8,clungelunger,2,Thu Jun 25 00:40:01 2015 UTC,"ooh, storytime! I swear it's relevant.   Many years ago I lived in an apartment that backed up to a very lightly traveled street. Every other Saturday morning the woman that lived above me (older, wealthy, several poodles with bedazzled collars, etc) would toss a garden hose out of her apartment, over my little ground floor back yard, and onto the little street where she would wash her mercedes with a kitchen sponge. There were plenty of DIY car washes nearby, but this was her preferred method. So early one saturday morning I blearily go to pee and feel something drip on my head. I look up and see that my bathroom ceiling is completely engorged with water and the layers of 30 year old paint are holding it all up like a giant water balloon that was just about to... burst on my head. Yep. Soaked. We run upstairs thinking the old woman has died in the shower and call 911 and apartment management when she doesn't answer the door. About 30 minutes later she pulls up to the back street to wash her car and there's no water pressure waiting for her. She had gone to run errands after hooking up her hose and turning the water on. The sprayer nozzle was apparently stronger than her bathroom fixture and the pressure built up enough to break the faucet and flood her bathroom (and mine).   Moral of the story: If you put a hose on a faucet DO NOT EVER put a sprayer nozzle on it or shit will break and your usually friendly downstairs neighbor will want to murder you. :)"

I'd say your best bet here would be to put the speaker in to a cheap setup like this, rig the lid so that it has some offset from the tub leaving a gap around the edge for sound to escape (edit: glue pool noodle scraps in the corners, leaving about an inch clearance?), and use some leftover bits of pool noodle to create an area where the speaker itself won't be sitting on the bottom of the tub (so the speaker won't be sitting in any incidental water that gets in).  If you then bought a little window screening and hot-glued it to the outside of the lid draping down (so any water spray that hits it doesn't just end up running down and in to the container) that might be the best you're going to do on the cheap.  Overall cost is a pool noodle, a plastic container, a bit of rope, some hot glue, and the screen.  If you have the container already, it ought not cost more than about $20."

lifehacks,3au00a,piratesarghh,4,Tue Jun 23 14:27:07 2015 UTC,Keep in mind in today's age of leased or financed phones this type of service isn't as useful. Due to the fact that changes in terms don't exempt you from having to pay the full balance of your phone immediately upon terminating service.
lifehacks,3au00a,XmentalX,3,Tue Jun 23 22:26:44 2015 UTC,"Incorrect. Separating the device and the service was the carriers's sleight of hand intended to accomplish exactly what you have described. They did this by creating two separate legal entities, one might be Carrier Device Company LLC and the other Carrier Service Company LLC. This way, so the carriers thought, when a customer has a legitimate issue with getting, let's say, really shitty service, the Device Company's interest and rights to still receive the full balance of the device, despite the device being nearly unusable, let's say, on the Service Company's network, will be preserved. Turns out, though, courts have seen right through that trick and have ruled in favor of consumers being able to get out of device contracts when there are service issues or breaches to either the Device Company or Service Company's contracts, because, let's be honest, they're two different puppets, yes, but their strings are pulled by one puppet master."
lifehacks,3au00a,XmentalX,3,Wed Jun 24 12:58:45 2015 UTC,I would like to see evidence of this because for example on T-Mobile they consider it 0% financing of the device not a contract and I would be surprised to see a court ruling a service issue exempts one from paying back a financed item
lifehacks,3au00a,XmentalX,2,Wed Jun 24 14:12:35 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that T-Mobile is the same company whose commercials say ""we'll pay your early termination fees,"" when that is not actually the case. When you switch to T-Mobile, hoping they will pay your fees, you discover that you actually have to pay your fees out of pocket and then submit a rebate request to T-Mobile. You then wait ~3 months before receiving a check card for the amount you came out of pocket for. This is why the attorney general of Washington state sued T-Mobile for false advertising. When a friend tells you, ""I will pay for your dinner tonight,"" when the bill comes, this does not usually mean that your friend expects you to actually pay the bill that night and then submit a rebate request to him to be processed three months later. Point is: the horse's mouth is not a trustworthy source if the question is whether or not the horse is trustworthy."
lifehacks,3au00a,XmentalX,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:43:05 2015 UTC,You are dodging my question. Let's see some items to support your claims if there are court cases proving it you should be able to back up what you are saying. I made no mention of the etf reimbursement because I am quite familiar of its shortcomings I just made mention that you can't use contract changes to cancel what you owe on a T-Mobile device.
lifehacks,3au00a,NickelobUltra,-2,Wed Jun 24 16:32:53 2015 UTC,"I'm not dodging your question. I made two points in response. 1) If you stop paying your monthly device payments, what would happen? Absent some sort of contractual breach on T-Mobile's side, T-Mobile would try to make you pay. On what grounds? The ""contract"" you signed that outlined the terms of financing. In other words, a finance contract is a contract, although it's for a different consideration than a service contract. Thus, anyone who says that a contract to finance a device is not a contract is probably not qualified to have this conversation. A contract is a contract, and T-Mobile, despite their slick commercials that you appear to believe, still requires contracts. 2) You are asking for evidence of court rulings that strike down the artificial separation between Service Company and Device Company, and I am simply telling you no, because, for me, being in the business, this info is hard to come by and, since I've come by it, I'm not itching to give it away--consider it proprietary, my secret for now. They exist, whether I show you evidence or not. Thanks for asking the question, though, because this is a nuanced point that many people are misinformed about."
lifehacks,3au00a,sitric28,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:37:09 2015 UTC,Financing on any item is different than a service contract for service which is where my point comes from you can't get out of device financing due to service contract changes.

lifehacks,3aq1wc,OregonTrailSurvivor,9,Mon Jun 22 23:14:28 2015 UTC,Google ITA Matrix indexes more flights and has more search options (like choosing the source country which can impact prices). Google Flights also doesn't include some smaller airlines. Use the search sites as guidelines but always check prices directly on the airline's website as well as well as sites like Priceline. Look up discount airlines for your destination on Wikipedia or on google and go to the source. Also use sites like skyscanner or kayak to set up price alerts and monitor currency fluctuations that can save you money.

So in trying to save time by having a small lay over  added 6 extra hours (and a great deal more stress) to my flight. Now I insist on 2+ hour lay overs
lifehacks,3aq1wc,dandysan,5,Tue Jun 23 02:06:59 2015 UTC,As a poor college kid traveling from the US to Europe I had a couple flights with 4-6 hour layovers meaning I spent a lot of multi-day travelling while sleeping in airports.

Now that I have a big boy job I think I'm going to pay a bit more for some direct flights. I see the appeal.

lifehacks,3aq1wc,OnTheEveOfWar,4,Mon Jun 22 19:42:27 2015 UTC,"Former airline revenue management analyst here: One thing I would take exception with is the ""group"" bloc buying tactic. The reason you wouldn't get the best price as a group is because the airline industry has what's referred to as Fare Buckets. These buckets vary in price, restrictions and conditions, and dates when they can be purchased.  For a simple example (they get infinitely more complex). Let's take three buckets  Y - Q - T   Y would be the full fare in coach, unrestricted, refundable any time, and can be purchased at any point Q would be mid-tier, some restrictions, may be refundable most likely not,  T would be the lowest fare (fare sale), most restrictions, and typically only available in a small window   When building out the revenue model for a flight you would place so many tickets in Y, so many in D, and so many in T. In our example, let's say we are purchasing 10 tickets. If there are only 2 in T then it will take you to the higher fare bucket - Q in this case, if its available. That said, if you go to a travel agent and you are buying a number of tickets they MAY have access to what's known as opaque fares. Opaque fares are typically international flights where the airline will not publish the rate but in the desire to fill seats early will offer them to tour operators and agents. You as a consumer would typically see these as a ""all-in"" vacation pricing. That said, they are not nearly as prevalent today as Hotwire.com, Priceline.com and others have scooped this inventory and now sell it on behalf of the airlines."

lifehacks,3aq1wc,siraisy,2,Tue Jun 23 14:44:57 2015 UTC,"Good tips, but to expand: A guide from a very frequent flier on how to get the best flight for you in terms of not just cost, but overall value:  Consider all costs  Sure, you found a great flight on Spirit or Ryanair. And you're a savvy traveler, you've heard all the things about fees for luggage, exit row seats and other things you don't need.   However, don't forget things like fees for a carry-on (your budget airline may have smaller limits than you're used to), fees for getting a printed boarding pass in the airport or exorbitant fees for changing your ticket, should something come up.  Also, have you considered that your transportation to that low-cost airport will be expensive and/or time consuming? That whatever you buy airside or onboard will be extremely marked-up? That you may be flying with a carrier with no partner airlines - if you're delayed and you land later than the last bus from your out-of-the-way destination airport, a taxi will set you back several dollars more?  Consider your value  Sure, staying over on a Saturday reduces cost on a round-trip ticket. However, if you're going to work Monday morning, it may not be best value to arrive home late on a Sunday. Sometimes, it's just not worth screwing up your whole week to save $50 on airfare.  Also, don't fall in love with a price tag on a computer screen. Once you're lodged into 54E in the middle-middle seat of a 767 with a 2-5-2 configuration, you'd wish you'd forked out hundred dollars to be in the Economy+ seat riiight there in front of you. Remember the rule: if your flight is long enough to involve more than one meal, it's long enough for you to do whatever you can to fly a better class than coach.  However ... that's not always an option, fear not:   Get the good seats. Also in Steerage. Pay for them.  Whatever you have to do to pre-book your seat, do it. Use seatguru.com to find out exactly what type of flight you're on and use the information to your advantage. Pre-booking a seat, even at a small(ish) cost, is usually good value.   There's a lot of difference between being in your preferred aisle/window seat in the side row with just you and your seatmate - maybe with extra legroom if you can snag an exit row - and then being in the dreaded middle seat, in the back row, next to the lavatories. Except, usually, the price. Because you pay the same for your coach ticket at purchase.   On international flights, forward is always better. Yes it is.  Remember the line from boarding? Yeah, it's also going to be in immigration when you land. Time to exit JFK terminal 7 from a business seat? 10 minutes, if you're the only plane landing from LHR at that time. Time to get out from a coach seat? Up to 90 minutes.  So, even if you're still flying coach: the difference between seat 29A and 49A can be half an hour extra in line. Even if 29A isn't a premium seat compared to 49A, it's still a motherf'ing premium seat when you exit the aircraft. So long, suckas!.  Before you buy premium seats, check the load  Frequent flier sites (don't want to plug, search for 'em) have several members with subscriptions to Expertflyer.com that let you see exactly how many tickets are sold on a given flight. With experience, we learn to gauge pretty much if a flight will be full or not. Ask them to help you, if you're just on that once-a-year flight. PM me if you need help with this.   Why?   Because getting four seats to yourself in coach is way better than anything you can get from an Economy+ seat. Generally, though, airlines are getting better at filling up capacity ... but not always. On my short flights for work on smaller planes, a colleague and I describe this as The Perfect 18 - you have nobody in your row of three, nobody in the aisle across of 3 and nobody in the back, front, diagonal forward or backward. The Perfect 18 (seats, of which you occupy 1 with all the space and privacy in the world).  I want to splurge  Yes you do! I've never looked back since I learned you could actually lie down for a good sleep on flights. Get into the miles collection game, but for everyone: remember that we business fliers have July/August off. As we're speaking, you can get Business class (lie-flat bed, champagne upon boarding, the whole shenanigans) for under $2,000 between the US and Europe in July. Round-trip. What a perfect way to start and end a week in Paris, huh?  In summary  Flying is fun. And while your destination is surely the goal of flying, you're getting a lot more vacation out of it if you make your flying time enjoyable as well. That may be worth a few bucks ..."

Honestly the best thing is to just do as much shopping around as you can. A few tips:  Flight comparison sites are an awesome place to start. www.skyscanner.net is my favourite. Also, as the album said, try to avoid booking in bulk if theres a group of you. Split the group into smaller groups of no more than 3. Adding to that, if you the price on one airline website rises, try disabling cookies or just trying again later. Many sites will track that youve been on there and adjust the prices to make people ""panic buy"" before they rise again.  Finally, and sorry if this seems an obvious one, book as far in advance as you can.   Happy travels !"

lifehacks,3aq1wc,essjay2009,4,Tue Jun 23 10:55:31 2015 UTC,"Related to this (I don't believe your tip will work in most cases) is to search national airlines that fly routes that aren't from their hub. For example, you can get cheap British Airways flights by flying out of Dublin or Amsterdam (not Heathrow or Gatwick). Sometimes those flights will connect through London, but still be cheaper.  I'm flying to Vegas next week from the UK. By going from Dublin it's costing me £2k for ""Upper Class"" (Virgin Atlantic's version of business class) where going through Heathrow or Gatwick would have cost £8k. It's the same flight (from Gatwick onwards) but with an extra leg yet it's costing 25% as much! And seeing as I'm not based in London, it's just as much hassle for me to fly in to Dublin as it is to either drive or catch a train to London and the transfer in London is fine as you can just have a couple of drinks in the lounge."
lifehacks,3aq1wc,Ohuma,0,Tue Jun 23 14:00:53 2015 UTC,"That may be, because the hub has much more overhead than a stop.  On stops, some people disembark, and the airline would much rather have full seats for the rest of the route.   Good tip if you can!"

It takes 30 seconds (if that) to unlock a padlock via raking and it takes less than an hour to learn. Pretty scary considering how much we rely on locks.

I mean, google already returns searches containing other words than the exact terms... what would a wildcard do? The hyphen in #7 is doing precisely nothing. I assume they're showing off that it's finding ""dessert recipes without sugar"" (right?) but the hyphen needs to be directly before a word to exclude it. Not to mention that if they excluded dessert recipes that so much as mentioned sugar, they'd probably be missing the low-sugar ones since they're the ones that would specifically mention the word.... There's no evidence that #21 is actually restricting the search to laptops in the stated price range - google has just picked up on ""dell laptop"" as a shopping term and fed the entire query into the shopping results. (a quick check gets me a $600 laptop as the second shopping result if I use that exact query, so... yeah) Finally, the last image contains a couple of errors. Google already searches related words (like ""university"" when you searched ""college""), without needing a tilde. Adding one (at least to a single-word search) doesn't appear to affect the results. Once again, the "".."" format doesn't specify a range of dates. Google can search in a time range, but that's through the ""search tools"" menu under the input field.

lifehacks,3alhqj,GreatGeak,20,Sun Jun 21 13:36:50 2015 UTC,"Yes they do.  His comment is the only thing that comes up because it's the only case where this specific sequence of words is found.  Try it with a different query, you'll see that it works."

It was just used incorrectly in OP's post. https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/2466433?hl=en  It is useful when you're use quotes to specify an exact phrase but substitute out for one or more words.

lifehacks,3alhqj,xyroclast,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:22:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think google ever used asterisks as wildcards. Some of these tips seem completely made up, based on assumptions from other search engines."

lifehacks,3alhqj,nickk808,2,Sun Jun 21 12:20:11 2015 UTC,You can also get download times. Handy for steam downloads and stuff. For example say you're downloading GTA V. You would google 60GB/55mbps. And it would tell you the time.

I work in IT, and I've definitely learned that 90% of my job is just knowing how to look things up. There's no way I could know everything about every computer, but when you know how to most quickly find a detail from the a you'd expect to find it on, it's enough of a time saver that it translates to dollars saved for the client.  In a casual and professional setting, I've found it extremely useful for things like product searches on websites with a poor search function built in, or just to minimize clicks. When I need to find a 50 foot HDMI cable in black on Monoprice.com, I can just open Chrome, click the navigation bar, and type ""50 foot HDMI black site:Monoprice.com"" and get it in the first three hits, easily. This also, of course, lets you circumvent Reddit's still-terribad search system.  I didn't know about the "".."" trick before (to search a range of numbers), and could've used it in the past, especially when trying to find support documentation for older technology named the same as something new, e.g. ""MacBook"". Now I don't have to do searches like ""MacBook -2012 -2013 -2014"" to get the right year models."

lifehacks,3akznp,sexualpotato,17,Sun Jun 21 05:49:58 2015 UTC,Your backpack should be carried mostly with your hips. The shoulder straps are just to keep the pack in that vertical position. Your hips and legs can carry so much more for much longer than your shoulders and core.

lifehacks,3akznp,maybe-tomorrow,3,Sun Jun 21 10:02:24 2015 UTC,"So I assume not much experience. 10 miles in three days should be easy.  Do you have a water filter though because you can not carry that much water. Depending on the heat you could go through 4-5 litres a day easily. If it is buggy, bring a bug net for your head. You pack should weigh about a quarter of your weight at most. Ideally much less. In most situations you will need a camping mattress for warmth. Bring a few lighters to start fires. Don't mess with flint or fire rods even though it sounds fun. Make sure the fires are really really out before going to bed. If you are in bear country, have a bear bell. You may also consider bear mace or a bear banger. Put everything in your pack or have it tightly tied to the outside. Things that swing as you walk can really fuck up your gait and soon your body. Sleeping bag temperature ratings lie. Know how cold it is going to get where you are at night (not the nearest town where it will likely be warmer) and be sure to have an appropriate bag."

Another one: don't be afraid to eat bugs  Another one: you can melt ice into a lens and start a fire with that lens.   Another one: take your time and think. Don't get injured (even blisters can get ugly) and take inventory of your belongings.   Another one: learn some simple traps. My favorite one: Dig a hole next to a pond and put bait in the water. Where the pond water fills into the hole, put some sharpened sticks facing inwards. Fish will swim into the hole and can't escape. Come back hours later to a fresh fish meal.   Another: make a shelter and make a fire. Do people know you are missing? Have wet branches ready to throw into the fire. I've flown a plane and smoke is easy to see from the sky.

Even fucking spies have a handler that knows where and when to expect them. Dont just let your wife know either.  If you're going to a National Park or something perhaps stop by a ranger station and let them know what you're up to.   Most of the time they will do a quick on the spot check ""Do you have a cell phone? What's the number? Who else knows you are out here? Here's a printout of the weather forecast for the next few days.""  If you're going camping or outdoors for a few days, waterproof your backpack.   It is pretty simple.  In the Army we called them ""wet weather bags"" which are essentially just rubber bags you can put your stuff into and then pack into your backpack.  A plus to this is that if you properly seal your wet weather bag your backpack is going to float. Oral rehydration salts and iodine tablets, (in the event that you are unable to bring water to a boil) iodine cleans the water and then the oral rehydration salts help replenish electrolytes and whatnot.  Wooden matches.  Dry wooden matches.  fit as many as you can into any kind of small container.  put that container into a ziplock bag and keep it on your person (meaning on you). it also wouldn't hurt to put about a square inch of sandpaper inside the ziplock back to ensure you have a striking surface.  The ability to build a shelter.  It can be as simple as a poncho draped over a couple branches...but if you start getting wet during the day you are going to get cold when night comes.   Always pack a fresh pair of slacks and a top...shitloads of socks. If you are already wet, dont change until you are perhaps bedding down for the night or it stops raining/snowing.  If you have wet material on a sunny day, take a few minutes to lay your shit out and let it dry.  Keep dry.  You must also protect yourself from the sun.  I prefer to just wear a long sleeve and pants with a hat (he's bald) than to put on sunscreen.  Also an extra pair of shoes, those are the holy grail, they must be kept dry."

It's less expensive, and is better for the environment because you can drink the water in the morning, rather than merely throwing your chemical heating pads in the garbage.  In cold weather, it also helps to assure that your water bottle won't freeze overnight.     If your hands are getting cold while sitting in front of a fire, you are underdressed. Gloves work even better than chemical heating pads, and are a lot cheaper and simpler.  It should also be noted that chemical heating pads don't actually give off enough heat to dry wet boots, other than superficially.

lifehacks,3afgfk,meccanexus,1 point,Sat Jun 20 11:01:50 2015 UTC,"Maybe not the route that casual campers want to go but it falls under survival tips.  If you're stuck and need the warmth gather some large (preferably flat) stones around your fire pit so they gather a lot of warmth.  Before you sleep bury them just under where you'll be sleeping.  This will warm the ground and keep it (for a while at least) from being so cold that it's sapping away your heat.  Casual camping and time to prep, definitely invest in a good sleeping bag.  Also a camp mat or a cot.  The primary concern isn't making the ground comfortable it's creating insulation between you and the ground so it can't sap heat.  Worst case scenario you can build a couple layers of leaves or even pine boughs to create insulation beneath you (though if it's autumn and they're deciduous leaves you may have to deal with crackling leaves all night every time you shift position)  There's also debate on whether you should sleep with or without all your clothes.  I've found that with a bad sleeping bag you should wear everything as you're creating layers.  With a very good sleeping bag stripping down helps as the bag is keeping in most of your warmth and clothing prevents the air from circulating so some areas are warm and some are cold.  Either way you want clean, dry clothes and you want to avoid overheating to the point you're sweating.  Moisture will evaporate causing you to cool even faster."

lifehacks,3a5xhf,lazespud2,-24,Thu Jun 18 14:36:45 2015 UTC,Good way to get your epi-pen stolen by a stranger. Why not just put your debit card pin on there too?  EDIT: You guys...smdh
lifehacks,3a5xhf,nysecret,18,Wed Jun 17 17:27:44 2015 UTC,"Wait, so you're unconscious, in anaphylactic shock, and your concern is that someone will steal your epipen?  If you're concerned about them stealing something, it should be your phone and wallet."
lifehacks,3a5xhf,duhhuh,7,Wed Jun 17 17:34:40 2015 UTC,"Um, I'd much rather be alive with the possibility of my epipen being stolen, than dead because I was unconscious from an allergy attack, with my epipen safe in my pocket, fully safe from thieves, while I die because someone has no clue what's wrong with me.  Honestly I don't understand the logic of your statement. Basically you are positing the following scenario if I understand you correctly:  I have an anaphylactic reaction and can't breath and fall unconscious quickly because my throat constricts. Some finds me quickly, and sees the lock screen on my phone. Because they are a bad guy, their first thought it... oh, lets steal this guy's epi-pen.  I guess that's possible, but if I'm unconscious and didn't have the notice on my lock screen (or the med-alert bracelet around my wrist), and a ""bad guy"" happens upon me, doesn't it stand to reason they are gonna search me for stuff to steal regardless as to whether I have some notice on my lock screen? You are saying somehow that lock screen is going to be the tipping point that persuades them to look deeper into my stuff to steal that magical epipen? And it the notice WASN'T there they would do what, exactly?  Epi-pens are like 100 bucks each. Not inconsequential in cost, but not particularly expensive. I'd much rather provide info for random people to save my life than worry about a risk of theft that I honestly don't even understand.  I suppose it might exist but I have never heard of any black market for epi-pens. They aren't oxycotin for god's sake."

lifehacks,3a5xhf,veggie151,102,Thu Jun 18 03:43:34 2015 UTC,Or just fill out your ICE (in case of emergency) contact which can be accessed from the lock screen.  Unless you enjoy staring at janky and worrisome messages all day.
lifehacks,3a5xhf,meeshkyle,25,Wed Jun 17 14:44:46 2015 UTC,"This so much. I work in a College Police Department. Every time we get a smart phone turned in to our lost and found, we make sure it is on (if not we charge it), then look for ICE Contacts if the phone is locked. maybe only 1 out of 100 has them. It is so easy with Android Phones too.   Look how I have mine set up. Most smart phones have an ""emergency dialer"" on the bottom left of the lock screen, which you can see on OPs image. Mine just has a red phone icon. After getting to the ""emergency dialer"" you can see on mine I have 3 quick contacts right at the top. If I select any 3 of those icons, it dials those numbers. If I select the next bottom left button that looks like a framed picture with a light on the bottom right corner, I get a list of my other ICE Contacts. Also, if you look at my lock screen, I also have a setting in which I can put ""Owner: Kyle _______"" up at the top. I've seen some people enter their emergency contact information there. I put my name so if someone does find it (or finds me passed out or dead/dieing), they know the name of the owner of the phone so when they call my ICE contacts they know the ""who"" in who they may be trying to contact or help.   Also, Put your mom, dad, work, and home numbers in your phone as just that. ""Mom"", ""Dad"", ""Work"" or ""Home"". Or ""Mother"" or ""Father"" or something that can definitely say who your relative might be. If we find a phone that is unlocked and has no password those are the 3 numbers we look for as we know it is probably easier for parents to find other means of contacting their children rather than a cell phone, or a home number so we can call and leave a voicemail. A Work number is great because well, you are going to be going to work eventually right? If all we see are regular names we won't call those. We have no idea who are close friends or acquaintances just by names entered."

Toss the pasta with the sauce in the pan and heat for a minute or two then serve.

lifehacks,3a8clp,sxzxnnx,4,Thu Jun 18 19:33:53 2015 UTC,"Make sure to wash down all the walls and ceilings thoroughly, possibly more than once considering the original extent of the smell.  If necessary, consider doing a wall wash with TSP (can get it at most hardware stores). If it still reeks after that, there are special paints on the market for painting over smoke-stained-scented walls.  Also, a good quality mild incense works better than scented sprays for making a place smell better. Just as cigarette smoke penetrates everywhere, so does incense smoke -- it just smells a heck of a lot better. Good luck!"

lifehacks,3a8clp,quezlar,4,Thu Jun 18 19:45:32 2015 UTC,"As /u/dragon_lady mentioned, a thorough washdown with TSP is a good start.  I had an issue with cat spray in my house when I took in a stray and it decided to mark all around the house while I was away at work the first day I left him alone.    TSP helped on the floors and walls but the thing that finally got rid of the smell from every nook and cranny was a product from Biocide.  It uses chlorine dioxide to not just mask but actually get rid of the chemical compounds that are causing the smell.  I let 5-6 of these little canisters go in the house and after a few hours the house smelled more like a hospital than a feline's behind.  The bleachy smell dissipated in a day or so once the windows were open and the house aired out.  You can get the, ""Room Shocker"" on Amazon and it is worth every penny of the $20 or so for each canister.  There is also a Vital Oxide Disinfectant fogger kit that might be overkill but it's what ServiceMaster and other cleaning companies sometimes use.  I would follow that up with Killz and an HVAC filter service (maybe add a Febreeze filter) before painting as others have mentioned."

Funny thing is, they show a cheap plastic hanger with the little indentations a few spots over on the right. They're much more practical for camis, etc.  I'm no hot glue hater. I love the stuff. I've even gone so far as to use it for fixing my dishwasher (2 years and still going strong), but the stuff peels."

lifehacks,3a32q3,monsieurpommefrites,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:35:24 2015 UTC,Doesn't work. Sorry. Hot glue will peel off a damn 2x4. It's sticks really well to fabric and some paper. I guess the material has to have large enough pores for the thick glue to enmesh itself in. But those cheapo plastic hangers work well. Save your good wooden hangers for heavy stuff like coats.

Lay a pair that you like the fit of on top of a big pair inside out, and basically outline the small pair onto each big pair with chalk. Pinning isn't really necessary. Run a quick seam down each leg and cut off any excess fabric. With 10 pairs it shouldn't take more than a few hours.  I turned a bunch of flare jeans into skinny jeans a while back."

lifehacks,3a5205,Gotxi,2,Wed Jun 17 10:21:58 2015 UTC,"I think it has more to do with the field of view and where your eyes' focus is. Meaning, when you're holding the book, your focus is about 1 1/2 feet from your face. But, there's about 3 more feet behind the book to the ground of the car. Since you're focused on the book, your eyes are getting a weird/distorted view of the background. Mix that confusing view with slight motion, and you've got yourself a headache.   It's similar to how iPhone 5s started giving people headaches if they looked at the home screen too long because they move around the icons in accordance to the accelerometer. Next time you use a relatively new iPhone, move the phone a little while you're looking at the home screen, you'll have a better idea of what I'm talking about."

It's a mental issue- you'll have one foot in the US, one in Scotland. For some, it worsened their homesickness. You will be chasing your items because once outside the U.S., even big companies like UPS function as a collection of little, disconnected, provincial centres. Took 6 months to get my stuff and being grumpy/unsettled is not the best way to make new friends. Care packages- some arrive immediately, others take months with no explanation whatsoever.  I studied/moved abroad six times, all within Europe. With moving in and out of dorms, apartments, short rentals, and my parents' place, I moved 19 times in 3 years. You just don't need a lot of stuff!!!!! Really.  I'm sure you've heard, layers are the key to dealing with European weather. Take it seriously. Lots of thin layers. The weather changes hour to hour. If you buy anything, stay within the black/white/grey/oatmeal colour family. It'll all match. Uniqlo is a good resource- their HeatTek stuff, as your first layer,  really does keep you warm despite being super thin.  Best part of layers is you can mix and match them in so many different ways, it'll look like you have more clothes. So you can pack less overall. Look at your current wardrobe and see what you can layer, you don't have to buy a ton of new stuff, just think outside the U.S. box ;)  For winter, you want wool. Your dad probably has a few jumpers he'll part with. Don't expect American style indoor heating. Sturdy pair of boots-if they're waterproof, all the better!  I packed samples of toiletries, and bought full size ones once I arrived. Less to carry, and although I didn't plan it this way, now whenever I catch a whiff of any of those scents, it conjures up really lovely memories.   Pack your electronics, of course. And converters. Get a FULL supply of any medicine you need. Make a few photocopies of all important documents and stash them in different places as well as taking photos/scans to email yourself. All that culture shock you are about to experience is exactly the thing which marks you as an outsider. Meaning if there is a thief around, you will be targeted first. Don't be paranoid, but don't be too lax. Expect every evening to involve alcohol so just don't carry anything important with you. If you don't drink that night, no problem, if you do, you'll be glad to stumble home and not have to worry about where your passport is. Wish my friends had agreed with that way of thinking because there were too many trips to the station to fill out that damn ""Details of the Loser"" form. And I did have to laugh at them.  Good luck!

lifehacks,3a2fu9,kickinitinkunming,8,Wed Jun 17 12:04:25 2015 UTC,"I moved to Germany for 14 months (and back) so just about the same thing. Here's how my packing turned out.   First and foremost don't go into this with the intention of buying clothes, clothes are substantially more expensive and you'll just be throwing money away. It was cheaper to buy clothes in the US and then pay international shipping than it was to purchase clothes while there.   Use the neutral colors. It may be boring but bring only clothes that match so that you can use any of your shirts with any of your pants and shoes. This allows for a lot more outfit combinations than if you have a shirt that only works with one or two pairs of pants.   Learn to love button-up shirts. Button-ups are great in any situation, unbutton a few top buttons and keep the tail untucked and BOOM instant laid back shirt, take a couple minutes tuck it in, put a tie on BOOM professional/formal wear. Bring lots of button ups.   Have a really good pair of leather shoes. I had Clark's Desert Boots. I could wear them all day anywhere and my feet were comfy but I could also clean them up and they were nice enough to wear in most professional situations.   Bring one pair of athletic shoes, these can be your work out or tourist shoes when you know you'll be walking dozens of miles around a new city in a day.   That being said have a pair of dress shoes. These will make you appear more professional when giving your grad school presentations and some clubs are extremely picky.   In this same vein bring a suit jacket. This is a must for formal presentations and can instantly class up any outfit that you're not quite sure is formal enough.   Jeans are bulletproof, but a good pair of hardy dark jeans that fit a little tight (gotta be European right?). Over the course of a year you could wear these 2/3 of the time and they'd still look good.   Use all extra space for socks and underwear, you can get away with wearing a shirt a few times before you appear to be a sleep-deprived grad student but you cannot skip washing your undies. They are the limiting factor when it comes time to do laundry (which you will pay more than you want per wash).  Don't worry much about shorts, their summers are short and not very hot. So also skip the sandals too. A bathing suit may be nice if you're travelling but you can just wear your athletic shoes to any beach/pool you plan on going to.   I cheated and sent one package when I moved and that contained my winter jacket, gloves and hat. These items are heavy and take up valuable underwear space. I used a flat-rate 15lb box and shipped it when I moved in July so I had plenty of time before the winter. If possible I recommend a nice wool jacket that you can wear in a more formal setting but will also keep you warm in the long Scottish winters. I used UPS with no issues and then used DHL to ship it home.   Before setting your mind on taking two suitcases look up the cost to ship per pound and compare it to the extra baggage fee you'll have to pay.   Just take care of yourself and keep your clothes clean and on a regular rotation and you can get by with a lot fewer clothes than you thought. I hope this novella helps you come up with a packing list.  If you want more specifics give me a shout."

lifehacks,3a2fu9,corporal_clegg69,2,Wed Jun 17 12:28:38 2015 UTC,"Wool is warm even if wet, and generally tends to be pretty waterproof in the first place. Edinburgh doesn't get tooo cold, but it will be around freezing for months. You'd be fine with a ski type jacket, that's what I tend to wear the majority of the winter. You could come across with one then go to thrift stores for another coat, or clothes. Edinburgh has some nice ""charity shops"" where you can get second hand clothes. As for waterproofs, make sure you have footwear that can get wet. Most people wear boots majority of the winter. Most of my clothing has a hood, I'm not a fan of umbrellas (wind, and I get poked in the eye a lot). Edinburgh does get some lovely sunny weather, but it also gets a lot of rain, so long as you're prepared you'll be fine."
lifehacks,3a2fu9,melston9380,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:42:11 2015 UTC,"Hello!  Clothing won't really be an issue. I'm a simple girl. Uniforms to one work, dress clothes (slacks + nice shirt) to other work, and jeans + t-shirt any other time ever, with one pair of PJs. I'm also not fashionable, so already, all of my clothes go with all of my other clothes, with the exception of slacks + t-shirts.   I don't own any button up shirts because they constrict my shoulders and I have an issue with the horrid bust-button always flashing people. Do I need to get some anyway?  Leather shoes? Is that better than having a small pair of dress shoes and a pair of athletic shoes?  Suit jacket? Is this a male-only rule or am I out of the loop. I don't even own a suit.  I don't wear shorts, but I wear flip-flops year round (snow and all). Must I break my habit?!?!  I've seen a lot of people mention winter clothes. Are they really necessary? I live in Arkansas now and I've never needed more than normal clothes paired with closed-toe shoes and a normal-weight jacket. Am I in for a big surprise? Also don't own gloves or a hat, do I need to?  Thank you! Your post was super helpful. I hope you don't mind my follow-up questions!"

lifehacks,3a2fu9,melston9380,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:45:52 2015 UTC,"Haha, well disregard any of my fashion advice that seems questionable, I assumed you were a guy. Ahhhhh, so don't worry about the suit jacket. You do however need at least one professional presentation outfit.   I suggested leather shoes because they hold up well and you can get a lot of wear out of them wherever you are before they're kaput. Athletic shoes in general aren't as accepted in social situations as they are state-side. I did get comments whenever I had my running shoes on when I wasn't obviously going to somewhere to workout or coming from somewhere I had just ran around for an hour or so. I say keep your dress shoes nice and clean and beat up a pair of hardier leather shoes.   Sadly the flip-flop habit must be broken. At least going off of the international students I did orientation with, we're the only ones that understand the beauty of a good pair of Rainbows. Also I tripped and stubbed my toes on cobblestone streets more than I like to admit.   Yes! Winter clothes are absolutely necessary. Especially for you, you're coming from a much much warmer climate. Currently according to weather.com it's 50F in Edinburgh. I know I consider that at least mid-fall weather, and it only gets colder. It will stay grey and chilly for most of the time you're gone. Get a good set of winter clothes.  Also based off of other comments and my understanding of Scotland's climate, a good rain-jacket to shake off the never ending fog.   Maybe a rain-jacket shell with a good lining for your winter coat?  Another thing that I never thought about until I moved over-seas was how much further north I was than at home. So winter days are much shorter and winter nights much longer than I was used to."

Clothes for 10 days, then laundry, your electronics, documents, etc. Everything else it will be cheaper to buy there, including furniture if you need, look for second hand stores.

Only bring clothes that are high quality and you know you can wear them in lots of different ways.   Remember, you only get 2 bags on the way back and you'll end up buying new things while your here.   Make a list, then get rid of half of it. Then if you have the chance to pack more you can choose from what you crossed off. Tell a friend to be ruthless and show them what you packed and make you fight for what you want.   They have shops here! The brands will be different, but they'll have what you need.   Enjoy the change and embrace all the new experience! Good luck!

Just keep that mindset and packing won't be as stressful.   Pack only clothes you LOVE that are essential to situations you'll realistically be in within the next 15 months (this applies to weather as well as formal/business attire.) Do some Googling on packing tips to avoid wasting space. Shoes should be stuffed with socks, vacuum seal bags, roll clothes instead of folding, that kind of thing.  Pack consumables/toiletries ONLY if you're certain you won't be able to buy them there. Avoid papers/books, as they get heavy deceptively fast.  Don't ship anything! You're right that it's pricey and there's complications if it gets lost/won't make it."

You end up spending a LOT of money on things that wouldn't fit in your car, or things you didn't even think you would need. I probably spent $600 on bedding, a blow up mattress  (which deflated after a month), towels, dishes,  a lamp, garbage can, etc. and now this is all stuff you need to get rid of when you leave. When I moved out my one car load turned into 5 car loads and I also needed to pay a guy with a pickup to move the few pieces of furniture in had acquired.   It's a huge hassle and you will be uncomfortable. Trust me, you will eventually want a chair to sit in and a table to eat dinner on, and a screen to watch TV on. Living in an empty apartment was not fun for me.   You're best bet is finding a sublet or an apartment with a roomate. It will be furnished, cheaper, and your new roommate can serve as an impromptu guide for the city you are in. I found a couple places to live on Craigslist this way, most of them are still my friends years later.

Blow up mattress that has a decent height and add nice comforter on top so it feels more like a real bed. Hanging shoe box organizer for your closet that hangs from the pole because you can put socks etc. in there and between that and hanging clothes it will feel more like a dresser. When you get there find a free couch/arm chair on Craigslist that looks comfy and bring blankets you can throw over to hide the inevitable ugly/worn print, then give it away before you leave. Running shoes and hand weights. You could also take an exercise class to potentially meet some nice folks to chill with while you're away in case you don't meet many at your internship."

One caution, if you don't end up somewhere furnished or semi furnished: if you're cool with an air mattress, great, but I find that after a couple of nights I'd rather sleep on the floor.  That being said, I swear by egg crates, so consider throwing one of those on top of your air mattress rather than a comforter.  Also, my grandma bought me this freakin' amazing foam ""bean"" bag, that folds out into a full-size bed (they come in single, queen, and king, too).  It's comfortable as shit in both positions and, as noted above, you can always throw an egg crate under or over it to make it extra sweet.    Good luck!"

I sold just about everything I had, because I was pretty set on staying in NYC no matter what. I sold my keyboard, gave away my speakers, donated a bunch of clothes, until I was at the point where everything I owned fit into 1 bookbag, 2 cardboard boxes, and a large duffel bag.   In my tiny room in upper Manhattan, I slept for 3 months on an air mattress (which fit, pump and all, into that duffel bag). It was hot, so I had to buy a fan, but that meant I didn't have to pack blankets.   All my clothes I kept in a cardboard box (no closet space in that room haha). Which was totally fine. I found a cheap desk and chair on Craigslist for $50. I also had packed 1 plate, a fork/spoon/knife (I recommend a spork to cut down on items), 1 pan, 1 pot, 1 coffee mug, and 1 glass. I used a cardboard box lined with a plastic bag for my makeshift trash can.  For exercise, the great outdoors beckoned. Since it was NYC, I was always walking, but it was really easy to go for a run around Central Park or down the river walk way. For food, I generally lived off rice, potatoes, eggs, and pb&js. Every once in a while I would go to a meetup where they had food...that was always pretty awesome.  Overall, I was pretty comfortable.

lifehacks,3a1r8t,catloving,2,Tue Jun 16 23:13:14 2015 UTC,"I actually did something similar for a 3 month internship in another city.  I bought a camping cot off Amazon and put a folded comforter on top of it so it was more comfortable.    I brought around two weeks worth of business casual clothes for work and a week's worth of casual clothing for the weekends, plus a few pairs of shoes.  I bought toiletries and food when I got there.   I didn't pack any furniture or kitchen stuff since I was moving into an unfurnished room in a furnished house, but you could consider buying a cheap table and a few chairs when you get there rather than trying to pack furniture into a hatchback.  If where you're going has an IKEA, you could get some super basic stuff for cheap, like this table and 4 chairs set for $115, and this comfy armchair for $69.    For exercise, you could try to mostly do outdoor running and bodyweight exercises, or you could see if there's a cheap gym nearby where you can pay by the month."

The main items were:   Basic kitchen utensils - knives, pots etc.  You will want self-catering digs and you'll need enough kitchen equipment to cook for yourself.  Buy what you need locally - there will be a hardware shop, kitchen shop or department store or supermarket with kitchen equipment closeby unless your internship is on mars. A desk (flat-pack from Ikea or somewhere).  This made it easy to transport An office chair that came apart An all-in-one printer/scanner/fax (Brother make some decent, cheap ones). A laptop computer. A desk lamp Clothing, toiletries etc.   What I missed were:   A comfy chair that I could relax in. A decent cooker, although this depends on what facilities you have available. I don't watch a lot of TV but you might want a small TV.   All the places I went had storage and a bed, but you might want to get a flat-pack  bed and chest of drawers if you don't have that."

They can be a pain as they deflate, cold goes right through them, they make noise, etc, etc.  A futon mattress with some memory foam on top would be better.  In fact, they make small futons that turn into little couches/chairs and a bed. You can assemble when you arrive. Plastic storage bins make good tables and storage.  Add a piece of plywood over the top and you have a low desk.  Bring exercise bands or a bike with a trunk bike carrier. Get the rest at secondhand stores or Craigslist."

lifehacks,3a9sfp,SeniorDiscount,-7,Thu Jun 18 12:41:11 2015 UTC,"It's a binderclip, if you bend it like that you can use it to hold your phone while you are watching something on it"
lifehacks,3a9sfp,zzisrafelzz,8,Thu Jun 18 15:08:51 2015 UTC,"So, just a recommendation - Your post is about how a binder clip asks as a phone holder, but you only have one picture of two binder clips.  You haven't shown HOW it works as a phone holder, or, more importantly, how it differs from putting any other old random object behind a phone to act as a prop for the phone.  If it is going to be a useful lifehack, it should:   Be Novel.  If it is a life hack that is ubiquitous or part of the device's function you are mentioning, then it isn't a life hack.  It is just a description of the unit.  I.e.: ""use this hanger to hang your clothes in the closet."" It needs explaining.  You need to show HOW this object or tip is utilized, since it is not typical or standard, and therefore will not be super obvious to any who simply read the title or see a simple picture.  If it were that obvious, again, it would not be a life hack, it would just be part of daily life. It should be unique in some way.  As in the example of your post, the binder clips could be replaced with large dice, or rocks, or a large group of other items that could be used to prop up a phone.  The Binder clips in this case do not offer something that any other object doesn't offer if it were of similar size (not even shape, just size).   I hope you read this as constructive criticism to help you, and not just someone crapping on you, as that is not my intention.  Perhaps you can retool this submission to explain why your binder clip idea is novel and unique, and then explain it a little better with a series or sequence of pictures, rather than just a picture of binder clips.  Good luck."

lifehacks,3a4bya,GeekSnozzle,0,Mon Jul 6 09:37:08 2015 UTC,"Depends what you're moving to.  But you'll need your passport (if moving out of country) or ID (if moving within your country) and access to money.  The less you bring, the more it will cost.  You'll need to wash your clothes very frequently if you're only bringing the clothes on your back.  You'll need to find ways to occupy your time, especially if you're not getting a job (which will be very difficult to do with just one outfit and no fixed address).  With no kitchen facilities, you'll need to buy pre-made food for every snack and meal.  A smartphone is a good electronic ""multi-tool"" that can provide you with a means of contact, a means of finding information, and a source of entertainment.  You need to decide where you're going to sleep every night.  In a hostel?  You'll have to find out where the hostel in your city is and how long you're allowed to stay there.  Sublet a room?  Better make sure it's furnished, or you're sleeping on the floor."

Buying new shoes is a good start, but the spores will be there as soon as you bring them from other old shoes with your feet.  I broke the odor curse within a few weeks by thinking of it as a biohazard (thanks to a science teacher on 5th grade).  When my mom took me to buy a new pair of shoes, I did not come back home wearing them as usual. And tried them at the store just briefly, with a pair of clean, dry socks.  Threw the old one away, soaked my flipflops in a bucket with Lysoform (it was a disinfectant based in formol, nowadays it uses a less aggressive, useless thing). Do it with all shoes simultaneously, or they'll spread from one to the other.  I only had a pair of sneakers and flipflops at a time, so it was easy.  Changed the beddings.  Took a shower and obsessively washed my feet, specially between the toes. Rub between them to squeaky clean (use a small towel like dental floss). Made sure toenails were clean and trimmed.  Even avoided stepping barefoot where I've stepped before with the ""contaminated"" feet.  Always made sure to wear clean socks, washed and thoroughly dried my feet, and used plenty of anti-odor powder or spray every time I'd put shoes on.  Let shoes in the Sun (UV is GOOD) whenever I could - I'm in Brazil, not really an option for you in UK (sorry couldn't resist), but put them close to a space heater or oven then.  NEVER store them nor wear them if they are wet or moist. Keep them dry.  After a couple of weeks, I gradually eased on the OCD behavior. Never had foot odor problems again.  Think like the fungus and bacteria. Be the fungus and bacteria. Understand your enemy, then slaughter them and all their children!! Remember they have been developing their strategies since before the ages of men. Do not show weakness and you WILL PREVAIL. Go!  Edit: if you have no Lysoform, get the strongest disinfectant you can get that is not a chemical WMD. Bleach indeed will ruin your shoes albeit indeed will kill stuff. Try something strong, but make sure to rinse completely if it is hazardous for your feet."

lifehacks,39rays,Morfee,11,Sun Jun 14 02:42:32 2015 UTC,"Dish soap is only to be used when you want to strip your car of all contaminants and protective coatings. It's essentially starting from zero.   The only time you really want to do this is when a clay bar is next (used in conjunction with a high lubricity wetting agent--spray wax or a no-rinse shampoo). Then a glaze or sealant. Then wax. Or all three. In that order.   Don't get me wrong. Dish soap isn't bad. You're simply leaving your paint bare against the environment if you don't do the next step.   From bird poop to pollen, it will all affect your paint without post-wash protection.   Of course, all of this depends on how much you care about the paint on a vehicle. This may be a work truck, or an inexpensive ""point A to point B"" type of truck. In which case, ignore everything I said. At a minimum, your truck is clean."

lifehacks,39rays,xenemorph,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:17:10 2015 UTC,"Oh boy, that's a bigger question than you realize.    Wash. Two bucket method. The choice of soap here really matters. High polymer, high lubricity makes all the difference. The choice of wash ""sponge"" also matters. No foam (as in kitchen sponge type foam), no cotton, just high-pile microfiber. Should look like the hide of a sheep dog. More surface area means you're not dragging the dirt along with the wash ""sponge"".  Clay Bar with ultra high lubricity spray wax as a lubricant. (if necessary, I probably only do this twice a year)  Dry with very, very high pile microfiber cloths. In one direction only. And as lightly as possible using a spray wax as a lubricant. Depending on how slick my car is from previous protection I will use a leaf blower and simply blow the water off. This has the obvious benefit of not dragging missed dirt particles all over the car.  Protection. This varies from car to car and owner's preferences. I use a glaze to fill in the microscratches I haven't yet fixed, followed by a silcone oxide sealant. Followed by a paste wax.    Larry Kosilla is everyone's hero on this topic.   And here's a good place to check my advice. Some of it may have been wrong. These guys will know.   Youtube.com is a huge help. Start with the two bucket method and go from there. And really the two buckets is only for the car. The wheels never, ever get washed with either of the first two buckets so it's really three.   BTW, if you haven't been doing this regimen of paint care since the car was new, you already have damage that can't be fixed by just proper washing. At some point your paint will have to be corrected. Then you can keep it looking new with the above steps. Until then, proper washing will only stop you from doing more damage."

That and a rag are perfect for the wash cycle of a manual car wash in even the most dismal drought (I can wash my mid-sized car with less than 1 gallon of water; maybe double that for a quick rinse using fresh water from the hose).  EDIT: For all those dish soap haters, it's good to see that you're so brainwashed by commercial vendors wanting to sell you specialized products, but you'd do well to consider the (small) concentration of soap I'm talking about, the amount of time and work going into its application, and the fact that dish soap isn't chemically much different from every other soap we use (e.g. to wash our hands, hair, clothes, etc.).  In any case, the point stands even if we replace ""dish soap"" with some other kind of soap; a small amount with a bucket of water and a rag can do just as well as a torrent from the hose."

(Though I specialize in electronics) Wood can be a real pain, especially when it's oil or protein based. You might need to sand and restain that shit if they're nice cabinets and are worth it.  Start with mild soap and water with sponges, then stock up on magic erasers to do a finishing touch then see where you're at. If it's oily at all test a few degreasers as mentioned by the others. If the odor is bad you might want to google some restoration companies, they can bring some deodorizing equipment (there are many types) and let it run for a few days. Finish with some Murphys oil soap or some ZEP Wood Dr. To replenish the natural oils and condition the cabinets.  You could always file a claim with your insurance, it shouldn't be too bad if you don't need much work done. Companies like mine have their own commercial chemicals to deal with this kind of stuff"

There's a technology called thermal fogging which will get any smell that can be gotten.   That said, especially if it's from burned protein, it's going to be really hard to get out. Incense is probably a good bet. The trouble is that the smell is effectively ""baked in"" by the heat, which makes it impossible to remove via normal cleaning. You'll need to remove the layer that it got baked into, which means refinishing, repainting, etc. Additionally, be aware that it's very common for your mind to trick you into believing the smell is still there, even after its really gone.

Most of it was intact though, so a quick trip to the ER and they sewed it all back up.  I had to wear a brace on my finger for a few weeks after, so I basically had an excuse to walk around flipping folks the bird so it was kind of worth it.  The following winter the same girl pushed me backwards on a sled down an icy hill.  I ramped a ditch at the bottom, flipped over and landed head first on solid ice.  This resulted in a subdural hematoma, a crush vertebra and multiple hairline fractures in my spine around c5/c6. Two weeks in the hospital (which wasn't terrible as I got to play n64 pretty much all day) and 8 weeks in back brace came from that, but I ultimately made a full recovery.

Maybe its cause you hear the word cringe such a cringe-worthy amount of times that the word itself makes you cringe a bit. Its pretty old at this point, but still so useful."

lifehacks,39lspc,Galphanore,32,Sat Jun 13 01:41:19 2015 UTC,This seems like a better way than the one in the OP because it's compressing all the tissue instead of just in a thin line around the dental floss.
lifehacks,39lspc,Shiroi_Kage,54,Sat Jun 13 01:58:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah but if you wrap enough of the dental floss you're going to compress most of the tissue. Besides, you're more likely to come across dental floss than you are to come across a stretchy strap like that."

lifehacks,39lspc,2ILn86KTkWtBQZ,3,Sat Jun 13 03:07:28 2015 UTC,"The biggest difference is they work from the fingertip in, while OP's shows them working from where the finger meets the hand outward. OP's way functionally makes a tourniquet, blocking blood from leaving the finger. It doesn't really reduce the swelling, just pushes it more towards the fingertip. Working from the fingertip in forces the blood back into the hand and makes for a much easier procedure."
lifehacks,39lspc,Galphanore,2,Sat Jun 13 10:47:10 2015 UTC,"Hopefully it doesn't take long enough to matter very much either way but yeah, good catch."
lifehacks,39lspc,2ILn86KTkWtBQZ,2,Sat Jun 13 03:14:23 2015 UTC,Yeah it's definitely not a serious risk but it makes the process more painful and difficult.
lifehacks,39lspc,Galphanore,1 point,Sat Jun 13 08:39:30 2015 UTC,Which would be much more of an issue in a medical situation where you NEED to remove the ring than in a general one where it's just stuck and maybe a little swollen.

What a complete crock of shit. If they cared about the environment, they would throw the natural requirement in the trash and use what is most efficient and least damaging to the environment.   Organic farming uses much more land than conventional farming to produce the same amount of food, and with a growing population and emerging economics, we have to produce much more food in the coming decades. We cannot destroy more wildlife than we absolutely have to. Organic farming is the environments enemy.  This video is testing for pesticides that are found in sythetic pesticides, and omits all the pesticides that are used in organic farming. Coop is lying to your faces: http://skepchick.org/2015/05/bad-chart-thursday-organic-cherry-picking/  Note: organic livestock is another story where giving animals more space and less antibiotics do make sense."

There's a good dozen or more organic standards associations around the world and I'm sure they all have their own limitations. Organic is definitely not a catch all solution, but can be a step in a positive direction.  Your statements about habitat destruction and land use are strange at best. Organic does not mean more land being cultivated for the same yields.... That's ...   As I said. Organic is not some glorious win for the world. In some cases it's a sign of an excellent production system, in others it's just an expensive marketing gimmick. For the most part, it's at least a step in a positive direction towards more sustainable food production."

And I just don't see in what cases it is not an expensive marketing gimmick..."
lifehacks,39dhw5,batwing71,2,Thu Jun 11 16:38:07 2015 UTC,"""In general, synthetic substances are prohibited unless specifically allowed and non-synthetic substances are allowed unless specifically prohibited. For example, a vaccine used to prevent pinkeye in livestock is an allowed synthetic substance and arsenic is an example of a prohibited natural substance. Some substances on the National List may only be used in specific situations, e.g. only for certain crops or up to a maximum amount.""  This is from the USDA. You can review the list at your leisure here. The USDA organic standards are some of the most open and corporate friendly. You're right that they do allow the use of a lot of substances, and some of those concessions can be quite questionable. However, the goal is to reduce dependency and encourage sustainable practices, not outright ban everything possible in a way that will critically handicap producers. If I am growing meat birds under organic certification and one of my birds gets severely ill, I will isolate it and give it antibiotics (according to the illness) and be able to maintain my certification. I can still sell this bird, but it will no longer be organic while the rest of the flock is. As I say, in some cases the concessions are very questionable, but many follow the course of the example above.   And when you have 7 billion people to feed, you will use more land if you grow organic when yields are lower. How is that strange?   Here I have picked the very first scholarly article on organic yields vs. conventional yields that came up on google. It states clearly that organic yields are less, but ""Under certain conditions—that is, with good management practices, particular crop types and growing conditions—organic systems can thus nearly match conventional yields, whereas under others it at present cannot. To establish organic agriculture as an important tool in sustainable food production, the factors limiting organic yields need to be more fully understood, alongside assessments of the many social, environmental and economic benefits of organic farming systems."" The important thing about yields is that they are entirely dependent on context. A bad farmer using conventional practices on degraded soil (due to the conventional practices) will have lower yields than a good farmer using quality organic practices on improved soil (due to the organic practices). So yeah, if you have a seriously impressive mega farm with millions of dollars of equipment and inputs to push your farm to the highest production possible you can beat out organic production in yields for some time. In the end, with improved organic practices and fertility, the organic system will win out.   And I just don't see in what cases it is not an expensive marketing gimmick...   I have personally worked for a variety of small organic producers and it has never been a marketing gimmick for them. It certainly has been expensive for them, but the product we brought to consumers was top grade, sought out by the best restaurants and applauded for it's quality by enthusiast gardeners.  Unfortunately the supermarket is loaded with poor quality unsustainable product that is labelled organic as an expensive marketing gimmick, but it is certainly not the only case that exists."

lifehacks,391ep3,theLogicalPsycho,-9,Mon Jun 8 22:12:03 2015 UTC,"It seems to accomplish everything you just mentioned.   A tea strainer suspends the tea leaves in the water, and you pull the strainer (and the leaves) out when it's done steeping, and you're left with only the liquid.  A french press, on the other hand, smooshes all of the coffee grounds down toward the bottom of the container and keeps them in place, usually with a gasket and a fine mesh screen to keep the grounds from getting mixed in with the coffee. When you pour liquid out of the container and into your mug, the coffee grounds are still in the container, but they're kept in place by the mesh screen and gasket.  Based on the imgur album, the paper cup with holes poked in the bottom was being used to suspend tea leaves in water, and they were removed after the steeping was finished. It's not how a french press works.  The OP's post is a perfectly serviceable life hack for a tea strainer - but it's not a french press because it doesn't operate the way a french press does."

A company called TWSBI had one at some point, but I couldn't find one for sale anywhere.  http://imgur.com/a/xxw3c  So....I launched a kickstarter:  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/132624704/penpad-a-notebook-with-a-secret-compartment-for-yo/  The consensus up to this point is that most notebook aficionados hate the idea.  They are purists and want a high quality notebook unadulterated from its original form.  The rest of society (my minute circle of friends and coworkers) love the idea...they just aren't willing to pay $20 for a notebook.  Starting to understand why the Mead boys haven't brought this to market.  I'm sure it will be asked how I launched a kickstarter for a product that already has an awarded patent.  Turns out that a product must have every single claim as stated by the patent.  There is a claim, something to the effect of, ""mechanism to keep the notebook front cover affixed to the rear cover.

lifehacks,393izb,moose359,3,Tue Jun 9 13:21:03 2015 UTC,"Actually, these steps are not common sense, exactly, and need to be performed perfectly this way, and if you do, the difference is immense, and very close to having air conditioning.   Open the windows at night. Open strategic windows so that cooler night air is blowing in throughout the evening. Leaving all interior doors open (including closets and kitchen cabinets) helps, too. If you leave them closed, they store the daytime heat and your house won't cool off so quickly at night.      Close the blinds. Shutting your blinds and curtains during the day will help block the sun's heat. As soon as the sun hits your building in the morning, close all windows and keep exterior doors and windows closed throughout the hottest part of the day. Do this until night falls and it's cool enough to open the windows for the night.   In the article they put them in reverse order, for some reason. But if you always make sure that every single window in your home is completely covered during the day, and then later at night, you open all of the windows, then your house will be very cool all the time.   It will cool off nicely at night, and won't be able to warm up much during the day. In the summer, there are some days where most of the heat is the sun, and some where it is just warm air. The warm air days are the hottest, and the most difficult with this technique, so if you start using it during that period, it won't cool down as much during the night, since the difference between day and night temperature won't be as high. But once a cool night kicks in, then it will work well. Just don't forget to close everything.  You have to be a real stickler about it though. Reasoning things like, ""well the sun doesn't shine through this window, so I won't cover it."" Will cause it to fail. You really have to open everything at night, and before the sun really kicks in, i.e. as soon as you wakeup, close everything, all windows, and cover all of them with completely opaque blinds, or curtains.   If you do these things, you will find that you don't really need air conditioning at all.     I've only ever encountered one person that actually did this in their home, and it really surprised me. I prefer it temperature/air wise to air conditioning. But the downside, is that during the day, you have darkness in your home, and not a nice view of the outdoors."

There is a reason why they drink tea all the time in the arabic countries when it is really hot. The body needs to cool down and heat up everything you eat and drink until it has its own temperature. So when you drink something cold your body need to heat it up. So your temperature raises. But when you drink something hot your body needs to cool down. Temperature falls. Try it just one day when you next encounter a very hot day.

I know Tires Plus has six months no interest for qualified buyers (that doesn't mean no PAYMENT, just no interest). Is this a paid internship?  Ask around and see if someone is willing to barter with you for labor (no way you're going to get out of paying for parts). What expertise do you have that someone else would value? Are you willing to take on a weekend job?   I don't know anything about car parts, except that there are places called pick-a-parts (pick-aparts?) that have cars partially damaged. So if there is the same make/model as yours that was totaled in a rear-end collision, maybe the compressor is still good.   Can you get your windows tinted? Another option is to bring a small cooler with a pair of wet, frozen underwear or socks. At the end of the day, change into the partially frozen clothing. It will at least keep you cooler.   Supposedly putting a white tarp on your car, or painting the roof white will reduce temperature some (all the school buses now have them).   You might also check the Honda subreddits/websites. I'm sure other owners have better and more specific advice.   Also, check out neck cooling scarves on Amazon. The good ones are amazing. Be sure to read a lot of reviews.

lifehacks,393bw9,2OQuestions,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:14:05 2015 UTC,"Another way to look at it is you're not putting money into a crappy car, you are putting money into improving your quality of life for the next 5 months.  Here's how I do the math sometimes before I buy something:  Step One:  Figure out how many months it will still be hot. Multiply by 4 (average # of weeks in a month). Multiply by how many days a week you go to your internship (assuming 5). Multiply by how many hours that is spent driving a day (2).   My guesstimate: It is going to be hot through at least October.   That's 5 months. Multiply by 4 = 20 (weeks). Multiply by 5 (assumed days you go to your internship) =100 days. Multiply by hours spent driving to/from internship (2)= 200.  Divide 200 by cost of compressor (I'm guessing $400).  200/400 = That comes out to 50C an hour for your comfort.  The real question is: Is it worth 50C/hour for you to be cool and comfortable? Conversely, if I paid you 50C/hour for you to be sweaty, hot, miserable, and stinky for 2 hours a day, would you accept that deal?  If the answer to 1 is 'yes' and the answer to 2 is 'no', then you have  a decision based on your needs & values, and fuck the price ratio of compressor to car price.   After all, you are worth more than a machine."

Dress for the heat - light t-shirt, shorts, flip flops.  change in the parking lot once you get to work (or in a parking lot a block or 2 away).  A wet wash cloth on the back of your neck will do wonders.  Same on your wrists. Bonus points if you have the cooler and can make it a cold wash cloth.  Try to take a different route if it means less stopping.  Moving = wind. Wind = bearable.   30minutes before you leave for the day, go to your car and crack the windows (weather permitting of course).  This will drop the initial temp by a good bit.  See if you can car pool.  Even 1-2 days a week would be a huge help.  Offer to pay for gas, you were going to spend it anyways.  Also - double check the quote for a compressor.  I had to replace one in an old car 4 years ago (91 geo) and it was only $450.  Make sure they are using a used part."

lifehacks,38x9u3,trillmuny,28,Sun Jun 7 17:01:15 2015 UTC,"No, lowering the overall temperature will NOT give you warm water when they have run through it all. In fact quite the opposite as they will use MORE of the hot water from the tank to get their desired temperature during their shower. Pretty much the only options you would have would be to discuss as a group that they lower their shower temps or take slightly shorter showers. Talk to your landlord about increasing the size of the water heater, or rearrange your schedule."

lifehacks,38x9u3,laidbackpk,2,Mon Jun 8 19:41:40 2015 UTC,I mean it depends on who is paying the bills. I used to live in a house with a giant water heater with gas hear that was shared between 4 units. The landlord paid the water and gas on the heater. I bet if the tank broke and he was faced with a choice he might have upgraded to instant heat. Never had any problems with the glorious unlimited hot showers in that house.

lifehacks,38x9u3,rivalarrival,14,Mon Jun 8 01:35:43 2015 UTC,"No, lowering the temperature will make the problem significantly worse. A tank-style water heater can't keep up with a high flow rate for that long. Shortly after the first shower starts, its burner (or heating element) comes on full and stays on until the tank is hot again. Which obviously doesn't happen fast enough because you find yourself taking cold showers.  You have to remember that the water coming out of your showerhead is a mixture of ""hot"" water from the tank, and ""cold"" water from the main supply. You have a limited supply of hot water, but an effectively unlimited supply of cold. For a constant flow rate from the shower head, you want to be using as much cold water as possible, which means your hot water needs to be as hot as you can safely make it.  If you have kids or elderly people living with you or who could be visiting, don't exceed 120F.  If it's just 4 able-bodied adults, run that thermostat to the maximum.   Other simple things that can help: install low-flow shower heads; take shorter showers; wait longer between showers to give the tank more time to catch up.  More complex things would be installing a larger or higher BTU tank, or even a tankless water heater."
lifehacks,38x9u3,TurnbullFL,4,Sun Jun 7 17:57:42 2015 UTC,Also verify your water heater is working properly. If one of the 2 heating elements isn't working properly you will get less hot water in situations like this.
lifehacks,38x9u3,rcrracer,0,Sun Jun 7 17:55:41 2015 UTC,Or turn up both the thermostats.
lifehacks,38x9u3,rcrracer,0,Sun Jun 7 18:02:02 2015 UTC,"I pointed out to /u/TurnbullFL where he was was incorrect and he agreed with me.  OP wouldn't know anything about if one, which one, or both elements are working properly. That makes my reply of  ""turn up the thermostats"" the correct reply."
lifehacks,38x9u3,rcrracer,0,Sun Jun 7 18:41:51 2015 UTC,If one of them aren't working turning up the thermostat isn't going to do anything except blow out the other element.   It's obvious you don't have any idea how electric water heaters work.
lifehacks,38x9u3,rcrracer,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:26:15 2015 UTC,I think if the upper element isn't working you won't get any hot water.  The upper thermostat will never be satisfied which is what is necessary for it to send electricity(2nd phase) down to the lower thermostat.  You will get a reduced amount of hot water if just the upper element works.
lifehacks,38x9u3,TurnbullFL,2,Mon Jun 8 01:08:10 2015 UTC,You are right. Top not working=no hot water. Bottom not working=only about 1/4 tank of hot water.

lifehacks,38x9u3,WendyLRogers3,2,Sun Jun 7 22:03:23 2015 UTC,"If you live in a sunny place, by far the best technique is a passive pre-heater.  It is little more than a black Recreational Vehicle water tank on your roof, with some bypass plumbing.  City water pressure is enough to fill it through its lower valve, and the water heats up considerably before it exits through its upper valve, flowing directly down to your water heater.  If your city water is 50F, for example, it takes a lot of time and energy for your water heater to warm it up to 115F.  If it is pre-heated to 80F or 90F first, it's impressive how quickly water is brought up to heat."
lifehacks,38x9u3,NassTee,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:04:11 2015 UTC,"As others have pointed out, that won't help.  What you can do with some showers is adjust the max temperature of the shower itself.  This only works on those showers where you turn the knob a little to get cold water and turn it farther to get hot.  There's a built in limiter that can prevent it from being turned all the way to the hottest setting.  You have to take off the knob to adjust it.  Your roommates won't like you much if they find out you changed it, but it might help you keep some hot water."
lifehacks,38x9u3,ipilotaxwing,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:24:48 2015 UTC,You could even ask your land lord about replacing the traditional water heater with an inline water heater.

Landlord would never install an inline water heater because the upfront cost is much greater than a tank style and he can't raise the rent to pay for any water heater.  Edit:  In an edit, Op says landlord is replacing the tank with a larger one.  Sounds like landlord does care if OP is having to take a cold shower."

lifehacks,38x9u3,timmywitt,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:22:48 2015 UTC,"The best way to get longer run time out of your showers is to not turn the hot water all the way on.  I had to learn this one the hard way, whenever I began a shower, I started by cranking the hot water up all the way. I then added cold water as required for temperature. This method does produce the most quantity of hot water, but if you turn the hot water on less (say halfway) and then add cold water, the difference in water pressure and quantity isn't that much, but the hot water lasts far far longer. Good luck convincing your roommates to do this, though."

That being said, the United app lets you connect to entertainment once your are above 10k feet (at no cost) and view movies.

lifehacks,38k24l,hardfork,2,Fri Jun 5 06:21:13 2015 UTC,"From the Gaurdian  Boozed and battered A pill said to prevent hangovers is on its way to Britain. But does it really work? Alex Hannaford puts it to the test   Later this year Britain will see its first anti-hangover pill hit the shelves. Legend has it that the drug - called RU-21 after the American legal drinking age - was created accidentally by the Russians during the cold war. Apparently scientists were working on a tablet that would allow KGB agents to drink adversaries under the table and steal secrets without getting three sheets to the wind themselves, but it didn't quite work. The agents still got drunk, but the pill produced an interesting side-effect - no fuzzy head the next morning.  RU-21, according to its makers, blocks the toxic chemical acetaldehyde which can damage tissues - thus preventing hangovers. Hollywood stars are said to be huge fans of the wonder drug as it enables them to stay out late on the party circuit with no visible signs of the night before to dent their expensive plastic surgery. At its launch in the United States last May, RU-21 was notching up sales of $10,000 (£5,600) a month. By December it was close to $1m (£560,000).  Purely in the interests of science, I thought I would try out RU-21 for myself. Recalling something about always using a ""control"" when doing experiments, I called upon Neil, a fellow Englishman living in Austin, Texas. Although Neil's a little older than me he is about the same build and I knew he couldn't resist a pint or two. My girlfriend, Courtney, would be the designated driver. And so it was one chilly Texas evening last week that we braved the bars of Austin for this extremely vital scientific experiment for my fellow countrymen.  The protocol was simple - I would take one RU-21 pill per alcoholic drink, as printed in the instructions. Neil would just, well, drink for England. And Courtney would watch us both make fools of ourselves.  We started out at a run-of-the-mill pub in downtown Austin. It served Fuller's ESB on tap - far better than most of the watered-down American beers on offer in the city. I hadn't eaten a thing all day, so we ordered some pizza slices and then made our way to the next pub, where we drank a pint each of locally brewed Austin pale ale. As Neil reminded me to pop another pill, I wondered whether this would look slightly dodgy in an English boozer. Still, if it worked, I guessed it would be worth a confrontation with a bouncer suspecting I was taking drugs.  It was time to pick up the pace. Neil was on a mission to get me smashed. We went into a dark watering hole on 6th Street - the main drag in Austin - and necked a Long Island iced tea (vodka, gin, rum, tequila, triple sec and coke), followed by a shot of Jaegermeister herbal liqueur, while Courtney thrashed us both at pool.  Across the road we drank a gin and tonic each, as an almost-naked Japanese man bounced around on the nearby stage to feedback guitar.  ""This is awful,"" Neil said. ""If you really want to test this thing you need a shot of everything in my drinks cabinet.""  So we made our way to Neil's living room where he poured us a shot each of Southern Comfort. Followed by apple vodka. Followed by 99%-proof banana schnapps liqueur. Followed by another gin and tonic. And a vanilla vodka. And two further shots of Jaegermeister. I know all this because, thankfully, I wrote it all down.  I will spare you the detail of what happened next. Suffice to say I was violently ill for a good few hours that night and the next day I didn't rise until about 1.30pm. For the rest of the day I nursed a throbbing head and bad stomach. The results of the experiment were disastrous. Neil, meanwhile, had got up and gone to work at 9.30am feeling fine .  At around six o'clock I managed to pick up the phone to call Spirit Sciences, the California-based company that manufactures the drug. I was put through to Emil Chiaberi, its chief executive.  ""Er, is there a limit to the number of drinks you should have when using this product?"" I asked gingerly. ""I don't think it worked for me.""  Chiaberi sounded a little shocked. ""It's rare that somebody has said it didn't work,"" he said. ""For most people it has worked after excessive amounts of alcohol, but that's not something we promote. It's not for binge drinkers,"" he insisted. ""Your body still has a limit, and if you over-drink you'll make yourself ill.""  The product, he says, is really aimed at reducing the risk of serious diseases associated with alcohol. ""How many drinks did you have? This pill is really for moderate drinkers.""  I am just hoping he has done his research into British drinking habits."

lifehacks,38k24l,bigbellys,7,Thu Jun 4 22:05:00 2015 UTC,"tldr: doubtful to help, just drink water  Med student here, not the most qualified but the breakdown of alcohol is pretty straight forward.  Basically 2 enzymes movies things along from:  Ethanol --> Acetylaldehyde --> Acetic Acid  Acetic acid can easily be burned by cells for energy. The problem is when aldehyde accumulates as it is not very stable and can create reactive oxygen species (aka free radicals) which damages cells in various ways. What is proposed here is that n-acetylcysteine (NAC) can act as an antioxidant and minimize these damages, but in reality it's likely a minimal effect similar to taking some vitamin C to ""cure"" your hangover.   Other than the free radical damage, alcohol also causes fatty liver change. Notice how in the above reaction you're forming NADH, that is the energized form. The problem is your liver is stuck with a conundrum; on one hand it must detoxify the ethanol which is damaging, but on the other hand it's making too much energy. So it takes the extra energy and makes fat. The fat accumulates and ultimately interferes with the liver's function and can progress to cirrhosis with all its fun complications. I don't know of any major way NAC can prevent this.  NAC does have other real medical uses including Tylenol overdose by replenishing glutathione, but that is because Tylenol is broken down in a very different way. Another use of NAC is to thin the mucous of a patient with cystic fibrosis, again it does this by a different chemical reaction.   All in all most of the symptoms are due to dehydration and your best bet is to drink lots of water or gatorade (the sugar and salt help you absorb the water) and if you have access a banana bag via IV. The spins are another matter thought to be due to changes in the osmolarity/viscosity of the gyroscope like organ in you're ear, and since it equilibrates slowly you just gotta take it easy for a bit."

lifehacks,38qttr,2OQuestions,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:06:07 2015 UTC,"I am going to assume that you've contacted the manufacturer to see if they have replacement handles or suggestions. (If not, I'll wait while you do that.)   Presuming they were useless, or the new handle was a ridiculous price, here are some more ideas.   Here are a few processes that have helped me with sticky rubber. Make sure item is unplugged. Feel free to skip 1-2 and go straight to idea 3 or 4.   Idea 1: Easy, cheap, but ugly  http://www.bystephanielynn.com/2011/05/make-your-own-cast-iron-hot-handle-holders-and-how-to-layer-silhouette-heat-transfer-material.html  Idea 2: Easy, cheap, may also be ugly  http://www.lowes.com/pd_564442-43182-132901___?productId=50193607&pl=1&Ntt=deteriorated+rubber+replacement  Idea 3: using progressively harsher chemicals to get it as un-sticky as possible  First: take some rags (not paper-towels, the lint will just make the handle worse) and get them damp with water. Wrap around the handle and let sit for 3 minutes. Grasp towel around the handle and twist the entire towel back and forth a few time.  Examine for the towel for dirt (the more dirt the better, it shows that the handle can be cleaned). Repeat with new cloths until no more grossness comes off.  Let completely dry, and then check for stickiness. You may be ok at this point, or need to move on to step 2.  Idea 3, Step 2: Repeat the entire process with rubbing alcohol (the higher the percentage the better). Allow to dry completely between each step.   This will either make the stickiness much better, or possibly much worse. That's why it's important to check the dry handle between each step. Much of this depends on the composition of the rubber. I have had great success with rubbing alcohol  on the following item:  http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/store/product/chrome-swing-arm-slack-hanger/1010204917  Idea 3, Step 3 - repeat process using vinegar So far the first three liquids you've used are all compatible, so there is no problem chemically. This next step is going to be your final chemical step. Any other cleansers you add after this could react poorly and make the iron trash.  I don't know how the Goo-B-Gone would work as a surface for Ideas 4-6.  I would make sure as much as the GBG is removed as possible before moving on.   Idea 3, Step 4: Goo-B-Gone  Follow directions on the bottle. Again, use fresh clean rags for each application, allowing to dry & rinsing with water between each application. After the final step GBG application, you should wrap in damp towels, leave overnight, and make sure the GBG is completely removed.   Still sticky?  Idea 4: Rubber Spray  http://www.homedepot.com/b/Search/N-5yc1vZc8kf/Ntk-Extended/Ntt-rubber%2Bspray?Ntx=mode+matchpartialmax&NCNI-5  Idea 5: Use latex caulk  Sometimes called painter's caulk or acrylic caulk. Make several small layers over handle, letting dry completely between each application.  Idea 6: Sugru This is a fairly new product, so take the time to learn how to use it properly (watch videos on youtube), plus allow curing time 48 hours in a non-humid environment.   However, if this doesn't work, might as well just throw the iron in the recycling bin.   This item is available at most bigger hardware stores.   At this point, I am officially out of ideas.   I hope one of the above solutions work for you. I'd be interested to know which ones you did and what worked best."

I haven't ordered from David's Tea, but I've tried some of their stuff and have heard nothing but good things.  Also, if you have a local store that sells spices and things, try looking there.  They normally have a loose tea section and the prices normally aren't too crazy.  The advantage of that is you can normally open the containers and smell the tea before you buy it.

lifehacks,3868vr,AceHarding,-6,Tue Jun 2 06:18:07 2015 UTC,It'll be fine  Edit: I was making a bad joke. It will most assuredly not be fine
lifehacks,3868vr,nopooq,11,Tue Jun 2 12:09:24 2015 UTC,"OP said there was broken glass in it. OP also happens to be from NYC, where you probably do not want to be exposed to water when it's flooded. Raw sewage is dumped into the Hudson during heavy rainfall. Gross fun fact, if you stand by the Hudson in certain parts of Manhattan, you can see used tampons coming out of the pipes into the river. This sort of thing happens during rainfall. The combined sewage systems overflow and can't handle having to process water drained from the street drains AND the raw sewage from bathrooms, and so they end up dumping untreated sewage directly into the Hudson. It's been like this for at least a decade, I think, because I recall learning about it my high school (which is located by the Hudson, right next to one of the aforementioned tampon spewing pipes!)   During Hurricane Sandy, the Hudson flooded over, meaning much of that water was contaminated with raw sewage. It's not something you want to touch with your bare feet. Also, it's possible OP had a wound on his foot that could've gotten infected.   Some triathlons here involve people swimming in the Hudson River, which is totally nasty, but they still do it. I remember reading a news article a few weeks ago about a doctor who participated in one of these swims and ended up with a bilateral (both sided) ear infection afterwards. I remember reading an article about how a triathlon competitor saw a condom float by and still decided to jump into the river. Ugh.   tl;dr NYC's flood waters can be really gross. If OP was in NYC (which he coincidentally was) I can totally understand why he wouldn't want to go out in flooded water barefoot."

lifehacks,3846l3,redditex2,78,Mon Jun 1 18:57:05 2015 UTC,"30+ yr night shift worker here. It has been my experience that people are either ""night shift"" or not. Some folks simply cannot make the switch, and others think of day sleep as 'wrong' somehow. Lots of people also come to nights thinking that they can keep their same day schedule of errands and tasks and have a 'nap' later. Also, regular day shifty folks think you're just having a 'nap' during the day and don't recognize that it is your necessary sleep time and don't get not to disturb you. I have suggested that all important meetings be held at 3am since Admin is just having 'a little nap' before work anyway!  If you really want to switch to nights you're going to have some days that are better than others for sleep, just like when you were on days. It is ok and you won't  die. But you should make sleep your priority when it is sleep time. pick the hours and stick to them. DO NOT schedule doctor's app'ts, school stuff, important stuff during your sleep time.  Routines help, even if you're only going to get a shorter than usual sleep time, it is worth it to go through whatever go to sleep ritual you already have, shower, change clothes, feed the cat and send it outside, whatever you associate with sleep.  I've also found that  you cannot trick yourself into one way or the other, as in staying up tonight because i have to work tomorrow night. on my first night back after days off, i usually only get a couple hours sleep, but then sleep like a baby the next day. I go to sleep right after getting off work. others do better staying up a while. I wish you good luck! the world needs night shift workers!"

I have coworkers that pick up 3rd shift in addition to other jobs and come into work planning on catching 3-4 hours of sleep.  Then all the responsibilities fall on the staff that are awake.  It's really annoying but I've learned to deal with it because regardless of how many staff come and go this is always a problem.   I have suggested that all important meetings be held at 3am since Admin is just having 'a little nap' before work anyway!   Everytime I bring this up at my job people think I'm just complaining about nothing.  I made the same point about scheduling staff trainings at 3am and everyone laughed it off as a joke.  But I was trying to make the case for night shift to have the option to attend mandatory trainings during 3rd shift hours but my request fell on deaf ears.  This is upsetting because a lot of these trainings are scheduled during my routine sleeping hours that I need to maintain.  When we have these trainings I often go with as little as an hour of sleep for the day.   But you should make sleep your priority when it is sleep time. pick the hours and stick to them.   This is exactly what my doctor suggested.  She said do something right after work to avoid taking an exhaustion nap and then go to sleep at 3pm everyday.  Sometimes I just can't stay awake after work however and it throws my whole sleep pattern out of wack.  That's why I drink a small cup of coffee after work (in addition to the 3 cups I drink when I arrive at 11pm) to get me to 3pm but sometimes the caffeine keeps me up till 6pm.  But like you said, consistency is key, will definitely try to stay on top of that"

lifehacks,3846l3,thejustchad,3,Tue Jun 2 02:23:07 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about  everything.  I worked night shift for five years and loved it. The key to good, regular sleep is to pick a sleep schedule and stick to it, even on your days off.   I slept from noon till nine pm each day.

Compromise this at your own peril, and thn have no one to blame but yourself . Oh, but there are those emergencies and ,exceptions - 'Emergencies that would cause someone to wake you must be equal to large amounts of uncontrolled bleeding or flames of fire engulfing the housing. The type of qualifying emergency causing lost sleep would also be one  requiring not going in to work that night.  You cannot do all the things.   Even if working days this is true.  This tip will not be acceptable to many: keep the same schedule, I mean within one hour or so, same sleep /waking schedule on days off.    Working nights -in a way it's like selling  ones soul to the devil. There are reasons , even 'pros'. There's a bitter pay back as well, to the detriment of mental and physical health  Other adjustments help. The real damage I find, is in the switching back and forth."

Please search the net for parasympathetic nervous system and sleep, sympathetic nervous system and sleep, each of the nervous systems and food...and maybe after that check out people who wake up in their sleep paralyzed. That's because their parasympathetic nervous system is still telling their muscles their body is sleeping (relax, we're not running from predators or chasing prey, you don't need oxygen or energy, so go to sleep muscles, and let's lower your heart rate to coma levels). Meanwhile your conscious brain has decided to try and wake itself up, i think thats sympathetic.

In contrast, the duration of calculated and self-reported nighttime sleep decreased slightly (3.54 and 5.34 minutes per night, respectively) but significantly during the study.  Edit: I also feel like I should say I've smoked for 10 years to sleep. I feel like i fall asleep extremely eaisly, and I don't need a whole lot of sleep to be well rested. I usually am up very early in the AM because i wake up feeling well rested by like 7am, and can't lye in bed any longer."

I toss and turn for the rest of the night usually until 6am when i fall into a deep slumber until my alarm goes off at 7am. I find it impossible to get out of bed in the morning, I'll lay there for over 20 minutes until i absolutely must get out of bed or i'll be late for work.  In the last couple months, when i wake up in the night and can tell it's going to be a restless night, i'll get up and smoke a quick bowl and this will usually put me back to sleep for the remainder of the night. With this solution, though, i worry that i'm creating a 2am smoke habit and my body will start naturally waking up at 2am because i've been allowing myself to get out of bed for that smoke."

lifehacks,3846l3,mhy253,3,Mon Jun 1 22:17:26 2015 UTC,Try to put on a fan to drown out any noise. Try and block out as much light as possible. I sleep with the covers pulled over my head so it's easy for me
lifehacks,3846l3,Aillyn,5,Mon Jun 1 19:32:43 2015 UTC,"Well, some advices:   Don't let anything disturb you, that means light, sounds, pets, or whatever that can break your focus on sleep. Use earplugs, use black masks, close doors, shutdown your phone, etc... If you need to wake up and earplugs are interfering with your alarm, try a band with vibration alarm like ""Mi band"" http://www.amazon.com/Xiaomi-Bracelet-Wearable-Waterproof-Wristband/dp/B00R7J83TM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1433191472&sr=8-1&keywords=mi+band That band also can track your sleep so you can get accurate results of your experiments Please DON'T watch screens for 2 hours before sleep. I know nowadays sucks to be ""offline"" but try to read books or something that isn't to watch a luminous thing, that prevents natural segregation of melatonin so it's harder to sleep. Every doctor confirms it. The same goes with room light. Don't have bright light on your room. If you have regulated light it is best if you have a low light environment. If you don't have, try to be in your bedroom with a small low light lamp. Have a light dinner. Heavy dinners can give you stomach pains or bad digestions so it can interfere with your sleep. If you are hungry after the light dinner, eat a piece of fruit or have a tea. Don't eat sh** like pizza / burguer or something like that. Do excercise. You say you already do, but you don't have to do a heavy load to your body. Having long walks can be healthier than doing pushups or other hard sports. Make habits. Our bodys LOVE habits (tha'ts an example of why it is so hard to quit smoking), so try to be regular in everything you do among the day. If you walk your dog at 10 am, do it always at 10 am, not 9:30, not 10:30. Make sure you always do the same rutine at the same time each day, and most important, go to sleep at the same time every day. Try not to move on bed. To achieve this it is better if you are tired, so your body doesn't have the natural urge to move, but try to relax yourself. You can start with your legs, try to not move them for 5 minutes so they get ""sleepy"" and heavy to lift, and then try the same with your arms. When you are not into moving yourself anymore is when you already are in process. Try not to overthink the same thing when you are in bed. Sleeping is like an orgasm, if you focus on achieving it too much, you won't get it. So try to imagine things that you don't think when you are awake. Try to imagine a fantastic world, where the land is green, and castles float in the sky, or whatever pleases you. Try to be creative, but don't put too much effort, just let yourself go into the weirdness and fantasy and soon you will forget that you are trying to sleep. Schedule your bed time acording to sleep cycles and the time you need to wake up. A complete sleep cycle is 90 min, so you MUST sleep N cycle times. Those are: 90 minutes, 180 minutes (3 hours), 4 hours and a half, 6 hours, 7 hours and a half or 9 hours. If you awake in a middle of a cycle, you won't feel rested, and you will be tired in your entire day, and sleep will be harder in the night.   I hope it helps you :)"

Re  Regarding the light, it's hard to escape the Sun but I can get more light blocking shades and I definitely need to stop using electronic devices before I go to sleep.  I use the audio books when I find myself with ruminating thoughts in bed, most of the time it works but it still takes me a while to fall asleep.  I also need to get the habit of sleeping everyday at 3pm.  The problem is sometimes I have staff trainings and meeting in the late afternoon which throws everything out of sync, but not much I can do about that.  Fortunately that is only a couple times a month.  So not that big of a deal.

Doxylamine Succinate, which is a generic, gets you used to a good sleep mode, so after a few days, if you stop for a day or two, you'll still get good rest.  It is also inexpensive.  What I would not suggest are prescription sleep aids like Zolpidem, aka Ambien, Ambien CR, Intermezzo, Stilnox, Stilnoct, Sublinox, Hypnogen, Zonadin, Sanval, Zolsana and Zolfresh.  It messes around with an extremely powerful neurochemical called GABA, and is way more powerful than should be consumed casually."

lifehacks,3846l3,RowdyWrongdoer,2,Tue Jun 2 07:24:12 2015 UTC,"Simple rule for me is to minimise all sensory distractions:   Visual   No light in your eyes. Seal those windows and point the clock away from you. If necessary, wear a good sleeping mask that is contoured so it doesn't touch your eyelids.   Thermal   Warm bed and warm bedclothes - keep your feet warm. Being cold or too hot are sleep killers.   Auditory   No noise! Wear good ear plugs if necessary.   Tactile   No forced airflow over your exposed areas (face and hands).   Internal   Solve those hunger, toilet and libido issues well before bed. Well... the latter can wait for bed.  When in bed, you've got to do whatever it takes to get that brain of yours to stop thinking too much. Just remember that you will sleep - you can't avoid it.  As a prelude to actual sleep, I have found playing some mindless games like Solitaire on my phone when I get into bed can work. BUT ... don't play any game that gets you excited or anxious or requires you to think too much.  Another one that seems to work for me is to think of a technical problem that I have worked on previously and always came to a dead-end in solving (e.g. an algorithm for reversing a double articulated lorry). Since I know the problem is not solvable (by me), I can think about it in my cozy bed without getting anxious and it would be a bonus if I did solve it. I usually sleep within minutes. Probably a bit like counting sheep."
lifehacks,3846l3,Douche_in_disguise,2,Tue Jun 2 07:39:27 2015 UTC,"I currently use an eye mask, black-out curtains, a CPAP machine and a fan to make some background noise.  I've never had much of a problem sleeping through the day, but have found that when I work nights, setting my alarm to wake me after increments of 90 minutes has been very successful.  I work from 6pm to 6am and normally arrive home around 630am.  I generally am able to go right to bed, and 98% of the time am in bed by 7am.  I try to prep everything ahead of time such as making sure my bed is ready to sleep in and chores are done so that I don't have to worry about it when I arrive home.  Back to the 90 minute thing.  Having read somewhere many moons ago that our bodies run through sleep cycles that are more or less 90 minutes in length, I've tried to adapt my alarm to wake me in some fashion modeled on that.  If I know I'm going to get a full ""night"" of rest during the day, I will set my alarm for 7.5 hours after falling asleep as best I can.  Otherwise it's 6 hours, 4.5 hours or 9 hours.  I tend to function and feel the best when it's in that 6 hour window; less I can do, but if I sleep much more than that I tend to feel sluggish.  Other things that you can try to do would be to ensure that your room is as dark as possible, with no lights such as phone or computer LEDs visible at all and try not to let your eyes be exposed to sunlight or blue wavelength lights such as computers or tvs.  If you must do so, try to use a program such as f.lux on your computer or phone.  It will reduce the amount of blue light being emitted which contributes to telling your body that it's time to be up and about.  No booze though! That stuff is bad news."
lifehacks,3846l3,TheFightGoes0n,7,Tue Jun 2 13:16:26 2015 UTC,"i'm not sure what your trouble is exactly since you didn't bother posting your shift schedule.   i work 6pm to 6am, three nights a week. after work i come straight home and get into bed. i don't drink caffeine after 3am or so. i have blackout curtains in my bedroom. i have a quiet house. you can also use sleep masks or ear plugs. avoiding any light is important because exposure to daylight releases 'wakeup' hormones in the body. i try to get up at a consistent time in the afternoon, usually 2-3pm. no naps. on days i don't work i get up whenever and stay up lateish (3-4 am). usually i'm tired enough from a 12 hour shift that it's not an issue being tired after work.   things you might look at as issues for keeping you awake:  too much light  too much noise  screen time before you go to bed (same sort of light issues giving your body a wakeup signal)  napping during the day, so you're not as tired when you need to sleep  caffeine too close to your sleep time  staying awake after your shift instead of immediately going to bed  not keeping to the same consistent schedule even on days off can throw your body off rhythm  good luck. i've been working overnights for a while now, 2.5 years of rotating shifts (2 weeks dayshift and 2 weeks nightshift) and now about 9 months of straight weekend nights. my first year was really easy. my second year i was constantly tired. now i just don't get a lot of sleep overall but it works."
lifehacks,3846l3,emrcickray,4,Fri Jun 5 07:10:44 2015 UTC,I work 11pm to 7am and I also work lots of OT.  Screen time is probably one of my biggest problems.  I'm on reddit right now when I have to go to work tonight.  So that's a great tip.  I was using audio books to occupy my restlessness instead of browsing or watching tv.  Reading a hard copy book is also better than using a blue light device.  But another problem I have is the 2-3 hour sleep intervals and waking up wired & tired.

If you can't pull this off at your job, do it over the weekend.  Don't sleep, you need to trick your body's clock, and sleep deprivation is the best way to do that.   force yourself to stay up for 24+ hours (48 if your like me). Do not let yourself go to sleep until 2 hours b4 the time you set as your sleep time. The 2 extra hours is to make up for lost sleep, your time may vary. If you have any trouble going to sleep at the time you set use focused breathing and relaxation techniques. DO NOT give up and get out of bed. I used to use this to flip my schedule on my days off. When I go home from work on my last day I would just stay up that entire day and them pass out in the evening and get up when ever my body decided it has had enough sleep (unless it was like only 4 hours after going to bed)."

Then go to work staying up all day and the following day fall asleep right after work and wake up 2hr later.  It doesn't matter how tired I am, my body will not let me sleep past noon for some reason and then my sleep patters is all out of sync again.

No caffeine of any kind during the second portion of my shift (Not a coffee drinker anyway thankfully).  Dark curtains. Wash up for bed a little earlier instead of right before I went to bed. Lie in bed a little early even if I'm not super tired. I'd put on an hour+ long talk show (espn first take) -this would sometimes keep me awake because it was interesting but overall make fall asleep eventually. And when this all didn't work, contemplate shooting myself...   But honestly, it took a good 6 months to a year before I could consistently get into the pattern. I would try to fight the power sometimes by going out ""late"" at night and then hate work."
lifehacks,3846l3,AlternativelyYouCan,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:54:41 2015 UTC,"If I were you I would try to take a full day before going to work one night. Just get up at like 10 in the morning, go about your day, and then go to work. In my experience you should be tired by the end of your shift and you will be able to go home and go directly to bed. After that it should be easy to form the habit of staying up at night and sleeping during the day. You may have to work at it a bit, but I think that would probably help a little bit.   I only worked night shift for a few weeks, but it would be fairly easy for me to stay up through the night and sleep during the day."

(get these)  no light, possibly blackout curtains or sleep mask or both.    cold room if possible.  no caffeine.  eat when you wake up.  Don't eat just before you sleep.  Keep working at it until your body adjusts.  In bed on time, wake up on time, it may take a week or longer.   It probably will not work if you're constantly changing sleep/wake time.

If you want to regularly sleep during the day then you could try and gradually change the time you sleep. Try going to bed maybe 15-20 mins earlier or later every couple of days until you get to your desired sleeping time.

Lying down in bed while looking at screens for a while makes it harder to fall asleep.  Blue light from the screens also causes sleep disruption.

Once you've laid down, inhale slowly while counting to 5 in your head.  Hold it briefly and slowly exhale also counting to five.  You'll want to do this at least 20 times.   By the 5-7th rep, if you're doing it faithfully, you will notice two things:  one you'll start to get fatigued.  Two, you'll very likely get slightly aroused.  Once arousal happens, masturbate.  There is no greater sleep aid.   Note, I used to teach sexual health.  While I don't know you, chances are you're staying up from over caffeination and/or anxiety and this can help give you some relief.   Good luck OP."

I used it to help form sleeping habit to where I would feel tired at a certain point in the day, even when I didn't smoke.

I work at different times every day and for different shift lengths plus university. What I started doing was sleeping when I was tired and I stopped pressuring my body to obey my messed up schedule.  The first few days you might be groggy but eventually, you'll feel like falling asleep and then you'll sleep. Look up napping, find the right duration for your needs and try just grabbing sleep when you can.  Maybe working night means that you sleep two hours as soon as you get home and four hours before work."
lifehacks,3846l3,claymaker,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:40:36 2015 UTC,"Sleep naked. Seriously.  You notice everything so much more during the day, clothes and stuff just annoy you. Get cotton sheets, not nylon. You will end up sweating all day and it will make you cold and hot, which sucks.  Avoid ALL screens from the moment you finish work. This is very important for novice daysleepers. Electronics strain your brain and it will keep you awake during the day. Same goes for caffeine, Google Rooibos Tea in your area, it's caffeine free and tastes pretty good. Also, try to eat before you leave work, and avoid spicy food, or anything that is going to upset your stomach or wake you up to go to the toilet.  Yeah smoking weed is great, but some of us get drug tested. There are cheat products that do work sometimes, but cheating anything is always a risky gamble. I spent 12 years in road works doing all hours, the best advice I can give you is to go until you fall over. After a while, you stop caring about the daytime. Not great advice health wise, but it worked for me.   Good luck :)"

I was fortunate enough that my late night shifts were so tiring that I couldn't do anything but pass out by 10 am or so.  When I couldn't I would eat something.  I know its not healthy but it can help get you to sleep the first week or so till you get your rhythm.

lifehacks,3846l3,Lovehat,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:50:45 2015 UTC,"Hey man, IDK if I can help or not, but I consider myself to be a day sleeper by nature. I just prefer to be awake at night but I can adapt myself to either cycle.   When sleeping during the day, the most important thing is covering your eyes or eliminating the light source to the room. I will put a headband around my eyes, or the sleeve of a sweatshirt, or a pillow, whatever it takes to block out the light. Also if possible try to get some good shades on the windows.  Next step is, obviously, you have to be tired. To accomplish this, try and pull an all-nighter so that you've been awake for 24 hours. You will notice that you will sort of get a second wind for night 2 and when it comes time for you to sleep, you'll be tired enough to make it happen.  Then it's all about holding that schedule and after a little bit, your body's clock will sync up to compensate."

lifehacks,37yvv1,bloozntooz,11,Sun May 31 18:07:07 2015 UTC,"Just downloaded it, will I miss out on any website functionalities when I straight up block everything? I saw some trackers for stuff like facebook like buttons and that sort."
lifehacks,37yvv1,MasterFGH,36,Sun May 31 18:21:29 2015 UTC,Ive been using ghostery for about 3 months now. So far the only feature it blocked for me was the comments section on websites i dont care about. If it blocks something it will tell you 'Ghostery is blocking this. Click to unblock' the page will refresh and reveal content. Super easy and hassle free. Never had any issues with stuff i care about getting blocked.

lifehacks,37yvv1,Aspel,6,Mon Jun 1 11:36:37 2015 UTC,"Many! Basically, anything that blocks the behind-the-scene data gathering functions on websites or other things like advertisements without blocking the content you actually care about will also usually make pages load faster... because overall it's loading less things at once.  Here's a lifehacker article that includes lists of extensions that can improve speed by decreasing the loading.. er... load."
lifehacks,37yvv1,dweeceman,5,Sun May 31 21:02:46 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about this earlier when a site said I could download something sooner if I disabled adblock on that page. 90 seconds versus 1000 seconds. So I disabled it. I was then bombarded by ad after ad, none of them even real ads; they were all fake download buttons. I wasn't thinking and pressed the wrong one and ended up on a different site that wanted me to sign in. If I hadn't already known which site I was on and what I needed to do to get my file, I'd have probably ended up downloading something I didn't need or want, or that worse, harmed my computer.  My family members always ask me what can keep their computers from being shit--and I'm currently using my brother's old computer because my hardware broke, and it's slow as hell and has years of crap--and the answer isn't more and more virus blocker software like Avast or Norton. It's adblock. And not blindly agreeing to every additional download something asks for. Every time I get someone else's computer and see useless toolbars I die a little inside, and that's a problem I've never had even though I have less anti-virus software and spend more time interneting on more sites."

lifehacks,37yvv1,gent4you,11,Mon Jun 1 09:06:36 2015 UTC,Unbelievable. I just installed Ghostery and and can't believe how fast the Huffington Post loads now that I've tinkered a bit and blocked various trackers.

lifehacks,37yvv1,seropus,24,Sun May 31 17:27:27 2015 UTC,Websites give your Web browser cookies which let a website know where you go and what you do online. If your Web browser has a rule which refuses these cookies then you save time by not having to download them so pages load faster.
lifehacks,37yvv1,tyen0,7,Sun May 31 17:37:25 2015 UTC,Thank you so much! I appreciate you. Happy Sunday friend!
lifehacks,37yvv1,joshTheGoods,7,Sun May 31 19:35:15 2015 UTC,"Cookies are just a tiny snippet of text added as one of the http headers along with the rest of the web page.  They aren't a source of slowness.  What is going on is that sites link to tracking pixels (1x1 images) or snippets of javascript which are loaded from third party sites, and those involve an entirely new http request for each one which can indeed cause slowness."
lifehacks,37yvv1,Wartz,8,Sun May 31 20:30:18 2015 UTC,"Except that the pixels you speak of are loaded asynchronously. The ONLY way this helps with performance is if the JavaScript that fires off the pixels is slow, and with modern processors we're talking millisecond differences.   This entire thread is full of BS. If you want to measure first to last byte and call that performance, then fine ... but the reality is that time to interactivity and above the fold render time are what drive a person's perception of page load time."

lifehacks,37yvv1,BoboTheTalkingClown,3,Mon Jun 1 00:56:13 2015 UTC,"Use a blocker like uBlock. It blocks ads (and other stuff too). A lot of the bad JS is coming from ad networks.  To elaborate, uBlock uses the same blocklists as Adblock Plus, but is way more efficient on CPU and memory usage (memory goes up with Adblock!).

I recommend everyone try it, but notably Adblock Plus's memory and performance hit seems much more substantial for Firefox users.    And as blocking tracking, it should increase page load."

Cut up some used undies and use the wasteband!"" with no regard for how ridiculous that is. Or an infographic showing a common, accepted method on something niche like how to tie tiny bows. Or make wine.  But this is actually a good one, to me. The utility of it is immediately apparent, it's fixing one problem with a thing that's lying around, done and done. Maybe people are so used to being critical here (for good reason) that it comes naturally, but this thread is pretty much proof that even the rare actually good lifehack that isn't reposted once a month will still catch flak.  There are only two outcomes for any post here. If it's not a shitty lifehack, you're faced with the idea you're keeping company with hypercritical people who are too dim or belligerent or contrarian to appreciate something actually useful and off-the-beaten-path.

lifehacks,3807f2,The_camperdave,2,Mon Jun 1 10:03:58 2015 UTC,"Keep it simple. The main purpose of a power point is for a presentation.   Example. Power point slide on creating power points..   Don't: Slide 1 - You can save time creating your power point by only using key points in your text. You can also save time by using a font that is size 20 or greater. Calibri is a great font for text. This allows the audience to see the text clearly. You can also provide a picture that supports your slide, but don't forget to credit your source.    That same information can be put like this.   Slide 1 - (Title) Creating Power Points  (Text Box Left)                             (Picture Box Right)   Keep text to ""Key Point""               Use Size 20 Calibri Font               Include Pictures   (picture source. Small size)    The problem with the wall of text is when you present, you will end up reading word for word, which is bad. If you go off track and look away, it's hard to pick your spot back up again. Use your key points and know what they mean so you can look at it and then talk about it. The picture is more important than you think. Probably more important than the text. You want to audience to look at the graphic, which should support your slide topic, while you explain everything else using your main points. Plus, it takes up a lot of space. It's perfectly okay to have a slide with a full picture as long as it supports your overall theme.   Text size 20 for two reasons. It fills a page and that means less work for you. The second being it is big for the audience to read clearly, and also for the presenter. Some people get nervous presenting and not getting lost in text is important. Tip: Don't use bold too much. Doesn't really make things stand out. It just looks bad at times.  DON'T USE TRANSITIONS. click. click. click. click. You spend all that time clicking and then, boom, you go to the next slide because you couldn't remember how many times your were supposed to click. They are also messy, distracting, and time consuming.   Careful with colors. I know bright green can be fun, but it's hard to see. Same with dark on dark and light on light.   Colors can also be helpful. You can use red to represent bad, or blue for good. Things like that. Example - Power point on Viruses. Put that word with red text. And your next slide on AV scanners can be in blue. It's subtle, but it's a nice touch on a power point.   Those are my tips. Not really a lifehack. More of a formula, but when followed, you can create a very good power point.   Last pro tip to remember. If your doing this for a school project. Do whatever your instructor says. Make it look exactly how the instructor wants it to look like."

Laying a few thick blankets/duvet over the top of the mattress (under the fitted sheet) really helps with comfort. This is also really helpful if you pump the mattress up firmly and have the extra padding on top. It stops any cold air coming in from below and absorbs any night-time sweat as well.

If you can see any seams or folds then it isn't full enough. You'll also want to refill it the next time you use it, because it will lose air during the day. If you don't already have an electric air pump, you can find a cheap one for 20 bucks. I recall finding one in the camping section at Target.  If you're interested, you could try doing back stretches (or any stretching, really) in the morning and evening.

Find a good mounting point (i.e. a wall stud or door frame) and gingerly get in.  In a hammock you sleep off-center.  Your head will be at 2 o'clock and your feet at 8 o'clock.   (Or vice versa).

I think the idea of sealing a bag with a soldering iron is less useful than say, getting a package of ziploc bags or using one of the aforementioned $20 bag resealers in the other post.  But a hard cased, durable, water tight container for your important belongings that need to stay dry and protected?  That's useful to the right people and likely is something you can make at home.

lifehacks,37roae,BreezyMcWeasel,1 point,Sat May 30 05:09:15 2015 UTC,"With something like the Protecta LP Bait Station it's water resistant.   You open the lid, put the bait block in, close it, and place near where the activity is.  There are access holes for the rodent on the side.  Rain won't bother it.  Obviously,  if water rises it will get inside the station,  or float away, but rain itself is no issue.  There are other similar brands on the market,  but I've used the Protecta stations.    I recommend the rat size bait station because unlike traps size isn't as important.   A mouse can get into a rat bait station but a rat can't get into a mouse bait station.  That way you're covered for both.  Good luck!"
lifehacks,37roae,aqua_zesty_man,1 point,Sat May 30 14:14:25 2015 UTC,"Get some mouse traps, the kind that crush them across their back or neck, and bait them with peanut butter.  Set aside a small jar of PB and plastic disposable knife that you don't mind giving up, because you don't want to contaminate one of your regular knives with the contaminants the mouse will bring to the trap, and you don't want to contaminate and then eat peanut butter that's had the baiting knife in it. Mice like proteins but will also like sweet stuff too sometimes, the PB and Jelly mix might work too. Good traps will have a little bowl down in the center of the pedestal that sets off the trap. Don't leave too little bait that it won't be attractive, but don't smother the trap in PB either. If the mouse can nibble at the fringes and eat its fill without having to step into the trap and trigger it, then it won't be caught.  Leave your traps in the tight spaces where the mice will run and hide to escape the humans, canines, and felines that chase them, near holes in walls or floors where they get inside the house, and in any food storage spaces."

lifehacks,37roae,Chandyside,1 point,Mon Jun 1 02:14:18 2015 UTC,"Its recommended t put traps along walls as mice don't usually venture away from them to often. Peanut butter is defo the best thing t use. We had a couple of mice recently and they love the stuff. After a few unsuccessful attempts we selotaped the trap down as they kept on setting the traps off unharmed and nicking the peanut butter.... don't do this! Came down one morning and poor ol mousey brown was in the trap but not dead :( Think cus the trap didnt jump it didnt have enough force. We released him and he'd seemed t have lost the ability t walk in a straight line, he could only go left or right, felt so bad f him. Humane traps are a waste of time, mice didnt go anywhere near it and wed left a right feast f em. The best ones are the ones that have an inny bit f the bait as they have t properly get on the trap t get to it.  If you don't know if you have mice probably best not t put too much bait out or you'll be encouraging them. Mice hate the smell of mint aswell as cat and snake urine. Peppermint oils cheap enough. Mix it with water and spray it around the outside of your house t keep the pesky critters away or ask a cat owning friend f some used cat litter and put it under/around your house."

Cause that's exactly what people who put a small amount of weed in cigarette pack cellophane have been doing for years.  No soldering iron necessary.  This video is kind of absurd.

Dicking around with a nut and bolt to remove a bolt is silly and wont work in tight spaces, recessed bolts, or on nuts.   Go buy 10 adjustable wrenches and keep them in various places,  or even better spend the 40$ on a set of wrenches and a tool roll and make sure your wrenches always make it back into the roll.

Make a Spanish omelette or  Spanish Tortilla in 15min  Fry an onion in a medium pot with 2 table spoons of olive oil until softened and almost brown then transfer oil and onions to a bowl   When onions/oil is no longer super hot ,add and mix 5 eggs and a bit of salt and some pepper with a pinch of paprika   Then gently fold in the chips(crisps) until they are in the mixture and starting to get soggy.   Get pot ready by adding 2 tablespoons of olive oil to the pot and heating on high then lowering to medium.  Add mixture and cook (constantly agitating and checking the omelette)until you are happy the bottom is done , the top should still be wettish.   Now you need to flip it to give it 2 minutes on the other side.  I put a plate over the pot and turned it upside down then I flipped that onto the pot lid and put it carefully back on the pot.

lifehacks,37gwmj,greggerypeccary,3,Wed May 27 15:27:22 2015 UTC,Whoa your kitchen was retrofitted into a double closet. That's pure insanity. How do you even get the far cupboard under the sink open?!? I came in here expecting to see some just-about-manageable galley kitchen...not Harry Potter's stair cupboard after he got done with the renovations.  Could you put something in place of that entertainment center to expand your cupboard/counter space? I'm thinking ask the folks over in /r/woodworking for some help attaching and bracing a simple wooden countertop overtop of some low-cost cupboards and placing it along the wall in front of that window.
lifehacks,37gwmj,jingerninja,0,Wed May 27 17:50:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah this is kitchen is definitely the smallest I've ever encountered by a wide margin, it's almost comical (NYC real estate can sometimes require big sacrifices). As for the doors under the sink the right one opens all the way but not the left, but I can live with that.

You'd have to put not-often-accessed things in that glass-fronted cabinet to avoid the hassle of always having to move the rack.  Do you live alone? Alternatively you could rustle yourself up an SO and set them to work drying dishes as you was them. Just be prepared for the inevitable ""You don't really love me, you're just using me for my dish-drying"" argument...  EDIT: There are also things like this which go in/over the sink for drying. You'd just need to put the dishes on a towel or microfibre mat on your island until you drain the sink before you can load them into the rack."

I can't recommend it enough for anyone with a small kitchen."
lifehacks,37gwmj,philthadelphia,2,Wed May 27 17:07:34 2015 UTC,"The first thing would be to get a thin bookcase, that continues the wall on the right but has storage space.  Remove the small brown table and put your kitchen cart there.  Put a lot of thought into what style of kitchen cart you want.  You might use a smaller kitchen cart to take your meals from the kitchen area to the dining area.  Potential problems with having a wall outlet over your stove, plus a lack of any vent for smoke."
lifehacks,37gwmj,hasjuitprincipe,2,Wed May 27 18:27:29 2015 UTC,"Here are some of the best suggestions I could think of:   Listen to everybody else and get yourself a kitchen cart. They may cost you some money but it will be well worth it. You can leave it posted up in front of the window and roll it out when you need it for much needed countertop space. Add a magnet bar across the front of your cabinet like this for knives and cutlery. If you make 2 rows then you can use one for chopping knives and one for forks, spoons, and eating knives. Get yourself some wicker baskets like these. Make sure that they fit above your cabinets where you should store them to save yourself a ton of space. That way you can keep pantry items like pasta, sauce, canned veggies, soups, etc... in the baskets and when you need something, just pull the whole basket down, take out what you need and put the rest back. This also means that you will probably need a folding step ladder. Take measurements of your range and go get yourself a butcher's block or a cutting board that fits over the entire range. Boom...you have no doubled your usable space when the range is not in use. When you do need to use the range, just remove the cutting board and put it above the cabinets. Get yourself a wall mounted paper towel holder. No need to keep things on the counter that can very easily go on the wall.  USE THE DRYING RACK PROVIDED! I understand that it may not be what you are used to, but that is what is there for! There really is no need to keep more than 4 plates, 4 bowls, 4 glasses, and 4 sets of silverware. Even that may be too much as judging by the size of your kitchen, chances are you are not throwing any dinner parties any time soon. Only keep what you absolutely need. This goes for pots and pans too. At most you need one large pot for spaghetti and/or soup and a frying pan for eggs, etc... You also have a ton of space on the wall above the kitchen on the outside. Put up some shelves and use that space! There are a number of workarounds to everyday appliances that make life in a small space simpler. For example, instead of a drip coffee maker, get yourself a cone filter and a multipurpose electric kettle. Instead of a microwave, use the oven you have to make toast or warm up a frozen dinner. Instead of buying bottles of soda, get yourself a soda stream.    It is important to remember that lifestyles change based on locale. Sometimes that means adjusting how you live to the area you are in. People in your situation do not keep more than 2 or 3 days worth of food in the house at once. Food preparation is kept to a minimum and needs to be kept very simple. Sometimes the added expense of going out to eat is just part of the NYC package. I understand that going out to eat can get expensive and that is absolutely true but there are ways around that. Find the cheap places to get consistent food, they definitely exist in NYC, it just takes some time to find them.  Good luck!"

lifehacks,37ctz6,TotesHuman,97,Wed May 27 00:14:20 2015 UTC,"I used to sell cars and we did this all the time. Before we got someone into the booth, we make sure they committed to ""buy and drive home today"" if we could work out the terms. We'd have to isolate their objections to find out what their real objection was and then overcome it (you only want red? We have a red car on another lot).  Then when you get them into the booth and hit them with the ""4 square"". This is a sheet of paper with four squares on it. In those four squares:  Price of the car | What we'll pay for the tradein -----------------+------------------------------- Monthly payment  | Down payment   So we always put the full price of the car, even if there was a discount. If the trade-in was worth $5,000, we'd list it as $1,200. If the monthly payment should be around $300, we'd list $725. And we'd always ask for 1/3rd down. The 4 square would look like this:  $18,000 | $1,200 --------+-------    $725 | $6,000   At this point, the customer is shocked as hell, and maybe a little scared. They're thinking they can pay maybe $200 a month with $1,000 down. Not realistic, but neither were our numbers.  We'd then cross out the price of the car and give them a small discount.  $17,250 | $1,200 --------+-------    $725 | $6,000   We often showed that ""discount"" up front. And whenever they would argue one of the squares, we'd bounce around from square to square and completely confuse the hell out of them. And we would never discuss interest rates ... for a good reason.  So that car, at 4% interest, with no money down, is going to be around $331 a month over five years (assuming their credit was good enough). If they put $4,000 down and argue $2,000 for the trade-in, we'd be at $220 a month payment, but we're starting at $725 a month and then they start haggling like mad on the monthly payment.  In reality, we had to underpay for the trade-in because we had to clean it up, inspect it, and hope to make a profit on it. You should sell your trade-in outright rather than use it at a car dealership. You'll get a better deal on your trade-in and it makes the numbers on the four square simpler.  Interestingly, customers tended to focus on only one or two numbers and not all four. So let's say they really only have $1,000 for a downpayment, they might have the four-square looking like this on the final deal:  $16,900 | $1,500 --------+-------    $315 | $1,000   At this point, maybe we find out from the car company that they'll only do 5% over 5 years for this customer. That's about $271 a month in payments. But we got them to agree to $315. We want that damn money, so we get them agree, and then take them to the finance manager. He's got a pre-approved 5 year loan at 4%, but he tells the customer that actually, there's been a slight mistake in calculating payments and actually the customer is only paying $285 a month, not $315.  At this point, the customer is so grateful to the finance manager that they don't pay attention to the fact they they're paying 7% interest. They never knew we were told 5% interest, so we charge 7% and keep the extra money. That's one way that a car dealership can sell you a car ""at invoice price"" and still make a tidy profit off of you.  And buy (sic) the way, that $5,000 car that they got you to agree to part with for only $2,500? They're putting it on the lot for sale at $9,995. If you're a car salesman and you know your shit, the real profit is in used cars, not new.  That's what ""anchoring"" can do for you by setting the customer up with completely unrealistic expectations of what's going on. Further, with the complications of dancing around the four squares (I once saw a guy agree to pay an extra $2,000 for cloth seats that were standard on a car), you often forget that your bank can get you a better deal, or you don't even realize that the interest rate you're paying is highway robbery.  Personal note: why did I get into such an unethical industry? I had a medical condition that could be fixed with a simple surgery, but was potentially lethal if left untreated. I took a job as a salesman because at the time, it was the only work I could get that offered medical insurance. Once I qualified for the insurance, I had to wait a year before my pre-existing condition clause no longer applied. I quit immediately after the surgery and then declared bankruptcy for all of the medical bills my insurance didn't cover.  There's more information here, but the figures are ""kinder"" than what my dealership offered.  And my favorite deal as a car salesman? A guy drove up in a battered Gremlin, plastic covering the rear window, no reverse gear, and so on. He credit was so bad he couldn't buy the steam off a hot dog (he was a ""roach"", in car sales parlance). We had a salesman I called ""twitchy"" because he was always so strung out, but he was a damned fine salesman. Twitchy explain the guy's credit to him, but made him a deal. We'd buy his car for $500 (it wasn't worth a nickel), fix the brakes, the window, and so on, and sell it back to him for $5,000 and let him make payments to rebuild his credit so he could pay it off and come back and buy a real car.  That's right: we got the guy to agree to buy his own car for $5,000. Management shut the deal down because it was illegal, but the salesmen had a real laugh over that one.  TL;DR: Car salesmen are bastards.  Update: Fix some tyops (sic)."

lifehacks,37ctz6,mehuiz,1 point,Wed May 27 20:53:56 2015 UTC,"This video is great and applicable in almost every negotiating situation.  There is one slight flaw, however.  When it says to always start with an offer so that you anchor, this is true when you know the range of which the negotiation will be around.  However, it could backfire if you don't know the other person's information well enough.    Example:  You want to buy something but won't pay more than $100.  You may think to start at like $70 and go up from there....but what if the seller was willing to take $10 and would have initially asked for $20?  This is why asymmetric information in negotiations is so powerful.  Just yesterday I sold a service for $5000 when I went into the conversation thinking $2000 would be the most I could get.  I prodded for some info and saw that they were thinking a much larger number, and so I gave it to them.    Again, great video.  Highly recommend anchoring in a negotiation, just do your research beforehand to not anchor against yourself."

lifehacks,37bcn7,bund333,0,Tue May 26 14:25:21 2015 UTC,"That might be true if the battery isn't charged. Volts are just a marketing ploy for measuring power tools. They don't tell you anything about the true power (IIRC it's called potential energy) of the battery. It's all about the current as well as the volts. I'm no expert but here's what I know:  A typical 12v NiMH battery (which is a type that is frequently used in cordless power tools) usually has somewhere between a 4C and 7C rating.see note That 4C means that the battery can put out 4 times the capacity of the battery. The capacity is usually measured by amp-hours and tells you how long the battery will last from a given charge. We can use the capacity to determine the current. The DeWalt 12v DC9071 battery has a 1.5AH capacity.  So we have 12v, 4c, and 1.5AH for a little battery that fits in the handle of your drill.  4c * 1.5AH is 6 Amps.  That's the 1/3 of the amount of current from most household power outlets. It takes just 0.2 amps to stop your heart (granted, you need the contacts to be near your heart). Additionally, the drill in the gif is a 19.2v Craftsman drill which could potentially have more current than the 12v battery I am mentioning.  So, lick it and tell us what happens.  note: This is typical but not always the case. It can vary from manufacturer to manufacturer.  Edit: put 10c when I meant 4c in the equation"

lifehacks,37bcn7,waitwuh,2,Tue May 26 16:18:49 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but as an EE this is a common misconception and a dangerous one. While it is in fact the current across your heart that will lead to your death the current is determined by the voltage and the resistance of the path the electricity take through your body. The max current that the drill's battery can discharge is really not relevant because that current could only be reached with a very small resistance across the battery terminals.Yes a 12V 1.5AH 7C battery can be discharged at upwards of 10 amps (this is largely determined by the battery internal resistance) however for this amount of current to be discharged there would have to be close to zero resistance. There are a lot of factors that determine the resistance across two parts of the human body but even worse case with wet skin its usually a few thousand ohms. Using I =V/R, 12V /1000Ω = 0.012A this would be painful but for a healthy person definitely not lethal. Voltage is generally most important factor to consider when looking at the lethality of electronics. Here is a pretty good explanation of the misconception for those that are interested. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xONZcBJh5A"

lifehacks,37bcn7,whatisupdoge,1 point,Wed May 27 02:54:51 2015 UTC,"You can safely touch a car battery and you wont feel a thing. Haha this doesn't mean to go poking around your car's battery and electrical system. The ignition system the battery is connected to can supply 1000s of volts and easily kill you. I will say I have 12V lipo batteries for my quad copter capable of delivering 100+ amps and I can touch the terminals no problem. It's really is the voltage that's dangerous and it all comes down to. The exception to this being things such as static shocks which can be tens of thousands of volts but they only have enough energy to supply current for a fraction of a fraction of a second, an amount of time so small it's not dangerous. The real danger with high current discharge batteries is if you short them. If you do there's  a good chance of them catching fire or exploding violently.   TLDR: V=IR, a human can safely touch a 12V car battery."

lifehacks,37g7bl,Germerican,3,Thu May 28 10:38:21 2015 UTC,"I can't believe I have to explain this.  Car rubber/vinyl/plastic is sensitive to UV light, that comes from from the sun.  The sun will destroy a dashboard and steering wheel over time, regardless of how many revolutions the odometer makes.  This is especially true in older cars that do not have UV protection in the windsheild (or windscreen)."

lifehacks,379sgs,Jordantylerg,31,Tue May 26 01:03:40 2015 UTC,A lot of pills are time release chewing them is a bad idea. They need to digest at a reasonable rate. Thick liquids will help wash it down. But for those that own pets know wrap it in a pepperoni or a slice of cheese and carefully chew your body will do the rest. Go get a frosty or any other shake the straw will help.  Eventually you can switch to milk and then water. Good luck.

Not sure what meds you have, but there are some drugs classes like tetracyclines or fluoroquinolones for bacterial infection that shouldn't be taken with calcium containing foods/drinks like milk cause it may reduce absorption of the drug. In short, check the instructions that came with the pills to see if it's safe to take with dairy products. :D"

lifehacks,379sgs,just_another_reddit,7,Tue May 26 02:32:12 2015 UTC,"Hello!  Firstly, you're not alone. There are dozens of us. Dozens!  For me, I finally overcame it by practicing with Tic Tacs. I recommend this method too, because if you only have pills once in a while then even a victory can be seen as a one off. If you can do it with 5 tic tacs in a row then you've got it down.  The first thing is having the right amount of liquid in your mouth. Too much and you won't be able to swallow it easily in one gulp, too little and the pill won't float in it. So get that down.  Secondly, most people who struggle with it tip their heads back when they're doing it - But usually this is wrong. If the pill floats, you should tilt your head forwards so the pill floats to the back of your throat and goes down early, not left in your mouth when all the water has gone.   Thirdly, recognise that it's psychological - Because it is. You can do this. You swallow larger bits of food than that all the time, but I understand that it feels out of your control. It still does for me too, my mouth is always like ""Hey, we should chew/taste this before we swallow it!"". The way I overcome this psychological effect is by having the pill float in a position where I can't really feel it in my mouth anymore.   Start practicing and good luck - You can do it, loads of people have this issue and it can be overcome."

Try not to think about the pill but just chug whatever you are drinking until you feel that the pill went down.   So be sure to give yourself a decent sized glass of whatever cause it might take drinking a few ounces to get it down.

Since you are young but not a child no need to go straight to the applesauce thing yet. First things first take it with a fairly large amount of water. Second when you put it in your mouth put it as far back on your tongue as you can (you are a young teen Im not too afraid that you are going to choke (aspirate) on it like I would with younger or much older patients). When you have it on the back of your tongue dont put small sips of water in your mouth put a really big gulp of it and just try to swallow it in as large of gulps as you can with your chin pointing forward and kind of upward (not at the ceiling). This should do the trick, but if you still cant do it, then consider crushing it with some kind of small amount of applesauce, but make sure that the pill is not time release or enteric coated (just call your pharmacist to find out) first, if it is then you gotta go back to the first method and try try try again."

As the saliva passes over your tongue, there should come a point where the pill gets caught in it, and the tongue helps push it all back. Once it reaches the throat, do not do anything. Just keep swallowing."

If the pill doesn't have any 'coating' the taste will be awful.  Put pill on tip of your tounge, careful dont let it fall out of your mouth or under your tounge, then drink some water, not too much, just what you need, then swallow. You can practice with small amount of (chewed) food.  Im not a professional (read doctor), just this worked for me."

lifehacks,379sgs,bandalooper,1 point,Tue May 26 08:56:08 2015 UTC,"Listen to me buddy. I hated taking the smallest of small pills for my whole life but somewhere in my teenage years I had to start taking bigass pills. Probably 2 centimeters long. I came across this guide that is the best shit I've ever found.  THE ULTIMATE pill SWALLOWING GUIDE   Fill a glass of water. Take a sip of water and hold it in your mouth (about so much it fills up to your bottom lip when you tilt your head back but you could keep your mouth open if you want to). Put the pill in the water that's in your mouth and close it. Slightly tilt your head down. Yes this will feel weird the first times but just trust me on this one. Don't listen to the people saying you should tilt your head up. It sucks. Also don't listen to people who tell you that you should take the pill in a bite of food, it's disgusting.  Start drinking the glass of water and the pill will just go with the flow. Make sure to drink atleast more than half a glass so the pill doesn't get stuck anywhere on the way down.   Try this and reply if it worked or not. This is important because if people see that many others has said it works they might try it themself too. Good luck!"

Some tricks that worked for me:   Put the pill on your tongue and take a drink (about 2 oz) and try to tilt head back a bit and just immediately swallow as the water goes in- like taking a shot.   Don't try in front of a mirror. For me it just adds to the anxiety.   The longer you hold the pill and water in there, the harder it is to finally swallow.   Keep another glass handy in case you are able to partially swallow pill but need a bit more to get it down.   My last resort is similar to what I e done with pets. Put pill in a spoonful of cottage cheese, yogurt, pudding or similar and swallow without chewing."

Get all sides of the pill wet (either with saliva or with some water) and it will slip down your throat like anything else you have ever swallowed in your entire life.   Pills are hard to swallow because they are dry, and since you don't chew them, they don't get a chance to get wet in your mouth via saliva. Consequently they will tend to stick or feel like they are sticking to your throat as you swallow them. If you just lubricate it with some saliva, it'll go right down.  If it's wet on all sides, it's no different than anything else you've ever swallowed."

lifehacks,377enz,lvcablines,1 point,Tue May 26 04:55:32 2015 UTC,"In most. OP is suggesting asking the driver to go behind the back of the company owner, and possibly the city, too.  Cab drivers don't make a lot of money and their job is physically very risky. This is asking them to take some risks to save you cash, possibly at the cost of their livelihood. Those other taxi drivers that won't do this? They value their job."
lifehacks,377enz,kerklein2,8,Tue May 26 02:29:42 2015 UTC,"had to double check, thought this was /r/ShittyLifeProTips   if you need to be somewhere dont risk it.  you ask how much it is, ill tell you-  I have to go by the meter, and its around $20 to the airport. ask for a flat rate, i'll tell you $100.  Try to haggle on the price more, i'll leave you there.  people who try to save 10% have been unpleasant in the past, so i dont take them.  the ticket for getting caught not running the meter is $100. and doubles each time after until the 5th when they pull the permit.  i have an average to maintain, the company keeps a % of the meter.  Some other cities the driver gives the company $100/day.  if you genuinely cant afford the full amount. I might help you out."

lifehacks,377enz,talkb1nary,2,Tue May 26 13:11:30 2015 UTC,"This seems more like a /r/frugal kind of thing. Haggling with a taxi driver before you get in is standard procedure in large parts of the world. In countries where it's not, you're asking the driver to take a risk with their livelihood, which is why the first few reject you.   A real LPT would be ""before taking a cab, check the Uber rate to see if it's less than 1.3x. If it's higher, use your phone to get the shortest directions to your destination. Be nice to your driver and ask how their day has been going and how long they've been driving for."""

I see a lot more where the size of the bar is small so the hanger wouldn't work for home, or where it disconnects from the bar where you couldn't use it at home because the hook doesn't come with it, but neither affect this hack. Only when the hanger is fully attached, which is out there, but not prominent from my experience."

lifehacks,36ztj5,NNYPhillipJFry,2,Sat May 23 23:04:16 2015 UTC,"The point is, like I first said, the USGS takes local geomagnetism into account when producing the declination for their maps and you can correct that on the compass.    Compasses can be thrown off my geomagnetic storms and GPS can be inaccurate around asphalt parking lots, urban areas, or flat water. It is just a pedantic argument. A majority of compass users don't need to worry about local geomagnetic anomalies. People who are outside relying on a compass should know how it operates and functions. They should know not to be around steel vehicles, or trekking poles or steel framed packs. They should also know if their compass is acting weird. The Earth has a geomagnetic range of 25k-65k nT.

lifehacks,36ztj5,lardlung,18,Sat May 23 22:42:41 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about tip #50 (which is pic #32) it says ""washing soda,"" not ""cleaning soda.""  And washing soda is not baking soda. They're similar / related, but they are two different products. Washing soda is sodium carbonate, and baking soda is sodium bicarbonate. Washing soda is the sodium salt of carbonic acid, and it has a higher pH than baking soda. Meaning it is more alkaline.   You can buy gigantic boxes of the stuff at the store.   You can also actually convert baking soda (NaHCO3) Into washing soda (Na2CO3) by heating it.

lifehacks,36ztj5,bruwin,8,Sat May 23 23:03:01 2015 UTC,"That form is actually very common in ancient inscriptions and texts. Usage of roman numerals was never very consistent and only relatively recently have IV, IX, CM etc become universally accepted as the 'correct' way to write these numbers."

It's a stylistic preference likely adopted for the sake of symmetry and creative license. My favorite theory is:   Using IIII may have also made work a little easier for certain clock makers. If you're making a clock where the numerals are cut from metal and affixed to the face, using IIII means you'll need twenty I's, four V's, and four X's. That's one mold with a V, five I's, and an X cast four times. With an IV, you'd need seventeen I's, five V's, and four X's, requiring several molds in different configurations.    More theories, some less likely than others at this source."

lifehacks,36wmut,erusso,1 point,Sat May 23 03:30:41 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'm gonna be ""that guy"" for a moment, so bear with me.   Flake food is dangerous for some fish unless you sink them. Floating foods of any kind are not a great idea for many species because the fish will grab air as well, and many of them are incapable, or at least have trouble getting the air out. This can cause problems and eventually lead to a belly up fish. It's most commonly seen in pet goldfish. Flakes also cloud up the water more compared to pellets.  The trick is to take the lid of the fish food container (or really any small thing like a bottle cap), put some water in it, put the fish food in it, and let the flakes get a little wet before you put them in."

If the scratches are too deep for plastic polish, a cream based auto finish restorer like ColorBak might work (test on underside first!), but DON'T use automotive rubbing compound, which is too abrasive for plastic.  Alternately, if you have access to an electric drill, you can try to buff them out with a lambswool buffing pad. Practise briefly on the base to get your technique down."
lifehacks,36rvqc,theartfulcodger,3,Thu May 21 17:52:13 2015 UTC,"Novus is the right way to fix it. Novus 3 is a rough scratch remover. Novus 2 is a fine scratch remover, and Novus 1 is a polish/cleaner.  I suggest using Novus 2, and follow it up with Novus 1. Even if the scratch doesn't disappear, it will look better.  If you start with Novus 3, it will be a lot of work to get it back to a gloss, but you may be able to remove the scratch completely. The challenge is that without experience, you might make it look worse."

lifehacks,36rvqc,_somebody_else_,3,Thu May 21 17:31:29 2015 UTC,Toothpaste. It is a mild abrasive and if your laptop shell is made of polycarbonate you can gently buff the scratch out (depending how deep it is of course).  The plastic polishing compounds you can get will have the same effect.

lifehacks,36kn0j,scenecunt,10,Wed May 20 14:58:41 2015 UTC,We don't really use kegs in the UK apart from in actual pubs. At parties everyone just truns up with their own cans or bottles. But the idea of drinking beer out of a plastic cup just seems a bit weird.

lifehacks,36kn0j,scenecunt,7,Wed May 20 11:51:50 2015 UTC,"I've nothing against them, i've just always noticed them in american movies and stuff. in the UK I usually just drink beers straight from the bottle or if drinking spirits I prefer to use an actual glass."
lifehacks,36kn0j,butthead,17,Wed May 20 14:12:52 2015 UTC,"As an American, it just seems a weird question. It's like me asking you why your country uses white or clear cups.   But to answer your question, we don't always use disposable red plastic cups. Stores actually sell them in a variety of colors. Often clear, white, red, blue or patterned. And a variety of materials including soft plastic, hard plastic, foam and paper.   Not sure how it is in the UK but in the US, house parties can be pretty large. Most people don't have 50+ drinking glasses in their houses, so cheap disposable cups are usually bought. Also it helps prevent drunk people accidentally breaking your glassware. So disposable cups often seem like the obvious choice here.  As for ""why red""? Well, often they're not red in real life. Again, we might use cups with variety of colors or patterns. If they're usually red in movies that's probably because first of all the red is opaque so all the cups on the movie set could be empty and you wouldn't know the difference. That makes managing the props of the movie set much easier. Finally, red ""reads"" better. It instantly lets the audience know that there's alcohol in that cup. So it's less ambiguous than, say, a white foam cup, which could just as well be coffee or water or tea or something else."
lifehacks,36kn0j,tableman,2,Wed May 20 09:27:16 2015 UTC,"Damn dude, you wrote broke it down all the way..."
lifehacks,36kn0j,butthead,7,Wed May 20 09:39:20 2015 UTC,"Hell, I could keep going. I didn't even address some points, but fuck it, why not:   ""In the UK I usually just drink beers straight from the bottle...""   People aren't pouring beer bottles into cups. Cups are generally used for beer kegs. Are keggers not a thing in the UK?   Also it's good to have around cups anyway so guests (such as children, non-drinkers, or designated drivers) can also have something to drink out of. Getting disposable cups just streamlines and simplifies the headache of dealing with drinking vessels at parties. You'd think that's a given, but I guess different cultures?  Also college kids like the red party cups because they're the de facto standard for the drinking game ""beer pong"". Though again, they're not necessarily red.   Finally, going back to the movie thing (the main source of this red cup confusion), drinking from cups means filmmakers don't have hide or remove labels, use goofy made-up brands, or seek permission to use a real brand. Which is something you'd have to deal with if they wanted to use bottles or cans.   TL;DR - Fictional movies aren't an accurate depiction of real life; red plastic cups aren't as ubiquitous at American parties as you may think."

lifehacks,36gy1x,brygphilomena,24,Tue May 19 18:03:29 2015 UTC,"It has long been rumored whether or not semen, precum, or any other bodily fluid that is ejaculated from a male during orgasm is reactive to Ultraviolet light. In order to verify or disprove this claim I designed a test. It is understood that ejaculate is a liquid solution upon release of the male's penis. However, we could not conclude the UV reactivity of the ejaculate in just one state. Therefore, it was decided that I had to test the reactivity under both conditions. First in its liquid solution state and then again after it had dried. Conclusion of this test resulted in denial of the claim of ejaculates ability to react with ultraviolet light.  To begin, I precured some rather risque study aids, a small bottle of lubricant, and an Ultraviolet light. I turned down all other sources of light to allow the highest chance of detecting UV reactivity. I proceeded to study these aids while gently massaging my penis until I had orgasmed and ejaculated. Immediately so as not to spoil the source of our intrigue I shined the ultraviolet light onto the ejaculate to no result. To facilitate the drying of the ejaculate and advance the wait until I could test the second state of the ejaculate I wiped up excess ejaculate with a towel. After approximately 30 minutes the ejaculate was dry. I then again shined the ultraviolet light onto the ejaculate. Again, there was no result.  Therefore it was concluded that without any additional chemical or aid semen, precum, cum, or any ejaculate from the male's penis during orgasm does not glow or react to ultraviolet light."

lifehacks,36gy1x,burnt1ce85,18,Tue May 19 22:42:45 2015 UTC,"Forensic analyst here.  This won't work with most lights as they won't produce enough UV light in the first place.  Unless the LEDs on certain smartphones are very broad-spectrum (which...maybe they are because of CCD sensors?), this doesn't make sense.  The idea of filtering out the rest of the light is useful but only if there's lots of UV to begin with.  There are devices called Crimescopes (or something like that) that use filters like this but it's a filter applied to a special light source.  Let's try it with various smartphones and post the result here.  In theory, there could be a few that work.  Didn't one manufacturer actually have a Xenon-based flash coming out on a new model of their phone?  Also, most bodily fluids do show up with a black light even without luminol or bluestar.  The color comes from flavin (derivative of riboflavin), not directly from phosphors or trace hemoglobin (but bluestar will fluoresce hemoglobin).  And, by the way, I've used UV lights in hotel rooms before...yeah...you probably don't want to know."
lifehacks,36gy1x,akiva23,14,Tue May 19 15:01:35 2015 UTC,I call bullshit on this article. I highly doubt that you can produce UV light by shinning light into a blue marker.
lifehacks,36gy1x,TheGrog1603,2,Tue May 19 20:54:35 2015 UTC,The blue marker won't. But if your led produces a wide enoguh spectrum (which admittedly i have no idea about) then the uv light is already there the markers just filter out the rest of the light so only the uv passes through. You can make an an ir filter in the same way using exposed film or the disk inside a floppy.  I wonder if this will work on the windows in my house?

Hope you don't mind helping me out? Ok, first, I'm assuming I can download the app for iPhone for free. Now, from there is a ""subscription"" or ""monthly plan"" required - I keep seeing info about that? Or is that just an optional way to use it? I do not want to pay for anything like that.

Signing up for the subscription gets you 1 credit a month for $14.95/month. If you listen to more than 1 book a month, there are more expensive plans that get you more monthly credits. You don’t have to use the credits each month though and can bank them until you’re ready to use them.

As for filters, I read in Forbes or money magazine (2001 or so) that the cheapest and most effective home filter is a Brita pitcher. Just make sure the pitcher plastic is BPA free. The plastic carbon filter does create an environmental impact, but it's not nearly as bad as plastic water bottles (especially Nestle water--fuck that company). Also, never use hot tap water for drinking or cooking. The hot pipe contains much more corrosion. Lastly, if your municipal water is truly unsafe to drink, get politically involved, organize, and change things. Don't allow hydraulic fracking to happen anywhere in your country."

It's easy and quick to build with a razor, some vine, rope (what ever available) and cloth to stitch up, and very sturdy poles/large branches. As far as keeping them away, cinnamon oil or lavender oil is widely used as a repellent internationally. Cinnamon oil may be the most used. Never personally tried it since I have the luxury of buying repellent, but it's definitely worth a shot in a disaster zone. If oil is needed, mineral oil is best. But if not, olive oil should work just fine.   Source: http://www.healthline.com/health/kinds-of-natural-mosquito-repellant#3"

lifehacks,35w0oq,SnowHawkMike,26,Thu May 14 05:02:10 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the comment is referencing when a shipping box is wrapped in paper. Some people wrap shipping boxes to cover up any labels or marks on the package that could indicate what's inside. For example lets say you order a fancy new computer; the computer in it's original packaging is put into a shipping box, but that box has ""Pineapple Computers"" all over it, so everyone knows if contains something expensive. So the shipper decides to wrap the shipping container in plain paper and put an de branded shipping label on it. It's this paper that can get caught."
lifehacks,35w0oq,Oneusee,7,Thu May 14 05:31:13 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay. I was wondering what they meant by ""don't wrap anything at all"". Was a wee bit confusing for me."
lifehacks,35w0oq,alexiswi,5,Thu May 14 05:39:10 2015 UTC,"It's boxed and taped. They don't like it if you box it, tape it and then wrap it in paper.   And if my old postmaster is any barometer, they really don't like it if you tie it with string. A number of years ago I was having a lot of packages shipped from Russia and they all came tied with string. I assume that was standard operating procedure at the time for mid sized international shipments departing Moscow. Or maybe I was just special and the shipper thought I needed more string in my life. In any case, just before the last packages arrived the postmaster gave me a very stern admonition to notify the sender that if they didn't start using packing tape instead of string, she was going to send word up the line to stop processing the packages and immediately return them to sender because the whole time I'd been getting them she'd been hearing nothing but complaints down the line from nearly everybody that touched the packages since they had to pull them out and sort them by hand every step along the way across the entire US."

lifehacks,35w0oq,Dalelol,44,Thu May 14 08:25:16 2015 UTC,"“Hipster” is a term co-opted for use as a meaningless pejorative in order to vaguely call someone else’s authenticity into question and, by extension, claim authenticity for yourself.  It serves no conversational function and imparts no information, save for indicating the opinions and preferences of the speaker.  Meanwhile, a market myth has sprung up around the term, as well as a cultural boogeyman consisting of elusive white 20-somethings who wear certain clothes (but no one will agree on what), listen to certain music (no one can agree on this either), and act a certain way (you’ve probably sensed the pattern on your own).  You can’t define what “that kind of behavior or fashion or lifestyle” actually is, nor will you ever be able to. That’s because you don’t use “hipster” to describe an actual group of people, but to describe a fictional stereotype that is an outlet for literally anything that annoys you.  The twist, of course, is that if it weren’t for your own insecurities, nothing that a “hipster” could do or wear would ever affect you emotionally. But you are insecure about your own authenticity - “Do I wear what I wear because I want to? Do I listen to my music because I truly like it? I’m certainly not like those filthy hipsters!” - so you project those feelings.

For example, I could always tell when my phone was about to ring because of a low frequency buzzing in my (external) computer speakers.  I'd hear that sound, and then a few seconds later my phone would ring.  There are actually some devices (like pens and stuff) you can buy that are completely separate from your phone that will light up when you're getting a call.  I assume they work on a similar principle.  So my crazy suggestion- hook up some speakers and use them as a radio frequency detector. Give your phone a call, and walk around with the speakers until you get some interference, and then you'll know you're close.  Maybe...

A belt helps keep everything from continuing to slide down, but it stays in place pretty well if you're not moving around a lot.  I use the one time use hand warmers or one time use back heating pads.  I guess it depends on what part of your back you want the pad to be on, as this only really works well for the lower back."

If you're looking to add size or strength, then it might help very little, and even then only to a certain point. My advice to you is if you're going to try and work out, then go try and work out. If you're just looking for a passive calorie burn, then get a standing desk or something.  If you're trying to burn more calories throughout the day, then exercise in the morning.

lifehacks,35j3mh,CallingOutYourBS,13,Mon May 11 12:11:06 2015 UTC,"A lot of these depend on the person you're having the conversation with.    For instance, #5 for people who communicate/learn aurally that's great, but for people who don't it's irritating.  Personally I hate repetition, so that would annoy the crap out of me.  Same thing with #8, sales people do this and it's the most fakey gross feeling.  I'd much rather have someone say ""You know I suck at names, so please forgive me if it takes a few tries for me to remember.""  7, arm crossing is, at least in America, a pretty universal sign for someone who's upset or non-receptive, so it would lead to whoever you're talking with thinking they upset you and getting anxious, far more likely than mimicking you.  11 only works if the person you're talking to has NO idea what you're talking about.  Otherwise you get called out and look like an ass clown.  21, obviously, don't touch people.  It can take a pleasant conversation and turn it into awkward pretty fast.  There's a couple more in here that are pretty dubious, but that could just be my personal preference, I'm not a big fan of ""power positioning""."

However, telling someone to touch a stranger's knee... There's no way to not be creepy when you do that.  I'm also coming from this as a woman, so where I see guys who've only met a few times grabbing each other's shoulders, and they're OK with that.

My comfort level is extremely broad now that I am forced into selling myself and food to hungry folks. I walk out of a shift with a fat wad of cash and confidence knowing I made that happen. I still am an introvert, but I fake being a personable, extroverted person when I'm in public. It is very exhausting but I get better sleep now, for what it's worth.

If you've ever had someone talk to you while staring you in the eyes the entire time you'll realize how overbearing and awkward it is.

lifehacks,35ixku,latherus,11,Mon May 11 17:29:12 2015 UTC,"Wearing minimalist running shoes can actually help with fallen arches, but it is important to be careful. Over time, running in minimalist shoes can tighten up the muscles in the foot and make arches more prominent. However, when you first start out with them you will only want to run a little bit at a time with them. Too much running when your feet aren't used to zero support will have the opposite effect and will just injure you."

lifehacks,35ixku,BoondockWarrior,2,Mon May 11 01:00:29 2015 UTC,"The reason I ask is this lacing technique is very important to know for serious hiking. If you are walking for a few days, especially over hilly terrain, you need to lock your laces. Otherwise you'll end up with blacktoe from constantly stubbing it."
lifehacks,35ixku,vbevan,8,Mon May 11 01:09:35 2015 UTC,Oh no doubt there are different lacing techniques. I just see the word running and blisters in the same sentence and most times its due to shoes.  With hiking don't you normally wear a taller shoe/boot (curious since I will be going some this summer)
lifehacks,35ixku,BoondockWarrior,1 point,Mon May 11 01:11:49 2015 UTC,"Depends on the type of hiking. Flat terrain you don't need such a high boot, hilly terrain the ankle support becomes important and you want a half boot. If you're going somewhere with icy terrain, I'd go a full boot to give support for slips you might have and to keep you warmer.  I went to Everest Base Camp in summer and wore half boot Mammuts. Worth every penny, they saved me from a twisted ankle a couple of times."

lifehacks,35ixku,WiredEgo,11,Sun May 10 22:13:31 2015 UTC,"Spot the person who's never been hiking. Proper locking lacing stops you banging you toe downhill and chafing your heel uphill.

Also trying to quit smoking has nothing to do with getting more social, it's more like counterproductive. For instance this one time some hot chick outside a club asked me if i had a cig, i told her yeah but i only have one left, we could smoke it together if she wanted to. We got into a conversation and i got her number.  Anyways if you want to quit smoking there are some good tips on the internet like keep yourself busy, keep your mouth busy (chewing gum or toothpick works good) and mostly it's a mind thing. And don't start with i am first going to smoke less then quit, rather quit right now. Get rid all of your cigs instantly. Find some new hobbies to (as i said before) keep yourself busy.

It's a great game console, but only average for BR playback nowadays (it was amazing and the best when it first came out, but it's been years and everything caught up and went beyond).  Plus the non-standard IR for remote control, and it's just a hassle to use.  Drop $50 on a regular BR player and enjoy the greater compatibility with everything.  At least 95% of the population uses 100% normal IR devices that work perfectly with a Harmony.  I've had complex AV setups for years and still love my Harmony.  Position them in a normal way, and there's no problem.  Set up weird or in another room, and perhaps consider an IR repeater.  Lack of discrete codes sucks for any universal remote.  Harmony is no exception.  Time to switch to a more reasonable device... there's no excuse in this day and age.  Don't bother with the expensive Harmony remotes unless you have a ton of devices.  The Harmony 650 is $59 on Amazon (or $49 if you want a refurb) and controls 8 devices, which is all most people need, even techies like me:  1-TV 2-Receiver 3-Cable/Sat 4-Blu Ray 5-AppleTV or Roku? 6-what, a VCR? 7-again, what?

lifehacks,358j8h,KyuubiReddit,1 point,Fri May 8 11:10:24 2015 UTC,"I recommend reading what I wrote a little closer, including the specifics of my model recommendation.  Can't help you with bad TV interfaces, and again, ANY universal remote will suffer in that situation.  One unique thing about the Harmony is it has a vast database... some TVs actually have ""hidden"" direct input commands that are in the database that are not on the OEM remote!  And all that said, if you really want to make it work, you usually can, although I'll readily admit that it's less than simple.  There is an interface for dealing with toggle-based inputs with a Harmony, but it's not ideal, and it can be more error-prone, but it does work most of the time.  (and the excellent Help button can usually get you back on track the rest of the time)  (Key delay can also be tweaked for your laggy Comcast box)  Still, these issues are tied to specific sub-par equipment (from a universal remote standpoint, that is).  MOST equipment does not suffer from these issues.  Ditto problems with crappy IR receivers in your equipment.  Kinda sounds you have a less-than ideal set up all around. (again, from a universal remote standpoint)  I've set up probably 30 clients with Harmony remotes... including my luddite parents and my in-laws.  All manner of equipment.  Very few have had issues such as the ones you describe.  Yes, some people do simply have bad equipment, as far as universal control is concerned, but that's not the remote's fault.  Fixing the equipment resolves the situations for all universal remotes.  I also specifically recommended a model of Harmony that does not use a charging base or charging cable.  Regular AAs, or better yet, rechargeables that you can swap in as needed.  The model I recommended also does not have a touch screen, it's all physical buttons.  I agree touch screens suck in the dark.  (which is yet another reason why using an app and IR plugin on a smart phone is just silly, and true remotes like Harmony are far superior)  In a perfect world, everything would work together perfectly.  In this imperfect world, the Harmony is as close to perfect as you can reasonably expect to get, especially considering the modest price."
lifehacks,358j8h,KyuubiReddit,1 point,Fri May 8 17:40:38 2015 UTC,"I have an A/V receiver, a TV, a Bluray player, a PS3, an xbox 360, a TV box, a TV, a popcorn hour box, not to mention several other non controllable devices such as GameCube, Wii, Wii U, and not only did I never encounter any of your issues in years of using a Harmony One, but life would be an absolute nightmare without it.   Nothing ever went out of sync, ever"
lifehacks,358j8h,KyuubiReddit,1 point,Fri May 8 19:44:16 2015 UTC,"I am not sure I understand your issue.  I programmed my Harmony properly with the software that came with it. It's painful but not really complicated.  Each activity is separate. ""Play PS3"" will turn on the TV, go to HDMI2, switch the A/V receiver on to the proper setup, and it works.  Whereas ""Play Bluray/DVD"" will turn on the TV, go to HDMI 3, turn on the Bluray player, and turn on the A/V receiver on to the proper setup.  For any given activity, I only had to press ONCE for all of this to work, and once more to turn everything off or start another activity.  I am not saying it's completely zero-hassle, but the few times it fails (and it's usually due to something like a failed HDMI handshake, not the Harmony), pressing ""Help"" will walk you through a procedure to fix it.  This is the model I have: http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Harmony-Universal-Remote-Screen/dp/B00119T6NQ  I got it for 150$ I think, or maybe a little more, and it's discontinued (replaced by Harmony One Advanced)"
lifehacks,358j8h,Eynak_Tsew,1 point,Fri May 8 20:21:46 2015 UTC,"oh I get it now, you must have an older TV model, the one I had before was similar, I was forced to press the TV remote button several times to travel from HDMI 2 to HDMI 1 (but the Harmony worked flawlessly for me on that TV too, took me directly wherever I wanted).   I see why the Harmony didn't work for you.  The new TV I have receives a distinct signal for each channel.  so for example whether you're in HDMI 1, HDMI 4, or wherever, the Harmony (or the TV remote) is capable of taking you directly to HDMI 2."

Plug however many lights you want to control into the board and then use a smart phone or your computer as the master remote.

The way that you said ""the answer is right there"" made it sound like I was being lazy.  I'm a little confused about: ""why it wouldn't be returning smartphone app options"" since I've said that I don't own a smartphone and was looking for an alarm clock.  I'm fully aware that smartphones can do a plethora of useful things, but I'm not overly interested in purchasing one right now.  My fiancee has a smartphone and can generally do anything I would require of one.  The only shortfall is when I need to find a specific phone number or check email and she's not around.  To go through your list of things:  GPS - I've owned a GPS for many years.    Reddit: don't need on mobile.   Banking: never really needed on the go?  Digitally depositing checks sounds nice, but I just visit once a month or so while I do other errands.  Old transactions can be accessed from my desktop.  I've never needed old transactions immediately.  Photos to computer: I can text to my email which I can access from my desktop.    General statement regarding apps: Maybe they would be useful but I don't see it.  I've seen enough occasions where people play video games on their phones while out to dinner or other similar things that I don't really care about app stores.  Burning CDs: I do have an iPod.  If I were a teen today I probably wouldn't bother, but I was around when they were new, so I still have one that usually sits in my car or at work.  Photos: Meh? I'm guessing I could send pics to my email and then print them via the website, but I don't think I've ever printed a photo.  I could do it through my printer anyway.  I'm fully aware that an internet-enabled smartphone would consolidate some of the electronics I have, but I already own these things and don't feel the need to spend several hundred more dollars per year to do this.  I'm not old, a technophobe, or too poor for a smartphone.  I can afford it, but it's just wasted money to me.  Once I'm married and my wife and I are already paying for her smartphone, I'd be more likely to pay the smaller fee to add an additional data line.  As it is, I have a lot of other things I'd like to do with that money.  The bicep curl alarm clock is here, but the website is horrific."

You can't shake the phone either, it requires a certain gyroscopic level to register as step each time so you have to actually physically get out of bed and walk around to turn it off. And then since you're out of bed and walking around, you usually don't end up falling back into bed.  Sometimes when I'm really lazy, I enter the apps menu of my menu and force close it to turn whatever alarm off but it's been a hell of an effective tool at getting me up when I need to. It's customisable too, you can set any sound you want to get up including songs. I set it to John Wiese at the start, big mistake that one, I almost shit myself getting woken up to him.

Entirely depends on your job. I regularly have to work 100-hour weeks, and yeah, you get less shit done on your third 18-hour day in a row than you would have if you didn't work 36 of the last 48 hours, but it's not like you're getting nothing done, and deadlines are deadlines.

It may only be anecdotal, but having had a few months of 14-18 hours a day, 7 days a week (not concurrently... I've never had to pull that schedule for more than a month at a time, and the worst was that schedule for three weeks, followed by two 65-hour weeks, then four weeks of the insanity), you do get more shit done.

lifehacks,350rod,crazyprsn,8,Wed May 6 06:42:14 2015 UTC,"Something important though: If you tie the first part with a left-over-right pattern, you'll want to make sure (in the second part) that the left side is looping toward you. Opposite if you tie the first part right-over-left.  The reason is, you're maintaining the symmetry of the knot. You'll know you've done it right if the ""bunny ears"" want to fall horizontally down the sides of the shoes. If you've tied it non-symmetrically, you'll know because the ""bunny ears"" will fall vertically along your foot.  The advantage with tying the knot symmetrically is that it will hardly ever come untied, while nonsymmetrical knots are weak and will come untied more often.

It doesn't matter when you go to bed or how much sleep you get, your waking habit is what will govern your ability to get up.  In the evenings/weekends, dress as you would to sleep and set an alarm for 5-10 minutes later.  Lay down and close your eyes until the alarm goes off.  The second it goes off, jump out of bed (doing this energetically is a big plus) and go take a shower, brush your teeth, and get dressed.  Repeat as many times as you can and you will start responding the same way when your alarm goes off 7am.  Once you have that habit set, waking up at the same time every day (even on weekends) just enforces it.  You may be sleep deprived sometimes, but your body quickly adjusts, because of the regularity."

If you find yourself sleeping through alarms, dosing off at random in any environment, and generally struggling with your sleep cycle in ways other people don't; you may want to see a doctor. Another thing to consider is checking how well you sleep when you sleep. Even if you're getting eight hours, if you have sleep apnea or similar issues, you'll wake up groggy.  But yeah, the ideas already listed here may help. Setting a very strict sleep schedule and sticking to it is very important. Sleep in a dark and quiet environment, and then during the day don't lay about in the dark. Sit up and have the lights on. You're trying to train your internal clock to be awake during awake time, and asleep during sleep time. You give yourself cues like turning of excess noise and bright screens in the hour or so before bed.  Also, you could invest in one of these: Fairly expensive natural alarms."

Anyways is this at home while on computer or when you listen to some good music on your couch? Cuz i'd rather wrap a small colored band around one side instead of damaging my equipment.
lifehacks,34xpn2,lf27,-6,Tue May 5 13:27:45 2015 UTC,"I might been wrong to call it a headset - if there is a mic at one side the subject is moot.  Rubber bands would work as well, but I didn't think of that or have any. I don't really mind the small deliberate surface damage (or customization if you will) as I don't intend to sell theese when i'm done with them, and the scratches are subtle enough that few would ever notice them. That being said, having been a little more careful with the lines would have been prettier."
lifehacks,34xpn2,gunhorseunlimited,-2,Tue May 5 13:36:16 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing. You said a ""headset is a headphone.""  Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.  As someone who is a scientist who studies headphones, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls headsets headphones. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying ""headphone family"" you're referring to electroacoustic transducers which convert an electrical signal to a corresponding sound, which includes things from dre beats to steelseries to sennheisers.  So your reasoning for calling a headphone a headset is because random people ""the subject is moot"" Let's get earbuds and earphones in there, then, too.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?"

lifehacks,34xpn2,Roosvall,1 point,Tue May 5 19:55:31 2015 UTC,"Why did you decide to post this comment? When you saw OP's post, I'm assuming that you thought ""wow, why would he scratch his headphones just for a really small convenience like that?"" so I can see why you would go to the comment section to voice your opinion. But I have a few questions about the decisions you made in posting this particular comment:  1) Obviously you don't think that putting a blemish on your headphones is worth the minor convenience. However, judging by the fact that he not only scratched his headphones, but he also posted online recommending that other people follow suit, it's obvious that OP does think that the minor convenience is worth the blemish. So what is the point of mocking OP for a decision he clearly is happy with making, because you don't think that you, personally, would be happy making the decision?  2) I'm assuming that you skimmed at least a few comments before posting your own - if not, this question doesn't apply. Assuming that the reason you made your comment was to point out what's wrong with OP's suggestion, why did you feel that you should point it out after countless other comments have pointed out the same thing? I'm sure you realized that if so many other comments have already pointed out the same thing, then OP - as well as anyone else reading the comments - understands the point, so why did you feel that you should make the point an additional time?  3) I find it very unlikely that you actually view scoring the side of one's headphones as similar to cutting off one's own feet. Which makes me believe that the only reason you would draw that analogy is specifically to spite OP. Why did you want to mock someone, rather than simply down vote the post and move on to other content? OP's post is not harming anyone, and clearly it is more work to open the comments section and leave a rude message than to click the down arrow and scroll on, so why did you feel it was worth the effort?  Thanks, I hope you help quench my curiosity!"

It disappoints me that he didn't answer them, but I don't think that asking questions you genuinely want the answers to is ever a waste of time - that's how you learn. Of course my comment was passive-aggressive, but that wasn't the whole point.  I also wanted him, and anyone else who read it, to ask themselves those questions. I wanted the answers to them, but I also wanted him to think about the answers himself. So often people on the internet like to put others down without even thinking about it, without considering why they feel the need to be mean or how the person they're putting down might feel about it."

Next; check your modem is working at full transmission power and you have dual band enabled if available. Use 5ghz where possible too.  Lastly, get a newer modem with multiple external aerials.

That is usre-fire way to make signal problem worse.  Chanels overlap and if you select unused channel, people with channels close to it (i.e. you select 3 but have neighbourse with 1 and 6) everyone will have worse signal because 1 and 3 overlap a bit and produce ""noise"" for each other - which means worse signal. Same for 3 and 6. And of course, 3 gets notice from both 1 and 6.  Read up here: http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/wireless/technology/channel/deployment/guide/Channel.html  On the other hand, if you select 1 and neighbours have 1 and 6, you are completelly insulated from interfences from 6 and you AP can negotiate with other AP that uses channel 1 rather than acting like jammer for each other and you will have superb reception.

Antennas are designed for certain wavelength and it's unlikely you will be able to optimize your piece of aluminium / Pringles can / copper plate to the right wavelength. And even if so, you succeeded in making it directional. Range is only increased in one direction.   The safest way to extend range is to add another wired access point.

The bridge mode router is hardwired into the main router, so it's full-speed regardless of which one I'm connected to.  They run on different channels, but both access points have the same SSID and password. This allows my laptop/phone/table to seamlessly switch to whichever has the stronger signal.  It means you need to run a long ethernet cable to the second router, but that cost me just a few bucks on Monoprice. I used cable runners to help keep that clean.

lifehacks,34srt6,slowro,-4,Mon May 4 17:18:54 2015 UTC,"If you need high speed, or live by many other Wi-Fi networks, don't use this system.  Make sure your network is running at 2.4 GHz not 5 GHz. 2.4 has a longer range and is better at going through walls.  Set your router to the lowest channel possible. This will give you the best range at the expense of speed. The higher the channel the better the speed and the lower the range.  And last, make sure your router is at 100% power and is centrally located. Good luck!"

I don't believe the channel/speed thing is true at all. The channel only dictates minor adjustments to the frequency. Each channel makes up for a 22MHz range... Channel 1 is 2.412GHz, channel 2 is 2.417GHz, etc, etc, up to Channel 13, which is 2.472GHz. With 802.11n, you're still going to get around 150Mbps (theoretical) at full signal, regardless of the channel. With 5GHz, you can double that speed, or more (theoretical 300-450Mbps).  Lastly, the 2.4 spectrum is far more crowded — aside from WiFi, it's also used by microwaves, Bluetooth, etc; whereas 5GHz has much less issue."

Close your mouth and inhale slowly through your nose while mentally counting to four. Hold your breath for a mental count of seven. Exhale completely through your mouth for a mental count of eight.

lifehacks,34h2i4,Pinkie31459,2,Fri May 1 10:20:19 2015 UTC,I fight headaches that way. Sometimes I fail to notice I'm tense and will have to find where the tension is so I clench everything then release it all. It feels so good it's almost worth the headache. Also the smiling trick: move my face as if to smile but stop just short of it so as to avoid clenching something else. Muscle neutrality.
lifehacks,34h2i4,osqer,3,Fri May 1 13:37:36 2015 UTC,I have been doing this for years and when I'm feeling anxious or stressed there is always a muscle somewhere that I'm subconsciously holding tight. Releasing all of that helps me to sleep more quickly.

lifehacks,34h2i4,ReverendMak,1 point,Fri May 1 13:53:23 2015 UTC,This takes long. You can also slowly count backwards from 100. I've never made it to one while relaxing in a bed at night
lifehacks,34h2i4,benjobeast,1 point,Fri May 1 13:55:38 2015 UTC,I got taught this 12 yrs ago when I was in high school as a way to fall asleep when you have exams the next day. Its my go to method. Also deep breathing helps.
lifehacks,34h2i4,ReverendMak,57,Fri May 1 14:01:49 2015 UTC,"They touch on this in the article but not enough: our body is a 2 way street, our internal behavior infulences our external but people forget that it works the other way as well.  We get in the habit of shallow chest breathing even when we are not stressed but our body does not know we arent stressed.    Its logic is, ""I breath shallow when I am stresses, I am breathing shallow therefore I must be stressed"" and it releases stress hormones to match.  We can reverse this by tricking our body to think we are calm by acting like it, which is slow deep belly breaths.  This works for pretty much all emotions.  There have been studies on how standing in a Superman pose (wide feet, hands on hips) for 2 minutes actually releases testosterone and makes you feel more confident.  If more people realized the control they had over how they felt there would be a lot more happy people out there.  The old saying fake it till you make it is one of truest out there."

lifehacks,34h2i4,Refo1689,9,Fri May 1 08:19:04 2015 UTC,Not only that but the endorphins  you release when you smile will actually make other people smile.  A smile is literally contagious.

lifehacks,34h2i4,Dryhtscipe,3,Fri May 1 04:59:25 2015 UTC,"I didn't think that's how that worked. Rather, the endorphins you release are released inside your brain. They are a neurotransmitter, not a hormone. They make YOU happy.  However, human beings will naturally and unconsciously mimic facial expressions seen on others. So, when you smile, endorphins in your brain make you happy, and then someone seeing you has a good chance of instinctively smiling in response to your smile, and then THEIR smile releases endorphins in their brain which make them happy.

The sound method is kind of like hearing the hum inside your own head. It's similar to the humming of a refrigerator. It's the only sound your hear when you have silence... the subtle ringing in your ears. Focusing on that sound for more than 45 seconds will make anyone sleep.

lifehacks,34h2i4,VisionsOfUranus,6,Fri May 1 11:44:46 2015 UTC,"I'm always skeptical of oxygenation claims whenever breathing exercises and meditation come up, but I'm a big believer in the value of focusing on your breathing for the mental and emotional release valve it provides.  For me, focusing on breathing means I'm not jumping like chain lightning from topic to topic in my mind; I simply focus on breathing or counting, and if I think a stray thought, I calmly acknowledge and dismiss it and focus on my breathing once more.  This doesn't sound like much, but it means you're not focusing on anything else. It's hard to be stressed about something you don't have space in your consciousness to think about, and with practice, you can get very effective at focusing on just the breathing. It's not surprising that meditation and breathing are so closely linked to spiritualism, because it can completely change your mood and the way you think in a few short minutes.  Obviously I'm a big advocate! It's helped me a lot-- and helped me avoid medication for ADHD for most of my life."

For me personally, I can fall asleep so fast if you put on replays or vods on Warcraft 3, Starcraft, or something very intensive and strategic.

lifehacks,34h2i4,tknames,3,Fri May 1 10:03:22 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Breath in through your nose for 4 seconds, hold for 7, out through mouth for 8 seconds, repeat.  Honestly, I found that Concentration (or Zen) meditation helps more. Just breath deeply and focus on the feeling of air entering and exiting your lungs. If any other thoughts enter your mind, push them away. It's a simple concept that is difficult to do, but makes falling asleep super easy. I used to take 30-45 minutes or longer to fall asleep. Now it takes less than 5."

It'll keep your edges sharp for a very long time if you do this before or after every time you use your knives.  It's the most important thing you can do for knife maintenance.  A sharp knife is a safer knife.  It will take less force to cut, and you won't slip which is the #1 way people cut themselves.  Also, youtube some knife skills so that you can cut safely...   trick is to bend first knuckles holding the object so that the blade side touches 'em.    oh and everyone should just get a smooth round ceramic hone rather than using a mug.

But they're also used everywhere else because they are good all around all purpose inexpensive alloys.   sure, those industries also happen to use exotic materials, but you won't see relatively inexpensive consumer goods being made out of high-end exotic alloys.   I have yet to see any consumer trinkets made out of Hastelloy, 2014 aluminum, MP35N, Ti-Pd, Ti-Re, Al-Li, Vespel, or single Crystal steel or Ti. Ni-Ti  use is exceedingly rare"

Unfortunately, this is not always the case. I have had 7 different piercings, all from reputable shops, and they all rejected.

lifehacks,34cudu,Jibaro123,2,Thu Apr 30 18:22:12 2015 UTC,"Just being pragmatic.  If you ever want to borrow money or have a credit card with a reasonable interest rate, you should not go out of your way to fuck people out of money that they claim correctly that you owe them.  I don't know you from a hole in the wall: where you are, how old you are, whether you still live with your parents or are married with children.  I bought a house in 1982 with a 30 year mortgage at an interest rate of 13.99%.  I did not have a credit hidstory so they figured they were taking a bigger risk than usual.  Money was tight, so interest rates in general were much higher than they are now.  Four years or so later we refinanced and got a fifteen year mortgage at a much lower rate, same principal.  The monthly payment for the thirty year mortgage was $402.  The monthly payment for the fifteen year loan was $258  Same loan amount  I got the lower rate because i made my payments on time for a long time span.  So, if you will ever need to borrow money for any reason, you should pay attention to your credit rating.  Trying to screw Netflix all the time will catch up with you.  If you are already rich then i am just a pedantic little peasant.  But if you are not rich and think it is a good idea to screw Netflx, you never will get rich and just might not appreciate the implications of my monthly payments at the time."

The windshield in the original video looks to be scratched, not cracked. This is important.  The salt dissolves in the isopropyl alcohol and is brushed onto the scratch (Bug spray is another solvent that quickly evaporates, they are probably interchangeable). The solution seeps into the scratch and the alcohol quickly evaporates leaving salt crystals behind. The salt crystals have a similar refractive index to glass and it will appear as though there is no scratch there. It will go away once it rains.  It doesn't work on cracks because a brush is not enough to get enough of the solution into a huge crack and fill it up. I suppose the same effect would occur if the solution actually filled the crack.  It's purely aesthetic and temporary. For something permanent just buy an acrylic that is advertized to do this sort of thing."

lifehacks,33toey,TheSuicideSiren,4,Sat Apr 25 20:30:20 2015 UTC,"Clarification to those of you that are wondering. My clarinet itself is not broken, simply the rubber bit that I put on my thumb rest. Since I didn't have a pencil grip as a substitute, I settled on making a wine cork into one. Here is a side by side of my clarinet piece in question, and my old thumb rest and new cork one: http://imgur.com/JzwZHK5"
lifehacks,33toey,JRPGpro,3,Sat Apr 25 21:47:13 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would find a cork very uncomfortable, it seems to me that it would be quite coarse on my thumb.  Also, it seems that the cork would put your thumb in a very low position, cramping your right hand as you play. It looks like you have adjusted your thumb rest to a high position to counter this, but have undone that adjustment with the cork.  I've personally found the thumb rests on those Buffet instruments very comfortable because they are wide, unlike the ones you find on many cheaper model clarinets.  My on the fly replacement for thumb rest cushions is a piece of blue tack wrapped in cling wrap. The blue tack will cushion your thumb and the cling wrap will stop it sticking to you. It will also be thinner than your cork, keeping your hand in a comfortable position as you play. Happy clarinetting. May your reeds always be good."
lifehacks,33toey,l_dont_even_reddit,2,Sat Apr 25 22:10:23 2015 UTC,"I have big hands, so it isn't cumbersome to me. In addition, the reason why I choose the wine cork, is due to the fact that rather than being very coarse, is instead very soft, and because the outside of the cork is very rubbery, it provides a lot of structural support from tearing."

lifehacks,33toey,JFConz,9,Sat Apr 25 20:56:36 2015 UTC,"Can't speak for OP, but a few things.   1.) Instruments are often expensive to repair, musicians aren't often rich. If OP is a college student / early in his/her career, then repairing might be temporality out of his/her price range.  2.) Even if OP has the money, he or she might have a gig or multiple gigs in the near-or-immediate future that make parting with the instrument impossible for a while. Hence the temporary fix to continue to play / work.   3.) Woodwind players often have to play an array of instruments. His/her main instrument might be bass clarinet or even something like the oboe, with this being a secondary instrument for a gig with a jazz band or something. Non-bass clarinettists usually play the Bb clarinet (ie, you play the note C, which produces the pitch Bb), but the clarinet in A (you play the note C, which produces  the pitch A) is used all the time in scores, so you'd need to have one of those around as well. The clarinet family is pretty huge, and you have to own / have access to several in order to be a working musician.   TL;DR: thia might be an ""off"" instrument that OP doesn't use often and hence can't be assed to fix.   5.) Related, but if you own a couple of these bad boys (see 4) and perhaps you shelled out a decent amount recently to repair one, you might be drained for the time being (see 1).  Or maybe   6.) It's a rental that is insured?"

Let's say the material and production cost both financially and environmentally is identical between a given weight of each kind. The problem is that a pound of plastic goes much slower than a pound of reusables, mostly because it contains a gigantic number of bags. The ideal solution would be for everyone to get the reusable bags they'll need then never forget them, but that's not what happens.  My point is that the best practical solution isn't directly intuitive."
lifehacks,33tt7c,TheVeryMask,2,Sun Apr 26 07:35:10 2015 UTC,You make a valid point. But I really believe that you can create a culture where people have no choice.  I'm from the Netherlands - and bags here aren't free - they cost 25 eurocents (them being a fair bit larger/sturdier - and can be reused as well to a certain degree) - but anyone doing their shopping brings a reusable bag or 2 (those are also larger here I think).   Forgot your reusable? - buy a plastic/paper bag for a fee. But people don't want to lose money every time they do their shopping - and start bringing their own bags.   I'm not saying this system is perfect - but it seems to me be at least a step in the right direction.

lifehacks,33vala,darkened_enmity,1 point,Sun Apr 26 06:48:25 2015 UTC,"Edit: took a closer look. The bottom and top right tip are fixed in place, the top left tip slides up and down, and everything pivots together at the middle junction.  OK, so we're on the same page, that whole pivoting mess looks like a lower case y to me.  So, the bottom/tail of the y is fastened to a small bar. (The arrow in your pic). That little bar appears to be held in place with a Phillips head screw, so I doubt it moves.  The top left tip of the y appears to be the same deal, equally fastened I'm place.  Now the top right tip of the y is the money shot. I get the impression that it slides up and down the length of the actual window, as opposed to the frame.  The only catch is that in this arrangement, there has to be a second moving part, but I'm having a hard time identifying it."

lifehacks,33vala,darkened_enmity,1 point,Sun Apr 26 09:38:36 2015 UTC,I'm guessing it only opens so far so some kid doesn't fall out.
lifehacks,33vala,darkened_enmity,1 point,Mon Apr 27 07:05:18 2015 UTC,"Okay OP, you ready?  Here's what's going on. That whole bracket assemply (the hinge part that looks like a lowercase y) is what's limiting you. If you notice, the tip left of the y has a little slot it slides up and down in. When you push the window out, the right side of the y pulls on the bottom of the left side, sliding it down. When you close the window, the right side pushes up on the bottom, sliding it up. It can only go up and down, and only till it runs into the ends of the channel (at the top and bottom).  You're bottoming out in that channel. Judging by the background in your picture, I'm guessing it's a safety precaution due to height. Straight up, there is no way to open it further without removing some screws and pulling parts out of the guide track.  At this point you're looking at ignoring safety concerns and implimenting some modifications DIY style. I wouldn't fuck with it unless you own the place this window is attached to."

I imagine it's because you get so much at once that you're going to need to get the other stuff long before you get milk again. I've had people try to give me free milk at the grocery store too, and I used to give milk away when I got WIC. I got it because I was pregnant and got 4 gallons a month. My son's father, who I lived with then, is lactose intolerant so I never used that much milk. I'd bring some to my mom's house because at the time, I still had 3 siblings living at home.

Reusing and recycling is great, but in a business hiring minimum wage employees, the vast majority of employees will not care about saving the world. If a cup falls on the floor, straight in the trash.  If an employee gets thirsty, they grab a quick drink and then the cup  goes straight in the trash. It Starbucks or any company for that matter changes the cup design or logo or whatever else, the now defunct cups go straight in the trash. I would like to think what I do helps, and I don't do as much as I should, but at the end of the day, there are outlets of waste that cannot be stopped. And I know at this point I am rambling, I'm a little drunk right now, but last week I was working at a food service trade show for a major food service product distributor close to me.  At the end of the trade show, not only were there a couple tons of garbage, but in that trash was at least 1000 pounds of food.

I don't know Starbucks pricing as a I typically home brew so I'm making up numbers:  Frappichino = 4.35  Regular Coffee = 1.75  Crushed Ice = Free  Extra Milk = Starbucks doesn't charge for milk/cream (never have when I've got a regular drip coffee).  Caramel = .50  Syrup Added = .50  Whipped Cream = .50  Tax = .10  So your Frappichino is 3.35 by buying the sum of the parts instead of ordering the whole.

It also don't make you smart, it makes you seem like a jerk when you're constantly trying to cheat the system.

lifehacks,33q39q,tieduh,5,Fri Apr 24 23:08:22 2015 UTC,"Depends on what the ingredient is. The ice blended drink requires a syrup base that to get the drink to a drinkable consistency. If you leave that syrup out and want the drink blended, that's totally fine, but you're going to get a very chunky, frothy drink. So it really depends on what you'd like to leave out. We can always do decaf or completely leave coffee out, but that is still a frappuccinno."

It's much thicker than simple syrup and it's needed when you blend milk, and ice together. It helps give the drink a drinkable consistency. Without that syrup, or the base, you're going to have a drink that has finely blended ice floating at the top. If that's what floats your boat, then that's totally fine with us.

So what you had is a Big Mac only without the middle bun.  And it cost $1 instead of like $3.50.  (mid 2000s prices)  Also if you really wanted that middle bun just ask for it.

Starbucks charges whatever they feel they can charge, based on what people like you and I feel we are willing to pay.  In general, the cost to produce something has very little to do with the price it will be sold for. Rather, the cost to produce a thing determines whether or not it gets sold at all. If there is not sufficient profit after subtracting cost from market price, people just won't make it at all. If there is enough profit for it to be worth it (i.e. it is greater profit than can be had from some other economic activity the organization or person can conduct), then they will produce it. But the price itself is about the value, not the cost, and the two are not the same, despite many people's simple intuition that it is."

You can get around that by letting your beer go flat before you freeze it, which will make it form nice cubes, just like water does.  Me and my college roommate used to freeze all our ""wounded soldiers"" (beers that someone opened, didn't drink, and left behind) and add the cubes to our new beers.

Letting this thing free to use it is useful to prevent abuse. In uk you can't drink till 6pm and at 6.01pm they are all drunk"
