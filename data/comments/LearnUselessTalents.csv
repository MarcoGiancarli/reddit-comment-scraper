It's better to aim to strike a balance between talking quickly and slowing down enough to explain.  I've been told that I talk fast whenever I'm explaining a computer concept, or talking about writing/fiction, or telling a story of something that happened to me. These are all things that I'm an expert at and understand holistically due to years of exposure.  What topic do you want to come across as an expert in?"

Clip your words and sentences.  It's easier with a topic you are very familiar with, in the case of Benedict Cumberbatch he has a script do he knows exactly what's coming next which gives him an advantage. You could practice similarly, take a passage of text and read it aloud, work on saying it faster. I find putting on an accent or affectation helps as it focuses me more on the formation of the words, prevents me from dropping syllables.  Its just practice, keep working on it, and good luck :) and hopefully someone with more expertise will be able to give better advice, I imagine a speech therapist would have some insights on this :)"

You will just seem like an arsehole by trying to force it so don't bother unless you are an amateur actor or something.   Try talking about something you know a lot about and are enthusiastic for and most people naturally talk faster. Cumberbatch can do it becaues he is an actor and has a script.
LearnUselessTalents,3dnh07,MMSTINGRAY,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:30:21 2015 UTC,"Ya, the only reason they can talk that fast is because it's pre-scripted. Same with Newsroom and West wing.   I can sling rather large words that make sense at close to that speed without a script, but I have a few go-to sayings. For example, when I'm talking to a trashy or clearly vapid girl, I have ""Tanning-Bed-Baked,"" ""Bleach bonde barbie"" and a few names ""Jersey Shore"",  ""snookie"" and ""barbie"" all locked and loaded and ready to go. The art of Rhetoric has always been a blast for me.   I have a few of these for each stereotypical type of conversation and person, so it comes off very quickly.   Even then, I can't match the speed of pre-scripted 2 way conversations."

You will throw out your wrist doing that.    Spin on the ball is about how the weight in the ball is positioned.  If the weight is centered directly on the palm of your hand, it will not have a natural spin. If it is off-center it will.    This is why pro-bowlers have multiple balls.  They have different surfaces for different lane conditions, but also have different positions of the weight in the ball.  They will throw the ball the exact same way every time, they don't change this...what changes is the ball they use."

This year I averaged 210 in my winter league, this summer km bowling in a PBAX league (the same patterns the pros bowl on) and I'm only averaging like 170, it is ridiculously tough. I've never been so frustrated in my life, but it makes me better"
LearnUselessTalents,3dh426,JustCallMeKev,14,Thu Jul 16 22:26:18 2015 UTC,"Bowler here. The way many of us were taught to throw the ball with hook is to pretend we are shaking hands with the ball at the bottom of your swing. Essentially, your hand should be in the same sort of position.  You also don't want to use house equipment and will want to get your own reactive equipment with a fingertip grip. The fingertip grip will allow you to get more rotation on the ball and house equipment is very hard. Hard equipment is not very porous, so they have difficulty gripping the lane.

LearnUselessTalents,3dh426,twinn47,4,Thu Jul 16 20:58:10 2015 UTC,"I know it's not common but I use 2 fingers, no thumb.   Feels more natural that way to me.   Then it's just a matter of pushing the ball from  left to right when you throw.  I used to be pretty good with this max score was 265.  Which is almost a perfect game, choked in the last frame.  :("
LearnUselessTalents,3dh426,calsosta,2,Thu Jul 16 20:50:51 2015 UTC,this is the cheaters way to get it. works but for the most part not the correct way.
LearnUselessTalents,3dh426,AntHill12790,3,Thu Jul 16 13:50:58 2015 UTC,"Yea, I have only ever seen one pro use this technique.  I think the main problem is the angle of the spin.    I imagine it is more extreme in this case which means if the lanes are not oiled properly you will get an nasty hook and be forced to change your throw.  This KILLS your consistency, so although I was able to nearly throw a perfect game it was also common to roll in the mid-100s.  If you are just going atomic bowling then who cares right?  People will just be impressed with the hook even if you gutter ball it.  One other thing, with 2 finger you can spin the opposite direction.  This is purely a show-off move for picking up a stray 6,10 pin."
LearnUselessTalents,3dh426,calsosta,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:10:14 2015 UTC,I actually use a completely different technique for opposite. I put 1 finger in the ball and kind of drop my arm down from the outside. so from shoulder height. then push forward and under. it doesnt work the best but it does give results. otherwise if i am playing a casual game i will just hook with the opposite hand for that single corner.   That is another story all together.
LearnUselessTalents,3dh426,AntHill12790,6,Thu Jul 16 14:38:28 2015 UTC,"Some balls are made to spin. The weight in them looks like a mushroom so that it promotes rotation. When releasing the ball, make sure your hand is straight up and down, like you're going to shake someone's hand(the back of your hand can also be facing lightly down). Then make sure your thumb comes out first. As your thumb is releasing, pull your hand straight up as the other two fingers come out. Your follow through should should snap your arm upwards so that your empty hand is up next to your ear."

Then get one session with the pro to show you the basic movement you need to use.

LearnUselessTalents,3dh426,ZappaZoo,2,Thu Jul 16 18:51:02 2015 UTC,"It needs practice. Throw like normal but before you release the ball you turn your hand the way you want it to spin.

LearnUselessTalents,3dh426,MDef255,3,Thu Jul 16 14:19:26 2015 UTC,"I used to bowl and this is it for the most part. There are other things behind it like oil patterns and such. Pretty much as you're letting go of the ball, try to turn your hand from Palm up to Palm facing left (if you're right handed). This should give the ball enough torque to do something. It takes practice to make the ball do exactly what you want curve/hook wise. Another thing to do when you're releasing is to use the two fingers that are in the ball by pulling them towards your palm quickly as they come out of the holes (think of the ""rock on""  symbol as your final hand position). There are other ways, and it all is based on preference. Takes a lot of practice too. I haven't bowled competitively in 8 years or so, so my knowledge has suffered since then."

LearnUselessTalents,3dh426,Beanz122,2,Thu Jul 16 14:32:08 2015 UTC,"To me, you're talking about putting spin on the ball using torque from your wrist.  This actually isn't a very good thing to do, health wise. Most of the spin on the ball should come from the displacement of the internal weight inside the ball itself.  For instance, the weight in my  first frame ball was angled and off center, that creates the spin.  I would release the ball palm facing up and parallel to the lane, and because of the off center weight, the ball would build up centrifugal force while it is on the oiled part of the lane, and the break to the head pin when the oil runs out.  If you are torqueing the ball with wrist alone, that presents a risk of serious injury.   As if it matters, I bowled in college and carried a 200-220 average."

Once you get the hang of bowling with your hand sideways move your hand back to halfway between behind the ball and to the side of it. As you release the ball from this position let your wrist bend away from your palm and the ball will curve. Now you just have to figure out where to stand and aim with your new spin and you're all set."

LearnUselessTalents,3dh426,eraserhill,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:51:41 2015 UTC,The main thing is building up wrist strength. you wanna keep the ball in your hand as if you are holding a tray or something from underneath. learn to keep that through the swing. the swing is also a big part. keep it straight. straight back then straight forward. a lot of people will either swing out or behind their back. If you play pool this should be simple to learn. then on release bring your hand up to you're ear like you are making a phone call. (the call me gesture) then it all comes down to aim and knowing the oil pattern on the lane/figuring out power and all that good stuff. Hope that helped.

Not only is this uncomfortable for them but it causes dehydration (most cats don't drink water - in the wild they get their hydration from raw meat). This results in painful urinary tract infections and eventually kidney failure.   Most humans retain their lactose tolerance due to the extensive marketing from the dairy industry that keeps us consuming long after weaning."

LearnUselessTalents,3cosct,RaunchyBushrabbit,10,Thu Jul 9 17:25:36 2015 UTC,"I've never been freaked out by it. The feeling is positive and I have no fear of losing control of it. It's more like the other way around, like a muscle you activate it needs attention and focus. When I let go it stops immediately. And also like a muscle I can't tense it all the time, a few seconds at a time tops."
LearnUselessTalents,3cosct,RaunchyBushrabbit,5,Thu Jul 9 17:31:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah. When i first figured it out, i could do it a couple times then i felt the need to wait for it to ""recharge"" for a little while."
LearnUselessTalents,3cosct,FAntagonist,4,Thu Jul 9 17:34:33 2015 UTC,"I get that you call it recharging. If I stick to the muscle analogy, to me it feels like a muscle that's not been trained yet. After doing it a couple of times it feels 'tired' for a better word of it, so that's how I can relate to the recharging part.  I don't know since when I've been doing it but I think somewhere in between my 8 and 12 that I did it for the first time.   Do you have a better recollection of why you did this at first?"
LearnUselessTalents,3cosct,xXIJDIXx,2,Thu Jul 9 18:30:30 2015 UTC,I used to do it by telling my arm to move while keeping it from moving if that makes sense. Then i realized its coming from the back of my neck below my skull
LearnUselessTalents,3cosct,Godoffail,2,Thu Jul 9 20:30:58 2015 UTC,"I can't tell where it's exactly located. For me it feels like it's comming from my lower back and often the feeling flows from there into my legs and feet, especially when I do this while lying on my back.  When standing up it seems to be comming more from my neck area, about at shoulder height. There is a bit of a lump there aswell."

LearnUselessTalents,3cosct,xXIJDIXx,6,Fri Jul 10 09:42:27 2015 UTC,"I can do this, as well as the goosebumps thing. I've been able to since I can remember - at least the last 17 years. Usually it's easier when it's not very humid or hot, or if I'm watching/listening to something pleasurable, similar to ASMR or frission.  I've been able to go consistently for 20 seconds or longer, and I can control where the tingles/goosebumps go, and I can control my pupil dilation without inducing all that. It does seem to stem from the base of the neck. I have had excess adrenaline in the past, but that's not what this feels like.  It's almost like a conscious release of dopamine/seratonin, as it does help me soothe/ignore pain/headaches. And when it stops or I can't do it anymore, I can only release smaller bursts, unless I really try, or I react to something I find emotional (even a memory or thought), or I do some tai-chi like movements.  I remember when I was young and extremely upset, I had this coursing through me for a good 30 seconds from what it felt like, at the time I was emitting a primal scream, and I remember feeling a 'snap' in my brain, and it went surging through me much more intensely, to every tip of every extremity, even in my eyes, for another good minute. I swore I had gone Super Saiyan for a minute, but ever since then, controlling it has been much easier.  I have been into meditation and self-hypnosis and studied chakras and chi and martial arts and all that in the past, so I don't know if that has anything to do with it, but this is the first time I've ever heard of anyone else being able to do similar things. Glad I'm not the only one!  I've never had a negative reaction from one though - but I can control my heart rate to an extent without controlling my breathing. I would really like to know what chemical reaction or release or physical response we're able to induce.  Edit: Formatting"

LearnUselessTalents,3cosct,Pacblu202,6,Thu Jul 9 17:53:04 2015 UTC,Yes that is indeed a sensation I can relate it to. Except there is no external stimulus and the feeling is on the inside as opposed to the skin and the muscle spasms are far less.

The purpose of the sympathetic nervous system is to release these hormones all over the body quickly to illicit the response. This would not be possible if the adrenal glands were the only secretion points of adrenaline and noradrenaline, blood flow would not be sufficient to carry the hormones throughout the body in the time needed.

I can do what op describes, and I am pretty sure it's easier to sustain the feeling underwater. I'll try it next time I go swimming, see if it has any effect.  Edit: I tried it and couldn't notice any difference. In the mirror my pupils dilate, but I couldn't  see better underwater. It might be a step in the correct direction, after all those guys spent their lives perfecting this trick."

LearnUselessTalents,3cbbsq,ionabio,2,Tue Jul 7 03:34:14 2015 UTC,"That probably means you're using too much force on your push. Surprisingly it doesn't take too much to get it around. Try pushing light, medium, maybe even harder and see what works the best. Also make sure you're giving a nice ""thumbs up"" so that the pen can spin around the thumb easily.   The best pen would be something relatively long, if it has one side that is noticeably heavier put that end in front. Ironically the Zebra pen he uses in the video is actually awful for spinning, in my opinion. Some common American pens that I think are very very easy to TA with are Pilot G2's, Pentel RSVP, and even Sharpie markers. Not that you should buy one of those if you don't have it, but they're pretty common so you might have one lying around.  Also questions are always welcome as long as you've read the two FAQ threads first."

And not to ruin your hopes for pen spinning, it takes a lot of practice to get to the point of these guys in the Kuma video and these people are at the upper-intermediate or lower-advanced level."

LearnUselessTalents,3c78ji,fustercluck,17,Sun Jul 5 19:10:54 2015 UTC,Is there some technological limitation preventing us from recording horizontal videos while still holding the phone vertically??
LearnUselessTalents,3c78ji,TheRealFlatStanley,10,Mon Jul 6 02:17:07 2015 UTC,"They would have to rotate the sensor, meaning that holding the camera horizontally would take vertical videos instead (which would create all sorts of problems with displaying it on the screen).  You could theoretically crop to horizontal on a high enough resolution sensor, but unless you have a very square sensor (like the HTC One M9), you would be losing a lot of quality."
LearnUselessTalents,3c78ji,Charwinger21,8,Mon Jul 6 03:15:40 2015 UTC,best way would be to just force it into horizontal when you put it in video mode. Like some games do. Make it an option to manually tap it to make it vertical but not possibly to default to vertical or automatically detect the change. Eventually people will learn to shoot horizontally.
LearnUselessTalents,3c78ji,brooklyn11218,2,Mon Jul 6 06:26:32 2015 UTC,best way would be to just force it into horizontal when you put it in video mode.   Like this? (and video link)
LearnUselessTalents,3c78ji,Charwinger21,3,Mon Jul 6 06:45:25 2015 UTC,Seems like you'd only need >4M for 1080p cropping. Surely doable with nowadays.
LearnUselessTalents,3c78ji,TheRealFlatStanley,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:05:47 2015 UTC,"Seems like you'd only need >4M for 1080p cropping. Surely doable with nowadays.    Oh, it would definitely work (you could even upscale if you wanted), the quality would just be substantially reduced.  For example, on a 3,414 x 1,920 sensor (rotated to vertical), you would be using just 31.6% of the sensor's total area.  On the other hand, you could use the whole 3,414 x 1920 area if you were just downscaling to 1920 x 1080 while holding it horizontally.  So, but using that software trick on this theoretical sensor/phone, you would be losing almost 70% of the video quality (but at least it wouldn't be vertical)."
LearnUselessTalents,3c78ji,Charwinger21,-1,Mon Jul 6 09:37:49 2015 UTC,"You don't have to rotate the sensor, just do it on the client side. Your phone has an accelerometer.  This app does it nicely http://www.horizon.camera/"

LearnUselessTalents,3c78ji,NoFreakingIdea,6,Mon Jul 6 04:05:06 2015 UTC,I try to hold it horizontal but honestly it's kind of awkward and vertical on my phone just feels more natural even though I know that it's an incorrect aspect ratio. I don't have this problem with actual video cameras though.

LearnUselessTalents,3bpuof,maxmaxmaxIMHERE,3,Thu Jul 2 02:18:31 2015 UTC,This is going to be difficult to explain but here goes. This is how I learned (was taught) in college  Obviously you need to open a hole in the can the best place for it is at the bottom oposite side of the regular opening to the can. Tilt the can when you do this as if you are able to place the air pocket at the exact location of the opening you will not loose beer nor be drenched in it.  Next you want to position you hands correctly one should hold the bottom of the can and the other hand ready to pull the tab but not doing so just yet.   Bring the opening you made to your lips and start drinking the beer as fast as you can. Once there is suction built up in the can then you Crack the beer the suction being released will force the beer down your throat so be ready for that.   P.S. people always make the hole on the bottom too high and too big it really doesn't need to be bigger than the key you used. The bigger it is the more likely you are to cut yourself.

First of all, theres parities, and no way in hell anyone will figure that out intuitively. As for the 4 4, joining centers and pairing edges can be quite easy, but not so for the last two edges. The 5 5's centers are vaguely tricky, but the real trouble are edge parities. The 6 6 and 7 7 are just 4 4 and 5 5 with mid-layer edge paring, which i take is tricky, but i don't own either.

In fact, a friend told me that the Italian Carabinieri have been known to do inspections of cars leaving beaches to see if anyone has been collecting them.  On a slightly related note, I was in Sardinia last year, and there was one beach with pretty strong waves, but a depth of water of about 0.5-1 meter for about 50 meters from the sand, and I was mercilessly dragged over a frickin colony of these bastards by the waves. Not pleasant. I probably still have some of their broken off spines in my feet."

No seriously, all I remember from high school was hormones, complaining about studying, and pens dropping. But I do remember that happening a lot more in gr8 than in gr12."
LearnUselessTalents,3bjkwb,CordycepsFungus,8,Tue Jun 30 05:36:25 2015 UTC,"Here is a video that shows spinning with an actual pen. It's a lot rarer to see, but Ease is the best at it right now.   To branch off from the balanced mod(batons), there are double capped(DC) mods and single capped(SC) mods. One of the more famous SC mods is the F1R3FLY G3. These are typically unevenly balanced. You'll see a lot of the Japanese spinners, JEB, use SC mods that use the RSVP pens."

I have made a simple beginner guide that you would be able to find in the sidebar, and if you have any questions about it, feel free to PM me or /u/Letho72.   I should also mention, this video is not a really good reflection on how the community is. The pen spinning world tournament is going on right now, currently in the semi-finals, and this is a submission from the pen spinner menowa*. He is the expected winner right now, and it can be seen as why. Here is a collaboration of many different spinners of different styles, it also has spinners who use unmodified pens.   But for a quick guide on where to start, a simple pen mod to make is the BICtory. The fundamentals include the thumbaround, charge, fingerpass, and sonic. And not to ruin your hopes for pen spinning, it takes a lot of practice to get to the point of these guys in the Kuma video and these people are at the upper-intermediate or lower-advanced level."

LearnUselessTalents,3bjkwb,bryanfuel,2,Tue Jun 30 10:59:23 2015 UTC,Start with the Thumb Around and the Sonic. They are pretty basic moves and will definitely be easy enough to learn with enough practice. You WILL drop your pen a lot so I wouldn't do it in public at first unless you feel like picking your pen off the ground every 10 seconds.
LearnUselessTalents,3bjkwb,claymazing,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:32:21 2015 UTC,"I actually got pretty into this for a while! It's not hard to learn and it can keep you occupied whenever you have some spare time (and a pen) what most people don't realize is that this isn't just a single routine, its actually learning lots of different easier moves and putting them all together.  There's lots of tutorials on YouTube and for starting out I would recommend learning the ""thumb around"".  If you want to make your own balanced pen you can do it fairly easily with a regular Bic pen and 2 grips.  They also sell specialty pens online but most tricks can be done without one."

I've flown on a realistic simulator before (though obviously not one as good as this) and landing a big plane is really hard. If you haven't done it before, you're better off trying to put it down in a field far away from any people, because you are absolutely gonna fuck it up. if you're like me, you may think ""oh, I've played some flying video games before, this can't be that hard.""

Like most musicians, I spent a lot of time playing with a metronome to help with that (I still have trouble with time when playing sometimes, but then again who doesn't?) and playing at 60 bpm is pretty common. I used to listen to a metronome when in the car (for short trips, like getting food) at 60, 70, 90, and 120 bpm and try to tap on the steering wheel along with it for as long as I could. Obviously, working with 60 bpm will give you the 1 second timing interval you're looking for. It's definitely a boring way to learn that timing, but it gets the job done. It's ingrained into me at this point, lol. I even walk in time when I listen to music, I can't help it.   Idk if that was the answer you looking for, but yeah music and metronome training can go a long way if you're disciplined with it. It won't be a perfect 1 second interval, but it works."

Probably the closest to that i could think of short of purchasing the game (which i recommend because it's a great game) is to watch a clock with a second hand, start on an increment of 5 or 0, and tap your knee with a hand along with it 3 times while counting and then look away, while comparing to the clock once you get to 10 and adjusting as needed.   You could probably also look up something like ""postman training majoras mask"" on YouTube and I'm almost positive there's something there you can follow along to. When I'm at a computer, I'll see if i can find a...

When you get to 7 use the separate syllables as part of the rhythm and drop the 2, thus: se-ven -3-4  and similarly se-ven-teen -4  twen-ty-two -4  Edit: Advanced technique : understand that you only get to one second after a second has passed, so you should start with 2-3-4 1 2-3-4 2 .

LearnUselessTalents,3bg819,Timerror,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:17:32 2015 UTC,"Here's the things I have done to learn this skill.   You need a basis for a one-second beat, in your head.  A song that is etched permanently in your mind, which has about 120 beats per minute is best.  The idea is that you can bring that song into your head, count along, and feel intuitively if your count is too slow or too fast.  120 beats per minute is important, as two beat is one second.  My song is actually a classical piece (Handel's Largo, 60 beats per minute). Practice!  Yes, I practice the art.  Not very often, but for a few years I used to do it each night before sleep.  I have a digital clock, and I wait until it changes to the next minute.  I then close my eyes and count.  At fifty seconds, I open my eyes, continue counting, and check out where my count was when the minute changed again.  After doing this about 30 days in a row, I could almost always count within 2-3 seconds.     I tested it just here and now, at work, and got a 54 - can't complain."

LearnUselessTalents,3bem1y,erockthebeatbox,8,Sun Jun 28 16:18:40 2015 UTC,"Well, you've asked a question that happens to be my expertise. I used to beatbox professionally and have played the drums for decades.  First, you need to start learning how to make individual sounds such as a bass drum, snares, and hi hats. To learn the actual techniques I would recommend watching youtube videos which is the same way I started.  After you can make a few basic sounds, begin stringing them together into a beat. Listen to music you enjoy for inspiration. An important part of keeping your beat at a constant tempo is breath control. Certain sounds you make like the bass drum will be performed while exhaling. Other sounds like the snare drum are usually performed while inhaling. So as you see, you will be breathing the entire time, just at a syncopated pace. This is rather difficult to do and will take some time until you can perform the beat for an entire song comfortably.  Don't forget to keep a glass of water near. While generally it's best to stand while beatboxing, do sit down when you get light headed.  The key to success here is repetition. After a few days of practice you'll notice how much better and clearer your sounds are getting, but to get a natural sound to your beats, you're going to have run through them tens of thousands of times.  If anyone has additional questions about vocal scratching, click beats, or singing and beatboxing at the same time (eg. ""If Your Mother Only Knew"" by Rahzel), ask away and I'll try to answer them.  Good Luck!"

LearnUselessTalents,3bem1y,shinyblastoise,3,Sun Jun 28 19:31:36 2015 UTC,"Alright, I'll do my best to explain the basics:  Okay, so you need to create some instruments. Let's start with the hardest one (for me) to figure out: the kick drum. How I figured it out was there was a kid with tourette's I knew that would make this sound in his throat. He didn't open his mouth to make it, it came straight from his throat, so I tried to emulate that sound. Having been already familiar with how to make throat noises, I just shortened it to a quick burst that was identical in sound to a kick drum. So what should you do, as a layman, to begin? Think of the noise the lady makes after she fails on that hilarious grapestomping video. She makes verbal sounds but at first she just makes guttural or throat noises. Emulate those. Keep your mouth closed. The tongue kinda goes back when I do it, I suppose, but I'm not sure that it contributes in any way. Learn how to make sounds with your throat. The kick drum is just a really short version of pretty much any throat sound. Keep getting shorter and shorter while tryign to be louder and louder and eventually, boom - kick drum! Different sounds = different notes.   Next up: Hi-hat.   Once you get the kick drum down, you can use the escaping air to create a hi-hat sound that will automatically keep rhythm with the drum, because you're using the same air. All a hi-hat sound is is a ""tssss"" (like an airhose) but faster and shorter. Make a ""tss"" sound but push it out louder and shorten it up. Eventually you'll figure out that you can inhale and make a hi-hat sound that you can make sound like a double-note or a reverse if you're good at it. That way you can be breathing and beatboxing.   If you can make a ""boom-chick, boom-chick"" with your mouth, keep fucking around with your lips and tongue as you do it and you'll discover that you can modify the sounds to create different beats. I don't know how to explain this part. I literally just used to make sounds while i was showering or bored and see what I could come up with.   Last part that I can explain: Once you get the kick and hi-hat down (practice makes perfect), you should be able to do it rapidly enough to sneak in a deep hum between kicks to create a third noise. Opening and closing your throat makes different sounds.   TL;DR: You just have to fuck around with making sounds with your mouth. Start with the kick drum to create a tempo. Throw in a hi-hat and start making stupid sounds up. That's how greatness is born.   EDIT: I should note that I figured it out by making techno-sounds. You don't necessarily need to do what I wrote above. You can start with the deep hum and try to make some sound in a song you like and figure out how to throw in different instruments with the same breath. What I do if I'm making a non-kick drum based beatbox but want to keep tempo with some sort of percussion sound is click my tongue against my teeth. The same way you'd make the ""tsk tsk tsk"" sound of disapproval while shaking your head. Make that sound. You can do it against different teeth for different sounds and open or close your mouth to modify it further. You can also force air out via your cheeks to make some crazy dubstep sounds. Idk, man. Just start with the techno sounds and keep fuckin around."

The idea is to break out of the connection between words or language and beatboxing. Once you're comfortable with your own tongue, then add a beat. After you can do that, and you understand what beatboxing is; watch videos of beatboxers if you want."

Seriously though, my best guess is it has something to do with finding something to fall over/into to break the fall, so it's not like he's just falling from a standing position.   Also consider that you're essentially watching his highlight reel here : there were lots and lots of times he fell less gracefully, the camera wasn't on or it got left on the editing room floor."
LearnUselessTalents,3b8i2g,PM_ME_UR_VULTURES,19,Fri Jun 26 21:14:34 2015 UTC,"The main key to these falls, is to stay relaxed, if you tense up, you are more likely to stiffen and thus hurt something. As you noticed many of the falls were into a wall or over a railing or something, near waist height, this minimizes the actual impact as you fall first to waist height, then continue onward.  The hardest part is when you head gets near the ground, to avoid letting SMACK the ground but still letting it loll as if you had no control. the best way is to use your arms, to help break your fall, but keep them near your hips/stomach area, just land on your forearms and continue that motion till you are on the ground.  If you really want to practice, do a ""faint"" onto a soft surface, a cushy rug, old mattress, soft grass. From standing, suddenly relax all muscles, and let yourself fall naturally. Try to guide yourself down onto your side, first onto your knees, then let your upper body follow using your forearm break your fall, the first few times to try not to make it realistic get the feeling for catching your self to prevent any injuries, as you get used to it, begin making it look more natural.

The probability of help is inversely related to the number of bystanders. In other words, the greater the number of bystanders, the less likely it is that any one of them will help. Several variables help to explain why the bystander effect occurs. These variables include: ambiguity, cohesiveness and diffusion of responsibility.

LearnUselessTalents,3b8i2g,n0nstick,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:04:17 2015 UTC,"Padded clothing is a start, notice how apart from the pharmacy he is always wearing a jumper, jeans, enclosed shoes and in some cases gloves. That would protect you to an extent from some of the bruises and scratches he would've gotten from falling into the bush or hitting wood straight up.  Again in these videos, just go limp. Don't throw yourself to the ground with force. you see his legs go first and often lower him closer to the ground then the rest of his body goes."
LearnUselessTalents,3b4vwc,MCCornflake1,110,Fri Jun 26 00:08:29 2015 UTC,"Step 1: Pushups  You need to build up the strength in your arms. Your legs have bee carrying you around exclusively for (presumably) almost two decades, your arms have some catching up to do.  Step 2: Start slowly  Once you've built up enough strength to hold yourself up in pushup position for a while without too much trouble, start to incorporate your arms. Do so at a walking pace, you're still learning and moving too fast could mean that you (literally) bite the dust.  Step 3: Increase Speed  Now that you have the hang of walking on four limbs, put on a little speed. Don't let your legs set the pace, your arms still have catch up work to do and you eat shit if you hit the gas too hard.  Step 4: Loping  In the video, he breaks out into a loping sprint that allows him to use his legs to propel himself forward while using his arms to catch himself and maintain balance. Also, notice that his hands don't go completely flat to the ground when they touch land. He uses the base of his fingers like the balls of his feet and his fingers form a spring to help him keep his forward momentum without toppling.   Keep something in mind while you train. Try to get used to bending your knees while you're in 4WD. Not only will thus save your neck from aching from the strain of seeing where you're going, it will allow you to gain more speed and longer strides. Plus it will keep you from running around with your ass in the air like a baboon during mating season. It will take some time to build the leg strength to keep you're knees bent for extended periods of time.   Source: I'm a bear"

However this isn't really good for the cube. But if you don't want to damage your cube and you want a faster, more reliable cube, look at some of the sites some people have linked. They are more versatile cubes and allow you to adjust the spring tension of the center pieces. Looser centers allow you to move faster but will break if you push too hard against another pieces edge. There are also (silicon based - I think) lubes that you can get to further increase the speed without dissolving the plastic."

Early on you'll likely be doing a lot of movements and working finger muscles that you usually don't. Expect your hands to get very tired very fast until you've put in the practice to get them used to this."

LearnUselessTalents,3ayz63,kamikazicondon,8,Thu Jun 25 03:14:59 2015 UTC,"I just returned from climbing that mountain in June. The reason you leave to summit between midnight and 2 am (my group left at 1 am) is because it takes so long, and it's dangerous to be up there during the heat of the day. Leaving at 1 will allow you to summit by 9 or 10 am for a normal group and start your descent before the snow and ice starts getting soft and dangerous during the heat of the day. The reason it takes so long to summit is because as you go higher, it gets harder and harder to breathe, to the point that you take 5 steps and rest for 10 seconds near the top because the air is so thin. The turnaround time, which is the point at which you turn around regardless of whether you have summited or not, changes based on the mountain and snow conditions, but for my trip our turnaround was 10 am."
LearnUselessTalents,3ayz63,JTB54,2,Thu Jun 25 01:08:35 2015 UTC,"I second this... when I climbed here a few years back there was an ice bridge about the size of a diving board over a crevasse (~5,800m)... Probably a foot thick, but we heard some chunks fall into the crevasse while crossing. This was 6am... Wouldn't want to be up there in the afternoon!  It's also a long descent, covering 2 days of going up, so it was nice to have time to relax, and be back in the hostel for a beer by 3pm."
LearnUselessTalents,3ayz63,GringoDan,3,Thu Jun 25 02:24:43 2015 UTC,"Either cos the weather was going to be bad later on, or just so they had the entire day for climbing back down."

LearnUselessTalents,3ardos,Nodroger,13,Tue Jun 23 00:22:18 2015 UTC,"How to really travel safely in Thailand:  1) Tuk tuks are always more expensive than a taxi. They are only for tourists. Don't take them.  2) Insist taxi drivers to use the meter. By law they have to, but of course that's loosely enforced. If they refuse, get out and get a new taxi.  3) Watch out for pickpockets around popular tourist areas.  4) If you get stopped by the police, they probably just want money. Usually it's a ridiculously small amount (under $5), just pay it and avoid the trouble. If it's more, play dumb and they'll probably let you go after 15 minutes of hassling.  5) Keep your passport safe, preferably not on you. Keep a copy with you for ID.  6) Don't rent a car/motorcycle in Bangkok. You don't need it, and unless you're used to driving in Asia you'll probably have an accident."

All you need to do is figure out the commons in a language, for example for japanese it's talking fast, no r sounding stuff and a lot of HA, Ji, Ma, A, O, U, I etc. for german it's more thicker. Nailing the accent and saying words that sound similar to the actual dialect will do you pretty well."

LearnUselessTalents,3aks0u,Askull,2,Tue Jun 23 04:48:39 2015 UTC,"It depends. If you can lead well (initiate the movement of the dance) about any person can be a follower. Leading a partner dance is about knowing how to move another person and yourself at the same time. It takes some time but it's worth it. I can go to a dance floor and make 90% of people look like they know what they're doing. Anyone who is willing to step on the floor will have a blast.   Also, hip hop has many movements that can be traced directly to the 1920s/30s or are influenced by movements of that era. You pick and choose your movement (some are just odd) and adapt it to the situation and music. Watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3iUZiNPds0"
LearnUselessTalents,3aks0u,Askull,2,Tue Jun 23 12:21:45 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I guess if you can lead well you're set. I just assumed your partner would have to have at least some background.  So can you lead them into all that little footwork and all?"
LearnUselessTalents,3aks0u,pounro,2,Tue Jun 23 17:13:28 2015 UTC,"TLDR:   Swing is the shit, yo.   Feet may move weird. Laugh Much.  This is my haiku    The little footwork isn't needed to have fun, but knowing how to do it opens up different ways to have fun. Kind of like a different opening or combination in chess.  Followers do have a harder time in that they need a lead to help give them some movement to play with. I can go to a wedding and have a blast swing dancing, but I would have a harder time finding a leader so I can follow. (I do both rolls but I like being the leader more)  To me, it's less about doing it ""right"", and more about having fun. Swing dancing is a blast! That's why people did it during the great depression and why it's still around today. To have fun there is some technique in there (painful/jerky movement is bad), but with social dancing every dance is a new situation.   If you make swing (or anything) your passion, improving technique is important. But, to meet a person for the first time, ask them to dance, hold on to their hands, and then rock out to some music is more about fun than the moves you know. Bill Nye says, ""It's the coolest thing ever.""[1] To quote a swing song, ""Ain't what you do it's the way that you do it.""  [1]www.latimes.com/health/la-he-five-questions-nye-20140111-story.html"

LearnUselessTalents,3aks0u,BeerFlavoredNipples,3,Sun Jun 21 23:51:27 2015 UTC,"How To Dance  Some Basics  How I dance as a guy  For your stance.  I'm tall and to be less intimidating I crouch a little. Like a batter in baseball does, feet shoulder width apart. If your not used to doing this for long periods of time it will hurt the first time.     For your arms look at the guy in the red shirt.  Keep them about halfway in your torso and move them to go with the rest of your body. Treat them as a whole not two parts. If you move your right arm across your body follow it with your left. You look like your flailing your arms when you move them independently. If a song has lyrics that you can sign do that. For example in this song when they count feel free to do what she does. When I do this with each number I pop my hand forward. If the song mentions a girl feel free to point to a girl your dancing with.     Match Your Partner or Group  If your dancing with someone who is going side to side, go side to side with them. If they are doing small steps forward and backward do that. If there is a song that has a specific dance and you don't know it look at people that do. Last night I was at a party and Watch Me was played. I didn't know what to do so you continue what you were doing before look at what others are doing and learn from that.     It helps to have a friend  When you are first starting to dance it helps to have someone who is willing to go on the floor with you. It doesn't matter if it's a guy or girl. If you don't have anyone for that scan for a person who is having fun dancing alone and join them. They should be happy to have a partner, if not find someone else. If for some reason no one dancing wants to dance with you find someone who is watching the dance floor and ask them if they want to dance. They definitely want to dance. After dancing for 5-10 minutes you become more comfortable.     What to do with your face/head  Smile! Always remember to smile. If you smile your group/partner will smile. It's contagious and it makes you happy and it's more fun. If your dancing with a partner look them in their eyes. It makes it personal and helps you be less worried at other people watching. If you know the words to a song it's great to mouth them/say them(loud enough for your group/partner can hear, don't yell).      Remember to have fun that's what dancing's about     Some Tips   One of the most important things about dancing is to not stop when your with someone. If the last one in a group stops dancing it's over. Do your best to make sure this doesn't happen. It's much easier to stay dancing then to start.  When a new song is played/mixed in it's acceptable to slow down and adjust to the new song. This means stay dancing, don't posture up and become still.  If you want to say something to them it's fine to lean in if the musics loud. Just don't headbutt them. If a song goes mute like this most people will freeze and then continue when it comes back. See next tip. If a song gets more intense at the drop match that. You should try and match the speed/intensity of the song. If a song that sounds Latin/Spanish is played do small steps forward and backward and move your hips. You will get sweaty. It will be hot. It's okay.  If you need to take a break. Take a break. Get water or a drink. If your sweaty go to the bathroom and dry yourself off.  When you want to take a break don't just walk off if you have a partner. Motion with your head or point off the dance floor/ to the refreshments they will get the message. This is the time to talk. But remember to keep the breaks short so you can go back do dancing. You can always talk later.   An Example   I can almost guarantee the DJ will play Fireball by Pitbull, but regardless Pitbull does a great job dancing in this song. He's got a good stance and moves confidently. This is also a good example of how to use your hands with the song.   See More  This article will also go a long way in helping you dance  If I forgot anything or you have any questions comment or pm me.  tl;dr Read it."

I've also been caller 5 then couldn't get through. The messages I always got was ""Station Name You're caller 5! Try again! Click."" Didn't even get a chance to talk.

LearnUselessTalents,3aix2z,SgtShadow,22,Sat Jun 20 21:58:59 2015 UTC,"If they tell you that your number so and so, most likely they're either looking for someone else, or already got someone. Back when I ran contests, I would text my friends a 'secret phrase' to say if they called in for a contest and I was on air. That's pretty common but you can get fired if they catch you. It would usually be 'oh my god please, please tell me I'm number X! I NEEEEEEEEEED (insert prize here)' that way I knew it was them, and I always had good content to broadcast. On the EXTREMELY RARE OCCASIONS (LESS THAN 5 TIMES) did I actually wait for caller X due to boredom. Crazy people and stoners that are HEELLLLLLLLA high usually got on air for obvious reasons."

I'm obliged by contesting rules in Ontario to take whatever caller I'm calling out for. I'm not allowed to tell caller 9 that they're actually caller 8.  However, it's pretty universal, that if you're calling, you sound like my demo, and you sound like you're going to make great radio, if you're caller 6, but I need caller 9, I might make you caller 9. My goal isn't to give away the tickets or whatever I'm giving away, my goal is to make you think oh cool! I can win that too!   I don't know what the laws are like in US, but if you're caught not following contesting properly in Ontario, it can be pretty bad. OLG likes to stick their nose in everything.

Any time I even got through I just waited for the cue to call, gave a moderately-paced count of callers, and dialed in after I got to whatever number they wanted (so to be the ninth caller, I'd punch in the final digit of the phone number as I counted to 9).  Patience is a virtue. There's a lot of pressure on your head to dial dial dial fast fast fast now now now, but once you're in the queue you're stuck; if you were too fast, there's virtually no chance you can find that out, hang up, re-dial & get through before they get a winning caller.  Of course, if you're too slow that's no good either. Hence the counting! Find out where in the queue you landed, and pace your count accordingly for the next time.  There's no way to guarantee across different DJs, different stations & different times of day that you'll land a coveted spot, but if you use the same strategy on your end enough times, you can usually get it relatively close & leave it up to pure chance only at the very end."

How do I know if I my business phone system has a PRI? If you have your own unique ten digit direct number that calls just your office phone, you're probably using a PRI or VoIP trunks to access the phone network.

Or in this example, just call and ask them, sometimes the DJs were super lazy and would forget to give stuff away."
LearnUselessTalents,3aix2z,DrMody,2,Sat Jun 20 21:05:29 2015 UTC,"Okay, as someone who's successfully won about 20 radio contests, I'm probably the only professional here. The best way to do it is to have a few friends with you. If it's a quiz and you really want to win it, Google it, (but if you've already one that month, just guess because that's kind of a dick move).   Things to know:    your voice will never go straight to radio, instead they want to have your ""I won"" conversation before they broadcast it.  Even if you have an answer, you're not likely to make it in on the first dial so hang up every 20 seconds and try again. Get a whole car to do it as soon as the question is asked and someone will make it through.  Don't worry about guessing, and have fun with it. There's a chance you'll still be on the radio even with a wrong answer. And  Try until they give you the answer.    Now for the ""be this caller"" contests, just get everyone in the car or in the house to call over and over again. Again, hang up after 10-20 seconds if you don't make it through and redial until you get the tickets, or you're told that you didn't."

I've been having the hardest time the last year getting up because of the medication I'm taking now, really need something  like this. Putting the alarm across the room doesn't work for me, because I'll either sleep through it, or just crawl across the room and turn it off and just get back in bed"
LearnUselessTalents,3ajfs9,huott,7,Sun Jun 21 11:40:51 2015 UTC,"I heard that sleep happens in 90 minute cycles, and at the end of each 90 minute cycle, you would be most prepared to wake up  So however long you sleep, make sure it's in increments of 90 minutes, and it should theoretically be easier to wake up when your alarm goes off"
LearnUselessTalents,3ajfs9,Ghasois,6,Sat Jun 20 23:24:02 2015 UTC,"Something I did when I had trouble waking up was put the alarm across the room from your bed.  Make it so you can't turn the alarm off from where you sleep, then you'll have to at least PHYSICALLY get up to turn it off.  edit: Herp, I interpreted it as you just ignoring your alarm, not sleeping totally through it.

LearnUselessTalents,3a7hg2,sesamee,2,Thu Jun 18 12:22:01 2015 UTC,"Do you mean the sounds or the languages? Icelandic and Welsh are both Indo-European, but Icelandic is Germanic and Welsh is Celtic."
LearnUselessTalents,3a7hg2,Snowman304,3,Thu Jun 18 13:32:19 2015 UTC,Yes this is why I ask. It seems remarkable that two quite distant languages use double-L to signify what to a non-native speaker sounds like a quite similar sound.
LearnUselessTalents,3a7hg2,sesamee,3,Thu Jun 18 14:34:30 2015 UTC,"Well, there are coincidences in linguistics. For example, the Arabic word for Earth is arḍ (أرض), and the Dutch word for Earth is aard. The languages are from entirely different language families; Arabic is Semitic and Dutch is Indo-European.  This differs from the nearly universal words for mothers (mama, mom, mum, ma, etc.) and father (papa, baba, aba, etc.) Some languages switch these or use different formal words, but these terms are derived from babbling babies rather than some universal language."
LearnUselessTalents,3a7hg2,Snowman304,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:13:19 2015 UTC,"Quite a good observation, actually! They're not the same, but they're related mechanisms. The Welsh /ll/ is [ɬ], which does exist in Icelandic such as in the ""l"" in ""Stelpa"" (meaning ""girl""). That sound is made by pushing air over the sides of the tongue when it's in in roughly the same shape as when you make an ""L"" sound (capital letter is just so you can distinguish it from an i).   In the case of the Icelandic /ll/, it's first a [t] followed by a voiceless L sound, which is mechanically almost identical to [ɬ], but your tongue is a little lower down. If you know how to make the Welsh /ll/ then try and compare that to an L sound."
LearnUselessTalents,3a7hg2,Haoleopteryx,48,Thu Jun 18 16:26:26 2015 UTC,"Nope. Not a chance in hell. I also love how he differentiated that it's not a ""t"" but a ""chk"" or whatever, and to my English brain they're pretty much the same noise."
LearnUselessTalents,3a7hg2,Reostat,20,Wed Jun 17 23:24:49 2015 UTC,"I always thought that was cool as hell. That depending on what language you speak and what noises you're used to hearing, you can actually distinguish slight differences that other people can't."
LearnUselessTalents,3a7hg2,NoGuide,32,Thu Jun 18 00:59:10 2015 UTC,"As an English speaker it bugs me though. We are used to hearing accents, whether it's Scandinavians having trouble with the ""th"" sounds, Chinese with the ""r"", whatever... I hear your accent and it's just... A different English, not wrong. I also have no problem understanding heavy accents.   But heaven forbid I fuck up the slight trill speaking a non-english language, everyone suddenly has no fucking clue what I'm saying. IT'S GODDAMN CLOSE ENOUGH YOU CUNTS, HOW DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND ME?"
LearnUselessTalents,3a7hg2,Reostat,15,Thu Jun 18 01:22:33 2015 UTC,"But what you come to understand after you study another language is that what sounds ""close enough"" to you is not at all close enough to a native speaker. Each system of writing words in English will have it's own complex rules. Example: Chinese Pinyin ""I"" sound versus English short ""I"" sound. Very different. To a native speaker who doesn't know both systems, the confusion is understandable. If you don't know Chinese pronunciation and you try to read a Pinyin Chinese sentence to a Chinese person who doesn't know English pronunciation, they won't understand. It's not a wilful lack of understanding, just differences and difficulties cropping up.   Plus, remember, the accents you're used to hearing are generally from very proficient speakers, who have years of study. For new speakers, their accents are very strong. The average person doesn't come in contact with a new speaker unless they teach them. For example, I teach ESL. Even I have a hard time understanding new or low level students until I adjust to their accents and particular patterns. I'm much better at it now after having studied Chinese and being an experienced teacher."

I understand your points, but trust me when I say, I deal on a daily basis figuring out what people are saying, and most of the time the accent is horrendous. I stand by my assertion that English, as a global language, inherently has MANY ""accents"" and native English speakers are much much more proficient in understanding non-native speakers than any other language.   Close enough for them is good enough for me to understand."
LearnUselessTalents,3a7hg2,Reostat,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:42:54 2015 UTC,"I understand your points as well.

The video teaches you to sing along that part of Eminem's ""Rap God"" but the learning method applies to listening as well. The video starts with an extremely slowed down version mostly because this is something you're also supposed to learn by heart so if you're only practicing your listening skills you don't need to. Set a goal and get there by increments, the most important thing is what he calls ""over practice"": practice at a higher speed than the one you intend to use so that your selected speed sounds comfortable in comparison. In the video he goes up to 110% of the real speed, but there's a second video where he takes it up to 150%.   tl;dr: practice as fast as you can then use it at the highest speed you get nearest 100% comprehension. Keep practicing. Repeat."

How I do this it I gasp for air through my mouth keeping no/little air coming through my nose while inhaling.  Now when doing this there is a muscle you have to flex that will divert the air into a chamber where you burp from.  Its hard to explain but if you play around and flex different muscles in your throat you should be able to find it.  anyways when you feel that chamber fill up, you should be able to force the air out and it will create a burp.  Im sorry if this doesnt make alot of sense but that is how i have always done it on command."
LearnUselessTalents,3a1lip,joeythehamster,1 point,Tue Jun 16 15:44:15 2015 UTC,I just did 160bpm. Then I felt like I was going to pass out. I guess I've always taken for granted the ability to burp on command. It is hard to explain how to do it.

Just couldn't do it. Would down soda bottles and every thing, no burps.   Then on a road trip home from Florida to NY, I got sick. I mean really REALLY sick. Puking, intense pain, thought I was going to die. Pulled over to do what I thought was puke.  Instead, I burped. I burped a long fucking time. Ever since then, I burp like normal."

LearnUselessTalents,3a1lip,FUPA69,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:53:35 2015 UTC,"Here's what I do, and it is difficult to describe in words but maybe this will make sense. If you visualize the insides of your neck, try to think of there being two pipes. One pipe leads to your lungs, the other leads to your stomach. To force yourself to burp, you're going to effectively ""breathe"" air in to your stomach rather than your lungs. As soon as you breathe in this air, you will immediately feel like your need to burp. If you push this burp out hard enough you will let more of the trapped air out of your stomach than you originally took in. What if you push out and you don't have any air there? Well usually I can tell because I'll get immediate heartburn, which is essentially your stomach acid coming up too high in your stomach pipe (to use my silly imagery). I have always stopped then, but I imagine if you pushed out hard enough you could throw up.  So, the actual act. Breathe in constantly either through your mouth or nose, but breathe in fast enough that you can hear yourself breathing. What you're going to try to do is tighten a muscle in your neck to try and stop the air from coming in. You will keep using your regular muscles to breathe in, but you will block it with this new muscle. To get a feel for this muscle, I picture it almost as a flap that lays over the pipe to my lungs. In engaging the muscle, I sometimes push my head out forward, accompanied with a sharper intake of air, almost like a gasp. You will probably accidentally block off your airway once or twice before you can get a sense of doing it on purpose. Now when you have blocked off your airway, keep breathing in. You'll notice that your ability to breathe in is stronger than your blocking ability. With your pipe blocked, breathe in harder and the air should head towards your stomach. Experiment with the amount you need to breathe in vs. the amount you can get out. Sometimes if you just hold this airway open after the block, you'll find that a large pocket of air rushes upwards to escape. Good luck!"

Sanding works by moving abrasive  (commonly aluminum oxide)particles over a surface. These abrasive particles will be dislodged from their backing sometimes or the areas in between them can become clogged. That's why many Sanders move in full circles or rotate belts. It exposes fresh sandpaper to your working surface and prevents excessive clogging. (Though some abrasive meshes are better at preventing this at a price of durability) Toothbrushes like this rotate one way a little bit, then back the other way, and the cycle repeats.  This means you aren't exposing a lot of sanding surface to the material, abrasive particles will be knocked off or gum up in the small area that is getting to it, and it will be pretty ineffective for almost any task. It's creative for sure... just not useful for any application I can think of."

The whole process took about 3-4 months but I would get up earlier than usual, 30-40 minutes, have some water and a coffee and give myself some time sitting on the toilet. I didn't have to poop necessarily I would sit there for 10-15, catch up on news, plan my morning and day, do some last minute homework/studying whatever.  After sometime I adapted and started pooping. This also may have come about by drinking a liter or so of water within an hour of going to sleep and the early AM coffee but still. Soon I didn't need the coffee nor the hydration.  TLDR; regiment yourself to have poop times and your body will follow"

Plus you'll be buzzing while taking a shit. Best shit you'll ever have (until you get addicted and you only feel relaxed and have no buzz)."
LearnUselessTalents,39ea85,sigmastat,7,Thu Jun 11 22:13:07 2015 UTC,"There's a process in your body called the gastrocolic reflex which basically means that when there is enough poop collected in your rectum, and food/fluid (of a sufficient volume) enters your stomach, it sends a neuronal signal to your rectum to initiate peristalsis, giving you the urge to poop. If at the same time you take caffeine, the caffeine will also increase the tendency for peristalsis to occur, and you will find a much more powerful urge to go than before. Also increasing the bulk of your poop with fiber is going to make peristalsis easier to initiate AND less strenuous on your ass muscles. Additionally, dry poop can also make the process unnecessarily uncomfortable, so keep your hydration up throughout the day (they've done that one to death for a reason... Simply keeping hydrated enough is often enough to relieve constipation). One last thing, the first urge to poop is the strongest because it involves parasympathetic reflexes too. Ignore that one and let it pass, and the subsequent attempts to go will only be consciously using your abdominal muscles to force the stuff out.   So, to recap:  1) have more fiber throughout day. 2) drink lots of water throughout day. 3) when you wake up, drink a glass or two of water. 4) followed by a cup of coffee, or a smoke (nicotine has           peristaltic effects just like caffeine) 5) when the call comes'a callin', you better not be stallin'."

I know I should need to go, but no dice. I've also noticed that when I exercise and eat a more low-carb diet (read: much higher in fiber), I'm going like once a day. Is it just the fiber? Or exercise? Or both? I don't particularly notice a change in volume as much as actually experiencing the urge to go and not having to force it."

LearnUselessTalents,39cylo,phat_beatsies,45,Wed Jun 10 22:48:56 2015 UTC,The real key is to freeze the ice slowly and directionally.   No boiling necessary.  I fill a gallon size insulated cooler and stick it in the freezer. Since the sides and bottom are insulated it freezes top down. In about 24 hours you'll have a large chunk of crystal clear ice with a layer of cloudy ice at the bottom. Then just break up the ice with an ice pick and throw out the cloudy part.
LearnUselessTalents,39cylo,hello_josh,11,Thu Jun 11 01:50:07 2015 UTC,This. There is no reason to boil or anything else than freeze the water from one direction only. preferably from the bottom I believe.

LearnUselessTalents,39cylo,Questhate1,9,Thu Jun 11 05:32:29 2015 UTC,"The boiling thing doesn't actually work. It's not air bubbles, it's pressure forcing the crystals to form in non-uniform ways due to freezing from the outside in. Here is the actual way to do it. You need to freeze it in a linear fashion so the crystals have room to grow without excess pressure screwing up crystallization. You'll still get some cloudy spots at one end, but you just need to cut them off with an ice cutter."
LearnUselessTalents,39cylo,Volsunga,38,Thu Jun 11 04:21:10 2015 UTC,"Hey! Something I'm good at!  The only thing which causes the 'white' is air trapped inside while freezing. There are a few ways to get rid it.   The easiest way by far is to just boil the shit out of it, filter, then boils again and then freeze it. If you freeze it way too slow you'll end up with bubbles close to the top of the cube. If you freeze it way too fast you'll end up with large bubbles in the middle. Your average freezer would work fine. Best for 'non-white' ice mass production of ice and commonly seen in high quality, high density ice makers is the method of freezing moving water.  Yes, this is more difficult, time consuming, and wasteful but it does produce the highest quality ice.   All that needs to be done is water near freezing temperature needs to flow over a metal sheet (an evaporator) which is well below freezing.   The rest is just design."

Yes, those leaves are green.  But what kind of green? You'd almost never use the paint swatch as is. Mix it up,  maybe with contrasting color, to get as close to the real color as possible.  I find that using the white of the canvas to represent the shines (specular)  and lighter bits can look nice.   Train your eye, and your hand will follow. If you can't draw,  pick up ""how to draw what you see"" and paint over your exercises from that.   I'm a programmer, and just paint as a hobby.

LearnUselessTalents,393ouy,vinny-is-a-cat,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:13:54 2015 UTC,"I love watercolors. Most people hate it. It takes time and patience before it actually starts to look good. When you first start painting it looks like shit. But the thing is, you can only paint when the canvas is dry if you're layering. I have two methods. Layering and plopping down colors on wet canvas which gives it a cool effect but is hard to control.  The method I would recommend for a beginner is the layering technique. Have a light pencil drawing of what you want to paint. First start out with a light base like yellow or watered down blue, brown, w/e. If you know there is a highlight somewhere be sure to not paint on that because you can't really erase that, you can paint over it with like white acrylic or marker or something though if it happens anyway. This wash unifies the entire painting. Then you start putting in the base colors that you want the subjects to be. Remember don't be too heavy handed with color you can always add more pigment but you can't take away. If you accidently add too much or it bleeds into another color if it's still wet you can blot the spot with a paper towel and it'll get rid of the worst of it. Now wait for that to dry.   Then I start going darker, adding shadows. To get a nice shadow I always add the complimentary color to the main color, never use black unless it's really dark, black tends to flatten out objects. Sometimes I play around with colors until I think it looks interesting. Now you have to wait again till it dries.  Now is the touch up stage. So if you see something you don't like you can attempt to get rid of it. If you wet an area you can lightly scrub it and it'll make the paint fade a little. Or you can add more paint or w/e needs to be done.  Some fun things to do with watercolor: I like to add salt when it's wet, the salt absorbs the water and the color so it gives it a neat effect. Putting plastic wrap all crinkled on top of the paint when it's drying gives it like a shattered glass effect. You can use a razor to make interesting edges. Etc.  Oh and sometimes I just like to layer colors, like the bottom layer is blue, let it dry, then I paint red on top and it'll still be purple. Unlike acrylic they are easy to layer and not opaque.  Hope that helped."
LearnUselessTalents,393ouy,no_you_cannot,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:07:34 2015 UTC,"Ignore people needing to tell you that you have to be able to draw well. It is not a prerequisite to being  a good painter. But, you want to be good so here's what you need to learn before you pick up a brush...  Principles of art: things like composition, texture, weight, form... here's a list: http://www.projectarticulate.org/principles.php  Color theory: This is a complex enough subject that a single site, unless made for art classes, is not going to be enough. Value, chroma, color wheels, ciomplimentary colors, the munsell color system, split-complimentary, reflective color, why the eye works the way it does (which will tell you why you don't put red next to blue), etc ad naseum. This is a primer:http://www.colormatters.com/color-and-design/basic-color-theory  If you want to include drawing (and I suggest you don't): learn the difference between 6B and 2H, charcoal, compressed charcoal, conte, watercolor pencils (the only thing useful in this group), paper and the different kinds of tooth it has, india ink. Learn about the different kinds of paper for water color, sketching, newsprint, ink, and painting.  Figure drawing (again, not needed): proportions of the body, not seeing an eye as a symbolic eye, shades, anatomy, gradients. Start with ""Drawing on the Left Side of the Brain."" Decent book, has it's problems.  Painting: Nope, not watercolor yet. Start with.... acrylic. Water color has it's own difficulties and you shouldn't compound them with learning how a brush works at the same time. Learn how the acrylic color system works, matte medium, gloss medium, terms like carrier and pigment and tint and shade. Practice until you know the differences between a dagger brush and a filbert, round and fan and when to use each. Learn how to storyboard your whole paining until you get exactly the way you want. Learn how to include the background at this step and work the whole painting at the same time and include a little of each color in the entire piece. There's a lot of theory that goes into this so read ""The Art Spirit"" by Robert Henri. Learn how the canvas reacts and how it's different from painting on paper.  Water color painting! Congratulations! You've made it. All that previous training pays off here because, guess what? You have to plan your whole painting. Unlike any other medium, there's no going back and correcting your mistakes. Once you lay down a stroke, it's there. You have to understand how color works so you can plan which order to lay down the paint so that you get what you want instead of a muddy colored mess. If you're not using a white watercolor paint (called gouache), you need to plan every area carefully and lay down your colors light to dark because, like I said, you can't go back.  After this, practice. Practice like it's all that matters in life. A few years down the line, you might be good enough to start selling them. Good luck  Source: I have a Bachelor's in Fine Art with concentrations in painting, drawing, photography and design."

You use your whole arm, starting from your shoulder but incorporating your bicep and forearm. Once it leaves your hand and starts drifting away, you remember that you want to spin it, so you reach out with the same hand that you threw it with and snag the corner on the crook of your finger, applying pressure from your wrist, to spin it. Getting a rock to skip is basically the same thing but without letting it go first. Get a flat rock and hold it in the crook of your index finger. You use your arm to give it power and your wrist just applies the spin at the end. Works best with medium hefty stones but I have literally skipped bricks a few times. Getting your stance low so that the rock hits the water with very little vertical component helps too. Doesn't work with waves, also."

LearnUselessTalents,38n51x,Kborn,38,Fri Jun 5 08:31:47 2015 UTC,TL;DR for those who don't want to watch the video    The cards are arranged in the order needed in advance. Then some false cuts and false shuffles are done to give the impression that the order must have changed but in fact it is the same. During the trick more false cuts are used and at one point the audience member cuts the pack but because one card is slightly bent at the corner they tend to cut it where the magician wants and even when they don't the bend makes it easy to fix that problem.
LearnUselessTalents,38n51x,Creabhain,9,Fri Jun 5 11:18:19 2015 UTC,But what about when Bill Malone does it? An audience member cuts and prevents a false cut by aligning the cards...

LearnUselessTalents,38n51x,brickoftr00th,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:32:04 2015 UTC,Isn't there a method using a tapered deck? The cards are ever so slightly wider on one end than the other. By rotating the top card you now have an easy way to find it again after a cut since it sticks out slightly from the others. I'm sure there are other ways but that is one.
LearnUselessTalents,38n51x,Creabhain,10,Sat Jun 6 12:06:59 2015 UTC,As someone mentioned below the original is called Same the Bellhop by Bill Malone. I feel the need to make sure the original is known in every thread that mentions a trick like this. Give credit where due and all that.   Anyways its all slight of hand and false cuts and shuffles. Check out /r/magic. They can give resources and recommend ways to learn this specific routine but also other things that work in general for all card magic. I enjoy the Card College series.

Of course, if you're happy with your performance and don't want to master or perfect your craft...You can just say it's easy and criticize an honest look on the effect."
LearnUselessTalents,38n51x,ApocketCrocketE,6,Sat Jun 6 02:22:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not definitely sure this is how he does it, but this is my best guess...   Write ""story"" using all the cards and put cards in that order. Clamp them together in a vice/G-Clamp/similar. Cut one long edge of the deck on a taper, so that the cards on the front and back are slightly different widths, but not significantly enough to be obviously different. Shuffle cards and start telling the story, every time you reach a cue to pull out a card, skim your fingers lightly from top to bottom lengthways over the long edges of the deck. This should let you grab the widest card (top of the ordered deck). Being Irish is preferable but not essential"

LearnUselessTalents,38n51x,SamCropper,3,Fri Jun 5 14:48:45 2015 UTC,"You have to crimp the corner of the bottom card to find where the deck was cut to.  Your technique does exist as a gaffed card deck, but would only work if the audience member turned half of the deck 180o when they put the cards back, so you could feel the taper. Plus anyone handling the deck might also feel the taper, giving up the secret."
LearnUselessTalents,38n51x,geist_zero,2,Fri Jun 5 14:51:47 2015 UTC,"...would only work if the audience member turned half of the deck 180o when they put the cards back, so you could feel the taper. Plus    Sorry, I've read back my original comment and can see how you misunderstood what I'm saying. I mean the cut would be parallel to the opposite edge of the card, but the bottom (last in the story) would be slightly narrower than the top card. It wouldn't matter which orientation they were in. The problem would be making the difference in width significant enough to be able to 'grab' the next card, but not so much that it is obvious to the audience."
LearnUselessTalents,38n51x,SamCropper,3,Fri Jun 5 15:13:58 2015 UTC,Interesting idea actually. I imagine the taper would have to be so drastic for it to be useful it would get noticed pretty quickly.

You're cheating yourself out of the experience; sure it's going to be easier, but now you're limited in how you can present the story; everything is stripped instead of a natural ability to perform false cuts and pass's, false shuffles and everything.  Not to mention, if you're going to be stripping cards out each time, the audience will pick up on the pattern.  Don't cheap out and use a Svengali deck, not on this effect."

LearnUselessTalents,38huoz,chickoryphish,5,Thu Jun 4 10:02:59 2015 UTC,"It's basically just a visual way to divide up a multiplication problem. So let's take 13*14 in the usually taught way.   First step: multiply 3*4 which gives you 12, or 2 in the 1s place with an extra 10, or a carried 1 in the 10s place.   Next, you multiply the 10 from the 13 to the 4 in the 14, which gives 40, or 4 in the 10s place.   Now since you have nothing carried to the 100s place, you can just multiply the 1s in 14 and 13 and get 100.   Then you multiply the 10 from the 14 to the 3 in the 13, which gives 30, or 3 in the tens place. Which is just 100, or 1 in the 100s place.   Now since you have a 3, 4, and 1 in the 10s place you can add them together and get 8 in the 10s place, or 80.   And finally add everything together. You have a 1 in the hundreds place, an 8 in the 10s place, and a 2 in the 1s place (or 100+80+2) which gives you 182.   The method is exactly the same as regular multiplication (where crossing lines works exactly like multiplication).  The other guy is right, it's just FOILing the problem of (10+3)(10+4) to get 100 + 40 + 30 + 12 = 182, but that's not very useful to someone who is just now learning multiplication."

Nobody stood up in front of the state legislature and said, ""You know, math sucks, and is hard. Pi is especially hard. Nerds say it goes on forever, but I say we just make it 3.2."" Although that would be kind of amazing in a train-wreck sort of way. No, what happened is there is a really old problem in Mathematics. Or, at least, there was, back in the day. It was called ""Squaring the Circle"" (as a bonus fun fact, that phrase has gone on to mean trying to do something impossible). Basically, it goes: using a straight-edge and a compass, can you construct a square with the same area of a given circle. And the answer is no, you can't, because pi is transcendental. But that was only proved in 1882, and not everybody was convinced. One such unconvinced person, thought he had it. In 1897 (just 15 years after pi was proved to be transcendental, so it's not like this was a hundred-year-old fact at the time), some genius thought he'd figured out a way to square the circle. Neat. So, after showing off his method to some folks who were NOT mathematicians, he finally showed it to a state representative, and asked that a law be passed recognizing his achievement, and saying that the state could use this mathematical proof free of charge (one assumes other states would have to pay royalties or something) in their schools. Anyway, he was wrong. Like, dead-wrong. Somewhere in his mass of convoluted mathematics, he estimated pi at 3.2 Which, since he was trying to get a law passed, would mean that the state of Indiana would be legislating that pi = 3.2. Which is dumb, but you can hardly blame senators for not being mathematicians. If someone brought you a paper that said pi = 3.2, you'd probably laugh at them. If someone brought you a paper claiming to have solved some really hard problem, and inside was an assumption that pi = 3.2... well, you probably wouldn't know, or care, enough to figure it out. And that's what happened. Bill passed the House no problem. Probably would have passed the Senate, too, if it were not for a random mathematician. A local professor from Purdue happened to be around the day it was supposed to go up for a vote. Having heard about this, he said, ""Wait just one fucking minute. Squaring the circle? Bullshit, lemme see that."" He very quickly spotted the error, and coached the state senators on why it was wrong, and how they were about to look really fucking stupid. So they had some fun making fun of the guy, and the bill. Still, the fucking thing almost passed, until one senator wised up and was like, ""I don't think we have the power to define mathematical truths here."" So... yeah. It was a real thing, and it was really stupid, but not quite as stupid as it sounds at first, and really, anybody could have been fooled."

LearnUselessTalents,38f3db,bjokey,33,Mon Jun 8 16:49:54 2015 UTC,"My father was a voiceover guy for a few years.  He says it really is about from where in your mouth you talk.  In other words, where the heart of pronunciation takes place.    Americans with a Midwestern accent (what people in California talk like, minus the surfer voice) generally talk from just behind the tip of their tongue, behind the upper incisors.  With experimentation you can find where to talk from for each accent, but some ones I've found are:  *Australian - Talk from the middle of your tongue, towards the back.  Flexing the back of your tongue helps.  *Indian (like Apu on simpsons) is from low in the throat, just above the adam's apple.  *Scottish (like in Braveheart) you make your tongue stiffer in back (I find this is similar across irish, english, scottish, and australian accents, come to think of it) but talk from about an inch into the back of your tongue, about where the uvula is.  *Irish (like Lucky Charms guy) is spoken from low in the mid nasal cavity  Cockney English, for me, involves dropping my jaw.  Queens english is largely about your style of elocution and thus is spoken with the very tip of your tongue from just in your nasal cavity.  That's what I've found.  If you focus on the mechanics of how to do an accent, you can carry the accent into whatever you want to say, rather than just practicing dropping R's and saying things that sound irish or australian or whatnot."
LearnUselessTalents,38f3db,boblahblahblah,5,Thu Jun 4 04:57:27 2015 UTC,"I find this advice helps when I'm explaining to people how to say something in Spanish. The tip of the tongue hits every consonant hard, and the vowels are dryer. Whereas in English (American here) everything sounds wet, the tongue mostly floats in the middle of the mouth not touching much except for a light flick on the front teeth every now and then for your T's and D's."

Then begin to note little quirks and patterns the accents have. For example, the generic American accent has a distinct ""r"" sound (I'm from the UK btw), as can be heard in words like ""course"" or ""car"". Or a generic southern Asian (i.e. Indian) accent pronounces ""v"" sounds as a light ""b"". (eg. Dove = Dobh) This sound is best heard if you do this: close your mouth, but keep your lips relaxed. Blow out until your lips come apart, it shouldn't take too much pressure. The sound that arises is similar to that of the ""v"" in the Asian accent."

Once you have worked out the tune and tone of the language, start taking notes of slang and nuances, again not falling into stereotypes, for example if you were imitating an English accent, not a single English person in the last 200 years has said ""ELLO DERE GUVNA! OW'S THE OL' HIGGLTEE PIGGLTEE GOING?, CARE FOR A SPOT OF TEA OL' CHUM?"" it would be more like ""Fancy a cup-a-tea?""

Talking out my ass about the pants but if you are reloading or hell shooting one handed burning should be the last on your mind.

You're out there doing field training and tossing your mags around, you want to make sure you get them all back.  We also sometimes tape them if there's different amounts of ammo for when we're doing rifle qual.  I know other people tape them for other reasons, but it's really always been a pain in the as when we do it. The tape wears from the mags being jammed into and pulled out of pouches and gets dirty, then it starts peeling off and sticking to shoot, then the mags themselves get this sticky shit on them. I don't know, maybe we're just doing it wrong, but I hate tape on my mags."

LearnUselessTalents,384vx2,HannasAnarion,8,Tue Jun 2 03:49:11 2015 UTC,It's not hard. Rifles designed for combat like AK and the AR-15 and military variants have virtually no recoil.
LearnUselessTalents,384vx2,DerpTheGinger,2,Tue Jun 2 04:35:22 2015 UTC,Huh.  That actually makes a lot of sense
LearnUselessTalents,384vx2,DrCat_dds,3,Tue Jun 2 06:46:33 2015 UTC,"virtually no recoil.   More like, ""less than you think"", less than a shot gun."
LearnUselessTalents,384vx2,inurshadow,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:18:55 2015 UTC,"The buffer absorbing and sending the bolt back really does reduce a lot of recoil. The rifle wouldn't move more than a foot rearward without anything stopping it, let alone a grown adult in the way."
LearnUselessTalents,384vx2,kallekilponen,8,Tue Jun 2 21:44:50 2015 UTC,With a properly adjusted sling he wouldn't have to do it like that. Doing it when hanging on the sling would have the added benefit of being able to clear a jam as well. It isn't that difficult to swap the magazine of an AK one-handed.

Just to help out, he tilts the rifle towards him to figure out why it stopped shooting, sees that it's empty, couches down and clamps the gun in his knee, pulls the magazine and replaces it with a full one, pulls the bolt closed, does some fancy kick as he stands up and starts shooting again.   The real talent here is shooting one handed."
LearnUselessTalents,384vx2,Blagginspaziyonokip,16,Mon Jun 1 23:20:59 2015 UTC,Wasn't it obvious what he was doing? I've never touched a gun and I understood what he was doing. I have played some FPS though.
LearnUselessTalents,384vx2,RuTsui,3,Tue Jun 2 00:33:50 2015 UTC,"Well, people have different levels of knowledge. I personally thought it was odd that he checked the chamber. If you're shooting at something that close to you, you probably don't have to do that. Just reload the mag. If it's jammed, you'll figure that out when you go to rack the bolt. 7/10 times, it's just out of ammo, and you're better off just assuming that.  I'm rambling a bit, but the point is that there could be a lot of things that go on with anything thing that appears simple. This gif did lack instructions, so if someone didn't have any prior knowledge, they wouldn't be learning anything here."
LearnUselessTalents,384vx2,ssschlippp,3,Tue Jun 2 01:44:54 2015 UTC,"7/10 times? If you maintain your rifle and use at least halfway decent ammo you should get jams way, way less often than three out of ten mags, at least with a good modern gun. I've put hundreds of magazines worth of ammo through my AR and I don't think it's ever jammed, and I don't even maintain it nearly as well as I should.   Sorry, I know that wasn't the point of your post, but if I actually got a jam 3/10 times I definitely would check if that's what happened every time."
LearnUselessTalents,384vx2,RuTsui,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:40:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I said 9/10 at first, but went back and changed it to be more generous. In truth, I have a refabricated M16A2 that apparently was one of the first series of M16s in Vietnam, and it has never jammed on me.   A colonel at NTC tried to trade his M4 for one of our M16s so he could keep it as a heirloom. The Reserve struggle is real."
LearnUselessTalents,384vx2,HannasAnarion,2,Tue Jun 2 05:33:10 2015 UTC,"I personally thought it was odd that he checked the chamber   Probably because his life wasn't actually in danger, and he was on a range, with other people around, and he wants to be damn sure the gun is empty before he points it at whoever is behind him."
LearnUselessTalents,384vx2,RuTsui,1 point,Tue Jun 2 04:42:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I thought was odd. He wanted to be sure out was actually empty, but didn't bother with the safety.  However, I've now been enlightened as to the way the bolt on his rifle works and everything is clear to me."

LearnUselessTalents,384vx2,fasd14,7,Wed Jun 3 03:30:34 2015 UTC,You can't pull the bolt back with the safety engaged on AK variants. I have one and just double checked.
LearnUselessTalents,384vx2,RuTsui,0,Tue Jun 2 01:51:44 2015 UTC,"You don't need to pull out back. The final round pushed the bolt back then it locks on its own. You load the mag open bolt then hit the release to drop the bolt and load the next round. All of this can be done with the safety on. Once he gets the rifle back up, that's when here should turn the safety off. In a realistic situation, I'd turn the safety on and off as I was bringing it down and back up so it's ready to shoot as soon as it's shouldered, but I would still definitely click it on so I don't accidentally shoot myself out e someone around me which, with a maneuver like this, may be more likely than the bad guys shooting me.   For a demonstration or practice, I would have the safety on any time I'm not ready to pull the trigger, because why risk it?"
LearnUselessTalents,384vx2,fasd14,8,Tue Jun 2 02:04:53 2015 UTC,"Not only do AK's not hold the bolt open on the last round, but AK's also don't have a bolt hold open mechanism, aside from a notch in the safety on some of the newer ones, which requires two hands to use. I agree that firing, putting the safety on, swapping mags, and then taken the safety off and racking the bolt would be safer, but it's more steps to mess up when your fighting for your life. Safeties are safer, yes, no argument. The safety on an AK style rifle does not work for this type of demonstration."
LearnUselessTalents,384vx2,RuTsui,3,Tue Jun 2 02:15:25 2015 UTC,"His bolt locks open in this video. You can see it when he turns the rifle to check it. In fact, why would he check the chamber at all if the bolt want going to lock open? Now I'll admit I'm not the AK expert, but I'm like 99% sure that bolt is open when he turns the rifle."
LearnUselessTalents,384vx2,Ruhlmdc,5,Tue Jun 2 02:25:27 2015 UTC,"That's a Yugo bolt hold open mag.  It works by catching the bolt on the mag's follower rather than engaging a bolt hold open.  Once you drop the mag, the bolt flies forward."
LearnUselessTalents,384vx2,JakesGunReviews,3,Tue Jun 2 05:11:40 2015 UTC,"The bolt closes once again when the magazine is removed.  AKs do not have bolt hold-open mechanisms.  His magazine simply has a follower that blocks the bolt from moving forward when empty.  As soon as it is removed, the bolt goes back forward."
LearnUselessTalents,384vx2,RuTsui,2,Tue Jun 2 03:55:29 2015 UTC,"Well, the fool I am then. Thank you for the clarification."
LearnUselessTalents,384vx2,fasd14,2,Tue Jun 2 05:27:59 2015 UTC,"I watched it again, and your definitely right. That may be a feature on newer variants or a modification, but it definitely isn't normal for AK-47's or AK-74's. My bad."
LearnUselessTalents,384vx2,JakesGunReviews,3,Tue Jun 2 02:27:09 2015 UTC,"BHO follower in the magazine.  Bolt closes when mag is removed.  Effectively does nothing functionally, just lets you see when you're empty."

LearnUselessTalents,37zkh6,FramesTowers,27,Mon Jun 1 03:11:52 2015 UTC,"Swim instructor here. What this guy's saying is pretty much spot on. Your body follows basic physics, and your head leads the party. If your head is up- your legs drop so you drop your head to reduce drag. Just remember that every stroke you take you're trying to maximize the surface area of your pull with your hands and legs while minimizing the drag of your body."
LearnUselessTalents,37zkh6,JankMehard,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:06:31 2015 UTC,"My main issue left with learning to swim is lifting my face out of the water to breathe. If I'm focusing so much on keeping my head down, how do I figure out how to breathe while swimming?"
LearnUselessTalents,37zkh6,burnblue,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:37:47 2015 UTC,"Rhythmic breathing is what you're looking for.

LearnUselessTalents,37w9iw,quesman1,2,Sun May 31 19:32:37 2015 UTC,That was exactly my second option. Say it quickly = don't elongate it like he does.

LearnUselessTalents,37w9iw,jigglingpudding,11,Wed Jun 10 08:39:43 2015 UTC,I can actually do this and a trick can be applied to all fast spoken lyrics and you will see how much easier it is: memorize the lyrics.  I didn't memorize this one on purpose but by practicing it I ended up knowing it obviously. I haven't said these lyrics in like 4 years and I tried just now and it was still easy to rap along.
LearnUselessTalents,37w9iw,PumpNectar,3,Sun May 31 05:39:42 2015 UTC,"Tip #2: learn to breathe correctly. Just look up breathing exercises for singing, it'll apply to rapping, as well. Also, figure out when/where to breathe, then do it correctly. Your word count will go up a lot.  Cheat #1: learn where you can get away with pronouncing the words wrong. A word I've been using this with recently during a fast verse is replacing ""take notes"" with ""take no'es"", because pronouncing the T simply takes too long during that particular part. A small pause is quicker for me to put in, and it sounds just enough like ""notes"" that I don't think anyone apart from you guys will ever know."

The large headdress is only attached, you guessed it, at the head, so you don't see the movement of their midsection.  Some interesting jumping off points: shuffling or hardstyle (and possibly jumpstyle) could get your foot technique down, while watching some gliding videos could help you work on isolating your body parts.

Knees and calves generate the bouncing and need to be in very good condition. This guy's body fat is very low, so if you have a body mass index (BMI) of more than 25-26, you'll risk damaging your knees.   That's a lot of strain on very fine muscles in a short amount of time. A good measure of this, if you can jump and grab rim of a basketball goal, you have the explosive leg strength to pull this off. If your height is less than average, you have an excellent BMI, and still you have excellent leg strength, you can do the move in the original post and possibly do the cossack kick dance."

LearnUselessTalents,37pzzx,diegojones4,7,Fri May 29 15:09:01 2015 UTC,Even in the us ground resistance(25 ohm typical) on solidly grounded systems(like a house) usually won't clear faults unless there is a gfci. Grounding like this usually is for protection of equipment.  The math: 120v ÷ 25 ohm = 4.8 amps which is well below standard breaker values of 10 15 or 20 amps.

LearnUselessTalents,37hxtp,mad-dog2020,5,Sat May 30 06:22:36 2015 UTC,"Signedness:       In computing, signedness is a property of data types representing numbers in computer programs. A numeric variable is signed if it can represent both positive and negative numbers, and unsigned if it can only represent non-negative numbers (zero or positive numbers).  As signed numbers can represent negative numbers, they lose a range of positive numbers that can only be represented with unsigned numbers of the same size (in bits) because roughly half the possible values are non-positive values (so if an 8-bit is signed, positive unsigned values 128 to 255 are gone while -128 to 127 are present). Unsigned variables can dedicate all the possible values to the positive number range.  For example, a two's complement signed 16-bit integer can hold the values −32768 to 32767 inclusively, while an unsigned 16 bit integer can hold the values 0 to 65535. For this sign representation method, the leftmost bit (most significant bit) denotes whether the value is positive or negative (0 for positive, 1 for negative).

I take it by your answering a question with a question you're one of those people. Women aren't just going to fall into your lap when there are shitloads of guys already pursuing them. Get some skin in the game or don't complain."

LearnUselessTalents,37hxtp,WhiskeySeven,-1,Thu May 28 00:42:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think it takes most people 10 attempts to find someone who is interested in them. When I make a serious attempt at flirting i'll usually attract someone within a maximum of 4 attempts. Often someone will crack on to me before I even have to make the effort of introducing myself to girls. Sure, I'm attractive - but not super-good-looking.  Like you said - people don't pursue others because they're afraid of rejection - but also, people are just underestimating their attractiveness to the point where they're oblivious to signs of interest from others. And they don't go to pubs enough/they don't go with the intention of flirting/they're going to the wrong pubs."

Sure it can take some people less attempts, but anyone can get a bad string of luck. Even if you're above average there's still a chance you pick the 4 people who happen to just not be into your own particular thing.  The point with 10 is that if you've not even tried 10 times (which is a tiny portion of the amount of times you could be trying), then you're not really basing ""no one wants me"" on anything real, its just based on self-pity and fear of trying.  Shit, even the very ugly can still get lucky if they happen to find the right person with low enough standards."

And seemingly nothing works, because if you go out of your way to show rejection towards women, I mean in a first impressions setting, they just actually like it, they're thinking ""I got his attention and it doesn't matter that he looks like he is being negative since I didn't actually throw myself at him yet, which is something I could always do but I won't do it anyway, and the point is, now that an attractive guy noticed me, my bf should have no reason to find me unattractive"".   Playing indifferent also doesn't work as much as you would want since you just look like a douchebag.  However I think I found the ultimate secret to make women feel absolutely rejected when they are staring at you at the street / bar / etc. Just start picking or blowing your nose, or something really dumb looking like fixing your underwear like an overweight middle aged dad, man I don't know it works cause they'll think ""wow wtf, did he just find me that uninteresting he'd start picking his nose like a filthy ass motherfucker in front of a fine young lady like me?"".

Sometimes it feels good, but then I get bored of acting like a stupid ass male model, and if I am in a relationship and my girlfriend sees too much of this crap I am scared it will annoy her or make her feel weird about it after some point.  So I was always looking for ways in which I would ""cut"" all that and nothing seemed to work.

It reaches 5° difference at -13 and 33°C.   It's still a very good approximation for its simplicity. If you want to refine it further, add 3° starting at 0°C and colder (and subtract 3° at 20°C and higher) and you won't be off by more than 2°F until you are in extreme temperatures (-18°C and 38°C).  1 Everything is rounded to the nearest integer."

I learned a neat trick a while ago that works both ways:  Take your starting temperature and add 40. Now multiply by 5/9 or 9/5 depending on which way you're converting (just remember that the Fahrenheit values are usually larger than Celsius to figure out which one). Then subtract 40 from the value you get.  32F + 40 = 72 72 * 5/9 = 40 40 - 40 = 0C  100C + 40 = 140 140 * 9/5 = 252 252 - 40 = 212F  As for the mental math hurdle of multiplying by 9/5 or 5/9, you could always approximate by just taking double or half (and then subtracting/adding 10% if you want to be accurate, but the double/half approximation should get you close enough for ""wait, HOW cold is it outside?"" purposes)"

I enjoy programming for the same reason I enjoyed my degree, and also for the same reason I used to enjoy building machines in minecraft. In my opinion, there's something tremendously rewarding about applying your mind logically to a problem and gradually coming to some conclusion or solution that then allows you to do something you previously couldn't do. In minecraft that's when you build your first wheat farm or something, and in programming it's when you can now bounce the ball off the obstacle you just added to the game.  Aside from the enjoyment of it, I think that learning to programme has similar benefits to learning maths in that even if you never use the specific function you're learning about, it makes your brain better at thinking in a logical and analytical way and so indirectly helps with all manner of problem solving tasks.   Also I don't think you should be getting downvoted just because you have an unpopular opinion. I appreciate your ""enlighten me!"" approach to this question."

There are over 30,000 Chinese characters if I am not mistaken. They use a system of ""radicals"" (basic standalone characters, like fire 火, water 水, or standing man 人 [looks like the left side of 你], appended to other characters to create new characters) and the number of brush strokes in the character to look up words in a dictionary. Stroke order is very important, too.  Note: Korean for ""Korean language"" is Hangul, not to be confused with HanZi, which is Chinese characters.

Popping is all centered around the ""pop,"" which is a contraction and release of various muscles to create a ""pop"" effect. Examples of poppers are Poppin' John, Slim Boogie, Monsta Pop, Hoan, and Kite, who all practice different styles of popping.  Locking is a very funky style that is a lot looser and has more flow. Examples of lockers are Firelock and P-lock. I don't do as much locking, ad am not as good or well-versed at it, but those two are names I specifically remember.  As for what this guy IS doing? Animation, robotting, and waving. You can see the waves going up his arms and into his chest. Notice the robotic, stuttered way he goes about his movements.

People get curious if they become aware suddenly of a gap in their knowledge that they then want to fill. In saying 'this one weird trick to lose 10lbs in two days', the writer has initiated a curiosity gap in the reader.  For this to work, the reader has to have had some knowledge already on the subject, there is no point saying 'oh my god, did you heart how david michael got arrested?' if they have no idea who david michael is, as they wont be interested.   So, to summarise. Pick a topic the audience has some knowledge about, tell them they dont know something about it, they'll be inclined to fill the gap in their knowledge and will click on the link."

Without the release, babies are often accused of being colicy, when in fact, its just built up gas.  Step 1) With the baby in front of you, head up top, legs below (not side to side), grab the underside of the thighs with your hands.  Thumbs on the inside of the legs, 4 fingers on the outside.    Step 2) Gently, but with enough force, push the legs into the abdomen of the infant using short jerky motions.  Count - one, two, three! Pushing on each count  Alternate Step 2)  You can also walk the legs into the abdomen, one at a time.  Push the left one in, then the right.    Step 3) Gently rub the baby tummy downward, from the ribs down to the lower abdomen, and from side to side, clockwise ."

LearnUselessTalents,36r4v4,RetiredStripperClown,4,Thu May 21 13:46:31 2015 UTC,So it's basically about learning to sing one step up from the person singing the basic melody on every note? Say they're singing a C i sing an E? Is that not like really hard to do through an entire song? Some of these kids on youtube doing covers make it seem so easy.
LearnUselessTalents,36r4v4,RetiredStripperClown,3,Thu May 21 14:01:31 2015 UTC,"It is hard to do it through the entire song. A lot of popular songs have key changes, and sometimes you want that dissonance of using a minor chord, sometimes you don't. Find an easy song and work your way up. ""Sweet Dreams"" was the first song I ever learned the harmony to.   I've also been singing in a cover band for 6 years -- a lot of it has to do with knowing the style of the person you're singing with. A couple of the guys I mesh really well with, some of them try to sing my parts so I have to come in under them."
LearnUselessTalents,36r4v4,dan1361,1 point,Thu May 21 14:05:27 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say a ""really"" good ear. Just decent enough to audiate the fifth after hearing the note. From there it is the fourth down. Super simple."
LearnUselessTalents,36r4v4,thatoneguy54,4,Fri May 22 00:41:21 2015 UTC,"You really need to work on relative pitch to get it right, and that's a really complex skill to learn. I mean, it shouldn't be too hard if you know anything about music and you don't care about being perfect, but it takes practice for sure. See teoria.com for some good tutorials and help with ear training.  Anyway, here's my tips:   With most music, you probably wanna do a major 3rd above or below the singer, which depends on the song, I guess. Sometimes you might wanna do a minor 3rd, but a major 3rd will almost always sound good. What's a major 3rd? It's 5 half steps or 2 whole steps above a given note. If you know note names, C-E is a major 3rd.  How do you personally practice major 3rds? You could start by isolating one in a song and having that be your reference. Think of ""Three Blind Mice"". It goes     E--------D---C  Three blind mice   So from ""Three"" to ""mice"" is a major 3rd. Practice that phrase a lot, all of it. Then try to go directly from ""Three"" to ""mice"". Use a piano to help you.    So now you know how to make a major 3rd. Now in the next song you hear, you have to apply the same technique to the songs you hear. Take the pitch you hear and make it either ""Three"" or ""mice"", then jump up or down to harmonize with it.   Voila! Harmonize away.  You could also harmonize to a perfect 5th or a major/minor 6th, but those are bigger jumps, and if you're not used to singing it would be a bigger challenge."

LearnUselessTalents,36r4v4,Yohfay,2,Thu May 21 20:54:31 2015 UTC,"Others here have gone really in depth. I can easily agree with them: it's an ear thing, not a voice thing.   Tl;Dr : aim for a 3rd above the melody and follow its contours along with the lead singer. Your ears should keep it as the proper diatonic third (maj/min).  Follow your ears, and they will keep you away from weirder sounds.   Ideally yeah, you should be using your ears to identify the chord progression (most pop tunes are 4 chords or less..), and be finding nice voicings based on theory, but following the contour of the melody is a pretty easy shortcut you can do without nearly as much ear training. Since chords are notes stacked in thirds, by aiming for the next 3rd on top of the melody you'll sound totally rooted in key. The only (debatable) odd sound you'll find often is a major 7th if the melody is on the 5th of a major chord, but if you're finding that to be an odd sound, your ears at just going to find the 8th a semitone away anyways.   Definitely not something I was taught (jazz school instrumental) but it's worked for me before and after I knew what was what.   It helps to practice when you're rooted in key. It's a lot easier to do while your driving and cranking tunes vs listening to solo acapela act."
LearnUselessTalents,36r1wi,KilljoyAdam,5,Thu May 21 13:13:20 2015 UTC,"If anyone sees you it'll look far more illiterate than you actually are, but I'm fond of mouthing the words during particularly complicated or hard to parse portions of a book I'm reading. Something about the extra processing skills you're using makes you stick to the text more than normal. Also tapping your finger against your thumb for every word you read helps build up a rhythm, although I tend to read too fast and I can't keep up after I get my speed going. If I'm able, I'll change my seat to different lighting every 30 minutes or so.   I was on a huge David Foster Wallace/Thomas Pynchon streak a few years ago, and they're both simultaneously extremely exhausting and interesting, so I used a lot of those techniques."
LearnUselessTalents,36r1wi,mrminty,3,Thu May 21 14:51:14 2015 UTC,"I get that when I am rushing.   I will often go back a few pages or read a section out loud.   If I am noticing it's happening a lot,  then I will sometimes read a summary like spark notes so I can get more context."
LearnUselessTalents,36r1wi,calsosta,7,Thu May 21 13:52:09 2015 UTC,"Write it down. If it is never resolved, then include the thought(s) in your book review on Goodreads. Writing it down releases it from your need to keep it in short-term memory."
LearnUselessTalents,36r1wi,jwcobb13,2,Thu May 21 13:16:35 2015 UTC,"When I was in high school I was taking a physics test when I got infected by a nasty earworm. I think it was one of the songs from The Rocky Horror Picture Show, and I couldn't shake it. It was distracting me so much that all I could think to do was turn my exam over and write down all the lyrics. It worked; I stopped thinking about it and continued with my test."
LearnUselessTalents,36r1wi,PopeInnocentXIV,2,Fri May 22 02:46:20 2015 UTC,And the teacher got a nice little treat in the middle of his/her boring grading! So I think that's a win-win all around!
LearnUselessTalents,36r1wi,jwcobb13,2,Fri May 22 03:24:26 2015 UTC,Thanks mate

LearnUselessTalents,36r1wi,Schmidty9_9,2,Thu May 21 22:47:05 2015 UTC,"I use it as a signal that my body is telling me to go do something else for a little bit. Getting up and getting a drink, or doing some easy exercises like push-ups or sit-ups helps me a lot. It's not exactly what you asked for but it's the only way other than reading the passage many times that works for me."

LearnUselessTalents,36r1wi,AxisOfAwesome,1 point,Thu May 21 21:01:37 2015 UTC,"I find that this happens to me because I've read a word I don't know, or don't understand in context. I find that word and look it up, or just think through how it applies, and I can continue reading.  It's almost like that uncomprehended word makes my mind 'derail', and once I figure out what that word means, I am able to read the page again and understand it."
LearnUselessTalents,36r1wi,bbennett108,1 point,Fri May 22 06:49:58 2015 UTC,"I do two different things to help maintain my focus.  First: form a ritual before you read (or do homework, write, whatever). I like to make a cup of tea and sit at a certain chair at a certain desk (which is only used when I'm reading or writing) and put on some soft, relaxing music with no vocals (think jazz, classical, chillout lounge, etc). It sort of gets ingrained into your body and mind that when you perform that specific ritual, it's time to concentrate. Sounds simple, but it helps a lot.  Second: if I seem to have a lot on my mind, I do a ""brain dump"". I take about 10 minutes, turn on my cell phone's voice recorder, and start verbalizing all the things on my mind / notes to self / things to remember or do / etc. It gets them out of my mind and I know I can refer back to it later at any time. You can also write them down too."
LearnUselessTalents,36r1wi,Peace_Brother,-2,Mon Jun 15 04:55:48 2015 UTC,Just pay attention to what you read.
LearnUselessTalents,36r1wi,crimson_zelman,4,Thu May 21 18:38:26 2015 UTC,Is this what you mean?
LearnUselessTalents,36pyrz,heatseeker4474,6,Thu May 21 04:46:56 2015 UTC,Go to youtube and type in tutting or gloving tutorials. Both are essentially the same thing.

LearnUselessTalents,36pyrz,Tyrantt_47,3,Thu May 21 17:08:24 2015 UTC,"Gloving is the overarching term for finger dancing, tutting is one style of gloving. It takes a lot of practice to make your fingers dexterous enough to do those waves this guy is doing but incredibly satisfying when you achieve it."
LearnUselessTalents,36pyrz,sexdrugsfightlaugh,13,Thu May 21 17:03:04 2015 UTC,Go to a rave every weekend and find the guy doing it for people who are on a lot of drugs. Offer him weed and $20.

LearnUselessTalents,36lqf6,dvdgrdll,15,Wed May 20 09:04:41 2015 UTC,Becoming fluent in a foreign language is a useless talent?
LearnUselessTalents,36lqf6,sixthmillipede,3,Wed May 20 18:37:07 2015 UTC,"It can be. I mean, I as a US citizen who doesn't plan on ever going to Norway would have no use in learning Norwegian."
LearnUselessTalents,36lqf6,MadHatter31415,8,Wed May 20 19:37:43 2015 UTC,"Learning a second language is proven to boost cognitive ability, even if you never use it.   And knowing one fluently almost immediately opens up employment opportunities as a translator. Take it a bit further, you could, with a bit of certification, start teaching it...   So... There's always a use.   But I'd suggest Spanish if you live in the US and have no plans to go elsewhere."
