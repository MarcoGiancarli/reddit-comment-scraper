yvonnestrahovski,39a1jx,Spe3dy,2,Wed Jun 10 09:39:51 2015 UTC,"Photo from the article.   Rene’s not exactly fond of NASA’s rules. “In the book, she’s described as the ‘rebel,’” Strahovski says. That’s established in the first episode when the seven women are gathered for their first Life magazine photo shoot. NASA sent a memo asking each lady to wear a plain, pastel-hued shirtdress. Rene shows up in a loud floral-print Dior. “She wanted to have her own voice and express herself. She didn’t want to be this sheepish little Stepford Wife,” Strahovski says.   Yep, that's Yvonne for ya. :)  Picture for reference."

yvonnestrahovski,2x44bx,AaKkisa,4,Wed Feb 25 14:34:16 2015 UTC,I was lucky enough to be in the front row for this panel! Hopefully Nerd HQ returns this year and Yvonne comes back again.
yvonnestrahovski,2x44bx,Mantis05,7,Wed Feb 25 19:31:38 2015 UTC,Is she as beautiful in real life as she is online?
yvonnestrahovski,2x44bx,WeAllKnowWhyImHere,8,Wed Feb 25 19:52:02 2015 UTC,Was there ever any doubt?
yvonnestrahovski,2x44bx,Mantis05,7,Wed Feb 25 20:02:16 2015 UTC,Dam you are lucky! I would love to be at a nerd HQ and I would love to meet Yvonne.  After watching one of Zack's live webchats I did donate some money to Nerd HQ even though I live in the UK and doubt I will ever visit a Nerd HQ.
yvonnestrahovski,2x44bx,reelmonkey,0,Thu Feb 26 09:20:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah there seems to be very little heads-up opportunity to get tickets, let alone figure out vacation time and flights to get there."
yvonnestrahovski,2x44bx,SinoScot,0,Thu Feb 26 16:48:00 2015 UTC,I was hoping that Yvonne would do a meet and greet while she was in London but sadly she did not. I really want to meet her one day.
yvonnestrahovski,2wusnv,GMJeeSe,2,Mon Feb 23 08:55:57 2015 UTC,That's a really nice dress!   Thanks for posting.  Aside from Sarah Lancaster's and Yvonne's tweet I hadn't seen these anything about this. But then this also is quite a recent happening. :)

You have made me not sure as well now... but it sure does look like her.   I can't decide, so I am removing it for now :) I now think you are right though :D"
yvonnestrahovski,2wusnv,Spe3dy,1 point,Mon Feb 23 10:42:02 2015 UTC,"I'm wondering why she would be twice on the same red carpet, with a different dress on, the second time."

yvonnestrahovski,2wnirn,tharky,1 point,Sat Feb 21 14:16:04 2015 UTC,So beautiful... How do you guys get these??
yvonnestrahovski,2wjxjr,AaKkisa,5,Fri Feb 20 15:16:01 2015 UTC,Well if it is your favorite you deserve a higher quality version Sadly not amazing still - Your one there seems to of been re-sized funny when cropped.
yvonnestrahovski,2wjxjr,GMJeeSe,3,Fri Feb 20 15:46:22 2015 UTC,......you....stop being so good.
yvonnestrahovski,2wjxjr,GMJeeSe,3,Fri Feb 20 15:47:30 2015 UTC,"I said yours was cropped and re-sized funny, it's actually direct from an English magazine scan I think, so that is how they cropped it. Interestingly the one I posted I think from the Portuguese issue is edited different. You'd think the magazines would only bother with different translations.  edit: they reused it in Aus Maxim Hot 100, maybe one of the crops was from that Mag.  Anyway who cares :)"
yvonnestrahovski,2wjxjr,BigKritClub,2,Fri Feb 20 15:53:54 2015 UTC,The real reason Chuck was so good..

yvonnestrahovski,2w6zi2,kenshin159,0,Wed Feb 18 04:56:25 2015 UTC,She's closing the wrong eye
yvonnestrahovski,2w6zi2,Phirak,2,Tue Feb 17 22:56:36 2015 UTC,"not if her left eye is her dominant eye... You can fire a hand gun right or left handed with right or left eye no problem really. In fact if you can do it you are better off shooting with both eyes open, especially in defensive and offensive shooting environments as it will improve your situational awareness and increase the speed at which you process what you are seeing.  That aside... this is just a photo shoot, who cares :)"
yvonnestrahovski,2w6zi2,GMJeeSe,2,Tue Feb 17 23:06:24 2015 UTC,"I wasn't actually sure if I was right, but I was curious to know the answer, and on reddit the best way to do that is to just state your opinion as fact.  Thanks for the info!"
yvonnestrahovski,2w6zi2,Phirak,1 point,Tue Feb 17 23:41:55 2015 UTC,"You are not really wrong, most people who are right handed are right eye dominant and the same for left, making it the obvious way to shoot and with rifles and different types of sights it is pretty much impossible to use the opposite eye, just with open sight handguns it is not a massive problem.   The difference is likely minimal as well unless you have a significant difference in eye. It only gets thought about for target shooters really, when trying to ensure you can gain every tiny little advantage."
yvonnestrahovski,2w6zi2,GMJeeSe,0,Wed Feb 18 00:11:14 2015 UTC,"Case in point, I am a right handed shooter but I am left eye dominant. I usually just keep both eyes open though so it's not a problem now."

yvonnestrahovski,2vmk0m,Spe3dy,1 point,Thu Feb 12 09:48:28 2015 UTC,That is not the Colorized one you sent me is it? Cos no offence but it is looking awful now... and I swear it was decent before.   Edit- You have enlarged it? Gonna have to colorize much more accurately to get away with the enlarge. :)
yvonnestrahovski,2vmk0m,GMJeeSe,1 point,Thu Feb 12 09:58:33 2015 UTC,"As far as I know it's the same. :) But you're right, in comparison to the original one, it's a bit over the top. :)"
yvonnestrahovski,2vmk0m,Spe3dy,2,Thu Feb 12 10:00:42 2015 UTC,"haha yeah, maybe it is because we are comparing to the original now."
yvonnestrahovski,2vmk0m,GMJeeSe,1 point,Thu Feb 12 10:01:35 2015 UTC,Mine does lean a bit too much toward Andy Warhol's style. :p

yvonnestrahovski,2vmk0m,Spe3dy,3,Thu Feb 12 10:22:26 2015 UTC,"The one you have there is the highest resolution out there. Sadly it is difficult to enlarge too as even at it's current resolution the quality is poor.   Anyway, I just did a quick version Enlarged it here. It may just about do the job but it's not amazing.  It could probs be improved more with a little film grain but I was trying to keep the original look.  Black and White would be easy to enlarge loads, like the one /u/Spe3dy posted."

yvonnestrahovski,2sxbpc,Spe3dy,1 point,Mon Jan 19 11:03:08 2015 UTC,May I ask why you make them into .png's? Is there a advantage when you choose for .png over .jpg?
yvonnestrahovski,2sxbpc,KortoloB,2,Mon Jan 19 11:10:21 2015 UTC,"I always thought Jpg images have a loss of quality and png will compress less, (just opinion, I could be wrong) that said I think BMP's are almost certainly the best quality to store a wallpaper in (not actually sure why I don't save them as BMP's)"
yvonnestrahovski,2sxbpc,SinoScot,2,Mon Jan 19 11:15:53 2015 UTC,"found this :) I may start saving as BMP, cos filesize does not bother me, I assume imgur supports BMP's."
yvonnestrahovski,2sxbpc,Spe3dy,1 point,Mon Jan 19 11:19:55 2015 UTC,"There's no advantage to saving it as a bmp over png, both are lossless. Imgur does not support bmp's, but they do support png.  Every time you save an image as a jpeg a lossy compression is done, meaning that data is lost. Every time an image is saved as a jpeg, the quality will lower and artifacts will be introduced. This is great if you want a small filesize, but it sucks if you want the full quality to be preserved.  However, saving an image that previously was a jpeg as a png will infer no real benefit. It's already been ruined, so now you're just wasting filesizes. Personally, I don't care about filesizes so I tend to upload things as png's too, but I do admit that in these cases it's entirely useless really.  There is one benefit to uploading images to imgur as png's: Imgur wont additionally compress pngs (because it can't), whereas they do compress jpegs even more than you did in some cases. So if you're going to be using imgur, it's worth it for that reason alone.  tl;dr: Saving a jpg as a png does not magically increase it's quality, and png is superior to bmp in every way.  oh, and great wallpapers by the way."
yvonnestrahovski,2sxbpc,Spe3dy,3,Mon Jan 19 14:08:55 2015 UTC,Let's just all be honest and say that no image type or quality yet exists to fully capture the beauty of Yvonne Strahovski.

yvonnestrahovski,2stlnr,Spe3dy,2,Sun Jan 18 11:53:57 2015 UTC,p.s looks like you have been clone stamping across yours to remove the text? You get a lot of repetition in all the textured parts and the water streaks that way. Try to mix it up a little :)
yvonnestrahovski,2stlnr,Spe3dy,3,Sun Jan 18 12:01:22 2015 UTC,I think I did a better job with the better quality ones.  Have a look.  They cropped the 6th photo for some reason.

yvonnestrahovski,2stlnr,Spe3dy,1 point,Sun Jan 18 19:27:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not exactly sure what you want.   Do you want to see how I remove text out of an image?  Because you could easily watch some videos on YT about this topic.  For example. This is one, rather easy way to do it. FYI, I didn't even know about this method before writing this comment and looking up a Youtube video to give as an example. ;)"
yvonnestrahovski,2stlnr,SinoScot,3,Sun Jan 18 19:46:53 2015 UTC,"Content aware fill, or in fact you can just do a content aware delete, works well on bold text like that and the color difference there will have helped him too. Most images you are gonna still need to do a lot of fixing afterwards but that's the best way to get rid of the main bulk of text. Do it in small sections though, don't highlight all the text at once for a better result. I didn't watch the video, but if he didn't you may be best off adding a modify to expand your selection by say 1 pixel before doing the fill. On a lower res image a lot more work is required, and it simply wont work for removing semi-transparent text on them."
yvonnestrahovski,2sr065,CapnCarrot,6,Sat Jan 17 17:51:36 2015 UTC,"Even though these were posted yesterday, I can't fault you for doing so. She's too beautiful not to. :)  In the meantime, I edited the text out of the originals (without cropping them like they have been in this post.)  Enjoy!"

yvonnestrahovski,2sihi0,Meior,2,Thu Jan 15 20:38:15 2015 UTC,"The principals mostly had good handling training, but seeing CIA background spooks teacupping is consistently silly."
yvonnestrahovski,2sihi0,hurracan,2,Fri Jan 16 01:42:16 2015 UTC,"Well, I've seen people from similar backgrounds do worse in real life. If you deliver, I don't see a problem. But I still agree, it's silly."
yvonnestrahovski,2sihi0,Meior,10,Fri Jan 16 06:25:18 2015 UTC,Words fail. So hot
yvonnestrahovski,2sihi0,Obvious0ne,4,Thu Jan 15 15:41:05 2015 UTC,She's in my top 3 for sure.

yvonnestrahovski,2simzh,AaKkisa,5,Thu Jan 15 14:39:00 2015 UTC,I'm looking at a slight something else

yvonnestrahovski,2semjs,AaKkisa,4,Wed Jan 14 15:13:45 2015 UTC,Personally I prefer when she's dressed as an Angel complete with the pop-out wings
yvonnestrahovski,2semjs,NeoStorm247,4,Wed Jan 14 23:51:18 2015 UTC,"All I could find but, for you."

yvonnestrahovski,2semjs,Amyndris,3,Thu Jan 15 14:22:02 2015 UTC,"Seriously, hottest moment in the series."
yvonnestrahovski,2semjs,_gil,0,Thu Jan 15 05:43:58 2015 UTC,Particularly enjoyed that plot.
yvonnestrahovski,2semjs,Spe3dy,-13,Wed Jan 14 19:17:49 2015 UTC,"In this case she IS dressed like that for the plot. I know what you tried to do (/r/watchitfortheplot). But I think this is a wrong example and dare I say, a bit disrespectful of you. (Might be just me though!) ;)"
yvonnestrahovski,2semjs,laughingplague,12,Wed Jan 14 16:18:02 2015 UTC,I can't get over how neck-beardy this comment is.

yvonnestrahovski,2sea83,GMJeeSe,5,Wed Jan 14 13:02:40 2015 UTC,"I don't understand photography like this... Sure, she's incredibly beautiful, but they were like, ""hey, put on these gold high heels and bikini with this weird leather vest and sit on the dirt in this horse arena.  Make sure to look sexy""  For god's sake, put some jeans and boots and a plaid shirt on her - it would still look great and it would be scene-appropriate."
yvonnestrahovski,2sea83,Obvious0ne,4,Wed Jan 14 15:19:40 2015 UTC,"That's photography for you. It doesn't really have to make sense.  But I agree with you.  But then of course, it's a shoot for Maxim."
yvonnestrahovski,2sea83,Spe3dy,1 point,Wed Jan 14 16:15:00 2015 UTC,"Someone may already have higher quality than this one? Post it!  As a complete image I could only find lower quality, so I took the two highest quality scans I could get, removed all logos and text and stitched them together."
yvonnestrahovski,2sea83,Spe3dy,2,Wed Jan 14 13:05:16 2015 UTC,"By the way, this wasn't shot on a beach. ;) If you look in the background, you can see this is shot on a ehem... ranch."
yvonnestrahovski,2sea83,Spe3dy,3,Wed Jan 14 13:15:55 2015 UTC,"Haha I knew that, I don't know how I forgot. I just saw sand when I posted this and wrote beach :)"
yvonnestrahovski,2sea83,dexter311,5,Wed Jan 14 13:19:17 2015 UTC,"You're not the only one, the background is mostly forgotten when Ms. Strahovski is in the foreground, right?"
yvonnestrahovski,2sea83,SinoScot,2,Wed Jan 14 13:20:26 2015 UTC,"indeed, and in reference to your video I don't care how amazing she is I wont dance... I guess Yvonne will have to live with it, I will however dance at our wedding, and yes I do believe that's happening. Even if it's only in my head!"
yvonnestrahovski,2sea83,Spe3dy,2,Wed Jan 14 13:25:18 2015 UTC,What background?
yvonnestrahovski,2sakf9,GMJeeSe,2,Tue Jan 13 16:24:37 2015 UTC,"Got to say, I like your style. Nothing over the top, just simple."

yvonnestrahovski,2rutqt,Spe3dy,2,Fri Jan 9 14:46:28 2015 UTC,"This. Isn't it awesome to every so often see a new picture instead of knowing you have them all. I don't have everything that's available out there, it's the main reason I go to this subreddit."
