I like to draw tiny things and put a lot of detail in them but when I draw them bigger have a hard time keeping them looking good. Also are you good at drawing hands and or faces?

doodles,38j28f,techn0guy,4,Thu Jun 4 15:31:08 2015 UTC,"I think that'd be really cool.  The problem I foresee, however, is there is almost no way for you to verify that what someone uploads is a picture of what the theme is.So, you'd get people uploading pictures that are basically MSPaint scribbles so that they could see everyone else's doodles.  That's the downside to any kind of user-generated-content site: most users are not content creators.  Though, you could probably mitigate that problem fairly easily. A democratic system similar to reddit's for instance."

doodles,38ebcj,coolbluehalo,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:39:58 2015 UTC,Thanks! Yes it is...well very watered down acrylic actually (it's cheaper) and some salt sprinkled on.
doodles,38ebcj,Cheshire_Moon,2,Wed Jun 3 18:43:27 2015 UTC,What affect does the salt have?
doodles,38ebcj,Cheshire_Moon,2,Wed Jun 3 20:26:46 2015 UTC,"It scares the water away, making a little lighter-colored blobby shapes.   These are technical terms."
doodles,38ebcj,Cheshire_Moon,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:43:08 2015 UTC,That is interesting! I saw that you used acrylics and water. Does the acrylic seem more affected by the salt than water color or is it pretty equal?
doodles,38ebcj,BruceWaynesPants,2,Wed Jun 3 20:52:08 2015 UTC,"Acrylic can work pretty much the same as watercolor. The biggest difference is that once it dries, it'd pretty much stuck there. With watercolor you can rewet it blot it and stuff."

doodles,35pfmy,book_worm200414,2,Tue May 12 12:59:50 2015 UTC,This is really cool! I also like the two sketches behind the main piece. Is there any website you'd recommend where I can begin to learn to draw like this?
doodles,35pfmy,Agent_21,3,Wed May 13 19:39:27 2015 UTC,":/ I wish I had a website to give you, but this is mostly just from practice and observation (studying other illustrators I've admired over time). Wesley Burt, James Jean, and Kim Jung Gi in particular have excellent work especially when it comes to their sketches. I would look at their work if you're curious :)"

His memories still haunt him, did this stange man hurt space ghost in the past? Or did space ghost cause him some harm, for which he feels great remorse? Perhaps the man is a long lost acquaintance, some half-remembered friend. Could space ghost be scared of the day that he too will fade into obscurity? It's the questions provoked by a piece such as this that makes it so interesting."

doodles,35ljuu,Improbabilities,1 point,Tue May 12 18:39:58 2015 UTC,"This is a great study on the thought process of the ever enigmatic house cat. We may never truly understand our feline companions, but it is easier to begin comprehending their motivations after contemplating this piece.     What motivates a cat to roam where it pleases, and to make it's bed wherever it stops? It is the same sentiment that motivates people to drive RV's accross vast tracts of land. Their escepades are not guided by the desire for a grand, romantic, adventure. No they are driven by their love of discovery, and by new experiences. Their joy is the joy of freedom.      /u/bushbumper is trying to show us how to be as relaxed and happy as this simple creature. If you keep your head in the clouds, and your chin up, you too will find nothing but clear skies. Life would be  more fufilling, if we would regard the passage of time as a cat would. If we pushed time as far from our minds as possible, and focussed only on the present, we could enjoy the clear skies right in front of us; full of promises of adventure.      Instead, many of us frett over the clouds in the distance, and worry ever more as we watch them approach. It seems we still have much to learn from the humble feline."
