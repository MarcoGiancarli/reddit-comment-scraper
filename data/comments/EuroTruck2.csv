EuroTruck2,3e5pv6,Likeapuma24,3,Wed Jul 22 03:59:02 2015 UTC,I still play with controller from time to time when despite having a fairly decent wheel - when you are tired and just want to cruise it's a lot less effort. Just make sure to change the controller type joystick/gamepad in the settings menu (it defaults to wheel) otherwise your steering will be a bit messed up.
EuroTruck2,3e5pv6,emmywinks,3,Wed Jul 22 04:41:54 2015 UTC,"I use a DS4 controller, and it's far better than a keyboard by far. If you want to get a wheel, then go for it. Both are better than KB&M.   It really depends what you're more interested in. Both games will be updated for years come and do have a modding community. If you enjoy European roads, scenery and cab-over trucks, then buy the game. If you enjoy wide American roads, scenery and conventional (nosed) trucks, then wait for American Truck and buy that.  If you're interested in trucking in general, then I'd buy both games. Even if you dislike cab-overs, for example, there are numerous Russian and American truck mods. As well as map mods."

EuroTruck2,3e43dj,borrokalari,10,Tue Jul 21 21:12:18 2015 UTC,"In real life, the high beams (bright lights) are very blinding to oncoming vehicles so it is the accepted norm and in some countries the law to turn off your high beams when encountering an oncoming car or driving through a lit highway or city.  The game is just replicating that real life fact. If you want to keep the realism going, turn off the high beams when you see an oncoming car, the said car won't be flashing you then. If it flashes you anyway, you turned them off too late. Once the car has passed, you can turn them back on. :)  Or just ignore them... you don't get punished for that offence in-game. :)"

With the G27 and ETS2, it's very easy to set up how you want each button and switch to do what. For example I have my indicator lights mapped to the paddle shifters. The GT would suit you well but I personally prefer the G27 that has the six speed shifter."

From that came a question that the Farm Sim 15 guys might answer: I'm wondering if I could remap the shifter in FS15 so that I could control some hydraulics...   Finally, the H pattern shifter makes me want to go with a G27. Knowing I'll be playing ATS when it comes out; I know I'd love to try that on American trucks.  All right well thanks for your help guys :)"

It is a great wheel especially for $100 in your case."
EuroTruck2,3di3rv,emmywinks,-3,Thu Jul 16 16:04:08 2015 UTC,"G27 is overkill for ETS. The Driving Force GT gives you a few buttons on the wheel, a d-pad, and a sequential shifter. I'm not sure if ETS can use the rotary switch or not though.   A G27 gives you 6 buttons, but you lose the d-pad. You trade the sequential for paddles and an h-pattern with clutch. You probably won't use the clutch or h-pattern for ETS. You do get more buttons overall with the G27, but just for non-racing games it's probably not worth 3x the cost since you can just reach over to your keyboard for things that don't fit on your wheel."

EuroTruck2,3co5bc,RealSheriff,12,Thu Jul 9 12:40:59 2015 UTC,"So I was stuck at 99.94% for weeks and tried googling for easy methods to find the last undiscovered roads. I found a few mods that would change the map line colors but most of them would crash my game. After so much searching I found this gem of a mod that changes the discovered road to a transparent yellow, undiscovered roads to a bright green and disables all icons. I was surprised how much easier it made finding that last 0.06%  Here is the mod that I used."

I had 99.99% map explored and I delivered my delivery so I thought I should go along this road (since it isn't blocked) and see where it leads me, turns out that this road is fully functional but for some reason isn't displayed on the minimap. Also when I started driving, I got the achievement for 100% exploration completion even though when I go onto world map it still says 99.99%."

I had to drive over that section another two or three times (sometimes very slowly) for it to register as discovered."

EuroTruck2,3cp6o2,LinguistHere,4,Thu Jul 9 17:34:35 2015 UTC,I like Scanias but I love Volvo even more. It surprises me that people prefer Scanias over Volvo. Volvo are (in my opinion) a far better company and their trucks have better technologies on them.
EuroTruck2,3cp6o2,mintlou,2,Thu Jul 9 21:59:32 2015 UTC,I love using the Volvos too. Favorite truck ever.
EuroTruck2,3cp6o2,Teethdude,2,Fri Jul 10 16:46:50 2015 UTC,"Pumped 110,000km onto a 2012 FH16. It's the best compromise between everything you want to have displayed on the dashboard, gps placement and driver visibility. Also....700+ bhp.   I say Volvo makes the best trucks in terms of usability in the game. The Scania vehicles are alright, but they don't do it for me on the interior. I like having the clock, odometer, gps and cruise control set point visible at a glance, as well as having fuel consumption readouts right there. The Volvo instrument cluster is probably the best in the game to be honest. It's actually very similar to what comes in the new Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX. (Ford owns part of Volvo)  But I just started driving the Benz Astros this week (the one from the 1.18 update, the new one) and I must say, I like it. The engine noise is worse, it isn't as powerful as my Volvo and doesn't look as great (personal opinion)  However, the actros (new one) has a very nice instrument cluster, comparable to the Vo', it's got great visibility, and nice large mirrors. The gauges are visible without having the headlights on, or HDR enabled. Nice big dials. It revs with less fuss than the FH, so merging is easier, and it has huge fuel tanks, even with a 6X4 layout. You can put some nice side skirts onto it. And from the side, I'd say it's the nicest looking vehicle in the game. Only put about 3000km onto it (bought it in Monday) but I'm liking it so far.  I have put over 10,000km onto each one of the vehicles in the game (for that achievement) and I must say, my go to is the Vo', it's just the nicest one to drive. Or this new actros, it's up there as well"
EuroTruck2,3cp6o2,truefakts,4,Fri Jul 10 18:54:33 2015 UTC,"Ever since I started playing trucking games I got interested in European trucks and always thought the Scania looks pretty nice with its front grill and vents. It has a mean face. I did like the MAN too but I kind of prefered the Scania. That went on like that for a good couple of years until I discovered this sub and other Truck Sim subs which then lead me to discover Squirrel and I thought: sweet, I'm not the only one who prefers Scania...  Now you come up with this thread and it seems like I'm just going along with the majority...  I don't dislike other brands though, I just prefer the look of that mean grill and the \8/"

EuroTruck2,3cp6o2,shawa666,6,Fri Jul 10 16:18:10 2015 UTC,I think the prolific Euro Truck 2 streamer Paul 'Squirrel' may have something to do with it. He has always been a Scania fan.
EuroTruck2,3cp6o2,SoundHound,6,Thu Jul 9 17:49:14 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm assuming.  Scanias are very nice, but other manufacturers have their strong points as well.  Even - dare I say it - Renault."

EuroTruck2,3cp6o2,metal_fever,3,Thu Jul 9 20:14:52 2015 UTC,I personally think they look beautiful but IRL they used to be very popular because they had better fuel economy than other brands and with the distances trucks drive it was a lot more profitable to get a Scania. Now all trucks are about equally fuel efficient though.
EuroTruck2,3cp6o2,xolov,3,Thu Jul 9 18:21:16 2015 UTC,"In ETS 2 MP I barely ever see people driving DAF's, Renaults and Ivecos. I think it is a shame that nearly the only lorrys that people drive are Scanias and Volvos"
EuroTruck2,3cp6o2,Darkfizch,3,Thu Jul 9 20:49:18 2015 UTC,"Iveco driver here! I love the small steering wheel. It makes it a lot more fun to handle. To me, Scania has always kind of felt like some sort of drivable tower, especially on tight curves."

EuroTruck2,3cp6o2,Elitefog,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:57:18 2015 UTC,"Scanias are popular IRL for they're reliability and simplicity compared to other manufacturers. Scanias also offer a lot of chassis variation; 2, 3, 4, or 5 axles, front and rear steering etc...  A downside being, they tend to be more expensive in comparison to the DAF's or MAN's.

EuroTruck2,3cp6o2,nfshp253,0,Sat Jul 18 01:07:36 2015 UTC,"I love the Scania because it has the best dashboard design (you'll need some mod which changes the numbers to the original sizes), which is clear and logical. I love the engine note too, especially when releasing the throttle at ~1200rpm on the R490. And if you're looking for power, just switch to the R730.

EuroTruck2,3ck7nn,lcarp3,6,Wed Jul 8 17:44:16 2015 UTC,DEF when heated turns to ammonia and deposits on the DPF (desiel particulate filter). When engine NOx gasses pass thru the DPF it chemically  reacts with the ammonia and produces oxygen and carbon dioxide. The DPF also collects engine solids such as oil antifreeze and wear metals and when the DPF collects so much of those solids it requires  regeneration to burn those solids leaving behind soot. And when the soot level gets to high the DPF needs to be removed and cleaned by baking the soot from the filter. And that in a nutshell is how the aftertreatment system works on a diesel engine.

EuroTruck2,3cf8nu,MarkC81,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:23:35 2015 UTC,The business aspect of ETS2 is very tiny and almost automatic (no real room for different strategies and such).

EuroTruck2,3bzav6,firetech_SE,9,Fri Jul 3 11:23:37 2015 UTC,"I think it takes account for the different speed limits on all the freeways and streets you will pass. Not every small alleyway allows you to go 50 mph.  With that method of calculation, it's easier to not account for speeding."

EuroTruck2,3bzav6,borrokalari,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:14:27 2015 UTC,I didn't really bother to get into specifics but since there's both time compression and distance compression I guess it might play into the GPS ETA if time compression doesn't have the same compression ratio as with distance compression.  If 1hour = 6 actual mins then you have a ratio of 10  but if 1km = 50 actual meters then you have a ratio of 20  So if this was the case it would mean that the formula Time = Distance / Rate wouldn't hold true.  I'm no genius at math so in case I'm wrong blame it on everything else but me.

If damaged more than I like (usually 30-50%, depending on the cargo), I leave the cargo in a remote place and drive away until it cancels itself.   You save money by doing that (Cancelling the job yourself is a hefty fine, if you don't have that much. Around â¬12.000 or something.  I have seen several of these tilted trailers and trailers deep in the ground, end up with only 1-5% damage on them. A few with 100% as well though.  If you do the above, you only end up paying the amount it costs to get to the repair shop along with 1-2 minutes wasted. Nothing bad at all :)  I've read on their own forum, that it's mainly caused by people taking a job, then logging out or just leaving it without going out of range (read: This is pure speculations, as there are no real evidence of this form anyone on the forum). This will cause the trailer to be ""collidable"" and therefore do all sorts of weird shit when someone else has to interact with a trailer near it or a trailer that was supposed to spawn at the same spot.."

We are expanding Going East! content with more of the Hungarian territory, bringing you two new cities: PÃ©cs and Szeged. As you can see on the map, quite a few kilometers of new roads were created to provide good connection to the older section of the map.   Map showing the new roads  EDIT: what I also find interesting is that the map shows a couple of roads never seen in the game before.

EuroTruck2,3ahr2j,borrokalari,2,Sat Jun 20 13:11:40 2015 UTC,"Yes I can manually drop it, I'm just wondering under what circumstances it's meant to drop on it's own. I'll try a heavy official trailer next, I have a suspicion that mod trailers don't trigger the axle."
EuroTruck2,3ah7v6,jimmers14,3,Sat Jun 20 03:52:36 2015 UTC,"Here's screenshots of my settings, hope that helps. I have the logitech f710, which is pretty much the same thing as the f310, just wireless I believe. I have my controls set to be very heavy and realistic (I think it's realistic, I've never driven these trucks). Just raise sensitivities and such if you want easier/quicker controls. Good luck."
EuroTruck2,3agrn9,natergonnanate,2,Sat Jun 20 01:02:31 2015 UTC,"In single player, time stops when you aren't playing the game.  In multi player, time continues even if you've quit.  If you start a job in multiplayer, and want to finish it at a later date without late penalties, do so in single player.  You can talk to nearby players by pressing the Y key, type your message and press enter.  Other vehicles are not ghosts, except in areas like ports, delivery companies, and repair depots.  As soon as you are on the open road, collisions can definitely happen.  Try to avoid that happening."

EuroTruck2,3ad06q,Gluttony4,8,Fri Jun 19 02:48:32 2015 UTC,"Have you never seen someone reversing a trailer in real life, or done it yourself?  Backing up a trailer, be it a big rig trailer or a dinky one on the back of your car, is hard if you've never done it before. You need to learn when the trailer turns and how to turn it.  A quick google search and you can find many videos of people backing up.  Go study them and see how they move.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah-HdcwoUsY  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLgzCy2I2WE  (These videos are examples of stuff I've found, they aren't really guides..)"
EuroTruck2,3ad06q,MrCane,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:01:17 2015 UTC,"That's certainly what I was trying to do. In the first video as they back in, they adjust, a little left, a little right, a little left, slowly and carefully.  I tried to do that too. Slow and careful, a little left, a little right, a little left, slowly and carefully. Instead my trailer would go a little right, a little more right, a little more right, same direction no matter how I try to turn."
EuroTruck2,3ad06q,KayleeFlies,6,Fri Jun 19 03:09:25 2015 UTC,"Just in case you're having the same problem as I was, I kept forgetting to center the wheel and then adjust. I'd be parking and then go to make a tiny adjustment, but forget my wheel was already completely cranked to one side. So instead of being a tiny bit off center for the next adjustment, I was still completely to one side and making a huge turn.   What I'm trying now is get in a good position, completely recenter my wheel, and then make a tiny correction. I'm also still really new to the game, so I'm using the overhead view (keyboard 3) to try to understand what I'm doing overall, and then work gradually towards using only the cab view. I'm using a controller, so I'm not sure how applicable this is for other control schemes."
EuroTruck2,3ad06q,moonmoon0100,4,Fri Jun 19 04:07:34 2015 UTC,"Ah! This is helpful! I actually managed to park it for a delivery thanks to this!  Still tough when the yard doesn't leave much room to maneuver, but it seems this was my problem."
EuroTruck2,3ad06q,KNuCK13_70P,3,Fri Jun 19 04:48:15 2015 UTC,"make sure your wheels are fully turned and also it takes time. if your going full left, it takes time for the trailer to align and finally turn right"
EuroTruck2,3ad06q,KayleeFlies,3,Fri Jun 19 03:38:21 2015 UTC,"If your truck's front wheels are pointing to the right, the rate at which your trailer moves left increases (the rate at which the trailer moves right decreases). If your truck's front wheels are pointing left, the rate at which the trailer moves left decreases (the rate at which the trailer moves right increases).  Simply turning the wheel does not mean that the trailer will move in the opposite direction; it depends on the current angle between the trailer and the truck. The trick is to reverse VERY SLOWLY and make minor adjustments. Try to avoid jack-knifing or large angles between the trailer and the truck. You often need to preempt the direction that the trailer needs to go by turning earlier than you think you need to, as it takes a while for the trailer to start moving the way that you want it to.  If you get to the delivery location really early, you can spend a bit of time practicing as this is definitely one thing that improves with practice."
EuroTruck2,3ad06q,erix84,2,Fri Jun 19 03:02:14 2015 UTC,"As a new player, I very much agree with spending a lot of time parking. I think on one of my runs I spent more time parking than getting there. I've wound up reaching delivery locations at least 10 hours before they are due, so there is plenty of time to learn. Just keep working at it, and it gets easier."
EuroTruck2,3ad06q,BulkHardpec,3,Fri Jun 19 04:13:12 2015 UTC,"I use a 360 controller, I try to line myself up as straight as possible in front of the spot. I use the in-cab camera, and look all the way to the left (the head outside the truck looking back view), and you move the joystick the way you want the trailer to go but you have to make very small adjustments and counter steer back early, helps when you go slow also.  Took me like 20 minutes the first time, it feels weird because it moves the opposite direction you would think it would, but now it takes me about 2 minutes tops to park it."
EuroTruck2,3ad06q,FelixTheCupcake,2,Fri Jun 19 07:48:31 2015 UTC,"I try to treat the truck as the steering wheel of the trailer, which helps reduce the complexity. Sticking to overhead view initially makes things much easier, as does trying to get the trailer as lined up as possible before starting. Keep at it. It does get easier!"
EuroTruck2,3ad06q,lawkill,2,Fri Jun 19 07:19:27 2015 UTC,"Through my travels I have developed a few tips that may help you. I use a keyboard and mouse, but I steer with the keys instead of the mouse. I also use 'auto-centre' which automatically centres the steering wheel as your truck moves.   Straighten out your trailer as much as possible before beginning your manoeuvre. When possible, drive straight over and through the marked area and reverse back int o it without having to make too many major adjustments to steering Take it slow! If you're reversing too fast, your trailer can quickly get off track and you end up 'scissoring' (a term I just made up.) Move your trailer around so that your steering wheel is on the inside (same side) as the parking bay. (Example: If you're RHD, you need to park the truck so that the driver's side is closest to the building you're parking in front of.) Focus on the mirror closest to you, and occasionally check the far side mirror. It may help if you try to keep both mirrors displaying the white outline of the parking space, that way you're pretty much gonna get it as you're within the area to count as a manual reverse. Practice, have fun and good luck!   A lot of this will come naturally to you as you learn your truck and techniques.  EDIT: Finishing sentences"
EuroTruck2,3ad06q,methshin,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:44:39 2015 UTC,"Centering the wheel was definitely my biggest problem. The tutorial just sorta dropped me into a truck without explaining any of the intricacies, and I had no idea that was a thing that needed to be done.  I've been able to back in for three deliveries now. Still having trouble with the yards that have a wall directly across from the parking space that doesn't leave any room to drive forward and straighten out."
EuroTruck2,3ad06q,lzkbloodmage,2,Fri Jun 19 13:31:53 2015 UTC,"Copying and pasting my reply from another post asking the same thing:  Opposite lock with a trailer, What i do is stick my head out the window and look backwards, now left makes the trailer go left, and right...well right. Don't rush it either need time to make slight adjustments."
EuroTruck2,3ad06q,BUTTERNUBS1995,2,Fri Jun 19 13:41:58 2015 UTC,"It's not easy to describe for me, you just need to know when to turn your wheels and when to accelerate.  Switching to outside the cab so you can see your tires helps a lot if you are struggling."
EuroTruck2,3aakbx,koelebobes,9,Thu Jun 18 15:17:18 2015 UTC,I recommend it 100% I got a Logitech g27 and it's been a dream. It's the most fun I've ever had in a video game. It's much more fun then using just two keys or even the mouse. Definitely recommend
EuroTruck2,3aakbx,deltatag,6,Thu Jun 18 15:20:35 2015 UTC,Yes. The game got much more enjoyable for me. I also got the same wheel that you're getting.

EuroTruck2,3aakbx,TheWorldEndsWithMe,3,Thu Jun 18 15:30:01 2015 UTC,It might be locked to 200 degrees so you have to find the option to change it. Other than that I didn't have any problems.

EuroTruck2,3aakbx,famguy07,2,Thu Jun 18 15:31:08 2015 UTC,"Setting up the wheel was not too hard, make sure you download the logitech game profiler, leave settings at default i believe. Then just go and test around, i think i had the ever so slightest deadzone on the steering to stop it from being scetchy, otherwise, put all those settings to minimum as the profiler does a good job of it all.   As for buying, I got mine from Ebay and it was damaged on transit, but that was due to Yodel, fuck Yodel. I got it for free with the gear down pedal being snapped off, was able to fashion my own, so I am happy."
EuroTruck2,3aakbx,famguy07,2,Thu Jun 18 15:55:02 2015 UTC,"Don't leave the wheel on default settings like some people are saying here. Download the Logitech profiler, but male sure it's the wheel one. It'll be on the downloads page for the wheel. The reason for that is that there's another profiler for keyboards and mice. In the profiler, make a profile for ets2 and go to game settings at the top and specific game settings. Change the wheel rotation to 780 because that's 1:1 in ets. Getting used to the profiler will make your experience so much better. Enjoy"
EuroTruck2,3aakbx,famguy07,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:27:29 2015 UTC,You helped me out a lot but i'm running into a problem.

But how should I fix this because I can't put the truck in Cruise control now :(
EuroTruck2,3aakbx,hydraulicgoat,1 point,Thu Jun 18 21:29:36 2015 UTC,"if thats the case, play around with the combined axis setting in the same menu, and when youre done, rerun the wizard in ets2 so it properly detects the pedals. like i said, getting to know that profiler will really improve your experience. most issues can be fixed by changing something with the profiler. feel free to pm me in the future if you have problems and i can try to help you out"

Significantly more trucks on the road are manual vs automatic. Some even have easily 16+ gears. Besides, personally, I feel that auto is boring. its just steering pretty much. at least with manual you have SOMETHING to do with your other hand other than jacking off."

That is about 1/8th the area of the contiguous states. Most of the east coast (all of New England, NJ, PA, MD, DE, and parts of VA) would be about as densely populated as the european map is, though much of the midwest and western US is fairly empty.

EuroTruck2,39h2p7,0wolfboy0,4,Thu Jun 11 17:49:48 2015 UTC,"First of all, don't buy until it's daily or flash deal.  About DLC: there are two map expansions. They are Going East (Poland) and Scandinavia. The rest of the DLC is just skins and cargo (which you can also get from user-made mods). There used to be a Gold edition of the game that included Going East, but I don't think that's around anymore.  And I don't think you need the map expansion DLCs for MP.  So: wait until price is very low, buy map expansions only if you are truly interested in the game."
EuroTruck2,39h2p7,spioner,3,Thu Jun 11 21:30:15 2015 UTC,I can confirm that no map expansions are needed for mp.

I don't know of any user mods that do what the heavy cargo pack does, which is add a second attribute to the cargo. For instance cargo can be high value as well as fragile for instance. This not only gives a bit more money, but gives more experience. That is the true value of the heavy cargo dlc."
EuroTruck2,39h2p7,mrcandyman,1 point,Fri Jun 12 09:50:53 2015 UTC,"I suppose it does add a bit of value if you care about the small amount of extra cash and XP, but that's not really what the game is about for me personally.  I can live just fine with only the map expansions and some mods, but you may not.  Hmm, it looks like you need the High Power Cargo DLC for some achievements now. Might just go buy that anyway then..."

It has some beautiful scenery and, most importantly, some VERY challenging parts.   Jazzycat - I have no clue who this person is, but their trailer mods are the bees knees. Seriously. Get all of them. You won't regret it.  If you've watched Squirrels videos, he has a mod pack out that adds custom skins for trucks and changes the appearance of your garages and the recruitment shops.  Those are the must haves for me.

EuroTruck2,38dffi,TheKosmonavt,5,Wed Jun 3 14:25:18 2015 UTC,"When I've started over, start by taking the jobs with the best price/km and work up until you can afford the cheapest truck possible. Then drive that until you can afford a bigger garage, another cheap truck, and a driver, and just expand your fleet as fast as possible. Get the drivers before upgrading your trucks, because they make money without any effort from you."
EuroTruck2,38dffi,jimmy_gd_fan,3,Wed Jun 3 16:48:51 2015 UTC,It is a little more against your trainer/savegame method but here goes nothing:  Some cargo mods have ridiculous rewards for oversize load. The deliveries are slightly more challenging but you get so much more money (like 5-10x as much). I would especially consider this if you plan to mod your game anyways. The additional trailers add a bit of variety to the later game as well (when money is of secondary concern).
EuroTruck2,38dffi,Lazer_Destroyer,3,Wed Jun 3 17:20:38 2015 UTC,"I find that focusing on longer hauls (as opposed to JIT or ADR hauls) seem to be more worthwhile in terms of getting paid in larger sums. As you level up, focus your upgrade points on this rather than other skills (like eco driving)."
EuroTruck2,38dffi,acherion,2,Wed Jun 3 22:19:24 2015 UTC,I think realey the fastes way of getting money is to get some cheap trucks some driver and then you just sleep since that is the fastest way the time goes by and all your drivers make money for you. when you do that you should also invest the money in more drivers and cheap trucks between sleep breaks.

Like others have said, there are some maps that offer bigger and more complex cities, so you might wanna take a look at those.   Otherwise, American Truck Simulator will feature some more complex cities, like Las Vegas. Still not fully detailed, but at least there will be more detailed roads than you see in ETS."

EuroTruck2,387i3l,Lazer_Destroyer,4,Wed Jun 3 09:28:09 2015 UTC,Maybe look for map mods. The standard game really lacks city driving.
EuroTruck2,387i3l,FelixTheCupcake,4,Tue Jun 2 13:35:48 2015 UTC,I believe the Scandinavia DLC added larger cities and more roads inside and around them. I'm pretty sure the DLC was on sale 24 hours ago too.

I haven't run into this issue but I'm wondering if that might be it. I wish I could help more.  EDIT: A little searching and I've seen people recommend uninstalling Direct X and reinstalling. Others still are saying to reinstall the MP mod with admin privileges. Another thing you can do is verify the integrity of your game files under the games' steam properties.

The only time it isn't therapeutic or mindless, is those damn roundabouts. That is where a majority of my crashes happen, and it is so frustrating."

Where it gets you is how they will randomly throw some of the twisties in, so you go from 120 KPH to 40 KPH out of nowhere.   Personally I enjoy the mainland part of Greece on the TSM map much more. Its really pretty, but pretty damn challenging with huge hill that twist and turn.  Definitely a must have in my book."

EuroTruck2,37dy4s,thetoastmonster,2,Wed May 27 15:17:45 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I don't think it's worth not using TSM. It integrates very well with the ETS2 map, and has only 2 drawbacks that I can find. The first is the save issue, which is only a issue if you want it to be. I just use it to make sure I drive better, since I know I can't revert to the last autosave to fix a screw up. The other issue is those shiny new toll booths that have the easy pass you can just drive through without stopping? TSM overrides those back to the old style where all the lanes have gates on them. Minor gripe, and that will probably be fixed in a TSM update soon I would think.  But adding the rest of Italy, Spain, France, the north of Africa and, my personal favorite, Greece, is well worth those two (small in my opinion) gripes. Greece is a LOT of fun, and challenge, to drive through. Seriously, you should use TSM."

EuroTruck2,37bp73,MarshallTom,8,Tue May 26 13:18:06 2015 UTC,"Sure, I'll just give you a heads up on the multiplayer mod. It's simply the vanilla game, but without any traffic other than parked cars and of course the other players driving around. It automatically disables all mods as well. The time in-game runs slower than vanilla ETS2 (no idea why this is) and most jobs only expire after like 5000 hours.  Like you asked, it's definitely not dead. Its popularity is still growing more and more, but the servers have limited space at the moment. On most European nights it might take a while before you can connect. Some people don't like the fact that there are some idiots driving around in multiplayer, flying through corners and smashing into other trucks, making you wonder why they aren't playing GTA and that some parts of the map can be pretty lonely because A) there aren't many jobs that take you there or B) some sort of DLC is required which some people don't have.  Also, the servers aren't perfect so most trucks you see might be lagging a little, so keep your distance, especially when overtaking. If you want to meet a bunch of other truckers I'd suggest you go to the areas in and around the Netherlands (the Europoort, famous for its in-game traffic jams, is located there), Belgium and Germany. Just be aware that not everyone is equally skilled at driving so always keep that in mind when you try to overtake someone or when someone's overtaking you.  That is I believe most of what you should know about the mod. I highly recommend getting the game and the mod because doing convoys is really a lot of fun, so happy trucking!"

Some because they like trucks. It's a variety of people who play the game in a variety of ways. Some pay attention to speed limits and the rules of the road and some, well, don't. Yet, all those different players get to a point where they have to realise something: It's not about how you play, it's not about your truck or your driving skills. The game wants you to realise what it's about.  It's about the job. The job is what matters.  I feel like I've already said too much. There's a job waiting for you to be done. How? It's up to you."

EuroTruck2,36wj2n,King_Pooper,8,Fri May 22 18:28:27 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: not a trucker, don't even actually have my normal license (25, get on that Shizu), all this comes from ETS2 and related research I've done.  Just realized this isn't in order, and is long and wordy. Sorry :/  Air brakes! Truck brakes prefer to fail safe, and so require air pressure to release the shoe from the wheel; this is the hiss you hear when trucks come to a stop, the pressure coming out in order to brake. When you tick on the air brake simulation option, you'll have to wait some time after starting up the truck for the pressure to build and allow you to move off. You'll also find that as you drive around, if you pump the brakes it will eventually give up and force you to stop, as you have bled out all the pressure and, again, it must build up. There's a gauge dedicated to this in all trucks, though some dashboards make it easier to see than others. Volvo FH for instance has it as a page on the driver info screen, but it's a different page from the digital speedometer, so there's that.  Engine retarders! As I understand, it's a magnet that slows the wheel without being a full on brake, very useful for going down hills. It's less powerful than the engine brake (or jake brake, the vrbrbrbrbrbr brake you've probably heard before), and much less powerful than the airbrakes. I used them a lot when keyboard and mouse driving; map the retarder to mouse wheel, use wheel for smoother braking than the STOP RIGHT THERE slam on brakes of keyboard. Now that I use a wheel, though, I like to tick the automatic engine retarder option, so that partially depressing the brake triggers the retarder, rather than going straight to airbrakes. Lets you bleed off speed without fully stopping.  Engine brake! (or ""jake brake"", comes from the manufacturer IIRC) In reality it's like putting a damper over the exhaust, that pressure slows down the engine or something, results in the BRBRBRBRBR you've probably heard real trucks do. In game, it's just another brake, in between retarders and the airbrakes for power. The engine brake has more braking power the higher the engine RPM, so you generally want to use it in conjunction with a downshift or two. Real trucks I think will ride the engine brake down a mountain to save normal braking wear, but the ETS2 engine brake is generally too powerful to do that, you just end up dipping below whatever speed you want. Retarder is better for going down a mountain, engine brake is good for coming to a stop even faster when combined with retarder and finally airbrake (good for screaming into a tollbooth from 120kph). The automatic engine brake option works just like the auto retarder: applies it when you're pressing the normal braking controls. I tend to leave it off; the retarder is more than adequate to come to a stop without launching me through the windshield, and I can easily reach the engine brake if I really really need to stop now.  Taglift/midlift axles! I... honestly don't know. The extra axle helps handle the weight of oversized loads (AFAIK you require the third axle for the huge loads in ETS2 now) at the expense of turning radius and fuel capacity. There's more realistic bits I'm sure about which axles actually get engine power, which ones can steer, and stuff like that. You could in theory raise the taglift to get a tighter turning radius (only one set of rear wheels to turn rather than two), but in practice I never notice a difference. The automatic taglift option doesn't seem to help at all either; ETS2 prefers to leave the taglift lowered at all times, never seems to raise it on its own.  Turning! You have more front room than you think, and have to remember when pulling a trailer that its axis of steering is way behind you. If you need the trailer to turn sharply, you need to turn even more sharply to yank the front of the trailer over. I know the on-ramps you're talking about, the ones where it's a loop coming off the road and the on-ramp goes straight on right next to it. I hate those. My best advice is to skip the turn lane, turn from the middle lane and flip off any cars that get mad about you breaking the rules. Keep an eye on your outside mirror. If it looks like you'll clip the corner, just slow way down and let the trailer grind, it won't take damage if you're slow."
EuroTruck2,36wj2n,kamishizuka,1 point,Sat May 23 01:09:57 2015 UTC,"Oh, beautiful wall of text, I love you!  Ok, so I'm still a little unclear on wait times for the air brake pressure, but at least I know there's a guage for finding out somewhere in my panels.  Thank you.  I still dont know about those taglifts either.  I mean, I can guess that the truck needs to be stopped to lift or lower them, but for all I know, they can be raised or dropped on the fly.  I'll just leave them on auto though - baby steps.  Yep, that's the turn I mean.  I was hoping to find out more about how to take it without breaking rules,  real trucks do that stuff legally somehow, but I just cannot figure how they pull it off.  Nothing I try works reliably, so I'll probably just keep cheating I guess.  That engine retarder bit makes sense.  I definitely want to start using that now, I can already see where it's more useful than the airbrakes or the engine brake, which I've always used as 'emergency airbrake helper', to help the regular brake when I'm coming in too fast to stop in time with just them."
EuroTruck2,36wj2n,Titan357,2,Sat May 23 20:01:23 2015 UTC,"I wrote a guide some time ago, you can find it here I also suggest going to r/trucksim as well.   engine retarders   If I am not mistaken, you are talking about the engine brake and the transmission retarder. They are both ways of slowing down without using or supplementing the service brakes.     That lifting wheel   That is called a tag lift axle, or helper axle. They are used in cases where you need the extra axle on the ground when loaded, but want to save on fuel/tires when not loaded/no trailer. IRL it saves 4 tires from wearing, in the game im not sure how it effects tire wear, trucks turn better (IRL/game) with the tag lift up. this might help   do those turns right   You can find plenty of videos on youtube for that, mostly it just takes time to get a ""feel"" for it."

Even if not, as long as it presents axes then ETS2 should be able to make sense of them.  Sensitivity is the real decider. If the wheel only reports every few degrees of turn, rather than a smooth curve, then your in-game steering will be jittery and possibly not that controllable. On the other hand, if it's just a matter of the wheel not turning that far (say, 180 degrees either direction), you can get around that with the non-linearity settings in ETS2."

EuroTruck2,36kffi,mrcandyman,3,Wed May 20 02:50:35 2015 UTC,"It depends on the load and the vehicle that hits it in my experience. Loads that aren't close to the back end will be fine, but ones that are might get damaged. If a semi truck rear ends it, you're pretty much guaranteed damage."

EuroTruck2,35wn59,btd19m,1 point,Thu May 14 05:20:31 2015 UTC,"Cummins builds some stout motors, my dad brags on them a lot. None of the Kenworth W900l mods look or drive right in the game unfortunately."
EuroTruck2,35wn59,btd19m,1 point,Thu May 14 05:48:29 2015 UTC,i agree. my dad works for a group with about 40 trucks. they lost 4 cummins at the start of this year to dust and varous other things. one put a piston through the side of the block. none of them were 6 months old. the rest are all cat motors and the drivers wont touch the last cummins it has not moved in about 6 months. after that one truck put the piston through the block no one is game to tow 150 ton plus with them on dirt roads. still remember pumping over 300L of oil through them to drain out the dirt. the cat motors are really good for the hills around here when you have 3 or 4 40 ton trailers and you need that bit extra up the hill. they have a dry weight of around 15 ton on coal tippers (side tipping) and back tippers (grain) are around 17  - 20 ton dry. its one of those things where you weigh empty and you load after every time and you weigh each trailer sometimes and then weigh them all up after.
EuroTruck2,35wn59,btd19m,2,Thu May 14 07:15:57 2015 UTC,Around here they just pull dump trailers and haul coal. I think the one my dad pulls is a 38 foot Mac dump trailer. They used to haul 100tons but the DOT cracked on that one bad.

EuroTruck2,35snnt,Ryan1577,6,Wed May 13 04:20:42 2015 UTC,"I've posted this before, but it's still relevant:  I personally use the Logitech Driving Force GT.  You can map plenty of buttons to the wheel, it has a simple up/down gear knob - and even if you don't use it for manual transmission, you can still assign functions to it.  Mine cost around Â£120 new, but I'm pretty sure that the price has dropped, and you can pick up a used one for much less."
EuroTruck2,35snnt,n900-in-car,2,Wed May 13 05:57:41 2015 UTC,Agreed. Managed to get a driving force gt on eBay for only Â£1! It was listed as not working and all It needed was a new plug/fuse.   Would highly recommend it. There are loads of buttons to use and it has full 900 degrees rotation.   Far cheaper than a g27 but contains most of the features (minus obviously a h shifter and clutch!)
EuroTruck2,35snnt,jamiemulcahy,1 point,Wed May 13 20:33:42 2015 UTC,Recomend the dfgt love the wheel search ebay you can find some good deals on one
EuroTruck2,35snnt,matt90679,1 point,Wed May 13 14:28:20 2015 UTC,"Can wholeheartedly agree with this. I don't personally own one but I have used my friends and it is the best driving experience I've ever had. Well, the only other experience I've ever had is with a controller or keyboard, but damn it was fun. It has full 900 degree turning, lovely force feedback, plenty of buttons and a nice sequential shifter. There are some flappy paddles, but I reserved them for indicators. Just an all round good wheel and I had a blast with it."
EuroTruck2,35snnt,MentalTiger1,2,Wed May 13 21:02:08 2015 UTC,"If you want a wheel that is also compatible with your PS4, the Thrustmaster T100 is a decent entry model with force feedback, that alone sets it above the T80. You can find it for under â¬/$100.  The T100 is not officially listed as PS4 compatible but it does appear to work, and is supported by games like Drive Club and Project Cars.  And of course it works with the PC/ETS2."
EuroTruck2,35snnt,hovercraft_of_eels,2,Wed May 13 08:03:35 2015 UTC,Thrustmaster T100   Well... I don't know if this is a good choice. It has only 270 degrees of rotation and for a game like ETS you'd want a 900 for a better experience.
EuroTruck2,35snnt,uglykidjonah,1 point,Wed May 13 10:36:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed, that's why I'd call it an entry model. OP mentions the G27 is 'way out' of their price range though, and any good steering wheel will cost about the same as a G27."
EuroTruck2,35snnt,hovercraft_of_eels,1 point,Wed May 13 10:39:13 2015 UTC,"Also agree to that.. buing G27 would be a mistake, but going cheap just because you are a begginer wouldn't work either in my opinion. As n900-in-car suggested the Logitech GT has most of G27 features and can be bought for $60 on e-bay for used one and ~$100 for brand new, which is fair I guess. And there is much more probability that he wouldn't have to buy a new one if it feels wrong :)"
EuroTruck2,35snnt,uglykidjonah,2,Wed May 13 12:15:28 2015 UTC,"If you are going to get one I wouldn't get anything less than the G27. Its the best deal for the money and works with many games that once you have a wheel you will end up wanting anyway.  Just save up some more and get one, sometimes they get a pretty good sale around holidays.  Once you get a wheel I suggest getting a track Ir eventually as well. It took me a long time but I finally assembled everything the way I want it.. Really the only thing I have left to get is a button box and extra shiftier to convert to a more truck style shiftier."
EuroTruck2,35snnt,Titan357,1 point,Fri May 15 04:46:56 2015 UTC,"Personally I'm cheap, so I use a Microsoft Sidewinder Precision Racing Wheel.  Doesn't come with a clutch or gear shifter, just the wheel, brake and accelerator.  The rotation is certainly not 900 degrees, but as a My First Wheel kinda product, it's fine for me.  You'll probably find one on eBay pretty cheap."
EuroTruck2,35snnt,thetoastmonster,1 point,Wed May 13 11:27:19 2015 UTC,"I'm using a G25. If you can find one in decent condition and in your price range, I highly recommend you to get one. It feels great and has plenty of buttons. The big bonus is: you can use the paddle shifters, H-shifter or you can even turn the H-shifter into a sequencial shifter (not possible on G27). Especially for ETS I use the sequencial a lot.  My G25 us going strong since ~5 years and no major issues. Highly recommend it!"
EuroTruck2,35snnt,Lazer_Destroyer,1 point,Wed May 13 13:11:29 2015 UTC,"While the G27 is a nice wheel, I don't need/want all the features at that price. If you can afford to spend that much on a wheel, then by all means go for it.   I recently picked up a like new Driving Force GT for $37 off eBay. Only cosmetic issue is some scratches on the GT horn button. I got it set up pretty easily (had some issues with key bindings and such switching from keyboard/mouse/controller). Took about 30 minutes to fix that up and have the wheel 100% functional.   I have buttons right on the wheel for pretty much every function and still have buttons left over. I'm slowly replacing anything I missed to have a wheel button. Pretty much only use the mouse in menus and to free look, but once I'm clear I have interior center view mapped to a button right near my thumb on the wheel.   The Driving Force Pro is pretty similar I believe. The GT has 900 degrees rotation and I'm pretty sure the Pro does as well. I would do the GT as they run about the same price."
EuroTruck2,35pkoc,SavvyGent,14,Tue May 12 13:45:39 2015 UTC,"Personally I would really like to see them do an overhaul of the ports. With Scandinavia, we now have a large amount of ports in the game, and in most of them, you drive through a random gate that looks nothing like a harbour you would visit in real life, and stop on a green square right inside the gates. - Even in the few harbours where you get to drive onto a ferry, it does not have the right feel.  They could simply place a road leading to the harbour, to give the feel of arriving at a harbour, instead of turning in through some shady gate, that you would never guess was a harbour. Place a toll booth system at the entrance. Have lanes leading up to the ferry (perhaps make the toll both assign you a lane, if they want to go the extra mile) and if they really want to make it nice, have traffic at the harbour, in the lanes and lights to signal when to board. Then finally perhaps make the boarding a bit more of a challenge at a few harbours.   This really wouldn't be that hard for them to implement. Are you guys happy with the currect harbour/ferry system?   For a more long-term project, I would like them to overhaul the economics of the game, but I heard in some interview that they won't get into that, unfortunetly."
EuroTruck2,35pkoc,Smilenator,9,Tue May 12 14:01:03 2015 UTC,"In terms of map areas, I would like the rest of France and perhaps northern Spain.  Or just an upgrade of what we currently have would be amazing. (I want autopay toll booths everywhere.)  Other than that the physics and AI could probably do with some tweaks."
EuroTruck2,35pkoc,DJShaneypup,3,Tue May 12 14:03:55 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see that as their next expansion as well. Perhaps add a bit more of Italy too, in a ""Going South!"" expansion. Although it would be a bit wierd with all the new stuff around the old stuff, which would serve as something of a ""speedbump"" when going from new place to new place (for instance Sweden to Spain) :)   Autopay toll booths would be nice and shouldn't take too long to implement. Let's hope SCS reads that idea."
EuroTruck2,35pkoc,LegendPT,8,Tue May 12 14:12:03 2015 UTC,I would like to see changing road conditions. Like every update they move road construction around or something.
EuroTruck2,35pkoc,King_Pooper,4,Tue May 12 15:20:40 2015 UTC,"Would be cool, but I think that only the most hardcore players would notice, and the work required would be way too high to justify it."
EuroTruck2,35pkoc,King_Pooper,7,Tue May 12 16:22:22 2015 UTC,"I would like to see a lot more difficult roads, we have so many highways already. More country roads, small villages, dirt roads. Even dangerous mountain roads! I always find narrow roads much more fun to drive on for some reason.  I would also like to see natural disasters happening that would force us to go through a different route than we originally planned."
EuroTruck2,35pkoc,temotodochi,6,Wed May 13 03:43:17 2015 UTC,"I'd like to be able to free roam in a car or truck to make discoveries, and keep it in one of my garages when I'm doing deliveries.  While I'm thinking about garages, I'd like to be able to do at least simple repairs up to 10 or 25% damage at my garage, especially if I have the large garage with the gas pump.  I'd like to have light, intermittent rain instead of just deluge setting, so I have a reason to use intermittent wipers.  I'd like to have the sun pass behind the clouds occasionally, dimming the sunlight temporarily on occasion.  I'd like to be able to ride along with one of my employees to watch what they do, and just enjoy the scenery going by like some kind of super-awesome screensaver mode.  I'd like to see a volume setting for certain sound effects, or an option to turn them off entirely so that I'm not listening to 120 decibel yawns every thirty seconds for the last few km of my trip, or that cash register sound when I'm playing at 2am and everything else is fairly quiet.  I'd like to add insurance and premiums and rates so that I actually have a pretty good reason to follow the laws.  I'd like for every ausfart to have a place to turn around within a kilometer or two for those times when I take a wrong turn - seriously Europe, is there a law against turning around over there?  I dont want one mistake to mean that I have to travel to the next town just to find a place to turn around and go back because of all those dividers everywhere.  I'd like for night time to be black again instead of this eternal twilight that the new graphics have changed it to.  I'd like to see random accident scenes on the roads that I have to drive around, or vehicles pulled over to the side of the road by the cops.  I'd like to see law enforcement and ambulances occasionally cruising on the roads, sometimes with sirens blaring as they speed past me, other times, just patrolling.  I want to finish a 1000 km delivery with a good coating of dust and mud on my truck, and I'd like to be able to pull into a truck wash to clean it, or have those rainstorms do it for me.  I'd like to be able to set a destination on my GPS that I havent been to before so I dont have to guess (Scandinavia has some real snakepile intersections, plus a full four leaf clover intersection - if I free roam it, about 90% of the time, I take the wrong one because the map isnt very specific in some places about turnoffs when the roads are complicated.  And the aforementioned 'no place to turn around' doesnt help.  I'd like the option to buy a coffee at a gas station to delay the onset of tiredness, at least once or twice a day.  I'd like sleeping areas to be marked with a floating icon the way everything else is.  I'd like more variety in color/material schemes for the cockpit interiors.  I want to be able to buy fuzzy dice.  I'd like to hear the AI traffic honk their horn at me if I'm dawdling at an intersection or otherwise making their digital lives miserable.  But as it stands the game's pretty good, so I'm not panicked about any of that.  I'm just listing what I ocassionally think about as I'm driving along doing my deliveries and knocking random cars into the ditch for hoots and giggles.  I have three million dollars in the bank, I can afford to have some fun with them.."
EuroTruck2,35pkoc,KNuCK13_70P,2,Tue May 12 16:20:59 2015 UTC,"Some good suggestions in there. I'd like to comment on some of them:  I've often thought about the possibilty of buying a car in game, and I hope they add it. I've noticed at least one full sized car dealership in the new expansion, so perhaps we will get lucky there in time. There are no good car driving (not racing) games to my knowledge, and I've liked to use ETS2 to get on the road and drive before being able to drive in real life, and as a (small) supplement in taking my drivers license, so adding a car would be fantastic and a good way for SCS to grab a few extra market shares.  Small repairs in the garage is an exellent idea, and it would bump the complexity of the business side ever so slightly (I'll take anything I can get in that department)  Insurance and premiums is another idea that I hadn't thought about, and would be a good way to up the complexity of the business side.   Regarding accident scenes, you are in luck. Intentionally or not, the AI crash into each other from time to time in hillarious fashion. Police cars and ambulances driving by with sirens would be pretty cool.   One of the things that bothers me a little about Scandinavia is the fact that there are very few roads and very few places to explore. Take Norway as an example, I don't think there are more than 3 or 4 roads. However there are hundreds of sideroads with the annoying ""can't drive in here"" sign. That doesn't leave much room for exploring, but I do think GPS to a location should be added too.  Buying coffee at a gas station to stay awake is fun idea, but you would still need to get tickets for crossing the drive-to-rest ratio rules. They would need to make a whole new system for that, if it's not tied to the sleep-cycle.   The AI do honk their horns at us. I've been honked at many times. One time in particular when I had enough gas to get to 1 meter short of the gas station, but had to stop for someone filling. When he drove away, I didn't have enough gas to get the engine started again and was stuck. That formed a long line behind me, into the road as well, and created an army of honking AI. :)"
EuroTruck2,35pkoc,TheFreshMaker21,1 point,Tue May 12 16:47:04 2015 UTC,"Huh, I didnt know that about the horns.  I guess I just cant hear them from inside the cockpit.  I did know about the AI accidents, and have been caught up in a few myself, primarily from AI who think I'll move out of their way if they just merge into my lane at a toll booth.  They're like psycho kamikazis there for some reason, and apparently love the crunchy sound of their car against whatever load I'm hauling.  Accidents are fun to watch happen, but I'd also like to see random accident scenes too, with a flipped vehicle or six, some flares out, EMS parked nearby, and some cop directing traffic.  I've heard a lot about the occasional massive pileups on the autobahn, but havent seen one yet.  As for that insurance thing, after my first couple of million dollars banked I lose any concern for my fellow drivers on the road, because I'm more interested in driving than in waiting at intersections for traffic etc...  The possibility of losing my license for a while might help re-track me. Might even be fun to have to deal with my employees occasionally losing their license, or wrecking their trucks so I have to buy them a new one now and then."
EuroTruck2,35pkoc,PCGamerUnion,2,Tue May 12 17:05:41 2015 UTC,Proper winter with snow(not just textures). And dirt roads.

EuroTruck2,35omrv,soggycookie,20,Tue May 12 06:30:30 2015 UTC,"I think it's a mix of a few things. I love driving in general, it's one of my favourite parts of the day. The challenge of driving a truck is something I'll probably never get to do irl, so doing it in a game is the next best thing. It's relaxing to just drive across Europe, I usually listen to music or have a documentary going on my 2nd monitor, it really is a great way to unwind. Growing up, like most boys, I found trucks fascinating and I think part of that is also a reason I love this game. Though like you I can't really pinpoint one thing. I'm just happy I've found this game!"

EuroTruck2,35omrv,GingerSpencer,5,Tue May 12 08:05:33 2015 UTC,It's like crack...one taste and you're hooked.
EuroTruck2,35omrv,cdavis66,5,Tue May 12 08:33:39 2015 UTC,"As I tried to explain to my girlfriend, it's about the atmosphere. Of what it makes me feel (and not necessarily do). I love driving, and always loved car trips since I was a child. My family did plenty of them, some more than 12 hours long one way.   So I just love the feeling of the open road, the comfy humming of the engine, the sound of wind, a good song in the radio, the sun rays illuminating the cabin and the scenery. Every time I get there in with this game it puts a smile of pure joy on my face. Every time."
EuroTruck2,35omrv,soestrada,1 point,Tue May 12 12:05:29 2015 UTC,Exactly the same for me. I also find it tremendously relaxing. I live-stream it too so it's like a virtual road trip with friends.
EuroTruck2,35omrv,Gartokk,2,Tue May 12 16:07:57 2015 UTC,"Building up the business from not owning a truck at all to having several garages and drivers under you. Honestly not many games let you do that. At least not in a way that feels organic and consistent. At least the business side is what keeps me coming back. I wish it had more depth, though."
EuroTruck2,35omrv,Sarstan,4,Tue May 12 08:14:00 2015 UTC,"Building a business has always been one of my favorite things to do in games, and it probably helped getting me hooked on the game initially, but I actually don't think that ETS2 does a very good job at the whole ""build a business"" because it's so detached from your game, and so generic, I mean a random person off the street who has never seen the game before and someone with a masters in economics are going to end up with roughly the same business and income, and none of them has a risk of going broke. Also you never see or interact with your drivers in any way. All they do is generate money, and they pretty much do it on an exponential scale, which could use some tweaking. It has to be the driving aspect, coupled with the challenge of driving and backing with a trailer, I think. I really wish there was more depth to the business side as well."
EuroTruck2,35omrv,SavvyGent,1 point,Tue May 12 13:40:52 2015 UTC,"I like driving, I like shifting gears and I like big trucks.

No one to kill, nothing to jump scare you, no guns blazing....just the pretty scenery and the hum of the diesel."

Gear up is set to triangle (Y on Xbox) and gear down is set to circle (B on Xbox). Cross (A on Xbox) is used for general selections etc, such as filling the truck up or resting.You can use the d-pad to map miscellaneous things like windscreen wipers and whatever else you use frequently, like turning off the truck at rest stops or petrol stations.

EuroTruck2,353rct,NarftS,3,Wed May 6 22:20:25 2015 UTC,"Truck brakes aren't your usual car brakes, as they use air to apply brakes. If you use these air driven brakes (trucks also have retarders and engine brakes as well) too much/too heavily the light will pop on indicating the air needs to refill. Once the air brakes option is ticked in the gameplay settings you will have to stop your truck and refill your air by standing still with your engine on. To avoid this with the option on you would have to chance your driving behavior to adjust to the use of other brakes as well. Hope this helps :)"

EuroTruck2,34xt0f,joeltb,4,Tue May 5 13:25:26 2015 UTC,"You should be fine. Euro Truck DLCs never broke mods they don't overlap, they kinda act like a mod themselves (a big, gorgeous, detailed mod, there is). Since the dlc does not mess with Russia, it should not overlap. Maybe the truck mod can give you some trouble, but after the dlc if it doesn't work, just uninstall the mod and you're good to go.  Backing up your save game is so easy that it's worth doing just because. It's in your documents folder, EuroTruck subfolder. Just copy the entire thing elsewhere before installing the dlc."
EuroTruck2,34xt0f,lucaslslopes,2,Tue May 5 13:34:21 2015 UTC,"Sweet, thanks!"
EuroTruck2,34xt0f,lucaslslopes,2,Tue May 5 16:23:39 2015 UTC,No problem! I'm excited for the DLC too! I'll just have to wait for it to go on sale first hahaha
EuroTruck2,34u1ox,IndigenousOres,2,Mon May 4 15:45:04 2015 UTC,Anyone know when we will get proper Mercedes trucks in? Unless it's happened already.
EuroTruck2,34u1ox,MixedWithFruit,3,Mon May 4 18:29:22 2015 UTC,"SCS says that Mercedes will be available, for free, shortly after the Scandinavia DLC is released, as part of a game update."

EuroTruck2,34ej9k,SavvyGent,3,Thu Apr 30 14:25:56 2015 UTC,"They also released the price of this lovely DLC. 17.99â¬.   It's a bit on the steep side compared to ""Going East!"", although it does seem that they have put in a lot of work into this DLC. Does that justify an 80% increase? What do you guys think?"
EuroTruck2,34ej9k,Spartan_029,2,Thu Apr 30 14:31:08 2015 UTC,I think I am far too excited for this game.
EuroTruck2,34ej9k,Ausgebombt,2,Thu Apr 30 16:42:07 2015 UTC,"I think it's justified.  SCS is doing a great job by giving us a steady (free) updates long after Euro 2 has been out.  Just by the trailer, this looks to be a pretty great expansion.  So I have no issue paying that, especially when it's supporting one of the few developer teams that seem to actually care a little."
EuroTruck2,34ej9k,flashen,3,Thu Apr 30 17:48:07 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that SCS are doing a good job of keeping the updates coming, and I will be one of those people buying it as soon as it is out, both to get the game but also to support SCS in their continued work, but I worry that the price will be so high that it will keep a large amount of people from giving the game a shot. Newcomers will have to pony up 53â¬, for what I would call the essentials. That's a lot of money for this kind of game, and I can't help but wonder if SCS would earn more money if they priced it at, say, 13.99â¬ or even 9.99â¬ instead. Anyway, time will tell, and there are of course the sales to get new people interested I guess, while still profitting from us old timers who are too hungry for new content to wait around for a sale."

EuroTruck2,344yny,Moynia,7,Thu Apr 30 17:16:15 2015 UTC,I've been out of the loop on ETS2 for a while now. Is there a rundown on the recent changes over maybe the last six months somewhere?
EuroTruck2,344yny,RoombaRaces,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:03:48 2015 UTC,They have a blog :)
EuroTruck2,344yny,M3rsh,4,Wed Apr 29 03:56:10 2015 UTC,"The thing with ETS2 is, that the updates will be used in other games as well (think ATS), so we are basically guinea pigs :D Doesn't matter though, game is getting better."
EuroTruck2,344yny,iamsrsuguys,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:32:03 2015 UTC,"I can't quite reconcile your comic with the number of ""paint job"" DLCs in the store at the moment.  edit: since you're all just blindly downvoting me for pointing out that ETS2 has DLC, consider this.  The game only costs $11.49 on Steam right now.  If you exclude the actual content expansions (high power cargo, going east) there's still over $20 worth of ""paint job"" DLC packs, or to look at it another way, you can spend twice as much on buying paint jobs as you'd spend to get the base game.  When Railworks does this, people jump all over them.  But when ETS2 does it, everyone just turns a blind eye, since they love SCS so much."
EuroTruck2,344yny,jardeon,6,Tue Apr 28 13:45:51 2015 UTC,"Because they can be made in a day by one person, allowing the other devs to work. Also they are not a requirement for any other DLC/features"
EuroTruck2,344yny,BUTTERNUBS1995,3,Tue Apr 28 15:06:05 2015 UTC,I consider those to be paint jobs you would buy if relevant to you. I live in the UK so have only bought the UK pack.
EuroTruck2,344yny,MixedWithFruit,2,Tue Apr 28 16:44:01 2015 UTC,"TBF i really liked the polish paint jobs, but i'll see if i am satisfied enough with the others before i try to get them. Russian ones are pretty cool too"
EuroTruck2,344yny,Mayor_Mike,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:55:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly they are a good way to donate a quick buck to them while the artists are paid for something other than idling, and unless you are a collector there is no reason to get them as they add nothing to the gameplay"
EuroTruck2,33vxfa,bwilksey7,2,Sun Apr 26 03:33:37 2015 UTC,"In my experience it depends on the mod, but it should be okay. Make backups of saves before just in case anything goes wrong."
EuroTruck2,33vxfa,TheWorldEndsWithMe,2,Sun Apr 26 07:40:58 2015 UTC,"Most likely you'll get an error message saying something to the effect of ""Game change detected, any delivery you were in the process of has been completed/finished/cancelled and your truck has been relocated to your garage.""  That's what's happened to me in the past when I've changed/deleted mods. But as /u/TheWorldEndsWithMe says - backup, save, and you should be good to go."
EuroTruck2,33vxfa,n900-in-car,2,Sun Apr 26 08:06:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think with the up-coming patch you'll probably find that this mod is made useless.  The patch adds SO much new stuff.  Seriously, go download the beta from Steam and try it ;)"

EuroTruck2,30xlkz,XXLpeanuts,2,Tue Mar 31 15:11:02 2015 UTC,"The last thing I read that it was impossible for them to support 64 bit because of the way they programmed everything.   And how does 32 bit decrease performance? I haven't noticed a single difference in FPS between 32 and 64 bit, so I doubt the difference is that big."
EuroTruck2,30xlkz,lolsokje,0,Tue Mar 31 15:20:04 2015 UTC,"Oh well, haven't played ETS2 much after the 64 bit implementation, so maybe I didn't have enough time to notice."
EuroTruck2,30xlkz,lolsokje,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:39:18 2015 UTC,"You will notice no in-game performance for the most part. 64-bit has the ability to utilize more than 2GB of RAM, thus keeping a larger memory pool. This makes multitasking (alt-tab) easier."
EuroTruck2,30xlkz,Aleroniponi,1 point,Wed Apr 1 09:13:35 2015 UTC,On the 64 bit version you can also just assume the computer will most likely support newer instruction sets that may or may not be useful for the game
EuroTruck2,30xlkz,NotDoingHisJobMedic,-2,Fri Apr 10 21:46:19 2015 UTC,"I think i did but not sure. And its mainly the lack of mods that puts me off too, game looks so ugly without mods to me now."
EuroTruck2,30uc91,dbj1303,3,Mon Mar 30 19:53:54 2015 UTC,"So I just installed this mod and I thought I would give a little feedback on the install process.  As stated in another response to an earlier question (thanks dbj1303), X86 is for 32 bit applications and x64 is for 64 bit applications.  The configuration instructions do work, but were written before ETS2 switched to a 64 or 32 bit set up. When you go to install the files in your game, you will see bin/winX_64 and bin/win_X86. Choose the one for whichever file you down loaded based on if you're running the 64 bit version of ETS2 or the 32 bit version of ETS2.  When I opened the destination folder I wanted to use (in this case win_X64) there was no bin/win_X64/plugins folder. You will need to add a new folder in the win_X64 (or X86) folder. Install both of your new plugin files you downloaded (In my case this was the Real_G27_ffb_X64.dll and Real_G27_ffb.ini files) into the ""plugins"" folder you made. It should work just fine.   I've only briefly tried the mod since I only have a few minutes. The wheel feels pretty good so far. I do have the same dead spot in the middle that I had before, so that's a little disappointing, but I'm used to it. I'll have to take it on a road test tonight."
EuroTruck2,30uc91,ohbarf,2,Sun Apr 5 17:07:06 2015 UTC,"Remember to go through the .ini file in the plugins folder. You can tweak the values to your own liking. Also: Remember to turn off the in-game force feedback, since the two can interfere with each other."
EuroTruck2,30uc91,ohbarf,1 point,Mon Apr 6 02:40:09 2015 UTC,"The instructions state that the in-game ffb has to be off to work right. Definitely an important thing. I haven't played with the .ini file yet, so thanks for pointing that out . I'm going to check that out!"
EuroTruck2,30uc91,gilval10n,1 point,Mon Apr 6 02:53:15 2015 UTC,"Go to the plugins folder, right click it and give everything permission to everything in the Properties/Security.

EuroTruck2,30uc91,ohbarf,1 point,Mon Apr 6 22:26:32 2015 UTC,I'm not seeing it. I guess it wasn't working after all and I was simply okay with what I had.  lol  Oh well.
EuroTruck2,30uc91,gilval10n,1 point,Tue Apr 7 07:14:55 2015 UTC,"If you go to my Douments/Euro Truck Simulator 2/game.log.txt and hit ctrl+b, type in real_g27_ffb and search for it. If it says something about failing to create log, the problem is that the newly created folder don't have the permissions set right and the plugin is unable to create a log file. This log file is different than what I refered to above and it should be created inside the new plugin folder. See if you have a real_g27_ffb.log inside the plugins folder. If not, try to right click the ""plugins"" folder in explorer and go to ""properties"". Go to the ""security"" tab and click the ""edit"" button. Go through the list and give all permissions to to all of them. The plugin should now be able to create a real_g27_ffb.log file and should load properly."
EuroTruck2,30uc91,ohbarf,1 point,Tue Apr 7 08:30:11 2015 UTC,"None of that worked. I didn't find the files. I just uninstalled. I'm not sure what happened. Too bad really.

EuroTruck2,30uc91,ohbarf,1 point,Wed Apr 8 06:05:56 2015 UTC,"Well, the short version of the story is that I've reinstalled the wheel drivers and reinstalled local content for ETS2 after deleting my profiles. The second I enter options, my wheel still goes dead. I'm hoping I can save this somehow."
EuroTruck2,30uc91,gilval10n,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:21:22 2015 UTC,Did you reset the settings you made in the Logitech Gaming Software Profiler? After this my knowledge is short. I would go post in the forum thread for the plugin. I hope this doesnt become an issue if and when I uninstall this.
EuroTruck2,30uc91,ohbarf,1 point,Wed Apr 8 17:25:28 2015 UTC,I followed the instructions but it wasn't successful. I've since uninstalled everything and reinstalled. It's working but it feels weird since I don't have it dialed in yet.   The mod was doing something even though the logs showed nothing (tm).
EuroTruck2,30uc91,JAGoMAN,2,Wed Apr 8 20:00:26 2015 UTC,What is ffb plugin?
EuroTruck2,30uc91,WolfofAnarchy,2,Mon Mar 30 22:11:04 2015 UTC,"Force feedback. It redefines how the wheel acts. I have always thought the vanilla ffb was a bit unfinished. With this plugin, it feels more like a heavy truck, rather than a go kart. :D"
EuroTruck2,30uc91,ohbarf,1 point,Mon Mar 30 22:49:34 2015 UTC,"Also; I have edited the original post to include a better describtion of the plugin, and what it does to your game! :)"

EuroTruck2,30uc91,gilval10n,2,Tue Mar 31 10:56:41 2015 UTC,So is it both download links that we use or is there a particular one? There are 2 links at the bottom of the first post. there's an ffb_x64 and an ffb_x86.
EuroTruck2,30uc91,gilval10n,2,Sat Apr 4 17:38:44 2015 UTC,"X86 is for 32 bit, and x64 is for 64 bit."

In larger group/convoy, people meet up / wait while parking at repair garage or motel. Works pretty well, try to skip the just-in-time if money matters.

EuroTruck2,2zpq2d,uglykidjonah,1 point,Sat Mar 21 09:30:05 2015 UTC,"Naah, they said the beta would be released later... It's probably just some bug fixes for now."
EuroTruck2,2zpq2d,Darkfizch,1 point,Sat Mar 21 11:53:56 2015 UTC,"Ok. Maybe you guys could point me into right direction with this...  I downloaded the installer from their official site, to avoid Steam client (because it does some weird stuff to my other games when running), so how can I get updates and if it's only managed through Steam, is there a way of showing it where the game is installed (it was activated through Steam but installed separately so the only option next to the game and DLCs listed is Install Game)."
EuroTruck2,2zpq2d,uglykidjonah,1 point,Sat Mar 21 15:01:07 2015 UTC,"Wait, so you activated the key on Steam? I'm a little confused here... Anyway, if you have the retail version installed, you can get all official updates (not the betas though, these are Steam-only) off their website. Choose a download link and it should all be fine."
EuroTruck2,2zpq2d,Darkfizch,1 point,Sat Mar 21 15:50:07 2015 UTC,"Nah, wait, I bought it in online store, which was the cheapest way there is, and I activated in-game. The instructions were to activate it on Steam (so yeah it's a retail I guess). Anyway it works both ways, it's just that it's been installed from official website's installer and I was wondering if the updates can be applied both ways.   I guess I asked because I already have 1.16.2 ver, and the only updates on their site are 50mb, so I was curious if this 10mb update that OP suggested was something worth searching for on Steam. But whatever, it's not that important ;)  I apologise, I'm also confused, the world is spinning, I have high fever right now :)"

EuroTruck2,2yhtc2,Levy_Wilson,2,Tue Mar 10 19:20:58 2015 UTC,Ya their bad driving was even worse than mine at times.
EuroTruck2,2yhtc2,Bytescuits,9,Wed Mar 11 02:41:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, several times; the AI is absolutely stupid. Although, some collisions are hilarious, like when they try to overtake you on single lane roads into oncoming traffic. One time, a car tried to overtake me, got slightly ahead of me and then hit an oncoming car. It flipped in front of my truck and I smashed it off the road.

EuroTruck2,2yi3dx,joosha,2,Tue Mar 10 11:14:03 2015 UTC,"Oh crazy, didn't know that. I take it you have to pay pretty much the truck cost to get it back out?   I imagine you probably just have to go back to go back working for other people for a bit in that situation perhaps."
EuroTruck2,2yi3dx,Darkfizch,2,Tue Mar 10 22:58:34 2015 UTC,My guess is they take it as security and give it back when you're out of the red.

EuroTruck2,2yi3dx,denilsonsa,1 point,Tue Mar 10 23:09:52 2015 UTC,I've lost a couple of trucks this way and I can tell you they never give them back... as you see what you do when the bank wants their money back is actually that you sell the truck back to the dealer in order to get a litle more out of debt.

I'm just using one of Jazzycat's mods, which changes the logos and names to real life companies. Ended up searching for this small piece of road (grey coloured) for a while.  Thanks for the tips, guys! Was previously at 99.81%, but checked each city for undiscovered places. Main contenders were gas stations on backroads, and bridges that divide the roads in half (which requires travelling in both directions).  Had fun travelling in my Iveco Stralis Hi-Way. Thinking about installing ProMods or TSM next."

EuroTruck2,2y1rst,metal_fever,8,Thu Mar 5 19:22:38 2015 UTC,"Also do not forget gas stations, the ones far away from the road need to be driven through separately and are easily hidden at the map.  I play with Promods & Rusmap, I know I will never reach 90% :'D"

I've got this Pathfinder left, and 3 others: Profit hunter, Working with the elite, Aspects of professionalism.

Set in the modern-day Shibuya shopping district of Tokyo, The World Ends with You features a distinctive art style inspired by Shibuya and its youth culture. Development was inspired by elements of Jupiter's previous game, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories. It was released in Japan in July 2007, and in PAL regions and North America on April 22, 2008. An enhanced version for iOS devices, titled The World Ends With You -Solo Remix-, was released in August 2012 (though later pulled due to incompatibility with iOS 8) and for Android devices in June 2014. A social network spin-off game titled The World Ends With You -Live Remix- was released in May 2013 for Japan's Android and iOS Stores developed by Square Enix in collaboration with GREE. The spinoff was shut down in February 2014 due to a lack of increasing interest.

Because game itself renders every truck on your PC as you were in it, it is slightly demanding. With my GTX770 if you are within 20-30 people in 1 chunk, your FPS shouldnt fell below 30 FPS with medium render distance in mirrors. of course mods from SP will, apart from few exceptions, not work in MP due to compatibility issues."

EuroTruck2,2vjel7,dngrs,5,Wed Feb 11 14:39:24 2015 UTC,"4x2 = 4 wheels, 2 drive wheels. Usually the biggest gas tanks, least stable. 6x2 = 6 wheels, 2 drive wheels. More stable than 4x2  . 6x2/4 = 6 wheels, 2 drive wheels. Front two sets of wheels are steerable. 6x2 Taglift = 6 wheels, 2 of which are drive wheels, the rear set is liftable and provides an additional set of steering wheels when down (tighter turning). 6x2/4 Midlift = 6 wheels, 2 drive wheels. Front two sets of wheels are steerable and one can be lifted. 6x4 = 6 wheels, 4 of which are drive wheels.

EuroTruck2,2vjel7,LetsGetMotarded,3,Wed Feb 11 14:49:33 2015 UTC,is there a way to raise noise inside the cabin? it's weird that the engine can barely be heard when driving
EuroTruck2,2vjel7,billbertking1,1 point,Wed Feb 11 16:22:35 2015 UTC,ProMods has an option when downloading. I'd link but on mobile.
EuroTruck2,2vjel7,LetsGetMotarded,2,Thu Feb 12 02:51:45 2015 UTC,which chassis is better to use?  currently have 6x2_4+Low
EuroTruck2,2vjel7,LetsGetMotarded,1 point,Wed Feb 11 15:01:57 2015 UTC,I prefer 6x4 for the stability it provides.  I use the Scania T (mod) which means I can have a 6x4 and still have 1000L+ gas tanks.
EuroTruck2,2vjel7,magnimoth,1 point,Wed Feb 11 16:05:44 2015 UTC,I think I have it too but a scania mod also for more customising options. I think I can buy even 8 wheels chassis.
EuroTruck2,2vjel7,LetsGetMotarded,1 point,Wed Feb 11 16:09:42 2015 UTC,Yep!  That's the one.  I found that the longest chassis was a bit unwieldy as far as turning.  I went with the second longest one in a 6x4 config and it worked well.   Very stable at high speeds.
EuroTruck2,2vjel7,LetsGetMotarded,0,Wed Feb 11 17:46:37 2015 UTC,"It really depends on what you want to do with the truck.  More drive wheels=more pulling power. More wheels on the ground=more traction.  4x2 is great for lighter loads over long distances.  6x2 is great for medium loads (more traction due to more tires, but less fuel)  6x2/4 taglift is variable; Can be used as 4x2 and the rear wheels can be lowered for a tighter turning radius.  6x2/4 midlift is same as above, but is more stable with the wheels up with reduced increase in tight turning (so a less extreme  taglift, basically).  6x4 is fantastic for super heavy loads (more traction and pulling power), but reduced range and much higher cost."
EuroTruck2,2viavd,btd19m,3,Wed Feb 11 05:37:58 2015 UTC,sorry all ive been working 12 hour shifts last few days. im wondering what are the best ways for example to pay for trucks and such......im using a friends save at the moment (lol who knows how you get 33million and over 100 trucks with no drivers)  i do have my noob truck but to be honest having all the dlcs makes it a little hard i have so many extra trailers and larger ones as well that i have issues towing (might post a video later) things like the High Power Cargo Pack dlc items they get caught everywhere.........i end up having to back up and go ahead and damage my truck to get the hell out of there. and i keep getting the truck bogged with anything over 10 tons (if i go of the motorway for a second my wheels just start spinning and i cant get out of it with my rookie truck unless i do an f7+enter or dump the load there  and last the stalling anywhere over 10% damage it just wont do cruse control it just stalls over and over and over and i get screwed over so bad.  im using the latest version (i think) i bought my copy and all my dlcs on steam at full price (was working during the sales last time)  i love the game and its a ton of fun....  by the way does anyone know of an active sp teamspeak? :)
EuroTruck2,2viavd,voobster,2,Sat Feb 14 14:00:48 2015 UTC,ask away I'll try to answer

There's also /r/trucksim which has a few more subscribers and a bit more activity than /r/eurotruck2, might be an idea to subscribe to both."
EuroTruck2,2vhmzx,prettyold,9,Wed Feb 11 02:11:24 2015 UTC,"I prefer the steam version because you get automatic updates, achievements and it goes on sale more often."
EuroTruck2,2vhmzx,dh98vmm,0,Wed Feb 11 02:35:40 2015 UTC,"Automatic updates are annoying though if you intend to mod the game. You used to be able to turn off automatic updating for each game, but valve recently removed that for some reason."
EuroTruck2,2vhmzx,Narsuaq,6,Wed Feb 11 08:20:53 2015 UTC,If you select your game as a Beta it doesn't update.
EuroTruck2,2vhmzx,pomodois,3,Wed Feb 11 11:17:18 2015 UTC,That's quite a good tip there. Much appreciated. :)
EuroTruck2,2vhmzx,Narsuaq,2,Wed Feb 11 15:11:53 2015 UTC,You're welcome ;)
EuroTruck2,2vhmzx,pomodois,6,Wed Feb 11 15:23:02 2015 UTC,Steam version without a doubt.
EuroTruck2,2vhmzx,Jamdude,5,Wed Feb 11 10:38:45 2015 UTC,"Steam just because it'll be cheaper soon, as in within six months for the summer sale (might go on sale for cheaper through a bundle site or off-brand key seller)."
EuroTruck2,2vhmzx,MMAPhreak21,2,Wed Feb 11 13:41:20 2015 UTC,"I would say get the Steam copy. It's a bit cheaper on the Humble store right now though during sales it goes VERY cheap, so honestly I would say to wait if you can."
EuroTruck2,2vdzaz,nomroMehTeoJ,10,Tue Feb 10 05:19:05 2015 UTC,"Different brands and models have different performance and handling characteristics, and different upgrades available"
EuroTruck2,2vdzaz,babies-overnight,6,Tue Feb 10 05:44:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, the trucks have different engines and drive trains available as well as different handling characteristics, mirror and window visibility, interior decor, sounds."
EuroTruck2,2vdzaz,mrcandyman,2,Tue Feb 10 12:06:19 2015 UTC,"If you use mouse and keyboard to steer, you will notice each truck handles differently. The Volvo(old one) is shit at braking compaired to others, the old Scania tends to flip over easily, the new Daf has a delay in steering which makes it not pleasant to drive at all and so on."
EuroTruck2,2vdzaz,Spuddy0108,1 point,Tue Feb 10 17:35:32 2015 UTC,can confirm that the scania flips easily. Done it several times in my more careless moments.
EuroTruck2,2vdzaz,duzra,1 point,Tue Feb 10 18:45:30 2015 UTC,"I used the Man for about 30,000km and flipped heaps of times, have currently done about 15,000km in a Scania R and have flipped once, maybe I've just gotten better"
EuroTruck2,2vdzaz,babies-overnight,1 point,Wed Feb 11 09:50:38 2015 UTC,Can't say I've noticed anything with the steering on the DAFs. Driven both the XF and Euro 6 and they seem fine!?
EuroTruck2,2vdzaz,jamiemulcahy,2,Tue Feb 10 18:57:02 2015 UTC,It depends on what you're used to. There is no actual bad or good truck in the game. It all comes down to personal opinion.
EuroTruck2,2vdzaz,Darkfizch,3,Wed Feb 11 12:40:30 2015 UTC,"That's a great way to put it.  One may insist on a certain brand of truck being better (due to the high horsepower), but I personally like trucks between the 500->650 hp. It makes the freight slightly more realistic, and we're not (supposed to be) racing down freeways at 150km/h anyways."
EuroTruck2,2vdzaz,IndigenousOres,1 point,Thu Feb 12 17:00:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with you; the Volvo FH16 Classic is terrible at braking.  I'm still driving it though, the dashboard display is easily readable and the mirrors are a little better than the new Volvo FH16.  I like to think the dash makes up for that, sometimes."
EuroTruck2,2vcwi5,joshj5hawk,2,Mon Feb 9 23:49:21 2015 UTC,ets2downloads is good and I also get some from ets2mods
EuroTruck2,2vcwi5,Bromli,1 point,Tue Feb 10 01:10:02 2015 UTC,I use www.ets2.lt and the SCS forums
EuroTruck2,2vcwi5,TexasTango,1 point,Tue Feb 10 15:35:03 2015 UTC,"I mainly play with the TSM and related mods, so it's trucksim-map.com 's download section as well as the SCS forums for me. One advantage of sticking with one site is that almost everything is for the same base patch version, so I don't need to worry that much about outdated mods this way."
EuroTruck2,2vanik,dngrs,4,Mon Feb 9 13:01:18 2015 UTC,"Fir me, the strategy ended up literally being mass garages = money = good.   Buy them when you can, keep them with a couple cities I between,  then once you hit 5 or so it doesn't really matter, you make enough money. Eventually, you get about a million dollars every time you sleep, and can't buy garages and max them out with 200000 dollar trucks fast enough"
EuroTruck2,2vanik,moonmoon0100,1 point,Mon Feb 9 22:51:32 2015 UTC,"Started buying garages located in capital cities, ended up just buying 'em all. Whenever you do a medium/long delivery, you have the option to rest 3 times anyways.  That boosted my money the most, prior I used to sleep once and get back on the road right away. Altogether, your hired drivers will eventually make more during a certain period of time (talking about realtime, not gametime) than the player."
EuroTruck2,2vanik,IndigenousOres,3,Thu Feb 12 17:07:03 2015 UTC,"Buy every garage you drive past, after 5 or so you wont be able to get rid of money faster than it comes in."
EuroTruck2,2vanik,TheFunnyShotgun,2,Tue Feb 10 05:00:46 2015 UTC,after 5 or so you wont be able to get rid of money faster than it comes in.   is that a challenge? :))
EuroTruck2,2vanik,billbertking1,2,Wed Feb 11 17:14:25 2015 UTC,Garages to me are like Pokemon. Collect them all!
EuroTruck2,2v7m4q,Fiffiboi,6,Sun Feb 8 18:15:38 2015 UTC,"ETS2 Essential mod is, well.. essential. Mostly bugfixes, but they're really great.  Pretty much all of Jazzycat's packs. They add a whole bunch of cars, trucks, and trailers to the game, it's awesome. If you find the increased traffic slows down your computer you can use Traffic Density Mod to lower traffic density. I find 30x10 works well.  Trailer Attach Sound is a very minor change but it is really satisfying every time you hear that sound.  True AI Lights is nice because it allows you to actually see AI car headlights, in the base game they were way too dim/only extended out about a foot. Now you can actually see them coming down the road without always having your high-beams on.  I'm currently running with ProMods mappack, and it's great, it adds a ton of new cities in several different countries. It's pretty quality work too, most time I can't tell whether it's a promods city or a vanilla game city. For promods you have to sign up on their website and download it from there. Haven't tried TSM, but when I was first looking at different mappacks, I heard that TSM is quantity whereas Promods is quality, so I went with promods. Not saying TSM is bad, I haven't tried it so I can't say, but I love the quality of promods. Also they are not compatible with each other.   There's a whole bunch of truck mods out there too, some better than others, I'm currently playing around with several to see which are good, I've found the Peterbilt 379/389 are both good if you like American trucks. The Scania T is a nice long-nose European truck."
EuroTruck2,2v7m4q,zeniiz,1 point,Mon Feb 9 02:41:32 2015 UTC,is there a version of the trailer sound mod for 1.16? or for the peterbilts
EuroTruck2,2v7m4q,dngrs,1 point,Mon Feb 9 12:56:00 2015 UTC,That trailer sound mod works in 1.16 and it works for all trucks.
EuroTruck2,2v7m4q,zeniiz,1 point,Mon Feb 9 15:09:37 2015 UTC,"Also I got a chance to drive some different trucks. The two I can recommend right now are the Volvo FH 2013 and the Volvo VNL 780. Both of them are pretty stable, good quality work. Lots of customization options.   I've also driven the Kenworth K100, which is a nice truck, one problem I noticed though, is that it seems the brightness is unnaturally high when you're in first person view (as you might be able to see here and here). It might just be a conflict with one of my other mods though. Like I said, aside from the minor problem, its a great truck.  The Kenworth T800 is also a really nice truck, although if I were to nitpick again, the sound bothers me a little. It makes a high pitched mosquito like whine when it switches gears, now that I think of it the K100 does the same. Not such a big deal once you're on the open road but when you get to a city and you hear it over and over...Then again, it might not bother you, so it's worth trying out."
EuroTruck2,2v7m4q,zeniiz,1 point,Wed Feb 11 02:12:46 2015 UTC,"Ive been wondering how important mods are. In an elder scrolls game, modding is a very important late game aspect. How important is it?"
EuroTruck2,2v7m4q,orge121,1 point,Sun Feb 8 20:56:34 2015 UTC,"ETS2 Vanilla is already a lot of fun, even more so if you have the Going East expansion DLC.  I can imagine ProMods & TSM would be nice (but not necessary) once you're bored. I'm approx.100 hours into the vanilla game currently and still haven't discovered every part of the map yet, though. Around 75-80%.  There are truck & trailer mods, so you can drive american 18-wheeler's or different models. You can challenge yourself with extra heavy loads or even double's (road train).  Mods aren't as necessary as Skyrim (for example), but they can add to the gameplay. There's a lot of stuff you can mess around with to keep the game fresh.  I'd definitely recommend the ""ETS2 Multiplayer Mod"" for driving in groups/convoys with friends or w/e. It adds a nice little ""social aspect"" to the game."
EuroTruck2,2v7m4q,IndigenousOres,1 point,Sun Feb 8 23:16:24 2015 UTC,"This.  Mods are almost a necessity in Skyrim but ETS2 is (in my mind) better in vanilla.  I've tried a fair few mods including graphical enhancements but none really add anything meaningful.    One I would probably add, just for realism, is the real companies. This just replaces the companies you work for with real businesses.  http://ets2downloads.com/misc/real-company"
