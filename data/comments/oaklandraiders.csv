oaklandraiders,3e3gr4,ap0calypse702,10,Tue Jul 21 17:45:14 2015 UTC,"I agree, now that we have Crabtree, Cooper and Streater healthy we will win more games that anybody had anticipated."
oaklandraiders,3e3gr4,priestofdisorder,13,Tue Jul 21 18:51:08 2015 UTC,"I also think we're in way better shape now that McFadden and MJD aren't here. They just were not doing us any favors in the run game. Maybe Murray had a fluke game against KC or something but people at least have to respect him for a few games until we see how he does as the feature back. We've also got more than a couple upgrades on the defense, and Khalil Mack has had a proper offseason to refine his skill set. All the new weapons at WR, plus the handful of pieces we've added to our defense should certainly met us at least a few more wins this year."
oaklandraiders,3e3gr4,redelic,10,Tue Jul 21 18:57:16 2015 UTC,"MJD and DMC were beyond horrible, at one point i was really thinking we could go 0-16"
oaklandraiders,3e3gr4,priestofdisorder,11,Tue Jul 21 19:07:15 2015 UTC,0-16 was very much going to happen if we didnt fire DA. Like it was one of the most sure things in our last 10 years.
oaklandraiders,3e3gr4,Passion4Flashin,10,Tue Jul 21 19:17:29 2015 UTC,"I got mad as fuck and decided to take a nap after watching Carr hurt and nobody helping, holy fuck, that was a dumpster."
oaklandraiders,3e3gr4,priestofdisorder,12,Tue Jul 21 19:18:59 2015 UTC,"Everytime someone tries to say Carr did terribly last year i tell them to watch the Dolphins game and see if you can still blame Carr. After that game is when we actually started forming a team. That interview with Carr he said something like ""at the end of the season we started winning games against good teams and we looked at those games and the games before and we said 'wow we can actually be really good'"". We actually got a team boys!!"
oaklandraiders,3e3gr4,Passion4Flashin,7,Tue Jul 21 19:27:03 2015 UTC,"i remember week 1 vs NYJ...i was so excited! then we hand off the ball to mjd, then dmc, then mjd........ it seemed like 1-2 yard gains all game....and it NEVER GOT BETTER ALL SEASON :("

oaklandraiders,3e3gr4,chuckdiesel86,3,Tue Jul 21 23:34:17 2015 UTC,"I totally forgot about that. When it happened, I just slammed my laptop closed and walked away. I couldn't believe everyone was just watching him struggle. That still pisses me off!"
oaklandraiders,3e3gr4,belgiumania,0,Tue Jul 21 21:52:16 2015 UTC,"What? C'mon... DA was a fall guy. Nothing changed after his departure. All the same coaches, same play books, strategies, etc. You really can't change much half way through a season. People seem to think a Head Coach does EVERYTHING. It ain't Madden."
oaklandraiders,3e3gr4,Passion4Flashin,2,Wed Jul 22 02:26:49 2015 UTC,What? You cant watch games after he left and say we didnt play better as a team
oaklandraiders,3e3gr4,cliff_em_all,4,Wed Jul 22 02:55:03 2015 UTC,If only we had MJD in his prime
oaklandraiders,3e3gr4,Keyser_Brozay,3,Tue Jul 21 21:55:00 2015 UTC,"The one thing I can't get believe is just how much we've upgraded our team at so many positions. I think this will be a year of great individual performances, most notably Mack, Carr and Cooper, and then the next year is when the team will start to gel and play really well together"
oaklandraiders,3e3gr4,metaxa219,2,Tue Jul 21 19:36:55 2015 UTC,"Even if you don't count Murray's 90-yarder vs. KC, he averaged 4.4 YPC in 2014. That's pretty damn good. Just have to hope he stays healthy."
oaklandraiders,3e3gr4,metaxa219,5,Wed Jul 22 01:19:57 2015 UTC,"It's interesting that Carr ""tied"" Cutler in the poll because they both have infinite arm talent. Similar players, except that Cutler hasn't progressed and Carr has plenty of time to clean up his flaws."

oaklandraiders,3e3gr4,eyememine,6,Tue Jul 21 20:10:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I take very few media guys seriously because they are not football guys. Now Daniel Jeremiah, Charles Davis, and Charlie Casserly are legit, they worked in NFL front offices as scouts and Casserly was a GM (who drafted David Carr actually). Those guys say Carr is legit, as do a lot of other ""football guys"". I'm gonna take their word for it over football writers."
oaklandraiders,3e3gr4,Passion4Flashin,4,Tue Jul 21 21:20:42 2015 UTC,"These are guys actually employed by teams for this kind of info. And vikings fans are trippin that DC is ranked higher lol. ""I stopped reading when they said teddy lagged behind Carr"""
oaklandraiders,3e3gr4,ClutchRaider,10,Tue Jul 21 20:31:09 2015 UTC,"Lol those Viking fans are hilarious.  They will never admit that despite Teddy having a very poor supporting cast, we had an even WORSE one around Carr.  Not taking anything away from Bridgewater, that's just what it is but oh well."
oaklandraiders,3e3gr4,priestofdisorder,4,Tue Jul 21 20:48:09 2015 UTC,"I have a 50 dollars bet in that game, i hope we are right."
oaklandraiders,3e3gr4,Passion4Flashin,7,Tue Jul 21 20:50:01 2015 UTC,"50 well spent even if we lose man. Its gonna be a great game. Teddy is a shit ton of fun to watch. Idk why they are so adamant about Derek Carr being so horrible because YPA BRAHHHHH. Suck my dick with that stat. I got a shit load of cherry picked stats that makes Carr look like the next Peyton Manning. Im pumped to watch Teddy have a great career, but lets not act like when it comes to being a QB he's got anything on DC. Carr is what everyone wants in a franchise qb."
oaklandraiders,3e3gr4,chuckdiesel86,6,Tue Jul 21 21:21:08 2015 UTC,"The fact is, Carr has way more stats pointing to him being good than there are that point to him being bad. That stupid YPA stat is the only one that's negative. He also threw as many times as a seasoned vet in his rookie year and only threw 11 INTs."
oaklandraiders,3e3gr4,Passion4Flashin,6,Tue Jul 21 21:56:08 2015 UTC,"Fact. Idk how you can knock a rookie that threw 3,200 yards 21 TD's and 12 int's. I see 4k this year 25-28 TD's 12-14 Int's"
oaklandraiders,3e3gr4,Sirscraps,4,Tue Jul 21 22:13:48 2015 UTC,In going with 3800YDS 28TDS and 10INTS  personally
oaklandraiders,3e3y9c,jessief2,7,Tue Jul 21 19:43:57 2015 UTC,"I know someone says this EVERY year but man... this year really feels different. Since when have we got a QB that we believe in since Carr? I mean damn, last year Schaub was still the starter around this time.  That and the fact we actually drafted him some weapons this year. Can't wait for the season to start."
oaklandraiders,3e3y9c,vinda0n,8,Tue Jul 21 20:21:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly the fact that Mckenzie didn't just stack the defense and leave Carr to fend for himself is huge to me. He went out and picked up a ton of talent because he wants Carr to succeed. He's the first quarterback the new regime has had faith in, that's huge."
oaklandraiders,3e3y9c,Sirscraps,6,Tue Jul 21 20:52:20 2015 UTC,"This is what I saw, too. We could have drafted Williams and been sick on D, but our D was actually solid last year. It was the offenses inability to stay on the field that tired out the D and made them look bad. If we can keep those guys rested, I don't see any team scoring more than 21-24 points on us next season."
oaklandraiders,3e3y9c,chuckdiesel86,4,Tue Jul 21 21:11:08 2015 UTC,our D was solid last year.   Lets not get too carried away now
oaklandraiders,3e3y9c,ItsMajorObviousNow,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:19:23 2015 UTC,"Solid just means they held their own, and don't forget that our D kept both SB teams to within one score. That's the stuff that's makes me excited for next year, we have more weapons, and real, NFL caliber coaches."
oaklandraiders,3e3y9c,chuckdiesel86,5,Wed Jul 22 01:36:15 2015 UTC,"I love how they open with that bullshit YPA stat lol. The rest of it is literally what Raiders' fans have been saying, he can ball but he had a shit supporting class last season."
oaklandraiders,3e3y9c,BadAtUsernames0,3,Tue Jul 21 20:02:34 2015 UTC,It's a totally legit point as long as it's put into context of who he was throwing to and the absence of the run game.

I've gone to many sports games, and raiders games aren't worse in any way in my experience. My worst experience as a sports fan was at Mile High Stadium when a group of Broncos fans started yelling at me and my friends to go back to the bay with the rest of the faggots after we lost by multiple touchdowns.   So tired of our bad reputation. Our team hasn't won more than 8 games in a decade, we just want to win"

oaklandraiders,3e2nox,Keyser_Brozay,7,Tue Jul 21 16:29:28 2015 UTC,Seems like the article was more about criticizing L.A. fans than they were RAIDER fans. Let's not forget that it wasn't all that long ago when Brian Stow was beaten outside Dodger Stadium. Let's put the bad fan reputation where it belongs.
oaklandraiders,3e2nox,designOraptor,8,Tue Jul 21 16:49:22 2015 UTC,I'm from LA and this is the truth. So many dumbasses down there that make Raider fans and Dodger fans and Laker fans look like pieces of shit. I bet those guys that almost murdered Brian Stow weren't even at any games the next year. Terrible fans.
oaklandraiders,3e2nox,Keyser_Brozay,6,Tue Jul 21 17:18:31 2015 UTC,"Listen to yourselves, guys. You're putting the weight of one freak murder on the shoulders of a whole city.  That's horse shit. I've lived in LA my whole life. Cities are no different from each other; They'll always have the same kind of people that make stupid decisions like the decisions Stow's murderer made.  To put the blame of a murder on the ""assumed mentality"" of an entire fan base is just rude and wrongly biased. LA sports fans are just like any other sports teams' fans (albeit a higher % of Hispanics, myself included), but unless you're Donald Trump or a white supremacist that shouldn't make a difference to you."

oaklandraiders,3e19kk,bobbyfish,6,Tue Jul 21 18:20:37 2015 UTC,Where does Smith go if they bring in Gresham? Its a waste of valuable cap space that we may need at somepoint during the season.

oaklandraiders,3e19kk,tmello56,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:41:21 2015 UTC,I'm more concerned with the extra roster spot that he'd take up. We'd either carry 4 TEs and lose a potential bubble guy (Lumpkin pls) or cut Rivera/Smith. No thanks
oaklandraiders,3e19kk,EHsE,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:22:26 2015 UTC,"We still have Leonhardt that we could let go, too. If we got Gresham we would have him and Rivera for passing downs and Lee for rushing downs. I think it would be a good idea, as long as he looks good at his physical."
oaklandraiders,3e19kk,chuckdiesel86,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:32:23 2015 UTC,Honestly I pegged Leonhardt for a cut/practice squad guy anyway. Walford/Rivera or Smith seems like a perfectly fine combo

oaklandraiders,3e19kk,chuckdiesel86,5,Tue Jul 21 19:31:53 2015 UTC,Honestly I think the TE is hella crowded. Lol  But I guess you keep bringing em in till you finally strike gold.
oaklandraiders,3e19kk,Kaner222,7,Tue Jul 21 05:12:17 2015 UTC,Walford/Gresham would be a hell of TE combo though.
oaklandraiders,3e19kk,Blahblag12321,11,Tue Jul 21 05:32:39 2015 UTC,I think walford/rivera will be better for longer
oaklandraiders,3e19kk,Passion4Flashin,8,Tue Jul 21 07:19:10 2015 UTC,"Rivera is not a special player, he looked special because of the utter lack of talent at his position and even more so around him. He was good for us, but I think we're about to find out what having a starting caliber TE is like"
oaklandraiders,3e19kk,Keyser_Brozay,5,Tue Jul 21 13:38:36 2015 UTC,"Oh i totally agree man. I dont think Rivera is a huge game changer. But with Walfor being a solid #1 TE, i think Rivera isnt going to have the opportunity to make as many mistakes. He'll be a good #2 TE for us"
oaklandraiders,3e19kk,Passion4Flashin,3,Tue Jul 21 15:59:10 2015 UTC,"That's fair, I agree he's a good change of pace option if we want to go that way. I have a feeling we'll be doubling up the TE's some this year"

oaklandraiders,3e19kk,Passion4Flashin,2,Tue Jul 21 15:59:53 2015 UTC,If he's one dimensional he doesn't have to worry about being on the field when there is quality depth.
oaklandraiders,3e19kk,TLoD_MAB,3,Tue Jul 21 16:13:33 2015 UTC,Who's our quality depth? Hes our second best receiving option for our TE's. Apparently Lee is horrible at receiving
oaklandraiders,3e19kk,Passion4Flashin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:17:24 2015 UTC,If we were to get Gresham I doubt Rivera would see the field often except in pass only situations which is still doubtful.

oaklandraiders,3e19kk,Passion4Flashin,2,Tue Jul 21 17:12:39 2015 UTC,Gresham is only 27. He's not super young but he could easily be around for 5 years.
oaklandraiders,3e19kk,chuckdiesel86,2,Tue Jul 21 18:33:55 2015 UTC,Oh wow thats crazy. I really thought he was pushing 30.
oaklandraiders,3e19kk,Passion4Flashin,2,Tue Jul 21 19:24:20 2015 UTC,"I honestly thought the same thing until very recently. I feel like Gresham has been playing TE for the Bengals since I've been alive, but he's actually one year younger than me lol."
oaklandraiders,3e19kk,chuckdiesel86,2,Tue Jul 21 19:28:27 2015 UTC,Thats whats throwing me off. I feel like he's the only TE i grew up knowing on the Bengals lol. I guess the years just mesh together nowadays
oaklandraiders,3e19kk,Passion4Flashin,2,Tue Jul 21 19:31:05 2015 UTC,"I just looked at his bio, it says he was drafted in 2010! He was 6'5"", 261 lbs, and ran a 4.66, 40 at the draft combine. It looks like he has 9.7 YPC for his career, Rivera has 9.8, and Gronkowski is around 14 YPC for comparison."
oaklandraiders,3e19kk,chuckdiesel86,2,Tue Jul 21 19:42:51 2015 UTC,More competition at a position of need?? Why not?

In my opinion a one year, 'prove it' contract would be perfectly acceptable. If he gets injured, has attitude issues, off the field, etc. We walk away from him. The upside could be huge.   Also, I'm surprised to see so many people pulling for Rivera. To me the kid seems mediocre at best."

oaklandraiders,3dzpjm,_masterofdisaster,4,Tue Jul 21 02:07:28 2015 UTC,So... I thought it was funny and thought I'd share.
oaklandraiders,3dz2kt,facetiously,11,Mon Jul 20 18:18:54 2015 UTC,Sucks Cooper couldnt make it but at least it shows crabtree is committed.
oaklandraiders,3dz2kt,Vryk0lakas,7,Mon Jul 20 18:21:59 2015 UTC,"I think Crabtree realizes he's fighting for a starting job and if he doesn't give 110%, Andre Holmes probably will."
oaklandraiders,3dz2kt,chuckdiesel86,8,Mon Jul 20 18:28:05 2015 UTC,Honestly if Crabtree puts in 80% he'll beat out Andre Holmes. It's Rod Streater he has to worry about.
oaklandraiders,3dz2kt,Electric_Pegasus,6,Mon Jul 20 20:42:29 2015 UTC,kind of a bummer for holmes i really like that dude. He just doesn't have it all like cooper and crabtree.
oaklandraiders,3dz2kt,wokus,2,Mon Jul 20 21:02:03 2015 UTC,"No way Crabtree isn't our #2 WR going into the season. I'm actually really glad he showed up to this, shows he's going above and beyond to contribute this year.  Also, not worried about Coop missing this, he already had a private workout with Carr and rookies report early to training camp so is probably getting ready for that."
oaklandraiders,3dz2kt,VegasRon,3,Tue Jul 21 02:03:35 2015 UTC,Sleeping on Streater. I think he's the #2 man if it works out. Word is he looked great at the mini camps and with Cooper taking some defensive attention away... I'm looking for big things from Rod.
oaklandraiders,3dz2kt,Edmuresay,4,Tue Jul 21 04:01:11 2015 UTC,"Michael Crabtree, Mychal Rivera, Brice Butler, Rod Streater, Seth Roberts, Josh Harper, Kenbrell Thompkins and Andre Holmes caught passes from Carr and some from his older brother David in the San Joaquin Valley.

oaklandraiders,3dz2kt,trollfactory,4,Mon Jul 20 23:13:03 2015 UTC,"Well Campbell low key did it with his wr's and Gradkowski always took the o line to eat at his moms house, maybe cause his family member is a lineman too, and trying to give him tips. Idk."
oaklandraiders,3dz2kt,Kaner222,3,Tue Jul 21 04:58:09 2015 UTC,"I agree, especially since it was at his family's private facilities. I think it says a lot that he did this because of the time that he missed. Carr's work ethic and commitment have really impressed me. When Schaub left I truly  thought, great, time for us to break another rookie QB. He has exceeded my expectations so far in looking forward to seeing how dialed in he is this season."
oaklandraiders,3dz2kt,TheSpiritsGotMe,3,Tue Jul 21 03:05:27 2015 UTC,It helps to own a freaking training facility.  That worked out nicely.  I'll go out on a limb and say that most second-year quarterbacks don't have that going for them.
oaklandraiders,3dz2kt,vinda0n,2,Tue Jul 21 13:19:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed, seems like we finally have a leader for the most important position. Hope Carr is our guy for years to come."

oaklandraiders,3dztc8,simonpheenicks,21,Mon Jul 20 21:28:02 2015 UTC,"Said he liked the draft picks but thinks Mack and Cooper were no-brainers   He's done some good things, done some bad things. Arguments that use hindsight like this dont do anything to show whether or not he's done a good job or not, it just shows a refusal to give credit where credit is due. I mean, I look at those picks and say   ""Good job, Reggie!""   while your friend looks at the picks and says   ""Reggie was lucky"".  It's all perspective. IMO RM's tenure is much more than hits and misses at the draft. He has done a great job bringing the team out from under the financial mess, changing the culture, modernizing facilities, scouting, etc. I dont think that people really understand how far behind the Raiders were before he got there. Free agents were using our cap space as leverage to get what they wanted from their agents as soon as FA period began, even that dumb oaf Greg Hardy tried to get a rumour out that the Raiders were interested to get his offers up. You're never going to fix all the teams problems through FA but if you're friend is telling you that our team is not improved after getting guys like Dan Williams and Rodney Hudson then he needs to give his head a shake.   I look at the condition of this team as a whole and from top to bottom, we're headed in the right direction. Our future is brighter than it has been in years and whether the haters like it or not, RM deserves a lot of the credit for that.   (I would like to remind everyone that this is solely my opinion and I am not in anyway personally attacking those that disagree)"
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,malak33,33,Mon Jul 20 22:23:12 2015 UTC,He's entitled to his opinion. I think he's wrong. Green bay is best run organization in football from top to bottom. Reggie came from there. I'll trust in him. He has made mistakes. So have I. We will be great for years with him. Just my 2¢
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,CoxyMcChunk,4,Mon Jul 20 22:13:24 2015 UTC,Aye!
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,Black_Mack_52,6,Tue Jul 21 00:14:40 2015 UTC,"To say that he just ""came from there"" doesn't do it enough justice.   McKenzie was employed by the Green Bay Packers from 1994 to 2012. He began as a scout, and gradually rose through the ranks to become the Packers' director of player personnel and eventually the team's director of football operations, while reporting to general managers Ron Wolf and Ted Thompson.       That's 18 mothereffing years with the Packers learning that system. Not to mention he was interviewed by both Ron Wolf and John Madden for the gig.   In Reggie we trust."
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,lupe_is_tight,7,Tue Jul 21 05:07:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly Green Bay hardly ever participates on free agency, besides keeping their own talent. So I'm not surprised he has missed. But none of his free agents have hurt our future with massive contracts."
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,CalmYourTits_,2,Tue Jul 21 03:21:26 2015 UTC,"This is a great point actually.  Their biggest name free agents I can recall were Julius Peppers, Jeff Saturday, and Charles Woodson.  And Peppers and Saturday were both at the end of their careers, yet still playing well....a common theme we see with our signings."
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,Donkeydongcuntry,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:00:21 2015 UTC,"This. IIRC, this past season the entire Packers roster only had two players that weren't veterans. Building a winning franchise with staying power out of the situation RM inherited is a long, arduous process that can't be solved by FA. A team must be built from the ground up and allowed to develop chemistry. My father only recently began to stop calling for RM's head and now follows the one true faith alongside myself. Having a revolving door at both head coach and QB was not working for us. We now have some critical positions filled and I am dying to see the pain The Nation brings next season. Go Raiders."
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,kootenaicooter,4,Wed Jul 22 02:06:08 2015 UTC,"I think Reggie has taken the long term approach to improving the team since day one. That usually doesn't translate to winning football games quickly. To use a euphemism, we've been on a ""suck for Luck"" rollercoaster the last 3 years. None of his moves were meant to rapidly improve the product on the field. Look at the Mack pick. The difference between getting Mack opposed to a guy like Jake Matthews was one pick. The Carr pick was an absolute stroke of   luck on our part due to Houston's stigma over his brother's selection. Winning 2 or 3 games two years ago would not have been beneficial to the rebuild. Hell, look at this past season. What competent individual would start a backfield of MJD and McFadden.  Two washed up guys with no upside. Clearly, we were still in the suck to win mode of business at that point."
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,GlassCleaner,10,Tue Jul 21 05:31:31 2015 UTC,if they were such no brainers they would of both gone first overall
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,AusRaidersFan,12,Mon Jul 20 23:03:45 2015 UTC,Exactly! I hate the argument that Carr was also a no brainer. If it's was so obvious then why did 32 teams pass on him (some twice - the texans really fucked up there given their qb situation last year and this year)?
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,Moneyshott,2,Mon Jul 20 23:40:05 2015 UTC,well when they were looking at taking carr at 5 and he was still on the board at 36 yea that would be a nobrainer
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,GlassCleaner,-1,Tue Jul 21 04:29:54 2015 UTC,haters gonna hate.
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,Moneyshott,-2,Tue Jul 21 02:37:23 2015 UTC,dumb. carr and mack were both the bpa at the time of the pick that filled huge team needs.
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,vinda0n,3,Tue Jul 21 04:38:26 2015 UTC,"Reggie is the fucking shit.   Sure Mack was a no brainer last year but that's not all he got. Derek Carr, Gabe Jackson, Justin Ellis, TJ Carrie... all starters, maybe Keith McGill too.  This year... guess we'll see if Cooper over Williams was correct. Personally I think it was, and this is coming from a guy that originally wanted Williams pretty badly."
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,ANDRADE101,5,Tue Jul 21 13:25:09 2015 UTC,"RM cleaned house which took a while but it needed to be done, so of course they weren't going to look good on the field. Fact, we only won 3 games last season but we were also a lot more competitive than we've been in recent years. I won't be surprised if they only win 6-7 games this season, but I expect to not be in the lower tier of each category and a lot more competitive. In other words, other teams won't be writing us off before they play us. I think that's a pretty realistic outlook on the situation overall, wouldn't you say so?"
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,Jose_xixpac,2,Mon Jul 20 23:19:10 2015 UTC,"R Mac is a Raider through and through... and once you go silva an black.  There's no taking it back.  Just wait, you'll see.  2015"
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,Kaner222,3,Tue Jul 21 11:47:11 2015 UTC,"The way I see it. All these ""terrible FA"" where stop gaps till he drafted his guy and to change to ""culture"" in the locker room. Sure they where bust but they all mostly came from winning teams. If you can't see the the wins on Sunday you can see the difference in the locker room culture. IMO. There's no Kelly and Routt players just playing for a check, they WANT to teach these rookies and set an example.    IMO Wolf is the big dog in Green Bay at scouting and I think Reggie was a scout the later round players. Cause if you look at his drafts ""after"" he brought his own scouts, Reggie has been hella good at picking those third day prospects."
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,deathleeehallows,2,Tue Jul 21 05:08:40 2015 UTC,"id give him a C+   he had his work cut out for him, came into a terrible situation where things like the carson palmer trade and other scholarship players brought down the team. solid draft picks in mack and carr and has shown that he can find gems in the later rounds like gabe jackson, carrie, streater, etc. brought a change to the culture and hopefully it pays off this year.  however, he's had some busty picks namely wilson and lets be honest dj hayden is borderline. hayden's performance this year will have a large influence on my overall opinion of reggies tenure...especially considering the guys we passed on to pick him up. with that being said, i know haydens had some freak injuries that shouldnt count against him. but part of being a successful first round pick is the ability to stay on the field and contribute right away."
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,billet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:32:35 2015 UTC,"After last season's offseason, it's not hard to find Raider fans who don't like McKenzie.  This subreddit is very pro-Reggie, but I participate on a few other forums and he's talked about like he's a complete idiot there, and they have a lot of good points.  The Reggie haters don't give him enough credit for the past few drafts.  He hit a grand slam last year, something I've never seen in my entire Raider fandom.  This year looks solid.  Love Cooper and Walford, not stoked on any others.    Every free agency he's lead has been pretty bad though.  He obviously didn't have much money to work with the first few years, but that was partly his choice by dismantling the team so rapidly.  The only reason I agreed with the quick dismantling before was because I thought it was going to be the fastest way to building back up.  I don't believe that anymore.  Last year's free agency period was downright atrocious.  He let our best young players walk, and only Tuck, Penn, and Woodson remain as solid contributors.  His prized signing Austin Howard was bad last year and might not even make the roster this year.  Not that Howard isn't worth a roster spot, but if he doesn't win the starting job then you don't pay a backup what he's getting.  I still want him around, but there are serious question marks concerning his ability to run a team."
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,Sirscraps,3,Tue Jul 21 03:33:33 2015 UTC,"Our best young players? Both veldheer and Houston were outperformed by the guys we got to replace them, them being younger only matters if we planned on keeping them for 4+ years more since we will have penn and tuck for probably three seasons each. we basically have two more years to replace them before it even becomes an issue, obviously you want to retain the players you've drafted but Houston was overrated and wasn't missed at all last season and from what we know veldheers agent messed up the contract negotiations. Howard is a tackle who was forced to play guard, something he hadn't done in the NFL as far as I know, now he's moving back to his original position RT. this roster has probably had a turnover rate of like 80% since Mckenzie came in, of course their are going to be hits and misses. But guys like penn, tuck, wheeler, Woodson, mcgloin(who I am only mentioning because this sub seems to be in love with him), streater, Holmes, porter, etc etc. have all played well for us. He's hit much more than he's missed. I'd say the only position that's even given him trouble in FA outside of QB Is cb and that's almost entirely due to injury. He's made some mistakes but most of them get blown way out of the water just so people have something to criticize. Also anyone that says a draft pick is a ""no-brainier"" should just be punched in the face."
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,TLoD_MAB,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:46:28 2015 UTC,"Houston's money went to Woodley which is my issue with that situation and was from the beginning, and I believe by years end JV edged out Penn I thought I remember reading on PFF.(If someone can post proof of that to either confirm or squash that, thatg'd be great). ""From what we know Veldheers agent messed up contract negotiations"" from what I heard is RM gave Howard more money than he offered JV. (Barring his stupid injury)Houston would have made it impossible to constantly run away from Mack for entire games like teams did this year, as a run defender he was top tier for a DE and NOBODY showed more hustle than him on the defense while he was here."
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,VegasRon,2,Tue Jul 21 16:08:50 2015 UTC,"And Houston ended up on IR with one sack last year while Woodley got cut and is off the books. Even that is a wash or actually a benefit for us because not only is it a question mark about Houston going forward, he just said a couple days ago that he's going to continue to celebrate by leaping in the air."

Houston doesn't get the sacks but he was top-10 in hurries and he was a great run-stuffer.  Veldheer was also a franchise LT and young.  But the bonus would've been showing loyalty, which I think matters alittle bit as a building franchise.  BUT, if it's true that they didn't infact want to be here, which was my believe this whole time, then fuck em.  We just don't know the truth behind the negotiations, but I entirely believe they both wanted to go."
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,Rdd21,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:42:35 2015 UTC,Mack was the only no brainer. Cooper definitely wasn't when Williams was still on the board. And we have been awful I mean absolutely awful at drafting over the last 10+ years so no I don't think even average gms make good draft picks. If this was the case most teams would be good at drafting and no team would stay bad.
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,mandingoBBC,-3,Tue Jul 21 10:42:21 2015 UTC,The Dennis Allen hire was horrible. So was the Matt Flynn and Matt Shaub and MJD signings. DJ Hayden is a bust. Tyler Wilson is a bust. This year is definitely make or break.

We could've easily busted out all the ammo and built an 8-8 team that would've beaten shitty teams and gotten creamed by good ones.  Sorta like our '10 and '11 teams. Those teams were maxed out, there was no where to go but horizontal or down.  You can't trade away every draft pick and spend every last dollar putting your team in cap hell and expect to continue getting better.

oaklandraiders,3dztc8,Moneyshott,-6,Wed Jul 22 01:48:11 2015 UTC,"dude you were talking to is 100% spot on. it took marks hiring of del rio to finally point the team in the right direction this offseason. mark already had to eat penis Allens contract (reggies hire btw) and couldnt afford to eat the rest of reggies contract too, so he let him stay on as del rios yes man. remember reggie wanted to keep sparano until mark had to remind him who cuts his check. future looking much brighter with del rio running the show."
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,simonpheenicks,5,Tue Jul 21 04:38:00 2015 UTC,"Reggie is del rios ""yes man"" LMFAO"

oaklandraiders,3dztc8,CalmYourTits_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:50:19 2015 UTC,This is true.  The reality is that very little is actually known about Reggie and Mark's interactions as well as Reggie and players' interactions like Houston and Veldheer.  All we have is speculations which is completely bullshit.
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,david531990,-3,Wed Jul 22 01:50:56 2015 UTC,"Mack and carr were no brainers, if he didn't pick them that would've been grounds for firing him. Picking Cooper is ok but he passed on Williams, now let's analyze, the last 2 SB teams didn't have an elite WR at all. Defense was more important for both teams.   Now finding people like Carrie in the 7th is ok but let's be honest, Carrie would be bench (or cut) from most teams, thing is, we don't have anyone else. I think he is ok but not exactly as good as most fans around here make him to be."
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,VegasRon,0,Tue Jul 21 16:11:17 2015 UTC,What a couple of stupid arguments.

oaklandraiders,3dztc8,VegasRon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:09:45 2015 UTC,If either Mack or Carr were such no-brainers why didn't they go earlier? Lots of redrafts had Mack first and I saw a couple with Carr in the top 5. This argument is fucking stupid especially in light of the fact we've drafted mainly shit in the first round for 15 years or more.  Who knows if Carrie would be on the bench or cut from other teams? You're making assumptions that just don't exist or can't be proven at this point. It's obvious you're trying really hard to shit on RM and it's rather sad.  Moron.

oaklandraiders,3dztc8,VegasRon,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:20:35 2015 UTC,"lol? Plenty of GMs every year choose wrongly when given ""obvious"" choices. Guys like McShay barely had Carr on their draft boards.   This whole point is based on hindsight."
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,david531990,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:26:33 2015 UTC,"And other guys had Carr as a top 15 talent. He was a no-brainer because the other QB on the board (remember we needed one?) was Garoppolo. Also rumors had it that Davis wanted Carr at 5 and was gonna fire Reggie if he didn't manage to land Carr. When your job is on the line and you can save it by picking this guy who is there in the 2nd round, that seems a no brainer. Also Mack wasn't supposed to fell to us at 5th, he was supposed to go at 4th. He didn't discover any diamonds in the rough, he just picked BPA, which is a weird concept for us since for the last 13 or so years we drafted horribly but that don't mean Reggie is the best GM and we should all make statues for him. Can't forget about the 2012 draft, Hayden is on the edge of being a bust when he could have picked a better player and Hayden had this heart issue which was a big red flag. Watson seems to not be the starter anymore, so that's a 1st and a 2nd round wasted. As I said, he has found some value but come on, he hasn't exactly found a Richard Sherman or a Kam Chancellor to be praising him like this sub does."
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,VegasRon,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:02:01 2015 UTC,"I never heard any fucking rumor about RM being fired if he didn't draft Carr at 5. Looks like he didn't get fired, though. Nice work, man.  I love you reasoning, RM is a bad gm when he takes guys that don't work out and is making no-brainer picks when he does. Also, nice hyperbole, nobody is saying he's the best GM or we should make statues to him, calm the fuck down.   Nice job bringing up the 2012 draft, the one RM had three months to prepare for and no draft picks until a compensatory in the 3rd? 4th?   You have some kind of strange hateboner for a dude nobody is putting in the HoF, so I'll just leave you to it."
oaklandraiders,3dztc8,CalmYourTits_,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:45:06 2015 UTC,"That Carr rumor doesnt really make sense.  If Davis wanted Carr at 5 and was going to fire Reggie if he didn't get him, then he would've simply overruled Reggie and made the draft pick himself.   If he's willing to fire him over it, he would've stepped in right away.    And if is job was actually on the line, he would've traded down into the late 1st to take him.  As the QBs were dropping the rumors were flying that we could potentially trade up to grab one. I would bet my life savings that that rumor was completely false."

The team is still young, there are a lot of holes in the roster despite some excellent drafting from Reggie McKenzie (you guys had the best draft class of 2014), but you need to hit on at least one more draft and hopefully get some quality coaching from Del Rio to get to that point.   I think you have an excellent foundation, but the sort of rebuild you're talking about takes some time. The pieces are coming together, but I think you need just one more year before you're there."

oaklandraiders,3drl6d,LordSugarTits,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:37:55 2015 UTC,Just my two cents...I been doing this for a long time...you'll see tickets going for 20 bucks on the first deck come the week of the game ...it's just the nature of the beast with pre season games  ..also you have great seats but people buying tickets are going to be looking for even better seats ...if you have season tickets u can donate them for that game as well

oaklandraiders,3dmolv,Black_Mack_52,2,Fri Jul 17 18:15:27 2015 UTC,I told people it was a fitbit most of the time but lots of stares. The worst thing was not being able to play semipro football this season and being in early on weekends. Dont take nights for granted now.

oaklandraiders,3dmolv,mthrfkn,8,Sat Jul 18 10:21:00 2015 UTC,"This week has thankfully flown by! My news from my oral surgery consultation last week wasn't great,but my vacation to SC last week was awesome. I had a beach BBQ in a cave and drew this picture, and despite getting 50+ flea bites because OMG Santa Cruz has so many fucking fleas, it was definitely a much-needed vacation :)  This week's Game Review of the Week features LSU knocking off undefeated Ole Miss. It has already gotten a decent amount of attention this week, but if you're still hankering for football until training camp starts, this game features a lot of defensive and OL talent that we might be interested in for the 2016 draft :)"

It was about a mile away along the shoreline. We kinda just parked somewhere that our friends knew about and found a small cave behind some rocks to smoke and BBQ. It was pretty awesome :)"

Going to the Raiders/Donkeys in October but need to know the good Raiders bars to watch the games! Anyways spending the whole weekend packing up my stuff before the move."
oaklandraiders,3dmolv,theuautumnwind,2,Fri Jul 17 16:28:07 2015 UTC,"Good Raiders bars?  Ricky's Sports Theater and Grill 15028 Hesperian Blvd, San Leandro, California Tel: (510) 352 0200 Website: Rickys Sports Theater and Grill. Located in the heart of Oakland Raiders territory, and rated by Sports Illustrated magazine as the second best sports bar in the United States.  http://www.silverandblackpride.com/2014/9/6/6113537/oakland-raiders-bars-across-the-united-states"
oaklandraiders,3dmolv,mthrfkn,2,Fri Jul 17 20:53:31 2015 UTC,"I second the Rick's recommendation. It's a place of worship for Raiders fans. If you go at a time when it's not crazy, you can talk to Ricky and he has some crazy ass stories. If you're fortunate, you can sit at the old spot where Al sat at when he would visit. They also have a chair reserved specifically for Jon Gruden, you know for when he returns. -___-;  But in the city they have a lot of good spots to watch games, the problem is that you have fans from all over since everyone moves to SF. If you're ever up for watching an away game with a reddit crew, it'd be dope to organize. How sick would it be to get a group of us to watch that Steelers game? Rhetorical question, duh."

It'll be me and two buddies of mine, we're all in our late 20s."
oaklandraiders,3dmolv,Driftwood_Jumper,2,Fri Jul 17 16:36:09 2015 UTC,I stayed in Portland for about 2 months doing Roofing. Let me tell you something. You can't spit without finding somewhere thats a strip club and there are quite a few good ones! Also... If you are into Coffee the Bikini Barista places are cool too. That entire city is made up of bars that are Topless Bar tending by night and family diner by day. It's a weird fun place.  If you ain't into that. I would suggest going Disc Golfing if you can. That is also fun as hell (especially when plastered ofc).
oaklandraiders,3dmolv,Black_Mack_52,2,Fri Jul 17 17:08:03 2015 UTC,Wow thanks. I wouldn't have expected such a hipster town to be full of strip clubs. That's interesting... will have to do some more research...

We drove the 5 all the way to Oregon, pretty much.  Also, take your favorite liquor. Even if you think you won't need/want it. We drove to a bevmo in Washington (30 min) just because we were sick of driving store to store in Portland. None to be found!  I'd recommend a place called ""Off the waffle"".

oaklandraiders,3dkhme,ahydell,2,Fri Jul 17 00:21:49 2015 UTC,"I would say the starters: Crabtree and Cooper with Streater in the slot. Holmes, Thompkins, Butler, and Harper depth players."
oaklandraiders,3dkhme,InvaderCountry,3,Fri Jul 17 00:39:56 2015 UTC,Out of all those depth players I'm most excited for Harper. Instant connection for Carr.
oaklandraiders,3dkhme,betterbutterbeater,5,Fri Jul 17 03:58:19 2015 UTC,"This is really good think for practices. But in training camp when they are 7v7 or 11v11, Harper will be playing with the second or third stringer and will rarely get any chance with Carr. And in pre-season, Carr will be pulled out of the game by the time Harper will get any chance to play. This will definelty hurt his chances but from his college numbers he has done well without Carr and I am also excited about him. Hopefully we get a second Streater or maybe we get our own Rod Smith."
oaklandraiders,3dkhme,InvaderCountry,2,Fri Jul 17 05:12:57 2015 UTC,That's how I would list the lineup too but I think Thompkins will be gone once the regular season starts.
oaklandraiders,3dkhme,Alden0,3,Fri Jul 17 00:53:48 2015 UTC,I doubt it. Like the article said he's been catching everything thrown his way. He has shown consistency through out the off-season programs.
oaklandraiders,3dkhme,InvaderCountry,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:46:27 2015 UTC,The same thing that's been said about him every off-season. forever.
oaklandraiders,3dkhme,VegasRon,3,Fri Jul 17 04:31:48 2015 UTC,He is the most consistent out of all the other depth players. Holmes is fast and big but drops too many. I think Butler also dropped about same amount as Thompkins last season. We don't know much about Harper other than his college games and chemistry with Carr which is really good.
oaklandraiders,3dkhme,InvaderCountry,2,Fri Jul 17 05:07:54 2015 UTC,He's been in the league for two years..
oaklandraiders,3djlpe,cloudchamber,7,Thu Jul 16 20:13:43 2015 UTC,"Cooper, Walford, and Edwards Jr.  Cooper - has the potential to make the entire receiving corps better, if he's able to draw double coverage and stretch the field.  Walford - over the middle receiving threat. Big TE that can also block, will probably start over Rivera.  Edwards Jr. - will be able to free up Mack to go 1 on 1 vs. the opposing TE/FB/RB, or give him a free path to the QB."
oaklandraiders,3djlpe,JB1549,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:51:02 2015 UTC,"Cooper and Walford can make an immediate impact for sure, and possibly Feliciano, depending on if he can beat out the vets in Training Camp.  Unfortunately, I don't think he's that close."
oaklandraiders,3djlpe,SpacePirate,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:04:27 2015 UTC,Those day 3 picks could make a legitimate impact on STs. That would be huge.
oaklandraiders,3dk6ei,Ramza87,2,Thu Jul 16 22:47:59 2015 UTC,I'm not sure how it works for the general public but I know season ticket members were able to sign up for training camp days to watch through the Raiders.
oaklandraiders,3dk6ei,fuckyoumissdaisy,2,Thu Jul 16 23:27:15 2015 UTC,I believe only certain dates are open and pertain to season tickets holders only. I think last season we had a joint practice in Oxnard that was open to everyone.
oaklandraiders,3dk6ei,ap0calypse702,2,Fri Jul 17 01:35:27 2015 UTC,"It's only open to season ticket members, not to the public. If you call 800-RAIDERS they'll confirm that for you."

oaklandraiders,3do4bu,Civilized_Legend,2,Sat Jul 18 09:27:06 2015 UTC,Matt Miller is good when it comes to scoutting but is terrible with ranking anything and almost everyone knows that by now. I don't even use bleacherreport anymore with people like Mike Freeman writing shitty articles.
oaklandraiders,3do4bu,Trapline,2,Fri Jul 17 21:29:40 2015 UTC,"Ranking 1000 NFL players from 22 different positions is near impossible.  You would have to do so much detailed analysis, it would be such a waste of time.  The only reason they put this out is for a gimmick and conversation starters.  Either gets people pumped or pisses them off.   I mean, Jaws on ESPN does his annual top 32 QBs rankings in the off-season and he put Carr ahead of Bridgewater.   I'm not a huge fan of his but he's more credible than  most of these random writers."

oaklandraiders,3djn0k,cloudchamber,5,Thu Jul 16 20:23:21 2015 UTC,"Man, I wonder what Tyler Wilson is up to these days. Like how do you go from a very good NFL QB prospect to an absolute nobody in about 2 months?"
oaklandraiders,3djn0k,JudgeJBS,5,Thu Jul 16 21:58:00 2015 UTC,"No kidding, it's like that entire draft class is on the hot seat. I hope they all work out though. Otherwise, we'll have some real problems in the secondary and on the O-line. Moore seems like the only one that's really established himself. The rest need to step up this season and earn their roster spots."
oaklandraiders,3djn0k,JB1549,3,Thu Jul 16 22:09:18 2015 UTC,Seems like that draft sucked for everyone
oaklandraiders,3djn0k,Psycho5275,2,Fri Jul 17 03:36:18 2015 UTC,"Definitely a weaker talent pool. I think it helps to explain Reggie's decision making (trading down and taking Hayden). Not only did he gain more picks (more darts to throw at the dart board) but he also addressed a couple positions of need. Also, they were both (Hayden and Watson) risky picks with high upside. I think Hayden has the better chance of working out, Watson can't seem to break into the starting lineup."

oaklandraiders,3djd5a,shamalamabigdong,2,Thu Jul 16 19:19:39 2015 UTC,Nope. Gabe is gonna develop at LG what's the point at having him move around even if it's just a year? If the RG is our weakest spot then we will just need to double team or chip with a RB and in the long run we can find someone else whether it's draft or next year FA (which I have no clue what the class looks like). If it really comes down to Barnes I'd take my chances on him strictly due to the loyalty on him signing one year deals year in and year out for the past like 7 years haha. But I have confidence that the coaches will be able to somewhat hide that spot. We will absolutely see glimpses of terrible match ups and get beat but we will over come it  Edit: changed RG to LG whoops
oaklandraiders,3djd5a,fuentesf51,2,Thu Jul 16 19:19:20 2015 UTC,Gabe is LG  Edit: but i agree leave him at LG where he can be one of the best in the league

oaklandraiders,3deibj,Sicksnames,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:27:59 2015 UTC,"I'm just visualizing the offense, Cooper, Crabs, Streater, Walford, Rivera.  Man.    I think the biggest problem will be simply creating an offensive identity.  JDR has clearly stated early on that the best way to help the passing game is to work on the running game.  JDR is a run+defense kind of guy.  At the same time Musgrave has had some nice numbers out of his QBs but he's also been a run heavy guy with Taylor and Peterson.   We hear stuff about how we wanna pound the ball, then we also hear stuff about how we're gonna go no-huddle and have more of a fresno st type of offense.  We have Murray, Trich, and Helu, and Murray's been talked up alot this off-season, at the same time we acquired 3 big targets.    So its really been mixed signals with what we're up to.  We hear Cooper and Murray look great, we hear TRich lost some weight.  We hear Hudson is a beast.  But we also hear from Musgrave himself that we have a LONG way to go on offense, and basically its not looking anywhere close to where we want to be.  Carr also didn't throw for most of mini-camp.   So really curious how this is all gonna play out.  I think once we have our identity set, we can better predict whats gonna happen, and we can get more precise pieces that fit what we do. Are we a power running team? Should we go get a power run-blocking RG and RT? Are we going to be a high volume vertical passing team, and should get more speed at receiver and more of pass protecting linemen?"

One of our 7th rounders, Carrie, has already shown he has the ability to be a starter in the league. If the rest of the draft picks end up becoming legit starters, this would be one of the greatest drafts for any team in the history of the league. I definitely feel it has the potential to be and feel that the 2015 draft class was solid as well. No question that if these draft classes are as solid as we think, the Raiders are headed for great things over the next decade."

It has at least been a possibility here in Denmark.   I cannot see why it wouldn't work. You could have your standard cover, this year OBJ, but then in team stores sell a Madden with a team specific cover.  I'm sure it's going to be worth the money. Especially after having done no calculations whatsoever."

oaklandraiders,3dbl6u,regdent,7,Fri Jul 17 02:11:38 2015 UTC,"Didn't even realized he got signed by the Bucs and Niners last year.  Didn't really do much.  If I recall correctly he had a tendency to fumble when he was a full time returner with the Broncos. I remember talking smack to my Bronco fan buddy that he'll turn it over more times than he'll score TDs, which I think was true.  In '14 he had 1 fumble, no lost, in like 2 games.  In '13 he had 5 fumbles, 2 lost. In '12 he had 6 fumbles, 1 lost.     Anyways, I'm betting he was brought in for competition.  I think we got a few returners right now with Debose, Taiwan, and him, and possibly Josh Harper."

oaklandraiders,3dc416,EHsE,6,Wed Jul 15 04:39:06 2015 UTC,"I really liked Usama Young to be honest, I thought he was the best of the bunch, between him, Ross, and Dowling.  I thought he filled in well for Branch until he got hurt.   But yea we'll see how Dowling does.  We really haven't seen him.  We need a slightly more ball-hawkish safeties than enforcers at this point seeing as how our run-d looks to be the best part of our D, and our pass-rush and coverage are unproven."

oaklandraiders,3da0g6,Keyser_Brozay,5,Tue Jul 14 17:41:50 2015 UTC,By that do you mean he's able to change direction and then accelerate well?
oaklandraiders,3da0g6,Electric_Pegasus,6,Tue Jul 14 18:18:18 2015 UTC,"That plays a part but the real reason is that there is no wasted movement when he changes direction. A lot of guys are fast and can accelerate but changing direction while not losing speed is not as common because it requires a lot of practice and hard work on the fundamentals (how many steps to take, hand movement, keeping knees bent etc)."

oaklandraiders,3d9b4h,kingwombat12,10,Tue Jul 14 15:31:14 2015 UTC,He's easily the best defensive back in the country.  He'll be a top-10 pick.  GBN has us taking him at #7 overall.

oaklandraiders,3d7wo4,CarlCaliente,4,Tue Jul 14 18:24:51 2015 UTC,Can anyone with video production knowledge tell me why the audio recordings sound so shitty? You can like hear the static of the voice recording flick on and off with the spoken lines. I guess I just expect more from an NFL franchise.  Just win baby
oaklandraiders,3d7wo4,Keyser_Brozay,2,Tue Jul 14 18:34:18 2015 UTC,"Video guy here. There are possibly a few factors at play:    Charles Woodson's probably a very busy guy, so any chance of recording his voice is likely in between practice sessions, etc. so he won't be stopping by the recording studio anytime soon. The most time he could probably spare is a few mins. Because of this short window, you have to capture his voice using a handheld mic, lavalier (clips to lapel) mic or shotgun mic. These normally have low output and thus, it increases the level of white noise (i.e. static) produced. There are ways to boost the signal but it requires more equipment such as a preamp. Compression. When the video was created the videographer possibly used a compression format that reduced the file size but also affected the audio quality.   Probably more than you wanted to know and I'm also surprised that the quality is not NFL-level, but it probably came down to Woodson's schedule."

Dan Williams you can follow him and should on Twitter. What's gone on to an area. Barbara you know yeah. Got it will work out I don't know could be don't show. Round and so EU got let your last couple weeks into you gotta hit pick camp what do you what do you do do in the last few weeks. May have to determine trying you know gold playbook and make sure it is. I'm very little remote pity you know can appreciate man and you know make sure that you know you know it didn't want to. Reviewed rewrote it will be much better at it and and I drank I have known as you're ready to. So you know Michael he goes to review. Article where. It's hard and so I do not isn't hard feat to get away from the game with all of these. Offseason activities kind of looming around every corner. It is amigo. It could be or. Meet me do you know more dynamic of the award treat your party. You know embattled BC. You know everybody know that you know capstar. Miette Marie put but the big values. No you do you have Richard did you make ample liquidity don't get. And panic. Generally Jonas raiders defensive tackle came over the cards in the offseason. You know what it's like to be got a great defense the cardinals last years have been very very good despite injuries you guys have been great.

oaklandraiders,3d4ea3,superslothwaffle,20,Mon Jul 13 14:04:37 2015 UTC,He had 9 receptions 71 yards and two touchdowns .-. Those are decent numbers.
oaklandraiders,3d4ea3,Sirscraps,10,Mon Jul 13 14:30:19 2015 UTC,He had 2 touchdowns?! Wow I didn't even realize that. I guess I was too focused on the Buckeyes. Thanks for the info

Theres alot of explosive WRs who use their speed and height to dominate college but when we're talking pure technique and route running, I'll take Cooper.  I've never seen a WR make DB's look as silly as he does.  I've posted a few videos in the past where Cooper does the slightest head-fake and the Corner or Safety gets completely turned around, and when he looks back, Cooper is walking into the endzone with the ball.  And its worth noting that Cooper said he was consistently running in the 4.3 range when practicing.  And on the overlap video, he looks like he beat White.  I'm convinced he's a 4.3 kind of guy.  Dude has afterburners too, you see it when he gets the WR screens or he's tracking a long ball.   Edit: Heres the videos I was talking about, here and here.  He's a joy to watch."

Thats his crazy discipline in route-running technique that allows him to fake out DBs so easily.   I feel like guys like White and Watkins who have more of a violent running style tend not to be able to do these small things as effectively.  And Vernon Hargreaves is no joke, he's the #1 rated corner for next years draft."

I wrote a very long post in this subreddit about meeting Amari Cooper at the NLFPA Rookie Premiere here in Los Angeles.

oaklandraiders,3d4ea3,mikeb0870,0,Tue Jul 14 04:11:47 2015 UTC,"In fairness to Julio Jones, I would have wanted Blake Sims over Greg McElroy. Every year Julio was there the defense was much better than last year. Greg was a heady player but lacked the arm strength to play to Julio's best assets which are cooper type speed in a large, lean, muscular physique. Greg had limited touch on deep balls and was more affective in crossing type, screen, and quick out sets. Blake Sims played better than anyone could hope last year. His arm strength was never a problem last year but without a player like Cooper on the team I think he would have been uneffective and Alabama without Cooper loses many more games last year. Coop was certainly more polished than Julio and was a much better player at Alabama but Julio (with a strong arm qb in atl) showed (minus injuries) from day one in the NFL that he is the real deal.   P.s. A.J. Mccarron had coop for two years and if Carr fails is a guy that the Raiders should get. Hell they should trade for him anyway."
oaklandraiders,3d4ea3,VegasRon,9,Mon Jul 13 15:46:18 2015 UTC,Uhhh your last note is pretty dumb.  AJ McCarron is a backup to Dalton.  Second off why would we get someone who is just gonna be another Matt Leinart (great on his college team because of the rest of the team)?  Third I had the pleasure of living in Georgia 3-2 years ago and McCarron wasn't even the best QB in the SEC.  Regardless of weather Carr fails or not McCarron sucks
oaklandraiders,3d4ea3,mikeb0870,2,Mon Jul 13 16:26:05 2015 UTC,The Bengals are pretty high on McCarron.... I see it kicked around that they are open to the idea he could succeed Dalton sometime.... clearly you have your opinion also
oaklandraiders,3d4ea3,WilmaFingerdo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:21:38 2015 UTC,Practice and game situations differ.  I dont doubt that McCarron has grown since Bama but will it be enough to start in the NFL?  We dont know.  What we do know is that Carr can start in the NFL and we shouldn't be concerned with getting McCarron
oaklandraiders,3d4ea3,WilmaFingerdo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:39:21 2015 UTC,"Look I like Carr but now is not the time to be putting all our eggs in the Carr basket. Did he do some nice things? Yes. Did he look terrible at times? Yes, the whole team did. Cooper will help Carr but he's a work in progress and hopefully he can keep getting better but if he doesn't than this team should be prepared."

oaklandraiders,3d4ea3,jayrock310,2,Mon Jul 13 16:46:21 2015 UTC,"I would take Carr over McCarron, but this is more of an endorsement of Carr than it is a knock on McCarron."

oaklandraiders,3d3lzu,Sicksnames,5,Tue Jul 14 10:27:40 2015 UTC,The whole system is a joke to be honest.  The NFL makes well over a billion dollars a year in net profit.  They can EASILY help fill in the gap for any funding gap in new stadiums. They want us to pay for stadiums while teams/NFL rakes in all the profit.

oaklandraiders,3d1guv,circa_1,5,Sun Jul 12 19:12:17 2015 UTC,"I think our floor is 6 wins and our ceiling is 10, so realistically 7 or 8 wins. Might as well go through our schedule.  Week 1: Bengals 50/50 Bengals are a solid team with a good run game. Will see how much our D has progressed against the run.  Week 2: Ravens L The ravens are a solid team, I don't see us winning.  Week 3: @ Browns W The browns don't have a functioning QB, we get 2 picks and Manziel hits the dirt 4 times in the first blow out of our season.  Week 4:@ Chicago 50/50 A lot of people would call this an automatic win considering how bad Cutler was on the tail end of the season. Cutler can still show up and ball though, so it's hard to decide.  Week 5: Denver L It pains me to admit it, but I don't see us getting a W against denver this year.  Week 6: Bye No raiders football :(  Week 7: @ SD 50/50 San Diego still has a decent team, at home they can put up a fight  Week 8: Jets W It's the Jets, low scoring game that Geno throws away.  Week 9: @ Shittsburgh 50/50 We always manage to ball out, for whatever reason, against the Steelers. But our secondary is our weakest link and they have some elite WRs.  Week 10: Vikings W Bridgewater is going to have to come to the Coliseum and discover he's the second best sophomore QB. Predicting a shootout.  Week 11: @ Lions L I'm a pretty strong believer in the Lions. Megatron is back, I don't like our chances  Week 12: @Titans W Just a bad football team in general Comfortable win.  Week 13: KC W We did it last year, fuck it we're doing it again. We took their starting center and I don't think Charles is going to do as well because of that.  Week 14: @ Denver L See week 5, unless Peyton's arm falls off like it did last season near the end it's not going to happen.  Week 15: Green Bay L Best team in football IMO.  Week 16: SD W At home, against a division rival pushing for the wildcard spot like we might, Carr leads us to victory. Two AC/DC touchdowns  Week 17: @ KC 50/50 Arrowhead is a bitch, but if KC has a bad year then who knows.  This gives us 6 locked in wins, 5 50/50's and 5 pretty much throw away losses. I can't fucking wait for the season to start."
oaklandraiders,3d1guv,betterbutterbeater,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:01:49 2015 UTC,"Considering how many games we lost by less than 10 points last year I'd say with our improved coaching staff and roster that at least 3-4 of those 50/50 games can go our way. We almost beat the Pats and Hawks last season, so we could very well pull out wins against Baltimore and maybe even Detroit.  It's so hard to tell at this point. We'll see how organized and collected our team is once they finally hit the field during preseason."

oaklandraiders,3d1guv,mandingoBBC,2,Sun Jul 12 19:29:49 2015 UTC,I agree the team is such a wildcard this year pretty hard to predict how we do. I would be pretty comfortable taking the over on 5.5 though. 6-10 to 8-8 seem most likely
oaklandraiders,3d1guv,WilmaFingerdo,5,Mon Jul 13 01:27:38 2015 UTC,"I think 7-9 is good, I'm being really optimistic and thinking we'll go 8-8, but 6-10 is probably the most realistic.

oaklandraiders,3d1guv,ahydell,3,Sun Jul 12 19:39:52 2015 UTC,"Crazy as it may sound I wouldn't mind 4-5 wins to give us one more stellar draft class. 10+wins a year for the next 10 years after that. Our division is getting old, quick. Opens the door for many division titles and playoff runs. That being said I wouldn't be surprised if we pull off 9 or 10 wins this year.

They have a retard coach and a bunch of the team went away and sackorpick really isnt that great. He said ""hows your running game?"" and I posted the video of Murray doing his 90 yard deal. He goes ""yeah, well, sackorpick ran a touchdown... oh, that was 91 yards"" so I posted the video of Pryor making the NFL record for a quarterback doing a 93 yard touchdown from scrimmage. Of course he goes ""well, he's not your quarterback anymore"" and I anticipated this with ""well, a Raider still set the record""..... for some reason he had nothing to come back with and that was our conversation on that."

oaklandraiders,3cxear,ahydell,8,Sat Jul 11 19:48:21 2015 UTC,Wow this is pretty revolutionary.
oaklandraiders,3cy1mi,facetiously,5,Sat Jul 11 20:25:22 2015 UTC,I've got to say that my favorite part was that they didn't murder Carr for his YPA they even go as far as saying he's far too talented to have such a low average and we should see an increase. Good read.
oaklandraiders,3cy1mi,fuentesf51,5,Sun Jul 12 01:35:18 2015 UTC,Brady gets no shit for his low YPA last year. It's a stat that only got traction because Carr was so low in it.
oaklandraiders,3cy1mi,TheDevilsAgent,3,Sun Jul 12 02:14:42 2015 UTC,"True, it all rides on Carr's shoulders but I'm confident he won't regress. He pretty much has only one flaw that I see, it's the happy feet. He doesn't set correctly or he's in a rush to dump it off to not take a sack. Could be a symptom of having your big bro fail and not wanting to suffer the same fate or a rookie doing rookie things.  But Carr is the future QB for the Raiders for a couple years Atleast and it will be fun to see if he'll be the savior or join Russell of failed qbs."
oaklandraiders,3cy1mi,Kaner222,3,Sun Jul 12 01:36:17 2015 UTC,I'm pretty excited about Dan Williams.  He's been a nose tackle and wasn't really asked to rush the passer much.  Dude takes on double teams and will free up Lofton and Mack to make plays.  I dont know what kind of defense we're going to run but playing next to Jelly should help him too.  A strong interior D-line helps everyone out.  Its particularly important on short-yardage situations.

oaklandraiders,3cpbvu,Rdd21,3,Thu Jul 9 20:02:59 2015 UTC,"Estate taxes are 40% over anything above 5.4 million (this year). There are ways to circumvent this, but he will definitely get a HUGE bill. Although, nowthat NFL teams can put the team in a trust, maybe not."
oaklandraiders,3cpbvu,frENTlee,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:49:31 2015 UTC,"Mark won't have to worry about that as much with the new laws passed in California regarding trusts. The team and franchise would be immune to the estate tax when that comes to pass.   As far as anything else, we do know that he was willing to sell a piece previously, but it hasn't even hit the Raiders table yet, so who knows what's going to happen. Oakland still has to approve the damn thing.   Also for those getting the idea that the value of the Raiders will double or even triple just by moving to LA, take a look at where value really comes from for the NFL. Most of the money that is geography based is shared among the owners (the TV contracts). It's not owned by the franchise in that area. The franchise would gain in value only if there was a direct revenue increase, which would be basically every game at full capacity, every piece of merchandise sold, every ""extra"" bought. The current stadium doesn't support a lot of the revenue boosting items that a NFL team needs to be truly profitable. That's what the issue is. If they built a new stadium in Oakland vs one in LA, and the same amount of people attended games and bought merchandise, the value isn't going to change much.  A perfect example of where value comes from for the NFL would be to look at the Cowboys. Why are they the richest franchise? Not because of TV contracts. It's because Jerrah owns ALL the rights to merchandising for the Dallas franchise. So if anyone wants to advertise the Dallas Cowboys, they have to not only go to the NFL, but they have to negotiate with HIM as well.   Another example would be the Patriots. How have they increased their value? The Kraft group injected millions into the team with building the new stadium as well as the surrounding plazas. They own the whole complex. All that new infrastructure, new merchandising opportunities, advertising, etc is a massive revenue stream going straight to the Patriots. It wasn't the area they were in, it was improving on every aspect of making money for the team. (Winning helps obviously)"

oaklandraiders,3cl1ow,ahydell,5,Wed Jul 8 19:07:20 2015 UTC,Is the ultimate winner going to be decided by total points in the season or a postseason fantasy tournament between the four winners?
oaklandraiders,3cl1ow,sio-kedelic,2,Wed Jul 8 20:11:25 2015 UTC,That's a really cool idea. Can we set up a 4 team post-season league?
oaklandraiders,3cl1ow,sio-kedelic,3,Wed Jul 8 21:13:42 2015 UTC,"I haven't done postseason fantasy play in a bit, but I know nfl.com does a playoffs-only fantasy where you pick optimal lineups from everyone and get multipliers based on how long you've had them in your lineup. So, if you picked Rodgers in the wildcard round and he makes the Super Bowl (and is still your starting QB), you get 4x the points he would normally get from his SB performance.  I'm sure there would be some way to do a Reddit league within that. Even if it's just the winners posting their team/results after each game."

oaklandraiders,3cjlht,Rdd21,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:37:55 2015 UTC,definitely not willing to trade a high pick for him despite his talent mainly because next years draft seems to be loaded with pass rushers. if we really want him its in our best interest to wait till next offseason and see if he re-signs with the gmen or not cause he still has the franchise tag applied to him right now
oaklandraiders,3cjlht,senior_dgaf,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:17:41 2015 UTC,Yeah if next year's draft wasn't loaded with defensive talent then I would consider it but as it stands the most loaded positions for next years prospects will be QB's (which we will not need to look at if all goes according to plan) and Defensive linemen/Defensive Backs.

Probably his most important finger, his leverage finger.  NO WAY is JPP going to play at anywhere near his past level.  You need your dominant hand to shed blocker(s).    People who are right-handed are hopeless w/o their dominant hand.  Back when Nintendo released the Legend of Zelda demo for the Wii at E3, so many right handed people complained about having to use the left hand (since Link was always left-handed prior to the release on the Wii) that Nintendo changed Link to be right-handed by the official release.  And that's just swiping at air w/ a Wii remote.  JPP got to do more than that w/ the left hand to compensate.    No comparison.    Raiders would be stupid to sign someone like JPP IMO.  Maybe JPP loses another body part next off-season .. who knows."

oaklandraiders,3cfv6e,sio-kedelic,2,Wed Jul 8 04:04:12 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's all good. I'm still deciding how many leagues I want to be a part of this year lol.  If there's enough people, I guess I'd actually be down to commish that last league in addition to being a part of league 1. Two leagues isn't the end of the world lol. /u/SpacePirate and /u/Wycleft_Lip , would it be fine if you guys were in that league too?"
oaklandraiders,3cfv6e,SpacePirate,2,Wed Jul 8 15:09:33 2015 UTC,"I have my 4th commish already, /u/ModalDispersion so you get to just kick back and enjoy playing - feel free to make your own league too, I'm sure there's enough interest."

Pass-rush is where we need to improve."

oaklandraiders,3cblej,newBreed,7,Mon Jul 6 22:09:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, because Carr has the potential to develop into more than Dalton has shown he can be.

oaklandraiders,3cblej,EHsE,2,Mon Jul 6 22:15:46 2015 UTC,And future potential has to be factored into that equation to some extent

oaklandraiders,3cb051,som3thingclassy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:04:11 2015 UTC,I noticed this a lot when I drafted him for fantasy. He seems to find a habit of almost looking FOR contact. He just puts his head down and tries to run someone over rather than cutting toward the hole.
oaklandraiders,3cb051,RealEmpire,5,Wed Jul 8 19:54:58 2015 UTC,"If he ever remembers how to be the guy he was in Bama we could have a steal here. As of right now he has 0 expectations. Hopefully he is able to get himself on track, gain some early success and grow into the player we all once believed he would be. Typically that's easier said than done but loosing weight and gaining speed is a step in the right direction."
oaklandraiders,3cb051,Black_Mack_52,3,Mon Jul 6 15:22:03 2015 UTC,Or he could be another guy who shows amazing flashes here and there but generally is a below-average starter that we end up keeping around for 6-7 seasons while crossing our fingers...

oaklandraiders,3cb0rn,skepticismissurvival,9,Mon Jul 6 14:38:16 2015 UTC,"I've been waiting a while for this article, sweet.  First off, a trend I'm immediately noticing is that there's an unblocked blitzer on a lot of these turnovers and Carr-Wiz was a truly horrific QB-C combination. I remember the JJ Watt free-blitz and Kruger fumbles being pretty tough circumstances to avoid anyway, and after watching the replay, it does feel like Wiz was partially responsible for a surprising amount of these fumbles. In the Kruger fumble, you can see Wiz pointing off to the left and then sliding his protection that way. The guy he disengages with, #55, is the one that gets in Carr's only possible throwing lane and forces him to pull it down and fumble it. The first Broncos fumble was also probably on Wiz, since that definitely wasn't the only time we saw unclean snapping from him last year (see: the first and second Chargers fumble, the first Chiefs fumble, and the Broncos fumble topping page 3. The fact that Carr even knocked that one to Penn is impressive, IMO).  I'm also a proponent of our receivers making plays to bail out iffy throws, and that wasn't happening at all last year. I'm not defending the decision-making aspect of some of these throws, as Carr seemed to have better options on most if he had perfect vision, but the fact that Denarius Moore alligator-armed a potential game-winning TD still pisses me off. Looking back on it now, the game-sealing pick in the NE and SD games, and to much lesser extents the miscommunications/inability to pick up errant throws in the Grimes pick, the Irvin pick-six, and the Brown pick in the Rams game were all pretty poor instances of our receivers giving a shit about catching the ball. None of these were the best decisions in the world, but at the NFL, you should be making these plays for your QB.  However, there were also a lot of really bad throws in here. I'm just gonna hope that Carr was pushing a bit too hard, but the second Broncos pick, the second Broncos fumble on Page 3, and the Bills fumble are 100% just bad plays by Carr. The first Texans pick, second Broncos pick, and third Broncos pick were pretty iffy, too, and the first Rams pick was just too high a throw under pressure. I can follow his decision-making here and see that there are actually windows for some of these shots to be completed, but they're ridiculously small and Carr's arm isn't nearly refined enough to hit those. The Texans pick was a good decision but he didn't look off the safety, and the third Broncos pick looked like it could've been floated over Ward but was instead lobbed a bit.  Overall, some dumb rookie mistakes and a team that didn't help him out much. Pretty much what we remembered, although I really don't remember Wiz-Carr being that bad."
oaklandraiders,3cb0rn,sio-kedelic,5,Mon Jul 6 15:48:00 2015 UTC,Posted this in the /r/nfl thread but look at the damn names on the opposite ends of these plays. It's a collection of some of the best defenders in the NFL. For a rookie. With no help. Hopefully it made him stronger rather than broke him.
oaklandraiders,3cb0rn,Trapline,4,Mon Jul 6 16:39:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah when you're in ""put the team on my back"" mode and the defenders you are up against are pro bowlers you're going to have some ugly plays guaranteed.   The sooner this team can get some bread and butter plays the better. That Carr won't have to feel like he HAS to throw the ball into a tight window and risk a turnover."

oaklandraiders,3ccmo7,HoodByAir_88,9,Mon Jul 6 21:37:17 2015 UTC,"Agree with you on the Carr/Bridgewater pissfest, it's kind of childish and dumb.  They're very different types of quarterbacks in very different situations.  I think they can both be special.  I'll be honest, as far as that game I have no idea.  There are so many unknowns right now on this Raiders team, a new coaching staff, playbook, half the starters will be rookies, second year players or newly acquired veterans.  We'll know a lot more by the time that game comes around.  Another wild card is Adrian Peterson.  He's proved to be pretty damn durable but nobody knows what a year off will do.  I'm just glad the game is here."
oaklandraiders,3ccmo7,facetiously,5,Mon Jul 6 21:51:49 2015 UTC,You guys are lucky that the game is what like...week ten?  Something like that.  So by then your team should be gelling and the playbook will be making more sense to the young guys.  That's around the time our team started really coming together last year so it'll be interesting.    I think it'll be one hell of a game
oaklandraiders,3ccmo7,ViralOner,7,Mon Jul 6 21:57:07 2015 UTC,I can't wait for the Mack v. Peterson highlights. And our QBs were very close to landing on the opposite team which no one seems to remember.
oaklandraiders,3ccmo7,JudgeJBS,3,Mon Jul 6 22:56:03 2015 UTC,"Agreed!  And Adrian will be sharing carries with McKinnon.  I'm hyped to see what he'll do this season even though he won't be the main back, unless AD ends up shitting the bed.  I really dont think he will though, 30 or not.  He's got another year or two in him.  Peterson and McKinnon are an insanely good backfield.  What McKinnon showed last year before getting hurt....Oh man.  Fire. I'm one of the few vikings fans that believe he could be a feature back if we didn't have Adrian.    My ultimate hope is that we draft chubbs, or another elite college back when they're ready to come out to replace AD.  IF"

But if he's not in the game I honestly see the Vikings losing this one by a bit.  This game is going to come down to who has the better defense. We both have comparable, young quarterbacks; though, I don't think the Vikings will be able to keep our defense on the field for very long. I really do believe we have a top seven defense this season.   Soo...  Raiders 17 - Vikings 10  Low scoring game featuring two young quarterbacks."
oaklandraiders,3ccmo7,JudgeJBS,3,Mon Jul 6 22:34:53 2015 UTC,"Serious question you believe you have a better defense than us?    Adrian will be there by the way..he's playing week one.

Not like breaking the record surprise but still"
oaklandraiders,3ccmo7,mp51669,2,Mon Jul 6 23:02:55 2015 UTC,"Well we have better linebackers and the middle of our d line is better, you have better corners and I don't know what your safety  or edge rusher situation is but we're pretty average in those areas and it looks like our strength lies in run defense. I'm honestly not even that scared of Peterson, i don't think we will stack the box and I think the only way Peterson will have a ton of success running against us is if your team targets the opposite side of Mack every play, Peterson won't tear us up running down the middle and honestly I don't think he would best Mack. But I do think we will win in O.CO, the crowds going to be fierce and the team played really well at home towards the end of last season and I can see the momentum carrying over to this year. I expect bridgewater to burn us deep at least once that game but if Carr is given a hurry up offense(supposedly what were running this season but you never know) and if he gets in his comfort zone he will tear you guys apart."
oaklandraiders,3ccmo7,alarmclockradio,0,Tue Jul 7 00:06:39 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to say I think you'll be surprised.    Harrison smith and Blanton in the backfield.  Our secondary is a ALOT better than yours, no fan of any team would disagree with that.  And that's before adding Wayne's into the mix, who might have a great rookie year.  I don't expect it but we shall see   Sharrif Floyd and linval Joseph in the middle   Everson griffen and probably Brian Robison on the edges (griffen is a beast)  Our LB core is going to be very VERY solid this year.  You might have one great one, we have multiple.  And if kendricks turns out how he should, just watch out  I think you're under rating us a bit, and overrating yours a bit but that's what fans do"

Not even going to mention Patterson until the season starts and we all see if his off season work paid off.  I think another year in norv's will help though.  He has all the tools, but to be completely honest I don't think he's the smartest guy around.  Still has potential to be great, and lots of receivers break our year three.  I think he just had issues learning a brand new system quickly, but im not counting him out.  Wallace will be a great fit in norv's system, and Charles Johnson came out of nowhere.  Jarius Wright is a talented slot receiver so we'll just have to see where Patterson fits in if his off season work paid off   So what kind of scores are you guys predicting??

If Dj Hayden can stay healthy I really think we have a solid #1 or #2 cb. Our defensive line is looking pretty good and our linebackers have great potential.   I'm not sure what to think of either of our receiving cores (comparatively).

Corners still too young to be comparable to the Vikings.   Guess what I'm trying to say is don't be surprised. Our defense is built around run defense."

I can't imagine he won't visit the end zone once or twice. and honestly, I'm not too sure how our secondary has improved too much. so it's a big question mark for me since all I really know about the vikings is AP. I think the raiders will win in the range of 6-8 (8 being a stretch) this season, but I don't think they'll be no slouch.

oaklandraiders,3c55re,Green89,4,Sat Jul 4 22:02:10 2015 UTC,"Hey Raider fans,  I'm doing a series listing a potential sleeper for every NFL team, starting with the AFC West. I kind of feel like I love Gabe Jackson a little too much (I genuinely think he has a chance to be an All-Pro soon), is he as well liked here?  Are there any other players you think have a chance to break out this year? I like Brice Butler as a WR and nearly went with him, but I really wanted Jackson to get the respect he deserves haha.   Also, what are your thoughts on Latavius Murray? Is the hype warranted? He looked pretty good last year, but you'll know more about him than me."
oaklandraiders,3c55re,Sirscraps,3,Sat Jul 4 22:05:42 2015 UTC,Any rookie that can man handle jj watt like Gabe Jackson did deserves the praise they get. I think the Murray hype is to much and I don't know if he can be a franchise back or not like a lot of people seem to think. He was up and down last season but maybe with a full off season working as the starter he'll will be more consistent.
oaklandraiders,3c55re,deadlysodium,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:04:01 2015 UTC,Well I mean he did better than McFadden and MJD did in one game vs their whole season.  May be an exaggeration but I don't care.  Our run game will definitely be better this year which will help every other aspect of the game.  Murray doesn't need to be Adrian Peterson he just needs to be serviceable.  Don't forget we still have playmaker Reece and now some WR playmakers.
oaklandraiders,3c55re,Sirscraps,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:25:12 2015 UTC,"Well first off that's an incredibly low bar to set for any player and we shouldn't settle for mediocrity, and second he had just as many bad games as he did good ones but everyone is infatuated with the Kansas City game. I hope Murray has improved But if he comes in next season and Still has issues with his consistency he shouldn't be the starter. I've always liked helu more than Murray though and I've been pretty vocal about it so maybe I have a bias."
oaklandraiders,3c55re,deadlysodium,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:35:16 2015 UTC,"True ... I'm just saying whatever he does will be a huge step up from what we had last year.  I take back serviceable cause he was better than that last year.  I mean he needs to be good, consistent.  A constant performer. Thats what I would like to see from him."
oaklandraiders,3c55re,Sirscraps,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:47:09 2015 UTC,Don't get me wrong I want him to succeed. And I think a huge part of our three wins last season came from his contributions. I got into an arguement on here once when I said McFadden was basically the biggest contributor to our losses because he made us extremely one dimensional and as soon as he was benched teams had to start accounting for our run game. But honestly I think he's the third most talented back on the team(Richardson HAS talent he just needed to put in the work and slim down and take things seriously which he seems to be doing) and helu has always been extremely dangerous throughout his career but for some reason is relegated as a third down back even when out playing his teams starters(last year he should've started over Morris for example). But yeah I'm hoping all this work he's getting as a starter throughout the off season helps him because if we can get him to be an every down back with Richardson Reece and helu our running attack will be awesome.
oaklandraiders,3c55re,theuautumnwind,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:00:20 2015 UTC,Absolutely. That was JJ Watts worst PFF ranked game of the season.
oaklandraiders,3c55re,Niquill,2,Mon Jul 6 20:09:12 2015 UTC,"Gabe Jackson is the right choice, I was watching hi tapes before he played in Oakland, I thought he was solid, but even in his rookie year he surprised me, we need more people like gabe I on the other side of the line"
oaklandraiders,3c55re,GoochGrundle,2,Mon Jul 6 00:40:38 2015 UTC,"Appreciate the feedback. I think Jackson will be our LG for years to come. Great in pass blocking, needs to work on run blocking. Sky's the limit with this kid. Great work ethic, I expect him to produce better numbers under Tice this years. All about the trenches!"
oaklandraiders,3c55re,rebelde_sin_causa,2,Mon Jul 6 04:16:08 2015 UTC,"I dunno if he's a sleeper or not but to me the most ""intriguing"" guy is Mario Edwards.... really all depends on him being the guy we saw at the combine and not the guy we saw on the field last season."

oaklandraiders,3bzf0q,eyememine,2,Fri Jul 3 13:18:42 2015 UTC,"AJ Green is going to be our biggest problem.  Otherwise I'm completely confident we can shut down the running game as good as it is, as that is far and away the strength of our front-7.  That will force Dalton to beat us.  I'm slightly optimistic in our passrush and indifferent about our pass coverage.  Mack will be a beast, we know that.  Tuck will be fresh as its the first game of the season.  Edwards is going to take some time to refine his move.  I like Sio on the blitz but hopefully he's 100% healthy.   But pass-coverage.....we'll have to see how Hayden shapes up and how Nate Allen plays.  Mostly negative things from Eagles fans but we'll see.  Depends on what defense we play as well, I think a cover-3 will suit us better than running man.  Hayden and Allen both have tendencies to get burned.  AJ Green will light it up.   As for our offense vs their defense...no idea.  Their defense is very good, especially when they're all healthy.  Its going to be a grind. I can't imagine Carr lighting it up for 300+ yards, I'm thinking like low to mid 200s.  Their DBs are beasts.   Their D-line and linebackers are also very good but they have holes that we can exploit.  Based on their personnel, they'll be very good at stopping the run, but we can expose their linebackers in coverage with our TEs and with Helu....I'd expect them to  have great games, especially Walford and Helu.   I think we'll see our first Cooper-Carr TD as well on a short red-zone play, although I don't think Cooper ends with over 70 yards. Leon Hall is no joke.   Its going to be a defensive battle.  This is one of the few games where I think home field advantage will determine the winner.    We play significantly better at home.  23-20, us, is my final score"

Ended up changing my flight to Sunday morning and routed it from Burbank to Oakland so that I could attend the game.  I was surprised and actually impressed to see the flight filled with Raider fans that merely flying up for the day to see the team.  I guess my point is I love the Raiders in Oakland, but the team deserves a new stadium compared the turd-hole they play in now.  While I would be immensely sad if they moved to LA, I'd also be happy to fly down to see them 2-3 times a season.  It would suck to not attend every game, but I would take some solace in seeing them play in a state of the art facility. Also, I'd imagine the female fans in LA would be farrrrrr better than the ones I see getting off the BART.  That said, I hope they stay in Oakland.    …and yes, fuck the 49ers"

oaklandraiders,3bxouz,Sadtimesahead,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:21:29 2015 UTC,"Reality is that compared to other owners (Hones, Kraft, etc), Mark doesn't have the same financial means. You want a new stadium? You're going to have to give something up. The only thing of value is the team itself. Multiple teams have minority owners.   This proposal gives Mark the ability to build a stadium in Oakland for the Raiders. None of this shared facility business. He spoke of that previously. He wants a raider hall of fame. He wants to honor his dad's legacy. He wouldn't get that in Santa Clara and won't in Carson.   I think this works for everyone involved. As for the A's, I don't think ownership wants to stay. They have had multiple opportunities with various locations around Oakland. All were turned down. They explored San Jose & Fremont. IMO, I don't know if they would stay if the Raiders left to Carson or San Antonio.   I say build ""Coliseum City"". Give the Raiders a destination. It doesn't have to be Jerry world but something like Heinz Field can work. Force the A's to review their options and possibly build there also. With all of the tech companies moving into downtown Oakland, this is a perfect opportunity. Office space can be occupied by leading tech firms that can turn into stadium naming rights revenue.   Have to break some eggs to make an omelette. Time for Oakland/Alameda to realize that."
oaklandraiders,3bxouz,GoochGrundle,5,Fri Jul 3 17:45:52 2015 UTC,"Lots of assumptions being made here.   The bottom line is that Kephart is trying to use Marks want to stay in Oakland and the fact he isn't as rich as other owners AGAINST him. It makes no sense for the Raiders to give up what hes asking for because, face it, its more profitable for the Raiders to go elsewhere.   This is not a ""good deal for everybody"", I dont understand why this guy thinks he can say that. Hes basically trying to take advantage of the position they're in to become way more profitable himself."
oaklandraiders,3bxouz,simonpheenicks,-1,Fri Jul 3 19:29:37 2015 UTC,The fact that Mark can't do this himself makes it obvious he has to give up something. Also the ENA between City & County expires soon. If they can't get anything done then the city/county/JPA will turn to A's who can make their own stadium. And they have zero desire to share the space with the Raiders. At that point it's return to LA and be second fiddle in a shared stadium.   So yeah it sucks but this is Mark's reality. And it isn't that bad. Sure he has to sell a minority non-voting portion of his team. Yet he would get all revenue from the stadium that the Raiders would own. And he still runs the team. Today  the revenue from game day suites/seats & concessions get split between govt & Raiders. Building up cash is going to take forever. Before the NFL allows the team to languish in poor facilities for 5-15 years you can bet the pressure will be to sell. It hurts the value of the brand and franchises (teams) otherwise.
oaklandraiders,3bxouz,GoochGrundle,2,Sat Jul 4 00:31:48 2015 UTC,"I dont understand why you guys think Mark has no choice. He DOES have a choice here. He is not that desperate to stay in Oakland.   Being in a shared stadium is a much better situation for the team financially,  its not ideal but its definitely not bad enough to force Mark to give up a stake in the team.   This is the best deal for Kephart not the Raiders."
oaklandraiders,3bxouz,simonpheenicks,-1,Sat Jul 4 00:45:45 2015 UTC,"So it sounds as if your in the pro-LA camp. That's fine. Yet Mark has said he wants to stay in Oakland and is ""investigating"" the Carson project. Based upon what he said, and pending any other Oak-based proposals, this is the best option currently.   And who cares about the team finances? Unless you have a vested interest in the Raiders $$$ , what does it matter? As a fan I want them to stay where they started and have the history of previous Oakland teams to be featured in an Oak Stadium."
oaklandraiders,3bxouz,GoochGrundle,2,Sat Jul 4 01:35:29 2015 UTC,"Yet Mark has said he wants to stay in Oakland and is ""investigating"" the Carson project   He is investigating to options he has for the teams stadium. Yeah, he prefers Oakland but why do you believe that that makes it good idea to give up 20% ownership? Thats is bad for the team in every sense to shrink Marks ownership of the team even more.    Based upon what he said, and pending any other Oak-based proposals, this is the best option currently.   It is the ONLY OPTION so far. This the worst deal for Mark in every way.   And who cares about the team finances? Unless you have a vested interest in the Raiders $$$ , what does it matter?    I care about the teams finances because that is literally the reason this quest for the stadium has been so challenging for the team. if you're not worried about how this is going to be profitable then you're being naive.    As a fan I want them to stay where they started and have the history of previous Oakland teams to be featured in an Oak Stadium.   So, you basically just want them to take any deal to stay in Oakland. You think that allowing Kephart to strong-arm is a good deal because of that? None of what you said actually argues this is a good deal, you want Mark to take it purely bc of nostalgia but businesses, which is what this team is at the end of the day, do not work like that."
oaklandraiders,3bxouz,simonpheenicks,0,Sat Jul 4 05:59:10 2015 UTC,"Here it is:   Team is valued at $970M Team wants to construct $900M stadium Team can only put up $200M  Where is the other $700M going to come from? $200M as a loan from NFL G4 fund. So now down to a mere half-billion dollars. What other ""better deals"" are out there now to span this gap?  A stake of some type will need to offered to have funds assembled to cover this funding shortage. You say I'm naive but where does $500M come from? If there are no other deals (which once again has not been made publicly available) then something along FKs proposal will have to occur.   The recouping of multiple hundreds of millions can't be obtained from lease office space and multi-unit housing without being under water on bonds or loans. You say it isn't smart business for Mark yet why would any other entity ask for anything less?   Fact is that a size able percentage of the team will probably need to be offered. Yet?with the value of a NFL franchise, in addition to a wholly owned stadium, the raiders worth can be potentially much more. It's a calculated but necessary risk for the Davis family who don't have the financial means to do it alone. Even the other possible option of Carson requires them to partner with another team. So they are still contingent upon another investor to make any type of new stadium happen.   Sure it's not the best deal. The best would be someone offering the cover the cost of the remaining funds for only stadium naming rights. Yet that isn't going to happen. No free money out there."
oaklandraiders,3bxouz,GoochGrundle,0,Sat Jul 4 07:59:57 2015 UTC,"Fact is that a size able percentage of the team will probably need to be offered   It is AMAZING how many times I have had a reply like this. Where are any of you getting the idea that this is something that Mark HAS TO DO? You say ""fact is..."" but where is the precedent? When has a team EVER given up ownership for a stadium? Its never happened so why on earth would you think that its Marks only option?  All proposals havent even been made yet. If you think that because theres a gap in funding that selling the team is the only way to get there then you obviously dont know much about stadium financing.    This is not the best proposal. Do some more research.   Jerry Jones is worth around $4 billion, AT&T Stadium cost about $1.3 million to build. Do you honestly believe that Jerry Jones paid for that himself?"

oaklandraiders,3bxouz,AH17708,0,Sat Jul 4 06:43:22 2015 UTC,"So one source, Matt Artz, of the Bay Area News group published the initial article panning the proposal. Multiple media outlets just reprinted portions of that. Couple of points from that:  1) the source of determining the ""bad value"" of this plan is the guy who architected the renovations of the coliseum for the Raiders return in '96. Something that is still being paid for 21 years later. I wouldn't take his opinion as anything of value considering how terrible the Mt Davis debt has been for Oakland all of these years. There is still $100 million owned on that.   2) The same guy who posted the original article, Matt Artz, just posted another article TODAY stating the plan could be a GOOD deal if the stadium costs are right. There are 3 additional responses from people that deal with pro sports stadiums beyond the original source. Here is the link:  http://www.mercurynews.com/raiders/ci_28430061/final-stadium-cost-could-determine-if-raiders-deal  So the original leaked info is still under review and all of it is not public. There is communications between Floyd Kephart and Mark Davis that will not be made public. So what is out there may not even be what could be settled on. I would let the process evolve before labeling anything ""terrible""."
oaklandraiders,3bxouz,GoochGrundle,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:10:25 2015 UTC,"Basically Kephart wants a large stake in the team in exchange for a large amount of funding as well as their coliseum city design and all that.   First of all, theres no way Lew Wolff cooperates.  Real estate development is Wolff's forte, and theres no way he's going to let Kephart dictate what happens to his A's.  He's going to cockblock the coliseum site as long as possible with zero fucks given to Kephart, until San Jose opens up, or possibly Jack London Square.  Second, the Warriors are as good as gone.  There is ZERO reason for the Warriors to stay.  Best case scenario, they build some mega coliseum city with all 3 cities with a brand new sick ass arena.  It won't be as lucrative as having a water-front stadium next to AT&T overlooking the Bay Bridge...essentially a 'Sports City' type of complex in that area.    Third:  They are basically trying to hustle mark davis into selling them a large stake in the team so they can get in on an NFL team, which is more lucrative than any real estate, short and long term.  20% of 1bil right now is $200mil.  That investment can more than double in the next 10-20 years.  Its a horrible deal for Mark Davis.  This is my suggestion, that is definitely not going to be popular with Raider fans but I think its the best middle ground for everyone:  Stay at the Coliseum for now.   Yea its a shitty stadium, but its an even worse baseball park.  Yet the A's are willing to stick it out until they find better prospects.  Because business-wise, its the smart thing to do.  As a die-hard A's fan, yea I really want a new stadium, but far and away our biggest complaint is the owners being stingy on how much they spend on the players.   If they spent money on the players, I wouldn't even care about a new stadium.   I'm happy with Mark Davis and how he's willing to invest in the team...pay good coaches, pay for new facilities, etc.   I'm okay with sticking with the coliseum for now.  What I think he should do is: Over time, keep saving up money.  As the team gets better, we win more, we make more money, the prestige and aura of the Raiders comes back, we make more money, our value goes up, and Mark Davis, over the next 10-15 years is able to make up alot of that extra cash. At the same time, we could constantly be negotating with the NFL to get them to finance more into the stadium.  If they cave in 10 years and throw down an additional couple hundred million, while the city of Oakland is willing to spend more, while Mark Davis has more saved up....we could finally get a nice stadium built."

oaklandraiders,3bvlqy,jjohnson8,5,Thu Jul 2 14:47:13 2015 UTC,I was wondering - didn't we have a crap ton of dropped balls from receivers last year? What happens to DCs yards per attempt if you factor those out?
oaklandraiders,3bvlqy,peekay427,5,Thu Jul 2 15:49:15 2015 UTC,"If you account for drops and the 2nd worst YAC/reception in the league it starts to look a lot closer to forgivable. That's why I hate YPA as a marker against QBs when, in reality, it is a offensive unit metric more than anything.  People who cite a low YPA are the ones that I know didn't really watch much game tape. When watching the offense and knowing that it struggles it very rarely felt like Carr was the reason why. He just had nothing to work with and it was more frustrating for him than anybody."
oaklandraiders,3bvlqy,Trapline,3,Thu Jul 2 16:22:13 2015 UTC,"You bring up the points I was thinking of when I asked the question. My biggest criticism of him was that (for whatever reason) he threw a lot of check downs. I don't know if he wasn't seeing open receivers, didn't trust them or was coached to be more conservative. But hopefully with our better WR corps and a mandate to toss it more down the field we will see dramatic improvement in the offense/passing game."
oaklandraiders,3bvlqy,peekay427,3,Thu Jul 2 16:41:29 2015 UTC,"""Toss it more down the field"" he threw the ball 20+ yards more than 60 times last season. It wasn't an issue. Accuracy was the issue not how often he threw deep."

oaklandraiders,3bvlqy,peekay427,3,Thu Jul 2 19:08:14 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue was having receivers that couldn't get any yac. They were the worst in the NFL last season(by far). This year with helu(I mention him because he's very good at getting yac and he's very hard to tackle) Crabtree, Cooper and a healthy rod streater it won't be an issue. Remember often it's better to rely on your playmakers to make plays rather than force a throw(something he would've had to do often since our receivers werent capable of getting seperation), but the team had no playmakers. Also his deep ball accuracy was another issue and if he would've completed about a league average you would've seen his ypa go up by probably a yard or so. His ypa will improve drastically this season lets just hope with better weapons his deep ball accuracy also improves."
oaklandraiders,3bvlqy,Sirscraps,4,Thu Jul 2 19:19:17 2015 UTC,I really hope the Raiders make strides this year.  I've been a fan all my life and the last 12 years have been torture.  Even when they were mediocre in the late 80's and mid 90's they were competitive.  They had good players.    It rests on Carr.  You need a QB to win for the most part.  They've given him huge upgrades at weapons.  And if Murray is healthy and plays that will help him immensely.    I can't wait to see how they play on the field.  Go RAIDERS!

oaklandraiders,3btp5k,Spastic_colon,2,Thu Jul 2 12:40:33 2015 UTC,"I think we'll beat Minnesota at home, but not necessarily go 8-8. Division play will be key."
oaklandraiders,3btp5k,rishiswaz,3,Thu Jul 2 18:32:07 2015 UTC,"We can realistically split the chiefs and chargers, the broncos I expect two losses. A lot of the tough games will be at home so there is that too. I am penning it at 5-11 at worst 9-7 at very best with 7-9 looking reasonable."
oaklandraiders,3btp5k,Spastic_colon,2,Thu Jul 2 20:46:34 2015 UTC,"I feel like I am probably in your camp, I do think we'll turn a corner this season, and (hopefully) be a real threat as soon as next season. Homerism maybe, but I think we don't get enough credit with our current roster."
oaklandraiders,3btp5k,rishiswaz,3,Thu Jul 2 20:51:15 2015 UTC,"Here are the logical (with a bit of homerism) reasons I think 7-9 seems realistic   We got a really good left side of the line and the right side should improve with Howard returning to his natural position and depending on if Feliciano pans out the way I hope he will. Watson and Barns are good depth/rotation players and can plug-in on the right side if and when they are needed. But we have no real depth outside of those two, the next man up past them is JaMarcus Webb IIRC.  Clive Walford seems like another good TE out of The U, him and Rivera will be a good twin TE package with Smith able to plug in on the strong side for Jumbo sets or run packages. But there is Rivera's tendency to drop passes, Smith is a one trick pony who is pretty good at his trick and can help the counter or reverse game but doesn't really have much utility, and Walford is still an unknown commodity with the only assumptions about his skill being from college tape.  Cooper, Streater, and Crabs seem like a much much better receiving corps which should help stretch the field and open up the run game more. At the same time Streater needs more time with Carr which he should get in training camp barring another injury, but I am not sure if it will be enough, and Crabs is coming off a season where he was obviously playing with discomfort from his previous injury and it is yet to be seen how he does against real defenders, and Cooper is also still an unknown commodity even though he looks like the real deal we won't know until we see some real action.  With more passing options and a good line the run game should open up some more which will let Murray really show his ability. Weak side runs where we have Jackson and Penn might be frequent due to the weaker strong side of the line but I am also expecting outside runs to really let him show off his wheels.  Defense seems a lot better, We got Dan Williams, Mario Edwards Jr. seems like a risky gamble in the second round but the pick is warming up to me and I hope to be pleasantly surprised, Tuck seems to be doing well and providing good veteran leadership, coupled with Jelly and Mack getting more experience under their belts and being able to put on the football physique instead of the combine physique we should have a good pass rush. Curtis Lofton is a tackling machine and should do a good job stepping back into the zone coverage or helping run stuffing when needed, Sio Moore is Sio Moore and continues to improve and provide energy on the defensive side of the ball.   The biggest question mark on defense is the secondary, inexperienced corners along with NOSDOOM getting older and Nate Allen's propensity to make mistakes as often as big plays doesn't inspire much confidence and in a division with PFM and Filipe Rios there is going to be a lot of passing.  Return game was pretty weak last year which set us up in pretty bad field position even when the defense made a clutch stop so adding Holliday I think will reinvigorate that aspect of the ball because you can't win games without ST stepping up. Janikowski is still good for a while and I don't think we need to worry too much about him. King seems to be a solid punter and can boom it pretty far, hopefully he works on accuracy (when against a rush) to be able to place the ball in the corners and minimize potential for a big return."

The Jags were one of the elite defenses in the league while he was there.   Their defense was on par with Baltimore, Pittsburgh, and New England in those years.    Pitt and NE had the best QBs of the bunch and thats why they won the most. Even if you look at Baltimore before they got Flacco, they were as up and down as the Jags. The Jags defense as good as it was was also constantly banged up.   If they were healthy and they had a somewhat decent QB, I think he would've been alot more successful.   Bottom line is, he coaches fundamentals and he motivates guys to play their best.  That was our biggest fault the last 10 years.  No fundamentals, no real sense of discipline, poor coaching, no develoment.   Our current coaching staff is miles better than anything we've had since Gruden."

The leak was only a partial leak of the proposal and it's all smoke and mirrors by shitty politicians lining their pockets on a side deal with current A's ownership.  The real hope is that A's are forced to sell to Lacob who would go in on the coliseum city Vision with the Raiders.  Fuck the leaker and the bottom line is, Mark Davis would still be majority owner and have final say on all things Raiders.   If that 20% stake gets a new stadium in Oakland with zero taxpayer dollars, how can anyone seriously complain about that?"

Den We got Foxless Denver's Defensive Coordinator, and the bronks either change their whole D scheme or we will kill them absolutely.  They have a new offense, and new offense means new reads / new tricks for old dogs... This season Manning will fail/fall harder than Omaha crude futures did in the 1930's.  SD Rivers is on his last leg, and up his name without a paddle, prayer,  or a promise from his Owner AG Spano's. (an old old boss of mine) other than a chance to retire with a penitence of what Phill feels Lipp deserves. With that, him and McCoy Mike don't seem to be on the same page all of the sudden, if the mini comp trains were any indication... Plus, if anyone knows Mike and SD's scheme, it's our New HC...  KC They are up against a wall with a hard schedule of Reid Beaters, without a proven center, or QB playing consistently. Believe me there are some NFC Contenders on the list with bones to pick with the ex philly Steak man, and who are licking their chops at the prospect of some well aged KC mis-steaks with plenty of sideline opportunities for seconds and thirds. and guess who they get to play the following week? yea man, and It wasn't a fluke we beat them with a solid running game last year either. Oh and guess who knows Alex's snap count? the guy who won't be snappin to him.  IT'S REDRUM TIME!"

oaklandraiders,3bkdyb,Sirscraps,3,Mon Jun 29 23:10:12 2015 UTC,Which is a decent strategy.  But makes me uncomfortable haha.  I guess my next question would be don't we have a chunk of money left to spend?   Not that Mathis is necessarily worth it

I know everyone is writing him off, but we have a new, state of the art conditioning program and hopefully they can get him where he needs to be. He's still a young guy, with a lot of potential, and we could end up with the good T-Rich for a discount price. We won't know anything until camp starts, though."

oaklandraiders,3bbuwd,Passion4Flashin,10,Mon Jun 29 04:06:42 2015 UTC,I hope no one on this sub is comfortable with our CB's for a whole season. They need to prove they can play a whole season

oaklandraiders,3bbuwd,Niquill,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:37:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone is. It's clearly the weakest position on the team, outside of maybe RG and I guess dedicated DE/W9 pass rusher"
oaklandraiders,3bbuwd,FootballAnalysis,7,Sat Jun 27 20:54:08 2015 UTC,"Hayden has a injury history, why would you not give the other corners a few more reps with the first team, while keeping Hayden healthy. It's a win-win situation. I'll believe he's not the starter when the coaches put him on the pine in an actual game."
oaklandraiders,3bbuwd,aliphbata,3,Sat Jun 27 20:56:27 2015 UTC,"Reading the article it seems that Hayden was playing with second team for a large portion of camp, if they want to give Mcgill time with first team wouldn't it make more sense for Carrie to practice with second team"
oaklandraiders,3bbuwd,SphincterKing,4,Sun Jun 28 18:24:33 2015 UTC,"No, Carrie is the best corner on the team. He has earned his spot. Hayden and McGill's positions are up in the air."
oaklandraiders,3bbuwd,JudgeJBS,3,Sat Jun 27 20:12:57 2015 UTC,"yup, TJ is legit, he held his own last year, possibly the best corner on the sqaud."
oaklandraiders,3bbuwd,JudgeJBS,3,Sat Jun 27 20:55:35 2015 UTC,"This is simply regurgitating the Bill Williamson report from earlier this week. Williamson covers the entire AFC West for ESPN, and has never been particularly insightful about the Raiders in particular. There are no quotes from coaches or front office people suggesting that Hayden is on the outs.   In other words, take this with a grain of salt."

Given where SSD's are, and that he bought a higher end one, and higher capacity, the chances of it failing randomly before it's end of life are slim to none.  Then on top of that, lets say one does fail.  It will take 20-30 minutes to install windows and another 30 minutes to an hour to download/reinstall everything you had on it before.  I doubt he actually has TB's worth of data stored on it, but in the off chance he does, if it's backed up, still will only take another 30 minutes to restore all of that.  At worst, you're looking at a few hours tops to be back in the same position you were before, assuming you don't wait for the replacement SSD to show up.  People are still stuck on the dial-up/DSL and 5200rpm HDD era where if a disk in raid0 failed it'd take a week or two to be up and running again but it's just not the case anymore."

oaklandraiders,3baecf,BruhMyCarrrrrr,12,Sat Jun 27 08:40:50 2015 UTC,200 million for 20 percent seems way too cheap. I think the NFL would rather see the Raiders in LA if Mark is effectively going to self fund the stadium.
oaklandraiders,3baecf,Electric_Pegasus,7,Sat Jun 27 09:56:24 2015 UTC,That's a slap in the face if you ask me. And parking garages? I rather have them move to Carson
oaklandraiders,3baecf,Knightvision27,11,Sat Jun 27 14:59:08 2015 UTC,"It reminds me of the way a shady car dealer tries to take advantage of someone with poor credit.  Selling someone an over priced lemon at 20% interest.  Do you think the Raider would be being treated like this by them, Oakland, Alameda, or the NFL if we had been in the playoffs in the last three years?  We're not in good position to deal.  I feel for Mark."
oaklandraiders,3baecf,BlondTigerCage,7,Sat Jun 27 10:08:16 2015 UTC,"Meh, Oakland didn't give the Raiders a stadium when they were the winningest team in football of course they are treating the Raiders like shit right now.   For better or worse getting a stadium deal done in California is just a lot more complected than in other places. Personally if a deal doesn't get done in Oakland I think the league will make it so the Raiders move in with the Rams. I imagine Kroenke would be more than willing to share if it meant that he had the league's support to move."

oaklandraiders,3baecf,VegasRon,2,Sat Jun 27 20:04:16 2015 UTC,Sounds like a good deal to me
oaklandraiders,3baecf,mandingoBBC,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:14:18 2015 UTC,"20% of the team for 200 million? That would give an estimated value of the Raiders of 1 billion dollars. Last estimates I heard was that the Raiders were worth at most 800 million. For a team with a losing record for the past decade and playing in a small market in the oldest stadium in the league, 20% for 200 million seems fair.   Now the rest of the deal isn't ideal. Any developer looking to build with Oakland and the Raiders are going to low ball  and present an 'unfair' deal. The Raiders and Alameda don't have much to negotiate with, it's business if you're going to buy something you want to pay the lowest price.   Honestly unless we start winning and become ""the"" team gaining endorsement causing the Raiders to print money Davis is going to have to sell a large stake in the team. Either to build in Carson, Oakland, or elsewhere, he simply doesn't have the capital and cash flow."
oaklandraiders,3baecf,hate_sf_hobos,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:34:18 2015 UTC,"But they wouldn't be playing in the oldest stadium in the NFL if he got the 20%, the value is based of them playing in a new stadium."
oaklandraiders,3baecf,SpeedBias,0,Sat Jun 27 15:44:47 2015 UTC,"Without the deal there is no stadium. The sale of 20% is needed to just get the funding to build the stadium, but the offer is against their current value."

oaklandraiders,3baecf,Electric_Pegasus,2,Sat Jun 27 17:21:25 2015 UTC,The offer itself is a non-starter. Its beyond insulting. No team has ever had to sell part ownership for a STADIUM and they never will.

LA wants teams to win immediately and when they don't, people get mad.The lakers won 5 years ago but a couple bad seasons made a lot of fans trade their Kobe jerseys for griffin jerseys.

Sometimes you just really need that though and so I'm glad he's been working his ass off because even if he's not getting burn on the field offensively he's making a difference on special teams and people forget how important that aspect of the game it really is.

I said yes and not to tell the family because they have enough on their plate, but Im pretty sure thats the first thing she did...  The girl I was seeing also ended it saying I have trust issues...  I wonder if these are connected"
oaklandraiders,3b7bo9,ItsMajorObviousNow,5,Fri Jun 26 17:20:22 2015 UTC,"That's really unfortunate. I can't handle gossip types and it's incredibly frustrating when they are loved ones.  Beyond that, I can only offer optimism. As a suicide survivor I'm so happy to be alive right now - and pretty genuinely free of the malaise that used to hover over my entire life. If you ever need to talk to somebody who has been down there in the shit you just let me know."
oaklandraiders,3b7bo9,Trapline,3,Fri Jun 26 18:28:36 2015 UTC,Thanks man. Luckily I have never seen that as option. I just want to stop feeling apathetic towards everything and be able to focus without swings from feeling like a boss to feeling like Im less than shit.
oaklandraiders,3b7bo9,ItsMajorObviousNow,5,Fri Jun 26 18:58:05 2015 UTC,The first step is just knowing that you're always a boss. Boom. Next step is act like the fucking boss you are all the time.

oaklandraiders,3b7bo9,Zillergrizz,2,Sat Jun 27 05:17:43 2015 UTC,"It's entirely possible. I still have pretty bad depressive episodes every now and then, but I used to be much worse and it was a pretty bad cycle. I couldn't really trust anyone because of shit that happened to me as a kid, which led to me being distant and acting weird and anxious and driving people away, which led to me not trusting people...it's rough.  My advice is to use the medicine to find other ways to help when it gets rough and try to keep usage temporary. The medicine helps and sometimes it's all you need, but you don't want to accidentally train your body to rely on it to be happy. I started doing more solo activities like drawing, playing the guitar, and writing, and I'm sure there's something like that that can help you, too :)"
oaklandraiders,3b7bo9,sio-kedelic,3,Fri Jun 26 18:04:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, hopefully the doctor can help me out but Ive heard Kaiser isn't very good about this stuff. I would prefer not to be on meds but the toughing it out isn't working. I cant focus because my brain is always in a fog and unable to absorb knowledge or firing off way to many thoughts to stay on topic."
oaklandraiders,3b7bo9,ItsMajorObviousNow,2,Fri Jun 26 18:09:37 2015 UTC,"People with Diabetes take insulin. People with Crohn's take Remicade. Taking meds for an illness ain't nothing to be ashamed of. You can't just tough out illnesses.   Now what you can do is what you are doing now. Putting yourself in the best situation possible to get better. If that includes meds, so be it. You're doing the right thing man. Keep it up."
oaklandraiders,3b7bo9,ItsMajorObviousNow,3,Fri Jun 26 22:37:06 2015 UTC,My biggest fear is being misdiagnosed or given the wrong stuff that puts me even more out of it. I operate heavy machinery and dont want to be at risk.
oaklandraiders,3b7bo9,sio-kedelic,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:46:34 2015 UTC,"Absolutely valid concern. I can tell you from experience that doctors will start out slow when it comes to meds. Be on the lookout for how meds interact with you because they don't affect everyone in the same way. Hopefully it won't be necessary but if it is, just remember not to succumb to the whole ""I'm tough and don't need it"" mentality. It shows more fortitude to go and get help than it does to not.   OK old guy advice off... Best of luck to you man."
oaklandraiders,3b7bo9,BoKnowsYourMom,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:00:57 2015 UTC,"To be honest, Kaiser sucks at it. They'll either hand you whatever you ask for or require therapy that can't possibly help with how few of sessions they give.  But, on the bright side, you'll get to ease into your stuff pretty much whenever you go, and it's better to go in now and at least get a bit of neurochemical balance so your body remembers what it's supposed to do. Good luck!"

The one advantage Oakland has over San Diego and St. Louis is that Davis is the only one of the three owners who legitimately wants to stay and is working hard towards that end.   I'd say there's a 99% chance the Rams move to LA, an 80% chance the Chargers do, but I have no idea what will happen to the Raiders. They are really the wildcard in this whole thing."

oaklandraiders,3b5yx2,Sirscraps,3,Tue Jun 30 08:21:35 2015 UTC,Their has been literally zero push for San Antonio(which was originally just a scare tactic by Davis anyways) or st Louis and it's much MUCH more likely that the raiders would decide to stay put in Oakland then uproot the franchise and alienate their entire fan base.

oaklandraiders,3b5gy4,Cali4NiYay,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:27:01 2015 UTC,Amtrak goes directly the coliseum though
oaklandraiders,3b5gy4,DieHardRaider,3,Mon Jun 29 00:38:06 2015 UTC,Im sure you could find a greyhound or something That'll take forever though. I know there might be amtrak too. Its worth checking out. Its like 3 hours which is only one more hour than driving and I believe it lets off by O.co  Edit: Search MRY to OAC  For instance the a Baltimore game On 9/20 looks to be about $52 roundtrip but the times wont work

oaklandraiders,3b5gy4,ItsMajorObviousNow,2,Fri Jun 26 03:41:48 2015 UTC,"No problem. One of the few things I've learned from having gone to school in Monterey and living near Oakland  Edit: http://www.amtrak.com/station-search-results 1,2, & 3 might be closer to the DLI. Again search Monterey, CA"
oaklandraiders,3b5gy4,Vryk0lakas,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:44:12 2015 UTC,Thanks again!
oaklandraiders,3b5gy4,ziggy88,3,Fri Jun 26 03:54:06 2015 UTC,I went to DLI just a few years ago. It is an amazing experience. They actually sell Raiders tickets on post and some games they have a bus that goes all the way there. Check with mwr once yiur settled in. Also study your freaking ass off that school is no joke.
oaklandraiders,3b5gy4,Jose_xixpac,3,Fri Jun 26 04:21:48 2015 UTC,So I've heard. Thank you!
oaklandraiders,3b5gy4,mthrfkn,2,Fri Jun 26 04:25:04 2015 UTC,You also might check with people at DLI that are Raider fans or just want to go to the game. I know Fort Hunter Liggett has a van that goes up the to the games.

oaklandraiders,3b5oqx,Kaner222,8,Fri Jun 26 05:20:03 2015 UTC,Alright. Everyone have to stab twice as much now since Rick got caught
