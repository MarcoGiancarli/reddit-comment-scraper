lootcrate,3e4sql,hikkachu,8,Tue Jul 21 23:24:20 2015 UTC,Everyone got that one
lootcrate,3e4sql,nosfan9,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:51:59 2015 UTC,Was there a variety? I thought Batman was the only figure. That Catwoman Q-Pop is cute as hell though.
lootcrate,3e4azf,Gerard_Joling,2,Tue Jul 21 21:12:49 2015 UTC,You should check out /r/brawlhalla!
lootcrate,3e4azf,eleetpancake,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:47:38 2015 UTC,PMed you
lootcrate,3e4azf,Finnthehuman26,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:54:34 2015 UTC,If anybody else wants the code let me know.
lootcrate,3e3y0r,Finnthehuman26,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:42:15 2015 UTC,Just wait. I never got a confirmation or tracking info and I just received mine today.
lootcrate,3e3y0r,Devuh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:05:33 2015 UTC,"Tracking should all be sent out by the 21st each month, so today. If you don't receive tracking today, contact support tomorrow."
lootcrate,3e3x79,AuburnUb93,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:36:53 2015 UTC,"Any idea if they refund x amount for the months/boxes you had left? Planning on getting 1 more of my 7 I have left for my subscription and canceling then, due to unforseen circumstances. Enjoyed my boxes a ton though... will be sorely missed"
lootcrate,3e3x79,xxBittlexx,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:06:49 2015 UTC,It said on there that you would still get whatever you had paid for already. I was only doing one month sub.
lootcrate,3e3x79,xxBittlexx,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:18:52 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, thank you very much for the insight."
lootcrate,3e3rz3,tstilly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:01:24 2015 UTC,I'll pm you when I get off work with my code.  If you haven't got one already.
lootcrate,3e3rz3,lsmallsl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:19:01 2015 UTC,"No I haven't, but thank you so much!"

lootcrate,3e3rz3,BigMonkeyNewsstand,2,Tue Jul 21 19:26:51 2015 UTC,PM'd.
lootcrate,3e3rz3,vidyagameking,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:54:22 2015 UTC,Wait where was the brawlhalla skin code I completely missed that.
lootcrate,3e3rz3,CoolJoe16,0,Tue Jul 21 19:31:40 2015 UTC,"It had a picture of gnash on it, maybe it was flat at the bottom of the crate?"
lootcrate,3e4i1f,Deloli,11,Tue Jul 21 22:03:09 2015 UTC,"The problem is the box can't make everyone happy.  We on the other hand were very happy with it. Hubby LOVES Batman so the figure and keychain make him very happy.  My 11 year old loves the zelda sweatband and wore it to school today. The poster I'm putting over my daughters bed, has a great message on it for any little girl.  The book I haven't read yet, but we were very impressed with the size and the fact it's a hardback. Overall for us a very good box."
lootcrate,3e4i1f,Mrbadexample86,5,Tue Jul 21 22:27:07 2015 UTC,Exactly. They can't please 100 percent of the people receiving the box. I thought this crate was a huge success.
lootcrate,3e4i1f,Epicninja0101,0,Tue Jul 21 23:03:55 2015 UTC,"I totally agree that they can't please everyone, but they need to provide at least a little higher quality product. I feel that things like sweatbands are useless to most people and should be left out of things like lootcrate. It may be better if they try to please a certain majority with each crate rather than everyone with every crate. But hey, I'm just one guy. I'm glad that at least one person was as happy with this crate as you are."
lootcrate,3e4i1f,Suicidalparrot,4,Wed Jul 22 05:09:09 2015 UTC,"If you've never been this disappointed in a crate, why would one disappointment cause you to unsubscribe? It's the way of the mystery box.  There will inevitably be one or more that aren't as interesting to you as others. It's sort of the risk you knowingly take on when you subscribe. They can't please everybody every time. Now if it's a few in a row that seriously suck, then it becomes a problem."
lootcrate,3e4i1f,tingly_legalos,3,Tue Jul 21 22:56:43 2015 UTC,I'll take the batman and star trek stuff off of your hands for you!
lootcrate,3e4i1f,eykntspel,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:17:20 2015 UTC,"Besides socks, and shirts, which they'll classify as shirts, they never have any good wearables. it's always something that very few people would actually wear. I want something I'd be able to wear all the time, not just very few occasions when sweat my drip down one hand.  Also, the poster, I think fine for the females so I can't really complain since they'd like it but I can't see myself hanging it up, I also don't have any female friends that would want it.  Another digital code for a game few people play.  I got excited when I heard there would be a hardcover book because getting Ready Player one from a previous crate was a hugely fantastic surprise, I was thinking it would be something along those lines. Instead we get a comic book type hardcover book (I havent actually read it but my friend says it's full of lame superheros that no one knows.)  The airfreshener I might put up somewhere.  The batarang is too big and heavy to realistically have on a keychain.  The only thing I really liked from this was the batman statue just because I like the collectible stuff that I can put up with all my other collectibles.  This month was, in my opinion, the worst crate I've gotten. I've been subscribed since heros 1 and that was such a perfect one and they messed this up.  Very dissapoint."
lootcrate,3e4i1f,fluid_vortex,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:42:14 2015 UTC,"i was pretty disappointed by no shirt.  this is only my fourth crate but the t-shirt was always the biggest value to me.  without it...the risk of receiving a box of junk I don't want/like is too great.  with a shirt in the box i know I'll at least be expanding my wardrobe by a shirt every month...very easy to justify, and very easy to feel good about tossing out the stuff I don't want.  I have enough junk - I don't need to subscribe to monthly junk.  is there a way to know if the crate will have a shirt in advance so I can cancel?  it really is worthless to me without it.  edit: spelling"
lootcrate,3e4i1f,Sirsilentbob423,3,Tue Jul 21 22:41:58 2015 UTC,"See, I on the other hand know that when a shirt is included the rest is probably gonna be crap.  To each their own really."
lootcrate,3e4i1f,Slusho64,2,Wed Jul 22 04:53:35 2015 UTC,Well they said somewhere that it would have a hardcover book so I was pretty sure they weren't going to put a shirt into this one. Although they probably said that too late to cancel.
lootcrate,3e4i1f,Epicninja0101,0,Wed Jul 22 00:09:50 2015 UTC,"If Lootcrate doesn't step up it game next month and provide more high quality items, I will unsubscribe. This is my second crate and both have been horrible. I skipped last month due to money constraints but decided to go back this month as I had my birthday recently and got lots of cash from my family. The air freshener is useless to me as I don't have a car, the poster is useless to me as I don't really like Wonder Woman, the sweatband is useless as it's very tacky, I haven't read the book but it looks appealing enough and the figurine is very nice. Overall a 2 of 10. (Sorry for the rant. I'm pretty pissed off that I spent so much on some stuff worth so little and I was just looking for a place to vent.)"
lootcrate,3e0bts,stellarwarlord,2,Mon Jul 20 23:48:59 2015 UTC,"It's like 50/50 if I get a tracking info.  If you do get one it'll be to your sub email and be Cleary stated ""lootcrate tracking infomation"""

lootcrate,3dra1y,tfrthessd,5,Sat Jul 18 18:18:03 2015 UTC,Same here. I really liked it
lootcrate,3dra1y,SilentJoe1986,3,Sat Jul 18 19:22:19 2015 UTC,"Same here, I really dug it."
lootcrate,3dra1y,dantehicks36,2,Sat Jul 18 20:31:41 2015 UTC,My favorite box to date. Loved all of the larger items and the whole thing really felt well worth the price.
lootcrate,3dra1y,TheOneBlueGecko,2,Mon Jul 20 23:32:09 2015 UTC,This is my favourite I've gotten so far. My fifth crate of a six month subscription. Wish all of them were this good and I would've resubscribed.
lootcrate,3dra1y,welcometooceania,2,Mon Jul 20 23:49:31 2015 UTC,"I live in Australia and usually I get my LootCrate roughly three weeks after everyone else does, but I was really surprised that mine came this morning.  Hope that this keeps up for the remainder of my subscription, it may be the incentive to re-subscribe for it."

lootcrate,3dra1y,jagilki,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:10:10 2015 UTC,Got mine today too!  It was roughed up a bit so I'm not sure if anything was missing...but I checked the loot crate magazine and It looks like everything was in there.
