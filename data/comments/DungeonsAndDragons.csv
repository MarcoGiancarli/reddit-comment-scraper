Is there anything in particular you're wanting to know?  If he wants Shinobi as in the historical kind then Rogue-Thief for always having a trick up their sleeve or Rogue-Assassin for being a master of disguise and deception fit the bill perfectly.   If instead you mean the fantasy Video Game/Anime kind then a Monk-Way of the Shadows is for your supernatural stealthy warrior type and Monk-Way of the For Elements or a Rogue-Arcane Trickster gives you a more straight up 'magic warrior' option.   Not knowing what type of game/setting you're running can't give much advice there other than to try to work out an interesting reason they'd be far from home if they're not usual for the place you're setting your game. Exile, being sent on a quest to recover a long lost relic, hunting down a traitor who fled their homeland, etc. Helps to make them 'belong' in the setting a little more and can give you a fun plot hook to use later on."

Citadel paints are pretty good standard through out the color range some a bit better than others.   Pro's pretty good coverage, great metals & washes. Cons They don't have a dropper bottle & need the most thinning before painting, I can't get their white to like me.   Reaper.  Pros Dropper bottles, paints nice & thin, come in triads so make working out shading & highlighting easier for a beginner.  Cons paints are thin so you use a lot of thin coats to get coverage (this can be a pro I actually like this a lot of people don't) I have found they can tend to chalkiness in some colors, if you build up layers too fast.   Vallejo Pro's Huge range of colors.  Good washes & metallics. Dropper bottles.  Cons Color quality can be a little hit or miss depending on the color. Need lots of shaking to get pigment mixed through as separate easily.   P3.  Pros.  Nice paint, nice thickness, good coverage.  Cons' No dropper & not a wide range of colors.   Army Painter Pros' Dropper bottles. Excellent coverage, don't need much thinning, great for painting lots of troops.  Cons.  Covers too well making blending hard (at least for me), can be a smidge chalky in some colors, not a fan of the washes/Inks."

Since there were only two people, the DM decided to just do a one shot where an army of Zombie Hands were coming towards our town. The hands had to cross through a forest, so the other player and I bought barrels of oil, spreading the oil everywhere we could  in the forest, as a trap. When the zombie hands got to the forest, we lit the oil... which, while successfully killing the zombie hands, mixed with their magical energies to create an entire forest that is constantly burning, forever.

DungeonsAndDragons,3dlu87,RukiTanuki,11,Fri Jul 17 14:38:07 2015 UTC,"I was just role playing a character as best as I could   My personal viewpoint on this hobby is thus:  1) You voluntarily select the actions for your character. It is important to never forget this.  2) Your primary goal in the group (again, in my opinion) is to entertain and be entertained by the other players.  3) Thus, it's an imperative to select actions that first make the game more entertaining for as much of the group as possible, and second, fit your understanding of your character.  Corollary: It is also your responsibility to select a character whose inclusion in the adventure will be entertaining for both you and others, i.e. to not select a character that will negatively impact the experience for others.  4) At any given moment, given a little thought, you can probably think of a dozen different actions that would be perfectly in character for your PC.  5) Thus, actions that are detrimental to the group's overall enjoyment (such as killing their PCs) are in no way excused by ""that's what my character would have done."""

Boom, this right here. OP, this responsibility is on the whole group. You shouldn't have killed their characters, given that they were upset because of it. They shouldn't have attacked you, provoking a counter attack because it probably was frustrating. You shouldn't be playing a character whose end goal is to achieve total power, even at the expense of your own party members. How would you feel if one of the other players did that, and proceeded to just kill your character because ""it's what my character would do?"" When you think about it, this just simply doesn't facilitate fun. No one should be sitting at D&D grudgingly accepting that their character died because someone else decided to play an evil character. You should either be finding a way to make your character's motives inclusive so that the whole party gets to cooperate with you, or you should just drop the whole power thing altogether."

Like one guy in my group often plays a very pick-pockety thief, while he does steal loot he purposefully just takes the one 'shiniest' thing, like stealing the diamond in a stash of gold.

DungeonsAndDragons,3dlu87,Lexarius,13,Fri Jul 17 22:08:28 2015 UTC,"just a heads up.. PC killing gets old really quick. And if the other players didnt enjoy their characters getting killed by you, it can ruin games / game groups pretty quick. Thread carefully.  Personally id be pretty dissapointed if another PC killed my character. Even tho it might make sense for the other players character to make that choice. The thing with character death is that it can either be:   Funny (one time i had a rouge that fell of a balcony to his death, was my bad, jump distance misjudge). It can be an epic part of the story. 1 Character having to sacrifice his life or something.. Rearly happens in games, because few dm`s / players are able to pull it off in a meaningfull way. Random / unsatisfying death. Randomly dying in a fight that isnt really significant to the story. Having other players kill you etc. This simply feels like loss of control of your own characters story. Especially if another player kills your character.   If I was in your gaming group and 1 player killed 3 other characters in the second session of the campaign (even if the DM sorta set it up), I would most likley be out the door.  edit: this is why i never allow chaotic evil / neutral evil characters.. they just tend to become psychotic serial killers of major havoc. and never plays well with the other characters."

The gold payout wasn't the best, I think something around 100 gold each, nothing worth the demon encounter.

DungeonsAndDragons,3dlu87,hung_like_an_ant,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:05:51 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about it, there is massive bias against inter-party conflict on this sub; especially killing of party members. To be fair, it is mostly justified, but for some groups, it is ok in certain situations as long as everyone in the group is ok with it. This sub seems to have a non-tolerance policy though.  In my home group for example, my friend designed a whole campaign meant to sow distrust within the party; that was the whole point, and we all loved it because that's we enjoy that distrust and trying to figure out who's actually on your side aspect of it.  The point is, if you and your whole group all enjoy something, then even if everyone else is telling you ""no, you shouldn't do that"", ignore them. The point of the game is to have fun, as long as you are all having fun in your group (all, not just one or two people) then do whatever it is that makes it fun."
DungeonsAndDragons,3dlu87,Tonnot98,2,Fri Jul 17 21:26:48 2015 UTC,"Its not a bias against killing of characters as much as a bias against the game ""slowing down""  The thing with voilent interparty conflict is that it slows down everything in the game. Especially decisionmaking processes (because distrust) and story progression (Someone has to get a new character cause their original one has been murdered). The DM and a player has to set up new organic plot-hooks to awkwardly place and introduce this new character in the same group as the old ones (why the fuck would he hang out with people that murdered their last comerades?).  Personally I am all about roleplaying incharacter drama (political, idealist, realigious differences and such between characters) but everytime a character dies in a non-meaningfull way (not part of the major story arc) the campaign looses continuity and progression slows down. Then again I like playing with people that roleplay conflicts, but also understand the cooperative effort of collaborative storytelling. However if you play with people that enjoy pvp, GO FOR IT, the game is meant to be played how you enjoy it. But to my experience more often than not, someone who gets their character killed will eventually get annoyed. I suggest you get a firm grasp on wheter the other player enjoy PvP aswell.   My experiences with characters murdering characters usually have been that the campaign ends shortly after, Due to the fact that the GM gets sick of trying to build a story around characters that have a life expetancy of a mayfly. As I and the people i play with have gotten older, PvP just never happens, and that is due to everyone have had similar experiences and its unspokenly agreed upon that it tends to ruin story-progression oriented games.  Its my suspicion that this subreddit shares my enjoyment of character and story-progression and thus are ""biased"" against PvP. Think about it: wouldnt be very much of an epic in starwars if luke and han solo just killed eachother because they couldnt accept that they were different and saw no way to work togather."

Then a 2nd wave, jsut as powerful as the first comes to soak up any remaining abilities and healing surges and hopefully knock a few characters down. Finally, right about the time things look hopeless the third cleanup wave was supposed to come and wipe things up and capture the party. However, my players completely out maneuvered the enemy and ended up still standing after all 3 waves were decimated. I stopped the game for the day and told them, I had more planned but you guys just defied odds and changed your fates. While I did have this part of the story planned out, I didn't want to box my characters in. They rose to the challenge and I wanted to reward them, not use some gimmick or ""dm rules"".

Every so often, I'd have the PCs roll checks to see if they noticed anything off about the new guy. None of them ever had much success (rogues are strange to begin with).   When the army did invade, the PCs were shocked to see their defenses crumbling. In order to save them, the group had to split up. One by one the new player went and fought the PCs. When he stabbed the first player in the back, the room was silent. Ultimately he killed two, one of which ended up getting revived anyways, before the fighter put a sword through his heart.   It was a calculated risk. I knew if I did not pull it off well, the dynamic of my game might have been permanently broken."

I decided the best way to get any power or status in the world was to make friends with powerful people. So I decided to go to the port of the town and walk onto either the red or blue pirate ship. I chose blue. I acted like I was meant to be there and managed to walk straight into the Captain's quarters. I asked him to be my friend. When he said no and turned his back on me, I pulled my knife out and stabbed him in the neck, down through the part by the collarbone. He had been unfriendly, and I wanted to try out my sneak attack. It didn't kill him. He screamed and I jumped to hide in a chest. I was found, beaten, and thrown in the cellars of the bottom of the ship. Turns out that captain was the good one and a major character in helping the rest of the party in the campaign. I didn't really get along with the paladin in the party..."

He was playing a lawful character and we'd iterated the importance of playing in character so he thought this was absolute. It also took him a while to grasp the nuance of how to act in character combined with not screwing over other players/making the game fun. Anyway the rest of the group basically decided to double cross the local guard, he protested and we ignored him. So he sold us out. But he didn't just sell us out, oh no, he went so damn far. He spent multiple sessions setting each and every one of us up, resulting in us at all being captured red-handed in the middle of completing our deal with the thieves guild. It was at that moment that the dm stood up, gave my bro all his dm paperwork and swapped places. We continued the campaign with my bro as the DM with his character being an npc, and the previous DM took over an npc that had been travelling with us. Weird, very weird. Also didn't really work, turns out players who've only played 10 sessions don't make good dm's. Go figure"
DungeonsAndDragons,3dlu87,thalionisathief,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:05:23 2015 UTC,"As a player: Years ago, as a 4e sorcerer, I was very fond of my at will: Acid Splash. Oh, how I loved that power. I was also known for rolling a lot of 1s in combat and as a group we had decided on having a chart for Critical Hits and Critical Misses. One time in particular, I rolled a 1 on my attack roll, rolled a percentage for the miss somewhere in the high 90's...and acidic-ally burned out the eye of our cleric who, both RP-wise and ability wise, did nothing but heal. Well, that didnt go over well with the group, but we went on our way to stop the lich and temporarily kill him. While searching his laboratory, I found, conveniently, I potion that would restore missing body parts, including eyes. The party walking in on me and asked me what I found. I looked them straight in the eye and told them it was an unfinished experiment, totally useless. Passing my bluff check by miles, everyone accepted this and we left the liches lair, after I secretly filled an empty vial with the potion. Many sessions later, my characters brother lost a hand in an encounter, not good for a rogue. Well, that night, at camp, I tossed him my vial and told him to have a drink. He did and his hand immediately, grew back from his bandaged stump. When the other characters found out that that was what I had found in the liches lair, they asked why I hadnt given it to the cleric. My response: I'm truly sorry for your eye, but family always comes first. Always.  As a DM: The group I currently run games for on Tuesday night is about to reach level 6, and as level 2 PCs I had included a set of adamantine half-plate armor, which was claimed by the fighter of the group. Adamantine Armor negates all crits, turning them into normal hits. He still has this armor, passing up all others they find, even if they grant a higher AC, simply because he loves the look on my face when I roll a crit against him, only to realize that the attack reverts to a normal hit. The bastard.  TL;DR I once burned out the eye of a holy man and selfishly withheld a potion that would fix it. And I gave the tank armor that continually pisses me off. F*ck you, Brandon."

The only thing that kinda sucks is the price. $20 to buy a game for myself? Not too bad. If I wanted to pull a whole party over to their platform, though, that'd be at least $100. If I were them I'd release a $5 or so ""compact"" version that only allows you to partake as a player and connect to a GM's session. That brings the price for one party, one GM down to like $60 - which is basically ""standard pricing"" for a video game.  Worse still: one of the things I love about D&D is that (as a player) you don't really have an obligation to spend any money to play. It's super easy to let people try it out because the only thing they're spending is time, and they're spending it chilling with people they already enjoy hanging out with. If you run your sessions this way you'll have to ask people to spend $20 on a game they may never play again."

DungeonsAndDragons,3dfzhy,Kryptonboy,2,Wed Jul 15 23:43:24 2015 UTC,"Things like ""A rapier sword is a melee attack so you, Rogue, should use your strength modifier."" The poor guy has a -1 Strength modifier. He does however have an 18 Dexterity.   Rapiers have the finesse property according to the equipment table, so he gets to add his Dexterity to both his attack roll and damage roll.   So how do you resolve that stuff?   Be honest with the players, tell them you'll retcon things as you all learn the game.   Also, things like passive wisdom modifier; what's that from and when it's used versus a stealth modifier and fails, does the fail mean the character is immediately attacked, and is he/she surprised?   Passive is useful for anything you don't want to alert your players to, since you don't have to roll dice. It's also faster than rolling another die. I believe it's 10 + proficiency + Wisdom, and you treat that as the result of your die roll to detect something. I try not to roll for anything like that unless there's an immediate dramatic consequence for failure (i.e., party is about to get ambushed and if they succeed on perception they'll have a round to get ready)."
DungeonsAndDragons,3dfzhy,thomar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:03:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks! So you would use the passive wisdom perception formula if, say, a group of bandits was watching the players, but not planning on attacking, which might give the players a chance to turn the tables, but if the bandits are planning to attack, you would then have each player actually roll, adding their proficiency and wisdom modifiers to the roll? Sorry, trying to couch these in possible scenarios so I understand better.  Also, what about Advantage and Disadvantage? When is that rolled for?  The more basic question is, how much of this is relevant to the game functioning as it should? If I removed some of these, would it unbalance the game?  Thanks again!"
DungeonsAndDragons,3dfzhy,jackedwardzeiss,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:45:07 2015 UTC,"Advantage and disadvantage is when two creatures are both right next to an enemy, provided you're playing with miniatures and a grid. A creature has advantage when it and another ally ""flank"" an enemy so the creature(s) roll attacks or savings throws twice, taking the higher number. When the enemy who is ""flanked"" has to make a roll, for attacks or savings throws, it rolls twice taking the lower number."
DungeonsAndDragons,3dfzhy,Filcha,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:07:37 2015 UTC,Pretty sure this is an optional rule from the DMG.  It is not standard.  Advantage can be gained other ways:  attacking from when you are hidden/invisible is one example.  There are others but don't have my book with me.
DungeonsAndDragons,3dfzhy,macbalance,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:41:06 2015 UTC,"Advantage/Disadvanatge is a system-wide feature.  Advantage: Roll twice (on a  d20) and take the highest. Disadvantage: Roll twice, take the lowest.  Adv/Disad never 'stack' and, in fact, 100 sources of Advantage are canceleled by 1 Disadvantage.  Adv/Disadv can be gained by specific rules (A Class Feature says, ""You gain Advantage when..."") or by DM choice (""OK, so you're fighting while standing on the back of a greased pole. Yeah, take Disadvantage."") like most older editions suggested DM-optional +/-2 or so.  Part of this seems to be an effort to minimize 'bonus hunting.' Once you've got Advantage, there's no need to look for another source. No need to check every possible feature, synergy, etc. as could happen in 3.0.  It's a good rule in actual use, and plays nice and fast."
DungeonsAndDragons,3dfzhy,macbalance,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:13:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks, so it doesn't change initiative in any way, it just gives an additional chance of missing or hitting whatever the rolled number is for?"
DungeonsAndDragons,3dfzhy,thomar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:31:45 2015 UTC,"You could heave Advantage/Disadvantage on initiative, but it only impacts the specified roll.  Initiative is considered a dexterity roll. I may be getting the terminology wrong, but it turns out my Bard does get a bonus on it due to a class feature.  Just to confirm, initiative is normally rolled once an encounter, not once a round."

Sorry, trying to couch these in possible scenarios so I understand better.   Perfect example. It's not exactly written in the rules that way, but that's how I use it.   Also, what about Advantage and Disadvantage? When is that rolled for?   Whenever it matters. Attacking someone from stealth grants advantage. Attacking blind causes disadvantage. Using a melee attack on someone prone grants advantage. If your players do anything creative, you can always default to advantage or disadvantage to reward them for it (similar to the +2/-2 circumstance modifier rule from 3rd edition).   The more basic question is, how much of this is relevant to the game functioning as it should? If I removed some of these, would it unbalance the game?   You're going to have to be more specific. The Dungeon Master's Guide has a large section on variant rules, and the Unearthed Arcana column on the Wizards site has a couple of PDF talking about other homebrew topics."

When you crit, you would achieve on average 22.667 damage (4D6+6, if modifier is doubled then 28.667 damage)  The probability of achieving a critical hit is 0.2 (0.05 for 19 or 20 on either die from frenzy). Therefore your average hit when taking crits into account is 16 damage (0.8 * 14.333 + 22.667 * 0.2) or 17.2 damage if doubling modifier with crits.  For 3 attacks a round, this is either 48 damage or 51.6 damage a turn.  Editted for formatting"

DungeonsAndDragons,3dd8k0,Gyoin,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:52:39 2015 UTC,"When in doubt, list it out.  There are a lot of steps in probability calculations, but they are all pretty straight forward.  What are all the possible damage rolls?  Roll 1d6, reroll on 1 or 2.    P(1) = 1/18 (1/3 chance of first rolling 1 or 2, times 1/6 chance of then rolling a 1) P(2) = 1/18 P(3) = 2/9 (1/6 chance of rolling 3, plus 1/18 chance of hitting 3 on a reroll) P(4) = 2/9 P(5) = 2/9 P(6) = 2/9.   The expected value (sum of each possible value, times the likelihood of that value) is therefore:  EV = (1*1/18) + (2*1/18) + (3*2/9) + (4*2/9) + (5*2/9) + (6*2/9) = 25/6 = 4.17   What are the possible attack rolls? Roll 2d20, take higher.  This is a big die, so let's group uninteresting results (crits/noncrits) together.  P(1-18) & P(1-18) = (18/20)*(18/20) = 81/100  No Crit :( P(1-18) & P(19-20) = (18/20)*(2/20) = 9/100  Crit! P(19-20) & P(1-18) = (2/20)*(18/20) = 9/100  Crit! P(19-20) & P(19-20) = (2/20)*(2/20) = 1/100  Crit!   We'll sum up all of the crit chances:  P(Crit!) = (9/100) + (9/100) + (1/100) = 19/100.   Notice, we can use the same form of this table to do even more!  For instance, if we know your attack bonus and the enemy's armor class, you can quickly find your odds of hitting it.  For example, suppose you needed to roll a 9 to hit your enemy.  P(1-8) & P(1-8) = (8/20)*(8/20) = 16/100 No Hit :(( P(1-8) & P(9-18) = (8/20)*(10/20) = 20/100  Hit, no Crit P(1-8) & P(19-20) = (8/20)*(2/20) = 4/100  Crit! P(9-18) & P(1-8) = 20/100  Hit, no Crit P(9-18) & P(9-18) = (10/20) * (10/20) = 25/100  Hit, no Crit P(9-18) & P(19-20) = (10/20) * (2/20) = 5/100 Crit! P(19-20) & P(1-8) = 4/100 Crit! P(19-20) & P(9-18) = 5/100 Crit! P(19-20) & P(19-20) = 1/100 Crit!   By assigning damage numbers to the results of Miss, Hit, and Crit, in the same way that we calculated the expected value of the d6 roll, we can calculate the expected value of a single attack.  EV(attack damage) = (0 * 16/100) + (HitDmg * 65/100) + (CritDmg * 19/100)"
DungeonsAndDragons,3dd8k0,dratnon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:12:14 2015 UTC,"In the list above, I grouped each roll into a category, and made the categories include all possible rolls, without duplicates.  When listing possibilities, it is good to start out this way, to avoid overcounting.  For example, it might be tempting to ignore the 2nd die whenever a crit is scored on one. (We don't care if the other would have been a Miss/Hit/Crit), but:  P(19-20) & P(1-20) = 10/100 P(1-20) & P(19-20) = 10/100   In this calculation, we get a higher crit chance!  (20/100 instead of 19/100)  This is because we've overcounted the P(19-20) & P(19-20).  This possibility is included in both equations, so there is some overlap.  By carefully listing every possibility, or making sure that each possibility is represented exactly once, you won't have to worry about this."

If you want someone to cast a spell they don't have a slot for, you should at minimum force them to spend multiple slots of a lower level.  Say that combining two lower level slots yields one slot of a higher level.  So at level 1, when they have a pair of level 1 slots, they can maybe pull off a 2nd level spell by spending all their spellpower.  At level 15 they finally can pull off a 9th level spell -- by spending 2 5th level slots to get a 6th, stacking that with their existing 6th to get a 7th, stacking that with their existing 7th to get an 8th, and stacking that with their existing 8th to get a 9th level slot.  (Ninth level spells are hard to cast for a reason.)  Honestly though, I wouldn't be inclined to use such a rule.  If you want wizards casting spells above their level, try the spell scroll route."
DungeonsAndDragons,3dbzcq,wayoverpaid,2,Wed Jul 15 06:22:38 2015 UTC,"If I were to let my players attempt to do something like this, I'd probably use something similar to Last Gasp's Maleficar:   http://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/do-not-take-me-for-some-turner-of-cheap-tricks/  I'd say they could attempt it by doing a Cast The Bones roll, but with a penalty that's based on the distance between the levels of the highest spell that the caster knows and the desired spell.  This way they could attempt to do so, but at potential risk (and fun!) to themselves (and to the party)."

I feel like for such a reward there's no punishment.  Also, I just read some of the Net Libram of Random Effects (I think that's the same one as Trigger93 was talking about) and that would work too.

I think it would work best if the wizard could only attempt to cast a level higher than their normal max,take 1d12 damage cumulative per overspell use until the next long rest.Perhaps have a 25%-50% chance of wildmagic occuring.  I like the idea,it makes sense that wizards would occasionally try a spell out of their grasp in a dire situation or if they wanted to practice higher stuff earlier."

However, if they provided extra material components and spent a longer time preparing for the spell and casting it, I might bump that up to 50%.  Being able to jump up a spell level is a very powerful option for a caster, and I'd like to give the player a lot of tradeoffs."

It makes for a potentially OP wizard, yes, but I think that it's something very plausible in the world. Wizards are all about the scholarly approach to magic, the search for knowledge and power. If a wizard discovered a powerful spell, I don't imagine any self respecting wizard would say ""I'll just set this aside for a while"" you know?"
DungeonsAndDragons,3dbzcq,marco262,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:10:43 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. For this kind of thing to work, you'll need a GM running a campaign with problems that are open to multiple solutions.

DM's are humans and given that humans only have control over roughly 5% of their actions (look up cognition, reasoning, consciousness, we're a lot dumber and more automatic and less in control than we like to delude ourselves into believing we are), people will naturally play favourites without even realising that they are.  Not only that, but favouritism can be simply a matter of perception. I was once accused of favouritism and yet, from my perspective, the player accusing me of it simply wasn't very engaged in the game, didn't interact much, and when they did it was always antagonistic and in counter action to the plot, story, NPC's or even the PC's. So it was only natural that they ended up having less success with their actions than other players who were more co-operative and less disruptive."

DungeonsAndDragons,3d9oxa,randominate,2,Tue Jul 14 18:18:50 2015 UTC,"For me, it wasn't a grognard thing at all, it was a lack of complexity.

I tried to play 4E with my kids and realize shortly into the first adventure that the classes had been so normalized they were all pretty much the same.  Roughly the same abilities with a different name, etc.  I heard that later in the game it got better but we were all so bored to tears with the early game it got dumped in favor of PF.  5E to me is worlds better, the classes all feel different at lower levels, if that makes sense, and somehow they managed to keep it streamlined like 4E.  I'll play just about any RPG, but like a good book, it has to be complicated enough to keep my interest.  Aside from voicing my own preference, I've never bashed 4E though, it was a solid system for what it was and I can easily see it being a great way to get new players into the game."

I draw out my maps ahead of time and uncover it as the PCs explore. I also hate how much room a conventional battle map/chessex map (1 inch = 5 feet) takes up so I draw them on A4 paper and use a scale of 8mm=5 feet. So for miniatures I use coloured 8mm cubes. Here is an example of a map I drew. Here is an example of a mock encounter so you can see the scale.

I just draw the dungeon as the characters see it, and move around with some miniatures of their characters.

My group follows these guidelines:   DM asks for a marching order when we're going into someplace dangerous. We line up minis in order for this. For quicker/smaller fights, no battle mat is used. Also the same for some 'large scale' fights, as it's not worth it to send 10 minutes drawing a map for a fight scene we'll use one time then discard. The 'full mat' only gets used for big fights. Totally DM's call here, but only if it really makes sense like a big boss fight, or one where there's important distances to think about. Maybe 1-2 fights per session."

If they ignore the hooks and go off on completely random tangents, the ""event"" still occurs and affects the world, positively or negatively.   For instance, the party goes out to a border town in the mountains and find out that there's a band of orcs approaching.  They just leave town to investigate an abandoned mine the blacksmith mentioned in passing.  (This is where I pull out a random mine map that's been sitting in my DM bag for 3 months).

Of course, these groups always ended up having problems. If you don't care about their feelings or if they are not likely to get super upset or go ballistic on you guys, then straight up tell them that you all decided to make some changes and that they won't be playing with you guys anymore. And none of us will think less of you if you do that through text because it saves each and everyone of you guys from an embarrassing table conversation.  And giving them some reasons can be helpful too, letting them know that its isn't so much them as the situation."

No need to be greedy with this sort of thing. It's okay if he's a beginner, we all were at some point, but hopefully someone - perhaps you - will help him become more experienced. Definitely stick to just the basic versions for now, no need to make things too complex for beginners. I hear the more modern versions have simplified and streamlined things quite a bit, perhaps at the cost of potential enjoyment. Be careful not to get him stuck on one version though, as then he'll be convinced it's the best and won't experiment with others. But also keep in mind that he shouldn't switch versions too often either, then he'll never be any good at any of them.   Best help I can provide."

DungeonsAndDragons,3cres2,benrelucio,18,Fri Jul 10 04:11:11 2015 UTC,"Rule 0: The DM's word is law. Your own rules can and will overrule the rules of the game when necessary. If you feel the game rules disallow something that should be allowed, change it. If you feel a game rule was written poorly or doesn't make sense, change it. But do not abuse this power Rule 0 is best using sparingly, if at all. Players will usually accept it's use, but they won't if you invoke it too often. The players are not your enemy. Your goal should never be to defeat them, but rather to offer them a constant and, above all, enjoyable challenge. Accordingly, you should constantly be on the lookout for signs that encounters are either too easy or too hard, and adjust future encounters accordingly until you find the right balance between the two. Ideally you want some variation in difficulty. Sometimes they should have a fairly easy time, but they should also have legitimate fear for their lives every now and then. Don't be afraid to fudge the occasional roll. I usually only do it when NPCs are on crit sprees (because those are never fun, especially if it's all on the same PC), but on occasion I will do it for dramatic effect. My one rule is, when making player rolls (for passive checks or the like), is to never turn a success into a fail. Never hold up a game to clarify rules. Make a judgement call and accept no arguments, but also make it clear that the judgement call will only last until the end of/break in the session, when the rules can be properly consulted. If it doesn't exist in the rules, try to find the best balance for your game. Be descriptive. Your players shouldn't just ""hit the goblin for X damage"" turn after turn, because that's boring. Mix up the type of attack (slash, stab, whallop, etc), incorporate the damage dealt in the description (""while your sword draws blood, he ignores it as he would a mosquito bite"" for low damage) and killing blows should definitely get a bit more spice (""you impale the little beast on your sword""). You can also use description to indicate when the players have just barely missed, because this is useful information and it's nice to feel that a failure wasn't * entirely* a failure. Make your own NPCs. Feel free to use pre-made monsters and NPC baddies, but also try to whip up some off your own. Class levels should not be restricted to bosses. Grunts can have class levels too, and it makes combat more interesting when they do. Monsters can have them as well, and this not only makes really cool and unique encounters, it can be great fun for you to discover what possibilities open up when you use non-standard races. Use the third dimension in combat from time to time. I don't mean have lots of mid-air or underwater fights (though you can have them here and there) I mean spice up your terrestrial battles by including elevated areas on the battlefield that can be climbed up, jumped down from and otherwise interacted with. Maybe throw a small, jumpable ravine onto the field that debuffs people (players AND NPCs) fighting next to it. Basically, penalties for having to split attention between fighting and not falling. Try to avoid controlling the PCs whenever possible. That's not your job, your job is to weave a story and you should only take direct control of the PCs (as in actively describing what they're doing and feeling, rather than the player doing so) when mechanics call for it (examples being Dominate Person, or a captive situation (though in that case always leave a space for the players to at least try to act)). Don't force your players down a pre-determined path (known as ""railroading""). You can guide them along the path you want them to take, but ultimately this is their story as well, and their choices matter. If they want to ignore the plot hook and go off to do their own thing, let them. Improvisation is a huge part of DMing and you should be ready for things to go off the beaten path. I find it helps to have a cache of random encounters and subplots prepared for situations like this, to prevent unnecessary stalling of the game. I build it up by basically taking all the random little ideas I have and fleshing them out into something playable. Maybe it's a social encounter that I couldn't fit into the plot anywhere, maybe I had some cool builds that I never had a chance to play and turned into a combat encounter. Random plot threads with no worlds and/or stories to connect to work for this rather well too. You should identify what your players want out of the game and try to make sure each one gets a bit of what they want. It's especially important to pay attention to their builds, because if they don't get any opportunities to do the cool things they built their character to do, they will rapidly become dissatisfied. Let your monk close the gap and punch people, don't flood the tripmaster with flyers and don't deprive the socially-skilled PC of social encounters. Also try to incorporate the PCs' backgrounds into the story in little ways. This can lead to ""focus sessions"" where one PC is at the center, storywise, for a bit, but so long as it doesn't detract from the main plot (or whatever they PCs have cobbled together in place of one) and everyone gets their turn in the spotline it'll work out fine. If you want to encourage roleplay, something beyond combat encounter after combat encounter, find some way to reward player participation in social encounters and good acts of roleplay in general. Extra EXP is a simple, old standby, but you can be more creative if you want. But if you want some solid roleplay out of players, it helps if they know there are tangible rewards. Some will perform admirably without, but all too many are playing primarily for the combat and need an extra nudge. Most of all, just remember that you're all there to have fun. Encourage communication between the entire group so that ""lack of fun"" issues and various conflicts can be addressed.   Will add more as I think of them."

""Before you is war made flesh, a temple to death, a warrior who's very shadow scatters mercy to the winds."" is not specific to the details but rather invokes emotional response and the imagination fills in the details.  ""Before you is an old woman with grey hair and wrinkled skin, her eyes are filled with tears as she approaches."" -- descriptive  ""Weary of spirit and burdened with sorrow, a woman approaches who fairer years have long since passed and skin who has long suffered the harshness of time."" - Emotive language...

DungeonsAndDragons,3cres2,lady_ninane,3,Fri Jul 10 06:31:32 2015 UTC,"Fun overrules plot. Whatever story you have planned, don't get overly attached to it. You would be surprised what awesome things can come out of unexpected actions and creative solutions from players.  Fun overrules your pet characters. Don't get overly attached to any one NPC. A villain's job is to be one or more of these (a) a nuisance with plans to be thwarted, but otherwise not a lethal threat; (b) a dangerous creature destined to be avoided, killed, imprisoned, destroyed, or otherwise defeated; or (c) an evil person that may cause some damage but who will one day regret their behavior and switch to the good side.  Fun overrules sticking to the rules, if enforcing the rules suddenly makes the game tedious. This is hard to judge because every group plays differently and has its own social dynamic. If by the rules a character has suddenly become unavoidable, yet fair, then it may be acceptable. But enforcing the rules arbitrarily, or making up new ones arbitrarily as part of a power trip, is crazy. Character death (or severe handicap or taking away expensive items) should only be enforced with a sense of fair play and good sportsmanship. Now the next point:  When a PC dies, it's someone's poor planning at fault (player or DM), and it shouldn't normally happen. Intentionally killing a PC when they should have otherwise survived is the result of the DM being a jerk. (Don't be a jerk.) PC death can be a source of high drama if mutually planned by DM and player or if player trusts the DM not to screw him over arbitrarily -- and it needs to be heroic or meaningful. And then Total Party Kill (TPK), unless all the players just massively underperforming or make really dumb decisions or whatnot, a TPK is also a TDMF (Total DM Failure)."

However temper that by explaining good/bad consequences as a result of their crazy, cool idea and what type of dice roll will be needed so they can make it happen. My best gaming moments have come from just saying yes.  Communicate with your players when they do something you like.   Grant inspiration, compliment them, give them a high five. Players respond well to your enthusiasm for cool gaming moments. Encourage the players to shine by getting them to collaborate in the story telling.  Don't hog the spotlight.  Give everyone a turn to do something cool once a night. This way they feel like they are part of the group. Your players can win an encounter by having great rolls, by doing something super sneaky, or by good planning. Sometimes that just happens. Letting them win in these situations lets them feel like the heroes they are."

DungeonsAndDragons,3cres2,Twosdai,2,Fri Jul 10 08:36:08 2015 UTC,"1)  Plan on your first session being entirely character-building, especially if it's new players.  2)  Have one player be your rules-monkey.  If a question comes up during the game, have them work on sussing it out while you continue.   3)  Do everything in your power to keep the game moving.  If somebody is looking something up or taking a while, use it as an opportunity to address somebody else.  Only stop the game if the decision is absolutely critical to what happens.  4)  Random encounters are one of the stupider ideas that this game just can't seem to shake.  Most random encounter tables are just random fights.  If you're due for a fight, great, but a generic brawl is usually pretty tedious and an exercise in dice rolling.  If you take the time to set up a proper, interesting encounter/fight, why randomize it?  Then you've just put all that work into making something cool that can never be used.  The ONLY time random encounters make sense to me is when the players are trying to rest in an area that isn't safe, or are fucking around in an area you haven't planned on that is designated ""treacherous"".  Seriously - if you want encounters in an area, plan out interesting ones.  Don't just have random fights for the sake of random fights.  I AM a big fan of random weather though, for what that's worth.  5)  Your job as a DM is to essentially string together a bunch of mini-encounters or scenes into a somewhat compelling narrative.  These scenes can be completely fluid - you are more than welcome to change them around in order to account for what the players are doing.  Players go on path B instead of path A?  You can still use the encounter you had for Path A if it makes sense, the players won't know the difference.  6)  Speaking of the players not knowing the difference, they only know what you tell them.  Modules are somewhat infamous for having all these neat lit bits of lore and secrets.  It is your job to serve those up to the best of your ability.  Drop hints about what kind of skills may be relevant or just ask them to make the relevant rolls when you want to reveal something.  Players aren't psychic, they won't respond to something out of the blue unless you give them reason to.  7)  You can handle NPCs in one of two ways - either describe them in the 3rd person style, or act it out 1st person style.  A lot of this will depend on your personality and how outgoing you are.  I think a lot of DMs use a mixture of both.  8)  Don't let players lead you into rolls, and rolls are not king shit of everything.  I have one player who will roll in the 20's for nearly every single skill check and try to force his version of things to get outcomes he wants.  Sometimes there's just no way a crazy idea will work.  Sometimes I want them to role-play or problem solve something instead of just relying on a number.  I try to respect circumstances where their rolls could have an influence, but the game does not rise and fall on the basis of a few die rolls.  9)  Players should die when they make poor decisions.  Players should not die due to random die rolls.  The dice come into effect from time to time, but ""insta-death"" situations should always be avoided.  My general rule of thumb is there needs to be 3 fuckups for a player to die.  3 hits, 3 failed saves, 3 bad decisions - whatever.  Give them a chance to recognize what's going on and rectify it, or at least stack the odds in their favor.  10)  Players have a tendency to read the rules in such a way that most favors them.  If something seems to be ridiculously effective, read the rules/text on it.  If it's still ridiculous, figure out how to monkey's paw it in a fair but logical fashion.  Example - one of the earlier editions (I think 3.0) had a pretty ridiculous polymorph spell, as written you could transform into damn near anything and trivialize an awful lot of challenges.  I fixed that particular problem by requiring the caster to be familiar with the beast in question - as in, having encountered it before.  That made things a lot more manageable while still limiting the spell in a logical manner.  11)  Just accept that there are going to be some things that you just will NOT be able to screw the players with.  A wizard with access to overland flight, for example, will essentially be permanently flying.  Floor traps and sticking things high up just isn't going to be an issue for that character.  12)  I really like using a chessex mat and miniatures.  In 3.5 they were pretty much essential, but I find they are still quite valuable in 5.0 for handling combat."
DungeonsAndDragons,3cres2,1-Down,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:40:47 2015 UTC,"Prepare as much as you can, but do not hesitate when the game is on.  (Learn the rules. Plan for the most common PC plan, the next plan after that, and a third. Do not be surprised if the PCs then take another route.)  You have an unlimited reserve of monsters and such. Do not be stingy to the players. However, it is always easier to give out stuff than to take it away.  If you make a ruling, don't be afraid to revisit it. If you wrong a player, make it up to them.  Everyone is there to have fun. While it is your job to keep things organized and moving, everyone must contribute and compromise."
DungeonsAndDragons,3cres2,macbalance,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:07:27 2015 UTC,"It's great to prepare with a pre-made adventure, I always like to include at least one 'fun' or 'interactive' activity that is something different from the usual part of the game, using aids like colored paper boards or a scavenger hunt or anything neat that ties together the game to players doing an activity.. it's all about the unconventional, unique fun and how it can resonate in your game.  My best words of advice though, are be flexible enough to not mind when players deviate from your carefully-laid plans of how things are supposed to go and kick the board, upsetting everything you thought would happen; Go with the flow. I had a player once, who, at the end of an arc where getting the first essential 'gem key' that contributed to the wider puzzle, instead of saving it, chucked it into a river in a huff (in-character).  Instead of being a simple 'collect the keys to open the gate' thing, this upended the whole idea and turned into a great-race-esque deal where many NPC teams were hunting these gems and drawing closer to the goal; one of these was a simple fish-man 'Murp' who had found this gem in his river, unbeknownst to the players, and he was the odd-man out amongst these roving bands of murderers and generally not-nice people.  The team encountered Murp 4 or 5 times as the campaign progressed and they got closer to the gemmed gate, hoarding each gem they found and fighting off ambushes from their rivals. He was a harmless talking fish-man who was actually quite helpful to the players, on one occasion striding out of their camp and straight into a trap laid by other NPCs, utterly spoiling it and alerting the party to shenanigans. On another, the party raided an enemy camp and managed to steal gems as well as free a tied-up Murp who was captured and left by the campfire. These meetings with Murp always occurred while the party Warrior (who was the one who had thrown the stone away) was in his armor. One of his primary pieces of protection was a giant great helm that totally obscured his face.  Many long nights later, they finally reached the 'endgame', only to find they were missing a single gem of the amount needed to open the gate. Puzzled and defeated, the group sat around as friendly ol' Murp appeared. They talked for a while amongst themselves, and decided to make camp for the night, with a plan to start backtracking their steps in the morning. Poor group, they really though they had had it in the bag at this time, lots of confused looks thrown to the dungeon master.  So someone said, 'hey, let's invite Murp to dinner, he's sort of our mascot, right?', so they all sat down to dinner with Murp, who gasped upon seeing the Warrior sit down helm-less, and jumped up, plunging a hand into his gills and pulling out that first water-discarded gem, and shouted 'Sir! Sir! You dropped this, Sir!' while pressing it into his hands.  A great example of how one player's actions can change your entire plan, but make something grow that far exceeded what you thought was possible. The players loved it, at one point they were howling with laughter. What happened when they cracked open the gate, however, is a story for another time..."

DungeonsAndDragons,3cpbgu,Lacactar,11,Thu Jul 9 18:08:32 2015 UTC,It's exactly like multi-classing.  You keep everything you already had and build upon it with the new class features of the PrC.

DungeonsAndDragons,3cpbgu,trollburgers,8,Thu Jul 9 18:29:16 2015 UTC,"No worries.  Here's the relevant info from the SRD.   Prestige classes offer a new form of multiclassing. Unlike the basic classes, characters must meet Requirements before they can take their first level of a prestige class. The rules for level advancement apply to this system, meaning the first step of advancement is always choosing a class. If a character does not meet the Requirements for a prestige class before that first step, that character cannot take the first level of that prestige class. Taking a prestige class does not incur the experience point penalties normally associated with multiclassing.   Most prestige classes build on the base class, so the class features often stack.  Take a look at the Assassin.  In order to qualify for it, you have to have, among other things, 8 ranks in Hide and Move Silently.  A rogue could have that at level 5.  So, at level 6, they can take the first level of Assassin.   Rogue 5/Assassin 1   A 5th level rogue would have a sneak attack of +3d6.  Assassin 1 gets sneak attack +1d6.    Your Rogue 5/Assassin 1 would therefore have sneak attack +4d6.  You certainly wouldn't lose your +3d6 sneak attack (from rogue) and replace it with +1d6 sneak attack (from assassin)."
DungeonsAndDragons,3clej1,thalionthewicked,21,Wed Jul 8 20:35:25 2015 UTC,"Rope, chalk, and caltrops.  All three are very easy to carry with you (unlike a 10 foot pole), and are cheap and easy to acquire in almost any setting (if not caltrops, try ball bearings, or even scrap metal).  The first one has been absolutely standard since the beginning of DnD, I doubt I even need to explain further, it's almost the duct tape of the pre-industrial world.  Climbing up things, climbing down things, attaching to things, tying down objects, binding prisoners, gagging prisoners, makeshift repairs, contraption-making, you name it.  Chalk is versatile.  Need to take a rubbing of an engraving of a picture or some runes?  Borrow a piece of paper from the wizard and make one.  Come across another species whose language you don't speak, but the languages use the same script?  Write on a slab of stone.  Need to leave a message for other travelers?  Write it in big letters by the roadside.  Need to remember which dungeon paths you've explored?  Mark them with a symbol.  Climbing a cliffside?  Dry your hands with chalk.  Caltrops are for escape and control.  Pour them on the ground as you flee to trip up pursuers, scatter them outside the door to the big bad's minion barracks before confronting him, or put a bunch of them in a bucket so that they'll fall on the head of anyone who opens the door to your chambers.  They throw a wrench in other people's plans, which is always valuable.  Depending on the campaign, paper and ink, a crowbar, or a compass might make for good additions as well."

I've played campaigns where player death is all but unheard of, and I've played campaigns where the campaign wouldn't have worked if we hadn't lost a PC every other session. In the former, the quickest way to die was to do something stupid without considering the consequences. For example, everyone had OOC knowledge of what a deck of many things was capable of. If one ever turned up in play, all of the random possibilities were fair game. This would inevitably result in player death because some of our party members didn't know how to say no."

DungeonsAndDragons,3chl78,orcusmalorcus,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:42:05 2015 UTC,"Well, this is why I stop short of calling it outright bad.  I've felt cheated before when a character didn't die.  It's not about good/bad.  It's something to be measured.  It's not ""random chance"" like a monster rolling all 20s.    It's no different than tuning the difficulty of a boss encounter to your group.  Some people want a little bit of challenge and risk, but would be seriously bummed out by a TPK.  Some people would find any big bad that wasn't a real risk of TPK anticlimactic.  When I as a DM hand out that deck of many things (especially if I know that the players are the kind to draw all the cards they can) I need to consider if possibly killing them off will enhance the campaign.  It's an aspect of scenario design when you decide make a 1 on that potion roll ""instant irrecoverable death"" instead of ""severe and humorous inconvenience"", it's not ""random chance"".  For every person who would laugh off a character death (this is me), there is another who would view it as breaking their toys and ruining their fun.  Basically, I just hate things like that being called ""random"" as if that excuses people from designing well.  It's good or bad on it's own merit.  The die roll does not take away credit or blame."
DungeonsAndDragons,3chl78,Toiler_in_Darkness,3,Wed Jul 8 16:10:09 2015 UTC,"IMO the DM has three jobs, to present an interesting backdrop, to offer interesting choices and to present the consequences to them.   This is imo really shitty DMing since the DM in no way indicated that beeing disolved and permanently dead could be the result from drinking one of the potions. If all the other potions did shit like increase ability scores or grow tails there was no indication that death could be a possible outcome. Uninformed choices where the PCs have no way to gauge the possible outcome are just bad."

I died there, so there goes the story of Darvok, the Pelor priest who wanted to build his own church to honour his murdered  mother.  What are the chances to that happen? Very very very low. I keep cursing the paladin the whole campaign for that event. We told him the whole day to stop jerking off with his skill. I think that my following character found an excuse to dislike him."

I was hoping to get off one Bestow Curse and bring their casting stat below 13.  I figured a wizard wouldn't want to cast fireball in close quarters, so at worst I'd get Burning Hands (There was a fire theme).  Turns out they had fire-proofing robes.  Which we didn't steal, because I, the cleric, was at negative something, and shit was on fire, so we all wanted to GTFO before the inevitable shitstorms that occur after killing the Queen's guard.  I stabilized, but shouldn't have.  The group never met again due to external circumstances."

DungeonsAndDragons,3chl78,blacksheepcannibal,2,Wed Jul 8 12:43:02 2015 UTC,"Well, it kind of could have been anticipated   Exactly. The character you are playing isn't supposed to be the dunce of the class, ha ha he hurt himself because he's too dumb. He's supposed to be the hero in the story. Instead of saying ""ha! this magic item worked in a way that you didn't expect and now your character is dead!"" the GM should have told you what would happen so you could make a sound choice instead of hiding the consequences until it was too late. It's called ""DM transparency"" and ""broadcasting your intent"". It's part of a game where it isn't DM-vs-Player, but instead everybody telling an awesome story together.  But everybody has their own playstyle. I'm just glad you didn't walk away from it bitter and not wanting to play again."

My Ultraloth friend got beheaded by a Balor. Enervated to death by Hecate (Greecian goddess of dark magic) for accusing her of cheating in a game of chess. Ripped to shreds by another Ultraloth with super magic death swords.   My Balor friend only died three times. Two times in an attempt to dominate Phlagiston, the titan of Fire. He owed me big for those Wish spells I cast.   My Astral Deva friend got exploded by my Balor friend who was exploded by a dude named Eliashan the Arch Wizard of Law. I had been kidnapped and taken to a meeting with Moloch for that fight.  I did get hit full on by a Styx dragon just before I killed it.

DungeonsAndDragons,3cfmsk,FuzzyCupcake,5,Tue Jul 7 15:19:34 2015 UTC,"Being recently engaged myself, I've been doing a lot of reading on different ceremonies, traditional and non traditional. The ceremony is what you and your partner want it to be. Most wedding sites suggest that you get together with your officiant (in your case a Lastai ""cleric"" who is ordained in our world) and talk about your relationship and what you want and expect out of the ceremony.   Just spitballing here, but I recall sexual satisfaction as being a promise that Jewish husbands make to their wives in their vows. Check into that and see how they broach the subject. I'd suggest studying up on all kinds of different cultures and faiths traditions, pick and choose the wording and aspects that fit with what you think Lastai would approve of.  There are ways you could have the whole gluttony, sloth, sins, etc thing worked in by vowing moderation to your partner, and promising you will guide them when the sins become too heavy to bear alone.   Most ceremonies have the officiant give some history behind the traditions that are about to take place. I strongly suggest this, especially in your case, so that your guests understand what the hell is going on.  Here is a link to figuring out your own non traditional ceremony.  BTW I would love to hear anything else about your nerd-tastic wedding. My fiance and I considered medieval/D&D, but ultimately, we are going more of the Hobbit route as far as themes go."
DungeonsAndDragons,3cfmsk,cicicatastrophe,5,Tue Jul 7 18:04:59 2015 UTC,Make sure to have the Rains if Castemere playing.
DungeonsAndDragons,3cfmsk,Tzun,2,Tue Jul 7 21:43:30 2015 UTC,"I wish I could upvote you more than once. Thank you for all of your advice and recommendations. I will look into all of these.   Our officiant, who so far I have only talked to once, was ecstatic about the idea. She loves doing non-traditional weddings and her son plays D&D, so when I told her my idea of her portraying a cleric of Lastai, a goddess from a game, she jumped right on board. That was the last I talked to her.  I looked up the sexual satisfaction promise, apparently called the Vow of 'Onah. The prereqs aren't listed, but I'm going to assume I have to take Sacred Vow before this wedding now. I'll read up more on in and see if it's worth two feats.  I love your idea on the sins in moderation. That is such a great idea. Seriously. I have no idea why that didn't even cross my mind.  I have seen that link before and have stared at it, and have written a very basic outline with that (Has tons of question marks as I am still trying to figure everything out). My problem is that I don't want to go to my officiant and say ""Here, this is what I want, do this exactly."" I want her to put her own twist on things. We will probably work together to get this down.  Some examples of other things we're doing: Cake looks like the three core books stacked on top of each other. Groom and groomsmen wearing armor Officiant will be ""reading"" out of the DMG (Really paper taped to the inside) Rolling for vows or our kiss, not sure which Bridesmaids will be carrying lanterns We want to have some sort of game at the reception, not sure what yet Reception tables will be labeled things like ""Druid's Camp"" ""Thieve's Guild"" ""Wizard's Academy"", etc.  Those are just the ideas off the top of my head."
DungeonsAndDragons,3cfmsk,cicicatastrophe,2,Wed Jul 8 14:57:26 2015 UTC,"This is so fucking cute. I would have a blast at your wedding. Maybe your cleric officiant could ""roll"" for the kiss. Oh shit, look at that, Nat 20! It was meant to be.  (Whether she has to fudge the roll or not.)  Talking with your officiant should be more like you guys giving her ideas and examples, then she should be stringing it all together, and giving you a final reading to review. Being someone familiar with the theme you guys are going for, it should be a piece of cake.  I think having some sort of game at the reception would be nice for the cocktail hour/while you guys are getting your photos done, or even just a fun get to know you ice breaker game at the reception. It wouldn't be a D&D wedding if y'all didn't play some games."

Buy a Dragonborn with a cloak and then a figure with the weapons you want. Cut the pieces you want off of some of the characters and glue them onto the one with the cloth or leather armor.
