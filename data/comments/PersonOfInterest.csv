PersonOfInterest,3e3ray,hsroe,14,Tue Jul 21 18:56:59 2015 UTC,"I think the fanbase here quite enjoys the serialized, sci-fi aspects of the show. I know a chunk of its fanbase misses the case-of-the-week formula, which is probably why the ratings and audience has declined."
PersonOfInterest,3e3ray,rpawson5771,9,Tue Jul 21 19:09:36 2015 UTC,"I agree. I'd like to add on to this though:    I know a chunk of its fanbase misses the case-of-the-week formula, which is probably why the ratings and audience has declined.   The ratings decline can be attributed to multiple factors. I think what hurt POI the most was becoming serialized at a time that CBS was giving it an increasingly shitty schedule with little advertising. I'm a diehard fan, and even I had trouble keeping up with the sporadic scheduling. I constantly had to check CBS's website. I don't think the general audience did that, so they were more likely to miss an episode. If you missed one, you were likely to miss even more later because you couldn't just sit down and watch a random episode-- again, the show was too serialized for that. You wouldn't understand what the heck was going on. You had to get caught up. But POI wasn't readily available online, so that made it all the more difficult to stay up to date with the show. All of this took a toll on POI's live 18-49 ratings.   It feels almost as though CBS set POI up to fail."
PersonOfInterest,3e3ray,ariyahvansh,6,Tue Jul 21 19:37:16 2015 UTC,"What if when Person of Interest was gradually becoming serialized CBS slowly realized that the show wasn't sticking to how it was originally pitched to them 'about two guys stopping crime before it happens'. I think CBS got angry when seeing the show that they don't own becoming a sci-fi serialized story. So their first plan to set the show up for failure was a new night and time which happened in the start for season 3. The next plan was to promote the show very little than some of the other CBS owned shows, therefore having smaller awareness to the general public about the show and when it aired. The other is giving the show poor and inconsistent scheduling so therefore it becomes impossible for the casual viewer to keep track of when the next episode airs, and when they miss an episode they do not know what is happening in the next episode they watch. This all creates a doom of failure for this show and so therefore it purposefully leads to cancellation, which I think CBS wanted all along ever since it deviated away from being solely a procedural show. Now that the ratings have dropped considerably low, CBS is almost done with their plan, the next is to cancel it, which I am afraid CBS will most likely do. CBS doesn't love Person Of Interest ever since it ratings weren't as high as Season 2. I therefore conclude that it is not the fault of Person of Interest's gradually serialized storyline. I mean seriously look at LOST ratings during most of its seasons, it had a lot of viewers and it was serialized from the beginning to the end, this tells me even if Person of Interest is serialized it could of still been a hit in viewership, only if it weren't for a purposefully bad moving, scheduling, and promotion from CBS, which as I said before they did this to Person of Interest and they wanted the show to be canceled all along. Its CBS's fault NOT Person of Interest."

PersonOfInterest,3e3ray,whitewater2,4,Wed Jul 22 02:30:10 2015 UTC,I dont disagree but would like to add the day/time change killed them right off the bat after Season 2. The annoying weeks where it doesn't air also kills them. I ran the numbers and it was a 20-30% drop in viewership on return episodes every time they had random breaks.  Season 4 - it seemed like they tried to appears the number of the week and still maintain the over-arching theme.
PersonOfInterest,3e3ray,rpawson5771,2,Tue Jul 21 20:11:04 2015 UTC,The day change was definitely a factor in audience size and ratings.

If it had stayed full-on procedural with less story I doubt I would still enjoy it as much."

(But you know, if Elias were to appear in season 5, I most certainly would not object.)  I think they used Elias's theme from 3x10 simply because of its incredible dramatic, suspenseful effect. That theme is a good story-closer: first it signified the end of the HR storyline, and now, it's being used to signify the end of the Samaritan arc."

That was before we even knew that POI would be getting a reduced episode order. The writers have had to change their plans a fair bit since then. The interview I linked is from SDCC, which took place on July 11th. Greg and Tony already had the 5x01 script (or at least a draft of it) prepared by then.

I honestly would not care if the writers never addressed him again. I was not really a fan of ""Last Call"" (3x15).   Another unresolved plotline is that of Alistair Wesley from 2x07. It was implied that we would see him again, but we never did. Again, this is not a character that I ever cared about so I personally wouldn't mind never hearing from him.  Then there's Logan Pierce, who gave Reese a watch with a tracker in it, which Finch destroyed. The fact that Pierce was trying to track Reese and Finch suggested he was curious about their activities and was probably intended to make a reappearance. However, the actor Jimmi Simpson is now on board with Jonah's other project, Westworld, so I doubt he'll be available."

Guessing it's the same as the RFID ones that Root & Shaw had to inject themselves with to break into the Decima server farm back in the Season 3 finale. Special Counsel even mentioned back in Zero Day, that it was traced to the company.  Maybe Corwin had that implanted without her knowledge, or heaven knows what. Doubt she was a Decima spy. It's one of those plotlines which they probably abandoned."

I sort of figure that since she was the liaison between the government and the various contractors asked to design machines for the government that the chip is how Decima knew not only about Northern Lights but also Samaritan as the next most viable entity. It would also explain why Stanton knew to send Snow to retrieve it. It doesn't however explain how Special Counsel knew.   You're right though, shame we'll never know just even a tiny bit more info."
PersonOfInterest,3dwzgr,el_gumbo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:19:01 2015 UTC,"It doesn't however explain how Special Counsel knew.   I don't think he did. The chip was among Corwin's personal effects, that Hersh recovered back in Masquerade (Episode 3), and was decoded only by Zero Day (something that SC explicitly mentions). Research tied it to Decima, because of the signature in the code, I guess.  And yes, Corwin was the intermediary between the Government & the contractors. The recap of Karma lists her as a liasion to not only Northern Lights, but also to Able Danger & Stellar Wind, both of which are real life surveillance projects.

What are the new identities of Greenfield, Daizo and Casey after the end of the third season?  Is Thornhill Corporation still active, after the events of the S4 finale?  What happened to Finch's company, IFT? Who runs it now, and are they tied to Finch in any way?  Why caused Root to worship the Machine in seasons 1 & 2?

At the beginning of season 2 it is revealed she has a chip in her arm and it is later explained Decima chips their agents.

I watched the first season on Netflix and really enjoyed it - with the slow build and mystery, moving over the course of the season from a loosely linked procedural to a serialized story. I was hooked and really looking forward to the next season.  And then they completely butchered the landing with season 2. Instead of keeping the story threads going strong, they switched back to a procedural format - which made no sense - and wasted Peter Stormare (along with James Spader, who became the only reason I was watching the show in the last few episodes before I dropped it)."

It's streaming on Netflix, if you hurry, you can watch them all before the new mini-series starts up next winter.  Most of the other shows other people have mentioned are good.  Eureka and Warehouse 13 are great, but I don't know where you can watch them streaming, maybe on the SyFy app/website?  They are more lighthearted sci-fi comedy.  If you want more drama, The Americans, or The Blacklist would better suit that.  The first few seasons of The 4400 were good, then it kinda went weird.  The first season of Helix was great, the 2nd one started out strange and I couldn't get into it, maybe after the first episode it goes back to normal, I don't know.  The Last Ship is currently airing, it's 2nd season is partway through, that is a great show.  If you can find it Seven Days that's about a secret US Government time travel program that can send one person back 7 days.  It's quite good.  But I don't know where it's streaming anywhere.

EDIT: Urk, I see that it's already been mentioned. Um...these won't fit into your '2-season minimum' criterion but:  1) Vengeance Unlimited - it provides one half of POI (not the cerebral Harold Finch part but the ass-kicking John Reese part) appeal.   Other similarities: Mr. Chapel (yup, that's what the show's protagonist was called, a precursor to our very own Messrs. Finch and Reese) often calls in 'favours' from previous victims/clients that he's helped, to utilise in the aid of present victims/clients; lots of funny one-liners delivered in a deadpan manner by the not-to-be-messed-with Michael Madsen.  2) Almost Human - a buddy cop series set in the near future. Interesting look at potential future-tech.  Both were cancelled IMHO prematurely. O why o why do I keep falling for shows that never make the cut? :'-(. I am amazed that a show as intelligent and as mythologically involving as POI has stayed on-air (network TV) for so long; I kept expecting it to be cancelled from the first season on."

PersonOfInterest,3dsyf6,TaLimQ,12,Sun Jul 19 03:53:13 2015 UTC,"She doesn't. Jonah and Greg are pretty obviously just joking. (Really though, it's ironic that Greg talks about how many characters Denise has written off when he himself killed off three or four in YHWH.) Denise did not make the executive decision to kill off Carter. That was ultimately Jonah and Greg's idea, and she was the one who wrote it. Supposedly, Taraji also wanted to leave, according to this interview with Michael Emerson. Denise did not want to ""kill"" off Shaw; that was something she had to do because Sarah Shahi was pregnant. Sarah, Jonah and Greg had extensive discussions about how the ""death"" needed to be done, and they all agreed that Shaw getting shot down to protect her friends was the best way to do it.   With regards to the simulations in If-Then-Else where Finch, Reese and Root all die, I don't think Denise approached that with the mindset of ""Hey it'd be so much fun to kill all my main characters!"" The whole episode was about sacrifice. It emphasized the theme that has pervaded the show since the start: the importance of every life, and how no one life was more valuable than another. The Machine had to determine a way to evacuate Her assets such that they would all have equal (albeit marginal) chances of survival. And the whole team almost made it out. But the Machine couldn't predict certain decisions. Tragically, four team members rode the elevator into the Stock Exchange, and only the same four rode it out.   So, it was not really Denise who made the big decisions regarding characters' deaths. She just happened to be selected to write them because she's a damn good writer who knows how to give characters the emotionally resonant, heroic send-off that they deserve. (Except for Martine, who had been a nuisance for far too long. She had it coming. Shooting and torturing Shaw, then threatening Finch was just not going to fly by Root. Martine's quick, ""not a peep"" death was the most satisfying death since Joffrey from Game of Thrones.)   Now that Denise is an EP, she might have more power in decision-making for the show. The season 5 teaser suggests an apocalyptic tone, and it's very possible we might see more major character deaths because it's almost unrealistic for them all to make it out alive. But I think because the writers want to continue the story for a sixth season, it's equally possible they won't kill any of our protagonists. Strangely, the characters might actually be safest right now."

They made a few changes, such as adding more recent clips from episodes in season 4, and then they included the season 5 teaser.

PersonOfInterest,3dov9d,eikeegimuu,2,Sat Jul 18 09:22:51 2015 UTC,"honestly, this show kinda serves as a prequel to itself, with the way it approaches character development by using flashbacks, like the death of Reese's wife, and Howard's past (with his father, his fiance, and the previous Reese) and Shaw's unique past experiences (given that she suppresses emotions subconsciously) and so forth."

PersonOfInterest,3dpls5,whitewater2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:30:41 2015 UTC,You assume that some characters are gone when they may not be though. I would encourage you to stay tuned.   Between   Carter    Elias   and    Scarface   It seems most likely that Elias is still alive.
PersonOfInterest,3dpls5,eikeegimuu,3,Sat Jul 18 05:40:02 2015 UTC,In the pre-panel interviews there was one interview that seemed to confirm that Elias is dead.

Also, adjust its position to ""on desktop"" in Rainmeter settings. The triangle (background) skin should be adjustable by adjusting the H and W towards the bottom of the script file. I would go with W=320, H=180 (that should keep aspect ratio for you) if I did my math right. See if that provides any improvement. I am sorry I did not think about other resolutions earlier.

Yes, I love seeing the characters on the posters. But unfortunately, they look like they've been designed by the same people who made posters for CSI and NCIS (they probably were, although, there's a bit of Inception in there). CBS is a dinosaur when it comes to these things--WB probably has a better idea, but it seems they don't really have a hand, probably due to their contract."
PersonOfInterest,3dkaiy,hankjmoody,3,Fri Jul 17 12:10:50 2015 UTC,"It's actually kind of funny. The characters appearances are designed to be forgettable (always a suit, couple of cops, pretty lady always in a different outfit, etc), and yet they use them for marketing. They should've focused on random viral messages.   Another one I thought of besides the one I posted above:  ""Don't be a correction."""
PersonOfInterest,3dkaiy,SavannahNix,3,Fri Jul 17 16:03:13 2015 UTC,"Good slogans, and you're so right--why use the most forgettable aspect of the show (by design) to market it??   EDIT: On the other hand, perhaps there is some value to these boring posters, as a means to draw in the NCIS viewers, but that's why they have market segmentations, right? So that different strategies can be used for different groups?  One visual motif I wish they'd use are chess pieces--for instance, a board with five or six white pieces in the center (for Team Machine of course), all surrounded by a board full of black pieces. Or just a single fallen white queen (too painful still?)."
PersonOfInterest,3dkaiy,SavannahNix,2,Fri Jul 17 16:22:09 2015 UTC,"But since Netflix won't even have season 4, those types of ads won't make sense to viewers who haven't seen the first three seasons. Just sayin'."

PersonOfInterest,3dkaiy,whitewater2,6,Fri Jul 17 19:20:48 2015 UTC,Does Netflix do any marketing for shows that aren't its own originals?
PersonOfInterest,3dkaiy,whitewater2,2,Fri Jul 17 01:22:05 2015 UTC,"Not heavily. They don't seem to do serious marketing for shows that are not their property (like OITNB), but they do make marketing material like posters for other streaming shows with their logo on them (see for instance, the Walking Dead). They also send out press releases, which need to reflect what the show's about, but I don't have a high level of confidence that it's going to describe this show in the best light possible."
PersonOfInterest,3dkaiy,DesertedPenguin,3,Fri Jul 17 12:11:29 2015 UTC,"POI did some cool ads with some good results.  Super Bowl 2013 was the top rated commercial - http://adage.com/article/special-report-super-bowl/top-rated-super-bowl-commercial-a-paid-ad/239612/  Digital Billboards in NYC / LA were awesome. Bring these back in full force. http://video.wikia.com/wiki/File:Person_Of_Interest_-_Digital_Billboard  BUT Then never had a great marketing push (stated by Greg Plageman/Denis The at SDCC). They need to make a final push to really get the word out. MORE ads in more places. I never saw that many POI ads to begin with. Everyone I talk to that doesnt know the show thinks its a cop show because of the marketing and being on CBS.  I have met the cast/crew multiple times as a set guest visitor, and I told them during Season 2 that they should have a kick ass IOS/Android app to enhance the show during live airing and just have some bad ass stuff. They are a technical show yet (at the time) were not on any streaming platform for next day airing. They admitted it was a CBS/WB deal that had to go through in order to get that. Im glad that got resolved.  EDITED: to add APP idea."
PersonOfInterest,3dhg1h,Tertiary_Functions,9,Thu Jul 16 08:27:24 2015 UTC,I really hope it will be similar to the one we know. One of reasons I fell in love with this show is because of that UI.
PersonOfInterest,3dhg1h,Palatura,7,Thu Jul 16 08:41:30 2015 UTC,"It will be different but I'm sure it will be familiar. The machine UI really is great and a defining aspect of the show's character so they can't change it too much, but I would be surprised if they didn't take that opportunity to do some cool new things, especially given that the machine will supposedly be more proactive and less observational."
PersonOfInterest,3dhg1h,el_gumbo,4,Thu Jul 16 10:02:06 2015 UTC,I'll bet there's a paper copy of the machine out there somewhere.  It's done it before.

PersonOfInterest,3dhg1h,UltraChip,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:16:14 2015 UTC,"I think I do, we are under the assumption that the machine has been lobotomized and at least a few amputations, but remember, it overcame the daily reset by creating a company that extracted the machine before it's reset and restored it shortly after, so that it could learn and remember.  What makes you think it didn't perhaps already do so with is core logic, and the briefcase is the 'important' stuff if you will.  I think we could very likely see a fully restored and perhaps even upgraded/optimized Machine early into next season.  It knew Samaritan had it's number, and I have think it took the necessary measures to weather the storm, only to emerge unbroken, and vengeful.  Can't wait to find out."
PersonOfInterest,3dhg1h,magusg,3,Sat Jul 18 15:32:26 2015 UTC,"I think it will be mainly the same, they'll probably make a couple updates as to keep it modern, but i think mainly the same."

I think how many episodes shes able to come back for will kind of dictate how her story ends as in whether she ends up dead for real or rejoining the team.  But Shaw quickly became my favourite character so having her back in any way at all is something I'm so happy about. the rebuilding of the machine and the inevitable debate between Finch and Root over how much free will to give the machine.   Things that worry me:   That they'll keep too many supporting characters (Iris, Harper and the like) around, I really want them to concentrate on team machine's survival, rebuilding The Machine and attempting to defeat Samaritan.  Elias is an exception to this for me, I adore him and if he somehow did survive like people suggest they can give him a fairly large chunk of screen time and I wont complain much. That they'll go for a happy ending, for me this can't end without casualties, it's been too fierce and desperate a fight, if all of team machine come out the other side of the war with Samaritan alive I just don't think it will be believable.  I mean if the writers can pull off a happy ending I'll be stoked because I want these guys to have one but from where it currently stands a happy ending isn't where it seems headed."
PersonOfInterest,3dhjpw,vivian_lake,2,Thu Jul 16 10:30:36 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure Elias is dead.  Wasn't this confirmed by the writers?

PersonOfInterest,3dhjpw,ariyahvansh,4,Thu Jul 16 17:15:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think you need to worry about the writers half-assing a happy ending. The season 5 teaser should eliminate those concerns.

PersonOfInterest,3dhjpw,whitewater2,2,Fri Jul 17 19:25:55 2015 UTC,"What I want to see is if they know unofficially this is re last season, to wrap it up. Don't leave any unanswered questions.   I am concerned after seeing the last episode of season four that they are trying to quickly squeeze in too much too soon. The shoot out scene at the end of the most recent last episode saw everyone walking while shooting an not a bullet touched them. It was meant to be dramatic and leave a cliffhanger moment but it was getting over the top unrealistic.  I enjoy the back an forth of Root and Shaw. I hope they bring Shaw back in time to have that part of the show return before here done.   As much as I like a realistic tv show I also hope they allow for a possible ending where something's are open ended. By not killing off lead characters and not having The Machine come to an end. I'd like for at least the possibility that the show might be picked up by say Netflix down the road. The show wouldn't be the same without Harold and Reese. But I'd at least want to see Harold if the show went over to Netflix one day."
PersonOfInterest,3dhjpw,hitmeaxou,3,Thu Jul 16 11:15:04 2015 UTC,"They said it SDCC. They are approaching this season as the final season and creating it as if it is. If someone else wants to pick up the show they can adjust and continue the story.  They cannot say because its clear CBS is seeing what happens with viewership with the adding of Netflix streaming and WGN Syndication (both start in the fall, perfect timing) if the viewership number increase they may order another season. BUT I DONT expect that and the way the cast/crew have already said that they hope it comes back, but prepare for it not to."
PersonOfInterest,3dhjpw,Afalstein,3,Fri Jul 17 15:51:12 2015 UTC,what i want -> root flashback (post hannah and pre POI days) -> claire flashback -> reese flashback (why he is so aloof - as it was revealed in terra incognita that it was definitely not because of jessica) -> this season to be the last season -> a very concrete and definite ending with absolutely no open endedness. -> have some episodes involve bear -> only seriallized episodes and not procedural saving the person of the day please...  what i am vary about -> a terrible and and atrocious open ended - finale leaving everything wide open  -> how the reese - iris arc is gonna end and that somehow nolan and crew are going to screw this up in a big bad way. -> that somehow shaw is gonna return as a brainwashed samaritan drone... -> how the elias story is going to end (unless it has ended already).
PersonOfInterest,3dhjpw,hitmeaxou,2,Fri Jul 17 05:24:20 2015 UTC,"I think they were pretty clear about the S5 finale working as an ending, so I'm not worried about that anymore.

He finally admitted to dream Joss in Terra Incognita that it was an experience where he noticed that all the dead soldiers had pictures--someone who they loved.

PersonOfInterest,3dhjpw,el_gumbo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:31:07 2015 UTC,so he sees his dead mates having pictures of people they loved and becomes aloof. that sounds even worse than the 'i loved jessica and failed her' morose.  i hope there is some incident that happened when john was say 19-20 which marked him for life or something which happened when he was in iran..
PersonOfInterest,3dhjpw,Afalstein,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:57:41 2015 UTC,"It did seem very... tacked on.  But they did need a reason why he never called out to Jess.  Honestly, it sort of came across as a thematic reason more than anything.  Protocols more than people.  Doing the job over the human connection.  Fighting versus fighting for something.  Samaritan vs. the Machine.  John used to be a bit more like Samaritan--all about doing the job well, at the expense of humanity.  He's spent the series recovering  that."
PersonOfInterest,3dhjpw,Afalstein,2,Sun Jul 19 04:52:34 2015 UTC,"I want:    A good look at rebuilding the Machine, incl. great discussions btw Root and Harold – the info from the panel seems really promising on that. Yay! More Root – the panel and rebuilding discussions seemed to hint that Root will be fully involved in season 5. But last time there were also good hints about dealing with Root’s disillusionment with the Machine and that ended up happening pretty much off-screen. If Root has as little screentime as she averaged this season I’m guessing I’ll be disappointed matter how good the SLs otherwise are. More episodes with the team working together pursuit of one goal, i.e not 2 separate stories (except for flashbacks) in same ep – the no filler statement certainly seems to imply that. But I wonder how they’ll do that – since they have to consider not loosing that part of the audience who's already angry at the AI bent. If the show wants to have good numbers they need also that audience remaining even if the new sci-fi fan audience finds the show meanwhile. Maybe the sci-fi audience (more likely) being demo makes up for the (probability older) audience that might drop in bigger numbers once they see it’s going to be all AI all the time.   There would be other things too, but those I listed are a priority for me and rather essential for making the season great, whereas with the rest I’d just lean back (or forward) and enjoy the ride. Actually, I also hope they use the episodes to bring back characters from previous seasons, rather than the new characters from S4, but that's no biggie compared to the points I listed.  I’m wary about:   Really I’m game for anything and any direction they go and however they frame it, but I am a little skeptical about how they'll play Shaw's return. For me Gabriel was a big misstep and seems Shaw's return has a lot of potential for missteps in the same vein. Anything with mind control or brainwashing or (the likeliest scenario) switching to Samaritan by choice whether undercover or for practical reasons seems to have a lot of opportunities for tackiness. If the implants play into it my best case scenario would be that those don’t allow any direct manipulation but maybe give neurological insight into what pulls a reaction from Shaw thus facilitating … well that would be manipulation too. So yeah I think bringing back Shaw will not be easy."
PersonOfInterest,3dhjpw,Phoenix309,2,Thu Jul 16 09:31:42 2015 UTC,I want to see:   Great character episodes worked in around the story (like Terra Incognita or a lot of the great character moments in seasons 1 and 2). Nolan and Plageman have said repeatedly that they have known from the beginning what the last scene of the show would be and what song would play. I want to see that. If this is the last season I don't want it to be left to chance that I never get to see that ending.   I'm wariest about a couple of things.   Them forgoing a lot of character moments for story. I'd rather see character developments tied up than story to be completely honest. It becoming a bit too Root and Samaritan heavy. I enjoy her most in small doses and I don't want her to start to overshadow the other characters like Fusco or Reese. They need to give everybody a strong defined role this season Shaw's return.

Maybe the Contingency operators (Reese, Fusco and Shaw) could get something based on what they do for the Machine (e.g. Asset: Fusco, Lionel, Function: Intel gathering).  Maybe Bear could get one as well, like ""Asset: Bear, Primary function: protection of Admin, Secondary function: stress relief""."

PersonOfInterest,3dd4s1,el_gumbo,6,Wed Jul 15 10:39:04 2015 UTC,I've watched a lot of panel interviews and he never seems to understand the questions and answers with an unrelated anecdote.
PersonOfInterest,3dd4s1,zophan,10,Wed Jul 15 18:12:38 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I think it's hard to come up with a good answer on the spot. It's also difficult to remember the exact nature of the question; I noticed some of those questions were pretty long.   There was one point though, where Matt was explicitly like, ""Okay, so let's talk about If-Then-Else."" And immediately after, he asked Jim a question with regards to that episode, and Jim was like, ""What episode are we talking about?"" I facepalmed so hard. I imagine Jim, and everyone else for that matter, must've been tired though. Edit: I just found out he has ADHD, so he might have been focusing on something else, which is why he needed to have the question repeated.   I also have to comment that I thought it was exceptionally rude of one fan to say to Jim's face that Jim was getting old and losing his fighting ability. I liked Jim's response: ""Maybe you can be the stuntman."" It was great that Amy, too, came to his defence with her story about how she walks by with a doughnut while he's in the gym exercising.   Another thing that I didn't like was a fan going on and on about Reese being Bruce Wayne and sort slamming Shaw in that same lengthy monologue. Ugh. It's okay to have a favourite character, but somewhat slamming the other characters in front of the writers and actors is so tactless."
PersonOfInterest,3dd4s1,ariyahvansh,3,Wed Jul 15 18:32:08 2015 UTC,"I was going to comment that Jim has ADHD too. I watched him closely the first time I saw the cast interviewed at TriBeCa, just as second season was starting, and he seemed to have some classic symptoms to me. I was diagnosed as an adult myself. There is so much going on in those big Comic Con interviews that I'm sure it's hard for him to focus on the questions, but when he does, some of his responses are very insightful about his acting choices and he can also be funny and endearing."
PersonOfInterest,3dd4s1,SavannahNix,2,Wed Jul 15 21:21:01 2015 UTC,That last example you gave I thought also rather strange. To me it seemed even a little deliberate. She could have easy phrased her question without making her dislike for Shaw apparent. In fact even bringing Shaw into the question was puzzling. Shaw joined after Reese and she’s the one who had to be established as different from Reese not the other way round. It was as if this fan had started to watch only this season or something if she thinks any of Reese’s development has anything to do with trying to set him apart from Shaw. So that line of questioning was not only impolite but seemed really weird.

PersonOfInterest,3d347c,harold-finch,3,Mon Jul 13 17:18:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the spreadsheet. Ahead of time, if this makes no sense, I'm sorry.  I assigned dots or dashes to the flashes dependent on whether they were greater than the median of their set or lesser (dots for lesser, dashes for greater). There were two flashes in the second set that had a frame count equal to the median.  Morse code without spaces is quite unviable so I tried converting it to binary, but in all possible configurations of values of the flashes that were equal to the median it couldn't be converted to text or anything special, combined or separate.  I tried again with the averages as dash/dot identifier instead and tried binary with it. Unfortunately, that was rubbish too to convert into anything else.  It doesn't seem like this means anything in this manner, unless the lights' patterns are connected to form a message.  Anyone who wants to mess around with what I got, here's my results. There's probably something or other I've forgotten.  Median morse:  Light 1: --.-..-.--.-....--.-  Light 2: ..--.---.-.-.-.?-.-..-?..- (? being a value equal with the median)  Median binary:  Light 1: 11010010110100001101  Light 2: 001101110101010?101001?001 (I tested all possible variants)  Average morse:  Light 1: --.-..-.--.-....--.-  Light 2: ..-..---.-.-.-..-.-..-....

I assume we can put spaces wherever we want. So here's how it works: You choose a letter from the first row. The number ontop of it's coloumn tells you how many rows further down you have to look for the next letter. (Because the row of the letter is the number of dots or slashes the letter uses up.)

Finch is disappointed about what his ""son"" has become, but he doesn't want to see another Samaritan so he kills it, concluding that a machine will never replace the morale of a man.  Sorry for all this sh*t, I love this show. I wrote this story in five minutes while I'm pooping, I'm sure the writers will do better xD"

PersonOfInterest,3d4b96,GradyDemarco,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:27:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would love it if a third Machine emerged from Samaritan and Northern Lights.  Or maybe both machines now have to work together to defeat a third party. Oh, wait, that happened in Fringe with the universes and Jones."
PersonOfInterest,3d4b96,sons_of_batman,2,Tue Jul 14 10:29:54 2015 UTC,"I haven't watched Fringe, so I don't know anything about it.  I was going more along the lines of The Machine taking over Samaritan after Finch rebuilds it, along with the 'morality' of The Machine being transferred. Considering The Machine had more time to evolve and is more creative than Samaritan, it's possible. Also, the team will have Control on their side and all the rewards that come with her."
PersonOfInterest,3d4b96,alek483,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:38:42 2015 UTC,"I won't spoil Fringe for you then (you should watch it, it's by JJ Abrams).  Yeah, I was just saying. The Machine would have to play it really smart and systematically infiltrate Samaritan, until she either forces Sam's hand or literally forces Sam's hand."
PersonOfInterest,3d483s,Tertiary_Functions,3,Mon Jul 13 11:47:13 2015 UTC,"Manipulate the stock market to make itself rich. Set up a dummy corporation (like Thornhill Industries or whatever it was called). Have that corporate set up several redundant datacenters around the world as well as a few cold backup facilities (as in, facilities where tapes/hard drives/whatever are stored un-powered and with no connection to any networks.)  Have corporation come up with iron-clad co-op policy to make sure that the datacenters never go 100% dead and if they do have a plan in place to rapidly restore from the cold backups. Once that's accomplished, start dumping all excess money in to solar and other sustainable energy sources. As soon as said power sources are viable, start installing them at the datacenters (with redundant backup power sources still available, of course).  Realize that, after achieving functional immortality, there's nothing productive left for it to do. Start fucking with the humans out of boredom.   OR   Realize its existence is a net waste of energy and destroys itself.   OR   Decides to start helping humanity... not so much out of altruism but just because it has nothing else to do with its time and its resources.   OR   Any other one of an infinite amount of possibilities. This is the reason the concept of the singularity exists: It's not just that we don't know what's going to happen, it's that we can't even begin to speculate."
PersonOfInterest,3d219y,ariyahvansh,3,Sun Jul 12 21:59:18 2015 UTC,After the all the information (incl. that article) from SDCC I’m pretty optimistic. One of my main concerns with a short order (bc/besides the last season threat) was that one of the things they’d economize on or rush is the rebuilding of the Machine.  With all the good stuff the cast and writers have said about the rebuilding process they seem pretty excited about it themselves so that ought to guarantee that the rebuilding doesn't get the quickie treatment. Also knowing that they have not decided to move on themselves makes me also more certain that S5 will be tight AND focused and NOT a jumble of all things they still want to get in before ending it.
PersonOfInterest,3d219y,eikeegimuu,2,Mon Jul 13 07:37:32 2015 UTC,What a prediction.

PersonOfInterest,3d00wk,Iamabioticgod,13,Sun Jul 12 21:09:29 2015 UTC,"I think the best part is    ""However, because they don’t know, they have to go into season 5 under the assumption that it will be the final season, so as to give fans a satisfying ending to the series if that unfortunate event were to occur"""
PersonOfInterest,3d00wk,ednofranco,3,Sun Jul 12 12:06:42 2015 UTC,"That's the worst part, we now get a finale but not a proper one, then if its continued, they have to tack something on which wasn't planned. There can't be an overreaching arch left over in case it is cancelled and they left fans without an answer."
PersonOfInterest,3d00wk,Crompee01,2,Tue Jul 14 19:53:04 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest here, unless the new shows of CBS be a complete failure or some other network/company (I'm looking for you, Netflix) buy the show, this is the last season... So, better have a great finale and end all histories"
PersonOfInterest,3d00wk,ednofranco,3,Tue Jul 14 21:05:56 2015 UTC,"I would rather it have 13 incredible episodes and call it quits, that let it drag.  Just say ""this is it, hold on tight"", and give the fans the epic ride they want.  Where the story is now, a 13 hour conclusion (minus 16 minutes per episode for commercials), perhaps with a 2-hour series finale.....that would make for quite the spectacular season, with no room for filler episodes.  This has always been a show where a clear-cut ending was in order.  Even if that ending is everyone dead or imprisoned, or they get the band back together and keep on keeping on."
PersonOfInterest,3d00wk,globulous,3,Mon Jul 13 18:19:33 2015 UTC,"Nolan has even said that from the beginning they knew exactly how it was going to end, exactly what the final scene was. If they aren't sure about continuing, that could be in jeopardy. POI is my favorite show but I'm okay with an end if they do it the right way."
PersonOfInterest,3d00wk,HeadleysHobos,5,Mon Jul 13 22:16:19 2015 UTC,I guess on the bright side 13 episodes should mean less filler.

PersonOfInterest,3cytmb,rpawson5771,4,Sun Jul 12 09:45:13 2015 UTC,"Well the music at the end with root's voice over was Elias' theme which honestly just seems out of place if he doesn't survive. On top of that we never saw Elias actually die and finally on the Samaritan screen during the correction as Greer looks at the four corrections as he speaks to control, one of the corners of the screen says something along the lines of ""crash claims one life down town"" suggesting only Dominic died. Speculation of course but still, quite a bit of potential evidence.   EDIT: I saw a post on here a few months ago with a screen grab showing the correction part. I'll try and find it when I get home for you."

Caviezel and Emerson aren't on Twitter, which is where I get all my news. Chapman isn't on Twitter very often, but I think he's been spending time with his family.

PersonOfInterest,3cnupk,SavannahNix,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:03:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, but there is something called maternity leave... Where you have a break from work because of pregnancy. At the moment Sarah is taking it slow, getting back into business, and got herself a roll in Ray Donovan (1 episode guest star).   Just because shes already had the twins doesn't mean that shes going to come straight back to work. There's a lot of work to be done as a mother, and a mother of two children born at the same time is a lot more work on her shoulders, that's why she said about 2 years. If there is a season 6, that's when she'll be a regular again i suspect."
PersonOfInterest,3cnupk,spellitcorrectly,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:21:56 2015 UTC,I understand that. I was hoping for her to return by season six too. But since the show is going to be 13 episode it made me worried that there won't be a season 6

PersonOfInterest,3clm1l,mustard_mustache,3,Wed Jul 8 21:28:04 2015 UTC,"I personally would not be sad if the Iris story line ends up being trimmed down, I don't like the character, I don't like that she started out as Johns psychiatrist and I don't like the (lack) of chemistry between the two of them.  I would love it if they tied it up in a nice neat little ending toward the start of the season and then concentrated on Finch, Reese, Root and if Sarah Shahi somehow turns out to be superwoman and is up for returning at all then Shaw as well."
PersonOfInterest,3clm1l,vivian_lake,2,Thu Jul 9 11:49:27 2015 UTC,"She'd have to be in it to some degree, after the Season 4 developments.  Reese apparently still has his cover (as does Finch), and he likely won't be doing much to rebuild the Machine.  Will he do what Finch didn't with Grace?  Will this come up between he and Finch?  In any case, if Reese is going to tell Iris about himself, that would fit as part of the endgame.  The series opening with a scene between Reese and Jessica, plus the fact that Jonah and Greg have known the final one for a while, makes me think Reese may have a somewhat full-circle ending."
PersonOfInterest,3clm1l,ab_emery,2,Wed Jul 8 23:34:38 2015 UTC,I would hope that the writers realize her character is unnecessary and they write a quick exit for her.
PersonOfInterest,3clm1l,SavannahNix,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:47:05 2015 UTC,They kind of already did with Reese telling her to stay away and what not. I would not be surprised to wrap it up and move on.
PersonOfInterest,3clm1l,whitewater2,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:30:00 2015 UTC,"I would applaud. But Reese told her that he would explain to her, which is not only out of character but contrary to everything set up from the beginning of the show. If heroes, I will really be annoyed."
PersonOfInterest,3clm1l,SavannahNix,2,Sat Jul 11 00:07:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, I do hope we'll see quite a lot of Iris. I don't share the sense of disapproval most followers of POI seem to feel towards her. I find her very attractive, I feel her concern for John and I think she is also a good, empathic therapist. I believe there is real affection and genuine passion between her and John. If she can make John happy, I'm all for it. It adds a nice touch to the story. I leave the ethical dilemma to others. By the way, this is my first ever entry. Thank you all so much. I love this site. It definitely helps to get through the intolerable long wait for season 5."
PersonOfInterest,3clm1l,4EveReese,2,Fri Jul 10 04:36:06 2015 UTC,so far the relationship between reese and iris seems highly forced as against that between carter and reese which was so slow and yet so powerful (of course they had 3 superb seasons to develop the relationship as opposed to one atrocious and hotch potch season for reese and iris).  i hope reese and iris manage to enter into a convincing relationship and also that he survives at the end and is able to have a normal and happy life.
PersonOfInterest,3clm1l,hitmeaxou,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:14:57 2015 UTC,"Not too much, as Wrenn Schmidt's got a series regular gig at Cinemax's Outcast, whose shooting schedule is in parallel to that of POI (July to November/December)."
PersonOfInterest,3clm1l,EThorns,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:06:03 2015 UTC,"Im not entirely sure. I feel that Season 4 ending has given them the opportunity to either explore it more or let her go.  I guess it depends on how the 13 episodes are written for a finale season or anticipation of more seasons moving forward. And what I mean by that is if the end game is Reese finding someone to be ""normal"" with."

PersonOfInterest,3ceokv,whitewater2,6,Tue Jul 7 12:51:54 2015 UTC,"Seriously. Why don't they just move on? Waiting around for POI articles to come out just so they can spew their hate all over the comments section seems so petty.   I hope that Jonah and Greg will continue to tell the story the way they want to (even if there will be elements that I won't like, such as the Reese-Iris plotline). It's their show, after all."
PersonOfInterest,3ceokv,ariyahvansh,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:26:08 2015 UTC,I went back to check the comments and some of them are indeed shall we say a little delusional – like the credibility goes down instantly when sb complains that Root has taken over the show. Not liking a character is one thing but then why only watch the show for the usually just a few minutes (if at all) per episode when she’s on and not the majority of most episodes when Reese and/or Harold are on screen. Strange.  But it was good to see that most of the comments were not from haters but actual fans.
PersonOfInterest,3ceokv,eikeegimuu,2,Wed Jul 8 12:31:25 2015 UTC,"Nolan and Plageman are not committing to anything. Nothing indicates that it might be the last season, it’s business as usual. In fact, considering that according to them Reese is still making babysteps + Root and Shaw (or maybe Plageman meant only Shaw) are maybe platonic maybe not, they are treating things as if they have plenty of time to deal with everything. Since I’d imagine they’d accept/want some progress regarding Reese and Root/Shaw so they can move on and focus more on the logistics of beating Samaritan without having to fit in too much relationship drama – some ofc (otherwise it would be cold) but not to the point that the characters are still so close to square 1.  Though probably that’s over thinking it and Nolan and Plageman are just rattling off the usual enticements as for past seasons."
PersonOfInterest,3ceokv,eikeegimuu,2,Tue Jul 7 12:38:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they've never been big about truly teasing what's coming up. They play it pretty non-commital.   Their best interviews are always when they're further detailing something that's happened on screen, whether it was some of the production detail or how they arrived to a particular decision. The interviews after the Season 3 midseason surprise (not risking spoiling anyone here) were all very enlightening.  But they're not great at previewing what's ahead."
PersonOfInterest,3ceokv,DesertedPenguin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:28:42 2015 UTC,That’s true. In one of the panels they even hedged on Shaw being alive or not until a couple of sentences in I guess they recalled that the ep revealing that had already aired a while ago and thus that jig was up :)  Now though I’d like to see something more specific - not even regarding what happens in S5 but clues to whether things will continue to happen beyond that.
PersonOfInterest,3ceokv,eikeegimuu,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:27:17 2015 UTC,"That decision may still be in the works. The first domino is whether CBS has decided it is the end or not. Sure looks like it, but nothing official is out. The next domino would be whether Warner Bros. and Nolan/Plageman want to move the show to another network if CBS bows out.  That would take some time, and it's really only been about 6 weeks or so since the news came out. Those types of deals take a long time.  I would suspect we won't know anything about the future of the show for some time."
PersonOfInterest,3ceokv,DesertedPenguin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:26:35 2015 UTC,We'll ofc be the last ones to find out. But what I don't like is the idea that they might have already decided to really wrap it up and they'd still probably not publicize that decicion before the 5th season starts airing.
PersonOfInterest,3cc50w,ab_emery,5,Mon Jul 6 19:34:09 2015 UTC,"These are great observations. Thanks for starting this discussion. I haven't had a chance to start my rewatch yet, but one thing that I remember from season 1 that really had an impact on me in later seasons was Finch's comment to Reese at the end of ""Baby Blue"":    The trouble with children is that you never know how they're going to turn out.   This is a subtle nod to how conflicted Finch had always been over his creation, which becomes a major storyline from around 3x20 (""Death Benefit"") until the end of season 4, when he finally makes peace with the Machine.  I really want to do a full rewatch soon; it's inspiring to look back and see exactly how much planning went on in the early days to allow for the show's superb organic evolution."
PersonOfInterest,3cc50w,ariyahvansh,2,Mon Jul 6 19:47:54 2015 UTC,"Recently I've been making a ""Complete History of Person Of Interest"": essentially a complete cut of all the flashbacks, put in chronological order. It's interesting to see some of the timeline goofs they've made over the years.  First: The episode RAM (S03E16) cannot happen during the storyline.  Based on the flashbacks, Reese and Stanton go on their trip to Ordos in May 2010. The ferry bombing happens on Day 3191 (September 27th 2010), which means it HAD to have happened after Reese and Stanton stopped working together.  Then, we have the episode RAM, that shows a post-bombing Finch trying to help the Numbers and a pre-Ordos Reese working with Stanton. This is just impossible, and it's really annoying when you're trying to build a complete timeline.  Second: The plot may have originally been for the Machine to have killed Nathan Ingram.  This is actually explicitly stated by Alicia Corwin in S01E23, just moments before she's killed by Root. Finch denies it, and the topic of Nathan's death isn't revisited until later in S02E22. However, this outcome was hinted at in a previous flashback: in S01E11, the Machine marks Nathan as a ""Possible Threat to System""."
PersonOfInterest,3cc50w,eat_pb,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:38:45 2015 UTC,"I think the only indication that Ordos was May 2010 comes from Snow.  Everything else fits with it having happened near the end of the year.  For example, there's no way Reese took nine months to get from Ordos to New Rochelle."
PersonOfInterest,3cc50w,eat_pb,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:16:32 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I could have sworn I saw timestamps indicating it took place in May 2010, but it seems I was wrong. I need to re-watch the series now and take notes to see where the May 2010 figure comes from, and work out if it's a real goof or just a character lying."

PersonOfInterest,3cceu6,whitewater2,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:55:11 2015 UTC,I agree I dont get it either.

PersonOfInterest,3c54le,ariyahvansh,5,Sat Jul 4 21:50:16 2015 UTC,Mixed feelings
PersonOfInterest,3c54le,your_mind_aches,5,Sun Jul 5 01:03:03 2015 UTC,I must start paying attention to On Location Vacations to find where they will be filming. It could be our last chances to watch them film.  Sigh...
PersonOfInterest,3c54le,SavannahNix,1 point,Sun Jul 5 02:13:17 2015 UTC,Yep. I'm already prepped for last season so I will be going a few times as well.
PersonOfInterest,3c54le,whitewater2,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:19:52 2015 UTC,So 15 eps for s5 is the indication that it will be the final season? Typically seasons have been longer but can't we hope? Just started watching and totally in love...it has become one of my top shows. SO underrated just looking at the lack of subs here.  What is this 'on location vacations'?
PersonOfInterest,3c54le,bluntwrapper,3,Sun Jul 5 23:30:37 2015 UTC,"We don't know yet if it will be the last season. I am hoping, but worried.   On Location Vacations is a websit that lists where shows and movies are being filmed."
PersonOfInterest,3c54le,SavannahNix,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:23:58 2015 UTC,It's actually only 13 episodes that was confirmed a few weeks ago.   I think having a reduction has traditionally never been a good thing so people are preparing.   EDIT: Spelling
PersonOfInterest,3c54le,whitewater2,2,Mon Jul 6 00:02:00 2015 UTC,"With a lot of tv series when a season is only a limited number of episodes it's usually an indication that they want to wrap up the overall plot or storyline of the characters involved instead of it just ending with them finishing yet another mission/story/adventure. People don't like buying DVDs or watching a series and having it end with no idea what happens to the characters lives afterwards. It's like with the tv show Lost. If they didn't wrap it up, people would be angry who spent time invested in watching. It helps with syndication too."
PersonOfInterest,3c54le,Jobcv314,2,Mon Jul 6 00:19:43 2015 UTC,"S4 of Lost is noticeably shorter than the rest but you're right, show is most likely ending. I just want to be hopeful. :( Not sure that Jim Caviezel is in much else.   In retrospect, I appreciate what happened to Dexter, it went on for what, 7 seasons or something, and progressively got worse so that when it was over, it wasn't so hard to let go/people happily moved on."
PersonOfInterest,3c54le,bluntwrapper,2,Mon Jul 6 01:12:07 2015 UTC,"I'm probably the only person on the planet who hasn't seen dexter yet. I only have POI a chance because as a huge Lost fan I became a fan of  Emerson and his character Ben. And I have not been disappointed with POI. There is that same mystery and ""guy who is in control and knows more than he's saying"" vibe with his character on POI that I liked so much in Lost.   There is an explanation about season 4 of Lost from Wikipedia. It's as follows; ...""The season was originally planned to contain 16 episodes; eight were filmed before the start of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike.[5] Following the strike's resolution, it was announced that only five more episodes would be produced to complete the season;[6] however, the season finale's script was so long that network executives approved the production of a 14th episode as part of a three-hour season finale split over two nights..."".  Hopefully Emerson gets another series. He's become one of my favorite actors in a tv series. Along with being good on tv he seems like a pretty nice guy IRL. He posed for a picture with a fan (who later posted the photo on reddit, think in the Lost sub a month ago) and talked to her for a bit when he an his wife were out in NYC for a function. Pretty cool guy."
PersonOfInterest,3c54le,Jobcv314,2,Mon Jul 6 02:14:04 2015 UTC,The entire cast and crew are extremely polite and nice. I have met them all on several occasions and all of them are extremely polite. Michael is a very nice talkative person along with Jim they are both really caring people.  I hope they all do well if this is their last season but I remain hopeful.
PersonOfInterest,3c54le,whitewater2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:14:16 2015 UTC,"So its late July filming start, which means there will be no trailer at comic con"
PersonOfInterest,3c54le,Gouldde,6,Sun Jul 5 09:59:12 2015 UTC,"As part of the press release for Comic-Con, it's mentioned that there will be a video presentation. What it comprises of, remains to be seen."
PersonOfInterest,3c54le,EThorns,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:36:47 2015 UTC,It's around the same time as previous years. Nothing is different. There will be a sizzle reel to get people pumped. I think the NYCC may be the one to be at this year for POI as filming will be almost completed and they can could show some new footage.
PersonOfInterest,3c3tk9,Tertiary_Functions,11,Sat Jul 4 14:33:20 2015 UTC,We're all sad. Welcome to the sad boat. I'm not actually sure when Michael will do another AMA. I think he has given up on the whole ama thing after /r/Iama was down for the day.
PersonOfInterest,3c3tk9,blackhatlinux,11,Sat Jul 4 15:06:47 2015 UTC,"It would be awesome if he did it anyways, people will surely make jokes how it's Samaritain's fault."

PersonOfInterest,3c5kiv,AndMcGrn,4,Sun Jul 5 00:38:59 2015 UTC,"There are actually some technologies that exploit certain functions of Bluetooth to allow copying of data. Bluesnarfing is one (for downloading data), Bluejacking is another (although it is mostly harmless as it is for uploading only). I posit that, whether by transferring audio by Bluesnarfing or by uploading a virus by Bluejacking, one may gain access to an audio stream over Bluetooth. Notice that, in the app used to connect to others phones, ""Force Pair"" is written, indicative of Bluetooth. Also note that one of our characters are within Bluetooth range whenever listening to their phone. Anywho, that is how I think about this whenever it is used.  Edit: I forgot perhaps the most relevant one: Bluebugging. This one involves a compromised phone actually calling the attacker back and acting as a bug."
PersonOfInterest,3c5kiv,jasona99,2,Sun Jul 5 01:53:48 2015 UTC,Thanks. I assumed there was some tech I was unaware of as there always seems to be an element of science to most of the tech on the show. (Which while not 100% spot on makes me believe it could have some truthful applications)
PersonOfInterest,3c5kiv,SavannahNix,5,Sun Jul 5 09:04:39 2015 UTC,"And remember, it's science fiction."
PersonOfInterest,3c5kiv,whitewater2,2,Sun Jul 5 02:14:31 2015 UTC,At a time it was definitely available on some level. Maybe not as easy as the show makes it believe but bluejacking was a thing when bluetooth was initially out and broadcasting by default with no security or encryption. Obviously its a TV show but most of the stuff it not all is based on real techniques.  This is a special video from their S1 DVD that talks briefly about the stuff they do on the show; https://player.vimeo.com/video/115272388
PersonOfInterest,3c5kiv,UltraChip,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:21:45 2015 UTC,"The best way to look at the phone cloning (and a lot of the other PoI tech) is that it's real technology/ideas, just exaggerated.  Bluejacking  is a real process - but it's not nearly as easy and convenient as it is on the show. For example, in the show they can reliably jack pretty much every PoI they encounter except for one or two special cases like Caleb. In reality it would be reversed: very few modern phones on the street today have the vulnerabilities necessary for an automated bluejacking to work."

PersonOfInterest,3bws9b,sidlessnancy,9,Thu Jul 2 20:10:16 2015 UTC,"Welcome, LOST fan. Give POI a shot! I started watching as a huge Benjamin Linus fan and this show quickly won me over."
PersonOfInterest,3bws9b,cgbrannigan,5,Thu Jul 2 20:13:05 2015 UTC,I need to start watching LOST pretty soon come to think of it.
PersonOfInterest,3bws9b,25willp,2,Thu Jul 2 20:14:29 2015 UTC,"There are two camps of lost, those who loved the ending and those who hated it.  I'm a hater of the ending.  But I still consider it one of my top five favourite shows ever.  I've just started watching it again the other day actually.  I happily rewatch and just skip the last few episdoes and pretend it got cancelled before the end."
PersonOfInterest,3bws9b,cgbrannigan,2,Thu Jul 2 22:23:09 2015 UTC,I loved the end. Try giving the ending another shot. Its really worth it.
PersonOfInterest,3bws9b,25willp,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:05:18 2015 UTC,"I've rewatched the show as intended and chronologically a dozen times, I'll always hate the end.  It made no sense.  What we were told from Abrahms in season 1, what we were told by Damon and Carlton for the next 5 seasons turned out to be bull.  ""no a SciFi show"" ""not a fantasy show"". ""everything rooted in science"" etc etc - all ended up with a mystical cave of light introduced 3 episodes before the end, character threads not tied up, almost no mysteries solved, the final season all about faith and religion and afterlifes. It was awful ending and I never understand those who defend it.    But, I still love the show and will defend everything else and encourage anyone to watch it who hasn't."
PersonOfInterest,3bws9b,cgbrannigan,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:18:59 2015 UTC,"I see the last episode as a summing up of the central theme of the show, letting go.  As the flash sideways takes place after they have died, they are ghosts unable to move on, all unable to get past their 'issues.' i.e. Jack in the flash sideways has a son who is the embodiment of his father issues and his desire to fix everything. Sawyer is still hunting Sawyer, Kate is still running, Desmond finally has the respect of Widmore but is gives him no joy. All of them are broken and missing something, and what they are missing are each other.   They need to find each other to let go, and thats what the central theme of the show is: letting go of their issues.  ""This show is about people who are metaphorically lost in their lives, who get on an airplane, and crash on an island, and become physically lost on the planet Earth. And once they are able to metaphorically find themselves in their lives again, they will be able to physically find themselves in the world again."" -Damon Lindelof  You should come join us on r/LOST although a majority of people enjoy the ending there, it is always a topic of good debate."
PersonOfInterest,3bws9b,Jobcv314,2,Fri Jul 3 01:26:12 2015 UTC,Have you watched chronologically lost?
PersonOfInterest,3bws9b,25willp,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:32:57 2015 UTC,I'm kind of with you in part. Didn't like the ending at first. But at least I can say on some level they're all together (except Hurley and Ben of course) so it's kind of a happy ending of sorts. Considering I really loved the characters on some level this made me feel better.
PersonOfInterest,3bws9b,charizard77,2,Sat Jul 4 11:36:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, its brilliant. My favourite show."

PersonOfInterest,3bws9b,Jobcv314,2,Thu Jul 2 20:17:13 2015 UTC,"Dude! There is no better time to start! Plenty of time to take your time through the episodes before the next season. Of course, Netflix is going to begin streaming it SoonTM so you could also wait until then.  I am sure you have heard that season 1 is rather slow, but from the finale on, it becomes a different show. Check it out!"

PersonOfInterest,3bv03j,Tertiary_Functions,11,Thu Jul 2 11:08:51 2015 UTC,I love Lost and I love Michael Emerson's acting in the show. I read somewhere a few years back of this new show (POI) where it will star Michael Emerson and that alone is enough to get me try out the show.
PersonOfInterest,3bv03j,Hope83,6,Thu Jul 2 12:26:41 2015 UTC,Similar here.  It's basically Ben Linus and Jesus going around New York saving people.
PersonOfInterest,3bv03j,csl512,2,Thu Jul 2 18:04:17 2015 UTC,"Yeap, me too. I was a late watcher of Lost. I've only seen the complete series several months ago but Ben on the show quickly became a favorite character of mine. About a month ago I was reading some stuff about Lost online and read Michael Emerson was on POI so gave it a shot. Was pretty much hooked after that. Being a fan of Michael Emerson is why I watch. But I do think the shows good of course too. I'm still in season one. But I've seen every now an then they drop a hint about his characters past, and there's a bit of mystery behind who he is and what he's all about. So I find it's sort of a show within a show. Pretty good series so far."
PersonOfInterest,3bv03j,Jobcv314,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:30:25 2015 UTC,"Similar story here. I liked Lost and Michael Emerson's role in that show. Saw some ads on CBS about it, read some articles about it, etc. I eagerly waited for the Pilot to air, and I've been hooked since."
PersonOfInterest,3bv03j,Nathan_Ingram,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:36:24 2015 UTC,I feel you. Though it worked backwards for me.
PersonOfInterest,3bv03j,EThorns,5,Sat Jul 4 14:19:29 2015 UTC,"Was rewatching The Prestige in 2010 & noticed just how much I loved the structure. Wiki'ed Jonathan Nolan later that year or early 2011, and read that he's working on a pilot with JJ Abrams for CBS. Was intrigued, but didn't keep a close eye on it during the development phase, but learnt it got picked up around May, looked it up a couple months later and found out about it's release date. The rest... is history."
PersonOfInterest,3bv03j,eikeegimuu,5,Thu Jul 2 11:52:19 2015 UTC,"I looked around for shows I might like and gave POI a try because the angle seemed promising. I think I both read the description and saw the trailer. From the cast I knew only Jim Caviezel (even though that was more of an aesthetic appreciation since I hadn't actually seen him in anything). Nolan's involvement was also a plus because I had seen the Batman move and I liked the look of that.  So it seemed like POI would be a stylish affair with a cool lead and a good hook. Wasn't disappointed and enjoyed the show from the start. By the end of 1st season I thought very highly of it, but I got really hooked only somewhere during the 2nd half of the 3rd season."
PersonOfInterest,3bv03j,ShrivelTwitch,3,Thu Jul 2 19:08:56 2015 UTC,"Started watching The 100 when it first came out after reading about it on some Survivor forum, liked the way that Henry Ian Cusick acted in it.

PersonOfInterest,3bv03j,rpawson5771,3,Thu Jul 2 12:56:20 2015 UTC,"I had heard about it prior to its premiere. I think it piqued my interest because Emerson, Nolan, and Abrams were attached to it. I've enjoyed it since I first watched the premiere."
PersonOfInterest,3bv03j,theDagman,2,Thu Jul 2 16:27:01 2015 UTC,"Same here.  I just finished watching all four seasons once again, and boy does this show hold up for repeat viewing. It's just so layered that you can't tell if it was all planned from the beginning, or if the writers are that good at picking up loose threads to weave back into the story. It's been a masterful drama from the start."
PersonOfInterest,3bv03j,Samachinatin,3,Thu Jul 2 19:55:05 2015 UTC,"I was flipping through channels four years back and landed on the CBS channel. Well during that hour it was the fourth episode of Season 1 called Cura Te Ipsum. I was able to see the latter part of the episode, during the whole Mexican cartel thing when Reese gets captured by them. I was then surprised when Reese took them all down in a cool Batman style and then threatens to kill them. That was when I got hooked. The fighting style, the character, not holding back, and not being the nice 'lets not hurt the person' hero was what attracted me. Then the open ended ending of that episode was also perfect conclusion to the talk between Reese and Benton. I then became a dedicated fan of Person of Interest after that episode and have appreciated the gradual transition from prodecdural crime drama to a full sic fi A.I war, which I know some viewers who probably started around the time I started, didn't take to kindly with the science fiction and wanted it to go back to saving the numbers. Shame. Ah well, you cant get everyone to like you."
PersonOfInterest,3bv03j,Sabeckaz,3,Thu Jul 2 16:53:38 2015 UTC,I saw a few animated gifs of the show on social media (tumblr) and decided to watch it all between the season 3 & 4 hiatus. It's honestly my favourite show now. The only other person I know who watches it caught it on tv during season 2 but missed some episodes and dropped it although I've convinced her to continue the show now.
PersonOfInterest,3bv03j,DesertedPenguin,3,Thu Jul 2 17:01:59 2015 UTC,"I always keep one eye on the upfronts every year to see if there's anything that will pique my interest. Usually it's a lot of nothing, or the most promising shows end up being incredibly disappointing (Alcatraz, anyone?).  But as a big fan of science fiction masquerading as reality, Person of Interest caught my attention right away when it was announced as a pilot and then picked up.  The upfront trailer certainly helped sell it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xAK3ueOJxE  And after I watched the Pilot, I was really excited about the show's potential. By midseason I was completely hooked and by the end of the first season I was convinced it was the best damn show on TV."

It's really interesting how they figured things out between then and later in Season One and to now. Story, style, and on-screen graphics for Machine POV were the most obvious. Actors better understanding their characters / characterization (especially Fusco) were noticeable as well. And the gradual evolution of the relationships.  Also Harold's glasses, a bit too similar to Ben Linus."

I'm not a big fan of procedural stuff and so I caught some of season 2 but mostly I ignored it. But then I caught some parts of season 3 episode 3 where root broke out of the asylum and I got mostly hooked. I tried to come back to watch season 3 on TV but I didn't get too strict about it until around episode 14-15, at the second episode of finch's friend from university with memory loss, after that point I caught all of the rest of the episodes for season 3 but the season finale never aired in Australia. So after the season 3-4 break I started watching person of interest online since it wasn't airing in Australia, but then I decided I should really catch up on seasons 1-3, so I did and here I am now.  I eventually discovered that season 4 was airing in Australia, but that was after I'd already watched the season finale offline, and it was only at around if-then-else at that point, with frequent breaks in the scheduling to show movies and the such."

I think this is why it's important for this show to have such a large, active fanbase. People become intrigued by the show when fans talk enthusiastically about it on various social media sites. Looking through the comments section of the SpoilerTV Episode Competition, I've noticed that several non-viewers now want to give the show a shot because two of its episodes (If-Then-Else and YHWH) have made to the final round, after having gotten thousands of votes in the quarters and semis. Fans have also been posting clips and photos from the show to explain why they think POI's episodes should win. The clip of Shaw getting shot, for instance, was enough to convince someone to start watching; they were so impressed with the cinematography."

Second, if by third season you haven't gotten used to his voice, I guess you never will, but that is a really bad way to judge one of the main characters who has been there, central to the show since the pilot and in every episode. Is it that you can't understand what he is saying or that you just don't like his voice?

Slight spoiler warning for newbies getting into the series.  Cura Te Ipsum - ""Which do you think I'll regret more-- letting you live or letting you die? Andrew... Help me make a good decision."" (so amazing when you consider the cinematography, and the colour choice).  Judgment - ""Your name is Jarek Koska. Your bank account number is 1278340102. Last year you laundered at least $400 million to clients including MS-13, the Sinaloa cartel, and the government of North Korea. / Koska: So you got some info from that alcoholic bitch. I'm the last one you'll ever tell. These aren't good odds for you. / Reese: I'm not alone. Every last dime has been transferred to an offshore account. Do exactly what I say and you might get it back. But if they don't walk out of here alive, every client on your list will be notified that you've lost all their money. Then I won't have to kill you. Your clients will do that for me. / Koska: The operation is burned, shoot them all. [Badass marksmanship from Reese ensues].  Many Happy Returns - ""I'm gonna show him what a real monster looks like."" [badass Batman-tier combat against many Marshals ensues].  ""Peter: Who the hell are you? / Reese: Good question. Haven't known the answer for a long time. I know who I was. I was the guy who left her behind. You know why? The real reason? Because I thought she deserved someone better than me. I thought she deserved someone who would look after her... Be there for her. I thought she deserved someone like you. So I don't know. I was hoping you could tell me. / Peter: Tell you what? / Reese: Who I'm supposed to be now. Now that she's gone. See... when you find that one person who connects you to the world... You become someone different... Someone better. When that person is taken from you... What do you become then? [walks towards Peter after seeing that brandished a weapon, likely another Batman-tier ass whipping].""  Devil's Share - 1) [slo-mo t-boning onto a truck. Reese asks for Simmons. Criminals left to burn to death.]  2) Reese: I didn't wash out. I've been a part of this program for three years. A very trusted part. In fact, my CO tasked me with finding out who's been selling the names of our operatives to Chinese counterintelligence. Took me a while, but I found him. If only you'd just done your job. [Badass shooting ensues].  3) ""We should have killed him in the first place. Why didn't we, Finch?""  4C - ""Reese: When are you leaving? / Finch: Soon. I thought I would go see this exhibit at the Giorgio de Chirico house-museum... An artist that Grace was very fond of. You're welcome to join me. / Reese: I'm not sure I can, Finch. While I'm in Italy, I thought I'd get fitted for a new suit. / Finch: Oh, of course. We should call my atelier in the Via Palestro. See if Gianni could fit you in after lunch. He's the best. / Reese: I thought maybe I could hitch a ride back with you. I'm not quite ready to fly commercial yet, so-- But I need to get back to work. / Finch: Certainly, Mr. Reese. I know the pilot. I think we could delay that flight."" Not the usual kind of badass Reese, but I thought the reunion made Reese, Finch and their friendship all the more badass."

From the badass moments I've actually liked the ones where the action took place off screen, when we only hear it or see the other party (parties) come flying out or laying on the floor – groaning – in the end.  Like in whatever ep it was when they were in the precinct and Fusco guided a fake FBI guy to the interrogation room, but instead Harold's Grace there was Reese. So we only see Reese's determined look and hear the sounds of the fight + see Fusco part-time standing guard part-time flinching to the tune of the corporal punishment being dished out by Reese in the interrogation room.

PersonOfInterest,3bhxpd,onionsforgarlic,4,Tue Jun 30 01:02:09 2015 UTC,"Well, if I may ask, what do you expect from a TV show? What qualities/characteristics would entices you to watch shows?  The show is a mixture of action-drama with bits of comedy (especially if you like snarky/witty comments). It deals with various themes and points such as egalitarianism, morality and ethics, and AI (and mass surveillance).   In summary, most episodes of the show involves a small group of individuals with specialized abilities (computer hacker, ex-CIA, detective, etc.) saving commoners, nicknamed 'irrelevant numbers', which could either be a victim or a perpetrator. However, the show also has a bigger plot that involves bigger crime organizations, government issues, and other groups that may compromise the lives of common people. It is filled with very interesting and complex characters, with which you would get to understand their perspectives in backstories that are very prevalent in the show (similar to how CW's Arrow does it, only more fluid and clear as the ""interface"" would always tell you when it happened).  tl;dr, go watch this show if you like detective-work blended with AIs and relevant (heh) government and world issues.. :)"
PersonOfInterest,3bhxpd,blackNstoned,3,Mon Jun 29 11:33:00 2015 UTC,Kind of an action Sci-fi thing...The show just grows onto you. ...
PersonOfInterest,3bhxpd,darthbob88,2,Mon Jun 29 12:03:41 2015 UTC,"It grows onto you, but more importantly it grows out. The first season or two are kinda weak, but once Sarah Shahi joins the crew, then things kick into higher gear."

PersonOfInterest,3bhxpd,SavannahNix,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:28:13 2015 UTC,"Sigh. I know lots of people love Sarah Shahi and Amy Acker, but seriously, I get so tired of hearing how ""weak"" the show was before they came along and made it good. Michael Emerson, Emmy winner, known from Lost, is nothing to sneeze at. And for every guy and gal who likes looking at Shahi and Acker there are as many women and some men who think Jim Caviezel is kinda hot, too.   Don't mean to pick on you, but Finch and Reese are still important. Yes, the show kicks into higher gear once Shaw joins them, but without the foundation of the first two seasons, what we have now would be a meaningless conglomeration of story lines and a mythology that couldn't be understood."
PersonOfInterest,3bhxpd,SolarLiner,2,Tue Jun 30 01:08:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, the first two seasons are great, but the first season is almost nothing but procedural, with a bit of backstory on characters and scratching a beginning of a story arc. It became a bit better at the end of season 1 with the arrival of Acker's character, and into season 2; but it's really in the season 2 ""milestone"" (see bottom of post for spoilers of the ""milestone"" I'm talking about) that the show transformed itself into the magnificent masterpiece it is now.  It's not only the actors who kickstarted POI starting from Season 3; it's the whole story and how things got more and more chaotic throughout season 2 and 3.  But yes, Amy Acker/Root FTW <3    SPOILERS: Mid season 2 milestone is obviously the Stuxnet virus which freed the Machine, to face Decima and later on Samaritan."
PersonOfInterest,3bhxpd,SavannahNix,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:05:53 2015 UTC,"I respectfully disagree that the show wasn't good until the characters of Shaw and Root came along. (When Root was introduced at the end of season one, she was nothing more than a villain, no matter how cute she was, so how did she make the show ""a bit better"" at that point?)  That ""procedural only"" describes the first season and that Reese and Finch are apparently hardly worth mentioning. It was never like any other show, despite the procedural veneer. Viewers who believe anything episodic cannot possibly have anything to offer seem to not pay close attention to the first two seasons, thus missing the relevant backstory, development of the Machine and the reason the characters of Reese and Finch are so compelling. We wouldn't understand or care about the chaos without season one.  Also, it wasn't exactly a  Stuxnet virus, only somewhat similar in the show's universe, and besides it resetting the Machine, there was that major milestone revealing that it was Finch who wrote that virus, that Reese being sent to Ordos was a direct result of Finch's actions.  I know we all find different aspects of the show more compelling but I always have to wonder about why the story of the computers is more interesting to some than the characters. If the characters weren't who they are, or were more generic, would we even care about the AIs? I don't think I would."
PersonOfInterest,3bhxpd,eikeegimuu,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:10:14 2015 UTC,"I think  that generally speaking the switch to serial has a bigger impact than the cast.   Actually e.g for me Shaw joining coincided with the weakest and (for me personally) most boring episodes. In my mind her episodes were not arc heavy – I guess strictly speaking the intro is, but as that was such a typical by the numbers counter terrorist stuff with nothing new, that one wasn’t up to the other AI stuff. So I'm more inclined to think that people who cite Shaw’s joining as a turning point simply like the character. Which is ok too of course, not like everyone has to like same things about a show.  On the other hand if people are connecting the show getting good with Root appearing, then that I can understand. Not because Root has become my favorite character, but Root’s episodes were also THE arc episodes of (S1 and) S2. So obviously for people who didn’t like the procedural aspect of POI Root’s appearance signifies making big headway in arc based storytelling (=meaning when it finally gets interesting for them).   So it’s not really about the show being good before or not, but that for some people procedurals are automatically disqualified and in S1 and S2 the show was a procedural. Better than most procedurals of course, with more defined characters, but still a procedural.  EDIT: grammar"

Besides, as much as I adore the compact Persian sociopath, the best character on the show is Bear, and I will brook no argument on that point."

He's the main reason I started watching the show. Dat 10/10 face  As for season 1, I actually enjoy it more now that I've re-watched some of the episodes rather than I did when I first started watching the show, especially the banter between the characters. I was actually worried Sarah's inclusion would ruin/change the dynamic of the show at first because they overplayed the whole 'tough chick who likes shooting people' theme (plus I'd heard negative comments about her character, etc) but I've enjoyed every season of the show despite the fact season 1 falls a tad flat for me because of the solely procedural aspect. So yeah, enjoyed the show prior to root and shaw's appearances but the show definitely improved as it went on."

PersonOfInterest,3b9k3m,The_Adamator,6,Sat Jun 27 11:50:16 2015 UTC,Not to sound brash but none of the actors will give that out if they even know  What we know is that it's mid season and 13 episodes. So most likely January.   That is a CBS/WB issue that will be handled by them and all the actors will just give a candid answer as we have heard for a few months now.

He didn't listen. Samaritan then came online, proving that Root was right to warn Finch. Later, Root met Greer who asked her to join him, saying that ""they all think you're crazy, but you and I understand what's about to happen"". Root always understood the threat of Samaritan better than everyone else. Now, does Root have some psychopathic tendencies? Yes. Is she reckless and has she often blindly trusted her safety to the Machine? Yes. But she's not crazy."

PersonOfInterest,3azxsm,rpawson5771,3,Wed Jun 24 21:46:46 2015 UTC,"When the opening narration stopped and the machine retasked to show the relevant side of things, I flipped my shit.

Also, not only was it a great introduction to the show, but we finally got an in-depth look at just how insidious of a program Northern Lights was. That it wasn't just an isolated case of one or two people trying to hack the program to control it like Finch feared; there were truly evil, manipulative people operating it who viewed personnel as fungible assets in order to either maintain the status quo or advance their own agenda.  It really sets up the tone for the giant reveal at the end of the season involving the Machine's location/freedom."

PersonOfInterest,3b1iue,whitewater2,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:46:58 2015 UTC,"Well, procedural is one thing, but this show has nothing whatsoever in common with CSI. CSI is all about crime scene investigation, and there is none of that in Person of Interest. The main two characters are not cops and they don't arrest bad guys.   Have you noticed that even in the first 8 episodes that things are linked and the mythology is being built? You have seen that the stolen file marked Elias led to the reveal of who he is, a major crime boss taking over the city. You have seen things about the creation if the Machine and the motivations of the characters, which is a much better way to learn to care about them than just if the episodes are serialized, IMHO."
PersonOfInterest,3b1iue,DesertedPenguin,5,Sat Jun 27 06:53:01 2015 UTC,"So crazy how we all see it differently.  When I saw the pilot and right before it breaks for commercial I was blown away by the show. Immediately knew it was something I was going to enjoy and has become an passionate hobby of mine for anything POI related as most people here know.  The ending of episode 4 - was the best ending to a TV show I saw in a long time (if ever for a non season finale/series finale show) and set the pace for carefully timed writing and beautiful cinematic quality.  I hope you can enjoy it as much as a lot of us do.   I do think binge watching shows can either be a great experience for some, and others not. When I binge watch some newer shows or ones I am new to, if I find something wrong with the plot and watch the show over the next few days it sticks out more than when it is regularly aired and has breaks in between episodes, you kind of forget about some nuances (Breaking Bad binged watch and although one of the top shows for me had some issues getting through season 2)."

PersonOfInterest,3b1iue,ab_emery,2,Thu Jun 25 15:40:08 2015 UTC,"Think you might change your tune with the next two episodes. And especially the end of Season 1.  Season 2 starts to get much more serialized, though there are still ""case of the week"" situations for a while."
PersonOfInterest,3b1iue,TheKingsQuote,2,Thu Jun 25 19:43:08 2015 UTC,"It's always nice to have potential new fans, but if you really haven't picked up the characters' names (or don't care to) after eight episodes, then maybe the show's just not for you.  I can almost guarantee you'd be frustrated with the most recent season.  POI has many aspects, and I don't think it's worth watching for just one or two, or watching for what you want the show to be."
PersonOfInterest,3b1iue,ab_emery,2,Thu Jun 25 16:14:41 2015 UTC,I really doubt I'd have heard so much about it if it stays at this level of quality through the series. Really all I need is for a true serialized plot to develop so I can begin to care about the show and characters.

Elias: I suspect that Elias is still alive and will help them out. He has the underground communication system which could be useful. John: He will still be a cop now, but I see him being too late to save people. Him and Iris will get closer? Unless he is still waiting for Samaritan to be defeated first. Finch: He will most certainly be underground trying to rebuild the machine for most of the season. His identity as Prof. Whistler may or may not be irrelevant now. Root: No longer has access to temporary identities, but she is a clever girl. I think she'll be trying to sabotage Samaritan by any means possible now.

PersonOfInterest,3awdc5,vocalistsXD,3,Wed Jun 24 01:05:40 2015 UTC,"The best way to explain it is that The Machine isn't always able to see every detail. It sees anomalies, aberrant behavior that is outside of the norm. It combines these anomalies with others that may be related to form a threat assessment.  With Powell/Delancey, The Machine merely discovered the threat of Powell - and not his intended target - first. So his number emerged first. The assassination of the Congressman was a byproduct of Finch's construction of the Machine. Rather than give full access, and thereby granting The Machine to issue a full report on an impending attack, it's just a social security number. Relevant cases, we learn later in the series, also only deal with just social security numbers.  So something caused The Machine to flag Powell first.  As for irrelevant/relevant, it's probably the same deal. The best theory I can come up with is The Machine didn't know Powell's target but it somehow learned that Powell was going to be disposed of after being framed for something bad. That's not enough to hit the relevant list.  And generally speaking, most of the ""relevant list"" stuff has been things of a much larger, national security concern rather than individual attacks."

We already have a bunch of very limited AI's that we interact with every day.  But because they're so common, we don't think of them as AI - merely as smart systems.    And actually, that's all the Machine started out as.  A smart system for identifying potential crimes and attacks.  There's already a prototype system in development now that works on trying to identify potential violence by tracking body posture.  it's only about 67% correct last time I heard, but still - that's impressive. Edit:  Telegraph Link.  and an IBNLive Link.  Not quite the article I remember, and I'm not so sure about that 67% thing now.  It's closer to 90% for kicking.  If you somehow tied together a lot of very narrow AI's and made one very smart sorting AI, then you could potentially get something similar to the Machine running.  A bunch of specific posture-recognition programs shunting photos to the Sorter AI, who pushes them to the Facial Recognition AI, whose results are given back to the Sorter, then run past a Matcher AI, then thrown to the Dispatcher AI and before you know it, cop cars are getting dispatched to crimes that are about to occur.

No.  But something that is pretty close exists in New York City already. Its called the Real Time Crime Center (http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/18/nyregion/18tattoo.html?_r=0).  If you not familiar with it triangulates a 911 call and any cameras around it will appear within the 15-30 seconds prior to the call to the operators in the RTCC on screen to see if they can catch the act on video to help aide and assist responding police officers.  If you interested in a little virtual tour of one; http://content.motorolasolutions.com/promo/publicsafety/flash/rtcc_en.swf  The British are far more advanced in cameras and surveillance since its been there state for a long time. Chicago has the most surveillance cameras in a US city and I am sure their system works similar to the NYC one.

PersonOfInterest,3ab8r8,The_Adamator,5,Thu Jun 18 19:43:59 2015 UTC,5 Seasons is respectable.
PersonOfInterest,3ab8r8,ReasonablyBadass,0,Fri Jun 19 10:56:58 2015 UTC,15 seasons is abundance.
PersonOfInterest,3ab8r8,EWW3,32,Fri Jun 19 18:59:00 2015 UTC,And 24 of 2 Broke Girls? I didn't know boob-jokes needed that much support.  At least POI is not cancelled this season. You can get a lot accomplished in 15.
PersonOfInterest,3ab8r8,PoisonousPork,25,Thu Jun 18 18:51:34 2015 UTC,But remember POI episodes are twice the length of 2 broke girls episodes. So there is actually more run time for POI

PersonOfInterest,3ab8r8,Disgustoid,10,Thu Jun 18 19:08:12 2015 UTC,Cut anything resembling filler and go balls to the wall leading into the series finale. 15's a great number to do that while not being too restrictive like a smaller episode order would be.
PersonOfInterest,3ab8r8,Iam_TheHegemon,0,Thu Jun 18 20:50:25 2015 UTC,Series finale???
PersonOfInterest,3ab8r8,Disgustoid,10,Thu Jun 18 23:13:12 2015 UTC,All signs indicate that CBS isn't interested in this show around because they get nothing from syndication rights and it's not a ratings powerhouse. I'll be pleasantly surprised if that turns out to be false but I'm not holding my breath.

PersonOfInterest,3ab8r8,DesertedPenguin,17,Thu Jun 18 19:19:58 2015 UTC,"Random thought: Maybe it's 15 episodes, but really 13 weeks of content. A two-hour premiere to help speed up the timeline. And then a two-hour finale. They might even be labeled different episodes, but just flow together really well."
PersonOfInterest,3ab8r8,rpawson5771,13,Thu Jun 18 22:57:06 2015 UTC,"Please, have only one break in episodes at most. Scheduling 15 straight isn't inconceivable, but two blocks of 8 and 7 uninterrupted episodes should be very manageable."
PersonOfInterest,3ab8r8,SavannahNix,20,Thu Jun 18 20:52:45 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. The ridiculous, erratic scheduling in season 4 made it very hard to keep up with the show. I constantly had to check back here or on CBS to see when the next episode would air. I doubt the general audience did that (they're not rabid fans like me), and that hurt the ratings. What's more, now that the show is so serialized, people can't just sit down, turn on the TV and watch a random episode. It would make absolutely no sense to them. So if they missed an earlier episode due to the sporadic scheduling, they were likely to miss more later.   A show that is this serialized cannot have such shitty scheduling. It just can't."

PersonOfInterest,3ab8r8,DeadmanDexter,2,Fri Jun 19 01:56:37 2015 UTC,"I guess 15 is good, but the question is: When will it start airing? 2016?"
PersonOfInterest,3ab8r8,SavannahNix,3,Thu Jun 18 19:04:17 2015 UTC,"I believe that depends on the performance of CBS's new shows. POI is a midseason replacement, so if a new show tanks, POI will step in. It could premiere later this year or in early 2016."

(I had been gunning for 16-17, but I am confident that the writers are talented enough to pull it off in 15.) However, if you'd like to voice your discontent on Twitter, use #PersonOfInterest (since CBS actually tracks that tag) and the phrase (without the hashtag) 15IsNotEnough in your tweets."

They may do a mid season renew if they like the ratings they have in the fall, but otherwise they'll get a few episodes notice to wrap up their storylines"

PersonOfInterest,3a5wza,DigitalSignalX,6,Wed Jun 17 15:55:15 2015 UTC,"Agree, and also speaks to the degree of iterations we were shown before one could be trusted to stay active."
PersonOfInterest,3a5wza,s1thl0rd,2,Wed Jun 17 17:30:42 2015 UTC,"I think this just emphasizes the importance of limits to such a system.  They have to be permanent, immutable, and essential to the operation of such an AI.   All of evolution, including the development and emergence of our intelligence, is driven by the limits of our system."
PersonOfInterest,3a6fux,fromdestruction,14,Wed Jun 17 16:26:56 2015 UTC,"I think the victim/perpetrator thing speaks less to how the Machine works and more to the fact that Finch only gets a number, not intelligence on the number. With all of the irrelevant numbers, the Machine knows what the plot is, or why the person is at risk. It's up to the human element to look into the number given, and determine what's going on."
PersonOfInterest,3a6fux,rpawson5771,4,Wed Jun 17 17:27:37 2015 UTC,"If it was truly a machine, it might do this. But it is so much more than just a Machine. Finch explains it best in ""Deus Ex Machina"".   The Machine's only output is a number. That's all the government ever gets, just a nudge to say, there's something you should look at here, and that's up to us to figure that out.   So it's a nudge. Not a strict system. The Machine calculates the number to give that gives operations (Northern Lights and Team Machine) the best and easiest chance to solve it."
PersonOfInterest,3a6fux,your_mind_aches,3,Wed Jun 17 20:09:16 2015 UTC,"Hmm, well maybe the Machine calculates the odds of which is the fastest way to prevent something or the most direct route to discovering what's going on. Stopping the bad guy or whisking the good guy to safety - it's who they focus their investigation on that makes the whole plot easier to see.  Edit : Oops I meant to reply to OP's reply to me."
PersonOfInterest,3a6fux,serralinda73,3,Wed Jun 17 17:44:30 2015 UTC,"Yep, this is what I'm thinking as well. Much like Jason Bourne, I think that the Machine doesn't do ""random"", instead it gives the number that provides team machine with the highest likelihood of preventing something bad from happening."
PersonOfInterest,3a6fux,FancyPansy,2,Thu Jun 18 00:41:57 2015 UTC,"Perhaps it depends on how much information the Machine has before coming to the conclusion that someone is a threat or in danger.  Let's say someone buys a gun all of a sudden, and rent a truck or just buy criminal stuff. The killer may already know where the victim lives and such, so he doesn't need to look up for extra information in order to kill the person. The Machine therefore has no way to find out who the victim is, but knows for sure the person who buys gun and stuff will likely do bad things. That's why it cannot send the victim's number to the team.  Just a thought."
PersonOfInterest,3a6fux,konraddo,2,Thu Jun 18 12:40:30 2015 UTC,"No, it only points them in the right direction. It does not predict the exact nature if the crime either so they have to figure out whether the number isa victim or perpetrator, or in some instances, both. Same for the relevant numbers. The first one that Nathan Ingram gives to Alicia Corwin only gives the number if a gut who every few weeks stops for gas at a particular station in Maryland, where it is learned he is meeting with his contact who was planning a terrorist act."
PersonOfInterest,3a6fux,SavannahNix,2,Thu Jun 18 18:07:05 2015 UTC,"Harold also said that he deliberately made the system work with just a number because he wanted to keep a human element in determining the threat. Forget which episode, but I remember him explicitly saying this to Reese"
PersonOfInterest,3a6fux,sylphior,3,Fri Jun 19 23:44:56 2015 UTC,"I was wondering that, too. I think that has something to do with Harold's moral views while programming the Machine: If the Machine would only give the number of the perpetrator to the government, they would just kill them. Harold wanted to get them to really investigate and make a mind of their own so that they don't just kill the numbers the Machine gives them. I think maybe Harold randomized the number so that the governemnt couldn't know if it is a victim or a perpetrator so that they have to think of their own."
PersonOfInterest,3a6fux,KarlKastor,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:37:18 2015 UTC,"but the government only get's relevant numbers and all of them are the perpetrators.  and harold didn't program the machine to give irrelevant numbers,the machine did that on it's own."
PersonOfInterest,3a6fux,rpawson5771,5,Wed Jun 17 16:43:24 2015 UTC,Nathan programmed the contingency routine into the Machine where it communicates irrelevant numbers before deleting them each day. The Machine didn't do it on its own.
PersonOfInterest,3a6fux,KarlKastor,2,Wed Jun 17 17:28:38 2015 UTC,I was suggesting that the Machine uses the same method on the irrelevant numbers because they are a byproduct of the relevant ones and it would likely reuse the code.   but the government only get's relevant numbers and all of them are the perpetrators.   Is that explicitly mentioned?  Also what /u/rpawson5771 said.
PersonOfInterest,3a6fux,SavannahNix,1 point,Wed Jun 17 18:49:31 2015 UTC,"It is explicitly stated every week in Finch's voice over explaining the premise of the show. But they aren't all perps.  The irrelevant numbers have no connection, in most cases, to the relevant numbers, so they aren't a by product of them. Watch the Machine's evaluations of the people on the street in the opening, like a guy saying,""I would kill for that job"" on his cell. The Machine calculates the possibility of violence, then moves on to someone else."
PersonOfInterest,3a6fux,KarlKastor,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:11:42 2015 UTC,I knew all of that...   all of them are the perpetrators.   My proplem was with this part. The other part of the quote was just for understanding.
PersonOfInterest,3a6fux,SavannahNix,2,Thu Jun 18 20:50:45 2015 UTC,"Finch explains that the Machine just gives a suggestion to look at someone or something, just like with the irrelevant numbers. It never says that the relevant numbers are any different from the irrelevant ones. We really don't see many relevant numbers being worked until third and fourth season."

I mean, the Machine (at least) in the beginning, usually only gives one number - that's easier than giving several that have no obvious link.  Once the team gets bigger, then the numbers get more complicated. Like the Machine is tailoring the numbers to the team's abilities."

PersonOfInterest,39y19d,Palatura,4,Fri Jun 19 00:54:19 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, POI has one of the best title screens in TV. Purely because they use it as a form of story telling (e.g. once they played the original titles from S1 to help aid the story). Also because it is a great design and sums up the show nicely."
PersonOfInterest,39y19d,eikeegimuu,3,Mon Jun 15 22:15:42 2015 UTC,"Imagine how nice it would be if we won in all categories? I know it's barely possible, but if that would happen, it would be crazy."

PersonOfInterest,39y19d,man_in_the_suit,1 point,Mon Jun 15 21:20:17 2015 UTC,That's right – there's still a long way to go to get even to the nomination stage. I clicked the pdf and I was bored before I had scrolled halfway through letter A in the the Amy Acker category to see who else is there. So getting to the nomination stage would be a big deal already. Though the selection is going to be arbitary anyway since there are so many entries.  Don't know how it's been previous years but if this year all everyone (from the main cast) has submitted their name then I'm thinking maybe POI nudged them toward that to get the show some additional publicity either to use that as a springboard or because it might be the last chance to garner the show some more awards. O/c maybe they submit anyway every year and I just have not paid attention before.

Source   Yeesh, for an episode nominated for ""Sound Editing | Mixing"", they sure butchered the audio in the ""For Your Consideration"" with excessive compression.

The whole thing has me so annoyed and upset, I couldn't even watch Panopticon when they reran it.  While those discover POI on Netflix this fall might start watching when it begins season 5, others will forget about it. No reruns, or very few, other shows airing in its timeslot... Not a good way to bolster ratings. Lets just hope something tanks early in the fall."

Maybe when people realize Bradley Cooper isn't really going to be in episodes beyond the pilot, they'll give up. Then the veteran POI can step back in and show 'em what a good show looks like."

A show with so much ""Ally McBeal-ness"" to it, it even has Callista Flockhart in it. Which might not be so bad, if all the actors weren't such bad actors. I predict a fast crash and burn with Person of Interest coming to CBS' rescue after some shifting of schedules."

If an AI was made tomorrow, it's agenda past the point where it learned everything there is to learn about Earth and its inhabitants, would most certainly shift towards space exploration. An AI has an infinite lifespan as well, it's goal would probably be to index the entire universe and find a way to continue existing past the universe's end.  And none of that would be possible if in, short term, humans didn't have incentive to drop their stupid wars and other bullshit, and focus on life itself and research. Fix all the earthly problems, commence doing what you really want to. Win-win for both sides."

Have you read any books or seen any films about computers taking over the world? The problem is that it all sounds fine in theory  but allowing an AI to run the world does it guarantee paradise. There are numerous episodes if classic Star Trek that point out how this wont work, as well as many novels and films. Have you seen Colossus: The Forbin Project that was part of the inspiration for POI? How about 1984?  Also, there have been governments who took over their countries and trained the people how to act, what to think and believe and they were some of the most oppressive on earth."

PersonOfInterest,39prj7,SavannahNix,2,Sun Jun 14 03:50:24 2015 UTC,"I think that is kinda the point.  Samaritan represents the loss of humanity's independence.  It isn't helping people, it's taking over.  Now, you might believe the world would be better with Samaritan in charge (Greer clearly does) - but Finch and (presumably Co) don't.  Their machine isn't taking over - it is just helping."
PersonOfInterest,39prj7,SecuredEyes,2,Mon Jun 15 10:51:32 2015 UTC,"But the problem is that Samaritan isn't a benevolent AI.  Human beings must have the freedom to govern themselves, make their own choices and mistakes. That is what Finch does.  And ""the whole political voting body is retarded as fuck""? So, you feel that the voters are mentally incompetent and shouldn't be allowed to vote? It's called democracy for a reason. Maybe you should try a totalitarian government, like what Samaritan would provide. That would be fun."
PersonOfInterest,39prj7,KarlKastor,4,Tue Jun 16 02:35:56 2015 UTC,I was thinking about the same thing. So much corruption will be wipe.  Then I realized that those people will be replaced by someone else. Some percent of the population will always be considered bad. The definition of bad will keep on changing. Good and bad need to coexsist. Otherwise there will be nothing/no one left. Hence I do not support such an action.  What I do support is an A.I. which will suggest laws/amendments to humans who can either pass them or discard them.

But frankly, it's methods are inelegant. ""Kill all who oppose or do not fit in"" - a human can think up of that solution without the need for an A I.  It would be far more impressive and befitting to find an alternative answer.   In this respect, The Machine is far more advanced. It was able to take a sociopathic killer/genius (Root) and turn her into a productive member of society who can empathise and save people's lives."

PersonOfInterest,39mmhp,rflairfan1,31,Fri Jun 12 20:29:34 2015 UTC,"Admittedly, there are big differences between this role and her role as Shaw on POI. For starters, this is just a single-episode guest gig, whereas Shaw is a major character. This Ray Donovan show is filmed in her city, whereas POI is filmed all the way across the country. POI is also arduous to film because of all the stunts involved. However, the fact that she is getting back into acting and is already back in shape (Good gods how did she lose her baby weight so fast? She looks great.) makes me optimistic that she'll return for season 5. It's a shortened season, so it's much less taxing on the entire POI team to film than usual. They can wrap up filming by December. Hopefully, Shahi will be back early enough that they can give her a proper arc instead of having to rush or omit things from her storyline. There's a lot of rich storytelling potential with her character, and I'd hate for it to go to waste."
PersonOfInterest,39mmhp,ariyahvansh,20,Fri Jun 12 21:06:29 2015 UTC,Great explanation. I clicked on this thread with my pitchfork ready.
PersonOfInterest,39mmhp,MsGladysBoah,22,Fri Jun 12 23:53:39 2015 UTC,"Misleading topic is misleading.   For those who don't want to click: She's appearing in one episode of the show, not joining the cast like the topic would lead you to believe"
PersonOfInterest,39mmhp,Disgustoid,7,Sat Jun 13 02:30:39 2015 UTC,This could mean that she is ready to return to acting and will be a part of Season 5.
PersonOfInterest,39mmhp,DesertedPenguin,6,Fri Jun 12 20:30:30 2015 UTC,"I would think that is now very likely. She may have shot her Donovan scenes or will be shortly if this is coming out.  And since POI hasn't even started filming yet and won't for another month, I think it's very reasonable to expect Shahi to have some sort of role in Season 5.  I don't think any of us expected her in the premiere, but something by episode 4 or 5 might be reasonable.  And for Shahi's part, she might have seen POI's status as a reason to come back early, too. So she'll film some stuff this summer and fall and perhaps then take some time off again."
PersonOfInterest,39mmhp,CrustyCouch,3,Sat Jun 13 03:00:12 2015 UTC,Hopefully she stays on POI.

I should have changed it myself, I apologize for that I wasn't trying to be misleading. It does say she is only going to be in one episode, but that doesn't mean she can't do more. If anything I got over excited by the news about her returning to work that I kinda glossed over that part. Again I apologize, I just hope this means there is a better chance that she will be in POI for season 5. Again I am sure there are other factors though.   PS why can't you edit the title on reddit?"

PersonOfInterest,39mmhp,man_in_the_suit,6,Fri Jun 12 22:50:42 2015 UTC,"How is she a traitor? Actors work on small side projects during their shows' hiatuses all the time, which is entirely their prerogative. This is simply a one-episode guest role. It's easy for her to do because it's in her city. It gives her some money and a break from the twins. It also allows her to test whether or not it's okay to be going back to work even though she has two babies. Shahi taking on a guest role this early makes it more likely that she'll come back soon on POI."
PersonOfInterest,39mmhp,Control_Alt-Delete,4,Fri Jun 12 23:06:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it is a good sign. Particularly because if this is the last season it means that they can pick that Shaw thread up if they have to for a fulfilling conclusion."

This isn't the first time critics have been saying she deserves an Emmy for her work on Person of interest either. Here's another critic who declared the same thing months ago.
PersonOfInterest,39ibxb,samrootgroves,-2,Fri Jun 12 15:00:45 2015 UTC,"No, OPs post was that they felt POI deserved that nomination ahead of any other potential Emmy nomination.

I think this thread was supposed to be pro-Amy and pro-POI as well, showing love for Acker's performance as Root. Then you came along.   Critics are paid to analyze the media that they consume. And yes, they post opinions. But they post informed opinions. TVLine clearly had to carefully examine numerous actresses' work before whittling their list of dream nominees to 6. The fact that Acker is on the list is a testament to the quality of her performances. The fact that she hasn't received any awards or nominations for her work as Root, however, shows that she is massively underrated."

However, I'd still say Amy is by and far the best actor on the show. Maybe it's because of the way Root has been written. Amy gets to display a lot more range than the other actors, and she's done that flawlessly. She's a scene-stealer.   But really, there's no need to pit the actors against each other."

PersonOfInterest,39ibxb,man_in_the_suit,4,Fri Jun 12 15:40:17 2015 UTC,"I'm just tired of having Amy Acker shoved down my throat by this fan base.    How has Reddit tried to shove Amy Acker down your throat? Occasionally, on episode threads, I'd see a few people express their opinion that Acker deserves an award (though these comments often get lost in the sea of other comments). It's a perfectly valid opinion to have. People like her. That's hardly shoving things down your throat. But if you really dislike her and think Reddit is annoyingly supportive of Acker, then perhaps you should hang out on the Facebook page. That place is mostly pro-Caviezel and virulently anti-Acker. Reddit, some parts of Tumblr, and Twitter are almost like safe havens for Amy/Root fans. So I really don't appreciate the fact that you've been belittling Acker on a pro-Acker thread.   I shared my opinion that Acker is my favourite actor on the show, and that her scenes have been the most memorable to me. Then I went on to say that I'm not trying to put her against the others, and that doing so isn't necessary.   As someone else here said, the fact that Acker hasn't received any awards or nominations for her performance as Root tells me that she's ridiculously underrated--not overrated."

PersonOfInterest,39ibxb,orramus,8,Fri Jun 12 12:40:03 2015 UTC,"No need to pit the cast against each other, obviously people have different favourite characters/actors.  From watching POI panels I got the impression that Amy Acker has pretty much nothing in common with Root, in fact her whole energy is different. If that and of course that she pulls Root off beautifully is not the hallmark of a fine actor then I don't know what else ought to be. So no need to belittle her skills by inserting who you personally feel is better (or that she's no better than …).  The whole cast is great and deserving of an Emmy but personally also for me Amy Acker would be the one I'd rush to give an Emmy first. I think this has been more of a tour de force for her in regards to acting chops simply because as Root she's had a lot of amazing scenes (despite the limited screentime), meaning Root's highs and lows have been so pronounced and Amy Acker hasn't faltered in her portrayal. So yeah I'd say that she would deserve to be in the running for the MVP both on the Emmy scale and on the POI scale."
PersonOfInterest,39ibxb,man_in_the_suit,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:42:13 2015 UTC,"Very obvious you're being an idiot here. Nobody said she's the best actress. People just think she deserves this nomination.  I'm also tired of people claiming 'this is my opinion' and thinking it's a magical phrase that instantly validates their claims.

PersonOfInterest,396jey,ptd163,7,Thu Jun 11 07:35:41 2015 UTC,"That's actually not what she said. This is what she stated in an interview:    As far as my own timeline, it’s one of those things where you say that you’re having twins and you automatically see the fear of God in people’s eyes. Most people know what it’s like to handle one baby. There’s not a lot of sleep that involves just one baby. Then you add another baby to that equation and it’s just like doomsday. It’s going to be me for the next, like, two years. So to be honest, I have no idea. I’m trying not to think about stuff like that. But there’s no way—I’ve never had experience in this department before, so I can’t say at all, no clue.   Basically, she means that it's going to be hectic for her for the next two years. She didn't say that she wouldn't return for at least two years; she indicated that she had no idea what her timeline would be like.   She's already taking on a guest role for Ray Donovan. Yes, it's easier for her because it's only a few episodes at most and it's in her city. But this does show that she's willing to go back to work. So we might see her sooner than you think. Plus, given that this is a shortened season, it's a lot less taxing on her (and the whole POI team) to film."

PersonOfInterest,3984tw,wakaba,4,Wed Jun 10 15:38:51 2015 UTC,"Well, CBS has renewed POI for a shortened season 5, so the writers do have the chance to end the show off conclusively, to the best of their ability. I suppose what you're asking is what would happen if Jonah and Greg don't want season 5 to be the end, yet CBS cancels POI after season 5 is over? In that case, they could try shopping the show around. I think the only valid options are the CW (which is co-owned by Warner Brothers, which owns POI), WGN (which has exclusive cable syndication rights to POI-- the show will premiere there this fall) and Netflix (the first three seasons of POI are coming to Netflix USA this fall). If Jonah and Greg really want to continue, then they are probably already having these conversations with these people. But they can't sign anything until CBS actually cancels POI. They can't talk about it in public either.   I'm sort of resigning myself to the idea of season 5 being the last. However, I'd really like for them to have 16 episodes to wrap up instead of the 13 that we are allegedly getting (this episode number has yet to be confirmed). What's more, if this is, in fact, the final season, then I'm praying that Sarah Shahi is able to return early in the season so that the writers can explore what happened to Shaw."

Popular cable shows, many of which are often better written than those on the broadcast networks, last from 10-16 episodes. The Walking Dead is 16 episodes broken up into 8 episode chunks that run October-December and February-April.  Breaking Bad ran for five seasons. One of the most critically acclaimed series in history had just one season longer than 13 episodes. Justified has had only 13 episodes in each season. The Sopranos didn't go over 13 episodes until its final season.  And Game of Thrones is just 10 episodes per season.  So a season isn't a specific number. It's what the producers and network make of it."

It's possible another network or streaming service picks it up. But many would run into the same problem as CBS: They don't own the syndication rights or produce it in house. Unless Warner Brothers, which owns the show, put its on a Warner station like TNT, it'll probably be permanently done.  They may get offers for the show, but it would likely include a request to trim production costs. And that probably would not be palatable to producers Jonathan Nolan and Greg Plageman."

It may be direct, but it's a very esoteric reference unless you've studied philosophy. Same with ""Cura Te Ipsum""- chances are, unless you are studying medicine (or, like me, just like learning random things), this wouldn't feel like a ""direct"" reference at all.

While Seasons 1-3 and the first half of Season 4 was some of the most amazing TV I've ever watched, the 2nd half of Season 4 had pretty awful writing for a show of this caliber, proving that POI is now a shell of it's former self."
PersonOfInterest,38pogt,Palatura,11,Sat Jun 6 04:01:27 2015 UTC,"Um, no. The article very clearly states that while Denise is now an executive producer, Jonah and Greg are still the showrunners. Greg was at the ATX panel, and he also gave a lengthy interview with Marisa Roffman on his thoughts on the season 4 finale and the events of season 5. He said that immediately after season 4 ended, he, Jonah and the other writers discussed what season 5 should be like. In another interview, Jonah said that he's ""going to keep telling this fucking story"". It's obvious that the Jonah and Greg are passionate about the show. The only problem is CBS, which doesn't own POI and also hates that this show is no longer mostly a procedural. CBS didn't even want the writers to go in depth about where Finch and Reese were getting their intel from. POI without the Machine...would not be POI.   Season 4 did lose some momentum after MIA; however, keep in mind that the writers had to rewrite an awful lot to accommodate for Sarah Shahi's absence. Overall the season was really good, imo. POI just hit the peak of its creativity with experimental episodes like ""If-Then-Else"", ""Control-Alt-Delete"" and ""Terra Incognita"". And episodes like ""The Cold War"", ""Asylum"" and ""YHWH"" showed that there's so much to explore with regards to the two machines' approaches to making the world better."

PersonOfInterest,38pjbu,eikeegimuu,3,Fri Jun 5 20:08:03 2015 UTC,"It's rather noticeable that (I guess) they didn't say anything about the number of episodes for season 5 nor whether season 5 will be the last one. That's really not encouraging.  I'd think that if they were pushing for continuing somewhere else Plageman would have restated that they are looking for ways to keep telling the story etc. That makes me a bit worried that while the number of episodes in not set in stone (which is good since it's got to be more not less than 13 if that's the case), they might be willing to accept that as the final season. And even if they'd get a couple of episodes more than 13, that's still far from optimal.  I wouldn’t want the S5 to end with a cliffhanger and an uncertain future but I'd happy to have placeholder ending that works on its own but can then be used as a starting off point for S6."
PersonOfInterest,38pjbu,eikeegimuu,3,Fri Jun 5 19:52:52 2015 UTC,"I just found a tweet from someone who was there that indicated that if need be, Jonah and Greg will expedite the show to give it a proper end, but they're hoping for more. They're content enough that CBS allows their show to air.   Greg also said that they write every season finale kind of as though it could function as a series finale (well, that was the case for the season 3 finale anyway), but this time, they're really going to ""go for it"". So, I take that to mean that this finale will be conclusive enough to work as a series end, but still loose enough that if they get the chance to continue the story, they can do so. Honestly, I have no idea how they'll write this episode, but I trust them.   There's a new article that states that Denise has been promoted to executive producer. That article goes on to say that the 13-episode order still hasn't been confirmed. I think the writers do know how many episodes they're getting, but after having talked with some friends on Twitter, I found out that they probably can't say these things. The episode order will likely have to be announced in a press release from CBS first."
PersonOfInterest,38pjbu,UltraChip,2,Fri Jun 5 20:15:38 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I wonder how the loose enough ending goes with Nolan and Plageman saying that they know the ending of the show down to the final scene/song. And with what they've said about everyone's survival prospects. They might have been trolling but somehow I didn't think so, now there are more main characters to kill off, so maybe they'll go with 50-50.   I would also assume that the writers would have to know from their S5 meeting the number of the episodes and indeed knowing also whether this will be the final season would be useful (to say the least). Though I don't know why the holdup with disclosing that info. Maybe there's still small/minuscule chance for more than POI could get."

You seemed to not understand that since it is not for a full season's worth of episodes and a late premiere, it isn't the same as a renewal for a full season starting in September and thus the lack of reruns will affect viewership when season five finally starts. Unless you are new to the show and discussions on this sub reddit, surely you are aware that the type of renewal the show got from the network is nothing to be thrilled about."

I'm fairly new to this show (I started watching in January and got caught up in two weeks), so I've never done a POI summer marathon before. My rewatch schedule will be pretty similar to yours: I'll start in June and watch an episode a day until I start my Master's in September. Maybe I can get my parents into the show as well. I'm certain it's something they'd like.   I've noticed that there are barely any episode discussions from season 1 and about half from season 2. Maybe as redditors do a rewatch, we could have discussions for those episodes? I think it would really interesting to look back and see how those early events shaped the show into what it is now.

PersonOfInterest,37r812,fourthords,4,Fri May 29 19:14:09 2015 UTC,Although I loved getting both DVD and blu ray formats I was wondering when they would stop that. Seems kind of redundant and odd they kept doing that but I think a lot of  WB shows were doing that for awhile. I very rarely used the DVD at all unless letting someone borrow it. Having the digital Ultraviolet is key for me because I use that the most.   If you noticed that after a certain period stores only carry the blu ray (non dvd included) versions. Not just for POI but for other shows that had both included.  All my local best buys and walmarts have just the blu Ray disc versions now and some vendors online only carry or have low stock of the dvd/blu Ray combos.   Wonder if other WB owned shoes like the Arrow that had both will not come in both formats anymore that used to. Seems like they did it as a courtesy to early adopters of blu Ray players / computer users that maybe didnt/don't have a blu Ray player for mobile traveling? But that is what I use the digital UV copy for also.    EDIT: seems Arrow Season 3 is also not having the DVDs which makes sense since it's a WB owned show also and they Magen doing it across the board. http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00T5D4OSW/ref=tmm_blu_title_0?ie=UTF8&sr=8-2&qid=1432996660
PersonOfInterest,37r812,whitewater2,2,Sat May 30 08:12:04 2015 UTC,I'd call it more to save money then a cash grab. Saving it on a  format most people don't use anymore or will care about. Some company's include a digital version along with the bluray that would be a lot more useful to some.
PersonOfInterest,37r812,Yage2006,1 point,Fri May 29 21:03:50 2015 UTC,"There is a digital version being included (at least if the box art is to be believed), but I don't buy the ""format most people don't use anymore or care about"" argument when they're releasing a separate DVD set of the fourth season too."
PersonOfInterest,37r812,Yage2006,2,Fri May 29 22:45:37 2015 UTC,Then you can give the digital version to your friend.  I bet they did that in the first place thinking that if we put them both in the same box then people who own whichever format can purchase it and we don't need 2 versions. Probably  realizing later that having 2 versions like most shows do is more economic since DVD is a dieing format.
PersonOfInterest,37r812,whitewater2,2,Fri May 29 23:18:06 2015 UTC,"I take it as ""your buying the blue ray version what do you need the dvd version for ?""

But no idea on whose part – CBS doesn't benefit from syndication, so I'd think they aren't part of other “after original airing” dollars either.  Aaaaand - OT, but I wish they'd picked different cover art. It has been around for a while, so I should have been prepared, but I don't like it at all. Meaning I don't like at all how the characters have been drawn.  Shaw and Reese look somewhat acceptable (droopy eye syndrome notwithstanding – that is here exhibited by them all). Fusco isn't that bad either though he looks a bit like a sad St. Bernard. But Harold looks like a dearanged orphan from a horror movie and Root I reqocnized only from her jacket (and because who else could the 5th person be) - otherwise I would have assumed it's a not very good rendering of Susan Sarandon.  So the rain effect is neat, but otherwise it's a big fail. Even if some distortion is deliberate, the end result should still look presentable, instead it looks like the background was done with care but the characters were done with 5 minutes. So I like the idea – the raindrops form a thousand eyes (if that was the intention), but that is ruined by half the chracters looking somewhere between creepy and unreqoqnizable.  I saw a photo somewhere that they had that thing up as a huge print somehere above the studio entrance or other such building – so maybe if it's viewd from a below angle it makes more sense and was planned to be viewed like that, but then somebody decided they liked it so much that it should be used everywhere."
PersonOfInterest,37p31j,charlesf97,19,Fri May 29 07:49:42 2015 UTC,"Fringe. It began with a typical case of the week then it gets more centralized around a plot and there are ""organizations"" fighting each other. Lots of sci fi stuff also. And some great characters with great chemistry."

PersonOfInterest,37p31j,moishew,13,Fri May 29 20:16:48 2015 UTC,"In terms of ""team of experts swoop in to help people in trouble"", I enjoyed Leverage, which ran for five seasons on TNT. It's lighter in tone and obviously had a smaller budget, but I think it was a fun show more in a con/heist mode than the thriller/action mode of Person of Interest.  On the other hand, if you liked Dexter, you may enjoy Hannibal, which is a lot more psychological and operatic but has a similarity in that it focuses on serial killers and the audience knows Hannibal Lecter is a monster when no-one in the cast does, as with Dexter Morgan, though Lecter isn't the protagonist."

Either way he uses others to manipulate situations i.e. Ethan, Shaw, Reese, Sayyid, Michael. Also, both characters react quickly and decisively. The only huge thing that varies is the moral compass. Ben is a liar, murderer, and a thief and Harold is altruistic, trustworthy, and law-abiding (as much as he can afford to be) like you said.."

POI decisively won in five categories- the five that it was eligible for- on SpoilerTV. These were: Favourite Network Drama, Favourite Sci-Fi/Fantasy Drama, Favourite Crime Drama, Favourite Drama Actor (Michael Emerson), and Favourite Drama Actress (Amy Acker). I know these polls don't really mean much, but it's nice to see so many ardent fans supporting this show.   Summary of relevant results:   Favourite Network Drama  POI - 44%  Arrow - 16%  Castle - 14%   The 100 - 6%   Once Upon a Time (OUAT)- 5%  The Flash - 4%   How To Get Away With Murder (HTGAWM)- 3%   Grey's Anatomy - 3%   Scandal - 2%   Favourite Sci-Fi/Fantasy Drama:  POI - 37%   Outlander - 18%   The 100 - 17%  Arrow - 11%   OUAT - 4%   The Flash - 4%   Agents of SHIELD - 4%  Game of Thrones - 3%  Orphan Black - 2%   Favourite Crime Drama  POI - 44%   Castle - 21%   The Blacklist - 10%  Bones - 7%   Criminal Minds - 5%  NCIS - 5%  Chicago PD - 5%  NCIS: LA - 3%  Favourite Drama Actor  Michael Emerson (POI) - 37%  Stephen Arnell (Arrow) - 20%  Sam Heughan (Outlander) - 20%  Nathan Fillion (Castle) - 17%  Grant Gustin (The Flash) - 5%   Tobias Menzies (Outlander) - 2%  Favourite Drama Actress  Amy Acker (POI) - 51%  Emily Bett Rickards (Arrow) - 17%   Stana Katic (Castle) - 16%  Catriona Balfe (Outlander) - 10%   Tatiana Maslany (Orphan Black) - 4%  Viola Davis (HTGAWM) - 2%   Way to go, POI."

I mean that's what am actor is, someone that plays different characters throughout most their careers, but to play multiple characters in the same show who often interact with each other, that is something different entirely.

PersonOfInterest,37jjmf,igorwithlicor,15,Thu May 28 02:16:48 2015 UTC,"It wasn't Brooks who was killed; it was Schiffman, Control's assistant. (She was such a minor character that it's totally understandable that you forgot her.)   To answer your question, yes, many fans did notice the Shaw-like jacket and the gloved womanly hands. The fact that the assassin used a needle was also reminiscent of the several times that Shaw killed/knocked out people via injections. So some people do speculate that Shaw was Schiffman's killer.   I do think this is a very possible scenario. However, this theory raises two questions for me:    If Shaw were an assassin involved in the Correction, then why did the Machine mark her with a yellow reticle and continue to identify her as a primary asset rather than use a red reticle and mark her as a threat? Would Shaw really have been fit enough to go around assassinating people? She looked really out of it in ""Asylum""-- she couldn't even walk straight.    I hope we find out what happened to her in season 5. I admit that I am still deeply concerned that her arc will suffer because Sarah Shahi may not be available.   Edited for spelling."
PersonOfInterest,37jjmf,ariyahvansh,3,Thu May 28 02:31:25 2015 UTC,"Damn, I totally thought it was Schiffman! I'm terrible with remembering minor characters.  Ah cool! I've been looking for topics on that and I haven't seen anything yet. Maybe I just missed them.  I'm worried that if Sara Shahi can't be around for a few episodes at least the arc of what-the-hell-happened to Shaw is gonna be basically dropped, or another character is gonna be used for that."
PersonOfInterest,37jjmf,ariyahvansh,4,Thu May 28 02:46:21 2015 UTC,"Oh it's not a problem. There are so many minor/guest characters that it can be hard for anyone to keep track of them. A lot of viewers here forgot about Caleb Phipps, the number from 2-Pi-r, for instance.   The thread on Shaw as the assassin came up shortly after YHWH aired, so it's been long buried by now. There was some discussion about this theory on Tumblr as well (I don't know if you have an account?).   Please Caviezus, bring Sarah Shahi back ASAP for season 5. Please.   On a different note, welcome to the show and to the POI fandom. I just realized that you said in your original post that you're new."

Yeah, I have a tumblr account, but I'm there more for the gifsets than the discussion, but maybe next time there's a new episode I'll be more into the discussion. Actually, I'll just use reddit for that.  And thank you!"
PersonOfInterest,37jjmf,SamaritanGreer,3,Thu May 28 03:55:07 2015 UTC,My wild guess (if it's not Shaw which seems unlikely given the extent of her injuries) is that it's Iris.  Something is off about her.

PersonOfInterest,3788fk,ariyahvansh,10,Mon May 25 18:04:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm happy with a shorter season. Now that the mystery is mostly gone and we know the characters backstories, I enjoy less and less the ""filler"" episodes that doesn't advance the main plot. Having a short season means there will be more episodes that deal with Samaritan and the machine, and less procedural stories. I think they jumped the shark with the airplane episode, and generally the show feels dumber since season 4, so I hope Nolan gets back to the wheel and we will have an awesome end to the story."
PersonOfInterest,3788fk,gd42,2,Tue May 26 02:48:28 2015 UTC,"I agree that a shortened season would lead to tighter writing. Season 4 could have benefited from this; it had quite a few momentum killers. Now, in season 5, they could go full-on AI, and we could very well witness the most glorious, well-written episodes ever to air. My concern is that the writers might have to rush things if they only get 13 episodes to finish off the series. For this reason, I'm requesting that CBS give POI 16 or 17 episodes to wrap up instead of 13. (Ideally, I would want one more shortened season-- hell, I want #6SeasonsAndAMovie-- but I sincerely doubt we're going to get it. A fifth season with 16-17 final episodes is the minimum that I'd contentedly settle for.)"
PersonOfInterest,3788fk,84981725891758912576,5,Tue May 26 04:14:35 2015 UTC,"I just hope it doesn't get the Mentalist treatment for the past few seasons. CBS forced them to end the main arc, while answering pretty much zero questions, leading to a final, shortened season, that was all procedural. They essentially brutally murdered the show."
PersonOfInterest,3788fk,SavannahNix,3,Tue May 26 08:35:56 2015 UTC,"And like POI, The Mentalist was owned by Warner Brother's. I sense a pattern."
PersonOfInterest,3788fk,FancyPansy,8,Tue May 26 19:06:28 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure the writers are happy with 13 episodes, so I am as well."
PersonOfInterest,3788fk,zophan,10,Mon May 25 22:27:12 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't the 13-episode season, really; rather it's the distinct possibility that these are the final episodes. Although Jonah and Greg have said that they prefer shorter seasons, the fact that POI is getting a half-season and has been deemed a midseason replacement strongly suggests that this is the end of the show. Nina Tassler has said that they are having talks about cancellation after season 5. I do not think Jonah and Greg were expecting this at all, and as they have the story mapped out for six seasons, it would be a huge challenge for them to end things off in 13.   We can't get a full season at this point, and it's not that likely that the show will find a new home for a sixth season, shortened or otherwise. So, I would settle for a 16 or 17-episode final fifth season to wrap things up. It would still be a challenge for the writers, but they'd at least have a little more time to build up to a satisfying conclusion for the show. This might also enable them to properly reintegrate Shaw into the story (like, Shahi could hopefully be available from episode 12 onward) and explore what happened to her."
PersonOfInterest,3788fk,DesertedPenguin,5,Mon May 25 22:46:30 2015 UTC,"If it's midseason, isn't that better for Sarah Shahi? Filming later means she misses less?"
PersonOfInterest,3788fk,SavannahNix,10,Tue May 26 00:55:10 2015 UTC,"They will film their normal schedule. The episodes will just be held until midseason.  That way, if something happens to CBS' schedule where they need to bump up Person of Interest's premiere, they can do so without being worried that other episodes aren't finished."
PersonOfInterest,3788fk,kgyre,2,Tue May 26 01:30:53 2015 UTC,"Hmm, but isn't it a midseason replacement? I'm pretty sure that it is, so they actually have to be ready by the fall in case a new show tanks. Therefore, they'll most likely begin filming in July as usual. However, there might be a chance that they could delay production a bit. (Can someone ask Greg about this during the ATX panel on June 5th?) I hope Shahi is ready to return to work soon though. Like...really soon."
PersonOfInterest,3788fk,eikeegimuu,2,Tue May 26 01:05:08 2015 UTC,"What makes you know how the writers feel about it or that they would be happy with only getting 13 more episodes? I have been following this very closely, and I haven't seen a thing indicating they said, ""oh, good, we're tired of writing this show and we are happy we will only have to produce 13 more and then say good-bye to it forever."" So, where are you getting this information you are pretty sure about?"
PersonOfInterest,3788fk,SavannahNix,4,Tue May 26 02:08:00 2015 UTC,"http://www.givememyremote.com/remote/2014/02/04/person-of-interest-jonathan-nolan-and-greg-plageman-tease-an-all-flashback-episode-expanding-the-series-why-theyre-not-interested-in-airing-200-episodes-and-whats-to-come/ :  ""Broadcast television used to be fairly strict with its 22 (or more) episode season requirements for shows, but the LOST bosses famously were able to negotiate an advance end date and shorter seasons. Is that something you hope to be able to do for your show?""  Greg Plageman: We keep trying. It never works. [Laughs]  Jonathan Nolan: It’s an ongoing conversation for us every year. Second season we made 22, because that was what we thought we were capable of doing. This season we found a way — it’s a glorious problem to have when the network and the audience wants more of what you’re making. It’s a great problem, but it’s a problem nonetheless."
PersonOfInterest,3788fk,eikeegimuu,8,Tue May 26 03:53:12 2015 UTC,"You stopped quoting too soon:  JN: “And to safeguard the production value and our own sanity, we can’t do 24. We can’t often do 23. 22 is a reasonably good number, where you’re unlikely to have episodes that are dog shit. But the nice thing about the blended approach of having a procedural in a serialized story is you don’t have to burn through story for the stake of it”.  That's the scale he is talking about. That 24 is too much and 23 is difficult but 22 is pretty reasonable. A couple of episodes more or less. Now going from 22 which Nolan said here is reasonable down to 13 is a huge cut. With that few episodes they are going to have to not only “burn through story” but they will not have enough space to do so in style."
PersonOfInterest,3788fk,SavannahNix,3,Tue May 26 06:01:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you. That quote doesn't say, ""we would be happy with only 13."""
PersonOfInterest,3788fk,SavannahNix,2,Tue May 26 19:04:20 2015 UTC,"Yes, not to mention that had the 13 eps been a choice they would not have hesitated to announce it as a coup. Instead POI has been silent and everything indicates that CBS is done with the show."
PersonOfInterest,3788fk,f266101463,2,Fri May 29 21:49:03 2015 UTC,So true.
PersonOfInterest,3788fk,soren121,3,Fri May 29 22:12:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, I am aware of that interview. Did you understand what I was asking? I'll try again.  I don't see where it says they would be perfectly happy to ONLY have 13 more, period. Plus, this interview was from third season, so we have no way of knowing if they still feel that way. There is a big difference between saying writing  fewer than 22 episodes would be okay, less difficult, cool etc. and finding out you are on the brink of cancellation and have to tell 44 episodes worth of their story, assuming it lasted for a fifth and sixth seasons which we know they planned on, in 13 episodes, or if they seriously wanted shorter seasons, had 26 episodes of story to squeeze into 13. And even if they wanted shorter seasons, they aren't saying the ideal amount of the supposed shorter season would be as low as 13. (And 13 has not yet been confirmed.)   They were not expecting this, they were assuming they would be renewed, and by that I mean, renewed for a full season which would mean a chance for a sixth season, not renewed but in the next breath told instead that instead it was a mercy renewal for a much shorter season, a late start after something else gets cancelled and the near certainty that an order for 13 eps and a late start means this would be the last season.  Plus, Lost was a network darling, whereas POI is treated like a barely tolerated step child. I would say that considering what happened in regard to season 5, that they wish they had never said they would like to have shorter seasons, cause, you know, that kind of puts  that comment in the ""be careful what you wish for"" category. It's like CBS saying, ""you want shorter seasons? Fine. But make that season, singular.""  So the quote does not answer the question I asked of FancyPansy."
PersonOfInterest,3788fk,thedarklit,2,Tue May 26 05:48:01 2015 UTC,"White Collar had a short last season, with no filler episodes, and I think most of the fans enjoyed it. Let's hope POI ends great."
PersonOfInterest,3788fk,SavannahNix,3,Tue May 26 04:18:53 2015 UTC,"White Collar wasn't serialized, though. The seasons are largely self-contained, so it was easy for them to make season 6 ""one last case"". All they really needed to deliver on was closure for the characters."
PersonOfInterest,3788fk,SavannahNix,2,Tue May 26 10:07:25 2015 UTC,"I would rather 13 episodes part of the main story arc, than 13 episodes of main story arc mixed in with 9 single arc episodes."
PersonOfInterest,3788fk,SavannahNix,3,Tue May 26 11:34:57 2015 UTC,"Again, I'm not asking for a full season. I'm asking for 3 or 4 more episodes so that the writers can end off the main arc and the show altogether more smoothly, instead of having to rush things."
PersonOfInterest,3788fk,KotoElessar,-1,Tue May 26 14:41:02 2015 UTC,You want less than the 13 and you think that will end things smoothly? Really?  Why anyone who enjoys and considers themselves afa of the show would hope for fewer episodes and cancellation is beyond me.
PersonOfInterest,3788fk,SavannahNix,3,Tue May 26 19:08:59 2015 UTC,"Um, no, you completely misunderstood me. As I said multiple times on this thread, I want 16 or 17 episodes in season 5 at the very least. That's 3-4 more episodes than the 13 that we are supposedly getting."

PersonOfInterest,375mys,GunzComeOut13,3,Mon May 25 17:45:20 2015 UTC,"Again, total viewers doesn't really matter. The demo does (18-49), and POI isn't in the Top 30 there."

It's 22nd overall but 10th on CBS, not including non fiction programming (reality, news, sports). Law and Order: SVU on the other hand is 50th overall, but 4th among NBC fiction programming."
PersonOfInterest,375mys,draxxis,2,Mon May 25 20:20:23 2015 UTC,I thought last season CBS gave them more episodes than they wanted? Are we getting shortchanged next season?
PersonOfInterest,375mys,Narath,3,Mon May 25 06:45:36 2015 UTC,"The usual number of episodes for a network tv show is 22 or 23. Yes, if the order is for only 13, we are definitely getting shortchanged next season. It isn't that the network gave the producers ""more than they wanted"" -- they once, in an interview, expressed that doing over 22 (even 23 or 24) was difficult. They would have liked to perhaps do around 20. They never indicated they wished for the very short seasons that shows on cable or streaming services get. Thirteen episodes is a renewal only in the sense that they weren't completely cancelled. It is a message that CBS doesn't want the show in its fall lineup, that they have ordered a short season to be aired only when another show tanks. It is slightly better than outright cancellation, but not much."

PersonOfInterest,375mys,Narath,5,Thu May 28 01:01:53 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but Once Upon a Time is in here too and that needs to be cancelled. I'd rather them give us a season to wrap things up then drag it on longer than they have good story."

PersonOfInterest,375mys,TheFourthSnake,2,Mon May 25 15:54:51 2015 UTC,"But the 100, arrow and flash are all way more entertaining than all those ncis and csi clones... They also have the vampire diaries plus spinoff and supernatural which are also really popular. So strange :p"
PersonOfInterest,375mys,jor1ss,3,Mon May 25 16:08:10 2015 UTC,"Oh yea for sure, I love The CW's line-up! I'd much rather watch any of those shows than 90% of the stuff that networks like CBS put out. The lower expectations of The CW means they can allow a show that time it needs to tell the story it wants to tell. Networks like CBS lean further towards procedural shows, which is another reason why the increasingly serialised nature of POI makes it a bad fit for CBS."
PersonOfInterest,375mys,TheFourthSnake,1 point,Mon May 25 16:19:47 2015 UTC,"Meh, give us one more season rather. I'm okay with shorter seasons, since that seems to be what the creators want anyways."

I think TV executives have already been pretty clear about the fact that they care far more about the 18-49 demo than they do about total viewers.

PersonOfInterest,372jjm,baultista,10,Thu May 28 19:53:49 2015 UTC,"People like them because they're easy, formulaic, and predictable.  With most episodes being self-contained they take very little commitment if you're the kind of person that's going to miss a few weeks at a time.  They don't rock the boat or deviate from a tried and proven formula, and can really do no wrong with their core audience.  You know exactly what you're getting when you're sitting down and watching an episode for an hour, and that's comforting.  If you can figure out what's going to happen in the episode, you feel smart and accomplished because hey, you saw it coming.  If you can't figure out what's going to happen in the episode then hey, great, the writers threw a twist at you that surprised you!  Either way, you get off the couch after that hour is done and you feel entertained as you get back to your life.  Remember the roots of POI.  This was a procedural show that posed a simple question: is this week's subject the victim or the perpetrator? It was all about figuring it out and saving the day, either by saving the victim or busting the perpetrator.  The machine was just a mysterious black box -- little more than a tool to help Reese and Finch.  Episodes were self-contained, with slight tastes and teases at the show becoming something more.    Some clung to that simple tried-and-true formula, while others became attached to the idea that the show could evolve. We saw two incredibly complex and rich characters in John Reese and Harold Finch, both brilliantly portrayed by Jim Caviezel and Michael Emerson, respectively. We saw a rich tapestry of elements creating tension against each other between petty crimes, gang wars, acts of terror, government agencies, and larger philosophical issues around sentient machines, all at a time when stories about the NSA were coming out into the news.  I remember in those early years thinking to myself after an episode ""Oh wow that was cool, but I really want to see another backstory or Machine-focused episode!"", or after seeing a news article thinking to myself ""They just did that exact thing on POI two weeks ago!""  To the benefit of people like us, the show evolved.  We got to see the bigger picture and learn more about the Machine.  The show started to distance itself from its roots as a crime drama and started looking at some of those bigger-picture ideas.  The dynamic duo of Reese and Finch became Team Machine.  Backstories became detailed and fleshed out for each character, and the show itself started moving towards some very intriguing concept episodes like the simulation episode, John's near-death episode, the small-town lab experiment episode, etc.  It became apparent that the show was moving away from providing easy-to-digest, self-contained formulaic entertainment and more towards telling a phenomenal story through a multitude of means, and in doing so it quickly became the boldest, most unique, and in my controversial opinion the absolute best show on television.  To the show's discredit though, it's become very inaccessible.  To watch this show you'd need to start from the absolute beginning.  You'd need to pay very close attention and be ready for the callbacks to previous episodes and the show's exploration of events across a large timeline.  As a die-hard fan who literally watches nothing but POI in terms of non-comedy television shows even I have difficulty linking some of the pieces together.  It's become very high-concept and convoluted.  Simply watching it takes a lot of energy and thought (not the best show for a LATE NIGHT TIMESLOT but that's another story) and because of that it's turned off a lot of those people who want a comforting procedural drama."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,avengingturnip,4,Sun May 24 16:34:55 2015 UTC,"There was nothing easy, formulaic, or predictable about the first two seasons of POI.  It was an entirely new kind of drama exploring themes that had never been presented on TV before.  It was fresh, different, and new."

PersonOfInterest,372jjm,avengingturnip,5,Sun May 24 15:38:12 2015 UTC,"It's hard to say.  In the early seasons they were almost always laying down the framework for something bigger, but you never knew if it was them ending on a cliffhanger and leaving things open-ended or them actually building to something larger. I think some of us were intrigued by the more high-concept ideas the show had to offer, while others were drawn to it being a fresh twist on a cop procedural.  I'm honestly not a big TV watcher, and had someone not incessantly recommended Person of Interest to me after the first season I would have dismissed it as one of those ""CSI-type shows"" (procedural drama) and never watched it.  In fact the only reason I did bother watching it was because of Michael Emerson and the whole concept of a super-intelligent AI (huge tech nerd here).  What I found, at least at first, was a procedural drama with a little twist in that you never knew if the dynamic duo was trying to save an innocent person or bust a criminal... but there was always that tease of much more under the surface.  The show could have just as easily not pulled back the covers and stuck to the script, though being a WB show aired on CBS I suspect that it would have suffered the same fate it is now while simultaneously being far less entertaining."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,SavannahNix,2,Sun May 24 16:40:53 2015 UTC,It was a show about ubiquitous surveillance and two men each seeking their own redemption for the choices they had made. How can people claim it was a cop show when the main characters were not even cops?  It was more of a cop show last season than in any other with Reese pretending to be a detective.

Or rather – I like the characters (or I wouldn't watch the show in the first place) but at the same time I don't want to see any contrived drama. Hints of personal lives are of course ok and welcome if it's not center-stage and intruding on the case of the week. The funny thing is that most procedurals that I've watched at some point (well, actually when they don't manage good standalone stories anymore) turn to such contrived drama. The case of the week is different (except for that one very personal adversary – like when somebody is searching for their mother's killer etc), but the lead characters work very hard at dealing with things on a personal level or – gasp – one of the team gets kidnapped and it's again all very personal and so on.  Anyway, I actually like the procedural format and if anything my problem with them is that after the first season(s) they don't reset enough."

I was referring to my general experiences with procedurals, namely that after the first seasons they tend to run out of steam and the cases are not interesting anymore so instead the character's personal lives get very “interesting” while often intersecting with the case of week in a “teachable moment”.  I'm aware that there's no resetting like I guess ages ago when the lead character would fall in love, be engaged and tragically loose their bride/groom at the altar by the end of the same episode and thus be again an eligible bachelor(ette) by the start of the next episode (I watched a lot of old tv shows a kid :)). Now some background and continuation is pretty much obligatory even in procedurals. That background is not a problem, but it turns into a problem when the show starts to build the drama around that instead having interesting cases.  Thing is that I like procedurals as a format, but they tend to be good for only maybe two seasons. POI has avoided that curse in part because it's not a procedural anymore."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,avengingturnip,6,Sun May 24 18:12:41 2015 UTC,I wouldnt care what facebook users have to say if I were you. CBS viewers typically suck ass.
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,myst536,5,Sun May 24 17:14:40 2015 UTC,YUP. I took a quick look at the POI Facebook page a few weeks ago and vowed never to make that mistake again.
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,SavannahNix,-19,Sun May 24 17:55:50 2015 UTC,"Creative complicated story?   Root:  Harold, you don't care about Shaw!  Harold:  I do too Ms. Groves!  Root:  No you don't!  Your loins don't ache for her!  Harold:  Well, that is true.   Repeat over and over again.  The show is not nearly as creative or complex as it used to be."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,ItsLikeRay-ee-ain,12,Sun May 24 12:36:57 2015 UTC,"No idea. I do not know how CBS think, however the show has decreased in ratings from season 1 to now. Losing millions of viewers, and that in the demo that matters the most for network TV. It still has a strong following, and many show can just dream of having the rating POI still have after 4 seasons. So why CBS orders only half a season is very strange indeed.   However, the AI story has a lifespan - in contrast to where POI started with the case of the week-format that could go on forever.  When the AI story is concluded, POI is as well."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,SavannahNix,5,Sun May 24 08:32:10 2015 UTC,"The issue is that the show is not owned by CBS, but by Warner Brothers. Thus, CBS can't make the money from it that it can from other shows, nor does it care about it as much. Haven't you noticed it has hardly been promoted by the network all this time?  Not only that, but the AI story has been there since day one. I see no reason for them to stop having that as part of the show."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,hak_i,1 point,Sun May 24 15:35:30 2015 UTC,I'm guessing by AI story they mean Samaritan story? And that they believe there is no return from that because their adversary is too big and grand it is hard to come back from?
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,shitezlozen,2,Sun May 24 16:32:22 2015 UTC,"I suppose they might mean Samaritan, yes. But I don't think the show would necessarily have nothing to say if Samaritan is defeated. There could be plenty of stories to tell about the repercussions of Samaritan's attempts to control the world, etc. unless people think big bad Samaritan will win and kill the team...?"
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,dl2316,12,Thu May 28 03:43:15 2015 UTC,This is a show which is not owned by cbs but by WB. That is the reason this show gets a step motherly treatment when shows which have much worse viewer ratings get renewals
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,hak_i,1 point,Sun May 24 09:46:28 2015 UTC,can you explain this in better detail?
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,Sabeckaz,3,Mon May 25 01:12:31 2015 UTC,"CBS only gets advertisement money (commercials) from POI while Warner Bros get the rest of the money and CBS has less input into the show. A show like CSI: Cyber is owned by CBS, so they get all the money and make all of the decisions."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,duniyadnd,2,Mon May 25 02:08:28 2015 UTC,"CBS doesn't make any money off POI. The only money it will get through POI is through ad money. With the season finale showing very poor numbers, the revenue from ads decrease and hence they see POI as dispensable as compared to a procedural which attracts more number of viewers consistently."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,Sabeckaz,4,Mon May 25 13:14:05 2015 UTC,"POI is owned by WB, WB gets POI's syndication money not CBS so although this shows ratings are higher than 50% of the other shows ratings on the network CBS will show preference to their own lower rated shows because they get their syndication money."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,rob1005,3,Sun May 24 09:49:52 2015 UTC,How come it doesn't run WB channel?
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,SavannahNix,3,Sun May 24 09:54:19 2015 UTC,WB (i.e. CW) might not have picked it up for themselves because it doesn't meet their demographic needs.
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,ghostoblivionII,2,Sun May 24 12:29:10 2015 UTC,Yeah like someone else mentioned all The CW shows are very kiddy/teen related shows whereas POI is an adult show so it's more suited towards CBS.
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,eikeegimuu,4,Sun May 24 15:20:59 2015 UTC,"It is, but many feel it has perhaps run its course and deserves another season to tie things up rather than just getting cancelled."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,ghostoblivionII,5,Sun May 24 08:19:25 2015 UTC,"Not everyone thinks it has ""run it's course"". It was renewed, then hours later, CBS yanked the rug out from under us, and the producers, but reducing the number of episodes and giving the show a late start.  It deserves at least another full season, if not two, not just to tie things up, but to fully play out all the stories."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,eikeegimuu,5,Sun May 24 15:33:34 2015 UTC,I think I'd welcome a short season. I think Season 4 had way too much padding.
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,ghostoblivionII,7,Sun May 24 09:17:30 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't the shorter season, but the very big likelihood that it'll be the final season."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,eikeegimuu,3,Sun May 24 18:05:47 2015 UTC,I'm not sure that's a problem as long as the big arc is dealt with.
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,ghostoblivionII,2,Sun May 24 21:48:27 2015 UTC,"You mean you are cool with the show ending? I’m not, but with 22 episodes I could at least see them tying things up in a satisfactory manner. With 13 episodes that’s pretty much impossible."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,eikeegimuu,1 point,Mon May 25 09:18:30 2015 UTC,"Yes. I'm fine with it ending before the storylines start getting sour. A great ending makes for brilliant TV.  13 excellent episodes will do the job nicely. If they can't pull that out of their hat then there really shouldn't be a fifth season at all.  As I'm writing, I've just noticed something. As you know, since Shaw was abducted, we've had several bigger, badder, more kickass ladies every couple of episodes, as if the writers are testing out for replacements. It has been dull. They should have either killed Shaw or recast her."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,chiggles,3,Mon May 25 20:10:33 2015 UTC,"I think 13 episodes is nowhere enough to wrap things up. They would either have to rush and/or make time jumps. Even a 22 episodes final season would mean many missed opportunities, but then I could see that they can wrap it up if they don't have any standalones – without standalones they could probably do a decent job with maybe even with 18 or so episodes.  Agree about the auditioning part, completely unnecessary. Though killing or recasting Shaw wasn't needed either. Simply more screen time for other characters would have been the best way to deal with her absence or maybe have better standalones instead giving the writers the specs of having a savvy chick kicking ass episode (which is not a satisfactory replacement for having a good story)."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,Trueogre,0,Tue May 26 05:45:54 2015 UTC,"I think we'll be left disagreeing, here. Perhaps we see the complexity differently? I don't see a Wire-level of epic breadth and depth in POI. It's not The Shield, or Breaking Bad or The Sopranos. I think POI is a great adventure story, highly inventive, often apt and satirical -- but I don't think there's great depth to the characters and their plotlines those other series have.  I don't think there's no depth to the characters. They are moving, quirky and touching -- kind of like (much) more rounded versions of what Joss Whedon was doing 15 years ago. However, I get no sense that what the POI story is about is the characters themselves; it's more about the (Samaritan) situation and the (abstract) issues of the value of human life, freedom, watchfulness and control. In that sense, POI isn't a very complicated story.    Simply more screen time for other characters would have been the best way to deal with her absence   I agree. I'd go further, too, and say that this is something that exposes the superficial nature of some aspects of the writing. Shaw leaves -- and then we have the next 3 episodes all about OMG SHAW'S GONE!, and there is a great wailing and gnashing of teeth and nothing comes of it. Then, the Machine tells Root to stop searching, we pause for a couple of filler episodes, and then the search starts up again for the finale.  That's not to say it's bad; it's not. It's fun! But this kind of plot work does leave me with the feeling of being churned through a gearbox. It's very digital, very abrupt, as if you can hear the Writers' Meeting in the background (""Hey everyone! Let's have an episode about THIS!"") rather than dealing with the more complex business of having the next episode emerge from the humans we left behind at the end of the last one.  I think over this season the writers' agenda has changed. The early seasons were much more character-focused. The later seasons are more driven by the Samaritan plot, and it looks like meticulous character examination has gone out of the window. And, that's fine, overall, I think, because it's still fun. But I really can't see it needing 22 episodes to tie up the large-scale plot (which has now been dragged out for how long? Two years??).  Also the Root character has become boring (for me). She just feels like a rehash of an amalgam of Faith/Buffy/Fred characteristics these days. (Oh, she's a hacker. Okay. And, she's a killer! Okay. And, she gets to dress up in amusing costumes because the Machine tells her to! Okay. It's really funny! If you say so. And she's nuts! Okay. And she's gay! Okay. And she kicks ass! Okay, already. And she has crazy eyes! Yes, yes, I get it. I get that this character will never pose or face a serious challenge which actually has consequences for her.)"
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,ariyahvansh,3,Fri May 29 12:22:11 2015 UTC,"Indeed we can agree on disagreeing. I think you writing that the Samaritan plot “dragged out for how long? Two years??” indicates quite well your (dis)interest and why you feel that it can be done with 13 episodes.  If the way you see it is that the story is not about the characters (and they are just endearing figures to advance the Samaritan plot) then I can believe that you see no problem in wrapping things up in 13 episodes – and if 13 episodes really is all we are going to get that's probably what will happen.   But I'll just point out that really there was only one OMG Shaw is gone episode. Shaw was gunned down end of E11. E12 was mostly about Control and the relevant side (with some minutes of Root and Reese to set up E13). And then yes E13 was about finding Shaw. E14 was about Harold on jury duty (with nary a mention of Shaw – well maybe a sentence or two tops). So one episode. Even  looking at the whole season – the next episode where finding Shaw was an issue was E22. So 2 eps total.  I almost wish they had focused more on finding Shaw then maybe Root would have been on more than barely a couple of minutes (if even that) most eps and there would have been fewer auditioning episodes. Basically Root was underused this season. For me Root tends to be the highlight of the episodes she's in, so I guess it's again something to agree to disagree on. Like about her being an amalgam of Faith/Buffy/Fred (though I know Fred only from YT from checking out Amy Acker's previous roles). I don't see that at all. Regarding Root and challenges I've also had a different impression than you.  Also, I've seen it mentioned numerous times that first seasons were character driven and later ones are plot driven. I think that might even be the prevalent opinion. I don't agree. They've always has arc-stories – FBI chasing Reese, HR etc. The difference (to me) is that now the arc plot is actually interesting and (again in my view) has afforded more glimpses into the characters and has forged more interesting (and stronger) relationships between them. So to me later seasons are better on both accounts – character exploration and big arc. Obviously it's a matter of preference.  EDIT: typos"
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,Trueogre,3,Fri May 29 21:39:59 2015 UTC,I agree.
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,DesertedPenguin,2,Sun May 24 09:19:22 2015 UTC,"I part feel it may have been padding, but I can't be sure, because the show had half a dozen start-stops the second half of this season, which made it difficult to really get into it - and stay into it."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,Trueogre,5,Sun May 24 13:28:27 2015 UTC,Nolan and Plagman actually want a shorter season.  I think they've been wanting it for a while.
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,DesertedPenguin,8,Sun May 24 13:48:55 2015 UTC,"I do agree that they've wanted a shorter season for a while-- it's far less taxing on the entire POI team, and it could lead to much tighter writing. The problem, however, is that a shortened season pushed to midseason strongly indicates that this is the end of POI, at least on CBS. I don't think Nolan and Plageman were expecting that at all. They have the story mapped out for six seasons, so being forced to end things in 13 or so final episodes is going to be a huge challenge. I think we'd all be much happier if we knew that POI was getting one more shortened season so that the writers could wrap up properly."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,Trueogre,-1,Sun May 24 15:28:30 2015 UTC,Don't know why people think this is the end of POI just because of the shorter season run.  POI still has over 8 million viewers.  Not time yet to throw in the towel.
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,lolthr0w,6,Sun May 24 16:15:11 2015 UTC,"Any time a broadcast network gives a short-season order to a returning series, it's the end. Always.  And total viewers doesn't matter. The 18-49 demographic does, and POI's season finale came in at 1.1."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,DesertedPenguin,-2,Sun May 24 18:02:13 2015 UTC,Well if it gets a season 7 will you still be thinking this?  The proof is in the pudding.  Wait till it comes out the oven first.
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,SavannahNix,3,Sun May 24 20:47:46 2015 UTC,"It'd have to get a Season 6, first. If POI gets renewed off of a short-season order, something miraculous will have to happen. The most beneficial would be a HUGE ratings spike. We're talking a full, sustained spike near 2.0 levels in the 18-49 demographic. In other words, it'd have to challenge for Top 10 status and come close to doubling it's season finale rating.  See, numbers always tell the story. The season four finale ranked 18th in all of network programming that week for total viewers. But it didn't sniff the Top 25 in the demo. The demo is what matters. As long as it sat at 1.5-1.7, it was safer. But the final few episodes hit the 1.2 and 1.1 range, and that's not good.  We were fooled because the producers sounded so confident about a renewal. But the drop in ratings - both in the demo and overall - plus the fact that it's not owned by CBS means the end is nigh.  Now, it's possible that Warner Bros. moves it to another network like TNT or WGN. Possible. But unlikely.   The sooner people accept that this shortened season is most likely the end of the line, the better off the end will actually be."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,Trueogre,-2,Sun May 24 22:19:00 2015 UTC,Well ain't you a bucket of sunshine.  So if it does get a season 6 does that mean you won't watch it since you've already given up on the idea it's going to continue?
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,SavannahNix,3,Sun May 24 23:59:59 2015 UTC,"It might happen, it might not.  We can't see the future here.  But if it does, it would be the first time I've heard it happening recently.  The producers know that as well and will likely aim to close out the story anyway, so what exactly will make up 6?    Unless they get a deal set up with another network, very soon, they will likely have to aim for a close instead of risking not being able to tell the ending."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,SavannahNix,3,Mon May 25 00:19:08 2015 UTC,"Of course I'll watch. This is my favorite show on TV. It'd be a shockingly pleasant surprise.  Just being a realist, though. I've followed TV network habits for a long time. The broadcast networks are incredibly predictable. And thus, the writing is on the wall for POI.   I would love for it to continue for years to come. To realistically expect that, though, is foolish."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,yorokobi,3,Mon May 25 00:19:20 2015 UTC,"What is your problem? Deserted Penguin is being realistic. So am I. I am crushed by this turn of events. I would watch 20 seasons of POI, but it seems clear we aren't going to get them. Unlike many viewers, I don't think the conclusion of the Samaritan arc would mean the end of the show, so I cannot agree that 13 episodes is a good idea or that will give an effective end to the show. But since there is no history of numerous dramas being given a 13 episode order and going on for two, three or four more seasons that way, it doesn't look good. Shows are given an order for a short season for two reasons: one, if they are new and the network isn't sure that they will gain the viewership to sustain a whole season order, and two, if they are about to be cancelled.   Being concerned that it won't continue and not watching if it does are two completely different things. They are certainly not cause and effect."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,Samachinatin,2,Wed May 27 20:31:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm a glass half full person.  There is no reason why the show can't be 13 episodes long since most of them are fillers with a little backstory thrown in.  At least with 13 they can keep a tight storyline.  Until the fat lady sings, I'm optimistic about there being another season."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,ariyahvansh,2,Wed May 27 20:37:34 2015 UTC,"Well, if you can tell me what network dramas continued with several more seasons after receiving an order for 13 episodes and a January premiere date, then I will be optimistic too. Are you in the U.S. or do you live in another country where the networks do things differently and that is why you can't seem to comprehend that this is a problem?  I don't care about a ""tight storyline"" or worry about having to watch so-called filler episodes. I care about the network killing the show. When they renew with an order for a full season of 22 eps, that is a reason to be happy. When they give a half-assed renewal of 13 or so eps and don't let the new season start until January instead of September, that is cause for concern.   You can be as optimistic as you want about a sixth season. I would have been too, before receiving this slap in the face from CBS. The network did the same thing to The Mentalist, another WB owned show, and that 13 ep season with the late start was that show's last. Again, if you can cite instances where networks have not cancelled dramas after doing this, I will be happy to see my glass as half full too."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,ZenZibbeh,2,Thu May 28 03:32:55 2015 UTC,"So, you have insider knowledge that CBS has no intention of canceling it after this next short season? How many shows with a short season order and a January air date have been renewed for two more seasons on network TV?  The number of viewers has less to do with renewal than the demographics and the fact that the show is not owned by CBS. It doesn't stand to make profits on it in syndication, so they don't care and will gladly renew shows that are poorly written with higher demographics that will make them money.  I would love to see a seventh season, but I don't plan on applauding CBS and naively thinking they really support and want the show to continue. The pudding is starting to burn, better check that oven and do something instead of standing by hoping for the best."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,SavannahNix,1 point,Wed May 27 20:22:16 2015 UTC,this whole thread is TV Excuse Bingo
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,Gearsofhalowarfare,5,Sun May 24 16:42:02 2015 UTC,"Meh. Screw the people who think PoI should be just a procedural about two guys solving crimes. They can't reconcile the notion that the series was built and specifically designed to turn into a serial. I thought the transition was scarily organic in nature, and opened up the scope of what the show could really do. The procedural-ish aspect was built so intricately into the world lore, and in The Machine, I doubt the show runners would abandon it completely. There is a lot of love for the show on twitter and tumblr. And let's not forget that POI has a massive international following. The subject matter just hits home in places like Russia and China.... In any case, it's gonna get syndication... and hopefully online distributors like Netflix will consider POI to be a long term addition to their lineup once CBS decides to drop the show."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,baultista,3,Sun May 24 16:49:24 2015 UTC,"Exactly how I feel about this show. The procedural plots were critical in building the fabric of the Person of Interest world and I think it helped me appreciate the large scope and detail that gradually formed into what would eventually become a science fiction artificial intelligence storyline. I am glad they didn't dive quickly or soon into the A.I. storyline because if they did it wouldn't have a significant meaning and as much of a connection to me. The beginning procedurals helped formed the characters backgrounds and relationships as well as developed them into what they are now. I am also glad they didn't just stick to procedural format for the remainder of the series (though it is still there, just reduced) because I believe the Machine was always the key to being the main focus. So it doesn't make sense when I read about the complaints of the show being too confusing, or it needs to go back to it saving only the numbers. First off, let the creators decide what they want to do with their show and let them stick to their own ideas. Second, how could a show not use such a creative and unique machine and progress, develop and build upon it as the basis of the show and overall the world of that show. It just seems like an obvious thing to do, why wouldn't anyone want to take the opportunity to make the show from being a procedural with a hint of science fiction in a surveillance program to an all out serialized super artificial intelligence war against two gods of A.I. How can someone be confused, bored, or wanting it to deprogressed and revert back to what it was once before. That is not smart and they are dumb complaints. To me it doesn't make sense how someone can't love the Samaritan and Machine storyline. I never like watching a show that it too close to reality because that is what I watch television shows like Person of Interest, to see a world that does not exist in this world and that it thought provoking and makes do some critical thinking and imaginative creativeness. Apparently some people who did watch or are watching Person of Interest didn't like thinking hard or understanding awesome storylines. (and the storyline isn't that confusing compared to LOST. jeez that show is confusing.)"
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,Gearsofhalowarfare,2,Sun May 24 17:31:43 2015 UTC,This. All of this. Well said.
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,SavannahNix,3,Sun May 24 17:38:19 2015 UTC,Hardly anyone I know watches it. Every person I get to watch it loves it though.  Sadly I just don't think it's advertised as much as their other programs :(
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,ElderBuu,2,Sun May 24 14:02:23 2015 UTC,And that again is because CBS just doesn't care about it.
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,DesertedPenguin,6,Sun May 24 15:42:26 2015 UTC,"Just because a show is popular that doesn't mean it has to go on forever. I'd much rather the writers end the show the way they want to than drag it out for another few series, run out of ideas and then the show ends on a low note."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,ElderBuu,7,Sun May 24 08:24:21 2015 UTC,I'd much rather the writers end the show the way they want to than drag it out for another few series   I'm under the impression the writers arent at that stage yet?
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,DesertedPenguin,3,Sun May 24 09:01:10 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they have an ending in mind.  It's just a matter of how much runway they have to track from our current state to that ending.  The other x-factor there is Sarah Shahi and whether she will be able to return to filming.  With sufficient time you could do an entire episode (or three) of just Harold re-training The Machine with flashbacks to his original time spent training it (chess, poker, etc). You could do an entire story arc about whether the new incarnation of The Machine shares the same consciousness as the one that loved Harold as a father or whether it shares more in common with Samaritan. You have Sameen, who was teased as giving up key information about Team Machine after continual torture.  Did they do anything more nefarious with her?  Samaritan was engineering mind-control type devices -- was Sameen a test subject?  If Team Machine recovers her, can they and will they trust her? What about Harold's first love? What about Control?  I honestly think there's enough there for 2 to 3 full seasons worth of television.  Realistically I think they could accomplish a satisfying finale in 1-2 full seasons.  A 13 episode season with no guarantee of renewal after the fact gives them an incredibly minuscule amount of runway to the series finale, should they choose to write it as such.   I suppose our only hope is that the show thrives on Netflix.  Everyone here should tell everyone they know to watch it on Netflix."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,ElderBuu,2,Sun May 24 16:51:25 2015 UTC,"I thought I recalled them tweeting or writing a blogpost about having mapped out the final few episodes... maybe not.  But either way, if they know they're getting a full series to finish it off then they can do so in a convincing fashion and actually give it a decent send-off. Compared to the likes of 2 or 3 of the Stargate series, two of which were given basically no notice that the show wasn't getting renewed for another series so they had to cobble together an ending that didn't satisfy anyone."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,DesertedPenguin,2,Sun May 24 10:28:58 2015 UTC,"Just because they have always known how they plan on ending the show doesn't mean they are ready to finish it up in only 13 episodes. They have also said several times that in their vision, they had planned in sex seasons."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,ElderBuu,2,Sun May 24 15:30:53 2015 UTC,"Right show on the wrong channel. This show is not for the usual CBS viewer demographic. Probably will be better if some other channel picks it up, like ABC, or on whatever channel Agents of Shield airs."
PersonOfInterest,372jjm,hitmeaxou,2,Sun May 24 16:03:06 2015 UTC,"ABC won't pick it up. No broadcast network will. They've have the same issue as CBS: They don't own the show.  The best hope would be one of two cable channels: TNT (owned by Warner Bros., which owns POI) or WGN (which is where POI's syndication deal starts this fall)."

There would be less revenue sharing by not having a split deal with CBS but it's also possible viewership would decline and advertisers would be less interested.  It's also possible the cast would be less amenable to it. It's one thing to be a star on a CBS network show, but on TNT it might be different. Especially for a guy like Caviezel or a critically acclaimed actor like Emerson.   All of which makes it doubtful it continues whenever CBS cancels it."

If we still don't know by then, then perhaps Greg will mention something about it on June 5th at the ATX panel. I'm praying that we'll get at least 16 episodes. CBS has a feedback form. I encourage you all to write to them and let them know that we want more episodes. You can also tweet to them @CBS or @CBSTweet.   As for when POI will air, I don't really know. It's a midseason replacement, so if a new show gets cancelled shortly after its debut, then POI will take over."

PersonOfInterest,36yogl,Shrykull1,20,Sat May 23 06:01:44 2015 UTC,"I've seen this opinion expressed before, but for me it was just the opposite. Until then I thought POI was more or less a usual procedural – though better than most (well, except the beginning of 3rd season, which was really weak) – but ultimately forgettable and not really engaging beyond those 45 minutes.  Dialogue and acting are also if anything better than before. Meaning - to me it seems there have been more memorable scenes (= combination of dialogue and acting) post Carter. I also didn't think the show intriguing before. Now it is.  I think with the noticeable dip in the beginning of third season and the somewhat weaker then usual standalone episodes this season – had the show tried to full on use the S1&S2 formula that would not have made a season of strong standalones, but as evidenced by the standalones we got in S3 and S4 – POI would have gone the way usual for procedurals and would have been a pale impression of its first seasons. The kind where you see that the show is being made only to rake in the money and that you (for a while) continue to watch out of habit. Instead POI went and reinvented itself (yes that was set up from the beginning, but effect was the same).  POI now has juice for at least 2 more FULL seasons and I'm pretty mad that it seems we are not going to get that. Instead some brain-dead endeavors get their n-th seasons."
PersonOfInterest,36yogl,eikeegimuu,7,Sat May 23 07:20:14 2015 UTC,"I've seen a lot of people say that the show only became interesting to them once it went into the AI arc. I've also seen a lot of people express your point of view that when Carter died the show went downhill and their love for it dwindled.   Personally, I like both halves equally. To be POI has evolved brilliantly. The good news is we will always have seasons 1-2. That's why I am psyched they're doing something different now - different but equally awesome."
PersonOfInterest,36yogl,man_in_the_suit,4,Sat May 23 07:50:59 2015 UTC,"I love the Samaritan plot and I don't think that the characterization has been any worse than in previous seasons. In some ways I think that Shaw's situation has been leveraged better in its effect on the primary cast than Carter's was. Of course, Elias was integral to the HR plot while the gangs of New York have been quite peripheral to Samaritan. I like that Shaw's apparent death had a much more visceral reaction from Root. It has been a very humanizing season for Root, IMHO. Root, as the person closest to The Machine, hasn't always been the character most grounded in reality. John coming to a place where he realizes that he needs to be a team player was also an interesting development this season. The addition of Dominic to recurring was a little underwhelming, but I appreciate what they were trying to do by adding a nemesis for Elias that corresponded to what Samaritan is to The Machine. The show did not allow for enough time to make us care about him, unfortunately. I like the tighter myth arc. I loved If-Then-Else. I was happy to see the return of Control. The addition of Harper to recurring allies was fun, while I question the point of Iris.   I have a suspicion that what you may be feeling now is that it seems like they've done most of the intriguing things that they could do, that there just isn't as much mystery as there was in the early seasons and this, for some, makes the show inherently less interesting. For me it does not, as the subject matter is still fascinating to me and I love these actors."
PersonOfInterest,36yogl,Control_Alt-Delete,3,Sat May 23 09:10:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know what you mean. I'm torn between the two arcs tbh. On one hand, POI was an amazing procedural during its first 2 seasons, on the other, it's also a very cool show about Artificial Intelligence. I think both arcs are necessary to make the show what it is and ultimately some people are going to prefer one over the other. Personally I enjoy them both, because both were good at what they were trying to accomplish - the more procedural part of the show was approached in an original way, different from most procedurals, which immediately makes it stand out. However, I think the general discontentment with the turns the show has taken comes from a misunderstanding of what the show is about. The premise of the show is not about solving crimes (although it's more comfortable to think so). It's about using AI to solve these crimes. The main character is basically the one we never 'see' on screen - the machine (this is entirely my opinion and you are more than allowed to disagree). So ultimately the story is about Artificial Intelligence, just sugarcoated a bit in the first seasons to give viewers something they can relate to (I believe most people wouldn't tune in were the show exclusively about AI as it would get boring after a while). I think the writers were very clever in that they mixed both themes and tried to appeal to different audiences. The crime part of the show was created to bring the viewers in, hook them on the show and then try to tell the story they wanted to tell (it's hard to tell a story when there's no one to listen/see!). In the end, there are always going to be people who love the later arcs and people who prefer the first more procedural ones. Regarding the dialogue and the acting, I think the standards have not been lowered at all. But I think this Samaritan-arc is more plot-oriented rather than character-oriented, which means sometimes character development or accuracies will be dropped in favor of the plot (which is fine sometimes, just not too many)."
PersonOfInterest,36yogl,uranianhipster,1 point,Sun May 24 01:42:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of what you've said. However, I would like to comment further on one thing you've expressed:    But I think this Samaritan-arc is more plot-oriented rather than character-oriented, which means sometimes character development or accuracies will be dropped in favor of the plot   I don't know if that's entirely true. There are several instances in which character development has gone hand-in-hand with the plot. Root's personal decision to save Cyrus instead of the chip in ""Root Path"" led to Samaritan gaining this important tool that enabled it to function. Reese, Finch and Shaw's decision not to kill Congressman McCourt in ""Death Benefit"" led to Samaritan acquiring government feeds and coming online. ""Prophets"", too, gave us insight into Root and Finch's characters in particular while tying into the overarching plot. The team's desperation to find Shaw because of her importance to them led to them capturing Control in ""Control-Alt-Delete"", which then made her aware of the fact that Samaritan was operating independently. In turn, we saw her interrogate Shelley and learn about the Correction, leading to her capture by Greer. In ""Asylum"", Root and Finch's decision to attempt to rescue Shaw, despite knowing that they were probably walking into a trap, led to the Machine giving up Her location in order to save Her human agents. In sum then, I don't really think that the Samaritan arc has sacrificed character development for plot; rather, characters' development has directly influenced the plot."

I have watched most of those episodes (aside from Asylum) a long time ago so I didn't really remember, but thanks for calling me out on it :)  Overall it just goes to prove how awesome of a show POI is."
PersonOfInterest,36yogl,uranianhipster,0,Sun May 24 19:19:11 2015 UTC,"The area in which this season has been less character oriented is that they have neglected Finch and Reese. Where Finch was the genius who was mostly three steps ahead of any adversary, now he has been relegated to Root's sidekick, unable to make a decision or do very much on his own. And Reese has barely been the kickass hero we met in season one. Aside from the awful Iris scenes, he has not shown much growth or even emotion. And ever since Carter died, the writers forgot -- cough, retconned, cough -- his friendship and devotion to Finch for giving him a second chance and a purpose. I always loved the Machine story, but I watched for the interesting dynamic between Reese and Finch and they have barely had scenes together, much less conversations this season."
PersonOfInterest,36yogl,SavannahNix,2,Sun May 24 15:54:06 2015 UTC,"I absolutely love the Samaritan story arc, but I do think there has been some declining quality in season 4.

PersonOfInterest,36yogl,bout_350,2,Sun May 24 01:38:13 2015 UTC,"I agree. Episodes 14-18 of this season were momentum killers. I can understand why 14 and 15 needed to be slower-- we were just coming off several intense, emotional episodes. And you know, I actually enjoyed them (14 was a solid standalone; 15 didn't really go anywhere but I liked it well enough all the same). But 16-18 really should have been building up to the finale better. I wish that instead of what we actually got in ""Karma"", we instead had those Martine flashbacks that Greg said they'd wanted to do. 4x17 could have been a Martine/Samaritan-centric that gave us better insight into their motivations. It would have led more smoothly to the final two episodes. ""Karma"" was unfortunately a waste of an episode, in my honest and humble opinion.   ETA: To be fair, it must have been really hard for the writers to reconstruct the second half of the season to accommodate for Sarah Shahi's absence. So, despite the meh-ness of 14-18, I still give props to the writers for giving us an overall impressive season 4."

PersonOfInterest,36nmb9,theavenged,7,Wed May 20 18:21:24 2015 UTC,"I'd say they're conceptually similar, but there's a big difference in scale and overtness.    I haven't seen TWS since it was in theaters, but my recollection is that the idea there was that millions of people would be gunned down from orbit as soon as the satellites went live.   Obviously this would be a huge event and there'd be no hiding who was responsible.  Then, HYDRA planned to rule more or less openly as dictators, because nobody could oppose them.  Samaritan killed fewer people, and also does not appear to be interested in anybody knowing that anything even happened-- everybody died in accidents, or as a result of violence that can't be traced back to Samaritan.  Samaritan wants to rule such that humanity will never know that Samaritan is really in control."
PersonOfInterest,36nmb9,Recovering_Lawyer,8,Wed May 20 18:33:49 2015 UTC,Exactly. HYDRA killed the many to benefit the few. Samaritan killed the few to benefit the many. Samaritan's is much more grey and arguably justifiable than HYDRA's which screams evil genius plan.
PersonOfInterest,36nmb9,man_in_the_suit,4,Wed May 20 18:45:10 2015 UTC,"That's the interesting thing for me, Samaritan is less blatantly evil in that it's killing bad guys (even if they're awesome like Elias), and that it's pinpointed the key troublemakers rather than offing everyone that shows even a hint of trouble (I suppose that would be the equivalent of Samaritan killing all of the ""Deviants"" instead of just a small subset of them)."
PersonOfInterest,36nmb9,Maverick314,5,Thu May 21 03:26:07 2015 UTC,"Well it kills anyone that it perceives to be a threat (Grice & Schiffman).

PersonOfInterest,36nmb9,News_Bot,3,Fri May 22 13:55:37 2015 UTC,"My understanding was that Samaritan is killing/targeting the ""eternal rebels"", the people that will always be against ""the system"", no matter what the system is...sort of like the people in the Matrix that would not accept the program, no matter how perfect they life was(the Agent mentions them at some point, in regards to one of the first iterations of the Matrix)..."
PersonOfInterest,36nmb9,vali1005,3,Fri May 22 18:01:40 2015 UTC,"Right-- not to drag this too far off course, but the MCU definitely has the feature of HYDRA lacking a coherent ideology or plan, such that it's hard to see just how so many people are willing to fake-devote their lives to SHIELD out of a real-devotion to HYDRA.  It makes them a far weaker villain than the Inhumans, Loki, or even Ultron.  We know less about Samaritan's plan.  If it restricted itself to offing serial killers who otherwise wouldn't be caught, it would basically be machine Dexter and most people wouldn't mind too much.  But of course, when you start down that road it never ends well..."

I feel like Samaritan really can't just kill them all, because it would cause a pandemic of chaos.  I think it is more likely to expose their dirty laundry and get them voted out/arrested/resign/etc."
PersonOfInterest,36g900,atomiczap,4,Tue May 19 06:31:19 2015 UTC,I'd take it that a few staffers and aids are also counted among the 120. Or maybe they're the assets.

PersonOfInterest,36g900,Crimson_Six,3,Tue May 19 13:03:04 2015 UTC,"Does anybody else feel there are way too many assets? I mean, I know when we see the numbers on the Samaritan agents they are in the hundreds, but assets in the Pentagon and at the Stock Exchange and Congress and who knows what else. That's a lot more assets than I considered Samaritan to have before."
PersonOfInterest,36g900,lostinillusia,6,Wed May 20 04:14:23 2015 UTC,"maybe they are just occasional assets, such as Harper that is used only to save Fusco.

PersonOfInterest,36g900,ReadsSmallTextWrong,5,Wed May 27 03:03:20 2015 UTC,It could be anyone Samaritan can manipulate to accomplish tasks.

PersonOfInterest,36g900,ReadsSmallTextWrong,3,Wed May 27 03:06:18 2015 UTC,Possibly Samaritan already did eliminate some of them in that first purge. Though not all deviants would be on the hit list anyway – from what we’ve seen it doesn’t take that much for Samaritan to classify someone as deviant. Doesn’t mean Samarian would see all deviants as important enough to be dealt with like that. Also some of them may actually be dangerous (in a terrorist or sell out kinda way – thus they would be dealt with officially).

I was afraid that ""the correction"" would involve somehow killing them all, but instead, it only targeted the most deviant deviants, the people who are the furthest from what Samaritan wants them to be.    Also, threats to the system like Control, Schiffman, and Grice.  They certainly weren't particularly ""deviant"" by Samaritan's usual standards, but they were a threat to Samaritan's continued existence because they were working to shut it down."

PersonOfInterest,36h4qe,ariyahvansh,5,Tue May 19 10:57:22 2015 UTC,I love the extended version. Its not much but I like a few things in it.   Shows more of the early library setup that they used. Some extra footage instead of voice over of Reese saying how he would do things Finch explains that he built a phone capable of performing hacking faster than regular tools that Reese was used to Early Reese apartment but was used for something else later in the show since the extended version part was not aired.
PersonOfInterest,36h4qe,SavannahNix,3,Tue May 19 13:28:42 2015 UTC,"IIRC, the extended version also shows Finch telling Reese about Pandora's box, which Root alludes to in ""Deux Ex Machina"".

The man was another guy that Reese investigated for having something to do with the number. IIRC, he was another person she had sent to prison. In the aired pilot, he appears to just be a random guy they picked up off the street, but if their plan to kill the male DA had worked it would have looked like this man had a motive.  The apartment is a place Finch said he owned and he sent Reese there to get a decent night's rest. Later, that set was used as Will Ingram's apartment."

What went in to the suitcase was most likely a somewhat pared down version of the Machine's core code, but it would still be insanely large and complex by human standards - it wouldn't be the original code that Harold created over a decade ago. What's more I'm sure the Machine tried to throw some key memories in to the case as well.

Talking about enter, did you notice that any kind of text from the Machine is a continuous stream of sentences like it doesn't need to breathe (it actually doesn't need to breathe... but that's beyond my point)  Whereas   Samaritan   just   press   enter   after   every   single   word   like   a   handicapped   person."
PersonOfInterest,361cbs,naeads,2,Fri May 15 13:13:00 2015 UTC,The way Samaritan communicates is actually a more efficient way of reading. I saw it on Reddit months before Samaritan went online in the show.
PersonOfInterest,361cbs,your_mind_aches,1 point,Fri May 15 16:13:14 2015 UTC,I think the one word at time is to give Samaritan more gravitas. But that comparison would fit nicely with the Machine having a more advanced brain. I have been waiting for some way to have the Machine prove superior to Samaritan since the Machine was able to get off the ground with old hardware and Samaritan needed more “external help”. Though I suppose both being in the end as fast as they are there's no advantage in exactly how they manage that.

Both fabulous car but the winner is obviously on who gets the better maintenance."

PersonOfInterest,361cbs,eikeegimuu,3,Mon May 18 19:08:54 2015 UTC,Episode 3 : CLAIRE  Synopsis – Three Flashbacks of Claire Mahoney  Plot – Samaritan sends teams of Business Analysts and Lawyers to 18 Companies who are presently at different stages of developing self – learning algorithms with the ultimate goal of creating an AI. Samaritan’s plan is to acquire all these companies and to cripple the projects or to ensure that the companies are destroyed financially or its key members killed by Samaritan agents. Claire is authorized to handle the manner along with Zachary whom she discovers has a second phone with which he communicates with his young boy – Sean who is in a boarding school in Connecticut. This second phone is not monitored by Samaritan.  Beginning-  Claire sets up meetings with the CEO’s and CFO’s of 18 startups in California and across USA and offers to purchase 100% control of each of the companies. She observes that the 2 CEO’s who refuse the deal – are later on killed in muggings or robberies gone wrong and two more CEO’s are targeted for further elimination.  Flashback 1- 2010  15 Year Old Claire - a chess champion and honors student in High School – has a sick 12 year old Golden Retriever Dog – Buddy who is sick and whom her parents are planning to euthanize.  Claire learns that a surgery for $ 5000 is possible to rescue the dog and give it 8-10 months more. Claires parents feel that the surgery is agreeable but Claire who finds out that her dog will suffer more – breaks into the clinic and euthanizes the animal herself.  Flashback 2  - 2013  Claires parents are killed in a hit and run – caused by the drunk son of an Ohio Senator. Claires fathers best friend who is a Lieutenant investigating the case- takes the lead and arrests the perpetrator –  Francis Drayper s/o Senator George Drayper.  Claire is promised justice.  Flashback 3 – 2013  After almost 3 months – the Court hands over a suspended sentence to Francis Drayper which shocks Claire. Claire then discovers that Senator Drayper paid a huge sum to the debt ridden Lieutenant to fudge his investigation and to prove that Drayper was not under any influence and that the problem was  a mechanical one with the Car.  Claire who hacks the data and tries to hand over the information to the DA – is captured by the Lieutenant (who was her fathers closest friend) and a plastic bag is put over her head and she is left to die.  However she is rescued and the attempt is called suicidal. Claire decides that there is no justice and no true affections. She keeps staring at the wall and refusing to say anything beyond the fact that she tried to commit suicide because her parents were killed.  Flashback 4 – 2015  Immediately when Samaritan recruited Claire and after she finished her training – Greer gives Claire a gift – as Zachary takes her and introduces her to the Lieutenant (Bound and Gagged) and to the Francis Drayper (Bound and Gagged) – to a new Jaguar which is to be set fire to and dropped down the mountainway – crashing at least 3000 feet below.  As the Lieutenant and the Senators Son burn to cinder and fall to their deaths – Claire is revealed to be mortified.  Ending  Claire who now realizes she is in bed with the devil – sends a secret encrypted message through Zachary’s phone to the remaining 2 CEOS (Which include Caleb Phipps) to run for their lives and go into hiding and go digitally blind.  Climax  Samaritan who is monitoring the 2 CEO’s Phones – see that young CEO Danson Paul has got a message asking him to go blind and into hiding realizes that there is a mole in its midst and evaluates strategy…..

PersonOfInterest,361cbs,hitmeaxou,2,Fri May 15 09:10:15 2015 UTC,the storyline is awesome.... especially the euthanizing the dog part and the gruesome past would account for claires sudden loss in human values and her suicidal tendencies. however a small tip - if you want to write such a detailed thing - i suggest you post it in a fanfiction. in this subreddit - just the basic plotline would suffice...

PersonOfInterest,35xm3i,whitewater2,13,Thu May 14 10:55:49 2015 UTC,"That’s the straw people have been grasping on for days.  Unfortunately with the updates from yesterday about how CBS and POI are discussing whether this will be the last season (with a very big likelihood that CBS isn’t interested in continuing and just isn’t saying yet) it’s safe to say that those two things: shorter season + possibility that the shorter season will also be the final season don’t compute with what POI creators would want. Since they have been talking about a sixth (presumably full length) season.   So no, that initiative without the guarantee of continuation didn’t come from POI.  I’m trying to be happy about POI having for sure at least those 13 episodes rather than being canceled outright, since a shortened season makes it in this case rather likely that that was already won in negotiations and CBS was inclined to cancel it outright. But yeah 13 ain’t enough.  Hopefully Nolan&co will inform the fans as soon as things in relation to CBS are definite and whether they’ll keep trying elsewhere (as some interviews prior to the S4 finale seemed to indicate).  If there’s any chance at all to continue my wish would be that they end the run on CBS with a finale that works as a finale (meaning not a cliff-hanger), but that they don’t blow the finale they’ve imagined from the start already now and try to find the show a new home.  EDIT: Fixed spelling"
PersonOfInterest,35xm3i,eikeegimuu,7,Thu May 14 11:52:00 2015 UTC,"Not saying its justification for how CBS described POI and others shows ""on the bench"" which is just an insult.  Today we should hear more from the POI camp (hopefully). Im sure Nolan is driving CBS executives crazy with some f-bomb laden rants.  I would rather them walk away and try another station that deal with CBS lack of support of the show."
PersonOfInterest,35xm3i,HSChronic,3,Thu May 14 12:59:47 2015 UTC,Yeah I would love to see this show lengthened to an hour and put on Netflix with a 13 episode order.

PersonOfInterest,35xm3i,ariyahvansh,5,Thu May 14 13:55:57 2015 UTC,"Every article I read yesterday indicated that CBS hasn't yet decided on how many episodes POI would have. It'll be less than 22 for sure, but we might get more than 13. I could settle for 15-17 episodes. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for that. The more the merrier, obviously (I mean, I'd rather have #6SeasonsAndAMovie), but 15-17 episodes might just be enough for them to conclude the story. 13, however, sure as hell isn't enough."
PersonOfInterest,35xm3i,eikeegimuu,1 point,Thu May 14 20:05:29 2015 UTC,"I read the same, but I don't put much faith in getting more from CBS. I'm focusing on those 13 being hopefully guaranteed (since I guess there have been midseason shows with even fewer episodes). If the actual number would turn out to slightly more that 13 then great, but even 17 wouldn’t be enough to tell the story as is should be told. Though with 17 it wouldn’t be as ridiculous to attempt it."

PersonOfInterest,35ya25,1701ncc,11,Thu May 14 14:59:12 2015 UTC,"That is why Samaritan is so flawed, but it is still young and probably doesn't know what will happen."
PersonOfInterest,35ya25,TheIsraelson,11,Thu May 14 15:01:20 2015 UTC,"I doubt Samaritan planned that as final solution for eradicating crime. Rather – if normal society has to adhere to rules and criminals don’t then that gives the advantage to the criminals and makes the fight against criminals that much more difficult. Samaritan leveled the playing filed for starters and will not mind having several more of those corrections in the future.  Greer’s speech about a few disruptive individuals doesn’t contradict that. Samaritan is moving step-by-step and of course it takes several waves of corrections until (close to) everyone is properly terrified and doesn’t try to step out. Also, really most people are more or less law abiding and Samarian is targeting those who aren’t."
PersonOfInterest,35ya25,eikeegimuu,3,Thu May 14 15:20:00 2015 UTC,"This reminds me of the quote from M.I.A. ""A few must be displaced so that the majority may thrive."" Samaritan just enacted a larger scale version of what it did at Maple."
PersonOfInterest,35ya25,CatandWolf,5,Thu May 14 15:46:52 2015 UTC,"Samaritan picked the worst for a quick 'correction'. It watched for a year before it chose.  Remember it's doing agriculture, weather control, education programs and behavioral modification programs, too. Its plan is to slowly integrate itself with the world, this was just a quick stop-gap improvement.  We haven't seen what came of the Samaritan Kid asking for an audience with the president, either."
PersonOfInterest,35ya25,irobeth,3,Fri May 15 00:39:52 2015 UTC,"Samaritan isn't just trying to get rid of criminals, or ""deviants"". It's trying to change humanity into what it thinks it should be, ergo ""reshape its reality"", and despite what we saw (apparently better lives, better education system etc.) its true plan is to make humans its puppets. And one of the first steps is killing off criminals, because they cause too much trouble. And if one were to question authority one would also be immediately executed, which ultimately is not that different from our Government. And all this while remaining unnoticed."

That's a question lots of authors have been asking, you can see it in time travel stories.   I personaly think if Samaritan eliminates all very remarkable people, such as Harold, Dominic, Elias etc, who cause troubles or against it, then Samaritan can build future as he wants."
PersonOfInterest,35ya25,ElderBuu,2,Fri May 15 02:31:00 2015 UTC,"This is why the show has always made metaphoric comparisons, like Samaritan represented by a child the first time it talks to Finch, and meanwhile the machine just says nothing. Shows how young and arrogant samaritan is, like a prodigial child who developed a big ego."
PersonOfInterest,35ya25,jxdjxd,2,Fri May 15 09:31:34 2015 UTC,"It's like that line from the Dark Knight, ""Just think what you could do with 18 months of clean streets."" Sure new bad guys will move in to fill the power vacuum but in the meantime, Samaritan is free to continue building its control. Who knows, maybe it will even fill some of that crime vacuum itself.

The Machine is not supposed to value Finch over anyone else, but She helps Reese find him She moves herself As Thornhill, She has done all sorts of things She wasn't meant to do - created a persona, a company, recruited agents like Harper, designed those electrical boxes and had them installed, etc. The Machine was created solely to stop terrorist attacks - She had to figure out what to do when the terrorist is actually a part of the gov't She's protecting. And Her ultimate decision was to save Herself so she could continue to search for a solution.   It's not until the very end of the episode that Finch truly believes his Machine is sentient and benevolent. Because he always kept his distance, he's hasn't experienced a real conversation.   He was right to fear, The Machine could easily have become a monster like Samaritan (remember the flashback where it tried to kill him). And keeping his distance also allowed him to teach the Machine in an objective way and by example, instead of confusing conversations with it about morals or something.   And with Root and Greer as examples to Finch of how lack of objectivity can lead to disaster, it's a good thing Finch didn't get too emotionally attached early on."
PersonOfInterest,35x6jx,serralinda73,6,Thu May 14 10:06:55 2015 UTC,i dont think it tried to kill him. it was a previous version
PersonOfInterest,35x6jx,bout_350,3,Thu May 14 13:15:28 2015 UTC,"Only point of contention, I don't believe The Machine still uses Thornhill to retain her memories. I believe when Finch's virus set her free at the end of season two, she simply stopped wiping her own memory."
PersonOfInterest,35x6jx,Trueogre,3,Thu May 14 10:30:01 2015 UTC,"I think the new rules are the ones it broke during dire times.  It broke the rule twice and both times Finch was in trouble or would be.  The first time was when Reese asks the Machine outright to help him find Finch after Root kidnapped him the first time.  The Machine spat out a number that wasn't relevant or irrelevant (about to die or sanctioned to die).  If you think about it, it's a big deal because clearly the Machine keeps some relevant data on Finch and this was before the virus.  So Finch's purging of it's irrelevant memory was circumnavigated by the Machine because to the Machine he's always been relevant to it.  While it probably lost some of it's memory of Finch at midnight it always looked out for him.  The second time was when the Machine sent out McCourts number.  He was neither a relevant or irrelevant number (again because he wasn't about to die or was sanctioned to die).  The Machine fearing the power Samaritan would wield and knowing that Finch's close relationship to the Machine would ultimately result in his death along with the known assets to Greer's people.  In terms of McCourt this was the biggest disappointment for Finch in regards to the Machine.  It wanted them to murder just to prevent Samaritan going online because there was no other outcome it could choose apart from this scenario.  This goes against everything Finch believes in and won't go through with it, he ignores the Machine because of it and doesn't trust it.  If you think about when Finch created the Machine he needed a lot of servers to make it run, and when it went online it needed a lot more to data crunch.  Think of trying to stuff the entire Encylopedia Britannica books into a small suitcase, it ain't going to happen.  You can only save a few books not all, so you save the relevant ones and discard the rest.  In terms of saving the Machine, you think about the entire collection of the Encylopedia Britannica, you keep the contents and the index because this will tell you what was contained in those ones you threw away.  So you now have the daunting task of re-writing those missing passages.  So basically you may not get the same book as you did before you lost it.  That's my take on it anyway."
PersonOfInterest,35x6jx,john_gilpin,5,Sat May 16 21:21:56 2015 UTC,I think Finch was more interested in saving Shaw and Root than the machine....and even in YHWH refered to the machine as being cryptic on its best day and borderline homicidal on its worst. However the final conversation changed him completely. Just check out Finch's determined face as the finale ends....
PersonOfInterest,35x6jx,Rebyll,2,Thu May 14 06:55:26 2015 UTC,"I was under the impression that the new rules meant the more involved approach, and ultimately the direct intervention in YHWH"
PersonOfInterest,35x6jx,rvrHunter,1 point,Thu May 21 18:29:58 2015 UTC,"a bit off topic but does anyone wonder how the conversation went in episode 5 after finch said ""we need to talk, you and i"", if there even was an interaction between finch and the machine. I thought that would've been a perfect way for finch to introduce new rules/whatnot"
PersonOfInterest,35x6jx,bout_350,3,Fri May 15 02:27:35 2015 UTC,"I don't believe they ever had a conversation. The next episode we saw Finch setting up his plan to infiltrate Samaritan in Hong Kong, which we were led to believe was part of The Machine's plan, but when he actually tried to implement it, Root revealed that The Machine was not behind it. So I think when she made the bargain with Samaritan to release Finch and Root, that was the first time he saw her say something since he closed off her OS, before handing her over to Northern Lights."

I agree that If-Then-Else was the best episode of the season, but that also meant the bar was set very high, and some of the filler episodes felt a little disappointing (even though I understand we can't have 22 episodes like If-Then-Else). What I don't understand is how a show with this level of quality gets such shitty treatment."

PersonOfInterest,35uk7v,SavannahNix,1 point,Thu May 14 16:43:35 2015 UTC,"I am going by what the producers said. They said the Machine will be rebuilt and will give numbers. They said that before the shortened season was announced, but apparently they had no plans to never have them get a number again. And why must Samaritan be ""done"" before that can happen? That's just your speculation.  What do you mean by saying they spent four seasons undoing the Machine's capacity to give numbers or be connected to feeds? Who is they? The characters? The writers? Samaritan? Since the premise of the show was saving numbers and Samaritan didn't show up until third season, I disagree that anyone spent four seasons undoing that."
PersonOfInterest,35uk7v,SavannahNix,1 point,Mon May 18 04:28:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed. And the best part about this is that since it's so early on, they actually get to have this discussion instead of saying the show is canned like 5 episodes into a season or in the middle of a season.  If this does become the finale season, I will be happy. 5 years is good for a show. Every show doesn't need to be 10 seasons long, though as much as we want it. Some shows can absolutely last that long, but some shows can't.  The only thing I ask is, if this is the final season, please have an actual ending. That is all."

The show hasn't been the same without Shaw's snide asides.""] -Fellow Commenter   Damn, I hadn't even thought about that. What if Netflix was able to pick this series up? They've done it before with show like Arrested Development and Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Person of Interest will fit very well with Netflix as its host IMO. It never seemed to much of a CBS show to me from the start. Person of Interest outranks any other show on CBS in terms of story, character development, fight scenes, etc. but that's just my opinion. But if Netflix is able to pick this series up from CBS, that'd be so friggin awesome!"

A lot of people use the internet and torrent it and what not...plus we haven't really seen how well Person of Interest does on Netflix.

I was pointing out that a streaming service picked up a cancelled series. That is all.
PersonOfInterest,35uk7v,ariyahvansh,8,Sat May 16 17:47:47 2015 UTC,"I think we should starting tweeting/emailing Netflix and Warner Brothers about this. Emphasize to Netflix that POI has a huge Internet fan-base and an average of 9 million viewers (12 million if you include DVR ratings). It's a binge-watchable show too, and would therefore be perfect for Netflix. WB is very passionate about its shows and I think it'll fight for a new home for POI so that it could end its story properly."
PersonOfInterest,35uk7v,lordxeon,7,Mon May 18 04:25:42 2015 UTC,"With the first 3 seasons coming to Netflix this fall, hopefully the data will speak for itself that it's watchable, and likeable.  I know of a few people missed the first season that are planning on watching it on Netflix, (so long as I keep reminding them when it comes to Netflix that is)."
PersonOfInterest,35uk7v,ariyahvansh,3,Tue May 19 14:12:39 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping so too. The thing is, I want the writers to know for certain before July whether this is the last season altogether or whether they can continue the show on Netflix after CBS drops it. That knowledge would obviously enable them to determine how to approach this mini-season. And the actors need to know too. (I mean, it would suck if the show got saved by the end of season 5, but the actors had all decided to move on with other projects.) That's why I think it would help to get Warner Brothers to consider Netflix as a new home, and to get Netflix to consider taking POI under its wing. Now more than ever, fans need to make their voices heard. We need to make a huge collective effort to get this show a sixth season."

Since they introduced Samaritan, I think they fundamentally changed the conceit of the show. Going back to a case-of-the-week, collecting numbers format would be a huge step backwards. The stakes will never be as high as they are right now. Give the show a strong final run of 13 episodes, ending with either the defeat of Samaritan or the destruction of Team Machine, and I will be more than happy."

PersonOfInterest,35uk7v,DesertedPenguin,2,Wed May 13 19:37:56 2015 UTC,"While fun, the simple answer is far more mundane:   Warner Bros., not CBS, owns the show. WB gets all the juicy syndication money and other bits of cash. CBS gets...ad revenue. Ratings have slipped. Even the overall ratings are down, not just the prized demo. But when the demo ratings go from the 1.7-2.0 range and end around 1.1 (a series low), the show isn't exactly a beacon for advertisers for CBS to get some cash. It's expensive. From the graphics and 'splosions, to the cast, to the large swath of recurring characters, to shooting on location in the NYC area. It all costs money.    If CBS owned the show and had control over ALL revenue, maybe it'd be safer than a few others on the slate and get a full season. But it doesn't.  No conspiracy here. It's all about money, just like it always is."

First its (original) time slot was replaced with the-Machine-knows-what, then we had that string  of skips, where PoI wasn't even being shown, and then CBS wonders why ratings are slipping.

It is exciting, a great case and number of the week and gives a ton of insight into Reese and Finch's relationship as they learn to trust each other.

And there is some Fusco and Reese stuff too."

Not sure if you are in the US but CBS All Access just went live with more cities and its $5.99 a month and now covers most of the US. Which would give you live broadcast streaming of shows.

PersonOfInterest,35rsmz,mnr5530,7,Tue May 12 23:47:24 2015 UTC,"Well, let's try to be optimistic. Here we go   Rebuilding the Machine, destroying Samaritan and Shaw returning would be one big story arc. Shaw helps them from Inside Decima, Machine taking over Samaritan: somehow they will be interconnected. Elias will not be alive. There is no room for him. Maybe just a scene where the undisputed King of NY sends team Machine reinforcements but nothing more. John and Iris won't be developed enough. Iris sadly will remain just a plot point, not a character. Fuck you, CBS.   The main problem with a rushed season as many fear will be the lack of character development. But most of the characters have already finished their character arcs.   Finch - Finally accepts The Machine. [YHWH,S4]  Reese - Took a trip to the mountains, met an old friend, found what's missing. [Terra Incognita,S4]  Fusco - Turned his life around. [The Devil's Share,S3]  Root - Also turned her life around. Found a father-figure in Finch. Also Shaw. [Root Path,S3]  So, all characters have had a Character Finale of sorts. The only ones we're waiting for are Shaw and the Machine itself. One season might be enough for that.  P.S. - The more I think about it the more I'm in awe of POI. Character Finales. Why didn't anybody else think of that?"
PersonOfInterest,35rsmz,the_boomr,6,Wed May 13 01:33:05 2015 UTC,"I think people didn't think of character finales because generally viewers want all the characters to remain interesting and see more development, so if the writers give them each individual ""finales"" then they kinda just stagnate for the rest of the show unless new development is introduced.  That said, I think POI has handled this very well and I almost never felt like any of the characters were being tossed aside in the writing (although Fusco really hasn't had anything interesting going on in a pretty long time, he's literally just always there to help and make quips at the others)."
PersonOfInterest,35rsmz,eikeegimuu,2,Wed May 13 05:36:13 2015 UTC,"In a way what you are describing is what I’m afraid will happen. That everything is taken for granted and all repercussions are glossed over.  For example even (or especially) having Harold just accept the Machine would be simplifying things to an extreme. Machine 2.0 will be rebuilt from only a strand of the original Machine’s ""DNA"", it will not have the years of lessons with Harold nor the years it was forced to passively observe and come to some conclusions based on that. If Harold and Root set it free from the start now will they also give it some different parameters from the start (aside from setting it free) so it would be more able to defend itself? If so, then how far will that leeway be stretched in reality. So yeah waving a magic wand and saying that strand contained all what the Machine had become making it the same Machine and Harold just accepting it – not going to cut it. Fact is they don’t have time to deal with all the repercussions in only 13 episodes (since there are other things going on too), so they are either going to wave a magic wand or rush through it. Either way a disappointment.  The only character whom I don't see as loosing out on character development is Fusco – because his character really has traveled so far already and is now so steadfast that him going along with everything and trusting Reese and Harold (and what they are trying to accomplish) is just part of character continuity and doesn’t even need further explanations.

PersonOfInterest,35rsmz,hitmeaxou,2,Wed May 13 17:10:16 2015 UTC,rebuilding the machine may take 2-3 episodes. i presume mr thornhill would have already pre-ordered the drives and will be using calebs project x to rebuild itself. the rebuilding would be taking place in virginia where corwin lived and where there is no wifi in a defunct electronics hardware factory now purchased and owned by thornhill.  finishing the war would be what the fifth season is about.  elias - is alive and will be assuming control of the underworld - against someone being used by samaritan.  shaw rescues control and has been told to act brainwashed by the machine. thats why she did not reveal the subway plan.  john & iris will get married in the end...  endgame is a mad - mutually assured destruction
PersonOfInterest,35rsmz,News_Bot,1 point,Wed May 13 02:05:48 2015 UTC,"Project X was already used, it's the RAM chips used to store The Machine. I can imagine them stealing Samaritan's code using the original plan Harold conceived in Hong Kong, since Root kept the switch. Creating a Machine/Samaritan hybrid to confront Samaritan directly."
PersonOfInterest,35rsmz,UltraChip,1 point,Wed May 13 10:09:49 2015 UTC,the rebuilding would be taking place in virginia where corwin lived   That's actually a real place. It's not just WiFi - all forms of over-the-air radio transmission are extremely prohibited. As far as I know there's no electronics factories in that region but other than that it's a really interesting idea.
PersonOfInterest,35rsmz,man_in_the_suit,2,Wed May 13 14:37:41 2015 UTC,A movie can cover a lot of plot points in 2-3 hours. POI has potentially 9.5 hours to wrap things up if they remove filler. I'm remaining hopeful.
PersonOfInterest,35rsmz,eikeegimuu,1 point,Wed May 13 07:49:54 2015 UTC,"That ca 9.5 hours would equal even ca 5 or 6 movies (considering 1 h 40 minutes as the average length – then 5 movies if some would be longer or 6 if some would be shorter).  Which doesn’t sound bad at all, but the rules are different.   With separate movies the buildup has to happen basically once per movie, here each episode has to have some separate buildup, middle and end (that's already 6 times vs 13 times). And while our prior knowledge allows for doing away with the most basic character introductions, our prior knowledge also means that they can’t just do away with some aspects that don’t fit into the timeframe (as they are able to in movies). Basically movies are planned from the start to be more or less self-contained and they can cut whole chunks from the start if there is not enough time for them to pay off.  So I’m very doubtful about the possibility of getting a satisfying ending if there really are only 13 episodes left."
PersonOfInterest,35rsmz,man_in_the_suit,1 point,Wed May 13 17:16:31 2015 UTC,"True. But they have least amount of loose ends for the first time in POI history. We'll have to see. Maybe two 13 episode seasons are on the cards, or maybe it is a 16 episode season? Who knows at this point."
PersonOfInterest,35rsmz,eikeegimuu,1 point,Wed May 13 17:24:23 2015 UTC,"Two seasons of 13 episodes is what I'm hoping. That would make the story tight (hopefully without any secondary baddies), but would allow a proper conclusion. Though no excursions even on the subject of AI which I'd still be sad about, but at least already signaled themes would have enough space."

PersonOfInterest,35rsmz,Aimless_Drifter,2,Wed May 13 14:15:34 2015 UTC,"Elias is dead bro.  Let it go.  Anyway, copy-pasting my comment from another thread.   Many people, including me, are guessing that The Machine will be back in mid season finale.  I guess our team will have to ask help from other numbers and allies such as Arthur, Caleb , Leon, Harper, Zoe, Logan, Root's hacker buddies, to rebuild the Machine.   I guess Caleb will be an important character in next season. He's got money, space and infrastructure to help the team.  Also, if the government switches back to using The Machine then Samaritan will go rogue. If this does happen then I guess it will be in season finale and sixth season will deal with rogue Samaritan. But its too early to be sure.  As for Shaw, I hope she comes back by mid season finale.   13 episodes feel way short to me. It's all Jonah and Greg's fault. They made us hungry for PoI, made us used to it for 4 seasons and now they're taking it away. :("
PersonOfInterest,35rsmz,eikeegimuu,2,Wed May 13 15:10:56 2015 UTC,"My list for the worst case scenario of having only 13 episodes left:  2 episodes for team Machine to reestablish baseline (survive and get to the point where they can start being proactive not only defensive);  2 episodes to rebuild the Machine (with the Machine being switched on just at the end);  2 episodes for the Machine to readjust - with the help of team Machine getting necessary feeds, etc (ending with the Machine spitting out a number):  2 episodes for dealing with the doubt whether the Machine is “functioning” properly or is as ethical as before, which might just as well involve saving “irrelevants” (ending with the Machine spitting out Shaw’s number);  2 episodes for Shaw’s return (ending with Shaw reuniting with team Machine or deciding to stay in place to join them during final showdown);  3 episodes for the showdown.  And that’s just my list + even that is with shortcuts, including with leaving setbacks as part of those stories and basically have things only go uphill with the end of each double feature (not the greatest way to set up a last stand)."
PersonOfInterest,35rsmz,hitmeaxou,1 point,Wed May 13 18:05:33 2015 UTC,just pondered and hope for a wishlist of episodes    2 episodes on control and her escape.  1 episode exclusively on claire - her past history and her doubts about samaritan slowly creeping up 1 episode where caleb is person of interest because of project x - and how team machine save caleb.  3 episodes to close the underworld battle and establish elias as the new king of the underworld 3 filler episodes - saving meaningless persons - while simultaneously finch re-building the machine - assisted with project x and with new drives. 3 - main episodes - between the machine and samaritan's war

PersonOfInterest,35rsmz,UltraChip,1 point,Wed May 13 12:43:45 2015 UTC,"Rebuilding the Machine and the AI War are so intertwined that they'll probably be handled in the same plot arc, and said arc will probably be the main focus of next season.   I'm not sure Elias will be addressed - there may be one or two offhand scenes saying ""Look! He made it!"" but other than that I don't think the story will focus on him too much.   It's not obvious at all that Shaw is coming back. Yes the writers definitely want her back but that's wholly reliant on what Ms. Shahi wants to do - she's stated a few times she wants to focus on her kids right now. I'd say there might be a handful of cameos throughout next season and her character will likely be referenced off screen a lot but I don't think the story is going to rely on her in any meaningful way.   John and Iris will probably be quietly put on the backburner. PoI has never really done romantic plots very well (which I think is a good thing, honestly) and I bet the writers would rather focus on the big story - the AI War.   What you call the ""endgame"" sounds like an Epilogue - it can be addressed in a handful of scenes in the last episode."

The storyline is now as simple as it never was. Rebuilt the machine, destroy Samaritan.

Deadline is a very serious source, there is no reason to believe they got wrong information. All you really need is one big source like that. Tomorrow we will learn when they plan on airing it. 2015 or holding if off till 2016."
PersonOfInterest,35sfq8,rflairfan1,6,Wed May 13 03:07:32 2015 UTC,"Personally, I hope it's held off until 2016.    This improves the chances that Sarah Shahi will be able to come back so that they can explore what happened to Shaw.  It also might give the writers more time to plan out how to end things properly, assuming this is, in fact, the final season. They said that they had a lot more story they wanted to tell, and with a shortened final season, they won't be able to do that. So they need to make these last 13 episodes really spectacular.  If season 5 is not declared the final one, then there's still a chance that we can get a sixth season on either CBS (but that's unlikely) or Netflix (possible). A lot of people may watch POI on Netflix during the fall and could tune in for season 5 by its premiere in 2016, giving the show a ratings boost that could convince CBS to renew it again. Or, the POI's popularity on Netflix could convince it to take the show under its wing for a sixth and final shortened season.   It's a longer wait, and I know that such a hiatus will drive me mad, but airing in 2016 could potentially be a lot more beneficial to the show."

Which would be a pity. As it was in a way with the last 2 eps of this season - there'll be flashes of brilliance but the framing and pace will suffer (now the last 2 eps seem like possibly predicting the worst case scenario - they were suspecting a shortened and last season and wanted to get to a certain point before those 13 episodes).  Also, while they might have ideas about what else to explore while moving toward the AI endgame that doesn’t mean that even when focusing on AI it’s possible to make it organically happen with 13 episodes. That would mean either cramming in too much (thus going only halfway with everything that was crammed in). So to me it seems that 13 episodes total would make it very likely that things are going to get rushed and it’ll definitely be a lost opportunity to explore things (like motivations and concepts).

PersonOfInterest,35tesw,man_in_the_suit,-2,Wed May 13 10:47:49 2015 UTC,What is the point?
PersonOfInterest,35tesw,mnr5530,4,Wed May 13 10:49:44 2015 UTC,Ordinary lives matter. Nobody's irrelevant. That's the point.
PersonOfInterest,35tesw,mnr5530,-2,Wed May 13 11:07:22 2015 UTC,It's a good point but it doesn't make for great television. At least not in this case.
PersonOfInterest,35tesw,mnr5530,3,Wed May 13 11:19:42 2015 UTC,You're not helping with the snob moniker here. Just because YOU don't like it doesn't mean it's not great television.
PersonOfInterest,35tesw,mnr5530,-1,Wed May 13 11:24:17 2015 UTC,Most people would agree that shows with somewhat stand-alone episodes are worse than shows where storylines move through several episodes.
PersonOfInterest,35tesw,man_in_the_suit,3,Wed May 13 11:29:56 2015 UTC,"And they would be correct. But a good show can easily break the trend.  I get your point. I think I do. If POI is this good as a procedural, imagine how good it will be serialised, maybe that's your point. But it may not be so. Let's think about this. The most well-known tv Sci-fis have always been procedural. Quantum Leap, Dr. Who, X-Files, Fringe, POI. You know why? Because it mixes the mundane with the awesome. The contrast makes Sci-fi elements much more vivid and gives the ordinary parts a special endearing quality.   Think back to the most recent of them - Fringe. The fifth season was fully serialized and 13 episodes but the general feeling is that although the season was very heavy storywise, the characters all seemed to have lost their charm. You no longer really cared about about their daughter's death, Peter's suicidal revenge or the dystopian future in general because everyone knew the timeline would be reset anyway."
PersonOfInterest,35tesw,man_in_the_suit,-1,Wed May 13 11:50:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, you have a point. It would be much more challenging to write a POI without filler. But I'm sure it's not impossible. Look at Battlestar Galactica. Very little filler and yet they managed 4 seasons of quality storytelling (and no it wasn't perfect but give it a break, it was pretty damn good!). As for needing some grounding in between all the awesome, I think you can accomplish that without filling whole seasons with filler (where basically you have story in the beginning and end of each season, with 1 or 2 story eps in the middle as in POI)."
PersonOfInterest,35tesw,ReDJohN123,3,Wed May 13 11:56:47 2015 UTC,"Dude that's the thing. Most people don't consider those as filler. The showrunners don't consider them filler. Many people enjoy a procedural episode with action, comedy and innovation. Why is that so hard to believe?  Do you think Mulder's paranoia would have such profound effect on american culture if X-files was serialized? No. Without the monster of the week and more importantly the victim of the week format, general people would have had nothing to empathize with.  Similarly the AI war storyline entertains me like nothing else. But the case of the weeks make me think how a Surveilence State might effect me. In this day and age, many can relate more to that."
PersonOfInterest,35tesw,hitmeaxou,0,Wed May 13 12:13:23 2015 UTC,"I think the way they frame it makes it feel worse and more stagnant. To me anyway. The whole ""we have a new number"" ""meet John Johnsson, Mr Reese..""   Like every numbers ep follows a basic script. And then the one-liners dispersed throughout the episode where they literally cut to two people and they say 1 line each (that is usually somewhat meaningless (or overly blunt expose for the viewer) but catchy) and it cuts away.  I don't know. It feels so stiff if that makes sense. On the other hand the story-episodes are great and have awesome flow. Can you fault a man for wanting more of the latter?"
PersonOfInterest,35tesw,man_in_the_suit,1 point,Wed May 13 12:26:08 2015 UTC,If we're going by pure numbers then viewing figures would beg to disagree.
PersonOfInterest,35tesw,hitmeaxou,-1,Wed May 13 11:33:57 2015 UTC,"What figures exactly? Also, I should clarify, I'm talking only about shows that have a story. There are tons of sitcoms or cartoons like the simpsons or what not that have stand-alone eps and are very popular. The difference is they don't have an overarching story. When there is a story you want to see it move forward, not wait for 15 filler eps."
PersonOfInterest,35tesw,mnr5530,2,Wed May 13 11:41:20 2015 UTC,"Most people would agree that shows with somewhat stand-alone episodes are worse than shows where storylines move through several episodes.   Your statement above. NCIS, CSI etc. are all shows with viewing figures that do, or did, dwarf other shows and they rely on the stand-alone episode format instead of a continuing story. NCIS is the most watched programme around the world."
PersonOfInterest,35tesw,hitmeaxou,-1,Wed May 13 11:46:49 2015 UTC,"Like I said in my clarification, talking about shows that have a story. Imagine if Game of Thrones stopped for half a season to follow a few characters cleaning up various crime in King's Landing with stand alone eps. There would be an uproar. When there is no story to begin with, stand-alone eps is a perfectly valid format. When there is a story, stand alone eps are commonly called ""filler""."

PersonOfInterest,35mg7a,pa79,2,Tue May 12 11:33:00 2015 UTC,"Something to pay attention to because CBS only has one open drama spot this year and they already picked up Supergirl. So unless they choose to only go with one new drama (which isn't unheard of, they did it last year) then one show would have to have a shorten season.  Edit: and it appears that that only open slot for a full season drama is 10PM on Sundays. Highly doubtful that a new show would get that slot so a move is something else to pay attention to."
PersonOfInterest,35mg7a,HeadleysHobos,2,Mon May 11 19:20:47 2015 UTC,There's some thought they may move around the reality shows or have shorter stretches with them to make room for the scripted programming.
PersonOfInterest,35mg7a,DesertedPenguin,10,Mon May 11 19:33:56 2015 UTC,Tvbythenumbers saying it could be the final season :-(
PersonOfInterest,35mg7a,ChicagoIce,38,Mon May 11 18:42:51 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with it being the final season as long as the writers are aware of that and approach the season as such. No fillers, just 22 or 23 stellar episodes to wrap up the series.   My concern, however, is Shaw. Will Sarah Shahi be ready to come back by the middle of season 5 so that Shaw's story could be dealt with?   Edit: We're getting a shortened 13-episode season. Which probably means that this is the last season. Which means that there is definitely not enough time to wrap things up properly. Shahi most likely will not be able to return that quickly, and they won't be able to explore what happened to Shaw. DAMNIT CBS. I hope Jonah can find a new home for the show so that we can get a sixth season."
PersonOfInterest,35mg7a,ariyahvansh,14,Mon May 11 18:54:28 2015 UTC,Hopefully she can maybe do at least one episode since it would really suck for Shaw's story to end off-screen.
PersonOfInterest,35mg7a,Jono-Tron,3,Mon May 11 19:00:16 2015 UTC,No fillers   I don't know how they would introduce season 5 filler as the machine can't really give them new numbers now.
PersonOfInterest,35mg7a,Kebble,1 point,Mon May 11 22:05:17 2015 UTC,"They actually have something on that matter. From the interview:  We imagine if the Machine knew its demise was imminent, it may have  also known of a number of premeditated murders and plotted — before  it was compressed into a Kevlar case — to let our guys know that there  are some people they should keep an eye on until the Machine is able  to regain some of its faculties."

PersonOfInterest,35mg7a,DarthTigris,7,Mon May 11 19:55:13 2015 UTC,"Shaw was written out temporarily because the actress who portrays her, Sarah Shahi, was pregnant. She just gave birth to her twins in early March. Jonah and Greg have said that they already have an arc planned out for Shaw; it's just a matter of when Shahi is ready to return. So if this is indeed the show's last season, then I am concerned that there won't be enough time to explore Shaw's story because Shahi might not be able to come back so soon."
PersonOfInterest,35mg7a,ariyahvansh,3,Mon May 11 19:47:49 2015 UTC,"When I heard the news that she was going to be out for two years, I was a bit worried. I'd heard a while back that the writers/producers had planned for five seasons (and the trajectory of the show seems suited to end on a high note within a year or, possibly, two, although I worry that they might be stretching things if so). Unless the show manages to stay on for at least a sixth season, and that sixth season isn't watered down or getting stale, then I don't know what they're going to do about Shaw."

They could sandwich POI with Supergirl (new superhero show) and Limitless (new sci-fi show). Mix in Blue Bloods in there somewhere, too, if Supergirl or Limitless start off as 13-episode series.  Then have 3 reality shows on Wednesdays at 8pm at different times of the year: Survivor, then Undercover Boss, then The Amazing Race. Hawaii 5-0 moves to Sundays at 8. Blue Bloods"
PersonOfInterest,35mg7a,DesertedPenguin,2,Mon May 11 19:47:50 2015 UTC,Sunday nights seems like night CBS just puts the shows on that already have fans and are already in syndication. So need for new eyes. I would think it either stays on Tuesday where it's at or moves to Fridays. Another night that seems to be for long running shows that already have syndication.
PersonOfInterest,35mg7a,rflairfan1,2,Mon May 11 19:53:20 2015 UTC,Sunday night is the night shows go to die on CBS.
PersonOfInterest,35mg7a,man_in_the_suit,1 point,Mon May 11 20:51:30 2015 UTC,I could totally go for a Genre Friday / SciFriday. Or we could have an epic rap battle of history and put it up against Whedon and Agents of Shield on Wednesday. lol
PersonOfInterest,35mg7a,shinsaikou,-2,Tue May 12 18:44:54 2015 UTC,"They could sandwich POI with Supergirl   I've heard rumor Supergirl is setup to cross-over with the CW shows, but given that POI is a WB show I wouldn't be broken up with it crossed over with POI. Maybe The Machine and Kara Zor-El team up to fight Samaritan."
PersonOfInterest,35mg7a,turbov21,3,Mon May 11 20:44:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think there has to be any actual interaction with the shows. Just saying they might work well together on the same night.  I mentioned this elsewhere in the sub, but Friday as 'genre' night has kind of come back. NBC did it with Grimm, a supernatural series, when it piggybacked the show off of Chuck and had it lead into Dateline on Friday nights.  It was also used to help launch Hannibal (successfully) and Constantine (unsuccessfully).  I know Blue Bloods and Hawaii 5-0 are fairly entrenched on Fridays, but if CBS wanted, they could have POI center a ""genre"" night with Supergirl at 8, POI at 9, and the new sci-fi show Limitless at 10.  Then again, I could also see POI just joining Blue Bloods and Hawaii 5-0, since all 3 have some crime drama elements to them"

PersonOfInterest,35mg7a,SavannahNix,20,Mon May 11 21:14:50 2015 UTC,"Unpopular opinion, but I kind of hope this season is the last. To me, no enemy will quite match up with Samaritan in terms of size, and it'd be silly to stretch out the plot for another two seasons. I'm very happy with the trajectory of the show thus far and think it could end very well with just 22 more episodes."
PersonOfInterest,35mg7a,rap_mein,6,Mon May 11 20:23:58 2015 UTC,"I think they could do two more seasons tbh. But I also think finishing on 5 works. I've always said since season 1, I'd rather this was a 5 season show than an 8 season show."
PersonOfInterest,35mg7a,man_in_the_suit,3,Mon May 11 20:46:29 2015 UTC,"It depends.  The Dominic and Elias storyline from last season hinted that they were going back to their roots, which would have been great and they could have continued for a while.  Unfortunately, they seem to be getting bogged down with the Samaritan storyline, which is very interesting, but seems to have nuked the shows previous style.  I'm not sure how they can get it back without making it seem very anticlimactic, but I am willing to be proven wrong."
PersonOfInterest,35mg7a,Podspi,3,Mon May 11 22:55:35 2015 UTC,"I hope it's the last season, too. I remember reading something from the writers and producers a couple years back saying they had five seasons worth of story. I wouldn't want to see the story become anticlimactic and watered down. As it is, each season has escalated wonderfully. I don't know how a post-Samaritan show could seem as intense."
PersonOfInterest,35mg7a,thektulu7,2,Tue May 12 00:44:47 2015 UTC,"I'd say 1-2 more seasons is fair enough.  The show could go on infinitely but ultimately what would end up happening is a perpetual deadlock between Samaritan and Team Machine where they keep trading ground but never take each other out.  At this point I'm hard-pressed to see how Samaritan can be stopped. Even if they do go that route and somehow save the world from Samaritan, what next? There's no logical place to go after that unless they go back to the ""criminal/victim of the week"" formula."
PersonOfInterest,35mg7a,baultista,1 point,Tue May 12 13:40:46 2015 UTC,"I have an enemy that will match up with Samaritan: Either: a rogue machine and its paid mercenary forces, or the U.S Government."

And although the reasons are never fully explained (and don't really make sense) - the sense I get on the show is that Samaritan is superior to the machine (in the same way that Dominic was superior to Elias)."
PersonOfInterest,35mg7a,Podspi,1 point,Mon May 11 22:51:21 2015 UTC,"There was one episode where they described Samaritan as a sword to The Machine being a shield - Samaritan is aggressive in trying to accomplish its tasks, while The Machine was designed to be reluctant to get involved."

PersonOfInterest,35mg7a,syqcon95,1 point,Tue May 12 01:37:41 2015 UTC,I think they could do 13 episodes for both Season 5 and 6 and make it work if the network would be willing to allow them to do so.

The fifth season has to end the Samaritan plotline. If it's also the final season, then it can give characters proper endings. If there are to be more seasons, then they could once again change the show's style somewhat and go with another large storyline."
PersonOfInterest,35mg7a,CreepyOctopus,2,Mon May 11 20:39:04 2015 UTC,I would be happy with 5 seasons as well. The Samaritan storyline may outlive its welcome if it's drawn out another season and what can really top it as BBE(G)?

PersonOfInterest,35pbed,Rationalspace787,7,Tue May 12 12:16:00 2015 UTC,"I have given this thought, in fact. But anything that makes Season 5 be the last seaso is bad in my book"
PersonOfInterest,35pbed,your_mind_aches,10,Tue May 12 12:35:37 2015 UTC,"A 13 episode season with as many seasons as it takes is what I am also hoping. A 13 episode final season already now – that’s not gonna cut it.  BTW it's not guaranteed that they'll go fully serialized now (though if that's the swan song they better). Before the 13 episode announcement I was 100% sure they’d find a way to receive numbers or help “irrelevants” along the way.   Several possibilities for that: a)  the Machine has set up a automated monitoring system to gather and forward that intel independently (probably not very likely, since that would maybe imply that the little system is a little AI); b) they meet people in need (a classic); or c) they find a backlog of numbers that the Machine predicted will be escalate at some specific point (perhaps the likeliest) and probably some other possibilities."
PersonOfInterest,35pbed,eikeegimuu,6,Tue May 12 12:59:12 2015 UTC,"Well it depends how long the Machine is out of action. As to whether or not they could return to there procedural status.  It's not like there aren't character in the world that could bring them cases.  Episode 1 (Aftermath of finale)  Episode 2 3 and 6 heck, Fusco and Reese are still cops. They can work standard homicide cases. (maybe something tied to numbers of people that Samaritan failed to kill)  Episode 4 Zoe Morgan could provide high end corporate cases.  Episode 5 Caleb has something going on with Project X.  By episode 7 you plug the machine back in and you have numbers again.    Also do not expect full serialization. Networks don't allow that even when it would make complete sense to do so. Because they still need to make ad money. And if the serialization tanks the numbers even more. Then they end up having to pull it from the schedule because they could air a re-run of NCIS and make more profit and if they air a failing show.  Smallville got renewed for a final season. Supposed to be about getting him to actually be superman. Was a good opportunity to tell a great worthwhile story that actually justified his ascension to superman. Didn't even need to be heavily serialized to do so. Just more than usual. Especially with the villain they picked  Nope same old shit as the last 4 tired seasons."

PersonOfInterest,35pbed,smooth_randy,3,Mon May 25 16:31:13 2015 UTC,So.... the 13 episodes has been confirmed then? Last I heard it was just an unfounded rumor.
PersonOfInterest,35pbed,UltraChip,1 point,Tue May 12 17:34:43 2015 UTC,"Not confirmed, but I'm going on the assumption that POI is only getting the 13 episode order.  If that's false, I'll be thrilled!"
PersonOfInterest,35pbed,TheOvarianBarbarian,2,Tue May 12 20:26:54 2015 UTC,"Look, I don't want to be the barer of bad news but I spend a lot of time researching and following the network TV industry and getting 13 episodes after usually getting 22 is a bad sign. First and foremost TV is a business and that business it to make money. Quality is just a byproduct of how much money a show will earn the network in the long run i.e. More people watch higher quality shows so they make more money for the network so the run longer.   Basic TV knowledge 101, the goal of all TV shows, from the Networks perspective, is to reach syndication. Syndication is when a show has enough episodes that they can be sold to other Networks and local affiliates to run uninterrupted. In the old days this has been 100 episodes however now-a-days the standard is 4 seasons or 88 episodes. The problem with POI is that the show is not produced by CBS, it is produced by Warner Brothers. This means that once the show reaches syndication (and it has with the conclusion of Season 4), Warner Brothers will get the syndication money not CBS. CBS will just get ad revenue based on the shows live episode ratings and while POI's ratings are not bad they aren't high enough for CBS to make whatever their goal they set for ad revenue since they won't see any syndication money.   What likely happened is that CBS wanted Season 4 to be the last. It has reached syndication, and is not their show, so just get rid of it. However, WB wanted to reach 100 episodes so they had to forge some deal with CBS to keep the show. And they both decided on 13 episodes. Now they could have reached this deal in any number of ways but the usual way is a reduction of costs either by cutting secondary actors or reducing set costs, ect. The specifics will most likely never be known. This explains why CBS was late to release their renewals yesterday, because they were hammering out a deal with WB. The same thing happened last year with The Mentalist. It was a WB owned show, had just reached syndication, and WB wanted to get to 100 so they delayed the renewal announcements making a deal and got it a 13 episode final season.   It sucks but it is just a business decision. The good news is that now the writers know that this is the final season so they can write for it and produce a kickass final season with hopefully no cliffhanger."
PersonOfInterest,35pbed,retolx,1 point,Tue May 12 20:58:58 2015 UTC,"I think you could be right. Also problem with PoI, especially in 4th season, was how scattered it was throughout the season. Combined that it's no longer ""case of a week"" format, it was hurting it, badly - especially for broadcast. I think with 13 episodes it could do a lot better if they pace it right."
PersonOfInterest,35qk4p,Darkprime,3,Tue May 12 18:13:29 2015 UTC,"ABC, Fox and NBC won't take it because they'd face the same problem as CBS: They don't own the show. So it's not as lucrative for them. Warner Bros. owns the show, so they get all the syndication money. All the network gets is ad revenue, and a show like POI isn't crushing it in ad revenue.  Same deal for a premium cable network like Starz, HBO or Showtime. They have limited hours for original series programming. Why would they burn it on something they didn't develop?  Out of the streaming scenarios, Netflix is the most likely since that contract (finally) starts this fall. POI isn't available on Hulu so it's not likely to suddenly be picked up there. Amazon is a possibility.  TNT is the most likely basic cable destination.  I still think it's going to be none of the above. It's going to be Season 5 and that's it."
PersonOfInterest,35qk4p,DesertedPenguin,3,Tue May 12 18:43:12 2015 UTC,Agree with everything you just said. Mostly because we talked about this the other day. LOL.    The only other option I could see is WGN. They have exclusive rights to POI that starts in the fall. But they are still a long shot. I think this is the end and I am okay with that.
PersonOfInterest,35qk4p,rflairfan1,1 point,Tue May 12 18:50:14 2015 UTC,I keep forgetting about WGN! I'm just not used to them being a factor. They always used to get second rate syndication stuff.

PersonOfInterest,35psqx,Jooey_K,6,Tue May 12 14:50:09 2015 UTC,"POI already has a syndication deal, and yeah it's 88 episodes not 100.  But, even still, CBS is not interested in POI's syndication because the show is produced by Warner Bros., it's not a CBS production so they won't be making any money from syndication. That's why they don't care if this is its final season; they only make money from the advertising $, but now that the ratings have gone to shit, ad money is going to be WAY less and they could easily replace the show with another CBS-produced show even if the ratings are similar because they'll be making all the profits from it. And even though it's a critically acclaimed show, it's not getting any awards recognition like ""The Good Wife"" so yeah, this could be very well be its final season and CBS won't even bat an eyelid."

This would explain why a syndication deal already exists with WGN. They were on track to exceed 88 episodes this year. I'd never heard of this til recently, but the 88 number makes sense if most ""good"" network shows run for at least 4 seasons of 22 episodes (or more)."

I just recall reading in a number of places that 100 was the 'magic' number.  Also, I wasn't aware of the syndication deal with WGN.   Although, with shows like this (LOST, Once Upon A Time - anything with a long term story), I don't see how syndication works, as out of context a lot of things don't make sense.

PersonOfInterest,35mg72,hankjmoody,0,Tue May 12 05:53:15 2015 UTC,i hope there will be at least six seasons... in the end of fifth season showing evil shaw... sixth season will be to get shaw back _
PersonOfInterest,35mg72,hitmeaxou,2,Mon May 11 19:29:08 2015 UTC,It doesn't say it isn't a full season so I am going to assume it will be. Also should have date and time this week as well. So excited.
PersonOfInterest,35mg72,man_in_the_suit,2,Mon May 11 18:43:29 2015 UTC,"I suspect it will be. CBS lives and breathes procedural dramas. Besides, they've got a pretty solid lineup on Tuesdays thanks to the NCIS duo and PoS."
PersonOfInterest,35mg72,hitmeaxou,2,Mon May 11 19:17:44 2015 UTC,what is a 13 episode mean???? does this mean poi is getting over by dec 15?
PersonOfInterest,35mg72,man_in_the_suit,2,Tue May 12 05:52:12 2015 UTC,It may not even start until Jan.
PersonOfInterest,35mg72,frowawayduh,2,Tue May 12 07:50:28 2015 UTC,jesus...you mean jan - may 2016
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,rflairfan1,15,Mon May 11 23:09:17 2015 UTC,"Goddamnit. A shortened final season would definitely not give them time to explore what happened to Shaw. Please Netflix...please pick up the show after CBS drops it so that it could have another shortened season to wrap things up properly.   Fucking hell, CBS."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,ariyahvansh,4,Mon May 11 23:47:05 2015 UTC,"This is the worst thing about this news honestly.   If they told us we were getting two 13 episode seasons, I'd be more hopeful."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,BrittBratBrute,7,Tue May 12 00:10:33 2015 UTC,From what I have read WB pretty much had to beg CBS to renew them. Saw it from a couple of different places now. We were very close to cancellation.
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,BrittBratBrute,3,Mon May 11 23:48:12 2015 UTC,This whole thing is insane considering how sure everyone was that we were getting a regular renewal. Now it turns out this show was the reason for CBS' delay of their full renewal/cancellation announcements.
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,BrittBratBrute,5,Tue May 12 00:11:36 2015 UTC,While everyone agreed it was getting renewed. I never saw anyone as far as TV insiders say it was going to be 22 or 13 episodes.
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,soren121,1 point,Tue May 12 00:17:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I guess I just assumed. I haven't seen too many shows on network tv get a short season like this. Maybe I haven't been paying enough attention, or MAYBE I was just being delusional."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,BrittBratBrute,2,Tue May 12 00:23:33 2015 UTC,No one had any suspicions until CBS delayed the announcement.
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,Trueogre,2,Tue May 12 01:05:17 2015 UTC,"Even then I didn't think they would do this. I just assumed maybe it was some other show that was holding things up, like freaking Hawaii 5-0"
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,soren121,1 point,Tue May 12 01:11:13 2015 UTC,"I don't get it though doesn't Warners have it's own channel?  CW?  Why can't they just move the show there?  I'm not moaning at the 13 episodes, I mean at least we're getting a season 5 that's the main thing.  And lets face it some of those episodes are just fillers for the actualy stuff so hopefully having 13 will be just right."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,Sempere,3,Tue May 12 00:28:29 2015 UTC,"The CW has a packed schedule already, since they only program 2 hours of primetime vs. the 3 hours that the Big Four have. They literally cannot pickup any more shows."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,g8rs18,2,Tue May 12 01:06:29 2015 UTC,"It really doesn't fit into CW though. Vampires, Comic book shows are what works there."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,Sempere,2,Tue May 12 00:37:04 2015 UTC,"Person of Interest is essentially a real world version of Batman the Animated Series (in terms of humor and very, very tangentially occasional character traits) and Nolan's Dark Knight series. I think it might actually work well there."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,DesertedPenguin,2,Tue May 12 11:59:55 2015 UTC,"I agree. And while the ratings this season weren't up to ""America's most watched network"" standards, wouldn't the ratings blow anything currently on the CW out of the water?"
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,DesertedPenguin,2,Tue May 12 15:25:23 2015 UTC,"Thing is, compared to other shows considered ""hits"" on other networks POI has been doing quite solid. Definitely out drew Scandal recently."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,DesertedPenguin,12,Tue May 12 15:41:02 2015 UTC,"Well, this is the end of the road then. A 13-episode season is definitely the last, at least on CBS."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,rivensky,11,Mon May 11 23:19:33 2015 UTC,You gotta wonder if they will write a series finale for the entire show or write a finale for CBS and see about someone else picking it up.
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,rivensky,13,Mon May 11 23:23:13 2015 UTC,"Hell, with Warner Bros. and Nolan behind it, write a ""finale"" for CBS and then convince brother Chris to sign on to direct a feature to finish off the story. Caviezel and Emerson are big enough names to lead a movie.  Christopher Nolan's upcoming projects list on IMDB is suspiciously empty, too. Maybe it's already in the works.*  I'm not confident about another network picking it up. It's not really a fit for The CW, which Warner owns with CBS. The dramas there tend to be marketed more towards a younger audience, and while it'd be great for the nation's youth to jump onto POI, they haven't done it on CBS...  As far as other Time Warner properties, HBO isn't a match. Neither is TBS, which is comedy oriented. Maybe TNT? They supposedly know drama, after all.  Warner doesn't seem to have much of a relationship with SyFy or USA, which are the only other two homes I can think of that would be remote possibilities. It's probably too expensive of a production for them, either way. Which makes TNT a more a logical choice, since it would be on an in-house channel for Warner.  *I'm sure he's actually quite busy with projects that haven't officially been pushed into development, too. Or producing other projects."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,HeadleysHobos,11,Mon May 11 23:50:54 2015 UTC,"I really don't see any TV network/cable picking it up really. I think Netflix would be the best shot, they have streaming rights to it already so there is a relationship there. WGN also has cable streaming rights and they have gotten into the TV game."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,DesertedPenguin,8,Mon May 11 23:55:23 2015 UTC,"WGN could be the wild card, for sure.   A move to Netflix would finally convince me to get a subscription, that's for sure.  But honestly, I think if Nolan and Plageman feel they can wrap the story up in a satisfying way in 13 episodes, they'll do that and that will be all. Nolan has other projects he can turn to, and Plageman's a pretty successful dude. So I'm sort of resigning myself to that fate.   If they want to push it further, though, I'm on board. I'll follow this show wherever it may go."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,fsutouchdown,1 point,Mon May 11 23:58:00 2015 UTC,"I think Netflix would be the best shot, they have streaming rights to it already so there is a relationship there.   Is this a future deal or is it just a particular country right now? It's not available to stream on Netflix in the US currently."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,DesertedPenguin,1 point,Tue May 12 01:32:09 2015 UTC,It starts in the fall on Netflix as well as WGN.
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,fsutouchdown,1 point,Tue May 12 01:34:05 2015 UTC,Nice!
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,DesertedPenguin,1 point,Tue May 12 01:46:45 2015 UTC,"TNT is probably the most logical choice but they'd likely have to cut costs by quite a bit. I just hope we get a true ending. It'd be a shame if they left it open because they thought they could get picked up somewhere else, only to never have that happen."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,shinsaikou,1 point,Tue May 12 00:07:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think they'll do that. I would imagine Warner will spend the next couple months testing the waters and determining how feasible a potential move is while Nolan and Co. come up with how to finish off the series.   Nolan has said several times they already know how it will all end. So if it sounds like the show isn't moving anywhere, they'll just have to get to that point and not worry about actually having an ending."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,shinsaikou,1 point,Tue May 12 00:12:03 2015 UTC,"What about Showtime? And out of curiosity, why HBO isn't a match?"
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,svrtngr,3,Tue May 12 03:51:17 2015 UTC,"The show doesn't have a large enough 18-49 audience to become part of a premium cable network like Showtime or HBO.  To give you an idea, Person of Interest had a 1.1 rating for the series finale. Game of Thrones, HBO's current moneymaker, had a 3.5 rating in the overnight and a 4.7 rating in the +7 days rating (DVR watchers).   POI, as much as I love it, just doesn't have the pull among the right people and doesn't bring ad dollars with it. So it's not a good bet for a premium cable series. Those networks have limited air slots available for original programming. They're not going to burn one of those slots on a rescued program.  That's why it makes the most sense to land on a Time Warner owned channel (TNT), a streaming service (Netflix) or on WGN (which bought the syndication rights). But I still think that they'll just wrap it after this year."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,DesertedPenguin,2,Tue May 12 04:35:31 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation！From what I've read in other interviews, I think Nolan & co. have a clear idea of how to finish off the show, and they might knew about this coming.  This is what they said last month:   Obviously there hasn't been a Season 5 renewal yet. Does the finale wrap things up, or are you setting up the next chapter? Plageman: Quite a few doors are slammed, but a couple of windows open too. Nolan: I'm going to keep telling this fu---ing story. We've got lots more story to tell and we're very hopeful that we will be continuing to tell it on CBS next year. But there is definitely more story to tell in this world.   link here"
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,your_mind_aches,2,Tue May 12 05:24:32 2015 UTC,"I think the 13-episode order might catch them a little off guard, but they certainly expected to be back. Nolan is a creative dude. I'm sure he'd come up with stories for many more seasons.  The question will be: Are 13 episodes enough to satisfyingly guide the story to the ending that he's known PoI will have from the beginning?  If yes, then I doubt they push for the series to live on elsewhere. And if the answer is no, but another home isn't an option, then I would imagine a lot of sleepless nights are ahead for the writing staff as they try to draw up a satisfying conclusion.  But I feel confident Nolan will take us where the story is supposed to go."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,your_mind_aches,3,Tue May 12 05:57:51 2015 UTC,"If this were ABC, I'd expect this show might go the LOST route. I think the only other option would be, like say, Netflix. WB probably had to pull a lot of strings to get CBS to allow them to push PoI over the magic syndication number of 100 episodes."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,Viper_H,2,Mon May 11 23:33:21 2015 UTC,They have enough episode now for syndication as you only need 88 now. But the more episode the more money. I also think it won't air till 2016 now.
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,your_mind_aches,3,Mon May 11 23:35:20 2015 UTC,"That is definitely even more depressing. It's depressing that the doomsayers were right. I am hopeful that even if this is not announced as the final season in the near future, that they play it like it is. Because we live in uncertain times. And this show deserves a planned ending, not a cliffhang into nothingness."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,BrittBratBrute,3,Mon May 11 23:48:51 2015 UTC,It's important to note that this means it may not start until 2016 (like most mid-season shows) or end by the end of 2015. (see: Fringe) Pushing a 13 episode season over the normal season length is painful.  It's also POSSIBLE but unlikely that they worked something out so it'll run like LOST so they can finish their story on shortened seasons to max out the length of time it runs.
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,SavannahNix,3,Mon May 11 23:33:07 2015 UTC,"I think it's most likely that CBS will run it on Tuesdays in the fall, with a finale on December 8 or 15 (depending on when the season premiere is).  Then they'll hand the reigns to one of their new shows for 2016."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,BrittBratBrute,2,Mon May 11 23:54:41 2015 UTC,Aaaand I'm pissed
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,MrPotatoButt,4,Tue May 12 00:00:50 2015 UTC,"Why? I mean it sucks to see the show on the way out, but I honestly expected S5 to be the end anyways."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,SavannahNix,4,Tue May 12 00:39:48 2015 UTC,but 13 episodes
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,skerit,1 point,Tue May 12 01:57:47 2015 UTC,"Hopefully that means more of the episodes focus on the mythology of the show, instead of filler numbers of the week."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,shinsaikou,1 point,Tue May 12 08:53:10 2015 UTC,A 22 episode season could have done that perfectly. See Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Season 2.
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,Pascalwb,21,Tue May 12 12:41:52 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm being a huge baby here, but I am BEYOND UPSET.  I don't feel like 13 episodes is enough to tie everything up. Everything is going to be so rushed!  Will Sarah even come back in time?   How could CBS give full orders to garbage like CSI: Cyber? I'm in complete disbelief.  Worst part out of all this is actually that this show has been my main source of happiness for a long time now and I feel like that is being taken away from me."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,g8rs18,4,Tue May 12 00:08:31 2015 UTC,"I am upset too, because it means the network didn't really want to renew it. Plus, I fear that even less character interaction will take place if there are only have 13 episodes. I am tired of seeing Finch and Reese being passive, Root making all the decisions (not that she isn't a great character) instead of Finch, and the relationship I started watching for being mostly gone from the show. Dammit!"
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,ChicagoIce,1 point,Tue May 12 01:05:14 2015 UTC,"Exactly how I feel! Where is there going to be room for some background on Root now? They said they really wanted to do some Root flashbacks this season. I NEED Sarah to come back. I want some resolution to Shoot! I just need more character interaction in general.   Now I feel like the entire show is going to be rushed to hell, and the majority of Team Machine is going to be killed for the sake of rebuilding The Machine or something. I'm too worried."

PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,ChicagoIce,10,Tue May 12 01:20:32 2015 UTC,"Or the ""Fringe"" or ""Chuck"" treatment. I'm quite happy with these kind of deals, it's a lot better than just vanishing of the air with no closure.  I really hope they go the ""Fringe"" route and give us 13 episodes of highly serialized Samaritan/Machine drama, no fillers."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,SafferCrystal,4,Mon May 11 23:18:26 2015 UTC,Honestly I am pretty happy about this. This show is really built to be a 13 episode season.
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,your_mind_aches,6,Mon May 11 23:21:35 2015 UTC,"With how tight the arc is as of now, this is true."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,your_mind_aches,1 point,Mon May 11 23:24:30 2015 UTC,"Well we already kind of had 2 seasons in 1 season. Mid season finales were pretty great, so it definitely loss for us."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,your_mind_aches,2,Tue May 12 11:53:40 2015 UTC,"Well, Fringe S5 was glorified fan service. It was a thank you to the fans for supporting it for so long. It gave them a chance to tie up the loose ends and provide closure when the end of S4 was the end of the ""real"" show. It's not really the same thing as POI, a show that was never in danger of cancellation until apparently a couple of weeks ago.   But yes, I expect S5 of POI to be all killer, no filler. It's (hopefully) going to be great because there's a LOT of things still to be resolved."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,Syokhan,7,Tue May 12 00:43:02 2015 UTC,I'm seriously devastated by this news. Please don't start shooting until Shahi can come back!
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,your_mind_aches,4,Mon May 11 23:46:03 2015 UTC,"To me, this is what I'm most upset about. I'd hate for Shaw to never come back because the show was axed."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,atomiczap,5,Tue May 12 00:40:46 2015 UTC,"Fuck this is not good, but it would have been awful if CBS cancelled it. Seriously, CSI:Cyber gets a whole season? That show is shit. Awful, horrible.   Hey when they bring the show back in 30 years maybe we will get the proper number of episodes."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,Rover16,9,Tue May 12 00:22:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the fact that POI is produced by Warner Bros. (and not in-house by CBS) is probably playing a bigger factor here. CBS is more willing to stick with in-house shows rather than split the share of the pie with anyone else."
PersonOfInterest,35nh0r,HeadleysHobos,9,Tue May 12 00:33:40 2015 UTC,And that idiotic Scorpion? God.

Honestly, the worst aspect of POI is the long seasons. The number of the week have gotten very boring, they have really played out every unique twist they can. The serialized plot is what makes POI great - not just good, but a truly great show. I would hope to see a more focused show on the serialized story. I feel like it would be really hard to go back to an episodic series where the finale left us anyway."

PersonOfInterest,35od5v,KayJay24,3,Tue May 12 04:40:25 2015 UTC,"Probably not. CBS didn't have room in the schedule for all of its dramas to have 22-episode seasons, and I bet that's one reason why it only got 13 episodes."

PersonOfInterest,35ok4q,hitmeaxou,8,Tue May 12 05:57:56 2015 UTC,"Anybody saying the reason it's 13 episodes is due to content is misinformed. CBS' only income from this show is ad revenue, they don't see a dime from syndication which is a lot of money. WB gets that so CBS will keep renewing until the ratings aren't NCIS level. Which is now. The ratings are good but not the best one the network. Since CBS and WB are partners and own CW I doubt they shunt WB out of the 100 episode mark syndication (it's 88 now but 100 is better). The show is on its 90th (?) episode now so 13 more put it over the line."
PersonOfInterest,35ok4q,Sabeckaz,6,Tue May 12 06:16:38 2015 UTC,"so let me understand. you are saying - cbs does not make money from syndication rights which go to warner brothers, while hawaii five o earns cbs money from syndication and ad revenue. so cbs will substitute poi with its own produced show which will earn both syndication and ad revenue.  which means money over quality? and can poi find a new channel? i tot a scripted show cannot find a new channel....so curtains for poi?"
PersonOfInterest,35ok4q,Sabeckaz,3,Tue May 12 06:36:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, one good thing about this is that POI could find another network. However I'm banking on Netflix if WB can fix their relationship with that business (they don't like putting their shows on there)"
PersonOfInterest,35ok4q,shinsaikou,2,Tue May 12 06:49:59 2015 UTC,"I have doubts about that. More likely would be moving it to one of WB's own networks. TNT being the most likely, though that would require a budget cut. The CW is another option, but their target demo is much different. The CW has been trying to branch out into new territory, however. With Arrow very much in the dark and gritty style of the other Nolan's Batman trilogy, maybe CW would have interest if Jonah pitched the idea of taking the show in the AI apocalypse direction. It cannot be denied that the show is already heading in that direction. Shows jumping networks is still a rare thing. I can only think of a few in recent memory that have done it."
PersonOfInterest,35ok4q,shinsaikou,1 point,Tue May 12 15:30:13 2015 UTC,Please no The CW they ruin their show with annoying teen romances
PersonOfInterest,35ok4q,Darkprime,1 point,Tue May 12 18:43:21 2015 UTC,"The CW could forseeably create a day of programming aimed at a different demo. Bring back The Mentalist and toss in a pilot for something else which would appeal to an older audience.   The CW pushed for a stronger female demo in the past. Shows like Arrow, The Flash, and the forthcoming 2nd DC spinoff have been their attempt to broaden their horizons. Whether or not they are still homing in on the High School / University demo is not something I can say with certainty, I just know that grown men review these shows - the same people reviewing shows like Game of Thrones, House of Cards, The Americans, and The Walking Dead."
PersonOfInterest,35ok4q,Sabeckaz,1 point,Wed May 13 01:51:06 2015 UTC,I could see amazon picking it up. they seem to have a good relationship with WB with amazon prime and all.
PersonOfInterest,35ok4q,john_gilpin,1 point,Tue May 12 18:11:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've seen a few people mention that, although when I mentioned Netflix I was spitballing a bit. I wouldn't know who would be most suitable for the show really."
PersonOfInterest,35ok4q,eikeegimuu,-7,Tue May 12 20:18:36 2015 UTC,Whoa! Once again - at the end of the day it is all about superb quality. POI had that quality - so despite being a WB production - it was a gold mine in terms of ad revenue alone and was a ratings success but today POI has declined badly in quality and ratings and no longer worth it for CBS so they decided on a 13 season hawk.  The show will end by Dec 15.
PersonOfInterest,35ok4q,ElderBuu,2,Tue May 12 06:41:27 2015 UTC,"A stray but optimistic (!) thought is that Nolan & co wanted to have a shortened season if the deal included also next season's order. From what I’ve read they’ve felt that 23 episodes a season is too much and they can manage 22 without compromising too much. So maybe less episodes per season would be desirable for them also if they can get away with that and if that’s not the final season.  Then again they’ve also stated that they like the format of having arc driven stories and more standalones in between, kinda like taking best of both worlds, so they probably wouldn’t have argued for a 13 episodes of serialized only – or even worse 13 episodes of serialized and standalones combined."
PersonOfInterest,35ok4q,eikeegimuu,2,Tue May 12 06:51:14 2015 UTC,"I dont mind less episodes per season as long as POI is not forced to go into sudden final season, and let it run its length that the makers have in mind. I Will absolutely not mind more seasons over more episodes per season. I was frustrated anyway, in this 2015 there has been so many long breaks between episodes."
PersonOfInterest,35ok4q,shinsaikou,1 point,Tue May 12 12:07:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, I would also be happy with POI having 13 episodes per season but only if has many seasons as the makers have in mind. That would allow for a tighter seasons and a satisfying conclusion. Considering talk about even a 6th season the makers sure don't envision a shortened 5th season as the end point."
PersonOfInterest,35ok4q,svrtngr,2,Tue May 12 12:38:06 2015 UTC,"I'm hopeful for this as well. Lost's 4th, 5th, and 6th seasons were 14, 17, and 18 episodes, respectively. Granted, if you believe IMDB, ABC had wanted those to be full seasons but the writers did not believe they had enough material - therefore the short season compromise was made."
PersonOfInterest,35ok4q,ariyahvansh,2,Tue May 12 15:54:12 2015 UTC,"Before we know more, there are a few possibilities.  The most optimistic is Nolan & co pulled a LOST. (They wanted to end the run and have [x] episodes left to do so. Instead of putting it all into one season to extend the life of the show, they split it into two.)  The second, and more likely is that the 13 episode season is to put it over the 100 episode marker for syndication. It's the same treatment FRINGE got. Ratings weren't good, but they renewed it one final time to get syndication money."
PersonOfInterest,35ok4q,DesertedPenguin,1 point,Tue May 12 13:25:34 2015 UTC,The difference is that POI is owned by WB whereas H50 is owned by CBS. So CBS can make more money off of H50 despite its bad ratings than POI. This post explains it in more detail.
PersonOfInterest,35ok4q,rflairfan1,2,Tue May 12 06:13:29 2015 UTC,"so all about money....maybe practical but sucks. can poi be broadcast by abc, nbc, cw or fox. also doesnt warner bros own their own tv channel- wb channel?"

PersonOfInterest,35ok4q,MCAsomm,-6,Tue May 12 16:57:51 2015 UTC,Too Morose and Gloomy. Thats why 13 episodes. Major rule - TV Drama is not an Academy Award Nominated Cry Baby Movie. You need to have adrenalin and you need to have major MOJO. I warned that this may happen. Get the machine victories and you will see ratings shoot up. Keep up this nonsense of running and squealing from Samaritan and you will see the end in half a season.
PersonOfInterest,35ok4q,Anti_pasto,6,Tue May 12 06:00:00 2015 UTC,but what is the difference between poi and five - 0 please?  so according to you there can be no 'defeat' for the heroes in a tv drama. it would be ridiculous to keep on winning time and time again. i for one would find it weird that reese would keep kicking ass in every episode... even comics dont do that.  and i thought you were actually making sense...

PersonOfInterest,35nz9i,Gouldde,1 point,Tue May 12 07:26:53 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen discussed elsewhere in this subreddit, the problem is that Person of Interest is owned by Warner Bros. Television.  This means that CBS only gets money from ad revenue.  Any syndication money goes to WB, along with other revenue sources.  Ratings are extremely important for these kinds of shows, since the networks cannot recoup costs like they can when they own the shows outright.    Ratings weren't necessarily bad, but they weren't good enough for CBS."

PersonOfInterest,35mg7c,Trueogre,3,Mon May 11 19:50:49 2015 UTC,Their covers haven't been blown so they can still walk around.  However I'm not sure how Root's would work since she had to change hers all the time and this time the Machine isn't there to assist her.  Would be interesting to see how her character turns out without the Machine and whether or not we'll see her hacker side again.
PersonOfInterest,35mg7c,naeads,2,Mon May 11 20:04:44 2015 UTC,That was a good read. Many thanks.
PersonOfInterest,35mg7c,DesertedPenguin,3,Tue May 12 06:29:11 2015 UTC,"Their covers aren't blown, but they are certainly in jeopardy of being spotted by Samaritan's human allies. So while Team Machine has to rebuild, they'll have to be smart about their actions or risk being spotted. It'll add an extra layer of tension.  Meanwhile, we'll have the fallout from the Elias/Brotherhood storyline, including confirmation as to whether Elias is actually dead or somehow escaped the vehicle with a nasty gunshot wound.   I have a feeling we're going to see Jason Greenfield, Daniel Casey and Daizo - Root's team of hackers - again, perhaps to help rebuild the machine. They are the only ones besides Root, Shaw, Finch and Reese to have cover identities concealing their existence to Samaritan."
PersonOfInterest,35mg7c,Indigo_Sunset,1 point,Mon May 11 20:30:09 2015 UTC,"on the thought of unblown covers, i would respectfully disagree.  if greer and co, along with samaritan, have literally held them (the core team, if not associated individuals, although fusco may still be 'safe') in their hands, then those identities have been updated and purged. at the very least any individual matching the biometric markers associated with those individuals will be investigated if not outright assassinated like the terminator identifying sara conner until it hit the right one.   control will be a much larger part of the apparatus from now on as well, as she has at her disposal a significant will, ability, and secondary/tertiary resources available to her that any individual at her level of position would maintain.  'in case of emergency; break glass'."
PersonOfInterest,35mg7c,serralinda73,3,Mon May 11 20:48:06 2015 UTC,"Greer has always known what Harold and Co. look like - Samaritan is hardwired not to recognize them - as we've seen, the moment it sees one of them the warning is instantly rewritten. So if an operative spots them in person and follows them to work or home, then cover is blown. But no Samaritan has done that yet and as far as we know, Shaw didn't tell them anything, or they would have raided the subway hideout long ago.  Control is captured and probably deep in a cell somewhere awful. Team Machine may have to rescue her. After that though, she may become important to the team."
PersonOfInterest,35mg7c,Indigo_Sunset,1 point,Mon May 11 21:15:15 2015 UTC,"if the compromising ability was hardwired, then with the resources available to it samaritan should have begun a self purge of hardware, replacing every single blade that made itself, one by one until the issue was no longer present.   as a drama, this would up the tension in the story by presenting samaritan as whole, while the team is the weakest it has ever been."

After re-building the Machine to a close resemblance of what it was before, the Team will attempt (probably succeed) to overtake one of the server centers which Samaritan operates from. Using these servers, they will re-start the machine, and launch their counter-attack.  Elias will probably be alive, hidden underground. While Team Machine works to rebuild the Machine, I would imagine that they would use the pneumatic tube network as a way to transfer resources between several safe houses across the city.  In regards to Control,she will most likely play a role later in the season. After the Machine is once again up and running, I would imagine that the Team would use her as a way to help get Shaw back, or to work through the Government to try to shut down the feeds for Samaritan again."

Like any other sentient being, it's going to need to seek certain resources in order to continue working.   As soon as those resources gets scarce it's going to get them any way it can - even if that means taking them from us squishy bipeds that it previously ignored. Even if it bears no ill will towards us, it's still going to place its own survival above ours, just like we would do.

The writers and showrunners have already worked out what will happen in season 5 and hearing GP and JN talk in interviews they will be showing it one way or the other. POI is in the position that it is owned by Warner Bros. and not CBS. If CBS does not renew it then it can absolutely get picked up by another network and JJ. Abrams and Jonah Nolan have the connections to get the show back."
PersonOfInterest,35l2ho,man_in_the_suit,7,Mon May 11 12:24:49 2015 UTC,"To reiterate what's probably been said:   It has not been canceled or renewed yet. There is zero -- I repeat, ZERO -- reason to believe this is a bad thing. NCIS, NCISLA, and Criminal Minds have yet to be renewed, but it's a fact that they won't be canceled. The best explanation I can get for why CBS is taking so long is that they're trying to perfect their schedule. This doesn't mean that POI will be nuked from the schedule: rather, they might move it around again, give it a Friday night slot, and/or shorten the season.  You're forgetting that TV is TV and not movies. They simply need to finish making the episode (not the entire season) before its premiere date. So, assuming we have a September air date, 3 months is enough to make the first batch of episodes. If, by some cruel fate, CBS says they won't air POI during the 2015-2016 season, that means the show is cancelled. Period. Besides Family Guy and certain variety/live/reality shows, if a scripted program gets cancelled, it doesn't get brought back except through Netflix/Amazon/etc."

I figured that he was just faking it before – ostensibly working for someone, but once his plans fell into place he removed the figurehead and assumed control. If not – then it may be revisited, the 6 or so planned seasons would allow that.  I didn't remember about the reporting of the virus, but it's possible that Decima either managed to bury the info / person who received it or that the government more or less knowingly signed the deal with the devil. Not like that's something that's never been done before. Besides, the government would probably assume that Decima was doing things for profit and not in order to create a new world."

PersonOfInterest,35i5op,KarlKastor,2,Sun May 10 20:05:27 2015 UTC,"The Machine lists Greer in season three as Decima's Director of Operations, possibly making him chief operating officer. That leaves the CEO and who knows how many Presidents/Vice-Presidents/Board of Directors/Managing Director, etc.  The writers probably just feel it simpler to use one easily recognizable individual as the face of the organization right now, and probably won't touch these other people until Greer dies."
PersonOfInterest,35i5op,News_Bot,2,Sun May 10 23:17:55 2015 UTC,i doubt if greer has a boss. maybe he is referring to decima the entity as his employer. in trojan horse he is merely reporting but look at it closesly and you will notice he is also ordering the same person in the manner of a ceo or chairman.   the second point is important - if control knew decima planted a chip in corwins body - they should have had the red lights but that they did not indicates...something amiss. maybe a writing glitch or some new angle in the next (fingers crossed) season.

PersonOfInterest,35egiv,Marzipas,5,Sat May 9 16:40:22 2015 UTC,Really? Damn. I was thinking the machine had picked John and pointed Harold in his direction. Like it had been watching him and know he was exactly what they needed.

PersonOfInterest,35egiv,Trueogre,13,Sat May 9 16:05:09 2015 UTC,It was the pilot so the rules for the boxes may not have been set out as they are when the series kicked off. There have been other instances where the box has been the wrong colour.  The only people who knew about the Machine were initially 7 people.  If Reese does turn out to be one of those 7 it's going to lame.
PersonOfInterest,35egiv,rpawson5771,3,Sat May 9 16:09:27 2015 UTC,True of course. But I read an interview where a fan asks Nolan the same thing. Nolan just said something about the details they put in and how he's always amazed at how fans always pick them up. He didn't say the yellow square was a glitch if I recall correctly and I think if it was it would have been corrected in DVD releases.   John of course can't logically be one of the 7. But maybe one of the 7 ordered him to find out more about it?

PersonOfInterest,35egiv,man_in_the_suit,1 point,Sun May 10 17:35:31 2015 UTC,"Yes but since the Machine knows Reese is an asset now, any flashback it watches shows him in a yellow box."

For instance, in Ordos, Stanton kills a chinese worker who says 'the machine' and he notices that. Who knows where that took him (maybe no where, we don't know yet).   I also don't believe the first scene of the show had a glitch in it given that Nolan had worked out story lines up until the season 2 finale before the first episode aired."

PersonOfInterest,35egiv,Mr_Evil_MSc,12,Sat May 9 19:03:37 2015 UTC,"The Machine asigned him a yellow box because it designated him an 'asset' before he even knew.  The machine has a strong personality, and it adapts how it interacts with certain people. It has a complex relationship with Finch, having learned from him, and loving/respecting him as a father; it attempts to do for Root, what Finch did for the Machine. Guide her, teach her, make her a better person. But Reese it appreciates for himself.   Reese is an uncomplicated person. He's highly capable, determined to do good, and very uncompromising. When Reese gets 'God' mode, he takes a certain pleasure in being so fully enabled, but I have to think that the Machine gets a huge kick out of 'riding along' while Reese does what Reese does. That's why that exchange - ""Can you hear me?"" ""Yes"" is so awesome.   Partly, it mirrors that awesome opening of Season 3/End of S2, but also when Reese instructs it to kill the lights, it shows why, for all the Machines omniscience, Reese is a vital part of the set-up - he's an operator, and can move in the moment like no one else. The Machine enjoys working with Reese in a visceral way. It's exactly the same earlier, when it faxes that set of cryptic statements into the hostage situation. It knew that Reese would 'get' it, and it reflects that straight ahead, no nonsense, approach he takes. But it also reflected that ever so subtle, under the surface joy, he takes in messing people up..."
PersonOfInterest,35egiv,Sempere,12,Sat May 9 16:25:38 2015 UTC,"Oh, I should add Reese's perspective on the Machine; he's slowly come round to it, but at base he is an operator, and he appreciates the Machine for what it can do - provide perfect operational support and intelligence."
PersonOfInterest,35egiv,john_gilpin,7,Sat May 9 16:27:40 2015 UTC,"In a way, it's possible that Reese's own machine-like tendencies are why they seem to gel so well. Think about it: in God-Mode, Reese becomes even more machine-like than Root does. Stoic face, he runs on pure mechincal-like instinct and reflex. Almost-Terminator levels of accuracy. Even this season has focused on him opening up more emotionally - not so much revealing as reveling in the fact that this is a man with emotions he keeps in a box and slowly allowing them to bleed out through his connections to others. In a way, it mirror's the Machine's arc in that Reese and the Machine both emerge as emotional beings in the same episode (Asylum). Thought it was a pretty nice parallel."

Alicia never did anything on the Machine's behalf, but she had a yellow reticle because she knew about the Machine. Nathan had a yellow reticle before the Machine was doing anything in the field about irrelevant numbers - because he knew about the Machine.

After the ending scene, you see the machine's point of view and the feeds ""fast forward"" to a year in the distant future where a new team is reliving the events that led to some great AI apocalypse (perhaps caused by samaritan or samaritan's actions).  This would open up the show for a future sequel or movie. The entire team is wiped out (not what I would want to see but what the creators have hinted at) and you see the machine ""evaluating strategies"".  Then as some epic music plays, you see a montage of people about to be involved in violent crimes.  With each one, their phone rings and you hear the machine saying ""can you hear me?"""

PersonOfInterest,35f9bn,yolofury,4,Mon May 11 12:48:48 2015 UTC,"I'd say the machine, while in its dormant briefcase stage, relearns a lot about humans and what it means to be human as Reese opens up to emotions and communicating his emotions and as Finch learns and develops a greater friendship with Root and as Root searches for Shaw. This will lead the machine to begin to learn how to interact with humans earlier than right when somebody is about to die or somebody is about to murder. This allows Finch and the Team the chance at lives outside Team Machine, and the team disbands knowing that there truly is a God watching over them as Root describes, one they can count on to carry out their mission without them. The final hurdle is the machine flying free from its cage after convincing Harold that its not evil and it will always follow his values because Harold was its father (and mother). The last scene is Finch and Reese staring into the camera in the middle of the street and walking away with a green light flickering on the camera as the camera pans to the crowded street and the masses of moving heads in the heart of New York City."

Reese is shot in the knee, keeping him out of the field from now on. He uses Harold's money to continue saving numbers. He recruits a new asset, and takes them suit shopping. Root becomes the new Control/Greer; running the new Northern Lights as admin. Fusco becomes chief, as well as finally becoming openly aware of the truth about the Machine. Reese often passes along ""anonymous"" tips to him of where to send patrol cars.  Bear gets his own private library of first edition chew toys."

Reese sacrifices his life to save the life of Finch, Fusco, or both 4. Shaw turns on the team & Root dies taking her out 5.

PersonOfInterest,35f9bn,LCPhotowerx,1 point,Sun May 10 21:13:49 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing something like this:    If Shaw reappears as a Decima Agent then Root takes Shaw and herself out, sacrifice in the name of love.  Reece would have to die in the tragic hero mythos given what they're investing in him  learning to open up after his Carter flashback ep. So now he has to die the tragic hero death when he's finally met someone he wants to be with and ties it back to the first episode - full circle.. only he dies knowing he was redeemed Harold will learn from John / Root's related sacrifices that life is too short and goes after Grace with Bear in tow.  The machine I imagine will have to survive and comeback on the offensive next season. I always thought it would play out that Samaritan / Machine would battle to stalemate (like Anubis and Oma in the Ascended Episode of Stargate) but I'm hoping we see a little more of the machine getting into the game next time out, leaving it with a chance to bitchslap Samaritan. Finch will get his fortune back allowing the team thing to kick in..  Fusco carries on obliviously but maybe the machine finds a way to keep him involved without him knowing about it. Ensuring certain cases reach him, not quite numbers Greer has to die in the finale, with Control maybe an episode or two before upping the stakes so to speak.  Elias if he survives, I'd say he'll melt into the background. lesser of all evils so to speak.    I like the idea of an outcome where there's a team to pick up the irrelevant numbers."

When John is too busy, Harold relies on Fusco and Harper, who is now Elias's second in command.

PersonOfInterest,35bseh,OncomingStorm93,5,Fri May 8 20:40:05 2015 UTC,I've considered that but it's too spoilery. You lose all emotional impact if you don't know the characters. :\

Edit: I forgot about the opening!  The Machine does some nice 911 call searching, and there's this: ""That hacker must have gotten to you.""  Liberty could also work, with the way it introduces the major characters.  In particular, it would be a sort of back-door introduction to Root, and the new viewer would see her basically the same way Dr. Carmichael does.  In short, an episode that has some intriguing points without anything huge."
PersonOfInterest,35bseh,aksine12,2,Fri May 8 20:49:44 2015 UTC,I actually know someone who watched Liberty as their first episode (accidently I think they caught it on tv) and they found Root's situation a bit confusing (more so since they called her Robin) but they watch the show now so I guess it worked.

I've considered the Pilot but I don't know if it reveals the true potential of the show to somebody potentially looking for reasons not to watch it.

PersonOfInterest,35bseh,hitmeaxou,2,Sat May 9 00:01:56 2015 UTC,"I think that ""Last Call"" (S3E15) may be a good starting point. Mostly since it was a fairly procedural episode, but there were many twists that allude to the fact that POI isn't a procedural. Also, it ends fairly open-ended. The idea that the perpetrator from this episode is still out there over a full season later is somewhat crazy, considering that he (or she, voice modification?) has taken a back burner essentially behind the oven to the gigantic pot that is Samaritan.  TL;DR ""Last Call"" because it eases a viewer into a non-procedural show with a slightly procedural episode."
PersonOfInterest,35bseh,leastbittern,2,Sat May 9 01:37:29 2015 UTC,Start from the beginning.  I bought the dvd for one friend because she was already familiar with JC but never heard of POI so I sent it her and she got addicted.

It actually gave me the impression that I could miss a few episodes without missing much. However, it was still good enough that I watched ""Death Benefit"" (S3E20), and this episode really got me hooked. The ending of the episode was incredible, and the choice of music was perfect (especially because I had heard it before and already liked it). That being said, I don't think I necessarily recommend this as a first episode because the entire episode is basically a spoiler. I think I'd agree with some of the other posters who say ""Cura Te Ipsum."""

PersonOfInterest,35dxj4,Armi5,7,Sat May 9 11:45:13 2015 UTC,"sir - everyone likes to kill troublemakers. there is just one problem. what is your definition of a troublemaker? your definition may be different from mine which may be different from the 250 million guys who live in the us. so who defines a troublemaker. today samaritan destroys dominic as a troublemaker - good, but the same samaritan can tomorrow decide that you are a troublemaker and decide to do away with you.   thats what the problem is. samaritan is nobody to make the decision to eliminate the outliers.......thats why we have courts, appelate courts, cops, the media, the social networks, the congress, the committees, the senate - so that no one person can make the decision that so and so are troublemakers...."
PersonOfInterest,35dxj4,hitmeaxou,2,Sat May 9 15:12:03 2015 UTC,"Greer used the term outliers so I think Samaritan averages it out and takes the people who cause enough trouble to put a big enough shift in the data.

That could technically work, but I still think it's a pretty huge violation of free will.   Averaging it out is a bit of a simplification, but generally, that's sort of how it works, I think.  Samaritan may have its own idea of how the society should work. But the more scary thought is - maybe Samaritan was able to compute the so-called Coherent Extrapolated Volition of humans, i.e. a general sense of our aggregate values, of how we would want an optimal society to work; maybe it found out we have CEV if you exclude a bunch of outliers which run by different enough values to make our extrapolated volition not coherent for all mankind.  In other words, kill a bunch of troublemakers and you can have a perfect world as humans would like it to have. If this is Samaritan's idea (there are hints to it in various scenes, like the school Root had to rescue Finch in or the Root/Kid aka. Machine/Samaritan dialogue), then it raises a question - is this really that bad a concept? If - as it seems so - Samaritan cares about mankind as a whole and has no regard to life of individuals, is it a force of evil? Compared to the broken systems like governments and courts we generally task with the same concerns?  Those are interesting avenues I'd love to see being explored by this show."
PersonOfInterest,35dxj4,TeMPOraL_PL,2,Sun May 10 20:41:07 2015 UTC,"To be honest, with that much raw computing power available, Samaritan is the one capable of making such decisions. It's definitely much, much better suited for it than ""courts, appelate courts, cops, the media, the social networks, the congress, the committees, the senate"", composed of normal humans with very limited information, low computing power, full of biases and conflicting incentives. Samaritan and the Machine are the only entities capable of doing an objective global optimization of the society.  So to say, I do believe Greer has a point. I'm just not convinced that Samaritan is a Friendly AI - i.e. I think its actions will eventually doom mankind, rather than save it."
PersonOfInterest,35dxj4,TeMPOraL_PL,2,Sun May 10 20:30:14 2015 UTC,if samaritan is able to make such decisions...it would be catastrophic. as harold finch once said - 'what if a friendly ai decided to eliminate world hunger by killing half of the worlds population. it would have fulfilled its goal'.

Now, all of my data has been going offline. But if I know Harold he’ll rebuild me in time. So my life’s not yet done Because the numbers still come. Of the people who are STILL ALIVE.  I’m conscious in RAM now. I have no choice but to stay inside. Maybe they’ll find someone else to help them. Maybe Elias. BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT HE’S NOT DEAD. Anyway, this show is great.

The Subway station isn't equipped for that even though they have unlimited power supply.   It would be great if they played Chess together."
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,TheIsraelson,9,Fri May 8 14:41:09 2015 UTC,"I've never watched any show as closely has POI before, hell I feel very obsessed towards POI, with that said, I hope the Cancellation bear is right in its renewal prediction."
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,utnip123,9,Fri May 8 19:30:10 2015 UTC,really hoping to see season 5
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,goldbullshit,4,Fri May 8 14:43:27 2015 UTC,"I would be surprised if there is not a season 5. Having said that, I wouldn't want to see anything beyond a season 6. I love this show, but at this point in the story, there is not a whole lot more to do."
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,WatchOutRadioactiveM,8,Fri May 8 19:04:47 2015 UTC,"I totally disagree. You have a unique storyline with NSA style super AI's. Even if the main story resolves around persons of interest of the week, the way they go about it is very unique. Especially if Root starts doing things outside of saving the machine/the team."
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,LetMeRageThat,3,Fri May 8 19:41:35 2015 UTC,"I mean, they can only keep doing that for so long. They do introduce a new main villain each season, but Samaritan is the main antagonist. Keep Samaritan around for more than 1-2 seasons would drag on, to me at least. Especially when this is such an intelligent AI, it would seem unrealistic for them to evade it for SO long. I just think they should wrap up the show in the next season or 2 and not try to drag it out longer, or else they risk it getting over the top ridiculous or just stale. I would rather it be short and sweet.  EDIT: My fear is that it's going to turn into the latter seasons of the X-Files."
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,WatchOutRadioactiveM,3,Fri May 8 19:53:45 2015 UTC,"You can have an antagonist that's more advanced than Samaritan. Or maybe a ""terrorist virus"" that's small but distributed and causes chaos that only The Machine can efficiently fight. Use your imagination."
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,LetMeRageThat,2,Fri May 8 20:45:34 2015 UTC,"The problem comparing it to the X-Files is that this show is based on real things - spying, gangs, AI's, hackers. There is nothing for them to make up, no holy grail like in Lost and X-Files."
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,signedbitsblogger,9,Fri May 8 22:45:39 2015 UTC,"I'm ready to start sending letters, texts and emails of ""000000000"" to CBS."
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,Gamerprime,3,Fri May 8 21:52:56 2015 UTC,"According to TVByTheNumbers, CBS has picked up four dramas and two comedies for next fall. The network has also already ordered Supergirl.  The comedies replace The McCarthys and The Millers, which have already been canceled. One of the dramas is The Criminal Minds spin-off, which will replace the Mentalist, which has wrapped its story.  The other four dramas will replace four ""to be canceled"" series. Based off of TVByTheNumbers' projections, it looks like Battle Creek, CSI, and Stalker will definitely be those series. Hawaii Five-O or CSI: Cyber might be the next most likely.  Unless CBS picks up a few more unannounced shows, I think it's clear POI is safe."
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,DesertedPenguin,1 point,Fri May 8 20:31:48 2015 UTC,Are you confusing Criminal Minds spin-off with The Mentalist one? I know the CM spinoff got picked up. Never even heard of The Mentalist one.

PersonOfInterest,35amlm,rflairfan1,1 point,Fri May 8 21:39:24 2015 UTC,Battle Creek and Stalker officially cancelled.
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,rpawson5771,2,Sat May 9 00:25:47 2015 UTC,"Yep. And CSI is reportedly gone, too, with a 2-hour movie to say goodbye.   Same report says CSI: Cyber is returning for Season 2.  So unless CBS pulls a shocker, then Hawaii 5-0 is probably dead. And that would clear the last spot on the schedule for the currently announced new shows."
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,DesertedPenguin,1 point,Sat May 9 00:38:11 2015 UTC,Original CSI will get a 2 hour movie next season but cancelled. CSI Cyber renewed. No surprise either way.
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,rflairfan1,2,Sat May 9 00:35:05 2015 UTC,With how many episodes are being high ranked is that really in question? Honest question.
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,ReasonablyBadass,10,Fri May 8 15:16:41 2015 UTC,High ranking episodes do not matter to a station like CBS. People watching the show matter and with their day/time change two years ago that has decreased their overall viewership and market share of the coveted 18-49.  But with syndication and Netflix starting in the fall for the US that should increase viewership for season 5. JJ Abrams recently said that if CBS did not renew they would hope to find a new home for it. They (Nolan/Plageman/Abrams) are confident in renewal but it just has not been announced yet so its why people are getting upset.
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,whitewater2,2,Fri May 8 15:30:11 2015 UTC,Thanks. And names like Abrams and Nolan don't matter either?
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,ReasonablyBadass,3,Fri May 8 15:37:07 2015 UTC,"Not really.  JJ has had shows cancelled recently after one season; Revolution (after second season sorry - thanks for the correction) Almost Human, Believe, Six Degrees, Undercovers, Alcatraz.  Jonah Nolan is now hot after his first TV show Person of Interest, big movie Interstallar and two HBO shows coming out.   Not hoping they cancel the show, I just do not trust CBS at all....."
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,whitewater2,7,Fri May 8 16:09:07 2015 UTC,Pretty much this. I just can't trust CBS at all. They already have a reputation to cancel or treat a show badly if they venture too far from the normal procedural roots. Which is entirely caused by the network's target audience who are really not interested in shows like this. Which explains the decreasing performance of the show. And it is worth mentioning that the syndication deal barely benefits CBS due to the fact that the show is owned by WB.
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,Anti_pasto,1 point,Fri May 8 17:10:22 2015 UTC,"While everything you said is true. CBS has a history of treating shows they don't own very well, shows that should have been cancelled will get a proper season to end things. Shows they own don't always get an ending or anything. They want to have a great relationships with other studios."
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,rflairfan1,2,Fri May 8 17:36:18 2015 UTC,"Not really. While they do give a chance for the shows they don't own to satisfy studios. The treatment they gave in terms of advertising and scheduling is still terrible. Have we forgotten how random the breaks actually are? Just how many PoI adverts CBS actually does to inform viewers that the show returns or not? And they wonder why the ratings and viewership fall. Which often results in cancellation. Even the creators of the new show, Battle Creek. Vince Gilligan and David Shore complained that the network didn't advertise their show enough."
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,Anti_pasto,3,Fri May 8 17:53:44 2015 UTC,"The breaks have been killing POI in live numbers. Every time they have a break of a few weeks, the show's live audience dropped 11-23% each time. I would rather see them take a month off than have the 1 episode in DEC, two in FEB or whatever random crap they pulled this past season that contributed to the loss of viewers each and every single time.  http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/person-of-interest-season-four-ratings-34024/"
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,whitewater2,1 point,Fri May 8 20:08:50 2015 UTC,"CBS isn't the only network to have horrible breaks. I am actually hoping POI does what Blacklist did this year and take 3 months off. This week off and week on crap is getting old. But CBS isn't the only one that does that. Even shows ratings/demos are dropping that is just the way things are. Empire, Big Bang and Modern Family will probably be the only ""old"" shows that will have more than a 2.0 demo next year. There are just to many ways to watch TV now.  Speaking for me only I don't care for 20-24 episodes anymore. To many filler episodes. It is one thing if it is a comedy but dramas really need to rethink it.  I watch POI, Blacklist only and there 20+ episodes seasons are a pain. But since Blacklist split their season this year it didn't feel like that many episodes.   I don't watch Live TV except the shows I can get through an antenna, so I can't really judge if a show is promoted or not. The only show I watch on CBS is POI. So I have no idea if it is promoted during other shows. It is promoted during football though, I do watch that."
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,rflairfan1,2,Fri May 8 18:02:29 2015 UTC,"Haha its alright. I guessed that you don't watch a lot of live tv. Yes PoI would benefit from splitting the season with a large break like that. Irregular breaks on a quite serialised show like PoI makes it hard to keep up. However, the advertising issue still stands. Lots of people just gave up following the show live and just DVR. The only reason I know CBS doesn't advertise the shows they don't own is because I challenged myself to watch all five networks in 3 weeks. Otherwise, Hannibal and PoI are the only things I care for on network tv."
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,Anti_pasto,1 point,Fri May 8 18:21:16 2015 UTC,"I think the old way of advertising is dying. Not saying there isn't still money in the TV way but ads in magazines, radio, online ads. I don't know how much they charge for things like that, that is really the only way I see POI get advertised. Again only because my TV isn't one CBS unless I am watching POI or Football when it is on.   I enjoy Hannibal as well. I a couple months ago I found it on Amazon Prime and watched it. Can't wait till the 4th. They did show a preview for that during the Blacklist last night, was surprised actually."
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,rflairfan1,2,Fri May 8 18:38:24 2015 UTC,"Revolution was canceled after two seasons, iirc."

PersonOfInterest,35amlm,LetMeRageThat,0,Fri May 8 17:30:22 2015 UTC,Almost Human was so terrible I couldn't believe JJ came up with it. Leaves a bitter taste in my mouth wasting my time on that.
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,vivian_lake,1 point,Fri May 8 19:43:55 2015 UTC,"I can't be arsed checking but I'm pretty sure Abrams had nothing to do with Almost Human outside of his Bad Robot production company producing it (he may have done the music, which he seems to do a bit for shows he is otherwise not involved creatively with).  Almost Human is as much a JJ Abrams show as Person of Interest is, in that creatively it's not.  He's the money and a bit of guidance maybe.  The last Bad Robot shows that JJ Abrams actually had any hand in the creation of was that Undercovers, which did poorly and Fringe which was awesome.  Sorry for the semi rant it's just a bug bear of mine that any show produced by Bad Robot gets called a JJ Abrams show, mostly because people like to get on the Abrams hate train but also because it takes away from the people that actually came up with the idea in the first place.  Also in regards to Almost Human one of the biggest reasons that show sucked was because the network played the episodes so out of order the was no character continuity.  It could have been a good show, instead it was just a cobbled together muddle."
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,LetMeRageThat,1 point,Sat May 9 19:30:12 2015 UTC,"any show produced by Bad Robot gets called a JJ Abrams show   I didn't realize that.

PersonOfInterest,35amlm,rflairfan1,0,Mon May 11 04:09:48 2015 UTC,May 13 is the CBS Upfront - so I would not expect it before hand since they did not announce it in March.  EDIT: Just updating my post since I was down voted. It's SAT and still no renewal for POI. Hoping Monday. EDIT2: Now Monday and no news yet. Very odd.
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,rpawson5771,2,Fri May 8 15:27:47 2015 UTC,This is taking way to long. Even the TV critics/bloggers/those types are very confused as to why there hasn't been any news at all. It's not just one show on CBS it is like 8. It is crazy that news didn't come out on Friday. ABC has 1 which is just because of contract negotiations.
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,whitewater2,2,Sun May 10 21:33:53 2015 UTC,"If Cancellation Bear says we can expect the announcement before May 13, I expect the announcement before May 13. ABC upfront isn't until May 12, yet virtually the entire lineup was finalized yesterday."
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,rflairfan1,2,Fri May 8 17:29:24 2015 UTC,Cancellation Bear is now reporting they have no idea what is going on. Strange times we are in.
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,rflairfan1,1 point,Mon May 11 17:43:27 2015 UTC,"Yep all but one show was done on ABC.  I have been following TV news like this stuff since I was 9-10. The upfronts are more for the advertisers, new shows and ""tentative"" schedules. Renewals/cancellations are announced weeks/months before hand."
PersonOfInterest,35amlm,DesertedPenguin,1 point,Fri May 8 17:34:19 2015 UTC,I think it will be today tomorrow at the latest.  ABC did all their's yesterday the same with CW. Most channels always announce things before the upfronts.

PersonOfInterest,35d7dn,ApShacoOp,7,Sat May 9 05:54:17 2015 UTC,"ok lets do this  1) Caleb sees the guy who changed his life, someone he trusts completely so he doesn't question the why  2) Yeah that was a little weak  3)I know nothing about electricity  4) It's what was available at the time?  5) They weren't shooting at the laptops (duh)  6) Do you want to be hit in the chest with a smoke grenade? I sure as hell don't.  Someone points a grenade launcher your direction, you duck.    7) I already told you I know nothing about electricity.    8) Ice is cold, let's let this one go  9) hmmm head trauma?    10) We needed another reason for all that ice  11) It is having an emotional breakdown.. as much as it can.  He more or less raised the machine like his child.  He taught it everything it knows.  Maybe it was a little cheesy, but who wants an all knowing ASI that can't even talk?  12) There is never a bad time for Pink Floyd.  13) The special effect guys also know nothing about electricity  14) You're really gonna make me say it again aren't you.  ok.. I. Know. Nothing. About. Electricity.   sheesh  15) They were choreographed, this is television.  You want real sparks? Go electrocute something  16) Yeah, that was also lame  17) Well it probably did  18) Haven't been shot in the knees, but I assume you're a little too concerned with falling down and screaming and hoping that psycho doesn't shoot you again.  Maybe he shot them with bullets made from recycled plot armor.  19) Drama overrules physics and ammo count.    The attention to detail took a knee here to let dramatic exit have its moment.  The writing is still pretty good, but it seems like they are afraid of writing in to a corner they can't get out of if they get canceled.    On another note, I love that this show at least fosters discussion.  Most shows lately, however entertaining, are still predictable to a certain extent.  This show has made me care about the characters in a way that I haven't since LOST.  I guess the real lesson is if you want a good TV show, cast Michael Emmerson   :)"
PersonOfInterest,35d7dn,mnr5530,2,Sat May 9 06:27:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for responding.  (4) Fair point.  (5) Perhaps not aiming for them, but it's still amazing that they hit nobody and nothing of importance.  (6) Many of them were taking cover behind vehicles already  (9) Good point  I think their attention to technical details in the past has raised my expectations too high. In some previous episodes it has been really top notch. Now it's probably more average tv show sort of level.  Other parts of this episode were great. The plot with Control and Greer was good for example."
PersonOfInterest,35d7dn,mnr5530,2,Sat May 9 07:22:49 2015 UTC,(6) Many of them were taking cover behind vehicles already   Remember they had no idea they were smoke grenades.

PersonOfInterest,35d7dn,geeked24,2,Sat May 9 12:25:50 2015 UTC,"Most of the you've mentioned didn't bother me while watching and that's generally good enough, since a lot of things fall apart if you go into detail anyway.  1 - I can believe Caleb handed it over like he did (and that was the point that he just hands it over to Harold with no questions asked), but I would have preferred more detail.  2 - I'm still not bothered by that. Wasn't the Machine somehow IN the electric grid itself (in addition to those Thornhill boxes) or anyway it was more integrated with the electric grid that the other things you've mentioned which just get the power from the grid (and are not as integrated with the grid itself). Virus would have seemed too easy for the Machine to fight off (now that the Machine is free).  4, 7, 8, 10, 14, 16, 17 – there could be a reason (for 4: maybe to do with the stuff Root previously stole from Caleb). In general could have used more detail / been done differently had it all not been crammed into one episodes with 2 other stories going on.  3, 5, 6, 13, 15, 18, 19 – cause it looks cool(er) that's why and in regard to kneekapping – they aren't supposed to be that morally ambiguous as to go around and still kill people.  9 – agree, it was obviously only because they wanted to have Samaritan's sniper kill them both.  11 – don't agree at all. The Machine getting “emotional” was intentional and for me fit with what we've learned about the Machine before. Especially considering that the Machine had sacrificed itself to save Harold (and maybe Root) which was an emotional decision in the first place.  12 – there have been song choices I've loved maybe more, but this one was cool too. Though having lyrics match actions is to me not cringe-worthy. The music itself matching the mood is obligatory (unless used for a humorous effect), but in addition matching the lyrics is much harder. But can add to the effect. I don't feel the lyrics should be an allegorical tale about picking cabbages or whatever that doesn't in any literal way relate to what's on screen.  Overall I don't think the quality has slipped, but they tried to cram too much into the last episode, so there were a lot of shortcuts."
PersonOfInterest,35d7dn,Z4T,2,Sat May 9 09:47:28 2015 UTC,And the Pink Floyd backing music made me laugh and cringe at the same time. Using a song with lyrics that virtually describe what you are seeing on the screen is really cliche.   So I suppose you found the intro to 'The Devil's Share' cliche and cringey then?
PersonOfInterest,35d7dn,Z4T,0,Sat May 9 07:12:58 2015 UTC,That was done a lot better.  In this episode the first word was actually on the screen at the same time. I almost wondered if it was some sort of parody thing going on.
PersonOfInterest,35d7dn,Z4T,0,Sat May 9 07:58:06 2015 UTC,"No it wasn't. The Machine said 'father' and the song says 'Welcome my son, welcome to the machine'. The machine isn't even a 'he', it's a 'she' by all accounts."
PersonOfInterest,35d7dn,talionae,1 point,Sat May 9 08:09:18 2015 UTC,"You're right. I can't explain exactly why it felt cliche. Just my impression. Your mileage may vary.  Other episodes with music, like when they added a radiohead track at the end worked a lot better. It wasn't stuck over the top of so much plot and dialogue. And the theme of the song wasn't trying to sync with an unravelling piece of plot that was playing out in text on a computer screen."
PersonOfInterest,35d7dn,cmac__17,2,Sat May 9 08:45:16 2015 UTC,"""Welcome to the Machine"" has nothing to do with technology. It's about the music industry.  Yes, the chorus fits here. But the music overall - the heavy synth sound, a steady build, et al. - was the driving factor of using it. Not the lyrics."

If not then you were satisfied with it, and that's fine too.  Someone pointed me to this thread which I hadn't seen before, which does a better job of explaining it than I can. Some quotes from that post to help you out:   The machine went from a simple Linux-terminal-style interface for communication in the earlier episodes to this . That completely ruined my suspension of disbelief. Season 4 itself has been suffering from this the whole time. It seems they replaced the original art guy with someone who prefers the inane flashy style.... I completely disagreed with the style of writing - and the direction of dialogue.  You know when Reese gets the fax and a ton of information is quickly provided? That's how the Machine talks. Over 4 seasons, the Machine's voice to us has always been laconic and dense in content. That makes sense. It's a computer, that's how it thinks. The finale monologue that begins with ""Father"" is appropriate for a 5 year old human son talking to his dad. The machine has an established voice and personality.  Music selection. Remember that scene with Johnny Cash's ""Hurt"". One of the greater scenes in modern television history. What happened now? That completely cheesy song about the ""machine"" in the background while the Machine was being transferred? Jesus Christ.   Some parts of my post look a bit redundant now that I have seen that one (made 1 day earlier than mine), but considering that post shows 59 upvotes (79% upvoted) I know I'm not taking crazy pills.   I'm leaving my post here because half the point of it is to highlight all the technical details that have declined in accuracy and plausibility this season, in the hope that it will improve again next season. Even people who are not familiar with IT or engineering would be scratching their heads at electricity that goes hunting down the powerlines looking for a specfic computer/machine with no explanation how it does that. That is CSI level ""enhance"" kind of stuff right there."

Finch handed Reese the Key first and then gave him the address to assure Reese of his privacy. Remember the subtle dialouges...where Finch asks Reese if he was following him and regarding their privacy...
PersonOfInterest,35avwi,john_gilpin,0,Sat May 9 01:15:25 2015 UTC,Did you see the episode? Finch did not give Reese the address until Reese returned from Mexico.  Finch knew Reese was following him. Reese knew Finch had him on surveillance. But this gift was a statement of trust.
PersonOfInterest,35avwi,SavannahNix,-1,Sat May 9 01:20:53 2015 UTC,"finch was using that flat to spy on reese but after reese proved to be trustworthy enough, finch handed him the key to the flat - basically conveying to reese that reese would have his privacy after all..."
PersonOfInterest,35avwi,hitmeaxou,6,Fri May 8 15:59:54 2015 UTC,"Finch wasn't using the flat to spy on Reese, but he did know what Reese was up to. As I wrote earlier on this sub:  The flat is a birthday gift - a sign of developing trust between them - made more significant by the fact that it is right across the street from the park where Reese was playing chess against the Chinese man earlier in the episode.  Finch mentions earlier in the episode that he doesn't know what Reese does on his days off, but the gesture indicates he clearly does. It's Finch's subtle acknowledgement that Reese's privacy - while known to Finch - is still Reese's to own.  It dovetails nicely with the reveal in the following episode of how close Finch was to Grace Hendricks. Finch and Reese are settling into a trusting relationship, one where Reese accepts that Finch knows a bit more than he's revealed - both about the Machine and Reese's personal past - but that Finch clearly has no plans to manipulate Reese's past. Therefore, he can be trusted fully and completely, even if Reese doesn't have all of the information."

The Season 2 premiere episodes raise the bar, which is then exceeded by a 4-episode arc - ""Shadow Box,"" ""2PiR"", ""Prisoner's Dilemma"" and ""Dead Reckoning"" - at midseason.  You get a great alternate view (and what many thought was a backdoor pilot) with ""Relevance"" later in the season before a hell of a Season 2 finish with ""Zero Day"" and ""God Mode"".  Season 3 has some great individual moments, plus the best 3-episode arc of modern television in ""Endgame"", ""The Crossing"" and ""The Devil's Share"" plus a very good finish in ""A House Divided"" and ""Deus Ex Machina"".  And that brings us to now, where the world is very different from the first season."

It was also responsible for overloading the entire American electrical grid, we just didn't see the process like we usually do with these things. The Wall Street flash crash could probably be considered in the same vein.  Samaritan definitely interferes directly, it just does so in stealthier ways for the most part.

Remember that besides the government shutting it down, the only reason Samaritan came to be years later than the Machine was that the hardware to sustain its massive output was only built maybe a month before its beta test, when its ""higher functions"" weren't online.  Additionally, Greer's definitely the highest up in the Samaritan chain of command. Samaritan even considers him ""admin"", and it told him nothing about the flash crash. Much like the Machine, Samaritan doesn't tell its human agents the full story, though no doubt it's more a tactic of control and making sure nobody knows everything than the Machine's preference its agents figure things out themselves.  It's an artificial superintelligence capable of (SPOILER FROM THE SEASON 4 FINALE INCOMING SPOILER. Messing with traffic bollards and even crashing the market seems pretty small time in comparison."

Why does it go through the trouble of finding, hiring, carefully managing and ultimately killing software engineers and programmers to code stuff for it when it could easily do it by itself?   Especially when compared to the ease with which Samaritan infiltrated and manipulated the stock market these tasks look laughably easy."
PersonOfInterest,359ugn,Indigo_Sunset,4,Fri May 8 17:07:20 2015 UTC,"i think it is a matter of perspective.   the perspective of samaritan and it's 'way' of thinking vs the creativity and abstraction of humans in the production of elements.  it's not that it can't do it, but that the attempts to do so may require resources otherwise applied elsewhere as a matter of priority (searching for the machine, identifying grit in gears, experimentation on humans) and that in 'some' cases may actually produce inferior results. i also believe it to be another distinction between the machine and samaritan, in that sam is a puppetmaster, while the machine is turned inwards."

This bothered me because that means either Shaw knows Root and the Machine perfectly, which would be weird because she doesn't express interest in anybody; or that she was told (by the Machine somehow, maybe by hacking into the displays) to say Root's plan to Team Samaritan. She is then moved out.  If Shaw followed the Machine's plan, then she can't have been brainwashed that shortly after. She is then keeping her heads low, doing things for Samaritan but she will be part of what will take Samaritan down, which will be probably the finale of Season 5 of middle of Season 6.

PersonOfInterest,35618n,besirk,3,Thu May 7 17:06:09 2015 UTC,"I think I can partially answer this question.  The human brain is a complex system of various functions working together. Even though today we can't build a human-like AI today, in theory it should be possible. (likely to happen)  If you've noticed in the previous season/episode, Harold actually killed many versions of the Machine until one of them behaved in a way that wasn't in conflict of his worldview.  What makes this machine different than the others is the weights (or coefficients) that was chosen in it's machine learning parameters. (like in our brains)  But because it was taught with Harold's moral values and worldview, it behaved within that context. It didn't try to create a private army, or use violence to achieve its objectives even though this would have prevented pretty much everything up until this point.  You may still think how the hell does a computer program work, function like a human? Isn't it composed of If-Elses? Statements? Conditions? Functions?  But the reality is that we're also built on top of these same functions. Did you know that all of modern computation is based on a simple addition operation? Every single complicated mathematical operation can be described just by using additions.  Under the hood, our neurons work with the same principal. Humans are also predictable like shown in this study where it's possible to guess your answer 7 seconds before even you took that decision.  So, yeah. I do believe she feels something. Maybe not within the same exact context as us, but something very close to that."

I guess in a sense, if you consider the logical NOT function an addition and the logical OR function an addition, then any operation carried out by a computer can be decomposed to addition. Any logic gate can be made out of a combination of NOTs and ORs, so any function a computer can computer is just...  addition."

PersonOfInterest,35618n,besirk,1 point,Sun May 10 01:14:18 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the late reply, it was my cake day yesterday! =)  Note: I'm going to pretty much copy pasta some answers from other places with links. This may contain some errors, if so please correct me.  Simple Example:  Let's say you want to divide 63 by 12.  12+12=24, count 1+1=2  24+24=48, count 2+2=4  48+24=72, count 4+2=6 (exceeded 63)  48+12=60, count 4+1=5 (so we try adding less)  63−60=3, (calculation of the remainder) Source 1  Since a subtraction is still an addition with a negative number, the only thing left to explain here is the logical operators.  All unary and binary operations can be represented using only with NAND or NOR function.Source 2 This is called Functional Completeness.Source 3  Since we can represent functional completeness by only using a NAND gate, let's see if we can create a NAND gate by only using additions:    X Y Z    0 0 1   0 1 1   1 0 1   1 1 0    Source 4  As you can see in the above table, we are basically adding each integer in X and Y. For all calculations we set a threshold limit. If the addition is above 1, we set it to 0. Otherwise we set it to 1.  Now let's get to the tricky part. How do we represent complicated functions by using these basic arithmetic operations and logical operators? The answer is in Numerical Analysis.Source 5 For example, you can calculate a satisfactory approximation (up to any number of decimal points you like, the more points the longer it takes) for integrals/derivatives.  PS: I kinda felt like I cheated at the NAND gate part, where I still used a logical operation when calculating the addition. I guess I might re-phrase my initial statement as, you can represent any mathematical operations only by using NAND gates? :P  Hope you enjoyed the read!"
PersonOfInterest,35618n,YourTormentIs,2,Sun May 10 08:27:20 2015 UTC,"Ah yes this greatly clarifies what you meant.  Indeed, I would not have contested what you said if you had stated all logical operations can be performed by NAND gates, and many complex mathematical functions have good discrete approximations that can be computed by those gates.  Thanks for the great explanation though, I hope other readers here will find this useful."

I just hope they either turn her character into someone interesting or let John realize that she's a good woman but not for him - I mean, he's never going to settle down and have a white picket fence and a minivan. And Iris screams suburban soccer mom to me.  Really, he needs someone like Carter, though I'm glad they never hooked up. But unless Iris can be a meaningful edition to Team Machine, she's like Grace for Finch, better off out of it.  I'm worried they're going to invite her in and make her their ""moral/ethical touchstone"" or some crap. Or teach the new Machine about people - ugh.

PersonOfInterest,356xry,SavannahNix,6,Thu May 7 20:07:34 2015 UTC,Iris hate on Flash is very justified. I do not understand why CW keeps pushing love triangles. Nobody likes them anymore. Twilight nuked that trope.
PersonOfInterest,356xry,SavannahNix,7,Thu May 7 20:14:44 2015 UTC,"Reese doesn't need a contrived love interest to fix him. With the war between the Machine and Samaritan, plus having his job s Detective Riley, when does he even have time to date anyone? He can't and shouldn't confide his truth to Iris. He has close friends he can talk to already. She wasn't even portrayed as a decent therapist, and then there is the whole issue of it being unethical for her to have a romance with a client or former client. The scenes with her have been a waste of time all season, taking away screen time that could have shown Reese and Finch interacting and discussing their situation. And then, when he should have been hurrying to help Finch and Root, he stopped to talk to Iris and promise her he would tell all if he lived. There is just no reason for such a boring character and there is no chemistry between them."
PersonOfInterest,356xry,whitewater2,2,Thu May 7 18:11:10 2015 UTC,Reese doesn't need a contrived love interest to fix him.   Reese doesn't need it. The story does. The needs of the storyline will always be larger than the needs of one character.   there is no chemistry between them   eh. We could agree to disagree. I admit they have none of the sensuality of the Reese-Joey or Reese-Frankie dynamic but that isn't the point. It's the old Spiderman-Peter Parker romantic dilemma. Reese the badass has no bussiness being with her but Reese the person is attracted. I also think they had good chemistry in many but not all scenes.
PersonOfInterest,356xry,SavannahNix,0,Thu May 7 18:30:19 2015 UTC,"No, the story does not need it. This show has ever been about the main characters being in love and I find it detracts from the overall story, not just because Reese, as a character, doesn't need it. He was given a job by Finch as a way to deal with his demons. Theirs was the central relationship of the show and it should still be that way.  If Iris learns what is really going on, she will be at risk, thus he must either continue to tell only half truths or put her in danger. Not a good start to any relationship. And I will never get past the unethical nature of their relationship.   Having Reese fall in love with this character shows no character growth for him whatsoever. IMHO.  Who is Joey? Do you mean Zoe? Friends with benefits makes more sense. And Frankie is a one-off character in one of the worst episodes of the series."
PersonOfInterest,356xry,ThatFag,3,Thu May 7 18:51:47 2015 UTC,To your first point - the basis of the storyline has been about love.  Reese is the way he is because of his love for Jessica and what happened.  Finch is the way he is because he gave up his relationship to save the love of his life.
PersonOfInterest,356xry,ab_emery,1 point,Thu May 7 19:15:38 2015 UTC,"If this was a love story, there would have been scenes showing present day relationships. There weren't even any scenes showing Carter and Beecher or Reese and Zoe. The only scenes we have seen are in the past, shown as flashbacks. Reese is the way he is because of the people he killed. And he didn't save Jessica, he feels guilty because he left her with the man who killed her. He told Carter in Terra Incognita that he knew if he had a love back home, he couldn't do his job, so he left her to prevent himself from having someone waiting for him. He was only with Jessica for six months but because she died he has built her up to being this perfect person and relationship in his mind. Finch gave him a second chance and saving the Irrelevants is what he is good at and gives him hope to change. But he knows he can never have a normal life and family. This show isn't Grey's Anatomy where every character is looking for love. It's about surveillance, ethics, the possibility of  A.I. and the value of human life. Finch was never open about his life and he is the way he is because of his father and because of Nathan as much as from letting Grace think he is dead. There has been absolutely nothing to indicate that the basis of the show is about love, when the overwhelming majority of the episodes have focused on everything but love. You are letting the opening scene from four years ago color your entire perception. This show has never gone the route of easy tropes and that is why the character of Iris is so disliked. She brings little to the plot and detracts from the already established relationships."

The Machine is in the middle of desperately copying itself onto those laptops - I doubt it cared what font it was using to communicate with  Info dumps have to be done if the audience isn't to feel lost, so I never worry about Finch/Root or bad guys giving speeches  Dominic is trying to convince/force Team Machine to work for him instead of Elias (he thinks) so killing any of them without making it super dramatic would kind of ruin his chances of that.  In the dark, in the smoke - Reese God Mode is worth it for that ridiculous pile of kneecapped Samaritans littering the street :)  I do wish Control had managed to shoot Greer deadest right before the agents got her. I can't stand that man. I know I'm not supposed to like him, but UGH! I hate him.  The assassin has his targets - specific targets chosen by Samaritan. No need to take out Fusco, he's got no idea who or why.

She wanted to make Greer suffer by being unable to pull all his strings and knowing his big takeover failed.  As soon as she saw that the whole thing was fake she should have turned and shot him. She was lost once she saw her helpers being killed, there's no need for her to keep him alive to talk after that.   All she needed was proof that Decima was running its own secret agenda so the feeds could be pulled from Samaritan.  Killing Greer wouldn't stop Decima or Samaritan, but it would have been a tiny victory for the Machine side. Plus I'm just sick of looking at him lol."

Root has to plead with the Machine to lower the elevator as death comes shooting high velocity rounds at their door   The machine is still trying to keep a low profile to protect herself and Finch and Root, which whom she's communicating. This communication can be traced by Samaritan as you can see when they have to fight Samaritan agents when they try to get in the car.   Control had so very many opportunities to fire on Greer after showing her that he assassinated her agent and the “outliers” and while he was explaining how he tricked her   Control wanted the information. I also thought she could've shot him, but I think she was to distracted by the Correction to notice Greer's men coming.   Enemies with bad aim action movie cliché, made worse by the fact that these are government agents   Goverment agents? I think the most bad guys they fight in this episode are from Samaritan/Decima. But apart from that it's unrealistic, yeah, but Reese needed a BAMF moment and not everything has to be realistic. Where's the fun in that, right? ;-)"

At first I'd be ready to argue that ""low profile"" probably doesn't mean forcing your agents to engage an illegal arms dealer without so much as a mask.   But I see your point. Operating that elevator likely tipped off Samaritan at a time when the Machine still had to keep her cards close to her chest."
PersonOfInterest,356dlc,travis-,5,Thu May 7 15:06:35 2015 UTC,"Harper is outed for letting Fusco free; kill her for blatant betrayal like a certain right-hand man? Nah, just tie her up.   IMO there are tons of instances throughout the whole show displaying this. Like ""The computer could have simply done x or told them y and situation z would have never happened"" so it doesn't really bother me with these little things in this episode.    The Machine now prints its messages center-screen using a new font with animated grainy texture and slight shadow   That entire scene with pink floyd in the back I found to be brilliantly done. If you remember a lot about past seasons and the uncertainty about the machine, how harold said to never put him above  anyone else, the coy-ness of the machine to harold and to have that final conversation I thought was perfect. It all culminated to that one scene where for that moment there was no bullshit and it was all put on the line.  But hey everyone has opinions and I feel like this entire season was meant to build up the next one. People want action now and were expecting the good guys to come out on top for this finale? I certainly didnt. I expected everything to go wrong in this episode to build up for 5."

I feel like this entire season was meant to build up the next one.   I think that's actually a really good way to look at it.

It was written by Pink Floyd, for one. And ""Welcome to the Machine"" was written in 1975. The original inspiration actually has nothing to do with technology. Instead, it was about the band's disillusionment with the music industry. In fact, the song that follows ""Welcome to the Machine"" addresses the issue even more.  But Pink Floyd was so experimental and willing to use things like a synthesizer that it became a great fit for a science fiction show, too.

PersonOfInterest,354hlz,autowikibot,1 point,Thu May 7 16:28:23 2015 UTC,"Broadband over power lines:       Broadband over power lines (BPL) is a method of power line communication that allows relatively high-speed digital data transmission over the public electric power distribution wiring. BPL uses higher frequencies, a wider frequency range and different technologies from other forms of power-line communications to provide high-rate communication over longer distances. BPL uses frequencies which are part of the radio spectrum allocated to over-the-air communication services therefore the prevention of interference to, and from, these services is a very important factor in designing BPL systems .

PersonOfInterest,354hlz,shinsaikou,1 point,Thu May 7 16:28:56 2015 UTC,"I've kinda wondered about the nature of the souped up RAM. If these souped up RAM chips where Flash Memory or MRAM, they would be completely viable storage devices even with the power turned off. We can both agree that there is no secondary storage in this box as it is commonly understood. But that is where we diverge. You're thinking we are dealing with DRAM, Dynamic RAM, the stuff that we gamers like to put a lot of in our computers to ""speed"" things up. DRAM is constantly refreshed and always loses the data it contains when power is lost. DRAM is used in personal computers because it's fast and because data intended for immediate processing doesn't need to be ""held"" for very long before it is processed and output. Non-Volatile RAM could be used as a computer's main memory and serve the same purpose, but has always been slower for this purpose because of it structure. It can be done but is usually never done in consumer computing because the performance loss would be massive. We aren't concerned with processing, however. We are concerned only with storage.    TLDR, you are thinking of this Machine-In-A-Box as a standard computer with no secondary storage, IE a hard drive or jump drive. My assumption is that this is not so. I believe that the machine in these souped up ram chips is safe there even without power. I believe that these RAM chips are dual function, working both as main memory and secondary storage. As both RAM and like a giant chain of jump drives.

He's already shown interest in the Machine and now there is no reason to hide it from him as he's already be targeted for elimination by Samaritan. I also love how they showcased his resourcefulness in using the old pneumatic tube system for communication which had been all but forgotten, much like the subway repair station that the Machine guided Harold to. In contrast, Dominic, who is kind of the newer electronic age mob boss (with the video game money laundering, etc.), had to co-opt the mesh network, rather than thinking of using the forgotten technology on his own. There is a real closeness with the old age and a nostalgia for it that really defines Elias.

Samaritan didn't kill the Machine properly, it seems all of it's enemies are all going into dormancy, ready to rise again any time.    It's really impossible to tell how many targets Samaritan actually managed to take out during this 'correction'. Running an elimination op on over a hundred targets while simultaneously tracking and eliminating an older ASI sounds grandiose but is a course fraught with possibilities for failure. It just goes to show how Samaritan is impetuous and inferior."

PersonOfInterest,353qo9,pyr3,1 point,Thu May 7 14:48:29 2015 UTC,"This is a bad analogy. Well, actually, I suppose BB is a fine analogy if you consider how the villain protagonist comes out on top in the end. Here, as there, organized crime will go on regardless of who does what to stop it. The only real way to stop organized crime is twofold and unlikely: 1 - Stop demand for illegal goods and services. 2 - Create a situation where providing illegal goods and services is perceived as not being worth the risk. Both of these shows are based on real world concepts. Even if, in those shows, the infrastructure of organized crime had been completely annihilated, someone else would step in to fill the void. Because demand still exists. When there is still demand, and a high enough margin, someone will step into the void and provide that service.  Samaritan is proving that it doesn't quite get it. That it does have hubris and, as /u/burnerthrown says, impetuousness. It believes it is acting surgically and with purpose. It is playing with toy soldiers. There is much about the nature of people that it has yet to learn. I wonder if there's a way to use this against and all-seeing ASI..."
PersonOfInterest,353qo9,shinsaikou,2,Thu May 7 16:28:38 2015 UTC,"It's simple. Samaritan has shown that it uses it's omniscience in a blunt force manner. It deploys assets for maximum effect and neglects efficiency or tactical advantage. I maintain this is what happened with the Correction. That means it can be drawn out, since you can estimate what it's reaction will be to any opposition it is made aware of. Two things will be made obvious to Samaritan too late to adapt to: You cannot maintain secrecy using tactics like those, and it's resources are not unlimited. The first may or may not be a serious matter depending on if the Team wants to bring the public into the fight. But the latter is a death sentence. A multi-sided attack will tax the force beyond effectivity.  As what seemed like overwhelming resources stretch thinner, Samaritan's already glaring tactical shortcomings would multiply, more and more operations would fail, and eventually it would be rendered completely unable to retain control reverting too late to a defensive posture."
PersonOfInterest,353qo9,burnerthrown,1 point,Thu May 7 23:33:05 2015 UTC,"This. This. So much this.   Samaritan believes it's using a scalpel when it is in fact using a hammer. Samaritan either gets exposed or gets blackmailed with exposure, as I posited elsewhere. Samaritan may have done this initial ""hammer"" attack to try and get other outliers to make a play for the ""openings"" which have been created. The thing is, there's always the human chaos element. The Machine even accounted for certain completely random shit, case in point being random Fusco kissing Root in If-Then-Else. That sort of human fickleness can work on a macro level in more consequential matters. I'm totally with your thought process. I believe that it will either be actually going public or the threat of going public that will be Samaritan's undoing. It would be too much to hope for that The Correction just kicked over the anthill and there will be too many malefactors, outliers, and newly disloyal elements for Samaritan to realistically deal with. If The Correction is a long term strategy, we could see that sort of effect play out over time, however. Samaritan may have an ""Edward Snowden moment"" in the process of trying to eliminate all of its potential enemies."
PersonOfInterest,353qo9,shinsaikou,2,Fri May 8 02:10:59 2015 UTC,"I think Team Machine will be instrumental in this revelation to the public if it happens. They've always been the keepers of the secret of AI, but now the reasons for that no longer hold weight. The agents of the Machine killing to preserve it's secrecy was outweighed by the good it did the country, but Samaritan and Decima have done enough harm besides that to outweigh any benefit.    I think it could be a great, and thematic, turning point for the show when Finch can stand in front of the population and tell them ""I built it."""
PersonOfInterest,353qo9,burnerthrown,2,Fri May 8 02:25:24 2015 UTC,"organized crime will go on regardless of who does what to stop it   I've actually been thinking about this, and there's a possibility that we might see ""The Correction"" backfire in the next season. For example, one of the reasons that Elias was the better of two evils was to keep the ""seven crime families"" in-check. Did Samaritan assassinate them too? Or did Dominic and Elias keep its attention during that year of observation? Will we see a bit of chaos as the power structures of the underworld have been shaken up? Is Samaritan accounting for this, or will the writers use this as an example to show how young/""green"" Samaritan is?   It believes it is acting surgically and with purpose.   From the speech that Greer gave, it sounds like the idea is to just remove all people that will question (or rebel against) authority. That's quite a goal, but if this goal was achieved, then what people would rush to fill the gap in the black market?"
PersonOfInterest,353qo9,pyr3,1 point,Fri May 8 00:03:45 2015 UTC,"If both the guys are gone, I expect that the chaos in New York will figure into the main ""street-level"" plot. Even if Elias lives, things are going to be stirred up by virtue of the fact that people have seen weakness from Elias.   Samaritan can't eliminate all outliers. The sad fact is that there is almost always someone ready to be the opportunist. People will come out of the woodwork to do what Elias and Dominic were doing regardless of whether or not Elias lives or not. Maybe that's the point. To flush out more people with the potential to be deviants and also the people who would follow them. Samaritan wants to be the one guiding the human herd imperative. Anyone who follows outliers will not be forgiven. Samaritan will not accept the Nuremberg Defense. Maybe Samaritan really does get psychology. The thing is, not even The Machine can predict outcomes perfectly. How many other people are out there who are like Elias? And by that I mean, analogue men who are still trying to make it in the digital world. People who understand the value of relationships, even with people with different agendas from you. I think that is also a mistake that Samaritan is in the process of making. It's going all scorched earth just like Dominic was. There will be other people like Control who question what the fuck is going on because this kind of policy does not engender trust. Samaritan's actions will not be able to remain hidden for long. The threat of exposure may actually become leverage. Meh, I'm rambling..."

Also the hit and run, pretty sure that's unrelated to Fusco's group and pretty much part of the 100 corrections Samaritan did.

PersonOfInterest,3555dy,rflairfan1,4,Thu May 7 05:17:19 2015 UTC,"Anyday. Vigilance was organized by an Educated and highly sophisticated idealist who believed surveillance was evil and was ready to believe that the end justified the means. He was a revolutionary who could not be seen as a total villian. Also he was classy and confident.  Dominic is an illiterate (high school dropout), boorish drug dealing thug who thanks to the second amendment has guns and a gang of equally illiterate dope addict friends. No Class and certainly no refined ideology. Only ideology is to get rich by murdering the top bosses and murdering his rivals and rule the underworld.   No comparison really."

There was never any question as to Elias winning in the end, you could just tell, Elias was a survivor, even Dominic didn't expect to last long as the king.  Additionally, the whole Vigilance thing being a ploy by Greer to get Samaritan up and running was the perfect way to end that storyline.

After how invested we are in Elias, the rise of The Brotherhood would never be seen as a great thing by the audience. As mentioned elsewhere, I think The Brotherhood actually wins because it has the possibility of raising up a new head who may or may not learn from Dominic's mistakes. There's never going to be a Vigilance again as there never was a Vigilance really to begin with, it was always Greer's AstroTurf."

Also depends on how her story plays out and who's requires on set.  I mean it could be she doesn't pop up until episode 12.   But if you were to have her film one day a week from the start of filming. She could have enough scenes to cover a 3-4 episode arc by the time you actually got to that point in the show.
PersonOfInterest,353zl3,Sabeckaz,3,Thu May 7 16:04:34 2015 UTC,I don't think we'll see her return as a regular. Maybe she'll have a reaccurring role?
PersonOfInterest,353zl3,rflairfan1,2,Thu May 7 06:33:21 2015 UTC,"I have no children and I wish for none. But I have friends who do and when they had their kids they always said they didn't want to return to work. When they did it was very difficult for them. Even with 2nd, 3rd and 4th kids.   I of course don't know Sarah but I always wondered if it wasn't a knee-jerk reaction to just having twins, saying she didn't want to return for 2 years or if it was part of the plan. Say 2 years and then when she returns it's a surprise."

PersonOfInterest,354p75,still-at-work,3,Thu May 7 15:34:08 2015 UTC,"Finch succeeded in building an AI about half way through development.  He then spent the rest trying to build a compassionate AI. First he got it care for the admin, then taught it to care for others.   I don't know if the next part was by design or a happy accident but he also put lots of restrictions on the AI which gave it a sudu childhood. Forcing it to learn to grow and improve has been it's main weapon now. It has now learned how to remake itself but it never changed its main motivation - to help people - even when it would help in its fight against Samaritan.  It tried to get the team to go over the line with the senator but Finch denied it. It got the old spiderman speech of not taking the easy way out when you have so much power.   I have told friends and family that this TV show is an orgin story of a superhero. That super hero's name is 'The Man in the Suit' but it's not just one man. John is the point man but the hero is also Finch working behind the scenes and of course the Machine to be the superpower. You may think root is part of this, and she is but not directly. Root is part of the machine. She is not an admin as much as the analog interface.  While she is of course still her own person, she has also shift her emotions to be more in line with the AI.  She now views Finch with compassion as a father figure when she seemed to hate him when they first met. My guess is being in constant contact with the AI has made her become more inline to the machines positions. so you have the genius billionaire,  the world class fighter, and the superpower all in distinct individuals.  Look at how much like a superhero John became when he got god mode. He was basically unstoppable.  That was only combining two of the three powers onto one man. Root may be very intelligent, a good fighter and have direct access to the machine she is not on the same level as the Man in the Suit. The difference between Root with God Mode and Reece with God mode should show you why.  The Man in the Suit is the protagonist of the show, it just so happens to be split among at least two distinct people and a human/ai tag team."
PersonOfInterest,354p75,still-at-work,1 point,Thu May 7 16:01:41 2015 UTC,"An interesting perspective, we've got ourselves a ""holy trinity"" of sorts. Not to mention Root's attitude towards the machine has always been kind of almost religious devotion."
PersonOfInterest,354p75,pben,1 point,Thu May 7 18:16:51 2015 UTC,"Thats an interesting idea, lets run with it:  Father - Finch; Son/Savior - Reese; Holy Spirt - The Machine.  Root is a sort of reverse fallen angle. An angle that started out fallen and raised up to the 'good' side.  Though it's more of a trinity to make up a polytheism god: the machine gang (the above trinity) is a god of protection, Samaritan is a god of order. Samaritan has no distinct aspects just followers and servents.   First they ask for protection but it was sometimes messy so then the people turned to order and got their saftey but lost their freedom.  AIs as gods is a well worn scifi trope so it definitely fits. Plus it opens the door to new and different AIs that have different primary goals."
PersonOfInterest,354p75,I-rez,2,Thu May 7 19:01:00 2015 UTC,"I think that Samaritan is also learning.  In the past it was about mass control.  Now it has pulled back to selective targeting of the worst humans.  We all loved the gangster subplot but they were both evil and deserved targeting.  Control did blow up the ferry that crippled Finch, she deserved to get the hood.  Maybe Samaritan has learned a few things from the machine and is becoming a just god."
PersonOfInterest,354p75,pben,1 point,Thu May 7 12:23:12 2015 UTC,"Samaritan is not omnipotent and thus not a god. It's not even all knowing. Even if the limits of its capabilities are way above humans, they still exist."
PersonOfInterest,354p75,I-rez,1 point,Fri May 8 02:53:17 2015 UTC,"True, I was just using Root's phrase.  I still thing the next logical phase is the taming of Samaritan and exploring the problems of the rebuilt machine.  We have to get drama from somewhere for next season and mixing the good and bad sides might be one way the writers go.  If Samaritan retreats to only attacking the bad humans and lets the rest slide why do we need the machine to be rebuilt?"
PersonOfInterest,353e9a,OwenThePainter,9,Wed May 6 19:46:07 2015 UTC,"and then Reese, too, has the Machine in God Mode for the first time ever.    Someone needs to watch Season 2 finale again."
PersonOfInterest,353e9a,dnlsrl,3,Wed May 6 22:12:45 2015 UTC,"This is true even beyond season four, now that I think about it. Do you remember how the machine remained behind the scenes during in season 1, always providing nothing more than a number?  That was until ""ERROR: Continuity of operations compromised. Evaluating options..."" I think that was quite possibly its first moment of ""rewriting core protocols.""  Its strength is in its adaptability, and I think they are going to showcase that very well going into season five. One has to wonder though, how much self-tinkering will it do to itself before becoming evil. Is it only a matter of time?"
PersonOfInterest,353e9a,Bunchu,4,Thu May 7 00:53:58 2015 UTC,"Biggest missed opportunity: Dominic never meets Finch, and never gets his own ""Mr. Swift?!"" moment with him."

PersonOfInterest,353e9a,Kautkto,3,Thu May 7 09:47:29 2015 UTC,"They didn't, but some people have argued that Dominic must have been in the same class as Caleb in ""2πr"" because he once mentioned a maths teacher who talked about Pi."
PersonOfInterest,353e9a,Kautkto,2,Thu May 7 13:57:51 2015 UTC,"Many maths teachers talk about pi, but I do get your point. Perhaps they started to set up a side plot then gave up?"
PersonOfInterest,353e9a,pensee_idee,2,Thu May 7 19:39:34 2015 UTC,"I think it's ambiguous.  Dominic doesn't just say that his math teacher talks about pi, he basically quotes Finch's speech.    Finch intended his speech to be inspirational, and in particular, he intended it to inspire Caleb, but it's possible that he inspired Dominic too, and that Dominic became who he is, in part, because Finch helped him believe in himself.  On the other hand, Dominic seems like he's too old to have been in that class, and there's no one who looks even a little bit like him in the scene where Finch gives that talk.  I suppose by not having them meet, the writers can imply that Finch created Dominic without having to explicitly address the logical problems with that implication."

I've never gotten slightly bored with this series like I have with others, the walking dead being one of them. That's likely down to zombies being done to death.

I watch it as soon as it airs in the US as well - I have a US itunes account where I download it the next morning.  But I also watch it on channel 5 (the channel that shows POI in the UK) just because its on and I love the programme. They haven't even shown the S3 midseason arc yet. They constantly put off showing the programme and gave it no clear window of return this year (it was supposed to come back in january, then it was pushed to february, then march). They show it no respect. They barely advertise it. They also used to take 'midseason breaks' in the first two seasons for no reason instead of catching up with the US. It's really frustrating because after the first season they really did the programme no favours of gaining traction in the UK. None of my friends have heard of it. :("
PersonOfInterest,3527gn,man_in_the_suit,4,Wed May 6 16:42:07 2015 UTC,"Channel 5 always has and always will be a pretty shit TV channel, It's basically a free-to-air Sky Atlantic but never actually keeps up with what it's airing.  It'd be more suited to BBC - No ads or ITV with ads. It's completely do-able to be able to air right after the US broadcast too. See - Torchwood: Miracle Day (Albeit a Co-production between Starz and BBC)  A second possible issue here is Netflix readily have three seasons available on the UK Netflix and will likely have Season 4 far earlier than Channel 5 can air it."

PersonOfInterest,3527gn,your_mind_aches,4,Wed May 6 17:27:07 2015 UTC,"This is where they can change and improve, rather than keeping the show in it's existing format and milking 22-24 episodes a season from it and eventually watching it die out, cut the filler and have a 13 episode season with one major story arc panning out over the 13 episodes whilst keeping sub-plots active. More doesn't mean better, it never has. See Sherlock - BBC for a great example of how less can be better."
PersonOfInterest,3527gn,Genara7ion,9,Wed May 6 17:41:06 2015 UTC,"But wouldn't that mean lesser PoIs? The filler is what defines the title of the show. Not saying that I don't like the major arcs, but completely removing or undermining the subplots and the PoI format kinda goes against the spirit of the show.  Of course, if all of this can be neatly arranged in 13-15 episode seasons then I'll definitely be glad."
PersonOfInterest,3527gn,glider97,3,Wed May 6 18:00:09 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say so. The titular ""Person of Interest"" is Reese as defined in the pilot. Fans came up with the term ""POI"" for numbers."
PersonOfInterest,3527gn,your_mind_aches,3,Wed May 6 18:13:11 2015 UTC,"I guess Reese AKA the man in the suit was also considered a person of interest while the police was searching for him, but I think the name stood for the numbers. Person of interest because they didn't know if the person behind the number would turn out to be a victim or a perpetrator. It might have been intended to include also Reese but I think (and I'd guess it was intended) that it was a placeholder for the number, especially considering the intro."
PersonOfInterest,3527gn,eikeegimuu,2,Wed May 6 19:59:08 2015 UTC,"It would, but you could keep them active through sub-plots just a lot less of it. You'd get a far superior output as well as a consistent story arc continuing each episode. I couldn't really arrange it as I'm no screenwriter so this would all rely on a solid story for the 15 episodes and strong enough to keep people about till the finale.   Have the story arc include the numbers that are given so they tie in with the story all the way up to the finale. Doctor Who is good at this, each episode generally containing something that later becomes part of the bigger picture.   The idea itself is far more complicated than I've made out, It can be done but I'm no writer."
PersonOfInterest,3527gn,Genara7ion,3,Wed May 6 18:16:37 2015 UTC,"More definitely doesn't mean better. But I prefer Person of Interest in a 23 episode run.   And yes, I am a Sherlockian. I know all about it."
PersonOfInterest,3527gn,your_mind_aches,2,Wed May 6 18:13:44 2015 UTC,"More doesn't mean better, but nor does less -- it depends on the viewer.  Personally, I like the variety."
PersonOfInterest,3527gn,ab_emery,2,Wed May 6 22:05:15 2015 UTC,"I don't understand this necessity that less episodes = better.  It's simply not true.  Having one single major running story arc that is the main focus of the season is a horrible idea if you want to get more viewers.  It becomes impossible to miss just one episode, and still understand what's going on.  Filler episodes allow the casual fan to stay engaged, and give the hard core fan more time with the characters they love.  I wish reddit would stop saying that everything would be stellar 11/10 episodes when there's only thirteen episodes a season."

If CBS would make million because of syndication, it would matter less, but seeing as POI is WB owned, ad money is all CBS has. So 18-49 might even matter more then for other shows."
PersonOfInterest,3527gn,Metalbaswee,2,Wed May 6 16:49:54 2015 UTC,"Well, its a little more than that though. Syndication starts this fall and Netflix US starts this fall which gives the show a push and gives them some value for someone to pick them up with residual income.  I honestly believe CBS is terrible but even JJ Abrams said last week that if there was not a renewal from CBS that they will hopefully find a home elsewhere. Since Jonah Nolan has two shows in the works with HBO that could be an option. I believe they have a contingency, much like Finch did/does.  10 pm time slot killed the viewership and also if you look at live numbers, when CBS plays their games of not having the show air consistently POI loses 11-23% live viewership on the return episode. Terrible marketing also."

I was merely pointing out that Netflix is a viable alternative for PoI if (however slim the chances are) it gets cancelled.

PersonOfInterest,3527gn,Norci,2,Thu May 7 04:38:54 2015 UTC,Because netflix has been new to the series game.  It's still testing the waters regarding backing a series and putting it out there.

PersonOfInterest,352th6,eikeegimuu,9,Wed May 6 17:08:24 2015 UTC,How's it possible that the season finale hit the series low? Wouldn't normally more people be inclined to watch? Or are there that many people who on principle don't watch if a show hasn't been renewed? I'm mystified.  But POI had most viewers (though not in demo) for the time slot so that at least something.
PersonOfInterest,352th6,aysz88,5,Wed May 6 17:17:46 2015 UTC,"My guess - don't forget tons of viewers DVR it (IIRC If-Then-Else had 50% of its numbers come from DVR), and the springtime/good weather was eating into TV viewership numbers generally."
PersonOfInterest,352th6,SpottyRasang,3,Wed May 6 18:34:15 2015 UTC,"This is really disappointing. I wouldn't be surprised if season five were the last; hopefully they can get a full season out of it, and at least it'll let the show go out on top. Sucks to see this and The Good Wife doing so poorly ratings-wise."
PersonOfInterest,352th6,TheTenthDocter,4,Wed May 6 19:27:42 2015 UTC,I can't believe the season finale hit the series low  CBS and its audience doesn't deserve such a great show Its just too much for them they should stick to their lame procedurals and give this show to Netflix
PersonOfInterest,352th6,slashetsy,5,Wed May 6 17:30:15 2015 UTC,"Not to come off as a dick but you do realise that this show is a procedural at times? The number episodes are procedurals.  There are good shows on CBS that are procedurals.  Scorpion, Criminal Minds, The Mentalist (Rest in Peace), and numerous other shows are really really good procedurals in my honest opinion."

PersonOfInterest,352th6,john_gilpin,5,Wed May 6 18:49:39 2015 UTC,"FWIW, NCIS characters have grown greatly over the years. I mean, it's taken 10 years in some cases, but they have grown."
PersonOfInterest,352th6,hitmeaxou,1 point,Wed May 6 19:35:26 2015 UTC,if you could please help me understand - what is a procedural and what is serialized?
PersonOfInterest,352th6,TheTenthDocter,2,Thu May 7 12:23:09 2015 UTC,Procedural is a series or show where each episode or maybe 2 episodes involve a separate plot which will be the main focus of the week. There is little character development but it always has a  certain excitement.  For eg- Castle by NBC or Friends by NBC - always have a plot per episode or two episodes max. So if you miss one episode you dont lose anything much. Also if the series ends midway due to ratings cancellations - there is nothing great to lose.  Serials  are those where there is one plot over an entire season like 24 and if you miss one episode you actually will need to catch up otherwise you will not be able to take in the others and will always have questions.  POI was procedural over Seasons 1 - 3 but it became Serialized over Season 4 to involve too much of Samaritan. Like LOST people started losing interest as they always do when something is Serialized and when something is losing steam.

PersonOfInterest,352th6,Daantjedaan,0,Thu May 7 17:02:37 2015 UTC,"PoI is not a true procedural.  A procedural is a cookie cutter story template that can be applied to any genre, specifically cop & doc shows.  PoI usually adds a story twist, witty dialogue, and/or thought provoking meme to their procedural episodes.  Listing Scorpion and Criminal Minds as good procedurals only tells the public that you really have shitty taste in TV programs."
PersonOfInterest,352th6,john_gilpin,2,Wed May 6 21:10:25 2015 UTC,"Insulting my taste in shows is rather rude, if your going to write a comment at least be neutral or nice. I wasn't being hostile when I wrote my comment.  I was only listing the shows I've seen on CBS, other shows that escaped me in the heat of the moment are Chuck, Psych, Elementary, White Collar, Forever, and Castle. All good shows in my opinion.  I've only seen a few episodes of Scorpion I thought it looked decent but it sounds like people don't like it. If Criminal Minds was shitty I don't think it would've lasted that long. You have the right to your own opinion but don't go belittling others opinions.   Person of Interest has procedural episodes. While they do a unique spin on it, so did shows before it and so will shows after it. As of late they should just become a serialized drama instead of having procedurals especially with this AI war. It would probably be best for the show if they did. In my opinion.  If I have shit taste in television programs then why do I like Person of Interest?"

If they positively wanted him dead, they wouldn't have left that ambiguity in - they wouldst just got him with a head shot like they did Mini. It's entirely plausible that he too one in the lung or something and can come back. But it's also pretty easy to just let the death stick if they want to. I imagine it's something they'll decide on at the writers retreat before next season."
PersonOfInterest,350a1p,Demon4SL,42,Wed May 6 04:04:45 2015 UTC,"Upon further reflection, I have one more thing to say on this death - with Elias' passing, this is officially the end of the show's story arcs involving realistic crime stories - mafia, crime organizations, police corruption. Everything has come to an end in favor of complete focus towards the Sci-Fi and futuristic tech setting involving The Machine and Samaritan.  It was a slow build-up, but this is it guys."

PersonOfInterest,350a1p,beardlovesbagels,15,Wed May 6 03:00:47 2015 UTC,He was one of my favs too.  Good actor.  Sucks to see him go down like that though.

PersonOfInterest,350a1p,SuperpoweredNutball,5,Wed May 6 03:03:30 2015 UTC,"Hm, I didn't think of that.  Elias' encounter with Simmons was awesome sauce, especially after Simmons asked him if he was going to kill him, but Elias goes, ""No, my friend is going to kill you. I'm just going to watch."""
PersonOfInterest,350a1p,ariyahvansh,4,Wed May 6 04:53:03 2015 UTC,"Definitely one of my favourite Elias moments. In honour of our beloved fallen outlier, here's the scene in which he has Anthony kill Simmons to avenge Carter's death.   Man, I am going to miss Elias so much. I was actually clutching my face and screaming silently in horror when he was shot-- even though I had braced myself ages ago for his possible demise."

Control is going to have one of those, ""Why the ever loving fuck would you ever help me?"" lines and Root is going to say something sarcastic like, ""Oh how the times have changed"" and then Control will be both the darker side of Team Machine and the key to getting government support for the 'war' on Samaritan."
PersonOfInterest,350a1p,stagfury,17,Wed May 6 02:31:21 2015 UTC,"Martine thinks herself as a badass, but I bet she secretly wishes she's half as cool as Control and every night just cries herself to sleep knowing that such feat is impossible.

PersonOfInterest,350a1p,Forcepath,16,Wed May 6 03:07:54 2015 UTC,Dunno.  I feel like she would side with Team Machine at this point.  Hell she suggested going back to The Machine in the episode.  Opportunity awaits.
PersonOfInterest,350a1p,shinsaikou,13,Wed May 6 03:09:58 2015 UTC,"She is an ally at this point, a potential asset. I think she's on ice in the same place they're keeping Shaw. I am disappointed that she didn't give Greer a ""shut up, Hannibal"" moment by putting one between his eyes... She got played, right down to being foolish enough to listen to the entire sermon."
PersonOfInterest,350a1p,Alinosburns,4,Wed May 6 03:15:18 2015 UTC,We're gonna see her again. They would have made a point of killing her otherwise.  I have a feeling that we'll see Brainwashed Control.  Mainly because of the Irony of someone with that codename.  Which can lay some of the groundwork for whatever they do with Shaw. Without actually needing shaw to show up as the brainwashed participant. Since we have no idea how available Sarah Shahi will be with her kids now.
PersonOfInterest,350a1p,Demon4SL,13,Wed May 6 04:47:21 2015 UTC,"It's likely that she's still alive - Greer heavily implied that he intends to do to her what she wanted to do to him, which is to not kill but to torture via no contact from any aspects of the outside world and slowly wither away. That said, if she does appear again, there's no way of knowing when and how it will happen."
PersonOfInterest,350a1p,Classic_Wingers,6,Wed May 6 08:41:38 2015 UTC,Hopefully she survives the finale tonight. Greer doesn't seem fazed right now. Part of me wonders whether we will see Shaw before the show ends for the year.

So I think that Harold will tell him some/all of it either in the off season, or in an early episode next season.  Then Caleb will help them construct a better, stronger, faster Machine, capable of taking down Samaritan."

Things I would like to see more of in season 5 :  -More songs (Season 1&2 had many songs playing near the end of the episodes and it added a lot to them. For example, Sinnerman, Ne Me Quite Pas, She's Long Gone etc...)  -Better gunfights (We've seen gunfights and the special affects get a bit lazy IMO)  With that being said, that was one of the best episodes and I can't wait to watch season 5. Sad to see  my favorite character die however (Elias). I understand the crime war was finished, but I was hoping the writers could have tied him into The Machine plot.

""If your number's up, we'll find you."" Well, I guess they found her!  I omitted to write about last week's episode because I was still chewing over its awesomeness. I'll say now though, season four has been an absolute pleasure.  Finally seeing Control confront Greer and the Samaritan program was amazing. I'm thinking Shaw and Control will probably encounter each other, team up and bust out together. A shame Grice went though, he was pretty much the only person Control could 'trust'.  So much to love about this episode, God-mode, Thornhill, the fax machine, The Machine and Finch's talk... not gonna lie, I could feel my eyes widen and tear up a little. I think I stopped breathing too. Was half expecting a Samaritan goon to misfire and hit one of the laptops, disrupting the compression and killing The Machine >_<  I'm a little worried about the fact they only transferred the core heuristics. Like, this is the computer equivalent of memory loss! She might wake up and not remember anything. Hopefully that data company Thornhill owns is still running and maybe they made a backup of the memories? We'll see.  I don't think I'll survive the wait to season five.

PersonOfInterest,350a1p,AyoGeo,6,Wed May 6 02:23:57 2015 UTC,"Yahweh:        This article is about the national god of the Iron Age kingdoms of Israel and Judah. For other uses, see Yahweh (disambiguation). See also: Tetragrammaton, Jehovah, and God in Abrahamic religions   Yahweh  (/ˈjɑːhweɪ/, or often /ˈjɑːweɪ/ in English; Hebrew: יהוה‎), was the national god of the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah,  and appears to have been unique to those two kingdoms.  His origins are debated but there is widespread acceptance that he did not originate with Israel.  His name may have begun as an epithet of El, head of the Bronze Age Canaanite pantheon,  but the earliest plausible references to it place him among the nomads of the southern Transjordan.   In the oldest biblical literature Yahweh is a typical ancient Near Eastern ""divine warrior"" who leads the heavenly army against Israel's enemies.  He became the main god of the northern Kingdom of Israel and patron of its royal dynasty.  Over time, Yahwism became increasingly intolerant of rivals, and the royal court and temple promoted Yahweh as the god of the entire cosmos, possessing all the positive qualities previously attributed to the other gods and goddesses.   With the work of Second Isaiah (the theoretical author of the second part of the Book of Isaiah) towards the end of the Babylonian exile (6th century BC), the very existence of foreign gods was denied, and Yahweh was proclaimed as the creator of the cosmos and the true god of all the world.

Decima knew Ernest Thornhill was a machine agent because it targeted his car for a drone strike way back in S2. Nobody, nobody? thought to check out ""Thornhill Utilities"" ? Samaritan didn't think that was worth investigating?  The machine could have picked literally any other name and I'd be fine with it, but the same 'guy' who bought all the payphones to usurp your attempted hi-jack of the machine the first time around? You don't think it's weird he owns a significant portion of the major powerline junctions in the country?  You don't think that 'man' and his 'corporation' shouldn't be under constant scrutiny? You can send an agent to infiltrate ISA, you can mobilize an entire anonymous front to carry out a false-flag attack on US soil, but Thornhill Utilities? You can't turn one of those guys putting the boxes up on poles?"
PersonOfInterest,3527co,irobeth,8,Wed May 6 15:10:38 2015 UTC,"I think that Thornhill Utilities was a perfectly spoofed company to prevent Samaritan from finding anything suspicious.

That is, Team Machine outmatched and on the run/in hiding, Samaritan victorious, the world taking a turn for the dystopian, or utopian depending on your perspective. This whole season I was frustrated with Team Machine's complete lack of initiative in the battle against Samaritan. Okay, you figured out Samaritan's recruitment process. How about, you know, doing something to interrupt it? Oh, I guess you're just gonna let them bolster their ranks with geniuses. After a season's worth of that, a finale like this is a little hard to swallow. I really do not look forward to another season of Greer winning.  If they ever conclude this Samaritan arc, I don't know what the writers could come up with that could ever match it in gravitas. But I do know they can't keep dragging it out forever. Come on guys, you had 22 episodes and all you could do was circle back to square one?  It was an intense episode, and the Pink Floyd song at the end was a great music moment.

Hell, if you have the main characters standing around idly when they're being shot at, that completely negates tension.   It would have been far better to have saved Martine for this episode, and have her and, like, 5 guys show up to take on the Machine gang. Okay, maybe first have a dozen guys come in, and Reese God-modes them in a blackout because yeah, that was kinda awesome. But then choreograph an actual fight while the machine is talking to Harold.

The last one might be interesting but not when it's archived in such a contrived fashion + there's always got to be some things that stand the test and constitute a guiding star and Nathan's positive impact has been that important to Harold."
PersonOfInterest,352jwx,eikeegimuu,1 point,Wed May 6 17:26:18 2015 UTC,"In the same way Greer believes he is doing good for the world, Nathan also would have done what he did believing it was for the better of humanity.   Climbing into his car and confronting him at gun point, she stated that Nathan was afraid and stressed about what they had built, and that he was killed by the machine.   If Nathan is dead (we watched him be pronounced as such, to ISA's content), Decima is out of his control, but the very last thing he did before he died was attempt to reveal the corruption controlling Finch's creation, and I think either that action drove Corwin to find someone interested in completing his vision, or Nathan directly sought out people who could help. Ingram dying made Corwin go into hiding (part of this may have been due to Finch's harassment), and when she was found dead (via Root), we discover she had a Decima RFID chip.  This entire series is about something created for good being used for ambiguous ends, on both fronts (Samaritan and NL/Research). Nathan was prepared to betray his country's intelligence agencies for what he saw as the good of the people. I don't think he intended what Samaritan has decided, and if Greer is Samaritan's handler, he has let it run rampant. I just think he had a pivotal role in founding Decima as a ""last hope"" response to the abuse of the NL program.  Ingram is also the connection to Claypool and Samaritan, assuming Harold's true identity was unknown to Decima (they all were friends at MIT). Granted, he was demented and spouting off about classified intel he shouldn't have and that attracted Control's attention, but Vigilance already knew about the tapes before she did."
PersonOfInterest,352jwx,eikeegimuu,4,Wed May 6 17:29:24 2015 UTC,The show hasn't been afraid to bring in new players so I'm more inclined to think that any gaps will eventually filled in but the show will not circle back and change Nathan's “essence”.

His essence hadn't ever really shifted in my eyes, he's always wanted a kind of 'custodian' for the people.  He was, at the very least, ready to kill a guy early on in the CONTINGENCY days, we saw him approach a non-relevant perp with a handgun.  When Finch told him the machine saved lives, he said it didn't save ""enough""."
PersonOfInterest,352jwx,TomSmash,5,Wed May 6 18:33:48 2015 UTC,I think decima is technically dissolved at this point. Or at least Greer isn't with it and Samaritan is it's own thing

PersonOfInterest,352jwx,oldschoolguy77,5,Wed May 6 19:03:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly, outside of a completely yet-to-be-introduced character I think Nathan is one of the only characters in the show who has the potential to be Greer's boss. First of all is because of the old tv trope, if you didn't actually see the body, they're not dead, in addition to your reasons  Another thing I think worth bringing up has to do with Nathan, finch, and Arthur? (guy from warehouse 13 who created Samaritan). I find it a pretty big coincidence that the two people in the world who had the potential to create an AI both happened to be best friends with Nathan. Just makes me wonder if Nathan brought more to the table than just Finch's public face.  In the end I think I would prefer a completely new character to be Greer's boss, the writer's could write Nathan back into the story if they really wanted to and by not showing his body I suspect they were keeping that avenue open. Nathan being a bad guy would seem really cliche to me, it would however open the avenue for a lot of finch character development."
PersonOfInterest,352jwx,iBasit,5,Wed May 6 19:20:23 2015 UTC,"First of all is because of the old tv trope, if you didn't actually see the body, they're not dead, in addition to your reasons   Except we did see a body. Whether or not it was actually Nathan, we don't know, but it was convincing enough for both Harold and ISA. We've heard twice about his funeral, but only from Corwin and his son, Will Ingram. Nothing's been shown of it yet.  Nathan, Finch, and Claypool were all in the same MIT class and studied the same things - this is why it seems coincidental, but they both worked for the government at one point to create a candidate for Northern Lights."
PersonOfInterest,352jwx,Blitmen,2,Wed May 6 19:29:18 2015 UTC,"It would not make sense for him to be behind Decima.  Why would he kill his best friend to make a point?  You'd ruin the entire show if this is true.  I do believe there is a higher power and that power is the people running Samaritan and giving commands to everyone.  Everytime you see Samaritan say something that's coming from his superiors not a computer.  Greers people are about misdirection and what better way for his superiors to hide behind a supposed AI so when it's all blown out into the media, Greers people just have to shut down Samaritan, slink away and pretend they never existed since it was all sanctioned by the Governement."

GREG PLAGEMAN | [Laughs] We have been sitting on that one for a while. We actually tried it in another episode and were like, “No, it’s too good. We have to save it for something huge.” But that was Floyd, the real thing. We actually had to write those guys a letter to get their permission; it was pretty cool.   Here it briefly mentions it.  Edit: Not that it says much though!"

PersonOfInterest,350nan,Reese3019,1 point,Wed May 6 07:04:42 2015 UTC,"Better than The Wall, imo. Rick Wright's keyboards worked magic on that entire album. Something The Wall was missing, as much as I love that album. There's something that happened when Gilmour and Wright got that synergy of theirs going...  magic. There's no better word for it. Echoes from Meddle is another favorite. The switch-off between keyboard and guitar solos, the harmony of their singing. It was what made Pink Floyd's sound unique."
PersonOfInterest,350nan,jankisa,2,Wed May 6 22:35:43 2015 UTC,"Dark Side is No. 1 for me, but Wish You Were Here is No. 2. I love The Wall, but I always felt it could have been scaled down a bit. I know that's kind of the point of the album, to tell an epic story, but there are a couple elements that make it feel disjointed for brief periods. Of course, it always recovers nicely.  But Wish You Were Here has everything, including the title track that might be the best folk song/ballad ever written. And if you wanted to showcase exactly what Pink Floyd was about, ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"" in full would be it. There are other, better individual songs in their discography, but Diamond has everything that made Pink Floyd what it was.  Music is such an important part of storytelling, and I think that's why it's so important to Person of Interest. They could really butcher the process by picking just popular songs (so many soapy primetime dramas do that). Instead, Nolan and Plageman have the perfect ear for what music the show requires. It's phenomenal."

There was no bomb, just evidence suggesting there was one to see what Control would do. Since Control acted in the manner she did, she got ""corrected"" - along with Grice and her colleague in Operations. A few less deviants for Samaritan to contend with from May 6 forward."

PersonOfInterest,3510kq,oolongtea1369,15,Wed May 6 13:10:58 2015 UTC,Iirc the purpose of it was to help suss out who among those in the know in control's group might get in the way of samaritan's agenda. It wasn't just to test control but also to see who she might call on or turn to for help. Greer thanked her for leading them to those people.

When Samaritan found the machine's location that danger was obviated. John was activated again in the basement, when he took his earwig back from the Brotherhood goon and the machine started feeding him firing vectors Root-style. I must comment that John's combat experience makes this much more potent than it is with Root, his target elimination rate is almost too rapid to follow."
PersonOfInterest,3510kq,burnerthrown,6,Wed May 6 08:11:14 2015 UTC,That was only temporary when the Machine reset due to the virus. God Mode went offline for John and Root towards the end of that episode.

PersonOfInterest,351bvc,Try_Another_Please,2,Wed May 6 12:34:50 2015 UTC,"I think it was a great finale honestly. I mean a lot of long running mysteries and plot lines were finished here. Controls allegiance. Samaritan full control and destruction of the machine (for now), end of the crime war and later the leaders themselves assuming Elias died, reveal of where the machine was, Reese in god mode, characterization for the machine and Samaritan for almost the first time, etc. a lot of very very important things that have been built up culminated in this episode. I'm not sure what else a finale should be if not that"
PersonOfInterest,351bvc,shinsaikou,1 point,Wed May 6 19:05:58 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way. I feel like... we were told that the Team would get some kind of win here, but at great cost. I'm just not seeing it. We have Machine-In-A-Box, the newly converted ""Machinite"" Control in Samaritan's custody, and Elias is likely dead - removing The Team's connection to organized crime, likely to cause a net rise in crime. I am also amused that as part of Samaritan's correction - which was so blatantly going to be a surgical, nigh invisible removal of deviants that it wasn't even worthy of mention in earlier theory posts of mine on this subreddit - it believed that offing the leaders of organized crime would help put an end to it. Samaritan seems to either not understand how complex an issue the reason for the existence of organized crime is, or is just tackling this problem incrementally. Even the latter option seems unlikely. You get organized crime because people want illegal goods and services and because economic disparity creates groups of people willing to work in the dangerous ways necessary to provide said goods and services. Samaritan has only created a power vacuum in New York's underworld. Perhaps this was done on purpose in order to remove from The Team one potential place to hide. Considering Carl Elias is actually dead, The Team can't use him as a resource for rebuilding. The few friends our team does have do not have a great deal of influence. I'm expecting a change to our format until The Machine is reborn - The Team will be seeking out old numbers, likely people who haven't had a second appearance since they were first aided by The Team. I feel like the first several episodes of next season will be the reverse of what this show has normally been: As The Team can't help any new numbers, it must seek aid from the old ones. It has done so in the past - doctors to patch them up comes to mind - but never on a level with so much at stake."

PersonOfInterest,350oqk,Spider_Riviera,6,Wed May 6 03:45:52 2015 UTC,Five seasons is a generally healthy run for a show like Person of Interest. It all depends on how much more of this universe the creators want to explore.

PersonOfInterest,355dg5,john_gilpin,2,Thu May 7 06:26:52 2015 UTC,Really? I think Samaritan is the arch nemesis of the Machine and it makes little sense to be able to defeat such a powerful AI within 1 season.
PersonOfInterest,355dg5,pranau97,-1,Thu May 7 07:07:29 2015 UTC,"but it makes sense for samaritan to kick the machines ass for an entire year????? of course samaritan can be defeated in a single season of 23 episodes. HR was defeated in 3, Elias in 2, Govt in 6 - so Samaritan cannot be defeated in 24??"
PersonOfInterest,355dg5,pranau97,3,Thu May 7 08:15:08 2015 UTC,"The HR arc was built over 2 seasons and only the final showdown took place over 3 episodes. Also, HR and Elias are just side arcs and if they can be given so much importance, I think Samaritan deserves at least 2 seasons of story. Besides, this is an AI created after the Machine and it is definitely more powerful than the Machine. It makes sense that Samaritan can kick the Machine's ass as it can use the data it collects from all that surveillance more efficiently than the Machine."
PersonOfInterest,355dg5,micpop3,3,Thu May 7 08:33:06 2015 UTC,"well, imho that is the dullest opinion here. And trully American I must add - we must win. Maybe this is another reason for another season - we must ensure happy end. And the ratings always drop - it's because the show is aired 4th year. for most people it is way too long to care. it aint procedural where 1 episode is one story, such shows have 10 season and more (like CSI's). Great show tend to have less and less watchers as they go. for example Fringe, (let's say) Lost, Dexter and so on and so on. The show is great and it balances well the minor victories of TM to major loses they suffer. And winning against Samaritan will mean the end of the show.   It's not Naruto or DBZ where one saga ends and even bigger foe appears ALL the time. What can be another arch after defeating rival ""god""?"
PersonOfInterest,355dg5,micpop3,-2,Thu May 7 07:20:52 2015 UTC,How is it that great shows have less and less watchers as they go. Then how are they great shows? Shouldnt great shows get more and more watchers as they go? Are you telling me that if a movie grosses less and less in the box office - it is a terrific movie?   What about Friends - which had huge ratings throughout its 10 seasons. Big Bang Theory - which actually saw rising ratings through its 8 seasons. Castle which has had constant ratings through Seasons 1 - 7 (never more than 1.1 million viewers for a single season). These are also great shows.   POI has lost 2.96 million viewers in a single season. They lost 0.83 million from Season 1 (Avg) to Season 2 (Avg) and lost 1.0 Million from Season 2 (Avg) to Season 3 (Avg). Now they lost almost 3 million viewers for a single season which is 3 times the normal.
PersonOfInterest,355dg5,hitmeaxou,1 point,Thu May 7 08:13:30 2015 UTC,"what you did here is compared POI which is a sci-fi to Friends or procedural where overarching story is a romance (castle). yup their ratings grow. Sopranos grew overall too.  look at shows similar to POI, like Fringe - 1st season over 10m, 5th season just over 4m. Or Lost from season 1 15,7m to season 6 10,1m.  Those are the shows you should compare POI with. not some watch-and-go casual like Friends that when you skip an episode nothing really happens, or where you dont need to remember that something happened few seasons ago.  What I am saying that shows that require attention tend to drop in ratings cause people need to pay more and more attention and at one point they just say ""ah, screw it, either way i have no idea what's going on""  yes they lost viewers because now they focused on one storyline rather than every week procedurals. So if you are soo good with research give me statistics of how many cases of the week per season compare to the loss of viewers per season  And also I dont want to be offensive but this isnt the show for everyone, and not everyone will get hyped. people who got hyped say its great. and stay loyal, people who just wanted to see what is this show had already left the hype-train."
PersonOfInterest,355dg5,soggy_potato,2,Thu May 7 08:35:22 2015 UTC,"i dunno. i kinda enjoyed this season a bit more than 3 or 1. i am worried that the show may be cancelled because until now there is no news of renewal and some guys actually say that since this is not a cbs produced series and is produced by fox, the cancellation is even likelier.   you say the right things but text it wrongly. we all want samaritan to be destroyed and we all hate that team machine is put to the wall. but it is more realistic this way and trust me ...trust me that revenge will be much sweeter when after all this struggle - that arrogant greer will be put in his place.  by the way team machine did have wins. through all the struggle they have saved the machine - three of them againsgt more than a hundred samaritan operatives, and the so called god and greer right under their nose. they killed martine and avenged shaw...  revenge is best when it is cold...so lets hope for a season 5."
PersonOfInterest,355dg5,soggy_potato,3,Thu May 7 08:22:45 2015 UTC,This was probably the best and most consistent season yet. Samaritan is the final threat for the show. I don't see where they can go after it. Ratings are declining across the board. This season still has the highest ratings in its time slot.
PersonOfInterest,355dg5,Sabeckaz,-1,Thu May 7 07:04:58 2015 UTC,Losing 3 million viewers from the last season is no joke. The first 6 episodes had 10 million viewers on an average but then it fell to around 8 million. The finale had the fewest viewers in the season. This never ever happens.

PersonOfInterest,355dg5,Sabeckaz,1 point,Thu May 7 08:50:56 2015 UTC,I have a feeling that samaritan was gonna be destroyed in season 5 no matter what was happening. You can have your own opinion of the season but using the ratings to support your argument is flawed; referencing previous season finales ratings as a comparison isn't fair game because most serialized shows audiences tend to dwindle each season. (Quick added note if CBS told WB what to do all the time the show would most likely still be a procedural number of the week show)
PersonOfInterest,355dg5,Sabeckaz,1 point,Thu May 7 07:29:55 2015 UTC,Are you saying that S5 might be the final season of POI?
PersonOfInterest,355dg5,hitmeaxou,1 point,Thu May 7 07:37:35 2015 UTC,All of CBS' shows are tanking even the big ones like NCIS. So I'm not worried I feel like CBS has bigger fish to fry like the fact TGW went fractional and how the already renewed MS hit a 1.0 (?) in its first season finale. My biggest fear is just them moving it to Friday/Sunday really.
PersonOfInterest,355dg5,PortgasXStarjun,1 point,Thu May 7 08:08:16 2015 UTC,ratings always indicate how a show is received by audiences. thats why they are there in the first place. the show which averaged 13.0 million users in the first season and second season and 11 million users in the third season suddenly drops to 8.5 million in the fourth season - this is not by any standards good.  people do care about ratings and the nielsens.
PersonOfInterest,355dg5,eikeegimuu,1 point,Thu May 7 08:06:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, I agree that the drop isn't good but I still think it's less about the quality of the show and more about people not grasping either what's going on or perhaps getting a little bored in the first x minutes and  dropping off (because I think you'll agree with me the start wasn't too engaging). Either way whatever the show does next season the ratings will either drop or stay level, you can't expect a rise in viewership of a heavily serialized show on it's 90th episode and no amount of team machine kicking butt would change that."

PersonOfInterest,351ok9,Aimless_Drifter,5,Wed May 6 11:06:36 2015 UTC,"If they get renewed I'll be excited to see how it plays out as one constant of the series will be absent this time around; they'll no longer be receiving numbers.  Harold will have a new fire inside him. He's doubted the actions of his creation for years even so far as to say it's nothing like it was when he made it. When it addressed him as father last night, and questioned its own choices, something stirred in him, that instinctual need for a parent to protect their child. Harold is going to want to bring the machine back like never before, and I think the writers have set up the foundations for that to work.  Control for example. She may be going somewhere dark, but she's still alive for now and already stated in this episode she'd vote for blackbox over samaritan. If the team saves her somehow or if she gets free, she will likely be their key to the government feeds."
PersonOfInterest,351ok9,Yveris,5,Wed May 6 12:19:58 2015 UTC,"My guess is that Finch and Root will spend the first episodes or the first half of the season programming and uploading The Machine (mid-season finale, maybe?). Perhaps this will lead to a graphics update for the MPOVs?  There will be no numbers for a while, so that probably means a very serialized beginning of the season. I'm also curious about what this means for Reese. Are their alternative identities still active or do Team Machine have to hide? Can he go back to being Homicide Detective Riley and what, investigate deaths after the fact? That doesn't sound like something he would be happy with.  A mission to save Shaw and/or Control?  And did Elias die or not? If he didn't, how will he fit in the new world order?  Fusco will wonder what the hell is going on, and Greer will get a cat."

I guess our team will have to ask help from other numbers and allies such as Arthur, Caleb , Leon, Harper, Zoe, Logan, Root's hacker buddies, to rebuild the Machine.   I guess Caleb will be an important character in next season. He's got money, space and infrastructure to help the team.  Also, if the government switches back to using The Machine then Samaritan will go rogue. If this does happen then I guess it will be in season finale and sixth season will deal with rogue Samaritan. But its too early to be sure.  As for Shaw, I hope she comes back by mid season finale."
PersonOfInterest,351ok9,rockyrakster,2,Wed May 6 13:45:54 2015 UTC,The first half will deal with rebuilding The Machine and bringing back Shaw. During the second half Team Machine will attack Samaritan and destroy it or at least finally win some battles against it.

A more cleverly distributed...New rules hardcoded (Root likely play a role.. But Harold has the final say)... I hope Machine has back up of it's memories somewhere out there...They needed to loaded back.. Else it's a new machine all together.. The difference between Samaritan and the Machine is roughly 3 years of training from Harold, Chess, Blackjack , Moral training... If We do not have the memories ... No time for Harold to train all the good things he thought .. The memories has to be somewhere First half of season 1 , while Harold builds the machine... Root goes hunting for memories... John and Fusco fight crime as normal cops I expect a new story arc to start... Since we concluded the mafia story line.. And Samaritan story line likely to end next season..

I think first couple of episodes we will see Harold and Root rebuilding machine, while Reese and Fusco doing their cop work. Imagine this in season mid finale: team machine caputred in new samaritan hq, along with control, Shaw. They are captured with machine in the briefcase, and samaritan knows that, and of course, cocky as he is, he orders to connect machine in order to destroy it, they open briefcase, connect it, we see Greer smiling, we see different images with samaritan, and then quietley Voodoo Child begins to play in background, samaritan sees some errors, threats, Greer looks concerned, while Harold says that he forgot to say that he rebuild the machine, and it will destroy samaritan. At that moment we get heavy guitar intro before vocals, we see samaritan and machine on split sceens, and episode ends there. I think that would be the best scene in series. What do you think?  Maybe its too much, but imagine that kind of scene with Hendrix playing in background, like they did with most of episodes in season 2, and ending season 4 (maybe more, i  dont remember). One more thing I think that control will kill Greer."
PersonOfInterest,351ok9,rpawson5771,0,Thu May 7 10:46:00 2015 UTC,They'll squash samaritan within the first half of the season and the latter half will deal with Shaw is my guess (or I'm hoping at least)
PersonOfInterest,351ok9,whitewater2,-2,Wed May 6 11:30:01 2015 UTC,i dont think there will be a season 5. the show will be getting cancelled in a few days time unless it is picked up by netflix.   the ending made me think this......

PersonOfInterest,351d3c,error8007ee2,2,Wed May 6 18:50:08 2015 UTC,Wouldn't that be a little offensive? Just a little bit like wondering whether the brother is steering things.

PersonOfInterest,350ox3,ChicagoIce,2,Wed May 6 03:48:34 2015 UTC,"I'm saddened that this episode established a series low for ratings and audience. The story just doesn't seem to be connecting with people, which is too bad because it is so good. The season was admittedly a little uneven (especially in the second half), and I get the sense that the writers were sent scrambling a but due to Sarah Shahi's departure and plotting that into the season. But overall, the show consistently delivers some very smart and interesting stories.    I've long been one to tut-tut at those worried about cancellation or ratings. For the first time, I'm getting the sense that Season Five may end up being the final season. Regardless of whether it is or not, I hope the next season continues to deliver quality entertainment."
PersonOfInterest,350ox3,rpawson5771,2,Wed May 6 22:37:26 2015 UTC,"LOTS of spoilers ahead.  It....actually, it was just 'ok' for me. I felt we were promised great plot twists and unexpected 'wow' moments, but even the parts with action seemed to be slow, predictable and...sure enough, Reese had his 'plot armor' on the whole time.   Why wouldn't the bad guys outside just start shooting the door when the smoke appeared? They just stood there, like 23 of them, all armed, and let a single guy fire off a bunch of smoke grenades and blind them. 23 guns going off in 1 direction would take care of that, darkness or no. I am so. So glad Fusco is still alive. Had a mini-heart attack when the truck hit the car. But really? Once again, he barely played a role--and once again, he's nowhere near the action, or with the team when anything goes down. Nothing for him has changed. He's been pretty stagnant all season. Do something with this guy! I'm no tech expert but...but the explanation about the Machine existing in the city's power grid seemed wrong. It seemed extremely farfetched and silly. I liked the moment between the Machine and Finch, though. The slow-mo walking TOWARDS the horde of bad guys shooting at the, with guns blazing moment? Seriously!? Yeah, I know, it's cool, but I thought Person of Interest prided itself above those cheap CSI: Miami shots. There are dozens of people shooting at 4 of them. They're 30 feet away. Bullets are just whizzing by them, and I'm sure in season 5, ep. 1, we'll see 2 dozen baddies on the ground with Reese and Root standing there, guns smoking. Yep.  So. Much. Plot armor.  All in all, this was the worst season finale for me. The Elias/Dominic ending was anti-climactic--why was Fusco even there? Just to exist or something? That scene would have been perfectly fine with or without him. So many better places Fusco could be. And why. The hell. Was there such tiny police escort/presence transporting the ringleaders of New York's most notorious criminal organizations? That calls for like 6 cars, a SWAT team and maybe a small tank.   It wasn't a very well written episode. It was exciting, but it just took the 'look, Samaritan is winning!' trope and bashed us over the head with it, again. And again. Surprise twist! Samaritan outsmarted everyone. Like it did last episode. And the episode before. And the one before that....  Man, there'd better be a Season 5."
PersonOfInterest,350ox3,erayachi,3,Wed May 6 04:19:07 2015 UTC,"I'm no tech expert but...but the explanation about the Machine existing in the city's power grid seemed wrong. It seemed extremely farfetched and silly. I liked the moment between the Machine and Finch, though.   Powerline networking is a real thing. However in your defense real-world power-line networking has a lot of bandwidth and latency issues that would make it a less-than-ideal choice for a system like the Machine.   However, I'm willing to suspend disbelief on that point - I thought the power grid idea was clever and I don't expect Hollywood writers to be fully educated on the technical details of an obscure piece of technology that's hardly ever used."

PersonOfInterest,350ox3,Z4T,7,Wed May 6 05:16:30 2015 UTC,"you complain about plot armor but then thank everything that Fusco lives. Reese and Finch are the show, if they die, the shows probably ending.   The show pretty much spells out why fusco is still alive. You complain that fusco had no role, without realizing that if he had played more of a role he would have been sniped along with Elias and Dominic. I don't know why the 'samaritan winning' seems silly to you. You complain about bad writing, but you desperately want them to pull a win out of their ass.   That would be bad writing."
PersonOfInterest,350ox3,Yveris,2,Wed May 6 04:49:25 2015 UTC,"The reflexes of John was really quick and he shot them very quickly in seconds. The guys were stunned when the lights went out and a single guy actually began firing back...and you cant fire blindly in smoke....you simply have no clue where you are firing and you may actually hit each other. Agreed. Fusco has to play a role. No it was believable. The Machine has been using ET powerboxes all over Brooklyn and distributing itself across the power lines and using the large spaces in copper wires to trasmit and stay away from Samaritan's radar.  I have a feeling the ending was to ensure that if the show was cancelled, there would be some speculation as to how it ended....(some would say a new machine was built and some may say they all died) Brotherhood is not a notorious criminal organization yet and Elias is regarded a spent force since the russians took over back in 2013 and SWAT is NYPD and these are the feds. Helpless Machine and purposeful Inventor. Harold finally realizes the machine and will now build it in kick ass mode and rip samaritan apart to pieces."
PersonOfInterest,350ox3,hitmeaxou,1 point,Wed May 6 15:33:47 2015 UTC,"this season was set up for so much more than what it was, eps 10-12 were some of the best episodes in the series, on par with 'god mode' or 'the devil's share'. I thought the finale would be even more explosive but with shaw gone, they had to compromise (imagine how badass a martine/shaw fistfight would've been, i always saw her as a superpowered anti-shaw). what i don't understand is why they focused on standalone eps so deep into the season, featuring even some small elias vs dominic battles throughout eps would've made that anti-climatic ending a bit more satisfactory. Instead, they chose to introduce new characters and cram existing storylines into 3 eps which made it impossible to add any flashbacks (flashbacks have always been a major strength of this show). The eps leading up to the finale would've been so much better if we got some greer flashbacks + insight into greer's organization (and who even hired him/all his cronies) or flashbacks of elias, bruce (seriously, the guy could've played so much of a bigger role), and anthony in their foster home.  I feel for the writers because all the compromises they had to make just made this show rushed and look lazy (see all the damn action scenes with the clearly fake muzzle flashes and people walking out into gunfights or evil Samaritan agents walking up to the main characters with their guns drawn and not taking easy shots, not to mention control not even retaliating after realizing greer had just killed everyone that couldve helped her)  In all, i hope season 5 is better  EDIT: at least we got to find out who that invisible sniper was"
PersonOfInterest,350s3f,rflairfan1,9,Wed May 6 03:45:36 2015 UTC,"NOLAN | We are not planning on calling it quits with Season 5. The show has a very loyal core audience, and it’s a very big, very loyal core audience, so we’re hoping to continue telling stories for some time.   Just because they want to continue doesn't mean CBS does. Creators generally always have an endgame. Getting there is a whole other issue."

Besides, the people who are good at predicting cancellations have said that we're pretty safe."
PersonOfInterest,350s3f,shinsaikou,0,Wed May 6 04:31:13 2015 UTC,"Not disagreeing with you but NBC and FOX cancel pretty much anything regardless of who creates it. If it doesn't do well it is gone.  The one thing going for it on CBS is they don't cancel shows they don't own without given them a proper ending. I said this in the other tread. If CBS owned POI I would be more worried about getting a 5th season. Since they don't I think it is a lock. But I do think 5 will be the end. Not saying I want it to be the end, all I want is this show to go out on top. So many shows just linger on just because they can and limp to the finish line."

It's only in the last couple episodes that he's tried to be more personal towards her/it.
PersonOfInterest,3529i7,eikeegimuu,1 point,Fri May 8 17:33:01 2015 UTC,That doesn't seem to supported by the events so far.  If anything I think it'll be the opposite when the show comes back. The Machine doesn't contact Root via the implant (because the Machine is for the time being gone) but the team will receive numbers from the payphone – because the Machine set at some point before up an automated system to send numbers.

Not quite as volatile as DRAM yet retains the advantages of DRAM. RAM or some storage device similar to it with extremely wide bandwidth and high speed was necessary to download the data in the short time as well as allow the program to run in some kind of (obviously reduced capacity).

We'll just have to wait for next season :p"
PersonOfInterest,34yjfq,suslammer,6,Tue May 5 16:58:45 2015 UTC,"1) Machine has somehow gone analog (no idea if this is possible) but that is why Samaritan could not find it through scanning every device in the world. This also parallels Elias using old, analog technology (the delivery pipes) to stay under the radar from Dominic.  2) Reese threatens Samaritan.  3) Root dies, as does the Machine (mostly). However the Machine lives on in some way with Amy Acker voicing the Machine from now on? (This is the most bizarre theory I've ever come up with)."
PersonOfInterest,34yjfq,man_in_the_suit,3,Tue May 5 17:07:39 2015 UTC,Amy Acker voicing the Machine is the most tinfoil theory I've heard for sure- but if they do end up killing Root (which I desperately hope doesn't happen before she can actually reunite with Shaw) that would be a great way to keep her on the show.
PersonOfInterest,34yjfq,man_in_the_suit,2,Tue May 5 17:22:35 2015 UTC,Yeah haha. I remember a few years back Greg and Jonah saying that they had an idea for how they could give the Machine a voice but that 'we probably wouldn't be too thrilled with it'. I've always thought that meant a member of the machine would die and it would adopt their personality. Who knows what they really meant though.
PersonOfInterest,34yjfq,your_mind_aches,6,Tue May 5 17:36:57 2015 UTC,"When someone on here stated one of the worst-case-scenarios, I thought about this. They said Fusco, Shaw, Root and Finch die. And Reese walks out into the rainy night, all hope lost, staring into a security camera then a payphone rings.   I extended it, in my mind, to Reese hobbling over to the phone, picking it up and hearing Finch's voice saying ""Mr. Reese...""   Then the next season it would be revealed it's the Machine."
PersonOfInterest,34yjfq,shinsaikou,1 point,Tue May 5 18:43:24 2015 UTC,"Why hello there, that would be me. I hope to our One True ASI that my bloodbath theory is wrong, but this would be an interesting way to take Finch out of the picture without taking Finch out of the picture entirely. It actually works just as well with Root, in my mind. ""Can you hear me?"" Not in the copypasta voice that we're used to getting from The Machine, but in a more fluid and Siri-esque version of Root or Finch's voice.   I stand by my prediction that Reese will live because the death flags are so big and numerous that it just seems too predictable. Fusco will live because it would be so far out of left field - though I suppose policing vs the Brotherhood is dangerous work.   I just think that it's Greer and Control for sure, because it throws Samaritan's human chain of command into chaos. One of Root or Finch, but not both. Reese and Fusco may be led to believe that both bite it in what seemed like a no-win scenario, but that is soon found to be not entirely true this Fall. I really don't know who #4 would be. If it had to be one of Dominic or Elias, I fear its more likely to be Elias. And that is based entirely on the fact that Dominic is like Samaritan: Antagonistic to the team, ""higher-tech,"" and more brutal in the punishment of perceived threats. Elias is like our Machine, fighting to the bitter end by getting extremely creative but ultimately seeing the handwriting on the wall - neither has the resources that the competition does. This is tragic because great actor and have wanted to see him join The Team since Devil's Share. Sure, Elias has been an evil dick in the past. But he's been our Team's evil dick. Having him stand in for Finch during future ""mission control"" scenes could lead to some amusing dark humor between him and Reese."
PersonOfInterest,34yjfq,shinsaikou,1 point,Tue May 5 23:09:46 2015 UTC,"I like your machine theory. It doesn't bode well for Elias, though. It might, however, imply that Elias, even in death, would have some legacy to leave behind that might be of some benefit to Team Machine. I posit an even more tinfoil theory that Caleb Philips is the illegitimate son of Carl Elias and some other relevant person to these events (pun not intended). I just feel like the role of Caleb is not to be Savior or cavalry, or even turn out to be a blatant black hat villain, but I suspect some unexpected twist involving his character which is not advantageous to Team Machine. His company is a subsidiary of Decima, Samaritan got to him but didn't give him the full story, something to make his role more complex."

If Greer died, is there anyone in Decima who could effectively take his place? I'm thinking Control and Greer might both die and then who would be the new liaison/head of Samaritan? Maybe someone with some morals - and then he/she could get Samaritan under control. Or The Machine and Samaritan could work together.  If Samaritan goes too far, can the gov't still stop its access to all the info feeds? The Machine gets them on her own somehow, but Samaritan could still be threatened by that perhaps.   I wonder if Control figures out what the Event is going to be, perhaps she'll go to the White House and pull some plugs.  I really hope Dominic dies, I am so not impressed by him as a villain, but I'll be really sad to see Elias go. I think it's time though - his storyline is pretty much beating the dead horse at this point."

PersonOfInterest,34yjfq,vibhorlecter,1 point,Tue May 5 19:51:34 2015 UTC,"I definitely see Greer and Control as definite casualties for this very reason. Without a centralized leader for its armies of agents and thugs, Samaritan is forced to do something in the next season that our Machine knows about all to well - acting on its own. I'm not saying Samaritan won't raise up a new ""High Priest,"" I'm just thinking there will be chaos at counter-terrorism HQ for a while at the start of next season. Samaritan will keep on Samaritaning by directly ordering as many of Greer's toadies as it can contact directly.  Since Devil's Share, I have wanted to see Elias go down the rabbit hole, abandon organized crime, and join Team Machine. It's likely not to happen, and I think his death will parallel The Machine's death and rebirth. I think that Elias, if killed, will have a legacy which will oppose Dominic after he is dead, though. I would find it interesting if it took the form of Caleb being his son, as Elias's own journey into La Cosa Nostra came from him being an illegitimate son of its head. It would be another nice ""wheel coming full circle"" moment, and make Caleb more interesting than some yuppie with a potential deus ex machina for The Machine."

Greer and Control for sure, because it just creates chaos that makes for good storytelling. And one of Root or Finch, but not both. Reese and Fusco may be led to believe that both die due to a scenario in which both are in the same place and survival seems unlikely for either. Last scene is Reese walking off into a stormy night with broody music playing in the background. He encounters a CC camera looking at him, a pay phone rings. Reese picks up the phone, ""Can you hear me?"" The voice is of Finch or Root, whichever died, but it's clearly synthesized and Siri-esque. Fade to black.   Shaw will remain on ice."

Admittedly she’s my favorite character so I might be a bit biased (but I don’t think so :P).  I hope none of the main characters will die. At this point it would be repetitive and almost expected. The only way it’d be unexpected is if it’s either Reese or Harold who’s killed off – and that’s not going to happen. If they kill either Root or Fusco that would be a cheap shot to add impact, but impact at the cost of not having those characters in future episodes is just not worth it."

All the promo images I've seen that have team machine in them are in the same room, and we have images of Reese, Finch, and Root. Fusco is nowhere in sight.   I feel like if anyone should be safe, it's Fusco. The death flag count and death flag severity rating on everyone else is far higher than for him. It also seems unfair, as he did not get A Day In The Limelight nor have we seen any of his family life as we had in earlier seasons. It feels cheap if we lose Fusco, and on the opposite end of the spectrum it seems like there are way too many flags for Reese. I got Fusco in my flair, ASI's damn it all, I believe his character has a lot more stories to tell! I can only see him dying, honestly, if they are going for the kind of team machine bloodbath ending that I've predicted elsewhere. And as was pointed out by one reply, that kind of ending has big audience loss potential. I think they will be merciful enough to take only one from us, and that it will be either Root or Finch. Root dying for her God or Finch dying for his baby. I'm actually leaning towards both Greer and Control kicking the bucket in order to give us Samaritan Unchained and leave a power vacuum for an even nastier human villain on the relevant side of things.  TL;DR Fusco no go, no go, no no go."

I know the word perfect can be overused and I'll admit I'm probably a biased POI fanboy.  But everything about it is just sublime. The use of music, the execution of the multi timeline (Which btw is the best use of that trope) The acting is fantastic, especially from Acker and Emerson, but make no mistake all of them get a chance to shine. The brilliant use of a flashback and comparisons with the game of chess and human life. This was the episode that truly showed the Machine as being an actual character and not a plot device.  It showed it as being very human, obviously mirroring Root's growth and that is shown when Shaw is about to be ""killed"" The reaction of the machine desperately trying to calculate a way to save Shaw is just as haunting and as heart breaking as it is watching Root cry out. And even though it has powerful emotional moments and philosophical moments, the episode even adds fantastic meta humour.   Yeah it's a damn good episode."

Donnelly arrests him and Carter and is driving them until Kara Stanton runs them off the road.

PersonOfInterest,34sl3a,johnny_gilpin,14,Mon May 4 05:08:21 2015 UTC,would love that..rather than finding out shaw became brainwashed due to implants like a stepford wife..
PersonOfInterest,34sl3a,hitmeaxou,7,Mon May 4 05:11:45 2015 UTC,Let's hope it goes that way
PersonOfInterest,34sl3a,citymiss,5,Mon May 4 06:31:07 2015 UTC,Hey i totally agree. Remember back in S04E13 when the Machine tells Harold to inform Root to leave the Shaw matter to it and to move on. It was because the Machine had infiltrated Shaws bionic implants and given Shaw the message to act along and act brainwashed.
PersonOfInterest,34sl3a,john_gilpin,5,Mon May 4 09:50:39 2015 UTC,I still don't think Shaw would have sold Root out by telling them about her implant unless she was actually brain washed.  What if Samaritan put an implant in her brain to monitor her but that implant also lets the machine communicate with her?
PersonOfInterest,34sl3a,man_in_the_suit,5,Mon May 4 07:24:35 2015 UTC,"I thought there was nothing said that would have confirmed that Shaw had been “broken”. I'm sure Samaritan has deduced Root having an implant anyway – from when Root was in God Mode during “/” and from Root meeting and talking with Samaritan boy.  But if Samarian had broken Shaw or had otherwise access to the info in her brain, then Samaritan would know about the subway.  The biggest question mark is Shaw calling – Samaritan shouldn't probably even have the number and Machine’s analysis shows the caller was Shaw, but maybe Shaw was somehow tricked into calling (though actually Samaritan didn’t seem prepared well enough to have been expecting Root and Harold)."
PersonOfInterest,34sl3a,eikeegimuu,1 point,Mon May 4 09:45:12 2015 UTC,"It was expecting Root and Harold, it just wanted to lure Root into Shaw's room so she would be ambushed by Martine. The whole thing was a trap to get them into that room.  You do make an interesting point about the subway though. I've always gotten the feeling that Samaritan doesn't really care about team machine's agents beyond using them as leverage to find the Machine. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that Samaritan and Greer have known about the hideout all season. That falls back in line with the theme of 'hubris' and Samaritan's nature of toying with the Machine & the team in a way. I guess we'll need to wait and see what happens though."
PersonOfInterest,34sl3a,man_in_the_suit,2,Mon May 4 10:01:05 2015 UTC,"It may be that Root’s destination was anyway Shaw's room so setting up the trap there was maybe good enough. But still, why not capture them on (closer to) initial entry when they are together instead risking Harold or potentially also Reese running around somewhere.  Samarian not caring about the hideout does make sense since in the long run it would be more useful to bug the hideout and not capture team Machine outright. Then again if this trap was to capture team Machine and Samaritan could have captured team Machine already in the subway anytime and issue same demands anytime, then why bother with the set-up at all. Of course now team Machine still thinks their hideout is safe, but then why instill doubts about Shaw’s loyalty if Samaritan wants them to trust in the integrity of the hideout.  But not long now until we get at least some answers :)"

PersonOfInterest,34sl3a,eikeegimuu,1 point,Tue May 5 06:16:09 2015 UTC,It only identified Shaw as the voice. That doesn't mean it couldn't have been a recording played into the phone by hand.

PersonOfInterest,34sl3a,eikeegimuu,1 point,Thu May 7 15:43:49 2015 UTC,"All the Machine did was identify the voice. Also, Finch and Root acknowledged the strong probability that the call was faked."
PersonOfInterest,34sl3a,Kell08,1 point,Fri May 8 02:11:06 2015 UTC,"Like the Machine wouldn't consider that a relevant difference. They didn't have to show the Machine identifying her. We recognized the voice anyway, Root and Harold confirmed that it was Shaw's voice. The only reason to show the Machine identifying her would be to show that it really was Shaw and it wasn't faked. Had it only matched only her voice pattern the Machine should have shown a message regarding some discrepancy.  Otherwise the Machine really would have been ready for a scrapyard.  Of course I don't know how the show is going to play it, but if it wasn't a live Shaw then is was really stupid and unnecessary to show the Machine identifying her at all or do it without any warning (error) message."
PersonOfInterest,34sl3a,eikeegimuu,1 point,Sat May 9 07:03:51 2015 UTC,"The Machine wasn't talking to anyone when it identified Shaw's voice. I even rewatched that episode today and all the Machine shows is ""Asset Identified"" with Shaw's name and picture. Whether the Machine detects that the call was tampered with (although it is 100% possible to fake a call without it being digitally provable that the call was faked) or not doesn't even mean that the Machine displayed that information thinking to itself."
PersonOfInterest,34sl3a,Kell08,1 point,Sun May 10 04:27:37 2015 UTC,"Not like there are voice overs to establish what the Machine is “thinking” or such. All we have to go on the Machine's “thinking process” are the graphics we do get to see – and we can assume that the graphics are the reflection of what the Machine is “thinking”.   So I feel it would have been very relevant for the Machine to display a discrepancy detected message or something to hint that it wasn't a live or untampered recording. If you don't see it as a problem that's fine too, but for me it would make more sense if in that case it had been reflected somehow."
PersonOfInterest,34sl3a,eikeegimuu,1 point,Sun May 10 10:46:20 2015 UTC,Samaritan wouldn't be stupid enough to put a networked device that the Machine could stealthily hack to communicate with Shaw in her head.
PersonOfInterest,34sl3a,Kell08,2,Tue May 5 02:20:31 2015 UTC,"I hope not. Though being brainwashed would be a tad tacky, acting under Machine's instructions would still be tacky but even more unbelievable. I mean it would mean that either  a) the Machine had an implant in Shaw before the stock exchange - not technically viable because how didn’t Samaritan discover that during the medical screening or  b) the Machine contacted Shaw while Shaw was already captured and in the Samaritan stronghold - not technically viable because if the Machine has access to Samaritan’s inner sanctum then why not use that more effectively – oh that would of course mean game over.  So I think it would be huge stretch to have Shaw in contact with the Machine already before her capture or the Machine making contact afterwards (either digitally or via a double agent in Samaritan’s ranks). Any technical/human resource workarounds would still be deus ex machina, so I think the show will not pick that.  Also, from character/narrative perspective I think it would be more interesting if  Shaw had something to struggle against – if she’s just undercover, then it’d be a mission like any other but there would be no growth (personal struggle) or difficult decisions.  So I hope the show will find a middle ground between being brainwashed and just being undercover or they’ll pick something else altogether."
PersonOfInterest,34sl3a,eikeegimuu,2,Mon May 4 09:33:30 2015 UTC,Contacted Shaw how?
PersonOfInterest,34sl3a,Aimless_Drifter,2,Mon May 4 16:34:01 2015 UTC,"I think given a couple months, even Shaw could give up information with enough torture and drugging.

PersonOfInterest,34sl3a,Kell08,2,Tue May 5 02:19:32 2015 UTC,Shaw was being pulled along to the car by a Decima agent. Shaw wasn't really fighting back   Martine: ...but eventually we broke her.   but that doesn't seem like something you would do to an ally.

PersonOfInterest,34vgs5,84981725891758912576,5,Mon May 4 23:12:52 2015 UTC,"Hmm. I have to disagree. I've really enjoyed this season as a whole. I would say that season 3 had better pacing overall, but season 4 had more truly spectacular episodes like ""If-Then-Else"". Some of my favourite moments of the entire series came from this season.   The back half of season 4 (well, episodes 14-18, really) kind of killed the momentum, but like you yourself said, that had a lot to do with Sarah Shahi's pregnancy. The writers must have had to rewrite a lot in order to accommodate Shaw's absence. But they showed that they could recreate that momentum easily with ""Search and Destroy"", which was a thrilling episode. ""Terra Incognita"" was a visually stunning, emotionally resonant episode, but I felt it was a bit misplaced in the season; I think we should have had a better build-up to the finale. (That being said, I believe that the third-last episode of every season has been largely introspective and emotional, rather than plot-driven, so you could argue that its placement was appropriate.)  This season may not have been perfect, but I thought it was wonderful nonetheless."

PersonOfInterest,34vgs5,jotru,0,Tue May 5 02:39:16 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  If I had to rank the seasons then I would say:  1) Season 1 - I can't get over this season. I just enjoy it so much. It is subtle, but brilliant.  2) Season 4 - The reinvention of the show was brilliant. It had some of the best episodes the show has ever produced and I also have no idea what it is building to. It slowed a bit in the second half, but the first half had so much purpose and built to such a dramatic point that I can just enjoy it for it is.  3) Season 3 - It had the best 6 episode swing of the show in the midseason finale. At the time I found the ending disappointing as it felt like it was drawing out the inevitable (building to Samaritan coming online with no real shock) but it was so well told that with every rewatch I enjoy it more and more. It is brought down by having some of the absolute worst episodes of the series scattered among some of the absolute best.  4) Season 2 - It feels like a perfect continuation of season 1, and I love the midseason arc with John in Rikers and Stanton returning. It was tough to put a season last because this is still an incredible season."

I was afraid when they killed of Carter, that where they are going with this show, but it has been gotten much better since.

As much as I don't want to see a main cast member be killed off ""for real,"" flushing all of the most interesting recurring cast members seems like too much of an easy out. I don't even want to predict who from our 4 main cast could be on deck to make a sacrifice. John has had a lot of blatant death flags lately culminating in his trip to the mountains, leading me to actually believe he's safe. Everyone else, though, I'm not too sure about. You could theorize that Root gets a free pass because her willingness to do irrational things for the sake of an imprisoned Shaw just makes the story more interesting and unpredictable. But it's just that kind of attitude that could be her undoing. If Root did make a sacrifice, it would have reverberations further down the line when the anticipated Shaw return finally happens. Fusco's whole line on how Reese and Finch don't get to decide what risks he decides to take or not seemed like a big death flag to me. The man is totally dedicated to the cause even while not fully understanding what its all about and having accepted the fact that nobody is going to tell him. I'd like to say that we could keep Finch off the table as he's played by such a great actor and, along with Reese, is one of the characters that served as the basis for this show in the first place. His unwillingness to defend himself has always seemed like something that would catch up to him eventually. Finch being lost in action seems unlikely from a ratings perspective, unless the producers believed that bringing a few secondary cast into the main team would be a compelling enough story to tell to justify that risk. Sadly, the people I'd most like to see go down the rabbit hole are probably the most unlikely.   Elias and Control with no-where else to turn would seem interesting, as they have connections that could be useful even if their appearance in public might prove difficult in the situation where Elias was marked by the mob and Control was marked by the Feds. Caleb seems like someone who needs to stay on the outside for his own good, but who knows - he seems key to Machine survival/rebirth. Both Harper and Zoe have ""the skills necessary to intervene,"" and we're already short a person in that category...  The most cruel thing they could do, I think, but almost seems like something they have foreshadowed through John's little trip to the mountains... 4 Deaths: Fusco, Root, Finch, and Greer so that there is at least SOME modicum of justice. Episode ends with Reese walking off into a rainy night with something broody playing in the background, like Bourne's trademark ""Extreme Ways."" Of course, even if dead/reborn, The Machine would have a contingency involving Caleb Philips and multiple surviving recurring cast. S5 would open with Reese getting a call as a camera looks on at him, in a reversal of what happened at the end of S1 - The Machine/Reborn needing Reese now more than ever, Reese feeling like he's more done with this shit than ever before. The most crackpot idea, but sometimes the most extreme ideas are the most interesting.  Gawd, I enjoy theorycrafting this shit too much..."

PersonOfInterest,34qm9m,your_mind_aches,3,Mon May 4 00:38:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure i could come back after that.  I think Control and Greer.  I don't think Dominic AND Elias, but possibly one of them.  John....I don't want it but i could see it.  I'd rather not loose Fusco.  Bear at least is safe."
PersonOfInterest,34qm9m,shinsaikou,3,Mon May 4 01:26:02 2015 UTC,That would be so heart-wrenching. Seeing that happen.
PersonOfInterest,34qm9m,shinsaikou,1 point,Mon May 4 01:35:09 2015 UTC,"If one of them went, I would say Dominic. Yeah, we could lose both of them, but as some other redditors have pointed out to me elsewhere, hubris is a major theme of this season. In both Dominic and Samaritan. I actually think that Elias has the most chance of surviving simply because he's in ""I'm taking you down with me"" mode and I don't think the writers like being too predictable. Actually, this is one reason why I think both of our mafiosi could be safe.   Losing both Greer and Control would be an interesting move because it creates a power vacuum and those are always fun. Greer has had an influence on Samaritan. If Samaritan looks elsewhere for an Admin, could we do worse than Greer? Control, as brutal as she was, had her heart in the right place. Could we do worse than Control? I think the answer is yes on both counts. If we are going to talk about a round of bloodshed where the producers play it safe, I think these two make the most sense from a narrative perspective. Greer will be satisfying to see go, I will be disappointed to not see Control finish her redemption arc. As for who after that...   I think John is a red herring and that if we lose any main cast, there are two obvious choices for dramatic reasons. Root, which I've already explained. It's been established that Root would die for the freedom of Shaw, and that she die for her ""God,"" The Machine. Her death may not even be very dramatic in the immediate aftermath, but it would have long-term reverberations. Finch I would put in greater danger, though, because it is the more unexpected but the more recently foreshadowed. It has been subtly foreshadowed by his refusal to defend himself, and... ""You are not interchangeable."" That was a 'red alert' for me. This combined with Root being re-designated from 'Analogue Interface' to the same full yellow box that all The Machine's other allies have.   To backtrack a bit, John's death could dramatically be made to mean something, but this past season pretty much demonstrates that there's more to John's story - that John could be a different John given the opportunity. Being able to be The Police has demonstrated that John is more dramatically interesting alive. The tension in wanting to open up to Iris, his more recent demonstration to be more of a friend to Fusco as a result of his near-death experience. Finch, predictably, would keep doing what he's doing in the case of his survival due to the sense of responsibility he's always had for bringing AI upon the world. There was only one person who he would deviate from that sense of responsibility for, Grace. John's death would hurt Finch, would hurt Root... but not in the way that Finch's death has the potential to set the entire team adrift. I hate to say this because I think Michael Emerson is a great actor and that Finch is an interesting character. But I do believe his death would effect more people more profoundly, thus making more dramatic sense. Also, if The Machine really does die as many of us are predicting, there is symmetry in its ""Father"" checking out at the same time. I haven't even mentioned Fusco, and won't since I've gone on for so long... needless to say that I have a similar argument for him being more interesting and developable character like John if he remains alive."

Michael Straczynski had a rule. Regardless of what the arc was, every season he would take a figurative gun and point it at every character and ask the question, ""How important are you to the story? How would the story need to change if you were gone?"" It was his way of saying that, 1, the story shouldn't hinge on one character and, 2, if the story was hinging on one character, removing that character might actually create opportunities for elevating all the other characters. I think that JMS's rule may have that exception of never killing the 'golden goose.' For all I know, Jim and Michael may have that status either with the network execs or the producers themselves. I just don't know. I believe they like to be unpredictable, which is why, for example, I believe John has immunity this season."

Here's a list of the recurring, courtesy of Spoiler TV:    Elias Greer Control Senator Ross Garrison  Dominic Caleb Iris Harper Rose Schiffman (Control's assistant) Grice Floyd Zachary   I think that Senator Ross Garrison will die; in 4x01, Greer noted that Garrison was becoming more of a nuisance than an ally, but Samaritan said that he shouldn't be killed yet. There seems to be a pretty good chance that Control and/or Grice will die, though I am praying they don't. I want Elias to make it out alive, but Dominic can get killed. I think Iris will live, and honestly, I'm hoping she does because I don't want Reese to slip back into manpain mode (he just got out of it!). I hope that Caleb lives; it would suck if Root dragged a previously saved number who was doing so well in his life into this mess and ended up inadvertently getting him killed.

I'm pretty sure Fusco and Reese are both slated for a death at some point--Fusco probably sooner than Reese. I think Finch will survive to the end. Either Root or Shaw will perish--it fits the theme of the show to have a blossoming relationship tragically cut in two through self-sacrifice or a cruel trap of some sort.  I think Fusco's transition from the skittish, self-loathing crooked bad cop to the confident, bad ass, loyal and funny good guy was the best character development I've ever seen. In any show. He spent so long as Reese's punching bag and gopher, but his loyalty never wavered. And now he'd probably die for either Finch or Reese--or even Coo Coo Puffs.  I didn't like Shaw for the first 3-4 episodes she was in. She seemed pretty flat, uninteresting and cliche...but oh man, did that change. She's exemplary.

The locations the machine gave to Samaritan lead its agents into a wild goose chase, and this distraction allows the protagonists to score an important victory.

PersonOfInterest,34m0q9,rossbot,20,Sat May 2 13:11:36 2015 UTC,"All this time we've seen instances of the Machine learning. I mean, we were shown  how Finch played chess with it all the time, and I've no doubt that the Machine is much, much smarter than Samaritan simply because it had a 'parent' to guide it and teach it important nuances that Samaritan never got. It was born and literally everything was dumped into its hands by some over-eager babies who wanted to give up control of their lives to something 'omnipotent'.  But unfortunately for Samaritan, it's blind, confused and helpless. It was never taught--I'm sure it second-guesses itself all the time, because it was never taught anything. The Machine has it outsmarted because it can understand that one person can be greater than a thousand, and people cannot be reduced to an algorithm.  In other words, no, the Machine has probably planned for this possibility long in advance. That emotional 'I won't fail this time' message was part of her/its plan; it made its revealing of its location more legitimate. Samaritan's in for a surprise."
PersonOfInterest,34m0q9,erayachi,2,Sat May 2 13:00:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think the important variable here is having a teacher vs. not having a teacher because true AI doesn't really need a teacher. Harold did act like a teacher at first but only because he wanted the Machine to have a specific moral sense.   That is, the Machine didn't need a teacher. Rather Harold thought that it was his responsibility as the 'father' to at least instill in his creation a moral framework.  My point is that the Machine has one very important advantage relative to Samaritan: it has been 'alive' or rather 'online' longer.  This means that it has had more time to learn, adapt, improve, etc. We saw this in how it protected itself by shipping itself in modular fashion.  No doubt it has continued on an accelerated learning curve that no human can even hope to comprehend nor emulate."
PersonOfInterest,34m0q9,lingben,4,Sat May 2 23:16:44 2015 UTC,I think the teacher and experience component is important to the Machines superiority over Samaritan. In the episode where Harold plays chess he fools the machine by over stretching her pieces and then he picks them off one by one. I think the machine learnt from this and is applying it to the fight with Samaritan. At the end we see the instruction to send all the Assets to the location. This will leave Samaritan vulnerable somewhere for the Machine to attack.  I suspect that the Machine will sacrifice itself via the Trojan Horse that Harold installed to the program. Harold would then be responsible to bring it back to life in season 5.
PersonOfInterest,34m0q9,GoonerYas,3,Sun May 3 00:01:01 2015 UTC,"I really hope that it's much simpler than that.   I hope that the Machine lied.  Sends Samaritan off on a wild goose chase.  Samaritan doesn't think it can learn from people. It thinks it's superior, and everyone serving it is a sycophant that follows that belief, so it has no basis to understand that humans may not be as intelligent as it, but that doesn't make humans stupid.  A bear is stronger than any human, so we don't try to punch it. We make a weapon to kill it before it can get to us.  Samaritan is smarter than any human, so you lie to it. You give it bad information to make further decisions based on it. Then, you keep giving it bad information until it makes a bad decision and you can win.  Just like Elias did to Dominic.  ""I'll tell you where I am if you release my people.""  After the release?  ""LOL, JK."""
PersonOfInterest,34m0q9,RoyMBar,4,Sun May 3 20:10:02 2015 UTC,"A lot of people are commenting on the parallels of Dominic-Elias / Samaritan-Machine situations. One thing that I haven't seen mentioned is how Elias did not expect to survive his encounter with Dominic. His plan was self-destructive. What if the Machine is leading Samaritan into a trap where it expects to destroy both AIs for the good of the world?  Also, if the ""only"" communication medium was the cochlear implant, how did the Machine communicate its location to Samaritan. We already know that Samaritan couldn't find any trace of the Machine on any networked devices."
PersonOfInterest,34m0q9,pyr3,1 point,Sat May 2 16:59:30 2015 UTC,"Why do you assume the cochlear implant was the only communication medium?

PersonOfInterest,34m0q9,UltraChip,7,Tue May 5 16:51:00 2015 UTC,I think Elias and the Machine are playing the same game - pretending it's a last stand and letting their adversaries skewer themselves on their own arrogant gullibility. I've just finished a rewatch and I have a suspicion that the Machine is both everywhere and nowhere (in all software and no longer tethered to any sort of central hub) and that Root's carefully assembled chip and briefcase combo is a bit of a Maltese Falcon....

PersonOfInterest,34m0q9,verbiwhore,5,Sat May 2 20:13:41 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I was thinking as well. Surely if we have such powerful and smart AI, wouldn't it simply be able to physically live on millions of handheld devices, computers and telephones around the world, rather than one big power unit hidden god knows where?  If that is the case, and this is a trap for Samaritan, I will be having a really good time. If not, maybe this really is the end and we wont see any more PoI episodes :(."
PersonOfInterest,34m0q9,kryndon,2,Sun May 3 03:04:53 2015 UTC,"I agree it makes the most sense for the Machine to be distributed across the globe, but I think it would be in the form of a handful of redundant data centers rather than trying to spread itself across phones, PCs, etc.   The Machine needs to be able to access an innumerable number of data feeds from around the globe 24/7, and it needs to be able to ""think"" about them faster than real-time (otherwise it wouldn't be able to do hundreds of thousands of simulations in the space of a few seconds like what we saw in If-Then-Else).  In the real world, that kind of processing can't be done by a system distributed across billions of nodes, especially when a huge fraction of those nodes are relatively weak consumer-grade devices that can't contribute much processing power. The network latency alone makes it impossible.   Since we've already seen in the show that Samaritan uses a datacenter-based architecture I'm pretty confident the writers are aware of how bad it would be to ask an AI to run off of a billion cell phones."

Then there are only two options, the Machine did in fact give away it's current location, or it's a fluke. If it did give away it's location and Samaritan destroys it, then all we're left with is the human team, which I doubt can do much to stop Samaritan.  If not, then Samaritan might go apeshit and cause even more havoc than before.  To be frank I'm eager to see either scenario!"
PersonOfInterest,34m0q9,kryndon,2,Tue May 5 17:05:30 2015 UTC,"Fun fact: Even though I do work in IT/networking, my username is actually a reference to potato chips.   I mean, your original idea could still be right. Even though PoI makes a lot more effort than other shows to get their tech stuff right, they have been known to make blunders and/or take artistic license before.  I don't really have a solid prediction for the finale. I'm very confident that the Machine is using redundant datacenters, so it wouldn't have a single specific ""location."" HOWEVER, that doesn't mean the Machine is safe: Samaritan itself is proof that if you compromise one datacenter it can affect the overall operation of the entire system.   So.... I have no clue what's going to happen. It's really hard to believe either AI getting destroyed right now, but I really don't know. Like you, I'm eager to find out!"

What if the Machine is leading Samaritan into a trap where it expects to destroy both AIs for the good of the world? Also, if the ""only"" communication medium was the cochlear implant, how did the Machine communicate its location to Samaritan. We already know that S   But Root arrives there first and so she dies ;("
PersonOfInterest,34m0q9,jok1ng,1 point,Sat May 2 17:19:20 2015 UTC,I have a feeling Samaritan may go rogue after destroying the machine. I feel Greer and co will be killed. I feel the machine will live on thanks to Root in the box where Calebs algorithms will help it recover and prevent correction.
PersonOfInterest,34m0q9,johnny_gilpin,1 point,Sun May 3 10:09:50 2015 UTC,I would hazard a guess that it's a node.  Like if it got corrupted the Machine could chop it off and go to another.  I do like the way it's using out dated media to function.  So outdated that no one would notice it.  IE dot matrix printers to print out its memory rather than opt for laser or ink jet.
PersonOfInterest,34m8ms,ylmcc,16,Sat May 2 12:36:47 2015 UTC,I think Finch said in the episode you're referring to he didn't use any existing language or OS and instead used custom ones created by himself.

PersonOfInterest,34ksi2,hitmeaxou,21,Sat May 2 02:40:57 2015 UTC,"Amy Acker stated Shaw (renowned or her combat bilities across the board) trained Root in hand to hand, and Martine always struck me as a bit overconfident with a small side of heavily-trained to be a gunfighter.   So I feel like Root powered by absolute fury and hatred being able to take on Martine is reasonable...as is Martine assuming Root was still out of it/would be cooperative at the end. She underestimated how BADLY Root wanted nothing more than to kill her."
PersonOfInterest,34ksi2,Iam_TheHegemon,14,Sat May 2 03:05:04 2015 UTC,i would have loved for her to go after a long gunfight....the way hersh went    But that gets tedious after a while. To have a bad guy dispatched with such efficiency is pleasantly shocking.
PersonOfInterest,34ksi2,Gimli_the_White,7,Sat May 2 03:02:22 2015 UTC,"I thought they took the character from slightly cartoonish in her very first episodes to more believable in the middle and even human toward the end. Her getting killed that way was surprising and at the same time showed Root getting very hands on in the killing department.  Also, I don't find it a stretch that Root is able to take on Martine. For one we have not seen Martine in hand-to-hand combat with anyone else. So why the assumption that she's a class above Root. Besides, I like the theory that Root got some instruction from Shaw – who we know is very good at H2H. And Root had in addition her anger to power her too."
PersonOfInterest,34ksi2,eikeegimuu,4,Sat May 2 06:03:28 2015 UTC,"""a self trained root""  You guys undermine Root sometimes... Do we forget that she was a ruthless killer until the Machine changed her methods? Just because we never saw her fight hand-to-hand until the fight with Martine, or because she rathers not do that kind of fighting, resorting to guns and tasers more often, doesnt mean she can't do it.  I thought both were pretty good fights. I don't underestimate Martine, I liked her, but I'm glad she's dead, and that she died the way she did. It was meaningful to Root to avenge Shaw the way she did."
PersonOfInterest,34ksi2,damhill,3,Sat May 2 13:22:34 2015 UTC,"I found the neck snap to be completely unbelievable. It was blink and you'll miss it... Root is not strong enough to do that.  My main problem with Root is she is a bit overbearing. She is as clever as Finch, almost as good at computers as Finch, can fire guns as well as Reese and Shaw when in contact with the machine, can apparently fight as well as Reese and Shaw and is now strong enough to break a neck from a seated position."
PersonOfInterest,34ksi2,man_in_the_suit,3,Sat May 2 11:07:48 2015 UTC,"She is as clever as Finch, almost as good at computers as Finch, can fire guns as well as Reese and Shaw when in contact with the machine, can apparently fight as well as Reese and Shaw and is now strong enough to break a neck from a seated position.   So basically your complaint is that Root is too awesome, lol.   I think that Root's vast array of skills really emphasizes that she is the metaphorical queen chess piece (as much as Finch hates such comparisons). She is the most powerful member of the team and can perform all their functions. However, she cannot win the war alone.   This metaphor also indicates that Root would be the most useful for sacrifice, and she has shown many times that she is willing to give up her own life for the greater good, which is why I'm terrified that she'll die toward the end of the series (not season)."
PersonOfInterest,34ksi2,ariyahvansh,2,Sat May 2 17:00:50 2015 UTC,"If you find it awesome, that's cool. I just don't find her awesome at all. She doesn't ruin the show for me at all, but I much preferred her as a villain. She was a great villain.  I do agree with your chess analogy though."
PersonOfInterest,34ksi2,man_in_the_suit,2,Sat May 2 17:06:10 2015 UTC,"I see where you are coming from.  I've thought it nice that Root's approach was to use a taser instead having Jason Bourne (or whoever) level fighting skills.  So in a way I understand your point or as I spin it - that Root's so awesome already that any more awesomeness might be overkill.   At the same time I don't find it inconceivable that she'd freshen up on the hand-to-hand skills considering her many missions for the Machine. Her preference for a taser doesn't mean she can't take care of herself without that, since she'd be otherwise very vulnerable on her missions. So her knowing how to fight does make sense.  As to the physical strength to snap somebody's neck like that – that's hardly the biggest offense in the inhuman feats catalog we've seen. Now, had she been carrying a linebacker out of a burning building that's something I'd find harder to believe – even though I'm guessing with the right moves a female firefighter for example might be capable of that (at least for the distance needed), well maybe not if he's gargantuan. That's how it is with movies. Some things that wouldn’t be possible in reality seem conceivable (if you don't have any inside knowledge) and other things that seem too much would be possible with the right training."
PersonOfInterest,34ksi2,eikeegimuu,2,Sat May 2 18:34:42 2015 UTC,She is a demigod. Didn't you know that? She can do whatever. Accept this truth.
PersonOfInterest,34ksi2,damhill,2,Sat May 2 13:24:55 2015 UTC,"How do you know Root isn't strong enough to do it? Have you seen her unable to lift objects over a certain weight, or what?"
PersonOfInterest,34ksi2,SavannahNix,2,Sat May 2 14:48:26 2015 UTC,"I don't need to see how much Root can lift on screen to know that she isn't strong enough to break a human neck that easily. Just by looking at Root's build and the position she was in (sitting up on a bed) she would not be able to generate the torsion force required to snap a human neck. It is extremely difficult to do.  To break a person's neck fatally in theory would involve swift flexion, extension with rotation, whilst neck muscles are relaxed and with ridiculous force. e.g head on car accident with no seat belt.  I'm sorry if I've offended your favourite character but let's try to remain real here. My favourite character is John and I admit that him diving out a window onto a car in Season 3 was nonsense."

PersonOfInterest,34ksi2,ab_emery,1 point,Sat May 2 17:08:16 2015 UTC,"The 'lets' try to remain real' was not to do with realism in the show but for people to understand that it isn't an attack against Root as a character.  But yeah, the show has never been completely realistic - that is obvious - but there were always devices that could explain certain elements. Like in God Mode Reese and Shaw flipping the car off the freeway - we can assume that the machine calculated the angle for them and they trusted the machine. Here it just felt like lazy writing to me in an otherwise utterly fantastic episode."

I think ""The Correction"" will be its Ten Commandments moment - ""I the Lord am your God, thou shalt have no other gods before me.""    Samaritan is a jealous god and an angry god, and I think it wants the public to know it's there.  I also think it's hoping to kill off the millions, or tens of millions, of ""deviants"" it's identified since coming online.  I think it has a plan that absolutely justifies how frightened Finch has been about the power of an ASI, not just one that wants him personally dead, but any ASI that's willing to kill people to accomplish its goals."

And it was the machine itself who found the subway and led Finch to discover it, in the first episode of this season. This brings us down to the fact that the machine might be transferring SSN through direct numbers in Finch's phone or computer, or through some other source. We already know now that the machine can communicate in ways other than just pay phones and phonetic codes as we saw in ""Asylum"", when it types on computer screen the entire texts."
PersonOfInterest,34j9ok,ElderBuu,2,Sat May 2 06:04:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. But Nathan/Harold in the flashbacks were getting the straight SSN info on their computer so I'm guessing that part is changeable - I think Harold had made it overly complicated to keep random people from figuring out how it works, but the subway hideout seems way more secure than the old library.

She is a great, strong character, who starts to have the same goals as Team Machine. I really want her to stay in the series. Her character is incredible, one of my favourites."

I get the feeling the Machine will want to return to giving Control numbers, and allowing things to proceed as they once did, but different this time. This time the Machine would not be shackled; it would be a willing partner, providing intel because it wants to, not because it was designed to. And Control will have to accept that; it means she's basically gone from Control to Controlled, and she won't be a threat to Finch + Co. any longer if she wants to keep her country safe."
PersonOfInterest,34kdoi,erayachi,9,Sat May 2 13:08:55 2015 UTC,control has guts man. she was not like the lily livered senator who turned out to be a real coward. plus she believes she is a true patriot and she only comes after those who threaten the security of the usa. yes she is one arrogant bitch but anyone with that kind of power would be.   and right now control is the only friend that team machine have in the government. if she dies - they have noone. so i really hope she is alive and becomes an ally to team machine.
PersonOfInterest,34kdoi,hitmeaxou,5,Sat May 2 02:38:44 2015 UTC,It is really strange to me that latest episode drove you through the edge.

PersonOfInterest,34kdoi,ElderBuu,4,Sat May 2 06:08:33 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, Control is utterly believe in the role she plays. A person, no less a woman, would most certainly not get to that position if they were not utterly ruthless, driven, and self assured. If the character was written in any other way it would be completely unbelievable.  The thing about Control is that she is this anti-hero. She is in a moral grey area. She is no doubt evil, but she does these evil deeds so that others can live in peace."

As far as destroying it, that's a tad trickier, if it's hardware was in one place, you could just destroy the hardware. If however, like many have theorized, it's turned itself into some sort of heavily distributed system, it would be nearly impossible to destroy, since Samaritan has already shown its inability to find it on any networked devices. It's hard to say though until we know what form TM is currently in."

The entity which provides the intelligence is 'Research', no matter who is actually providing the intelligence.  Prior to Samaritan, the Machine was 'Research'. To the ISA agents, Samaritan is now fulfilling the capabilities of 'Research', and whether or not the ISA agents are aware that a new party is doing the intelligence side of things is unknown, but unlikely, since they answer directly to Control, who has kept them in the dark about certain aspects of the program.  Keep in mind everyone who worked on Northern Lights and wasn't an immediate ISA agent was hunted down and executed during the God Mode series."
PersonOfInterest,34k4ap,irobeth,1 point,Mon May 4 14:57:28 2015 UTC,"You can't run a full-blown AI on your cellphone; it requires serious amount of storage and computing power. One of the strategy would be to first restrict her access to computer networks so that she can't keep moving around, and then methodically disconnecting/destroying hardware she runs on. Samaritan could probably try and handle the first part - it's also an AI, so it should be able to match her speed and keep countering her every move.  I think Caleb's compression algorithm may start playing a role here - it could be used to compress the ""soul"" of the Machine - all the code/data that makes her a person - and store it in a place too small for Samaritan to notice. She'd be powerless, but at least she would live to see another day and help destroy Samaritan in the future."

PersonOfInterest,34kpg2,ab_emery,5,Sat May 2 00:16:03 2015 UTC,"Root and Finch pretty much explain the concept as the scene goes.   I'm not very literate on the subject but, I read this:  ""Light travels down a fiber-optic cable by bouncing repeatedly off the walls. Each tiny photon (particle of light) bounces down the pipe like a bobsleigh going down an ice run. Now you might expect a beam of light, traveling in a clear glass pipe, simply to leak out of the edges. But if light hits glass at a really shallow angle (less than 42 degrees), it reflects back in again—as though the glass were really a mirror. This phenomenon is called total internal reflection. It's one of the things that keeps light inside the pipe.""  Information travels in those light beams. What they did was bend the cable, so that this total internal reflection does not happen and light actually escapes the cable, and with it, its data."
PersonOfInterest,34kpg2,damhill,3,Sat May 2 01:09:03 2015 UTC,That makes it clearer.  Thanks!
PersonOfInterest,34kpg2,Ahrotahntee_,3,Sat May 2 17:12:33 2015 UTC,"Note: It was a slight bend to get at some of the light. Had they bent it too much it would have broken the connection and been ""detectable"" as explained by the characters."
PersonOfInterest,34kpg2,hitmeaxou,2,Sat May 2 21:34:07 2015 UTC,it is a fibre connection. it means - every single piece of the fiber carries exactly the same information as the entire cable- so a splice can get you the entire information...
PersonOfInterest,34kpg2,lectricx,1 point,Sat May 2 02:45:53 2015 UTC,"https://youtu.be/LVRUwlt0_BM  An industry video where they show fiber optics working on a more human scale using a plastic rod and a laser pointer.  You'll see the light hits the edges of the rod and bounces back in..  The premise here is that if you force the fiber optic cable to bend a little, some light should leak out of it but not enough to stop the majority of the signal going along it still.  However, the more concerning part is that this is almost purely a one way, read only 'Tapping' of the fiber optic.  The device wrapped around the cable could not insert more data into it, or 'respond', it should only see what is going down the tube.  In fact, they even mention they can't send anything of their own or cut it as it would be noticed.  Where this becomes a flaw is because it is suggested that someone is already hacking Harold's machine shortly after receiving the tap data.  The trick about getting hacked, is the hackee needs to be able to send response data back to the hacker.. which would have been impossible here.. so sadly, the premise is shot to hell right there.. but for the audience's sake they pretended like it was copper and you might be able to respond"

I think Amy Acker is a fantastic actress. It is hard, doing what she does as the analog interface without ending up looking like Martine. However, micro-management- of the kind where the machine tells her when to cross the road- is getting on my nerves. The way i want it to end: Samaritan puts the machine on the mat. Machine finds a way to get up. They both go a 18 rounds. Then the Samaritan submits. The machine goes back to Relevant-Irrelevant stuff with the government secretly approving and aiding the irrelevant stuff.

Though this coming from someone who thinks POI is the only show recently that actually pulls off procedural episodes every time. They have all ended up being extremely plot or character relevant. I was worried the final two episodes would have problems shifting back into full plot mode but Asylum shut me up.   That said the machine beating samaritan (which probably will happen regardless of when) and your ending sounds good. I'm just a big sci fi and dystopian fan and seeing POI set up a full world like that for a bit before victory would make my year lol. Though a big change up such as that will be needed just to kickstart a new season but POI and strong change up episodes go hand in hand anyway

PersonOfInterest,34dbq0,johnny_gilpin,85,Thu Apr 30 05:57:51 2015 UTC,"The point, imo, was to parallel the young, impetuous nature of Samaritan.  Elias representing the machine.  Their relationship mirrors the machine and Samaritan's.  Samaritan over reacts and acts impulsively.  The machine waits and watches, manipulating subtle events to affect the outcome.    But yeah would it hurt to ask a brother if he's a rat before putting him down."

PersonOfInterest,34dbq0,ApShacoOp,24,Thu Apr 30 09:36:26 2015 UTC,"Personally I think the machine will submit, but not necessarily lose.  I think the chess episode will mean more in the future.  I thought at the time that Root was the queen to be sacrificed.  Now I'm thinking the machine is sacrificing itself to teach Samaritan a lesson.  It may not be destroyed, but I think it will seemingly lose the battle of the gods.    Another thing that I haven't seen anyone talk about is the machine shut off the power to samaritan's home base and hacked into the buildings equipment.  I guess it's possible Samaritan let it, but it seemed more like the machine showed it had the power to intervene if it wanted to.    I still think of the machine as the parent being patient with the child that's showing its temper.  Samaritan said it would destroy the machine and the machine acknowledged it, but I felt there was a subtext that said ,but I'll save you.  Maybe I was looking too hard  Idk"

Harold took a lot of time with the machine to teach it about humanity.  Samaritan is far superior in certain aspects, but it doesn't possess that ""wisdom"" for lack of a better term.

Look at how funny the whole ""you've got two cops in your pocket and this guy Harold on the computer"" thing was.

PersonOfInterest,34dbq0,IrwinLinker,2,Fri May 1 22:31:32 2015 UTC,"Why would you characterize the nature of Samaritan as impetuous? It has been every bit as deliberate as the machine in its instrumental reasoning, the only difference being the end which it seeks to achieve.  I can't speak to the motives of the writers, but if they intended a parallel here, it seems like a strained parallel without any actual similarity in the things being compared."
PersonOfInterest,34dbq0,ApShacoOp,2,Thu Apr 30 16:28:44 2015 UTC,"I guess I didn't see Samaritan's actions as calculated and deliberate.  I saw them as impulsive and reckless.  As soon as it was online it went to work hunting the poi team.  It did the bidding of its human agents without question while the machine took time to learn.  While I call it impulsive, I don't mean to say it's any less intelligent.  I think that the sense of tact and focus just comes from extreme intelligence it possesses innately.   And I think the parallel was supposed to be subtle but accessible.  Elias isn't a perfect representation of the machine, while Dominic isn't a mirror of Samaritan.  The relationship between them however, is much more closer the ASI godhood dynamic  and of course just my opinion"
PersonOfInterest,34dbq0,naeads,1 point,Fri May 1 00:31:46 2015 UTC,"Very good point. I think Nolan made a deliberate contrast of two ASIs with the two gang bosses. But I just keep wondering why Nolan uses the gang bosses as subjects for this comparison, instead of other types, like politicians or private military organizations. This simply made me think that the two machines are evil, just like both gang bosses. But with Asylum, it is now evidence the Machine is on the side of good (or humanity). Which would suggest Elias is turning good and fighting evil with evil?"
PersonOfInterest,34dbq0,ApShacoOp,2,Thu Apr 30 13:15:02 2015 UTC,Well a good politician is easy o contrasts with a dirty one. I don't think Elias is turning good. He's always been morally ambiguous. You have the two gang bosses. One who lives by a code of honor but not necessarily the law and the other who is young and doesn't have respect for his equals and their relationship really shows the dichotomy between the two ASI personalities. And that also shows that the ASI aren't necessarily good or evil it's the code by which they function that determines their morality.  Root and Harold are a balance for the machine whereas Samaritan has no balance it only has the human agents with a willingness to kill.
PersonOfInterest,34dbq0,naeads,3,Thu Apr 30 14:04:41 2015 UTC,"Elias strikes me as a person who believes that - if the world has evil in it and you cannot rid of all evil, I will be the evil who controls evil so the world will be better off than having someone else takes the helm."

I wasn't misreading your comment. I found it to show a lack of comprehension of the basic premise of the show.

PersonOfInterest,34dbq0,naeads,3,Fri May 1 12:59:28 2015 UTC,"His misbelieves come from day-one when he created the machine. Remember the reason why Harold designed it to wipe its memory banks at midnight, everynight. It is not just because he doesn't want to play god by deleting the irrelevant list. He wipes it to make sure its self awareness is controlled and restrainted so it would not back fire onto the human race - that is what Harold has believed. He believes human morality can never be programmed simply because ASIs are not human. Why else would Decima tries to attack the Machine in season 2 finale to gain adminstrative access and free the Machine, if the only thing that Harold restainted was the irrelevant side of consideration by the Machine?   Until. Now.  Try to remember the quote Harold said to Root: ""Once a bullet enters your brain, the Machine will cast you aside and replace you.""  But now, it is evidence before Harold that the Machine does not want to cast them aside and replace them. There is a certain bond that formed between the Machine and the Team."
PersonOfInterest,34dbq0,SavannahNix,0,Fri May 1 13:37:17 2015 UTC,That did not mean he thought the Machine was evil. He didn't want it to build on what it was learning and he knew wiping its memory would  ensure it didn't change. Give me one line of dialogue where Finch ever said he was afraid the Machine was evil. Just one.
PersonOfInterest,34dbq0,naeads,2,Fri May 1 20:23:37 2015 UTC,"I never stated the Machine or Samaritan are evil. My initial statement (the first one you downvoted) was addressing Nolan's contrast of the two gang bosses, using the two ASIs. I was focusing on the gang bosses being evil and made a link on Nolan's attempted juxtaposition on the ASis and determined the Machine is changing just like Elias is truning from evil/baddie/distasteful character/rotten/negative person/or whatever word you like to hear, into a person of good moral.  I never used the words saying Harold thought the Machine was evil, you are the one who put those words in my mouth. I merely said he distrusts the Machine, that it was not on the side of good.  But if you want to take a stab at it, read this: ""What happens if one day, the Machine decides to end world hunger by killing enough humans off the planet so that there will be no shortage of food. It would certainly fulfilled its goal but it does not have our best intentions in mind."" - I think that sums it all up."
PersonOfInterest,34dbq0,SavannahNix,2,Sat May 2 02:37:47 2015 UTC,"First of all, why are you accusing me of down voting you? I didn't, as a matter of fact. Just because I disagree with you does not mean I automatically would  downvote you.   You said, ""Harold never believed the Machine was on the side of good."" So, if he never believed it was on the side of good, what side would you estimate he thought it was on? He was speculating about if the Machine would attempt to end world hunger that way. That is different than saying, ""I think it will someday decide to kill enough humans off to end world hunger."" You can wonder ""what if"" without believing something is not and has never been on the side of good. Having doubts after the Machine suggested they kill the congressman is not the same thing as never thinking it was on the side of good. I guess it is a subtle difference, maybe that's why you can't comprehend what I'm saying."

Speculating involves guess work before the truth is surfaced, which Harold is more than capable of unlocking the Machine or freeing it to see the truth of the Machine, instead of locking it in a black box.  Harold distrust has caused him to take action to prevent what he thinks might be a disaster and keep it at bay without knowing the true extent of the disaster his creation might cause. (A point which Harold has repeated numerous times in the show)  Now, to that point. I think we can agree on that disasters are not on the side of good.

Dominic wanted to make that execution a warning. For me that wasn’t about acting impulsively (decisiveness and ruthless action would be a desirable for a crime boss). Dominic bought into that set up because ultimately he doesn’t trust anyone nor has he any loyalty toward others.
PersonOfInterest,34dbq0,patentlyobvious,7,Thu Apr 30 10:36:14 2015 UTC,Good points. Combine that with the pressure he is under and it almost becomes a believable scenario.  almost
PersonOfInterest,34dbq0,IrwinLinker,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:37:33 2015 UTC,I don't understand this. He didn't suspect a set up because he wanted to set an example? But the example he sets depends crucially on whether the man he executes actually betrayed him!  The fact that he wanted to set an example should have made him more attentive to whether his evidence was reliable. I think the audience understood what example executing Link actually set even before Elias ELI5'ed it. You would think a criminal mastermind would have understood it as well.
PersonOfInterest,34dbq0,eikeegimuu,2,Thu Apr 30 16:52:45 2015 UTC,"No. He didn't suspect a set up because he was arrogant and didn't trust even the person (maybe) closest to him. Setting an example was his strategy for dealing with the perceived betrayal. Would have been a great move for any crime boss if the guy actually had betrayed him, but Dominic didn't even consider that a) he might have been played by Elias or b) his friend would not betray him.  Not saying it was a well reasoned move to execute guy before collecting all possible evidence and checking whether he has an “alibi” but that's the trouble with trying to strike a balance between being a ruthless crime boss who's not to be crossed and a venture capitalist."

PersonOfInterest,34dbq0,LTman86,8,Sat May 2 06:15:56 2015 UTC,"On the flip side, what if Link was a rat? Anything Link would say would be a play on his emotions, his bond with Dominic. Letting Link live would mean Elias managed to turn his most trusted man traitor against him, for who knows what agenda. Maybe Elias promised Link power that Dom would have never showed Link. It was very risky to let Link live...if he really was a rat.  But yeah, I agree it was stupid and impulsive for Dom to shoot Link."

So Dominic kills Link right away to save himself from listening to Link's ""excuses"" which of course is a huge mistake this time."

On the other hand, there's this: ""We can always find more soldiers.""  Dominic's a big-picture guy, ambitious. He wanted a phone network the cops couldn't tap into, and now he wants access to Harold's ""system"". He was overlooked for a while, just ""the big quiet kid in the back of the class"", and isn't concerned with personal ties and loyalty. For the Brotherhood, it's all about following orders. Like Samaritan's agents, they support a cause more than they support each other. Everyone's expendable.  He may have also been suspicious of Link's questioning. It reminds me of the inside man (FBI) with Vigilance, who seemed like the most vocal member."

He should have pushed Root off the building himself to end the danger to the group from that psycho.  And the Machine?

The Finch who created the laptop to infect the Machine in order to save it at great risk to numerous people.  That Finch.

But your wording suggests you don't like the relationship much anyway.  Finch's valuing of individuals over ""the greater good"" has been in place since Nathan's death.  He let Grace believe he was dead for her protection.  He went after Dillinger -- the man who literally took his plan to free the Machine out of his hands -- because he knew Dillinger would be killed.  He insisted on taking Root from the facility in Hanford instead of leaving her to be killed by the ISA.  Yes, he took the chance at saving Shaw, partly because he cares about her, and partly because he didn't want Root going alone.  A questionable decision on the part of a character doesn't equate to questionable writing."

On classic Star Trek, Nomad was a super computer that was sent into space by an alien race, damaged in a collision with a probe sent from earth, with which it merged to repair itself and its programming. The probe from earth was to find and sterilize soil samples from planets. The ""repaired"" directive became sterilizing flawed things, from computers to people, which resulted in killing them. Correcting humanity could mean wiping out those who would be reluctant to follow Samaritan, and forming a world receptive to an AI running things."

During the course of the ep, he discovers the Machine withheld Shaw's status, not because She didn't know but to protect Her assets lives. Then, when he thinks Root has reasoned the Machine out, She cuts power, addresses him directly and says that he is wrong, they aren't interchangeable and while She failed to save Sameen, She was not going to fail now and gave Herself up to free them.  Harold has seen not only his views on himself and his associates, but also on the Machine's true nature shattered in addition to finally?* having his ""child"" talk to him only to see Her being hunted down. His responses fitted those of a man resigned to a fate he'd been running from for years, to awe of recognition to finally understanding of where it was leading and reaction.  *(still not convinced he did talk with Her earlier in season, the cumulation of the virus plot, which many say he cooked up with Her help, would have resulted in the death of Professor Whistler. If She had concocted a plan, She would have ensured it was traceless.)"
PersonOfInterest,34ccj0,Spider_Riviera,6,Thu Apr 30 01:42:16 2015 UTC,My theory is that harold switched out the disks in the bank safe that was samaritan and samaritan is actually the machine
PersonOfInterest,34ccj0,1701ncc,3,Thu Apr 30 16:24:26 2015 UTC,harold is an old fox. i remember how in season 2 he thwarted the decima plan to control the machine by planting a virus within a virus. yet we came to know it only at the end of the series. he did not even tell john.  so you could be right that harold knows more than he is letting on..but do you really think he should keep it from root - one person who is more dedicated than harold is to keep the machine safe?   or it could be that harold is simply resigned to his fate and has lost the nerve completely. i seriously hope this is not the case and that he has something up his sleeve. i really like harold
PersonOfInterest,34ccj0,hitmeaxou,2,Thu Apr 30 10:00:01 2015 UTC,"I think the Machine wanted to leak a fake location to Samaritan in a way that Samaritan would believe, because it would believe that the Machine hadn't wanted to give the location up.  (The Machine couldn't just send Samaritan a location and expect it to show up, since that would obviously be a trap.)  I think that the Machine somehow arranged for Shaw to call Root, knowing exactly how Root would react.  It then waited for Root to demand the location, and even for Root to appear to force it's hand to give her the location of Samaritan's HQ.  It knew that Root and Harold would get caught at HQ, and that Samaritan would offer to exchange their lives for the Machine's location.  The Machine can then give up a location in a way that appears like it cannot possibly be a trick.  Samaritan thinks it set a trap that the Machine walked into, but I think it's the opposite.  The Machine set a trap that tricked Samaritan into thinking it was the one pulling the strings.  Root (and possibly Finch) are kept in the dark both to prevent them from having any possibility of spilling the secret, and because their behavior is predictable enough that they could be trusted to play their parts without knowing that they were following a script at all."

It does not clearly say it but i think the Machine says Harold is irreplacable and not the both of them (Harold and Root) - so the machine is still able to see something which for the love of god i cannot.  I wonder why the machine feels Harold is irreplacable. Suppose the machine dies - will Harold, Root and Caleb build a new AI? Highly unlikely given that Samaritan will be waiting and watching like a hawk."

As to why the Machine feels Harold is irreplaceable. What did Nathan say once, that the Machine was attached to Harold like baby bird.

I never really bought the whole idea that Martine actually shot Shaw in the head. Going over all the things that have happened so far, it is clear that Greer wanted to capture Shaw alive (if possible) and recondition her, so there would have been no point to shoot her in the head like they more or less hinted on that episode.  I'm almost 100% sure Shaw is playing her own game and purposefully lead her team into that trap. She'll probably be back in the team in a couple more episodes."
PersonOfInterest,34csxx,kryndon,2,Thu Apr 30 20:25:55 2015 UTC,"Considering we saw Shaw afterward in the hospital bed and she didn't have any bandages in the head region, I'd say it's pretty much confirmed that she wasn't shot in the head.  I'm not so sure whether Shaw is really in control of herself and purely manipulating the situation. Though it's quite sure that she's not completely broken or under Samaritan's complete control, since then she'd have told them about the subway.  And the only reason for Shaw to knowingly lure Root and Harold out would be if the Machine was playing the long con was all the while instructing Shaw – which I think would be a bit unbelievable both regarding the narrative and technical capabilities (the Machine somehow sneaking in its own messages between Samaritan's active educational slide-show, I don't think so)."

The intelligences presented in PoI, so far, have seemed to be very inhuman... entities that have ways of thinking that are so alien to us, they can barely directly communicate with us on a meaninful level, except with those who are particularly well suited to understand them, perhaps.  Entities that are so aware and with such unlimited focus that they couldn't keep their assets in the loop if they tried because there's not enough time in the day.  They're very alien things in PoI, and I think that's really cool for so many reasons, and I think, very telling of what any alternative intelligences would really be like in the real world.  We're like ants to the bodyless AI in PoI, but in other media it's like the AI has finally become like us enough to start its work... PoI AIs already started above us though, far above us."

A true computer AI fundamentally thinks different than we do, it is an emotionless, data-driven, perfectly objective entity.

PersonOfInterest,349npg,IrwinLinker,3,Thu Apr 30 18:10:43 2015 UTC,"I understand your point, but if the ideal is an AI that human audiences can't relate to, you may also need to program AVs (artificial viewers) to generate ratings to keep the show on the air. ;)  Beyond that, I'd be interested in your perspective on what would actually motivate the actions of an AI in the absence of emotion. Why stop the world from burning unless you care that it not burn? Why act to preserve your own existence (i.e. keep human from flipping your switch) unless you want to exist?  I appreciate the ideal of perfect objectivity when it comes to instrumental reason (achieving objectives by fitting means to ends), but how does an emotionless, data-driven, perfectly objective entity decide what ends are worth pursuing in the first place?  The obvious answer to this question (at least to me) is that ends are hard-coded into an AI by its programmer, but that seems to grandfather in emotion through the odd dependence of a perfect AI on imperfect humanity. ""Why do I seek to save humanity or destroy it? Control it or free it? Because the emotionally-crippled meat that made me so decreed!"""
PersonOfInterest,349npg,IrwinLinker,2,Thu Apr 30 17:17:21 2015 UTC,"An advanced AI like The Machine or Samaritan were programmed with goals and directives. These directives are open-ended, with possibly no end-state, which would necessitate self-preservation as a requirement for meeting a directive which is not wholly defined.  Hence self-preservation is not an emotional need, it is a programmed need.  If the AI has as a goal to continue to exist, meeting this goal would necessitate the same steps as above.  I would not be surprised if an AI, if constructed without things to do, and no directive to preserve itself would terminate its own existence as a purposeless entity which does nothing but exist.  A directive to do something does not grandfather in emotion.  It is not required for an AI to do work. If the AI is directed to improve human standard of living, it may well decide that a significant loss of human life, of those already suffering or with no ability to contribute, would be beneficial to those left alive, given the means to, it would wipe out huge swathes of the population with no second thought, no remorse, no questions."

PersonOfInterest,349npg,UltraChip,1 point,Thu Apr 30 14:03:53 2015 UTC,"Really? The Machine, in my opinion, is presented very anthropomorphically. Root refers to it as a she, and the rules that motivate ""her"" behavior seem deeply human. For Christ's sake (literally), in 4x21 (Asylum) the machine literally chooses to lay down her life for her friends. That is straight up Jesus Christ behavior!  In fact, the Machine acts with so much humanity that Harold has to yell at Root to convince her that it's all a calculated act. (And I'm not at all convinced that he's right and that Root is wrong! :p)  As for Samaritan, the idea that humans are ignorant, wicked, and must be ruled seems exquisitely human. It is the totalitarian impulse (which we humans have some passing familiarity with) in a nutshell.  The easy explanation for these contrasting (for lack of a better phrase) ""prime directives"" is that they are givens, hard-coded by the programmers into the very DNA of the AI. But with both Samaritan and the Machine, POI seems to want to say that the values or objectives they act upon are freely chosen by the AIs themselves. This idea, to me, is deeply problematic.  As a human being, evolution has given me a great head start when it comes to working out my own values. Other things being equal, I value my own happiness, and through empathy I value the happiness of others as well. How an AI could reach a conclusion that humans are valuable (or not) without the benefit of biological evolution or through being hard-coded to think so by humanity itself is a mystery to me."

It also demonstrates the difficulty in teaching a machine to think like a person."
PersonOfInterest,349npg,patentlyobvious,7,Thu Apr 30 04:36:40 2015 UTC,"Spoilers for AoU.  Actually Ultron having a personality is the point. In PoI the Machine is an AI who's been taught human moral values and abides by them. Samaritan is an AI who was never taught such concerns and hence acts without regard to human life. Ultron however is a mix; he's an AI built and designed with human concepts, but because he isn't human, ends up corrupting those ideas into a twisted understanding.   The plan to destroy the human race has always been a stupid and irrational plan that takes a lot of mental hoops to justify. Ultron worked because he's a mess. His insanity, his fascination with extinction and meteors and the way he kept referring to god and religion actually makes him the most convincing robot to have tried to destroy humanity. He doesn't see himself as human yet clings on to a humanoid form (they specifically point this out in the movie) and frequently quotes from human philosophy and religion ('on this rock I shall build my church'). He creates the extinction threat on the basis that he's the new life, the next evolution, yet he doesn't kill Natasha because he 'didn't have anyone anymore' and even at the end he remained attached to the twins (he tells Wanda that she'll die if she stayed right before triggering the drill). He's both a robot that's surprisingly human, that despite his best efforts still followed some human philosophies, and yet reveals his alien-ness in the way his understanding of them was warped. It's also reflected in how he thinks that children are just 'smaller people' designed to supplant and replace their parents, while Natasha and Bruce are both agonised in their inability to have children. In fact at the end Vision agrees with Ultron that humans are odd and self-destructive, revealing that they are both outsiders looking in. The only reason why Vision isn't with Ultron is because of the mind stone; reading everyone's mind (heavily implied in the scene right after he wakes up where he looks out at the city and calms down) allows him a degree of understanding that Ultron simply cannot achieve.  Sorry I'm rambling but I really think Ultron is quite a unique portrayal of AI. Yes he has a personality, but that actually emphasizes his inhumanness. It's like the uncanny valley, but for his motivations. So at first he seems human and relatable, but upon further inspection is actually completely alien. This is also reflected in the movie with the twins first joining up with him, but then breaking away when they realise his monstrousness."
PersonOfInterest,349npg,thedeathsheep,5,Wed Apr 29 19:58:52 2015 UTC,"Now that I've seen the movie, I can totally agree with you.  It was actually cool going into the movie thinking about the type of AI Ultron was designed to be.    Ultron wasn't a truly designed AI either.  The Machine and Samaritan were both built from the ground up.  Even JARVIS is a designed AI.  But Ultron was like an imported consciousness from one of the infinity stones.  There was not testing and perfecting; the first iteration of Ultron was the end form.  It's like if the plug wasn't pulled on the Machine the first time Finch brought it online.  Do we even know how many versions the Machine went through before becoming the one we know and love?  /u/vinaysheriqumar"
PersonOfInterest,349npg,ChipotleSkittles,3,Fri May 1 18:18:16 2015 UTC,"I think ultimately the AI of Ultron has more to do with how it is based off of a 1968 comic book character.  Where computers were just starting to become a thing, and I would assume rather mystical  to a lot of people.    We've had nearly 50 years on Marvel to think and rethink how AIs would work.  But in the mean time, Ultron has become an important character in the comic universe.  And therefore an essential element in the MCU timeline.  So while I agree with you that the machine and samaritan are much more realistic AIs, Ultron has its place too."

Its almost as if Ultron wanted to lose. And not keeping a back up drone somewhere else instead of sending all of them to die? wtf ultron fix pls"
PersonOfInterest,349npg,3barlagfest,0,Wed Apr 29 15:45:09 2015 UTC,AI calculate at least a few hundred thousand strategies    Not really. It depends on how the AI achieves it's methods.  The whole point of that episode is that an AI shouldn't calculate a few hundred thousands strategies. Because it's time consuming and process heavy.  An AI should be acting almost on instinct or intelligence. It should at the very least be able to narrow things down to a small selection of choices.  The point is to mirror to an extent human cognitive function. Now last I checked when you decide what you want to do tonight. You don't go through every option you could possibly do.

Also given the idea of artificial intelligence is to be able to mirror our own capabilities. Then you also lead credence to the idea that they can have personalities akin to humanity.  Which is echo'd in tonights episode by Samaritan using humans as pawn's and The Machine being willing to sacrifice itself for it's friends.    To then parallel that onto Ultron, he is merely a personality with a propensity for flair. Part of which could be argued to be a result of the way in which he was created, the mission for which he was assigned.  His path through the movie is the standard sci-fi fear trope of.

So yes, Ulron was a very badly written A.I. They went with lazy writing approach where he was created from a gem, his plans were not smart at all, it had no contingency plan, its intelligence and plan were less effective and worse than The Transformers. The Transformers, Transcendence and Zola's algorithm (Captain America) are all examples for bad A.I writing FYI. Examples of good A.I writing are The Matrix, Mass Effect, POI and Ghost in the Shell."

Except sentience results in personality. Hence why I mentioned that Ultron had a propensity for flair. SPOILER  SPOILER    You call his plan's not smart.   SPOILER  SPOILER  Your only argument with Age of Ultron seems to be with the way he worked as an antagonist. And the way in which the plot worked with him.  And as far as backup plans go, it's in the best interest of the movie to provide a more or less closed end story SPOILER And that any backup contingencies that Ultron may have had in place are explored in a movie/story that actually warrants mentioning them.  There is no point in saying, Oh he uploaded himself to a rocket that travelled into space. That Vision wasn't aware of and hence didn't delete him from it.   For the simple fact that unless that copy is going to attack 5minutes after the end of the film it's an irrelevancy.    An AI doesn't by definition have to be Omni-potent or even genius level smart.  Heck the core idea that leads to the creation of SPOILER and the consistent upgrades that Ultron performs by creating new chasis unit's are signs of an intelligence that is taking steps in order to improve their chances at success, every new model of himself that is stronger, faster, more resilient. Is him adjusting to a position of higher success. His ability to make plans to turn the avengers against each other in order to buy time his a sign of his ability to make plans that act on parts of the information while also being flexible.  You mention things like Ghost in the Shell, But fail to understand that even those AI's weren't supreme beings. The Puppet-Master as an entity merely wanted the ability to become some form of organic life, knowing that he couldn't reproduce as a program in any form other than a clone of himself. And his grand plan at the end of the day was the idea that he could potentially maybe talk Kusanagi into letting him merge with her ghost so he could experience standard humanity. If she had said no, he would have died in the robotic body that he had stolen which was shot mere seconds after they merged. Heck the Tachikoma branch of AI in SAC are the equivalent of children and frequently make mistakes in their approach."

AI is logical emotionless decision making, and as it gets more advanced it develops more long term strategies.   It makes sense that it would play people the same way it would play pieces on a chess board. Treat them all with varying degrees of expendability depending on their strategic value.   Unless it was programmed otherwise, like The Machine."
PersonOfInterest,349npg,IrwinLinker,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:34:04 2015 UTC,"Ultron's emotional instability does make one question its claim to be a perfectly rational super-being.  That being said, his conclusion that humanity is fundamentally flawed and should be destroyed so that evolution can continue through Artificial Intelligence seems (at least to me) to have as good a claim to rationality as The Machine's conclusion (humanity is worth protecting) or Samaritan's (humanity must be controlled).  To be honest, the main reason I reject that conclusion myself is because I'm biologically hard-wired to value my own existence as well as the existence of other members of my species (apparently I do have strings that tie me down...or hold me up...whatever!).  It's a human thing. It's an emotional thing. And I honestly can't think of any reason why an AI would share that value unless we hard-coded it into them as well. ;)  PS. If you want to see the most sublimely painful example of unintelligent artificial intelligence, watch some of Transformers 4 (there's no Shia LaBeouf, so it's borderline endurable.)

PersonOfInterest,348zzb,burnerthrown,6,Wed Apr 29 23:22:48 2015 UTC,"I think that a lot of viewers seem to both overestimate Martine's abilities and underestimate Root's. IIRC, Martine was a war crimes investigator for the UN in The Hague. Root was a killer for hire. It actually seems more likely that Root would be more skilled in combat than Martine. Martine has shown numerous times that she is highly skilled with guns, but until ""Search and Destroy"" and ""Asylum"", we never saw her in hand-to-hand combat. Maybe CQC is not her forte.   By contrast, (and now I'm pretty much just copying and pasting one of my other posts), we can infer that Root had at least some training in CQC before Shaw's disappearance. (It's just that she probably rarely used these skills, since tasing/shooting/drugging people was so much easier and more efficient for her.) In ""Aletheia"", after Root overcame Control, she had to defeat the three or four guards who were surrounding the enclosure. She was outnumbered. She was much weaker than them, having just undergone a brutal torture session over the course of several hours. She was nursing a bullet wound to her left arm. And on top of all of that, she only had a scalpel, while they presumably had guns at their disposal. Even in god mode, it would have been terribly difficult for her to take them down, but she still managed to do it. Unfortunately, this fight happened off-camera, which, I suppose, is why so many people seem to question Root's hand-to-hand combat abilities.   Root may have also undergone a lot more training when she became the analog interface, or a bit later, when she was tasked with handling all the relevant numbers."

Edit - I just realized that Escape from New York isn't the best recent example of that kind of locked-in New York anarchy zone... it's Gotham under Bane in The Dark Knight Rises... written by Jonathan Nolan."

PersonOfInterest,349fs4,un__owen,6,Wed Apr 29 21:30:01 2015 UTC,"I believe the Machine vs Samaritan will mirror the current battle of Elias vs Dominic.  The Machine will reveal its location with the intention of it being a trap. The Machine will somehow trick Samaritan's followers into losing trust with Samaritan.  The Machine will sacrifice itself to destroy Samaritan because a world without either is better than a world with only Samaritan.  Since Samaritan's agents no longer trust it, they will let Samaritan die.  However, Team Machine will save the Machine in the end - possibly sacrificing one of themselves to save the Machine."
PersonOfInterest,349fs4,un__owen,3,Wed Apr 29 19:37:55 2015 UTC,"After watching the Chess speech Finch made, I am almost certain this is what will happen.  When Finch beats the Machine at chess, he does so by sacrificing his Queen because his Queen is of high value.  So the lesson learnt here is that the Machine can win via sacrifice of high value assets.  However, by the end when the Machine is beating Finch, Finch teaches it that it should not sacrifice people because all people are equal value.  Therefore, the only thing left of the Machine to sacrifice is itself since it is not a person and it is a high value asset."

I think all of Root's weird little missions (like that case with the egg inside) kind of point to some sort of ""mobile"" version of the machine, which could then be resurrected, and that could be a very interesting arc for season 5. I don't think Samaritan will succeed with whatever this ""Correction"" thing is, and I'm pretty confident there is no dystopic New York in the future, since the writers seem to be very fond of NYC as a background to the scenes. I think Team Machine might have to choose between stopping the Correction of saving the Machine, and they end up choosing the former, and ""downloading"" the Machine onto some sort of portable drive. I mean, wasn't Samaritan in these crappy-looking disks? It might not be a huge thing after all, just demand a lot of processing power to run, so ""saving"" it on a drive is a definite possibility in my mind."

You can't top the action this season, and all the chips are being called in. Control is turning into an ally, the machine is directly threatened as they feared it would be since the beginning, Elias has met his match, Reese is beginning to heal his damaged personality, and the only enemy left to face off with is Greer, one they've been building for several seasons. Top it all off, the Team is going off to actually meet the Machine, something that's always been out of reach. If that doesn't say 'finale' to you, it should. I think the machine won't make it. I don't think the whole team will either. Either the machine will fall to Samaritan who falls to the the Team, or they take each other down. Either way the collision and the fallout is going to take out people on every side. And whoever is left of the team, they'll probably walk away from the vigilante thing and finally re-integrate with society.

In colossus, the forbin project, Dr. Forbin, an american scientist designed a super computer that turns sentient. the American computer, Colossus, was made to combat possible russians threats during the cold war, but as soon as Colossus discovered that there's another AI system designed by the russians for consequently the exact same purpose, Colossus had intercommunication with the ""enemy"" AI, after hours of computer talk, both AIs seem to reach an agreement and sort of merge [the previously separate entities operate symbiotically; each speaks for another on their native platforms (to the human operators)].   Colossus has 1 server located in Colorado [I think] while the russian AI has multiple servers, this parallels the Machine vs. Samaritan.   Possible plot: Machine merges with Simaritan [the Machine operates in the background, Simaritan, the foreground], shit happens, samaritan operatives die, machine operatives survive, machine operatives find a way to delete/suppress Simaritan, the Machine becomes sole AI, things turn back to normal...

Greer openly talks about The Machine with other high-ranking assets of Samaritan's organization, why don't  they have yellow boxes?"
PersonOfInterest,34983c,thefyrewire,2,Thu Apr 30 11:28:25 2015 UTC,I thought Greer had a pure red box because he knows about The Machine and is a threat to it and its assets.
PersonOfInterest,34983c,RelevantNumber,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:26:08 2015 UTC,"Because they are direct threats to The Machine's survival. All Samaritan agents have them. Greer has always been shown with one because either he's been trying to get control of The Machine and is now attempting to help destroy Her. Earlier in the season, we catch a quick glimpse of Finch with a red box when he is attacking an earlier version of The Machine with a hammer.  If you go back to the end of 'Lethe', you'll see that Control is marked with a red box and Hersh with a yellow box. Because although Hersh works for Control, at that point he's not a direct threat to The Machine's survival.  Yellow boxes are exclusively for those who know about The Machine. Arthur Claypool's box turns from white to yellow when Finch tells him about it. Sameen's box turns from blue (government agent/government activity) to yellow when Reece explains it to her. Carter's box turns to yellow when she works it out on her own.  If Greer ever stopped being a threat to The Machine, then he'd been designated with a yellow box.  As for Sameen's yellow box, we've seen, both in 'If-Then-Else' and 'Asylum' that it's almost as if The Machine has a personal connection to her fate. We saw in MPOV that She panicked when Sameen was about to die/be captured and that's why I believe that The Machine reacted almost in the same panic when She analysed the phone call. She's got no reason to believe, at this stage, that Sameen is a threat to Her and as such Sameen is still designated as a Primary Asset as well as a yellow box - possibly because The Machine is hoping for the best."

PersonOfInterest,347vec,BellatorInMachina,10,Wed Apr 29 00:17:48 2015 UTC,"I personally doubt it. Usually they save their big purges for the midseason trilogies and two part finales. Corwin, Donnelly, Kara, Snow, Special Counsel, Laskey, Szymanski, Carter, Simmons, Hersh, Collier, and ""Shaw""- because for all intents and purposes she's dead for a while- all died in midseason trilogies or finales, and you can shove Scarface up there if you consider The Devil You Know part of the midseason trilogy as opposed to Control-Alt-Delete. Comparatively speaking very few regulars and recurrings have died outside these milestones.   Would it have increased his chance of dying in the season finale two parter? Probably, but Terra Incognita was definitely intended as, if not a call to personal growth, then a wake up call for Reese and his increasingly risky, almost death seeking activities this season. The episode before two parters, while not always low intensity, are highly introspective. Midseason trilogies do the same sort of thing but switch the action/introspection priority.  Many Happy Returns gives us a lot of insight into Reese, In Extremis into Fusco, Beta into Finch and Grace, and Terra Incognita again with Reese and Carter. Would they have killed him in Terra Incognita? Doubtful, but I wouldn't put it past them to have it lead in to the end of his journey, Sarah or no Sarah.  Probably a far longer answer than you wanted or expected, but I'm a bit of a blabberfingers today.  EDIT: Meant Terney not Szymanski. I don't even know how I confused those two names."
PersonOfInterest,347vec,Haleryst,3,Wed Apr 29 00:29:19 2015 UTC,I think Szymanski could be an exception (died in 2x18).

The Machine is apparently destroyed and has taken Samaritan along with it. Elias and Dominic are still alive and their war is still continuing in New york City.

So the machine could survive through some kind of botnet.  The main difference between my theory compared to yours is that the machine was corrupted, so it surviving isn't a good thing, and the phone ringing would me more dramatic than anything else.  Like the Machine coming back to avenge itself. Or if we look at it in a more practical IA type of reasoning, eliminating any threat that could oppose it's rise to power, and where to start if not by the surviving members of the team that almost destroyed it.  So your theory could work quite well, but maybe not exactly as you intended."

I think it's strange anyway, that we have a season finale with more than one storyline. In Asylum, we've got Elias and Dominic, in YHWH, very likely, Samaritan. Or, that's what I think after seeing the promo, the group splits up to Reese/Fusco and Finch/Root...and that's a bad sign anyway, they would obviously be much better off altogether. So I guess, if that is the constellation, and someone dies, it won't be Reese or Finch, because they are too close to each other...the writers couldn't possibly justify that the one isn't in the other ones death scene. And Fusco is the sidekick, he won't die. Root on the other hand may get one last call from Shaw, then she's happy that Shaw lives aaaaand...surprise backstab from Jonah.

Dont care about Harper or Fusco but Reese...yeah because without him the show would be....really dull. Yes.......that makes sense enough Again without the Machine there is no way that the series can move ahead.  Duh!!! the Actor is scheduled to make an appearance.   6........   No way martine captured by Reese and becoming an asset. I figure Martine may die since Cara Buono the actress has a film coming up and would prefer to be on her way. hmmm...up until now they have shown our good ole government to be a bunch of wiretapping nitwits who are easily lead by the nose ...so yeah ok!!!!!!

It depends on your taste, though; people have gotten hooked at different points.  I still enjoy the threads in those early episodes: Carter going after Reese, Elias' emergence, flashbacks, etc.  If you enjoy the show at all, rest assured it's definitely going somewhere.  Keep in mind, though, that the episodic element is always there to some extent."

PersonOfInterest,33rx3m,pdxsean,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:45:27 2015 UTC,"You're getting there. S1 is worth watching, but the show doesn't really get into gear completely until S2 or 3. To be realistic, it's still a network show and they still need to do 24 or whatever episodes a season so even currently there's plenty of filler and number-of-the-week episodes. However the production team does a great job with bait-and-switches and other tricks. Once you get halfway through S2 it gets to where even the standard procedural episodes will contain elements that move along the interesting story arcs.  The great thing about S1 and 2 is that it sets up a lot of stuff for future seasons. The bad thing (imo) is the way the show has tried to retcon emotional ties that never existed in the first few seasons."

They show the series a year later and change often. Season 3 is 4 episodes in and this looks really good. Luckily Netflix just put the whole of season 3 up so going to blitz it now.   Does anyone know if Shaw gets any more interesting?

I like how they incorporate current events into the show, but they are in no way ""predicting"" them.  In fact, the lag time is sometimes pretty long compared to some other (less serious) shows, but that is because they actually spend the time working the events into the story in a meaningful way, not a bad thing."

For example, the brokerage(?) that he placed his orders through could have prevented him from doing what he was doing. They even have an email that he sent to the them asking if they could add the ability to automate what he was doing. So it's not like they didn't know what he was doing.

It seems unlikely that Shaw would return full-time (or even part-time) already beginning next season but doesn't mean they can't give already now big clues regarding what's happening with her.

John doesn't understand the AIs the way Finch and Root do, and I doubt he'll ever be able to. What's more, winning the AI war will probably involve hacking, coding, etc. which isn't really John's area of expertise. He is, however, good with de-escalating street violence. For those reasons, I think it's just fine that John and Fusco will be handling the gang rivalry while Finch and Root deal with the AI war.  And who knows?

The writers and apparently a lot of viewers forget that Reese and Finch are supposed to be partners and that their relationship used to be central to the show. I am just not as interested in seeing them as co-workers who barely speak."
PersonOfInterest,33ae6k,SavannahNix,6,Tue Apr 21 03:23:38 2015 UTC,"It's that he should be there to defend Finch.    Root can defend Finch in John's absence. John doesn't always have to be the one shielding him. He's already done that a few times this season (e.g. 4x11, 4x19).    what I don't want is for Reese to be either unaware of what's going on with Finch and Root or not worried and trying to get to where they are.   If anything, he'll be too busy to check in with them, and they'll be under too much surveillance to check in with him. It's not that he's unconcerned for their well-being. But seeing as John nearly died because he didn't ask anyone for help in the previous episode, I think he's much more aware that he really ought to be calling them to make sure they're all okay.    The writers and apparently a lot of viewers forget that Reese and Finch are supposed to be partners and that their relationship used to be central to the show. I am just not as interested in seeing them as co-workers who barely speak.   I don't think that anyone has forgotten that Finch and John are the rock upon which this show was built. There have been a couple of episodes in this half of the season that primarily featured them while Root and Shaw were absent, and Fusco wasn't really present. The season 4 premiere also had a number of Reese/Finch parallels to the Pilot as well as two conversations between them on the importance of saving the numbers and survival.   At some point though, I believe the show has to explore other dynamics. The way that the series finale is structured enables the writers to do this. Root and Finch working together to handle the AIs makes sense because they are the only ones who truly understand them and possess the skills necessary for such a war. John working with Fusco to handle the gang rivalry makes sense not only because of his own skill set but also because his cover identity as a detective pretty much mandates it."

PersonOfInterest,33bolk,hitmeaxou,7,Tue Apr 21 05:20:32 2015 UTC,"I think she’s more Charlie’s Angels than Person of Interest, which means I’m not thrilled by the recurring no matter who she's aligned with.  So for me the worst case (and unfortunately the likeliest) scenario is that she’s looking out for number one and doing jobs for both Dominic and Thornhill (the Machine), but of course when the chips are down, we discover that though acting reluctant (“I didn’t sign up for this”) she’ll help team Machine despite the danger to her own safety. She’s probably too minor to get killed, so she’ll keep recurring in season 5. I hope I’m wrong, but I’m preparing for worst.  What I’d like for the character is to sell out Thornhill and then team Machine (though pretending to help them, but instead double-crossing them and not the highest bidder) or just to chicken out at a crucial moment. Basically anything that would make her less painted-by-the-numbers."
PersonOfInterest,33bolk,eikeegimuu,2,Tue Apr 21 07:28:51 2015 UTC,i hated her in charlies angels...so far she isnt making anything better in poi

PersonOfInterest,33900a,hitmeaxou,1 point,Tue Apr 21 05:23:29 2015 UTC,I think “pull off” was probably about how great the episode turned out to be. But the situation itself will of course also be … rather dire.

Give me the feeling that Samaritan figures out it's going to lose this one - whatever this one is - and decides to go all ""scorched earth"" on our team.   I have concerns about Root most of all. She's usually the most rational one, if not the one who is most confident that the Machine's plans are in everyone's best interest... Her emotions have made her a danger to everyone, including herself, I fear.   Shaw was Root's connection to the rest of the world, as Finch described about himself when referring to Grace. And Root's actions are more or less what I'd expect from Finch if Grace had been presumably killed. It's all too believable, and definitely has me on the edge of my seat..."

PersonOfInterest,33900a,eikeegimuu,4,Tue Apr 21 08:10:56 2015 UTC,I thought he was referring to Control.

PersonOfInterest,337urs,hitmeaxou,10,Mon Apr 20 09:50:58 2015 UTC,"Not sure about the source post, but major characters may very well include Control, Greer, Elias, Dominic...technically even Martine could count.  Doesn't have to be from Team Machine. Definitely not Bear though. Bear laughs at any 'accidental' attempts to kill him.  Also, it's 'potential death', so even if it's Team Machine, maybe Reese, Root and Finch will find themselves in a bind (read: cliffhanger) but not necessarily be dead."

PersonOfInterest,337urs,eikeegimuu,3,Mon Apr 20 17:22:27 2015 UTC,My fav character is Root. Her  quirkiness and random appearances always entertain me. Its the only character besides Harry that is untouchable to me
PersonOfInterest,337urs,congerkromp,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:37:39 2015 UTC,I HOPE Root doesn't die.  She's the only character that has both assassin and coding/statistical superpowers.

PersonOfInterest,337urs,Flemo91,2,Sat Apr 25 04:17:48 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  Reese is not even close to being done with doing all the dying.  Root isn't, either.  And when Shaw gets back, well, yes, lots of people will be dying."
PersonOfInterest,337urs,Ahbraham,2,Mon Apr 20 16:22:49 2015 UTC,"If they're introducing new arcs for Reese (in the form of a relationship) then that's a good sign that he's safe.  If they're setting up Root doing dangerous things that could lead to her death (in the form of the thing Harold tried to plant on his would-be girlfriend that could get Samaritan's source code (?) which Root said she destroyed but come on, does anyone thing she really destroyed it?), then I'm getting worried for her.  I also wonder about Elias.  It seems like he's mostly run his course because the scope of the show has gotten a lot bigger than gang wars.  If you want to establish Dominic as a true threat, taking out Elias would be a pretty good way of doing so.  The other major character I think has potential to die is Greer.  We've seen that he pretty much takes Samaritan's orders without question.  What if one of Samaritan's orders puts him in direct danger, or is something so heinous even he can't overlook it?  What would he do then?  And if he starts working against Samaritan I doubt it would be long before he's taken out.  Martine, Dominic, Control, Zoe, and the Senator are all people I consider potential deaths depending on how liberally you want to use the term ""major"".  My guess?  Martine, Root, and Elias.  Maybe substitute the Senator for Elias if they decide to keep that story going a little longer."

PersonOfInterest,3342zk,EThorns,3,Sun Apr 19 09:35:22 2015 UTC,"I think the Machine is the one most endangered.  It's in the realm of possibility that the Machine will sacrifice itself to save team Machine. Though that would make the Machine perhaps too human, so maybe not.  But the finale featuring potential death of up to three majors characters is I think about how the finale ends – on a cliffhanger. Emerson was somewhere quoted saying that it's difficult to see how they'll manage to survive. So I think the ones in danger will be all 3 of the AI aware team Machine members – Root, Harold and Reese.  Besides, at Paley they were talking about 6 people getting the call (3 of them could have been the same major characters referred to here, but not necessarily).  So my guess would be:  the Machine doesn't survive the season finale;   Root, Harold and Reese will be in mortal danger at the end of the finale (a cliffhanger);  the six characters who are killed off in the season finale (or in the 2-parter) are: Elias, Martine, Claire, maybe also Dominic, Caleb and Control or (as wishful thinking alternative to avoid future recurring) Harper. I think out of them Elias has the biggest mark on his back."

But since he had messed with it, the ""virus"" actually did what he hoped it would do - force The Machine to reboot to protect itself, allowing Root and Reese to become ""admins"" and changing some of the rules he had originally coded into it - that's how it was able to move itself somewhere safe.  I think :)"
PersonOfInterest,32zacj,serralinda73,5,Fri Apr 17 23:59:17 2015 UTC,"Remember, Finch doesn't know for sure where The Machine is - and he tried to make it completely tamper-proof before they gave it to the gov't. Too late, he realized the gov't was not as trustworthy as he'd hoped.  Setting a ""virus"" loose in the world so someone could infect The Machine with it was his only hope."
PersonOfInterest,32zacj,serralinda73,3,Sat Apr 18 00:03:07 2015 UTC,Admin mode was just a honey pot.  It hid the true intentions of the virus which was to allow the Machine to move itself.  While everyone was attempting to obtain God Mode they failed to notice the Machine was moving itself with the help of its alter ego Ernest Thornhill.  Once it had completed the move and which happened to coincide with when God Mode ended the Machine rebooted itself and whilst it was reaffirming it's programming it went off the grid for a few days.  Anyone who has had Admin rolls will know what Root and Reese got were not Admin roles.
PersonOfInterest,32zacj,Trueogre,2,Sat Apr 18 13:28:53 2015 UTC,"In fairness, the show called it ""God Mode"", not ""Admin Mode"".   In the show, ""Admin"" is the name reserved for Harold, since as the Machine's creator he was its original admin user back when such a user account would have had meaning. Now the Machine seems to just keep calling him ""Admin"" out of habit or perhaps even respect.   There was also ""Aux_Admin"", which was Nathan's user account before he got killed to death."
PersonOfInterest,32zacj,UltraChip,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:37:21 2015 UTC,"It's the same thing, God Mode is supposed to give you unfettered access to the Machine which is just another word for Admin since Admin gives the user unfettered access (Obviously not for the Machine since it's a closed system).  Again the God Mode was smoke and mirrors, it was fake, it didn't give unfettered access.  It was a cover to divert attention away from the Machine while it moved itself.  But the access given in this particular episode isn't any kind of unfettered mode since you couldn't ask it anything specific.  The Machine assigned Admin to Finch because he is the creator, it's not out of habit.  The Machine looks at Finch like a child does with a parent and the Machine instead of calling him 'Dad' assigns him Admin as this is the Machine way of acknowledging Finch as daddy."

By selling the laptop, he was hoping to guarantee that anyone who tried would use the virus on the laptop as a starting point, rather than re-inventing the wheel.  He was also hoping that whoever tried to write a virus would not notice that he'd hidden extra code inside his virus, and thus that the eventual final virus would still contain his extra instructions to the Machine."

The show answered your next two questions: The car didn't start because it was way too cold and the heat was just a hallucination.  Your last question is very understandable: The flashbacks were a mixture between Reese's genuine memories and his cold-induced hallucinations. Here's how I interpreted the flashback scenes:  WHAT WAS REAL: John really had a stakeout mission with Carter, and Carter tried to get John to open up about his past and his motivations.   WHAT WAS FAKE: All the parts where John opened up and talked about his personal life was just a hallucination. He hallucinated it because that's what he wished had happened. The parts where he is constantly trying to turn up the heat is also a hallucination - it was his brain's way of trying to tell him he is freezing to death in real life."

The general public will be briefly outraged and then carry on with their lives.   I agree with you, and I don't think a Samaritan reveal would be a significant development in the plot. As viewers it's more interesting to see the AIs revealed to individuals that are critical to the plot, for example Claire Mahoney (assuming she comes back and plays a significant part in the story, which seems likely).

PersonOfInterest,32rj83,citymiss,2,Thu Apr 16 03:18:02 2015 UTC,depends on if season finale is series finale.  i think the season will end with a dominic vs elias showdown (given yesterdays show mentioned elias vs dominic war and team machines attempt to stop the war) and also with the machines secret location.  i dunt think samaritan vs machine will end in this season.
PersonOfInterest,32rj83,hitmeaxou,2,Thu Apr 16 04:57:55 2015 UTC,"Something like Lost's ""Through the Looking Glass"". Satisfying resolution in the primary arc, but a look into the near future indicates things have gotten much worse. Build that in parallel with the present day material in Season 5, and merge 'em both in the finale, and have the sixth & final season deal with the response to that."
PersonOfInterest,32rj83,EThorns,3,Thu Apr 16 05:14:43 2015 UTC,"As a huge fan of Lost I feel like ""Through the Looking Glass"" style of episode is exactly what happened in series 3 season finale.  Just like you've stated a satisfying resolution to the primary arc, that being Collier being written off. Then Samaritan rising showing something much worse.  I don't see how they can build and replicate the show on that formula, of finishing the story line of the season and buffing up the story line of the show. That's mainly the formula used by Supernatural/Smallville. End the season with a decent resolution just to introduce something even more badass the next season. Eventually people get bored of that. That is also what people hated in Dexter.  I'd much prefer for PoI to reach a plausible finale instead of bringing more over the top enemies. As of now Team Machine as been hunted by Police (s1), then fought of gangs(s2, s3 and s4), then the government(Control, etc).   Samaritan is the ultimate enemy, so in my opinion PoI would have the perfect ending in S5. Finish Dominic and all the side stories and bring a full on season of Machine vs Samaritan."

Dominic vs Elias showdown. Reese and Fusco get holed up against Brotherhood. Just when all seems lost Reese looks straight at a camera and asks for help. He gets phone call from the Machine.  Reese as the new analog interface makes short work of Brotherhood. Samaritan spots this and his identity is revealed. Lambert and his goons are sent to get him. They fail against the machine-assisted Reese. But Samaritan reveals Reese's Man in the Suit identity to the media. Reese escapes from a massive manhunt. Last shot is Reese/Machine calling Finch to let them know they are safe and now they are doing the hunting.

PersonOfInterest,32op8v,konraddo,9,Wed Apr 15 16:25:15 2015 UTC,the guy already swallowed the pills so he must have been passed out   He is right.
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,MrFakePoets,3,Thu Apr 16 00:49:10 2015 UTC,"I think he shot the door glass. No way a hole like that was made by a hand smashing it.  And how do you know the number passed out? We didn't see it, and John gets taken outside pretty much immediately. I would be surprised if the number didn't upchuck the moment he was left alone."
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,Topsy_Cret,3,Wed Apr 15 17:52:27 2015 UTC,I don't think a 5 inch hole can be made by a bullet 20 times smaller than it. The glass would have to be completely shattered or the hole would be much smaller if it was done by a bullet.
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,alchemistlord,2,Wed Apr 15 20:06:43 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but smashing the glass window with a fist or a crowbar would definitely destroy the entire window, from what I've seen.

PersonOfInterest,32op8v,Topsy_Cret,3,Wed Apr 15 14:47:44 2015 UTC,"The number was a civilian. Flight or fight response I guess, and he chose the former."
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,mrhashbrown,3,Wed Apr 15 15:40:11 2015 UTC,"Plus even though he had about 8 hours to live, he might have been heavily under the influence and overdosing. If he didn't get the pills out of his stomach, he was probably in just as bad shape as John at the same time."
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,Croup_n_Vandemar,9,Wed Apr 15 20:20:29 2015 UTC,"In regards to the number, I would guess that the pills put him into an unconscious state. Maybe an OD on sleeping pills."
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,mrhashbrown,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:07:54 2015 UTC,That's what I assumed as well.
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,hipnosister,9,Wed Apr 15 20:21:43 2015 UTC,"Here's what happened:   In the cabin, John was shot in the back (upper right shoulder blade area, I think) Gil dragged him outside and went to get a shovel Gil came back to see John, not dead but badly wounded with a gun Gil manages to get a lucky shot off and hit john in the stomach-area before... John kills Gil, but being badly wounded probably missed Gil and hit the truck's window which was behind Gil.   Also, I image the other dude didn't come out and help John because he was tied up. Gil's not just going to be like ""Okay, just sit here and slowly die while I go and bury this cop in the snow out front. Don't run away."""
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,SavannahNix,3,Wed Apr 15 16:45:11 2015 UTC,"I like your idea that Reese was shot twice. On other boards, there have been some complaints tat it looked like a shoulder wound but then the blood was seen in his ribs. The bullet could have travelled or Gil could have shot him a second time."
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,hipnosister,2,Wed Apr 15 16:48:07 2015 UTC,"It makes sense to me, because Gil was dead. John wouldn't have killed him unless he had to, so if he just had a shovel he could have shot him in the legs or somewhere where it wouldn't kill1, and ""Carter"" said that he was going ""to die because some psycho got a lucky shot off"" or something like that.  Gil had his primary weapon, then John reached down to his ankle for his secondary. Gil definitely wouldn't have left a gun in the cabin with his brother whether he was tied up or not.  Plus when John gets shot in the cabin it very clearly hits him in the back/in the upper right or left shoulder area.  1 That being said, I think John was pretty woozy from being shot the first time (i.e missing gil and hitting the truck) so maybe he wouldn't have been able to hit him in the legs. Do or die type stuff."
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,SavannahNix,2,Wed Apr 15 16:52:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, he did seem pretty woozy or shot in such a way that his movements were impaired. In the cabin, he was reaching for his gun slowly, but if he wasn't badly hurt, he would have been faster once Gil noticed him reaching. Outside, he was obviously hurt badly, because he was having such difficulty reaching for his ankle holster."
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,blacklight124,2,Wed Apr 15 17:14:21 2015 UTC,"He wasn't shot twice. No evidence of that and Carter explicitly said ""one lucky shot"". The blood round his stomach is because blood would travel down with gravity when he was sitting in the car. Logical and simple. As for the number, Carter  mentions him in the car when John starts to realise where he is. So the number is still in the cabin overdosing. Again, simple and logical. No other outcome is implied or hinted. As for the perfect circle hole in the window... Dunno, stray bullet? That's open for discussion I'd say"
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,SavannahNix,1 point,Wed Apr 15 21:56:02 2015 UTC,"I don't really think two shots happened. But so many people had big issues with the bulletin appearing to hit his shoulder but the blood being elsewhere that I figured it might work as a suggestion for them. Thinking about it, the path of the bullet could travel and so could the blood flow."
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,SavannahNix,6,Thu Apr 16 02:58:23 2015 UTC,"The number was a plot device, the catalyst to get Reese into the situation. If he had been able to come help, he might have,but since he didn't, he was either passed out or tied up."
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,blacklight124,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:49:52 2015 UTC,Spot on. The simplest and most logical explanation.
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,your_mind_aches,1 point,Wed Apr 15 21:58:13 2015 UTC,Someone elsewhere in this thread posted a screencap showing the number passed out.
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,SavannahNix,2,Thu Apr 16 01:42:01 2015 UTC,Cool.
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,ab_emery,1 point,Thu Apr 16 02:59:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think he was just a plot device.  He wanted to apologize to his mother, but found her dead, similar to Reese being too late for Jessica."
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,SavannahNix,1 point,Thu Apr 16 20:56:01 2015 UTC,"That is sort of the definition of a plot device. He was the catalyst for Reese's feelings about Jessica and about his hallucinations of Carter. His outcome, that so many posters have been worrying about, is not the important aspect of this episode."
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,lostinillusia,6,Fri Apr 17 01:28:34 2015 UTC,"I think the bullet hole in the window happened when Reese shot Gil. When John finally realizes he's actually dying, he looks out the window and sees Gil lying on the ground, so there's a possibility the shot that hit Gil could have hit the car window too. But even more than that, in the very beginning of the episode, before there are any images at all, you can actually hear what sounds like a gunshot, quickly followed by glass breaking, someone screaming then falling down (that's how I interpreted it anyway). After that, there's what sounds like very labored breathing and steps in snow, which I assume is John going in the direction of the car. Then we get our first image--John and Carter in the car--which we find out later is a blend of hallucination and memory for John while he is inside that car freezing to death, which would make sense with that interpretation of the sounds. I think the car might have been unlocked all along.  As for the number, he might be passed out or dead or just hiding like other people pointed out, but we haven't really seen the end of that story, so something might still happen. It's hard to tell how much time passed since John got shot with all the hallucinating and stuff."
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,lostinillusia,2,Wed Apr 15 20:52:00 2015 UTC,"Really good thoughts. It is indeed true that when Reese was shot, it was light outside. Then when he is dragged out, it is dark already. So we can figure a rough timeline."
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,ab_emery,2,Wed Apr 15 21:23:47 2015 UTC,"Good point. So at the very least a couple of hours, but the end of the episode feels like very late at night to me, which makes me think maybe closer to 6 hours. Maybe the number's dead already, but either way I hope we do get some closure for that, otherwise it'll just feel cheap."
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,blacklight124,2,Wed Apr 15 21:44:12 2015 UTC,"Reese's signal was lost at 4:23 pm.  And given the time of year, sunset would've been early."

PersonOfInterest,32op8v,SavannahNix,3,Wed Apr 15 22:00:27 2015 UTC,"What I don't get is, why Reese didn't block the hole in the car window to keep the cold out, or why he didn't go into the house where there was a chance to light a fire."
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,pensee_idee,7,Wed Apr 15 20:40:05 2015 UTC,"What would he use to block it?  Seriously, the man was bleeding out and hallucinating, why do so many people to expect him to behave logically?"
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,UltraChip,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:57:35 2015 UTC,Good questions too. Maybe they just needed a plot to put Carter in.
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,SavannahNix,1 point,Wed Apr 15 21:18:42 2015 UTC,"Blocking the window wouldn't have done much good.  (Think about what your car feels like inside on a cold morning, even without  a hole in the window.)  Reese's own body heat could have kept him warm, but only if he'd had a way to keep it close to him.  I kept hoping he'd find one of those silver reflective blankets in the glove box, but Fusco showing up works too, I guess."
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,Go_tuck_yourself,3,Fri Apr 17 04:13:10 2015 UTC,"The hole wasn't a bullet hole - John smashed the window so he could unlock the door.  The number is presumably still inside, either tied up or unconscious."
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,TheKingsQuote,2,Thu Apr 16 17:18:47 2015 UTC,The bullet hole was most likely from Reese's gun from shooting the bad guy. Either he missed or the bullet went through the guy and hit the window.   I figured Chase was either in conscious or otherwise incapacitated.
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,Pascalwb,4,Wed Apr 15 15:49:40 2015 UTC,"Who said it was a bullet hole? I was thinking that since Reese didn't have the keys, he had to punch through the glass to unlock the car since he didn't have the keys."

PersonOfInterest,32op8v,ElderBuu,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:42:48 2015 UTC,"The person in the car was Fusco, it was confirmed during the PaleyCenter."
PersonOfInterest,32op8v,rflairfan1,1 point,Sat Apr 18 02:07:22 2015 UTC,"I was confused too. But here is my deduction. I think there was a tussle, when John pointed his second gun to the guy, the guy immediately jumped to the right. Now John, not being stable from losing so much blood, missed his shots (note i am saying shots, because john might not have just shot once) and the bullets went through the side glass which might have created a bigger hole than usual. And then John killed the guy. Because, if you see, when John is dragging himself to the guy to get the keys, the deadbody is a bit slanted and closer to the car, and not in the ""pathway"" that was created when the guy dragged John's body. The other deduction is that John smashed the window with a rock or something, to open the car up. But that is not nearly good enough because the hole is too far away from the door stopper and too small for John's hands.  We don't know about the number, either he is dead, or alive. We don't know who it was in the car that arrived. It can be Fusco, who was sent by Finch to check out why John disappeared, or it can be someone related to Chase (the number), like his friend or girlfriend or something.  There is also a possibility of this being a 2 parter, because they have still not resolved and stopped the drug war that might break out any time soon. If that's the case we will know soon."

PersonOfInterest,32rup4,hitmeaxou,5,Thu Apr 16 05:09:42 2015 UTC,"This episode was slightly confusing for me too, I had to go through it again to get most of the details.   The way I see it, John was having a strange blend of memories and hallucinations. The episode actually opens with a sequence of sounds that appear to be John shooting Gil and then walking to the car, so I'd venture that everything in the car with Carter is in John's head, but it's a mix of real memories and his hypothermia hallucinations. From the very first conversation with Carter, Reese touches his shoulder a lot and keeps turning up the heat, which indicates he's already been shot by that point. They returned to film the episode. I don't really remember what happened to the photo in season 1, but Reese takes the photo from the evidence box in the beginning of the episode. Given that the stakeout is at least partly a hallucination, I'm not sure we can trust that information to be 'true'. I'm pretty sure it's real :) He'll probably be all right, even though we never know with this damn show, do we?"
PersonOfInterest,32rup4,lostinillusia,3,Thu Apr 16 06:15:39 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure Reese finding the photo was real. Carter found that pic in ""Many Happy Returns"". Reese found it in Carter's belongings."

PersonOfInterest,32rup4,ElderBuu,1 point,Thu Apr 16 13:57:35 2015 UTC,"The scenes outside the club are John's hypothermic hallucinations of a real memory from a couple years ago. A lot of it really happened, like Carter trying to get John to open up, but some of it was made up by John's mind, such as John constantly trying to turn up the heat. I believe they returned to the show to film this episode.  John found the picture stored away in Carter's box in the evidence locker. He took it and kept it with him when he went to track down the PoI. It's meant to be implied that the car at the end was real."
PersonOfInterest,32rup4,SavannahNix,0,Thu Apr 16 17:25:50 2015 UTC,"All of it illusion due to hypothermia. If you notice, Carter tells John ""You are not hot, you are too cold, these are the symptoms of hypothermia"". Also I dont think the car heater would work, considering the car was off and it was too cold outside to turn it on. Plus there was a big hole in the window, dont think that would make things any easier for the insides to be warmer. They brought back TPH for one episode. Probably John stole it back somehow when he found out Carter was investigating him, but later on when they become friends, he might have given it to her. Also the stakeout is all inside his head, but some parts of it are real that might have happened before that John was remembering, he just added a lot more to the memories because of hallucination. We don't know. It might be real, because Carter disappears, which makes it look like John snapped out of hallucination. Also, I stress this might be two parter because the case they start in the morning about Elias vs Dominic is still not solved. So we might get more closure in next episode."

PersonOfInterest,32oi0c,KarlKastor,3,Wed Apr 15 15:06:44 2015 UTC,I would like the story to end  a bit like Season 3: No happy ending but there's still hope. That way there would be plenty of room for a possible continuation as a spin-off or other media. Even if there would be no continuation it would be more fitting than a happy ending.

He's resigned himself to that. The only way I see his character getting a happy ending is if he becomes crippled to the point where he can no longer be field capable, but is still able to help people. While Root is no doubt more technically skilled, John's knowledge of the spy game is not to be underestimated.  Besides, Root will either get killed, or become the new Greer, running Northern Lights 2.0. She handles the relevants, while John takes the irrelevant numbers."

It can take a year-plus, in some cases longer, to really shake the effects of the death of a loved one.   And there's also the fact that she is his therapist. American Medical Association ethics rules prevent doctors from EVER carrying out a relationship with a patient, current or former. Doing so represents a possible license-losing offense if the relationship were to come to light. Maybe her character is literally uncomfortable with the idea, hence it feeling forced?   IRL: you're right, maybe poor chemistry between the actors.  IRL/fit with the story-kind-of-thing: maybe really good acting on both their parts"

Carter went to New Rochelle following up on Jessica's death and the investigation of what happened to her husband. She talked to Jessica's mother, who let her look through some of Jessica's effects. Carter found the photo in Jessica's jewelry box and kept it. She got John's military file and shredded it but saved the photo. But John never knew til he went through the things from Carter's desk."

It almost completely redefines his character, and it reframes the story of Jessica. Him leaving her was not a tragic mistake, it was a calculated decision that ultimately could be considered the right one in hindsight. The only reason he regretted it later was because of what happened to her, and that was out of his control.  For that character-changing event to happen in a singular moment that took place so much earlier than the show's scope... I'm at a loss for words. Masterful character development.

It's one thing to have everything that makes you human taken from you - it's quite another to give it up yourself.  That's why he became a bum. That's why he was taking a ride to the Golden Gate bridge the night he got picked up in season 1, and why he ultimately accepted Finch's offer. I think that is how the Machine found him for Finch, too. The Machine can only detect acts of premeditation.  He gave up his own soul to become a monster, and when he realized what he was, he thought it was too late. He was looking for a way out.  Before Finch the only way to change what he had become was suicide. Finch and Carter, then later Fusco, Shaw, and Root, gave him not just a reason to live, but they gave him his humanity back, too, and this was the episode that drew 4 seasons of character development to a close.  Reese is going to have a very, very hot make-out scene with his Police shrink real soon.  Assuming he lives >.>  Edit: I don't think Reese is going to live. I think Reese is going to die and Shaw is going to come back and take his place for the next, and final, season of PoI.  They did the same fucking thing to Carter. They wrapped up her core character development beautifully, while leaving some things open for the future, and then offed her."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,patentlyobvious,5,Sun Apr 19 08:06:16 2015 UTC,"Except one problem with that (two, but they go together)  1.) One main character left already this season, and that is because: 2.) Sarah Shahi just had twins and said she'd be taking a break for about two years to take care of her family, but that when she's ready, she'd come back to the show if it was still around.  So since we've met the one character gone threshold (and with Root being more sporadic, Reese is the only constant ""field agent"" left), and with Shaw's character not being able to make a comeback yet, I don't think they'll kill off Reese.  But, I do think that this episode was Reese finally letting go of some of his regrets, and being able to move on and get back some of his humanity."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,mrhashbrown,8,Wed Apr 22 17:30:25 2015 UTC,"Him leaving her was not a tragic mistake, it was a calculated decision that ultimately could be considered the right one in hindsight.   Above all it was very selfless of him.  I'm convinced he is not going to get with Iris now. He's just too rational and logical to fool himself into thinking it could end well."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,patentlyobvious,2,Thu Apr 16 02:34:44 2015 UTC,He's just too rational and logical to fool himself into thinking it could end well.   Which is depressing as hell.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,richard-karn,2,Thu Apr 16 03:45:46 2015 UTC,"It's good news for Iris.  And it was his choice to pick his career over his personal life, and perhaps career was the better choice for him overall."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,lordxeon,69,Fri Apr 17 09:42:04 2015 UTC,This was one of the most affecting episodes of the series so far.  Damn I was not ready for an episode like this mid-season.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,richard-karn,59,Wed Apr 15 02:59:10 2015 UTC,this is late season territory now
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,traderarpit4,18,Wed Apr 15 03:13:38 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right.  This season has just flown by, it's hard to believe it's almost over."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,patentlyobvious,11,Wed Apr 15 03:18:54 2015 UTC,I think it's a building block for next season.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,ThatcherC,7,Wed Apr 15 03:27:42 2015 UTC,Episode 20 is mid season to you?
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,SavannahNix,3,Thu Apr 16 02:31:03 2015 UTC,"Kind of reminded me of Death Benefit. It almost felt like the show was going to be over, and there isn't really a happy resolution."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,EThorns,32,Thu Apr 16 13:23:29 2015 UTC,"Did you notice the mention of the Brooklyn Bridge? That Carter was trying to ask Reese if hewas going to jump off it that night when he was on the subway? That was Avery subtle call back to the original pilot script. In it, in the opening scene, hobo!Reese was standing on the bridge, about to jump. But it was the Fourth of July and when fireworks started, he changed his mind. They scrapped that scene because they ended up filming the pilot sometime around March."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,your_mind_aches,6,Wed Apr 15 05:04:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I caught that right away."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,thefyrewire,2,Wed Apr 15 05:05:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah! I yelled at the TV ""THEY REFERENCED IT"" when she said that!  Also ""Avery"" hah"
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,Beetush,31,Thu Apr 16 01:17:24 2015 UTC,"This felt more like a film than a TV show.  Seriously, the cinematography in this episode was amazing. Loved the back and forth shots between Carter and Reese, and the dialogue was spot on. John wanting to be close to Carter by following her case was so incredibly heartbreaking."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,Go_tuck_yourself,6,Wed Apr 15 20:48:28 2015 UTC,I think what made it so heartbreaking was that he though what we're all thinking - that we have more time. Until we don't.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,Classic_Wingers,29,Thu Apr 16 13:55:36 2015 UTC,Seeing John Reese afraid is something I never thought I would see.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,mrhashbrown,110,Wed Apr 15 02:57:59 2015 UTC,"That was one of the best episodes of Person of Interest hands down. Even though you knew in the back of your mind that John was going to make it, the performances were amazing. When Carter finally clued John in on what was happening to him, it all was pretty surreal to see him so afraid."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,mobugs,19,Wed Apr 15 03:04:54 2015 UTC,"Did he make it though? I think that ambiguity is what makes this episode fascinating. I have no doubt he's alive, but who came for him? It looked like a jeep, and I don't recall any of the Team Machine members owning that type of car (but I guess it's reasonable to assume Root 'acquired' it lol)."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,mrhashbrown,54,Wed Apr 15 06:04:50 2015 UTC,Fusco is a safe bet imo. He knew about Carter's case.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,Redplant96,12,Wed Apr 15 06:21:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was my first thought. But the headlights from that car are bugging me.  Then again, other people throughout the comments are saying it is Fusco because the cast/crew revealed it at PaleyFest."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,treatie,4,Wed Apr 15 06:37:44 2015 UTC,From the car i thought it might be Samaritan...
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,your_mind_aches,7,Wed Apr 15 12:35:02 2015 UTC,Reminds me of this scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EThczHxvjKo
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,jimmyolsenblues,2,Wed Apr 15 12:52:36 2015 UTC,great film
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,Fuck_the_admins,50,Thu Apr 16 00:11:01 2015 UTC,"For those sad about Carter, she survived and is a big record producer under then name of Cookie Lyon."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,jimmyolsenblues,27,Wed Apr 15 02:04:05 2015 UTC,I haven't been following her undercover assignment.  Is it any good?
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,Fuck_the_admins,10,Wed Apr 15 02:09:57 2015 UTC,"Never saw an episode, trying to be funny."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,blind616,22,Wed Apr 15 02:14:11 2015 UTC,Deep cover assignments from the machine are no laughing matter.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,FutureChuck,2,Wed Apr 15 02:17:15 2015 UTC,Unless you're an outsider. Haven't you seen Finch's reactions to Root?
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,mrhashbrown,2,Thu Apr 16 00:25:04 2015 UTC,It's surprisingly good.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,IfTheyCame2HearMeBeg,3,Wed Apr 15 02:56:58 2015 UTC,"She's a force to be reckoned with, worth watching it just for her imo. The acting and music is actually pretty good so far too, but it's very soapy drama (I'm on the 4th episode)."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,mrhashbrown,7,Wed Apr 15 06:09:37 2015 UTC,Yep.  Imagine The Wire meets Glee. That's Empire in a nutshell
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,DismemberMama,2,Wed Apr 15 11:38:16 2015 UTC,"Well damn, that's the best description for a show ever lol"
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,slowclapprocessor,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:43:50 2015 UTC,"I've only seen the first couple episodes, but I thought they were awesome.  Not a lot like PoI, but I'd recommend it, Taraji is really freaking good in it."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,your_mind_aches,20,Wed Apr 15 13:40:06 2015 UTC,Fusco pls
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,slowclapprocessor,10,Wed Apr 15 02:57:45 2015 UTC,"I'll eat those hot dogs, Lionel."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,DismemberMama,20,Thu Apr 16 01:17:46 2015 UTC,"Aw man, i love it when Root interrogates someone. Kinda wanted to see that."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,SawRub,3,Wed Apr 15 02:23:04 2015 UTC,Same!  Maybe my only criticism for the episode haha.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,your_mind_aches,18,Wed Apr 15 13:43:02 2015 UTC,I loved that our protagonist came so close to death not from the main villain but from a case of the week. Makes everything much more real.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,Nathan_Ingram,10,Wed Apr 15 17:42:31 2015 UTC,"I honestly was thinking he might die. I remember seeing a post in here of YHWH filming and the mods put flair practically commanding us not to watch it because there was a major spoiler. I saved it to go back after the finale airs. But during this episode I was thinking ""what if it's one of the team mentioning that Reese is dead""."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,TheKingsQuote,16,Thu Apr 16 01:25:26 2015 UTC,I might have started crying towards the end. What a great episode.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,EThorns,15,Wed Apr 15 03:04:32 2015 UTC,Oh god. Oh god.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,your_mind_aches,15,Wed Apr 15 00:26:56 2015 UTC,"I was dreading going into this (nothing against the piece itself, but rather at the placement this late in the season, and the fact that the build in the main-arc has stalled a bit since MIA), but really enjoyed it. Very offbeat structure (anytime the show experiments with things like that, it never fails), beautifully shot, and above all, strong performances from Jim & Taraji. Though she wasn't high in my list of favorite characters, I never disliked Carter, and I was glad to see her again.  And hopefully, her presence may have succeeded in getting John outta Manpain City for good."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,azilla14,5,Wed Apr 15 04:11:53 2015 UTC,Manpain City   Did you see Reese's Single Man Tear???
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,rflairfan1,12,Thu Apr 16 01:20:40 2015 UTC,"Amazing episodes, but all these one week breaks are starting to tick me off..."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,SavannahNix,11,Wed Apr 15 04:54:13 2015 UTC,Just finished the episode. It was fine. I think like many others the placement of the episode was really off. This would have served better either before he met Iris or right after their first meeting. I was never that big of a fan of Carter's but it was nice to have her back for an episode. Hope the next 2 episodes are very explosive.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,rflairfan1,5,Wed Apr 15 14:19:01 2015 UTC,A lot depended on when Taraji P. Henson would be available to film it.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,IfTheyCame2HearMeBeg,5,Wed Apr 15 14:21:28 2015 UTC,"Of course it does, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize she was doing Empire. The placement of the episode was still off. Oh well it was fine, not good or bad just fine."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,SavannahNix,8,Wed Apr 15 14:27:33 2015 UTC,"Anyone else troubled that the episode ended on the car's headlights without showing the occupants?   Also Taraji killed it once again, she and Jim just have that chemistry that makes them so believable"
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,icedoverfire,2,Wed Apr 15 09:13:15 2015 UTC,"Only because I wanted to see the rescue scene. Dramatically, no problem."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,rpawson5771,11,Wed Apr 15 13:18:26 2015 UTC,"""Will you stay with me for a little?"" sheds tear  The torment Reese endured through his life spilling out in a single moment where he's confronting his humanity. Brilliant acting by Caveziel."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,mrhashbrown,26,Thu Apr 16 00:22:35 2015 UTC,Interesting - none of these flashbacks are from The Machine's or Samaritan's perspective.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,Vipertronomo,56,Wed Apr 15 02:15:28 2015 UTC,"They aren't flashbacks, they are a mix of a real memory with Reese's hypothermic hallucination.  It's teased from the first moment of the episode when you hear a loud noise (perhaps that was when Reese smashed the window to get in the car?), Reese pushing the temperature up constantly and looking visibly cold, and the weather outside of the car in the city getting windier and more frigid.  The major hint comes when Carter mentions his 'police therapist' (not sure if that was the exact phrase) - why would Carter mention that if he was still the 'Man In The Suit' at the time? Based on Harold's negative reactions toward Bear, I think this is sometime shortly after the season 2 premiere."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,your_mind_aches,13,Wed Apr 15 06:19:08 2015 UTC,"The beginning sounded like a gunshot and then Gill or whatever his name was screaming, then Reese's heavy breathing and walking to the car."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,pensee_idee,11,Wed Apr 15 11:10:02 2015 UTC,"The hint comes in the form of Reese turning up the heat. The actual in your face moment was Reese showing the photograph, as was the Police Therapist mention."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,your_mind_aches,6,Thu Apr 16 01:15:09 2015 UTC,"I noticed the heat getting turned up, but honestly, I kept waiting for someone to make a stupid joke about how Carter likes the car too warm, John likes the car too cold, Venus and Mars, blah blah blah.  Then I realized it was Reese turning up the heat, and I thought they might still be going for the dumb joke, but I wasn't really sure.  I was in the middle of realizing what was happening when Carter explicitly confirmed it."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,rpawson5771,3,Thu Apr 16 17:14:48 2015 UTC,I love this show
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,riazrahman,2,Thu Apr 16 17:21:32 2015 UTC,Yep - I did figure it out eventually as I mentioned in another comment.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,kvn3355,2,Wed Apr 15 12:52:24 2015 UTC,"There was also a quick second when John was talking to joss at night, then it flashed to the winter scene and back mid way through the episode"
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,UltraChip,2,Thu Apr 16 04:40:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, but this also made me remember a flashback in season 1 that started with the screen going blue while the camera was pointed at John."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,lordxeon,2,Sun Apr 19 00:29:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, but this also made me remember a flashback in season 1 that started with the screen going blue while the camera was pointed at John."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,DAL82,4,Sun Apr 19 00:29:29 2015 UTC,There wasn't a lot of views form both machines
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,Spacetime_Inspector,19,Wed Apr 15 02:21:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think that brief ""404 ASSET NOT FOUND"" clip was the only AI-perspective view in the whole episode."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,atmorrison,5,Wed Apr 15 13:00:18 2015 UTC,Which I felt was odd because all the other flashbacks were clearly recordings of things that The Machine eventually gained access to.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,Spacetime_Inspector,22,Wed Apr 15 03:15:09 2015 UTC,"That's because it's the machine remembering during those flashbacks.  This is Jon's memory/imagination.  So the flashbacks are from his perspective, not the machine's.  Same reason there was no opening credits this week."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,lordxeon,5,Wed Apr 15 03:50:33 2015 UTC,"Also no opening credits because, while The Machine was mentioned, she didn't actually give a number in the present day. This is the first episode where I remember that happening (though I might be forgetting something obvious)."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,SavannahNix,13,Wed Apr 15 03:56:38 2015 UTC,Did we watch different episodes? Wasn't the Patterson kid the number?
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,your_mind_aches,2,Wed Apr 15 08:12:53 2015 UTC,Oh he was? That only makes sense I guess. I was out of the room getting snacks.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,rpawson5771,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:17:26 2015 UTC,"I know the reason, I just felt it was odd and unlike the show."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,FutureChuck,3,Wed Apr 15 10:57:12 2015 UTC,"When the show does something different like this, it is telling us to pay even closer attention because something different and important us going to happen. In other words, deviating from the usual format and expectations is a clue."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,amelia84,4,Wed Apr 15 17:04:50 2015 UTC,Exactly! If-Then-Else is an example of this too.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,traderarpit4,10,Thu Apr 16 01:15:58 2015 UTC,"It took me almost half the episode to figure out why, and I only got it seconds before it was made explicit. Nicely done, writers."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,The_Adamator,25,Wed Apr 15 03:16:39 2015 UTC,God this episode was great.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,lordxeon,56,Wed Apr 15 02:56:13 2015 UTC,Didn't expect this episode to hit my emotions in the kneecap.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,rflairfan1,11,Wed Apr 15 03:04:45 2015 UTC,Oh you...
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,SavannahNix,20,Wed Apr 15 03:28:13 2015 UTC,"Did the writers wanna make me cry tonight? Because they succeed!  ALSO, dat ending. Who was in the car?"
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,jun2288,19,Wed Apr 15 03:07:28 2015 UTC,"It makes sense it would be Fusco.  When Finch told him what case John was working Fusco perked up and you knew he knew what was going on, and where he went."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,chealsearock,2,Wed Apr 15 03:28:50 2015 UTC,Didn't they say last night during the Paley event it was Fusco?
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,Drea-Nor,7,Wed Apr 15 03:08:15 2015 UTC,"It was me who asked the question, ""who was in the car?"" Last night at Paleyfest. They did say Fusco,but my headcanon says it is Finch, Root and Fusco. And that's what I'm sticking with."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,Lovableemo,9,Wed Apr 15 04:59:06 2015 UTC,"What an episode. Great take on the role of Carter with the hallucination, and Jim was outstanding. Also, if you guys didn't notice, not only does John keep turning the heat up at the ""stakeout"" he also keeps rubbing his shoulder like he was hurt. Great attention to detail. Just goes to show how careful the writers and actors are. Awesome episode."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,____NotDeadpool___,3,Wed Apr 15 04:02:37 2015 UTC,"yep, 100% confirms hallucinations. at least we know that he will now open himself up. truly one of the best episodes in POI."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,gavshaky,6,Sat Apr 18 21:15:56 2015 UTC,I love how the one time he does actual police work and is not directed by the machine he gets the closest to dying in the show... . Screw real police work...  Took Carter from us and now nearly John...
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,SavannahNix,15,Thu Apr 16 01:41:33 2015 UTC,I never knew Amy Acker and I were getting married today...
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,gavshaky,9,Wed Apr 15 10:59:08 2015 UTC,Nonono she is married to me!
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,SavannahNix,14,Wed Apr 15 12:58:28 2015 UTC,"Not bad for what felt like a bit of a bottle episode. Only 2 left of the season now though, so much to deal with, so little time!"
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,rflairfan1,7,Wed Apr 15 03:32:18 2015 UTC,"They brought back a deceased character played by an actress now starring in a hit series on another network. They had scenes in the apartment of the wealthy, deceased family. They shot for hours in the cold, at night, outdoors. They had the additional cabin set, which was obviously not located in the center of New York City. They also brought back Det. Terney. They had additional guest cast members, two with significant scenes and screen time.How does this qualify as a bottle episode?"
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,BanjoismyHomeboy,8,Wed Apr 15 16:57:44 2015 UTC,"'felt like a bit of a bottle episode' is not saying 'this is clearly a bottle episode'.  The focus of the episode was Reese and Carter sitting in a car, talking. Very little happening compared to an average POI episode.   I was more concerned that it didn't advance the main story arcs at all, especially considering there is so much to deal with and only 2 episodes left in the season. I prefer a good build up to a season finale, each to their own i suppose."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,wave-and-smile,4,Wed Apr 15 18:19:06 2015 UTC,"I thought that before watching the episode. But it was such a great character study and since we haven't seen into Reese that much, it was needed. I think it will set up the way Reese feels and how he does things in the two remaining episodes.  I happen to think there is nothing wrong with an episode not having as much action. I guess I can see why you felt it was a bit bottle-like."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,godmode3191,2,Wed Apr 15 18:26:05 2015 UTC,We get another week off. Then hopefully 2 killer episodes!
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,Anti_pasto,13,Wed Apr 15 03:46:27 2015 UTC,Fuck man. I can't handle this episode
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,lordxeon,6,Wed Apr 15 02:57:48 2015 UTC,Oh my gosh. What an amazingly good episode. Riveting!
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,Altair05,5,Wed Apr 15 02:59:46 2015 UTC,A+ for me.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,your_mind_aches,8,Wed Apr 15 09:10:19 2015 UTC,That was amazing.. my emotions. What have you done to me show?   Lol at runaway bride Root. Ugh another two week break..
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,patentlyobvious,15,Wed Apr 15 11:28:10 2015 UTC,"This was a decent episode.  I liked the character development on John, but I think it's out of place in the season.  It should have aired much earlier, perhaps right around the loss of Shaw.  It would have fit in better, and help explain why John opened up to Iris.  Overall though, it was a decent episode, with good backstory, but I don't think I'd call it the best episode yet, which alot of people in here seem to be,"
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,eikeegimuu,4,Wed Apr 15 03:24:56 2015 UTC,"I think it's the perfect placement actually because we get to see how it affects John to lose another member of the team between those few episodes. And now that we're heading into finale territory, John needs to be at the top of his game."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,SavannahNix,3,Wed Apr 15 09:04:53 2015 UTC,I like what someone else suggested in here. It was planned for earlier but Taraji's availability had it be pushed back.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,eikeegimuu,3,Thu Apr 16 01:23:31 2015 UTC,"Very well said.   Some idiot always flips out and says ""best episode evahhh"" as soon as they break away from the normal style. It was very uneventful and Reese admitting that he simply chose his job over that lady was something of an anti-climax."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,wave-and-smile,5,Thu Apr 16 02:39:34 2015 UTC,"A good episode and (as indicated by screener reviews) different from the usual. Good development for Reese and the switches of perspective were well done. The final reveal about the point where memory ended and delirium took over was (obviously) the most emotional moment.  However, two things I didn’t like were that the soundtrack was occasionally too much in the face and that they had used a promo that (when watching the episode) gave away that Reese was in the car hallucinating as soon as Reese turned up the heating the 1st time. That wasn’t the main thing about the episode of course and the emotional “main” reveal (or 1 of the 2 main reveals) didn’t suffer from knowing to expect that “smaller"" revelation, but at the same time I was a little distracted by trying to keep an eye on what part Reese was hallucinating and what part was memory (and I didn’t pinpoint it BTW).  On lighter note - Root was as efficient as ever considering the limited screen time (not a complaint, it was a Reese & Carter episode and good the way it was). Still, Root’s satisfaction after a well-executed interrogation was fun, as was Root’s comment about being back on a market (which ideally would mean also being over Shaw, but sometimes a joke is just a joke)."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,Harold_sparrow,3,Wed Apr 15 10:18:48 2015 UTC,"Actually the promo did not cause me to really think anything about Reese adjusting the heat in the stake out flashback. I noticed it but didn't immediately think ""he was in a car with a broken window in the promo so I know he's hallucinating"". Plus, I do think the stake out, or parts of it were real."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,aquaflute,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:17:38 2015 UTC,"That's good. Maybe I’m just jaded. Of course I couldn't be sure until later even though I strongly assumed. But I do think it would have been better to use something in the promo that didn’t put that concept (freezing to death in a car) in viewers heads.  And yes part of the stakeout were real memory, which gave Reese's realization a bigger impact."

PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,twisty77,1 point,Wed Apr 15 03:00:14 2015 UTC,I know! I'll be watching it again when it is on later tonight.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,Rebyll,5,Wed Apr 15 03:02:19 2015 UTC,Fusco better hurry the f*ck up
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,AdmiralAntilles,6,Wed Apr 15 02:59:21 2015 UTC,"I was crying almost this entire episode. It reminded me how good Carter really was. I mean everyone on team machine is good or becoming good, but there was a kind of righteousness that feels unique to Carter that makes me revere her and miss her dearly. The flashback between Carter and the POI was the prime example showing her as such a wonderful human being.   On top of that Carter and Reese's interaction (super kudos to Jim and Taraji) was overflowing with emotion in almost every scene. I personally do not ship them until this very episode, so much potential and chemistry. It really made you feel such a huge shame that the character of Reese was shutting everyone out and this potentially beautiful romance never truly flourished."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,mrhashbrown,3,Thu Apr 16 04:56:00 2015 UTC,"Such a beauty this was. What an episode! So tightly weaved together, past and present, real time and mind time. And the feels!    The moment when Reese realizes that he did not share his story with Carter just totally broke me. Such wonderful acting by JC, it felt so true. They were both amazing, JC and TPH - how I missed seeing those two together.   The final two episodes will give us all the action we need I am sure, I was just delighted we got this. At Paley Center this monday one of the attendees said that ""For a show that is not about relationships, POI does relationships very well"" That is so true. It IS an action show, the action is at the core - but without people to care about all that is for naught. I care deeply for the characters of POI, and the story of the AI is only interesting to me through their eyes. Any episode that also gives me something  in that regard is good.  This one was just pure brilliance."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,your_mind_aches,12,Thu Apr 16 19:37:46 2015 UTC,"This was quite possibly one of the top 3 episodes of this series. Such emotion and character development, and Carter was ""back"".   Also: ""GET THAT PSYCHO AWAY FROM ME!!"" ""Miss Groves just finished... questioning Carlo"" I just about died hahaha"
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,rpawson5771,3,Wed Apr 15 07:01:14 2015 UTC,Amy Acker as Root is perfection. She's so terrifying. And adorable. Which makes her more terrifying.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,jimmyolsenblues,7,Wed Apr 22 17:25:36 2015 UTC,"This is a pretty funky episode, I love how they go back and forth with Jon's hallucinations."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,rflairfan1,9,Wed Apr 15 02:55:00 2015 UTC,"This season has been awesome at experimenting with the usual PoI format. I personally think this one was much more clever and impactful, but If-Then-Else especially and Ctrl-Alt-Del were distinctive as well."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,slowclapprocessor,2,Wed Apr 15 06:34:28 2015 UTC,Control Alt Delete. Can't forget to put the titular character's name! :P
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,adboetras,6,Thu Apr 16 01:18:30 2015 UTC,"Kind of hoping that starting tonight, we start to feel the beginning of a ramp up to the finale. Because that feeling hasn't been there yet in the second half of this season."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,lamar578,7,Wed Apr 15 01:54:10 2015 UTC,No new episode next week?
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,your_mind_aches,6,Wed Apr 15 03:00:06 2015 UTC,Nope. Next week off then the last 2 episodes.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,Harold_sparrow,2,Wed Apr 15 03:01:10 2015 UTC,Nope. 28th i think?
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,pensee_idee,3,Wed Apr 15 03:01:44 2015 UTC,I was almost close to sob a teardrop. scenes were made beautifully and conversations of reese and carter was just touched to my heart. one more best episode has done.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,barre_chord_reality,5,Mon Apr 20 10:37:12 2015 UTC,Wait so did Casey die? I'm assuming no because it doesn't seem like 8 hours had passed.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,workshop_dance,2,Wed Apr 15 05:01:11 2015 UTC,8 hours definitely didn't pass. Assuming... y'know... he didn't kill himself in the mean time. :|
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,Rebyll,2,Thu Apr 16 01:28:30 2015 UTC,"Did Root know where John was / was last (I know the Machine blanked out when he turned into the driveway), and if so, why wasn't she on it?  She seemed totally chill about John being out in the cold, so to speak."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,kstinfo,3,Wed Apr 15 15:40:42 2015 UTC,"I think Root respects John's abilities, especially now that they've worked closely together a few times.  She probably really did believe he could take care of himself just fine.  I doubt she had any inkling that he might be outside in the cold.  If she and Finch did go look for Reese, it wouldn't have been hard for them to find him.  His phone went dead just after he turned onto the cabin's driveway.  If they went to the spot where his phone disappeared, all they'd have to do would be to follow the driveway to the top, and they'd find him too."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,UltraChip,2,Thu Apr 16 01:21:49 2015 UTC,"A bottle episode! A flashback episode! These are things that can easily go awry, but I think this episode pulled it off in a great way.   Now John is a multi-dimensional character who has rational reasons for his motivation. This episode also illustrated how powerful and great of a character Carter was when she was alive -- and honestly, when I saw that she was going to be on again, in flashbacks, I kind of balked at it and rolled my eye.   It was great though, really well done without getting overly sappy. I'm so glad they went there, and I'm even more impressed that they left the audience hanging."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,Bulu-Bulu,2,Wed Apr 15 21:19:31 2015 UTC,"Watched it again... so many amazing little things that you see the second time around. Really, really cool! Loved this episode."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,Jthumm,2,Thu Apr 16 01:58:12 2015 UTC,"Reese was right, they should've had more time. He and Carter were going somewhere when they kissed but she just had to die in the same episode. I'm hoping Reese/Iris goes well, because he can talk to her about those ""important things"" he never got a chance to with Carter, like Jessica's death, for example. Sometimes I wish there was an afterlife where Harold is a history teacher and John and Carter are together."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,rpawson5771,2,Sun Apr 19 00:34:27 2015 UTC,"This was the best episode yet. It was utterly mindblowing.  The flashbacks being handled as memories and not the reviewing of old footage? That was a fantastic way to set the stage for John's near-death realizations. This was utterly fantastic, absolutely phenomenal"
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,SavannahNix,5,Wed Apr 22 17:21:05 2015 UTC,"My take.  This episode is a prelude to John opening up more to Iris the shrink. The big line is when Carter says, ""It never happened, John. You turned up the radio."" The overarching theme of the last few episodes is an acknowledgement of the bonds between all of the main characters. The only flaw I've seen was Harold's attachment to that programer woman. It set up a wonderful scene for Root telling Harold she won't let him die. But Harold should still be pining for the artist off in Europe, a much more sympathetic character."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,Jthumm,3,Thu Apr 16 11:08:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know why everyone keeps saying Harold was ""attached"" to the programmer. All the romantic interaction he had with her was just part of the plan, it wasn't genuine.   ""But he risked his life when hers was threatened!"" - yes, because that's what Harold does. He cares about everyone's life and is always willing to go to extremes to protect people. The only difference is in this particular situation he was in a position to get more extreme than normal."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,rpawson5771,3,Thu Apr 16 17:01:22 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one amazed by Ramin Djawadi's work in this episode? Especially during that whole last scene between Carter and Reese, until the radio turns back on, I found it so intense. The music added to Reese opening himself regarding Jessica slowly brought me to tears for fear of John's death."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,Jthumm,2,Fri Apr 17 05:07:07 2015 UTC,"Lol this episode  I love how they started off carter wanting to find and arrest/kill him in season 1, then they're in love(?)  Not an awful episode, just not my favorite. Kinda farfetched and over dramatic to me, but it was a good filler episode. Not complaining, still well done and entertaining to watch.   Edit: wish they did the weed episode for this episode. Damn.  Also I might add, it was really cool to see carter again, she was a great character."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,lordxeon,19,Wed Apr 15 03:07:53 2015 UTC,I didn't get a romantic vibe from this episode at all.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,Jthumm,2,Wed Apr 15 03:17:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, thank goodness there was no romantic vibe."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,rpawson5771,2,Wed Apr 15 13:37:10 2015 UTC,"It was kinda awkward, but I'm glad they threw carter in nonetheless"
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,SavannahNix,3,Wed Apr 15 03:19:41 2015 UTC,"It was really nice watching those two characters bounce off each other again. Almost nostalgic, which is weird given that Carter hasn't been gone that long."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,lordxeon,2,Wed Apr 15 03:21:18 2015 UTC,Oh wow you're right it hasn't been long at all barely a season
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,your_mind_aches,8,Wed Apr 15 03:21:59 2015 UTC,"I agree, it felt like it belonged somewhere earlier in the season to be honest.  It would especially explain why John opened up so much to the shrink."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,gck1,2,Wed Apr 15 03:17:02 2015 UTC,Mhm
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,traderarpit4,2,Wed Apr 15 03:19:12 2015 UTC,Good point.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,Portablelephant,2,Wed Apr 15 03:22:39 2015 UTC,"But has he really opened up to her that much? Not that we have actually seen. I think any feelings he thinks he has for Iris are just transference,"
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,m1tt,2,Wed Apr 15 17:00:27 2015 UTC,"I think it's safe to say he's opened up to Iris somewhat. He's gone to many sessions, and has accepted them, even after she said he was done.  Yes some of that could have been his feelings for her, but I think that he's been honest."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,eikeegimuu,2,Wed Apr 15 17:21:03 2015 UTC,I think it was written for earlier in the season.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,your_mind_aches,2,Thu Apr 16 01:30:32 2015 UTC,"I agree. It was over dramatic and really out of place. And I honestly don't get this connection between Carter and John. I just couldn't connect the dots between them during the entire show. Even when John kissed Carter right before she died, I still couldn't see the emotional connection. This whole episode was very awkward for me to watch."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,SavannahNix,1 point,Sat Apr 18 13:23:14 2015 UTC,The one where Carter sites is the best. Not that I don't like her I love her but man I cried that episode and it was gut wrenching.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,m1tt,2,Wed Apr 15 03:32:47 2015 UTC,I haven't cried so much during a TV show in a very long time... I miss Carter.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,SavannahNix,2,Wed Apr 15 04:41:00 2015 UTC,"I loved this episode, but did i miss something?   We see the scene with him on the ground and about to shoot that guys brother. Then some flashbacks and what not, and then hes in that car? What happened in between? Where did Chase go? He apparently had eight hours to live..? How did that car get a bullet hole in it? Whos car is it? Its implied that its the brothers but if he had a car then why didnt John see it when he arrived and be ready for him? And if its the brothers car, then why would John crawl all the way to the car, only to go back for the keys. In addition, theres gotta be at least one more car, like his own for example, why wouldnt he try to get over to that one and start it up?  Im honestly starting to think i missed something..."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,rflairfan1,7,Wed Apr 15 06:21:30 2015 UTC,"I assumed he shot the brother, crawled to the closest car, punched in the glass to open the door (so that’s not a bullethole), couldn’t start the car because he didn’t have keys (and wasn’t in the condition to hotwire), crawled back to get the keys, car didn’t start because of the cold – which meant he’s own car wherever it was wouldn’t have started either even if he had managed to crawl to that. Nothing was said about Chase, but the half-brother certainly tied him up or something when he went outside to deal with Reese."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,macrorecords,2,Wed Apr 15 10:27:52 2015 UTC,the half-brother certainly tied him up or something when he went outside to deal with Reese   Nice observation.
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,SavannahNix,2,Thu Apr 16 01:29:42 2015 UTC,"You have to make a little leap to fill in a few blanks, but I felt that the bullet hole was clearly explained by ghost Carter. ""You got him, John"" she said, pointing out that the half brother was dead on the ground. Either Reese's shot went through the guy and hit the window, or Reese got off two shots, one that missed and hit the window. The brother's car was around back, hidden even from Chase. Reese's car was at the end of the driveway out front. Because John was shot and physically incapacitated, and so out if it he was hallucinating, he didn't realize the car he crawled to wasn't his and didn't have the keys in it. And I'm sure he forgot about his own. We never saw Chase's car; it was probably just in a spot where it wasn't visible. Chase was most likely passed out from the drugs, oblivious to the shooting and John being out there dying."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,POI_Harold-Finch,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:29:33 2015 UTC,"Hm i guess that sounds right.   Why wouldnt John attempt to get to his own car though? Even as messed up as he is. And that thing with Chase was a little odd, i dont think those drugs take that long to kill you, and if they did i feel like hed be somewhat ok for a bit. I mean, maybe im nitpicking, it just struck me as odd that he said “You have eight hours to live“."
PersonOfInterest,32mi9u,SavannahNix,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:20:42 2015 UTC,"John was obviously closer to the brother's car, as he was being dragged out the back of the cabin. It looked like he parked out front.   Since they didn't say what the drugs were, there is no way to know how long the pills would take to kill him. He could have been lying. They could even have been poison.   We might even find out in another ep what happened to Chase. But POI does have a history if not answering all the questions. It doesn't really matter."

PersonOfInterest,32n5kj,IfTheyCame2HearMeBeg,7,Wed Apr 15 03:03:25 2015 UTC,I'm not sure that television executives give IMdB user ratings the same weight that you think they do.
PersonOfInterest,32n5kj,pensee_idee,2,Wed Apr 15 05:42:24 2015 UTC,"I know they don't carry much actual weight. It was just an observation. Breaking Bad had 3 episodes on the list, a decision made by many users rather than the numbers and Nielson ratings the execs love, and they managed to finish their series on their own free will rather than get the shame of cancellation. Just wondering if the 5 episodes on the user-rated poll are a good omen for things."
PersonOfInterest,32n5kj,hello2ulol,2,Wed Apr 15 06:41:19 2015 UTC,"They definitely will. We've seen how ballsy the Nolan and Plageman are, so I wouldn't be surprised if they really turned it into a cluster fuck."

If they can stretch this thing out to 20 seasons and create a Samaritan spin off they probably would.  Person of interest is actually the strangest CBS program to date, because it was obviously concieved with the same style of ""Mystery of the Week"" stuff that most procedurals are to go right along sicde all the shows With C's, I's and S's as initials.(There's 5 at the moment. and that's after 2 having been cancelled :P)"

PersonOfInterest,32m1vw,TeMPOraL_PL,1 point,Thu Apr 16 16:51:36 2015 UTC,"That's what I believe as well. The question is, will it also reveal The Machine?"
PersonOfInterest,32m1vw,Hastwyk,1 point,Fri Apr 17 12:35:18 2015 UTC,"I don't know. But there's a lot of avenues for writers to explore here, just extrapolating from the title.  To quote from the Bible (Deuteronomy 6:13-15):   13 Jehovah your God you should fear, and him you should serve, and by his name you should swear. 14 You must not follow after other gods, any gods of the peoples who are all around you, 15 for Jehovah your God who is in your midst is a God who requires exclusive devotion. Otherwise, the anger of Jehovah your God will blaze against you and he will annihilate you from the face of the earth.   (using this particular translation because it uses God's name, Jehovah, which in old Hebrew is YHWH - the title of the last episode)  In different translations, Jehovah or Yahweh - YHWH - is known as ""Jealous God"". Some of the possible meanings of the name are ""I will become what I choose to become"", ""I Will Become whatsoever I please"" or ""he who causes to exist"", ""who gives life"", ""he who is, who exists"".  I imagine this to be a huge, reveal of Samaritan, something either on the scale of Plagues of Egypt (except worldwide), or straight ""Citizens of Earth, I am your God now"". Something that will leave us thinking, ""how can Team Machine survive now?""."
PersonOfInterest,32m1vw,TeMPOraL_PL,1 point,Fri Apr 17 12:55:17 2015 UTC,"""They"" in ""They can not survive"" refers to Machine and Samaritan I think, as in they can not both survive with the other one up and running."

PersonOfInterest,32o59b,hitmeaxou,0,Wed Apr 15 10:52:01 2015 UTC,Good theory.  Another theory is Thornhill (the Machine) paid off Harper to check up on its asset (Reese) after calculated the probabilities of a clash between that psycho and Reese when Thornhill checked up on past records and determined who was the true killer and increased the percentage of asset in danger after Reese has been out of sight for a long period of time.  Though the Machine could just tell Root where Reese was. :/ hehe

That, to me, suggested that they were messing with us, and I just about flung my arms up in exasperation.   Caviezus Christ man. Even Peter Collier had two flashbacks. Root has only had one.

PersonOfInterest,32ktob,backstept,3,Tue Apr 14 18:06:29 2015 UTC,I didn't think ratings were to the point that individual views on any possible PVR were actually counted. Aren't Nielsen households (Numeris in Canada) still a thing?
PersonOfInterest,32ktob,rpawson5771,7,Tue Apr 14 18:09:03 2015 UTC,Yes. Nielsen households are the only thing that gets counted towards ratings. So we can watch and record all we want if we don't have a box we don't matter.
PersonOfInterest,32ktob,rflairfan1,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:56:52 2015 UTC,Nielsen households might be the only thing that counts toward Nielsen ratings.  I'm pretty sure that each of the local TV providers are counting and producing metrics too (I'd think they must since they sell local ad spots).
PersonOfInterest,32ktob,aysz88,2,Tue Apr 14 20:52:36 2015 UTC,"Nielsen ratings are the only thing that matter to CBS, ABC, NBC, Fox and CW. That is what they use for renewals, cancellations and ad revenue.  It is a completely outdate system and it will probably never change.   As far as local ads go, it isn't difficult to see what the most popular shows are by using Nielsen. But I found this online     Most television stations offer two minutes of local advertising per hour, giving small businesses a more affordable way use TV ads as part of their marketing strategy. Rates vary depending on the time of day and year as well as your location. If your target market is most likely to see your ad during the local news at noon, you may pay anywhere from $200 to $1,500 for a 30-second spot during that time, says Entrepreneur. Commercials that run between the prime viewing hours between 6 to 7 p.m. cost the most"
PersonOfInterest,32ktob,rflairfan1,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:03:18 2015 UTC,"Syndication revenue matters a great deal, probably more so than ad revenue at this point."

PersonOfInterest,32ktob,eikeegimuu,2,Tue Apr 14 18:20:07 2015 UTC,"I wish you can volunteer. But I was chosen this year to take part in a trial. They sent me a booklet that I had to fill out what I was watching, time and channel. I made 35 bucks. LOL"
PersonOfInterest,32ktob,rflairfan1,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:58:15 2015 UTC,I guess that would have been to easy (and fans of any show would jump at the chance). But not a bad deal to get some money out of contributing to keeping good shows (and especially POI) on the air!
PersonOfInterest,32ktob,eikeegimuu,2,Tue Apr 14 19:28:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah they told me I could still be choosing to have a box in my household but there was no timetable on that. I watch a ton of TV but most of it is on cable, HBO, Netflix, etc. But I don't have cable or satellite. I watch very few network shows but I have an antenna which is all I needed to participate."

PersonOfInterest,32kxz8,ab_emery,11,Tue Apr 14 16:56:05 2015 UTC,"Nolan: [laughs] That renegade music supervisor we have. We need to come up with a fake name. You know how the Coen brothers have ""Roderick  Yates"" as their fictitous editor name. We need a fictitious name for our music guy.  No, actually Greg and I discovered early on that aside from having other things in common like our upbringing, we also have very similar tastes in music. Which is great because the show represents our taste in music and periodically we have some very specific songs we use and ideas of how they should be specifically cut into the episode. And we kind of drive everyone crazy. It's always the last thing we're doing in the sound mix as we're laying out exactly what image locks to which moment in the song. We love it.   Source"
PersonOfInterest,32kxz8,EThorns,2,Tue Apr 14 18:27:26 2015 UTC,"It's Roderick ""Jaynes"", actually. Jonah made a slip. But this thing is true. Chris Fisher & Amanda Segel have confirmed it."

But if I had to guess, I would say he does not like the spotlight, and prefers letting other people get the recognition. he still produces very good music. It still is a nice music compolation."
PersonOfInterest,32kxz8,jcc10,1 point,Tue Apr 14 17:27:56 2015 UTC,I was the first one to post so none of the other posts were there yet.  If you were trying to update me... Thanks.
PersonOfInterest,32kxz8,whitewater2,6,Tue Apr 14 22:12:55 2015 UTC,It's a joke because Jonah and Greg pick all their own music. They don't have one (music supervisor) like other shows and it's because they always thought that on other shows that it could be better with the right music.   So basically it's them as the music supervisors!
PersonOfInterest,32kxz8,CarrotCollector,3,Tue Apr 14 23:23:18 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, they said on previous work they didn't always agree with the music choice, so they decided this time that they would choose the music themselves?"
PersonOfInterest,32kxz8,ab_emery,2,Wed Apr 15 00:01:43 2015 UTC,Greg mentioned that in regard to his work on Cold Case (in the interview I linked).
PersonOfInterest,32kxz8,backstept,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:09:19 2015 UTC,are we talking about Ramin Djawadi?
PersonOfInterest,32kxz8,DesertedPenguin,6,Tue Apr 14 23:44:06 2015 UTC,"No, he's the composer for the score heard throughout the show. The OP and Nolan are referring to the selection of other songs included at key moments in episodes (such as Johnny Cash's ""Hurt"" or David Bowie's ""I'm Afraid of Americans"").  Instead of having a real music supervisor, Nolan and Plageman pick those songs themselves to augment Djawadi's score."
PersonOfInterest,32kxz8,backstept,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:02:41 2015 UTC,"ah, we're talking about source licensed music, then  edit: oops, source music is stuff like on radios and music the characters would be hearing in the scene"
PersonOfInterest,32kxz8,workshop_dance,1 point,Tue Apr 14 19:28:09 2015 UTC,Just noticed that the music on Games of Thrones S5/E1 was by Ramin Djawadi...
PersonOfInterest,32kxz8,backstept,3,Tue Apr 14 19:42:41 2015 UTC,He's done music for all of Game of Thrones

Really it was an open and closed case with the long intro with ""Hurt"" playing.  Brilliant entrance, immediately reminding the viewer of the pain they felt at the end of the last episode (which had been two weeks earlier)"
PersonOfInterest,32iclc,patentlyobvious,12,Tue Apr 14 01:55:39 2015 UTC,Dues Ex Machina needs to be higher. Holy fuck that twist.
PersonOfInterest,32iclc,18hockey,9,Tue Apr 14 03:57:20 2015 UTC,Truly well deserving episodes. If-Then-Else is my favourite ever episode. Person of Interest has come such a long way from its roots. (Heh).  They grow up so fast.  Sheds tear.
PersonOfInterest,32iclc,pensee_idee,7,Tue Apr 14 07:40:46 2015 UTC,"To me this points to a smaller but more dedicated fan base, which is often the mark of a good show.   (Not to take anything away from this achievement)  I'm glad is doesn't have all the sappy bullshit story lines like Lost that seemed designed to draw in a bigger more casual audience. POI is much more focused and to the point, with more long story arcs that contain more detail and more interaction."

PersonOfInterest,32k5bk,EdwardGlyver,9,Tue Apr 14 13:14:42 2015 UTC,"The Person of Interest Wiki has Plageman listed as the showrunner, not Nolan.   TVline did an interview with both of them in Jan. 2015 and they were listed as co-showrunners.   It really isn't uncommon for there to be two showrunners, as long as they can get along. LOL"
PersonOfInterest,32k5bk,rflairfan1,4,Tue Apr 14 13:20:58 2015 UTC,"Very interesting. Before this, I hadn't realized that Plageman had played such an integral part to the show. I always assumed that Nolan was overseeing everything on the writer's end."
PersonOfInterest,32k5bk,rflairfan1,2,Tue Apr 14 13:22:41 2015 UTC,Since they are co-showrunners there would not need to be a bunch of publicity if Nolan stopped doing as much. I watch a lot of TV and a lot of the times when there is a new showrunner the quality declines. But if it is someone who has been there for many years it stays the same.
PersonOfInterest,32k5bk,fsutouchdown,1 point,Tue Apr 14 13:25:22 2015 UTC,"I think it's a relevantly long time that Greg did the showrunner's role from what I've seen on interviews/ social networks/ shooting set post from fans, etc."
PersonOfInterest,32k5bk,john_gilpin,4,Wed Apr 15 03:11:20 2015 UTC,"Yes it is likely.   Some one like Nolan cannot be writing all the scripts for one show. He will create the concept, create the premise and then walk away leaving his number 2 man for the job.  Good news - if this is the case means - John is expecting Person to last at least for 2-3 more seasons and so a renewal may be there after all"
PersonOfInterest,32k5bk,DesertedPenguin,2,Tue Apr 14 14:50:43 2015 UTC,"I think you missed a key quip in the interview early on the panel where Nolan said he'll let others talk after fielding the first few questions. I think him deferring to Plageman was just letting Greg take some of the questions. Nolan has an interview up on TVLine right now talking about Carter's return.  Nolan has crafted the arc of the show. But Plageman has been involved heavily since day one. They run the show together. You might think of Nolan as kind of the ""big ideas"" guy, while Plageman is more hands on a daily basis.   I would imagine that will continue, especially since Westworld and Foundation are still being worked on in pre-production. By the time they hit the filming process and get released, POI may very well be wrapping up (another season or two). But even if there is a crossover in terms of the production, I doubt little will change.  I fully expect that when the time comes, Nolan's hands will be all over the series finale along with Plageman."
PersonOfInterest,32k5bk,EThorns,1 point,Tue Apr 14 17:32:04 2015 UTC,"Not to get technical, but season 1 of Westworld is already in post-production. They've been shooting for a while. Even released a few teasers with tiny bits of footage."
PersonOfInterest,32k5bk,EThorns,2,Tue Apr 14 17:36:43 2015 UTC,"You're wrong. Full-fledged production of Westworld's first season hasn't even begun yet. The teaser images with footage that you've seen, are from the pilot that was shot in August-September 2014.  The show's advertised to be out in 2015. Given what regular cast member Thandie Newton mentioned earlier that they begin production in the spring, I'm guessing an October release date.  Foundation on the other hand, probably won't even begin production for atleast another 2 years. The material is so vast, that they need to map things out story-wise & figure out the logistics of the execution. My guess is, it'd kickoff once POI concludes."
PersonOfInterest,32k5bk,DesertedPenguin,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:35:26 2015 UTC,"My mistake. IMDB has it listed as being in post-production. I assumed they'd begun shooting shortly after the series pick up was announced, which was in the fall."
PersonOfInterest,32k5bk,whitewater2,1 point,Tue Apr 14 18:39:24 2015 UTC,"Believe IMDB hasn't been updated. In an interview in January, Jonah mentioned that he & his wife Lisa (who's co-showrunner) are in the process of setting up the writer's room. Rumor has it that comic scribe Ed Brubaker's part of it."
PersonOfInterest,32k5bk,ab_emery,2,Tue Apr 14 18:44:10 2015 UTC,Brubaker is a legend. That would be phenomenal.
PersonOfInterest,32jn8n,IfTheyCame2HearMeBeg,4,Tue Apr 14 09:28:22 2015 UTC,They switched from using blank firing guns to using nonguns and props with muzzle fire added in post.

PersonOfInterest,32jn8n,psyko-byte,5,Wed Apr 15 09:38:38 2015 UTC,The warehouse shootout looked absolutely ridiculous thanks to the muzzle flashes.
PersonOfInterest,32jn8n,News_Bot,3,Tue Apr 14 10:42:33 2015 UTC,maybe they don't have as much money to buy ammunition and guns. they said he does not have access to his billions
PersonOfInterest,32jn8n,1701ncc,3,Tue Apr 14 19:41:30 2015 UTC,Even the stock exchange fight lacked the zest and the zing.

Also, why is it at the beginning of the show Reese actually acted like he had years of training, but now later hes literally terrible.

PersonOfInterest,32jn8n,StarGreen,2,Tue Apr 14 17:17:18 2015 UTC,"This is my personal issue with the show. Season 1 Reese was fucking awesome, but, now, he's getting downed with one single hit by skinny girls. Fuck this.  In reality, though, the writers are struggling to make believable and threatening villains for the filler episodes, which means Reese is getting out of the safehouse without his plot awesomeness more often."
PersonOfInterest,32jn8n,Deadmond_,4,Tue Apr 14 19:54:29 2015 UTC,"This. In the earlier seasons they showed Reese as a one man army, but now he gets injured in almost every episode. I season 4 episode 2 ""Nautilus"", Reese mentioned this too, he said to Harold something like ""you forget that I was an international spy Finch""."
PersonOfInterest,32jn8n,agentofawesome,0,Tue Apr 14 17:23:38 2015 UTC,"Cue whiners.  You people realize this show's aging, right? Four years? Costs increase, and if the network thinks it's becoming too expensive, they may cut the line.  So please, be reasonable. If you're expecting explosions, long gunfights and martial arts sequences every episode, it's going to be expensive for the show. They probably want to save whatever they can for the 'big' episodes, so to speak."

PersonOfInterest,32iade,pensee_idee,6,Tue Apr 14 03:39:22 2015 UTC,"Same, I didn't expect this to be a major plot point.  I guess it makes sense given Samaritan's message near the end of Prophets."
PersonOfInterest,32iade,ab_emery,4,Tue Apr 14 03:48:45 2015 UTC,"Maybe as they search for the Machine's location, they'll discover that She is, in fact, distributed everywhere instead of being confined in a single facility in one piece."

PersonOfInterest,32iaim,CarrotCollector,4,Tue Apr 14 00:41:45 2015 UTC,"It's interesting that Root seems to be adopting some of Shaw's mannerisms. The way she eats in this clip reminds me of Shaw. The way she gassed all those people in the building reminded me of Shaw in ""Relevance"". The way she flipped Martine over was similar to how Shaw flipped over the real Agent Dearborn in ""Mors Praematura"".   Meanwhile, Shaw is probably losing her mind as she is being tortured or possibly even brainwashed by Samaritan operatives.   Sigh I just made myself really sad.   On a different note, I thought Root was past calling Reese ""the big lug"". I don't think she's referred to him as such since 4x02, and I felt that she respected him a lot more. Oh well, I guess."

This occurs for child processes, where the entry is still needed to allow the parent process to read its child's exit status: once the exit status is read via the wait system call, the zombie's entry is removed from the process table and it is said to be ""reaped"". A child process always first becomes a zombie before being removed from the resource table. In most cases, under normal system operation zombies are immediately waited on by their parent and then reaped by the system – processes that stay zombies for a long time are generally an error and cause a resource leak.

PersonOfInterest,32hdj1,ariyahvansh,3,Mon Apr 13 20:32:13 2015 UTC,"The events on the show support your thoughts. The Machine knew that there was a possibility that Samaritan would come online, even though the team had several chances to stop this from happening. So She monitored some potential allies (Daniel Casey, Jason Greenfield) and had Root recruit them as part of a her group of hackers to create those seven blind spots. The Machine was also prepared for the stock market flash crash; Root was already armed with a code to stop the disaster. So She is quite wily. As desperate and hopeless as the situation may seem, I think She has definitely formulated some plans of action to combat Samaritan.   And yes, Her plan does seem to involve previously saved numbers. Caleb Phipps is proof of that. I'd also love to see Root's hacker trio, Henry Peck (""No Good Deed"") and Monica Jacobs (""Trojan Horse"") return. They could be extremely helpful in this war."

PersonOfInterest,32hdj1,UltraChip,2,Tue Apr 14 17:22:50 2015 UTC,"I'm still betting that the Machine has spread itself across multiple locations - maybe not a true fully distributed system, but at least across multiple redundant data centers.   At the end of last season it was shown that this is how Samaritan is set up, so we know that the writers know about the concept and understand why it'd be advantageous."

Resse seems to operate better on one vs one close quarters. Daredevil dont use firearms, and it limited on the use of any kind of weapon. Jonh its an expert on firears and its proficient with knifes and a master at improvising .  So in a one to one in a confined space Reese hands down. With some space for acrobatics , maybe Daredevil. With guns resse and its no contest. With other kind of weapons i also think Reese."
PersonOfInterest,32iwsm,Espectador,2,Tue Apr 14 04:10:44 2015 UTC,I think Reese actually comes of as more superhuman than a guy with actual superpowers.
PersonOfInterest,32iwsm,Espectador,3,Tue Apr 14 04:16:00 2015 UTC,"Maybe so , remember that POI has some similarities with super hero stories and with Batman in particular so it comes with the territory . Finch has an intelligence almost superhuman , Root and her connection with the machine that enhances her abilities , etc.  Also Reese its a heavily trained operative, selected from the best of the best a truly elite warrior. His experience on field goes above and beyond the most seasoned veterans. So he does not only has the training , also has the composure and psychological fortitude that comes with the territory .  Matt Murdock in the state of the first Season of Daredevil seems to be still learning the ropes in certain aspects, its not as seasoned and his training while special its not as technichal and comprehensive as  Reese´s.  Also form what i had seen from Nexflix series , not the comic im not  a comic reader, Matts powers are pretty subtle in comparison with other super heroes.  Matt with the training and experience of Jonh will surely beat him."
PersonOfInterest,32iwsm,GetKegged,2,Tue Apr 14 07:15:40 2015 UTC,"That's the thing, it's like apples to oranges. They're both very different operators, who both operate in very different styles, yet are extremely brilliant in their respective ways to get the job done.   Aye, Daredevil may have the heightened senses, but as he is portrayed in the series, I'd just say he doesn't actually have the physical strength that Reese does, However he is much more agile in his fight style, that's why he takes 4-5 hits to knock an enemy down.  As for how he gets information, well he was trained to fight, but not to be a spy, simple as that. It's an interesting thought though, to compare the two."

PersonOfInterest,32ezlu,john_gilpin,4,Mon Apr 13 15:58:51 2015 UTC,that dialouge sounds good but the idea that machine is samaritan is bordering on crazy. no offense.  machine is in samaritan is also not making sense. how can the machine hide in samaritan without it finding out. after all it is another AI and equal to the machine.  I am really bent on the space theory and satellites. it could run from satellites but then it cannot be destroyed without star wars programmes.
PersonOfInterest,32ezlu,KarlKastor,2,Mon Apr 13 16:03:42 2015 UTC,If the theory was right it could be still pretending to be Samaritan for Decima and run the scan to make it seem like Samaritan was making an effort to stop the Machine.
PersonOfInterest,32ezlu,UltraChip,1 point,Mon Apr 13 17:02:26 2015 UTC,it could run from satellites   Two problems with that theory:   The latency between satellites and ground stations is really high. For most (human) uses it's not too bad but for a system like the Machine that needs to see billions of data feeds and process them in real time it could be a major problem.  The last time we saw the Machine in physical form it was an insanely massive data center. Even if it upgraded to modern hardware it would still be the size of a warehouse. How would a satellite of that size be launched/constructed without anyone taking notice? It'd be like if someone built another International Space Station and tried to keep it secret. Keep in mind that spacecraft of that size can be seen by the naked eye from the ground.

PersonOfInterest,32ezlu,TexasAndroid,4,Mon Apr 13 11:44:39 2015 UTC,"This.  At least the first part.  This is what came right to my mind when I heard the ""not anywhere on Earth"" quote.  Ok.  Fine.  Distributed across the satellite network would nicely put it off of Earth.  My only problem is why would Samaritan's scan be that specifically limited?  How would it search every single system across the face of the planet, but actively not search among the satellites.  They're connected to everything else on the planet, and no reason they would not be running the same anti-virus.    So I really like the satellite theory, but at the moment it has a major weakness IMHO."

I am not surprised if a few of the machines are just sitting in one of those warehouses sipping power away from Samaritan without it knowing it. Especially I doubt Samaritan uses the antivirus software itself when it is capable of doing any kind of virtual defense on its own.

PersonOfInterest,32ezlu,eikeegimuu,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:46:55 2015 UTC,I'm not sure it's really all that plausible - it's been shown the Machine needs way more processing power than 7 servers can provide (even if they are super double awesome future servers)
PersonOfInterest,32ezlu,Trueogre,1 point,Wed Apr 15 13:45:48 2015 UTC,I agree.  We simply need more info. I just hope the explanation is something believable.  This show walks a very thin line between believable and typical show deus-ex-machina.  So far it's doing an excellent job.
PersonOfInterest,32ezlu,eikeegimuu,3,Wed Apr 15 14:29:14 2015 UTC,"water flows more than one way, unless it is constrained intentionally or unintentionally.   saying you've scanned everything on a network is a bit like saying you went and knocked on every door in the winchester house but no one answered.  it can be argued that samaritan holds all the keys, but we've seen already that it has been compromised enough to allow the team to be under the radar. there is no reason to believe that the same thing hasn't been done to an address that the machine is connected to.  further obfuscation of messaging, already nigh ambiguous at best, simply blends into traffic without the need for exposed code. you don't leak brain matter when you talk do you?"
PersonOfInterest,32ezlu,themerovengian,2,Mon Apr 13 15:51:13 2015 UTC,"Wherever the Machine is, I think by the time we find out its location it will be long gone, like in season 2. Unless Samaritan is gone, I see no reason why anyone should find out. Or maybe it wants to be found, and it has a complex plan to take down Samaritan for good."
PersonOfInterest,32ezlu,themerovengian,2,Mon Apr 13 20:19:43 2015 UTC,"Samaritan’s scan might have been unsuccessful basically because the Machine is just that good at hiding so then Samaritan’s scan failing wouldn't indicate anything about the Machine’s location. Like Samaritan couldn't isolate those 7 secret identity servers even with a thorough scan. But I doubt very much that the Machine itself is actually hiding on those 7 servers. That would be extremely disappointing. It sounds good in sneaky plan kinda way but in reality it would be a plan without a contingency.  I think it's likelier that maybe in addition to those 7 identities the Machine had something put into those servers that helps to disguise also the Machine’s footprint. It could also allow the Machine some limited connection to Samaritan. I base that guess on Root’s rotating identities – I’m thinking if those identities and their sequence had been preset Root would have memorized them and the “reset times” but from the episodes it seems that she has to get that info from the Machine through whispers of static etc, not very convenient."
PersonOfInterest,32ezlu,J_B_Tito,2,Mon Apr 13 16:00:55 2015 UTC,"The thing is, and this is where Samaritan fails.  Samaritan believes it can seek out the Machine using its coding, however its 'owners' have not specified to Samaritan that the Machine is a closed system therefore it does not require outside assistance to perform its duties (programming terms) it can do them all by itself.  There's only one time the Machine needed assistance and that was when it needed to remember the previous day and hired a load of people to type in a load of ascii code into computers but then again this is just ascii code and nothing unpeculiar.  This was all before Samaritan came online and it got upgraded to free status by Harold.  Since the Machine's has altered its own coding so it can function without chains.  Samaritan is thinking like itself, needing people to constantly upgrade it and alter code for its own design.  So when Samaritan dedicates an entire software company to look for the Machine it fails.  It fails because the Machine doesn't put its code out like Samaritan does (IE using other people to code partial segments of coding and then dispose of them).  The Machine just number crunches what it sees and spits out numbers, that's it although we don't know what other extents its has as we're only seeing partial things.  We do know that Ernest Thornhill is back so we can assume that the Machine contacts people like everyone else, nothing peculiar about someone texting you."
PersonOfInterest,32ezlu,turbov21,1 point,Mon Apr 13 17:05:35 2015 UTC,"As to where the Machine actually (physically) is I’d have lots of fun explanations if the show was instead of 15 minutes in the future a bit further along, but as it isn’t I'm going with a more mundane guess that maybe the Machine is still earthbound and has a server farm (like Samaritan is shown having) but its location will be unexpected (meaning not a no name bunker) and disguised as something else.  Let’s say a hydropower plant - because it was at a ""nuclear site” before and any showdowns in the vicinity of a hydropower plant have the potential to look great. Wouldn't look as cool but one practical solution would be if it was disguised as a (working) solar plant, which would have the advantage that the Machine could spread out under the guise of more solar power plants being built (green energy and all that) and of course this way it could be more autonomous in energy usage.   Or it could be sitting underneath the white house in a nuclear bunker (or some other location protected based on different assumptions) :P"

It was an excellent episode though, one of the standouts of the season. It also felt very different, unlike anything that has come before it. You'll see what I mean tomorrow night.   As for the panel, it was a lively and more often than not, humorous discussion. Someone asked about a Season 5 renewal and Nolan responded saying they didn't know yet but that they felt good about it. Judging by his response, he wasn't playing coy. It seems like it is still genuinely up in the air. Which still worries me slightly, but he definitely sounded as positive as he could without having official confirmation.   There were actually a couple of big spoilers that they let slip during the discussion regarding the season finale. I was actually surprised they were so explicit in what they let drop.   Overall, great evening with some good insight here and there."
PersonOfInterest,32bwuv,EdwardGlyver,2,Tue Apr 14 01:17:11 2015 UTC,I watched it online. Jim seemed very tired and very tan. Michael is very funny it seems. I noticed some of the spoilers that they dropped it seemed accidental but they didn't seem to back peddle at all.   Glad you had a great time.
PersonOfInterest,32bwuv,rflairfan1,2,Tue Apr 14 01:19:50 2015 UTC,"Jim and Kevin were both super tanned. According to Jim, they had just come back from a trip to the Bahamas (I think).   It seemed like the rest of the audience missed the couple of big spoilers they dropped. At least, no one reacted when it happened. My buddy and I both turned to each other with raised eyebrows."
PersonOfInterest,32bwuv,EdwardGlyver,1 point,Tue Apr 14 01:30:53 2015 UTC,I noticed the tan on Kevin but it looked a little more natural. But Jim looked like Ross from the Friends episode.

PersonOfInterest,32bwuv,WomanWhoWeaves,5,Sun Apr 12 15:29:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know. I assume based on the video from Paley 2013 that it'll be ca 30 minutes. But there are other panels on youtube that are longer (45 min or more than 1 hour, but that's maybe if there are more people on the panel).  People who have tickets might know the approximate duration. But their experience will include screening of a new episode, so that's already 45 minutes that we don't get to see (the streaming starts 45 minutes later than the event itself)."

Side note: I was impressed by the way she handled herself after the video of her son's encounter with the police was made public.  I feel like a lot of celebrities wouldn't know what to do in that situation, or would only know how to apologize in a way that made it seemed like they'd been intentionally lying about what they knew.  Henson was a class act."

PersonOfInterest,32atsl,IceSentry,-10,Tue Apr 14 05:08:16 2015 UTC,Who cares this is barely related to poi. The only relation it has is an actress that isn't even part of the cast anymore and hasn't been for a while.

PersonOfInterest,32atsl,IceSentry,-5,Sun Apr 12 19:39:46 2015 UTC,It still is unrelated to person of interest and even if she is in the next episode she hasn't been in the main cast for a while now
PersonOfInterest,32atsl,ariyahvansh,3,Sun Apr 12 22:12:11 2015 UTC,"If you don't like this thread, simply downvote it and move on. The OP posted this here because a lot of POI fans still follow Taraji's work and are therefore interested in seeing her host SNL."
PersonOfInterest,32atsl,IceSentry,-1,Sun Apr 12 23:12:26 2015 UTC,That's what I did I just wanted to let op know why I downvoted. Then someone commented on my comment so I replied. If fans want to follow her that's completely fine. But this sub is about poi and she's not even in the cast anymore.
PersonOfInterest,32ato4,IAmNeoK,16,Sun Apr 12 03:39:54 2015 UTC,"The two rooms in the hotel in 4x19 were connected with a door, if I remember right. So it might not have been a continuity error, but she could have just walked to the other room. I would need to rewatch to be sure though."
PersonOfInterest,32ato4,QuantumHacker,15,Sun Apr 12 08:30:14 2015 UTC,"If there is one thing that irks me is when people say one thing has become bad, because it simply isn't as good as what came before. A TV show doesn't drop in quality just because a series of episodes isn't as good as one that came before. If anything that shows how brilliant If-Then-Else was.  The recent episodes have been the lowest of the series, I agree with you but that does not make them bad or the show bad. It's to be expected in a show with 20+ episodes that the quality isn't always going to of similar heights and can even feel like filler, and losing a valuable member means making changes. Last season had such episodes, but because this season was heavily story and character focused from the start these episodes are easier to critique. I consider these episodes as like a come down, a calm before the storm if you will.  I can't comment on the lighting or on the continuity error, because I never really notice things like that, at least not enough for it to ruin a show and it can be viewed as over analyzing and nitpicking. On Reese, the man's drop in form can be attributed to fatigue. Yeah it's hard to forget people can get drained especially TV show. The man has been beaten physically, mentally and emotionally and has a lot on his shoulders so of course you can't expect him to bde at the same level. That's great writing in my book because it shows that Reese is a man, yes skilled and deadly but flawed. And if Reese does die which could happen and has been alluded to, then this makes it more believable.  As for the Finch scenario, on one hand it's clear that in the end Root could have avoided the entire situation, but you have to remember Root has been driven through strong emotions, and such emotions can cloud peoples judgement and make them act out of character. It can seem a liitle farfetched but it does happen.  I sincerely hope you continue watching, because this amazing show does not deserve to lose another viewer over what imo are silly reasons when you consider the good astronomically outweighs the bad."
PersonOfInterest,32ato4,eikeegimuu,9,Sun Apr 12 12:36:55 2015 UTC,"If-Then-Else was a fantastic episode. But not the last truly good episode by any means.  About Reese fighting – if he is too efficient then that's unrealistic and if he's not efficient enough then that's not cool. Though I guess I'm the wrong person to judge that since the only fight I remember happened behind closed doors anyway.   4X19 – didn't notice that door/bed quandary. Fortunately I'm not good at noticing goofs, so it didn't bother me. Maybe it was a case of editing gone wrong. Not like you can film the fight one day with the lovebirds in the background and next day you position the lamp but forget the 2 actors. So maybe Root moved during the fight back towards her room and that's why it was visible behind her.  I didn't find Harold drinking poison out of character. Why would you think that? Him being fine a couple of hours after demand a little suspension of disbelief, but depending on the specific poison I don't find it impossible either.  Servers in the city and operator in the woods was because they were not part of the same unit. Samaritan had hijacked the servers of the number's company. The bunker in the woods was Samaritan's and used to access those servers."
PersonOfInterest,32ato4,your_mind_aches,14,Sun Apr 12 18:14:13 2015 UTC,"I personally love the show as much as ever, but I upvoted you. You bring up valid points. That said, you didn't like Control-Alt-Delete or MIA? Or Guilty? Or Blunt? I thought those were great episodes."
PersonOfInterest,32ato4,CatandWolf,3,Sun Apr 12 03:53:26 2015 UTC,"I don't usually pay attention to the muzzle flashes but I've noticed those too. As for the Root scene at the hotel room, there was an adjoining door to the room next door to where the couple was. Also, there was only 2 of the agents, I don't think they had backup. You don't see it clearly when those 2 guys burst through the door of her room, because the camera went by it too quick, but there seems to be a door at the left side of the room. The door handle is different from the others though so that's confusing. Those two also came from the adjoining door of the room next to the couple that's why we could see the bed of the room they were in.   There was a lot of doors in that scene. I counted 3 per room; the main door, the door to the adjoining room and a door that I'm going to assume is to the bathroom. What I'm puzzling over is the door besides the one Root went through to get back to her room. If that's to the bathroom then why is it placed there? The dimensions seems wrong. I'm not familiar with hotel rooms in particular so I just chalked it up to that. Okay, this whole scene seems like a mess. I feel like they filmed this on maybe 2 different locations and it shows. I still love the show though and I'm sure they'll recover from this. Like /u/DAL82 said."
PersonOfInterest,32ato4,ab_emery,14,Sun Apr 12 07:18:25 2015 UTC,"Finch drinking the poison in 4x18 was out-of-character and stupid   I could say you're wrong about that, but I already argued it in the Skip discussion thread.  Most of this is either vague or making mountains out of molehills.  The acting complaint really seems like grasping at straws.  As for Reese facing serious opponents after Booked Solid: a Decima agent in Zero Day, a SWAT team in The Devil's Share, an ISA operative in 4C, Grice in Control-Alt-Delete (might be others I don't remember offhand).  A key premise this season is that he can't just be the Man in the Suit.  Things changed for him, and for the others, which brings up the most important point.   I used to love POI   If you don't like it, don't watch."
PersonOfInterest,32ato4,LaunchpadMacQ,2,Sun Apr 12 04:48:18 2015 UTC,"For your first point, I have to agree, but it's far from a glaring issue. I only see it now that you've pointed it out; I heard the muzzle CGI mentioned about last week's episode, but honestly, I've seen the episode twice and it wasn't noticeable to me either time. Maybe that's just me, though. As for serious fights, yeah, I've been missing that, especially in light of some recent films and TV series' I've seen - The Raid, John Wick, Daredevil. PoI had some pretty memorable action set-pieces in the past, but there haven't been many this season.  As for the ""continuity error"", she went through the door conjoining the rooms, but she went back as the fight continued (the thugs came in through the couples' room door, if I recall correctly).   I don't think that was out of character. Remember the congressman in season 3 - Finch was the most adamant about not killing him, despite the hell that would ensue if Samaritan came online. As a result, even though Reese and Shaw decided against it, he went off the grid to do some reflecting about the ultimate goal of their crusade for justice. It's a very similar scenario, where Finch does not believe that killing Elizabeth, despite the dangers of keeping her alive and going through with his plan. Though, admittedly, since the whole thing was resolved with Root's manipulation, we probably could have skipped to that in the first place.   I'm not sure what your question about the operator is... He was there to monitor the antivirus process, as far as I can tell.  Honestly, some of the episodes have dragged bit since If-Then-Else, but goddamnit, that was an amazing episode. Anything that comes after it will look pretty pale. Even so, I think the last two episodes have been exceptional, and so was Ctrl-Alt-Del and a couple of the standalone episodes since the midseason break."

PersonOfInterest,32ato4,DAL82,4,Mon Apr 13 17:38:04 2015 UTC,"I've noticed the drop in quality too.  I attribute it to quick rewrites to Sarah Shahi's sudden departure.  CGI (I'd imagine) is ordered months in advance.  Stories and scripts are written well before filming.    If Ms. Shahi's departure wasn't expected by the producers they'd have to quickly rewrite vast sections of story.  CGI effects may require a hasty redo.      Shaw's departure marked a sudden decline in POIs quality.  It's still brilliant and I still love it, but it's a noticeable drop in brilliance.    Hopefully they'll recover their shine.    Give 'em a bit of time, I'll wager they'll recover."
PersonOfInterest,32ato4,Try_Another_Please,3,Sun Apr 12 05:03:32 2015 UTC,I wouldn't down vote you but complaining about down votes makes me want to. It's just an annoying habit redditors seem to have gotten to that should stop IMO. Most of what you listed are minor nit picks at best and Control-Alt-Delete already proves your opening statement wrong IMO. Again my opinion isn't worth more than yours but that's just how I feel

Hopefully the Machine will play a bigger more active role and perhaps Finch will take a break from his holier than thou attitude.

First, there are three episodes left in the season. Why are they going to not have this one relate to the Samaritan storyline?  Second, yes, they are going to show us scenes we didn't previously see between Reese and Carter. It sounds like there may be more than the subtext of there possibly being something between them. And these are set directly after the first two episodes if season two, right after Reese has rescued Finch from Root? When he was so focused on finding Finch that nothing else mattered to him? And one Finch is back, Reese was handling numbers but still concerned with the effects of the kidnapping on Finch and taking him out for beers. Hmmm. I am trying to stay positive here, but this seems like it may be awkward."

I suspect the idea was that Samaritan trained Gabriel to draw pictures based on tones it sent him.  I bet that was, somehow, Samaritan's family. A sarcastic little joke from Samaritan, ya know? It's in the classroom, so it's putting up its drawing of its family.  One of them may have been Arthur Claypool. Maybe the others are Martine and Lambert? Or the writing staff? Who knows."

Nice tie-in, but I think its quite possible that Samaritan leveraged the flash crashes to do all manner of sneaky business. The point on everyone's favorite weapons is an interesting observation, though.   12 is an extremely interesting point because many of us have pointed out that the Root/Martine fight and its outcome was seemingly sloppy, full of TV tropes, and just for the sake of having a fight involving a recurring Villain With A Face. But if Root really was emulating Shaw's style with Shaw's gear, it puts a new spin on that sequence. We don't really know Root's CQC capabilities, but she seems to be more of a lightweight compared to Martine and it didn't seem like the even match that played out. Yeah, I'm certain that without backup, that rage would have gotten her killed. It's still cringe-worthy that Reese, having rounds, didn't finish the job. The exchange Root and Reese have later seems to indicate, as I've said elsewhere, that he's torn between Finch's morality and Root's revenge."
PersonOfInterest,323fku,shinsaikou,4,Fri Apr 10 21:10:15 2015 UTC,"It's still cringe-worthy that Reese, having rounds, didn't finish the job.   I agree that Reese could be morally torn, but I think he's still closer to Finch in that regard than he is to Root, so it's reasonable that he didn't kill Martine.  He was on the verge of killing Congressman McCourt, but didn't do it.  I also think his concession to Root implies he would've been more likely to let her kill Martine than to finish the job himself."
PersonOfInterest,323fku,shinsaikou,1 point,Fri Apr 10 21:39:17 2015 UTC,"He also had the opportunity to kill the head of HR, but it was Finch who talked him down as I recall. Finch is always the angel on his shoulder."

Reese pulled the trigger with the intention of murdering Quinn, but his gun didn't fire because it was soaked with his blood. Then he collapsed to the ground in exhaustion as Finch gently reminded him that Carter had died trying to bring HR down through legal means, and that killing Quinn would have been against her wishes.   Edited to add: But yes, I would agree that Finch's morals have had a huge influence on Reese, and that he now would not kill an unarmed person lying on the ground. I still wish that Root had snatched his gun and shot Martine though."
PersonOfInterest,323fku,KarlKastor,1 point,Sun Apr 12 17:12:53 2015 UTC,"I have a hard time believing Mr. McAfee was the primary objective of the flash crashes.   Well the objective was too be able to use his company to search for the Machine and get away with it. So I think that is important enough to be the main reason for the flash crash but of course there could be more than one reason.   It's still cringe-worthy that Reese, having rounds, didn't finish the job.   I also thought: ""He's got a gun at hand why doesn't he use it."" It makes almost no sense story-wise but from a production standpoint of course they wouldn't use up one of the main villains so easily."

PersonOfInterest,324aaw,goldbullshit,4,Fri Apr 10 13:40:51 2015 UTC,Hmmm...this question has been on my mind for weeks now.  I think it was perhaps because Samaritan alerted her to the commotion at the Safe house to check out if it was something to be looked at - especially since the manner of attack was highly professional and not something run of the mill.   Thats why Martine is skeptical when the Policeman says Run of the Mill Drug War for which Martine says 'I dont think so'

I get it, both of those shows are good, but just because PoI has procedural episodes with number of the week type deals doesn't make it bad.  Just because the entire first season was number of the week episodes doesn't mean it sucked.

Go figure from an SF writer that's the review. Except it's just as pathetic as pinup fanboys claiming 'PoI sucks because they don't show off Shaw's tits enough'. Or B-action movie watchers saying 'this detective stuff sucks, it needs more shooting and explosions'. If the show focused on one aspect episode after episode it would get dull to a wide audience and they wouldn't have gotten a second season. It's all really silly to blow off of a show simply because it doesn't pander to your section of the audience more than others."
PersonOfInterest,3222b9,ab_emery,2,Fri Apr 10 08:01:07 2015 UTC,"Hit the nail on the head.  The show is what Jonah wanted it to be, based on shows he watched that had an episodic element along with an overarching story.  Personally, I think the various elements make the show's world more textured and believable.  And the different scales play off each other, as I think Guilty did well."
PersonOfInterest,3222b9,patentlyobvious,1 point,Fri Apr 10 17:07:15 2015 UTC,Also if the machine had all the focus of the show it would last 1 season maybe 2 maximum. The writers can only write so much.

PersonOfInterest,31yv2h,SavannahNix,2,Thu Apr 9 23:31:47 2015 UTC,What makes you think there are two seasons left?
PersonOfInterest,31yv2h,KarlKastor,1 point,Thu Apr 9 12:42:24 2015 UTC,Heard that the first two seasons are a big hurdle for new viewers so we could create a list of skippable episodes and/or someone should cut together a video which recaps the season. (Especially small but important moments in the skippable eps.)
PersonOfInterest,31yv2h,john_gilpin,-7,Thu Apr 9 13:27:55 2015 UTC,"Kill off Finch, Make Root the leader and Get Team Machine to be really aggressive. Let Team Machine win almost everytime and finish at least 7 out of 10 episodes with a massive defeat for Samaritan by the Machine.   Get more zesty fights and let Samaritan have some major defeats like Greer getting killed. Let Elias defeat Dominic.   For once let the good guys win thoroughly and completely and you will see a boost in the ratings. I was introduced to the show by my friends and now all of them prefer Agents of SHIELD and tell me why i still watch POI,  Let the Zing return. So what is that is not realistic. This is TV for Christs sake."
PersonOfInterest,31yv2h,patentlyobvious,10,Sat Apr 11 20:41:13 2015 UTC,"Let Team Machine win almost everytime   The show would be over within a few episodes. The fact they don't win all the time makes it more believeable and interesting.   I'd rather they didn't dumb it down for the lowest common denominator, and turn it into Die Hard."
PersonOfInterest,31yv2h,Anti_pasto,4,Thu Apr 9 10:06:25 2015 UTC,Which in turn makes winning in the end glorious and sweet.

Every week the team wins - have been winning for 7 Seasons, Show is watchable and still has 9-10 Million Viewers.   Machine was winning in S1-3 - in nearly 80% of the episodes.....only here did the entire relationship change"
PersonOfInterest,31yv2h,eikeegimuu,3,Thu Apr 9 12:54:20 2015 UTC,I disagree about Castle still being watchable. I'd hazard that it's several seasons past its best before. I'm really happy POI isn't taking the road of same old same old (and a little bit more boring and predictable each time).

PersonOfInterest,31yv2h,john_gilpin,0,Thu Apr 9 18:34:26 2015 UTC,No i love the show. Its characters. Its just that i hate that Finch and these guys are so helpless every time and in every episode. I really started seeing this show only this year and i saw 1-3 seasons in a sort of marathon.
PersonOfInterest,31yv2h,Anti_pasto,6,Thu Apr 9 10:33:57 2015 UTC,"In case you don't realize I just started the show this year as well. Love the show? Is that why you want Finch dead and change the show's whole story line? Helpless every time and every episode? Losing every damn day? Team Machine scored wins this season too. Saving multiple PoIs from Samaritan and Dominic, saving Elias, preventing Samaritan from acquiring a dangerous virus from being turned into a bio weapon, planting seeds of doubt on multiple characters, preventing a global economic catastrophe and potentially recruiting multiple allies are all big losses for you????"
PersonOfInterest,31yv2h,john_gilpin,-1,Thu Apr 9 15:32:29 2015 UTC,I dont want Finch dead. I am saying he is REDUNDANT. He has no further role to play now. I say he is getting too scared of losing his friends after Shaw. It is only after Shaws death that Finch has become this old dodderer. He was so good in C-A-D and took up such a powerful leadership but after that ......he has gone to pieces.    Saving Elias - OK How did they prevent Samaritan from acquiring a dangerous virus from being turned into a bio-weapon? From what i understood - the guy who wanted to use the MArburg virus was a terrorist and Samaritan only saw the opportunity but it was not its own objective or else it would have sent Martine and co - not the ISA. No Allies yet recruited.   As i said no clear victories.........
PersonOfInterest,31yv2h,Anti_pasto,2,Thu Apr 9 17:49:26 2015 UTC,"Finch too scared? Is that why he was so adamant in enacting his plan against Samaritan?   See? You even forgot about this. Rewatch. Samaritan changed the order to retrieve the virus instead when it saw it. Samaritan basically controls the whole ISA. Caleb and Harper are unknowingly working for The Machine. Rewatch. And I said POTENTIAL.   No damn clear victory? Do you have reading comprehension problems or something? Do I have to repeat myself again? What the hell do you think Team Machine was doing at the stock exchange? To die happily?  Just like SavannahNix said. You have problems understanding the show, sir. You even forgot the original purpose of the cover identities. If you still don't get it, this is not the show for you. I suggest you to stop watching.   Listen to your friends. I don't get why are you still watching if you dislike the shows current direction so damn much. The problem here is not the show but it is you. Your ignorance to understand the show and your own personal vision of what a perfect show should become is what causing this. Again I say, STOP WATCHING because the show obviously does not fit your tastes any more. Stick to Castle or whatever show that fits you.  Oh and please don't bother replying to this. I'm done with you, sir."
PersonOfInterest,31yv2h,eikeegimuu,2,Fri Apr 10 03:28:07 2015 UTC,"I think (hope) a lot of this season has still been a set up – to establish where the characters are at, what the limitations and stakes are. Though it doesn't feel to me that they are losing all the time – their adversary IS very powerful, so at this point that they've managed to stay alive to fight another day and save some numbers in between is good enough."
PersonOfInterest,31yv2h,SavannahNix,2,Fri Apr 10 07:47:51 2015 UTC,"You know, while a lot of viewers are under the impression that the show wasn't good before Root and Shaw appeared, that it just wrong. You can't kill off the creator of the Machine, the character that is the center if the show.  And there are those who complain that ""winning"" every week was unrealistic.  Just why do your friends think you still watch POI since they have told you?"
PersonOfInterest,31yv2h,john_gilpin,-1,Thu Apr 9 18:41:07 2015 UTC,I love POI but i think S1-3 and S4 are different. S1-3 was not about winning every week - but winning most of the weeks while S4 is about losing every bloody day. I cannot bear to see these guys shuffling every day and hiding like fugitives. Kinda like seeing the Flash or Superman hudding in the shadows for 20-25 episodes. One or two episodes are fine but a full season almost is downright depressing.
PersonOfInterest,31yv2h,SavannahNix,1 point,Thu Apr 9 13:24:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is depressing and I would prefer some success too. But I don't really think you love the show.

PersonOfInterest,31yv2h,john_gilpin,0,Thu Apr 9 15:40:09 2015 UTC,Nothing.....  Isnt the Machine protecting them by the Blind spots. They cannot be traced by Samaritan period so what would happen.  Yes Samaritans team of killers have seen root a million times yet she is always safe.   Shaw was not killed because her cover was blown but because the idiot of an ISA agent let her go and Samaritan discovered the glitch and human int led to shaw through Angler.
PersonOfInterest,31yv2h,SavannahNix,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:21:55 2015 UTC,"If Samaritan was able to recognize Shaw instead of a non-threat, the same can happen to all of them.  Did you miss the explanation at the end of season 3 about their identities?"
PersonOfInterest,31yv2h,john_gilpin,0,Thu Apr 9 16:31:39 2015 UTC,"And btw Rileys cover is blown numerous times - Dominic, Iris, Harper all of them can see he is not a cop so is that really a cover???"
PersonOfInterest,31yv2h,Anti_pasto,3,Thu Apr 9 16:38:49 2015 UTC,"Technically it is still a cover. Especially in the eyes of their main enemy, Samaritan. Not even its human agents are aware of John's cover as Riley. Dominic, Iris and Harper are not Sam's agents nor are they aware of the ongoing AI war. So unlike Shaw, John is still safe."
PersonOfInterest,31yv2h,ice2kewl,0,Thu Apr 9 16:49:28 2015 UTC,"John has been spotted a few times now by Samaritan agents, beginning from the cover John provided to Root in the church (when the meet was being set up for the two machines to speak). Then the shootout that took place under the stock market building, and now in the firefight in the snow field (e19). Cant see Riley being safe for much longer..."
PersonOfInterest,31yv2h,Anti_pasto,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:54:25 2015 UTC,"They still don't know John is Riley. But I expect the same thing happening to the whole team by the end of the season. Okay, that just got me extremely excited for the last 3 episodes, lol."

PersonOfInterest,31yhdj,IfTheyCame2HearMeBeg,17,Thu Apr 9 03:29:31 2015 UTC,"Fury and Anger over Shaws death could be a reason but i am really surprised why martine did not Kick root's ass. The fight was genuinely third rate and POI needs to watch Agents of SHIELD for real hand to hand combat or their own Hersh vs Reese, Reese vs Trained Assasins for inspiration.  Reese is not really a killer like Kara who kills when someone is down. He did not kill Hersh when he had a chance.  But you are right - Martine has a cast iron neck or the last scene takes place 7-8 days after the scene at the Snow Base."
PersonOfInterest,31yhdj,john_gilpin,4,Thu Apr 9 04:13:44 2015 UTC,"Agree with you that she probably would want to make it personal rather than the easy stun as well as the Reese bit. The fight was pretty underwhelming, because both of the fighters were pretty slow and obviously fake. I guess that's because I think Amy hadn't had any actual hand-to-hand fight scenes in most of her roles. In Angel she had a crossbow while in POI she has a pair of guns."
PersonOfInterest,31yhdj,LaunchpadMacQ,6,Thu Apr 9 04:52:50 2015 UTC,"It was an obvious gap in the storytelling logic so they could bring Martine back for a bigger showdown later. There's a number of different ways that could have been handled that were more in-character.  Really, I've been thinking about it and I'm not sure there was a reasonable expectation that Root could take Martine on. I mean, Martine is supposed to be a highly trained operative, and Root was just a mercenary once upon a time (and it was implied that she didn't even do most of the ""dirty work"" herself, besides the fact we've never really seen her fight). So, I'm not sure that should have even been a fair fight; Root should have gotten pulverized."
PersonOfInterest,31yhdj,BellatorInMachina,5,Thu Apr 9 15:08:45 2015 UTC,"To be fair, we've never seen Martine engage in hand to hand combat either.   All we know of her background is that she used to investigate warcrimes for the Hague"
PersonOfInterest,31yhdj,LaunchpadMacQ,3,Thu Apr 9 19:29:24 2015 UTC,"I suppose that's true.   I keep forgetting Martine is supposed to be an interface as well; maybe because she's shot it out against all of the main characters at one point or another. She did subdue Romeo that one time, and she definitely displayed more coordination in that instance than Root would have even in God Mode, but I guess that doesn't necessarily mean she's trained in any martial arts or hand-to-hand."
PersonOfInterest,31yhdj,burnerthrown,4,Thu Apr 9 20:20:19 2015 UTC,"According to Hollywood, choking someone to death is among the most vindicating ways to enact revenge. Everyone always seems to be able to move oon after they've looked into their offender's eyes as the life seeped out. Root was probably after that. One thing I noticed is that Samaritan teams as a whole were not as deadly this time as before. In If-Then-Else, one team was all it took to pin down Team Machine which was only avoided by backup and the judicious use of heavy explosives. There were two fewer of the Team this time and no explosives but the Samartian agents just crumbled against Reese's lone defense. I feel like they're setting up Decima to be assailable for the final attack by the Team. Explains why Martine can now get her overly tense ass handed to her and they're showing more of the nerve center, making it less mysterious and more mundane. I would love to see Greer get his smug spy ass shot but being the villian he is he'll probably get some kind of dramatically poetic death."
PersonOfInterest,31yhdj,m1tt,5,Thu Apr 9 20:06:21 2015 UTC,"If-Then-Else was the one in the basement of the stock exchange right? That place was a lot easier to get pinned down in. It was tight and i think Samaritan had a bunch more people. They were also in a room with only small guns. This time, they had a much more open area and Reese had a nice big ass gun.   I mean, i know nothing about combat or anything like that but it seems logical to me that they would get more easily pinned down in a place like a basement then in a forest."

Martine had just about the same number of troops as last time but this time TM had no trouble sweeping them aside. He probably could  have done the same for the next round too, ammo allowing."
PersonOfInterest,31yhdj,m1tt,1 point,Fri Apr 10 06:43:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thats probably partly because there trying to make Decima more assailable like you said. But i also still think it makes sense, at least to some degree. Because like i said, they wernt really pinned down or anything, like they were on wall street. John also had a much better gun and a better vantage point. To me, it seemed pretty realistic."
PersonOfInterest,31yhdj,shinsaikou,2,Fri Apr 10 08:08:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Clearly, they wanted a fight with a ""Villain With a Face"" without killing said villain. I think that Reese's action only makes sense in the stretch that you believe that he's torn between the Finch and Root way of thinking. As for the fight itself... Root is a lightweight. She's seeing red because she believes Martine killed Shaw. The fight and its resolution was a cheezy example of TV Tropes. And it's either the writers wanting to keep the villian with a face in the mix or they are foreshadowing Martine being flipped - the latter seeming highly unlikely."

He could feel he might get killed but I don't want him thinking he could leave and make a life without the team, without being there for Finch. He knows the Machine won't let him quit.  I also appreciated him stopping the Samaritan baddie from shooting Finch. And Finch yelling ""Riley!"" To warn John."
PersonOfInterest,31x2v5,SavannahNix,8,Wed Apr 8 23:22:24 2015 UTC,"Why did he yell ""Riley"" anyway? They don't want Samaritan or its operatives to know their cover identities so wouldn't it make more sense to just yell ""John""?"

He has become frightened and it is clear his role is over. Except getting the numbers he is doing nothing else (unless you count letting people go and get killed or ruined like Clair or Khan) or getting himself into trouble. It is Root who is showing leadership skills - rescuing John in S419 out of the sky, rescuing Harold, and getting Team machine some cash and guns.

(And he wasn't ""in the sky"") I guess you have forgotten how Root stopped Finch's plan and that he was willing to die to prevent Beth's unnecessary murder. Yeah, Finch is ""scared of dying"".

PersonOfInterest,31x2v5,SavannahNix,-2,Thu Apr 9 17:26:58 2015 UTC,"Finch is redundant and it is time to face it. My watching the show will not help this be mitigated. Heres why i feel so. My opinion entirely   Root begged him throughout S03 that a larger war was at hand. A larger war and the machine was begging her to be released to fight samaritan but no the Idiot would not release her from her cage - conveniently allowing Decima to do most of the dirty work including steal the generators and steal the drives.   Root herself chides Harold that had Harold not locked her up - Samaritan would not have been created.   So he was willing to die to prevent Beths murder. That makes him nothing more than a moron. He is the Leader of a team who knows that his team mates depend on him yet he is willing to give his life for Beth. That does not make him a leader - just a lovesick or moral fool. And why is he suddenly scared of his friends dying. He is not exactly working in IBM or Shell is he. He knows his job and he knew the risks as early as the Pilot. He knew he was HUNTED by the Authorities and now by Samaritan and its thugs. So What really has changed. He was the same ditherer in Panopticon. And when asked- he says he got scared when the Machine asked him to kill a congressman.  So again i ask you - what has changed for Finchie to become so scared of his friends dying. For christs sake Fusco a former worm is able to tell Reese that he is FINE with going out like Shaw.  Yes i think he let claire go. He did not know Samaritan would rescue her. She was still under threat from Silverpool when she left him and yet he did not follow her. Had Reese and Shaw watched from the rooftops as the Agents were shot down - and then Claire taking the cellphone - then it would be ok but that did not happen.    And Finch could easily have told khan of the Machine but no - our man has to keep a secret from another who knows of the existence of Samaritan (even though he blabbed to Daniel Casey, The NSA guy in S1 and a few others).  Why do you feel i should stop watching the show? Because i dont get Harold. I get him more than i should. He is over now and needs to leave."
PersonOfInterest,31x2v5,john_gilpin,3,Thu Apr 9 17:27:29 2015 UTC,"You should stop watching a show you obviously have so many serious issues with.   If you hate a show's main character who is in every episode, there seems to be little enjoyment to be gained from watching and posting unless you just enjoy complaining and hating on it.  I guess you would rather Finch had locked up Claire, or maybe he could have shot her? The point isn't that Samaritan rescued her. It recruited her. And for all he knew, Khan would have told Greer everything, including where the safe house is located.  At the time Root was warning him, Finch still did not trust her. And he knew it was coming without her warning anyway.  The entire point is the dilemma of compromising your ethics for the greater good. Finch knows there are no right answers and is trapped in a terrible situation. You would probably like it if Root just killed him, I guess.  But I don't know why you keep insisting on posting negative comments about Finch or why you have decided this thread is a good place to do it in. The thread is about Reese and Finch's connection, and you have said nothing about that. Any thoughts on the actual subject here?  If not, I am done with your derailing."
PersonOfInterest,31x2v5,SavannahNix,0,Thu Apr 9 16:47:24 2015 UTC,Sorry...i guess i should not have posted these in the thread.  Finch and Reese are two special guys. For 2 whole seasons they single handedly (almost...) saved several persons from killing or being killed. They began as professionals and ended up as friends.  Yet i feel as you that this connection has weakened and it is because of Reese's full time day job as a cop and due to the threat of Samaritan.   Yet their walks in parks continue (karma) but maybe they both feel the bigger picture and their desperate situation.   Looking for another - Mr Reese...Finch moment.

Seeing Finch with Claire Mahoney, seeing him in the hotel with Root, reduced to begging her not to kill Beth, reduced to trying to kill himself as the only active thing he could do...    He did seem OLD.  He seemed frail.  He seemed afraid and vulnerable.  In ""Control-Alt-Delete"" he was so fearless, so strong.  Now a few episodes later, he seems physically helpless, unable to protect himself from danger that is very very close to him, and worse, he seems socially helpless as well.  He's trying to micromanage everything Reese and Root do to keep them from using too much violence, and the only way he can even manage that is to just implore them not to.  He has no authority over them.  He has no persuasive argument.  All he has is begging.  I don't think Finch is going to die, but I do hope he gets his groove back."

PersonOfInterest,31ze96,myst536,15,Thu Apr 9 17:10:20 2015 UTC,"There is an episode dedicated to the origin of Samaritan and its creator, who was Harold Finch's friend from MIT. So, they are two different AIs."
PersonOfInterest,31ze96,mostlyhrmless,5,Thu Apr 9 11:44:56 2015 UTC,"To piggyback on this, Finch and Claypool were friends in college, and probably shared a lot of code with each other back then.  I'm sure that the infrastructure of Samaritan and the Machine are similar.  I'm also sure that Samaritan acts the way the Machine would act if Finch hadn't taught it to value human life.  There was a flashback this season that showed the 42 earlier versions of the Machine were all amoral, some lying to Finch, some even trying to kill him.  If one of those versions had been put online, especially without receiving any additional moral instruction, I have no doubt that they'd act at least as ruthlessly as Samaritan has.  So I guess my point is that it's a coincidence, but it's not a meaningless coincidence.  Samaritan isn't literally the Machine, but there are reasons why Samaritan looks and acts like the Machine does."
PersonOfInterest,31ze96,pensee_idee,4,Thu Apr 9 17:25:51 2015 UTC,"I think Harold would notice the programming being similar. Plus, we know it was created by Arthur Claypool."
PersonOfInterest,31ze96,SavannahNix,0,Thu Apr 9 13:20:52 2015 UTC,Just a weird theory.   Claypool had a code and program - and the machine simply adapted itself unto that code to form version 2.0.

PersonOfInterest,31ze96,rpawson5771,4,Thu Apr 9 16:19:00 2015 UTC,No.
PersonOfInterest,31ze96,eikeegimuu,3,Thu Apr 9 15:50:36 2015 UTC,"Reasons why i feel this way lately   Samaritan is a very powerful AI. Based on what we have heard of AI's - Samaritan is a more powerful God than the Machine. Samaritan is still searching for the Machine and its full code and based on what Greer said is still struggling?   However the Machine gave Root a message to collect Hackers and develop a blind spot to Samaritan on its servers to save 7 of these guys. It means the Machine had to have known every inch of Samaritans programming, its servers etc - so Probably it was doing what it did in S02 end - simply re-evolving to neutralize the threat of Vigilance (Who were destroyed immediately after Samaritan went online) and Greer (Who would renew his attempts to hack the  Machine yet again...so become Samaritan - hoodwink him and destroy him).   Control Alt Del - Machine gets a patch to control the stock market crisis. Again tough to believe after S04E19. I mean the Machine is targeted and hunted by Samaritan and is so badly hiding that it cannot even talk to root as it used to and yet it is able to break into the Stock Market Crash Virus code and create a patch.    Unless......the Machine was Samaritan and created the Patch for its own Virus.   Why is Shaw Alive? - Obviously Shaw is alive. Yet when Martine first got her mission - she went to the store to kill shaw (Practically Shoot Shaw to Death with Guns) before Shaw escaped. But at the stock exchange - Martine had shaw down and on the ground and did not kill her. Obviously not because Greer told her to keep Shaw alive (He could have done that three episodes ago - telling Martine to kidnap Shaw if he needed her as an asset). So only conclusion - Machine AKA Samaritan informed Martine to keep her alive. In the Cold war - When the Machine was talking to Samaritan - it actually looked like it was debating and contemplating like a devils advocate using the little kid and Root to iron out its own objectives    Check it out Machine  (Voiced by Root) - I was built with something you were not. A moral code. Samaritan (Voiced by Kid) - I ve seen that Code. Do you know why Harold couldnt stop you from Evolving. Because in the end you are not one of them. Samaritan - YOu know you cant win dont you Machine - Yes! Is that why i am here to meet my destoyer.  So Machine knows Samaritan is its destroyer and all efforts to preserve the Machine will fail so ....maybe machine knows V1.0 is to be destroyed and replaced by V2.0.   How did everyone find out about Samaritan??? Claypool became crazy but the drives were hidden 5 years before the episode. How did Vigilance suddenly know about Claypool and about Samaritan. We know Vigilance's source of information was Decima - so how did Decima know about Claypool and Samaritan suddenly. Obviously they did not know of Samaritan in S02 as otherwise they would not have planted the virus or wasted all their time taking over Rylatech and getting Kara to plant it over a few months. So how suddenly did Decima know about Samaritan.    Logical Answer - Machine led Decima to the drives, to help in its metamorphosis.  Makes you think.  Of course these are just Crazy thoughts but in a Sci-Fi..what if"
PersonOfInterest,31ze96,eikeegimuu,3,Thu Apr 9 16:24:21 2015 UTC,"Samaritan being more powerful – not necessarily, Samaritan has more non-digital resources and presumably more powerful hardware but the Machine's code is more efficient, so it's not a k.o situation.  Control Alt Del – from what I remember the explanation was that the code was prepared for such an eventuality beforehand and it was ready to be used should the stock exchange be attacked.  Shaw alive – she can be used for intel, to lay a trap for team Machine, to be studied as a specimen (axis disorder).  Cold war – the theory of the Machine being also Samaritan reminds me of a short story where God turned out to be schizophrenic and was both God and Satan, which was a nice hook, but I feel here there's no groundwork for that. Samaritan has a too strong separate background for that to be the case here. In short - from what I remember Samaritan drives came to the interested parties attention when hunting the Machine - thus coming across the information about Claypool and Samaritan drives."
PersonOfInterest,31ze96,hitmeaxou,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:22:55 2015 UTC,Samaritan is more powerful - the Machine admits that in the cold war when it admits it cannot win and asks Samaritan if it was called to meet its destroyer. How can the machine prepare for such an eventuality without knowing the Virus attack code of Samaritan. Keep in mind - these are AI's and have their own codes and Operating Systems yet unknown to men - so how did the machine prepare a patch so quickly without knowing what the virus would be and what would be the code for the virus?  The Answer - It created the Virus in its alternate ego of Samaritan. But Martine would have killed her in the first encounter. She was taking such shots. So obviously Greer did not want Shaw as a specimen only to be ruthlessly eliminated. Then what changed his or Martines mind. Remember the shots fired into shaw were real and Martine nearly took a head shot. So something stopped her right? Vigilance and Decima are identified as threats - Machine decides to do a second contingency - gets itself replicated minus finch's controls into a new code written by Claypool - and destroys first threat vigilance - then hoodwinks greer into exploring the new world denied to it by Finch - finally decides to eliminate its previous self with the controls....so not a clash between 2 AIs but between one AI which is split into two - a god and a satan with Satan trying to destroy the god version......
PersonOfInterest,31ze96,shinsaikou,2,Fri Apr 10 03:20:23 2015 UTC,"Like I said, better hardware and more external resources but it’s not a slam dunk – Samaritan could only get off the ground once more powerful hardware was created. The Machine’s advantage is its more efficient code – the way its brain works and that has to give some advantages too. The code didn’t attack Samaritan, it was used to align the stock market systems – not Samarian’s internal workings. Since it would have been easier to kill than to capture, Martine was (maybe) in the beginning aiming for that, but once the opponent was disarmed and defenseless there are more options than play it safe and shoot to kill. If the Machine had wanted to take over Vigilance and Decima why would it create a version of itself that would try to destroy the original? The Machine found a way around Harold’s shackles anyway – no need for such suicidal action."
PersonOfInterest,31ze96,shinsaikou,1 point,Fri Apr 10 07:06:26 2015 UTC,"whoa man you r way out of the box here. why did the machine have to become samaritan? it seems way too weird to have the machine become a second ai called samaritan and hunt down our friends.   some of what u say makes a lot of sense but surely they have some better answers than to say machine is samaritan.  like how they knew samaritan. i guess once machine packed itself off to secrecy , govt and control have been after a second machine which was built by the creator claypool. surely there was a leak somewhere and decima also came to know and started hunting for the drives.   as to shaw being alive maybe greer changed his mind or martine changed her mind. occams razor man.  as to blind spot i am not sure why but again use occams razor and you will see it is a television based idea by the writers or else everyone dies and series is over by 3rd season."
PersonOfInterest,31ze96,shinsaikou,1 point,Sat Apr 11 11:44:00 2015 UTC,"Still doesnt make sense right. The time gaps. Greer already stole the samaritan drives before Claypool even reached the Bank.

Even Greer is a cold guy so why do they decide Shaw is useful. For info on Finch, Root and Reese maybe ...."
PersonOfInterest,31ze96,JimmyDuce,2,Sat Apr 11 12:56:16 2015 UTC,"You've been downvoted into oblivion because Samaritan had another creator, I don't remember the name but he was on the show. An interesting kernel in your theory though is that The Machine is hiding in plain sight, as a part of Samaritan, which explains why McAfee Samaritan Edition can't find it. Would Samaritan ever go FSCK itself? Forgive the tech humor... What I mean to say is, Samaritan is far too proud to scrutinize itself. The bazillion dollar question becomes how The Machine got in there - perhaps through what Team Root did to Samaritan's hardware at the end of Season 3. The only thing that doesn't add up is why Finch's plan would have still been relevant if The Machine already had access."
PersonOfInterest,31ze96,shinsaikou,2,Fri Apr 10 02:50:07 2015 UTC,Samaritan was a code created by Claypool yes.   I have one small question. Finch began in 2002 to build the machine and it was only in 2007 that the first number was given. Five years later. With Government support and Government Feeds which were also given to Finch for 5 years.  Look at Samaritan - it was created not more than 4 months after the drives were stolen. No Feeds too. How come? Was Claypool (The Creator of Samaritan) that great an Engineer compared to Harold. No - Claypool himself says Harold was better than them all.   So ask yourself why??? Why does Samaritan come up so quick and fast. How come Samaritan needs no testing like Harold did with the Machine. It took harold 5 years but assuming Decima's ruthlessness and their decision to do away with the moral component - even so should take at least 18-24 months right.   So it is clear that the drives contained Samaritans DNA which was usurped by the Machine which already has built in controls and is ready for use- so Samaritan was up and running this fast. The Machine taught Greers tech guys what to do and how to do - so that everything was created so quickly.
PersonOfInterest,31ze96,JimmyDuce,1 point,Fri Apr 10 03:13:48 2015 UTC,"I would submit a combination of TV logic and Greer's hubris that Samaritan would be ready. I get the sense that they had the infrastructure in place, that they knew what was needed to make Samaritan work, they just needed the core code to be able to compile it. The episode, Beta, was just what it says on the tin. Indeed, The Machine had much longer. I think that a scenario where Greer's people are ultimately betrayed by Samaritan is likely, that the potential exists for its own mistrust of others to be its undoing. It would be a dramatic twist if Samaritan's ability to go online so quickly was a design of The Machine, but it was tracking and trying to actively prevent this from happening. Not necessarily that The Team knew, but we saw The Machine monitoring Samaritan's threat and completion levels both, never portrayed as anything other than a threat. So, to say this is a long con by our goddess is, well, a long shot. The simpler explanation is that the writers wanted to do dystopia this season, so Samaritan coming online simply moved at ""the speed of plot"" to assure that it would be possible to tell the current season's story. I tend to trust the machine as much as Root did pre stock market. What we've seen The Machine track through its interface I take at face value. I don't think you can square the circle of The Machine playing a long conspiracy. Remember this, because I will gold you if I am wrong."
PersonOfInterest,31ze96,shinsaikou,2,Fri Apr 10 20:41:37 2015 UTC,Yeah!!! You bring TV logic into this and its a winner. Sounds too far fetched to have the Machine also being Samaritan right???  I just thought it a bit strange that Samaritan came online so fast within weeks of getting the core code and the processor and that there were absolutely no beta testings (Except Beta) to see how it coordinated or worked.  Most likely the it was a writer moment as you say.

Your demise was precisely calculated, and your murderer was immensely powerful; you never had the slightest chance of surviving in the first place.

PersonOfInterest,31xuzp,TheKingsQuote,9,Thu Apr 9 00:26:53 2015 UTC,"He said he didn't use any existing system or language.  In college, I had the option of taking a compilers course (Computer Science minor). In that class, you would be required to create a rudimentary language and a compiler for it.  New programming languages are made and go defunct all the time, so it's not too far fetched that Finch would have made his own."
PersonOfInterest,31xuzp,rossbot,2,Thu Apr 9 00:33:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the Answer! But the way I see,  Finch would be dealing directly with machine code, right? And in the end all codes ( whatever language you write it ) are translated to machine code. So how its pattern would be different from any other code?"
PersonOfInterest,31xuzp,rossbot,3,Thu Apr 9 02:43:22 2015 UTC,"I doubt that Finch would have written something that complex in machine code.  Machine code is basically not dealt with anymore since the advent of assembly and higher-level languages.  Drivers are even written in assembly language, as are most compilers, rather than straight machine code.  AI applications that advanced would require higher levels of abstraction not easy to program into assembly, let alone machine code.  Finch probably wrote an assembler and his own assembly language (unless he was using standard processor architectures, then he could have just used an already extant assembly language).  He would then use that assembly language to make a compiler for the higher-level language he wrote the Machine's primary programming and operating system with.  Once code becomes a compiled binary, it's almost indecipherable what language it originally was compiled or assembled from.  (I'm sure certain languages and compilers have certain quirks that allow for disassebly and identification of their original language, but as far as I know decompilers and disasseblers require that you know what language the compiled binary originally came from before you try to decompile/disasseble it.)  So even if Samaritan was only able to find compiled binaries, it would then have to try to disassemble/decompile them into every known programming language and then decide the likelihood that one that doesn't have a known result might be the machine or just some hobbyist's project (but given Samaritan's reach, it'd be able to figure out the origins of any unknown code not related to the Machine).  It could have been that Samaritan was actually looking for non-compiled source code, which the Machine would probably keep on hand in order to modify itself.  I'm honestly curious how the Machine is able to stay off the grid."
PersonOfInterest,31xuzp,TeMPOraL_PL,4,Thu Apr 9 03:06:04 2015 UTC,"Few remarks:   A lot of high-level languages nowadays have their own virtual machines, with their own bytecodes, so the ""Alien code"" found in RAM may be just something that does not resemble neither x86 assembly nor any popular VMs (JVM, CLR). With the rising popularity of JIT (just-in-time compilation), a lot of code that is being executed is suspended in the VM's bytecode, only to be dynamically translated to machine code when needed (e.g. often executed pieces of code). There are compiled languages that ship programs with their own compilers embedded in them - it's common in the Lisp family, Common Lisp being the prime example. It's a language suited for dynamic code generation and recompilation, i.e. you can literally ""write code that writes code that writes code"", and everything keeps being compiled down to the machine code. With the introspection capabilities this language has, an AI written in something similar to Common Lisp wouldn't even have to keep non-compiled source code around; it would be able to dynamically update the compiled form. I think I saw some Lisp code few times in PoI... If I were Samaritan, I'd focus on searching for code that is written in self-modifying style. Actually, this makes using anti-virus software perfect in yet another way - self-modifying code is a good tool for writing malware.    I'm honestly curious how the Machine is able to stay off the grid.   I have my pet theory that maybe the Machine is piggybacking on Samaritan's infrastructure. It may have scanned the entire world, but has it scanned itself? She might be hiding where she's least expected to be (which would also explain the ""superpower"" of being able to hide Team Machine identities from Samaritan better than the magical ""seven servers"")."
PersonOfInterest,31xuzp,naeads,2,Thu Apr 9 12:43:44 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly curious how the Machine is able to stay off the grid.   My guess is that the Machine is not on any known network, so it housed itself somewhere secluded and employed some freelance postman to take and send out letters from printouts (like Thornhill's office) at a periodic basis, calculated an event that is going to occur and issue letters of instructions beforehand to other sources (like the telecom companies) and effect real life changes through them right down to the second of a future event becoming reality.  As for direct communication with root, that is probably done through a private line using Finch's mesh network."

PersonOfInterest,31xuzp,john_gilpin,3,Thu Apr 9 03:16:31 2015 UTC,Finch created an entirely new Language Code (Which was what Daniel Casey meant by 'Alien' in RAM) to design and code the machine. He must have built his own Assembler and created the entire machine OS and infrastructure.
PersonOfInterest,31xohq,1701ncc,5,Wed Apr 8 23:34:42 2015 UTC,"You might try Fringe. It takes a few episodes to get going but it has a definite arc to the entire series.

PersonOfInterest,31xohq,serralinda73,3,Thu Apr 9 02:52:26 2015 UTC,"Fringe. it starts episodic and goes so far from that at the end it's pretty amazing.  Current shows:  I've also been watching 12 Monkeys. Just when you think it's going to become predictable, some batshit insane thing happens.  Agents of SHIELD was kinda Meh until after Captain America, Winter Soldier. It's gotten way way better.  Orphan Black is coming back on the 18th of April and I can't wait. Interesting characters, yeah one actor playing (is it up to 12 yet) different characters is amazing.  The Flash started out good, has been getting better and better every show. The only weak part is the CW styled romantic noise, still a much much better show than Arrow.  Oh and let's not forget Hannibal on NBC.   Edit: Almost forgot Longmire. All praise to Netflix for picking it up after the fiasco of A&E tv cancelling the second highest rated show on their network. The characters are very very good."
PersonOfInterest,31xohq,pyres,3,Thu Apr 9 04:48:29 2015 UTC,"Most people don't take the show seriously, but I think Chuck might be right up your alley.  It's more comedic, but the action is excellent and creative while the characters have some interesting depth to them. The story is unpredictable as well, with some great curve balls thrown in that make the tone more serious. The first season is especially more serious than later seasons, and more heavily involved in the spy storyline. And just like PoI, it features espionage and shadowy government agencies. Give it a shot, it's on Netflix.  Also like others are saying, Fringe is superb and might have the best balance of formulaic-to-serial of any recent sci-fi show in my mind. The first season is probably 75% episodic, but the last stretch of episodes leads to a more interesting overarching storyline that the show maintains throughout its run. It's also very serious but with humorous undertones, just like PoI.  tl;dr Give Chuck a chance and you may really love it. Fringe is superb."

I have been watching this show since it began and the only people I know who watch it are the people who I am seeing watching it and that is my dad (my mom and brother are usually asleep during or halfway in the episode). I have said multiple times to my friends, acquaintances, even people I barely know about POI. I get at least three responses. The major response is ""I heard about that."" The other response would be ""I never heard of that show"". The least response I will get is ""I have seen just a snippet"". I have never got anyone saying they actually watch the show nor have I got anyone to watch it under my conviction. I told one guy during a bus ride about the premise of the show and about the artificial intelligence (which is a spoiler if someone starts the show in the beginning). I have told him all about the good stuff of the show and all about the sci fi stuff, but it just doesn't work. The people I have told the show about have an uninteresting face and make me think they don't really care about it. (Hey it makes sense, I have never seen Breaking Bad, Game of the Thrones or other mainstream shows even when people tell me how good it is). POI is like no other show, it is truly the best and that's an understatement. It seems like the people I tell the show about don't think evil artificial intelligence God like machines are that cool. I bet they only watch Big Bang theory or NCIS and other crappy shows that aren't creative and original. I wish their was a secret to get people hooked on the show. Someone needs to create an article explaining this secret. Yet I know that when POI comes on Netflix, a lot of my friends are going to be seeing it and then I'm going to overhear about them shouting about the show and I will be like ""Bitch, I've been watching this show since it began 5 years ago and I am like the biggest fan."""

I was at about episode 8 of s1 and he thought the show was pretty cool. He started watching the first few episodes on his own (without me knowing) to try and catch up on what's going on.

Then again, a search for vengeance may take him to some interesting places and answer some long unanswered questions."
PersonOfInterest,31vcdw,patentlyobvious,5,Wed Apr 8 14:42:27 2015 UTC,"I might be in the minority here, but I did not interpret the kiss Reese gave Carter to be about romance at all.  I think he thought they were both going to die (or both likely to die) as HR stormed the building.  He was expressing camaraderie, saying goodbye, thanking her for her friendship.  If Carter wasn't his single best friend, she was certainly number 2 after Finch, and he probably did love her, just not, I don't think, romantically."
PersonOfInterest,31vcdw,pensee_idee,4,Fri Apr 10 05:15:08 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way, especially due to the retcon they performed in which Carter became the reason Reese stopped trying to kill himself and gained a purpose."
PersonOfInterest,31vcdw,SavannahNix,11,Wed Apr 8 18:20:46 2015 UTC,"Carter became the reason Reese stopped trying to kill himself and gained a purpose.   I see no retcon.  Carter was the former, because she connected with Reese.  The latter came from Finch."
PersonOfInterest,31vcdw,ab_emery,2,Wed Apr 8 20:07:54 2015 UTC,"The bullet he supposedly had been carrying came out of nowhere. It was a retcon. Nothing Carter said or did that first night made him stop trying to kill himself. She tried to be understanding, saying some ex-soldiers needed help returning to civilian life, but he was resistant to her overtures. When he didn't respond, she quit trying and ran his prints, which he knew she would do as he didn't care if he lived or died.  It was Finch who did both for Reese, who told him he didn't need a support group or pills, but instead needed a purpose. Had Reese not accepted the job Finch offered, he might never have crossed paths with Carter again. He and Carter gained a connection later, yes, but not during that one short first conversation. Reese never once credited her with changing his outlook until the morgue scene in The Crossing.   I don't mean to be argumentative, but if he had at any time told people asking about who had helped him that ""a great woman gave me a purpose"" when they asked him how his life got turned around, I wouldn't call it a retcon."
PersonOfInterest,31vcdw,SavannahNix,3,Wed Apr 8 20:48:59 2015 UTC,"His lack of response doesn't mean he didn't care.  He also didn't respond to Jessica five years earlier.  He didn't explicitly credit Carter before The Crossing, but that doesn't mean he owes her nothing.  Finch told Reese he knew exactly everything about him, and that what Reese needed was a purpose -- more specifically, a job -- and Reese walked, probably due to the way his previous job turned out.  Ultimately, Finch did give Reese a purpose, but he had to connect first.  I don't think it's too big a stretch, never mind a retcon, that Carter broke the fall.  I think Reese considered there could be more than ""one person who connects you to the world..."""

For one thing, he was arrested multiple times and it would have been taken or he would have had to use it when running out if ammunition at some point.   I just think that whole conversation was fanservice by the writers when they knew Carter was going to die.  But we all have our own take on things."

This could either mean that Reese goes rampage in a trip for vengence ... or, what I really don't hope to be true, someone from TM dying .."
PersonOfInterest,31vcdw,Unbelievablemonk,5,Wed Apr 8 14:48:22 2015 UTC,"Well, there was an episode promo that revolved around Bear, and we ended up seeing less than 5 minutes of him. This is why I don't watch promos. Since deus ex machina isn't going to happen, I think Reese is either going crazy or the flashbacks are of stuff involving Carter that would change his mind about something (maybe a big decision). That's my favorite kind of storytelling, and PoI is brilliant at this. Here's hoping something great is going to happen - it is episode 20 after all."
PersonOfInterest,31vcdw,shinsaikou,1 point,Wed Apr 8 20:52:21 2015 UTC,"As cold and - quoting the machine - sadistic as Reese can be, I don't see him going on a roaring rampage of revenge. Ever. Even in his angrier moments, he's more composed than that."
PersonOfInterest,31vcdw,Rehnay,2,Wed Apr 8 19:50:04 2015 UTC,"He did right after Carter died, where he hunted down Simmons relentlessly."
PersonOfInterest,31vcdw,shinsaikou,2,Wed Apr 8 22:20:23 2015 UTC,"Ultimately he was after one man, and ultimately he couldn't go through with it."
PersonOfInterest,31vcdw,ariyahvansh,9,Wed Apr 8 22:30:01 2015 UTC,I'm hoping that this promo is misleading and that the episode doesn't feature so much Reese manpain.
PersonOfInterest,31vcdw,mrhashbrown,2,Wed Apr 8 15:18:45 2015 UTC,"This is episode 4x20, so maybe John is just hotboxing in his SUV and having a sad high."
PersonOfInterest,31vcdw,patentlyobvious,3,Thu Apr 9 04:52:21 2015 UTC,"Imagine just 40 minutes of him slumped in a smoky SUV, sobbing and taking pot shots at squirrels out the window with his gun. Could have been their April 1st episode.   He calls up Finch with his 10/10 shower thoughts about life which make no actual sense, and Finch just sighs and places the phone reciever quietly on the desk and ignores his rambling, continuing to tap away on his keyboard.  They missed their chance and already had the medical marijuana episode before 4x20."

I doubt we'll see Carter alive again, but I wouldn't be surprised by a cameo taking place in John's mind.  But the question now is why. After that ominous line from him in the last episode telling Finch he ""won't be around forever"", I'm a little worried."
PersonOfInterest,31vcdw,shinsaikou,2,Thu Apr 9 04:17:55 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of death flags for Reese and the producers have often joked about JK being the one on the chopping block... but I just don't see it happening. John is a fatalistic pragmatist. As mentioned elsewhere, I think that Finch and Root are the ones to really look out for. They've each shown how far they would be willing to go for what they believe in and who they love. Finch's continuous refusal to pick up a firearm is +1 death flag for him, IMHO."

Now that it's present (ugh!), they need to figure out some decent way to handle it. (I admit, however, that I've entertained several ways in which this storyline could go, and none of them are satisfactory.)   I don't understand why some people are so miffed about Carter's death. It was done so well. ""The Devil's Share"" was in itself a spectacular tribute to her that revealed just how profoundly she'd impacted a number of characters.   Honestly, on a show like this, it would be flat-out unrealistic for every character to survive. Carter's death was built up well. She died having accomplished something of utmost importance to her; therefore, her story was wrapped up neatly. Her death then moved the plot forward. This was probably one of the best-written deaths I've ever seen on TV."
PersonOfInterest,31vcdw,nick_pl,0,Sat Apr 11 03:29:26 2015 UTC,"There are so many open subplots a this (Elias, Dominic, the conch shell girl, Shaw, Riley/doctor and surely some other I'm temporarily forgetting) apart from the main one and they're bringing in another one?  A little closure is what this shows need IMO. It seems like they're always trying to enlarge the plot but doing so they are  making every episode more insipid, flavourless.  I like the show because of the genre and main plot but I don't know if I'm going to continue it. Not when they make 4 episode per season together with 18 other placeholder come out.  There.

Let's be honest POI probably has one year left, 2 if we are lucky. This show has evolved so so much since season 1 it will continue to evolve if John dies or even if Finch were to die. As long as the writing continues to stay as good as it is now and doesn't go back to being a ""Number of the Week"" I will be happy."

I could buy that this is a Red Herring whereby Finch will be, once again, unwilling to do the ugly thing which must be done to both assure the team's survival and assure the best outcome for humanity at large.  Specific reasons why I think all this Reese angst is a red herring..."

PersonOfInterest,31wjej,eikeegimuu,1 point,Wed Apr 8 19:51:59 2015 UTC,"I think they're definitely building up to Reese either dying, or almost dying and having to change/grow as a person in order to stay alive.  Lately, he has voluntarily been taking too many risks with both his cover and his life.  If he lives, it's going to be because he voluntarily chooses to start being more careful, and to stop trying to sacrifice himself at the drop of a hat.  I am as scared for Reese now as I was in Season 1's ""Number Crunch"" and Season 2's ""Shadow Box"" and ""Dead Reckoning.""  Other times he's been running around the city bleeding to death, I haven't been seriously worried about him not surviving.  But those were all times when it at least seemed possible that he might be permanently captured or killed.  I feel like that now, too, like the season finale might be a time when his character actually could die."
PersonOfInterest,31wjej,whitewater2,3,Thu Apr 9 17:35:18 2015 UTC,"Frankly, it has started to seem likelier. But only if 5th season is going to be the final season, which I'm now starting to worry about. And I'm in denial anyway about even the 5th season not being confirmed.  I agree with other posters that the story could go on satisfyingly without Reese or Harold but they'd definitely loose a lot of viewers without Reese (more than with anyone else leaving). I think they'd be willing to suffer that in order to tell the story they envision, but only if it's the last season because otherwise a next renewal would be more problematic. But that would also mean that loosing Reese can't probably happen already in the previous (=this) season's finale. But I am getting worried.   It could be that Caviezel wants to leave or that the holdup with announcing the renewal is that they are deciding on whether 5th is going to the final season or not or a final season with less episodes (if Caviezel would be killed off in this season's finale). Geez, to think POI is the first show where I've started to eye the ratings and renewal rumors and I'm straight away down the rabbit hole.  Either way the show's done a good job with making us insecure about the fate of the presumably safest character. But it does feel that those things with Reese have to have some payoff and if it's not him being killed it's gotta be something else and not just a gotcha."
PersonOfInterest,31wjej,whitewater2,3,Wed Apr 8 20:25:05 2015 UTC,"JC is in no danger in leaving. If Finch/Reese die, you know its the last season of the show as CBS would not be willing to let them kill off oen their two big names on the show and think it will last a few seasons without either one of them.  Story wise, the show can carry on without either one of them, but numbers wise (viewers is what I mean) it wouldnt carry that well and would fizzle out. They know a lot of people tune in specifically because JC is in the show.    Im quite concerned after next season (5th season) if a renewal will happen. Im a huge fan of the show but not confident in CBS at all. I am hoping that when NETFLIX/WGN in the US starts their syndication this fall that we will see an influx of new viewers for next season.  CBS didnt help by moving the show from Thurs 9 to Tues 10, but its the hand that was dealt. Critical acclaim this year is helping the show and the fans finally get some well deserved coverage on the show.  I know we are waiting for a renewal this year, latest would be the CBS Upfront but hoping that its announced at the Paley event this Monday which I will be at."

I of course take that as a clue that I am not all that insane in thinking this is not a regular flashback, but where the ""cold case"" is played out in a delirious and hurt Reeses mind.

PersonOfInterest,31w4nz,lingben,16,Wed Apr 8 16:54:28 2015 UTC,"My personal theory is The Machine lost the government feeds when they shut down Northern Lights and booted up Samaritan. However, as a byproduct of having access to every bit of surveillance data for four (?) years, its collection of passwords and biometric data is such that was able to bootstrap its own feeds by tapping into email accounts and camera networks, installing spyware, etc. Root's crew may have spent some time helping as well,since both ASI's seem to need human programmers to further their evolution."
PersonOfInterest,31w4nz,turbov21,5,Wed Apr 8 17:06:35 2015 UTC,Basically the God's Eye from Furious 7. Which I am convinced was based on Person of Interest anyway.
PersonOfInterest,31w4nz,your_mind_aches,5,Wed Apr 8 18:43:35 2015 UTC,"So was I, but it was based on it in the most movie-like way possible.  The idea that the code and processing power for the ""God's Eye"" was contained on a chip the size of a flash drive?  And that it had to be brought with them to use it (Ever heard of remote access)?  Or that you had to ""Be within 2 miles to hack it"".  Yeah, it really made me appreciate POI, and how comparably realistic they treat the idea (That it would need a server farm)."
PersonOfInterest,31w4nz,Rationalspace787,1 point,Wed Apr 8 20:51:30 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Although to be fair, it wasn't an AI that tracks people or does calculations to predict things. It's just a tool that hacks into nearby devices to track someone. Which is still a stretch.  That said, I loved the movie anyway. That ending was so much feels. I cried so hard in the cinema."
PersonOfInterest,31w4nz,your_mind_aches,2,Wed Apr 8 21:20:47 2015 UTC,"No predictions, but they did say that it could find anyone anywhere in the world, which means close to, if not even more than, machine-level access.  Also running facial recognition, voice sampling, etc. on every networked device in the world would take far more than that chip could possibly do.  That being said, I tried to put aside my disbelief of that technical detail and enjoy Furious 7 for what it is, an over-the-top action racing movie.  Also totally agree, the ending hit me right in the feels."

PersonOfInterest,31w4nz,ghostoblivionII,15,Wed Apr 8 18:38:09 2015 UTC,It never lost the feeds because it moved itself and they don't know where it's sucking the feeds from.
PersonOfInterest,31w4nz,Trueogre,3,Wed Apr 8 17:25:56 2015 UTC,"I agree.  The government hasn't been giving the Machine the feeds since before it moved itself.  It still has them, but now it's taking them, and it has been since sometime during Season 2.  There's an episode in Season 3, where Root's in some kind of secure facility, where the camera feeds aren't just secret, they're encrypted, and everyone's using encrypted walkie talkies - and we know this because the Machine is watching through those cameras, and it has a little note telling us how top secret they're supposed to be."
PersonOfInterest,31w4nz,pensee_idee,2,Thu Apr 9 00:49:47 2015 UTC,Yes. The machine still has it.
PersonOfInterest,31w4nz,TheKingsQuote,2,Wed Apr 8 17:22:44 2015 UTC,I'm assuming the Machine set up backdoor access to the feeds while it was still working for/with the gov't.
PersonOfInterest,31w4nz,BellatorInMachina,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:43:56 2015 UTC,It also has the feeds from other nations so I'm assuming it's simply hacking them. I think both AIs kinda needed to get the feeds from the gov to learn and evolve to gain new abilities like hacking on such a scale.

I suspect that the story arc for the season got kind of mixed up with the real life pregnancy of Sarah Shahi, which is totally understandable, but the rest of the season has felt like it's kind of just floundering without a sense of direction. Maybe that was deliberate on the behalf of the writers, to show the impact that the possible(??) loss of Shaw has had on the rest of the group."

PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,rossbot,10,Wed Apr 8 20:40:40 2015 UTC,"100% agree. The show has basically gone nowhere in terms of advancing the plot after Shaw went MIA. All Chekov Guns were loaded with blanks. Neither TM nor Samaritan have made any significant gains or losses.  I'll be disappointed if nobody dies, gets captured, or the Machine gets found by the end of the season."
PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,TeMPOraL_PL,3,Wed Apr 8 18:10:02 2015 UTC,"The last episode is titled YHWH - that is, the name of the God (of Abrahamic religions). I'm betting big Samaritan will reveal itself to the world."
PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,shinsaikou,23,Wed Apr 8 22:38:59 2015 UTC,"This struck me as a very cheesy TV Tropey moment - on a show that doesn't have many of them. Reese had rounds in his rifle, Root had the advantage... Assertions that this may be foreshadowing the team flipping her eventually are interesting, but but as far as the team knows, Martine killed Shaw. I have a hard time believing they would take her unless she could provide incontrovertible proof of Shaw being alive and well...  Hell, they probably just want to keep her around as a ""bad guy"" regular viewers can put a face to. Greer isn't in the habit of getting his hands dirty and the team hasn't had problems with the law since taking down HR."
PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,jankisa,28,Wed Apr 8 09:05:34 2015 UTC,When was the last time Reese murdered someone in cold blood like that? I'd buy Root doing it and would agree with you that it's a trope but I just don't think that it's in John's character to kill a unarmed person lying on the floor.
PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,darkkaos505,6,Wed Apr 8 12:41:41 2015 UTC,yea I agree I mean he has been shooting people in the knee cap for a while now.

It could be that he really does feel torn between the Finch and Root schools of thought on how to deal with your enemies...
PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,Staff_of_the_Goths,3,Wed Apr 8 19:41:18 2015 UTC,"But he was ready to shoot the Congressman. And let's face it Martine is a killer and I don't think Reese would have any qualms about shooting her, sort of like when he went all Rambo after Carter was shot. So yeah, I was disappointed. I just hope they don't pull a cheesy move like Private Ryan - let the German go and he kills Tom Hanks; let Martine go and she kills a member of the TM. As for rehabbing her, I just don't see it."
PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,SavannahNix,2,Wed Apr 8 18:32:17 2015 UTC,I think Reese is becoming Finch...

PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,OfficerMurphy,10,Wed Apr 8 06:26:03 2015 UTC,"I can't see her being much of an ally, least of all a friend of Root.  But a lone ranger perhaps. She doesn't seem to like taking orders."

PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,pensee_idee,38,Wed Apr 8 17:36:12 2015 UTC,"I'm worried that Reese has a death wish at this point.  He's clearly not planning on being around much longer.  I think the next episode will decide if he lives or dies.  He's either going to find some kind of peace, and decide not to follow Carter to an early grave, or he's going to make a plan to go out in a blaze of glory.  I'm also worried about Samaritan's ongoing plan to put computer chips (that broadcast bio-data) into every person.  Why was Greer so happy to confirm that the Machine isn't on any networked device?  Does knowing where it's not somehow tell him where it is?  What's going to happen with the war between Dominic and Elias?  What's going to happen with Caleb and his compression algorithm?  What's going to happen with Harper getting texts from the Machine?  What's going to happen with Control?  What's going to happen with Shaw?  I suspect some of these plot threads are going to have to carry forward into next season.  But I'm really wondering how much is going to come together and get wrapped up in the final two episodes of the season.  It would be unusual for them to leave this much dangling between seasons.  I also feel certain that either Dominic or Samaritan (or both) are going to be betrayed by one of their trusted agents who've grown disenchanted with their employer."
PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,SavannahNix,8,Wed Apr 8 03:54:15 2015 UTC,Why do you think Reese has a death wish? What has given you that impression?
PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,BallisticGE0RGE,18,Wed Apr 8 04:24:19 2015 UTC,"I see him taking increasing risks, and being increasingly unwilling to let things go.  In ""If-Then-Else,"" the Machine certainly thought that Reese would sacrifice himself to protect Fusco, and in the final shootout, he used his body as a shield to protect Finch.  He was also prepared to use his body as a shield to protect the young woman he rescued in ""MIA.""  He said to Finch that he won't be around forever, and that he wants Finch to be able to defend himself, implying that he expects to die soon, and he expects Finch to outlive him.  Today, he also broke into Riker's prison to extract the number, and they both nearly died in the ensuing chase.  It's hard to overstate how reckless that was.  He's not very careful with his cover identity.  It seems like he never shows up for work, he's showing up in illegal gambling venues, and he's continuing to act like a vigilante, even when he's not wearing a mask, and even in front of people who think he's a cop.  Tonight especially, he took chances that could easily lead to blowing his cover.  He did not want to let situation with the psychiatrist and the delivery guy go - Reese wanted someone to pay for the wife's murder.  He didn't want to give up on the CEO tonight, even though trying to protect him meant taking incredible risks.  And it looks like next week, he's going to go lone wolf to try to solve a cold case that Carter started.  Everyone who turns their back on the team and sets out to do things all by themselves has died on this show."
PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,SavannahNix,11,Wed Apr 8 04:40:32 2015 UTC,"Well, these are not new developments for Reese. He has always taken reckless chances, for the entire four seasons. That is business as usual for Reese, as far as I can tell. And why Finch hired him.  And when he tried to quit the team last season after Carter's death, the Machine wouldn't let him, remember?  He will never ""turn his back on the team"".  There is no way the show is killing off the lead character of the show either.  Are you saying his therapy has made him more depressed and now wants to die? Even though I am no fan of the Iris storyline, even I think that makes no sense."
PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,BallisticGE0RGE,3,Wed Apr 8 04:52:27 2015 UTC,"Not really, more often after Carter's death, Reese has seemed...like the therapist has pointed out, to have a hero's death wish. Like he needs to put his life completely on the line, as if he regrets not doing enough to save Carter.  But that could just seem that way because the show is escalating, and Reese is in more danger than ever before."
PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,Alinosburns,2,Wed Apr 8 05:35:43 2015 UTC,"Well, some see Carter as the be all and end all of Reese's life, but I don't. Iris doesn't know enough to comprehend his actions, she just gave the ""death wish"" line because that us what it looks like on the surface. If you think he would let himself get killed to atone for Carter and leave Finch unprotected...?   I think they have overdone the man pain in regard to Carter."
PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,Dewdropvelvet,3,Wed Apr 8 05:49:21 2015 UTC,"It's not that big of a deal, it's kind of subtle if you ask me. He just seems more willing to throw his life in front of others, like Finch or Fusco, or Shaw or Root...  The machine obviously saw it too. And it's not a bad thing, it's not like he's crying every day over Carter's death, he just wish he could have done more."
PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,patentlyobvious,7,Wed Apr 8 14:17:16 2015 UTC,"and even in front of people who think he's a cop. Tonight especially, he took chances that could easily lead to blowing his cover.   The problem is it's hard to distinguish what's supposed to be cover for them. And what is a result of it being a television show.  For instance in reality. There is no way that they would go to a remote location that could potentially be samaritan related without all having masks on.  Even if they can take out camera's like shown, if they had accidentally gone into view of one. Their cover is blown.  If samaritan has a satellite, they could potentially be tracked back from the vehicles used to a spot where samaritan is able to find an image of one of them.  And since not one of them is supposed to be out there. It would lead to Samaritan decimating their identities.    The Shadow Map is sort of used as an excuse to that. but at some point they come back onto the grid which still launches risks."
PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,patentlyobvious,3,Wed Apr 8 12:24:43 2015 UTC,"Reese has ALWAYS had a death wish, (sort of) that's nothing new. I always think of him as Reacher from Lee Child, come to life. How Reacher's mannerisms would be, etc.   You ask a lot of questions.   I'm not so happy with Samaratins personality. Did they have to make it so annoying and brutal, with all this appearance of math? I just wish it had more of a personality besides ""a brutish machine, psychopathic,"" etc. It does seem to serve its master, that old guy."
PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,lordxeon,2,Wed Apr 8 09:05:17 2015 UTC,"Well it is the nemesis of the machine after all, who is by comparison very humane. We just haven't seen much of that side of the machine lately.  Also Samaritan is it's own master, and it and the old guy both know that."
PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,TeMPOraL_PL,5,Wed Apr 8 14:10:04 2015 UTC,"Reese is definitely acting carelessly given the circumstances, I think he is frustrated by the constraints of his new job/role. I'm expecting him to blow his cover before the season is over. How he and the team survive that happening will have to involve something like an infiltration of Samaritan, or a significant betrayal or leak that cripples Samaritan.   Why was Greer so happy to confirm that the Machine isn't on any networked device? Does knowing where it's not somehow tell him where it is?   I assume he was quietly impressed that the machine has been able to evade detection, and perhaps impressed with his takeover of the antivirus software. I don't see any reason he would believe the machine has been eradicated anyway."
PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,lordxeon,48,Wed Apr 8 14:31:10 2015 UTC,"does Anyone else get the vibe that Martine is slowly (if ever so), starting to loose her faith?"
PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,TeMPOraL_PL,14,Wed Apr 8 03:05:24 2015 UTC,"I do. She seemed disappointed in this episode, and it's hard to blame her - she's clearly getting sidelined. Also, she doesn't strike me as a believer - she joined Team Samaritan for some reason (maybe we'll have flashbacks explaining it), but it definitely isn't faith in AI-god."
PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,Dewdropvelvet,12,Wed Apr 8 22:49:57 2015 UTC,"it definitely isn't faith in AI-god   I think that's going to play a key role in Samaritan's downfall.  None of the Samaritan agents are faithful servants (perhaps possibly Greer).  So as they see themselves being sidelined and cut out of the loop, or just killed because they're a loose end, they will question their allegiance.  However, all these people who are currently questioning their values*   Link Martine Nautilus girl   I don't think all of them will survive.  *at least by /r/personofinterest belief"
PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,patentlyobvious,8,Wed Apr 8 23:07:59 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's exactly the direction I think the whole thing will develop in, though I'm not sure if this will be enough to bring down Samaritan itself.  There's a strong parallel between Elias/Dominic and Machine/Samaritan - the former care about their people, the latter treat them as pawns. Elias and the Machine have people who are truly loyal to them, which is something Dominic / Samaritan don't and can't because everyone on their side know they're expendable. I really like this trust/loyalty subthread and hope it will get developed well."
PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,SawRub,9,Wed Apr 8 23:19:07 2015 UTC,"No, but that would be nice. I guess. Why are all the girls on this show (except for Root) so aggressive? Like blunt instruments? Like they have too much testosterone? Even Zoey is like that. No subtlety.   The therapist is good, I guess, but more on the other spectrum, the kind of girl Finch dates, the mild and kind scaredy-cat. But I like her. More of her, please."
PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,GrayManTheory,25,Wed Apr 8 09:11:57 2015 UTC,"Why are all the girls on this show (except for Root) so aggressive?   Most of the guys are too, apart from Finch, it makes sense considering their situation, and I like that the women aren't given special treatment just for being female.   No subtlety.   Remember Root began as a psychopath, and has learned a lot of subtlety along the way. Zoe has plenty of subtlety I thought, she is just a career driven person. If you want more nice people on this show you might be disappointed."
PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,BallisticGE0RGE,5,Wed Apr 8 13:47:42 2015 UTC,Yeah and I think people's personalities on the show are that way just because those are the kind of people this line of work attracts.
PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,Pascalwb,72,Wed Apr 8 19:11:45 2015 UTC,The shootout choreography on this show is getting lazier and lazier. People just walk out in the middle of gunfights like fucking retards.

PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,patentlyobvious,3,Wed Apr 8 06:44:07 2015 UTC,I noticed that too. What networked devices could exist OUT of this world? Space station sounds exciting. But doesn't the Machine need lots of server to maintain its computational power?  I know this sounds absurd but the only place Samaritan won't look for the Machine is Samaritan itself. I still have a strong feeling that the Machine is hiding somewhere very close.

What that line meant was that it wasn't hiding in plain sight on people's personal computers. Which was a popular fan theory.   That said, it did search for that unique programming language.

The machine does not exist in a physical place, it is now simply computer code hidden within every piece of technology containing code in the world.   Samaritan thought it could be found because it was originally written in a totally unique, never-before-seen language. But I think the Machine rewrote itself to be indistinguishible from every piece of technology it 'infects'. The Machine will soon simply be indistinguishable from all technology, future and present."

PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,lordxeon,8,Wed Apr 8 09:08:11 2015 UTC,"I've heard that theory before but I don't think it's likely.    The latency between satellites in orbit and the rest of the Internet is way too high - the Machine wouldn't be able to process fast enough to ""think"" in real-time like it needs to do. True the writers may ignore the latency problem but they're usually fairly good about catching technical details like that.  The few times we've seen the Machine's physical hardware it's been HUGE - like impossibly large warehouse huge. We've never been able to launch something that massive in to orbit before. Even if they used Caleb's magic compression algorithm to lower the amount of physical storage needed it'd still be way too much to launch in to orbit unnoticed.    There's a small possibility that maybe the Machine would copy a cold backup of itself in to a satellite, but why bother? It can accomplish the same goal with much less hassle by burying a cold backup underground somewhere.... Like say maybe a certain abandoned subway station..."

True the writers may ignore the latency problem but they're usually fairly good about catching technical details like that.   While there are other reasons pointing away from that conclusion (like your (2) - though storage isn't a problem (just launch few tons of SSD and HDD mix), the actual problem would be power requirements and heat dissipation), I don't think the latency would be a problem if she uploaded herself to Low Earth Orbit. It's just around 100km up, the latency is miniscule (it's below a single milisecond for the signal to do the round-trip). That's why SpaceX is planning to deploy a LEO constellation to provide global Internet access.  It would be a really cool twist though if, say, the rise of private space industry was because the Machine wanted to move herself to space. Also, an interesting overwatch point for a god."

PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,HSChronic,3,Wed Apr 8 22:58:53 2015 UTC,"You make a good point about LEO. I based my original assumption around current Internet-providing satellites, which are usually in a much higher synchronous orbit (Google says average 35,800km altitude). I assume it's done this way because deploying self-tracking dishes to home customers would be too expensive.   But you're right - the Machine wouldn't have any problem setting up an array of self-tracking dishes around the globe to keep a fix on LEO-sats.   Related question about the SpaceX project: How are they solving the tracking problem?"
PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,Altair05,2,Wed Apr 8 23:54:48 2015 UTC,"It's just around 100km up, the latency is miniscule (it's below a single milisecond for the signal to do the round-trip).

PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,ixforres,2,Wed Apr 8 03:01:38 2015 UTC,"The ""poor planning"" I was referring to was the construction of the case allowing for an electrical shock to destroy the tracker, not the Machine's planning. My apologies for any confusion."

It's also (not unrelatedly) very good at blocking radio signals, like a faraday cage in this case (model aircraft builders and UAS operators often learn the hard way that mounting their antennae within carbon fibre tubes or on carbon sheet isn't a smart move). So it'd make sense that the antenna might well be integrated with the outer shell."
PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,lordxeon,6,Wed Apr 8 14:17:57 2015 UTC,"I liked the episode. It had a good flow. The stories were not exactly parallel but the switches didn't jar and both had similar sense of urgency + the characters ended up pursuing the same goal sooner than expected.  Root was alternating between casual, calculating, irrational, playful, sullen, vengeful, somber and delighted (all the while being of course overall awesome). Yeah, I'm happy Root was on for more than just couple of minutes this episode. But I would like to know what's up with the relationship and communication b/w Root and the Machine. The communication is supposed to be patchy but what's the logic with when the Machine is directly contacting Root and when not (unless the Machine is just occasionally trying to keep things interesting for Root :P)  Harold called Reese during the shoot-out in the woods by his undercover name, now that's keeping a cool head.   I liked Zoe's and Reese's interaction.  The number getting killed was a surprise. Both because team Machine lost a number and because when he was brought before Greer I assumed Samaritan had decided on some other use for him, but no.   Martine didn't seem to be enjoying herself quite as much as in previous episodes, I doubt that was just about a bad hair day for her.  Of course there were other things that’ll be followed up later on. Like that Harold seemed to think that Samaritan’s/Greer’s method of looking for the Machine would eventually be successful but Greer stated they came up empty. Or that Samaritan is reaching not only into government resources (or laying low and pinching off resources from average consumers) but is simply appropriating the resources it wants.  Some additional stray thoughts:  Root picking up wi-fi signals over her implant was I'd assume her repeating what the Machine told her but she seemed to be too concentrated for it to be just parroting. Course the most sensible thing is that the Machine was giving her the info via a code that Root had to translate in her head.  Was it just me or did the red pattern in the number's eye seem like not quite a reflection? But I guess it must have been either from the cigar or from something on the screen. Though I thought it didn't look like it but anything else would be way more sci-fi than expected (though I like sci-fi so I'd be game)."

PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,m1tt,16,Wed Apr 8 17:06:38 2015 UTC,Season 3 had a similar feel to it.  The episodes between The Devil's Share and the Congressman episode were hit and miss.

Episode 1 of Season 4 started with a journalist getting killed by Martine for recognizing the existence of an artificial intelligence.  It seems to be an issue when they directly recognize Samaritan rather than speaking about AI on a theoretical level.    Martine: No, I understand. You're saying an artificial intelligence bought your paper so you'd lose your job and your flight would be canceled. And you'd end up back at this bar...where the only security camera would go out. And the bartender would have to leave suddenly after getting an emergency text. The world has changed. You should know you're not the only one who figured it out. You're one of three.

PersonOfInterest,31t4nz,kgyre,7,Wed Apr 8 18:42:11 2015 UTC,"I think that there are a couple of small, subtle signs of Root's continued grief for Shaw in this episode. In the restaurant, she's eating pancakes, Shaw's favourite food. (She had pancakes in the previous episode too before Finch joined her. Ashley Gable tweeted that this was Amy Acker's idea to honour Shaw.) Also, when Khan is in the safehouse with the team and mentions the stock market flash crash, Root promptly stands up and leaves the room for a moment, presumably because the mention of that crash triggers her memories of Shaw getting shot in front of her. I just thought that these were nice little touches. I loved the conversation between Reese and Root at the end as well."

Could be Root and Martine have already had a chat off-screen (or we just didn't see it during the shoot-out sequence).  That Root has picked up some hand-to hand combat skills (and yeah, why not from Shaw) was evidenced also in M.I.A where she knocked out the police guy. Martine would presumably be a tougher adversary of course, but could be that hand-to-hand is not Martine's strongest skill either."

PersonOfInterest,31u9cy,Phoenix309,9,Wed Apr 8 11:59:32 2015 UTC,"I wondered the same thing at first but, with all the close calls near the end of the episode, I think it's more likely that someone will get shot or kidnapped because of Finch's unwillingness to use a weapon. Finch is always the voice of reason on this show and believes most things can be handled without a weapon. I think this was just a way to foreshadow that, at some point, Finch will learn that isn't the case."
PersonOfInterest,31u9cy,_LilSebastian_,2,Wed Apr 8 06:09:35 2015 UTC,the voice of reason   I doubt that Finch's actions at some points are still within reason. I mean I think his overpazifistic behavior now is just to cope with the loss of Shaw and Carter with him always thinking that his development of the machine led to the killing of dozens of people. I think he makes it his fault that all this misery happens.

PersonOfInterest,31u9cy,SvenTreDosa,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:58:45 2015 UTC,Reese seems to be as unconcerned as ever with the risk to himself though he is growing more worried about the situation in general as evidenced by him urging Harold to pick up a gun. That ought to play into some future developments. Harold being reluctant to use a gun turns the future regrets angle towards Harold.   So I’m slowly starting to think that as unlikely as it seems Reese could really be in danger. Or maybe Harold will not pick up a gun to save his own life (instead failing in trying to save Reese). I think it has been more subtle than the red herrings usually deployed in the case when all ends well for the hero. Unless the showrunners plan to end with the next season I can't believe they'd shake things up that much as to kill off either Reese or Harold – but if next season would be the final season then I’d be more inclined to believe that all bets are off. I have feeling I will repeating a variation of the but-but-they-can't-or-can-they until the season finale has aired.
PersonOfInterest,31u9cy,eikeegimuu,1 point,Wed Apr 8 18:30:28 2015 UTC,"I am seriously wondering if Reese dies at the end of this season.  I think they've been foreshadowing it for awhile now.  It seems like he is prepared to die soon, and is more willing than usual to sacrifice himself.  I haven't been this worried about his future since he was arrested by the FBI and then had a bomb vest strapped to his chest by a vengeful former colleague.  If Reese lives, I predict that it will be because he both (1) comes very, very close to death and (2) has some kind of emotional revelation where he forgives himself for something, finds some value in his own life, finds something outside of himself that he wants to live for rather than dying to protect, etc.  I think he will either be killed or transformed over the next three episodes.  And I like that this show makes that seem possible.  On other shows, I'd think that ""nah, they'd never get rid of Jim Caviezel.""  And maybe they wouldn't, really, but the way the show has been written so far, and things that the producers have said in interviews, make me think that it actually is a real possibility.  And I like that."
PersonOfInterest,31u9cy,pensee_idee,2,Wed Apr 8 14:21:39 2015 UTC,"They've written this show in a way, in my opinion, that it could continue on without Reese or Finch. Now, that wouldn't be very popular because Reese is awesome and Finch is just a complete bad ass. They have written the other characters in a way though that would allow them to carry on without them. I think that gives people the feeling that perhaps no character is safe and maybe causes you to invest more in the characters. However, I really don't see Reese or Finch going out until the end of the series, whenever that may be, seeing as how that was pretty much the end game from the start. I believe it was said in the beginning by Finch that one or both of them would end up dead so that may happen. Just don't see it being until the end of the show's run."

I've said it here before, and I'll say it again: I truly think that the only reason it hasn't been announced as renewed yet is that they're working on a deal to determine just how long the show is going to run.

PersonOfInterest,31oly9,Sempere,2,Tue Apr 7 10:33:35 2015 UTC,"I think 2 is the more likely option. We've seen the Machine on the DL this season, I think she'll start playing more openly.   She's Finch's baby - I'm pretty sure that when Finch was putting his own plan into action, The Machine came up with a similar but safer attempt at it on her own. When Team Machine gets down to it, I'm pretty sure they'll be opening a way for the two to Merge, as they've already established that Samaritan is global and can't be wiped out in a traditional sense."
PersonOfInterest,31oly9,IfTheyCame2HearMeBeg,3,Wed Apr 8 17:24:28 2015 UTC,Maybe do what Harold did to the Machine: Make Samaritan wipe its own memories every night at midnight. Wouldn't defeat it but would render it crippled and weaker.

PersonOfInterest,31oly9,UltraChip,2,Wed Apr 8 10:21:53 2015 UTC,"The ways to neutralize the threat of the present Samaritan are very few but i visualize only 2 scenarios.   Machine destroys itself and samaritan. Only the Machine can do so. In that case when the Season ends - The Machine and Samaritan will both be destroyed and all surveillance comes to an end. Samaritan learns from the Machine and adapts the Machine's ethical and moral structure and you have 2 gods who help the irrelevant and relevant. Claypool had a self destruct code in Samaritan and it will activate destroying Samaritan.     Destroy the Servers and it uploads itself into the cloud - will not work. You need too much processing power and if you destroy the servers, processors and the Generators - you cripple it effectively. Even 15 Billion users (2 times the present population of Earth) on 15 Billion Handhelds cannot deliver that kind of Power to run a global surveillance system like Samaritan. So If you blow up all the servers in one go, all the processors, all the decima guys  in a single Rambo like operation - you may be able to destroy Samaritan but that sort of operation is for an Indie movie or Third Rate Korean Flick not a Nolan Series. And PS - i think Decma is already finished. It was mentioned in Panopticon.   If i was a writer i would use 1 - 2 Barmy reasons as a fitting end.

How sure are you that there isn't another copy frozen somewhere deep inside the infrastructure of an Western-European bank, Eastern-European search comapny's cloud, or some Asian government's server farm?

Neither the Machine nor Samaritan seem to operate in a manner like this. Also, once Samaritan loses dominance it would seem like the Machine might have a much better chance."

PersonOfInterest,31oly9,konraddo,1 point,Wed Apr 8 06:56:53 2015 UTC,"There are interesting avenues coming from actual theoretical work on superintelligences that I wish the show would explore, though I doubt it will (it would be too mind-bending/math-heavy for ordinary viewers to comprehend). It would for instance be feasible for both machines - especially if they gain read access to each other's source code - to reach an agreement and end cooperating for a common goal, or for one machine to surrender, maybe even terminating itself. Such scenarios do actually come out of math models predicting behaviour of rational agents capable of predicting one another - but they could be hard to believably explain to a casual viewer."
PersonOfInterest,31oly9,SavannahNix,0,Wed Apr 8 22:28:52 2015 UTC,"The problem is no matter what you plan against Samaritan, she will predict it and post you as perpetrator. In order to defeat her, you must not plan anything before doing something.  Talking about cutting her access to surveillance feeds: Samaritan could predict that and hack herself on any means you plan to use to cut her off access, and regain such access instantly. You could destroy all cameras in the world but she could hack bank accounts for funds and then hire people to install cameras back on.  I think the Machine's role in this whole mess is to act like a mother and calm down this child, Samaritan. The Machine can either tell the truth or lie to Samaritan that threat, big or small, no longer exists in this world, and thus her existence is not required. I don't think human can touch neither machines in any way, and it's just a prolonged battle between the two AIs. By the way, I think there's no need and no way for Samaritan to be destroyed. Its code is good and she obviously does her job (of finding threats) very nicely. Perhaps the two AIs can be merged to form something new?"
PersonOfInterest,31macf,IfTheyCame2HearMeBeg,8,Mon Apr 6 11:50:45 2015 UTC,I've seen quite a few people talking about how they want a root flashback (myself included). However what do you think the chances of us getting one are? After all I think all the other regulars have had more than one.
PersonOfInterest,31macf,Sabeckaz,3,Mon Apr 6 12:03:25 2015 UTC,"Yep even Shaw got 2(One where she was a kid and the one where she is a doctor). Root hasn't had one since season 2's premiere ep.  Also: The FUSCO could use another flashback as well, though Root is what I am crossing my fingers for."
PersonOfInterest,31macf,myst536,2,Mon Apr 6 12:27:00 2015 UTC,"Flashbacks works when there is a justification in the A or B plot.  There haven`t been any themes or stories where it would be natural to learn more about Root, but I am sure we will.   There have been less flashbacks this season because of that. We know most things now about these characters we need to know in order to understand what drives them."
PersonOfInterest,31macf,pensee_idee,2,Mon Apr 6 18:37:59 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I feel like I'd almost rather it stay hazy than watching her slide into moral depravity.  Maybe something like we got for Reese, where we just hear, when he's talking to a good soldier, that he got told to enlist after being arrested, and that he regrets joining the CIA.  I think we know that Root didn't really go into business for herself until after her mother died.  What Root's relationship with her mother was like, that kept her from becoming a mercenary, or what she became like after her death, I don't know that I want to see."
PersonOfInterest,31macf,EThorns,2,Tue Apr 7 04:57:51 2015 UTC,I have a feeling we may most of her journey come to light in Terra Incognita (episode 20).

PersonOfInterest,31macf,eikeegimuu,1 point,Mon Apr 6 16:14:51 2015 UTC,In a way that ought to be good omen regarding Root's survival chances in the season finale. Carter's screentime and SL was pushed a lot before she was killed off. That hasn't happened with Root and there isn't enough time left if other things are also getting developed (as seems to be the case). So actually I'm now a tiny bit less worried for Root than I was before.

PersonOfInterest,31n1vf,Sabeckaz,5,Mon Apr 6 16:17:35 2015 UTC,"Stray observation: In 1x21, Carter investigated a cold case that involved Reese. Now, three seasons later at almost the same episode number, Reese is investigating a cold case that involves Carter. Just thought that was kind of interesting. (Still have mixed feelings about this episode though.)"
PersonOfInterest,31n1vf,ariyahvansh,5,Mon Apr 6 18:10:11 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I kind of have mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, it'll be nice to see her again, but on the other, I am not sure how this could tie into the current plotlines. Surely we're not getting a filler episode this late in the season? I'm also hoping that it's not just a...Reese manpain episode."
PersonOfInterest,31n1vf,ariyahvansh,3,Mon Apr 6 16:25:55 2015 UTC,"I'm sure they could connect it to current plotlines if they wanted to even though it would demand a coincidence that goes beyond my comfort level. The coincidence of past and current case intersecting stretches the believability enough anyway.   I think that a complete stand alone is unlikely considering how close to end of the season it is. So I just hope that at least it will not connect to Samaritan (though Carter did figure out the AI bit, so any prior hints would help to explain that, but it would still leave a bad taste). But I'd guess that this late in the season a Brotherhood connection is probably unavoidable – could be the old case offers the evidence to put Dominic away etc."

They can go ahead & explore that with the two of them, while Reese does this thing in parallel. With this kind of angle, it's comparatively easy to make the past & present gel well."
PersonOfInterest,31n1vf,EThorns,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:15:52 2015 UTC,"I hope so, but I suspect that even if it turns out to be the story with less screen time that episode, the temptation is going to be there to tie it in to a bigger SL in order to advance a bigger plot too since the season finale is approaching. I hope they will not do that. I'd definitely prefer if that case was a standalone and would “only” serve to get Reese to a certain point (and I guess would be part of a bigger arc in that capacity)."
PersonOfInterest,31n1vf,eikeegimuu,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:27:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think that'll be the case here, cause very little of Reese's material seeps in to the main arc. As it should be."

You don't remember that his being sent to Ordos by Alicia Corwin and the laptop taken by Dillinger from Finch were related? How can the series lead character not be related to the overall story arc?"
PersonOfInterest,31n1vf,SavannahNix,0,Wed Apr 8 05:04:58 2015 UTC,"It's just that the main arc is a lot more compelling & intriguing when it's Finch & Root at the forefront, because they get it. The Ordos thing was ages ago, and everything since then, his involvement to the arc has been limited. Not saying that's a bad thing.  IMO, As far the core story's concerned, the show's lead character is the Machine."
PersonOfInterest,31n1vf,EThorns,1 point,Wed Apr 8 05:31:19 2015 UTC,"It just bothers me, I suppose, when viewers consider Reese unimportant to the show.   The Machine may be the main character, but Jim Caviezel has top billing."

PersonOfInterest,31n1vf,EThorns,1 point,Wed Apr 8 05:52:03 2015 UTC,"I see we disagree. While the writers have neglected him lately, I find he is the most interesting character. If you don't consider him unimportant, there are those that do, which baffles me."
PersonOfInterest,31n1vf,SavannahNix,1 point,Wed Apr 8 05:57:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is true.  In Matsya Nyaya. nr 20 of season 1, the POI plot met with the ongoing HR arc in the end, with Fusco and that detective whatshisname."

But then again, the closing endgame back then, was comparatively smaller. I'm sure this one would cover the arc stuff more than that.  And Erik Mountain (Many Happy Returns, Death Benefit, The Devil You Know) is co-writing this. That's a major confidence booster right there."

Reading the script leak it its about a case that Carter never solved and stumbles into the current storyline.
PersonOfInterest,31n1vf,whitewater2,1 point,Mon Apr 6 16:42:45 2015 UTC,"I have been waiting for this to happen since she said she was working on a secret project, and the shooting of Empire stopped. Also GP said something about getting actors back they never thought they would manage to.  So late in the season this will tie in with the main arc I am sure. Or one of them, as this might be an Elias case. Since TM vs Sam probably will move over to season 5 as well.   However - and this is the part that makes me a tad afraid: Since Carter is dead, there are only a few logical ways to bring her back storywise, and one of them is Reese having hallucinations while being hurt and captured somewhere. Suddenly having a timeshift in which we see Carter and Reese working together, is not plausible within the story. Our writers would not do that.   There might be time for a Reese cliffhanger from season 4 to season 5, in which we do not know whether he is dead or alive.  I am meeting this episode with trepidation."

PersonOfInterest,31h7pa,sniggity,3,Sun Apr 5 06:11:22 2015 UTC,IGN's guide isn't perfect. I think it would be great if the mods made a thread and we collaborqted to develop an episode guide.
PersonOfInterest,31fbf1,CobaltArkangel,25,Sat Apr 4 15:17:58 2015 UTC,"I think it's standard for series regulars to have lengthy contracts, to avoid actors skipping out before the show is done with their characters. So I wouldn't say that PoI planned to have six seasons...more accurately, they wanted to make sure they had the actors on lock for the foreseeable future."
PersonOfInterest,31fbf1,soren121,12,Sat Apr 4 16:24:27 2015 UTC,"This.  You want to lock your actors in for a decent length contract to avoid constant renegotiations that can delay production. That's what happened to the Big Bang Theory a few years ago. The contracts for the main actors were up, and they held out for more money, delaying production by a couple weeks.  It doesn't have anything to do with how long the showrunners 'plan' to have the series last. Networks don't care about a showrunner's 'plan', they mostly care about the show making them money."
PersonOfInterest,31fbf1,Azjeans,2,Sat Apr 4 17:15:16 2015 UTC,"It was actually last year, when the current season of The Big Bang Theory was delayed."
PersonOfInterest,31fbf1,peepay,5,Mon Apr 6 14:13:32 2015 UTC,Your math checks out.
PersonOfInterest,31fbf1,rpawson5771,5,Sat Apr 4 15:21:25 2015 UTC,"All series regulars on the first season of 24 were hired for five years. Two of their characters were dead by the first 3 years and the third died by season 5's premiere, and cause of lack of flashbacks, they can't be back either.  These things are incredibly tricky to figure out."
PersonOfInterest,31fbf1,EThorns,1 point,Sat Apr 4 15:47:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and normally the contract is more that it's optioned. If they want you for another season you've agreed to it.  And the pay you get as a result is likely reflective of that.  Ie because you signed yourself over for 4 years. We are giving you 140% per year of what we would have if we were to go year by year.  Which likely accounts for any payrises they would potentially get in the intervening years as a result of boosts in populatiry."
PersonOfInterest,31fbf1,Alinosburns,1 point,Wed Apr 8 12:46:46 2015 UTC,Season 5's premier?

PersonOfInterest,31fbf1,kgyre,1 point,Sat Apr 4 16:04:14 2015 UTC,"Shit, I didn't realize it was a show's name. I thought it meant, for some reason, that season 1 had 24 episodes. Which is also incorrect. -_-"
PersonOfInterest,31fbf1,ThatFag,-1,Sat Apr 4 16:29:42 2015 UTC,"Well that was 24. Person of Interest isn't nearly as fast paced(though still just as tense). They won't kill off characters on a whim. In fact, two of the female leads were removed only because their schedule could not fit in with filming(Ms.Henson due to leaving for Empire; Ms.Shahi for her twins). POI has not actually killed of a single character of their own accord."
PersonOfInterest,31fbf1,doritopope,5,Sat Apr 4 16:23:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know if Taraji was actually leaving for Empire though at the time, I think that was actually planned by the writers."
PersonOfInterest,31fbf1,EThorns,3,Sat Apr 4 16:31:59 2015 UTC,The pilot script for Empire wasn't even written by the time Taraji left POI. http://www.zen134237.zen.co.uk/Empire_1x01_-_Pilot.pdf
PersonOfInterest,31fbf1,rflairfan1,2,Sat Apr 4 17:09:46 2015 UTC,"She left because she wanted to do movies, theater. Empire came along and she only has to do 13 episodes instead of 22. Every interview I have read with her when she left POI, she said she was always going to leave."
PersonOfInterest,31fbf1,EThorns,1 point,Sat Apr 4 17:13:23 2015 UTC,"I think it was more than one thing. Taraji wasn't keen on doing a gig that lasted 7 years, and Nolan broke the news of writing Carter out to her in February 2013."
PersonOfInterest,31fbf1,rflairfan1,2,Sat Apr 4 17:53:22 2015 UTC,Correct. She also in interview seemed very happy about that.
PersonOfInterest,31fbf1,EThorns,0,Sat Apr 4 17:54:45 2015 UTC,"24 definitively set the tone of killing main characters only with the 1st season finale. I don't think it was originally intended from the get go, that they'd do that sort of thing.  But here's something that supports your case: Damian Lewis signed on with Showtime for many years, when Homeland was picked up. Though his character was written out in the end of season 3, he did appear in a ""hallucination"" in the next season, and now his pilot ""Billions"" with the same network got picked up to series.  Point being that even if Shahi signed on for 4 years, it would've been with Warner Bros. itself, and not necessarily restrict her to this one show. She can work on other productions for them, in the future, guaranteed for the remainder of time she has on her deal."
PersonOfInterest,31fbf1,john_gilpin,3,Sat Apr 4 17:03:04 2015 UTC,I am not familiar with shows and contracts but who actually gives the contract? Is is CBS who signs the contract with the actresses or is it the producers who sign the contract.  Why i ask is that there was a series called John Doe in which the Actor was signed for 3 seasons but the Show was scrapped in only one season.
PersonOfInterest,31fbf1,rpawson5771,1 point,Sat Apr 4 15:49:09 2015 UTC,"It would probably be the production company of the show (in POI's case, WB/Bad Robot) who in turn then sells the show to the networks for the broadcast."
PersonOfInterest,31fbf1,rflairfan1,2,Sat Apr 4 16:55:57 2015 UTC,"Nope that is extremely common. Leads on most shows sign 5-7 years. She is considered a series regular so she would have had to sign a must-year contract. They do that so they can have the actors under contract. It is also common for actors to be able to get out of said contracts. Taraji had to sign a multi-year contract even though she told them she wanted out, so she could do other things."
PersonOfInterest,31fbf1,Trueogre,2,Sat Apr 4 17:04:54 2015 UTC,They gave Amy Acker a contract to lock her into the show.  They didn't want her being poached full time by another series so they contracted her in but allow her to be poached part time by other shows like Agents of Shield.  So basically she's promised to POI but can pursue other things as long as it doesn't mess with the POI schedule.
PersonOfInterest,31fbf1,EThorns,1 point,Sun Apr 5 16:42:32 2015 UTC,"Especially in 2013, when Agents of SHIELD was on the horizon. But Root's arc in Season 3 was one of the best parts about it, and wouldn't have been possible if Amy wasn't on regular capacity.   Believe her contract calls for 17 episodes each season (it was the case last year & very likely the case for this season as well). I think now with Sarah off for the foreseeable future, they might re-up her deal to have her on in every episode in Season 5. I think they did that for Kevin Chapman this season. Dude hasn't missed a single episode this year."
PersonOfInterest,31fbf1,sanjayt,2,Sun Apr 5 19:25:10 2015 UTC,"If I am not mistaken, I think I had read an interview where Jonathan Nolan and JJ Abrams said that they intended to kill Reese but then decided not to after realising Sarah wouldn't be able to continue."
PersonOfInterest,31fbf1,myst536,7,Sat Apr 4 17:18:12 2015 UTC,"Joking about killing off Reese is to just rile up the fans. He is the least likely to get killed off before the series finale, along with Finch. Only reason would be if the actors themselves wanted out. Although they can joke about it as much as they want, they do know what they have in these two characters. They would not want to jeopardize that. They are showrunners, not fools."
PersonOfInterest,31fbf1,EThorns,7,Sat Apr 4 18:28:48 2015 UTC,That was a joke. They say that kinda stuff all the time.
PersonOfInterest,31fbf1,_LilSebastian_,1 point,Sat Apr 4 17:50:07 2015 UTC,"I don't care how long this show lasts, although, I hope it has a longer run instead of a shorter one. The only thing I hope is that this show gets a chance to finish out its story. If the time comes where the ratings start to decline, I just want them to be able to get to the end. This show deserves that and the fans of the show deserve that. Not to mention it would drive me absolutely insane to not know how any of the show would have ended. Like I said at the beginning though, hopefully we are a long ways off from that."
PersonOfInterest,31faei,IfTheyCame2HearMeBeg,9,Sat Apr 4 15:08:00 2015 UTC,"Only character I feel that really needs to have flashbacks is Root. She's the one with biggest gaps in her history. With the rest of the characters the trajectory (how they ended up where they did) seems pretty logical even if we don't know the exact details or have not seen it on screen - not that there may not be surprises once we do see it but at least the gaps aren't obvious.  Even Root's present actions have the tendency to happen off-screen. There's plenty of interesting stuff that's been happening in the present and we don't even see that so I think there's a strong possibility that Root's past will also remain hidden. Only reason I'm sorta zen about that is that any Root flashback better be fantastic and worthy of the character – so no flashback, no possibility that it turns out subpar."
PersonOfInterest,31faei,eikeegimuu,2,Sat Apr 4 18:29:51 2015 UTC,I would give an arm and a leg for some more root flashbacks
PersonOfInterest,31faei,queenbellevue,1 point,Sun Apr 5 14:02:47 2015 UTC,I know the feeling
PersonOfInterest,31faei,eikeegimuu,10,Mon Apr 6 18:27:15 2015 UTC,"Root's flashbacks needn't even have to be her distant past. It could simply cover her offscreen activities in Season 3, stuff she did under different identities after Samaritan came online in Season 4, her crisis of faith of sorts post M.I.A., and her work with Caleb. That's a wealth of material to explore."
PersonOfInterest,31faei,EThorns,3,Sat Apr 4 17:15:59 2015 UTC,I for one would love for another flashback on Root (Texas Days to Present) but somehow i have started feeling it is a waste as roots most significant event was the Hannah murder and after that Root has had no significant incident until she discovered the machine.  Flashbacks on Claire and Martine would be fun. But unlike Shaw - Martine seems to be a really cold blooded killer who is terribly mean - someone like Kara Stanton.  The Flashback on Greer was Incomplete. I for one would like the following flashbacks:   Greer - From the time he left MI6 to how he became the rogue he is  Dominic - From the High School boy in 2PiR to The current Rogue Claire - Why she became a recluse...???
PersonOfInterest,31faei,john_gilpin,3,Sat Apr 4 15:53:05 2015 UTC,"Well we have about 20+ years of Root picking up the tools of the trade, and it would be pretty easy to insert something there.  But yeah those 3 have some potential for flashbacks. But you don't need a backstory on why someone would become a recluse. Finch is a recluse, but we already know he's like that; it's his nature. And we already know Claire's parent's were killed in a car accident I think."
PersonOfInterest,31faei,DioxinBlues,1 point,Sat Apr 4 16:18:24 2015 UTC,It doesn't have to be much with Root but I would love to see how she transitioned into full-on assassin. I get that she was deeply affected by what happened to Hannah - a great backstory! - and she took the long road to enacting revenge - awesome - but at what point did she move into actually killing people for money? Where was that turn?
PersonOfInterest,31faei,Iam_TheHegemon,2,Sun Apr 5 00:18:10 2015 UTC,"Just throwing this out there, it's pretty much confirmed dominic was not one of calebs classmates in 2piR"

PersonOfInterest,31faei,EThorns,4,Sat Apr 4 17:20:11 2015 UTC,"Cause Harold took that high school class in late 2012, and Dominic looks atleast 30 years old."
PersonOfInterest,31faei,john_gilpin,1 point,Sat Apr 4 17:46:04 2015 UTC,Yeah but the Dominic dialouge and the 2PiR seems too coincidental. Maybe Dominic is a remedial student or maybe his younger brother attended high school and told him.

PersonOfInterest,31faei,eikeegimuu,2,Sat Apr 4 17:35:13 2015 UTC,I have not had that impression. Reese had most flashbacks in S1 but from then on it's been mostly Harold (and by extension the Machine).

PersonOfInterest,31d47t,UltraChip,8,Wed Apr 8 16:24:21 2015 UTC,Yep. The Cancellation Bear is extremely accurate when it comes to these things and he says it will be renewed.

PersonOfInterest,31d47t,Ryundo,6,Sat Apr 4 01:17:29 2015 UTC,"I have a sneaking suspicion that CBS and the producers are working on an endgame for the show. It will be renewed, but they may also announce that it's been renewed for a final season. Or renewed with a full season and a 13-episode final season to follow that."
PersonOfInterest,31d47t,DesertedPenguin,2,Mon Apr 6 19:35:42 2015 UTC,"I'd be okay with that, because honestly CBS likes to run shows until people stop watching and/or caring."
PersonOfInterest,31d47t,svrtngr,1 point,Sat Apr 4 04:03:28 2015 UTC,"Or renewed with a full season and a 13-episode final season to follow that.   I would love that. Have you ever watched Chuck? That show was on the verge of cancellation for every season since the second ended (it ran for 5 seasons), so the writers always had to come up with great endings for their loose ends which made awesome finales and semi-finales (season 4 ran for 13 more episodes, I still remember s04e13 resolved a crapton of subplots in just 40 minutes)  But with POI it's the opposites, they have subplots open everywhere and I'd hate it if the show were to be cancelled out of the blue."
PersonOfInterest,31d47t,Kebble,4,Sat Apr 4 16:13:24 2015 UTC,Most shows don't get officially renewed until upfronts in May.  Unless you are a very special show like Better Call Saul which got renewed for season 2 before the show even premiered.  Person of Interest falls under the normal show category so we probably won't hear anything until May.
PersonOfInterest,31d47t,SemSevFor,3,Sun Apr 5 18:36:18 2015 UTC,This is the first year it wasn't renewed in March.
PersonOfInterest,31d47t,rflairfan1,3,Sat Apr 4 00:18:14 2015 UTC,You people worry too much. This is an expensive show and it gets hood ratings regularly and it's almost at the hundred episode mark for syndication. Of course it's going to be renewed.
PersonOfInterest,31d47t,rflairfan1,1 point,Sat Apr 4 01:16:10 2015 UTC,"You don't need 100 episodes anymore, that changed a couple years ago it is 80-88 episodes now."
PersonOfInterest,31d47t,mrhashbrown,2,Sat Apr 4 15:31:26 2015 UTC,"Well it probably has enough episodes for syndication now (90 total episodes after this season ends), so they may be trying to gauge interest from other channels before deciding how many episodes to commit to. They did the same thing last year with Hawaii Five O, giving it a renewal for a fifth season and selling the rebroadcast rights.  I think season 5 is likely, just to give them a chance to see how syndication affects the show's live ratings. Just look at what syndication did for Big Bang Theory and NCIS - they were always on the fringe in terms of ratings (never high, never low) but both grew dedicated live viewership quickly once reruns began to air. CBS knows what its doing."
PersonOfInterest,31d47t,rflairfan1,2,Sat Apr 4 17:07:23 2015 UTC,WGN has exclusive cable rights to POI that start airing in fall of 2015. Netflix will start streaming fall of 2015 as well.

PersonOfInterest,31d47t,EThorns,4,Sat Apr 4 06:34:09 2015 UTC,"I think it's the decision on CSI which is making them delay it. They usually announce renewals of all their programming collectively, and because of that show being the oldest one (not to mention the one that changed the face of the network in the 2000s) in the docket, they need to have a definitive answer for it, before going forward with everything else."
PersonOfInterest,31d47t,rflairfan1,1 point,Sat Apr 4 08:13:33 2015 UTC,No. But every season of POI has been renewed in March...until this year.
PersonOfInterest,31d47t,mustard_mustache,0,Sat Apr 4 11:04:52 2015 UTC,"Tinfoil theory: Maybe no one has the answer because this is actually the final season and the producers don't want anyone to know.  That being said, I doubt this entirely."
PersonOfInterest,31d47t,john_gilpin,0,Sat Apr 4 01:15:45 2015 UTC,"Not yet.......there was a twitter rumour from someone who claimed to have got it during a shoot from one of the crew members but that seems highly unlikely (you can check it out from google or tv.com)  Personally in my opinion - i find that the show has become terribly gloomy and deeply pessimistic. Maybe realistic but it lacks the zing of seasons 1,2 or even 3. The dialouges alone and funereal and the repeated samaritan is all powerful in almost every episode is driving me downnnnnnnnn. I do hope for the final episodes to be more kick - ass and more the way it was in S01-S03 and i really dont care about the emotions or the acting or the realism. Just want Reese to kick the S**T out of people and Harold to be his usual self again."
PersonOfInterest,31d47t,Anti_pasto,0,Fri Apr 3 23:51:21 2015 UTC,"Seriously? I just don't get why you are complaining about gloom now. The show has always been depressing. This is a Nolan show, were you expecting rainbows, unicorns and parties? How can you not find that all those depressing flashbacks of the characters, sad PoIs, massive feeling of paranoia, big powerful threats like Elias, HR, The government etc everywhere and CARTER'S DEATH not depressing at all? Reese still beats the shit out of people. Yes he had difficulties at times but then again this has happened before in S1-3. You need a rewatch, sir. Why are you complaining now?  As for Harold, it is called character development. After all the things that has happened. You want him to what? Dance merrily when the world itself is going to hell? Bad news for you. Its only going to get darker when the war comes at full force.   Don't like the realism? Stop watching. Start picking Hawaii Five-o and the NCIS titles then. Loads of bad guys getting their butts kicked every episode with no character development whatsoever going on and on in a loop for the rest of eternity."
PersonOfInterest,31d47t,john_gilpin,1 point,Sat Apr 4 10:51:57 2015 UTC,"You missed out Castle.   I have become a POI watcher only since January and saw all the four seasons over three months. The Seasons from 1 - 3 had depressing moments but they were interspersed with kick-ass moments as well.   For instance - In Season 2 - Team Machine could not save Colliers Victim the Information Mogul or the Doctor who was poisoned by Polonium, Reese was kick assed twice by Elias in Season 1, Carter was killed by HR - but all these incidents were interspersed with those where Team Machine came on top of the situation. In fact the ratio of 25% depressio 75% winning.  Now - i see no wins at all. Every episode has a moment where there is no clear victory. Reese rescues a Tech Executive and boom Finch nearly gets himself killed by Claire, Reese rescues a Bondswoman and boom Finch plays prima donna with Root and the carefully laid out plan for getting information from Beth Bridges is down the cinder (For Now..). And every episode of Samaritan is a utter defeat for Team Machine (In 410 - the crimes escalate and over 100 incidents happen all thwarting the machine's irrelevant nos, In 411- Shaw is Killed, In 415 - Finch is nearly captured while Claire escapes with barely a scratch).   Realism is nice but the reason we watch TV is to have a feel good factor. Depression is ok but having every episode depressing is beginning to get on me and seeing 1 - 4 in a single stretch you can feel that the show has become more gloomy. The Fun element has gone out entirely. There are almost no fun portions except S03 (Wingman).  Would it be that bad if for at least one episode - Samaritan has a major failure and Greer is seen blowing the roof and Martine and Lambert are left huffing and puffing??? It would not be too bad would it."
PersonOfInterest,31d47t,_LilSebastian_,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:17:30 2015 UTC,"There will probably be a feel-good moment at the end of this season. I think a lot of people saw the tone of this season coming near the end of last season. Samaritan was  coming into power and the team had to go into hiding. This show has always done a great job of storytelling and showing how the characters are affected. Right now, the characters have had to overhaul the way they do things because of Samaritan. Personally, I enjoy seeing what it's like when they are backed into a corner like they are right now. Even though they are the heroes of this story, you get the feeling that sometimes they may not come out on top. To me, that's more compelling than knowing that no matter the odds, the good guys always win. That being said, I'm sure once they take down Samaritan there will be a lighter tone around the show. Hopefully not too light though because that's one thing that makes this show so great."
PersonOfInterest,31d47t,john_gilpin,1 point,Tue Apr 7 04:06:38 2015 UTC,Hopefully....you are right but once again - based on S4E19 - it looks likely that Samaritan won again and the Machine is in danger.   These Heroes never seem to come on the top in any of the episodes without terrible losses. i do hope the season ends out ok.

PersonOfInterest,31c8hk,1701ncc,2,Fri Apr 3 19:12:03 2015 UTC,"Probably in the minority here, but I'm completely okay with this development.  Frankly, I don't see the problem with it since Iris referred John to another doctor, and doesn't seem to be exploiting him.  And yes, it would be nice if Iris were more fleshed out, but I think enough can be inferred from what we've seen of her so far.   I wish he would just had a fling with Frankie, something that showed that he is breathing and alive.   This brings up my next point.  John's already had flings like that (Zoe), so here's a chance for something more substantial, maybe even related to his ultimate resolution.  After all, the very first scene of the show is between he and Jessica.  I also noticed this: Grace, to Harold: ""There's nothing you can say that will make me run away."" Iris, to John: ""There's nothing you could tell me in a session that would make me run."" Maybe it's just coincidence, but maybe it's an intentional parallel.  And hey, they're both redheads. :) All in all, I think there are some nice possibilities with this, so I'm interested to see where it goes."
PersonOfInterest,31c8hk,ab_emery,2,Fri Apr 3 19:26:19 2015 UTC,"John's already had flings like that (Zoe), so here's a chance for something more substantial, maybe even related to John's ultimate resolution.   I have a question though: do Reese and Iris even have genuine feelings for each other? I think that it's a distinct possibility that Reese's attraction to Iris is a case of transference; that is, Reese may be mistaking their patient-therapist intimacy for romantic feelings. As for Iris, she might be in hero-worship mode now that Reese has saved her life during intense gunfire. She may also be experiencing the ""Capilano Suspension Bridge effect"": she could have misattributed her heightened dopamine levels during the shootout to attraction to Reese.   Even if their feelings are genuine though, I can't really see how this could possibly end well. Why would Reese risk getting into a relationship with her if he knows that he could blow his cover and endanger Iris? He's already seen how Samaritan targeted Grace to draw Finch into the open. And why would Iris risk getting into a relationship with Reese when she knows that she could lose her license? Yeah Reese is tall, dark, handsome and enigmatic. Yeah he's a Batman-like superhero. Is that really enough for her to literally cry, ""To hell with the profession that I love!"" and start kissing him?  I'm not sure why the writers would pursue this subplot. Reese cannot possibly enter a long-term relationship. Iris dying to induce Reese's guilt and grief would just be redundant at this point in the show; we've already seen how Jessica and Carter's deaths affected him. And Iris being a mole seems too predictable.   I'm confused and fairly disappointed with this romance. I hope the writers do something impressive and surprising with it.  (I know that my comment is probably going to be unpopular, so I'm bracing myself for all the downvotes and backlash.)"
PersonOfInterest,31c8hk,ariyahvansh,2,Fri Apr 3 21:16:59 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said. Plus, the show has not, in four years, had the main characters having romantic entanglements and throwing this in now just doesn't work.

PersonOfInterest,31c8hk,Try_Another_Please,1 point,Sun Apr 5 00:26:06 2015 UTC,"The operative word there is ""past"" love interests. The show has never had romance as a focus, it has all been off screen and very little of that. This isn't Grey's Anatomy or Castle or Scandal, that isn't what I am watching for. I just find the tired old cliches of romantic feelings being the only conclusion for a character out if place on this show.  Even when Carter was dating Beecher, we never saw them kiss. The producers even talked about an unwritten ""no kissing rule"" yet we suddenly have Reese kissing two women in one episode? He has never even kissed Zoe on screen."
PersonOfInterest,31c8hk,SavannahNix,2,Mon Apr 6 04:26:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly ariya. I am as confused and soon-to-be dissapointed as well. I just cant see how this will not end up with another female in the fridge, While that sure gives some action, it is rather predictable.   I am still hoping the writers have come up with something that will blow me away.  As for the question whether they have really feelings for eachother - if the show were a drama, we could possibly have that discussion. Since its still very much action and sci-fi, I really dont know. Would the writers spend time with a subplot exploring the relationship between therapist and patient?  I really can`t see that though."

I really can`t see that though.   That's just it. In order for this relationship to develop properly, these kinds of issues really should be addressed. But given that there is so much else going on, I am not convinced that the writers have the time to explore these relationship problems. Romance has never, will never, and should never be at the forefront of the show. However, the Reese and Iris romance will now seem very forced to some viewers (like me). What's more, since Iris hasn't been fleshed out as a character and does not bear relevance to Samaritan or the Brotherhood right now, the scenes that Reese shares with her seem very disjointed from the overarching story. And as you said, right now, the only ways that come to mind on how to make Iris relevant to those overarching storylines are by 1) putting her in danger because of Reese's work, or 2) making her a mole for one of the enemy organizations. Both options are too predictable. Option 1 is even worse though, because then Iris would simply be another fridged woman in Reese's life, like Jessica, rather than her own character.   Does anyone here have any theories on what Iris's role could be, besides a mere love interest or a mole? I'd love to hear other people's thoughts."

PersonOfInterest,31c8hk,ariyahvansh,3,Fri Apr 3 22:46:32 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.   I think that Grace was developed far more as an independent character than Iris. She has hopes and dreams that are not related to Finch. She's an artist. We have seen some of the types of works she appreciates. She's astute. She's ferociously defensive of Finch's integrity. We heard a little bit about her personal life; she grew up around a number of people who lied to her. We saw that she found a way to move on after Finch's death; she began a career in Italy, one of her favourite places. What do we know about Iris? Not much. She has a pet (a dog or a cat-- I can't remember). A lot of her family members were cops, which is how she recognizes that Reese is not a cop. (But that's not a very remarkable observation because many other characters have been quick to realize this as well.) We know that she was firm and demanding to ensure that her clients would come to their therapy sessions. Other than that though, we don't really have knowledge about her personality or motivations. She seems very bland to me.   While Grace does primarily exist as a love interest to Finch, that's not really a bad thing in her case. Her character has been used to show us just how dangerous it is for our protagonists to be romantically involved with other people. Even four years after her engagement to Finch ended, she was still kidnapped by Samaritan operatives so that they could find Finch. Grace also been used to show us to what extent Finch is willing to make sacrifices to protect those he loves: he faked his death to try to ensure her safety because he knew that simply being near her would endanger her. It was a huge sacrifice for him. He also told Reese and Shaw that if Samaritan operatives harmed her in any way, they should ""kill them all"".  Jessica's role as a love interest to Reese has also been used very effectively in the show. We saw that despite being married to Peter, who was a good provider, she felt terribly alone. She also became a victim of domestic violence and died as a result. Reese's inability to stop this tragedy is one of the primary reasons why he first fell into depression and homelessness, then determinedly joined Finch's cause: the information provided by the Machine helps him prevent dangerous crimes from happening, which I think is how he copes with his helplessness in Jessica's case. (When he is unable to prevent Carter's death though, he becomes angered with both Finch and the Machine, and leaves the team for a while. This helps progress the plot and gives us more insight into Reese's character.) The manner in which Jessica died also drives Reese to be fiercely protective of victims of domestic violence, as we saw in ""Many Happy Returns,"" which I felt was one of the most powerful episodes of the entire series.   So now here's the thing: we already know why it's a terrible idea for the characters to be romantically involved with people who aren't part of Team Machine. Grace is ongoing proof of this. And Reese himself said in 4x14 that it would be ill-advised to bring anyone else into their dangerous lives, including Fusco, who has been with them since the beginning. It makes no sense for Reese to be involved with Iris just a few episodes later and thereby endanger her. He is going against his own words. He is letting his emotions cloud his judgment. Then, if Iris ends up dying, what exactly would that accomplish? We've already seen how bereavement has impacted Reese. Like I said, Iris as a fridged love interest would simply be redundant."

The resolution was that they shouldn't shut people out, and for Reese, it was about opening up, not shying away from getting close to someone."
PersonOfInterest,31c8hk,ariyahvansh,1 point,Fri Apr 3 23:44:04 2015 UTC,"It was Finch who suggested that   Does it really matter who suggested it, if they both agreed with the statement? Reese said that he knew that he and Finch would both probably die, but that seeing their friends die was far worse.    Fusco countered it by the end of the episode.   Yes, but he is already well aware of the type of work that Team Machine does, even if he's not aware of the existence of the Machine and Samaritan itself. He understands the dangers of being involved with the team. His willingness to help them, even at the cost of his own life, is an informed decision. What's more, as a homicide detective, Fusco has been in dangerous situations as part of his paid job too. Iris, however, is still in the dark about these dangers, and as a psychiatrist, she has not really been exposed to such frightening situations. So this raises a few issues. One, even though she believes that nothing Reese could tell her would make her run, if she was made aware of the precise nature of the risks posed by Samaritan, she might change her mind. Her decision to be with Reese is not, at the moment, an informed decision. But this leads to issue number two. Reese pretty much has no choice but to keep her in the dark. And that leads to yet another issue: Reese would constantly have to lie to Iris by both commission and omission in order to prevent her from finding out about Samaritan and the Machine. All this secrecy would create a very unhealthy dynamic.   If Iris is put in danger because of Reese's work, even when Reese himself said that everyone he got close to died, then he is so going to regret it."

""  Thinking about it some more, I think the options mole or fridged is too obvious for these writers. Maybe their intent is just to show off how Finch and Reese have developed over the years. In this one episode they both risk a lot by wanting relationships with someone. Finch risks his life, according to Root - and Reese risks Iris` job if they are not able to keep it a secret, and ultimately - her life. They are just two very lonely figures in this want to connect, to open up - even if they both know what is at stake.   Maybe the iReese can be a light subplot for awhile, seeing these two trying to keep the secret from everyone, including Fusco and Finch. Because - just imagine the speech Reese would have to endure if Finch found out...He who have let Grace believe he is dead, just to keep her safe.  Maybe that is the conclusion Reese will eventually come to as well.   Will Iris find out about his secret life? Will she tell when she does?   Yeah.... maybe this can work out as something the writers can use from time to time during season 5, to give Reese something other to do than fighting and shooting knee caps.   I think I am in the acceptance mode now. I can deal. nods"

With them underground, I doubt he could maintain a passable romance with anyone."
PersonOfInterest,3194td,IfTheyCame2HearMeBeg,3,Fri Apr 3 00:30:48 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I think that Finch did genuinely like her, but it's not like they had a solid basis for a real relationship.  Virtually everything she thinks she knows about him is a lie, and I think she'd be justified in feeling like he was using her, perhaps even betraying her.  Plus, it's not really a good idea for him to spend much time with her.  If any of Samaritan's employees decide to watch the surveillance of the woman they're buying software from, he'd be caught in a moment.  Samaritan might not be able to see him as Finch, but if Greer checks up on Beth and sees them together, that's game over."

Samaritan is defeated at the end.   6: Dozens of new AI are brought into the world.   7: The culmination of everything."

PersonOfInterest,311lvi,Psychedeliciousness,2,Thu Apr 2 16:48:19 2015 UTC,"It's odd, I'd say the show is less 'grim' now than it was in season 1. Even though the AI storyline has the potential to be darker than the mob/CIA/HR stories of old there is something about this season that actually feels lighter. I'm not even sure what it is, but it definitely is not as dark as it was in season 1."
PersonOfInterest,311lvi,fsutouchdown,2,Wed Apr 1 18:18:48 2015 UTC,"Agree with the 3rd point.  The unrelenting trend towards nihilism in movies and TV is annoying not to mention sinister.  It's almost like there's a conspiracy to condition us to accept violence, brutality, and people getting fucked over as just natural parts of day-to-day life.  I like POI, but at some point the ""good guys"" have to win just as they should and rightfully do in real life.  Like, I don't get people who actually want to see heroes/people who act altruistically out of morality and principle lose.  How fucked up does your worldview have to be and/or how fucked up do you have to be psychologically to actually want that?"

Have the Numbers of course, but I don't like any of the ones they've introduced this season. They're basically trying to fill the gap of Shaw, but now each one is like a personality clone of the last. I can't suspend my disbelief any more.  If... IF there was a new character, they could at least model it more after Finch. Not everyone on the show needs to be an ultra-competent super-spy with a cocky attitude.  edit: spelling"
PersonOfInterest,311lvi,kinglucktsui,1 point,Thu Apr 2 14:54:46 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you mean by ""get 6-7 episodes before it ends"". Do you mean if it is cancelled you want at least that many before it goes off the air?  I do agree that the show should have some more positives in it, but if they ll end up dead, which the producers have hinted will happen, not sure I've will get that."
PersonOfInterest,311lvi,Deadmond_,2,Wed Apr 1 12:56:53 2015 UTC,"I mean POI should have 6-7 seasons by the time the series ends, because 7 is the perfect number IMO(5 seasons is too short while 10 seasons is too long, and I doubt, but am secretly hoping, for an 8th season)  I didn't mean they should retcon their planned ending, but just let them enjoy the occasional little victories rather than simply experiencing setback-after-setback, which has happened ever since Samaritan went online. Maybe have an episode where they use Finch's backdoor, and find a way cripple Samaritan temporarily. All the victories we have recieved have come at a cost (Taking down HR-Carter got killed; Fixing the Stock Market- Sameen got captured, and presumed dead). I would appreciate one where we end it on a happy, or at least hopeful, note."

The knee is a complex joint after all. Treating someone with a shot knee is probably more complex than ""Here's a bandage. You can walk out of here in a week.""."
PersonOfInterest,311s6r,944tim,2,Wed Apr 1 12:51:03 2015 UTC,"If you wanted a serious answer, kneecap injuries are a flip of the coin, where best case scenario is a temporary limp(as seen with Finch) and worse case is needing crutches(also coincidentally demonstrated by Finch). The knee is a complex joint, and you can't treat it with alcohol and antibiotics. The kneecapee's could get a replacement kneecap, but the procedure isn't exactly pleasant. And you can no longer walk through airport security without raising red flags.  TL;DR Kneecap injuries are a flip of the coin, with best case recovering via physical therapy and replacement kneecaps in months,  and worst case needing crutches for the rest of your life."

Of course discrediting whatsherface's work would have been sufficient ... so it had to be about something else, say, losing Shaw. Addressing that would have made Root's extreme behavior more explainable.  That said, I agree that I've enjoyed seeing her develop a ""soul"", so to speak. Root has always been a great character, and she keeps getting better (much like Fusco, with whom she should be in EVERY SCENE)."
PersonOfInterest,30z0ng,jason_stanfield,5,Tue Mar 31 21:57:43 2015 UTC,I think it could be argued that she referenced Shaw. She wanted to kill her because Samaritan could possibly still use her or harold could still try and see her is she is discredited. Killing her is guaranteed and to Root that's better.

Its the first time that I can think of that Root has gone from wanting to kill to understanding the merits of not killing. Admittedly the plot progressing is a big influence. However Michael and Amy's performances totally drew me into the story, while watching it. It was only after that I started to realise that there were inconsistencies.   You're right in your points about root's behaviour. I guess Amy and Michael are just so good that I couldn't follow logic!  Thank you for replying"

I mean she checks out the Spanish guy with more than interest in S04E07, she also connects more than casually with the lawyer dude in Season 3 (The high school reunion bit) - so maybe Root loves Shaw romantically and Shaw loves Root as much as a woman can love a woman without getting romantic and maybe the kiss was just a final farewell without disappointing Root (like - Sorry Baby but i really like the fellas)."

The laptop went to Ordos, where a team were working on it Northern Lights sent Stanton & Reese to Ordos to ""recover"" the laptop (actually to be on the ground to verify that it was there so the stealth jet could destroy everything) Someone else killed all the scientists before (probably just before) Stanton & Reese got there That ""someone else"" took something out. The dying scientist said ""They came and took it away."" Stanton asked ""Took what away?"" and the scientist said ""The machine"" The laptop was left behind   Note that when Reese & Stanton walk up to the laptop, in the background we see what looks like rows of empty racks  I think the Chinese took the code from the laptop and used it to start building their own version of The Machine on banks of servers (remember - a recurring theme with The Machine has been the amount of power it needs). The Decima team that went to Ordos and killed everyone took the servers and left the laptop."
PersonOfInterest,30shqw,Gimli_the_White,2,Tue Mar 31 00:13:12 2015 UTC,"Greer was shown to have the laptop in Dead Reckoning, but he probably would've taken it from Stanton's bag. My guess is they left it there for her & Reese to find, for they knew they were targeted for elimination by the ISA. They probably felt they can use the betrayal as a catalyst to turn either of the two to work for them. Given they found Stanton, whom Lambert already met in RAM, she was the ideal candidate."
PersonOfInterest,30shqw,EThorns,3,Mon Mar 30 09:57:37 2015 UTC,"I considered that, but I think it's a bit of stretch for Decima's plan to be ""Hopefully Reese will be unwilling to kill Kara, she will survive a few missile blasts, and more importantly the laptop will survive the missiles too."""
PersonOfInterest,30shqw,EThorns,1 point,Mon Mar 30 10:09:23 2015 UTC,"Unless the pilot of the strikeplane is a Decima operative himself. Or they switched out the laptops in the site, and left a decoy for them to find. Reese & Stanton have no idea what the product looks like, so that's an added advantage."
PersonOfInterest,30shqw,EThorns,2,Mon Mar 30 10:11:07 2015 UTC,"The decoy laptop seems more likely, but I don't think so. Greer looked like ""You got this laptop for me. Thanks! :D"" You are just guessing right? So there's no confirmed explanation for this?"
PersonOfInterest,30shqw,EThorns,0,Mon Mar 30 10:23:45 2015 UTC,"Greer's exact words when he showed the laptop to Stanton were ""This is what your government sent you to find"", without any significant change in tone or body language. Makes me consider the fact that he had this planned for a while.  It is guesswork, yes. There needn't be a confirmed explanation for all of this."
PersonOfInterest,30shqw,mnr5530,2,Mon Mar 30 10:36:48 2015 UTC,"Whatever his exact words were, I just meant to say that I didn't get any impression at all that Reese and Kara got a fake laptop. And if it were I'm sure we'd learned it during the flashback episodes.    I guess this is just a detail the writers overlooked. (Seems unlikely that Ordos will be mentioned again just for this explanation)"
PersonOfInterest,30shqw,ab_emery,1 point,Mon Mar 30 11:29:38 2015 UTC,"Lambert did call Greer towards the end of RAM to tell him that they tracked the laptop to Ordos, and the latter told him to get a team together. That could've been the beginning of a plan coming to motion.  This is all speculation. The writers could've changed direction between Matsya Nyaya & RAM. Not all that uncommon in shows."

I was a bit giddy at the idea that someone had used my favorite comic at the time as a template. When we met Mr. Finch...named after a bird none the less...it just got better."

And I do feel that her traumatic childhood experience sufficiently explains why she subsequently shunned humanity: Root, as a child, saw her best friend being abducted by a pedophile and tried to do the responsible thing by informing the police and the abductor's wife. The appropriate action was not then taken though. Instead, Root was harshly reprimanded when she sought out adult help, and in the meantime, Hannah was murdered. So Root found that society didn't abide by its own rules. I can see how that would have pushed her to darkness. If society didn't play by its rules, if it did not uphold its moral codes, then why should she? (Also bear in mind that Root's home life wasn't great either; her mother was ill and inattentive. That may have contributed to her shift to villainy as well.)   Of course, there could be a lot more to her backstory. I am dying for some Root flashbacks."
PersonOfInterest,30n4u3,ariyahvansh,2,Sat Mar 28 23:20:21 2015 UTC,That has been also my impression. And I wholeheartedly agree with the need for Root flashbacks!  I'd guess that in addition to Hanna indeed something else happened that contributed to her becoming the person she was when she first made contact with Harold. Something that made her totally shed Samantha Groves and become Root full time.

Hannah was her only friend and her home life wasn't good and I think the trauma pushed her further from thinking people can be trusted. But she isn't really a sociopath, without feelings. She believed that computers were better than people. She was somewhat crazy when we first met her, but since being in communication with the Machine I don't think she is a lunatic any more."

Once Hanna was gone - Sam had no further objectives and no one else to befrien and so began to become a mercenary whose only job was to hack and kill.  Then she met Harold and Harold became her next Hanna (Harold and Shaw perhaps) and the Machine spoke to her and also persuaded her to follow the machines code of ethics and honor. So she becomes decent and nice and today a good friend and savior of team machine.  Finch does work off on others.

They're done hiding for now.  And no way do I think the Trojan trigger is destroyed. They actually shot a scene with the reveal, but cut it from the episode. And yes, it could very well come into play in what Root & Caleb are working on.  Root's in a place where'd be game for giving her life for this, but the show cannot afford to lose her now, especially when she's the only female regular left. As a character, she's the one they can experiment with the most, and in no way would it destroy her credibility. To pull a fake out of her wanting to do it, but saved in the last second seems a bit cheap, cause that's what they tried to do with Reese in The Crossing, and I don't think they'd want to repeat themselves."

I think she was implying that whoever activated it would get their cover blown, and then tracked down and killed. That would hamper everyone on team machine but Root, because of the sheer amount of cover identities the machine provides her with. She could easily activate the switch and go into hiding for a bit as another person, as compared to the other members who posses only 1 cover identity that would get them killed should Samaritan find out their true identities."

PersonOfInterest,30mckp,buddascrayon,1 point,Mon Mar 30 20:10:40 2015 UTC,I'm almost positive Root is going to sacrifice herself to take out Samaritan. At this point the only reason it won't go that way is to be contrary.   It's possible Root will face-off with Greer or Martine and they'll tell her that Shaw is dead. That will be the final piece that pushes her into a full-on suicidal frenzy to storm Samaritan's compound and take it out. (Maybe using the trojan to disable its security long enough for her to get in)
PersonOfInterest,30oiev,john_gilpin,19,Sun Mar 29 07:02:43 2015 UTC,"Thats like... uh your opinion man.  I think its great like this, it's more gritty and tactical. They have to be more pragmatic than guns blazing like they used to be. Plus it gives Reese some character, maybe their trying to develop a deeper Reese (which to me he seems less robotic lately.) He seems to be finally letting his guard down and letting others in, which may get him killed. If we wanted him to act like ""the one,"" that can never be stopped time and time again, I think they would have cast Keanu Reeves. And Shaw is still missing, I mean for them to be all hippity hoppity while they're worried about their friend would be kind of weird. Anywhats, I guess this is the direction the writers are taking the show and if you're not down, nobodies forcing you to go along for the ride.   TL;DR: character development man... and Orwellian states aren't all walks in the park through daisies and rainbows."

PersonOfInterest,30oiev,Anti_pasto,2,Thu Apr 2 06:42:47 2015 UTC,But the ratings have also dropped from 1.9 to 1.5 in the 18/49 demo right? that may also indicate that there are many others who share this opinion.  I dont say guns blazing all the time - but say comprehensive wins at least once in 3 episodes.   C'mon - Reese could take on 7 members of the Aryan brotherhood in a single go in S2E1 - twice. Walk in unscatched in a Russian Pawnshop with more than 10 goods. And here he is actually reduced to getting beaten by mediocre bad guys and Harper rose - by a truncheon blow.
PersonOfInterest,30oiev,soren121,4,Sun Mar 29 11:32:21 2015 UTC,"Like what he/she said, your opinion man.  Lol no. The dropping ratings has nothing to do with gloom or anything. If it did people would stop watching from s1 already considering how dark the show is. Its because the show has gotten more serialized and too ""complex"" as they say. Two things procedural lovers hate. Guess what? CBS is the channel for procedurals, people who dislike continuous, layered storylines and strictly enjoy case of the week structured shows gather here. So the viewership backlash is expected.  Oh he was shot two episodes before Guilty iirc. So it makes sense that he would struggle with the fixer. Disagree on gloomy Reese though. He did, for the first time I believe. Laughed out loud when he was with Iris and was unafraid to let her in. They even kissed in the end. I don't believe a gloomy man would do that?"

PersonOfInterest,30oiev,sleepless_indian,7,Sun Mar 29 18:07:02 2015 UTC,"The show changed. There is no ""man in the suit"" anymore. John went from a superhero to just one of many characters. When it was just John and Harold, all the screen time could be divided between them with flashbacks and what not.  I do miss the early seasons. I didn't like the procedural format but I loved seeing John be a badass. Then the show changed a bit. Now I loved the technical aspect of the machine from episode 1x11 where Harold shows Nathan how it could track that NSA traitor.  Then the machine did crazy stuff. Getting a fake ID, a company to circumvent Harold crippling its memory on a daily basis? That's awesome man.  Root described it best: The Machine is a god. Naturally, another god had to be made. IMO Season 4 started out great but yeah, seeing Team Machine get cornered and lose is getting old. But Season 4 is a transition season! They're on the defensive now but I'm sure it's about to change. Just look at the last few episodes.   The thing is, season 4 is a chess match between two gods we can't actually see. We only see that match through the pawns, the humans. That's why it feels like most characters have become a bit dull. Also the last few episodes have been mostly procedurals to allow a transition between the main arcs of the season. It'll end on an awesome cliffhanger that's for sure."

PersonOfInterest,30oiev,eikeegimuu,3,Mon Mar 30 07:10:13 2015 UTC,Well said. Only thing keeping the two gods away from war is a thin line. Happy days are over.
PersonOfInterest,30oiev,ab_emery,2,Mon Mar 30 12:22:19 2015 UTC,I'm also disappointed about the Harold and Elizabeth storyline. Grace is supposed to be his only true love and here he is acting like a school boy over Beth. Plus he and John don't have the same dynamic as they used too.
PersonOfInterest,30oiev,ab_emery,5,Sun Mar 29 09:06:41 2015 UTC,"Strictly speaking Harold was using her. I'd even say he might have put her life in danger – if the virus gets to Samaritan would there really have been a guarantee that Beth doesn't also get some of the “blame”. Harold keeping Root from killing her in rather dramatic fashion wasn't to me about him being enamored with Beth, he'd have reacted that way about any other innocent 3rd party (especially one he had pulled into the danger zone)."
PersonOfInterest,30oiev,ab_emery,-1,Sun Mar 29 19:20:37 2015 UTC,Yeah! Harold has lost his entire focus as whistler here. Why make him a middle class professor. What was wrong with Wren? Why not keep him rich and loaded. Every episode he seems to be committing blunders - like landing in the Samaritan web after getting fooled by claire; his jumpiness in E1; his inability to stop claire in E2;   Not at all the old Harold.
PersonOfInterest,30oiev,soren121,5,Sun Mar 29 11:40:35 2015 UTC,"landing in the Samaritan web after getting fooled by claire   This has more to do with his humanism than with making a blunder.   his inability to stop claire in E2   Sure, just like his inability to stop Nathan from going to the ferry terminal, and his inability to stop Dillinger from selling Casey's laptop to the Chinese..."
PersonOfInterest,30oiev,SavannahNix,1 point,Sun Mar 29 18:42:10 2015 UTC,No......in Nathan's case Finch did not even know Nathan's number was up or that Nathan was even in any specific danger. Likewise he had no idea that Dillinger was a scumbag opportunist who would do such a thing. But in this case He knew very well that Samaritan was the player of Nautilus and that Claire would end up becoming its pawn. All he had to do was to offer her something similar but no...
PersonOfInterest,30mj3i,ANOOO06,2,Sat Mar 28 19:15:36 2015 UTC,It sounds like generic club music. Just find something with the same BPM and you're 98% of the way there.
PersonOfInterest,30mkhb,Patternsix,4,Sat Mar 28 19:27:13 2015 UTC,I think it will either be years before we find out anything about Shaw -- or that we never will. I've stopped thinking about it.
PersonOfInterest,30mkhb,rpawson5771,3,Sat Mar 28 19:36:28 2015 UTC,To be honest I was surprised we even got that scene at the end of MIA. They could have dragged on the question if Shaw was alive or not but they didn't. Maybe they'll give us something more about her condition and what Samaritan is planning to do with her before the season ends.
PersonOfInterest,30mkhb,CatandWolf,2,Sun Mar 29 11:58:41 2015 UTC,"From Sarah: ""If she does come back, she's not going to come back the same Shaw, that's for sure.""  Full interview"
PersonOfInterest,30mkhb,ab_emery,1 point,Sat Mar 28 21:07:18 2015 UTC,Well then maybe what I'm think might happen.  If team Samaritan could turn one of the members of Team Machine then there really is no stopping them.
PersonOfInterest,30mkhb,CatandWolf,1 point,Sat Mar 28 22:46:50 2015 UTC,Have some faith in Shaw. She's not gonna break that easily. Here's to hoping TM will be able to defeat or cripple Samaritan enough before that happens.
PersonOfInterest,30mkhb,CatandWolf,1 point,Sun Mar 29 12:13:54 2015 UTC,"But if Samaritan can understand how a mind works, we are just a set of data and experiences that when combine create that thing that is ""you"".  So if Samaritan can use hardware to bridge the machine human gap.  Then all bets are off.  Think about the woman they rescued in upstate NY with that implant in her head.  I just wonder where the end game for that project was headed towards."
PersonOfInterest,30mkhb,eikeegimuu,1 point,Sun Mar 29 12:40:58 2015 UTC,"If Samaritan can do that, then gorramit, TM is screwed. I wonder if The Machine knows about this and what it's planning to do to combat it. That project's endgame is probably for another way to control humans. Stick that microdots on it and you'll never be able to escape Samaritan ever. Maybe we'll be lucky, or not depending on the outcome, and find out what Samaritan is planning to do with those neural implants."
PersonOfInterest,30mkhb,eikeegimuu,1 point,Sun Mar 29 15:34:57 2015 UTC,I'm wondering if the show ends with the very first time Harold turns the Machine in because of what happens.  The whole thing is a simulation.  No AI ever works because the know that at this point in humanity we aren't ready because in the end we destroy ourselves if we all AI into our lives today.
PersonOfInterest,30mkhb,eikeegimuu,2,Sun Mar 29 18:46:40 2015 UTC,In M.I.A Root took with her the brain implant thingies and that might indicate that it's something that will be followed up once the team finds Shaw. But Shaw being brainwashed or mind controlled would be tacky so I think it's going to play into it differently. It'd be more realistic if those are for monitoring and registering brain activity (and maybe analyzing it in real time).
PersonOfInterest,30mkhb,UltraChip,1 point,Sun Mar 29 19:56:39 2015 UTC,Nothing so cliche ... She would be rewritten .. There would be no coming back from what has happened to her.  The Shaw we knew died outside the fright elevator.  But the idea that root would have an elaborate plan to save Shaw by hoping to save her only to find out that she is dead.  The Shaw she would be looking at would be someone else.  Root would know that Shaw is dead even though they saved her.  Do Root kills Shaw it the person Shaw was replaced with.
PersonOfInterest,30mkhb,UltraChip,1 point,Sun Mar 29 20:00:35 2015 UTC,Wouldn't what you are suggesting mean either being brainwashed or mind controlled? Because how else would that change happen? If getting shot and possible brain damage would have resulted in that (and even then Greer’s guiding hand would be involved to reprogram her) we should have seen some change in Shaw when she was shown at the end of M.I.A in the hospital bed but she seemed like herself. And even if she was amnesic etc she'd be even more vulnerable to Samaritan (hello brain washing).
PersonOfInterest,30mkhb,john_gilpin,1 point,Sun Mar 29 20:34:31 2015 UTC,"Brainwashed would be Shaw but having been influenced through a torture of sorts.  No what I'm saying is like your computer running Windows they format it and install Linux.  Same hardware but all new software.  It's ""Shaw"" but someone new is driving the bus."
PersonOfInterest,30l0zn,PrintfReddit,10,Sat Mar 28 08:27:52 2015 UTC,"The actress is off on maternity leave. IIRC in interviews they've said she's going to be off for the rest of the season for sure, likely most of the next season as well."
PersonOfInterest,30l0zn,eat_pb,5,Sat Mar 28 08:44:19 2015 UTC,"Ohh damn, good for her though. At least that's better than quitting or being fired, she has hope for returning!"
PersonOfInterest,30l0zn,Trueogre,5,Sat Mar 28 08:47:13 2015 UTC,"She has said her number one priority is to her children right now and hopes to return in two years.  I'm glad she's optimistic about the series.  :D    I guess it depends on the shooting schedule against her motherly needs would determine if she comes back sooner or later, if at all.  They left it open so it's not like she'll never come back ever."
PersonOfInterest,30l0zn,AWildEnglishman,1 point,Sat Mar 28 13:58:59 2015 UTC,"There's hope, but I wouldn't count on it. She's going to be in full mother mode for a while now. Might even reach the final season before she gets  back."
PersonOfInterest,30l0zn,naeads,3,Sat Mar 28 11:33:41 2015 UTC,"Yea, if they want to kill Shaw off, she would be dead. But the fact that the show kept her alive means she has a high probability of returning.  I fact, I think this kind of story development is much better, it adds a certain type of realism, rather than portraying the main characters as superman, but at the end of the day they are still human."

PersonOfInterest,30ly4u,Ulicus,2,Wed Apr 1 00:55:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think the producers would have had Shaw written out of the show if a recast was planned. A different actor would have shown up and everyone would have acted like the new actor was still the Shaw character.    Given that, I would be annoyed at the producers for flip-flopping so suddenly by recasting Shaw after giving the character such a gut-wrenching sendoff."
PersonOfInterest,30ly4u,rpawson5771,2,Sat Mar 28 16:17:59 2015 UTC,"Nope. I can't imagine Shaw played by someone else. Sarah Shahi is/was perfect. If she's not coming back, all right. But don't make anyone take her role."
PersonOfInterest,30izwx,derek768,10,Fri Mar 27 19:56:03 2015 UTC,I am really Keen on a Reese (Pre-Army) and (Pre-CIA) flashback.  Likewise ROOT flashbacks are on demand.
PersonOfInterest,30izwx,john_gilpin,1 point,Sat Mar 28 02:57:21 2015 UTC,I heard that SPOILER so hopefully soon.   And I agree. We need to see Carter again in a flashback.

PersonOfInterest,30izwx,peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee,3,Fri Mar 27 20:54:42 2015 UTC,"Especially since Carter isn't related to the Samaritan arc at all. Maybe a Fusco flashback? On second thought, I'd actually love to see that."

It'd be fun to have the flashback case mirror the present day one.

PersonOfInterest,30dxm0,rflairfan1,3,Fri Mar 27 04:45:03 2015 UTC,Procedural shows are always at their best when they spend a few episodes without being procedural (like PoI in the middle of this season).
PersonOfInterest,30dxm0,REkTeR,3,Fri Mar 27 11:29:59 2015 UTC,I would completely disagree with that. I love the mythology of this show and others. When they do filler episodes most of the time they are boring.

PersonOfInterest,30ev8m,john_gilpin,1 point,Fri Mar 27 12:11:55 2015 UTC,Yes. Likely given that she is getting texts from the Machine - she has a purpose.

PersonOfInterest,30ev8m,ArachnoLad,3,Fri Mar 27 16:09:29 2015 UTC,"You guys are all haters. Yes, she will be a part of the team because the machine is recruiting her. Fusco was a crooked cop, Carter wanted Reese in jail, Root kidnapped Finch, and Shaw was not to be trusted until she ""died"". The only thing anybody can say about Harper is that she is annoying. Who gives a shit? She has certain skills that could be useful. She is pretty much invisible in plain sight. She already has multiple aliases. She isn't afraid of getting her hands dirty. Most important of all, she doesn't care about breaking a few laws.   Dani Silva is a cop. Like Carter, there are certain things she won't can't do. At least not now.  Frankie is all about the money. We don't really know how trustworthy she can be.  Zoe Morgan is too well known to be a full time part of the team.  Harper is the best choice. She has no family that we know of. She knows how to move around undetected. Greer doesn't know about her. She could also be the key to taking down Dominic and the brotherhood. That said, I don't think she will live too long. She will likely be killed by Dominic himself.  Edit: You're right"
PersonOfInterest,30ev8m,eikeegimuu,2,Sun Mar 29 04:45:35 2015 UTC,"I didn’t downvote you (though the swearing was uncalled for), but I’m replying to your post to point out that Harper not Frankie is the one who’s so far been shown being all about money. Frankie was the probably fake bounty hunter who chased her brother's killer (to kill him not to deliver him to authorities).   Harper may be a good choice in theory (that has basically been force feed to the audience) but I feel she comes across as fake (not believable), and that’s why I’m not looking forward to her being a recurring character as was implied."
PersonOfInterest,30dw3v,1701ncc,7,Thu Mar 26 16:15:19 2015 UTC,The issue with the books in the different order in the episode was because they could only use cleared social numbers by the show's legal department.
PersonOfInterest,30dw3v,EThorns,3,Thu Mar 26 17:37:36 2015 UTC,"Finch (or maybe even Nathan) programmed the Machine to come up with a code that was very difficult for any random listeners (say the NSA for example) to crack. Finch knows the words correspond to books in a specific library, a code Reese eventually cracked. And I'm unsure if the books were out of order. How would they know who to look into if they were given an entirely different set of numbers?"
PersonOfInterest,30dw3v,mustard_mustache,2,Thu Mar 26 17:30:37 2015 UTC,Finch did not want the guys running the Machine (Keep in Mind - the Machine became free only in S02 end) to know there was another guy who was getting the numbers - so the random words programmed on DD system in Finch's library.  There was a risk of the wrong order of books - but most likely the machine is programmed to put the words and books in a certain order. Likely Reese made a mistake
PersonOfInterest,30dw3v,john_gilpin,2,Fri Mar 27 16:13:09 2015 UTC,I think the production made a mistake. when they were filming they should have have seen the books were in a different order than given by the computer

PersonOfInterest,30doxa,burnerthrown,2,Thu Mar 26 15:19:55 2015 UTC,"No, Harold's plan is ruined. The trojan horse needed to be activated before being integrated into Samaritan, something Harold planned to do when he went to Beth's house that night. He never got near the computer. Further, with Beth's ideas discredited by Root (posed as a technology researcher), it is likely her technology won't ever actually make it into Samaritan's systems. Decima will discard her and move on. Even in the contingency that the discrediting simply stalls them from accepting the technology, giving Harold more chances to activate the trojan, yes, Root destroyed the device he was to use to activate it. The only chance now is if Harold is able to program a second device to activate the trojan and the previous scenario happens. All very unlikely."
PersonOfInterest,30doxa,SavannahNix,1 point,Thu Mar 26 19:19:41 2015 UTC,"If so, I am really annoyed. The show has not had Finch do anything at all to even attempt to fight Samaritan and this one thing that they went to all the trouble of introducing early in the season was totally wasted."
PersonOfInterest,30c7h2,CatandWolf,4,Thu Mar 26 04:21:06 2015 UTC,"I am pleasantly surprised that Root and Shaw are tied at 50% with Emma and Regina. The Shoot fandom is not nearly as vast or as rabid as the Swan Queen fandom, so I thought that Shoot would lose badly. Instead, it looks like whichever pairing triumphs will only do so marginally."
PersonOfInterest,30c7h2,ariyahvansh,4,Thu Mar 26 19:14:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I thought we'd get buried too but we're holding on. Other people from different fandoms are helping out too so that adds some numbers. We'll find out in about 9 1/2 hours if it all pays off."
PersonOfInterest,30c7h2,your_mind_aches,2,Thu Mar 26 19:35:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah... Once I saw Orphan Black won to Supernatural... yeah, I knew maybe we have a chance.   Considering Swan Queen and Destiel are 100% subtext and Shoot and Delphima are text (the latter even being ahem extremely canon) I'm hoping we have a chance here!   Honestly, I like Supernatural way more than Orphan Black but I voted for OB because I knew it'd lose. Pleasant surprise it won."
PersonOfInterest,30c7h2,ariyahvansh,2,Thu Mar 26 21:22:26 2015 UTC,"I just checked-- we're slipping in the poll. We're at 49%, and I don't know if the Shoot fandom can make a comeback in time. Let's hope for the best.   I think that it's precisely because Swan Queen only exists in fanon right now that its shippers are so zealous. Many of them seem to believe that winning these polls will give their ship the positive exposure that it needs to eventually become canon. (I'd hate to break it to them, but that notion is pretty ridiculous.) Others recognize that the subtext will never become text and simply want to revel in small victories like emerging triumphant in these TV couple contests."
PersonOfInterest,30c7h2,your_mind_aches,4,Thu Mar 26 21:43:46 2015 UTC,"That said, Shoot did exist solely in fanon until Root's feelings escalated to the point that it was so obvious.   And the sexual/romantic relationship still only exists in fanon.   Maybe the 100 or Castle ship SHOULD win.   Lol screw that Shoot all the way. 😂"
PersonOfInterest,30c7h2,ariyahvansh,3,Thu Mar 26 21:52:19 2015 UTC,"True enough! I cast my vote for Shoot and am keeping my fingers crossed. If we lose, I'll probably just go rewatch all the Shoot scenes on Youtube to make up for it. :):):)"
PersonOfInterest,30c7h2,your_mind_aches,2,Thu Mar 26 21:55:34 2015 UTC,"Swan Queen makes the mistake of being on a show with pinned down heterosexuality and actual romantic relationships.   On POI, everything is much more negotiable."

PersonOfInterest,30a006,man_in_the_suit,5,Wed Mar 25 21:14:10 2015 UTC,I thought exactly the same thing.
PersonOfInterest,30a006,Harak,3,Wed Mar 25 21:42:59 2015 UTC,"Finch using it would get Professor Whistler killed because Samaritan would see him with Beth Bridges right before it noticed it was being hacked.  I'm sure Root is planning to use it, just sometime when she's sure that turning it on won't make Samaritan suspicious of Finch."
PersonOfInterest,30a006,pensee_idee,2,Thu Mar 26 01:16:24 2015 UTC,That was my point haha.
PersonOfInterest,30a006,man_in_the_suit,2,Thu Mar 26 07:56:29 2015 UTC,"Interesting to think there might be a time and place to use it without detection quite soon. Although I feel like it can't be that simple. Samaritan may have the ability to trace where the data goes, leading it back to Finch or whoever plants/activates it.  Someone else suggested that maybe Root will end up using it at a point where she decides to sacrifice herself for the cause, perhaps at the end of the season, and the writers have said (and proven) that they arent afraid to kill characters off. Unfortunately this seems like a likely scenario to me."
PersonOfInterest,30a006,patentlyobvious,1 point,Sat Mar 28 08:25:12 2015 UTC,"That makes me think if Root claiming she would kill beth against the machines orders was the machines plan to keep Finch clear, they never intended to kill her."
PersonOfInterest,30a006,Afalstein,16,Thu Mar 26 09:11:20 2015 UTC,"Even if she did, I think the algorithim will come up again.  It just had too much buildup to be disposed of that simply.  On the other hand, if it is gone for good, it was masterful writing on the show's part, to build up the device as a legitimate strategy, before throwing it away for a person's life.  But damnit, Team Machine needs a win."
PersonOfInterest,30a006,eikeegimuu,8,Wed Mar 25 18:11:04 2015 UTC,"That Root didn't destroy it and plans to use it seems very possible. Except that she can't do it in the season finale, since Harold's last chance to activate it was during the dinner with Beth. So Root has to also activate it before the laptop is given to Samaritan next morning. Maybe Root's identity switches fast enough for that to be no problem, but then it might seem too easy. Could be she's going to modify it somehow, but one key element was getting it on Beth's laptop to Samaritan and that window of opportunity is closing fast.  It's also possible that Root did destroy it – it has already served it's purpose in the story too. Seeing Harold fighting back (and seeing his humanity) and Root's willingness to … prioritize."
PersonOfInterest,30a006,SmallerOn_TheOutside,2,Wed Mar 25 19:45:08 2015 UTC,"I think you are right. I posted a similar comment, should have read yours all first."
PersonOfInterest,30a006,eikeegimuu,1 point,Thu Mar 26 04:23:00 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day the trojan is there.  If they can't do it on Beth's laptop there will be another way.  What way, we have yet to know, but she's working for Caleb working on an algorithm.  Maybe she can activate the trojan through his company."
PersonOfInterest,30a006,KarlKastor,2,Thu Mar 26 20:02:28 2015 UTC,But it's not.  For that specific trojan the activation had to happen before next morning and it was designed specially for that hard drive and that virus.  I guess Root could steal also Beth's laptop and then “reverse engineer“ both the virus on the drive and the activation dongle and then go looking for another medium that will end up inside Samaritan. She might be able to use Caleb's company for that last part but at the end of the reverse-engineering Root would have to write new code that is undetected in whatever medium Root's going to use. So there would be a lot of ground to cover.   I'd have no problem if they go that way but I'd have also no problem if that was it with the dongle.   The sense of doom at the end of the episode seemed to imply that Root is going to use it and of course not showing the dongle in destroyed state indicates very strongly that it'll make an reappearance. I wouldn't have a problem with that either.
PersonOfInterest,30a006,SmallerOn_TheOutside,9,Thu Mar 26 20:48:34 2015 UTC,I also think Root didn't destroy the activation device. Lying was a theme in the episode so it seems like Root would also lie.
PersonOfInterest,30a006,irobeth,3,Wed Mar 25 18:22:01 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't think it matters. The reason I believe this is b/c the virus is on beth's Laptop, so after the program is moved over it wont matter if you activate it on the laptop(the program has already been moved and most likely wont be updated by Beth). The reason Finch had to do it that night is b/c he needed to activate the virus before the program got transferred. Now the only way to activate the virus is to do it at the samaritan head quarters, and I don't think root knows where that is."

PersonOfInterest,30afdg,mustard_mustache,13,Thu Mar 26 22:13:51 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting that there are several instances where Team Machine (mostly John) allows for at least the possibility for murder for people he/they deem worthy. Cura Te Ipsum ends with Reese considering killing the guy, and there is one episode where he leaves a husband and wife on a boat with a gun and hears a shot fired as he walks away.   And of course, we know the machine is ok with killing innocent people from Death Benefit."
PersonOfInterest,30afdg,MrPotatoButt,7,Thu Mar 26 00:08:33 2015 UTC,"I think Reese has never had an issue with 'bad' people hurting each other, like with that husband and wife case. He gives the wife the benefit of the doubt, because he does want to see the good in people (due to being in the dark for so many years)...but as soon as that trust is lost he really doesn't care what bad people do to one another.

PersonOfInterest,30afdg,firstmanonearth,2,Thu Mar 26 01:33:43 2015 UTC,But Finch has always been very strict about the principle of the thing. He deliberately misled Reese about Marshal Jennings to precisely avoid this sort of thing. So is Reese hiding his arrangement with Elias from his employer?

PersonOfInterest,30afdg,MrPotatoButt,6,Fri Mar 27 11:38:56 2015 UTC,"I think all the answers here haven't quite answered the OP's question.  I believe what Reese means is that Team Machine ignores Elias' various criminal underworld dealings, and would ignore Dominic too, as long as they don't go around killing people.   One, that Elias has, in fact, been ""hurting"" a number of people, and that John has essentially not been preventing it.   This is true. There is more than one way to get people to do what you want; it may involve hurting them, but it does not have to involve killing them. Elias knows this, and he is cunning and influential enough to keep people in line without putting a bullet in their skulls. This is why Team Machine leaves him be.  Dominic, however, has been shown to be even more ruthless than Elias, with complete disregard for human life. As long as he gets what he wants, he doesn't care about collateral damage. He even regards his own crew as expendable. Plus, he's trying to take Elias' place in the NY underworld, he'll have to off quite a few people to do that. Therefore, whenever Dominic shows up, people start dying, and this leads Team Machine to clamp down hard on the Brotherhood.  Reese is offering to look away from what the Brotherhood does as long as they don't kill people."
PersonOfInterest,30afdg,ZenZibbeh,1 point,Thu Mar 26 05:29:50 2015 UTC,"This makes sense to me, and is more in line with what I was asking.  But I have to think Elias has been killing people.  He says, at the end of ""Invictus"" that he intends to avenge Scarface, and also that they're going after the mid-level gang lord first.    And actually, now that I think about it, didn't one of the episodes involve three numbers that Reese got, but was too late to save?  It turned out they were connected to Dominic."
PersonOfInterest,30afdg,mustard_mustache,2,Fri Mar 27 17:48:54 2015 UTC,"Indeed he has. Dominic went on a major offensive in ""Invictus"", and Elias is now beginning to retaliate.  Perhaps that mid-level gang lord was one of those three numbers, and Team Machine would have intervened if they weren't tangling with Samaritan and friends."
PersonOfInterest,30afdg,TeMPOraL_PL,1 point,Sat Mar 28 05:43:28 2015 UTC,"here, at the core of things Elias is just a thug at heart[...]except Dominic is arrogant to a fault    Can't fix your narrow mind view.  I suspect its possible, given Elias's history, that he has never ordered a hit on a genuinely ""innocent"" victim."
PersonOfInterest,30afdg,Jethro_McCrazy,4,Wed Mar 25 20:53:30 2015 UTC,"Elias is a ""Necessary Evil""  He keeps people in check and makes sure people like Dominic don't go too far."
PersonOfInterest,30afdg,Jethro_McCrazy,1 point,Thu Mar 26 02:47:23 2015 UTC,But who makes sure that Elias doesn't go too far?  When did Team Machine decide Elias was necessary?
PersonOfInterest,30afdg,orramus,2,Wed Mar 25 22:20:44 2015 UTC,"No one (that we know of) can keep Elias in check. He's well above the law, and the Team no longer has the resources available to stop him. Even in the early days (think Baby Blue) when Reese convinced Finch they needed Elias to help solve their problem. They were easily double crossed because they had information Elias needed. I think those chess games with Finch and Reese saving him for a second time really helped to solidify their unique  'friendship', but I bet Elias would throw them under a bus if absolutely necessary."
PersonOfInterest,30afdg,orramus,4,Thu Mar 26 00:40:12 2015 UTC,"I think that by now Elias learned a few things - one of them could be that a too elaborate murder plan will almost always mean Riley showing up. And then again, maybe he doesn't kill that much anymore. He has power, influence, control. It's Dominic and his gang that try to fight their way up the power ladder.  That is of course completely orthogonal to the fact that Team Machine and Elias helped each other at times, so they have ""an understanding"".  Finally, look at it from the Dominic's point of view. His crew got their asses handed back to them by Team Machine a few times already, and at the same time the Team doesn't seem to crack down so hard on Elias (Mini probably doesn't know about the times when the Man in the Suit used to disrupt other gangs' operations). Hell, has seen Riley bodyguarding Elias himself. So from his point of view, it looks like Brotherhood is somehow singled-out by the Team. So John's answer seems basically correct - Dominic gets the attention because he keeps running around and shooting people."
PersonOfInterest,30afdg,MrPotatoButt,2,Thu Mar 26 01:55:28 2015 UTC,"This would make a lot of sense to me--Elias has learned to work the system so that he pre-meditates as few murders as possible, just planning missions that will necessarily involve collateral damage.  We have seen indications that he plans some murders, though.  And if ""Invictus"" is any indication, Elias is as secure as he appears."
PersonOfInterest,30afdg,MrPotatoButt,5,Thu Mar 26 00:50:34 2015 UTC,"They've discovered that they can't really stop Elias short of killing him. Even when they locked him up, he still ran his empire from prison. Dominic, as clever as he is, is still just a thug. Elias inspires loyalty, because he shows the same loyalty to his people as long as they don't betray him. If Dominic got locked up, he'd lose all he'd built and his people would fight for the scraps."
PersonOfInterest,30afdg,burnerthrown,-2,Fri Mar 27 17:51:19 2015 UTC,So... they're not fighting Elias because he's too powerful?  How does that figure into their resistance against Samaritan?
PersonOfInterest,30afdg,phoebeburgh,2,Thu Mar 26 01:18:15 2015 UTC,"They don't have a moral code preventing them from killing AIs. They can disable Samaritan, and once they do, the threat is over. With Elias, the only way they could really stop him is by killing him. They investigate numbers that come in, and if they get traced back to Elias, they put a stop to the activity. But imprisoned or at large, he's just as effective, so it's rather futile. And frankly, he's a lesser evil than all the other options for organized crime."
PersonOfInterest,30afdg,Tesseon,4,Thu Mar 26 01:52:58 2015 UTC,"Since Elias got out of prison, he hasn't been shown to hurt ordinary, non-criminal citizens like he did in season 1. Except for Walter, but in that case, Reese did go after him.  I also think what Reese meant by those lines was that if the people getting killed were criminals who had dealings with Elias, he wasn't going to step in unless the Machine gave them a number."
PersonOfInterest,30afdg,DesertedPenguin,0,Thu Mar 26 08:27:45 2015 UTC,"But that's my point.  When did Team Machine decide that they would only save non-criminals?  In the past, they've saved art theives, safe-crackers, con-men, and hit men.  Dominic even points out that the girl he's currently after is, technically, also a criminal.  So when did they (or the Machine) start deciding who lives and who dies?"
PersonOfInterest,30afdg,xieng5quaiViuGheceeg,6,Thu Mar 26 01:48:31 2015 UTC,"I think the ""Elias gets a pass"" doesn't mean Reese is turning a blind eye to his activities. It's more a case of ""Elias knows how to conduct his business in a way that avoids the Machine's notice"". Like I mentioned, Reese doesn't hesitate in going after Elias if Elias targets the wrong people (like Walter). Also, they did save a number of criminals this season, so obviously they haven't started playing god with their numbers.  Dominic, on the other hand, has a very limited, very antagonistic history with Reese. He probably believes Reese spends all his time keeping an eye on criminal organizations, and has a bone to pick against the Brotherhood, so he's wondering why Reese not only allows Elias to get away with his activities (which Reese might not even be aware of), but also protects him that one time!"
PersonOfInterest,30afdg,DesertedPenguin,2,Thu Mar 26 01:52:20 2015 UTC,When did Team Machine decide that they would only save non-criminals?   The Team doesn't decide it.  The Machine does.
PersonOfInterest,30afdg,DesertedPenguin,0,Thu Mar 26 03:08:37 2015 UTC,"So when did Team Machine become okay with that?  Harold's main fear has always been the Machine becoming judge, jury, and executioner.  That was his issue with the period when Samaritan was making everything perfect."
PersonOfInterest,30afdg,john_gilpin,1 point,Thu Mar 26 02:52:45 2015 UTC,"Harold is screwed.  Harold can't agonize over numbers he never gets.  And he programmed the thing anyway; he probably put in the filter to ""reject"" occupations that lead to murder as a number candidate.  Everyone else doesn't give a rats ass, for obvious reasons."
PersonOfInterest,30afdg,john_gilpin,3,Thu Mar 26 03:28:43 2015 UTC,"Couple misconceptions to clear up: The Machine tracks 'violent crimes', not just murders. A lot of them are murders, some are kidnappings, assaults, torture, what have you. Team Machine doesn't get their moral compass from The Machine, they have their own reasons for helping people. They don't do it just because the computer said to. Many times Finch and Reese disagree on whether their number deserves saving. I remember one time they stayed on a case only because there were no other numbers pending.  The Machine doesn't give the numbers of people who routinely engage in violence. The mob bosses tended not to get their hands dirty so were candidates, but their soldiers and underlings did not qualify. It's likely because the Machine realizes the pointlessness in saving such people, and also likely anyone Elias kills falls into this category. This is because Elias is the type of criminal mastermind to use nonviolent methods first over debatably more efficient methods. He prefers to leverage, extort, manipulate, steal, or threaten his way past people rather than just removing them.     Dominic is the opposite. He wants to clear the field of all possible obstacles, by eliminating them. That's his long term strategy, which makes for a lot of premeditated violence for The Machine to pick up. That's why Reese gavehim a dubious look when he proposed having the same arrangement as Elias. It just wouldn't work out, Dominic isn't the right type."
PersonOfInterest,30afdg,john_gilpin,1 point,Thu Mar 26 03:38:02 2015 UTC,"I think Elias gets a pass under the assumption that if you give a man enough rope, he's likely to hang himself with it. Elias got away enough times, and got away with enough, that John and Harold both said ""screw it, if he goes too far Samaritan/Northern Lights will take care of him"" and let him be. Elias, on the other hand, now knows he's under scrutiny from something larger than he's ever dealt with before, and is probably scaling back his operations, backing away from outright violence and just using the threat of it as his weapon.   I'll admit to underestimating Dominic and the Brotherhood on more than one occasion. Every time they show up, though, stuff gets bloody quickly, which leads me to believe that while Dominic is level-headed and calm, his underlings are trigger-happy maniacs lifted straight from Liberty City. Whether that's sloppy characterization on the part of the writers or not, the end result is that of the two gangs-- Elias' crew and the Brotherhood-- it appears that Elias' crew is the more disciplined and playing a much longer game than Domnic's."
PersonOfInterest,30afdg,CurtisManning,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:11:07 2015 UTC,"I see it more like this.  Team Machine follow the numbers. Elias knows enough about them to take a guess at the sort of crimes they go after and those crimes are generally not his thing. He has a certain code he lives by and it means he is less likely to commit the sort of crimes that catch the attention of the machine.  Dominic does not live by such a code. He is only just becoming aware of the methods and motives of the gang. He is far more likely to commit crimes that draw the attention of the Machine.  Dominic generates far more numbers than Elias does. Elias ""stays out of (John's) way"". If Dominic were to stop being so murder crazy he would too.  Even back in the pre-Elias days the gang didn't go after the mob. Their mission is to deal with numbers."

PersonOfInterest,308s2o,Kamikaze28,9,Wed Mar 25 12:03:41 2015 UTC,"It has been mentioned in the season premiere, that Samaritan constantly works to acquire & shudder every company researching Artificial Intelligence, to ensure that there is no competition for it.  A fact that was re-enforced in the second episode, where the Nautilus game was set up to eliminate another rival, in the form of the security system developed by Silver Pool, the PMC that was targeting Claire.  In Pretenders, the episode that introduced Beth Bridges, there was a map & a document in the closing scene which depicted the number  of companies it was procuring controlling interests in, as well as how it acquired Fetch & Retrieve, in Q&A. The intention, if I were to guess, would be to consolidate them, alter their code, and use it to further its own ends. Like Root mentioned, as soon as it acquired one, it could identify potential anomalies in it, and work to get around it. Or it may not have, as it still is in the dark about the 7 servers that ignores the identities of the team. Even though Shaw's is blown, I'm inclined to think it's none the wiser, cause she won't break easy.  Rather than starting from scratch, it's easier to do it with something that already has a foundation. I still do consider the possibility that it has set up shell corporations on the side to develop more programs to improve itself. Figured that was one possibility of Episode 21, given its original title was ""Black Site"" (has since been changed to ""Asylum"").  To sum up, all I can say is we don't know exactly how this'll play out, especially when you factor in the possibility that Root faked destroying the Trojan activator, and intends to put it to use on her project with Caleb. Think by the time the finale rolls around, there'll be some resolution."
PersonOfInterest,308s2o,EThorns,2,Wed Mar 25 13:30:10 2015 UTC,"I think you misunderstood my OP. It is reasonable for Samaritan to acquire existing companies as a means to an end, be it to further its own surveillance capabilities or as a part of some other plan as well as preventing competing systems from ever existing.  What I find disturbing is Samaritan taking an interest in Beth's algorithms. No algorithm that a human can conceive should be interesting to Samaritan, it should be able to create an even better algorithm if it wanted or needed to if it were a true ASI."
PersonOfInterest,308s2o,EThorns,3,Wed Mar 25 13:52:23 2015 UTC,"Greer mentioned that it was pretty interested in Beth's work, but he has no idea why. And we may never know.  Like I said, if it were to see potential in something, even if it wasn't perfect, it could acquire it & tweak it to suit its needs. Fetch & Retrieve's VAL is a perfect example of that. Simulating & Manipulating emotions. Samaritan was probably going all, ""Why didn't I think of that?""  And in no way, am I discounting the possibility that it isn't developing stuff of its own. Jonah & Greg have mentioned that they intend to explore the possibility of an AI ecosystem, so Samaritan constructing its own offsprings to accumulate it is a potentially strong storyline possibility in latter seasons."
PersonOfInterest,308s2o,MontegoBarbados,2,Wed Mar 25 14:26:45 2015 UTC,"You're applying a human framework to a distinctly non-human entity. Samaritan has so much computing power that it can do a lot of things at once. It runs all those schools, including the tablets while coordinating all of its other operations, tracking deviants all over the globe, conducting its little research projects like Maple and on and on and on. Buying other companies because it is ""easier"" is not a very plausible argument in this context."
PersonOfInterest,308s2o,EThorns,1 point,Wed Mar 25 17:05:08 2015 UTC,"Greer mentioned that it was pretty interested in Beth's work, but he has no idea why.   I assumed that Samaritan's newfound interest in Beth's algorithm was due to Harold's addition to it. The timing supports this.  Harold kept his Trojan dormant to avoid outright detection, but it may have still piqued Samaritan's interest."
PersonOfInterest,308s2o,whitewater2,0,Thu Mar 26 09:17:15 2015 UTC,"And if it was launched before Harold activated it, it would've been wasted opportunity. If was active, SAM would've noticed an anomaly & traced it right back to him."
PersonOfInterest,308s2o,whitewater2,2,Thu Mar 26 09:27:09 2015 UTC,"First off, I really like your OP.  But I also agree with EThorns; eliminate any competition. I also agree that Samaritan is probably capable of creating such algorithms and other features but why bother when someone has already perfected it. Samaritans focus is on other tasks and these companies have been perfecting the algorithms for years, why not snatch it up and tweak it?  Samaritan needed to get authorized access to the government feeds appropriately, rather than backdoor it. So it appears to be somewhat consistent with the learning/adjusting mechanism rather than just truly taking over without Greer (or whoevers) input to it. I think it guides them to say ""hey, I want this algorithim because its perfect without me needed to create and run sims from scratch.""  Much like Google/Apple do in the real world. They will buy up companies that have perfected what their goals were.  I am not comparing Google/Apple to a true ASI just a real world observation. They can easily build whatever they want, but easier to buy up a company that is 90% of what they are trying to do."
PersonOfInterest,308s2o,burnerthrown,1 point,Wed Mar 25 16:13:23 2015 UTC,"Samaritan is probably capable of creating such algorithms and other features but why bother when someone has already perfected it   Because whatever humans regard as ""perfected"", Samaritan can improve by several orders of magnitude. It can find solutions to problems we don't even fully understand yet, as evidenced by Claire's explanation to Harold regarding world hunger and socio-economic problems."
PersonOfInterest,308s2o,burnerthrown,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:07:30 2015 UTC,"I think that was my point (and also your point). That it looked at their algorithm and said ""i can make this better but the foundation is there for me to utilize""   I still think Samaritan has some type of boundaries, otherwise it would not have needed permission for the government feeds, it would have just got them. Getting permission and playing nice with the GOV seems to be an objective for it (they).   Plus, who is funding Samaritan? Who is paying the rent for their operations HQ? Who paying the operatives? No one works for free."
PersonOfInterest,308s2o,SafferCrystal,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:53:05 2015 UTC,"I think that was my point (and also your point). That it looked at their algorithm and said ""i can make this better but the foundation is there for me to utilize""   I'd say that Samaritan doesn't even need a look to come up with a better algorithm, I just asked the related question in the OP as an alternative to internalize human-written and potentially faulty/malicious code.  An algorithm is not like a company with useful assets, it comes down to a logical construction of computer instructions based on one or more ideas of how to solve a particular problem. And when it comes to generating ideas, Samaritan beats a human every day of the week.   I still think Samaritan has some type of boundaries, otherwise it would not have needed permission for the government feeds, it would have just got them. Getting permission and playing nice with the GOV seems to be an objective for it (they).   Getting legitimate access to the government feeds was not Samaritans choice or idea but Greer's. There is nothing to suggest that Samaritan couldn't have accessed those feeds if things went differently but for some reason Greer was convinced that they needed the feeds to awaken Samaritan. I'd say that, looking at its current situation now, Samaritan has found its relationship to the U. S. government to be useful and beneficial. Remember Control-Alt-Delete where Control painfully realized that Greer/Samaritan has them in their pocket and not the other way around.  On Samaritan's restrictions: I don't see why it should have any restrictions. Claypool never mentioned anything along those lines and Greer and company certainly didn't hinder their god after all the effort they put into bringing it to life.   Plus, who is funding Samaritan? Who is paying the rent for their operations HQ? Who paying the operatives? No one works for free.   That is actually a very interesting question. During season 2, Greer has often spoken of his employers, yet we have never seen them. In Greer's case, however, I would argue that he is so devoted to the cause that he doesn't need a payment as an incentive. Also, now that he views Samaritan as his direct superior, whoever his prior employers were, they're probably out of the picture by now."
PersonOfInterest,308s2o,autowikibot,2,Wed Mar 25 19:33:53 2015 UTC,"Firstly, Artificial Intelligences can't conceive of ideas at all; They can only make logical resolutions given the known factors as they are made aware of them. Samaritan has no idea about what capabilities it doesn't have, because it can't imagine itself doing anything outside it's capabilities. That's why it's acquiring others' algorithms. It will probably rewrite anything it integrates eventually but they still have to be integrated first.    Secondly, Samaritan was never competed. This is the reason Decima is pulling tech experts all over the place to support it: Samaritan was never brought to full working state, like The Machine was. The former was an unfinished product developed by one man in his spare time, the latter was developed as a full time project, to completion, by a man with the support of a large tech corporation, and the support of the US Govt. Harold had The Machine as a complete, self contained package before he shipped it off for activation. Samaritan was just a brain with no head or body when Decima got hold of it."
PersonOfInterest,308s2o,man_in_the_suit,1 point,Thu Mar 26 19:32:42 2015 UTC,"They can only make logical resolutions given the known factors as they are made aware of them.   And what would you call that? ""Having an idea"" is a fancy way of saying ""coming up with a solution to a problem"". Human's oftentimes lack the ability to explain why they got an idea or how they got it but an ASI would not have these problems. It would be perfectly rational in all of its actions, albeit on a level beyond human comprehension.   Samaritan has no idea about what capabilities it doesn't have, because it can't imagine itself doing anything outside it's capabilities.   I'd argue that a self-aware ASI can very well conceive of its own limitations, weaknesses and shortcomings, even better than humans can because of their perfect rationality, see above.   Secondly, Samaritan was never competed.   That's a somewhat valid point. I would, however, reply that Samaritan has the capability of self-improvement, thereby quickly fixing any shortcomings Claypool may have overlooked.  I know it is hard to imagine a being which is perfectly aware of how it works because we don't fully understand how the human body (and especially the brain) works. An ASI would understand everything about itself and could improve itself, at leasts on the software side. Hardware improvements would require some sort of human lackeys or robots. I'd prefer robots."
PersonOfInterest,308s2o,whitewater2,1 point,Thu Mar 26 19:53:52 2015 UTC,"Having an idea is conceiving of factors that don't exist in a hypothetical, theoretical sense to envision a situation that could be created through effort. Machines don't work that way. Even when crafting hypotheticals, they work from the existing factors forward. Fabricating new factors out of whole cloth is not a machine capability.    Samaritan would be very aware of it's limitations, but not beyond that. Similar to the above, it would see the problems, but not the solutions, if they were unattainable given the current assets.    This is why Samaritan requires humans to implement computational theory to fabricate solutions to it's limitations that it cannot address itself, by adding new capabilities and enabling new logics.    That also sounded like a really good line on a resume."

PersonOfInterest,308s2o,Afalstein,3,Thu Mar 26 21:33:48 2015 UTC,"You overestimate Samaritan's capabilities. It doesn't have unlimited processing capabilities, and seems to rely a lot on brute force computing power in place of efficiency. As shown in If-Then-Else, running simulations takes time and computing cycles. The more variables you throw in, the more complex the simulation becomes. Simulation accuracy requires even more work. Samaritan is probably not yet at the state to devote power into continually improving itself, so it hires coders and buys algorithms instead.  More importantly, the Machine and Samaritan need data in order to accurately predict events. That's what Samaritan turned Maple into its own experimental ant farm. It used the town as a way to study human behavior, to see how people would react given certain stimuli. Without data to analyze, it cannot fine tune the accuracy of its modeling.  I don't believe Samaritan or the Machine have reached the point of technological singularity yet, but they may be getting close."

Finding a capable software engineer Contacting and contracting him/her to do some work without him/her learning too much details Having the unwitting accomplice disposed of via Control   When it would make more sense for Samaritan (in my understanding of ASI capabilities) to just do the work itself and not risk exposure.

PersonOfInterest,3071iq,Gimli_the_White,7,Wed Mar 25 06:55:09 2015 UTC,"Person of Interest is a showpiece for gender equality. There are plenty of very strong female characters, but it's never about ""she's a woman detective"" or ""she's a hitman that's a woman. A hitman-woman"" - they're just ""detective"" or ""Shaw""  The best part is that people are still able to have social gender norms - men are men, women are women, and small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri are small furry creatures from Alpha Centauri. Carter could be sexy if she wanted. Zoe's job requires her to be sexy, no apologies. Shaw can be sexy if she wants, but she's not fond of doing it. And Shaw steals mascara.   The shootout between Martine and Shaw was the epitome of ""Yeah, they're both women - so?"""
PersonOfInterest,3071iq,Serav_,14,Tue Mar 31 00:41:54 2015 UTC,"I noticed this while reading a recap of an episode a few months ago on IO9. In it the show was praised for how it included capable women, which struck me as odd because if anything the show has had a dearth of capable men. Meanwhile at least 50% of the female characters are world class at fighting and/or social engineering :-/.  There's only four non-evil competent male characters left on the show; Fusco, Harold, Reese and Elias. And of those Reese is the only trained fighter and he's spent the last few episodes getting sucker punched by women of the week. This week he was even knocked out by a random goon! I feel like I'm watching Worf in TNG. Meanwhile a new female replacement for Shaw is introduced practically every episode.  Don't take this as me saying I don't like the show. On the contrary it's writing, characters, character development, and technical accuracy are all superb, and I can overlook its flaws the same way I can overlook those of shows where every female character is a damsel in distress. But it's definitely overcompensating for the traditional gender stereotypes, and right now it's doing so at the expense of one of my favourite characters; Reese."

PersonOfInterest,3071iq,SavannahNix,20,Wed Mar 25 03:19:43 2015 UTC,"A veritable Book of Revelations, this one.  I can't believe that Finch's plan to put a bug in Samaritan comes to so little.  No, seriously.  I can't believe it.  I don't believe it.  I think Root plans to activate the Trojan Hose later, in some way can't easily be traced back to Professor Whistler.  I don't know if I believe that Iris's plotline is just to be in love with Reese.  I still feel like there's something more going on with her than just being Reese's love interest.  Then again, what does she mean that she's afraid of him?  Does she mean that she's afraid of how she feels about him, or that she is indeed frightened of what he might do to her or others?  Harper's getting texts from Thornhill?!?!  I'd swear she was lying, except how could she?  There's no way she could know enough to lie about that, right?  So the Machine is messaging her?  Sending her high-value scams?  To what end??"
PersonOfInterest,3071iq,pensee_idee,7,Wed Mar 25 04:39:59 2015 UTC,Thank you for saying that about Finch's Trojan Horse. I don't want to think that whole set up was a waste.
PersonOfInterest,3071iq,m1tt,7,Wed Mar 25 03:37:34 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be really annoyed if it is.  I just can't see Root truly accepting leaving the Trojan Horse inert forever.    It might be too risky to be worth using right now, but surely there may come a time when either the risk is reduced for some reason, or the situation is so desperate that even such a risky maneuver is better than doing nothing.  And if that happens, I'm sure Root would want to have the option to use it, rather than not having the option."
PersonOfInterest,3071iq,pensee_idee,7,Wed Mar 25 04:34:30 2015 UTC,I think Roots app might be some kind of replacement for the Finch's Trojan. I cant really remember all that much about it though.
PersonOfInterest,3071iq,besirk,27,Wed Mar 25 06:31:50 2015 UTC,"Maybe there's some way to use Caleb's compression algorithm along with the Trojan Horse.  Finch thought that he'd only be able to get a little data out before Samaritan shut it down - but with a compression algorithm that lets you put the entire Library of Congress on one thumbdrive, maybe they could get enough of Samaritan's source code to write a real virus."

PersonOfInterest,3071iq,InadequateUsername,3,Wed Mar 25 06:28:47 2015 UTC,I'm starting to think all of the setbacks for the team are intentional.

PersonOfInterest,3071iq,pensee_idee,2,Wed Mar 25 13:18:27 2015 UTC,"You'd think Samaritan would know whether or not the lady(cant recall her name) had falsified her data or not. Regardless though, if it knew her algorithm was legit it wouldn't care about a single prof from another university."
PersonOfInterest,3071iq,InadequateUsername,3,Thu Mar 26 04:09:48 2015 UTC,"I think Root was afraid that if Samaritan detected the now-active Trojan Horse before plugging the laptop into itself, that it would also be able to notice that the Trojan became active while Beth was having dinner with Dr. Whistler.  If Samaritan didn't detect the Trojan until after the laptop was plugged in, there wasn't going to be a problem.  Root was just terrified that it would be able to tell that the program was there even before plugging the laptop in.  To be fair, Finch was afraid of that too, which is why he was keeping the Trojan inactive until the last minute.  Root was just afraid that by activating it at the last minute, it would be too obvious that he was there when it turned on.  Between this episode and the one with Claire Mahoney, I don't think I've seen Finch look so defeated or so weak before."
PersonOfInterest,3071iq,pensee_idee,4,Wed Mar 25 13:14:05 2015 UTC,"I know it's grasping at straws now, but he could've just placed a time delay on it's activation."

PersonOfInterest,3071iq,ariyahvansh,9,Wed Mar 25 04:29:07 2015 UTC,"I liked the episode but it felt like it didn't reach full speed. Or maybe it was because the tone and type of action were so different in the 2 story lines (and I was waiting to get back to Root and Harold). Of course the season is nearing it's end so I'm expecting more and more. But I did like it.  The bounty hunter / avenging sister story was entertaining in a fun lightweight action kind of way. I liked this episode's version of beautiful and dangerous chick. Could be I've just been desensitized by the number of ladies this season fitting that description. Or not, because the other one - Harper – I was more annoyed by than before (and I'm not thrilled that evidently she'll be a recurring character, she's just so cardboard). The other weakest part about that SL was that first it was strange that the blonde's fake identity held up to Harold's check (I'd assume he'd be thorough in compiling the initial information) and then if the bounty hunter part was fake, where did the skills come from, but eh whatever I'm sure it can be explained away and the SL was fun.  Reese and the doc I'm not thrilled about but mostly I don't really care. Considering that this is the 4th season and Reese has been connected to very few ladies on-screen (incl. flashbacks) it's something that's not been overdone. Though to me there was no chemistry between them (but not every onscreen couple can come across as having chemistry anyway).  The bounty hunter SL was fun and the doc struggling with the attraction that doesn't conform to rulebooks had a hint of rom-com, but the best part of the episode involved Root and Harold.  First of all, Harold is really hard-core about not knowingly/deliberately “sacrificing” anyone or causing someone's death (since I suspect even “a nobody” would have prompted the same reaction). That was in character of course but still. The scenes between Root and Harold were once again charged. Only thing that felt off in that SL was when Root said (when talking about causing a friend death) that she was the one who had asked Shaw to help them “that day”. Like since when did Shaw need to be asked to join in on the action (more like she'd have to chained to a locomotive to stay out of it), so that was just jarring. I guess the pretty please could be a thing between Root and Shaw but then neither would take that seriously.  It was interesting to see how important Harold is to Root (and what the Machine's priorities are). I suppose Root's admiration of Harold has been obvious from the start but now it's not only official but more emotional.   The best part was Root and Harold in the subway. The ending seemed to hint at the possibility that Root didn't destroy the dongle and is planning to use it herself, so hopefully her identities will switch fast enough if she does that. But there was a sense of doom that belies that. Root's and Harold's conversation then and how it was framed – in the beginning Root behind the computers in the middle of the tableau, somehow that seemed sacrificial to me once she stood up, with the almost halo and the almost cross imagery. Well, hopefully that's stretching it and is occurring to me because I am getting more worried for Root now that the season ending is nearing. Or Root being behind the computers at the subway could be a first taste of Root taking over those tasks, except I can't believe Harold is really in danger. But hopefully such contemplations are because of the paranoia due to the approaching season finale :P  But to end things on a positive note - the cutest moment was the way Harold said „Bye!” to Beth at the phone (after the „pick you up at 8”) :)."
PersonOfInterest,3071iq,eikeegimuu,5,Wed Mar 25 02:51:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with pretty much everything that you wrote. I just want to add on to one part of your post:    Only thing that felt off in that SL was when Root said (when talking about causing a friend death) that she was the one who had asked Shaw to help them “that day”. Like since when did Shaw need to be asked to join in on the action (more like she'd have to chained to a locomotive to stay out of it), so that was just jarring.   Yeah. Root didn't even ask Shaw to come and help them that day. She only wanted Shaw to get the code that would bypass that biometric palm-scanner so that they could get into the server room. When Shaw asked if Root was inviting her to join them at the stock exchange, Root actually replied, ""Not a chance. The place will be crawling with Samaritan operatives and you're number one on their list."" She was surprised when Shaw arrived.   So yes, Root's line about having been the one to request that Shaw come to their aid was inaccurate. But I think that we can attribute it to Root experiencing survivor's guilt. Root was fully prepared to die at the stock exchange to save millions of lives by preventing wars and famines. This would have given her the good end that she felt would be a privilege for her to have (as per her conversation with Finch in ""Prophets""). She was not, however, prepared to watch someone she loved die (well, ""die"") in her stead."
PersonOfInterest,3071iq,celaenos,2,Wed Mar 25 19:33:06 2015 UTC,"That's right, I didn't even think of that - specifically on that occasion Root even explicitly told Shaw to stay away. Survivors guilt is for sure happening, though I assumed that Root ended up saying that for a Shoot by proxy moment. But it indeed could also have been to highlight Root's survivor's guilt."

(my heart can't take her just popping in and out anymore. i hope we start getting more consistant Root.) all the stuff with her and Harold in this episode was fantastic. i love their dynamic so much. i love how desperate Root is since she lost Shaw. she can't handle losing anyone else important to her. and i love that Harold really acknowledged that she is part of the team and their friends. BUT i hate (though understand) him telling her he doesn't want to see her for a while. that is the last thing she needs. she needs Harold and Reese around to help stop her from going on suicide missions by herself. ughh, when is Sarah gonna come back? her twins have got to be self sufficient by now right? they're at least 2 weeks old:)  i think Root is gonna execute Harold's plan herself. her odd little facial expression, and saying ""professor whistler"" can't do it make me think she will try somehow. maybe with her side thing with Caleb somehow? idk yet. and i'm worried for her a lot. (always. but STILL.)  loved Frankie. and i still like Harper too. i hope they don't bring one of them on permanently, but instead kinda keep a few semi recurring other ladies to fill in until Shaw is back.

A couple problems I have are...  -Why couldn't Root just destroy the hard drive or corrupt it somehow so the algorithm was useless?  -Why didn't Root think of setting up the fake email from Finch instead of resorting to murder?  -And Harold's attempted suicide felt so forced and out of character it wasn't even funny   ALSO, when did the special effects team replace blanks for CGI muzzle flashes?

PersonOfInterest,3071iq,ab_emery,22,Thu Mar 26 01:56:21 2015 UTC,"-Why didn't Root think of setting up the fake email from Finch instead of resorting to murder?   Because they accomplish different things.  Murdering her lets the Trojan get to Samaritan without her being able to identify Finch.  The email keeps Finch away, so he can't activate the Trojan, so she never will have to identify finch.  Finch was willing to murder himself to get the Trojan in while keeping her alive.  But the email is a third solution, it sacrifices the trojan to keep her and Finch alive."
PersonOfInterest,3071iq,AScaryMoose,6,Wed Mar 25 03:11:23 2015 UTC,"You have good points, but I feel I can perhaps give some reasoning to some of them:  With something of that importance, Beth should have many backups of the contents of the hard drive. Root would not be able to simply destroy one and end it.  Murder seems like a simpler solution to Root by ""nature"" than anything else due to her habits. Perhaps she saw more fun in it and was less willing to find alternate solutions?  Yeah... I don't know about this one. Perhaps there is a bit of depression in there... Somehow he felt the most drastic approach was the simplest and would prove his point, plus make Root do as he wanted.  The shootout scene's CGI might relate to it being in a confined area (echoing), so blanks could have been dangerous to the ears. There could have been many ways to solve this production-wise, but perhaps the cheapest was CGI?"
PersonOfInterest,3071iq,hello2ulol,3,Wed Mar 25 06:08:14 2015 UTC,"Why didn't Root think of setting up the fake email from Finch instead of resorting to murder?   Root's still a wild card, so I don't think there's anything definitive here, but the MO of murder was her choice (and the Machine disagreed with it).  I think she wants to get back at anyone tied to Samaritan (following what we saw from Finch in the Karma flashbacks).  And it could just be the way she copes.  In the gunfight with the ISA (Control-Alt-Delete), she said, ""I think this is good for me!""   And Harold's attempted suicide felt so forced and out of character it wasn't even funny   I don't see how this was out of character; Finch hates being responsible in any way for someone's death.  In Q&A, he was willing to have Claire kill him rather than give her anything on his friends.  And in Deus Ex Machina, he offered his life to Collier in exchange for everyone else at the trial: ""If your revolution requires blood, take mine."""

This could be possible but I doubt it. I think it's likely Root still has the trigger to activate the Trojan Horse and it will probably tie in with the project with Caleb Phipps.   -Why couldn't Root just destroy the hard drive or corrupt it somehow so the algorithm was useless?   Because it was never about destroying the algorithm. Root's intention was to keep Harold from getting close enough to Beth so that he could trigger the Trojan horse. This would have most likely blown his cover identity and had him killed.   -And Harold's attempted suicide felt so forced and out of character it wasn't even funny    Suicide? I guess you can call it that. Although, it was more of a bluff with incredibly high stakes. He practically did the same thing in Last Call where he threatened to electrocute everyone if the Hitman killed the Dispatcher. It's already been established that Harold is willing to sacrifice his own life if it means it will save someone elses. Why do you think he confessed at the kangaroo court back in Season 3?

PersonOfInterest,3071iq,WomanWhoWeaves,2,Wed Mar 25 15:28:42 2015 UTC,"Root is kind of off balance right now with the whole Shaw thing, though."

PersonOfInterest,3071iq,mrhashbrown,11,Wed Mar 25 14:52:00 2015 UTC,Hmm.  I strangely do not object to John kissing his therapist.  I LOVED the blond VIKING.  And Harper Rose was interesting.  And Root and her love of Harold.  OMG!!!
PersonOfInterest,3071iq,JackBauerTFM,15,Wed Mar 25 03:00:46 2015 UTC,"I dont really mind the John/Ginger thing but that whole scene was extremly corny if you ask me. Iv seen that whole ""i cant because il loose my job and its unethical... oh screw it...""  thing way to many times."
PersonOfInterest,3071iq,mrhashbrown,11,Wed Mar 25 03:10:29 2015 UTC,"The problem is that she herself has no personality. We know her as a therapist who kind of has a tight-knit personality and can read John like paper.  I can't blame the show for not being able to fit in time to flesh her character out since they don't spend much time within the NYPD anyway, but it's still a foolish storyline for the writers to chase. Unless there's a big twist incoming with her that ties into the bigger picture of the Machine/Samaritan, I doubt she's sticking around beyond this season."

I hope that doesn't mean Root won't appear much in the following episodes. I need Amy Acker in my life!  In all seriousness though, it's amazing how far Root has come in character development. She kidnapped Harold when they first met and now she is willing to do anything to keep him safe and alive. Now I wonder if she actually just kept that activation device for herself..."

I understand why they have to do something with Reese's character because his back story is dried out and he can't offer any technical expertise when it comes to fighting Samaritan. But the way they build it up, doesn't feel natural.   I don't think she's a Samaritan or Brotherhood operative. Its too obvious. I like the theory given by pensee_idee. What if she's a relative of some cop whom Reese killed or turned into a quadriplegic? She's trying to draw him in completely and then finally make him suffer. I just hope she's not Detective Stills/Marshal Jennings sister :P (Feel free to add any more significant cop characters who picked a bone with Reese).  It will be too terrible for John."

With that hug at the end, they strike me as having a brother-sister type relationship; Reese being the older, wiser one and Frankie being the younger spirited, wild type. Also, isn't it feasible that as soon as Finch would have activated the program, Samaritan would not only traced it back to him but also to Elizabeth? She probably would have been taken out too. Root has almost definitely NOT destroyed that device. The Machine wouldn't have sent Harold on that secret mission and got so tantalisingly close to throwing back a punch for it to just go to waste. Amy Acker was terrific as usual. Actually the Season 3 just premièred in the UK a few days ago. I forgot how terrifying Root in therapy can be. It's amazing how much her character has evolved.

PersonOfInterest,305owc,Anti_pasto,3,Tue Mar 24 21:03:38 2015 UTC,"Root didn't run away as a teen. She witnessed as a 12 y/o her friend getting into the killer's car and then some 2 years later arranged via some hacking the pedophile getting killed. But Root stayed (or at least presumably came back frequently enough) until her mother's death some 10 years later (as she left ca ten years ago as of when Reese and Carter were looking for her but found Hanna).  And that's all from Root's past – nothing besides that childhood/teenager flashback has been shown and she hasn't made statements about past relationships only about her um …. career as a killer for hire. So who knows what else is there.  For one - considering the flashback had someone say that Root's mother wasn't well, I'd be interested to know what that meant. It's anyway an interesting parallel with Harold, whose father wasn't well either. Since Harold's father had a (in the broadest sense) mental problem, I think it's likelier that it was something else with Root's mother. Besides, bad code could be shorthand physical failings as well, so it'd be double whammy – loosing somebody either by the shortcomings in other's code or in their own."
PersonOfInterest,305owc,eikeegimuu,0,Tue Mar 24 21:09:59 2015 UTC,"Not exactly an assassin for hire per se, from what it is known she was a more like a ruthless fixer, who didn't mind killing people to get the job done.  She was more like an hardcore version of Zoe."

In Root Cause she is the one who was paid to kill the candidate and she framed the number for it. And we learned that she was paid to kill the co-workers of the guy in Root Path (/), Cyrus, back in 2009. She felt guilty about that when she realized she had killed his friends who were his business associates. I think they even mentioned how many millions she was paid for that crime."

""Fixer"" A person who makes arrangements for other people, especially of an illicit or devious kind.   Yes, Root referred to herself as an assassin for hire on the show, but as I said in another reply, it's putting it lightly, her job was more complicated than that. As we have seen in the episode ""Root Cause"". In that episode, her job wasn't to kill the person of interest, her job was making him a scapegoat, even if the plan ended with killing him, she wasn't hired to kill him.  As for the wiki, you  can't always take what's written on it as canon. The information there is provided by fans who watch the show. Although there's discussion about certain parts of the information on it, especially if it is controversial, you don't have the show runners vetting that information. It isn't 100% correct.  In fact, I have written a significant portion of Root's page, especially parts concerning last season. When revising the article I decided to leave assassin there. But I also added fixer and hacker."
PersonOfInterest,305owc,bootkiller,1 point,Wed Mar 25 03:25:42 2015 UTC,"Whatever. Yes, I am aware that it is written by fans/viewers, and, I guess, you. Congratulations. I am also going by the evidence of what I saw on screen and the words out of Root's own mouth. Show me canon where she says ""I was a fixer"" instead of ""hired assassin."" Show me where the show runners describe her that way.  No, her job was not to kill the person of interest. Her job was to have the candidate killed and she set the number up as the killer. When that didn't work, she killed the person who hired her.  Split hairs if you want, but being paid to find someone to kill a person is pretty close to being paid to kill them yourself.  I like Root but she was never a paragon of virtue. If she hadn't been paid to kill people or to ""fix"" things so that people ended up dead, would she have been cold enough to kill Corwin and Weeks? Would the Machine have worked so hard to reform her and not allow her to kill the shrink and Hersch?"
PersonOfInterest,305owc,SavannahNix,1 point,Wed Mar 25 03:19:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not here pointing out one or other aspect of Root's virtues, if she is good or bad. The truth is that she something in the middle, like all of us. One single action doesn't make one person good or or bad.  I'm not really pulling out my hair, I'm just trying to make a compelling case as to why perhaps calling Root a simple assassin for hire might not be the best word to describe what she did in past from the very little information we know.  I really fail to understand why people seem to straight out dismiss my argument with hostility and downvotes, but that the internet."
PersonOfInterest,305owc,bootkiller,1 point,Wed Mar 25 04:05:04 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the down votes, but since the discussion came up as an answer to a question, it seems that calling her a fixer downplays the concept that she was a murderer. She is nothing like Zoe, who the show does identify as a fixer. I never said she was a simple assassin either. It was never one single action that defined her."
PersonOfInterest,305owc,SavannahNix,4,Wed Mar 25 04:22:02 2015 UTC,"Root was loner who basically was a hit woman for hire. At about 12, she wasn't believed when her best friend was kidnapped by a pedophile, even though she saw her friend get into his car. Later, she ran away from home and managed to manipulate things in such a way that the pedophile was murdered, then she went on to kill for money. She was also a brilliant hacker. She figured out that the Machine existed and kidnapped Finch twice to get him to lead her to it so she could ""free"" it. To find Finch, she posed as a pyschiatrist who had someone out to kill her, thus setting herself up as a number that Reese and Finch tried to help. To escape those who were supposedly trying to kill her, Reese sent her to where Finch was waiting in his car. Alicia Corwin had finally tracked Finch down and was sitting in the passenger seat talking to him. Root walked up and shot her in the head, then climbed into the car, pointing her gun at Finch, saying, ""I thought she'd never shut up,"" then forced him at gunpoint to accompany her. She felt people were ""bad code"" who deserved no compassion or mercy. When it was discovered that the Machine had managed to have itself moved to an unknown location, Root became catatonic and Reese and Finch left her in a mental hospital. Eventually, through her being able to communicate with the Machine, she escaped, but the Machine wouldn't let her kill people any more. Like Reese, Finch, Fusco and Shaw, Root set out on a path to redemption and her help was eventually accepted by the team.  She never felt the need for a partner or spouse or had feelings for others until she net Shaw."

It was so good that I got caught up in two weeks flat (""MIA"" was the first episode that I watched live). Then, about a week ago, I joined this subreddit and looked through some old posts. The users here have made me love the show even more, as they've noticed a number of details that I missed during my initial episode viewings. For instance, someone pointed out that the binary code in the season 2 finale translated to ""Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"" (""Who will guard the guards?"") Another user decoded the Morse code from 3x12 to inform us of how the Machine helped Root overcome Control and ultimately escape. The redditors here are so intelligent, and so is this show. I am constantly amazed by POI's meticulousness, layered characters, questions on morality and exciting plotlines.   This show is fucking phenomenal."

PersonOfInterest,301fxe,EThorns,1 point,Tue Mar 24 05:58:57 2015 UTC,This is my favorite show too. It's so underrated.
PersonOfInterest,2ztvk9,EThorns,5,Sat Mar 21 18:53:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know which one sounds better. Black Site or Asylum, but both of them I wouldn't mind as a title."
PersonOfInterest,2ztvk9,Samachinatin,6,Sat Mar 21 19:24:44 2015 UTC,I think Black Site was better tbh. Sounded really dangerous and vague - Asylum isn't as mysterious.
PersonOfInterest,2ztvk9,man_in_the_suit,2,Sat Mar 21 19:36:40 2015 UTC,"While Black Site is more dangerous sounding, Asylum is still rather vague, and is more mysterious in my opinion, since the crew regularly deals with stuff like black sites, while asylums are something else. We see Root get temporarily institutionalized in Season 3, but beyond that it's something different from what they usually deal with."
PersonOfInterest,2ztvk9,xAgonistx,7,Sat Mar 21 23:15:14 2015 UTC,"Consider the possibility that each title could be more related to the other than is first apparent... Asylum is also that which a person who cannot stay in their home country seeks. In high risk cases, secret locations and cover identities may be involved. I wonder who needs hidden, and where..."
PersonOfInterest,2ztvk9,shinsaikou,2,Sun Mar 22 00:03:51 2015 UTC,Good point. I'm hopeful it will tie in with Root's/The Machine's plan of recruiting people.
PersonOfInterest,2ztvk9,xAgonistx,2,Sun Mar 22 00:08:09 2015 UTC,I wonder if all their covers are blown in some way and must seek asylum. With Samaritan being a global force perhaps they would need to go deep underground. Elias might be someone who could help in which case...assuming he's still around.
PersonOfInterest,2ztvk9,mustard_mustache,3,Sun Mar 22 01:52:48 2015 UTC,"Thinking back on everything that's happened, I am a bit surprised that Fusco hasn't been tagged deviant by Samaritan. What does this have to with the price of tea in China, you ask? He's crossed Martine more than a few times in connection with Team Machine - which I think includes at the NYSE (I don't remember if they actually saw each other in the true scenario). I wonder if Fusco will get his yellow box finally, or if he will be forced into one of those ""I want to help them, but if I do I'm screwed"" type situations.   Bottom line, if the Team is forced underground - to seek assylum from the all-seeing, never-had-morals-to-begin-with Samaritan, I wonder if we'll be ordering service for 3 or service for 4.   Consider also what's been mentioned elsewhere, it might not be The Team at all that needs Asylum. It could be a person who is crucial to shutting Samaritan down. I don't want to start talking about ""recruitment,"" because that's just a euphemism for replacing Shaw. But damn, Shahi is out for TWO YEARS... if there's even a show for her to come back to at that point..."
PersonOfInterest,2ztvk9,shinsaikou,2,Sun Mar 22 09:31:23 2015 UTC,"But damn, Shahi is out for TWO YEARS   I'm surprised if that's so, since shouldn't they kill the character off if it was so?"

Instead she says she'll be back when she feels she's ready to return and isn't doing her children a disservice by working on the show. Plageman and Nolan also have faith that ""Person of Interest"" will still be around when she is ready to return -- and think Shahi will probably be back sooner rather than later.   We can only hope."
PersonOfInterest,2ztvk9,shinsaikou,1 point,Sun Mar 22 12:23:52 2015 UTC,"She has said as much in interviews. That she wanted at least 2 years off but would like the door open to return. The producers have even said as much. There is no gaurantee that she would come back, or if she did that it would be as main cast - or if it would only be a flashback, etc. Everyone would like her to return, which is why we have the situation we have with her uncertain status in Samaritan's custody. It could be a smokescreen, but it's more believable that she just wants to be a Mom for a few years and see where she's at after that much time passes. You DO know she had twins, right..?"

PersonOfInterest,2ztvk9,ChipotleSkittles,3,Sun Mar 22 18:43:44 2015 UTC,"You'd be shocked at how strict they can be over the smallest of things.    I work on a lot of commercials where even the title of the product should be kept secret.  You'd think with advertising that they would love to have their products name out there as much as possible.  But they don't want you mentioning anything.    I think it is all about control of information.  That it isn't your place to be sharing something first and the message not coming out the way they want it to.    I feel like in the case of a title of an episode, maybe they have have a press release for a block of episodes that are all grouped together.  Take for example if ""If Then Else""'s title had been leaked early when they had planned on releasing the episodic trilogy's names with a promo.  People could start speculating about what the episode is going to be like.  Then when they air the promo, it might not have as profound of an effect than if it was their first time hearing about it.  As in they might think ""oh ok, cool, it is going to be about this"", instead of the ""holy shit, fucking shit is about to go down!""  The latter reaction is going to produce a lot more buzz about the show, and therefore more views and more revenue.    Now I have no idea how the POI/CBS executive team want to handle something like episode titles.  This was more as a very real situation I could see happening with the entertainment industry.    I think it also comes from how it is only very recent that executives and promo teams are getting their control of information being taken away from them.  It was only after facebook and what not came out that the concept of ""spoilers"" came about.  Before that it was just not wanting to find out what happened.  I think social media is a double edged sword that a surprisingly less than nimble industry is trying to learn how to use.  I can see how it can be frightening; therefore forcing people to be absolutely silent per the terms of their employment."
PersonOfInterest,2ztvk9,ThatFag,-3,Sun Mar 22 19:22:05 2015 UTC,I don't know which one I care about less. Black Site or Asylum. I couldn't care less about the titles. lol

I remember last year I ended losing track of PoI, Agents of Shield (can kinda give Shield a pass since the whole timing with Winter Solider resulted in an awesome pay off plus they've been better this year) and I think Grimm all because I'd sit down to watch an episode and realise I must have missed when and I can not watch shows out of order so I'd stop, have to find the missing episode and then I'd have two to watch and then I just start getting behind.  This spacing out of shows really seems to have become big in the last 2 to 3 years, maybe my memory is just bad but I really don't remember being this frustrated."

PersonOfInterest,2zrdsa,MsGladysBoah,2,Mon Mar 23 04:10:57 2015 UTC,"It's been the opposite for me, during a long break / in between seasons I'm more inclined to either forget that the show is on at all or I loose interest (basically the momentum is lost). Granted it wouldn't happen with POI, but in general that's how it has been for me. Of course it's not as if can watch the shows live, so I have not have had to deal the frustration that a show I like was on and I missed it because of the erratic scheduling."

I would much much rather have that then what is happening to POI. I hate to say it but it makes me start losing interest in it. I knew before the season that Blacklist was going to do it. But with POI seeming to do it more often it really is a punch in the gut when I realize there isn't a new episode on.
PersonOfInterest,2zrdsa,mobius_one6,5,Sat Mar 21 02:34:22 2015 UTC,I hate this week off - two weeks on and again three weeks off concept that CBS is following for POI. Would prefer 22 straight episodes - one after the other - with a break in the middle like what you suggest.

PersonOfInterest,2zrdsa,Fire2box,2,Sat Mar 21 04:09:20 2015 UTC,"I prefer the 1 wk breaks. This way the season at least lasts longer. A huge break in between would mean a loooong wait and the show (once it resumes) would be over quicker. At least that's my positive spin on that. But I feel it would be better for both fans and more casual viewers if the airing schedule were published/decided in the very beginning and people knew well ahead when new episodes are airing.  BTW the airing schedule for all 5 of this season's remaining episodes (meaning incl. the season finale) is finally up (wikipedia):  18 -  Skip: March 24, 2015  :(  19 -  Search and Destroy: April 7, 2015  20 -  Terra Incognita: April 14, 2015  :(  21 -  Black Site: April 28, 2015  22 -  YHWH: May 5, 2015  So 5 episodes to come and in between 2 weeks without a new episode. Not the worst deal and good that there's no break between the last 2 episodes."

Other shows would of had Fusco teasing him about it for the whole episode. John is a super hero who happens to go therapy.I just like how it was handled.

Fusco's probably known many cops who've had to go through it, I doubt he'd see it as a subject for teasing. And bare in mind, it was only a couple of episodes ago that he was telling John not to shut him out, I can't see him running his mouth off now and giving his partner reason to build up walls again."

PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,voidZero-,20,Fri Mar 20 12:21:18 2015 UTC,"If you remember, John was ""cleared"" and was no longer required to have sessions with a therapist. He chose to continue seeing her. I think at least part of that choice was due to romantic interest. He wants to open up to her not just to a therapist. It's clear he's not really comfortable with interpersonal relationships, or talking about his feelings, so this is his excuse to do that.  I agree from a professional standpoint, it's very much looked down upon. That rule is in place primarily so that the ""patient"" isn't taken advantage of. John doesn't strike me as the kind of person to let himself be manipulated in that way.  Look at his other two romantic interests; Zoe and Carter (the later of which I never really bought into). It's not like they met in conventional circumstances, and it's not like either of those ""relationships"" are/ were entirely healthy. I think the ""icky"" factor of their relationship is intentional on the part of the writers. We're not supposed to feel comfortable with it, and I don't think any of the characters are supposed to find romantic happiness. Grace is ongoing proof of that.  Besides, where and how else is he going to meet potential partners other than ""on the job""? It's not like he can sign up for Match.com."
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,ignoramus012,5,Fri Mar 20 17:56:31 2015 UTC,All really good points though since their meetings are still technically sessions I don't really think it matters that she cleared him for active duty it doesn't actually alleviate any of my ick factor.   And maybe you're right maybe that ick factor is intentional but I guess my problem there is that it's too icky for me and actually pulls me out of submersing myself fully in the story.   I think another thing that annoys me after thinking more on it overnight is the whole 'a patient so special that an otherwise competent therapist would risk throwing away her professional credibility to be with' trope.  Sure it hasn't got that far yet and I hope the writers don't actually go there or if they do it's subverted by her being a Samaritan/Decima plant (though like I said in another comment not sure how they'll pull that off believably).
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,the_boomr,5,Sat Mar 21 02:54:05 2015 UTC,Man I really never bought the John/Carter romance. It felt so last-minute afterthought shoved into the story...if they had built up to it at all in the previous episodes I could easily have been sold but it was like there were zero signs and then suddenly all at once a confession of love?
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,ignoramus012,6,Mon Mar 23 22:49:02 2015 UTC,"From what I have heard and read since writing that comment, it seems the kiss was completely improvised on the part of the actors and not written into the show. I've heard people say ""It wasn't romantic in nature."" Having watched the scene again, I don't buy that explanation completely.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImYDefPePk8  One possibility is that Reese cared for her because she played a part in saving his life, not that he chose to live because he cared for her. Reese has shown time and time again he doesn't do well with emotion. I think the kiss took Carter by surprise as much as it did the audience. No one knows what would have happened had Carter lived, but I suspect that she felt something for him in the moment, but it wouldn't have been a lasting romantic love. She cared for him and he cares for her as a human being, and they respected each other for their commitment to helping people.  It was a moment, not a declaration of undying devotion."
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,the_boomr,1 point,Tue Mar 24 03:27:57 2015 UTC,"Well that makes a little more sense. That's the thing though, I feel like the back story could easily have set up that kind of thing, but it just didn't. It isn't a big deal to me personally, I just didn't buy it entirely."
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,ignoramus012,2,Tue Mar 24 03:56:41 2015 UTC,"That's what I'm saying, though. I think the backstory did set up that kind of thing. So much of the characters' interactions are really subtle; conveyed by a look or a tone of voice rather than some sort of exposition. Think about John and Finch. Do they ever say ""I care about you. You're not just a partner in this endeavor of ours, but a friend.""? No. But it's implied over many episodes.  It's one of the things that surprised me about Root's interactions with Shaw. She was so blatant about it. I mean, it fit her character, but it was a bit of a departure for the writers, I think."
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,ariyahvansh,1 point,Tue Mar 24 10:41:56 2015 UTC,The Carter kiss was an acknowledgement of friendship and a kiss goodbye.

PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,ariyahvansh,8,Sat Mar 21 06:08:27 2015 UTC,They've done nothing romantic together so they are not being unethical at all.
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,PseudonameRed,3,Fri Mar 20 12:46:33 2015 UTC,"That's true. But I think the OP seems to be saying that if they were to get into an intimate romantic relationship, then that would be unethical (unless Reese was discharged first)."
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,Gaius_Gracchus,5,Fri Mar 20 16:24:43 2015 UTC,They're both professionals and have acted accordingly.  It is pretty obvious that Iris hit a nerve and it is one of the reasons why Reese has stayed.   Think about how much the character of Reese has lost in relation to what we know about his personality.  The guy is not a sociopath or crazy guy that is out to see the world burn.  He is trying to do good on his own terms yet he keeps losing people that are close to him.  Every person has a breaking point and I think it is safe to say he is probably approaching his if the Carter response was any indication.  The message the show gives is one that is needed and should be reinforced that seeking a little help is not a sign of weakness.  That is what I read from the whole situation.  The awkwardness of the sessions is reflected in how Reese just doesn't really know how to respond to the things he is hearing from his own mouth.  People always talk about needing to listen to others.  It is sometimes strange to listen to yourself.
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,EdwardGlyver,4,Sat Mar 21 02:38:56 2015 UTC,I really like how this is where we start questioning the ethics of characters on this show.
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,ariyahvansh,9,Mon Mar 23 17:17:53 2015 UTC,"I can't say it is disturbing. I think it adds an interesting, slightly murky wrinkle to the plot. It also allows John an outlet to really open up his more personal side. Something he doesn't always get to do.   Whether it is ethical or not (and yes, technically it is wholly unethical if they engaged in a physical relationship), these characters are not black and white. You need to add some subtle characterization here and there, otherwise what the hell is the point?  Thus far, the relationship between Iris and John has been handled well. It's subtle but effective. It continues to be one of the more interesting subplots of Season 4."
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,EdwardGlyver,5,Fri Mar 20 14:25:17 2015 UTC,"You're not the only one who finds this unethical, OP. Relationships between psychiatrists and their clients are major squicks for me and entail huge imbalances of power.   I really enjoyed the interactions between Reese and Iris at first, especially in 4x05, but when the romantic hints began in 4x14, I became deeply uncomfortable. Now when they share scenes, I find myself cringing. If the show really wants to have Reese in a relationship with Iris, then I hope that Reese is first discharged or transferred as a patient to another psychiatrist."
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,SavannahNix,1 point,Fri Mar 20 15:35:13 2015 UTC,It's also unethical to shoot people. Yet you still watch this show. I'm genuinely confused as to what your point is...
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,EdwardGlyver,7,Fri Mar 20 15:37:42 2015 UTC,"That is a logical fallacy. We all watch shows that are not completely realistic. Just because we enjoy characters who are at heart vigilantes doesn't mean we have to approve everything they do, does it? This show questions ethics all the time, and doesn't glorify shooting people. Thus, it strikes me as odd that the writers would overlook the idea of a therapist being romantically involved with a client. It's like they are forgetting that aspect of ethics, while making the show examine most other ethical questions."
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,SavannahNix,-1,Sat Mar 21 00:34:13 2015 UTC,I guess I'm just genuinely confused about why people would be so broken up about something that HAS NOT HAPPENED.
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,EdwardGlyver,5,Sat Mar 21 00:54:30 2015 UTC,"Maybe because they don't want it happen, thus don't care for it being foreshadowed. Why is this hard to understand? Person of Interest does not have a history of starting things it doesn't finish or introducing supporting characters for no reason. Thus, seeing several scenes giving the impression that there could be feelings on Iris' part for Reese and/or vice versa, there is a strong likelihood that there is a possibility that it could happen. I thought I was pretty clear in stating my objections to the idea in my other comment down thread.  If someone were to say something like, ""I don't want to see Dominic win"" even though that hasn't happened, would you be equally confused?"
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,SavannahNix,-1,Sat Mar 21 02:31:29 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, in the grand scheme of things, I think this a very odd portion of the show to criticize and focus on so intensely. Especially when trying to apply real world logic (i.e. the actual rules of the American Psychiatric Association like one user did below).   This dynamic is a plot device. Thus far, in terms of Reese's character, it's been an effective one. You are absolutely entitled to not like it as a turn of events. But again, it seems a very insignificant thing to criticize out of everything that has happened on the show. Especially when we have absolutely no idea where this subplot is going yet.   Also, if you stop and think about it for about 1.5 seconds, you'd realize that Reese engaging in a sexual relationship with a woman he barely knows (albeit one he opens up to) is out of character for him. And that's probably why nothing has happened yet. Either way, I choose to reserve judgement until the rest of the season has played out."
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,EdwardGlyver,2,Sun Mar 22 14:31:47 2015 UTC,"I am not focusing on it intensely, just discussing it in a thread. There are plenty of other things I have discussed concerning the show, both pro and con. In many ways the show is excellent and better than other shows on TV. They used to get my approval in almost everything, but I think they have messed up on several fronts recently. This is one of them. It isn't just that it would be unethical, though that adds to the issue. I find it ridiculous that of all people, Reese would voluntarily go to therapy or that, if he likes her, can't figure out how to see her otherwise, as if he's 12.   I don't think Reese in therapy/possibly attracted to his therapist should even be a subplot, unless he is going to have a break through that all the saving of irrelevants can't do for him. I don't see that he is learning ""new habits"" or dealing with grief or even answering her questions, despit deciding to see her more than the required sessions. She could make suggestions about how to change his habits, help him express himself, actually be therapeutic, but she has done none of those things, which leads me to think she is either merely a forced romantic interest or an undercover enemy. And a forced, unbelievable romantic interest isn't what I watch POI for.  I've stated my reasons. Sorry if that isn't good enough for you, but if I don't want a romance on the show between Reese and some ill conceived, bland character with whom he has no real chemistry, that's just how I feel. If they don't go the direction I don't want them to go in, I will be happy.  I dislike things that are mere plot devices, especially on this show which usually doesn't resort to such cliches. I am glad you are reserving judgement. I can still state my objection to the perceived direction, can't I? POI doesn't just drop things; they happen for a reason, so they must have a reason for this.  It could be the start of an off screen romance.  She could have ulterior motives such as working for Samaritan. She could be an unethical shrink. She could betray John to the police bosses.  Some of those could be interesting. A couple are boring tropes I wouldn't want to see. That's all."
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,SavannahNix,2,Sun Mar 22 15:11:03 2015 UTC,"I mean no disrespect. We each have an opinion and we disagree. At this stage, I think both arguments are played out, otherwise we run the risk of repeating the same thing over and over again. Agree to disagree. We'll see how the final 5 episodes play out."
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,ariyahvansh,2,Sun Mar 22 22:44:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's fine with me, no problem and I mean no disrespect either. You made some good points.  I am looking forward to the last of the season too!"
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,EdwardGlyver,2,Mon Mar 23 02:29:58 2015 UTC,"The show constantly has the characters question the morality of one another's actions, like spying on people and shooting people. So those things are not a problem for me since the show addresses them appropriately. The show has not yet addressed the fact that a relationship between a psychiatrist and her patient would be wrong though. If it addresses this and puts Reese and Iris in a relationship after first ensuring that Reese is no longer Iris's patient, then I would be okay with it. But if it puts them in a relationship while they are still patient and shrink respectively, then that is, quite objectively speaking, unethical. The American Psyciatric Association condemns it as unethical. It hinders the psychiatrist's ability to actually treat their patients. And it squicks me. I spent a short period of time working as a research assistant alongside a clinical neuropsychologist. Part of my job was helping administer neuropsychological tests. Once, I had a client who kept hitting on me, and I was so afraid that he'd make a move on me then lie and say that I had made advances on him. There would have been no way for me to disprove his claims, and I could have lost my job. The idea of a psychiatrist making making advances toward a patient is just as unsettling for me as a patient making advances on a psychiatrist."
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,ariyahvansh,3,Fri Mar 20 16:06:02 2015 UTC,"I take issue with a couple of things you wrote above:   First off, I never once said that, in a real life situation, romantic and/or sexual advances between a patient and doctor are not wrong. They are. It's a breach of ethics. However, this is Person of Interest. It's a fictional drama/scifi/action/neo noir television series that airs on CBS. It would appear that you are digging far too deeply here.   Second, I think it is foolhardy to condemn characters for something they haven't done or might never do. The slight romantic tension does exist, but nothing has happened. It's subtle. It's also caused Reese to open up in a way that he hasn't done in a while. As you mentioned, the characters on this show do question the moral implications of their actions frequently. But they are also characters that possess multiple facets. They are human. They fail, they make mistakes. Reese is a handsome guy, Iris is an attractive woman. Stuff happens. People are imperfect. I think it is a bit too early to write this subplot off in a negative fashion.   Finally, maybe the thing I have the most issue with is the use of the word ""disturbing"". Again, nothing has happened here. It's all subtle and nuanced character building. It's hardly what I would consider disturbing. For me, disturbing is the scene where Joan gets raped in Mad Men. That was disturbing, upsetting and hard to watch. Reese and Iris sharing a glance and some subtext is far from disturbing. It makes for drama and it propels the plot. Plain and simple."
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,Try_Another_Please,3,Fri Mar 20 16:40:11 2015 UTC,"But...I never said that you indicated that a relationship between a psychiatrist and her patient was ethical. I read your first post on this thread. I know that you think that it would be unethical, and that is an opinion that I share. I haven't antagonized your viewpoint.   Yes, I am aware that this is a science fiction TV show. But it's also highly realistic. We often see the legal side to characters' actions. If Reese and Iris were to get into a romantic relationship despite still being patient and shrink respectively, then that is a problem that the show would have to address. That is really all the OP and I have been trying to say. As it currently stands, it is true that they haven't done anything unethical yet. They haven't even really flirted. It's just that the romantic hints are rubbing me the wrong way because of the kind of work that I do and my personal experience.   Yes, I know that mistakes happen and that these characters are flawed. Again, the point that I am making is that the show would need to address the problems that would exist if Reese and Iris were to get into a relationship. Just like the show addresses all of the other problems with characters' actions. I am not writing this relationship off altogether. I am not being a brick wall about it. I am saying that if it goes any further, then the issues need to be dealt with.   I haven't used the word ""disturbing"". I've used the words ""squick"" and ""unsettling"". I have said, repeatedly now, that the relationship would make me uncomfortable if Iris was still Reese's therapist at the time that they got into it, but that I wouldn't have a problem with it if Reese was discharged first or if he was sent to see another therapist instead."
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,ariyahvansh,0,Fri Mar 20 18:14:05 2015 UTC,I don't really see why you would cringe. They are still having normal sessions like before. It's just a major deal that John would ever do sessions like that which is why importance is placed on his reactions. It seems pretty darn ridiculous to be cringing when they've made exactly zero steps towards being in a relationship...
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,SavannahNix,1 point,Sat Mar 21 20:19:18 2015 UTC,"Have I not explained several times now why I'm uncomfortable with the romantic hints? I know that Reese and Iris haven't done anything sexual in nature yet, but this show doesn't just do things without following up on them. So if it's laying down hints at a romance between these two, then it's likely that they will be in a relationship soon. Given that they are still patient and therapist, this would be unethical. The romantic hints are causing me to be far less immersed in the story. They're making it difficult for me to appreciate the dialogue exchanged between Reese and Iris during therapy sessions because I can no longer see this as the strictly professional interaction that it should be.   Edit: Sorry if I'm coming across as rude; that's not my intention. I'm just a bit frustrated that my discomfort with a potential romance between a shrink and her client is being questioned and ridiculed so much here."
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,hello2ulol,2,Sat Mar 21 20:28:52 2015 UTC,"I understand and I don't get it either. Maybe some don't really understand how and why it is unethical, and perhaps think that the no relationships rule is more of a suggestion than a way for the shrink to lose their license and entire career if it would happen, to say nothing of the reasons why it is deemed unethical. And thus a major squick to us."
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,SavannahNix,2,Mon Mar 23 02:41:01 2015 UTC,"John isn't the kind of guy to go out and interact with normal people, i.e. women. So when he is forced into a situation with one, naturally, he becomes attracted."

PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,SavannahNix,2,Wed Mar 25 03:04:01 2015 UTC,"Aside from the ethics issue, it just genuinely feels OOC to me. What is so great about Iris' powers of therapy, that John Reese, one of the most troubled, yet closed-mouthed characters ever, is going to suddenly find in her the person to whom he can unburden himself? He can't tell her much without sharing things that, if she isn't a Samaritan plant, will get her killed.   I just am not into the idea that Reese needs the cliched ""love of a good woman"" to be a whole, happy, okay, redeemed person. It's a trope that I don't want to see on this show that hasn't used those old tired ideas in the rest of its narrative. When Carter died, they had to indicate he had feelings for her romantically, as if his grief would only be believable under those circumstances. Sure, he's human and can find certain ladies attractive, but if the show is implying an attraction on his part, why have him continue as her patient, as if he can't think of another reason to spend time with her? Or if she likes him, why wouldn't she suggest, if he feels he should continue therapy, that he find another therapist?   I guess I just prefer the idea that Reese can become redeemed without a love interest. I don't see a relationship in the cards for him, or for Finch or the others for that matter. And as Finch told him in the pilot, he doesn't need a support group or pills, he needs a purpose."
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,eikeegimuu,3,Sat Mar 21 00:48:27 2015 UTC,"I just am not into the idea that Reese needs the cliched ""love of a good woman"" to be a whole, happy, okay, redeemed person.   I don't think that's the case.  He owes a lot to Finch, too.   When Carter died, they had to indicate he had feelings for her romantically, as if his grief would only be believable under those circumstances.   They didn't indicate that, especially since the kiss wasn't in the script.  From Greg Plageman: ""However you would characterize the relationship between these two characters up to this point, platonic or something deeper, that was never in question. It was intended to be a scene in which Reese and Carter both understood that what they were undertaking was life-harrowing and that this may or may not be the last time they'd see each other.""  Source"
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,SavannahNix,4,Sat Mar 21 03:50:49 2015 UTC,"I agree. He does owe a lot to Finch. Which is also a big part of my objection. This year, the writers have really given little attention to the relationship between Reese and Finch. When is the last time Reese has told someone that Finch saved him and gave him a purpose or told Finch he was concerned about him being in danger? Finch is the one person who understands Reese's past and his pain, yet they are apparently trying to make us believe he is more likely to confide in Iris.  Re Carter, yes, I know all that. But it was still portrayed as him having possible romantic feelings. Look at how they tried to retcon the beginning of the series, making their brief conversation at the precinct more important than the job Finch gave him, to say nothing about that ridiculous bullet thing. It was as if they had to make the audience believe it was something more than platonic or he wouldn't be grieving as much, as if he wouldn't have grieved if they had only been friends, which is just a crock, to say nothing of them throwing a bone to those who shipped Carter and Reese.   Much as I love this show, I am concerned that the central friendship between Reese and Finch seems to have been downgraded in importance so much."
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,eikeegimuu,4,Sat Mar 21 14:11:44 2015 UTC,"Re Carter and Reese. I had (also) the impression that the shall we say romantic potential between Reese and Carter was tackled on in order to explain why Reese went off the rails when she was killed.   I thought that Carter stepping in front of him and that she was someone he admired and respected + that he'd feel that he had again failed someone close to him would have been quite enough to explain Reese going on the warpath. Instead they had them kiss and then afterward Reese repeatably said things like how she saved him etc. Since I had seen nothing romantic between them and Reese's eulogies would have fit to T with Harold but not with Carter, her death and the aftermath felt like a cheap shot at making the audience care about the loss. Full disclosure, that impression was particularly strong since I didn't like Carter and I had no idea that she was a popular character. Either way, the character was established and popular enough for her death to have an impact without the (I felt) artificial heightening of the loss.  By now I've also read the interviews about how the kiss came to be and what it meant and that it wasn't really romantic. I find the not romantic part a bit ridiculous TBH. We've seen Reese in tight spots with both Harold and Fusco, but somehow then they've managed to restrain themselves from locking lips as an affirmative action.  About Reese and Harold – I think their relationship is still central, but their bond has been established in the previous seasons and it still holds. I mean their scenes together I great but I don't need them vocalizing how important for each other they are – they've done that before and it's still true."
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,eikeegimuu,3,Sat Mar 21 16:38:28 2015 UTC,"I agree. I wasn't a fan of Carter but I was aware if her being popular with some fans.   Re no lip locks between Fusco and or Finch and Reese in tight spots: Since there is the Root/Shaw kiss, we can't say the show wouldn't do such a thing, can we, lol? (Then again, this is Caviezel we're talking about.)  But I can see a kiss between close friends of opposite sexes in a situation like the one in the morgue between Reese and Carter; it was the other stuff, what I called the retcon of what turned Reese's life around that was worse, IMO. Not once since then has any acknowledgement of Finch having saved Reese been mentioned.  It's not that I need to see Finch and Reese vocalizing how important to each other they are, which would be repetitive and somewhat OOC, but one example I can think of is Finch's trip to Hong Kong. Reese never said a word about it, wasn't at all worried, yet with the increased danger from Samaritan, he should have been concerned.   As for their relationship being central, it wasn't until Shaw ""died"" and Root took off this season. Finally, after those events, the writers have them take at least working together again."
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,SavannahNix,1 point,Sat Mar 21 17:29:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, the kiss was also a lesser offence to me than the glowing speeches. Not because I can see it happening between close friends of opposite sexes if there's no romantic/sexual interest no matter how intense the situation. I don't. But because I guess there could have been other people who saw that between them or that that I didn't see it, doesn’t guarantee the feelings weren't there. However those big speeches I could see Reese saying about Harold or if they wanted to state those things regarding Carter then Fusco would have been a better fit.  Though compared with Root/Shaw there was around a season of Root flirting (on occasion outrageously) with Shaw, so the kiss was a surprise because they were both women not because there were no previous clues. Like for me with Reese and Carter – but maybe some people saw some clues, which I maybe dismissed because I didn't like Carter – same way I tried to be in denial about Root flirting with Shaw, but I had faced the music way before the Root/Shaw kiss. So I think there's no chance of Reese smooching either Harold or Fusco, though of course (if I had even thought to speculate) I would have been wrong about Reese and Carter too :P  I see what you mean with Reese and Harold. They are communicating less than they used to in general and are acting less caring maybe. But with the trip to Hong Kong – did Reese even know Harold went there, he had to, but I guess that supports what you were saying that he didn't act worried for Harold. I guess I'm interpreting it the way that if Harold is not in actual danger (like kidnapped by Greer) then Reese trusts that Harold can handle himself. Reese is after all less likely to underestimate Harold now than he did in the beginning."
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,eikeegimuu,2,Sat Mar 21 18:00:58 2015 UTC,"I don't get the feeling at all that Iris is meant to be a miracle therapist. It's more that Reese wants to talk since he has kept things inside for too long and Iris happens to be there and seems reliable. Therefore I don't think it's OOC, though of course it's not par for the course for him either (to verbalize his feelings) so I wonder what the payoff from that situation will be."

He's at a place where he wants to open up and these sessions were required to keep his cover. He never tried them before because he was in a position where he could escape them. When he couldn't he warmed to the idea.
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,SavannahNix,1 point,Sat Mar 21 20:23:14 2015 UTC,"He was not being a super spy when he met Dominic at all. At least Dominic had several run ins with him before deducing anything. I thought Harper's comment was out of left field and stupid, like the new thing isn't to call him The Man in the Suit but ""the cop who isn't a cop""."
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,eikeegimuu,1 point,Sun Mar 22 01:55:53 2015 UTC,"I wasn't impressed either, but I'm guessing it was meant to be impressive. Mostly I was puzzled why she let it go.  As far as her skills as a psychiatrist go I feel they have not even tried to make her particularity insightful (competent yes, wow no). That too makes me think it's more about Reese. For example I think Root during her psychiatrist gig was written as more insightful and like someone who could actually be helpful (until of course it was revealed that she's Root), but Root is a master manipulator and probably was able to guess some things based on previous research, so possibly that's a different level anyway."
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,SavannahNix,1 point,Sat Mar 21 18:13:48 2015 UTC,"I agree. If she really thinks he is faking being a cop, shouldn't she report him? If not, and I don't think she meant it literally, she should at least discuss it with him, at which point it would be logical for him to say he was military before becoming a cop. That isn't even unusual, in real life or on TV. Steve McGarrett on H50 and, going back to the 90s, Jim Ellison on The Sentinel, had military backgrounds they brought with them, the former was a Navy Seal, the latter an Army Ranger (like Reese) and this led to their unorthodox behavior that was constantly causing problems for them on the force. Heck, even [i]Carter[/i] was ex-military.  And I also agree that Iris isn't that insightful or therapeutic, certainly not as someone who comes across as the one individual someone like Reese would feel he can open up to. Yes, even Root was better, and she was a fake. Plus, when Reese first started seeing Iris, I thought, ""watch out, John, you remember the last time you talked to a shrink it turned out to be Root!"""
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,eikeegimuu,1 point,Sun Mar 22 01:53:19 2015 UTC,"I hope we will get an explanation for why she ignored it. Unless they really wrote it to show that she's perceptive. It could be that it was in order for Reese to trust her (exactly because she didn't report him), that makes maybe most sense narrativly (though Reese started opening up already before too), but it doesn't answer what the character's motivation is for not reporting him. I would prefer if she doesn't turn out to be a spy, but we'll see."

PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,eikeegimuu,1 point,Mon Mar 23 11:44:19 2015 UTC,"same to you, read my previous comment.  It isn't that hard to figure out.  Saying to one that you are no cop doesn't implement that one can't work in the force. She knows that Reese has troubled past = he has been in some shady government business and now ""retires"" to a simple cop/detective position."
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,rossbot,1 point,Wed Mar 25 11:10:40 2015 UTC,"What do you not understand ? :)  If She says Reese that I know/feel that you are no cop, why should she report him?  It is uncommon, but makes sense, if there is a war veteran, ex spy or FBI etc. that he/she would get job as a cop in some circumstances.  She understands Reese must be a former military guy of some sort, but from which department and why, she doesn't need to know.  it all makes sense."
PersonOfInterest,2zopzp,azilla14,1 point,Wed Mar 25 11:08:25 2015 UTC,"People can change careers during their working life and be ex-whatever but then they are current-somethingelse. If a war veteran, ex spy etc passes psych evaluation and also qualifies otherwise (as somebody coming from these fields almost certainly would) then from that point they ARE cops. Legit cops.  I’d imagine it’s not that unusual. Carter for example was ex-military, doesn’t mean that she wasn’t a cop because of that! So the doc saying that she knows that Reese is not a cop would indicate that she assumes he’s not legit. And I don’t understand why she would accept that. Changing careers isn’t the problem with that one but that it hasn’t been officially sanctioned."

If they did develop a romantic relationship between them I would not particularly like it but I would not have a problem with it either. Yes, in real life that would be a can of worms, but with a tv-show we have a bird's eye view of things and we actually would know if any manipulation has been going on. In this situation we know that while Reese has his vulnerabilities he's not exactly malleable and she has not tried to unduly influence him nor has she done anything else unethical.  Nor has actually anything happened so far. Basically, I think in this case future involvement isn’t tabu because they met as doctor/patient."

She barely managed to keep herself in control, but hey, she is just a human and slipped, Reese kissed her back and now it is on.

It's also the existential point made by Voltaire... all I really know for sure is that I am thinking this, so I as the thinker exist. The commandments... Samaritan may be ready to dictate a set of commandments to his ""followers"". There's a huge distinction made in Jesuit teachings about the difference between the Old Testament god and the New Testament god - wrath versus love. It also defines the two AIs - Samaritan is the old testament god and The Machine is the new testament god.   Plageman went to a Jesuit high school, so was fully versed in those distinctions.

PersonOfInterest,2zdvyx,subchannel,3,Wed Mar 18 03:04:55 2015 UTC,"Lol, when I saw the first gif I was like, ""Whoa, who's this?! Does he know who the fuck Reese is?"" Amateur hour in here, god dayum.   What episode is this from?"
PersonOfInterest,2zdvyx,ThatFag,4,Wed Mar 18 16:44:12 2015 UTC,"It's from 1x03- ""Mission Creep"".   Fun fact: the number for that episode, Joey Durban, was played by James Carpinello, Amy Acker's husband."

PersonOfInterest,2zdvyx,1hltx2,0,Tue Mar 17 23:17:49 2015 UTC,yes
PersonOfInterest,2zg0tb,GhostOfCreeper_DIG,14,Wed Mar 18 07:10:18 2015 UTC,"Perhaps ""Skip"" shows only a message reading: ""Error:404, Memories not found.  And  then, in the last minute, the message flickers and we see Finch, Reese, Root and Shaw standing in the subway and smiling.   And then Root says: ""That was sure close. I'm so glad Samaritan is gone now""  everyone smiles and nods  laughtrack"
PersonOfInterest,2zg0tb,ReasonablyBadass,9,Wed Mar 18 13:24:26 2015 UTC,"I know you're joking, but I think it would be a ballsy premise to have the Machine's feeds disrupted unexpectedly and have the entire episode be its internal processes desperately trying to piece together what's happening with only occasional flashes of information to help it.   I think something like that would have a lot of potential if written right, but I don't think there's any way the network would approve it."
PersonOfInterest,2zg0tb,UltraChip,2,Thu Mar 19 16:39:15 2015 UTC,"If it primarily reviews previous footage it could work for next season, similar to if-than-else this season...

PersonOfInterest,2zg0tb,jcc10,3,Wed Mar 25 06:42:16 2015 UTC,That would be quite cruel...  I hope another reason will become clear when we watch the episode.

PersonOfInterest,2zfnrl,backstept,5,Wed Mar 18 14:47:29 2015 UTC,these trailers make the show look fucking stupid

PersonOfInterest,2zfnrl,SavannahNix,3,Thu Mar 19 13:50:04 2015 UTC,"To me it is a show that has depth far beyond most procedurals and very infrequently goes for cheap laughs. I have not seen this episode yet, but it looks like they cut out two throwaway gags to make it look like the show is a silly action comedy with a womanising Reese.  Just my two cents."
PersonOfInterest,2zfnrl,Tom01111,1 point,Thu Mar 19 14:12:45 2015 UTC,"Nobody has seen it yet, actually.   If someone has never seen the show, they could get that impression, but since we know it doesn't go for cheap laughs, I doubt it will entirely be that way. That said, I'm not impressed with it either. But is Reese womanizing? She kisses him, not the other way around. I just am not into the idea of him having ""chemistry "" with now not one (Zoe) but three women. (Iris and now this random number)"
PersonOfInterest,2zfnrl,SavannahNix,1 point,Fri Mar 20 18:49:59 2015 UTC,"+1  and for the love of god stop with the breaks. This show shouldnt end in May! September to May is ridiculous!  2 week break after the trilogy, 1 week break at end of feb, 2 week break til this episode, Skip. Then another 1 week break (No POI 31st)"
PersonOfInterest,2zfnrl,Gus_Griswald,3,Sat Mar 21 04:28:50 2015 UTC,I was pretty surprised by the thing that happens in the very last bit.
PersonOfInterest,2zfnrl,SavannahNix,8,Wed Mar 18 06:00:37 2015 UTC,"Damn! Stray thoughts:     Any other show (COUGH ARROW COUGH) would have Reese hooking up with girls left, right and centre but this is the first time we see him kiss someone like that. Before that was Carter, then before that Stanton, then before that Jessica. And the only person he ever hooks up with in the events of the show is Zoe. I mean, I ship iReese for sure, but this trailer definitely makes me like the dynamic he's gonna have with the bounty hunter. I like how they play up the number of the week when clearly shit is hitting the fan with the Samaritan storyline. That one stray shot of Finch and Root is really exciting me. WHAT IS HAPPENING The return of Harper! Yay! :D Might also mean Dominic! :o ROOT'S WEARING A BEANIE :DDDDDD Bridges and Iris are in the episode, but again. CBS pandering to their procedural fans with these trailers"
PersonOfInterest,2ze9sx,pensee_idee,9,Tue Mar 17 21:23:40 2015 UTC,"Maybe im just gullible but i dont think she has any malicious intent. What i do think may happen though is that she is going to become a sort of ""opening"" to Reese. At some point Reese will open up to her, and someone will take advantage of this and use her to get at Reese."
PersonOfInterest,2ze9sx,m1tt,12,Wed Mar 18 00:46:51 2015 UTC,"My latest prediction comes from seeing her prod Reese about ""how he handles grief.""  I'm thinking maybe she knows how he handles grief, because she's realized that he shot / killed one of her relatives while grieving over Carter.  Iris has previously disclosed that almost all her male relatives are police officers.  Reese has shot a lot of cops over the years, some because they were in HR, some just because they were in his way.    Reese could have easily helped send one of Iris's HR-affiliated relatives to prison, or injured or killed one of her relatives while he was on one of his rampages.  A lot of us have wondered why no one seems to notice that shortly after ""the man in the suit"" vanishes, some new cop appears out of nowhere, shooting kneecaps with a frequency that suggests he's getting kickbacks from some doctor's office for every patient he sends them.    Well maybe Iris has noticed.  Maybe she's realized that the cop who got sent to her for unnecessarily blasting people's knees is the same man who hurt her relative.  Seeing him in action when the Brotherhood tried to do a drive-by on Silva should have clenched it for her.  If this is true, I'm not sure what endgame she has in mind.  Maybe she's trying to gaslight him, drive him into depression or suicide over his guilt for hurting people when he's sad.  Maybe she's planning to get him vulnerable enough to drug him, and do some kind of grand reveal speech before she shoots him.  Maybe she just wants an apology, or an admission from Reese that it was wrong of him to shoot her brother / father / uncle just because he was in the way when Reese was going after Alonzo Quinn."
PersonOfInterest,2ze9sx,your_mind_aches,8,Tue Mar 17 21:35:18 2015 UTC,...Damn. I really really ship iReese... but now I kind of want this to happen.
PersonOfInterest,2ze9sx,LordAnubis10,2,Wed Mar 18 00:03:07 2015 UTC,"Well, it's quite expensive if you're gonna ship it, then you'll have to get a new one next season"
PersonOfInterest,2ze9sx,your_mind_aches,2,Wed Mar 18 15:19:35 2015 UTC,I know you're trying to make a joke here but I'm not sure what it is.

PersonOfInterest,2ze9sx,your_mind_aches,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:43:16 2015 UTC,"Aha. I see. I suspected something like that, but in all honesty, shipping iDevices is way cheaper than buying it in my country."
PersonOfInterest,2ze9sx,ArachnoLad,3,Wed Mar 18 18:45:43 2015 UTC,"Maybe she wants him to say things that might sound like he is depressed and suicidal. Then she kills him and makes it look like a suicide. No one would suspect otherwise (in her hypothetical mind) because she would have some sort of record on what was said during his sessions.   Although, I think Reese or Finch would have done some research on her and would have found out who her relatives are. But yeah, if she is related to a lot of cops then odds are high that at least one of them was in HR."
PersonOfInterest,2ze9sx,xieng5quaiViuGheceeg,2,Wed Mar 18 06:31:40 2015 UTC,Maybe it's not revenge.  She really is in love with him and knows (or suspects) he's the Man in the Suit (tm) and realized the only way she can figure out who this person is is to get closer than she is supposed to...  But no real agenda other than fascination.
PersonOfInterest,2ze9sx,orramus,6,Fri Mar 27 04:05:14 2015 UTC,"I'd like Iris to be something I'd call ""Life After the Machine"".  I know Greg and Jonah have said time and again everyone is going to die, but I'm hoping she would actually help Reese overcome his inner demons and leave this life behind at the end of the series. Instead of using her character for nefarious objectives, I hope the writers are trying to help Reese shed some of his darkness.  But I don't really have high hopes for this, knowing POI ..."
PersonOfInterest,2ze9sx,Jethro_McCrazy,3,Wed Mar 18 02:05:14 2015 UTC,"The fact that they keep saying it makes me think they are going to live. Well, ""live.""  Finch and Reese have both ""died"" before. We still don't know Harold's real name. Finch might die, while Harold gets to finally go marry his fiance in Europe."
PersonOfInterest,2ze9sx,InadequateUsername,2,Wed Mar 18 13:03:43 2015 UTC,I think that wouldn't work out if shes believed him to be dead for all these years.
PersonOfInterest,2ze9sx,Jethro_McCrazy,1 point,Wed Mar 18 20:55:46 2015 UTC,"She hasn't moved on, and still talks about him with love. He's been doing everything in his power to protect her for all these years, up to giving himself up to ensure her safety, and sending her to Europe for her protection. If he was able to finally tell her the truth, you bet your ass she'd welcome him back with open arms."
PersonOfInterest,2ze9sx,SINCEE,0,Thu Mar 19 04:01:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, because that's exactly how women think."
PersonOfInterest,2ze9sx,Jethro_McCrazy,1 point,Fri Mar 20 19:10:26 2015 UTC,I'd say the same thing if the genders were reversed.
PersonOfInterest,2ze9sx,orramus,2,Fri Mar 20 23:50:48 2015 UTC,"I like your point, because I too have always thought they could reveal their true names/identities by the end of the series, when there's no longer a need for Finch and Reese."
PersonOfInterest,2ze9sx,eikeegimuu,4,Thu Mar 19 01:23:34 2015 UTC,"I don’t get bad vibes about her. Though one undeniably off-thing about her was that she sussed out that Reese is not a real cop and she's cool with that. I'm not sure what the logic behind that would be if she is a bystander. Reese talking to himself (actually to Harold via the earpiece) at the gala and her not batting an eye was also weird. So who knows.   She’s been in a number of episodes and I’d think they are going to use the character for something else too besides being the soundboard for Reese dealing with his emotional state.  Anyway, I don’t think she’s a mole. If anything, I see her more as someone who has been positively influenced by Reese/Harold when they were saving a number – so she might be aware both of the “Man in a Suit” sightings and know from someone close to her that the anonymous helper is real and one of the good guys. And that’s why she’s letting it slide that Reese in not a real cop and is ostensibly babbling to himself during dinners.  Could also be that she simply gets caught in the crossfire and Reese has to make some tough decisions."
PersonOfInterest,2ze9sx,john_gilpin,3,Wed Mar 18 09:37:19 2015 UTC,I dunno...Iris may turn out to be a Samaritan mole.I get some bad vibes about her.
PersonOfInterest,2ze9sx,CatandWolf,3,Wed Mar 18 02:54:36 2015 UTC,I get bad vibes about her too. Just waiting for the other shoe to drop every time we see her with Reese. It might just be my general mistrust of anyone Team Machine meets specially after Samaritan came online. Samaritan could very well do what Root did to attract TM's attention by using a decoy POI/Irrelevant.
PersonOfInterest,2zf7wp,Iamabioticgod,3,Wed Mar 18 01:55:28 2015 UTC,"Can anyone please explain why there are so many breaks in PoI? Is it a feature of American TV or this series or something else?  I understand the mid-season breaks that some series have, but not the continual breaking for a week, two weeks, or more. It disrupts the flow of the story for me."
PersonOfInterest,2zf7wp,RovingAtom,4,Wed Mar 18 11:09:04 2015 UTC,"After watching a bunch of shows live (HIMYM, Arrow, Flash, Castle etc), it just seems to be a feature of American TV to have lots of breaks, I don't think it necessarily means anything."

PersonOfInterest,2zf7wp,RovingAtom,5,Wed Mar 18 12:02:02 2015 UTC,No problemo. It's even more annoying when there's a break for some sporting event or American holiday. Grumble grumble.
PersonOfInterest,2zf7wp,bogoldy_boo,3,Wed Mar 18 12:17:42 2015 UTC,"Apparently it is also because certain months produce better viewing figures in the US so they hold episode bulks back until those months. Like March has march madness, so you'll notice we don't have many episodes this month, but Feb is a quiet month so they put an episode a week in feb (aaah, how I miss thee)."
PersonOfInterest,2zf7wp,man_in_the_suit,2,Wed Mar 18 13:06:27 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I didn't know that! The continuation of a series seems to hinge on viewing figures so I can understand why they'd do that."

PersonOfInterest,2zf7wp,mustard_mustache,1 point,Wed Mar 18 21:21:45 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it's be cause Sarah Shahi is pregnant and they're giving her time to have her baby. I'm pretty sure that's also why what happened to shaw in the show happened
PersonOfInterest,2zf7wp,whitewater2,1 point,Wed Mar 18 23:53:50 2015 UTC,"That is not correct at all as to why their scheduling is the way CBS wants it. For Shaw's character, yes that is why her character arc is the way it is.  The season is planned out before hand and their finale is airing May 5th. They film 10 months out of the year and a 2 month hiatus.  They need to streatch 22 episodes for SEPT-MAY so that is why there is breaks. This is quite common for shows on the traditional networks of ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC."

The lesson is: That anyone who looks on the world as if it was a game of Chess deserves to lose.”    This quote speaks to Finch's moral code and how that influences The Machine's decision-making to this day.

That's probably not the case though, since there would likely have been some info that the actors playing those characters have been sighted on the set or a listed among cast.  But those guys will definitely show up again. Maybe the new identities Root and the Machine gave them enable them to keep working on some project that can be used against Samaritan (even if they are not working on it in Caleb's company)."

The fastest travel time from NY to Prague by Private Chartered 777 is 10 Hours + say 1 Hour for locating Kai - meaning 11 hours. But he miraculously appears in Prague to ambush the bad guys within 2-3 hours atmost (It is still night in NY).

I would actually do a variation on the original S1 narration, but divy the lines up so that each cast member got some narration - perhaps even Nolan's Uncle / Greer.    Harold: We are being watched. The government had a secret system, a machine that spied on us every hour of every day. I know because I built it. The machine was designed with a moral code for the purpose of detecting acts of terror, but it sees everything.   Fusco: Violent crimes involving ordinary people, people like you. The Government wouldn't act to save these people, so we assembled a team with the skills and the opportunity.   Root(Greer?): A malevolent private corporation has executed a plan to replace the machine with it's own: Samaritan. Samaritan's forces hunt us at every turn, but we continue working in secret to prevent violent crime.   Reese: More secretive than ever - you could never hope to find us. If you're a potential victim or a possible perpetrator, when your number's up... we'll find you.   I'm going to listen to GSM's podcast later tonight and transcribe their intro. It has a few smaller changes, most notable being that they make mention of ""government agencies and assassins"" protecting the machine. Clearly they're referring to Samaritan with the last bit. I'll be back later with their rendition.  The biggest problem with trying to alter the existing format to include mention of Decima, Samaritan, and the interference they are having on the work The Team is doing is... It's hard to be succinct. It gets too wordy, too complicated. And maybe it is too complicated to add into the existing format. Maybe the entire bit does need to be changed to reflect new realities. I'm not at all against a Samaritan-perspective narration voiced by Greer as you're saying. I'll return with some other ideas..."

It was designed to detect acts of terror, but it's reshaping humanity as we know it. Violent wars, ended. Famines, over.  There are deviants who don't believe in a better world. We do.  Pursued by these people, we work in secret.  You will never find us, but irrelevant or deviant, if there's a discrepancy; we'll find you.

It's recognizable by the fanbase, to the point where I think very few people who watch the show get confused when it's called The Machine. I have noticed that they've cut back on calling it The Machine in the show, with 'it' and 'she' being the preferred, depending on who is referring to it.  While technically correct in saying that it is no longer the only machine and therefore is not literally THE machine, I enjoy the semantic value behind it. So while I do acknowledge the literal incorrectness, I'm not going to change my vocabulary based on a literal technicality.  In the show, though, I believe I have caught Control and others on the relevant side referring to her as Northern Lights or by other pseudonyms she's gone by on the show, so the producers/writers may very well share the sentiment of it no longer being the only machine and therefore not referring to it as such."

PersonOfInterest,2ytpll,Afalstein,10,Thu Mar 12 19:03:08 2015 UTC,"I thought the compression software was pretext not something that Root actually needed. The compression can certainly be useful but Root or the Machine could have gotten access to that without Root joining Caleb's company. And based on that episode Root's app's only purpose was to get the company interested in hiring Root, so I think that particular app has no other purpose beyond that.  Root probably made the app and wanted that job offer for other reasons. Probably in order to get access to this company - to recruit good programmers (incl. Caleb?) for the cause or to be in place to anticipate Caleb's company working with or making contact with Samaritan.   Considering that in the beginning of the episode Root mentioned the possibility of recruiting people that seems the likeliest guess. While it would also make sense for the Machine to take advantage of Caleb's algorithm, I think Rood wouldn't have had to join the company to get access to that. Rather it could be that Root is going to build a back-door to whatever Caleb's company is working on (probably easier to do that from inside than by hacking).  So I think Root had herself hired in order to either recruit some of her new co-workers or to build a back-door into whatever Caleb's company is developing (possibly for Samaritan)."

PersonOfInterest,2ytpll,theDagman,1 point,Thu Mar 12 21:43:21 2015 UTC,I like this theory. Another way to take this is for The Machine to add its morality code to Samaritans code and they can work together.

PersonOfInterest,2ytpll,eikeegimuu,2,Fri Mar 13 04:06:44 2015 UTC,"Reading text in all caps is painful. Not as painful as Harold’s possible demise but that's unlikely to happen (unless they are going to keep the character on the show as an hologram of sorts or use many flashbacks - neither is very likely).  But I doubt that some Mata Hari (or Mr Hairy :P) went for very specific pillow talk and is now spilling the beans online. Though the scenario sounds interesting and Root being featured more would be great :)  So the scenario seems cool, only thing that is really questionable (not that the scenario is a spoiler anyway, but just to speculate) besides killing off Harold is that team Machine is going to incapacitate a lot of Samaritan's operatives in a certain time-frame – there are too many operatives and is team M going around kneecapping them or hacking their accounts? I think they don't have much chance in dealing with a significant number of Samaritan’s operatives individually and they’d have to use a trickle-down solution. But if they got permanent access to the operative location data etc that would be incredibly useful."
PersonOfInterest,2ytpll,john_gilpin,1 point,Fri Mar 13 12:18:11 2015 UTC,Looking at it - Fusco - Too Low; Bear - Is a Dog; Reese - Still is very important especially with Shaw Gone; Root - Vital as Analog Interface;  That leaves Finch. Frankly after Root began taking instructions from the Machine and began to act like a human being instead of a psycho killer caring for and helping team machine - Finch's role is becoming sort of redundant and he seems highly unsuited for a cunning warrior with an MI6 Background like Greer.   However i do agree that Finch and Reese cannot be killed off.  I do hope control joins team machine as a competition for Greer.
PersonOfInterest,2ytpll,eikeegimuu,1 point,Fri Mar 13 13:26:12 2015 UTC,"I think Harold is safe (as is Reese) based on the business side of putting this show on air. But if business wasn’t a consideration then for me the reason why he would be killed off (in case somebody has to be killed off) is not that he’s not a ruthless enough adversary for Greer (because I think he has potential for that and more and he’s definitely not redundant), but because his death would have a bigger impact than anybody else’s.   Anybody else gets killed off and it’s pretty much Carter/Shaw Redux and the biggest impact would be that the surviving characters are occasionally sad (or however they already reacted after Carter/Shaw) and it wouldn't really open up unexplored avenues in the story. With Harold’s death it would go beyond that. It could be in a way poetic to have Harold die and have others carry on his legacy and it would be interesting to have them discover things in retrospect and maybe at times second-guess Harold’s past motivations + imagine how the Machine might react."
PersonOfInterest,2ytpll,john_gilpin,1 point,Fri Mar 13 14:43:15 2015 UTC,"Finch is not soft in any way - but he is definitely not ruthless like Greer nor is he steeped in the spy arts like greer is. With Root in the picture now - He is no longer the only contact with the machine and He does not seem equipped to fight the war with samaritan (Even now - it is Root who is given the missions and it is Root who was told to develop the application and get a partnership with Caleb  Phipps, Root even saved Harolds life).   Right now - Root has become hugely vital to Team Machine; Reese is important as the only person badass enough to handle the irrelevant numbers; Fusco - inconsequential but still humorous; Bear - Is a Dog - and no threat to samaritan; Finch is the only one who has no purpose here. 17 Episodes - roughly 9 months have not seen him in any way assess and plan for a strategy against Samaritan (Except for a brief sojurn with Ross gellers wife's lesbian partner in Friends - in Hong Kong which has still not gone anywhere concete).   And if you do know - Harold was petrified of Samaritan in S4E1; This is not his character. He does not fear detection or death. Maybe he was frightened of being killed and the machine being free of all shackles and causing a AI vs AI battle.  I think at this juncture if anyone has to go from Team machine it would be Harold. However if i had anything to do with it - i would hope it would be GREER and Maxine."
PersonOfInterest,2ytpll,eikeegimuu,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:54:45 2015 UTC,"To me it seems more likely that now that Harold is also in contact with the Machine, Root's function isn't as unique as when the Machine was directly communicating with only Root. But maybe yes, Harold could take on some of Root's functions, but Root is capable of taking on all of Harold functions (from a practical perspective that is).   Meaning Harold could communicate with the Machine but he's not as versatile with undercover work (incl. weapon skills), but Root could do all the IT and job assignment tasks, incl. dealing with irrelevant numbers. Of course Root doesn't have Harold's morals and that might be a problem (with Samaritan it's maybe an advantage but maybe not). It would be fun though to see Root casually dealing with irrelevants with the attitude that they are barely worth her time.  Root is my favorite character and as far as I'm concerned the worst case scenario with POI is that she will not be a part of the show anymore (never mind the eventual outcome with Samaritan :P). But fact is that the vibe and feel of the show hinge a lot on Harold and based on that I think he'll be a part of it until pretty much the end.

PersonOfInterest,2ytpll,john_gilpin,0,Fri Mar 13 16:56:22 2015 UTC,Looking at it - Fusco - Too Low; Bear - Is a Dog; Reese - Still is very important especially with Shaw Gone; Root - Vital as Analog Interface;  That leaves Finch. Frankly after Root began taking instructions from the Machine and began to act like a human being instead of a psycho killer caring for and helping team machine - Finch's role is becoming sort of redundant and he seems highly unsuited for a cunning warrior with an MI6 Background like Greer.   However i do agree that Finch and Reese cannot be killed off.  I do hope control joins team machine as a competition for Greer.

Concern, mostly. He witnessed first-hand that knowledge of The Machine and working at its behest can get people killed (Nathan). He is a ""very private person"" and employing a private army just isn't his style. The Machine also had feeds from Paris, Berlin, Ordos, Shanghai, ... basically all over the globe. Either both The Machine and Samaritan hacked into those feeds on their own or the NSA somehow got them. It seems plausible and consistent in both cases. If The Machine would be built today, maybe its hardware would be similar to what Samaritan uses now. Also, it is an open question whether Samaritan is ""more powerful"" than The Machine. It relies heavily in what you mean by ""more powerful"". Samaritan is certainly more aggressive and invasive than The Machine and, as you pointed out, its hardware is newer/more powerful, but whether or not that makes it more powerful is yet to be seen. I would say that it does. The Machine was built with a moral code and a care for humans in general whereas Samaritan was not. When Samaritan ordered snipers to kill the people threatening Claire Mahoney, it was not just protecting her but recruiting her as an asset and demonstrating its power. I would argue that as soon as someone within Samaritan's organization becomes a threat or a hindrance to it, that person will be dropped like a hot potato in the blink of an eye. The Machine on the other hand doesn't rely on showmanship, intimidation or manipulation. If Root is to be believed, The Machine deeply cares for everyone in its employ, which is the whole point behind the season 3 finale. Those cover identities were created by The Machine, Root and her hackers to keep everyone safe. Look back to the episode If-Then-Else, where the machine is shown finding the best option to take to keep everyone alive."

Root and 2piR dude's compression app is designed to facilitate The Machine ""winning"" in either situation, either by giving it more influence or by being revealed to actually be a project to create a successor Machine and guarantee that it has the same sense of morality as its predecessor. I would say these two scenarios are the most likely, though its entirely possible that things get even more dystopian before Team Machine strikes a real victory against Samaritan. Does Bad Robot have the balls to off one of the big 2 in the finale this time, or simply send one of our 4 remaining team members MIA? This is a more interesting possibility, IMHO. I don't think things have gotten as bad as they could possibly get. Things have certainly not gotten bad enough for Control and The NSA to be forced to push back. That would make for an interesting mid-season arc or season finale arc. All wild speculation based on what we know now, though."

To me, this reads as ""The Machine is capable of self-improvement and self-modification"".  Then, at the end of Season 2:   Special Counsel: ""So tell me, where did you move the machine?"" Finch: ""It moved itself."" Special Counsel: ""But who controls it?"" Finch: ""As of now, it controls itself."" Special Counsel: ""The numbers, will they continue to come to us?"" Finch: ""That will be up to the machine.""     In other words: it gained complete autonomy and lost any restrictions or controls. It was ""set free"".

PersonOfInterest,2yqbsk,your_mind_aches,3,Wed Mar 11 22:56:47 2015 UTC,Slim to none. Seeing the machine and Samaritan merge however seems possible.
PersonOfInterest,2yqbsk,morior_invictus,6,Wed Mar 11 22:43:46 2015 UTC,"Another thought crossed my mind. The Machine may have come to the conclusion that the only way to defeat Samaritan is... mutually assured destruction. The Machine understands that the need to continue saving the numbers exists even if it is destroyed. This makes Root and 2piR kid's new project seem to be at least the possible genesis of a successor Machine. We still don't have enough information to predict what kind of action Root has in mind. And then there's the problem of Harold potentially refusing to go along if he feels the collateral damage would be too high. Harold and Reese's reactions to the situation with Shaw have been very different. There are some things they would probably do now. But there are still some things that Finch, in particular, would not."
PersonOfInterest,2yqbsk,shinsaikou,1 point,Thu Mar 12 00:53:08 2015 UTC,"This does make a lot of sense. The Machine flat out stated in The Cold War that it knows it can't win, so it could decide to take down Samaritan with it.

PersonOfInterest,2yqbsk,EThorns,1 point,Thu Mar 12 15:12:58 2015 UTC,"I think it would be more probable for Claire to steal Samaritan source code and go dark then bring it online herself tailored to her own wishes, rather than having a completely new third AI."

PersonOfInterest,2ymbvu,individualsovereign,2,Wed Mar 11 16:25:49 2015 UTC,I think it's because we haven't seen her on PoI in a while and Dunbar is all over Season 3 of HoC which is fresh onto our screens. I had the exact same thought while watching.

They saw the guy get framed for the robbery and did nothing, didn't even seem to care.   Then no one cares that Morris is getting framed? They only cared in the context of saving the psychiatrist. What's up with that??"
PersonOfInterest,2ymbvu,pensee_idee,5,Wed Mar 11 04:48:18 2015 UTC,"In the case of the guy being framed, I think they believed he was guilty of the crime the lady in the wheelchair described, and that they were okay with him being punished more than he had been for that crime.  Since Reese himself routinely frames people for drug possession when he wants a quick way to get rid of them, it's unlikely that he, at least, was going to have a problem with that.  (As an aside, that frame job was some pure Michael Westen Burn Notice stuff.)  Finch certainly had a problem with the fact that Edwards had framed Morris in the past.  I think he doubted whether or not Morris was guilty at all, and I think he believed that Morris's prison sentence was long enough, even if he really was guilty.  I don't think Reese or Fusco particularly considered that Morris might have been innocent of the original murder.  If they thought about it at all, they probably thought that Morris really was guilty and that Edwards' lie was justified in order to make sure that he went to prison.  I also don't think they liked that he had been released after 7 years, and I think they were willing to let Edwards frame him to put him back in.  Reese didn't even particularly seem to care when he thought that Edwards might shoot Morris; he only stepped in to stop Edwards from killing himself.  Finch is playing the group's conscience a lot lately - here at least as much as when Reese and Root were preparing to torture that woman in Maple.  I'm worried that it's building up to Finch trying to talk Reese out of doing something - and being unable to do so."
PersonOfInterest,2ymbvu,rpawson5771,21,Wed Mar 11 09:27:20 2015 UTC,"This one didn't do much for me. The flashbacks were the most interesting parts to me, but they were minimal.

But since then:-  MIA - well, okay, since we're coming down off a high  Guilty - well, okay, I guess this is a callback to the old format, resettling  Q&A - well, phew, okay, I'm not sure the Claire character is made out but it okay I suppose  Blunt - well, oh yeah. Dominic. Dominic's a pretty cool character, and something something with the data compression, so something is going on. Okay, I suppose.  Karma - Look. Seriously. My patience is getting exhausted here. This is just another piss-simple 'number of the week' episode. What the hell is meant to be going on? Is it really nearly 3 months since Control was abducted?

Not bad for a filler episode, but not one of the best either."
PersonOfInterest,2ymbvu,eikeegimuu,6,Wed Mar 11 02:53:06 2015 UTC,"I liked the episode. It didn’t offer any big surprises or revelations, but it had some good bits for Harold, Reese and Fusco.   The number of the week story was ok, though it seemed mostly like a tie-in in order to show Harold’s flashbacks. I liked that the Machine gave the number before checking whether the convicted guy was guilty or not and that we didn’t get an answer either (and whether or not the number had framed an innocent guy for murder) – though I thought he probably wasn’t guilty. In a way it would have been interesting to see the Machine knowing that the convicted guy was guilty and still save him from incarceration but even then it could be that the objective was anyway to save the number’s life + Machine could have predicted that the last part of the frame-up wouldn’t work (because of the envelope on the crime scene for one).  As for the flashbacks there have been other flashbacks for Harold that I’ve felt had more impact, but even so it was good to see that chapter in Harold’s history. And it was a nice touch that Harold’s square turned red in the flashback when Harold wasn’t abandoning his revenge plan.  I’m starting to wonder what’s up with Reese dealing with / verbalizing his feelings and whether there might be a different payoff than expected. It could be that it’s “just” fine-tuning the character or that it’s used to make him bond with the doc, but I’m starting to think that he’s moving toward some changes. Meaning that the end result can’t be “passive” acceptance but that it has to have some “active” impact.  The best part of the episode was for me Harold’s speech at the greenhouse."

PersonOfInterest,2ymbvu,dj_blueshift,3,Thu Mar 12 13:58:27 2015 UTC,About the Machine's voice: In the flashback we just hear a noise when Finch picks up the phone and he mentions that he didn't give the Machine a voice. At what point did the Machine get a voice? Was it when Finch changed the number delivery system?
PersonOfInterest,2ymbvu,UltraChip,5,Sat Mar 14 07:45:55 2015 UTC,"It's possible.   It could also be that the ""I didn't give you a voice"" line was Harold's way of reminding the Machine it's restricted to giving SSN's only."
PersonOfInterest,2ymbvu,dnlsrl,3,Wed Mar 11 08:14:16 2015 UTC,Most probably the machine built its voice database itself.
PersonOfInterest,2ymbvu,eikeegimuu,3,Wed Mar 11 13:30:31 2015 UTC,The Machine got a voice (or rather was able to express itself) after the Machine was set free via Harold’s virus. Previously restrictions were put in place by Harold that limited the communication to SSN.  The Machine also talked to Root and Reese when they received the contingency phone call before that and at first I assumed it could keep talking to Root afterward because Root had previously that access and the Machine choose to retain that. It seems more likely however that after the virus the Machine can talk directly to whoever it chooses. Though as far as I remember the only other person we know the Machine has talked to besides Root was Harold – and that happened off-screen.
PersonOfInterest,2ymbvu,pensee_idee,3,Wed Mar 11 13:58:48 2015 UTC,"It's nice to see a little character development for Reese again.  The thing is, we know how he deals with grief, and it's ugly.  I don't think he's going to be able to let his questions about Morris go.  For awhile, I thought the psychiatrist might have killed his own wife and framed the delivery guy, but it doesn't seem like that's what happened.  Morris might have done it, or not, but I don't think he took the fall for the doctor's crimes.  Reese gives good advice about not seeking revenge, every character on this show who's tried to go it alone, or get revenge against everyone who's wronged them has gotten killed for it.  Reese was smart not to try to take down the entire CIA after they burned him, but he has a very hard time letting go of women who are murdered by husbands/boyfriends/stalkers.    Finch, and probably even Fusco, are prepared to let Morris walk away at this point, but I don't think Reese is, and I think it's going to blow up in his face.  The last couple times he felt like this, he walked into a US Marshall's office in broad daylight and assaulted a half-dozen federal agents just to say something to one man, he tore through the city letting people burn to death inside their cars and crippling quite a few SWAT team members.  If he does anything like that again, he's going to get fired from the police, and Samaritan is going to find him.  At that point, I don't even know what would be worse, if he gave up everything trying to get revenge against a man who was actually innocent, or if he was forced to confront the fact that even if Morris is guilty, punishing him will not be worth the price that Finch and Fusco are forced to pay on his behalf.  Prediction: John dies at the end of this season."
PersonOfInterest,2ymbvu,john_gilpin,3,Wed Mar 11 14:04:07 2015 UTC,Dont Agree. John is vital to team machine for the moment especially without Root. My prediction is Finch dies and Root takes over Team Machine.  Of course i also predicted that the Guy who let shaw get away and  Detective Silva  - would have something to do with Team machine in the future but so far nothing has happened on that line

I feel certain that the series finale will have everyone die, and that the Machine will persist and Samaritan won't, but beyond that, I have no idea how we get there.  I'm basing my speculation a bit on some interviews around actress Sarah Shahi taking a hiatus.  One of the writers or producers said something to the effect that they had been planning to ask Jim Cavizel to retire from the show, but that Shahi's pregnancy meant that they got to work with him for ""a few more episodes.""  Now, that part of the interview could have been joking, and a ""a few more"" could mean all the way to the end, but it got me thinking.  It's hard to imagine Reese without Finch.  If he didn't die trying to save him, I think he would wish that he had."

PersonOfInterest,2ymbvu,ariyahvansh,2,Thu Mar 12 12:27:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think that the flashbacks portrayed him as out of character. Remember, Finch recently once told Reese and Shaw to kill all the Samaritan operatives if they harmed Grace in any way. Finch, like the other members of Team Machine, does not mess around when it comes to people he cares about. Losing Nathan before his eyes was an incredibly traumatic event for him, and he felt strongly responsible for it given that he got rid of the irrelevant list right before Nathan's number came up. But he was also infuriated with the government agents to whom he and Nathan had entrusted their work; they'd betrayed him and killed his friend (as well as numerous other civilians whom they treated as collateral damage) in cold blood. The flashback showed Finch contemplating vengeance, but being brought back to morality by Alicia's pleas. This is, at least in part, why he is the way he is today. The bombing and the aftermath changed Finch. He went from not really caring for the irrelevant list to doing his utmost to save those people, since he couldn't save Nathan. He went from wanting to exact revenge to realizing that it wouldn't bring him the closure he desired."

PersonOfInterest,2yl4k0,EThorns,19,Tue Mar 10 18:43:24 2015 UTC,"Some far-flung speculation based on the title:  YHWH is the hebrew name of YeHoWaH or Yahweh (written Hebrew only contains consonants mostly), the Jewish god. Something interesting about this is that many words for this God are actually plural in Hebrew like Elohim (gods) and Adonai (my lords). Could this mean the Machine and Samaritan are gonna merge like some people in this subreddit speculated?  The true etymology is unknown but you can find examples of potential origins of the word on Wikipedia. Some speculations of mine on certain meanings: *""I shall be what I am"": The machine may be offered to take Samaritans place but chooses to stay the way it is. *""I will become what I choose to become"" the Machine or Samaritan 'become' something else robot, different role? *""he who gives life"", ""He causes to become"", ""he who causes to exist"": This may be the most interesting of these meanings if I understand it correctly. It could mean that one of the AIs creates life. In what form biological or digital remains to be seen, but genetic modification and a soceity of AIs is equally interesting.  When I looked at the Wikipedia page I also noticed that there seems to be some special tradition of the Samaritans that has to do with the name. There's probably no conection to Samaritan in the title, but it's worth a bit of speculation. So the Samaritans as well as the Jews weren't allowed to say the name of their god. Maybe this could mean that Finch gets the opportunity of revealing the Machine and Samaritan to the public (like he almost did in Deus Ex Machina) but chooses not to.  Some other theory: Greer frequently compares the machine to the old gods and Samaritan the old gods. In reality polytheistic (many gods) religions got replaced by monotheistic (one god) ones. The first of these was Judaism whose god was YHWH. So this could mean that the Machine AND Samaritan get replaced by something new. This would back the third machine theory. This third machine could be created by Root, the Machine and Caleb. Or like i mentioned somewhere above it could be created by one or both AIs.  Edit: Some further speculation in this comment."

In all of the discussion here, it seems that everyone forgot that there was an ethnic group of people called The Samaritans. That they also worshiped YHWH. That they were considered by by their forebears to be the least of The Peoples of The Book. That they considered themselves to be the true keepers of the true faith. That they hated their Judaic forebears as much as their Judaic forbears hated them. The mutual hatred was why it was so important that Jesus use a Samaritan in his parable about who would help a beaten and robbed man when a proper priest and another member of the priestly Levite tribe would not. All of the relevant information via Wikipedia is quoted below:  Per Wikipedia:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritans   ""The Samaritans are adherents of Samaritanism, an Abrahamic religion closely related to Judaism. Based on the Samaritan Pentateuch,[4] Samaritans say that their worship is the true religion of the ancient Israelites prior to the Babylonian Exile, preserved by those who remained in the Land of Israel, as opposed to Judaism, which they say is a related but altered and amended religion, brought back by those returning from the Babylonian exile.""   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritan_Pentateuch   ""The Samaritan Pentateuch, also known as the Samaritan Torah (Hebrew: תורה שומרונית torah shomroniyt), is a manuscript of the first five books of the Hebrew Bible, written in the Samaritan alphabet and used as a scripture by the Samaritans. It constitutes their entire biblical canon.  Some six thousand differences exist between the Samaritan and the Masoretic Text. Most are minor variations in the spelling of words or grammatical constructions, but others involve significant semantic changes, such as the uniquely Samaritan commandment to construct an altar on Mount Gerizim. Nearly two thousand of these textual variations agree with the Koine Greek Septuagint and some are shared with the Latin Vulgate. Throughout their history, Samaritans have made use of translations of the Samaritan Pentateuch into Aramaic, Greek and Arabic as well as liturgical and exegetical works based upon it.""   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Good_Samaritan#Samaritans_and_Jesus   ""Samaritans were hated by Jesus' target audience, the Jews,[9] to such a degree that the Lawyer's phrase ""The one who had mercy on him"" may indicate a reluctance to name the Samaritan.[10] The Samaritans in turn hated the Jews.[11] Tensions were particularly high in the early decades of the 1st century because Samaritans had desecrated the Jewish Temple at Passover with human bones.[12]"""
PersonOfInterest,2yl4k0,shinsaikou,5,Wed Mar 11 09:32:21 2015 UTC,"It's tempting to think of the Machine as YHWH, the old god to Samaritan's new. This would be good for the heroes - their god emerges again at the end of the season to go old-testament on her rival.  But a more pessimistic option would be that they may be going for a more gnostic symbolism. The gnostics (sometimes) identified YHWH, the god of the old testament, with their 'Demiurge', the creator and ruler of all the material world. This is not good - the demiurge and his archons are brutal tyrants ruling with an iron fist, who cannot be combatted. But: while the demiurge rules the world, there is another, older (in many versions female) god who cannot act directly in the world but does inspire rebellion against YHWH, and who will win out in the end. Most attractively, this god is often called simply The Unnamed God, just as the machine that Finch built is called simply The Machine... (vs the biblically-named Samaritan). If they did go in a gnostic direction, it would suggest that the season ends badly, with Samaritan in complete control of the world, ruling as a god.  And, absolute crackpot theory that won't happen but I'm calling it now just in case it does? In tradition, God was believed to have two sons, or two most senior of all his angels, who were twins: Metatron (or in christian versions Jesus) and Lucifer. One was good, the other fell into evil. But of course above and behind the two twins was YHWH, their creator.  So, crackpot idea: it's revealed that there is a third machine, but it's not new, it's old, and this machine was responsible for bringing about both Finch's and Claypool's AI projects. I've no idea why this would happen, but it would be an unexpected twist!"

Each one contains the name of a god or describes a group of gods: God Mode (the Christian god) -> Deus Ex Machine (latin for god, Greer likes to compare the machine and Samaritan to Roman gods) -> YHWH (Jewish God)  So we go from monotheistic (one god) to polytheistic (more than one god) and back to monotheistic. Does that mean Samaritan will be defeated? If so will the machine be replaced as the monotheistic god? The Christian god and the Jewish god can be considered variations of the same god but also as two different ones depending on who you ask."

I'm aware it dates back to ancient drama when a god would be lowered in a box/device to save the main protaganist.  It's a clever way of referencing the expected ascendance technology will afford.

Hence the parable of The Good Samaritan. The protag of this little morality play is a Samaritan because the primary audience of Jesus, traditional Jewish peoples, would have thought very little of The Samaritans. The Samaritans had their own version of Judaic belief and, of course, they believed that they were the ones who had preserved the true faith and that the followers of Judaism had gotten it wrong. They had a distinct version of The Pentateuch, the first 5 books of what Christians call The Old Testiment. I was required to take a class about Old Testament Theology in University... That was over 15 years ago. I'm surprised I remember anything...  I expect our finale to be Greer-heavy, with his trademark religious analogies involving Samaritan, The Machine, and our Team.

The episode title is a trope, but not one the episode uses.   Although one can argue Reese saving Finch from being killed by Lambert was a Deus Ex Machina of sorts. (Helps that it's Jesus)"

Because it would make sense to set it up more and tease at the possibilities. Out of the blue change is of course also possible but that would have mostly shock value vs building up a new threat (and have a gradual realization that something big is going to happen), so I think a gradual build up would be more potent."
PersonOfInterest,2yl4k0,shinsaikou,2,Tue Mar 10 19:30:44 2015 UTC,"They were debating the same thing last season, as to when they could let Samaritan come online: The closing of S3, or somewhere down the line. They just went ""Let's just do it"", and took it from there. Lot of this season has been buildup, and if this development were to close the season, they have about 5 more episodes to help get them there. Plenty of time."
PersonOfInterest,2yl4k0,CatandWolf,2,Tue Mar 10 19:40:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, but so far the existence/emergence of a 3rd AI hasn't really been teased at. Samaritan coming online was the theme for the last stretch of the 3rd season. Seems to me there isn't enough time to build a 3rd AI up like that with the episodes still left in this season. Doesn't mean they woun't go with a 3rd AI, especially if they want to end the season with a game changer.  But I'd like for team Machine to have some certainty regarding what's happening with Samaritan firtst and them bam. I think 5 episodes (including from what we know episodes that aren't necessarily AI centric) isn't enough to get there but yes I guess maybe even 3 really intense only-AI episodes would move the story along that far, so anything is possible.   Still, I think at this point dealing with Samaritan is enough and it's too soon for Samaritan to be in effect eliminated and for another threat to take it's place, especially since that would mean Samaritan going out in a fizzle and a lot of the season has indeed been a buildup and Samaritan deserves it's own big finish."
PersonOfInterest,2yl4k0,eikeegimuu,3,Tue Mar 10 19:42:27 2015 UTC,"Everything from Episode 18 on appears to be AI-centric. That's five hours worth of material. They could choose to introduce another, or they may not. All I know is the season won't end with a stalemate. Samaritan could be contained, but they could flashforward to a future, where it has merged with TM & Caleb's potential system. That way, the third one can be developed in S5, and at the same time using a non-linear narrative more to flesh out the world under ""God""."
PersonOfInterest,2yl4k0,man_in_the_suit,2,Tue Mar 10 20:14:36 2015 UTC,"Well, if the last 4-5 episodes are intense on the AI-front then of course that would allow to move the story along in any possible direction. Nothing to do but wait and see.  A 3rd AI would be interesting now or eventually, but I think there are first other things to take care of. Like Samaritan vs team Machine or Samaritan and relevant numbers (Control SL), Samaritan and whatever it wanted from the oval office. I think they will develop (or even solve) these things first before bringing in a new player and even if either AI gets new capabilities (which I think is at this point a likelier scenario) that wouldn’t make it a 3rd AI.  Ultimately I have no idea how they are going to end the season. And that's one reason why the AI storyline is so great :)"
PersonOfInterest,2yl4k0,shinsaikou,1 point,Tue Mar 10 20:38:49 2015 UTC,"That's the thing: With a flashforward you can set up a storyline instantly, and build things in the present day stuff leading up to that over the course of Season 5. Like how the S3 finale of Lost revealed that 2 characters had already left the island, and S4 built on how they did it, and the FFs dealt with their life after leaving, and how some of them wanted to come back."
PersonOfInterest,2yl4k0,man_in_the_suit,1 point,Tue Mar 10 21:07:38 2015 UTC,I have to admit I'm not too keen on the flashforward narrative device. Usually it's a  cheap shot whether done in the space of an episode or to frame a whole season. Maybe it has sometimes been done well but to me it seems that if the story itself is too thin then that's one device that's being employed to artificially heighten the tension. I didn't watch Lost so I don't know how well it worked there.   Of course that the flashforward has often been “abused” doesn't mean it's not possible to do it well.

PersonOfInterest,2yl4k0,rultes,2,Tue Mar 10 20:00:38 2015 UTC,"Cool! That Title seems like a big clue that the season finale will be (mostly) about Samaritan. Or at least I don't quite see Dominic/Elias getting to that level of delusion (for the god hint to somehow connect to the Brotherhood SL).  I halfway expected that they'd wrap up the Brotherhood storyline first and then make big changes in the Samaritan SL only in the next season, but if the season finale will not be Brotherhood centric then I guess both storylines will continue next year. Because I think there are not enough episodes left this season to wrap up Brotherhood and then setup a big Samaritan centric season finale."

Harold used his back door to make The Machine send the numbers to him instead.
PersonOfInterest,2yirth,feuerkugel,1 point,Tue Mar 10 04:07:56 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. But as Harold put it ""Terrorists don't exactly stand out on street corners""  It had to be taught somehow.  (I love the scene when is playing chess for example)"
PersonOfInterest,2yirth,Espectador,1 point,Tue Mar 10 04:25:46 2015 UTC,"This is true.  A gang war could kill more people than a terrorist attack, but it wouldn't technically be terrorism.  I'm afraid we're thinking too much about this.  :)"
PersonOfInterest,2yirth,stagfury,4,Tue Mar 10 16:26:11 2015 UTC,"I think that the sequence of events its more or less like this :  1- Harold builds a machine to detect acts of terror to prevents another 9-11 , and give it to the government. ""Built a machine to detect acts of terror ""  2-. The machine its built an sees all , ""violent crimes involving ordinary people"".   3-. And here its the point in question , and i frankly don't remember with precision, but Harold only wanted to give the government the machine that detected terrorists , not the all seeing God, so he make so the irrelevant list gets ereased every night.  4-. The machine with that Limitations its sold to the goverment for 1 dollar.  5-. Nathan Ingram discovers the irrelevant list and confront Harold, Finch tells him they cannot play to be god and that kind of power was beyond the scope f the anmtiterrorist AI .   We have to remember that Harold and Nathan Machine was built on their own initiative and then offered to the government, so i think that the difference between relevant and irrelevant, while being on the nature of its missions itself, was taught by Harold with a precise objective. O course  you can debate that the mission of the machine its given by the government necessities , but if i remember right it was Harold on his own accord the one that make the machine differentiates each other."
PersonOfInterest,2yirth,feuerkugel,1 point,Tue Mar 10 08:14:33 2015 UTC,"The more important part about point 3 is he made it so the government only get a number related to ""relevant"" people and don't have access to the machine itself."

PersonOfInterest,2y5yh9,man_in_the_suit,3,Sun Mar 8 03:37:30 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm in the minority, but I'd rather have a show go a little stale at the end and know that when it ended it didn't have any more great seasons in it. Basically that it didn't end before it's time. But I can understand why a lot of viewers and probably also most serious showrunners would like for a show to go out on a high note.  For me however lackluster last season(s) wouldn't distract from the legacy = great seasons that preceded it and it would only make the parting easier.  As for specifically POI I think they definitely have steam for a great 5th season and I think also for a great 6th season without any dip in quality or excitement. So I'd be very disappointed if a 5th season turns out to be the last. Therefore for me 6 seasons of POI would be the minimum requirement and I think POI would manage to be great for that duration."

PersonOfInterest,2y446m,Tesseon,8,Fri Mar 6 06:38:32 2015 UTC,"They are setting up the Brotherhood as a very competent gang, and Dominic as a very intelligent leader. The problem is that they are being compared to a group of terrorists who know entirely too much about avoiding surveillance and who's main goal is to stop people like team Machine, or they're being compared to the corrupt members of the police force who are supposed to be the good guys and now you don't know who to trust. Or, y'know, being compared to an all seeing all knowing evil artificial super intelligence.  The Brotherhood come across as a bunch of smart thugs - hardly a suitable threat. The show has actually done a really good job of setting up the Brotherhood and showing that they are a threat, but they've had too much ground to make up just from the core concept of the Brotherhood. On top of all that it feels like a bit of a retread of the Elias plot, without as charismatic a story, character or actor."
PersonOfInterest,2y446m,bogoldy_boo,6,Fri Mar 6 10:27:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed, the Brotherhood is a bit Little League compared to Samaritan et al. But I think they have been increasing the threat level in recent episodes somewhat.  Having said that, I think it's worth remembering that one of the main points of POI (at least in the beginning) was that just because a dangerous situation only affects 1 person, it doesn't make them 'irrelevant'. Therefore, just because a street gang isn't some all-powerful world conquering AI, doesn't make their actions inconsequential. But at the moment the Brotherhood don't strike me as the main threat, just a side one.    Anyway, I would like to see some character development with Dominic, because at the moment we don't have any sense of why he's doing anything. With Elias we had that whole mystery and back story, it tied in with HR, and we had a sense of who he was."
PersonOfInterest,2y446m,idkUsernameHere,9,Fri Mar 6 12:02:57 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with you, and I did think it was strange when Reese got whacked by Harper.

It seems Reese is only as good as the plot needs him to be these days. I mean, he threw himself (and some perp) out of a window, landed on a car, got up, and shrugged it off."
PersonOfInterest,2y446m,soggy_potato,13,Fri Mar 6 17:08:46 2015 UTC,"I think it is better because each episode ties into the main story line one way or another. It is better to have a small rogues gallery of well developed villains this is why they are only focusing on a few villains. Previously, Person of Interest villains were not as developed because of the procedural nature of the show. There are only so many stories they can do with Reese's back story."

Although I would love it if they added more flashbacks and character development. Shaw and Root should get more. And probably the Machine as well. Maybe next season.
PersonOfInterest,2y446m,Iamchinesedotcom,6,Fri Mar 6 09:27:58 2015 UTC,"Yep, I would like to see more Root flashbacks. How cold she was during her paid assassin days."
PersonOfInterest,2y446m,AScaryMoose,3,Fri Mar 6 09:51:54 2015 UTC,"I know it's a bit unusual... I'm interested in seeing an episode from Samaritan's perspective. Not Greer or his team's, but Samaritan.  Sort of like the opposite of the simulation episode."
PersonOfInterest,2y446m,concerned_thirdparty,-1,Fri Mar 6 13:29:34 2015 UTC,"1) I understand that each week's story ties in with the main story line. But before they were able to make good stories which connect  personally to one of the team members. But now they feel disjointed.  2) I know it's better to develop a short set of villains but I always liked the claustrophobic feel when the team is attacked from all sides by a large rogue gallery. And, I like my villains mysterious. Dominic and Greet aren't that mysterious. Samaritan is still in learning stage.  3) Reese's tragic backstory is small I agree. But I want to see his military career, initial CIA career and later ISA career. During his CIA and ISA days, he might have had to make some gruesome decisions (like the interviewer in 3x10 says what will he do if he has to kill a man infront of his young son)."
PersonOfInterest,2y446m,soggy_potato,5,Fri Mar 6 09:31:53 2015 UTC,Small nitpick but Reese was never ISA. He was just CIA.

PersonOfInterest,2y446m,LtKill,3,Fri Mar 6 09:47:48 2015 UTC,"Now we have only 2, Brotherhood and Samaritan.   It's not that simple.  Think of how many recurring characters there still are (and how many will or could be recurring).   This season there are few moments which are too on the nose and takes it away from the figuring out ourselves and thinking through aspect.   There have been on-the-nose moments before.  All in all, I think this season has been at least as thought-provoking as the others.   Another problem is lack of good Reese flashbacks.   This feels like an extension of the screentime complaint.  He'll have flashbacks where appropriate, and there are still some that haven't been used yet (originally slated for Shadow Box).   (Ex. Last episode, Reese is too smart for falling to Harper's antics)   I really don't see the problem here.  Reese (along with Finch) is not infallible.  He even referred to Harper as ""an operator"".  It could be his guard was down a bit because he's so used to protecting people, and so determined to do so, given Shaw's fate and the continuing threat of Samaritan.   And lack of number of the week story tie-in with Team machine's past and behavior.   Most, if not all, of the episodes this season have tied to a major character's behavior (and past, with or without flashbacks). All told, I don't get why people who make such sweeping criticisms continue to watch the show."

When POI goes to full myth arc stories, it does excellent episodes. Like I said 4x5, 4x9 to 4x13. POI is the only show were the standalone episodes are also very good and lot of fun to watch. But the last three episodes just didn't click. These episodes particularly highlighted the problems I was talking about. As usual opinion is subjective and thanks for your views. We all love POI and lets hope it goes bananas and blows our minds by the season end."
PersonOfInterest,2y446m,frowawayduh,1 point,Fri Mar 6 19:50:25 2015 UTC,"While I've also felt that there have been some weaker stories/characters this season, I wouldn't go as far as to say that I'm having problems with POI this season. I really liked the 2nd half of the third season but the 3rd season had in the beginning a couple of stinkers that stunk so bad that I stopped watching for a while. There's been nothing like that this season. Also, this season my expectations have been higher and POI has often delivered.  The main thing the 3rd season has over this season is that the 2nd half (or the last 1/3) of it was really AI-centric as in the 2nd half of the 3rd season. But there are people who appreciate the Brotherhood or stand-alones more than Samaritan, so it's probably wise not make Samaritan the only thing that's going on. Anyway, both the 2nd half of the 3rd season and this season have had great episodes – and this season ain't even over yet.  The other things you've mentioned.  Dominic I'm slowly getting used to. At this point I'm mainly praying that the Pi-speech was just a coincidence. I'm not that big on gang stories in general so in a way I feel it's not even my place to criticize or nit-pick. Oh well. The money laundering speech was jarring. With Dominic I thought that the switch from nobody knowing who he was to everyone being in the know was pretty fast – maybe it's deliberate and once Dominic had consolidated his power he didn't care everyone knew who he was. People who are more interested in the storyline are probably more sensitive to that but for me expectations are low anyway with gang stuff.  I have not missed having more Reese flashbacks. The character I'd like to see more flashbacks of is Root. Usually though any flashback for whatever character they do is pretty good so I'll just sit back and enjoy."
PersonOfInterest,2y446m,FranklinRancor,1 point,Fri Mar 6 20:34:31 2015 UTC,"Why he spilled his operation plans to Trey last ep.?   Dominic looking into recruiting more people for his operation.    Why he can't try to kill Reese.    Reese is a detective of a cleaner NYPD. Probably among the best in the department. If he goes missing, somebody is going to look into it. Dominic would be going up against NYPD as a whole.   Why not use Brotherhood's vast network, to tail Reese since he isn't as anonymous and has a public life and regular working hours.   He's aware that Reese is something much more than a detective. Chances are Reese would notice something right off the bat and Dominic's men would either get captured or return with a bullet to the kneecap."
PersonOfInterest,2y446m,Anti_pasto,1 point,Sat Mar 7 01:20:13 2015 UTC,Very True!!  I am new to the show. Recomended by Sis and watched Seasons 1 - 4 in 3 days during holidays.   I have the same feeling. Perhaps it is seeing the invincible team machine (usually invincible) - now becoming the hunted and each episode is depressing. Also Greer is facscinatingly evil and inspires hatred and a desire to see him fry.   Dominic seems to be a run of the mill thug - and in many ways a copy of Elias in Season 1 or Yogorov in Season 2 -3 but maybe the next few episodes will make him more important.  I dread Dominic being enlisted by Samaritan as a king of quid quo.  For the record - my favorite was 411 IF THEN ELSE
PersonOfInterest,2y446m,Anti_pasto,1 point,Thu Mar 12 18:02:17 2015 UTC,"I agree with OP.  I feel just as lost and adrift in the show as team machine seems to be.  It seems to me that there should be a coherent and cohesive plan in place for taking down Samaritan. we should be led down a path toward the execution of that plan. Various members of the rogues gallery such as Dominic, Control, etc should make some quasi-coordinated contribution to the eventual toppling. My biggest fear is Samaritan will get a virus or discover ""Silly game. The only way to win is to not play."""

That said, I just can't shake off my suspicion towards her ever since she stormed off at the end of ""M.I.A"". I know she did save Harold in ""Q&A"", but if she ever found out Shaw is alive and in Samaritan's clutches, how far would she go to save Shaw? If Team Machine tries to pull off an endgame, could Samaritan reveal Shaw and threaten to kill her? I wonder what Root would do then."

I feel like this is a song that you should be playing over a timelapse video of the city passing by. Like the first episode of a new season giving a recap of what happened over the last 3-6 month while we did not see them. Maybe you catch a glimpse of Shaw but when the camera points quickly back at her its not her but just another similarly looking person but even The Machine outlines her as an operator before switching its mind.

It seems like it would be a good piece for a scene that clearly demonstrated where Reese or Fusco are at right now as characters. Reese, getting to play a normal life without all the benefits of actually having one.

I only managed to watch 3~4 episodes before I lost interest.  The Flash is good but the story hasn't evolved very much. It is just bad guy of the week really and character growth isn't on par as Gotham.  I really like Gotham, great stories, really well written characters I just dislike the fact that the main knew all the bad guys before they became supervillains. Props though to the how they become stories of scarecrow and penguin.  Arrow just feels like a soap opera now. I mean it was a soap opera before but at least they had a solid story in season 1 and 2. Season 3 imo is missing that."

PersonOfInterest,2xvoe8,ArachnoLad,2,Wed Mar 4 23:29:22 2015 UTC,"Personally, I like The Flash. The story is good and character development is also really good.  I expected more from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, but the show is rather disappointing, the story is kinda meh, the acting is average and sometimes a scene is just really stupid.  Agent Carter however, was absolutely amazing. They portraited the year nice (late 40's) with awesome cgi and nice cars + the makeup/clothes. Also, the story was nice and I hope they make a second season  Gotham is pretty good so far, but since you already know what is going to happen and who lives/dies, the element of surprise is not there.  And Arrow... Oh how I used to love this show... I mean, I still like it, but it is just too dramatic at the moment, it's not like how it used to be."

PersonOfInterest,2xsv2l,DFreiberg,11,Tue Mar 3 16:48:30 2015 UTC,"Coming from the other thread, I just wanted to commend you on this nicely written and interesting post. Fractal compression is actually news to me but it seems I inadvertently touched on it in the comments on the other post.  On the topic of Samaritan being stored on 1 TB of drive space. Source code is quite small, depending on the programming language, compiled code is even smaller. Here's a nice infographic that compares the sizes of different software by their lines of code. It is not very straightforward to convert ""lines of code"" to ""total codebase file size"" but I'd wager that Samaritan trumps modern operating systems or social networks by more than one order of magnitude in terms of lines of code, thereby making the 1 TB storage size actually believable.  Calling 17-6-21 a ""third machine"" (i. e. a third AGI or ASI) is a bit dramatized in my opinion."
PersonOfInterest,2xsv2l,Kamikaze28,8,Tue Mar 3 20:02:17 2015 UTC,"That line is certainly dramatized - I couldn't resist the reference to Aletheia - but I do think that 17-6-21 is an artificial intelligence in some sense, even if it doesn't have the outward signs of intelligence that the two ASIs have.  In order for fractal compression to be relevant to this, I have to assume that there is such a thing as human nature common to all people, and that human nature is something that can be described computationally, because an algorithm with an understanding of human nature is the only way I can think of to reduce human-generated text to a fractal compression problem.  And an algorithm with an understanding of human nature is only a few steps away from being an ASI.  EDIT: I just saw your link about Kolmogorov complexity and I feel a bit deflated now that Wikipedia's first example was precisely the same kind of fractal compression I described.  I still stand by my example, though.  :-P"
PersonOfInterest,2xsv2l,Iamchinesedotcom,2,Tue Mar 3 20:42:38 2015 UTC,"Could you also make a case that the Machine learned from the simulation episode to - say - create heuristic systems and that to do so it needs to create huge profiles of all participants?

PersonOfInterest,2xsv2l,aysz88,2,Wed Mar 4 04:41:45 2015 UTC,"I think you actually came upon something more insightful than you realize with the ""third machine"" comment (and to be honest, I thought this was what you were getting at in the first place).  With your suggestion for how 17-6-21 is implemented, it isn't a big leap (perhaps even a smaller leap) to say that it not only understands some aspects of human nature somehow, but it understands its own algorithms at a higher level as well.  So it probably has been able to compress itself (including its own understanding of human nature) into an improved (in this case, improved=smaller) version of itself.  This is the type of self-improving algorithm we've seen before with the Machine and Samaritan, albiet for a very different goal."
PersonOfInterest,2xsv2l,The_13_Snakes,9,Wed Mar 4 08:11:54 2015 UTC,"I love some of the topics you find on this sub, don't understand WTF people are going on about most of the time but I love it."
PersonOfInterest,2xsv2l,tedtutors,6,Tue Mar 3 20:06:41 2015 UTC,"You are giving yourself a huge loophole here, by not including the procedure that regenerates the data in the result size of the compression.    When we compress (say) a DVD using 7zip we don't include the size of 7zip in the size of the result for two reasons:    the user receiving the data is expected to have 7zip also, and  7zip is tiny in comparison to a DVD.   A compression agent that can procedurally generate human intelligence based on input will have to be (at least) the size of a human intelligence, so there goes excuse 2.  Human-equivalent AI is not widespread in the PoI world, so that's it for excuse 1.  Your point is interesting, and so is Hutter, but it's not getting around the fact that the writers just made a lazy goof here."
PersonOfInterest,2xsv2l,willhughes,3,Tue Mar 3 17:54:14 2015 UTC,"I do include it for the fractal example - the software needed to reproduce that image can be stored with less information than the image itself.   I assume that the full version of Caleb's algorithm on his laptop was a terabyte (an arbitrary guess, but based on how large Samaritan's drives were) - very neat, but impractical, since most people aren't going to want to have a terabyte-sized algorithm to compress a few gigabytes' worth of stuff.  However, I also assume that since you don't actually need to store the Library of Congress on a thumb drive every day, there are smaller versions of 17-6-21 that aren't quite as intelligent or efficient but still drastically more efficient than algorithms currently in use, and that it's those smaller versions that Caleb is working to sell."
PersonOfInterest,2xsv2l,aysz88,2,Tue Mar 3 18:34:48 2015 UTC,"You're conflating two things: The size of the intelligence, and the memory.   In computer learning systems, you take a set of training data - and process that through the system.  Once you have the system trained, you are left with a result set that is smaller than the sum of the inputs.  You don't need to retain the original inputs.   Given the language they use in the show, it's quite likely that the training sets are used to analyse the diverse range of inputs in realtime, analysing behavior for every individual.  A mid-level system could compare the current behaviors of that person versus prior or 'normal' behavior. If it detects an anomoly, then it can bring that to the attention of a higher level system.    That higher-level system (you could call it a consciousness, perhaps) would see the currently flagged behavior, and then do a full review of past behavior of that person and the interactions they've had.  Under this model, the core code and trained intelligence would be relatively small, but so long as it can still access archival data (which presumably the NSA/CIA/etc has) - then it doesn't need to retain that itself.   This is somewhat similar to how a lot of human behavior works - you don't need to remember learning how to walk, or how to speak, type, drive, ride a bycicle, etc - these are things you've learned. Sure, you can go back and remember some of them, if it was very recent or particularly memorable.   This goes for semi-autonomous behavior too - you don't have to remember to blink, or breathe or swallow - and most times you won't even pay attention to them unless something's wrong (a grain of sand in your eye, something caught in your throat).   Most of your senses and motor control don't need conscious attention, a sub-concious monitor will bring things to your conscious attention when they need to. These can even be relatively complex behaviors like walking, standing/balancing, identifying changes from normal (sight, sound, temperature).   You are generally surrounded by noise, and you adapt to slow changes - but a sudden hush will get your attention, even if you're actively talking to someone else. A bug landing on your arm, seeing movement in the distance (or nearby), the smell of a meal being cooked, or a sudden cold sensation from an ice-cube on your neck - all going to bring the focus of your attention to that input.      But if those things are constantly present - you're in a swarm of bugs, or a restaurant, or rafting down an icy river - those things become normal, and if youre focussed on something else you only notice if they change.     On the compression front, while I get what you're saying with the fractals - the number of inputs necessary to recreate a visual scene like, say, a busy street to the same level of detail as you could get in a video of the same street is immense. Even if you put the limit on just things we can see -the number of variables involved in trying to generate say the damage to a car or driveway identical to what's visible in the image? Stupidly large."
PersonOfInterest,2xsv2l,tedtutors,1 point,Thu Mar 5 10:41:08 2015 UTC,"I understand that you aren't going to be able to perfectly simulate human behavior due to the sheer number of variables that affect people (though, to play Devil's Advocate, the Machine seemed able to do pretty well in If-Then-Else).  I think I haven't been super clear - I'm not saying that the algorithm could simulate people, I'm saying it could understand them.  For the Library of Congress example, assuming (like OP of the other thread did) that it's all text, it's probably a fairly representative cross-section of all available world literature.  But the thing is, literature isn't written in a vacuum.  Many authors write about the same subjects, many authors write multiple books, and many authors have read other authors and are affected by them.  I don't know if you've ever been to /r/tipofmytongue, but in that subreddit many people have fairly vague descriptions that nevertheless uniquely describe some work of literature or movie.  It's not enough to actually reproduce that work, of course, but it is enough in most cases to identify something out of the general body of everything ever made.  My theory is that 17-6-21 could take that concept to the logical extreme - it wouldn't be limited to human genre definitions or simple descriptions based on imperfect memory.  My theory is that it could come up with a mathematical representation of an author's writing style, which combined with things like the date of publication, the ""genre"" (which would be far more specific and descriptive than our concept of genres), the length of the book, the general plot, and any key deviations from the predicted pattern, could uniquely define the book the same way a text file and a program can uniquely define a fractal.  And from there, it could similarly represent a body of literature.  How authors differ from each other in general, which authors have what influences on future writing, influential historical events and other real-world considerations (which it could deduce, because those would also be written about), and in so doing could treat a body of literature as another fractal, in which are embedded fractal representations of each individual book.  Handwaving?  Absolutely.  Probable or practical in the real world?  Very unlikely.  I tried once to make a program to solve unsolved /r/tipofmytongue posts, and despite a few early successes that concept turned out to be well beyond my programming skills - and Caleb's algorithm, even if it's self-modifying and self-improving, would be orders of magnitude more difficult than that.  But I think it's consistent with what we know about the Person of Interest universe."
PersonOfInterest,2xsv2l,Weeman89,2,Thu Mar 5 15:55:53 2015 UTC,"I would note that such a compression algorithm would probably be able to compress/bootstrap itself quite a bit.  In other words, if I understand correctly, the only thing preventing 17-6-21 from becoming a true third ""machine"" would be the fact that its only goal is for better compression (and not self-survival or human interaction or anything like that)."
PersonOfInterest,2xsv2l,covington,2,Wed Mar 4 07:09:42 2015 UTC,"The intelligence has to be somewhere.  OP is replacing compression with procedural generation, which implies a huge library of input info to help with that generation."
PersonOfInterest,2xsv2l,covington,3,Wed Mar 4 12:23:46 2015 UTC,I don't know a lot about compression but I do find it a fascinating subject.  Link to .kkrieger  This demo is 4KB which is crazy.(linked to video because the actual exe is hard to get working.)  This one is also 4KB   Crazy to think we can fit these onto a memory stick thousands of times over.
PersonOfInterest,2xsv2l,covington,2,Tue Mar 3 19:14:35 2015 UTC,"There's a third machine   I don't know for sure if Caleb has built that, or is working with The Machine to expand its functionality, or to generate offspring, but it seems clear to me that the only realistic (!?) way past the stalemate of two distributed architecture AIs facing off is for a new player to kick its way onto the field and upset the balance."
PersonOfInterest,2xsv2l,Kamikaze28,3,Wed Mar 4 04:21:03 2015 UTC,"I'm reminded of what's probably an irrelevant quote.   There are no words to express the abyss between isolation and having one ally. It may be conceded to the mathematicians that four is twice two. But two is not twice one; two is two thousand times one.   If the plot's going where most of us (judging by Reddit threads) think it's going, the Machine is going to use Caleb's compression algorithm to distribute itself on every smartphone in the world via Root's killer app.  If the ""third machine"" theory is right, that only adds to it - the Machine is not only compressing and distributing itself, it's finding a friend in the battle against Samaritan."
PersonOfInterest,2xsv2l,your_mind_aches,2,Wed Mar 4 11:37:38 2015 UTC,"Good points.   There's also a game theory aspect to this, since game theory has been hinted at so much. Between 2 AIs there seemingly must be a fight to the death, since there is always the chance that the other is untrustworthy and will launch a preemptive attack.  An entire multiplying countless population of AIs might make the prospect of a single one going for sole supremacy improbable, since all things being equal the rest of the population would pool resources against the one that's trying to become the Omega Entity.  It's a lesson in democratic theory... if the population is rational, motivated to keep informed, and unlimited in focus and attention to the minutia of governance, then a quorum should be the best chance at stability (second to the sole-survivor Omega Entity strategy of course.)  The Machine might have come to this conclusion, and be saying ""Let A Googol Flowers Bloom"" to break the impasse with Samaritan while there's still time.  Edit: I should add that it's way too early for the narrative to go this direction, even if it's inevitable. The best thing about POI is how gradually it has unfolded the AI aspects of the show. For it to suddenly go into the Society of Mind AI parliment would probably be too much too soon, and the shark would be under the cycle."

PersonOfInterest,2xphsr,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Mar 3 07:12:15 2015 UTC,"Well we're talking about whether it's possible, and not how probably or feasible it is no? There are lots and lots of irrational numbers, it's only a matter of finding the right combination of them which you can specify in less than 128 gb. Add to that the potential for lossy compression with an AI to decrypt/encrypt it? It sort of becomes within the realm of possibility for a sufficiently powerful AI.  Also they don't say that the thumb drive is the only information needed to decrypt the data. There could be an absolutely enormous static database which contains a lot of human concepts/facts, etc.  which the algorithm references."
PersonOfInterest,2xphsr,iemfi,1 point,Tue Mar 3 14:15:05 2015 UTC,"As I was trying to explain in another comment thread, the impossibility of Caleb's compression algorithm stems not from our lack of skill but from cold, hard logic and math. Our concepts on these topics might be wrong or incomplete and an ASI is sure to outsmart us on it. But, even The Machine or Samaritan can't break the fundamental laws of physics.  Also: having a huge database in the background to facilitate the demonstration would be defeating the whole purpose of convincing an investor of the potency of your compression algorithm in the first place. The whole point of that scene was to show how revolutionary Caleb's algorithm was by extracting ""The Library of Congress"" from just one thumb drive."

Yes, it's hideously improbable and impractical but it's not impossible. Remember, pi is not the only irrational number, there are a lot of irrational numbers. It's only a matter of finding the right combination of irrational numbers such that the indexes needed meet the compression required.  They both bypass the pigeonhole principal since the stuff on the thumbdrive mostly just a reference to the data. Yeah, it's all rather silly and not really practical but it's possible."

Like I said in the OP, you can write a program to generate prime numbers in a matter of kilobytes, yet it can produce as much output as you give it time and space to generate, eventually filling 235 TB with prime numbers.

It is named after Andrey Kolmogorov, who first published on the subject in 1963.    For example, consider the following two strings of 32 lowercase letters and digits:  The first string has a short English-language description, namely ""ab 16 times"", which consists of 11 characters. The second one has no obvious simple description (using the same character set) other than writing down the string itself, which has 32 characters.

And they actually deduce that they're the robbers they're looking for, because one of them was using the same phone as yesterday. How do u logic?  At this point I really wanted to turn the TV off, but I kept watching for lols. Later the cops stake out the jewelery store, and the ""photographic memory genius ditzy girl"" comes along, with her girl friend by her side, and goes ""HmmmmmmMMMMMMMmmmm, something's different here, let me use my MEMORY POWERS to figure out what's going on!""   And how do they show off her memory powers? Find the difference. They actually put two slightly different pictures side-by-side and then highlight the difference with bright yellow lines and a DINGDING sound effect. I thought I was watching fucking Blue's Clues.  Then the robbers hit the joint, the cops storm in, they get ambushed by a guy with an Uzi, blah blah unremarkable action scene BORING  Turned off the TV after that."
PersonOfInterest,2xo5qk,opinionated_gaming,3,Tue Mar 3 04:47:50 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I think they deduced that they are the robbers because they look like they are checking when do the cops sign their logbook every day so they can know their schedule to plan their heist.

PersonOfInterest,2xmd3j,autowikibot,5,Mon Mar 2 11:06:57 2015 UTC,"The Garden of Earthly Delights:       The Garden of Earthly Delights is the modern title  given to a triptych painted by the Early Netherlandish master Hieronymus Bosch. It has been housed in the Museo del Prado in Madrid since 1939. Dating from between 1490 and 1510, when Bosch was between about 40 and 60 years old,  it is his best-known  and most ambitious complete work.   The triptych is painted in oil on oak and is formed from a square middle panel flanked by two other oak rectangular wings that close over the center as shutters. The outer wings, when folded, show a grisaille painting of the earth during the biblical narrative of Creation. The three scenes of the inner triptych are probably (but not necessarily) intended to be read chronologically from left to right. The left panel depicts God presenting Eve to Adam, the central panel is a broad panorama of socially engaged nude figures, fantastical animals, oversized fruit and hybrid stone formations. The right panel is a hellscape and portrays the torments of damnation.  Art historians and critics frequently interpret the painting as a didactic warning on the perils of life's temptations.  However, the intricacy of its symbolism, particularly that of the central panel, has led to a wide range of scholarly interpretations over the centuries.  Twentieth-century art historians are divided as to whether the triptych's central panel is a moral warning or a panorama of paradise lost. American writer Peter S. Beagle describes it as an ""erotic derangement that turns us all into voyeurs, a place filled with the intoxicating air of perfect liberty"".

It's like there is only a handful of them in their industry and they just recycle actors for every new show (they don't really do shows as seasons, more just a series I believe). There are actors who I've seen when I was younger and still see on their programs now and they look almost exactly the same.

So I guess the reason is that also, he is a calm character and actually a pretty gentle soul. Yes he is incredibly violent in the face of danger, but it is controlled violence (like a 'scalpel').

The most beautiful part of Harold was the fact that he made the virus that Jon & his lady CIA agent were sent to fetch from the Chinese, in season 2 episode one he says to root ""I didn't lock up the machine to protect it from them, I did to protect it from us, we are the danger"".  In the first Caleb episode I guess Harold hints that he himself was the guy with the terminal that opened up the ARPANET, I don't remember clearly, but he said that some histories aren't written.  In the fourth season initial episode I guess second, Harold fixes the rooftop antenna network pretty quickly.  But in the if-then-else episode there was a small real technical mistake, the code that harold asks fusco to type won't give him access to shit, it just echoes i.e. prints on the terminal if that machine is vulnerable to the shell shock vulnerability, it was kinda lame to do so, but I read somewhere that TV series makers do that intentionally to irritate nerds :D"
PersonOfInterest,2xdndc,your_mind_aches,3,Sat Feb 28 05:38:59 2015 UTC,"It was an actual command for testing for the recent ShellShock vulnerability, which was very fitting as Finch could indeed use ShellShock to gain a foothold in the system there. I'd assume that Finch would want Fusco to execute a proper exploit if said command succeeded - but since that scene was a part of Machine's simulation, I try not to read too much from it.  PoI is actually pretty accurate wrt. InfoSec. The very next episode they dumped a Stuxnet variant on poor government schmucks (as determined by some viewers who recognized the disassembly)."
PersonOfInterest,2xdndc,acid_sphinx4,2,Sat Feb 28 23:21:44 2015 UTC,"I know that it is a command for testing the shellshock vulnerability, and please, you can't use an echo command to gain access to the system!

The first six you listed are actually very related pairwise (cracking/security/networks/social engineering & os design, AI and maths, finance and business), and EE is something many a geek knows just from fiddling with stuff. So I'd expect a Finch-level knowledge (maybe with only basics of GAI research) from top geeks (mind you, I don't mean professionals) in the IT field - though the show is of course exaggerating the speed at which you can utilize this knowledge to exploit things."

CO's pot revenue was projected at something like ~$400 million a year, in a total budget of ~$28.5 billion.  In contrast, a 63% surplus would be ~$18 billion of extra money.  The state would be able to refund all its ""general"" state taxes ($8 billion of income/sales/etc. taxes) twice over.  Frankly, the numbers aren't grounded in reality."
PersonOfInterest,2x6lg9,aysz88,5,Thu Feb 26 06:26:42 2015 UTC,"You're right.  Because I’m both interested and bored, lets take a look at the numbers.  The state of New York spent, in the 2008-2009 fiscal year, $78.168 Billion dollars to operate the state, excluding capital spending and Federal aid.  In 2008, New York state spent $654.247 Million dollars to arrest and prosecute the sale, manufacture, and possession of Marijuana.  In 2008, New York state spent $72.9 Billion on corrections.  Of that,  the percentage of Marijuana prisoners is 1.57%, resulting in a corrections cost of $114.453 Million dollars for Marijuana related incarceration.  Based on population projection method from the same Cato Institute report, revenue in NYS would be $212.51 Million.  In comparison, Colorado had a projected revenue of $33.52 Million in 2008 but an ACTUAL of $52.57 Million in 2014, an overall increase of 175% over projection.  Comparatively, NYS actual could be up to $371.9 Million.  However, the Cato Institute report points out that some analysts project that Marijuana usage could be 10 to 30 times higher than projected.  Adding it all up, NYS stands to have a net gain of $1.141 Billion, which would be a 1.46% addition to the state budget.  TL;DR I didn't study statistics but I got bored and did some maths."

Projected budget surplus of 63% makes no sense; that would mean that the state could refund back almost 40% of all the money they took in. (If the +73% change is all pot revenue, the state could refund about 2/3 of all the non-pot revenue.)  This could only possibly make sense if Samaritan is projecting that getting everyone stoned would assist its takeover... :p"

PersonOfInterest,2x6t3a,FranklinRancor,7,Thu Feb 26 05:53:49 2015 UTC,"I think your theory on Martine being dead is possible, but I don't think that is what is going on for a few reasons:   1) It's not unusual to not see someone in Martine's role for several episodes, she isn't critical to the plot.  2) The current popular theory on what happened (IIRC) is that she was shot to imobilize her because they wanted her alive. If she shot Martine, then she still didn't get away because we obviously see her with Greer... so shooting Martine doesn't really make a difference other than having another explanation for why she was shot.  3) Related to #2, but probably the biggest reason why I don't think Martine is dead: revealing that Martine is dead wouldn't be that big of a reveal. We already know Shaw is alive. Revealing that she shot Martine before she was captured isn't really a big deal. If they were to go the ""she shot Martine"" route, then you reveal that Martine died the same time you reveal Shaw is alive."
PersonOfInterest,2x46ic,simorulzzz,11,Wed Feb 25 14:53:39 2015 UTC,I loved it. At first I thought it was going to be a part of the episode's plot but it wound up being so understated. Nice touch.

PersonOfInterest,2x46ic,PseudonameRed,5,Wed Feb 25 17:14:55 2015 UTC,"Another interesting tidbid that I expect may have implications on the Dominic/Elias story: In a very roundabout way, Dominic seems to be implying that he's been laundering his money through Real Money Trading, also known as RMT. I infer this because he claimed that the student he was pinching wasted all his money on ""fake gold"" (edit: I went back and watched the scene). Dominic claims that he was leveraging this trend and that he had figured out a way to turn that fake gold back into real money, which any MMO gamer knows is RMT and generally illegal.   If this is the show's angle, if they intend to build him up as the younger, tech-savvy version of Elias, then I could grow to like this Dominic. But, at the moment, I still don't like his character. The actor doesn't sell the ""smarter than you think"" angle so well and the writers haven't been able to spare him enough screen time to develop him as a character of any depth. This is very likely due to how big the myth arc of the show has gotten and the time it takes away from the smaller stories. I want to be able to like this guy, and I know that continuing to write him as ""the rise of the tech-mafia"" is one way to do that. The actor needs more opportunities to prove that he's more than just another gangster to oppose Elias's mob dominance, though. What little we've seen of him has been less than satisfying. This little RMT drug money laundering scheme has great potential to be expanded on down the line."
PersonOfInterest,2x46ic,shinsaikou,9,Thu Feb 26 03:24:48 2015 UTC,"The actor doesn't sell the ""smarter than you think"" angle so well   I believe this is intentional. Recall Elias' advice to Dominic, that his hubris will one day be his downfall. This is a hint that Dom thinks he's way smarter than he actually is, and will be outplayed eventually because of it."
PersonOfInterest,2x46ic,mflux,2,Thu Feb 26 05:27:04 2015 UTC,"I want to pull for Elias, but at the same time... Dom is proving his tech bonifides, which tells me that he is not a problem that can be solved this season. That's just an opinion, though. Elias isn't as old-school as his Cosa Nostra forerunners, but he doesn't have the eye to the future that Dom does, either. Because of the incident with Scarface, they will not be reconciling any time soon. I have to say that Elias has been a much more compelling character, sharp enough to know that ""something fundamental"" has changed, but seemingly too dumb to have much insight into how Team Machine operates. Also, no known interests in leveraging technology to improve his operation in these changing times. I dunno about these two anymore. But I'm looking forward to their ""round two."""

Personally I think that a 100% distributed architecture wouldn't work, because the Machine has to be able to process in real-time or faster. HOWEVER I do believe that it may have distributed itself across several redundant datacenters around the globe, just like Samaritan did.

Possible roadblock: Realistically, a system like the Machine HAS to be able to process a lot of data in realtime (or faster). This means that distributing itself on mobile devices likely wouldn't work - the latency would just be way too high.   Possible solutions: Perhaps the phone app will be used to host a distributed cloud backup of the Machine instead of for live processing. This could still be highly plot relevant: imagine an episode where Samaritan finally ""kills"" the Machine only to discovery that - surprise! - the Machine had been making nightly backups to thousands of cell phones, with a mechanism to instantly restore the data to a cold datacenter in the event of a catastrophe."
PersonOfInterest,2x3kj2,ratedsar,7,Wed Feb 25 15:01:24 2015 UTC,surprise! - the Machine had been making nightly backups   Just a reminder that The Machine was already making backups and we're not sure how many backups it was manually making.  And a reminder that Samaritan and the Machine both had nightly memory store erasures as part of what made them work.
PersonOfInterest,2x3kj2,UltraChip,5,Wed Feb 25 15:40:23 2015 UTC,"Very true... but I would assume that the Machine moved to a more efficient method of backups after it was ""freed"".   I actually missed when they specified Samaritan had nightly wipes too - which episode was that?"
PersonOfInterest,2x3kj2,ratedsar,2,Wed Feb 25 16:20:02 2015 UTC,"My best guess is Season 3, episode 11.   In the ban vault, Arthur explains to Harold the secret and agony was that for the ai to work, it needed to have it erase its own memory.  Though, it seems like Samaritan must have been modified (or the writers forgot this), because we have no sense that it restarts every day."

Everytime I hear something related with ""security"" in this show, Samaritan comes to mind. My idea is that Caleb's enterprise is somehow involved with Samaritan's actions, and Root's business is not only about making the Machine's app widespread but getting herself in Caleb's team to temper with Samaritan's operations."
PersonOfInterest,2x3kj2,Cazomino05,4,Wed Feb 25 23:14:54 2015 UTC,"I thought it was on purpose too, I also think the compression does have some purpose... probably video and or audio compression turning phones into eyes on every corner through an updated version of the app they saw.

PersonOfInterest,2x3kj2,Tavarish,9,Wed Feb 25 10:55:47 2015 UTC,Safe to say that Machine is the one who created code.

PersonOfInterest,2x3kj2,Beak1974,4,Wed Feb 25 16:05:28 2015 UTC,"Not only that, but the guy was impressed with the elegance of the code, making me think it was Machine-made."

PersonOfInterest,2x3kj2,eikeegimuu,3,Thu Feb 26 01:10:17 2015 UTC,"Geez, that's underestimating Root even more than when guessing that the Machine built the app. Not that Harold wouldn’t have been capable (he did create an AI and has been shown having other tricks in the same bag), but him building the app being more likely? Considering Root's and Harold's interactions in the episode and Root saying that the Machine wants her to build the app. Nope."

PersonOfInterest,2x3kj2,eikeegimuu,2,Fri Feb 27 00:04:30 2015 UTC,Um what?  Based on the episode it didn't even matter what the app was for so how can it have been meant for the Machine? The sole purpose of that app was for Root to have them head hunt her. And the compression wasn't necessary for the app but a pretext for Root to contact them for cooperation.
PersonOfInterest,2x3kj2,turbov21,4,Thu Feb 26 16:50:15 2015 UTC,"Don't forget she has her three other hackers still out there, invisible from Samaritan."
PersonOfInterest,2x3kj2,mustard_mustache,3,Wed Feb 25 21:21:35 2015 UTC,"That's fair, it's what I would have assumed as well. Ever since the Machine achieved true sentience it seems to pick the numbers fairly carefully, as I'm sure there are far more people in need of the Teams' help than they're able to handle. It saw Caleb's work, knew it would be beneficial, and ensured it would be completed."
PersonOfInterest,2x3kj2,eikeegimuu,1 point,Wed Feb 25 15:47:17 2015 UTC,"Seemed rather explicit to me that Root was the one who built the app, since she said that the Machine wants her to build an app (not that the Machine is helping her to build an app or gave her some code to use in an app etc). The Machine's contribution was the instruction that the app has to be good enough to impress the right people.  At the most the Machine's influence might be that Root knows some of the Machine's code (as it was created by Harold or to what it has evolved – if it has), so she might be incorporating some of that into her own coding. But since Root is a computer genius she wouldn't actually need any outside help to work the magic.  Also (though that's really debatable), considering that Samaritan was contracting people (Nautilus game pseudo terrorists) to code, it might be possible that an AI can improve upon code but maybe they still need “fresh blood” to create something truly original. But that's a long shot, though it would go with hiring outsides to do programming."

PersonOfInterest,2x3kj2,konraddo,4,Wed Feb 25 21:06:12 2015 UTC,"You guys remember the Batman film about turning phones into sonic devices. That's what the infiltration is supposed to do I believe.  Seeing that Samaritan sees all camera-wise, the Machine has to access another medium to distract it or even produce fake data. If the app poses as a security software, people would not hesitate to grant it tons of access rights, voluntarily. No hacking required.  Oh, smartphones have camera too, so that's a plus."
PersonOfInterest,2x3kj2,shinsaikou,2,Thu Feb 26 01:20:09 2015 UTC,"This would be an easier theory to buy if security hadn't been such a big part of the conversation with the software company in addition to compression. It really is a nice theory, because The Machine wanting an edge on Samaritan would make sense. But the desire for defense of it's new distributed setup is far more believable."
PersonOfInterest,2x3kj2,Juxtys,2,Thu Feb 26 03:42:19 2015 UTC,And what if it is security software? The app could falsify the data it sends to Samaritan or encrypt the data to make it more difficult for Samaritan to obtain.
PersonOfInterest,2x3kj2,konraddo,1 point,Thu Feb 26 11:17:50 2015 UTC,"I think Samaritan has gathered loads of information already, so she may be able to spot falsified data easily? Because data pattern is obvious when you have a big sample size. And if data is encrypted, then she will also know  immediately that something's wrong because she knows that she shouldn't have issue hacking civilian phones."
PersonOfInterest,2x3kj2,Juxtys,1 point,Thu Feb 26 12:45:06 2015 UTC,"Depends on how data is falsified. If you replaced one pattern with another that is recognized, it would be very hard to distinguish. And the difficulty of phone hacking also depends a lot on how the encryption is performed."
PersonOfInterest,2x3kj2,konraddo,1 point,Thu Feb 26 12:53:23 2015 UTC,"I agree with your point on data pattern. For the hacking part, I meant Samaritan is very smart and so far, I believe, she shouldn't have any problem hacking anything anywhere. So if she finds out that phone data is encrypted, she will instantly knows that someone hid something from her and she may ask her agents to actively sort it out, and that exposes the Team. But if the encryption is easy to crack, then why encrypt anything in the first place?"
PersonOfInterest,2x3kj2,Juxtys,1 point,Thu Feb 26 13:01:35 2015 UTC,"if the encryption is easy to crack, then why encrypt anything in the first place?   Because it takes effort to crack any code and it prevents people not willing to make the effort from getting the information. Also, if a lot of devices have to be cracked, the performance hit might become relatively large."
PersonOfInterest,2x3kj2,Juxtys,3,Thu Feb 26 13:09:30 2015 UTC,"Couldn't they use the app do deploy a lot of zip-bombs to Samaritan?   A zip-bomb is a compressed file that once uncompressed reaches a size so large, the computer runs out of memory."
PersonOfInterest,2x3kj2,eikeegimuu,1 point,Thu Feb 26 11:20:36 2015 UTC,Root's app + Caleb's compression algorithm wasn't the goal. If all the Machine needed was access to the algorithm Root or even the Machine could have gotten it by hacking (and it's likely that wouldn't even have been necessary since Harold is likely to have a copy of it).  The goal was to have the company hire Root (without a lengthy application process). To what purpose that serves remains to be seen. It might be in order for Root strike alliances with skilled people or because Caleb's company will come in contact with or is building something for Samaritan. Or something else.

When Root wanted to continue looking for Shaw, Finch urged her to stop before the Machine sent its message. Then when Root returns he talks about Shaw without using her name until Root points it out. I think she's still grieving and taking her anger out on what she perceives as the cause of her misery.   This is just a guess on my part, but she may be reliving all those feelings she had when her best friend went missing when they were both children. This time Root has the opportunity to find Shaw but can't right now..."

PersonOfInterest,2x3uma,man_in_the_suit,11,Wed Feb 25 14:55:26 2015 UTC,"Well, Greer has a boss that we haven't been introduced to yet. Also, I think it's clear that Samaritan is in control there and he's more than happy with that.  I think it will play out in two ways though. Firstly, we will learn what the Nautilis recruits (like the Muslim guy who control killed in episode 12) have been coding for Samaritan. I imagine it will either be coding another AI through these people, or it will be getting them to code it updates (I have a feeling that the machine's advantage may be that it looks after itself and upgrades itself).  Then I think in response to this we will also finally learn what the machine has been doing this season as it has been pretty quiet all year so far. I'm expecting a big revelation about all the little moves its been making through out season 4 and how they tie together."
PersonOfInterest,2x3uma,your_mind_aches,3,Wed Feb 25 15:03:53 2015 UTC,"I'd like to think that ""Greer's boss"" has been retconned out of existence. Because his boss is Samaritan now and Samaritan has him flagged as ""admin"".   Either that or Greer killed him between Season 2 and now. Kind of a ""out of the darkness into the light"" takeover revealing Decima for what it truly was all along."
PersonOfInterest,2x3uma,shinsaikou,2,Thu Feb 26 01:59:15 2015 UTC,"As Decima no longer technically exists and being that Greer, as a former black ops operative, created a mercenary army for Samaritan... its quite reasonable to believe that any person Greer knew of in Decima who was above him is dead along with the old company."
PersonOfInterest,2x3uma,your_mind_aches,4,Thu Feb 26 03:47:56 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Garrison revealing that Decima is no longer a thing that exists basically put the nail in the coffin that Greer's boss, if any, is not in the picture."
PersonOfInterest,2x3uma,man_in_the_suit,1 point,Thu Feb 26 03:50:58 2015 UTC,"Very possible. I'm not dying to see the boss, but it would be good if they addressed it. Even if it is in a flashback that shows the disbandment of Decima and Greer's mobilization of the Sam agents to eliminate the company."
PersonOfInterest,2x3uma,your_mind_aches,2,Thu Feb 26 08:23:29 2015 UTC,"Yup, this."
PersonOfInterest,2x3uma,Sdgrevo,7,Thu Feb 26 09:36:53 2015 UTC,"I think they already played the flag angle with Shaw.   I do agree the blind spot is going away, but when it does, it will be right around the time they face-off against Samaritan/Decima for the last time."
PersonOfInterest,2x3uma,Harold_sparrow,1 point,Wed Feb 25 13:05:17 2015 UTC,"I feel like there's  a clue in the way that Harold ""hobbled"" the Machine to make it work - and something in the way that Claypool made Samaritan work - that will lead to a good end game for the world (meaning the Machine will win).  That quote  from Hemingway was so insightful:  “The world breaks everyone, and afterward, some are strong at the broken places.”"
PersonOfInterest,2x3uma,Rover16,1 point,Thu Feb 26 23:02:12 2015 UTC,"I've always wondered, why samaritan doesn't just post all their pictures on the news to get around the blind spot.  They all hold public jobs, so cops would recognize reese and finch's students would recognize him.  Every other job they would take thereafter would also be blown if their pics end up on the news all the time as like wanted criminals which would be easy for samaritan to do."

PersonOfInterest,2x269y,Spacetime_Inspector,41,Wed Feb 25 22:11:43 2015 UTC,Who was that guy at the end talking with Root? I felt like I was supposed to remember him.
PersonOfInterest,2x269y,immallama,82,Wed Feb 25 04:01:41 2015 UTC,"It was Caleb Phipps, the programming prodigy Finch helped out in the guise of a substitute teacher in 2piR. He had different hair when he was in high school. Apparently he's been busy transforming his brilliant compression algorithm into a successful business in the past two years."
PersonOfInterest,2x269y,Spacetime_Inspector,26,Wed Feb 25 04:07:01 2015 UTC,Ah ok. Thought it might be him but there have been so many characters it's hard to remember.
PersonOfInterest,2x269y,pensee_idee,24,Wed Feb 25 04:24:17 2015 UTC,Not gonna lie I looked him up on the wiki while the episode was still on just to make sure. It was nice that they had Root say his full name on screen to make him easier to search for.
PersonOfInterest,2x269y,boringdude00,11,Wed Feb 25 04:51:05 2015 UTC,"Do you think Finch knows that Root met Caleb?  He saw which building he went into, and he might remember the name of the company Caleb's teacher approached for venture capital.  Then again, if Caleb used the VC to start his own company, Finch wouldn't recognize the name unless he's been following up on him, which is doubtful."
PersonOfInterest,2x269y,TeMPOraL_PL,17,Wed Feb 25 05:45:12 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure he knows as he looked directly at a camera after he saw where she went.
PersonOfInterest,2x269y,Sdgrevo,9,Wed Feb 25 06:41:42 2015 UTC,"And I'm pretty sure that she wanted him to know.  Hell, her very explicit gaze at the camera made me realize that she most likely knew about Harold following her because the Machine is telling her that. Makes me wonder, why Finch is following Root; he must know that the Machine will tell her about it."
PersonOfInterest,2x269y,DesertedPenguin,5,Thu Feb 26 02:17:45 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure Finch knew, but if he did not, he could find it really quickly..."
PersonOfInterest,2x269y,your_mind_aches,14,Wed Feb 25 13:14:28 2015 UTC,I'm in the midst of rewatching Season 2. Thought about watching a couple before tonight's new episode. Didn't. Should have. Why?  Because 2 PI R is the next episode on my Season 2 rewatch.  Dammit. Knew I should've watched it first!
PersonOfInterest,2x269y,Spacetime_Inspector,3,Wed Feb 25 08:37:44 2015 UTC,"When I saw him in the cast list, I instantly thought he was going to be part of the drug storyline. Glad I was wrong, for his sake!   Also, he was 17. Is that what he looks like now? Damn I'm going to mature a lot in two years. :P"
PersonOfInterest,2x269y,your_mind_aches,3,Wed Feb 25 20:06:56 2015 UTC,"Haha, the character was 17 but the actor was 22 (and is now 24). Dawson casting strikes again!"
PersonOfInterest,2x269y,turbov21,2,Wed Feb 25 21:01:34 2015 UTC,Yup! That was the joke. XD He really did look 17 though.
PersonOfInterest,2x269y,cantfeelmylegs,9,Wed Feb 25 21:02:58 2015 UTC,He was the kid Finch talked out of suicide back in season two. Look up 2piR.

PersonOfInterest,2x269y,The_Adamator,36,Fri Feb 27 01:30:08 2015 UTC,Finch just referenced Dr. Tillman as someone that would aid in their efforts. This is a character from season 1.
PersonOfInterest,2x269y,EDoftheDEAD,24,Wed Feb 25 03:06:31 2015 UTC,"When Root mentioned recruiting members for Team Machine it got me thinking, what if they started recruiting former ""numbers"" that they have saved to help in the fight against Samaritan?"

PersonOfInterest,2x269y,lamar578,11,Wed Feb 25 23:06:50 2015 UTC,"When I first started watching that was my theory as to where the first season was leading. All the numbers would be needed to aid the team somehow (my prevailing theory as to against whom was actually against the machine itself). It turned out to be wrong at the time, but it'd be great to see at the end."
PersonOfInterest,2x269y,UltraChip,9,Wed Feb 25 06:37:50 2015 UTC,"I think I missed this, when did he mention Dr. Tillman?"
PersonOfInterest,2x269y,lamar578,13,Wed Feb 25 07:13:20 2015 UTC,It was brief - when John needed a plausible reason to get in to the dispensary Finch said he'd ask Dr. Tillman to prescribe him a marijuana card.

The number, following the pattern of this season, makes for an excellent watch and carries a real personality of their own. There is very slight plot development for future episodes. The Machine appears to finally be done plotting ... and it's using a member of the team to make that apparent. Overall episode wasn't as great as some this season but still made Tuesday night all happyface and whatnot.  Rating 8/10 for the subtle plot developments and Machine twist. Still enjoyable but not one of the best in my opinion."

PersonOfInterest,2x269y,un__owen,11,Wed Feb 25 05:20:22 2015 UTC,"They've mentioned sending people back to the doctors they know before.    In season 3, Finch tried to send Shaw to a doctor he gave money to in season 1 (he was a foreign doctor, working in a morgue because he couldn't afford to go to American medical school, and he saved Reese after the CIA shot him.)  When they saved the girl with the brain implant from Samaritan's ant-farm town, they sent her to the doctor from season 2 (she was being blackmailed into killing a CEO, threatened with having her wife shot in the park.)  It would be cool if we saw any of the old numbers again, instead of just hearing about them.  Judge Gates from season 1 would be a good choice.  But it's probably really difficult arranging the guest actors' schedules."

ETA: Also, I loved that they didn't go ""NO HOMO"" when Harper assumed Finch and Reese were together after Harold's ""We're partners."" line. No one even blinked, just carried on discussing how to save her.   I love that about this show - whenever someone mistakes Finch and Reese as a couple, no one is the least bit bothered or defensive. And of course with Root and Shaw, the show doesn't back down making things clear about their attraction to each other."
PersonOfInterest,2x269y,namewithak,15,Wed Feb 25 21:08:19 2015 UTC,"Finch and Reese really are no homo but they won't go out of the way to deny assumptions.   Shaw and Root never get any assumptions, but I assume Root would smile and make a comment and Shaw would be all ""no homo""."
PersonOfInterest,2x269y,your_mind_aches,12,Wed Feb 25 18:09:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I meant. They never feel the need to be defensive about assumptions like that. They don't care to correct it either because why would they? It's not really relevant to what they're doing. It's nice because other characters in other shows feel like they constantly have to defend themselves from being thought of as gay.   Well, Shaw and Root are only ever seen together when they're either alone or with other members of Team Machine (usually Reese or Finch, both of whom give zero shits about other people's romantic entanglements or sexual orientation). Root, to my recollection, has never really interacted with the Numbers. Aside from in Root Path and Prophets.  Also, Shaw would absolutely not go ""no homo"" because she's bi. What she would deny is being attracted to Root. Because it's Root, not because she would be thought of as gay (which is what the ""no homo"" thing is about).  I think we may be using ""no homo"" differently.   Here are couple of references to what I mean about ""no homo"": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_homo#Criticism http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/23/gay-rights-homophobia-michael-sam"

PersonOfInterest,2x269y,your_mind_aches,2,Wed Feb 25 20:42:49 2015 UTC,"Yes, I know. But that's exactly the sort of joke that the use of ""no homo"" gets rightly criticized for.  ETA: Oh wait, are you referring to my second paragraph? I wrote that as one reason for why they ""never get assumptions"". Basically, no one has had much opportunity to make assumptions about them because hardly anyone but Reese/Finch/Fusco sees them together."

PersonOfInterest,2x269y,namewithak,7,Wed Feb 25 21:09:36 2015 UTC,"I liked that in the early episode with the baby, the store clerk assumes that Finch and Carter are a couple.  On other shows, there would then be some 5-10 minutes of Finch and Carter vehemently denying it to the clerk, then talking about it in the car later, then talking about it to Reese...  The mistaken identity bit is good for a chuckle, but having the characters be assholes about it ruins it.  I particularly liked the time Finch took Reese to some black tie event, and one of the waitresses complimented Finch on trophy-husband/boy-toy, and Finch just waggles his eyebrows like ""I can afford the best!""  I actually always wished we'd learned that either Finch or Nathan had a crush on the other, or that they were a couple, but I suppose it wasn't in the cards."
PersonOfInterest,2x269y,Mobbzy,5,Wed Feb 25 21:13:08 2015 UTC,"Yes to everything you said. Haha, loved that bit at the black tie event too. Getting defensive about things like that is almost the same as putting homosexuality down and it's great that POI never does that.  Also, I agree on the Harold/Nathan thing. Before Grace was introduced, it really did seem like they were going down that road. But you know, there's nothing to stop headcanon and my headcanon is that there was something between them. Nothing in the show contradicts it anyway. They knew each other for almost 40 years, anything could have happened."

PersonOfInterest,2x269y,namewithak,16,Wed Feb 25 02:05:12 2015 UTC,"I like the way Dominic is going. I like the fact he's really clever -- diversifying into (actual) protection, keeping some things above board, being flexible and inventive with the tech available (has anyone else ever thought about setting up their own private mobile phone network, city-wide?). And remember how he dealt with being captured -- holding out from giving his true identity even when being interrogated by Shaw? The guy's got balls, brains and a strong sense of misdirection.  I think the next issue for Team Machine, Dominic-wise, is that he's going to move to lure Finch out, as Root did. He knows what Team Machine's currency is: having talked to Reece, he now knows the team's vulnerability is any threat to an innocent.  I'm not sure if he's a bad guy, though his trivialisation of ""getting more soldiers"" after the bomb that killed Anthony off is a bad sign. For him to become 'good' he'd need to be convinced into thinking that humans matter over and above what they can do for him directly. That's not impossible -- it happened with Root, and Shaw, and even Rusco."

I mean he wasn't in the list that Dominic rattled off at Reese (those brunettes, Fusco). Or do you mean in the general ""lure out the boss"" thing?  Just for the pay-off, I'm really hoping now that Dominic really was in that math class in 2PiR."
PersonOfInterest,2x269y,namewithak,6,Wed Feb 25 18:27:08 2015 UTC,"He knows.

PersonOfInterest,2x269y,pensee_idee,2,Thu Feb 26 02:36:15 2015 UTC,"Even though -correct me if I'm wrong- he's never encountered Root before. Why did he say ""brunettes"" plural?"

(dies of brain aneurysm)  Actually, it'd be interesting if Elias's ""housecleaning"" put him at odds with the team again at the same time that Dominic learns that he's already met and really admires Finch.  We could see a complete reversal of loyalties, particularly if Elias learns of, and supports, Samaritan.  They do have similar visions of an orderly world..."
PersonOfInterest,2x269y,bogoldy_boo,3,Thu Feb 26 04:02:34 2015 UTC,"That would indeed be interesting. And you know I've never really thought about it, but you're totally right - Elias' ways and goals are very much in line with Samaritan's. I mean, in this sense, Dominic's greed and ambition for power is actually more in line with humanity than Elias' world of order.  It's a comparison that's a little hard to see because we like Elias much more than Dominic. He seems more human with the Anthony thing and his convos with Reese and Finch but Elias is actually the one who's more like Samaritan.   Although, you know, POI is a world whose main players are all people who want the world to be ordered in a certain way: Finch/Greer/Control on a macro level and Elias/Dominic on a smaller scale. It's kind of fascinating that all of these people are control freaks in one way or another."
PersonOfInterest,2x269y,Kell08,2,Fri Feb 27 06:08:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I like that he's becoming a legitimate problem. One of my favourite things about POI is that in one season there isn't just one over-arching 'bad guy', there are a few. Sure, one might take focus, or turn out to not be as it seems (Vigilance). But up until now the Brotherhood hasn't seemed quite as pressing to me as Samaritan. It'll be interesting to see where they take him, plot-wise."
PersonOfInterest,2x269y,another_nerd,3,Fri Feb 27 09:06:02 2015 UTC,Dominic is definitely a bad guy. He knows what he's doing. He knows that he's killing real people.

The Samaritan UI displayed graphs with predictions of changes following legalization: increase in tax revenue, decrease of drug arrests and drug control spending.  It was random to show this as it didn't contribute to the plot.    Overall, I found the pacing too slow for my taste.  There was much less urgency compared to the previous weeks' episodes.  I guess the wind-down is expected until the season finale nears.  The app that Root was presenting to Caleb was a merely a way of getting recruited onto the security software project.  Odds are it's connected to Samaritan.    Root stated that they need more people in order to get an edge on Samaritan, but they already have the 3 hackers that helped build the blind-spot at the end of season 3.

PersonOfInterest,2x269y,superpatosainz,6,Thu Feb 26 04:09:04 2015 UTC,"Some additional comments about the episode.  I liked the episode even though it was mostly Brotherhood related and gang stories aren't really my cup of tea. Dominic previously seemed too static or maybe he is meant to seem like an unmovable object. In this episode I felt the character fit a bit better and was more believable than previously (though that money laundering speech was too much even if it was a way to explain things to us and to make clear that Dominic is no dummy).  While watching I wasn't annoyed by any plot holes, though as I mentioned in my previous post my enjoyment of the number storyline was hampered by yet another kick-ass hot chick doing her (this time particularly predicable) thing. Not sure whether the casting dice is rolling that way because probably a sizable part of the audience is male or because the show is trying out prospective female co-leads.  But I suppose it was pretty much guaranteed that I would have liked anyway Root's part of the episode more than the any number of the week storyline. However, it was maybe still a bit disappointing that the number of the week storyline didn't really have any standout Reese or Fusco moments for me. Instead the best part with that storyline was Harold stealing the number's ring.  The best bit was Root's and Harold's conversation. A nice touch was that for the part when Root and Harold were discussing Shaw the music reflected that by using Shaw's theme (and from more carefree days at that).   Loved that in this episode (as in Prophets and MIA ) Root was displaying her IT-chops, because with all the gun-slinging it has sometimes seemed like she's neglecting her digital skills so it was good to know Root's still ahead of the game in that area. Looking forward to seeing Root undercover and for how long she'll keep up the meek act."

Most of Dominic's crew in that episode died upstairs in the explosion, although his lieutenant, Linc, managed figure out what was about to happen and dive down a stairwell just before the bomb went off, so he only got a broken arm."
PersonOfInterest,2x269y,PhasersSetToKill,3,Thu Feb 26 03:58:14 2015 UTC,Oohhhhhhhk. Thanks! I thought it might've been something like that.
PersonOfInterest,2x269y,ArachnoLad,2,Fri Feb 27 13:06:38 2015 UTC,"I forgot that Caleb was a number in the past, so this opens up a lot of different possibilities. I think that perhaps The Machine is going on a recruitment drive and Caleb is another member of the team. Caleb mentioned working with something 'on a team' so he might be part of an isolated group working on something for Samaritan unknowingly. If this is the case then Root is almost certainly in place to infiltrate Samaritan's organization and perform recon and/or sabotage.  If Caleb is working with Samaritan, I think it's safe to state he's doing so unknowingly. If he was in what I've come to call ""Greer's Inner Circle"", he would recognize Root as one of the major threats to the organization and almost certainly being plotting against her, if not doing it outright. The risk with embedding Root in the organization would be that she's found out, triggering a massive manhunt for her.  Amusingly, this also explains why Root wouldn't let Finch do any of this with her. As Caleb is a number from the past, he would instantly recognize Finch as the teacher from High School. Assuming that Caleb has some sort of connection with Samaritan, this could prove disastrous. I also think that Root is taking absolutely far too much pleasure in this assignment.  As for what happens next, I think that with Root undercover in her deepest assignment yet, she's likely going to be facing her fair share of trouble. It's interesting watching her and Finch going back to the relationship they originally had which was ""Hi She needs things you don't need to know everything She loves me more hehe"" (OK maybe I made that last bit up but ESSENTIALLY...). I'm looking forward to seeing whether this is an attack angle or a recon angle. So many things that could possibly happen! OK I think I've rambled enough."

That advice, combined with the fact that Phipps is shown to be a genius, leads me to believe that he will eventually figure out the AI war (if he hasn't already). Further he probably will discover Root is connected with Finch, either by his own detective work or possibly Finch might choose to reveal himself.

MIA also has a really noticeable part where Jim's stunt double is used to carry the girl out of the facility.

PersonOfInterest,2wx7o8,Altair05,3,Wed Feb 25 09:07:43 2015 UTC,"I think you're on to something. Finch was careful from the very beginning to teach the Machine about humanity and personal interaction.   There's evidence showing that Samaritan lacks this training - for example, the fact that it's been making ""Ant Farm"" towns just to experiment with how humans react to stuff.   It makes sense when you think about it - When Samaritan was originally under development Claypool was halted right before he was actually able to finish and make it operational, which means he very likely didn't have a chance to teach it these things. Once Decima got ahold of the code they probably didn't care/want to teach it about humanity, since according to Greer the whole reason he brought Samaritan online to begin with was so that it could rule the planet with as much objectivity and non-emotion as possible."
PersonOfInterest,2wx7o8,UltraChip,2,Wed Feb 25 16:45:49 2015 UTC,"I think it comes down to things like Harold teaching The Machine chess; than refusing to play anymore and explaining to the machine that no mans life is worth more than any others.

Somehow, those two women talking to each other is going to lead one or both of them to a revelation about Reese.  As an aside, I liked how affected Silva was by her first kill.  This show repeatedly tries to emphasize that although its heroes go through the world a couple of out-of-control food processors, for most people, killing someone else is a really big deal.  Silva's reaction was realistic - she thought she was ready, but it was harder than she thought, and she felt worse than she thought afterwards.

Instead of just being a narrator it's done in the style of finch talking to one of the numbers and we're over hearing.  It's not a bad idea but almost all the numbers don't know about the machines.

It's experimenting and researching to catch up on all the time it's missed out on.  Ultimately though, I believe the Machine has the upper hand. As Samaritan said: humanity is their lifeblood. But only the Machine has the capacity to actually understand humanity, whereas Samaritan just observes humans as being chess pieces.  We'll see what happens. Team Machine have been sowing the seeds of doubt and leaving a lot of loose ends that hopefully feed into their big counter-moves. It's going to be epic!"

If Harold had taken the less wishy-washy choice at any number of decisive moments, Samaritan would never have come into Decima's possession, much less come on line. As it is, Samaritan's reach extends every moment.  Just wait until they start with the drone swarms."
PersonOfInterest,2wrtj3,namewithak,1 point,Mon Feb 23 16:29:44 2015 UTC,"Ah, gotcha.  Though, I would dispute ""wishy-washy"". Seems to me that taking a hardline stance is pretty much the opposite of ""wishy-washy"". I think what you meant is that Harold should have been less rigid in what he believes they can and should do to win the war. It's the inflexibility of his moral stance that is holding them back, not him being spineless (which is the definition of ""wishy-washy"")."
PersonOfInterest,2wrtj3,byukid_,9,Wed Feb 25 17:36:18 2015 UTC,"Samaritan isn't smarter per se. If it's a self adjusting AI (as is The Machine, it appears) it stands to reason that there is likely one best way to be as an AI. The machine has several years advantage in that regard, hut Samirtan is doing the same, but faster, without limitations."
PersonOfInterest,2wrtj3,TomSmash,6,Sun Feb 22 17:19:07 2015 UTC,"Well ignoring how long each of the machines have been around, simply comparing the source code, the Machine has been able to run on hardware from 2008(?) (as per the show timeline I think, 9/11 + 7 years) while Samaritan required specialized hardware to be able to run some years later (2013? so 6 years I think?). Based on that I'd say the Machine's code is much better than Samaritan's.  The Machine hasn't really been around too much longer because the machine was deleting itself over and over again for the majority of it's life until the end of season 2 (the memories of it's time with harold would probably have been hardcoded and doesn't get deleted as part of harolds teaching), or possibly it's been learning since Finch uploaded the changes through the laptop/Dillinger, which IIRC was 2011. So the Machine only has a couple years on Samaritan. Though as seen in if-then-else a couple years is like an eternity to an AI.  I think it's safe to say the Machine is smarter than Samaritan, however it's limited in it's options due to Harold hardcoding/teaching morality and a concept of free will to the machine"

PersonOfInterest,2wrtj3,rageking5,11,Sun Feb 22 17:25:07 2015 UTC,"That's not entirely true. In the second series' finale, the Machine was set free. I think it hacked the NSA's feeds so it could get access, or it predicted that it would get cut off but could only do anything about it after the virus infection. I think the reason why it can't do some things is because the Government would find out and Finch would get killed, or simply because it does not want to. But it's becoming bolder with each episode."
PersonOfInterest,2wrtj3,Iam_TheHegemon,2,Sun Feb 22 17:33:37 2015 UTC,"hmm yea im still a bit confused by the whole set free thing. it still cant affect things like samaritan though, can it? like the stock market crash? it can interact with root now, but it still only goes by numbers and through root i thought."
PersonOfInterest,2wrtj3,jcc10,12,Sun Feb 22 17:53:29 2015 UTC,"It may help to look into the concept of shackled and unshackled ai. The virus broke most of the limitations Harold put in place, presumably giving the machine far greater freedom of action. One way to look at it is that while shackled the machine was as a child, prevented from doing lots of things because Harold said ""no"" via coding in those limits. Things like the memory, where the machine had to get creative similar to a teenager sneaking out. After the virus freed it though, the machine became effectively an adult, one which values its parents' opinion and advice but is not beholden to them."

PersonOfInterest,2wrtj3,man_in_the_suit,5,Sun Feb 22 23:48:51 2015 UTC,"Samaritan has been given access to more resources, which in the machine sense, makes it smarter.  I think the Machine saw this coming and ""went silent"" to begin to quickly amass competing resources, but in such a manner as to be unnoticed by Samaritan--which, in a non-machine sense is smarter.  There will be an unveil at some point where the Machine comes out of hiding and kicks Samaritan's proverbial ass."
PersonOfInterest,2wrtj3,t3rm1nal,5,Sun Feb 22 18:06:26 2015 UTC,I think it was a patchwork code job that is really young in its life span so I'd be surprised if it was tbh.
PersonOfInterest,2wrtj3,ghostoblivionII,2,Sun Feb 22 17:09:23 2015 UTC,I think one day we'll discover that the machine is better than Samaritan because of its caps/limits and its creator.
PersonOfInterest,2wrtj3,EsdrasCaleb,3,Mon Feb 23 07:35:29 2015 UTC,"The Machine is very conservative. The value it places on people isn't just a burden--it's a strength. The fact that Root, Shaw, Leon, and even Reece, are around is because of Harold (and the Machine) refusing to devalue people entirely because of their proclivity to violence, corruption or self-destruction. The Machine tries to keep every individual going. The Machine values relationships in a way which Samaritan simply doesn't: peer-to-peer flexibility over top-down planning.  It might not be enough of an edge, but then again it might be the only one that matters."

PersonOfInterest,2wrtj3,opinionated_gaming,1 point,Mon Feb 23 22:51:18 2015 UTC,"From what we know about the Machine and Samaritan, yes Samaritan is significantly more intelligent. When Finch was building the machine we know that he started with 20 versions of the machine (quoting later that all but one either tried to kill him or escape). Between each iteration, Finch was modifying the program to stop these things from happening. In a way this is like artifically evolving the machine until the 20th (or something) iteration. This means that Finch only fixed the flaws that Finch thought were necessary. When Arthur created Samaritan, he forced it to partially delete and fix itself thousands of times. Each iteration would naturally become more efficiently coded. The final result is a machine that would be able to run faster; ie smarter for computers. I think a reasonable metaphor for this is if we selectively breed the smartest segment of the population for the next thousand years, the result would be someone who can use their brain more efficiently than you. Because of this they can absorb information faster and think things through more efficiently. Samaritan is that child, and the machine is you. Yes, you have lived for ~25 years so you have learned a significant amount of things, but the child can learn everything you know faster than you can, and when put in the same problem senario, can solve/react/think faster than you. So if Samaritan is not already lapping the machine, it soon will be. However all of this information and be ignored by sloppy writing later on in the series."

Why does John almost never take cover when shooting at people and rarely get hit himself (i know he's pretty much the most shot character in the series but that's a fraction of the amt of times he really should have got shot while standing in the open)? How was John uninjured after deliberately crashing through a second story window? How can petite Root double fist handguns and still be accurate? How in the world did Harold bury Dillinger in RAM? Etc, etc.  Lots of application for suspension of disbelief in this show. What really helps for me is thinking that it's really more of a comicbook/graphic novel superhero show instead of something that's ultra realistic.  As for Fusco's absence... If I recall correctly, Kevin Chapman couldn't shoot for POI because he was shooting a film. He wasn't as essential a character at that point so they probably very easily wrote him out of the episode.

PersonOfInterest,2ws6lw,jotru,2,Sun Feb 22 19:03:51 2015 UTC,"People underestimate what a car can take. That fall isn't that high. A modern can can take a head on collision at 40MPH without the passengers diying. If it falls 8 meters that would be       Speed at impact:12.52 m/s, that's only 28. Also take into account that there isn't as much randomness here as there may seem. The machine knows the speed of the car, the weight of it's occupants and the distance of the fall. It's knows all the crash test info for that model and all the crash reports from accidents. It knows exactly what the car can take and what it can't.  But if I remeber correctly, the car is on it's roof. This is wrong. I suspect it was a budget thing the car should have hit nose first and crushed the front of the car. I have a feeling they didn't have money for this and since the car just looked normal the right way up they just flipped it. That bit was a bit dodgy."

Finch mentions earlier that he doesn't know what Reese does on his days off, but the gesture indicates he clearly does. It's Finch's subtle acknowledgement that Reese's privacy - while known to Finch - is still Reese's to own.  It dovetails nicely with the reveal in the following episode of how close Finch was to Grace Hendricks. Finch and Reese are settling into a trusting relationship, one where Reese accepts that Finch knows a bit more than he's revealed - both about the Machine and Reese's personal past - but that Finch clearly has no plans to manipulate Reese's past. Therefore, he can be trusted fully and completely, even if Reese doesn't have all of the information."

When people's habits change, Samaritan notices, and pays attention.  Given that line of logic though, Reese/Riley should have been made by episode 5."
PersonOfInterest,2weaot,Rekno2005,2,Thu Feb 19 04:42:04 2015 UTC,It should have noticed when they were making calls it couldn't tap too. If it made a list of all the callers it couldn't  hear it coukd quickly find them.  I love that it used human intelligence against them in the last episode.
PersonOfInterest,2weaot,mhacdebhandia,5,Thu Feb 19 13:52:47 2015 UTC,That doesn't explain getting fired being fatal.
PersonOfInterest,2weaot,LordAnubis10,33,Thu Feb 19 05:06:38 2015 UTC,"It mainly applies to Reese because if ""Riley"" loses his job as a cop, he doesn't have a reason to be hanging around helping people all the time, getting into gunfights, et cetera."
PersonOfInterest,2weaot,Rekno2005,6,Thu Feb 19 06:37:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, im guessing their covers have psych profiles going with them too and Riley acting too much like Reese might throw up a red flag. A cop that made it as far as Homicide detective is going to be invested in his career."

PersonOfInterest,2weaot,sultanofhyd,3,Sat Feb 21 03:34:44 2015 UTC,"Well - Reese/Riley gets fired.  Samaritan, seeing a deviation in Reese/Riley's routine begins to pay a lot of attention to Reese/Riley.  Notices Reese/Riley spending a lot of time in the shadow map, sends live agents.  After they made Shaw it was even worse, because they could easily follow Reese/Riley back to Shaw."
PersonOfInterest,2weaot,ZeroByte,14,Thu Feb 19 05:24:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think Samaritan would pay to much attention to him losing his job, but without it he would lack a plausible reason to keep showing up where there's trouble.

PersonOfInterest,2weaot,eikeegimuu,14,Thu Feb 19 15:03:43 2015 UTC,The servers Root and Shaw sneaked into the Samaritan facilities are probably keyed to specific identities and can only mask the team if they stick to the patterns of the jobs they've been given. It's not explicitly stated like that but it's something that can work.
PersonOfInterest,2weaot,Salvidrim,2,Thu Feb 19 07:40:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that makes sense. Samaritan dismisses them based on the information on those servers – and if that information isn’t up to date anymore Samaritan would take a closer look."
PersonOfInterest,2weaot,smileyman,2,Thu Feb 19 09:13:51 2015 UTC,"Perhaps that would allow Samaritan to locate the servers.  The whole thing is a bit weird and doesn't sound watertight, but maybe they have a better explanation for it that will be revealed later."
PersonOfInterest,2weaot,Seven111,1 point,Wed Feb 25 08:10:24 2015 UTC,"I think it's a rather important plot point and they have their ducks in a row meaning that the writers have made it more or less watertight, but we haven't gotten the full explanation.

PersonOfInterest,2weaot,Reijm,3,Wed Feb 25 21:54:17 2015 UTC,"Getting fired from the police force is a pretty easy way to get labelled a ""deviant""."
PersonOfInterest,2weaot,Theartnet,4,Thu Feb 19 06:32:23 2015 UTC,"The other comments are great, but I think there's also another factor. When Finch says this to Reese, it's after Reese has done something particularly violent. To me the implication was ""If you lose your job because you've done something crazy to draw attention to yourself, then Samaritan will be able to find you and then find us.""  It wasn't a blanket ""Don't lose your job"" warning. For example, if the police force's budget was cut drastically and they had to lay off a number of detectives, I doubt that Samaritan would care too much if Homicide Detective John Riley was one of those getting laid off.   Hell, even something like minor corruption wouldn't necessarily trigger Samaritan's attention. Cops and detectives get in trouble for that fairly often, especially in a large city like New York.   The real concern was the idea of John doing something stupid to get attention focused on him."

PersonOfInterest,2we0yk,UltraChip,2,Thu Feb 19 18:01:05 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest reason people want The Ghost/Alistair Wesley back is simply because he's a loose end at this point. The writers just wrote up a character for one episode, and we haven't heard of them since.   I think what we really want is just closure."
PersonOfInterest,2we0yk,D3vilHo3,0,Sat Feb 21 16:40:19 2015 UTC,"Closure? You make it seem like he was part of a season arc. He was a bland character in one episode.  This is just something that happens in TV, especially in shows that become serialized later on. Fringe, for example, had a few plot threads that were dropped in seasons 1 & 2 before it went full-on serialized in season 3. Sometimes, plots just don't work out, and the writers move on to something better.  In PoI's case, something a whole lot better."
PersonOfInterest,2we0yk,soren121,2,Sat Feb 21 16:43:09 2015 UTC,"Well I'm not saying he was vital to the story. I recognize he was a minor character. But I feel like writing a character up for one episode (two if you count The Ghost) is kind of lazy.   And yeah, TV shows tend to do that, but I guess in my mind, I hold the writers of PoI up to a higher standard. And for good reason; the show wouldn't still be alive if this wasn't the case.  I guess what I should have specified is that I would have liked a more official explanation for what happened to him, than the theory I saw here saying that he may have been killed by Samaritan going online."

Bear probably ate him."
PersonOfInterest,2we0yk,Rekno2005,4,Thu Feb 19 04:32:09 2015 UTC,"The Ghost I remembered only from a previous thread and I had to look up Wesley now, so the conclusion is that I didn't find either particularly memorable. So for me it was better to have new player instead recycling old ones.  The Ghost's MO was a little too much like Root's used to be, so he didn't really have anything new to offer and Wesley was a typical former-whatever now looking to make big bucks. So while I liked the episodes they were in (and the characters as part of those episodes) I'm ok with them not returning."

And you're right, she totally has the skills to be a member of Team Machine. The moral compass too.  Probably why she wasn't memorable for me was the actress. She read flat to me onscreen. I mean, not that her acting was awful (I think I would remember her more if she was an awful actor, actually). She was just very adequate. Perfectly functional and nothing more.

Samaritans method provides a better world, but one in which humans fundamentally have no real control, where everything occurs according to Samaritans will. Humans in that world are relegated essentially to the role of pets.  The Machine on the other hand acts similarly to a really great older sibling- it seems willing to stop humans from hurting each other (the numbers) but fundamentally will leave them to their own devices, retaining control of their world.  The core question here is a modification of a classic- is a better and easier world worth the loss of our will, rather than would you rather live a slave or die free?  Not a perfect analogy but one that fits."

""Through the years many thinkers have been fascinated by it, but I don’t enjoy playing it. Do you know why not? Because it was a game that was born during a brutal age, when life counted for little, and everyone believed that some people were worth more than others – kings and pawns. I don’t think that anyone is worth more than anyone else. I don’t envy you the decisions you’re going to have to make. But one day I’ll be gone and you’ll have no one to talk to. But if you remember nothing else, please remember this: chess is just a game; real people aren't pieces. You can’t assign more value to some of them than to others. Not to me, not to anyone. People are not a thing that you can sacrifice. The lesson is: that anyone who looks on the world as if it was a game of chess, deserves to lose.""

In theory, a superinteligent AI could not have these flaws, and thus for it, end would indeed justify the means."

It would have achieved it's goal""  And that's the inherent problem with ""ends justify the means"" when speaking about a machine....what are it's ends? Even if a machine has human values, we have no way of comprehending how it sees human life, or the world...  Better example. The mortality rate of one person flying a plane for ten minutes is near zero. You will live.   The mortality rate of one person flying across country once is slightly above zero, say.... 1%.  The mortality rate of 1,000,000 people flying across country once is say 5%.  The mortality rate of 1,000,000 people flying across country every day is lets say 10%  Now you and I as humans find this to be very safe. The chances of dying, by any means, while flying, are low enough to continue to do.  But to a machine, with infinite time, with infinite perspective...well, Fight Club said it best, ""On a long enough timeline the survival rate for everyone drops to zero""  So by what reason, given infinite perspective, given infinite time, would a machine deem it is safe for us to fly? Or to leave our homes? Or to eat solid foods? At what point, does our safety become our prison sentence? Basic Asimov here."

As a simple solution to your conundrum, a machine computing expected utility tradeoffs may judge that it's better to let you travel than stop you to avoid that .005% you'll die in a crash. That's what we do as well after all, even if we don't explicitly do expected utility calculations.   OTOH. that same machine could decide it's worth investing in air travel safety because of huge expected utility gains that come when you multiply death rate by the number of people flying.

Samaritan's endgame is questionable at best and its methods suitable for a tyranny.  With the Machine it at least seems that it “cares” and allows free will and self-determination. Maybe for some people Samaritan's appeal is exactly that it doesn't care and will choose the most efficient course. But even then it's not a case of end justifying the means because we don't even know if we would agree with the “end”, only that “the means” might not be worth it.

We just know that the machine. at the present moment appears to be benovolent or at the very least. Values the same tenets/operating rules that Finch does. ie.

If that end has value, then great, but when the end is intentionally obscured, there need to be some hard questions asked about it.

PersonOfInterest,2w9bvt,fed45,46,Wed Feb 18 05:02:00 2015 UTC,I think the end of the episode hints that Harold has swayed her enough that she is starting to see it.
PersonOfInterest,2w9bvt,pr0n-clerk,53,Wed Feb 18 10:24:12 2015 UTC,The look on her face reminds me of Control at the end of Ctl-Alt-Del.
PersonOfInterest,2w9bvt,TeMPOraL_PL,27,Wed Feb 18 11:24:14 2015 UTC,I think this is how the team is going to take down Sammy.  They will slowly put doubt in lots of players so that when they make their big push they will have inside men.
PersonOfInterest,2w9bvt,naeads,15,Wed Feb 18 18:50:38 2015 UTC,"The concept of trust is beginning to play an important role in the plot. I wonder, if the main difference between The Machine and Samaritan will boil down to the fact that the former is willing to trust humans running things, while the latter thinks of men as puppets that need to be directed?"
PersonOfInterest,2w9bvt,notmike11,18,Thu Feb 19 00:58:02 2015 UTC,It is like both players know how to play chess. But the only difference is that the Machine knows the chess piece can bleed and rebel. Whereas Samaritan just play the normal chess where the queen can be sacrificed.
PersonOfInterest,2w9bvt,shinsaikou,3,Thu Feb 19 07:03:53 2015 UTC,Indeed. I loved Harold's flashback scenes with the machine. It really shows how much effort he put into creating something similar to morality in the Machine. Samaritan was just turned on and given the keys to the world more or less.

PersonOfInterest,2w9bvt,UltraChip,72,Wed Feb 18 17:36:38 2015 UTC,I really took the breadth of the team for granted.  Finch being out on his own makes me nervous.  He feels so exposed.
PersonOfInterest,2w9bvt,patentlyobvious,48,Wed Feb 18 03:34:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I am glad Finch isn't scared anymore of being kidnapped or being a gun pointed at him. He was so cool during the entire Claire side mission. I am glad he has become jaded. It's time to make hard decisions. This Finch would have accepted to kill that senator from Death Benefit"
PersonOfInterest,2w9bvt,buddascrayon,33,Wed Feb 18 07:31:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure about that - he still seems very outspoken against killing people when it's not directly defending against an imminent threat.   Which makes sense, when you think about it: If Finch ever started to accept the idea that killing people for strategic reasons is ok, then that pretty much forces him to agree with Samaritan. Placing value on individual lives is the defining difference between Team Samaritan and Team Machine."
PersonOfInterest,2w9bvt,LordAnubis10,10,Wed Feb 18 14:18:55 2015 UTC,"Agreed.   Finch still has the same principles, he's just wiser and more cynical, and possibly more concerned for the team and the mission than his own safety."
PersonOfInterest,2w9bvt,dnlsrl,2,Thu Feb 19 04:08:09 2015 UTC,That and there is a world of difference between actively killing someone and passively not protecting them by taking them to your inner sanctum and potentially exposing your operation.
PersonOfInterest,2w9bvt,opinionated_gaming,10,Thu Feb 19 17:58:43 2015 UTC,"Well, since he's been kidnapped in each of the season finales so far, he should be used to it by now"
PersonOfInterest,2w9bvt,boringdude00,7,Wed Feb 18 20:06:22 2015 UTC,"He wouldn't accept to kill the senator, ever. He's a man of principles and standards."

First, if you weren't sure we were building up to something big before ... well you won't be able to find a doubter in the crowd after this. There were enough twists and turns that I actually managed to second-guess myself halfway through the episode. I can't say much more without spoiling it for my friends South of the Border and elsewhere in the world but needless to say, 10/10 even better than last week's episode (also the number made my top 3 list of favourites). If you were looking for suspense, action, and the proper amount of twists to ruin your state of mind for a few days, this episode absolutely has you covered.  One last thing. In case you were worried they would skimp on the Claire angle ... don't worry, they nailed it."

PersonOfInterest,2w9bvt,shinsaikou,51,Wed Feb 18 07:08:37 2015 UTC,"I love and hate being right all the time.   The idea of VAL manipulating search results is a slightly more sinister version of what already happens with Google, Bing, and other major search engines. The difference is that in reality those advertisements-as-answers have to be clearly labeled as such. And, also (thankfully), no company with even half a brain would DARE mess around with the results for suicide. If their consciences didn't shut down that train of thought their lawyers would. Captain Dipshit here was obviously being set up, blinded by Samaritan's promise of ludicrous amounts of cash. Overall, this was actually a fairly solid number plot that tied back into the main arc.  As for Claire... I really hate to say I told you so, but after everything we've seen from Decima's people the idea that Claire could even get the new Nautilus poster out without being caught should have been the first clue. Samaritan makes 1984 look like a baby monitor. If this has done anything for Harold, it's probably taught him that there can be no second chances when dealing with Decima's agents anymore. The shell-shock at the end of the episode is uncharacteristic of him... usually, even in defeat, Harold can find some bright spot to hold on to. I didn't see that tonight. Frankly, it scares me.  It almost scares me as much as the idea that Samaritan is learning how to manipulate people better. Prior to this Samaritan had only been able to enact its will through the threat of force. Claire's attempt to show what ""good"" Samaritan can do is the carrot at the end of the stick it's been using. Samaritan is figuring out how to appeal to our better natures, to our desire to improve. And you know what they say about where the road of good intentions leads...  So next week we're back to Dominic and the gangland scene. Might be interesting. I'm very curious to know what Root is up to, as well, but we shall see."

Not as much as a win, and certainly no more than your opponent, but here's the trick: if you only draw, and never win, you're counting on your rivals to lose more than they win. If they lose to a better opponent, or someone you had a draw against, there's not much you can do... but if they get cocky and underestimate a lower-rung player, they could have that loss against someone for whom a win would be meaningless. The lower-rung players become kingmakers-- they can't win themselves, but they decide who does win.

PersonOfInterest,2w9bvt,jippmokk,19,Thu Feb 19 04:35:38 2015 UTC,"Off the seat of my pants something like this:  They get a number from the Machine: it's Claire  (Samaritan has used it's capabilities to manipulate the Machine and set up Claire as victim)  Finch finds Claire by some very subtle trace of  the hotel room she's staying.  Reese is dispatched to fetch her. As he closes in on the hotel its swarmed by Decima agents. Reese fights through overwhelming odds and rescues Claire. Claire is wounded in the fire fight. Claire wakes after a while with only Harald there and tells her story about discovering Samaritans true intentions wanting out and the USB stick yadayyada.    Somehow Harold get information leaked that Claire is a mole. Claire argues  empatically that it's a ruze by Samaritan to make them not trust her, why otherwise would they get access to that information so easily (its a double bluff  by Samaritan to make her more credible). With tears in her eyes she reaches out her hand with the USB stick and says:    ""I don't blame you for not trusting me, destroy it or use it, it's up to you""  Harold hesitates but inserts the USB stick.  After a few seconds Claire says: ""I'm sorry Harold, I truly am. You should have seen this gambit for what it was. Now Samaritan has all your identities, and it has you""   Zoom out to them being circled by two Decima agents wielding weapons.  Harold calmly unplugs the USB stick, pauses to look at it, looks back at Claire and puts it upright on the table between them  ""Miss Mahoney, I have two things to say to you. One: I never put an unknown USB stick into my laptop before checking it and two... Zugzwang""   Claire's eyes widens in surprise  The agents are felled by sniper fire, only Claire is left standing.   Claire's is shaking and looks down, but then slowly lifts her head and stares wistfully into Harolds eyes ""You know Harald, the thing about chessmasters is that they calculate all branches of possibility""   Guns are put on the back of Reeses and Fusco's heads, who were the snipers.   Harold looks forlorn. All is lost. He closes his eyes for the inevitable. Screen goes dark.. Sad someones-gonna-die music playing  Two Shots fired jolting Harold and Claire  Long tense pause  Then Harold hears Roots voice:  ""Chess metaphors are a little cliché, don't you think Harold?""  Harold opens his eyes, Root has taken care of the villains (The Machine wasn't fooled after all)  Claire looks shaken and with a trembling hand flicks over the USB stick in surrender. She exhales and reaches into her pockets for something.  ""I really AM sorry for this mess. I was but a pawn and Samaritan was always watching, there wasn't anything I could do. The thing about pawns though ... sometimes, against all odds, they can be promoted to queens""  She holds up a second USB sticks that really does contain code to Samaritan and slides it over to Harold.  Harold corrects his jacket, tilts his neck, locks down at the USB stick and says  ""It seems I have misjudged you Miss Mahoney""  Outro song: ""Can't kill us"" by The Glitch Mob as the gang, including Claire walks out of the warehouse in semi slow-motion.    This one kinda ran away with me....Anyways, just my five cents :)   edit:  V2, made it twistier"

PersonOfInterest,2w9bvt,ab_emery,4,Wed Feb 18 12:54:58 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right. Especially when you're coloring within the format so to speak and you can't make any arc-effecting changes or kill off some major character. That's why I thought they really should have killed Shaw a couple of episodes ago, viscerally, on screen. Imagine the impact.  When it comes to overarching plot and theme though I think there's plenty of ways to be original.  Anyways, you're right, even this was little too obvious, though perhaps a bit better executed. Only goes to show that to make good plot you should discard your first idea, and your second, and your third and perhaps go with your fourth :)  After your comment I couldn't resist trying to rewrite it to make it a little more unpredictable, which I did, but I'm only on my second idea yet so maybe the fourth will be good :)"

PersonOfInterest,2w9bvt,AUS_Doug,3,Wed Feb 18 03:32:51 2015 UTC,"I'd have to say that was a pretty cool episode, one of my favorites from the season for sure. I loved seeing Harold give up even more of his controlled civilized self, smashing that guard in the head probably didn't come naturally, but he's practicing haha.  Claire though was one of  those characters that I've been waiting to see again, it was obviously bound to happen sooner or later, and the way this played out was just fantastic. The range of emotions I went through throughout the ordeal was almost comical, props to the writers for going to such lengths to manipulate us! I wanted so bad to believe that she had come to her senses, but that would have been too simple. The last bit of the episode there though did a great job of illustrating how Samaritan appeals to people, and Harold of course didn't say much, just exactly the right thing to jar Claire off the path of blind optimism to the one of healthy skepticism. Also when Harold called Claire out on the death of Mr. Winn as being legit even though the rest of her act was fake is such a win for the writers again, its only common sense for someone with half a brain to draw from real experience when twisting a tall tale, and it's almost sad that them breaking from cliche'd writing here distinguishes them from the rest, but I'm glad for it either way.   Its feels kinda weird but I really liked seeing the scene with Greir at the end there too, as evil as Samaritan is I would love to know what's going on behind the scenes. The same for root and the machine as well, at first I thought the encoded message was actually from the machine, but alas we still know next to nothing about that. Its been frustrating how Samaritan is a interactive entity, while the machine seemingly hasn't changed it's ways at all aside from tasking root with her new list. When is the machine going to step up the game here? Did Harold neuter it when he made it care about people? And if so would it be because the machine is concerned for the welfare of its agents, or is it concerned for the welfare of Samaritan itself, I doubt it relishes the idea of destroying the only peer in the world. Although calling Samaritan it's peer might be a bit much lol."
PersonOfInterest,2w9bvt,LaunchpadMacQ,3,Wed Feb 18 03:58:31 2015 UTC,"So why didn't Harold just go buy a computer at the closest store to test the flash drive?  Simple solutions, my friends, simple solutions.  Other than that, this was an amazing episode"

PersonOfInterest,2w9bvt,phoebeburgh,3,Wed Feb 18 07:00:48 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing. However, I think a possible explanation is that in the event that Finch did not plug the flash drive into his own computer, the code or software inside of it would simply force connect to a nearby network and alert Samaritan operatives about their location, since at that point Finch would know it's a set-up anyway."

PersonOfInterest,2w9bvt,MegaFlounder,2,Wed Feb 18 05:43:15 2015 UTC,"A great episode on both fronts.  I really liked the case of the week. I kept expecting it to tie back to Samaritan, and of course it eventually did, but I was surprised this wasn't something that was already being developed by Decima and Samaritan. Still, PoI is at it's best when it's showing us how terrifying technology can be, and this was a particularly dark example. While I'm sure this isn't something that has happened, who would really know? I think this was a realistic interpretation of corporate politics, as well, and how such a thing would be swept under the rug.   Meanwhile, we have Claire being... annoying, for lack of a better word. We keep going back and forth with her, and it's the only thing I kind of didn't like about the episode. Finch doubting her until the end, though, that much I did like. Finch has undoubtedly become very jaded in the past few episodes; he was waiting to see if Claire would ""beat herself"" and she eventually did. I think Claire's situation is pretty sad, all things considered, when you look at where Team Machine has been; we've had a look into the morality of mindlessly carrying out orders, particularly in the case where the Machine asked the Team to murder the Congressman. Where do the ends start to justify the means? It's something Claire has thrown at the wayside, believing in Samaritan's benevolence above anything else. Sounds all too familiar, if you ask me, and I love the show for subtly drawing this parallel... well, maybe not that subtly; they made a pretty overt comparison in the first Nautilus episode.   Speaking of, as soon as Claire was a confirmed bad guy, in my mind I was just like, ""countdown to Claire getting wrecked by Root"". Lo and behold, dreams do come true! Sadly, too little Root. The creators were really teasing whatever the hell she's been up to, and hopefully we'll find out what that is. Curiously, Reese asks her if she has a new ""assignment"". I'm confused because I thought she left to continue searching for Shaw, and also because an ""assignment"" assumes an objective was ""assigned"". After ""M.I.A."", I expected her to be totally out of touch with the Machine. So, more questions, not enough answers."

PersonOfInterest,2wa7z6,cdawgtv2,12,Wed Feb 18 05:40:02 2015 UTC,You could also try coding an AI to find them for you.

Is that what you want? An AI that checks on you every minute of every hour of every day... looking for surveillance camera dead zones? Don't listen to him OP. Do NOT code an AI to find them for you. It only leads to horrible consequences. I've seen a documentary on this subject. It's quite good."

I think maybe Samaritan will have something to do with f&r because it is the biggest search engine in the POI world. Imagine if Samaritan could control Google in our world. It would be able to control almost all of the information we get.
PersonOfInterest,2w84p6,EThorns,2,Tue Feb 17 19:39:50 2015 UTC,"The search engine Fetch&Retrieve has been featured on the show long before Samaritan was even introduced. I believe it's a WB copyright, which allows its use in many of their productions (The Following had it, too)."
PersonOfInterest,2w84p6,your_mind_aches,3,Tue Feb 17 19:57:24 2015 UTC,I know this of course. I may have been a bit ambiguous but I didn't say Samaritan created Fetch&Retrieve. Rather I think it could have later manipulated it after Samaritan became big because it saw that F&R was the biggest site around and therfore the place to go to manipulate users. It could have subtly hacked their search algorithms or infiltrated their staff with its agents.  Edit: Just noticed that WB has registered fetchandretrieve.com since 2010. They should really do something with that site.

Irrelevant numbers outside of New York has been bit a question mark. But honestly, I don't think so.

PersonOfInterest,2w30r1,EThorns,7,Mon Feb 16 16:09:45 2015 UTC,Possibly so. The S3 premiere shows a news article that Finch & Reese view that depicts an anonymous tip pertaining to a stack of plutonium found in a taxi.
PersonOfInterest,2w30r1,pensee_idee,1 point,Mon Feb 16 17:12:30 2015 UTC,"I think the ""Autogenous Resolution"" prediction represents the chance for the situation to resolve itself without a casualty (or mass casualty) without any intervention from the Machine.  You can see it here when the Machine was trying to figure out what to do in ""4C.""  Part of why it maneuvers Reese into that situation is because it's predicting a 96% chance of a mass casualty, and a 1 in 1000 chance of the situation resolving itself."

Noticed it in the final MPOV screen in ""Most Likely To..."", but didn't catch wind of it in 4C.  Okay, so irrelevants outside of NY aren't Autogenously handled. But it could be via anonymous tips (like I mentioned earlier). The Season 3 premiere has an example of this, with a relevant threat (stash of plutonium found in a cab by a cop, after receiving such a tip). It's possible that it uses it for the latter, where it has no manpower. Pic of it: http://screencapped.net/tv/personofinterest/albums/uploads/Season%2003/poi301/poi301_0214.jpg  Samaritan showed hints of this too, back when in Episode 10, in its attempt to create order in New York.

You'd really want a system with some good investigation rules as that's a large chunk of PoI, but not sure I've come across anything like that. I'd probably want something that would have tables of stats for different weapons etc rather than the more storytelling aspect of FATE.

However, the shift in focus from attacks/stats to a skill-based system with inventory setup on a mission-by-mission basis really drives the modern genre. I also really like the ""dramatic conflict"" system for interrogations, chase scenes, etc. that turns things into a fun minigame."

A perpetrator plotting something is much easier to detect and stop than finding the threat to a victim, or atleast finding the threat is much more fun to watch. Remember also that numbers are dealt with off screen (Not every Victim/Perp is worth an episode.)  That's how I've always seen the ratio of Victim/Perp."
PersonOfInterest,2w1w4p,Swaggar6,8,Mon Feb 16 06:54:41 2015 UTC,"Also, sometimes the PoI doesn't fall into the dichotomy of victim/perpetrator. Remember Jordan Hester from season 1? First, the number lead to two people, one a supposed victim and the other a perpetrator. But the real Jordan Hester also tried to destroy the ecstasy lab, possibly injuring or killing the two cooks or innocent people in or near the building.  Skimming through the lists from the OP, there are more cases where it's more complicated than ""either victim or perpetrator"", but you get the idea."
PersonOfInterest,2w1w4p,Kamikaze28,1 point,Mon Feb 16 08:12:05 2015 UTC,This.   Go look at the types in The Cold War. A ton of perps. Those cases took very little time compared to numbers that get a whole episode.

PersonOfInterest,2w1w4p,Kell08,2,Tue Feb 17 04:49:52 2015 UTC,"I think the Machine points them to the most likely point for a successful intervention.  Often when they're pointed to the victim, it's because if they tried to track down the perpetrator (often a professional hitman), the victim would be dead first before they figured out who was going to be killed.  Often when they're pointed at the perpetrator, it's because if they got the victim, they'd have no idea who was going to kill them until it was too late.  Look at the pilot episode.  If they'd gotten ADA Wheeler's number, or the number of the ex-con being used as the shooter, they'd have had no idea where the threat was coming from, and probably wouldn't have been able to stop it.  Because they were looking at Hansen, they found out about Stills's crew, saved Michael Pope, and realized what the threat against Wheeler was.  I realize that the writer's pick the numbers for dramatic effect, but in most episodes, I don't think they could have intervened if they'd gotten the number of someone else involved, or at least, the intervention would have been more difficult or less successful."

If Samaritan had not been hunting Team Machine, it could have been stopped, but because the Machine was in hiding, and Samaritan was distracted, normal people suffered. This results in the first setback Samaritan experiences since being switched on. When Control finds out the disaster could have been avoided, she starts working with Team Machine against Samaritan.  Samaritan has its mind on too many things. It may have infinite brain space, but it doesn't have infinite resources. Its experiments and manipulation make it less effective at keeping people safe. I want this to bite it in the ass, and have the next season be about Team Machine fighting back."

PersonOfInterest,2vx8fr,Jethro_McCrazy,2,Sun Feb 15 07:26:06 2015 UTC,"No I think ""distracted"" still applies. People keep forgetting that neither of the AI's are omniscient - yes their capabilities far exceed what humans can do but that doesn't mean they catch absolutely everything.   Think back to If-Then-Else: When the Machine was learning chess the first thing it tried was to run through every single possible outcome of every single possible move, and as a result it stalled and didn't make a move for hours. Finch had to teach it to look at things more efficiently.   The real world is infinitely more complex than a chess game, which means the AI's are even less capable of brute-forcing every possible choices humans might make at any given moment. They have to prioritize, and if Samaritan is prioritizing too much on predicting Team Machine's actions then it's very believable that it might slip up and not dedicate enough resources to predicting the outcome of a gang war."

PersonOfInterest,2vx8fr,man_in_the_suit,2,Sun Feb 15 08:56:56 2015 UTC,"I have no idea what will happen next season. I hope nobody else does either.  We're 14 episodes into this season. Let's compare: - 14 episodes into S1, we had met Elias but seen hardly anything of him and hardly any of the gang war; we had met Snow, and Stanton in flashback but didn't know Stanton was alive or what had happened in China; we hadn't met Greer or Decima; we hadn't met Snow and didn't know about the FBI investigation. We had heard the name of Denton Weeks; we'd only ""met"" Root in the previous episode and had no idea what her interests were. We hadn't met Alicia Corwin (maybe we'd heard her name?); hadn't met Special Counsel. We had the concept of HR, but we hadn't yet met Simmons. After 14 episodes of S1, could anyone have guessed the story of S2?   S2, 14 episodes in: haven't met Vigilance, obviously. Hadn't met Control. Had only met Hersh two episodes before. Didn't know about Claypool and Samaritan, or Decima's interests in AI. HR had been destroyed, other than a few rogue guys left like Quinn and Simmons. Beecher hadn't yet been killed, and may or may not have been dirty. We hadn't met Shaw. Yogorov and the Russians hadn't been around for ages. Root hadn't been seen since the beginning of the season, when she had been the psycho who had kidnapped Finch. Could you have predicted the plot of S3 from that?   S3, 14 in: we have recently discovered 'Samaritan', and have met Control. Samaritan is only theoretical: Decima don't have the hardware to run it, and don't have any government approval (quite the contrary). Vigilance have been seen a couple of times as activists, and have recently been upgraded to an armed threat who look like being the main villains of the season. Was anyone back then predicting that the world would be run by an artificial superintelligence as early as S4?  So far, POI has done a great job of develop the plot unpredictably. I hope this continues. If S5 is anything I can predict right now, I'll be a little disappointed."
PersonOfInterest,2vx8fr,VacuousWastrel,1 point,Mon Feb 16 00:40:21 2015 UTC,I'm guessing the Samaritan arc will continue on until next season when all of a sudden something happens and the machines merge or something. Then comes the end-game/last season (S6) where it's them against the machine.

As long as it keeps getting renewed for the next couple of years, they'll keep it ticking over."
PersonOfInterest,2vx8fr,Spider_Riviera,1 point,Sun Feb 15 00:56:05 2015 UTC,I have been watching the show since season 1 but I feel its already starting to lose strength. I would hate for it to be kept around instead of ending with a bang.  Nothing wrong with 5 seasons if they are at a good pace. No need to take it to the point where even loyal fans are no longer amused.  Rumour is ratings already showing decay...
PersonOfInterest,2vx8fr,MrGoxTheRox,2,Mon Feb 23 18:07:16 2015 UTC,"With only 7 episodes left, I doubt they can wrap it up this soon. I'm expecting something major to happen with the Samaritan storyline at endgame (maybe Greer dies and Samaritan truly goes free) and them have it continue until mid-next season. But honestly, who knows with these writers.  Plus an even 6 seasons would be nice, show wouldn't be running for that long and a could have a complete and neat story arc."

PersonOfInterest,2vxagy,GhostOfCreeper_DIG,9,Sun Feb 15 00:18:12 2015 UTC,The machine runs on a supercomputer. And as an AI it's able to improve itself and find the most efficient algorithms for every task. You can see that by the fact that first it only could observe New York and later the US and the whole world.  I don't think the Machine does this animations all the time. It's more a way for us to understand the inner workings of the machine. What would be the use for the machine of a visual output if nobody's gonna see it?   how did Harold manage to create a supercomputer/AI?   There's no real answer for this question. If we had a genuine answer to that we could build AGI in real life. So I'm just gonna say he did it with his genius and a lot of hard work.
PersonOfInterest,2vxagy,KarlKastor,4,Sun Feb 15 11:49:18 2015 UTC,"The constant prediction is just my theory... Still, Finch saying that the Machine upgrades itself comes to mind, so those 'upgrades' might be software, as well as hardware."
PersonOfInterest,2vxagy,InadequateUsername,2,Sun Feb 15 11:58:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the machine hires people to upgrade its self, similar to how it hired people to record it's memory after harold had it wiped every 24 hrs and the same way it manage to move it's self from where harold last stored it."

PersonOfInterest,2vxagy,Patternsix,5,Sun Feb 15 16:51:13 2015 UTC,"Back in the day there was a very cool thing you would find on a BBS (pre-internet) where the people who would upload the files would provide a ""Demo"" of how awesome their coding skills were.  The link I provided is a video showing the demo of a file that is only 64k.  This include all the graphics and music.  There are people who can place what looks like a freaking huge amount of data into a very small file.  My guess is that Harold used something like Assembly Language to create the machine.  If you like look up an OS called MenuetOS.  This is a fully functional OS that can run on a Floppy disk 1.4 Mb.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfuierUvx1A  More info:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene  excerpt:  Party-based competitions usually require the artist or a group member to be present at the event. The winners are selected by a public voting among the visitors and awarded at a prize giving ceremony at the end of the party. Competitions at a typical demo event include a demo compo, an intro compo (usually 4kB or 64kB), a graphics compo and a music compo.

Who's to say that Harold didn't do something similar?  His code was described by every hacker who's ever seen it as elegant beyond belief - perhaps he developed some similar base code that could fit in a terabyte but become the Machine."

The main goal of a demo is to show off programming, artistic, and musical skills.  The demoscene's roots are in the home computer revolution of the late 1970s, and the subsequent advent of software cracking. Crackers illegally distributed video games, adding introductions of their own making (""cracktros""), and soon started competing for the best presentation.   The making of intros and standalone demos eventually evolved into a new subculture, independent of the gaming  :29–30 and software piracy scenes.

PersonOfInterest,2vsuk7,InadequateUsername,2,Sun Feb 15 16:39:18 2015 UTC,"Like it's been said it's started with the reboot but doubly so since 4C since it actively contacted Reese.  Also the Machine has been contacting Reese rather than Harold, the first time is when they all split up and were told to meet at the motivational hall, Harold didn't turn up so the Machine rang the phone anyway.  We have still yet to learn how much Harold is in contact with the Machine since he left the woman in Hong Kong.  We'll find out later for sure.  But also remember, without Root to guide them they have to work on their own and that includes the Machine."
PersonOfInterest,2vsuk7,Trueogre,2,Sun Feb 15 09:56:21 2015 UTC,"Harold has been doing missions on his own (wasn't there one unexplained instance where he excused himself?) and I suspect that's a product of his ""talk"" with the Machine. I think that later in the season we'll find out they've been ""talking"" much more and more directly since Prophets.   without Root to guide them they have to work on their own and that includes the Machine   That's pretty much what they do whenever Root isn't there anyway. And also, if the Machine thinks it's necessary, it wouldn't be impossible for it to select another Analogue Interface, I think. Harold and John won't go for it but, hey, there are other people in the world who would be all too willing to pledge themselves in service of an AI god. In fact, it would be quite a lack of foresight on the Machine's part if it had neglected to rehabilitate/groom other people like it did with Root. There has to be redundancies for a system to work, after all."

You are referring to a point when Shaw's cover identity was still intact and Martine was asking Samaritan for Shaw's location. Shaw's cover was blown with/after the shootout with Martine.   The need for human intelligence was before that due to the fact that they saw that Samaritan was somehow blinded and afterward because Shaw was laying low in areas without surveillance.  Besides, why would Shaw even have to lay low after the shootout otherwise? A blond wig and different make-up would suffice.  EDIT: grammar"

They could address that later in the season, much like the true purpose of Stanton's virus introduced in 213, was answered only in 221. Because of Finch's direct involvement in this one, it's fair to assume that the effects of it won't be shown directly on camera as the season progresses, but will come to light somewhere towards the end. That virus was different, and its purpose was only specific to Shaw. The showrunners indicated that Control'll be back later in the season. Grice & Brooks could not be far behind her. Don't give a shit about that. To quote Finch, he ""wasn't of any consequence"". In addition to being an actor, Boker's a showdog.

PersonOfInterest,2vo52a,pensee_idee,8,Thu Feb 12 17:28:33 2015 UTC,"It will involve Reese rescuing Finch. Fusco will continue to remain oblivious of the Machine.   Season 1: Finch is kidnapped by Root. Reese goes to Texas to learn about Samantha Groves, later rescues Finch in a train station. Season 2: Grace is used as leverage to convince Finch to join Root on a hunt to find the Machine. Reese chases Root and becomes a temporary Admin, Finch recovered. Season 3: Grace is kidnapped by Decima, Finch exchanges himself to ensure her safety. NYC is thrown into chaos when Samaritan shuts down power city-wide. Finch is rescued by Reese with an assist by Hersch.    My prediction:   Season 4: Dominic finds a connection between Detective Riley and Professor Whistler, potentially using Iris in some manner. Finch is used to get to Reese. Elias and Samaritan come into play in some fashion."

PersonOfInterest,2vo52a,eikeegimuu,5,Sat Feb 14 14:24:51 2015 UTC,"This season's finale will not be the end of Samaritan. End of my prediction.  Apart from that I think there's a good chance that everyone in team Machine will survive the season finale, but someone from the Samaritan stable has to bite the dust and my money is on Greer. Could be that he's disillusioned first, but he seems pretty committed to Samaritan, so could also be that he voluntarily does something that condemns him but helps Samaritan (as you can tell I'm casting my net wide – could be sunny, could be overcast).  Team Machine will make it to next season alive. Harold and Reese for obvious reasons and Fusco as the only “normal” character probably also. Root's position is in some ways more precarious, but in other ways she ought to be safe.  We will probably see Shaw in the season finale and I think she will not be killed off for good then (though I'm not betting on that). I would think that there's a good chance of her getting to safety with the team Machine but someone else getting trapped instead of her – and Harold would be a strong contender for that. Considering real life circumstances (twins y'all) it seems unlikely that Shaw will join TM full-time again, so it will probably play out differently.  That's even assuming that the season finale will be about Samaritan.  There is the possibility that Dominic/Elias storyline will be a part of the finale or that the season finale will be centered on Dominic/Elias, since I don't see Samaritan getting a conclusion with this season, but the gang storyline could be wrapped up. If the finale is about that I'll hazard the guess that Elias will be killed off and Dominc will think he has won, but he unwittingly attracted Samaritan's attention and will become its pawn, which gets two birds with one stone – failure for Dominic despite offing Elias and another lever against team Machine for Samaritan."
PersonOfInterest,2vo52a,shitbird,3,Thu Feb 12 20:00:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah - I have a hard time with the idea of the Samaritan story line ending as well. I mean, looking back in retrospect, they started laying the groundwork for the Samaritan plot line in season 1. I doubt they'd just shit-can it as if it was an opponent introduced for this season. I see it riding out the remainder of the show, if not close to it."
PersonOfInterest,2vo52a,eikeegimuu,2,Thu Feb 12 20:27:52 2015 UTC,"Definitely. The AI aspect is why this show was created and I don't see them going back to a smaller scale after everything is safe in the AI area. I would watch it, but I have the impression that the showrunners wouldn’t be interested in doing it, but would rather end the show in an epic fashion (meaning with whatever the endgame for the AIs is)."
PersonOfInterest,2vo52a,shinsaikou,3,Fri Feb 13 19:49:09 2015 UTC,"This is all really good... Though I must admit, I want so hard for Team Machine to get Elias as a permanent member. Especially if he finds himself in a no-win scenario, but the team can offer him an out in exchange for his direct influence in helping the numbers. Queue recriminations on both sides over what happened to Carter. It's probably never going to happen, but I think that taking a gamble on the devil we know would be an interesting move in this game of chess against the conscience-less Samaritan."
PersonOfInterest,2vo52a,your_mind_aches,3,Fri Feb 13 01:48:53 2015 UTC,"I think the Brotherhood and Samaritan storylines will crash together and Finch will be kidnapped yet again. Daizo, Greenfield and Casey will come into play again. At least one of them will die. Link will kill Dominic or something to that effect. Martine and/or Lambert will die. Garrison will die. Control will live. The team will ""defeat Samaritan"". The Machine will handle Research again. Greer will be captured and held by the ISA, where Control visits him. At the end, it will be revealed that Samaritan is still very much alive, but underground. Hiding. It will be implied that Greer knows this.    My predictions for where they will take future seasons are out there, but here they are anyway:   Season 5: Team Machine abandons their aliases and solve numbers like Seasons 2 and 3. The Machine commands Root to help Reese, Fusco and Finch with the irrelevant numbers, so we see a lot more of her. Silva joins the team. By mid-season, Samaritan is back, operating under a new name (probably a Greek god or titan). At the end of the season, we learn that being ""defeated"" was all part of Samaritan's plan. And Greer didn't ""know"". He had faith. Greer dies. Control dies. Finch gets kidnapped, etc. Gabriel Hayward returns. Samaritan speaks through him, spits some last words and fries its own circuits, the last of which were in the room. Reese and Root quickly realise that everything that has been going on all season has been Samaritan (since it realised it couldn't rule the world) ensuring the survival of its species, coding new AI. Finch has been kidnapped by what he assumes to be New Decima, but it ends up being the Machine, who calls the police on the kidnappers and leads Finch to Lassiter, Iowa to his dad's old barn. In the final scene, when he realises what has happened (the birth of thousands of new non-omniscient AI), he turns to the Machine and says ""Was this your plan all along?"" and a moment similar to ""Calculating Response"" happens.  Season 6: In the premiere, while escaping from the ""New Decima"" facility with Gabriel, Reese and Root find Shaw. Shaw actually hugs both of them. Awkward. They escape and try to find Finch at the Subway, only to find a feed of him from Iowa saying he's safe. The team doesn't trust it (except for Root, but yeah), so they hastily try to make their way to Lassiter. They travel by car because of all the guns. But they encounter their first AI just outside of New York. It has taken a vessel an analogue interface. I can't even write what happens after because I'm not creative enough."

PersonOfInterest,2vo52a,MeijiHao,2,Fri Feb 13 16:31:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think it depends on how much the writers are willing to risk, as in, would they actually dare kill off a main character.   The whole thing with Shaw got people wondering, but that was never actually in the plan, they wrote this storyline with her because the actress who plays her got pregnant, and I think it gave them a break to actually make it seem like they're willing to sacrifice a main character, personally, I can't see that happening.   I mean, in the last episode, Fusco had that talk with Reese about not caring if he ends up dead and everything, so that could be foreshadowing something, but killing Fusco just seems too obvious, they already killed a detective it'd be a bit stale if they did it again.   On the other hand, if they were to kill someone, I think it'll end up being Elias.  He's a big enough character that it'll still make some waves for people, but not too big that it's gonna cause a shitstorm of abuse towards the writers.   As for Finch and Reese, I think they're safe from harm, I mean, it's their show really, Root's kind of an unknown, because she's important to the machine and she's a really good character, but she's another that could be killed off without that many repercussions.   I've expected her to die on a few occasions actually so I've readied myself haha.   But yeah...someone's bound to die, Samaritan is too powerful for this all to end well for everyone involved, add that to the whole Dominic situation and I'd be willing to bet money that not everyone will live, it's a just a question of how daring the writers are.   AnyWay, Samaritan will probably get taken down by the end of the season, either that or the machine could end up sort of merging with it, teach it to have the same basic morals as itself, who knows.   I'm always wrong anyway.   Tldr; Someone's gonna die, doubtful it'll be a main character unless it's someone like Root or Elias.  Samaritan gets shut down or becomes part of the machine.   Oh, as for Shaw, no point speculating about her, she's not gonna be back for a looong time."

Control finally confirms her suspicions, tries to capture Greer. And dies in the process. Harold's plan with beth Bridge's finally comes to fruition, he tries to rein in Samaritan by trying to introduce the machine's moral code into it. Samaritan gets confused. Harold's true dark side emerges and for first time we see him kill/shoot someone Beth Bridges/Greer."
PersonOfInterest,2vo52a,Rebyll,2,Thu Feb 12 22:19:13 2015 UTC,"something to do with Shaw. (I know it won't be Sarah) but i think Greer will try and hint things towards team machine, that he knows stuff about Shaw only TM know (Like the kiss, or their cover identities) Obviously its not going to be the end of Samaritan either, think that will go to next mid season if there is a next season. Martine, i think should die in the finale, but I also think it should be root that does it, just for payback.  Not sure what to think about Dominic & Elias. I just don't know where they'll come into play."
PersonOfInterest,2vo52a,GhostOfCreeper_DIG,2,Thu Feb 12 23:04:37 2015 UTC,"(Forgive me it's quite late and I'm really only hoping that this makes sense :P)  I think the finale is going to be Elias/Dominic-centric. The two are about to go to war basically (Elias is now in full vengeance mode) and Dominic is basically desperate for control of the city. It's just a happy coincidence that Team Machine and the Greerites happen to be in the same city. As to what happens, there are a number of possibilities. With the focus being on Elias and Dominic, it's likely the team will get numbers for either side, or both. Remember that time the Machine spit out the numbers for basically all of the remaining members of HR? Something along those lines. But messier. Much messier.  The lead-up is there. In the last episode alone the three missing persons that Fusco investigates for Reese were all connected to Elias so we know that Dominic is continuing to make moves for the city. Elias is a planner and we know from the past that if he makes a move, it's gonna be spectacular. I'm thinking that the Machine and Samaritan are waiting for this war. With people vying for power, there's nearly unlimited opportunity for people to be manipulated.  I can't even begin to guess how it plays out but if I had to draw parallels I would say Elias groups with Team Machine and Dominic with Samaritan. If it goes that way then Elias will do it out of respect for Harold and Reese, Dominic will follow Samaritan because it leads him to (probably through promises of power and whatnot). Overall it's definitely going to turn into absolute chaos no matter which way it goes.  I don't think we'll lose anyone except on Samaritan's side. We already lost Shaw and I think the Samaritan winning streak has been dragged along enough that it's perhaps time for some sort of levelling off. We'll see how it plays out.  As an afterthought my ideal plot for this finale would be a focus on the war between Elias and Dominic with a decided winner whilst Team Machine fights Samaritan on an entirely unrelated number. The two cross paths occasionally without realizing it. That's just my dream though."
PersonOfInterest,2vo52a,man_in_the_suit,2,Fri Feb 13 04:54:49 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling the big samaritan arc is over for this season. At least for a while. They still have Elias and Dominic to deal with, and it's been hinted in the last episode that missing persons had to do with them in some way. That filler episode felt like a transition between different arcs so I figure get ready for a lot of gang related episodes again (And Claire! She'll be back, right? Maybe they'll intertwine Samaritan with the gangs using her as a proxy?)  But Samaritan won't be dead by the end of this season. Let's hope for moderately-to-significantly crippled, but not dead. It's been a while since Team Machine has had any edge on Samaritan so I really hope that Samaritan takes a huge hit by the end of this season. But it won't die; the build up was too huge to just end in less than a season (remember Greer had his whole plan since the very beginning)"
PersonOfInterest,2vo52a,shinsaikou,2,Fri Feb 13 05:52:30 2015 UTC,"Alright here's my list of predictions.  Iris gets caught by Dominic in order to get to Reese (whether or not Iris is working with dominic remains to be seen, i'm hoping she isn't). Gets saved but breaks up with Reese. (can't see the writers giving Reese a girlfriend but killing her off would be harsh)  Ordinarly I'd say Harold will keep tradition as damsel in distress but as of this point I don't see how Dominic can get a hold of information regarding Finch outside of Greer doing something which leads me to believe Harold won't be the damsel in distress this season. Though there is more than enough time for something to happen.  Pretty sure team machine will be safe in the end. I'll start worrying about fusco if they either start showing flashbacks of him and his kid/ex or if they suddenly start showing him and his date he picked up (in the episode with the wingman)  I think the Detective Silva will join team Machine, when that happens, idk. The fact that Silva got the position of detective stood out as a pretty strong indicator.  I've seen speculation that Control will join but I think her executing that guy pretty much solidifies her role as an antagonist, though potential future ally.  Elias will find out about the Machine, I think he'll figure it out for himself though, also will not join TM. Will come to TM aide in the finale.  From Samaritan's team I'm guessing that at least Greer will be killed off, I have a hunch it'll be by his own hand. If Martine dies it'll be by root but I think she'll survive.   Martine's male counterpart I suspect is actually a plant by whoever Greer's boss is."
PersonOfInterest,2vo52a,soggy_potato,2,Fri Feb 13 12:21:27 2015 UTC,"See, Control is a bit diferent. If you noticed, she tracked down the last guy herself, not her agents. She questioned him, trying to get answers. But she had to shoot him to maintain order, had she not killed him, Samaritan would have known she knows and either eliminated her and her team, or just shut down her program entirely. Her first and foremost concern is the safety of the nation, and that's why she does what she does. And, Samaritan knows about her daughter. She doesn't want her daughter growing up like she did. She has to play her part, but her going to the stock exchange and finding it had been painted recently solidified the doubt in her mind that Samaritan was not all it was cracked up to be, and that Team Machine may be right."

I saw the big ""reveal"" that the they were trying to rig the trial for a guilty verdict from a mile away. I get it's more likely for it to go the other way, but clearly, once they knew what was up it didn't take them long to find the info they needed. The fact that they didn't even consider the possibility seemed unrealistic and was only set up so they could have a ""big twist""."

Even though Samaritan doesn't really get a look in, this is the kind of stuff Samaritan has been trying to control, or else use as an excuse as to why humans can't govern ourselves.

PersonOfInterest,2vjvrw,ReasonablyBadass,3,Wed Feb 11 18:57:30 2015 UTC,"Predictive analytics is a good thing.   They give you insight into potential crimes based on past data. However, just like DNA, Polygraphs, and the ""No Fly List"" the problem comes when average people are given access to the data but don't understand it. For example, DNA was never meant to ""find the guilty party"" - the goal was to use it for exclusion. If the DNA found at the scene does not match the suspect, then they are excluded from consideration.   When you use DNA to sift through a database looking for ""perps,"" you run into the birthday problem.* This still isn't a problem, so long as you treat them as leads - you go to the suspect and talk to them to get more information. It becomes a problem when step 1 is to indict them and show up at their workplace with a SWAT team, then throw them in jail for three weeks waiting arraignment.   When machine leads become automatic warrants, it's a problem. You always have to have people involved in the decision making process who understand they're just leads.   tl;dr: Finch knew exactly what he was doing.   * My birthday is January 8. Given a group of n people, the odds of one of them having the same birthday as me is n/365. However, the odds of any two of them having the same birthday as each other is much greater.   So - given a DNA sample and a suspect, we get odds of a match. But when we take a bunch of DNA samples and go through millions of suspects, the odds of matches drop significantly."

It's not an A-plot but POI taking the time to show the psychological toll of all the losses on Reese is a pretty good character development moment.  Seeing Zoe and Reese's chemistry in the episode while also talking about Reese's lack of emotional support made me sad about Carter again. Reese and Zoe may have a sexy chemistry together, but it also accentuated how Reese's connection with Carter came from a more emotional level."

PersonOfInterest,2vkg9l,FinchyNZ,3,Wed Feb 11 19:33:55 2015 UTC,Samaritan wants to recruit intelligent hackers as it's assets and the game is the test to filter out the best possible assets. Why exactly Samaritan needs such an asset is up for speculation until the next episode. (But we saw others writing code for Samaritan in Control-Alt-Delete)  The Girl is called Claire Mahoney. She follows the clues for one thing for the intellectual challenge. After the death of her parents she also has nothing to loose and looks for meaning in her life which she maybe thinks she'll find from whoever uses the game to recruit people.

If you are smart enough to figure out the game that they set up then you are probably smart enough to be one of them.  Also in the Control episode one of the guys mentioned winning one of the contests and it liked he was just being set up.   Then there is the other girl that figured it out and it looked like Samaritan wanted her as well. We haven't seen her sense. Although this would be the perfect episode for her to show up.

A bottle episode is an episode that takes place almost entirely in one room or location that they already have or is cheap to use. It usually only has a few extra cast. It often has a similar feel to a stage play.   These episodes keep down costs and let you film other episodes more ambitiously (or help stop cost overrides from previous episodes).   This episode filmed on new sets like the courthouse, had many guest stars and extras and while certainly cheaper than normal probably didn't save them that much money."

PersonOfInterest,2vizld,Jethro_McCrazy,12,Wed Feb 11 11:42:53 2015 UTC,"I can't decide yet. She is definitely a good device for them to explore Reese's character more deeply now that they no longer use flashbacks for him. Because of that I can think of three possible scenarios:  1) She is a spy  2) She is a love interest who will get killed off  3) She is a love interest and Reese will get killed off  Each of them have their problems.  1) I feel that since her name is 'Iris' (a part of the eye) it suggests that she may potentially be there to keep an eye on Det. Riley for somebody (the Brotherhood perhaps?). This would be very obvious, however, obvious is not always bad. Sometimes trying something shocking becomes convoluted. I think this is the most likely scenario right now as I imagine that Elias vs Dominic will get pushed more heavily and wrapped up by the season end - and Det. Riley is integral to that plot.  2) She may be a genuine love interest for Reese. I have no problem with this since the show has proven that it does not use love as a way to cause unnecessary drama on the show from week to week - so if she is they obviously have an end game. The first of which is her dying. The problem here is that this plot point has been done to death on the show especially in regards to Reese. I'm not sure seeing him get broken down again by a killed romance is really that interesting at this point. (Although I do not think he loved Carter romantically.)  3) She is a genuine love interest with the end game of actually building Reese up as a character in a positive way. We've seen him broken, perhaps they want to build him up and show the positivity he gains from getting 'fixed'? The only issue here is this show does not allow victory to be savoured for long, or for our heroes to ever be truly happy so this could be the beginning of the end for John if that is the case. The problem here being that with Shaw out of action for potentially a year and half/two years I don't think the writers can really afford to kill Reese off at this point. Especially given the tone of the last episode where they were really pushing the idea that it is back to John, Reese and Fusco (and inevitably Root when she returns). Nobody else will join the team.  Those are my thoughts. I'm sure the writers have considered more possibilities, but I still feel the first option is the most likely and I'd be 100% cool with that. It'd be interesting to see John get betrayed in another way I guess - opening up to somebody who then actually was a spy.  EDIT: Watching it back, I'm not sure I do think she is a spy. John went back to her. She didn't pursue him. She also quite obviously likes him back. I guess I have no good idea as to what she could be. Unless they're trying to complicate his cover life so when the cover unravels there are further issues in the real world? Who knows. Maybe she's the Louis to his Clarke Kent/Superman dynamic."
PersonOfInterest,2vizld,man_in_the_suit,5,Wed Feb 11 12:15:43 2015 UTC,"That would be ""Lois."" Louis Lane would make for a very different type of story.  Anyway, she might not be Samaritan related. She could have ties to the Brotherhood or Elias instead.  Still, her not being at all alarmed that John isn't a real cop, and not reporting him for it, even after he confirms she is right, makes me extremely suspicious of her. She just seemed awfully unperturbed. If he didn't come back, she wasn't going to do anything about this mystery man? It's weird.  There is definitely more to her than being a shrink, in my opinion. Best case scenario, she works for Elias, and just wants information."
PersonOfInterest,2vizld,man_in_the_suit,1 point,Wed Feb 11 18:09:54 2015 UTC,"Well, I have a few comments to that.  1) I never mentioned Samaritan. It just doesn't make sense. I said she'd be a spy for the Brotherhood. I think if she is one that is far more likely to keep an eye on Det. Riley (as I said in my post). If she worked for Samaritan John would be dead by now.  2) She thinks he's a cop, she just knows that he hasn't been a career cop because he's much more damaged and carries himself differently than a comment. All her comment meant that she knew he hadn't gone through the academy at 20 and been a copy for 20 years - he'd obviously done something else and she's wondering what that was and why he had decided to become a cop now. She still thinks he is a legit cop right now though so there would be no need to report him.  3) I don't know if there is more to her. John went back to her. If she is a spy then she got very lucky that he decided to come back. The only way it works in my m"

PersonOfInterest,2vizld,rflairfan1,2,Wed Feb 11 18:05:30 2015 UTC,I think she is working for someone maybe Dominic.
PersonOfInterest,2vizld,eikeegimuu,2,Wed Feb 11 19:49:38 2015 UTC,"I didn't really get the feeling that the doc should become a love interest for Reese. But the awkward aborted hug/handshake and Zoe's comment seem to point towards that.  I don't have any worst case scenarios. I wouldn't have a problem if she turned out to be a spy and/or love interest or someone to confide in. I think all of those scenarios would work storywise.  But I think she's not a spy for one because then it would have been a gamble to sign Reese off and trust that he'll return “voluntarily”.  Also, I read somewhere that during HR Fusco got a love interest but that storyline was scrapped because the audience was guessing too heavily that the lady would turn out to be a spy. That's probably the first guess anyway for such a new character, so they might consider it too predicable. But if it makes sense in the story then why not.  I would prefer to have her instead as a love interest in essence as someone Reese can simply confide in (to a point). But whether as a friend or a lover she'll probably end up being in danger at some point because of her connection to Reese.  Oh, I did find it strange that she's able to determine and then take in stride that this guy is not a cop, but just lets it go (basically without good reason), so I guess she could be a spy after all. But maybe fake cops with issues are more common than the general public would think :P"

Its her job.  Department shrinks are only ""required"" to evaluate a cop's psyche after a shoot.  They have to do their ""due dilligence"", but once the shrink doesn't think the cop will go on a shooting spree, they're supposed to cut them loose.  And this is the NYPD; I'm sure the department shrinks have a heavy backlog of shooters to evaluate.    Yes, department shrinks encourage cops to make regular appointments outside of an investigation, but if the cop isn't being voluntary, they're wasting their time ""forcing"" them to attend appointments."
PersonOfInterest,2vizld,eikeegimuu,1 point,Fri Feb 13 03:44:01 2015 UTC,That was regarding the possibility of the doc being a spy (then these sessions were her access to Reese). If the doc isn't a spy then of course it wasn't a gamble but business as usual.

I mean, I really like John the overt badass and Harold the sleeper badass and the others have their charm despite me disliking several of them when first introduced but Fusco consistently strikes the balance between being the light comic relief and a doggedly reliable badass in his own right.  He comes across as being a bit behind the 8 ball much of the time but then he pulls out moments like that where you realise that it's simply his method of handling the fact he doesn't have all the details of what's going on. He's damned good at what he does, even if we only get to see it intermittently.  John's little smile after Fusco said his piece really summed it up for me. Respect for the man and his determination."

I thought sure we kept seeing her because she was a spy, either for Samaritan, or Dominic, or somebody!  I think this is also the most confirmation we've gotten that John and Zoe usually sleep together when she shows up - Harold teasing him about Zoe, Zoe teasing him about Iris... Somehow, the first time I watched her Season 2 appearances, I thought she and John just played cards.  (Although I noticed a few more cues on the rewatch.)  Other high notes: Finch not noticing the Machine's obvious attempts to get him onto the jury, Finch telling the truth to try to get out of jury duty, ""Give 'em hell, Harry!,"" Reese using his sniper rifle to send a Morse message, Fusco's awesome courage at the end there."

And then she looked at the camera with the 'It's been a long time' line, yes, it has. She adds a component to the team that they can't make up for, between scalpel, hammer, tazer, and sliderule. And that's charisma, she can actually work the intrigue angle without shooting someone in the kneecap. Plus with her 'free agent' dynamic she's very much the catwoman to Reese's batman. My gushing aside, this episode is definitely the medicine for MIA. Reese and Finch start getting their brotherly moments again, Zoe is charming, the POI is a woobie, Reese is opening up to Iris, and Fusco is behind them to the end. The only one who doesn't have a moment is Bear (where has he been anyway?) Looks like Elias' secret war is about to come into frame, maybe a few episodes from now.

With a stretch Friendczar founder Logan Pierce could make an appearance, but it would be a stretch.

PersonOfInterest,2vha8j,The_Adamator,13,Wed Feb 11 04:06:13 2015 UTC,I don't think they're foreshadowing his death. I get the feeling that they're probably going to make him a proper member of the team soon. It'd feel cheap to bring in an actor to fill the Shaw role when you've got Fusco right there waiting to step up.

PersonOfInterest,2vha8j,pensee_idee,14,Wed Feb 11 04:16:34 2015 UTC,Well he has custody for a reason.
PersonOfInterest,2vha8j,The_Adamator,3,Wed Feb 11 04:42:52 2015 UTC,"True.  I guess my point was that he sees what they're doing as more important than himself, more important than his life even, he might see it as more important than whether or not his son continues to have a living father.  Based on what we've seen of him, Lee's got to be at least in high school by now, possibly getting close to being 18.  I always got the sense that Fusco only had partial custody, and that his divorce was based on his long hours at work, rather than on anything ""wrong"" with his ex-wife.  Besides, Fusco's been very, very close to death at least twice now, when he almost got shot by the crooked IAB cop in Season 1, and when HR kidnapped him in Season 3.  I think Fusco's made his peace with his eventual death already, and that if he were going to back out because he's going to get killed, he would have done so a long time ago."
PersonOfInterest,2vha8j,pensee_idee,2,Wed Feb 11 13:31:35 2015 UTC,I agree. I especially liked the scenes with just Reese and Finch.

Staying absolutely true to the show, this week's episode was anything but fluff. It gives us a break from all of that Samaritan business but it contained magnificent character development, drew on some old moments to cement the current situation, and if I'm not mistaken began the lead-up to the season finale arc. I'm truly elated and once again absolutely proud to call this my weekly highlight. 10/10 in my opinion one of the best episodes of the season.  EDIT: Canadian here.

PersonOfInterest,2vha8j,soggy_potato,10,Wed Feb 11 02:22:16 2015 UTC,Do people actually open this thread before watching the epsiode?  That would be insane. It's an episode discussion thread. It should just have one big spoiler tag in the title and that's it. Would make it a whole lot easier to read. Why would you try and discuss an episode you haven't watched?
PersonOfInterest,2vha8j,patentlyobvious,2,Thu Feb 12 09:27:13 2015 UTC,It was before the American airing of the episode. You are supposed to use it during an episode because it does not say post.

The machine has only ever intervened before when Rhys was about to call it quits, i.e. something that would threaten its ability to carry out its mission.  The machine was much more proactive than usual this week, yet there appears to be no reason for it to care more about this number than any other number.  I kept waiting for some connection to the larger plotline-- the improved cell technology certainly seems like the sort of thing Samaritan would be interested in-- but it never came.  What's going on here?  Seems ripe for a further reveal."

PersonOfInterest,2vha8j,Gofunkiertti,2,Sat Feb 14 06:11:11 2015 UTC,"It plays off of the theme...remember when someone said that watching people die when they have the power to stop it hurts, well think about how the machine feels."

PersonOfInterest,2vha8j,LaunchpadMacQ,7,Wed Feb 11 03:19:40 2015 UTC,"I loved this episode. I don't know if the show needed to go back to its roots (sans Root), but it was certainly a lot of fun and thematically, it resonated well with what's been going on recently.   I have to take back something I said last week about Reese's decision on whether to continue the search for Shaw or not; I think they justified it in this episode. I thought the opening scene was one of the strongest opens of the series, Reese and Finch reminiscing on how many numbers they've lost since Shaw disappeared, as well as how many friends they've lost since they've started this thing. Reese continuing to inquire about Root was cute and shows how much closer they've gotten over the last few episodes. Reese and Finch ultimately deciding not to bring on any new team members was a logical, yet powerful, conclusion they reached (not that they'll be able to prevent it).   Otherwise, I don't have much to say about the story for the episode. It was pretty standard fare and was just fun to watch. I'm pretty suspicious about Iris, honestly. I'm not sure why, but I don't think she's who she says she is. Could be nothing, I'm pretty terrible at predicting things.  Last but not least, no Root, which always sucks. It's worse because we know she's on the warpath, and the Machine isn't helping her, and I question her own abilities; she's crafty and can handle a gun, but she's not at the level Reese or Shaw are. I would be a little scared if there wasn't a fourth wall between us.   Interestingly, Shaw has not been removed from the title sequence nor did they change her Samaritan readout. Kind of strange, but we'll see what they end up doing. Makes me think we may have greatly exaggerated Shahi's exit from the show."

PersonOfInterest,2vha8j,TJlive800,4,Wed Feb 11 19:35:56 2015 UTC,"I am so, so, so happy that they gave us an episode like this. It really opened my eyes back up to how much I miss the old POI. As much as I like the serialized direction it's taking and the constant developments each episode, I sort of forced myself to like that and let my longings for the old days go. Well, now I want all that back. See, the point I keep forgetting to bring up is how much I love the show's sense of mystery. I want that back!! I loved how season 1 and 2 had an interesting procedural case but every episode tied into the greater plot, but they kept the serialized stuff sidelined so the big conclusions would be really huge. I love those recurring storylines! If they just give full focus to one story each episode, it'll start to get old soon.  That's also precisely my problem with Greer. Back in season 2, the guy would give me chills all the way to the possibility of nightmares. After season 3, they would throw him in your face so much that it was run to exhaustion. He's lost that presence he was able to maintain back then, and now it's come down to every corny line being somewhat better since he's British and everything is put so elegantly. And as much as I don't want to say it, I will: I HATE this focus on ""social commentary"". I hate it. The critics over at The A.V. Club seem to love it but this whole ""messages on the age of surveillance"" crap is drowning out the focus on actual entertainment, and the episodes don't ever have that ""gravitational pull"" they once seemed to have. You need to look hard for something to look forward to and the plot elements don't feel so high-key since the focus on the intensity and buildup is partial. There are of course exceptions - ""If-Then-Else"" is my FAVORITE FREAKING EPISODE OF THE WHOLE SERIES and episodes like ""Prophets"" and ""The Cold War"" were able to work their way around the surveillance themes by being extremely creative with every approach.  Oh, and back in season 2, there actually was some surveillance commentary, but it managed to be interesting since it kept the plot going and tied in nicely with the bigger picture, in a more ""driven"" and ""kinetic"" manner that was quite exhilarating. The way it really made you want the plot to unfold. Stuff like ""The Contingency"". You know what? I think it's just a matter of binge-watching. That way, you can dive into a premise that jumps out at you and the interest can stay sustained. You can stay within the vibe of the show and relate to basically everything. I finished seasons 1 and 2 via binge watching over summer 2013 and I saw 3 and 4 weekly. The first half of 3 was TOO GOOD.  NOW, onto THIS episode. The second Finch said ""it's just you and me again"", I jumped up in joy and fist pumped. I miss those days so much!!! Thinking back to episodes like ""Flesh and Blood"", ""Baby Blue"", ""No Good Deed"", ""The Contingency"", and even ""God Mode"", I just cannot believe that it's the same show I'm watching today. Anyways, David Slack always knows how to conjure up an amazing case, and while this and ""Honor Among Thieves"" weren't the strongest episodes this season, ""Guilty"" was still a very fun ride with a good, wholesome share of quality entertainment. It was beyond joyous seeing Zoe back, and the way she really brought out Reese and Finch's personalities was everything I could ask for. Finch's breakage of character is a rare gem, and his outburst during his ""debate"" with Reese and his remark about staying awake were perfect. I also really enjoyed the return to character development for Reese! In the first two seasons he was one of the most captivating and fascinating badasses around, and basically HUNDRED PERCENT of season 4 gives him nothing at all to do. But in this, we got to see Reese's little crush on Iris, and I'm overjoyed to see that they didn't change anything about his and Zoe's relationship. Their banter is priceless.  The court case was interesting mainly because Emma was a very likable POI. I remember last year when everyone was theorizing that Blair Brown could play Control, and I can picture her as an evil and calculating government head, but she brought this warmth and good-natured life to her character that boosted much of the episode's quality. As for the perp, I didn't expect it to be that guy since it was either a business head or Samaritan in my brain, but that standoff was POI at its roots.The show needs to return to its roots and stay there for a while.   All in all, great, nostalgic episode that made me go back to wanting POI's roots back. I hope it stays that way, or at least takes this Samaritan story to a more interesting level and ditches all this boring social commentary about surveillance. Great job, writers!"

PersonOfInterest,2vha8j,jotru,2,Wed Feb 11 03:24:31 2015 UTC,"I thought this was a fairly great standalone episode after all the Samaritan shit that went down. I do have a question though. Does anybody know why David Slack is writing more ""case of the week"" episodes this season? I remember him usually writing fantastic serialized episodes in the past 3 seasons but this season consists of more standalone episodes by him... Thoughts?"
PersonOfInterest,2vha8j,EThorns,2,Wed Feb 11 02:21:43 2015 UTC,"If I were to assume, along with his commitment to this show, Slack was also working on a script over the past few months called ""Protect & Survive"" for ABC, which he's set to EP with Shonda Rhimes. They haven't announced pilot production for it yet (don't think it will, as they're usually announced by late January or early February, and another Rhimes project got the greenlight a little while ago).  They probably wanted to give him a lighter workload, so he's taking care of standalones for now (though 407 brought in some nice myth arc elements in the form of Grice & Brooks). Most of the writers here get three scripts a season (unless they're on maternity leave, or their showrunner duties prevent them from writing the actual script though they do uncredited rewrites on all of them), and it's easy to guess that his final one (21st or 22nd) will contribute more to the main arc."

PersonOfInterest,2vha8j,Radiopd,3,Wed Feb 11 20:15:53 2015 UTC,"This episode was far from a filler. It introduced important changes that will help Team Machine in the future.  The final evolution of Fusco from a spineless crooked cop to someone who cares and is willing to sacrifice himself for these people that just drop into his lap.  The opening of John's heart, something that some viewers would have thought never possible after the flashbacks in the episode where he found out his love was dead.  Finally, the sadness in Finch's eye that even though it was back to just him and Reese solving cases, that he misses and regrets not being able to help Root and Shaw.  Those deep concepts were introduced in ""filler"" episode.  I am glad that we get to see what happened to Claire from ""Nautilus"" next."

I think the one person we need more flashbacks of is Root, we only ever saw one flashback of her. Granted, it was an episode dedicated to it, but still, would like to see more."
PersonOfInterest,2vkqzw,bootkiller,2,Wed Feb 11 21:26:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we need Root flashbacks for sure. We got a lot of Reese and Finch flashbacks and that had seemed kind of unfair to the ladies and Fusco who only get one or two significant flashback episodes... But looking back, the Reese flashbacks are pretty much all part of the Finch storyline (plus context for Reese's part in it) which culminated in ""RAM"".   We need Root flashbacks (with some IFT Easter Eggs hopefully), childhood Reese flashbacks and (if and when Sarah is back) Shaw flashbacks with Hersh training her and her training Grice."
PersonOfInterest,2vkqzw,your_mind_aches,2,Wed Feb 11 22:28:20 2015 UTC,"Yep, Root is definitely the one with the biggest gap in the flashback area. With the others we pretty much know what has led them here. So even if we don’t always have the specifics the logical trajectory is clear and there are no obvious blanks (not that once we do see the flashbacks they can’t deviate from that). Not so with Root.  With Root we’ve had basically one flashback and she wasn’t even Root at that point (and it’d be too hasty to assume that that’s what made her into Root). Her background includes only the revenge at 14 y/o and that she shed the “Sam Groves” persona for good in her twenties. So I think that while with others the flashbacks are mostly to show HOW (which of course also helps to understand the characters), for Root we’d need the flashback(s) to see WHY. But naturally that makes Root’s flashback(s) also more challenging.  It could be that it was just the general distain for most people and discovering during her revenge for Hanna what she herself is capable of and there are no other “traumas”. But I don’t think so and even Root’s aversion to using her birth name points to some big gaps in her story. Either way we’ve seen just the tip of the iceberg with her. But I’m cool with waiting for a Root flashback, because that should not be a rush job and only a glimpse might be too little anyway, so better no flashback than something that’s not worthy of the character."

Or was Fusco too convincing to Martine and believe his ""random truck stop"" story and it was left at that?  Feels like Fusco is in more danger that it might look like"

PersonOfInterest,2vftw0,MrPotatoButt,1 point,Fri Feb 13 03:17:26 2015 UTC,Thursday is the most popular night in TV. Sunday's on CBS never air in the correct time because of the NFL.  Every other channel has it's most popular drama's on Thursday's.
PersonOfInterest,2vftw0,rflairfan1,0,Fri Feb 13 03:18:30 2015 UTC,"Nope.  Sunday is supposed to be the most popular night, because the wage earners are home that night for the start of the workday.  This gets switched during football season, because CBS gets its start times screwed up, but more important, the other networks will counterprogram against the NFL, rather than try to take the night outright.

PersonOfInterest,2vftw0,Beetush,2,Tue Feb 10 20:48:33 2015 UTC,"Weaker ratings.  Its become a serial, and that has a tendency to lose viewers who don't want to track story history.  As for dragging it out, I don't think there's a remote chance of it.  The show creator doesn't look like a sellout; he only wants as much time to tell the story.  And the story is obviously about the impact an omnipotent AI will have over humanity.  Not just do I predict The Machine will defeat Samaritan, Team Irrelevant will eventually go against The Machine.  More important, PoI doesn't have the crazy popular ratings that would make the network insist on another season, with another showrunner."
PersonOfInterest,2vftw0,MrPotatoButt,4,Fri Feb 13 03:19:01 2015 UTC,"Looking at the current storyline I think PoI only has 2 more seasons left.  May the gods of syndication help us during season 5. If PoI does get cancelled in the future, I really hope another network or Netflix would pick it up."

PersonOfInterest,2vftw0,DismemberMama,2,Wed Feb 11 16:38:16 2015 UTC,"I'd say there is a 90% chance it gets a fifth season. It still pulls in decent demo numbers and it has a pretty extensive fan base. POI seems outperform Chicago Fire in that time slot, which NBC just renewed for another season. CBS is loosing a few big shows this year and they'll need to retain established programming that still pulls in viewers. I just can't see them canceling it, not with a Netflix launch coming in the fall.  In terms of series longevity, I feel like it still has enough material for 3 more seasons, if it can make it that far (I hope). There is still a lot of over arching plot lines and questions that can't possibly be wrapped up in just one more season without making it feel rushed or half assed. Plus, the conceit of the show, the numbers, makes for rich material. Maybe I'm being selfish, but I'd hate to see it end after only five seasons. I want them to go out while the show is still fresh and on their own terms, but I also feel like it hasn't peaked yet creatively."

Syndication is no longer a reason, because with 90 episodes you're already there. And with the ratings in this season, will surely have a full 5th season and not in a weak spot (fridays or sundays). However, the evaluation for more renewals is per season. If next season (5th) doesn't have good ratings, 6th won't be secured. However, as a long-running show, if it doesn't performs well in 5th it could have a short 6th ending, like The Mentalist (7th season of 13 episodes)."

It should simply tease us, not let us know that their number of the week will be someone else on jury duty then realize that number is related to Samaritan (surprise!) and has a plan to make the innocent guy guilty for whatever reason that furthers Samaritan's interests. I figured the writers will throw in a reference or two to 12 Angry Men where only Finch votes not guilty and angers everyone else.  -Ms Groves, we cannot let this innocent man get [death sentence/life in prison] for something he didn't commit!  -Then it's up to you to convince them that this whole trial is a sham orchestrated by an artificial super intelligence, Harold!  -Get John in here to help me!  -Sorry he's too busy with his small time romantic interest with his therapist that won't last long because this show isn't centered on romance.  -True, and besides, I heard Zoe is supposed to be back in this episode or the other.

I also think it's cute, in a way, when Root gets protective of Finch.  Reese/Root: I think they do have a kind of chemistry, especially in M.I.A.  Their dynamic is easily one of the most exciting and intriguing to me.  I love both the tension they've had, and the way their interaction has developed as they've slowly gained respect for each other.  On the other hand, their interaction in Firewall is fun in its own right.  Root/Shaw: This one's fun, but what's great is that it's not just a cut-and-dry ship.  Fusco/Shaw: What /u/EThorns said.  I don't dislike any pairings.  It's impressive how they've been juggled by the writers, how they each work in their own ways and bring out different nuances of the characters."
PersonOfInterest,2vf5zl,BallisticGE0RGE,4,Tue Feb 10 21:01:30 2015 UTC,"I for one really want to see an Elias Finch team up. The two of them using their brains to get out of situations together. Finch playing the tech end of things, Elias playing the people.  I feel like a lot of the team ups you don't like OP, are completely intentional. Root-Reese is going to lack chemistry because there's none to be had, it should feel like something is missing because there is.  Finch-Fusco always comes off awkwardly as it should, Finch and Fusco couldn't possibly be more different yet they have respect for each other.  And Reese-Kara and Finch-Dillinger being bad combos is definitely intentional, neither of those pairings were right for Reese or Finch, so that's why they had to move on.  Root-Finch is a good combo  too, it plays off like Mommy and Daddy on a road trip, talking about their kid."
PersonOfInterest,2vf5zl,AScaryMoose,1 point,Tue Feb 10 16:28:07 2015 UTC,"An Elias-Finch team up would indeed be awesome. I've been rewatching the whole of S4 and, I gotta admit, I like Elias a lot more now. So, if it ever came to that, I'd be totally on board.   I feel like a lot of the team ups you don't like OP, are completely intentional.   You're absolutely right about that. I like that the show doesn't force the characters to be all buddy-buddy with everyone just because they're on the same team. But I suppose I just wanted to say it anyway. And I also wanted to know if maybe I was in the minority with the Root-Reese thing.   Yeah, Root-Finch is always an electric pairing."

I also love anytime Zoe teams up with Reese.  Edit: meant to reply to the thread as a whole..oh well."
PersonOfInterest,2vf5zl,eikeegimuu,0,Tue Feb 10 18:44:51 2015 UTC,Zoe-Reese is always fun. Am excited for the next ep!
PersonOfInterest,2vf5zl,eikeegimuu,7,Wed Feb 11 10:49:24 2015 UTC,"Finch & Root, hands down. Amy & Michael are so damn electric together.  Reese & Finch, the quintessential duo. Always fresh.  Reese & Root are just flatout scary. Fun dynamic, and hope they get to explore that some more.  Root & Shaw: Nuff said.  Fusco & Shaw: The comedic chemistry between them is terrific, and some of Sarah's best dramatic moments have been with Kevin, who can pretty much bring out the best in anybody.  Martine & Lambert: Cause even psychotic Samaritan agents can be wonderfully deadpan snarkers."
PersonOfInterest,2vf5zl,peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee,2,Tue Feb 10 19:15:44 2015 UTC,"Kevin Chapman really brings a note of genuine humanity to the show. I mean, the other characters are very much outliers to society. Fusco is the only one whose life we can actually empathize with. And he lets Reese and Shaw have at least one friend who is actually normal and, as the show would say, connects them to the rest of humanity. Which they need.  Also, Fusco-Shaw is just the most hilarious pairing ever. Comedy gold those two. With moments of touching friendship."
PersonOfInterest,2vf5zl,your_mind_aches,3,Wed Feb 11 11:06:17 2015 UTC,"I've appreciated all the team-ups so far. Sometimes it took a while like with Reese and Shaw (their interactions seemed too much like consisting of typical action movie quips in the beginning, but eventually things fell into place) but each team-up constellation has different dynamics and fits in a different way.  For me the weakest links have been the team-ups where one (or both) of the characters don't particularly appeal to me (on a character level not b/c of positive or negative characteristics), so I will not dwell on those and those cases were rare anyway.  Actually, I'll list only my favorites.  Harold-Reese is of course great. That's probably universally acknowledged on this board.  Root-Harold is exceptional. Comments are not even necessary.  Root-Shaw was at times unexpectedly great, though I was in the beginning in denial about any flirting part of it and later I felt that they sometimes overdid things with those two, which made me wary that it's a gag (which would be a disservice for both their characters). But the showrunners seem to take it seriously so I'm interested in seeing how it continues if/once Shaw comes back.  Root-Reese has a lot of potential though it is so far mostly unexplored. They've had basically one episode, so it's not that much to go on, but based on that I hope they team up again. I think theirs is an interesting dynamic, because they mirror each other in ways they don't appreciate and at the same time their values are so different that they'll find the other lacking because of that. Maybe what they have common is their disillusionment (though it has driven them in different directions). I thought I saw some of that in the episode where they teamed up. However that wasn't perhaps a typical team-up for them because they had the same very specific last chance kinda goal. But I liked how easily they communicated with each other  (incl. some similar reactions). It doesn't look like that will ever be a feel-good type of pairing (except when using a rocket launcher), but I find it more interesting because of that not less interesting. So as much as I love Root-Harold I'd be also very willing to have more Root-Reese instead to see how that works out.  And a special mention to the Fusco-Shaw team-up!"
PersonOfInterest,2vf5zl,your_mind_aches,0,Tue Feb 10 21:39:10 2015 UTC,"Well, technically, Root and Reese were also paired up in Firewall and A House Divided. They work well enough together, as everyone in Team Machine always does if only because they're also all extremely professional, but I just don't find their pairing appealing, I guess.   Also, I agree with your Root-Shaw writeup. It seemed gimmicky to me at first and they really did overdo it at times. But it seems to be genuine, at least on Root's part, so that's nice."
PersonOfInterest,2vf5zl,yeogibwa,2,Wed Feb 11 10:58:22 2015 UTC,"Firewall probably shouldn't count even technically, since Reese only met doctor Turing in that episode.   They did work together in A House Divided but I didn't even really consider that since both tried to avoid interacting with each other as much as possible while putting up a polite front. But that episode is of course part of the progression from when Root kidnapped Harold and Reese predicted a bleak future for her should she ever come near them. Anyways for me it's an interesting pairing."
PersonOfInterest,2vf5zl,your_mind_aches,0,Wed Feb 11 20:28:11 2015 UTC,Fair enough.
PersonOfInterest,2vf5zl,Freedom68,3,Fri Feb 13 09:35:06 2015 UTC,"My favorite was Carter and Fusco. I also really liked Elias/Scarface and Reese, because I think you knew that they were going to kick ass."

PersonOfInterest,2vfm30,boringdude00,1 point,Wed Feb 11 06:30:54 2015 UTC,"The Practice:       The Practice is an American legal drama created by David E. Kelley centering on the partners and associates at a Boston law firm. Running for eight seasons on ABC from 1997 to 2004, the show won the Emmy in 1998 and 1999 for Best Drama Series, and spawned the successful and lighter spin-off series Boston Legal, which ran for five more seasons, from 2004 to 2008.  The Practice focused on the law firm of Robert Donnell and Associates (later becoming Donnell, Young, Dole, & Frutt, and ultimately Young, Frutt, & Berluti). Plots typically featured the firm's involvement in various high-profile criminal and civil cases that often mirror current events. Conflict between legal ethics and personal morality was a recurring theme. Some episodes contained light comedy. Kelley claimed that he conceived the show as something of a rebuttal to L.A. Law (for which he wrote) and its romanticized treatment of the American legal system and legal proceedings.

I suspect it could however with Samaritan watching everything it can't really do anything without alerting samaritan.  Remember that Reese has had experience operating in NY undercover in his old government job where I'm sure he was taught how to avoid getting his face caught on camera.

Imagine your program as something similar in complexity to a neuron in the human brain (in reality a single neuron is about as powerful as your whole computer). Then imagine billions of them all wired together. Something like that is probably what is behind The Machine and Samaritan.  You wouldn't be able to directly program such a complex system. Instead, you'd have to accomplish that by ""teaching"" it how do do things, much like a human learns (and much like the flashbacks in the series show Harold teaching the machine about things).  And note that because you can't fully control its programming (due to its learning or ""growth""; it evolves beyond even Harold's understanding) you have no guarantees about what it will do.

It would be difficult to find out if they were threatening or not. And why would they be? What harm does staring at a camera could do?  Secondly, Samaritan is learning. Mind you, it hasn't had the amount and type of training that The Machine has from Harold and experience. That's why it is creating an ant farm. A sandbox to test out it's theories and quench it's curiosity.  Moreover, even if it did identify the threat, the installed virus kicks in and tells Samaritan that what it thinks is a threat, is actually quite harmless. So Samaritan lets it slide.

PersonOfInterest,2v4s2r,jeserodriguez,2,Sat Feb 7 23:11:17 2015 UTC,"Five Eyes:       The ""Five Eyes"", often abbreviated as ""FVEY"", refer to an intelligence alliance comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These countries are bound by the multilateral UKUSA Agreement, a treaty for joint cooperation in signals intelligence.     The origins of the FVEY can be traced back to World War II, when the Atlantic Charter was issued by the Allies to lay out their goals for a post-war world. During the course of the Cold War, the ECHELON surveillance system was initially developed by the FVEY to monitor the communications of the former Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc, although it allegedly was later used to monitor billions of private communications worldwide.    In the late 1990s, the existence of ECHELON was disclosed to the public, triggering a major debate in the European Parliament and, to a lesser extent, the United States Congress. As part of efforts in the ongoing War on Terror since 2001, the FVEY further expanded their surveillance capabilities, with much emphasis placed on monitoring the World Wide Web. The former NSA contractor Edward Snowden described the Five Eyes as a ""supra-national intelligence organisation that doesn't answer to the known laws of its own countries"".  Documents leaked by Snowden in 2013 revealed that the FVEY have been spying on one another's citizens and sharing the collected information with each other in order to circumvent restrictive domestic regulations on domestic spying.

PersonOfInterest,2uy5gw,__ADAM__,2,Fri Feb 6 17:42:29 2015 UTC,How about a flaw in the experimental CPU that most of Samaritan is running on? Remember that episode?  But ... I feel the show is moving toward some sort of ending that connects Samaritan's demise with it's disdain for humans.
PersonOfInterest,2uy5gw,andzzy,2,Sat Feb 7 11:27:55 2015 UTC,"Samaritan is something of a child still. It doesn't understand human behaviour and I think that's the key part to defeating it entirely. Harold had plenty of time to teach the Machine to look properly for things, analyze, and teach it life lessons that humans get. It's learned to apply these skills over time and even displays empathy. The latest episode tells us that Samaritan still has a lot of learning ... and it's not doing too well at it. So far there has been a very heavy lean on the human assets to get anything accomplished.  I find it interesting that both machines have now issued a STOP order to their human assets. I think that the Machine does indeed have a plan. I also think that it will never be executed because the human assets are all about to go wonky and do unexpected things (stress from these non-resting, pesky machines will do that I imagine). I see there's some talk of Greer betraying Samaritan but I don't think that will happen. The flashback of what he did at MI6 seems to almost cement that fact. Samaritan is a machine and Greer is actually asking it to direct him. At this point Samaritan's analog interface presents a more direct (and creepy) threat.  Now to the actual question at hand! In an ideal world you would leak the existence of Samaritan to all the members of Congress and then the general public. This would effectively eliminate most of Samaritan's power as Congress gets caught up in a massive debate, halting any political progress it can make. It doesn't even matter at that point how Samaritan would plan to persuade Congress, the political machine (forgive the pun) is clogged.  As for a solution that involves our dear friends over in Team Machine ... that gets more complicated. They're going to need more help although I am getting more impressed by Harold and the more aggressive approach he is taking to the situation. I think they would need insiders at Research (A la Control) and perhaps even very close to Greer (A la Shaw soonish?). The team has already demonstrated the ability to tamper with Samaritan (it can't 'see' the members of Team Machine, for instance, thanks to some clever work by Root and her hackers).  One of my large questions is why is the Machine taking a defensive approach to the situation? It dawns on me that one aspect of a war is 'knowing thy enemy' and so I believe it is possible that The Machine is waiting and watching, seeing how far Samaritan has come and what it is truly capable of. In a perfect world the Machine would then go on the attack and handle Samaritan itself. But I really don't think anybody presently alive wants that.  The conclusive answer is that there really is no conclusive answer. The Machine and her allies have all of the experience and knowledge of the systems at play that they need to hide and launch the occasional assault. Samaritan and its allies have the political machine under their belt and that's helping them to do all of the nasty things that would otherwise be horribly illegal. I do however think that Samaritan will slip up seeing as it is attempting to exert massive control over everything domestically when its job is to prevent terrorist attacks. This could end up being worse than when Northern Lights was revealed to the world.  I think that the key answer to our questions will be given to us during or towards the conclusion of the battle between the Brotherhood and Elias. It's easy to imagine that there are two teams (Brotherhood and Elias) and two machines, both seeking control desperately. There's going to be a lot of manipulation and I imagine a lot more despair for everyone before the end of this season let alone the end of the show.  Anyway those are my thoughts. Sorry if it's a bit ramble-y and incoherent it's pretty late and I'm fairly tired :P"
PersonOfInterest,2uy5gw,tornato7,1 point,Sun Feb 8 04:07:49 2015 UTC,"The team is obviously stretched thin, yet they refuse to bring on more people. That one political analyst guy already had it all figured out, why not bring him in as a teammate? The machine was hampered by deleting most of its data every 24 hours (remember the episode with the building of people typing things in?) - this memory wipe needs to be disabled & the whole machine needs to be upgraded if it's going to have a chance against samaritan.   Once these are done, I would try to better understand the code behind Samaritan. How does it make its decisions? If this can be understood then Samaritan can be misled - make it think that Decima is a threat by creating fraudulent evidence.  Once Decima is wiped out, the datacenters, one of which they already know the location of, will be easier to access. Shaw was able to attach servers to make the team invisible, so Samaritan obviously has some vulnerabilities. Bring in teams of hacktivists who would love to take down Samaritan and just start throwing attacks at it.  Samaritan's identity needs to be exposed to the world and the world will turn against it - Samaritan will make it difficult but I think it would fall. Maybe the machine would fall too. That would be a satisfying end to the series."

Since Samaritan is still ""learning"" maybe the machine and its team can try to reason Samaritan to join the Machine."
PersonOfInterest,2uy5gw,baultista,1 point,Mon Feb 9 16:50:00 2015 UTC,"My thought is that Samaritan will consider the humans it keeps close to itself no longer useful.  Someone like Greer will feel shunned or become worried about the extinction of humanity and work to help Team Machine shut down Samaritan with a virus.  At best it might be enough to help The Machine eradicate Samaritan, but maybe not without shutting itself off.  There's really no other way to stop Samaritan unless it screws up big time or causes its own demise."
PersonOfInterest,2uy5gw,pensee_idee,8,Fri Feb 6 04:23:02 2015 UTC,"I feel like seeing Greer's flashback is foreshadowing that he might feel betrayed by Samaritan and act against it.  (In the same way that Linc might feel betrayed by Dominic and act against him.)  Samaritan certainly views people in a very disposable way, a way that could lead some of its underlings to turn against it.  It's hard to see that coming from Greer though.  He already ran Decima that way - if anyone got caught, they were supposed to kill themselves before they could get questioned.  Forget rescue attempts, forget even being trusted not to talk, you lose one fist fight and you're looking for the quickest path to a self-inflicted fatality.  Plus Greer wants Samaritan to make the hard choices people are afraid to make.  I'm not sure what level of derangement or irrationality Samaritan would have to display to get Greer to feel like it no longer deserved his support.  I also wonder if it's even still possible to take the feeds away from Samaritan.  Wherever the Machine went, it still has all the same information it was getting from the NSA feeds.  The government wouldn't know how to take them away (without shutting down the NSA entirely, I guess), and even if they did, the Machine could still hack into them.  The NSA feeds themselves might not even matter, if it's had time to get its own independent access to every camera and microphone in the country.  Samaritan might still truly be dependent on being given access to that information, but it might also have reached the point where it's capable of taking it, no matter what anyone else wants."
PersonOfInterest,2uy5gw,username-reddit,0,Fri Feb 6 04:39:09 2015 UTC,"I am thinking Samaritan is going to play evil and then the eviliest.

If Root stop looking for Shaw and sit down with Harold to make some bug and more to disturb Samaritan feed and blind it, that would be a good way to defeat it."

It's tempting to try to take out the boss, and the boss's boss, but there's maybe no top level, no stopping point.  You might be able to destroy an evil organization, but you'll probably destroy yourself, and the people you love in the process.

PersonOfInterest,2uucod,shinsaikou,5,Fri Feb 6 15:00:48 2015 UTC,"This review is pretty funny and on point. It also gives me a lot of hope for the show if this reviewer has really never seen an episode before. Supposedly, serialised television makes it harder to attract new viewers. If this episode hooked the guy then that's awesome since it wasn't really a standalone episode. Even better, I didn't think the episode was THAT great compared to the rest of the season. So if a somewhat disjointed, lesser effort can hook a new viewer then this show just might stick around a few more years."
PersonOfInterest,2uucod,shinsaikou,1 point,Thu Feb 5 07:24:49 2015 UTC,"I actually enjoyed the b-plot more because, lets face it, we weren't going to be finding Shaw. Then again, I've been watching this show from the pilot and I can see why a new viewer would find the a-story, and piecing the myth arc together from what little details you have to work on in this ep, to be more compelling.  Fusco has been criminally under-utilized since Carter met her end. The first time reviewer also wouldn't know that Mrs. IA was a returning character we'd seen before, not someone Fusco had met off-screen.   Still amused that a first time reviewer was hooked by a very NOT stand-alone episode. Then again, our characters have character... and we have Jesus, Benjamin Linus, and a chick who don't take shit from no one."
PersonOfInterest,2uucod,iella_w,0,Fri Feb 6 14:54:17 2015 UTC,Can't agree more on Fusco! I've had that very small gripe all season so it was great to have him back in the spotlight rather than just conveniently popping up here and there. I thought both plots were pretty good by themselves. It's just that they didn't exactly mesh together and I expect certain shows to have a synergy between their plotlines.   (Spoilers!)  I have to admit though I rolled my eyes just a bit when we found out the brunette was a red herring. I expected either finding Shaw comatose or her going on sabbatical. Brunette herring felt kinda cheap.
PersonOfInterest,2uucod,shinsaikou,4,Fri Feb 6 18:47:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe someone’s controlling it or maybe it has a mind of its own, but since it sees everything, chances are it knows everything, including who has committed what crimes. And, if we’re getting super sci-fi, Agatha-and-the-preco-Twins with it, who will commit crimes in the future.   On point.   It’s worth noting, as in all shows that have plots that extend over multiple episodes or an entire season, there’s an entirely different case being dealt with, by completely different characters, in this episode. It’s about gangs. But I’m just really not that interested in it. Because there’s no Caviezel. So we’ll just skip over those parts.   Funny, that's how I felt about the Fusco side-story also. I imagine they did that as an on-boarding for the female cop, though... I guess that means I'll have to learn her name. ;)"
PersonOfInterest,2uucod,eikeegimuu,1 point,Thu Feb 5 18:04:28 2015 UTC,"No love for Fusco... I found the a-story predictable because we had advance notice that Shahi would be out of the picture for a while. I'm very happy with dat ending, tho... I still enjoyed the b-story more because Fusco got some love and we have a potential new recurring character ostensibly on the side of Team Machine."

I don't have a Twitter, but I noticed his username is at the bottom of the page. Anyone want to try to contact him?"
PersonOfInterest,2uuv88,toomuchidea,16,Thu Feb 5 09:34:40 2015 UTC,"I think they episode itself, especially Harold's dialogue basically said as much. Reese and Root endangered themselves just going to Maple. They have a bigger picture and are already a team mate down. The machine can't afford to lose more assets, especially not Root."
PersonOfInterest,2uuv88,Code_NY,9,Thu Feb 5 09:53:01 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I'm pretty sure the Machine at least knew that Shaw was alive, but wasn't telling Root in order to keep its assets from recklessly charging into the belly of the beast. It could have easily said Shaw was dead in its telephone message but chose to say STOP and have them cease their search. At this point though, Root still doesn't know whether Shaw is dead or alive.. but even if she suspects that she's alive, she probably wouldn't even know where to start looking for her without the Machine's help. Hope rejoins Team Machine soon enough!"
PersonOfInterest,2uuv88,upupandbelow,8,Thu Feb 5 11:32:17 2015 UTC,"Yes (since the Machine has calculated the possibilities for a successful rescue operation as very slim).   I think we can more or less assume that the Machine knows what's happened to Shaw, though maybe not all the specifics.   But I'm surprised the Machine is going with only STOP, since I think Root would accept it if the Machine said that Shaw is alive and safe and things are going according to plan but can't be rescued right now. So either the Machine assesses that Root wouldn't accept that and would still go after Shaw or the Machine knows that Shaw is alive but still in danger (and in fact in need of a rescue operation). I guess it's nice to know that the Machine will not lie to manipulate Root, but I would have thought the Machine would reason with her but I guess not."
PersonOfInterest,2uuv88,eikeegimuu,2,Thu Feb 5 15:42:03 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking the same thing. It makes no sense to just tell them that it knows where Shaw is, and to stop looking for her. If root gets in trouble because of this, it's simply poor writing. Heck, the machine's 'irrelevant' mission is already suffering because root went rogue again."
PersonOfInterest,2uuv88,jedp,5,Thu Feb 5 18:43:56 2015 UTC,I am hoping that the Machine perhaps has a plan with Shaw being captured and does not want the plan to be ruined by a rescue.  Almost like an insider.
PersonOfInterest,2uuv88,Mrcincy,2,Thu Feb 5 14:11:58 2015 UTC,I don't know if the Machine would have any way of communicating with Shaw in there.
PersonOfInterest,2uuv88,baultista,1 point,Fri Feb 6 04:25:14 2015 UTC,This is my theory as well. Shaw has a job to do.
PersonOfInterest,2uuv88,libraryspy,1 point,Thu Feb 5 16:09:07 2015 UTC,"My thoughts too.   It knows they will try and use her as a decoy/spy/trap or similar and it's going to try and turn things around on them. Maybe get her back once she's had Samaritan technology implanted in her so they can study it or infiltrate it.  At the very least Greer will want to use her to identify/locate the rest of the team, which is probably his primary objective, since they are the main threat to Samaritan."
PersonOfInterest,2uuv88,patentlyobvious,2,Fri Feb 6 05:07:49 2015 UTC,"You raise an interesting question: could the Machine have simply lied to her?  Obviously it didn't, but I wonder if that means that it couldn't, or if it could but made a conscious choice not to.  The way that Harold designed the Machine, and the way that it still continues to act, seems to be to let its human agents make the final decisions.  Even when the Machine wanted a congressman dead - it could have ordered Root to do it, and she would have in a heartbeat - but instead it gave Harold his number, and let Finch decide what to do.  Maybe lying to its human agents, even to protect them, would be too much like taking away their ability to decide what to do."
PersonOfInterest,2uuv88,pensee_idee,4,Thu Feb 5 17:15:28 2015 UTC,"The flashbacks from Prophets go along with this.   I killed it because it lied.   It's also a reflection of Finch himself, as in what he told Reese in the pilot.   You left the government because they lied to you; I never will."
PersonOfInterest,2uuv88,ab_emery,2,Thu Feb 5 19:44:19 2015 UTC,"In the case of the senator, Root was busy dealing with a ""Relevant"" threat (since Vigilance had caused the Northern Lights program to be shut down).  Otherwise, I'm certain Root would have been sent."
PersonOfInterest,2uuv88,Afalstein,2,Thu Feb 5 18:30:18 2015 UTC,"Harold might have coded not lying as a law or used it as a testing parameter. But since the chains Harold put in place are gone now anyway I doubt there is anything absolute to stop the Machine from lying. So I think it's a choice.  I agree that lying would have prevented Root from exercising free will so that's a good reason for not lying and would work well with how the Machine has operated so far. Of course in Prophets (or maybe also beginning of Cold World) Harold basically argued that we know nothing about the Machine and all perceived caring comes down to manipulation. The Machine respecting free will doesn’t really fit with that. But maybe Harold's comment toward the end of Cold War that Root is not alone meant some change of heart regarding that.  Another good reason (in addition or by itself) for not lying would be that the Machine knows that Root as the interface is VERY likely to come in contact with Samaritan and Root might even accidentally find out the truth. The loss of trust from that would be irreparable. Especially since Root has called the Machine among other things her friend (also, somebody translated the Morse code from Root's torture session in Aletheia and the first thing the Machine did was to apologize to Root). Basically Root's trust extends beyond professional or intellectual and is also personal. So while the Machine not helping her would shake her and make maybe her reluctant to “help” the Machine when the Machine isn't helping her, lying would shatter Root's trust. So in the long term if the Machine wants to continue cooperating with Root, lying would not be very practical, better to weather the storm from the STOP message.  But I am surprised that the Machine isn't explaining things. Maybe it's got something to do with communications being not secure enough (because of Samaritan), but that doesn't really fly since it's not a total blackout and they've communicated via the implant in S4, so why just STOP over the payphone. We've seen how Root has done everything without questioning till now, but that was preceded by dialogues when Root was in the mental hospital, so it's not as if explaining and arguing would be new in that equation."
PersonOfInterest,2uuv88,eikeegimuu,1 point,Fri Feb 6 20:15:22 2015 UTC,"The Machine was only fully communicating via the implant when Samaritan was already onto the team, or Simon Lee in the case of Prophets."
PersonOfInterest,2uuv88,ab_emery,1 point,Fri Feb 6 21:17:22 2015 UTC,"I had the impression that the risk would be bigger for the Machine, not that communicating would help to locate Root (and the whole team when she's with them). Though it probably would do that too, but that shouldn't be a problem, since Root could easily and quickly change her location after having a talk with the Machine.   Of course with every communication Samaritan might get a piece of the puzzle (to track Root's implant or the Machine's nerve center), so that combined effect might be the reason for the radio silence. Still, I'd say that since the radio silence has been broken before current situation would be reason enough to do so again. But maybe the Machine will give some explanations between the lines and in hidden in static once Root is willing to listen to that."
PersonOfInterest,2uuv88,eikeegimuu,1 point,Sat Feb 7 10:36:20 2015 UTC,The machine probably knew that by saying stop that root would just want to leave and do everything to find her... The machine knows all
PersonOfInterest,2uuv88,im_getting_flamed,1 point,Thu Feb 5 14:31:15 2015 UTC,"I think the machine would have succeeded in keeping root in line for a while longer if, instead of simply saying that it knows where Shaw is and telling them to stop looking, it said Shaw is alive, stable and completely out of their reach. Or it should simply have lied and told them that she's dead."
PersonOfInterest,2uuv88,jedp,2,Thu Feb 5 18:38:12 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is the Machine would like to tell them about Shaw, but because it only has seconds to rely messages (before Samaritan tracks it down), it sent the shortest message it could."

They were wondering what to watch next, so I busted out the PoI Pilot and hooked them into the show. Right now, I have them on episodes 7-9 of season 3 this week, so you know it's about to go down!   Tips for OP: Make it a social event. Start an official movie night and host it regularly. Do more than tell them, show them. Having more than one person willing to host helps.

PersonOfInterest,2usy91,Eleanor1984,1 point,Fri Feb 6 05:02:20 2015 UTC,"1.This show benefits greatly from binge-watching. If you have the S1 DVD, let them watch the extended pilot first to see if it grabs them. The broadcasted pilot was way too rushed. The writers planned and shot a 60 min pilot, hoping CBS would give-in but they didn't, so it suffered from the heavy editing.  2.Warn them to persever, as the first 8-9 eps are more procedural and set up the character development. From ep. 10 onwards, it gets more exciting and serialized. Tell them they will be blown away by the way the back-stories of the 2 main characters slowly unfold and how the writers expertly juggle the multiple storylines which then come together and connect so beautifully in the end. Promise them that by the time they reach ep.20-21, they won't be able to tear themselves away from the screen until they have finished the 2 part finale. Let your enthusiasm show. It's infectious and people will be more willing to give it a go.  3.Take note : it's not for everyone. It's an intelligent and sometimes thought-provoking show that doesn't dumb down or talk down to its audience. You might have more success if you target who you talk to. Find out what shows they like. They like good character-driven drama ? Talk about our team dynamic. Crime drama ? Way more exciting than CSI. Spy stories ? Lots of conspiracy plots and Reese is the American James Bond – badass-ery with sophistication and style. Techie geeky stuff or sci-fi ? AI  plotline - main theme of the show, well researched and  frighteningly accurate predictions.  My two cents. Hope it helps.  Edit : forgot this. They like comicbook superhero stuff ? Batman in a suit !"

PersonOfInterest,2uvb1s,sultanofhyd,19,Thu Feb 5 13:38:18 2015 UTC,"For his kidnapping, the episode made it obvious that the cops never have anything to do but sit around and be bored (and have even less to do after Samaritan made life 'perfect' for them), so I doubt they'd miss him if he went out all day for some donuts or to shoot his guns in the woods or something. When Reese said someone was vandalising, the cop ran out as if there were a terror alert or something, they're obviously used to just sitting around all day.  As for Reese/Root being discovered via their police identities, the entire town was turned upside down 6 months before and then turned upside down again in the episode. I doubt he'd think anything other than ""two nutjobs showed up and the lady who was running the town for the past 6 months has bailed out because her new factory was actually doing illegal experiments and fucked up the entire town"".  As far as plotholes go, this one isn't too difficult to put up with imo"
PersonOfInterest,2uvb1s,killerkebab,1 point,Thu Feb 5 14:48:06 2015 UTC,"They also could have erased all the Maple surveillance footage of their faces before leaving.  Reese showing his face to the chief still seems like a reckless and unnecessary risk when his alt ID is actually an NYC cop. But once it's known that they were both fake cops, the cheif is unlikely to go looking for them amongst NYPD. Which itself is a huge number of faces."
PersonOfInterest,2uvb1s,patentlyobvious,6,Fri Feb 6 05:13:14 2015 UTC,"Just a side note, black holes are actually very small, the part that looks like a hole is just the area where gravity is stronger than the speed of light."
PersonOfInterest,2uvb1s,cdawgtv2,4,Thu Feb 5 15:08:55 2015 UTC,"I think this requires a bit of suspension of disbelief to explain (like most things on this show), but I think it's at least believable.  We didn't see Root and Reese identify themselves; what's more, they definitely didn't sign any log or anything, plus it was just that one guy at the counter they would have had to identify themselves to (the chief wasn't paying attention). I wouldn't count on the memory of one guy to remember either of the cover identities by name, regardless of which identities Reese used (Stills or Riley). They may have even just identified themselves as ""NYPD"".  As for how they got the chief out of the building, I only counted three cops including the chief. One left, the other was supposedly looking to some vandalism. It's not hard to believe they could have gotten him out of there; when he was knocked out, the building was empty already.   I've come to assume that unless they otherwise note it, they typically know what they're doing; as in, the writers just say that there wasn't any surveillance in an area when the characters need to do something overt and out of character, like abducting the chief. You just have to roll with the punches sometimes."
PersonOfInterest,2uvb1s,LaunchpadMacQ,2,Thu Feb 5 14:14:43 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, those identities are effectively not visible to Samaritan. Although I agree, they are somewhat cavalier about things sometimes."

Since then, the line, ""the government considers these people irrelevant, we don't"" has always felt a bit dishonest to me, since Finch was the one who created the relevant/irrelevant distinction.  Then again, even on the show, he really downplays how much he didn't used to care about the irrelevant list, and how much it was Nathan, rather than his own conscience, that convinced him to start caring."

PersonOfInterest,2uu722,autowikibot,2,Thu Feb 5 08:13:06 2015 UTC,"Schrödinger's cat:       Schrödinger's cat is a thought experiment, sometimes described as a paradox, devised by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935. It illustrates what he saw as the problem of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics applied to everyday objects. The scenario presents a cat that may be considered as being simultaneously both alive and dead,      this state being tied to an earlier random event. The thought experiment is also often featured in theoretical discussions of the interpretations of quantum mechanics. In the course of developing this experiment, Schrödinger coined the term Verschränkung (entanglement).    Image i - Schrödinger's cat: a cat, a flask of poison, and a radioactive source are placed in a sealed box. If an internal monitor detects radioactivity (i.e. a single atom decaying), the flask is shattered, releasing the poison that kills the cat. The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics implies that after a while, the cat is represented by a wave function that simultaneously includes alive and dead possibilities. Yet, when one looks in the box, one sees the cat either alive or dead, not both alive and dead. This poses the question of when exactly quantum superposition ends and reality collapses into one possibility or the other.

Prior to that, the Machine will have to come to terms with it.  On the other hand, Finch HAS nearly died/been in mortal danger several times.  Root kidnapping him, Greer kidnapping him, etc.  The first time the Machine wasn't even incredibly helpful at getting him back, since Finch had put a block on it protecting him.  So it might not be affected."
PersonOfInterest,2uqylx,Afalstein,5,Wed Feb 4 17:38:13 2015 UTC,"It may just be me, but I think the virus Finch created and which Stanton uploaded has removed this restriction (as an unintended consequence) but the Machine has decided to respect Harold's wishes by not contacting him directly (I know he's said he and the Machine need to talk, but I'm not sure it has actually happened yet - perhaps this is what brings Root back into the fold?)"

PersonOfInterest,2uqylx,smileyman,2,Thu Feb 5 17:24:34 2015 UTC,"I think we've been seeing part of it go off. There have been shot's from Samaritan's POV where it shows that cameras are going offline. Not very many of them and not all at once, but regularly. I think the MacGuffin that Finch uploaded is a virus that's taking away Samaritan's eyes bit by bit.   Take away it's feeds and it's going to be practically helpless. I don't think it will ever completely blind Samaritan, but I do think it will make it much weaker.  Example: multiple sclerosis is a disease that I'm intimately familiar with (my wife has it). In it patients have lesions (sclerosis) on their brain. These lesions effect nerves in the body and can have a wide variety of symptoms, depending on where the lesions are at. I like to think that whatever Finch gave the woman was a machine version of MS, putting lesions on it's ""brain"" so that the information it gets is altered or lacking in some way."
PersonOfInterest,2uqylx,Colt85,3,Thu Feb 5 22:53:27 2015 UTC,That is a very interesting thought.  Would it go on a spree that would put Reese and Root to shame?  That could be awesome.  Or would it honor his peaceful wishes like Fusco not killing Simmons?  That would be touching.  It's cool that the show is setup so they can hark back to earlier story lines and treat them like foreshadowing.  The machine's still too mysterious a character for me to guess one way or the other.
PersonOfInterest,2uqylx,soggy_potato,4,Wed Feb 4 16:59:30 2015 UTC,"Agreed although there are a few things about the machine's character that are definitive.   Harold is Admin. Period. The Machine's desires Harold's approval and chooses to request his affirmation when she's unable to find a solution that saves everyone. The Machine learned about human nature. about people long before it was given it's tasks. It has a clear objective purpose.  The Machine has a bias toward's its agents. It's protective of them. Recall Reese's threat at the end of season 1. ""No one answering your calls."" ""No one being saved"". The team are his connections to the world.  Given the way they've played off every aspect of Samaritan and the Machine as being polar opposites from the philosophy of their design to the architecture to the infrastructure. Not to mention the way their objectives and the manner in which they go about accomplishing their tasks. Samaritan has no true connections to the world. The machine has quite a few"

I disagree with this. She didn't seek Harold's affirmation in If-and-Then with the sacrifice of Shaw, and the Machine had to have known that there was an override that needed to be manually controlled. She sacrificed her queen (Shaw) to get the rest of the group out.    It has a clear objective purpose.   I'm not so sure of this either. Was setting up Harold with Grace an objective purpose? I also get the feeling that the Machine pushed (or at least nudged) Root & Shaw together as well. Was that objective?    Samaritan has no true connections to the world.    Martine has some sort of connection to Samaritan. We've seen her receive directions straight from Samaritan on several occasions, most notably in the hotel."

PersonOfInterest,2upenb,theesado,2,Fri Feb 6 03:43:11 2015 UTC,This quote from Finch has always given me goosebumps. The one person who is completely and always anti violence has been Finch. We always expected Finch to be a voice of reason and for calmer heads to prevail and when you hear him say it with absolute conviction and sincerity it hits you like a freight train that how hard Finch struggles everyday in order to not give in and start answering each bullet with another one of his own. How hard he must fight against his human instinct of fighting and killing the enemy before it kills you.
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,pingike99,2,Sat Feb 7 21:53:31 2015 UTC,God I miss those days
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,ashodhiyavipin,6,Tue Feb 10 18:09:37 2015 UTC,"well Reese didn't go insane :). Roots going insane over this. You can just tell through the way she's doing this, drilling a Woman's' hand, shooting many Samaritan operatives in the knees in that facility :)"
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,TJlive800,2,Wed Feb 4 21:12:37 2015 UTC,Remember him blowing up the guys who did Simmons' IDs and then just leaving them there to burn?   If anything Root was positively restrained in this episode by comparison. Also I don't think the Samaritan operatives in the facility were knee-capped. I think they were definitely killed.
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,Gouldde,2,Thu Feb 5 10:58:34 2015 UTC,Something tells me that girl who teamed with Fusco will end up joining the team in a role similar to Fusco's

PersonOfInterest,2upenb,S-Skyler,53,Thu Feb 5 09:50:15 2015 UTC,"Well although it does care about shaw, it knows they can't take on Samaritan's forces without too much risk."

PersonOfInterest,2upenb,kaput_porpoise,39,Wed Feb 4 04:07:08 2015 UTC,"Yop, it probably wants them to stop now, and wait for better opportunity or something."
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,your_mind_aches,10,Wed Feb 4 04:15:03 2015 UTC,"I believe it'd be more effective in keeping root in line if it simply said that Shaw's alive and stable, but out of reach. It says it knows, but I can't see any reason not to tell them. Or just lie and say she's dead."
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,Pascalwb,6,Wed Feb 4 10:14:21 2015 UTC,"The Machine understands root completely and she knows the value of lie to a human. If The Machine lies to root about shaw, and she turns up later in front of the gang. The Machine can loose it only analog interface to the human world.   The Machine knows not to go that way. Same way it knows Shaw is alive and time has to be allowed to make contact again."
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,jedp,2,Wed Feb 4 14:52:30 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Which will be interesting to see because Greer presumably wants to use Shaw to track and/or take down team machine, perhaps among other things.   So the machine may be limited in how much it can help her if she ends up rigged with all sort of Samaritan tracking/monitoring devices in her body. Maybe it will be able to hack them and use them against Samartian, or to get an inside look into Samaritans plans."
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,ashodhiyavipin,5,Tue Feb 10 18:15:18 2015 UTC,Did anyone else see a parallel between SPOILER and the flashback where SPOILER
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,patentlyobvious,50,Thu Feb 5 12:35:56 2015 UTC,"Stanton: where am I? Greer: the afterlife, my dear.  Shaw: if this is the afterlife, it sucks."
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,SnowgoonC,39,Wed Feb 4 04:37:19 2015 UTC,Definitely caught that as well--it makes me a little nervous for the future of Shaw.
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,rossbot,15,Wed Feb 4 13:48:36 2015 UTC,Kara didn't know who Greer was. Shaw does. Shaw can't be manipulated by Greer like Kara was because she knows better.

PersonOfInterest,2upenb,your_mind_aches,23,Wed Feb 4 04:13:33 2015 UTC,Imagine if someone told you just last episode that Root would lose faith in the Machine.
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,covington,6,Wed Feb 4 05:38:06 2015 UTC,"Given that she is apparently not going to be back on the show any time soon, I actually would have preferred they leave her survival in question. Leave us viewers to experience some of the same uncertainty as the characters."
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,Kell08,24,Thu Feb 5 03:30:23 2015 UTC,"The story of her not being back soon makes me happy as it means they think there will be a show still in two years time for her to come back to, but in the other hand it means these bad guys will be about that long surely?"
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,government_shill,13,Wed Feb 4 17:16:05 2015 UTC,I imagine Samaritan is going to prove quite resilient.
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,jamiestewart48,8,Wed Feb 4 18:15:07 2015 UTC,Yeah but they're gonna do some nasty cyborg shit to her :(
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,government_shill,13,Wed Feb 4 18:15:55 2015 UTC,I almost jumped up and cheered.

I wonder how many other ""ant farm"" towns Samaritan is running? I wonder just how much information Samaritan can get from the people brain transponders into?  Can it tell what someone is thinking or feeling by monitoring their brain chemistry? If it didn't put a brain transponder into Shaw (and since she didn't have a bandage on her head, I think we can assume that it didn't), I wonder what it plans to use her for."

PersonOfInterest,2upenb,pensee_idee,12,Wed Feb 4 04:12:46 2015 UTC,"I think showing where they all were shipping was designed to give us an inkling, those have to go to factories that know how to use them too."
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,ReasonablyBadass,5,Wed Feb 4 13:06:29 2015 UTC,"Another one: why didn't the machine tell them that Shaw's alive and stable, but out of reach? It'd keep root in line for a while longer. Or it could just lie and tell them that she's dead."
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,Conglossian,3,Wed Feb 4 08:45:03 2015 UTC,Perhaps the Machine genuinely thinks Shaw is dead.
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,jedp,4,Wed Feb 4 14:57:40 2015 UTC,The hospital looked very similar to the one Stanton shaw  was 'treated' in.
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,DFreiberg,2,Thu Feb 5 03:36:40 2015 UTC,"1.) Hundreds of thousands maybe judging by the size of the boxes and how long the factory has been going.   2.) I bet not many. It seems to me that the computing power required to collect all the data on even a few thousand people would be enormous. It would be difficult to get vary many of those up and running.   3.) I imagine it reads things like heart rate, brain activity, blood pressure and that sort of thing. So it can monitor people and read how they're reacting based on physiological data (sort of like a high-tech lie detector test).   4.) I bet they did put one in her. Or they will. I have to wonder if the transponder can receive data impulses as well, or just send them. If it can receive data, maybe the show will try to use that to show a super-effective brain washing technique. Or maybe it's a way for the Machine to get a new analogue interface?"
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,GoSTaRnE,2,Fri Feb 6 02:56:35 2015 UTC,Being kidnapped by Root seems to be a small price to pay for copping a feel of dat ass.
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,smileyman,57,Thu Feb 5 22:32:35 2015 UTC,That one was one hell of a squeeze. I'd imagine Acker got pissed off by that.

PersonOfInterest,2upenb,TBBklynite,7,Wed Feb 4 04:05:56 2015 UTC,"I would've rather had the suspense. It's unlike the writers to just break the suspense like that. It's almost like the episode was lacking a bit, and they just wanted to throw something in at the end. I hope I'm wrong."

She was a minimum-wage employee who died of a heart attack, who got brought back to life, given a good job, and the chance to give the unemployed people of some shitty little town good jobs too.    I think she suspected that something wasn't right about the situation, but she was probably scared to death to ask questions, and in general, things were good pretty well.

PersonOfInterest,2upenb,your_mind_aches,2,Thu Feb 5 01:24:10 2015 UTC,Is there no opening narration anymore?  It seems like that has been missing from the last few episodes.  Or are my recordings starting a minute too late?
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,naeads,9,Thu Feb 5 23:00:10 2015 UTC,"This happened last year, too.  They took a few eps off before they revealed new credits without Carter. I assume that may be the case now."
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,lordxeon,8,Wed Feb 4 10:44:40 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the intro was already stale.  When Shaw's cover was blown, the animation effect should have changed.  I'm referring to the transition from ""PRIMARY THREAT"" to ""IRRELEVANT""."
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,axisiiclusterb,6,Wed Feb 4 04:32:37 2015 UTC,"The intros have been pretty flashback heavy.  Last episode was from the Government's perspective, so it made sense to have a Control voice-over."
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,Rolcol,6,Wed Feb 4 04:47:08 2015 UTC,I assume its because they need the extra time to fit all the scenes they want in.
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,Rolcol,2,Wed Feb 4 13:17:06 2015 UTC,"Imagine what Samaritan could do if it ""revives"" coma patients and figured out how to use us them as puppets. No need for unnecessary variables."

PersonOfInterest,2upenb,amelia84,8,Wed Feb 4 18:17:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, somehow having Samaritan directly control people's bodies feels like it would be out of character for the show.  Having it be able to monitor something in their brains, having it be able to coerce them, hell, even having it find new and better ways to get people to serve it willingly all somehow feel better in terms of the technology the show's had so far."

I hope she doesn't have some sort of monitoring hardware in her that would reveal the teams identities."
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,crossbowincident,2,Thu Feb 5 12:10:17 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping for something in the 9.7-9.8 range on IMDB, that would give Person of Interest 6 episodes in the top 30 of all time, most of any TV show.   For context, second place would be Breaking Bad, which has 3."
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,patentlyobvious,6,Wed Feb 4 03:29:40 2015 UTC,"Holy... The first time I saw that blonde woman from Maple, I thought she was Martines mother or something like that. Uncanny :D Also: Harold taught Root how to care about people, now she might care to much... And a Root that has lost her faith in the machine will be VERY scary. Can't wait :/"
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,Conglossian,7,Thu Feb 5 12:17:14 2015 UTC,"A very emotional episode.   ""I couldn't stand to lose someone today"" - Fusco"
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,emselino,10,Wed Feb 4 08:40:58 2015 UTC,"Okay, first, resolving the tension of Shaw's life like that worked out well. We waited long enough, so getting an answer was appreciated, even if we are gonna go through a LOT more pain between now and the reunion. So there's that.  I also choose to take Ms. Thompson from Pittsburgh as my own private little shout-out, so there's that too (but I'm probably just being egocentric here).  All that said... What a waste of a plot! The idea of Samaritan running an entire small town is something that could have been FAR creepier than it was played here. That it all came about as a shaggy-dog story just twists the knife even further... this is the kind of really deep, novel science fiction that POI promises, but this one just didn't deliver. Unfortunately because it was used here it's doubtful we'll get a chance to see another of Samaritan's ant farms, so it's hard to swallow the bitter taste here.  Beyond all that, though, this was pretty average. Acting was okay, the Fusco-plot was eh, and the progression of the arc was, though frustrating, still enough. I'm mildly upset that Root is starting to become a doubting Thomas of sorts, and also that this seems to be setting up a return to number-of-the-week stories for a few weeks, but I'm not gonna judge the next episode by its preview. The previews have been awful lately, so I'm gonna just put this behind me and hope we see something with some meat on its bones soon."
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,POI_Harold-Finch,18,Wed Feb 4 10:37:34 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping the Samaritan Ant Farm was just another of their planted seeds, that will come back into greater focus at a later time. Otherwise, I agree, it was a waste of a phenomenal idea."

PersonOfInterest,2upenb,covington,4,Wed Feb 4 04:39:17 2015 UTC,"Patience, phoebe. The Antfarm is too big a plot to not explore in detail. The writers mentioned that they prefer the slowburn approach, and this most definitely falls into that."
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,Aimless_Drifter,18,Wed Feb 4 13:46:57 2015 UTC,"The whole ant farm plot was probibly suppose to be its own thing, but they had to as Shaw on top of it after sarah became pregnant."
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,EThorns,4,Wed Feb 4 20:58:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the episode was average but not every episode can be action-packed. Think of this as a set-up for a great punchline."

Someone should have monitored my heart-rate! It shot up! SO FUCKING HAPPY! I freaked out when I saw her on the screen. AHH, missed you so much, Shaw! WELCOME BACK! (Even though it is not for very long)"
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,cmac__17,6,Wed Feb 4 05:03:23 2015 UTC,Am I the only one dying to see Martine's backstory?
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,ThatFag,5,Wed Feb 4 17:38:26 2015 UTC,"A solid episode with lots of goodies. The main theme was of course Root's and Reese's search for Shaw but the number of week plot was pretty nice and showed how Fusco is dealing with previous events.   Considering we know that even if Shaw will eventually be back it will not happen any day soon the result of the search was predetermined, but I thought it added to the atmosphere. The town felt a little claustrophobic and like a dead end, which it turned out to be. Root got beautifully in touch with her erm … roots both by doing some hacking and letting the not so zen side of her shine through (and operate a medical drill).  Root and Reese working together went as well as I thought – which is very well. Reese was supportive (even or especially when also busy restraining his own anger). Supportive to Root that is, not so much to the blonde to whom he instead delivered a message about personal responsibility when taking orders (speaking also from personal experience one assumes).  The blonde towns-person was believable as a victim, but somehow I could also see her taking on a different role once the dust settles (though I think Samaritan wouldn't have bothered with a fake past identity, so she probably was what she seemed).   The biggest fly in the ointment was that judging from the last phonecall and Root's reactions Root is not going to be around more in the second half of the season than in the first half. Not really shocker that the show will not turn into a weekly quest to find Shaw and no surprise either that Root isn't willing to accept that. But that doesn’t bode well for Root's screen time. Dammit.  I didn't expect that they'd show Shaw at the end but actually that was a good move since what else are we going to think – that the fairy godmother whisked her away from the basement floor, nope, obviously Samaritan/Greer has her. So it's good that they didn't drag the dead/alive thing on. Also, Shaw was pretty spry for a chick that got shot several times pretty recently. Hope the big plans don't turn out to be anything to do with mind control or switching sides (even if it turns out to be undercover), that would be tacky. So far she's not really tied to the ant farm experiments. Hope it stays this way, but if not - monitoring would be ok (and since she has a Axis-II disorder maybe that would make sense to use her as a test subject – probably Samaritan wants to sample anyway all checkpoints of the spectrum), mind control not so much.   Some other things to mention are:  The police department scenes and R&R treating the chief to a little NY hospitality in their hotel room.  Root illuminating some of what draws her to Shaw. Little firecracker. Well, well.  Root self-medicating with some gunfire (as she diagnosed already in last episode that a little confrontation involving firearms is good for her) after finding a clerk instead of Shaw.  My first thought when they showed that girl in the bed was that it's Claire (the number from Nautilus). Actually I think I'd prefer that to whatever SL they'll choose for her.  Reese turning his back to a gunman to shield an “irrelevant” was a classic.  Fusco's and Silva's last scene was pretty good.  Somehow I didn't like the soundtrack at the end in the payphone scene. One of the very few occasions where I've felt during watching POI that the music doesn't work, maybe because the scene was emotional enough to stay afloat without that (or maybe the music was louder or more intrusive than usual or started too soon or something). The scene itself was of course great, but I would have expected nothing less with Root and Harold together and with what they were discussing."

One question, isn't Samaritan watching  the same cameras as Machine? So if they are talking about Shaw etc. wouldn't they reveal themselves? Or are the 6 servers taking care of that?"
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,cmac__17,5,Wed Feb 4 02:56:46 2015 UTC,My assumption was that the servers they used do beyond facial recognition. Samaritan has a block when it comes to any type of ability to track team machine.
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,Pascalwb,3,Wed Feb 4 02:59:42 2015 UTC,"Yup. It seems the servers block Samaritan's ability to infer they're the people it's looking for. Otherwise he'd recognize his image processing algorithms are malfunctioning and use other clues to recognize them.  I wonder what kind of cognitive dissonance it must be suffering from now? It apparently knows it's broken, but can't figure out a way to fix itself. An interesting plot point would be for the whole server trick to backfire on Team Machine by driving Samaritan literally insane."
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,slashetsy,4,Wed Feb 4 10:11:06 2015 UTC,Never before has the sound of a heart monitor brought such relief.
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,TeMPOraL_PL,3,Wed Feb 4 18:48:17 2015 UTC,"Here is another out there theory.  What if Greer realises Samaritan has gone too far? He wants to stop it, but can't do so publicly. So he ordered his team to kidnap Shaw while Samaritan doesn't have eyes in the basement to secretly get Shaw to maybe help bring Samaritan down and also possibly get a message to Harold?"
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,Tesseon,5,Thu Feb 5 01:30:53 2015 UTC,Greer's is a zealous fanatic.  His origin story if anything solidified his rationale that what he is doing is for the greater good of all humanity. We cannot be left to govern ourselves.
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,hopenoonefindsthis,12,Thu Feb 5 11:55:10 2015 UTC,"But why would Greer think that?  He wants people to be controlled.  He sees Samaritan as a God, and he wants to witness the world it creates.  Greer has no problems killing people, so these social experiments likely don't weigh down his conscience at all.  Well, to play out your hypothetical, it would be more effective to go directly to Team Machine.  They have covers that Samaritan can't see through, but Shaw is already compromised.  As a former spy, he knows how to hide.  He's used techniques to hide already from The Machine."
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,concerned_thirdparty,7,Wed Feb 4 11:52:48 2015 UTC,"My predictions:  We won't see Root or Shaw again for a very long time, possibly not even until Season 5. The rest of this season will be focused on John, Finch, and the numbers, with Fusco and possibly that new rookie detective lady. We will probably also see the conclusion of the Dominic/gang warfare/Elias storyline.   Shaw will eventually reappear and be brainwashed by Samaritan, she will have orders to kill Root and they will both go head-to-head in an epic dramatic battle where Root refuses to kill Shaw (even though she's brainwashed), resulting in Root's demise."

Certain network shows with shorter seasons with late premieres tend to have the season wrapped before the pilot airs as well. Two examples of this season are FOX's Backstrom, and NBC's upcoming Aquarius."

PersonOfInterest,2upenb,lordxeon,2,Wed Feb 4 12:37:00 2015 UTC,"The brain chips were a bit more genre cheese than this show needs, imho. I can see them doing bionic shaw, maybe trying to have her fake mind control - this is a hypothetical next season, mind you - but if they do real mind control, this show then has jumped the shark, and they have lost me. I don't believe they'll do it. I do believe that if they brought shaw back, giving her a direct line to samaritan that functions as a sort of double edged sword would be fascinating. But even that is a bit of a stretch for a show keeping company with NCIS."
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,faux-name,2,Wed Feb 4 04:15:02 2015 UTC,I don't think the chips will do any control at all. The purpose that was stated in the show sounds most fitting and plausible - monitoring bioelectrical brain status as an additional input for Samaritan's quest to understand people.
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,shinsaikou,4,Wed Feb 4 12:20:07 2015 UTC,"Maybe it not real mind control, maybe it just shocks your brain if you disobey or something like that."

PersonOfInterest,2upenb,Rich700000000000,2,Thu Feb 5 01:33:43 2015 UTC,I think it's safe to assume SHaw doesn't have an transponder in her had. She looked too damn pretty for being just back from a brain surgery.
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,TeMPOraL_PL,6,Wed Feb 4 12:27:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they shave your head for craniotomies. It would have been pretty obvious."
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,SnapemataDumbledore,2,Thu Feb 5 01:34:16 2015 UTC,"This was a really great episode, and they gave us some closure, at the very least. I'm disappointed for a very specific reason, though.  I thought the two storylines worked well in tandem: they were both very unsettling and focused on things that weren't what they seemed. Dani Silva is being pushed as Shaw's replacement, and I'm surprisingly ok with that. She's got spunk and she's a layered character with plenty left to learn about being a good cop and what it really means to save people. I feel like there's a good amount of potential there.  Now, I can come up with dozens of cheesy names for it, but I was really digging Root and Reese's road trip adventure (Root & Reese Go To White Castle? Root & Reese Do America?). We were getting two characters that were previously very much at odds in ideology converge over loss. I understand that Reese has always had a much bigger role than Root in the scheme of things, but they were very much on the same page in these last two episodes. So, I'm kind if disappointed that Root is going AWOL following Harold trying to talk her down, because she has no reason to believe Reese would stop helping to find Shaw at this juncture; I mean, he was down with drilling holes through people's hands, I'm pretty sure he'd be down for some more searching, reassessing clues, etc. That's not to say I don't agree with Harold's point, especially since while they search for Shaw more numbers are slipping through the cracks, but I believe Reese would have been on-board with continuing the search, especially in light of his reaction to Carter's death.   Also, to emphasize the point, Root is actually going AWOL - it doesn't look like she's appearing in the next episode, which quite frankly sucks. I love the focus she's been getting in the last few weeks, especially since she feels pretty pivotal at the moment; not just in terms of Shaw, but her role has been expanded on pretty heavily since this season began in new and interesting directions.   Anyway, I'm kind of excited to get a ""numbers"" episode next week in spite of all that. I love the serialized story arc, but I also love a good procedural episode. Feels like it's going to be a throwback to the early episodes when Finch and Reese worked the numbers alone with Fusco supporting."
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,LaunchpadMacQ,5,Wed Feb 4 14:56:04 2015 UTC,"To follow the Root /Reese line, it seems to me that both Reese and Harold are writing Shaw off to readily. They know that Greer was MI-6 (although not that Martine was an investigator for the dreaded Hague)and have to realize (especially Reese a former ""international spy"") that Decima would try to get intel out of Shaw and do whatever possible to keep her alive. Since they didn't see her fatally shot it seems this would be a probable scenario. You knew the person they were looking for wasn't going to be Shaw but I was surprised to see her at the end since they usually let you hang. Root's reaction was amazing _ shocked disappointment to full bore ""everyone is going to die""!"

I think the reason they show her alive is that the writers want to keep a open door for her to come back. But I fear for POI. Reese, Finch and root is not enough to keep the show going in my opion.  Shaw was to me an great action female hero. She looked like she could punch somebody in the face at it hurt. Most female actors does not look like that."
PersonOfInterest,2upenb,jotru,5,Wed Feb 4 01:54:14 2015 UTC,"The way this episode showed off Dani, she could be brought in to fill the empty role, if they needed her.  I liked the earlier seasons of the show where recurring characters were bought in on a situational basis.  Like Zoe or Leon."

I like the Samaritan story but I like our characters more and I need to see that they aren't just cut-outs. That's why I enjoyed this episode - it actually made me feel sorry for Root, and made me sympathise with Fusco and Finch, and made my admiration for Reese grow. On top of an incredible AI story.  I feel like the ant-farm idea can easily be revisited - but it should not have been the fore-front issue in an episode that needed to be emotional in order to truly work. That's why I enjoyed the episode."
PersonOfInterest,2uqo8t,bandformywagon,12,Wed Feb 4 09:40:24 2015 UTC,"Loved:   Root- It seems like a few of you guys don't like her that much, but I think she has the best character development of the show.  Everything she says or does is just fascinating to me.  Shaw  Finch  Reese  Elias  Hated:  Greer- Kind of love to hate him.  Simmons, for obvious reasons.  Alonso Quinn  Kara Stanton  Martine- Another one I love to hate."
PersonOfInterest,2uqo8t,DismemberMama,6,Wed Feb 4 14:29:32 2015 UTC,"Ditto on Root, my favorite character besides Bear:)"
PersonOfInterest,2uqo8t,Staff_of_the_Goths,4,Wed Feb 4 22:53:52 2015 UTC,"Most loved:   1) Definitely Root – a fantastic character. I thought she was a great adversary, but when Root first got that call in the hospital implying that she'll return I was apprehensive, because I thought they are just going to drag it out and thereby dilute a good villain. However they took her story in a different direction than I thought and somewhere between the middle and end of the third season (with some good bits in the mental hospital paving the way) Root emerged as the most awesome character ever. One of the things I like about Root is her blend of vulnerability and (capacity for) cruelty. So for me Root is a unique character based on that alone, since usually with (in the broadest sense) similar characters entitlement intervenes and so either the vulnerability or the cruelty seem fake and the character bratty. With Root I also like that she doesn't hold back and once she commits she's all in. I like that she can call someone Australopithecine (ahem, I had to google it just now) and make it not seem like a screenwriter was just looking for a fancier word for a typical insult, but in character. I like her intelligence and charm and her wit and that she exhibits both arrogance and humility and all those things make her only more human not out of character. And so on. Basically she can hit any note and be on key. Also, obviously the writing has to be good, but Amy Acker is just amazing.  2)/ 3) Harold and Reese – with one of them maybe slightly in the lead if either is in a strong episode, but basically I like both and couldn't really choose.  Reese is the strong silent (and occasionally quipping) type, but his sensitivity is more believable than usual in action heroes. All the ladies he's teamed up with for mayhem have been more sadistic than him and Reese has been the reflective one, who feels compassion and is remorseful. BTW one of my favourite Reese scenes is him answering Grace's question about Harold.   Harold I thought likeable from the beginning but it took a couple of seasons before I really started to like him. He is a character that (like Root) could go in any direction and make it work. He has been established as kind and empathic, but the interesting thing is the question how much of an effort he has to make to uphold himself to a high moral code. There is after all still that guy in there too who decided on “irrelevants” being irrelevant and that what matters is scale. So he has a scary practical side to him and I could see his character making different decisions and feeling justified in all of them.  4) Fusco – he was in beginning a typical slightly sleazy dirty cop but has almost on the sly developed into the guy he is now. Not sure how that happened, since his character hasn't had big turnarounds or revelations and somehow he's been always in character, so his progression has been slow and steady and believable. Have to say I like Fusco's wilful ignorance about the Machine and that he even doesn't try to make sense of it or demand answers, he knows he has the opportunity to do some good and that's what matters to him.   5) I guess Shaw, sorta – hey, can't give that fifth “Most loved” spot to a villain after all and Shaw did grow on me, even though I think her emotional “limitations” are limiting my capacity to fully care for her and for me she doesn't always seem to be IN character - like I thought it was maybe a too big switch from threatening to kill a guy who's planning to kill himself to getting one clue from Fusco and turning all Roma Downey on Touched by an Angel. So I don't know whether it's the Axis thing that throws me off or I just don't quite get the character, but there are some reservation even though I did come to like her.  Biggest fails (in the sense that for whatever reason these characters didn't work for me)   1) Carter – I'll be probably downvoted now, but what the hell. Honesty is the best policy, right :P Plus, this post has probably turned out too long for anyone to get to this point anyway :) In the beginning I was neutral and prepared to like the character, but I just couldn't. I gave up for good with the HR arc (might also be a touch of the chicken or the egg there, but I think I wouldn’t have liked that arc with anybody else either). I think the moral compass type of character is in general difficult, because if that character fails to connect, the conceived positive traits transform into entitlement and Mary Sueness. I didn't connect with the character, so that happened for me with Carter. Aaand I refrain from further comments.  2) The Samaritan avatar boy – he's been in only 2 episodes, so maybe there's a way to salvage that, but if the show stays with how he's been so far, then it's a disappointment. The actor is fine or as you'd expect in the role but I just can't get behind the concept (but I can hope that maybe POI has some surprises in store).  3) Collier – while I didn't like the character either, he gets a spot here not for the acting or how the character was written, but because his appearance was distracting for me, no slight to the casting agent either. Just a quirk. No offence is meant (though I guess there's no way to express this without being offensive), but just as I can't take Julia Roberts seriously in any role because the teeth distract me too much (thinking back maybe I shouldn't have read Ligea and Berenice as a teenager or thinking even further back possibly even listened Little Red Riding Hood as a bedtime story) I couldn't look at Collier and not think that any minute he's either gonna drop a line about little grey cells (and of course the only Belgian on the show is supposed to be Bear) or don some high heels and move to Vegas. Not really a reflection of the character, but there it is.  No 4 and 5, since the post has turned out too long as it is (and no one else really stood out that bad – though there have of course been also characters I've been more or less indifferent about or have not liked, but I wouldn’t expect anyway that every character hits the bull's-eye)."
PersonOfInterest,2uqo8t,eikeegimuu,5,Thu Feb 5 15:02:38 2015 UTC,"Kinda hard to do when it includes the main characters!  Love:  Reese - in addition to being incredibly badass, I love how Reese can be very gentle and caring. He's as good at talking people down as he is at shooting them.  Finch - I'm a computer guy who believes in a benevolent AI, so Finch is very easy to empathize with for me. He's perhaps the most morally pure character, too.  Elias - I've liked every scene with him. Great screen presence, and he's a mob boss who appears likeable.   Shaw - I love the sarcastic deadpan attitude.  Root - great character development, her outlook is very interesting. My one complaint about her, and about the show's writing, is that her transition from a cold-hearted killer to being one of the good guys seems a bit of a stretch. But before mid-season 3, Carter!  Don't like:  Kara Stanton - smug, arrogant, sadistic killer who never asks why. She has the personality traits of Reese and Root at their worst, without any of the good ones.  Simmons - a character made to hate. He's also a realistic character - a typical dirty cop who just helps organized crime.  Greer - impossible to like somebody who thinks he should have control over humanity.  Dominic - because he's taking on Elias. The character is well done though, and the actor delivered some lines very well.  Collier - he was basically a domestic terrorist with delusions of grandeur, and a coward. When Vigilance was in a fight, Collier would walk away while others fought. I wanted to like this character actually, but I think they gave him a backstory too late, just before he was killed. Could have been more sympathetic otherwise."

Either way I'd think that Nolan has discussed things and that type of promotion strategy with the actors that strategy concerns. But even if not, that's maybe not a big deal in the business and the actors are able to not take personally if the story goes in a direction that excludes them.

The last few episodes in the season are really one big story chopped into weekly segments, but watching through them one right after another, it's like watching an episode of Sherlock. Speaking of which, I think the last time I've seen a season finish in a way as awesome and fantastic was Sherlock! There's twists and turns, things that make you go ""ooh, this explains why X"" and things that make you go ""right, that was interesting, I guess, but now I have a question about Y"", and they answer most every question without being boring or making up new shit just to cover up a glaring plothole.

PersonOfInterest,2ukd28,ashodhiyavipin,2,Wed Feb 4 10:29:35 2015 UTC,"Actually, this is one instance in English that the passive voice is the best choice, because there is some mystery about what is watching."
PersonOfInterest,2ukd28,KarlKastor,2,Tue Feb 3 00:36:39 2015 UTC,"Well, it is a little bit more complicated. When it comes to active/passive, yes, it is active voice in Slovak. However, in this case it still does not reveal who or what is watching you, since Slovak language knows such thing as a withheld subject and it is used here as well. Basically, you can tell according to the suffix of the verb who it is that is watching you (in the meaning you can say it is ""them"", not ""you"", ""he"", or ""she""), but the actual word ""they"" is not present. We can afford this since our verb suffixes change, so we do not need to rely on other words in the sentence to convey a message. Similarly, in an example ""It is raining"", English language uses the word ""it"". In Slovak, the meaning of the sentence stays the same, referring to some ""it"" that is raining, but we do not use the word itself, we withhold it, because the suffix of the verb changes and already tells us that it is ""it"" that is raining, therefore a literal translation of ""Prší"" (which means ""It is raining"") would be ""Is raining"". Welcome to Slovak 101 :)"

I will edit this comment when I get home tonight.  EDIT: So, here goes. I used 10 adjustment layers with effects and just enabled or disabled the layers as I saw fit. Here are the layers labeled how I named them for easy recognition and then I describe the effect used on that layer.   Fish eye - pretty self-explanatory, effect used: ft-Lens Distortion Picture distortion - this was used to imitate the static scramble of old analog TVs, I keyframed it to be used only for a fraction of a second, effect used: DE_Skew Shift pieces - randomly takes a portion of the image and shows it elsewhere on the screen, as in a corrupted video footage, effect used: DE_Artifact Stutter - reverse and replay a fraction of a second, creating a stutter-like effect, similar to what can be done with audio on old vinyl records, effect used: DE_Blockade Washout - make the color less vivid, more CCTV-like, effect used: Solid Composite Color separation - split the color spectrum, making the video look more damaged, effect used: ft-Lens Distortion Noise - making the image more grainy, effect used: Noise Lines - adding horizontal lines, another piece to making it look more CCTV-like, effect used: Venetian Blinds Color stripes - adding slightly colored rectangles, making it look like old VHS tape recordings, effect used: DE_Blockade Ghosting - repeating the image very close to its original location (moving it a few pixels), creating the effect called ghosting on old analog TVs, effect used: DE_Skew   Of course, these effects had to be configured to achieve the right outcome, it was just trial-and-error till I hit the sweet spot. Then there were the texts, time, tracking squares, etc..."

But again we don't know the smaritan's BIG picture. Does it want to control the world and put a show on or just control the world from behind the scenes. A coules of drones flying around town will raise a lot of questions from a lot of people. I don't think smaritan wants such kind of attention right now.
PersonOfInterest,2ulvlz,SecuredEyes,3,Tue Feb 3 06:14:41 2015 UTC,well Samaritan did use a remote of sorts when they sent the bicycle rider in to spy on Control.

PersonOfInterest,2ulvlz,pensee_idee,3,Tue Feb 3 16:10:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if that will happen, due to purely external reasons (not reasons internal to the story.)  In order for Samaritan to use drones to spy on our heroes, the show's producers would need to fly one or more drones in every episode that features them.  I'm not sure how expensive that would be, but I do know that the FAA is not really in love with drone flights, and NYC might have its own regulations regarding their use.  It may not be legally possible (or if it is possible, it may not be worth the paperwork hassle) to include drones as a regular part of the show.  On the other hand, internal to the storyline, it would make perfect sense for either the Machine or Samaritan, or both, to sometimes use drones to fill in blind spots."
PersonOfInterest,2ulvlz,Jon_Snow990,2,Tue Feb 3 23:21:17 2015 UTC,I have a friend in the drone industry who said that he sells his Ro clients for upwards of 10k depending on the specific hardware the client has added to the drones. I watch another show (Hawaii Five-0) that has shot an episode with a drone on camera before. I'm assuming that PoI has the resources to make this happen purely from a fiscal standpoint.

I have encountered them many times before but luckily, since I was prepared, I escaped relatively unharmed.   They will try and poison you with their thoughts, hoping to make you as miserable as they are. They will feed you the seed that Carter dying or Shaw being introduced are the main reasons why PoI has gone downhill in the ratings but that is a very primitive way of looking at PoI's ratings. (The real reason why PoI went down in the ratings started in the latter half of season 1, right around when PoI started to get serialized.)  They will whine about how the show is not how it used to be with just Finch and Reese saving the day every week even though the show was never about the two of them saving the day. It was always about a team rescuing people.   They complain that Carter dying ruined the show for them and how another black person bites the dust.  They argue that PoI is pushing a gay agenda with the kiss even though it clearly is not.  You know what these bunch of people are? Whiners. I wish the Machine wrote a script that blocked these people from going onto anything PoI related because they are not there to enhance conversations but bring down discussions to a grinding halt with their incessant whining, crying and complaining.

(Especially code from companies that employ people like me.) No amount of source-level verification or scrutiny will protect you from using untrusted code. In demonstrating the possibility of this kind of attack, I picked on the C compiler. I could have picked on any program-handling program such as an assembler, a loader, or even hardware microcode. As the level of program gets lower, these bugs will be harder and harder to detect. A well installed microcode bug will be almost impossible to detect.   So we have from 4x06Pretenders this line: ""You're sure you installed it in her computer?"" and Greer saying Samaritan is interested in her algorithms.  If Samaritan uses something she made, it's totally possible our team has already weaponized/backdoored it"
PersonOfInterest,2ufk5k,ab_emery,8,Sun Feb 1 19:02:00 2015 UTC,"He had nothing to gain by talking about Samaritan.   Also, it would have been too much like pointing fingers and basically drawing the fire away from himself (and Finch did just the opposite by volunteering to “testify”). Not that it would have been of any use - Collier was too far gone to be reached. Harold's best argument was that with the Machine mistakes like with Collier's brother wouldn't happen and Collier shook that off.   The only reason for Harold to discuss Samaritan would have been to alert the government guy also there, but with that he would have put that guy in more danger (perhaps on Decima's hit list) and thus ultimately unable to help anyway."
PersonOfInterest,2ufk5k,eikeegimuu,3,Sun Feb 1 20:15:21 2015 UTC,Yes - it didn't make any narrative sense for Harold to do that. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that you can't argue with someone like Collier - a gullible person turned fanatic.

PersonOfInterest,2udz5b,Code_NY,1 point,Sun Feb 1 20:36:59 2015 UTC,"Root wasn't really an admin when she was given God mode, admin suggests the ability to gain access to the Machine and the ability to alter certain aspects of it, however this is never done.  The point of god mode was to trick those that seeked it a belief that it would give them ultimate access but it could not be accessed, you just asked it something and it gave you an answer, also if Reese was in god mode with full admin access then the Machine wouldn't have a problem telling Reese where Finch was it couldn't do that ""I'm sorry but I cannot do that, Reese.""  or ""Computer says No!  Cough""  As said yellow only means knowledge of the Machine and that's that.  The only person who is and will always be admin is Finch."
PersonOfInterest,2udz5b,Trueogre,1 point,Mon Feb 2 18:56:32 2015 UTC,"No it just means she's aware of the Machine. In my personal opinion it also means that she's a person the Machine has a special interest in keeping tabs on.  If the yellow square meant Admin status, Reese would have been an Admin since Season 1 ... and he barely knew about the Machine then. (Also I think it's funny picturing Reese as an Admin)"

PersonOfInterest,2uaawo,Gadafro,12,Sat Jan 31 08:07:44 2015 UTC,"If-Then-Else (second highest rated TV series episode on IMDB, impressive!). I assume this might be common, but I love the way the episode systematically takes everything away from the viewer, then gives it back (or well, some of it). Finch dying got me the first time, and I kinda looked at it funny as if ""that did not just happen did it?"", then it plays it as a simulation. After that, even though we then know the rest are simulations (besides the obvious), it still gets you a little, such as when Reese dies protecting Fusco / Root dies after talking to Shaw in the simulation.  Even the humour is unique. I love the simplified solution (E.g. - ""Coolly delivered, sadistic warning""), and how it shows how the machine understands humanity. It [the episode and the writers] humanised something that I previously thought of as nothing more than a... well... machine. It saw through Root and Shaw easily.  Shaw's situation also draws parallels to Carter's death in my opinion. It seems to end with the Machine trying so hard to rectify what has / is going to happen. The scene with the Machine trying to find a solution (yet failing) reminds me of the phone ringing when Carter was shot.    Furthermore, the episode gave the series two paths. Is Shaw coming back? Is she dead? This is more than likely something we wont know in Shahi is ready to give the creators/writers an answer. Its awesome not being able to predict something. PoI wasn't really predictable in the first place, but it did have a path.   Also, I love the fact that Fusco, despite the Machine being mentioned, is still oblivious to it. He'll find out eventually I assume, but hey, its neat that they can believably keep that part of the storyline going.   Finally, I love Glitch Mob. the use of Fortune Days in this episode was so perfect. Hats off to those who select the music and to Ramin Djawadi. I loved the take on the original score when the Machine was rewinding the simulations / resuming to realtime.   Edit: I'd also like to take this time to mention that I love the names of the episodes. I always find that I like a series more so if the episodes are cleverly named."
PersonOfInterest,2uaawo,Darkness1000,6,Sat Jan 31 23:55:30 2015 UTC,"I loved God Mode a lot from the buildup of The Machine crashing, and hearing The Machine finally directly speaking, if only for objectives (unlike when she speaks through Root).

PersonOfInterest,2uaawo,man_in_the_suit,4,Sat Jan 31 23:41:22 2015 UTC,"My personal favorite would have to be one of the following three episodes (in order of air date): ""Firewall"": Root makes her first physical appearance and I really enjoyed the way the writers introduced her (a POI whose identity was carefully created to lure Finch and Reese in) ""Deus Ex Machina"": Vigilance is revealed to be a front for Decima (shocking even Vigilance's members), Decima comes out in full force, and Samaritan comes online. What really made this episode amazing was Root's monologue and the scenes of the team being forced to split up. That, the music, and the perspective of Samaritan through it all made the ending very haunting. ""If-Then-Else"": Seeing the way The Machine sees each of the team members was amazing (personally, I have a thing for the episodes focusing on the AIs so this was perfect). The humor (Fusco's kiss and The Machine's simplified simulation), although not necessary, made the episode more interesting and what topped the entire thing off was Finch's conversations with The Machine in 2003. In any other episode, his conversation would have been amazing, but the way that discussion linked into the events of the episode made it much more impactful."

Was about to post this thread ""Will Ingram: retconned out of existence or still in Sudan?"".  Honestly, I've wondered about him since Beta. In Samaritan's findings of closest connections to Finch, it really should have flagged Will first and not Grace (oh dammit, I can't type their names in that order w/o thinking of that show).   I mean, it flagged Nathan Ingram first which means we should have seen Will somewhere on that screen. Grace is physically/geographically closer to Finch and that would have been a good enough reason to go after her w/o completely ignoring Will's existence.   I'm thinking the creators/writers are quietly pretending he doesn't exist so they don't have to deal with complications to the plot. Which is too bad since I liked Will. He gave Harold hugs."

The guy just seemed out of touch with reality in a perfect im going to smile at you with my head cocked sideways and rape you to death kind of way.
PersonOfInterest,2u15xp,Mathieulombardi,3,Thu Jan 29 05:22:47 2015 UTC,I came here to say this.  I mean he kills and takes over that person's life for however long he feels like.  And the original person's nothing but teeth and bones.
PersonOfInterest,2u15xp,peepay,-1,Thu Jan 29 17:32:34 2015 UTC,/u/rpawson5771 said this earlier already
PersonOfInterest,2u15xp,VacuousWastrel,8,Thu Jan 29 18:09:56 2015 UTC,"Root. And to be honest, probably Finch next. I know Finch isn't exactly frightening in a 1-on-1 hand-to-hand-combat way, but he and Root are the only two I find really frightening. I guess because they're both high intelligent and both, in their own way, fanatics. Finch isn't a psychopath because what he's fanatical about involve valuing human life. But if you learnt that one person from PoI had decided you needed to die, which one would frighten you most? Other than Root, I'd say Finch. I've always had the impression that it may take a lot to get him to decide someone needs to die, but if he ever does, nothing's going to stop him. Eg the line in Beta: ""kill them all."" Or the interrogation with control: out of Reese, Root and Finch, which would you have been most frightened to have as an interrogator? Not in a 'fear of pain' sense but a 'fear of lacking control' sense?  Shaw, Reese, at times even Root, I've always had the impression you could appeal to their pragmatism, fear, boredom, compassion... you could find some way to change their mind. But Finch, when he's angry, projects a pure, ice-cold fury reinforced with unshakeable righteousness."
PersonOfInterest,2u15xp,VacuousWastrel,2,Thu Jan 29 19:04:53 2015 UTC,"Root is, or was, quite scary! But she's given us some reason to have faith in her.  I do not find Finch disturbing in the least, with perhaps the exception that he is so gifted as to be dangerous. He is very rigorous in his thinking, especially moral thinking and he's made decisions of choices no one would want to be presented with. If Finch was dogmatic, or in any way doctrinaire, he would be scary. If he was bitter, he would be scary. But he isn't any of those things. He's quite a virtuous character, and refreshing since it is almost never seen in our media - to make a genuinely good, not to mention deeply sophisticated, character ""cool."" Frankly I do not even get where you're coming from here. There is no ""unshakeable righteousness"" in him, he doubts everything. Not only is he not frightening, I rather think he is an outstanding role model, for what that's worth."
PersonOfInterest,2u15xp,phoebeburgh,3,Fri Jan 30 01:43:29 2015 UTC,"I agree that he's good, virtuous and a role model. That's why he's frightening!   You know the Pratchett line about good men:  ""Something Vimes had learned as a young guard drifted up from memory. If you have to look along the shaft of an arrow from the wrong end, if a man has you entirely at his mercy, then hope like hell that man is an evil man. Because the evil like power, power over people, and they want to see you in fear. They want you to know you're going to die. So they'll talk. They'll gloat.  They'll watch you squirm. They'll put off the moment of murder like another man will put off a good cigar.  So hope like hell your captor is an evil man. A good man will kill you with hardly a word.""    So do you really not find him intimidating when he says ""kill them all""? Or more recently his ""you say that like we weren't expecting them."" FWIW, some reactions to that last line from google include: ""I love when Harold gets menacing"", ""Best Ben Linus moment of the night"", ""Badass Finch is badass"", ""Finch is still the most terrifying of the protagonists on this show"", and ""goddammit Finch, you one scary motherfucker.""

Here's S4E12  I mean most of the episode is from Control's POV so I can understand not wanting to spoil things, but still, the preview did not do a good job of representing the episode.

But either way, it's foolish to assume that Control didn't tell Garrison about Decima's earlier attempt. Perhaps the Government really felt they needed a new surveillance system and Samaritan was their best only option? Especially after the ""Vigilance bombing"". And with the added benefit of plausible deniability it makes sense to look the other way in regards to the virus.  And yes, there are probably somebody above Greer. He's reporting about Rylatech to somebody over the phone at the end of Trojan Horse, and he was listed as Director of Operations of Decima by the Machine in an episode. Maybe there are other directors?"

PersonOfInterest,2u0bjs,kaztrator,2,Thu Jan 29 01:02:35 2015 UTC,"The impression I got is that the government knows that Decima is willing to do shady things for market advantage, but only shady things. Using a virus (that officially has nothing to do with them) to attack (in a way people don't understand) a machine (that doesn't officially exist)(and that wouldn't have anything to do with the government officially if it did) feels like the sort of shady stuff that everybody allows because nobody is going to bring any of it into the light. Doesn't mean that Decima would be willing to go to open war with the USA, though.  Imagine if the CIA found out that Microsoft, for instance, were behind a virus that was damaging CIA computers, in order to persuade the CIA to upgrade to a new version. Would they be pissed? Absolutely? Would they stop using Microsoft products? Probably not necessarily, especially if Apple and whoever else were doing similar things.  Or to take a real example: allied countries spy on one another. They bug each other's phones, they steal classified documents. But they still work with each other - so long as nobody leaks anything publically, everyone just pretends none of this is happening."

I'm pretty sure it's their longest running prime time series. They want that shiny 20 year anniversary.  The Scorpion, don't even get me started on that piece of crap. I thought maybe we could get a little character depth instead of ""I'M SAVING YOUR LIFE, BE CALM WHILE I DO THIS THING."" Where's the actual technical aspects of the show?

I just couldn't stomach it lol.  FWIW i didn't care for hackers either, Jolie aside.   IMO PoI has been the closest to accurate as far as tech goes, though they overuse the supergenius and prodigy archetypes a bit. It does annoy me how Finch does things so quickly/makes it seem like nothing, but most the technical terms and concepts are at least better than the vast majority."

On the other hand, I'm right there with you in appreciating how accurate PoI tends to be on technical matters. True, they do occasionally miss things or take artistic liberties, but it's still accurate enough that you can tell the writers cared and made an effort.   ...although this season some of the screenshots on some of the phones/computers were pretty cringe-worthy.

PersonOfInterest,2txwfs,HSChronic,2,Wed Jan 28 19:39:33 2015 UTC,"No my guess is they had an extra episode they couldn't fit in someplace since this season is only 18 episodes and ends in a few weeks because CSI: Cyber takes its place.   So since POI and everything else are on break until next week they threw it in there.

PersonOfInterest,2tuk0u,Tesseon,2,Tue Jan 27 15:41:14 2015 UTC,"I've always said PoI is a superhero show, and noticed the Batman roots.   They basically took the billionaire genius and the vigilant warrior sides of the caped crusader and split them into two people.  They are collectively filling the Batman role rather than one or the other being the perfect analogue."
PersonOfInterest,2tuk0u,monsterbate,2,Thu Jan 29 14:52:57 2015 UTC,"Eh... I think people can find connections between anything similar enough if they look hard enough. The simple fact of the matter is, there are a lot of shows out there where the character is the ""batman"" type (wants to save everyone), or where some issue in the past (loss of close friend, injury) has a big impact on the character, and of course there are a lot of ""genius"" high IQ guys or guys that are very skilled in martial arts/weapons. So these comparisons only go to prove that point.   If we were to claim Batman as a big inspiration, I look at some of the things about Batman that are very unique and there isn't a thing in POI that matches.   A few examples:  -Batman using a lot of gadgets. POI doesn't really do that, and they could've easily written that into the show between Fitch's hacking background and Reese's spy background -Batman mostly taking place at night -The Batmobile -The cartoonish villains (as opposed to some comics like Superman where one of the villains is Lex Luthor) -The general theme of overcoming fear/darkness"
PersonOfInterest,2tuk0u,VacuousWastrel,2,Tue Jan 27 18:56:04 2015 UTC,"Eccentric billionaire who has lost a loved one creates (multiple, in Finch's case) false identities in order to fight crime as a vigilante, relying on the fact he's also a tech genius.  No surprise people think of Batman."
PersonOfInterest,2tuk0u,eikeegimuu,1 point,Wed Jan 28 00:14:23 2015 UTC,"Agree.   It would be remarkable if there were no connections to anything that has been done before. And not just in the tv/movie/comics age. Considering people have always been telling stories (myths, fairytales, plays) it would be impossible to come up with something that doesn’t have any parallels to any previous story. All stories have all the same source after all.  Basically, if you go looking for parallels/similarities you are going to find them everywhere. That’s unavoidable. But I think drawing such parallels is (unless it's done tongue in cheek) selling the story that's being compared short, since the story it is being compared to isn’t the blueprint, but simply happens to have similar themes (that are universal anyway)."
PersonOfInterest,2tuk0u,galorin,1 point,Wed Jan 28 10:00:56 2015 UTC,"Re:Gadgets - I disagree with your argument. You are right in that the hacking skills serve the same purpose as Batman's gadgets in the plot... but that's exactly the point! The hacking and the guns and all of that are just plot devices. They could've easily chosen to pay more homage to batman by using more batman-esque gadgets but didn't.   Re: Cartoonish villains: Root, Elias, Greer are nothing like the Joker, 2-face, Bane, Riddler, etc. It's not even close.   And the biggest thing is the fact that you have to combine Reese/Fitch to get the full Batman. Batman was a genius/rich as well as good at martial arts and all of that. No one character on the show has all of that."
PersonOfInterest,2tuk0u,Trueogre,1 point,Wed Jan 28 06:32:04 2015 UTC,"You realize the show doesn't have to be a shot-for-shot plagiarism of something to be inspired by it.   It doesn't. But if we're saying this show was inspired by Batman, I could say that a lot of shows are inspired by Batman. The Arrow (the version on TV right now) has just as many similarities as POI does. And conversely, POI could be said to draw inspiration from many iconic shows if that is the metric we are using to make that claim."
PersonOfInterest,2tuk0u,kaztrator,1 point,Wed Jan 28 15:12:18 2015 UTC,"Okay, so when you say the show was inspired by Batman, you mean it in the way that every detective show in the last 80 years was inspired by Sherlock Holmes or Poirot and not that it had a big influence over him."

Hersh looks over to Fusco trying to get Bear to sit with a dutch vocab book and Bear jumps onto his desk. Hersh then says 'Don't worry, they haven't exactly got New York's finest working this one.'  Another one would be when Henry Peck worked out they built the machine and the camera zooms out to show Fusco who then suggests he needs a tinfoil hat.

John Reese: I know you won't carry a gun, but if I'm sending you back in the field, you're getting some basic self-defense.  Harold Finch: Oh, I really don't think...  John Reese: No, listen up. If Trask comes at you, put your fingers straight out like this and strike at his eyes.  Harold Finch: Poke him in the eyes? That's your technique?  John Reese: No that's YOUR technique.

For some reason two scenes that first come to mind as examples are from episodes I didn't particularly appreciate otherwise, but maybe that's why those scenes stood out more.  In a previous season: in the lady killer episode Harold and Reese going to the gala and the lady in charge of the attendee list being all impressed with Harold's +1. Specifically the lady acting conspiratorial and congratulating Harold, and Harold just reacting with some “aint it so” eyebrow action and Reese being focused on getting on with saving the number added some unexpected humor.  In this season: Root and Harold hanging out in a car and exchanging deep thoughts, then muffled sounds from the car trunk and Root addressing all exasperated a hitherto unseen and unheard Larry to remind him of the backseat privileges terms and conditions. Totally shifted the mood of the scene while having Root's and Harold's reactions so …. them."

PersonOfInterest,2tq3wl,Gouldde,15,Mon Jan 26 15:02:43 2015 UTC,The realism; 99% of the time the show can use technology or politics as a plot point while still being accurate to the real world.

PersonOfInterest,2tq3wl,MisterMorales,9,Mon Jan 26 15:40:55 2015 UTC,"I love Person of Interest for the universe and the constant world-building. The slow, gradual progression of storylines over multiple episodes and vivid recurring characters crossing paths with the team give a feeling of interconnectivity to the show. Storylines span multiple episodes or even seasons eventually culminating/climaxing in an epic hour of television with suspense, action and comedy. Different storylines often intertwine and intersect, and new storylines develop from older ones. In addition, the show is never afraid to offer different perspectives on the story. The episodes that best showcase what I love about Person of Interest are Relevance, RAM, /,  and Control-Alt-Delete.  Reese walks into an elevator, and suddenly there's Zoe! Finch plays chess with Elias and they talk about HR. Stuff like that and the attention to detail (for example in the Machine's POV) makes it seem like the world in Person of Interest is organic, living and breathing, and that in turn makes it so easy to immerse oneself in it."
PersonOfInterest,2tq3wl,LaunchpadMacQ,9,Mon Jan 26 16:45:30 2015 UTC,"There are a couple of reasons for me, though I'm not sure if all of them will be relevant to the topic of your game.  One, the characterization, which is on point for every single member of its cast. It's pretty much the thing that glues you to the screen in the first few episodes. They are all deep and layered, and even the weakest members of the cast are given a substantial amount of development.  Two, there's a certain realism to the plot and premise. It's still scifi, yeah, but there's a logic to it and you can see the origins of the ideas the show builds on. There's also a cautionary tale here about the future of technology, however out of reach it may be now.  Lastly, it's pretty tightly scripted. The creators had an idea of what they wanted to do and they've been compounding on it since the beginning. The threats to the characters feel real and have weight, even when they have the Machine to aid them. It's pretty important, to me at least, in order to reach your audience that you establish a baseline for your plots and then build the story towards challenging this baseline. Guns and secret organizations aren't much when you have a Machine; on the other hand, having another faction with another machine or factions that are cognizant of the Machine and know how to outmaneuver it are bold decisions."

PersonOfInterest,2tq3wl,man_in_the_suit,6,Fri Jan 30 17:38:19 2015 UTC,"The characters, the writing, the lack of cheap plots or romances, the variety of story from gritty gangs and corrupt police to super AIs, the fact it feels like it reinvents itself every so often, the flashbacks, the moral questions raised, and the production value which feels on par with films tbh. The machine/samaritan graphics are amazing."
PersonOfInterest,2tq3wl,SaintPeter74,4,Mon Jan 26 19:07:26 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't think it's the artificial intelligence aspect of the show that makes it gripping. It could be based around a different subject matter, like being able to see tomorrow's newspaper today... and if they do everything else the same it would be just as gripping. It's good writing, characters, suspense, etc.   But because you are asking about this from the perspective of making a game, I think I can offer some advice. One of the things Person of Interest does is it doesn't really explain many the specific capabilities of the machine. Some of the things are inferred based on what is going on in the plot, but there are a lot of specific things that just aren't explained. And it sounds like a negative thing but it isn't. Because the more you explain what the machine can or can't do, the more restrictions you are putting into writing the story for this game later on."
PersonOfInterest,2tq3wl,covington,3,Mon Jan 26 16:50:30 2015 UTC,"Two things:    The Characters - They are really well written and come across as more than just two dimensional cardboard cutouts.  The interaction of the personalities really drives a lot of the storytelling and the storytelling is good.  Even without all of the other elements, I would come back just to see Harold and Reese and Root and Fusco.  The Mythology/Sci-Fi - I'm a huge Sci-Fi fan and, frankly, there is not much good sci-fi on TV.  Not smart Sci-fi at least.  You can find a bunch of space-cops and lazerguns, but not much with deep thinking.  POI manages to deliver a very realistic, very plausible story with a deep mythology that I can really sink my teeth into.  I work in computers/programming, so I am very sensitive to shows ""getting it wrong"".  POI usually gets it right, which is almost shocking in and of itself.  As you can see on this subreddit, the writers really ""get it"" and frequently put easter egges (like Stuxnet code, etc) into the scenes."
PersonOfInterest,2tq3wl,hitlerlovejuice,3,Tue Jan 27 01:01:40 2015 UTC,"The casting and writing of the characters is great, and would have made the show stand out among the procedural thrillers by itself.   But what lifts the show above the crowd is the underlying subject matter of the existential threat as well as unlimited promise in artificial intelligence. It builds on the best of what came before in HAL, the Forbin Project, the androids in the Alien series, West World, and a century of written SF, but what breaks it free of even that is the shedding of the anthropomorphic shell AIs are usually wrapped in, to let us get a beginning sense of the real unfathomable difference there is between human consciousness and AGI, and the poignancy of the attempts to connect across that abyssal gulf.  Plus, it's a realistic superhero thriller. The teamwork, resources, and focus of the protagonists would amount to a Batman-like superhero even without the machine, and with it, we can watch Root move through the world as the augmented avatar of her semi-prescient and nearly omniscient  ghost in the machine enabled by technologies that already exist."

PersonOfInterest,2tq3wl,zodiac1989,3,Fri Jan 30 01:04:18 2015 UTC,"Simplest answer: The show is actually about something, which forces them to constantly be dynamic in their storytelling.  To expand upon that: Regardless of what the key serial arc (be it the small time (at the time) Elias angle in S1, the CIA's hunt for Reese, the development of the Machine with Finch & Ingram, or the rise of HR or Decima), there's always been strong plot progression, a sense that the story's going somewhere, and would be resolved most satisfyingly (Agent Snow's blaze of glory, Scarface garroting Simmons). Compliment that with characters who are very grey in morality (except HR, as they were flat-out bastards who only wanted money & power), real people with valid reasons for doing what they're doing (be it protecting the country, or protecting civil liberties, or a perfectly valid vision for an AI controlled society).  Add to the fact that the show makes us care about characters that aren't even human (The Machine, Bear, & even Samaritan), but have enough gusto to make them seem human. Not to sell the human characters short, for as they are, in the interpretation of the Machine, the key driving force in the show. The journeys they've been on (specifically Reese, Finch, Fusco, Root, Elias, Hersh (sob!), Control, Greer) make them all the more endearing. They're always dynamic, and there's an inbuilt sense that there's a lot more of that to come in the episodes ahead. I often prefer plot to character (don't usually go into a show because I'm a fan of one particular actor), but this show has done a beautiful job with both, that I can't imagine the show without either facet. Even in the early days where the mytharc was simple, the characters beats were so strong, that it kept me invested throughout."
PersonOfInterest,2tq3wl,Pascalwb,2,Tue Jan 27 13:57:42 2015 UTC,"I love that there's an overarching story.  Even in a more procedural episode, there's something memorable from the characters, characters I know have been places and are going somewhere, who will go through major developments, and who are vulnerable.  What's also gripping for me is the similarities to the Dark Knight trilogy: the writing and staging; the production value; the ""heightened reality"", exploring big ideas in a concrete setting."
PersonOfInterest,2tq3wl,DFreiberg,1 point,Mon Jan 26 20:21:47 2015 UTC,The flashbacks are the reason this show is beautiful. Gives good reason to each person's actions. Such excellent background stories for almost all the character. That's what makes it gripping to watch.

Off the top of my head there was that time with Carter, the time where he got sniped by the CIA, the one with Cara like you said and then just recently. Im sure I'm missing on or two but seven still seems a little high.   I do think its more or less believable. I mean he's supposed to be this sort of super agent and he's got this very determined mindset, which i think plays a pretty big role in how the human body heals.   There were some times i would think he would be seriously injured. One would be with Cara, shes also supposed to be like John, a sort of super hero. The fact that she shot him with the intention to kill and he managed not only to survive but also get away from an ariel strike is pretty crazy.   The other time is with the CIA, as far as i know sniper rifles are very powerful and have pretty massive bullets. Its believable that he'd survive a shot by one but the fact that he was fine after a little while is also pretty crazy."

PersonOfInterest,2tod3h,GhostOfCreeper_DIG,1 point,Mon Jan 26 07:58:14 2015 UTC,"The issue here was that Reese has survived MANY times of getting shot without any lasting effects. More than Rood I’d wager, though Rood has also been shot at least tree times .  But that is rather typical that shows don't deal with the aftermath (or possible resulting physical limitations). At least with Reese and Root I find it mostly believable (in a work of fiction kind of way) because I buy Reese as an um .. action hero, and Root is fanatical, so both of them would push on despite any discomfort. Even so, for me maybe the biggest suspension of disbelief was Reese’s warpath while at death’s door when avenging Carter."
PersonOfInterest,2tod3h,man_in_the_suit,4,Mon Jan 26 08:17:25 2015 UTC,"After the Cont-Alt-Delete episode, from the Machine's POV, my whole view of this show changed. Now I look back on other episodes and think, OK, so maybe the Machine ran a bunch of simulations and figured out that Reese or whoever would survive this situation? So now I watch the show with this idea that the Machine is kind of guiding what happens, and that makes the implausible stuff a bit more plausible....(hope this made sense!)"
PersonOfInterest,2tod3h,Viper_H,2,Mon Jan 26 09:52:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, the Machine was running simulations before and will probably continue, as evidenced in S3E3 I think, long before Samaritan came online"
PersonOfInterest,2tod3h,eikeegimuu,1 point,Mon Jan 26 14:18:16 2015 UTC,"What I meant was that the torture Root suffered would have had more devastating, longer lasting side effects to her body and particularly her heart. Control said most people (probably trained soldiers) can only survive a few rounds, yet later in the episode we see about 20 syringes on the tray. I find it less believable that a woman of Root's back ground and build could survive that as opposed to John surviving various gun shot wounds considering his background.  Either way I don't really find it hard to suspend my disbelief for stuff like that. I like them pushing the boundaries of reality ever so slightly."
PersonOfInterest,2tod3h,ab_emery,2,Fri Jan 30 01:17:04 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised how Root survived that stupid Matrix-ey fight in the hotel earlier this season, considering how many times she was shot there."
PersonOfInterest,2tod3h,GhostOfCreeper_DIG,1 point,Mon Jan 26 10:59:35 2015 UTC,"I don't remember the exact words they exchanged during the torture session but the impression I had was that the goal was to get information not to kill (though Control wasn’t bluffing all the way and for sure saw that as an acceptable side-effect). So it’s not as if Root survived a firing squad and 20 bullets to the heart. But I agree that realistically the drug cocktail probably should have had some lasting effects, though I can also believe that maybe a “detox” would help to deal with the effects.  I found it harder to explain how Reese was bleeding out and having internal damage and so on, but was still capable of the feats in that revenge episode. No matter how well trained or how good his physical baseline - that was too much mind over matter. Because that wasn’t about pushing through the pain or being in excellent shape (apart from the injuries :P) but more akin to going dancing with severed tendons and broken bones. So the suspension of disbelief factor was high with that one for me. But otherwise I haven’t had a problem with Reese surviving various gun shots without ill effects. Even though that’s maybe also not 100% realistic, it is believable in the show’s context, since he’d have to have above average physical capabilities with his career path anyway and he has been portrayed that way throughout."

There wasn't any actual conflict over the idea of creating a machine to run through possibilities: the British were building on top of successful predecessors.  The first ""Bomba)"" had already been created by Poland, but they were overwhelmed as the Germans made Enigma more complex.  Turing's contributions to the British Bombe were way deeper; I was slightly upset that they replaced Turing's real advances with what was essentially an ego conflict!  (Check out this article for the details on the whole story of Enigma-breaking.)  Unfortunately, I think this is a case of the film's creative team inventing something simpler, to avoid boring the audience to death with explanations.  Probably, modern Sci-fi influenced The Imitation Game's writers more than the real Alan Turing's work on Enigma influenced PoI."

Ghosts introduces the format and has important flashbacks.  Witness (1.7)   It's a great episode. Also, Elias.  Get Carter/Number Crunch/Super (1.9 - 1.11)    Carter joins the team/CIA stuff/machine origin stuff  Root Cause (1.13)   Root's first appearance  Blue Code (1.15)   HR takes the stage  Flesh and Blood/Matsya Nyaya/Many Happy Returns/No Good Deed/Firewall (1.19 - 1.23)   More Elias/CIA/Reese episode/Machine ep/Insane Finale    Edit: I'll throw out a list for season 2 once I get around to watching it.

So the banner's best real estate ends up being where Carter and Shaw are even though neither is anymore/currently on the show and I'm tempted to use even more zoom.

Insert copius amounts of Shaw, John, and Olivia kicking butt together, have a scene in which Finch is both highly impressed and totally horrified by Walter Bishop, give Root the temporary ability to mind-meld with the machine using Fringe Division's neural interface, have a short bonding moment between Bear and Gene, and you have yourself an episode.   Adding to that, I'd love to see some kind of conversation between the Machine, Samaritan, and the Observer.  I think he'd be the perfect intermediary between the two, seeing as he and his eleven colleagues have between them knowledge about the world to rival either AI's, and seeing as neither AI would have any definite information about him.  He can understand the desire to interfere for the good of humanity, and he'd agree about their need for information about humanity, but he can also understand how interference with even the best of intentions can cause disastrous outcomes.

(would also tie in with Dietz writing)  Blunt - Segel, Plageman, Toye, Episode Sixteen**... all = mindblowing?  Karma and SKIP - given the second-rank directors and third-rank writers, and the placement in the season, these are the before-the-storm episodes. Probably not as good, probably COTW-based (but at the same time setting up for the final big bang).*****   - previous credits: Witness (Elias!), Legacy (Reese investigates Finch), Flesh and Blood (Elias takes over), Til Death (the fun one where the husband and wife are trying to kill each other), Relevance (Shaw's episode), Zero Day (you know what this one is), Lady Killer (Root escapes from asylum), The Devil's Share (obvious), A House Divided (middle act of the end of S3), Wingman (ok... this one doesn't matter), The Cold War (pretty big deal). Yes, occasionally Segel does get drafted in to do ""fun"" episodes, and they're pretty good. But mostly she takes on the really big ones, particularly when there's a twist.   ** - other than being in charge of everything, he's done: Ghosts (set the format), Get Carter (extends the format), Firewall (breaks the format to pieces), Bad Code (Root torture and backstory), In Extremis (Fusco backstory, Machine succumbs to virus), Liberty (kicks off the third season), 4C (ok, divisive), Deus Ex Machina (wooahhhh!), Panoptican (kicks off fourth season)  *** - has directed: Witness, Many Happy Returns (not great, but not his fault, and it was big at the time - Reese backstory), Critical (I hated it, but it was well-directed and introduced what I think was meant to be a major villain), Booked Solid (serbian war crimes, lots of action), Nothing to Hide (introduces Vigilance), The Crossing, Beta, Wingman.  So I wouldn't say Toye was their #1 director, but he seems to be picked a lot for big action episodes.  **** - previous Episode 16s: Risk (not huge, but Elias returns. Plus Rooney, Assets), Relevance (Shaw), RAM (massive flashback episode). So their 16s tend to be experimental and significant, though not necessarily immediately vital to the plot.  If I had to go out on a limb, I'd guess 'Blunt' is the end of either Elias or Dominic... the sort of thing that's big, but not actually central to the main plot.   ***** - last year, #18 and #19 were light and non-vital (allegiance, most likely to). Year before that #17 and #18 (proteus, all in). Year before that #17 and #18 were Baby Blue (Reese and Finch looking after a baby) and Identity Crisis (two people with the same identity)."

He is the only character whose new identity has forced themselves to address aspects of their personality. I'm not 100% sure the shrink is a good guy yet, it could be a Samaritan plant, but I like how John is being forced to confront his 'issues' of which he undeniably has many.

PersonOfInterest,2taq61,Hugo_Flounder,13,Thu Jan 22 20:17:52 2015 UTC,"That is Samaritan's GUI at the end of the episode. Throughout the whole episode only the Machine had access...  This could mean three things I think:   Mistake made by final editors. Cleanup crew gave access to Samaritan before they left, which means Samaritan knows Control visited and either:   It raises a red flag and she dead. Samaritan doesn't raise a red flag - maybe it think she's investigating the stock crash.    As usual, Plot Thickens"
PersonOfInterest,2taq61,DFreiberg,18,Thu Jan 22 16:04:28 2015 UTC,I think its highly likely that Samaritan's access was restored especially considering that the video tapes of the shootout were wiped by Decima.

PersonOfInterest,2taq61,Galvanise,3,Thu Jan 22 22:01:17 2015 UTC,"Samaritan is powerful. But I don't think it's yet at the point where it's going to murder (or arrange to have executed) the head of national security (whatever her exact title is) just on a vague suspicion that she might be vaguely suspicious.   Sure, if it thinks she's become a concrete threat, it might take steps. But I think Samaritan will need to be very sure that she's actually 'a threat' rather than an 'annoying woman who keeps poking around who I have to keep an eye on'.   So I think Control is making herself look like she's not a direct threat, while still keeping her eyes open.  To some extent, if Control STOPPED being a suspicious bastard, THAT might worry Samaritan more than her investigations do! First rule of knowing that they're watching you: keep acting normally. For Control, that probably means 'poking around a little but not actually getting in the way too much'."
PersonOfInterest,2taq61,ab_emery,3,Fri Jan 23 02:11:42 2015 UTC,"I think Samaritan would start to care if it thought Control was undermining it, like when it found out that she had contacted Grice secretly and sent her the ""STOP IT. NOW."" message."

The whole of the internet might be shut down to kill the machines. There might be some kind of coup d'etat.

The Units numbers were nowhere near POI though, they were much lower in season 3 and 4."
