AskElectronics,3e6a3g,PetrasSukys,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:39:53 2015 UTC,"I would take a look at the Wiki entry for a Thermoelectric Generator. There it states:   High output resistance - in order to get a significant output voltage a very high Seebeck coefficient is needed (high V/°C). A common approach is to place many thermo-elements in series, causing the effective output resistance of a generator to be very high (>10Ω). Thus power is only efficiently transferred to loads with high resistance; power is otherwise lost across the output resistance. A generator with very high output impedance is effectively a temperature sensor, not a generator. This problem is solved in some commercial devices by putting more elements in parallel and fewer in series.  Adverse thermal characteristics - because low thermal conductivity is required for a good thermoelectric generator, this can severely dampen the heat dissipation of such a device (i.e. thermoelectric generators serve as poor heat sinks). They are only economical when a high temperature (>200 °C) can be used and when only small amounts of power (a few watts) are needed."

Also inverters are often crap - reviews are your friend!  Read lots of them and get an idea if a particular inverter really lives up to its claims.  Get a kill-a-watt meter or similar and measure the devices your friend uses so that you can get a better power estimate under actual use (of course turn the volume a little higher than usual to get a worst case figure).  Often the plate ratings on stuff are a worst case that isn't reached in practice.  $15 for a meter could save you more in other equipment (plus it's handy to have!).  You can measure both actual wattage and VA (which might be a better figure to go by for sizing inverters).  VA is basically a rating for the amperage in use multiplied naively with the line voltage.  It sounds a lot like watts at first glance.  But, with a non-resistive load, you can have more current drawn when the voltage is lower than average, so the amps used are higher than would be suggested by the real power wattage.  The real wattage is the momentary amperage multiplied with the momentary voltage, then calculated over the whole AC cycle.  For batteries, make sure to find deep cycle batteries - a normal car battery is not meant to be substantially discharged.  They become damaged quickly when not near full charge.  But yes, your logic so far is pretty good on selecting this stuff."

AskElectronics,3e3bp2,cpu68k,4,Tue Jul 21 17:11:18 2015 UTC,"The interrupts are level triggered, so they need to remain asserted until serviced.  A level 3 interrupt while servicing a level 5 interrupt is ignored, and the external priority logic needs to leave the interrupt asserted.  A level 6 interrupt while servicing a level 3 interrupt stacks -- the interrupt is taken immediately, and the RTE instruction resumes execution of the level 3 interrupt (the interrupt level mask was saved in the status register dump written during interrupt handling).  If you have three or fewer interrupt sources, a common technique is to wire the lowest priority one to IPL0, the second to IPL1 and the highest priority to IPL2, and set up the vectors as  handle_irq1 handle_irq2 handle_irq2 handle_irq3 handle_irq3 handle_irq3 handle_irq3 handle_irq3   This way, you don't need any external logic, but your IRQ handler needs to set the level mask in the beginning so the arrival of a new lower-priority interrupt doesn't restart the handler. If you have more sources, use a 74LS148 or similar logic to generate the interrupt lines."

There are situations where getting help from an applications engineer at the factory is not easy, let alone acquire design help quickly.

If the yellow/black wire is thinner than the others, then its likely a sense wire and would be connected to the solid yellow wires.  Take a volt meter and measure the two types of yellow wires to be safe.  You want the most wires in parallel to minimize wire resistance.    One way is to cut off all the connectors.  Pair up each +12V wire with a black ground wire.  Connect each wire to some solderless crimp spade or tougne connectors.  Take a piece of stock aluminum flat bar, commonly sold at home improvement or machine shops, drill some #8 or #10 holes, buy a few fasteners.  Connect +12V rail to one piece of metal, ground to the other.  Be sure to mount them apart from each other using non-conductive (i.e. nylon) fasteners.  Also make sure the conducting end of the other wires stay away; best to heat shrink the ends.

The only concern I have with them is that on the datasheet, under ""on characteristics"", it says that the maximum voltage that can be applied to the gate is 2.5V. How is that possible? A simple Arduino outputs 5V, so I can't imagine that the gate wouldn't be able to handle that."
AskElectronics,3e4z3e,NoobMadeInChina,2,Wed Jul 22 01:41:45 2015 UTC,"Search digikey for ""mosfet"".  You probably want a low-side drive, i.e. having the mosfet between the actuators and ground, which is a N-channel enhancement.  Most power mosfets are enhancement.  this way, your gate signal will be referenced to ground and no voltage conversion will be needed.  Some things to pay attention to, in order of importance:  1) Continuous current and drain-source voltage ratings.  I(D)max and V(DS)off.  Its also good to have at least 50% (if not 100%) headroom, considering your easy requirements.  2) Gate threshold voltage.  V(th).  Basically, when V(gs) > 2V(th), your mosfet is a switch in the ""on"" position and vice versa for V(gs) < V(th).  Low V(th) devices are called ""logic level"" mosfets, for their ease of directly interfacing with 5V signals.  3) Capacitance.  C(gs).  Shouldn't be an issue, but the larger the current/voltage handling capability of the mosfet, the larger the capacitance, and the slower/inefficient it is at switching.  If your pwm signal is below, say, 100kHz, this shouldnt be an issue.  4) Packaging/mounting.  It would be nice to bolt it down to the side of like a project box for sturdyness.  It would also be a nice heatsink.  Be careful, sometimes the tab is connected directly with the drain (and so it is electrically live).  Finally, and this is important, have a hefty diode placed in reverse bias in parallel with the drain/source of the mosfet.  this is so the back-EMF of your linear motor doesnt destroy the mosfet.  Use a regular silicon diode with adequate reverse voltage blocking capability and current rating."

AskElectronics,3e2mwz,downloaders,8,Tue Jul 21 14:10:02 2015 UTC,Its not as simple as a potenciometer. Depending on the current the fan draws and its power it might fry the potenciometer by overloading it. What you need is a sort of pwm control or similar to control the fan via transistors / Mosfets. You can buy fan speed regulators allready made online and usually for a fraction of what it would take you otherwise.  Unless you have a heavy duty potenciometer that can handle currents and power that the fan requires look for speed regulators.
AskElectronics,3e2mwz,Theoldknight1701,6,Tue Jul 21 14:23:12 2015 UTC,Chances are the fan has very low power requirements since it is USB. Probably less than 2 watts. A PWM solution is ideal but I think in this case a potentiometer can do the job.
AskElectronics,3e2mwz,aft3rmath,4,Tue Jul 21 14:34:08 2015 UTC,Ah yeah if its low power - 2W or below - it would work with still standard-ish 0.5W potenciometer. above that it might get iffy or expensive.  actually nwm you're right. not as expensive as i recalled. 4€ / 4W. probably cheaper still then module and can handle quite a massive fan.
AskElectronics,3e2mwz,Theoldknight1701,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:10 2015 UTC,Here are the numbers Can you explain how the math is done?
AskElectronics,3e2mwz,Theoldknight1701,2,Tue Jul 21 17:58:57 2015 UTC,Its fairly straightforward. The fan itself runs at 4.66Volts and 0.37 amps. Power P = voltage V times Amperage I = ~1.75W  When you add a potenciometer in the circuit you basically vary the current by varying the potenciometer value. if you linearize the fan so its simpler to calculate you can replace it with a imaginary resistor whose value is R = U divided by I -> 12.5 ohms ~ 13 ohms.  Maximum power on potenciometer when you add it to the circuit is at that exact resistance of the fan - when it matches there's the power dissipation maximum on the potenciometer. so you need to pick one thats above that value.  So now we calculate power dissipated. at 13 ohms potenciometer and 13 ohms load you basically have a voltage divider at 50:50 so voltage across potenciometer is half the input at 2.33V and voltage across the fan is also at 2.33V. Current can be calculated by adding up the resistance of both values (13+13 = 26 ohms) then dividing input voltage with that. 4.66 / 26 = ~0.18 Amps. Now you have both amps and voltages across the potenciometer so basically to get power you multiply them. 2.33V times 0.18 Amps = 0.4149 -> ~ 0.42 Watts.  Summing everything up the potenciometer requires to have atleast 0.5 watts dissipation power (rounded up to nearest full value) and it will run smoothly and wont catch on fire.  Now for resistance value. at 0 ohms fan runs full speed. At 13 ohms you halve the current and if interaction is linear halve the fan speed. above that it gets progressivly slower and slower. If you have any spare resistors figure out the stall amperage of motor by increasing resistance in series before the fan stops. then pick a pot at that range. otherwise something like 100 ohms or even less will do the trick.  so about 100 ohms at 0.5W (or better - maybe go 1W+ if you have a choice and prices are similar and still affordable)  edit: as for why all the power dissipations equasions are focused on the 50:50 range - when potenciometer is the same resistance as a fan - its a version of Jakobi's law or Maximum power transfer theorem. wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_power_transfer_theorem

If you go with NiMh rechargeable AA you'd be dealing with 1.2V nominal. Each one when charged might be about 1.4V and will drop to 1V like normal - so in this case it's even worse for your project.

AskElectronics,3dzhbj,juicenx,2,Tue Jul 21 06:03:19 2015 UTC,"Creepage is the distance between two points (conductors) over a surface. The surface can be anything: two traces, a barrier between terminals on a terminal block, etc..  Clearance is the distance between two points through air.  Creepage and clearance distances are based on the voltage difference between the two points - the higher the voltage, the larger the distance. Creepage distance is longer than clearance because crap can accumulate on a surface and conduct current. Distances specified by standards such as UL and TUV may differ as well as what the product is being designed for - medical applications more stringent than say, automotive. It's been a long time for me so I'm not up to date on specific requirements. Google ""creepage and clearance distance"" and you'll find lots of images that explain it better than I did."

AskElectronics,3e0u32,Wandertramp,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:17:20 2015 UTC,"Ah calculations are fairly straitforward - you need to determine how much current the entire setup draws and multiply it by the ammount of hours it will run. If a devide draws 1A of current and needs to draw it for 8 hours it requires 8Ah (8000mAh) battery. So a 12V device pulling 1A running 1Hour needs a 12V battery rated @ 1Ah and such Or a bit more. usually you allways overengineer rather than match directly as its not allways linear.  Wattage is fairly simple. you need the voltage the device uses and amperage it pulls. So a 12V radio pulling 1A pulls the total power of P=UI = 12V1A = 12W.   Another calculation - its not really wattage anymore - is power consumption. basically multiply power with time and you get WattHours. Or multiply mAh / Ah with voltage for watt hours. They basically combine voltage and current trough time. so if you have a 200W panel running at 200W for 1h you get 200Wh. and if a device drains 50W from it for 1h it drains 50Wh. so a total system stores 150Wh while panel is operating  in that hour. basically its like maH/Ah but with power stored /used and not current.  Now i dont have much experience with panels other then classes but it might help so if anyone replys with a better answer to em listen to them but nevertheless: For a solar panel however it gets trickier. even if you assume full coverage of the entire days worth (tracking) and the same sun output regardless of position (impossible) you get 12 hours out of 24 hours worth of power output. Remove the tracking and you get just half of that or less. at ~200W per m2 you basically divide it by 4 or more to get roughly the output you would get from a normal day. And thats assuming the sun is a ""summer full heat"" sun.  Basically figure out how much power the device draws. then overengineer the panels Waaaay above that (4x for just breaking even during the day and no power during night, 8x to charge it enough during the day and it to run trough the night)  Unless you use really efficient setups like LED lighting for lighting and such the panel arrays get really big really fast.  reedit because confusing: if you want to keep all calculations in Amperes / Ah and such even for panels its fairly simple: You estimate panel will work for half a day and at that half at half the efficiency due to various sun positions for 1/4 of the original power. 200W -> 50W. thats the power generation of the entire 24h days worth. or in your case find out the average power generation in that 5-6 hours. if noon+-3h it should be near top efficiency of the panel. take that power and figure out amperage with voltage listed. a 12v panel with 50W estimated becomes ~4A ( I = P divided by U) and multiply by the hours - we allready estimated power per entire day so with 24h. in you case you can multiply by those 5-6 once you have avg power and avg current. so power generation per day is 4A*24h -> 96Ah of power generated. the device needs to be drawing half or less per day for it to work out with battery atleast half as big or more. Or just work it up the other way round and estimate size of panel with device Ah and voltage required."

AskElectronics,3dzgir,lord_dong,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:53:01 2015 UTC,"So the output of a bass guitar is a signal that interacts with a transducer, the speaker, and carries symmetrical negative and positive voltages. With an ideal waveform, the frequency could be easily deduced by counting the points at which the signal crosses zero then dividing by half. However, the signal is far from ideal. Due to the nature of guitar pickups and architecture the pickups don't transmit a sine-wave, but rather a compound wave full of harmonics (both from the plucked string as well as parasitic vibrations from the open strings). I would need a way to determine which frequency band is loudest within the signal, cutting out it's subharmonics, which brings us into fourier analysis. Fourier analysis is easy enough to do when sampling to a high-end computer, however I have no idea how to recreate it using embeddable MCUs or analog components. The solution must be out there, because I own two digital tuners for my guitar: I play a note and it tells me exactly what note I'm playing, and if I'm out of tune it even accounts for how much I'm off by. I need to create a device of that same fidelity, except its output would be a variable voltage."

AskElectronics,3dzgir,kegelwerfer,4,Tue Jul 21 07:52:32 2015 UTC,"What precisely do you want to achieve?  tl;dr: detecting frequencies is easy, measuring frequencies is tricky.  If you want to know the loudest frequency band (i.e. a ""chord detector""), that can be achieved with Goertzel filters, one for each note/frequency (band) you are interested in. A Goertzel filter is basically an un-optimized FFT, but calculates only the frequency bins you are interested in. Can easily be performed in even the smallest microcontrollers. See wikipedia et al. for more info. Nice bonus: Can be calculated during sampling, i.e. the result is ready immediately after pushing in the last sample.  If you want to measure the precise frequency that is loudest (i.e. a tuner), that is a bit more difficult.  Huge problem: What if you press the lower E string in the fifth fret, maybe by playing A as a barre chord? The E string would then vibrate with almost the same frequency as the untouched A string (110Hz). You need to classify whether a detected 110Hz note comes from the A string, untouched, or from the E string, pressed in the fifth fret. This is not always unambiguously resolved.  FFT: frequency resolution (per frequency bin returned) is sampling frequency/bins. So an 8192-point FFT with 8kHz sample rate has a frequency resolution of ~1Hz, meaning two tones >1 Hz apart can be discerned. If you have a signal with 110.3 Hz fundamental frequency (the A string, for example), then the 110Hz bin might have the value ""40"", and the 111Hz bin have the value ""20"". Interpolation tells you that the precise frequency is (11040 + 11120)/(40+20) = 110.3 Hz. However, if you hit the E chord in the fifth fret (say 110.1Hz) and the A chord (say 110.3Hz) simultaneously, you can no longer interpolate because the two frequencies are too close together (< 1Hz).  Filters: You can try sharp bandpass filters centered around each expected frequency and then do zero-crossing counting.  Latency? Frequency resolution is bought with latency. If you want 1Hz resolution for your FFT, you need to sample 1 second worth of signals. If you want 100ms response time, your FFT bins will be 10Hz wide. Same/similar reasoning applies for the Goertzel filter or for analog filters.  Finally, if your microcontroller is too slow, get a faster one. Doesn't get much cheaper than 500MHz for €12 (XMOS Startkit)."

High-z sources need a preamplifier or a follower first to make it load current invariant. if running directly and the circuit tries to pull more current then source can push the voltag will drop significantly. Something like a Opamp voltage follower might do the trick or similar. once you do that and have a low resistance output that is capable of handling higher currents (opamp output, etc) then you can connect that signal forward into various configurations.   For your example once you have make the sensor invariant of current you can amplify it with an opamp to 5/-5 voltage range, run it trough a diode rectifier and on a ADC pin. that gives you 0-5V. Negative logic can be solved via software - you cant step off of a tile twice without stepping on inbetween and you cant step on a tile twice without stepping off inbetween. So you just add a flag (bool or int) that inverts itself each time it detects voltage on ADC thats strong enough to count as stepping on / off and make sure you only fire the function once per stepped on/off event. aka:  if(ADCvoltage > treshold)  {    if(steppedon == false)     {      steppedon = true;     }    else     {      steppedon = false     } }   doing it this way can also mean removing ADC entirely and just reading logic pin value. but it means removing the treshold so sensor calibration might be iffy (might detect various weight ranges not just human weight) and noise might be troublesome.  solving fireing more then once per iteration can be really simple but stupid like a delay in function Or a bit more complex but better like 2 tresholds - so it can only fire again once it passes below the min treshold and again trough max treshold and such"

AskElectronics,3e00uy,talking_to_strangers,3,Mon Jul 20 22:23:05 2015 UTC,You can to an extent. if the voltage drop is within tolerable voltage level of the module then it will work - However voltage drop isnt constant with current. Vf If chart tells you how much under how much current. Another thing to look at is how much current the device draws. The diode seems to be rated at 1A max @ 75C so quite high and hot allready. Module seems to use insignificant ammounts of current so that might not be a concern but still for future reference.  if im looking correctly under ~40mA the module uses the drop is about 0.85V for a voltage of 4.15 and the diode is still cold-ish (34C?) at 34mW power dissipated  Alot of the cheapo adapters (like 12V car battery to 5V USB) allready use these sollutions - chains of diodes - But its a shitty sollution. If you have an alternative use that - they sell linear voltage regulators that are better and safer to implement. or zenner diodes that clamp the voltage. with increasing current and power it gets really iffy really fast.  edit: just figured it might not be supply power related. for data lines it depends on how fast you want to send information. something like a high speed diode will probably work from pi @ 5v -> module at 3.4-4.4V. To send it upwards from gsm to pi you need to make sure that the voltage is identified as logical 1 tho. it might still be in forbidden state and not be recognised as logical 1 so something like CMOS to TTL converter might be used there.  Edit no2: Actually never mind. there might be an issue where current draw is really really small and diode wont drop voltage enough. like data lines where input resistance is huge. Basically take this with a grain of salt.
AskElectronics,3e00uy,Theoldknight1701,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:39:38 2015 UTC,Thanks for the answer.  Using a linear voltage regulator seems a lot more elegant but I can only find adjustable regulators for the 3.4 - 4.4 voltage range. Are they an acceptable solution for a permanent system or are they only for prototyping ?
AskElectronics,3e00uy,Theoldknight1701,2,Mon Jul 20 22:59:07 2015 UTC,Linear adjustable regulators can basically become fixed regulators if you calculate the 2 resistor ranges on what they need to be (think most carry voltage equasion in datasheet).   As for prototype versus permanent - it depends i guess. They have a ton of drawbacks compared to switching but they're usually cheap and small / simple to implement. saw them in some aplications before but when you start finalizing you start cutting costs everywhere so you can cut costs here too. or redesign to switching for more power efficiency. or zenner diode. or whatever else that fits needs and is cheaper.  edit: for finding different regulators i usually just use a shop of some sort and search there. Farnell usually lists a crapton of em: http://uk.farnell.com/ldo-voltage-regulators-fixed     just filter it for output voltage nom.

AskElectronics,3e00uy,quitte,2,Tue Jul 21 08:46:11 2015 UTC,"Yes you can but should you? Probably not. Diodes change their forward voltage depending on the current that passes thru them so your voltage will change depending the current you push thru the diode. I assume you want to use them in series just to drop some voltage as forward voltage - not recommended. If you wanna use diodes to regulate voltage you'd use them as references (and probably use a zener with a preferable value) and then some transistors to handle all the current. I'd advise you to use a proper voltage regulator to do it and be confident that you're not going to fry anything. For this application you might wan't to use a linear one instead of a switch mode regulator to avoid unwanted noise as you're working with antennas, you'd sacrifice some efficiency for a ""cleaner"" voltage rail. Take a look at  LM3940 from TI that is designed to drop from 5V to 3.3V. Since you mentioned that module is designed to work from 3.4V, if it didn't work with 3.3V you could offset LM3940s output by 200mV using a schottky diode or check for something like this regulator with a bit different output."

AskElectronics,3dzwio,kevincrave,2,Mon Jul 20 21:51:11 2015 UTC,"First you need to find out at what voltage the frame works at. if its powered via wall adapter then you can read it from there. Read voltage And amperage from it. if its powered directly from mains to inside circuitry it might get really iffy and you would need to dismantle it and whatnots so its alot harder.  once you have the voltage you need to to build a simple regulator circuit that regulates to that voltage. Usually datasheets of regulators show you circuitry allready made, you just need to find the correct regulator. with the voltage just google ""X volt voltage regulator"".  Alternatively just buy an entire module allready made for that voltage from Ebay / whatever else. Make sure they can supply enough current as read from the adapter you currently use. Then just hook up batteries to some voltage above what you need to regulator, and regulator output to frame. Basically if you need 5v 1000mA supply  you buy 5v regulator rated above 1000mA (like 1200 or 1500), then link batteries together above 5V - something like 6V or 7.5V -> link that to regulator input, and regulator output to frame input.  to run it for 3-4h then you need to have batteries with 3-4times (preferably more) mAh rating of the adapter. so if adapter uses 1000mA (1A) then you need atleast 3000-4000mAh batteries. its abit different but simplest i can explain without you measuring current draw of device under operation and such. Depending on how powerfull it can be easily portable or require wearer to start wearing battery backpack :P it really depends and you didnt describe much in the post.  edit: and if you're wondering about why regulator and not battery directly - matching battery voltages and frame voltage required can be impossible (example - 5V is not a 1.5V multiple - 1.5 makes 1.5, 3, 4.5, 6, 7.5, etc) and on top of that batteries change voltage over time with use. charged might be 1.8, then under some operation 1.5, then after its almoust fully discharged 1v. Regulator regulates that to constant voltage over time. to some extent that is."

If I supply exactly 1.8 without any resistors, does it draw 20mA ?   No, because the forward voltage varies from one production batch to another, and with temperature. That's why LED datasheets usually say something like 'min 1.6V, typ 1.8V, max 2.0V'.   Another scenario is; If I supply 1.9 volts again without any resistor attached, how much current would I get on the circuit ?   Might be 15 mA, or it might be 35 mA. LEDs have a very steep voltage vs. current curve.  'Put 1.8V into it and it'll flow 20 mA' is really not what you're supposed to take away from that spec. What it actually means is 'if your circuit puts 20 mA through this LED, the voltage will drop be roughly 1.8V'. If you use a resistor, you only need a rough value for the voltage drop, because the resistor makes the voltage vs. current curve a lot less steep.

The parasitics in the wire you're using also introduces some impedance that your simulation doesn't take into account. All these parasitics are highlighted at higher frequencies.

The ""DUFF"" was the sound of a small electric arc inside your outlet. After you inserted the paperclip in the outlet, it allowed the flow of large amounts of current, causing the circuit breaker to trip, or a fuse to blow, depending on your electrical system. The lights were connected to the same breaker, so they were disconnected as well.   Circuits don't need resistors to function. However, when you are using mains voltages, you are probably connecting power to either a motor of some kind, a light, a heater or a transformer/power supply. The lightbulb and the heating element in an oven are both just fancy resistors. With a multimeter, you can even measure the resistance and calculate the power draw using ohms law (voltage = current * resistance) and (power/watts = voltage * current). As for motors and power supplies, they are also basically resistors, but they are made to also generate magnetic fields. We call them inductors, or coils. A motor makes a rotating magnetic field. The power supply uses induction to transfer power from one inductor to another, using different size inductors you can change the voltage. 230V or 110V are not really useful for small electronic appliances, so using a power supply we can power smaller devices.   What resistors are most commonly used for in circuits is current limiting, voltage dividers and voltage measurement(shunt resistor).

AskElectronics,3dzq7p,created4this,2,Tue Jul 21 13:51:57 2015 UTC,"Your outlet, like 99% of all electric power sources, is a voltage source. That means the source does its best to always maintain the same voltage across its terminals. The resistance of a circuit dictates how much current flows when a certain voltage is applied. Your paper clip did not have ""no resistance"" (the magic unicorn of electronics), but just very little of it. High resistance means little current, low resistance means huge current. Electrical power is the product of voltage and current. As long as there is just a voltage but no current (resistance = infinite), no power is being supplied. Once you have current flow (resistance = not infinite), your source supplies power and the load (here: the paperclip) dissipates it. Combine the above, and you have fixed voltage * huge currents = high power dissipated in your paperclip. The consequence is that the paperclip glows, you burn your fingers, losses in the electrical wiring cause the wires to catch fire and the house burns to the ground. In order to avoid that sad, sad scenario, somebody installed a fuse between the voltage source (the power plant) and you, to disconnect your paperclip if it pulls too much power.   Every hair dryer, light bulb or electric heater works by the exact same principle as you and your paperclip, except that the ""paperclip"" is a wire that is much thinner (= more resistance) and much longer (= more resistance).  If your voltage source and wiring is up to it, you can use any low enough resistance and the circuit will work just fine! An excellent example of that is photonicinduction on youtube. Here, he demonstrates that a screw driver (much bigger/lower resistance that a puny paper clip) can also be used as a circuit.   why is it that the circuit needs resistance/resistors to function properly?   To stop the voltage source, or the circuit, or the wiring, or all of the above, from blowing up. Your paperclips internal resistance is just too low to be useful, but the ""circuit"" you created ""works"" as expected.  OH AND DON'T SHOVE UNINSULATED WIRES INTO AN OUTLET. EVER.

Be aware that what you did was very dangerous - not only could things overheat and throw molten metal around as the paperclip sparked and part-vaporised, but if you managed to touch the bare paperclip wire, some of the available current could quite fancy a trip through you - and that can be fatal.  To answer your specific questions - not all circuits 'need' resistance - that's too broad a statement - but when a circuit is placed in an overload condition (as you did), the lack of overall resistance can cause high-current, fault conditions that may result in a fire, or worse, unless a safety device does its job."

AskElectronics,3dxx45,jason_sos,2,Mon Jul 20 14:31:57 2015 UTC,"Chances are the 5V one will be ok.  There is likely a voltage regulator in there, and the only reason they use 4.5 volts is that it's the closest you can get with standard batteries.  Plus, when AA batteries are fresh, they are higher - typically 1.6 to 1.7 volts, which would be very close to 5 volts.  I agree with /u/spap-oop, I would get rid of the batteries all together.  No reason to waste the money on batteries when it's plugged in all the time.  If you have a soldering iron, I would cut the end off that wall wart you found, determine which lead is positive, and solder the leads from the wall wart directly to the board where the battery leads are."

AskElectronics,3dxx45,doodle77,2,Mon Jul 20 22:43:18 2015 UTC,"U6 is the reference designator of a component on the board. It is in the center of the last picture. You can see that each of the wires (red and black) from the battery pack goes through a 0 ohm resistor (a jumper) to one of its terminals, and the third terminal goes to several places on the board, and the red (positive) wire from the battery doesn't go anywhere else."

Used server power supplies like this type can be had for about $20 on ebay.  But the thing is, that's not going to run your LEDs unless you also buy suitable constant current drivers designed for 12V input. Those will cost real money if you need 34 of them, and it's the only way to run these high power LEDs.  The next problem are going to be the LEDs. The ones you can buy cheaply are often faulty ones where like 70% of the diodes on the chip are bad, and the rest run at way too much current, so will fail quickly."
AskElectronics,3dw31u,blackcrackedpepper,7,Mon Jul 20 00:40:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, the higher voltage battery will last longer. Why the DC-DC converter though? A lot of amps have a pretty wide input range, and not running a converter would yield an extra 10-20% battery life."
AskElectronics,3dw31u,bal00,2,Mon Jul 20 00:51:24 2015 UTC,Someone told me to use a 11.1v battery with a boost converter and I wanted longer life but wasn't sure about running my amp at a higher voltage.
AskElectronics,3dw31u,scubascratch,16,Mon Jul 20 01:11:13 2015 UTC,"Both of those options are worse than just using a 12v battery with no converter at all.  A) buck and boost converters are going to add noise to the system. They will whine at some super high frequency maybe you can't hear it but get ready for some crummy intermod distortion or other crunge.  B) 11.1 volt guy? Don't listen to him anymore. Next time he goes on about something technical, just pretend like you're paying attention but probably just go with the opposite of his advice in the future or bring along an actual EE to school him. Might be fun.  (ELI5 explanation: amp wants to make 500 watts of noise cause it's time to Drop the Bass.... BOOM BOOM BOOM... Amp don't care 11.1v, 12v, 13.8v... Amp just wanna make 500 watts. Well watts = Volts * Amps. That means amps = watts / volts. So at 12v the amp will demand 500/12 or about 42 amps (dang bro hope you opted for the AWG 8 or bigger wire). But at 11.1v, now that 500 watts will demand 500/11.1 = 45 amps. Ok who cares about 3 more amps? Well wire has resistive losses. Those losses are calculated as I2 * R. AWG 8 copper has about 0.002 ohms/meter. Let's say you amp is in your fur-lined trunk and in order to not cramp your style by crossing your dank underbody led glow halo, the amp power cable takes a windy 6 meter path. And there's two power wires pos and neg so the full circuit length is 12 meters. 120.002 = 0.024ohms. Not a whole lot it would seem. But lets calculate that wire IR power loss: using the 12v battery I = 42. So 42420.024 = 42 watts of power loss in the power cable alone. Wow AWG starting to sound better... With the 11.1v setup: 4545*0.024 = 49 watts. Seems like only 7 watts more, but it's 7% everywhere. And all of that 7% is wasted as heat in the cable, the amp,.... So the amp is just told ""you get less voltage. Make the Boom Boom. Too bad it's way the F hotter in your chips. Deal with it pussy"" and the amp, pressed into harsher working conditions has just had its life shortened somewhat. Also it's definitely hotter and makes the car hotter in the summer. Bigger wire will help here and shorter wire run but the hot amp happens because of the low voltage regardless of cable size. Ok maybe that's more like ELI15)  C) every automotive amplifier ever made on earth has internal voltage regulation internally. You make this system work harder by giving it less."
AskElectronics,3dw31u,flash_me_yr_drives,3,Mon Jul 20 01:48:24 2015 UTC,"Yes, very this! My mobile audio system doesn't care too much about voltage - Sure brand boards can handle quite a broad range of input - but it does care about noise. Well, more to the point I care about the noise. Depending upon battery or power adaptor I noticed a huge swing in line level noise, so the less that stands between your battery and the amp the better!  Unfortunately for OP there doesn't appear to be much of any information on his link as to what the guts of the cheap amp are, but my guess would be something not in any way fragile to voltage. So do as /u/scubascratch says and just jack it into a 3S battery and be done with it.  Also get a screamer with a voltage readout so you don't destroy the battery. Seriously, they're like five bucks and will save you hundreds of dollars and prevent fires and explosions."

AskElectronics,3dw31u,bal00,2,Mon Jul 20 16:16:35 2015 UTC,"No, that's nonsense. Boost converters are only like 80-90% efficient, which means your battery life would be 10-20% worse. It would only make sense to use one if your amp couldn't cope with a lower supply voltage, but car amplifiers don't have that problem, because the voltage in a car varies quite a lot anyway.  A boost converter will increase the voltage, but that voltage boost isn't free power. It comes at the cost of a higher input current, so you don't gain anything, other than perhaps a bit higher maximum volume. Battery life will be worse though with any kind of DC-DC converter.  Your best bet would be to use neither a buck nor a boost converter to minimize conversion losses. A 4-cell battery (14.8V nominal) isn't ideal because it'll be at 16.8V fully charged, which might be a bit high for the amp.  I would use a 3-cell battery (11.1V nominal, 12.6V fully charged) with the converter.  Keep in mind that lithium batteries need a suitable balance charger, and you're also going to need a battery monitoring system so you don't over-discharge the battery. If the battery is allowed to drop below 9V or so, the cells would suffer damage."

Or was it.... BAD OP READ COMPILER WARNINGS AND ERRORS BAD OP BAD! (Just kidding)   Point 3 must be addressed before commit and please do optimizations 9 and 10 at least before commit as well   Kthx  two three four five seven things come to mind in order of likelihood  1) I see no io_output() function which does the opposite of io_input(). I'm guessing you forgot it and they may be outputs at start (where's setup?) but get made inputs and then never later get set to outputs so writes fail  2) I see no setup(), assuming it exists, are you setting the port direction to output for the Port A bits used for A0,A1,A2? Is some other code trying to use the ADC maybe? Have you verified you have affirmative control on these pins? Check again to make sure they are mapped as you believe: A0=CE or whatever. You omitted the actual values for port/pin assignments so we don't know. Some ports require extra code to put them in general IO pin mode. If you are using the analog inputs for anything you may need an explicit DDRA=0x07; or something. For all I know you declared it negative. Please share the code with the actual pin assignments. I don't need to see your top secret encrypted time traveling code so you can leave that out ;-).  2.1) Your code implies you understand that OE,CE,WE are all active low, which can be written /OE /CE /WE or !OE, !CE, !WE or even OE, _CE, _WE I have seen all three in use. Have you confirmed with volt meter these pins are behaving? I would personally temporarily change loop() to only toggle these pins back and forth, at like one toggle a second. I would use the existing turn_on/turn_off functions. I would make the code first toggle CE and confirm it was toggling with my meter. Then I change code to toggle OE and verify it with meter. Then code WE and verify it with meter. Verify them one at a time not three at a time. One at a time. One. At. A. Time.         One.               At.           A.             Time.                         _&amp;amp;lt;OMG I REVERSED THE OE AND WE LOL> (just kidding but maybe it's this easy better check again to be sure)  3) how do you know when a write is finished? Does the chip tell you on another pin? Where is the code polling the write complete bit? Are you gonna make me go find it on the data sheet? :-) Maybe you are reading back way too soon. All eeproms writing code MUST programmatically wait until the chip signals completion. No design of waiting a fixed interval is acceptable. (I don't allow Faith Based Coding(tm) on my team)  3.5) just checked datasheet are you aware writes are locked out for 5msec after EEPROM power up? Maybe you want to wait a second before writing  4) assuming the first two was not the issue or is now fixed, are your timings slow enough to make sure the chip data is ready? You wait 15 uSec which is probably ok but I don't know maybe you over clocked the chip. I would make these delays bigger until they work, or at least big enough to personally measure the outputs with another tool like a scope or meter. If I didn't have an oscilloscope or logic analyzer, I'd make these delays gigantic, like 1 minute(*this gets tricky, need like 60 calls to delay(1000) etc), so I could use my volt meter to run down every io pin for address data and control, during read and write cycles, to confirm functionality.   4.1) I might even go nuts and have a helper video record me doing that check each pin thing, so I could review it a few times before time runs out.  4.1.a) damn helper is watching game of thrones ok God gave you two hands one for the phone one for the volt meter red probe.  4.1.b) damn phone battery is dead. Look for paper and pen. Make room on desk for paper.  4.2) no video log? Ok use absurd 5 minute delay, then use volt meter and pen and paper or computer text edit to check and write down EVERY EEPROM PIN during write and read cycles.  4.2.a) if you have an unused IO pin, you can set it to output and just use it to tell you when the code goes someplace, like from write to read mode (add temp code to change this bit, and you watch this pin with meter. When meter shows this pin changes voltage, you know to go move the probe and measure. I would recommend turning your spare pin ON at the just before write mode, and turn it OFF just before read mode. That way you get two state changes to tell you ""OK, go!"" And you measure the pins. It tells you this at start of read (signal pin goes high), and tells you again at start of write (signal pin goes low). Maybe you can just use a stop watch and not resort to voltmeter debugging which is about the slowest thing imaginable.  4.3) do not continue until you have evidence of voltage values for all pins on the memory chip, in both the write cycle, and the read cycle. (video or written log of all EEPROM pins with absurd 10 minute write time delay)  No further debugging help until this is done :-) (so much time wasted in ""I'm sure"" ""check again"" ""I'm sure"" ""check again"" ""I was wrong"" ""toadaso"" .... Sorry if not you) With the evidence in these logs, if the problem still exists, this log will point out the exact problem  4.4) you skipped the log right? Go back to step 4.1  4.5) I wasn't kidding. Post the log of values here or you already solved it and at least upvoted so we know you aren't dead under a bus somewhere. If any of this helped call your mom and be nice for once. :-)  5) you have functions called shift_a_byte() but it appears to be taking a 16 bit input parameter. Is the function just poorly named and it actually shifts a word? (16 bits) does it work right? How sure are you? Show the evidence from 4.x.  6) I can't assume your shift code works without seeing it. (See step 4)  7) are you sure you powering the EEPROM? Just checking. How big is the bypass capacitor you have within 1 inch of it?  Ok the rest of these are just potential optimizations no probably not issues with it working or not  8) unless you are sharing these address and data pins with other chips not mentioned, then stop banging /CE around. Just set it low at startup and leave it there. Better yet just tie it to ground (ok there's startup corruption risk here so maybe not, also maybe /CE is needed for making writes commit so do carry on banging it around please)  9) put_addresses(): what is that crazy thing with aanstaanden and the bit traversal? That's the slowest version I have ever seen of:  aanstaanden = (int) address;  I looked at it for 3 minutes because you implied it is necessary. It looks to me like you check each bit from LSB up. If it's a 1 you set a 1 on the global via an OR. If it's a 0 bit you make it a 0 on the global via AND with inverted mask. This exactly copies the 16 bits of the address variable to the output variable. I thought maybe you were reversing the order of the bits but then I said to myself ""it's a memory chip, he can use any order he wants as long as consistent"" and I look at loop and see there is no bit reordering going on anyway. The only reason I can guess you doing this is the compiler complained about assigning an unsigned value (address) to a signed variable (aanstaanden) and it said that would not work. Since they're both integer i'd expect the compiler to (W)hine instead of Error. In any case the sign/unsigned mismatch is easily fixed with the (int) cast I wrote above; I am pretty sure if your compiler optimized at all that loop should reduce to a single straight assignment. I guess you have that weird variable because you think you need a global for the shift register operation, but I don't see the shift code here so I can't see why you chose a global there. The register functions should be stateless in your case (pretty sure you have no asynchronicity here so presumed blocking) shift functions should be only parameterized with what data to send, and not clocking out some global which could get corrupted by some interrupt I can't see  But I doubt this is your problem but please tell me what you think it does.  10) turn_addresses_off() this appears to be functionally equivalent to: put_addresses(0); so don't make a new function for this just call put_addresses(0) instead; why do you need this at all? Nobody cares what the address lines are at except the memory chip and he only cares about what actual assess to fetch or write. Setting these to all off only makes sense if reading or writing to address zero, which would be done via put_addresses(0) anyway.  11) put_addresses(address) is functionally equivalent to shift_a_byte(address) so why not just call shift_a_byte() instead of making a new function?  12) do you know what a ""data type cast"" means in C? (Sorry if you do just checking, not obvious from code)"
AskElectronics,3dumw0,scubascratch,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:03:46 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: I'm pretty sure the read function works now, but write still doesn't  New pastebin link: http://pastebin.com/w9hUCa8M  EDIT: A quick question: in the datasheet it mentions an 'optional chip erase mode', which supposedly erases the entire chip. It requires one 12V signal though, for which I would either have to buy a step-up converter, or demolish an old laptop wall wart. It says optional but I guess I should ask anyway. Do you have to erase the entire chip (with this 'optional' erase mode) before you write to it? This would explain why writing doesn't work and reading does.  First off all, thanks for the massive reply!  Now, on to address all points!  0) Holy shit I'm stupid, although it still doesn't fully work now :P Instead of the random value 7, it now always reads 255, which is the default value, leading me to believe the read function is working, while the write function isn't  1) There is indeed an io_output() function, and right now the only call to it is in the setup function, but since for testing purposes I only write to the EEPROM once, which is before I read from it, it shouldn't matter.  2) Setup indeed exists. I just verified all the pins to be mapped correctly. I also verified them all to be working, because of point 4)  3) I indeed omitted data polling, but since the datasheet specifies the maximum write time to be 10 milliseconds, and I delayed for 15 milliseconds, it should be fine. I will add data polling regardless though, just to be sure.  3.5) I am actually aware of that and there is a 1 second delay in the setup function ;)  4) I measured every single pin that is used, as you recommended, and got the following results:  Control pins   OE: 4,64V  WE: 4,64V  CE:  4,64V  So the control pins working correctly.  Data lines (these values are for writes, but the reads are within 0.01V of these values so I didn't bother to post them):  By the way, these were set to high one by one (which worked for all of them) and at the same time. These are the values when they are set to high at the same time.  io_1: 4,64V  io_2: 4,63V  io_3: 4,63V  io_4: 4,63V  io_5: 4,64V  io_6: 4,64V  io_7: 4,63V  io_8: 4,54V  So the data lines are fine as well.  Address lines (all were set to high individually once, and at the same time once, both yielded within 0.01V of these results (when they were on):  A0: 4,64V  A1: 4,62V  A2: 4,63V  A3: 4,64V  A4: 4,63V  A5: 4,64V  A6: 4,64V  A7: 4,62V  A8 up to and including A14: ~0V  So for some reason, the second shift register stopped working, but since it's consistently not working, it shouldn't matter. Also I'm only using address 1 for testing purposes (tried a few others as well though), so again it doesn't matter for now. Since the minimum logic voltage for the EEPROM is 2,0V everything should be fine. By the way, I tested each pin individually and in the end activated each group (control pins, address lines, data lines) at the same time, and both yielded the same results.  4.4) No, I did not ;)  4.5) I am not dead yet!  5) Well, my native language isn't English so I had to translate all the function names before I posted here. In retrospect a better name would have been shift_bits().  6)  Verified to be working, since I did step 4) which involved measuring every single line connected to the shift register, but will post anyway (I will update the pastebin link)  7) Well, yes, I just double checked the pinout and I'm powering it correctly, also no shorts or anything. The datasheet didn't mention a bypass cap so I didn't bother (I know, I'm lazy). I just tested it with a 0.1uF cap and it still doesn't work.  9) Yeah, this is because there was originally a third shift register, with things like status LEDs and the like. I removed it, however, because the basic programming of the EEPROM didn't even work. Once this all works I will add it again, which is why a straight-up assignment won't work, as it will set all non-address line bits of aanstaanden, and therefore the shift registers, to 0.  10) You are correct. I made a separate function for it when troubleshooting, for ease of reading.  11) It is only equivalent to shift_a_byte if you assume that the entire body of put_addresses is just 'aanstaanden = (int) address', which in 9), I have clarified not to be the case.  12) Yes, why do you ask?"
AskElectronics,3dumw0,scubascratch,2,Mon Jul 20 09:47:56 2015 UTC,I will try to respond to this in detail later but for the moment I am sure you do not need to use 12v full chip erase mode.  Something you should check is the Datasheet mentions a software write protection mode which is enabled and disabled by specific byte write sequences. Maybe you inadvertently set it to block writes.
AskElectronics,3dumw0,scubascratch,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:48:10 2015 UTC,"OK so just to check I just swapped out my EEPROM for some SRAM, and sure enough the SRAM is programmed and read just fine.   This leads me to believe my write and read functions are working correctly, and the chips may indeed have software write protection. I wrote the following code: http://pastebin.com/fD7PmWwd  However, again, it doesn't seem to work. I didn't bother to repost the other code, but obviously it's still there. This function is called after a 2 second delay in the setup function, and after it there is a 5 second delay before writing some actual data.  Is there something obviously wrong with it? The thing I am afraid of is that all of my chips (I've only got 3) were DOA. While searching for answers to my problem on the internet, in the end the problem was usually that the chips all turned out to be dead. Is there a way to check this? This would suck, mostly because it would delay my project by about 2 weeks.  Thanks for the help so far anyway!"

Then who knows if they are even EEPROMs at all.  So write some loop code that walks the whole address space and dumps it out at you. See if the chips you have on hand show any difference in unprogrammed default contents.  Without a known good programmer it's hard to see how you can verify the chip vs the code.  One last tiny thing I thigh of but did not mention in the first text wall was the chip, when in write mode, let's you drop either /WE then /CS, first, then drop the other. You do this on your code with two consecutive turn_off() calls which seems like it should be fine. The datasheet does not show a minimum time delay between them, so presumably it doesn't matter. But if the compiler optimized well, and you are running at 16 MHz (are you? What arduino is this?) then the delay between to output pins sets is only like 125ns or something. Maybe there's some in-documented issue with timing on the chip. You should try two things: reverse the order of the pins in your turn_offs that are in the write method. If that doesn't work, stick a tiny delay between them.  Also, try writing the polling code for write complete: read back both bits 6 and 7 of data pins (you switch them to input mode first) in a loop and print the output. Bit 6 is supposed to toggle every time you read it and 7 is supposed to flip when write finishes or something. Check the data sheet. See if the chip is even pretending to work.  Also, try a different address than 1. Maybe you exhausted the page write limit already. Try a distant address far away from 1. I don't know if that chip has wear leveling in it or what. Seems unlikely, the wear limit is kinda low for eeprom like 10k if I remember from the datasheet."

They are NOT designed for inductive loads like motors.  Will a dimmer sort of make the motor go slower? Yes.   So what is the risk then?  Glad you asked!  Actually it's pretty simple: motors require more energy to start going than they do to just keep on going. Common motor will need 3-5x power at startup. Usually this startup surge only lasts around a second. For a small motor even less. For a big motor is could be longer. While a motor is undergoing the startup surge, 3-5x the amount of heat is also being generated. But that goes away after a couple seconds right? Not if there is a dimmer in the circuit: the dimmer will chop up the waveform in a way that reduces the total energy, so the motor has to take much longer to get past the startup surge. Maybe now it takes longer maybe 10 seconds. And it's making 3-5x as much heat. Also, the dimmer is making as 3-5x as much heat as normal. Maybe the motor never gets to full speed just groans along slower but is weirdly humming and getting hot how odd. Oh you have the dimmer at 20%? Yeah the motors not gonna spin at all, you actually just turned the ceiling fan, into a 60 Watt in-ceiling heater! Sweet! I always wanted a ceiling heater.... For that time I wanted my HOUSE TO BURN DOWN!!! Hahahahahaa a  Ok the risk of house burning down is actually somewhere below the 100% I imply above.  However the house fire risk is also above zero. That leaves quite a range and it's hard to put an exact number on it by I can tell you that if a building inspector was inspecting the work by an actual licensed electrician, and that inspection revealed a ceiling fan that was fed by a light dimmer, that's a clear sign of incompetence and the job site is now getting red tag shut down and the occupancy permit is now on hold until every single box is opened and inspected.  So I would say fire risk and totally failed building inspection would be two possible reasons to keep in mind when considering dimmer controlled fan.

But I think it would be hard to find a rotary switch potentiometer that could handle the ~30 watts of a table fan. I modeled an approximation of it here:  http://imgur.com/9STt0qo (sorry my iPad sim doesn't have universal motor so I just used DC motor and made the source DC. The resistor behavior is identical for ac or dc).  With the slowest setting (I picked 550 ohms), the peak power handled by the resistor is 16 watts and even at 2 seconds in the resistor is still dropping 7.5 watts all by itself. So the resistors will get pretty hot. You would need a 10 or 20 watt heat sink. This is a little less than an electric mug heater or about what a cheap soldering pencil will put out. The steady state of the resistor will be about 6 watts once the fan is at speed.  You probably could find a wire-wound power rheostat that could handle the watts, get the next size up so a 50 watt rheostat. It's still going to dissipate 5-10 watts of heat but should be able to stay alive. Keep hot parts away from fingers.  Or you could drop $25 on one of these with a fuse built in..."

AskElectronics,3dtlwr,fatangaboo,2,Sun Jul 19 16:48:29 2015 UTC,"true. Making a polyphonic synthesizer increases the complexity level tremendously. It basically mandates digital control over the entire system, at a bare minimum at least on the note allocation section.  This link has some information about early poly synths. http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jan01/articles/synthsec.asp  Even if you used fully digital control with midi input to avoid the nightmare of making your own keyboard, the hard part would still be making multiple copies of the same circuit and keeping them all exactly tuned to each other.   It's absolutely doable of course but I think it would be more fun and more useful to focus on making one really great mono synthesizer and making it awesome."
AskElectronics,3dtlwr,QuerulousPanda,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:26:13 2015 UTC,"One cool thing is that once you've gone digital, you can use stuff like PWMs to generate tuning adjust biases and things like that, so at least keeping stuff tuned isn't really horrible to accomplish, but still adds a little complexity.  Of course nowadays it's mostly direct digital synthesis so there's not all that much analog stuff in the mix by that point.  If your clock oscillator is good, that's all your tuning right there."
AskElectronics,3dtlwr,bradn,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:06:56 2015 UTC,"Digital potentiometers are a thing. They have 256 R values from 0-10K ohm and controlled by I2C. Full left-wiper-right potentiometer wiring, and usually ganged like 6 channels on a 24 pin chip.  These work awesome for making digital controlled filters, amplifiers, attenuators, VCO a little but the step size may be an issue. You can even bang them around fast enough to make low fi audio waves, but using them as a wave source DAC is not the best use."

AskElectronics,3dtlwr,bradn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:17:28 2015 UTC,"Ok sorry though it was the raw synthesis elements.  Synchronizing across polyphonic duplicates sounds pretty tweaky. The tempco and tolerance will be tricky and need trimming. Sometimes I think a setup where there is a kind of complex resistor divider made up from two outer 5% 10k resistors and then on the inside a 1K digital pot with 256 taps, and maybe a cheap temp sensor like LM34 thermally bonded to the resistors. With this setup there would be fine control at the needed narrow range but also cheap resistors for the bulk part. If wide temp stability is needed then use the LM34 and adjust digipot as needed. The next level would be to have coarse and fine made with two or 3 digipots, where the coarse channels are 10k or even 100K. I have an ongoing radio transmitter interface this might be useful on I'll have to give it more thought"
AskElectronics,3dtlwr,scubascratch,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:41:51 2015 UTC,But most Dig Pots are 5V only. Very difficult to implement when using +-12V rails.
AskElectronics,3dtlwr,mijn_ikke,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:27:38 2015 UTC,This is true and I have wrecked one half of one channel on a digipot before realizing it. You need to establish a virtual ground at 2.5v and AC couple line level audio through that way
AskElectronics,3dtlwr,scubascratch,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:40:34 2015 UTC,"The early keyboards were monophonic.

AskElectronics,3dtlwr,ampman-uk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:08:16 2015 UTC,"It sounds like the maximum number of simultaneous notes, is equal to the number of hardware voltage dividers provided.  Possibilities include 5 simultaneous notes (one hand), 11 simultaneous notes (both hands + the nose), 20 simultaneous notes (two people playing the same keyboard at once LINK1 , LINK2), and 88 simultaneous notes (all keys).  Since the frequency spacing between notes is 21/12 = 1.0595X, I suppose you want the voltage divider accuracy to be lots, LOTS better than 6%.  Say, 0.1%.  For a 61-key keyboard and five simultaneous notes, that's 305 of the 0.1% resistors.  At USD 0.05 each in quantity (sales page), that's $15.25 for the divider resistors."
AskElectronics,3dtlwr,fatangaboo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:12:17 2015 UTC,modern keyboards tend to use a matrix to decode the keys and most polyphonic synths tend to limit the number of voices. and extra ccts like DE multiplexors and sample and hold circuits are used.

Others have pointed out resources for making an analog synth, but if that proves to be a bit much in terms of cost or complexity, or if you want to learn a little about embedded systems, you can always grab an Arduino or other microcontroller and try making your own direct-digital synthesis instrument (in the case of Arduino, there are MIDI libraries that will let you interface MIDI controllers to your synth as well).

AskElectronics,3dvq33,Jawnnn,4,Sun Jul 19 22:47:08 2015 UTC,"Your best bet would be to take the guts from a USB power bank, and combine with a lipo battery that supports high currents. Hobbyking probably has something designed for quadcopters or helicopters that will work.  Obviously it's not going to last very long if you're drawing 2A at 5V and you're limited to small batteries, but it's about the best you can do.  The power bank electronics are more convenient than bare boost converters because they also do charging and battery protection."

AskElectronics,3dvq33,bal00,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:59:22 2015 UTC,"The voltage of a lipo is between 3.0V and 4.2V depending on its state of charge. The power bank electronics will boost that voltage to 5.0V and keep it there, regardless of what the battery voltage is. Having a stable, regulated supply voltage is important for a project like this.  It can provide anywhere from 0.05A to 2A.  The other aspects I mentioned (battery charging and protection) are just as important though, because lipos need both. If you discharge the battery too far and the voltage is allowed to drop below 3.0V or so, you damage the battery, and possibly destroy it.  If you charge it to a voltage that's too high, even if it's just 0.1-0.2V too high, the battery may go up in flames. So proper charging circuitry is vital."

For the Arduino I was told the same thing. 5v 2a for a lilypad arduino. Size is more important to me in this search than how long it would last, it's mainly just an exercise in what's possible. Hence, me having no idea for mAh."
AskElectronics,3du14a,oneevening,7,Sun Jul 19 13:38:10 2015 UTC,it depends on how the specifications are read. If you assume 15-20mA per channel then its too much for those 3 AA batteries to handle. its more reasonable to assume 15-20mA per entire module (all 3 combined). With the assumption of the entire module running at 15-20mA then you get 3600-4800mAH. That sounds alot more reasonable for 3 AAs to handle so its most likely that. Typical AA gets about 400-900mAH for cheapo brands and 1000-1500mAH for heavy duty ones. Considering its marketing they probably picked the heaviest dutiest on the market for better numbers so they can claim it while not lieing about it and such. There is also bigger AA ones but they start getting really expensive really fast. the bigger ones might even last with your calculations for 3*15maH. Google non-rechargable AA lithium batteries. they can pump 2400maH or more.  As for current drawn with the MCU - With the proper use of sleep modes and interrupts and such you can get the current drawn down to insignificant ammounts (few nA) so it should pose that much of a issue for power consumption. Duration calculations also most likely assumed no fiddling (sleeping MCU) and disabled bluetooth - basically just running LEDs - to get prettier numbers.  TLDR: Marketing will post the best sounding number at best assumptions
AskElectronics,3du14a,Theoldknight1701,2,Sun Jul 19 14:02:41 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply.  Wouldn't running entire module at 20mA result in very dim lighting ? Each channel should get more or less 7mA and that is almost the 1/3 of the maximum current a channel can achieve.   Furthermore, how can you put the MCU to sleep mode when it continuously has to PWM the LED ?"
AskElectronics,3du14a,Theoldknight1701,3,Sun Jul 19 14:15:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah it might be dim but it doesnt seem like much of a lightsource to me. just a difuse light gimmick for when its dark. and when its dark even small ammounts of dim lights can be enough to be pretty i guess. As for the sleep - there is quite a few stages of sleep modes. Example of the AVR (the chip that arduino uses) can stage trough quite a few sleep modes. Put CPU to sleep while the PWM peripheral is running and wake on interrupt (button, module communication request etc). you can basically put everything not vital to sleep while still running PWM.

If your wall power adapter is rated at 20V 1A, the DC-DC converter could supply 5V at 3A, for example. Switch-mode buck converters have the ability to trade voltage for current, unlike linear ones.  On a more practical note though, if you're using one of those DC-DC modules with the three little multi-turn pots, you shouldn't really run them at such high currents because they don't have enough heatsinking.  And if you're interested in a cheapo variable power supply, I would take a look at this useful module. You can get them for about $15, and if you use one in conjuction with a laptop power brick, you'll have a pretty decent substitute for a bench power supply."
AskElectronics,3dtgh7,bal00,2,Sun Jul 19 09:22:46 2015 UTC,"So, in this case, the amount of amps used on the output at a given voltage is inversely proportional to adapter's?  I mean if, in a perfect world (circuit), I plug in a 1.5A @ 9V adapter, I will be able to have 3A @ 4.5 V or 0.75A @ 18V on the output? In the same fashion: if I want to have 2A @ 24V on the output I will have to plug in a 48V 1A adapter?   Basically, the circuit can't ""make"" new current without sacrificing voltage."
AskElectronics,3dtgh7,bal00,4,Sun Jul 19 10:24:30 2015 UTC,"Yep, you got it. One thing you need to consider is the efficiency of the circuit, which is typically between 80-90% for a switch-mode DC-DC converter.  1.5A @ 9V is 13.5W. Assuming 80% efficiency, you can get about 10.8W out of it. So if the output is set to 4.5V, the maximum current would be 10.8W / 4.5V = 2.4A.

AskElectronics,3dtgh7,Althaine,2,Sun Jul 19 10:28:33 2015 UTC,"I think what you are asking is what the wall adapter current limit needs to be? It depends on what you are trying to do.  As a first approximation, the LM2596 is 80% efficient (see the graph on page 6 of the datasheet). So if your load is, say, 5V at 3A (15W out) then your wall adapter needs to provide at least 19W to the DC/DC module. If the wall adapter outputs 12V then it needs to be capable of supplying 1.6A for this to work.  The better question is why you are going Wall Socket -> AC/DC Plug Pack -> DC/DC module when it sounds like you haven't selected the AC/DC Plug Pack yet. It may be simpler and cheaper to just buy a wall adapter with the output voltage you desire in the first place.  Edit: Alternatively, I could read the very first sentence and see that you are trying to make a variable power supply. You'll need to size the input power supply to be bigger than your maximum desired output voltage and power."

I have to ask. why ? and why 16 bit .. do you have any idea how many gates you are talking about total ?  how is the microcode going to function ?   Electronics Australia published a CPU build back in the 70's. It was called the Educ8 (educate .. lol)  welcome to the 70's, I had a MiniScamp back then, switches get old real fast. The fun part of living 40 years after this time is being able to use the stuff developed in the last 40 years.  http://www.ljw.me.uk/educ8/educ8.html"
AskElectronics,3droxc,scubascratch,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:11:59 2015 UTC,"I'll answer your questions in order:  1) Why? Because I've written multiple CPU simulators in software, and I recently have been designing a PCB at my job, so I wanted to put the two together and make a CPU in hardware. Also, I just want to figure out how it's done.  2) Why 16 bit? Because I want a useable system. 8 bits is too small for my taste, and 32 bits would cost too much (for all the parts and time to build it). 16 bits is perfect.  3) Do you know how many gates it'll take? Well, approximately. I figure the CPU will have a memory chip, maybe 16 register chips, some adders, and-ers, or-ers, multiplexers, inverters, etc.; if each TTL IC costs around 40 cents, I figure I'll spend less than $100 on this.  3) Each instruction (of which there are 16) has either 0 or 1 arguments (for example, neg just negates A, the accumulator, so it doesn't have a parameter; add adds its argument to the accumulator). If the argument is a literal/constant, then the instruction takes 3 bytes of RAM; otherwise, 1 byte.   The first clock cycle of the instruction, the CPU will read the first byte from memory and decode it. If no more reads from or writes to RAM are required for the instruction, then in the first clock cycle the CPU will also compute the necessary values for the instruction, and store them in the appropriate registers. The second and third clock cycles maybe be used to read a constant argument from RAM, or to execute a load-from-RAM or write-to-RAM instruction. That's about it!   As much as it may seem like a good idea to look at existing homebrew CPUs for inspiration, I actually want to design and implement it completely on my own. I often learn things by doing them, such as a language interpreter, compiler, basic OS, simulated CPUs, and now a hardware CPU (if it works!). I plan to use n-channel MOSFETS to build it, and that's technology developed in the last 40 years, right :)? So my system will be quite modern, I should say!"

For more specific components and ICs i'd recommend farnell or mouser since those are pretty much world wide and might avoid custom duties (depending on the country you're in). Sparkfun, adafruit and alike are more of hobbyist communities than shops - components do not have that of a good prices but they usually have some specialty items like shields for development boards, arduinos, PIs etc. They also have different modules and all comes nicely explained with documentation. Shipping might be more than the purchase. If you really need components, already know how they work and what they are, and don't really care about datasheets you should consider ebay, aliexpress or such - It would be hard to get a better deal (price/quantity) but depending on the seller some components might be dodge. Usually it has pretty slow shipping, but free. For tools i'd recommend going with known brands that have wide range of equipment from mid-entry level to proffessional/industrial grade like hakko, ersa and such. Any major brand has a website and has a online store and/or authorized dealers by country. Buying from their shop you can be sure it's genuine and get full coverage of the warranty. If they don't have a online shop but have a list of authorized dealers check if you'r country is there - the item might be a bit more expensive but it's already imported so there are no more import duties or shipping fees for you to worry about, not to mention that you get a local warranty and don't need to wait."

AskElectronics,3dsaq8,KingOfSomeThings,3,Sat Jul 18 23:47:48 2015 UTC,"To add on to what /u/roto314 said, each circuit breaker/fuse has a certain amount of current it'll let through before tripping for safety.   It could be that the items on that circuit account for say 80%, and when your ""adapter"" is plugged in, it takes it to 110% when everthing is on.  Now, you mention you ""paid a little extra for one""... is it a ""Battery backup"" or ""uninterruptible power supply""?   If that's the case, then yeah, it'll continue working for a bit, despite the power being out.  Assuming the wall outlet has two plugs, does anything else plugged into it still work?"
AskElectronics,3dsaq8,BornOnFeb2nd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:16:17 2015 UTC,"Oh I see, so we've basically just got too much turned on at once?  I can't remember exactly what I paid for since it was awhile ago (but the problems are recent) I just remember it being more expensive than the others because it offered individual on/off switches for each outlet, some kind of protection, and I don't think it's a battery because I've continued to watch TV for a good while after the lights have gone out without it being a problem. And yes, two outlets, but the powerstrip thing I have isn't an extension wire one, it hangs just below the whole outlet when plugged in. UK plugs tend to have their cable going down from the plug but this means the powerstrip is in the way and so I don't use the other outlet."
AskElectronics,3dsaq8,BornOnFeb2nd,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:30:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's not good.  If the lights go out, but your TV and such stay on, then unless the UK is wired up with magic, they should be un-related.     When a circuit trips, everything on that circuit loses power.    It doesn't knock out a neighboring circuit.  Next time the lights click off, see what everyone was doing... did someone turn something on? (hair dryers, heaters, curling irons are big culprits), did something turn itself on? (AC, Heat, Fridge, etc), or did it just appear to be random?  If you can't pin down a cause, then you'll probably want to get an electrician out there, since overloading a circuit means the wires could be heating up, which can lead to a house fire...  and that's no fun for anyone."
AskElectronics,3dsaq8,roto314,2,Sun Jul 19 01:25:51 2015 UTC,"This might be more of an /r/electricians question.  What do you have plugged into the adapter (which might be more accurately called a powerstrip)?  The lights that are going out?  Or your TV and consoles?  If the devices plugged into the adapter/strip are staying on, then you can almost certainly say that it's not causing the problem.  When fuses blow repeatedly, you should disconnect some of the appliances that are affected (the ones that lose power when the fuse blows) to see if you can eliminate the problem.  If you can't easily identify what is causing the problem, or the only things on the affected circuit are built in to the house/apartment (like ceiling lights), you should contact an electrician before continuing to replace the fuse or reset the breaker.  You might have a wiring problem or a defective fixture that could lead to a fire!"
AskElectronics,3drd22,mudclub,3,Sat Jul 18 18:43:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, voltage will sag under load and over time. Battery has an internal resistance which works just like a resistor in a circuit - if you pass current thru it it will have a voltage drop so a fully charged battery with a load of 1A will have different reading that 10A load. On your examples of 4.2W It will be minimal. Battery will be outputting (nominal) 12V (actual voltage will depend on battery but might be somewhere between 11V-14V when discharged and just removed from the charger - depends on battery, not really relevant as long as your components can cope with potential differences) so whatever you connect to them it will have to be able to support 12V. From point of view of the battery it doesn't care if what's connected is a 5V phone or 12V motor, it provides 12V and current that circuit requires everything else is component's problem. I'd recommend using switch mode regulators as they are more efficient and can cope with a bigger load outputting less heat and unlike linear regulators don't have a 1-2V drop at the output. You can get them cheat on ebay and such. Don't forget to use a protection diode on motor terminals."
AskElectronics,3drd22,Lhosha,2,Sun Jul 19 01:26:24 2015 UTC,"It will depend on the SOC of the battery and will not always give out 12V, but if you connect them in parallel they will be the same voltage. If they share the same nodes they have the same voltage. It's as simple as that. May not be 12V all the time but it will be the same voltage."

You will find idiots buying parts that don't know if that's really what they need to fix their problem.  Expect returns and price accordingly.  Make sure to mark the boards you send somehow so you can tell if you're getting YOUR board back.  It is a crapshoot to receive returns without having a means to test them.  If you get something returned twice you might just have to write it off unless you're sure it's still working.

AskElectronics,3dqy2b,thegnomesdidit,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:36:19 2015 UTC,"The voltage is the breakdown voltage. It just means it will conduct in reverse at that voltage, that alone does not damage the diode. Not a desirable thing to have happen in a rectifier since there is no current limiting and it will most likely hurt the diode.  The current while in breakdown damages the diode. Zener diodes are operated in breakdown constantly, but with a current limit so they aren't damaged."
AskElectronics,3dqy2b,grem75,0,Sat Jul 18 17:00:54 2015 UTC,"so 1000 volts at 0.1A will kill it, as will 10A at 2V   Clarification:    simultaneously voltage = voltage directly across the diode, not voltage in the circuit.   So, 600 Vpeak of input voltage to the entire circuit, and at the same time 1 A RMS of current in each diode is OK, though at the margin of the safe operating area."
AskElectronics,3dqy2b,1Davide,2,Sat Jul 18 16:58:11 2015 UTC,"This shouldn't matter for a 1 amp  diode, but most  components also have a maximum temperature and power dissipation rating. So depending on the ambient temp and airflow, the current may need to be lower than maximum."
AskElectronics,3dqy2b,whitcwa,2,Sat Jul 18 18:34:26 2015 UTC,"A diode can only dissipate so much heat before it ceases to function as a diode.      So lets say your 1A diode can dissipate 1/2 watt.  If forward voltage is .5V then at 1 amps it would be dissipating its maximum allowed.       Same for reverse biased, if it starts conducting at 800 volts and current is .00062 amps, it is at its max rating.  When a diode gets too hot it will conduct in both directions, if it doesn't get too too hot it will start working again when it cools off."

AskElectronics,3dqy2b,1Davide,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:52:55 2015 UTC,"One important thing to keep in mind is the voltage given is often the peak inverse voltage, I.E the peak AC voltage that it can tolerate, the actual RMS AC voltage will be roughly sqrt(2) times lower than the peak voltage, in your case ~420Vrms, so you always want to read the datasheet, at DC the peak inverse voltage is the maximum, so 600VDC.  As for the current 1A is indeed the maximum average forward current, the average current depends on the circuit topology, a good overview is available here: http://www.hammondmfg.com/pdf/5c007.pdf  It's usually a good idea to use a rectifier that is at least 20% or more larger than the intended load current and input voltage in any case."

AskElectronics,3dppdd,galvanised_computer,2,Sat Jul 18 08:56:00 2015 UTC,The clicking is most likely the protection relay or power on relay actuating and being unable to power the device.  Meanwhile the PSU caps charge up and then continue powering the relay coil until they run out of juice.  It is probably a failure in the SMPS (switcher psu) board.  These are NOT user serviceable.  If you don't have experience repairing electronics at the component level this is not a good training project for you.  Barring obviously bulged caps and lacking halfway decent test gear your repair strategy will have to consist entirely of 'replace components wholesale until you accidentally fix it'.  Options are:   1) order a replacement PSU board and swap it out and hope that fixes it  2) junk it for parts  3) use it as a donor unit while you get experience doing electronics repair and if it gets fixed then that's a bonus  4) return it from whence it came and start with something a little more forgiving (example: something where grabbing a board improperly won't kill you)

The EX330 is a good choice to start with.  Also get a temp controlled solder station.  This is key working on modern boards especially which have multiple layers and ground planes.  Make sure you have a decent way to discharge power caps.  I use a 60W incandescent light bulb in a socket and connect the wires to the cap terminals.  This works pretty well but a power resistor also works.  ALWAYS check the high voltage caps for stored voltage whenever you power up and power down the unit before working on it again.  Getting hit with a HV cap is one of the least pleasant experiences you could deal with, with a close second being getting lit on fire.  There are useful ebooks on a certain website that rhymes with 'irate hay' on electronics repair, specifically interesting to you right now would be LCD repair and switching psu repair.    This site is useful: http://www.jestineyong.com/  Also google 'repairfaq' and print it out if you can and keep it handy.  You can probably skip printing the sections on things like fixing cassette decks and fax machines.  Use your discretion.  Remember SAFETY ALWAYS.

The I2C pins are compatible with 3.3 or 5.0V from the host MCU, when the IO expander is powered by 5V.  There are also tricks you can use to multiplex the parallel data wire connections with panel switches, and the extra IO pins (one normal I/O and an interrupt pin) can be used to control a backlight with multiple brightnesses if desired.  You get all that for a 4 wire connection to your front panel, if 6 or 7 switches is enough to get you by."

AskElectronics,3dnkex,yammeringfistsofham,2,Fri Jul 17 19:24:57 2015 UTC,"Screw terminals probably won't vibrate undone if they are done up tight. But they will form a stress point in the wire which could cause a fatigue failure. If you must use screw terminals make sure that you strain relieve the wires somehow and they should be OK.  Crimp connectors are better as they generally have a section of the crimp to make electrical connection, and another section to strain relieve the joint by biting into the wire insulation.  Something like Tyco ""Power Double Lock"" or one of the Mate'n'lock series would be a good choice. They have quite strong locking clips and some are available with blackout prevention clips for extra security."
AskElectronics,3dnkex,A1cypher,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:34:36 2015 UTC,"We use screw connectors a bit and in order to reduce stress on the wire we use a crimped ferrule.  The ferrule crimps nice and flat and makes an excellent mechanical/electrical connection inside the screw.     In fact, the screw and crimp method is often preferred in some standards because it is more secure than a crimp alone in a housing since there is risk that the small little locking metal piece on the inserted pin could become damaged resulting in the pin coming free from the housing.  The pin could be damaged by a mistake in manufacturing, a sloppy crimp, or just from too much force pulling on the individual wire.  The housing itself could also be damaged resulting in pins that come loose."

So I would turn it on, reset the breaker, turn it on, reset the breaker....Usually after two times the motor wiring warmed up to where the resistance got high enough to limit the surge current to what the breaker could handle.

One the has a soft start feature so the power gently ramps up from 0% to 100% in a few seconds.  Can you change the breaker? Some are more sensitive than others.  Another trick would be a long extension cord to connect the compressor to the wall outlet. If you do this don't have the cord rolled up in a tight spiral, use big loops the size of an adult human.

If there is a check valve, it is possible that it is bleeding back and allowing air to build up in the cylinder.

AskElectronics,3do0l0,created4this,2,Sun Jul 19 18:15:05 2015 UTC,"The leds are powered through the FETs, each FET has its source tied to 12v  FETs are switched by voltage, so, as you have worked out the resistor pulls the voltage on the gate to 0v which turns on the FET, when the flash relay is connected through the switch to the FET the high signal connects 12v to the gate and the FET switches off. The effect of using the FETS here is to invert the signal from the flasher unit.    Think of FETs like pressure activated switches, think of the resistor like a leaky tap feeding a hosepipe and the flasher unit as a jet nozzle on the end of the pipe. When the jet nozzle is shut the pressure builds in the pipe until it can flip the switch, open the nozzle and a tiny dribble of water comes out but the pressure plummets shutting the switch off.   One thing a lot of people struggle with is thinking of voltage as relative rather than absolute, in the diagram I have labelled a number of points as 12v and a number with the ground symbol, I could just as easily have used 120v and 108v or 0v and -12v.  When we talk about P channel FETs we reference voltages the voltages that turn them on /with respect to the source voltage/ so you may see that to turn on the FET you need to put -7v on the gate, this isn't a magic negative voltage, it simply means 7 volts less than the voltage on the source (12v -7 = 5v)"

AskElectronics,3dnckm,dockerhate,2,Fri Jul 17 18:33:22 2015 UTC,So I agree totally and I do this almost every day. Often it's easier to harvest an old part then to order a new one and wait a week for it to arrive. (I live very rurally).   The problem is as others in this thread have stated that many parts (electrolytic caps especially) have a short MTBF (Mean time between failures). so I reccoment getting one of these. This device will save you from wasting time with parts that no longer match the specs written on the side.

I recommend desoldering instead of clipping for most parts, so you have usably long leads left. Then decide if the parts and the enjoyment you get from doing it are worth enough to spend however much time salvaging them, versus buying new parts. It could be a good time to listen to podcasts or whatever too.  Some parts are more worth salvaging than others, especially ones that are expensive to buy new and ones that you can get off the board really quickly.  For buying parts cheaply, I suggest Tayda. They also post coupon codes on their Facebook page monthly, so follow that.  You might also be interested in a robot to do component salvage.

In most cases, this is not a big deal, because the cable length is short, the wire gauge is appropriate, and the current is low (or within spec), resulting in a drop of perhaps a couple of millivolts.  Figure out the current draw of the IP webcam (if its USB, might be rated for 500mA), and then calculate the resistance of the wire you plan on using with the webcam (with an online calculator) to see what kind of drop you have.  Assuming you don't exceed the length specs for the USB data itself, you could look at using a power-supply that has remote sensing capability, and run an additional set of sense lines. Those will carry virtually no current (fed into a high-impedance input on the power supply), but it will let the power supply regulate such that 5V is delivered at the destination (and you could potentially see something like 5.2-5.5V right at the supply, before the harness drop)."

AskElectronics,3dldfd,Laogeodritt,4,Fri Jul 17 20:15:02 2015 UTC,"Before USB 3 standardised a protocol for requesting high-current charging, there were a variety of protocols for detecting a high-current charger, from 200Ω (I think) between the data lines (not a short) to having various specific voltages on each data line (can be achieved with a resistive voltage divider network—don't remember if it looks for specific impedances on the lines too).  You could potentially design small devices at both ends that ensures that high current charging is enabled on both the power source and the load (if needed). It would also avoid having to carry 4 wires plus shield across a long distance, instead you just have two lines delivering power (5V and ground); if it's purely for power, there's no need for the complex cable design involved in passing 480Mbps (or 5Gbps-ish for USB3 superspeed) of data without error."

Using Ohms law V=IR V=41*2, there are 82v dropped over this cable,   IE put 83v on one end, draw 2A out the other and you'll only see 1v at the other end.    Now, be really careful, say the device pulls 2A when rebooting, but only pulls 0.25 when sleeping. This means that when the device is asleep you'll see:  V=IR V=41*0.24 IE 10v dropped over the cable.   IE if you were to put the same 83v on the end and draw 0.25A then you would see 73v on the end of the cable. Easily enough to blow up any usb device.   So, you have to specify the wire resistance so that the voltage drop for the extremities 0A and 2A are both within spec. Say USB can work with 5.3v to 4.5v. This means your voltage drop must be at most 0.7v at 2A.   V=IR (again!) 0.7/2 = R = 0.35 ohm  Keeping with the theme of 1000' use the table... you need 5 gauge cable to achieve this, which is 12 times thicker than the cable we started with and the kind of cable you would wire a cooker with.   That seems like it might be overkill, by which I mean, something must be crazy because you don't see 4mm cable being used for 5v signals in the wild. Well, yes, it's crazy but it isn't the maths ;) if you want to move power long distances then transport it at higher voltage and step down locally.   To draw the same power (P=IV) of 10W through a 240v cable you only need to draw 0.05A (0.1A for 110v cable)  If you use 5% as acceptable voltage losses on this US cable then   V=IR 5.5/0.1 = R = 55 ohms  Suddenly that 25 gauge wire is totally fine to use to transport mains power to a local transformer."

The process the part is built on is likely rates for that absolute max, but who knows what the long term reliability will do.  I will say this -- older parts that are not on sub-micron processes will likely be more robust. A modern 1.2V part will likely have its gate oxides begin cracking as soon as you exceed the maximums. A 5.5V 7400-series part can likely tolerate 6V without immediate damage, but there's no way to prove it.  Stay within the recommended parameters for your part -- I feel like you might be asking this to avoid using a regulator of some type.

That's actually a great test to do before you start checking for a short in a circuit. You've successfully characterized the short circuit condition of your multimeter. Now you know that if you actually measure a short in a circuit, it'll read as 1.5 - 2 ohms on your meter.  Now, if you're not getting a reading, it means your scale is too low. Set the dial to the next highest scale and repeat the measurement, and repeat until you find the correct scale that gives you a reading.

Briefly though, as a very, very layman's definition, they provide a local reservoir of charge for a local load, rather than perturbing the energy storage elements of the power supply feeding the device.  If you don't put a cap in, your primary power rail is probably going to see a lot of ripple voltage and may drop out of spec."

But make sure that there isn't superimposed noise that pushes it below 2.5V.  If you have an oscilloscope, measure the VCC, measure digital inputs (especially with long wires involved), measure any clocks... make sure these things aren't getting pushed out of the safe range even if VCC is still technically okay.  Also, make sure to consider the worst case noise when there are things nearby like noisy cheap replacement laptop adapters, etc.  You'd be surprised the havoc something like that can cause in the right circumstances."

AskElectronics,3dl7lg,Icehoot,2,Fri Jul 17 16:57:01 2015 UTC,"Browning-out is bad, if you don't have a detection mechanism for it (voltage supervisor of some type) -- many MCUs have that integrated, and will generate a reset for you indicating a brown-out happened.  If you don't have such detection, and the part drops out of spec voltage-wise, there is no guarantee as to proper function, state of internal registers / logic, etc. The manufacturer guarantees that a set of specifications will be met from 2.5V to 5.5V (sometimes they will have separate tables based on VCC -- for instance, maximum frequencies may drop at lower voltages) across a certain temp range.  2.7V is fine for 2.5V, if you have sufficient capacitance / a good enough PDN that you're not seeing 200mV of ripple if some load switches on or off.  Also, you said you're using a buck regulator -- is it capable of operating in a 100% duty-cycle mode (i.e. pass-through input voltage), or does it shut down if the duty-cycle goes too high? I'm not sure how it would pass through while off unless the top switch is a PFET."
AskElectronics,3dl7lg,LobsterSoulSandwich,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:45:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the response! :) I think the MCU does have a brown-out detector, but I don't think the accelerometer does. Not ideal if the system if constantly resetting due to a brown out either, but I understand the dangers of it now  About the buck: I believe it has pass through at lower input voltages, but not sure. I only remember it distinctly having two modes of operation (PWM mode and other at lower voltages). I chose it because it claims 95% efficiency at my ideal operating conditions, but I'm considering switching to a Buck-Boost with 90% max efficiency in order to keep the supply from going below 3.3V"
AskElectronics,3dl7lg,LobsterSoulSandwich,2,Fri Jul 17 17:00:21 2015 UTC,"No big deal but there's things you need to consider:  Lower voltages can mean a slower clock speed, so an arduino will work at 2.7V but at 1MHz, which will change you timing routines.  Lower gate voltages on FET's means higher on resistance, not usually much of a problem."

If you want to know the distance as well you would need to set up a transponder, so you can measure time of flight to the point.   Reflections off the bottom wouldn't be a problem as long as you are measuring time of arrival of the first signal (which will be the shortest distance).

Use some sort of silicone sealant maybe, you'll have to experiment.  You may even be able to use those cheap disk piezos the same way, by sealing them over a hole in a box where your electronics goes (from the outside), using, say, a bolted on plate with a hole for the transducer, pushing transducer against an o-ring that pushes it against your electronics box (with a hole cut out for the contacts side of the transducer).

This is probably  beyond your skill level. Car radios are not easy to work on. You would have to identify the point between the demodulator and the power  amplifier. It isn't likely to be labeled. You would have to cut some traces and install a switch.   The sound quality isn't great, but you can add an FM modulator to get aux in without all the hassle. They are cheap, and you can move them to any car. I use one. Just make sure you pick an empty FM frequency so you don't interfere with broadcast signals.

Plain multimeters can be inadequate for this if they only give you a single voltage figure (is it voltage sampled at a random moment?  an average?  etc).  I suspect if a negative pulse is showing up at some point to the fan, this could be a cause for issues.  Most brushless ""DC"" fans are designed for PWM operation, but maybe not negative pulses.

AskElectronics,3dj577,Cyriz,2,Thu Jul 16 18:13:45 2015 UTC,"I am going to guess the first one is probably a capacitive touch switch and the second a resistive touch switch.  Touching the capacitive switch turns your body into an electron resevoir, for lack of a better term, and gives the 555 a momentary low.  For the resistive switch, touching both plates completes a path exposing the 555 pins to ground/low."

AskElectronics,3dj577,SweetMister,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:21:12 2015 UTC,"I agree, I think the touch switch inputs may be floating. But I think that is how the capacative switch works.  When you touch it and increase the capacitance a ton with your body the 555 sees a enough of a low to trigger. In the resistive version, notice the 3M3 resistor switches leads.  In the touch on connecting those to leads exposes pin2 straight to ground, in touch off connecting those to exposes pin 6 straight to Vcc."

You should also notice that there's a difference between protection circuits and battery management.  The exact value are debatable, as the curve doesn't have sharp corners. But generally, a 3.7 V Li-Ion battery shouldn't be discharged lower than 3 V. However, protection circuits generally kick in at 2.75 V.  Imagine a phone, that considers 3 V empty, and shuts down at that point. If that somehow fails, the protection circuit kicks in at 2.75 V. Why not 3 V? These things aren't that accurate. That could mean that the phone shuts off at 2.95 V, but the protection already killed it at 3.05 V, without proper shut-down procedure. If you try to turn the phone on now, you won't get a low battery warning. The phone will look broken.  TLDR: Don't use a protection circuit for normal operation. A protection circuit should normally never do anything."

AskElectronics,3de5ly,dizekat,5,Wed Jul 15 23:25:59 2015 UTC,"There all all sorts of creative thoughts once you allow some non idealities come into play. One thought I had was to consider the assumptions we make when writing the laplace transform (it is algebra telling us it should be ""1"" for all frequencies after all). We assume a system is linear and time invarient in order to write a laplace transform. So perhaps one way to approach the problem would be to try to make the LTI condition not true and hence the laplace transform ""1"" not valid. One way to do this is by varying the temperature and taking measurements at different temperatures. (Not time invarient anymore).  I'm sure there are also a lot of other things if you permit the existence of non-idealities. You could imagine that there is a mismatch in the resistances of some amount, or a certain tolerance to any of the components, work out expressions for those conditions then perform experiments to look for those.  If we are not permitted to have non-idealities then I am not sure.  What happens if you model the circuit with the inductor and capacitor as having some initial conditions? I.e. Like (this) . In this case are the impedances equal? Could you instantiate those initial conditions and then quickly measure if this indeed makes them not equivalent? I'm too lazy to do the algebra rn."
AskElectronics,3de5ly,fdbk,2,Wed Jul 15 23:12:03 2015 UTC,"The problem is that a resistor could be very non ideal as well (e.g. have inductance), so it can be still impossible or difficult to tell it apart if you don't know the resistor's properties either. And if resistor's inductance and parasitics are considered then it would be only fair if you were to add a few small capacitors and inductors to the other circuit to match that.  edit: maybe the winding-to-winding capacitance in the inductor is what would give it away. At a high enough frequency you should get <1 ohm because the inductor, instead of acting like an open circuit, is going to act like a dead short."

AskElectronics,3de5ly,Seedy_Seltzer,3,Fri Jul 17 04:05:58 2015 UTC,"The circuit on the left: as frequencies approach infinity the cap acts like a short and the inductor acts like an open so the right branch is the only one with current flowing through it. At frequencies approaching zero the indicator acts like a short and the capacitor acts like an open, so the left branch will take most of the current.   At frequencies between 0 and infinity the branches will share a proportion of the total current, but they will have associated impedance ( from the inductor and cap ) as well as the base 1 ohm resistor on each branch.

So, if we hypothesize some kind of thermal imaging which can respond to thermal signals a lot faster than 1 radian per second (= L/R = RC), then the thermal imaging will show different signatures for the two boxes.  Here I stimulate the boxes with square waves whose period is 8 seconds (0.78 radians/second) and whose amplitude is 1 volt.  LTSPICE SIMULATION RESULT  Notice that the power dissipation of box#1 is exactly what you'd expect: 1 volt across 1 ohm gives 1 watt.  Top panel, green trace.  The power dissipation of box #2 (the sum of the dissipation in Ra and the dissipation in Rb) is plotted in the bottom panel, red trace.  CONCLUSION: If you have a fast thermal imager you can distinguish between the two boxes.  This result should be obvious; the RL leg of box#2 has a ""smeared out"" (exponential) current waveform, and the RC leg of box#2 has a ""smeared out"" (exponential) current waveform.  Therefore the total power dissipation of box#2 will be ""smeared out"" and thus different from the step-function power dissipation of box#1."

AskElectronics,3dfszg,MATlad,2,Thu Jul 16 19:40:50 2015 UTC,"I'd cut it up and re-wire.  The cleanest look can be achieved if you use a Linesman / Western Union / NASA splice on the two conductors, put on liquid electrical tape to insulate, and then slide on a piece or two of adhesive shrink wrap to jacket and strengthen the splice.    If you don't have the above and don't mind it looking a little ugly, you can just use some small wire nuts (possibly requiring you to double or triple up on the conductors if they're really thin) and optionally wrap the thing up in electrical tape.  Or maybe some Wago lever nuts (which should form a secure connection on up to 30 gauge wires and resist vibration / tossing around--just don't put more than one solid or stranded wire into each cage).  Instead of buying and hacking up the StarTech, you could instead buy one of the wire-leaded 3.5 mm OD / 1.35 mm ID barrel cables off of this list, and attach it to one of the USB A male to round cable off of this list."

AskElectronics,3dfszg,sqwatchy,2,Thu Jul 16 05:07:04 2015 UTC,"Since reliability and robustness are your primary objectives, I'd probably go with the cable ends I linked to (you can likely also buy them from Mouser) and then build your own using the linesman splice and, as I mentioned, self-adhesive heat shrink over top of the splice to restore cable jacketing.    The StarTech cable probably uses 28 gauge conductors, whereas the cable ends should be thicker 24 or even 22 gauge (it'll say in the datasheet if not the product description).  Stiffer, but easier to work with and stronger.

She will approach your problem in two steps.  Step 1: build a voltage divider from two resistors and two voltage sources.  The left voltage source is Vin (a ±40V signal) and the left resistor is R1.  The right voltage source is Vthev and the right resistor is Rthev.  The midpoint between the resistors is VOUT.   Solve for R1, Rthev, and Vthev which give +5V out when Vin=+40V, and which give +0V out when Vin=-40V.  It's two equations in three unknowns so there are an infinite number of solutions.  Your advisor suggests you pick a solution which has R1 in the vicinity of 20Kohms.  Why?  So you're not loading down the input too much (R1 is sufficiently big) AND you're not too susceptible to noise and leakage current (R1 is sufficiently small).  Step 2: now that you've solved for Vthev and Rthev, synthesize them using Thevenin Equivalents from two new resistors and the given +5V power supply.  Done!  Anyone familiar with 4th order Runge-Kutta algorithms for numerical solution of differential equations, ought to know several electrical engineers.  edit- (here is the result you should get) -- +40V input produces +5V output, and -40V input produces +0V output.

AskElectronics,3ddavu,planet12,2,Wed Jul 15 15:00:11 2015 UTC,Look up summing amplifiers. You should be able to combine your (stepped down) input AC waveform with a very simple +2.5V reference from resistors without loading down either.
AskElectronics,3ddavu,dizekat,3,Wed Jul 15 11:42:21 2015 UTC,"People, if you're gonna downvote, say why - this may not be the right solution for this case, but it's a perfectly sensible solution.  It would allow trivial adjustment of both the offset, and the overall gain, allowing you to center the single right in the middle of your ADC range, and adjust the swing around it so you're not clipping - with simple trimpots.  The main disadvantages are that you'd need a negative rail to drive the opamp, and either a higher positive voltage supply for the opamp so you can get all the way to +5V or a rail-to-rail-IO opamp so you can get ""close enough""."
AskElectronics,3ddavu,LobsterSoulSandwich,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:26:34 2015 UTC,"With a 2.5v reference, you'd just need the topmost resistor be, say, 5 kOhm, and leftmost be, say, 75 kOhm, with the bottom-most resistor being infinite. (You can multiply or divide both values by any factor).  This is because what you're doing is getting yourself a 80:5 = 16:1 voltage divider.  To use a more common 5v reference, what you'd need is topmost and bottommost resistors be r , which works exactly the same as resistance of /r/2 to 2.5v. Then leftmost resistor should be r*15/2 . You pick the value that wouldn't load the circuit too much (and so that the current sinking into your ADC wouldn't screw it up too much)."

You just go searching for similar parts when something needs a standard footprint?     Eagle ships with a big library of ""generics"", which are schematic symbols and associated footprints for common discretes like chip resistors and caps.  What bothers me is that Altium seems to be engineered in a similar way which implies the same resources are there, since you can click on a component and associate it with a manufacturer part number found through web services at the time of placement (doesn't that imply that you keep a generic version of said component?).    In regards to (3): So are you saying there's a way to quickly make copies of a circuit within a PCB project?

I've used a lot of these and they are all quite good. The chip libraries and SOT/SOIC libraries i've used quite a few from.  The libraries even have M, N, and L versions which are all different size densities. I normally use the 'N' which is the nominal density. The high density footprints are difficult to hand solder where the low density ones have the biggest pads (I dont remember which one is the low or high density).  so basically stick with the ""n"" version of the libraries.   I also think all the chip component sizes are metric, so double check that if you place an ""0603"" chip resistor from this library that it isnt the metric sized one.... or else you'll have an issue.

AskElectronics,3debnf,toybuilder,2,Wed Jul 15 19:17:07 2015 UTC,"The ""official"" repository for parts is the Altium content vault (basically a vault you can connect to for free that at the same time is a sales pitch for the capabilities of their vault product). Do a Google search for ""how to connect to Altium content vault"".  You're unlikely to find the exact part you're looking for. However, you should really really learn how to quickly and efficiently create new schematic symbols and footprints. For most parts you can just copy and modify existing parts. And for some parts with strange footprints (connectors, modules) it's faster to just draw the footprint from scratch than to try to hunt it down somewhere.  For your particular part, you don't actually have to create anything new. Copy a schematic symbol (either from the Altium content vault or from the preinstalled libraries). Modify the parameters to point to your new manufacturer and part number, etc. Then take a standard sot-23 footprint (again, from the content vault or from the preinstalled libraries). Point the schematic to the footprint and you're done.  As for the identical circuits, there are a couple of ways to do it that I don't really have time to describe in detail. You can use rooms in the PCB editor and use the "" copy room format "" tool to copy layout from one to another. You can use Place > embedded board array to place an array of a board from another file (this is supposed to be for panelizing though, I wouldn't use it if you actually need multiple circuits on the same board). You can use ""multi-channel design"" in which you can put the circuit you want to copy on a separate schematic sheet, then use place > sheet symbol to place that onto your schematic sheet multiple times. They'll automatically be put into rooms and then you can use the ""copy room format"" feature to copy the layout. You can also use the ""snippets"" feature, but I've never actually used that.

AskElectronics,3de9zb,gundog48,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:23:07 2015 UTC,"No as voltage varies, so does current and power.  10ohm across 10v is 1 amp and 10W of power. 10ohm across 5v is 0.5 amp and 2.5W of power. Notice that power scales by the square. p = v(2)/r and p= i(2) x r   It helps to think of your fan as a simple resistor, and as long as it does not have an internal step up converter and can run at low voltage this assumption holds mostly true.   The reason your pot is not working correctly is you have probably cooked some of the carbon film/windings. They have a power rating aswell.  So think of your fan as a 63 ohm resistor, to put 100 ma across it you need 6v, so if you used 12v for power you would need another 63 ohm resistor in series.

This chip has an analog front-end that feeds into the digital output section, and it has separate AVDD/DVDD, but also has separate analog and digital returns.  First, consider where the current flows in your design. Second, remember that current flow causes voltage perturbations, as all real-world structures have resistance. If you tie your analog ground to digital ground, and happen to place this device on your PCB such that high currents flow by this chip, you're going to move around your analog ground reference. This is a 16-bit ADC -- that is incredibly sensitive.  See what their reference board did, but remember that the eval board is not always best practice for a real project. Datasheet can give you a hint as to whether the designers of this chip actually have separate metal layers inside for AVDD vs DVDD. Looks they have a guide for you: WAN-0129.  Though, to answer your question, I think you could easily generate AVDD from DVDD through a simple RC filter (or ferrite-bead, depending on the frequencies involved) as the analog current tends to pretty low. This will prevent digital noise from jumping onto the analog supply rails, and I think this chip has internal voltage references, so this AVDD is only really used to run the muxes and such. As for the GNDs, that's up to you -- if this part's located in the analog part of your board away from large switching currents / noise, tie 'em together and you'll likely be fine. If it's located right next to say a switching power supply, probably in your best interest to run AGND to the single-point GND on your board."

AskElectronics,3dchny,Eisenstein,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:52:44 2015 UTC,"It is basic electromagnetism.  Imagine an electromagnet; you input current into a coil and it creates a magnetic field.  Now, since current created the field, then isn't it logical that the magnetic field would be able to create current?  I'll answer for you: it does.  This magnetic field is called 'induction', and is the primary way that boost converters 'amplify' (your word) voltage.  Basically, a circuit is created which charges a magnetic field through an inductor, then releases that field which turns it back into power.  Think of it like a spring.  The magnetic field is the spring coil, and the energy that the coil creates when released is power.  There is of course much more to this than I explained, but I have tried to simplify it as much as possible."

AskElectronics,3db1fn,youcallthatdriving,2,Wed Jul 15 00:09:47 2015 UTC,"Not all USB ports can provide the amperage you need.  You might want to measure the amps on the input, I doubt you have 10v and 400mA powering the charge controller if its output is 8.4v 400mA.  Could be lower due to the step-down, or could be higher due to efficiency concerns.  Let's say you need 10v and 500mA, just to make the math easy.  That's 5 watts.  To achieve that from a step-up of a 5v USB source, your USB port will have to be putting out slightly more than one amp.  (5v * 1A / 100% efficiency = 5 watts)    So say your step-up converter is 85% efficient. (I have no idea what is typical for a boost converter, I am just showing the math.)  To produce 10v at 500mA (5w), your USB port must be able to drive a continuous 5w / 0.85 = 5.88w, divided by 5v is about 1.18 amps.  That would probably work fine on USB ports that are designed to be able to do things like charge phones.  But if you actually need 600mA on the 10v, your USB needs to push 1.41 amps which is starting to push your luck.  So best to check with a meter!

It seems like you're not too far off on the synchronizing piece. The MCU samples the grid waveform and then generates the pwm to match the inverter stage output to the grid. They have a pretty beefy MCU on that design too, so the Mega2560 might not cut it."
AskElectronics,3d8w8q,M4dEngineer,3,Tue Jul 14 13:34:33 2015 UTC,"I was looking for a grid connected circuit design, which I can make one and learn about it. However it seems that I cannot find one. I have a 24V acid battery bank to work with.   Have you done any from-scratch switching converter designs before? If not, I would strongly recommend you start with a smaller project like a basic low-voltage buck converter using a microcontroller first. There are a lot of hidden complexities in designing mixed-signal switching regulators, from stability issues and compensation to failure modes and edge cases. These are all issues you should be mastering with safe, low-power circuits first, before you even consider doing anything with high voltages or grid-tie circuits.  When working with a low-power circuit, making a mistake usually means a few blown components at worst. With a grid-tie, high-voltage circuit, a single mistake can mean fire or death. High voltage circuits are no joke, and it takes a different set of equipment and skills to even begin to measure and debug them without risking serious injury or death. High-voltage design also comes with a whole new set of design requirements and safety practices that you need to master before you design your own high-voltage circuits.   I understand that I need to use a PLL algorithm (maybe something else) so I need a microcontroller. I happen to have a Arduino Mega 2560, so would it be viable to it or do I need a better hardware?   There's actually a lot of DSP work that goes in to such a design. An Arduino is a good introductory microcontroller, but there are much better parts for power supply design. TI has a good range of microcontrollers with a lot of DSP functionality and more precise timing and comparator functions, which are very helpful when it comes to power supply design.  However, picking a proper microcontroller is only a small fraction of the design here. Interfacing the microcontroller with the high-voltage sensing and switching components in a safe and accurate manner across appropriate isolation barriers is a serious undertaking, for example.    Also I have something else in mind; can synchronising be done with something like sampling the peaks of the grid signal, calculating the frequency, waveform of the grid and generate the PWM signal with code? Or is it nonsense?   You are correct that some sort of PLL will be necessary for synchronization. Generally, it's much easier to trigger off of zero crossings than it is to attempt peak detection, especially when AC power systems are exposed to cheap switching converters without power factor correction that start to mangle the AC voltage peaks.  However, the PLL is only a tiny fraction of the design challenges here. To start with: What exactly are you going going to PWM? You obviously can't just switch your 24V battery in to the high voltage mains signal here. One strategy is to start with a high-voltage DC/DC switching regulator to step your 24V voltage up to an intermediate voltage higher than the AC mains voltage, such as 300-400VDC. A second stage is then used to invert the high-voltage intermediate DC rail to the mains AC voltage. Still, you don't want to just PWM directly in to the AC grid. You'll need to have some sort of LC filter on the output to smooth out the pulses a bit and keep those sharp switching transients from getting in to the grid.  Here's a brief article I found that goes over the TI micro inverter reference kit control loops in very brief detail: http://www.ecnmag.com/articles/2014/05/solar-micro-inverter-design-ease-using-mcus That should give you an idea of the DSP challenges you'd be up against.  So while this would be an interesting project, it's something I would definitely discourage anyone who isn't already very familiar with high-voltage switching regulators from attempting. With most hobby projects the biggest risk is blowing a few low-dollar components. With something like this, you're risking death due to the voltages involved.  However, building a microcontroller-controlled low-voltage buck regulator would be a great way to get started in learning about all of this."

For the receive you'll want a fast transimpedance amplifier with appropriate biasing on the pin diode.  For the transmit you can really just drive a small LED with a paralleled up set of AHC-series inverters.  Be sure to use a low-DC encoding so you can high-pass filter the receive path.

AskElectronics,3d6mou,scubascratch,2,Tue Jul 14 00:04:47 2015 UTC,"They will work. You actually need zigbee, because you have a bunch of transmitters and one receiver.   Actually any digital short range RF will work (wifi, Bluetooth, BTLE, zigbee/802.15.4), but the first 3 of those are in bands you want to avoid (2.4, 5Ghz on wifi, 2.4ghz for BT and BTLE)  Zigbee as you said can be 2.4G or 900mhz which is a better uncongested band for you.  You could try and get it done with cheaper analog 433mhz radios, but you have a large uphill climb in terms of making multiple transmitters and one receiver work. It's hard. Each transmitter needs to do multiple sends and randomized timing, or they need to get a lot more complex and become two-way, it's a ton of work and haven't even talked about data modulation schemes yet.   So I'd stay away from analog RF because to much wheel reinventing needed. You will spend a month and be 10% of the way to recreating zigbee.

I know it sounds like a lot to get these (I don't know why 915 MHz zigbee is so much more than 2.4Ghz zigbee) but it sounds like you have accelerometer data in juggling balls. Accelerometers usually produce 16 bit data per channel (3 channels). So 48 bits per sample. You probably need to sample it several times a second. Maybe 10, which is not much for any accelerometer. So 480 bits per second per ball. Times 10. Total channel data rate 4800 bps, not counting any data framing or addressing or FEC. All that will double your actual data size, so around 9600 bps.  This is easy stuff for zigbee. Very hard for analog.  It sounds like a very cool project maybe atmel will give you a break or enough samples."

AskElectronics,3d6mou,scubascratch,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:37:00 2015 UTC,"Actually he's incorrect zigbee on 2.4 is DSSS (that's in the 803.15.4 PHY spec, if you don't believe me and can't find it say so I will link it)  Wifi is DSSS. They will interfere if the zigbee isn't moved to a quieter channel.  Zigbee does have Frequency Agility  as a mitigation, which is a fancy way of saying ""if a channel becomes noisy, find a new one and tell each device to change to new channel"". It's not magic and it still requires there be a quiet channel to move too. There has to be an app making this happen or a zigbee network controller.  In a conference you will have these sources: Host provided wifi, probably coordinated on channels 1,6,11. These channels will be 100% saturated with DSSS. Because wifi channels are 20-40 MHz wide, the DSSS will have significant noise in the adjacent channels.  Besides host wifi, you will have other random hot spots from attendees. These will be phones and tablets and they will be on every other possible channel, doing DSSS and their own Frequency Agility and Channel Assesments and they will have filled up 2-5,7-10.  Zigbee actually has 2 channels way at the top which supposedly don't overlap, but wifi-802.11n has double wide channels so I think the top zigbee channels are not quite quiet.  Also Bluetooth which is FHSS will not directly block the zigbee, because BT is doing the same kind of channel jumping to avoid wifi (but jumping way faster than the zigbee FA method) So BT may make noise in the same top channel slots anyway. But I don't think BT is actually a major concern."

It was fine. Our proffessor new we were using that frequency and suggested trying different frequencies when we had noise problems. Not the first ones to do it either. They use the same SDRs for the communications systems lab in the EE department every year and they use similar frequency bands as well. We were told that this range was available to us. Looking at the FCC website I can see how an argument can be made to justify that we fall into the right category since we are using it for Academic research.

The 1702 has very low quiescent (standby) current and it let me use an ultra low power, 5V-only, opamp For the light sensor I chose a cheapo, sub-$1, cadmium sulfide LDR.  Its dark-resistance is half a megohm which minimizes power in the lights out state, which is 99.5% of the time in my application For the opamp (comparator) I chose the Touchstone TS1005.  It's super low current and can tolerate huge delta-Vin so you can operate it as a comparator The TS1005 enables/disables a 2 second timer made of a CD4541 CMOS programmable timer.  Be sure to get a recent production model, after Y2009; it's been redesigned so the power-on-reset function does NOT consume hundreds of microamps (the original RCA 4541s were wasteful this way and their datasheets warned you of it) CD4541 drives a Pchannel MOSFET (TP0606) which powers-up the actual LED driver itself, which is an intersil 7555   I've got it on the breadbord right now and am debugging the design one block at a time.

Induction motors have an optimum speed, and have lower torque and efficiency at low speeds - so if the motor is slightly undersized for a job, it'll never reach the optimum speed, it'll spin a lot slower and be a lot less efficient. edit: especially if it's optimum speed is higher as it appears to be.  Here's the torque curve:  http://www.ibiblio.org/kuphaldt/electricCircuits/AC/02473.png  Basically you got a motor that is producing 1.5x less mechanical power at motor's optimum speed (right of the peak on the graph, probably not as far to the right of the peak as on that image). That is not enough to spin the fan at motor's optimum speed, so motor spins slower, with larger ""slip"". But spinning too much slower, it is far less efficient and outputs even less mechanical power, so it can't rotate your fan at that speed either... and so on and so forth until a fairly low speed - well left of the peak on the graph.  With the old capacitor you have more power going through the second winding, which isn't good. If you are using new capacitor, you have more heat getting generated due to inefficiency of a mechanically overloaded induction motor, which isn't good.  Just get the repair guy to replace it with a correct sized motor. He did a crappy job. You can't replace an induction motor with one that's 1.5x less powerful, in a well designed appliance."

The old capacitor is a motor run capacitor, it's designed to limit the current a motor uses at start-up, it is permanently part of the circuit. Used on motors with only one winding.  The problem is cheaper appliances use start capacitors as run capacitors. They work for a while because of their self healing capabilities, but they're not designed for continuous current and will eventually burn out.

I am unaware of any op-amps that have built-in switching power supply or capacitor pump to generate negative voltages (probably because these techniques would introduce a fair bit of noise when placed so close to, or on the same die as the amplifier).  You can do a lot by manipulating the reference point, but supplying a lot of current won't be one of them (why there's a 7905 instead of just using two 7805s in series, with the output 'ground' in between the two).  Consider using either two (sets of) batteries or a split power-supply to provide the negative and positive supplies."
AskElectronics,3d5jei,MATlad,2,Mon Jul 13 18:58:20 2015 UTC,"Yes it's  possible. You need to build an oscillator and a charge pump, something along these lines (referring page)  Here's how it works: the first capacitor in the charge pump is charged via the first diode in the first half cycle, and discharged through the second diode charging the second capacitor in the second half cycle. So the larger the first capacitor, and the higher the frequency, the higher the current you can get before the output voltage drops by too much.  Do note that the output current is usually quite limited."

Are you still able to choose the reference potential? If so, go with the virtual ground using a voltage divider (Vcc/2) and an opamp as buffer. Some ten milliamps should be possible with this, depending on the type of your opamp. If you're dealing with AC only, add an LC lowpass and you'll be able to get several hundred milliamps out of it, depending on the frequencies and acceptable ripple. Do you need to use ground as your reference but only need a small (<5mA) current from the negative supply? Use the charge pump. Either build an oscillator with an opamp or simply use a 555. Do you need to use ground as reference and/or need more than a few mA? Use a proper switching mode regulator in inverting configuration; you probably won't get more than a few milliamps out of a simple charge pump."

AskElectronics,3d5jei,frothysasquatch,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:46:35 2015 UTC,"To get a negative voltage from a positive and ground you need to set a reference to something. The simplest way is to just halve the input DC voltage and set it at that.  Basically you use a voltage divider circuit (2 resistors) and with the use of a voltage follower opamp make the halved output invariable of loads from virtual ground. if no opamp is used loaded reference voltage will drop / sway. But because the output of opamp can only handle really low currents (~25mAmps or so on average i belive) and might not be enough to drive the opamps and other circuitry directly you need to add a push/pull stage so the higher currents are handled there. Afterwards you basically have a virtual ground, a positive rail at 1/2+ Vcc and a negative rail at -1/2Vcc (slightly less due to push/pull stage but usually close enough). You use virtual ground as you would a standard ground. Your old ground is your negative voltage. your Vcc is now your positive voltage.

The circuit is the classical approach of using an integrator followed by a comparator -- which provides feedback to the integrator.  The problem is that the connection between the output of the 2nd OP-amp and the inverting input of that same op-amp should not be there.

In general, you employ a common-mode filter to remove whatever conducted disturbance that your device puts out on the grid. You really don't care about the value of the inductance, because its a kind of trial-and-error. You care about whether or not your device is within the limits."

AskElectronics,3d5n6w,TreeDensity,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:41:11 2015 UTC,"Transistors have a certain current gain, typically around 100 for small general purpose transistors. If you want 100 mA to flow through the emitter/collector junction, the current through the base pin needs to be 1 mA. Actually a bit more because you want to 'saturate' the transistor and not have it 'half turned on' so it doesn't overheat.  The resistance of the LDR is too high to sink 1mA, especially since it forms a voltage divider with the 100k resistor and potentiometer to +12V.  I haven't run the numbers, but if we assume that the resistance of the LDR is such that it'll flow 0.1 mA, then a transistor would only be able to flow 10 mA max. That's not enough to power the LEDs, but it is enough to turn on a second transistor, which could then power the LEDs.  That problem would be fixable by using an NPN transistor on the ground side of the LEDs. But the base current would still be too weak. So the proper solution is to use a pair of transistors. The LDR turns on an NPN transistor and the NPN turns on a PNP transistor that powers the LEDs.  The other problem with the one transistor circuit (aside from the base current) is that it would operate in reverse. The LEDs would be on when the LDR sees light, and they would be off when it's dark."

The questions that you are asking are very basic, and people on electronics forums get nervous when people out of the blue ask out-of-context questions about mains-connected circuits when they don't show a lot of understanding about the circuit design or safety issues.  Doubly so if you are looking to mass produce this which suggests that this is a product you intend to sell to the  public.  /u/bradn's reply below gives the basic rundown of tradeoffs.  Throwing switching supplies into the mix these would be used if you need the highest power density or highest efficiency (least heat dissipation).  The tradeoff is more up front design is involved and it may require more components which makes manufacturing more involved.  There are a lot of tradeoffs though depending on the particulars of what you're trying to do and an off-the-shelf power supply is an excellent choice in many situations as long as you choose the right one because a lot of design and manufacturing knowledge is baked into it.  You do lose some level of control over things like specs, form factor, and quality control."

Just a thought, but if for your shutter you are trying to go forwards and then back, what if   instead you attach a disc, cut a small hole or slot and and spin it 360 degrees in one direction for each use. Then you're only ramping up and down the speed before and after the shutter is actually open, so acceleration doesn't really matter, just max speed of the motor and physical size of the hole."

I'm also wondering if I can avoid that when scanning the matrix for key presses without adding diodes or otherwise modifying it.   Diodes are the only fix unless your inputs can discern the contact resistance through which the signal is going (going through 1 contact vs 3 in the ""four corners"" problem).  I suspect handling this for more and more keys being pressed becomes impossible after a while.  So really the best fix is diodes.  You can get a bag of 100 on ebay for damn cheap."

Get one of the larger sizes (or at least large enough that you're comfortable) and I would recommend using solder paste instead of wire style solder.  The solder paste has the bonuses of holding the part until one end is soldered, reducing the problem of the part not being positioned right after soldering one end, and also means you don't have to use a hand to hold the solder as you work, leaving one free to hold the part down with something if needed.  One tip to watch out for, is try not to get much solder paste under the part - it can be possible for conductivity to occur that way."

They are limited to what package sizes they can use also and small surface mount packages can only dissipate so much heat and the pins so much current.  Also each mosfet adds a series resistance, parallel 2 of the same and you halve that resistance making more voltage available for the load, increasing efficiency and reducing heat. Put 10A through a 10mΩ mosfet you dissipate 1W lost as heat (I2 R), put a second mosfet in parallel and each now has 5A and losses in each is 0.25W and total of 0.5W.

It supplied two other voltages, −5 V and −12 V, but with limited amounts of power. Most microchips of the time operated on 5 V power. Of the 63.5 watts these PSUs could deliver, most of it was on this +5 V rail.  The +12 V supply was used primarily to operate motors such as in disk drives and cooling fans. As more peripherals were added, more power was delivered on the 12 V rail. However, since most of the power is consumed by chips, the 5 V rail still delivered most of the power.

You can use any current greater than the load's requirement (although a fuse might be advisable sometimes).

Now, tell me how much current flows when I have a 24V, 1000A supply connected to a 24 ohm resistor...  V = IR I = V/R = 24 / 24 = ?

Resistors don't really care about voltage or current, they simply establish a linear relationship between the two - hence ohm's law. Of course, too much power will burn them but that's too advanced for discussions at such a basic level.  Most devices that we're familiar with are constant voltage devices - they want a fixed voltage, and take as much or as little current as they need. The supply must provide the correct voltage and sufficient current.  However, LEDs are constant current devices - they want a specific current, and will take as much or as little voltage as they need.  This is why we must use resistors on small leds, however with high power LEDs this would be far to inefficient so instead they use constant current supplies, where the pattern reverses - you must get the right current, and the voltage should be same or higher.  There's ample literature that google could have found for you on the topic, had you bothered to spend 3 seconds searching before lashing out, like this which lists a number of reasons that driving LEDs with constant voltage is a bad idea.  edit: ironically, the sidebar lists ""why does a LED need a resistor?"" as an example question..."

I'd consider that a criminally negligent product design.   Why? The supply is constant current and thus delivers exactly what the LEDs want in a perfectly controlled fashion.  The only way anything bad would happen is if some inexperienced person decided that constant current and constant voltage supplies were interchangeable... Then you might get thermal runaway, causing the leds to burn :P  If you're curious about constant current electronics, many old-school high voltage generators are actually constant current generators, such as the Wimshurst machine and Van De Graff generator - the voltage simply rises until leakage current equals ""supply"" current, or there's a spark that discharges all the parasitic capacitance"

I haven't done a survey, but every one I've ever seen was (or at least aspired to be - many older ones are of course just transformers with a rectifier).

OP doesn't know, and hasn't provided any pictures of the plugpack in question.  I wouldn't be at all surprised to see a LED supply with standard barrel jack, as I'm quite sure most manufacturers would love you to burn it by plugging the wrong pack in - their warranty doesn't cover it, and you'll likely buy another one.  Furthermore, most plugpacks are 5-12v, not enough to light up the LEDs at all. Laptops are getting up to 21v these days and I've seen a few at 24v for fake-POE network equipment, but near none above that - so most of the time, plugging in compatibly-sized plugs would do precisely nothing.

If there's current, there's a voltage driving that current. Most grounds, though, are designed to have very low voltage drops (implies very low resistance) throughout. However, any time current needs to complete a loop through ground there must be some voltage drop, however tiny it might be.   Why doesn't anything else act like ground?    Ground is just a reference point. We need it so that we can all agree on the voltages at other points in the circuit. You can make a circuit and call the positive battery terminal ground (0V). Now the rest of the circuit is negative. You would typically designate the other battery terminal -Vcc in this case.  If you wanted to connect this negative-operating circuit to something else, you would connect the positive side (your ground) to the other circuit's ground.   You can also have three ""rails"": ground, +Vcc, and -Vcc (using two batteries). This is pretty common."

Earth ground, chassis ground, digital ground, battery ground - they're all similar but often functionally different. The reason they get confusing is that they're not always separate in the circuit diagram.  In a car, you have battery ground (negative terminal) and chassis ground the same for many reasons.  The negative connection to the chassis helps as components aren't perfect. You wouldn't want a component to short positive to whatever it is mounted to, and allow the current to flow into another components ground, possibly destroying two or more systems. Grounding everything (engine, transmission, pretty much all rails, chassis, etc) means that whenever something fucks up, a very low resistance path to negative is created, allowing a large amount of current to flow to blow the fuse.   Also remember when working with rotating metal - AC is going to be generated. Iron likes to magnetize itself pretty easily. The driveshaft, all gears, the engine - pretty much everything induces AC in the system. Most is just instantly canceled by the frame and chassis, but not all. If everything has a path to ground, and everything is connected to ground through the negative rail, then everything can be designed to handle an AC overlay.

This is Bad, very bad!  :)    Technical terms require single narrow meanings.   ""Ground"" is a whole morass of stuff; not a very scientific term at all.  While the experts can usually figure out the intended meaning of ""ground"" from context, newbies are totally screwed.  To cut through the bs and hidden misconceptions, just avoid the word ""ground"" entirely.  Instead replace it with the appropriate narrow definition.   For example, one of these:   a connection to metal earth-stake, driven in wet dirt. your single main reference point for circuit voltage measurements (voltmeters need two points) an inside connection to conductive shielding enclosure a voltage-node for signals or power supply any ""common"" connection a connection to coax cable shield the power supply negative terminal (except when the positive terminal is the ""circuit common."")   OK, note that a coax cable's ""shield-ground"" still works fine even when it's not driven into wet, salty dirt?  Those are two conflicting meanings of ""ground.""   A coax shield is not an earth connection, and we wrongly hide them both behind the word ""ground.""   And, a common connection works fine even if it doesn't lead off to any metal-chassis ""case-ground.""  All these words mean different things, so the first order of business is to break them apart and examine the differences.   It's easy to do this if you just forbid yourself from using ""ground"" to describe anything.  (Heh, the wet salty dirt you're standing on in bare feet?  That's not ""ground,"" that's Earth.)   Re-state every question but without using the word ""ground,"" and often the questions answer themselves.     In a very simple series circuit   If you connect one part of a flashlight to an Earth-stake, what happens?   Nothing, the flashlight behaves normally, and there's no current in the connection to the earth.  However, earlier your entire flashlight might have acquired a net-charge, especially in winter when you've been holding it and scuffing around on the rug with rubber-sole shoes.    If you use a high-impedance voltmeter (like 1020 Z-inp or higher, not a DVM,) you can detect the electric charge on the flashlight by measuring its voltage with respect to an earth-stake or cold water faucet etc.  You might find that one side of the flashlight battery is 8,000Vdc, and the other side is 8,002 Vdc (a 2V battery inside.)   The whole flashlight is charged up to around 8 kilovolts.   If you leave it sitting on a plastic insulating surface, that 8KV may remain there nearly forever.   Next, touch one flashlight terminal briefly to Earth connection.  There's a tiny snap, a spark.   Now one side of the flashlight measures -2 Vdc on your special voltmeter, and the other side measures zero.  The flashlight now has the same electric charge as the Earth: almost exactly zero.  (You must have touched the positive battery terminal to Earth, so now the other terminal reads -2v.)      Whenever you're dealing with shielded low-voltage (flashlight) circuitry, you can ignore all the net-charge, high-volts, and earth-discharge effects, since it doesn't have anything to do with flashlight function.   It does become important for things like disconnected Arduino pins picking up crazy voltage signals from surrounding space, for hospital EEG EKG instruments, and for radio hams trying to avoid getting killed when working with electrically-floating longwire antennas.   Why can the ground at 0v have current flow?    Why can a metal ring have a current, even when the metal ring is sitting at 0V? ***  It's because current comes from nowhere, goes to nowhere.  That's the fundamental physics of electric circuits supposedly taught in grade school.   Only it's not.  Instead they teach a set of misconceptions: batteries as sources of ""current flow""  also the  ""conservation of current""   ""current carriers.""    All three are wrong.   It should be ""conservation of charge,"" since current can appear and vanish, and isn't conserved.  And, while charge-carriers certainly exist, there's no such thing as a ""particle of current"" or a ""current carrier.""   Also, current does not ""flow;"" the thing which flows inside wires is called Charge.   Whenever charge flows from place to place inside conductors, the electric currents appear and vanish without having to ""flow.""  Conductors are materials which contain mobile charge, and when a conductor's own charges are forced to flow along, we call it ""electric current.""   Batteries?  They're charge-pumps, sources of the pumping force, of voltage.  See:  Typical electricity misconceptions  ""Lest you think that I am quibbling over minor points of language, I note that in my experience many of the misconceptions people harbor have their origins in imprecise language...

The path for current is a closed metal ring without beginning or end.  Where did the current come from?  What's its starting point?  Well, the word ""current"" just means ""flow of charges,"" so a better question is, what made the vast amount of movable charges already inside that metal ring ...start flowing along?

AskElectronics,3cxbqs,wbeaty,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:42:29 2015 UTC,"Large inductor might have ten ohms worth of wire inside.  Say the motor runs at 12V, 1amp.   If we want the motor to start over one second, the inductor has to significantly limit the current during a half-second time constant.  Faraday law I/T=-V/L,  1/.5=12/L  so required inductance is roughly 6,000mH or higher.  Probably the real problem is that the resistance of motor windings and brushes is way below one ohm, so when you first connect it to 12V, it draws way more than twelve amps and either catches fire, or maybe the brushes get slowly destroyed over months of turn-ons.  Or maybe it just kept popping fuses until they added the resistor.   A cheap solution would be to use much thinner wire in the motor's rotor winding, so it can't draw enormous currents when stalled."

LiPo is not a type of cell, but an internal technology that a Li-ion cell may or may not have. You can't tell whether a cell uses LiPo or not by looking at it. Whether a Li-ion cell happens to use LiPo or not is inconsequential to you the user.  What you (and many others) call LiPo is actually ""pouch"", and refers to the shape of the cell. It has no bearing on the cell's chemistry.  All cells that use LiPo technology ARE Li-ion cells.   I've been looking at 18650 lithium ion cells   All 18650 cells are Li-ion cells. 18650 refers to the shape. It has no bearing on the cell's chemistry.  Li-ion includes some 7 common chemistries, plus less common ones. They include:   LiCo (Cobalt): the ones used in laptops, 3.6 V LiFePO4 (Iron Phosphate): the ones used in power tools, very safe, 3.3 V NMC (Manganese): better chemistry that matches LiCo but nearly as safe as LiFePO4, 3.7 V   Each of these can be found in all the formats: pouch, small or large cylindrical, small or large prismatic.  All of these may use a LiPo separator, and whether or not it does you can't really tell and it makes no difference to you."

AskElectronics,3cx848,1Davide,3,Sat Jul 11 18:14:15 2015 UTC,"If you take only one thing from these responses, let it be this:  The battery MUST have a Battery Management System inside it, permanently connected to each and every cell, to measure its voltage and prevent over voltage and under voltage. The BMS MUST include an electronic switch that the BMS can turn off to cut off the battery current. If the BMS doesn't already include such a switch, you MUST add one yourself, and the BMS MUST be able to turn it off if it needs to to protect each and every cell in the battery.

The charge will last only 20 minutes or so Their life will be short   Yes, some vendors rate cells at 5 C. (Note I said vendors, not manufacturers. C-rating is more of a marketing thing than an engineering thing.). And, yes, some cells can deliver 5 C continuously, but most don't last long under those conditions.  Keep the current under 1 C (in your case, 22 Ah) for longest life. For 26650 cells, that's about 15 cells in parallel."
AskElectronics,3cx848,1Davide,2,Sat Jul 11 18:17:49 2015 UTC,"The radio draws up to about 22A @ 13.8V when transmitting (1A receiving) plus the Raspberry Pi and other accessories will likely draw a couple more amps.   Those numbers are great to have, but you need to consider one more thing: How long do you want this to work on a single charge? Or more accurately - how many watt-hours do you need?   I'm familiar with LiPos from RC aircraft but I know storing them fully charged can kill them,   You can charge them to something like 3.8 V, and they will be fine to store. But they will not be charged much more than half.  Or you can compromise, and charge to 4.0 V or 4.1 V. The stored energy won't be far from a full charge, but the cells can be stored with less damage, and they can take more charge cycles before they are worn out.   I've been looking at 18650 lithium ion cells because they seem like the standard li-ion cell these days (even Teslas use them). I'd probably be looking at a 4S4P configuration (± 1P).   Generally, an 18650 can only take 1.5-2C discharge. So with 2500 Ah cells, 4 in parallel, you shouldn't draw more than 15 A. You can look for some with higher discharge rate, or put more in parallel.   Any recommendations for a charging board for this size pack? Does it need to be a balancing charger?   I can't recommend a product, but yes, it must be balancing.   I've read that when putting these cells in series or parallel (can't remember which) you need to be careful about matching their capacities   That's in series. But you are doing both, so you should do it in any case. I would simply use one type of cell. All cells has same brand, same product name, same variety, same capacity.   to prevent one cell from increasing the voltages of the others.    That's in parallel, and it's the voltage that must match. Use a multimeter to check that the difference is max 0.1V.   Do I need any special circuit to handle charging while its powering the radio?    For a simple solution, no. The battery will just charge slower if you are using power from it.   Ideally I could charge and operate from 120VAC alone but it's unlikely I can fit a 22A power supply in the case. Could I include, say, a 5A supply that charges the battery while I'm using it?    Yes. But some chargers may be too smart, and think that something is wrong, and stop charging."

If you are using a bolt on terminal be sure to get a spring washer or belleville washer that is tension rated appropriately for the manufacturers specified torque on the battery. You are planning on traveling with the battery pack which means it will be exposed to vibration. Vibrations can cause connections to loosen, poor connections increase resistance, increased resistance causes heating at the connection point (which causes the metal to expand and contract during heating a cooling cycles worsening the problem) and fire will ensue....Just ask Boeing.

AskElectronics,3cvqrq,MrSurly,3,Sat Jul 11 04:27:26 2015 UTC,"Yes,the ""casing"" is functional ferrite; you've damaged the magnetic circuit, which reduces the inductance slightly, and more importantly reduces the saturation current, but it looks like there's still enough there to function if the design has margin; the part through the middle of the coil is usually the bottleneck.  Anyway, 330 is indeed 33µH.   The DC resistance is pretty much determined by other parameters and the physical size, but it's the saturation current that's critical.  That must be more than the peak output current, or things will go very wrong.  What I can't tell is the size and solder land pattern.  Is it 10x10mm like this, or 12.56x12.5 mm like this?  Central Technologies is a discount manufacturer of common magnetic parts.  I use their catalogue a lot for picking components that will have multiple sources.

AskElectronics,3cuol4,Amadameus,3,Sat Jul 11 15:54:31 2015 UTC,"So if you want to use a Suntactics SCharger-8 as your solar power input that's cool. I have little to say on solar, but I like the laminated fiber sheets the panels are wrapped in - they look durable and the rivets would be easy to hang.  But I notice the specs on that sCharger includes no battery life whatsoever.  You want this to be a hang-it-out-all-day system? You need a storage system to handle power while not under load. That means batteries, which are definitely my thing.  A lot of the devices that might load this system (phones, tablets) would only need 5v from USB, correct? Think of 5v battery backup systems as nicely-wrapped partner device to the solar panel!  I've been a fan of Monoprice products lately and have several of their models. If you want to keep a car charged you'll need a 12v converter, as their products are 5v only.  The Model 11927 is $32.00 for 13,000mAh of capacity. That's more than enough to handle a phone and tablet overnight, and it costs ~406 mAh per dollar.  The Model 10577 is $18.00 and holds 5200mAh of capacity. It costs ~289 mAh per dollar, which is not as much as the larger unit, but the 10577 also doubles as a nice flashlight.

Some problems I forsee:  Infrared laser strength must be low enough to be safe for someone to look at. LEDS are safer. Visible lasers or LEDs are even better because of the blink reflex, but could be annoying.   One touch can cast a shadow over other touches. You need an array of multiplexed lasers to avoid this. Each laser takes its turn from a different angle, hopefully avoiding shadows. This increases the time needed to sense touch.   The lasers will be a few mm away from the LCD. If your finger approaches the LCD at an angle, it will be detected at a slightly incorrect location. If accuracy is important, you need to bring your finger in perpendicular to the LCD.   Knuckles, palms, bracelets and sleeves can come close enough to be sensed as a touch.   The alignment of the lasers and sensors is critical, and will change if the monitor is twisted by someone putting their hand on the bezel. A rigid table mount might mitigate that.

AskElectronics,3ctjn8,Construct,5,Sat Jul 11 03:34:19 2015 UTC,"The phrase you're looking for is ""undervoltage lockout"".  A basic undervoltage lockout circuit will have a regulated voltage reference, a high-value resistor divider to reduce the battery voltage down to the vicinity of the voltage reference, and a comparator to compare the two. When the divided battery voltage is greater than the reference voltage, enable the output switch. When the divided battery voltage is less than the reference voltage, disable the output switch.  There are two big catches here: First, you absolutely need hysteresis in the comparator circuit that keeps the switch turned off until the battery is recharged. Otherwise, the battery voltage will rebound as soon as your load is disconnected, and the circuit will turn on again, which will then drag the voltage back down and turn the circuit off, which will cause a voltage rebound, etc. Tune the hysteresis such that oscillation does not happen.  Second, you should pay attention to the parasitic current draw of the undervoltage lockout circuit. This probably doesn't matter as much in your scenario, as you're recharging the battery every day and the battery is relatively large, but generally speaking you don't want the undervoltage lockout circuit to be significantly draining your battery as this defeats the purpose. This means you need to choose high-value resistors for your divider (mind your comparator input currents) and keep the other circuitry very power efficient. This also means you need to be smart about the output switch you use. Look for something solid-state, because a relay is going to drain your battery in one of the two positions unless you use a latching relay."

Set up voltage dividers on the 5v regulator output to get 1/5 of the set points, which ought to be (maybe?) 11v and 13v.  Attach the outputs of the comparators to /pre and /clr on the flipflop.  Attach the output of the flipflop to the gate of the mosfet, and the source of the mosfet to ground, and the load between battery + and the drain of the mosfet.

How about a single comparator+reference with push/pull output driving a FET that switches the main load?  You can do either, but low-side switching with an N-channel FET is easier, as most comparator+reference chips have the reference on the inverting input.  You just need three resistors: a voltage divider of the input voltage, plus a hysteresis resistor from the output, all feeding the non-inverting input.  When the input is above the reference, the output is high, the FET is on, and the lights are on.  When the battery voltage drops too low, the output switches off and you only have the comparator Iq plus the resistor divider current as load."

AskElectronics,3ctcuq,cyandyedeyecandy,9,Fri Jul 10 16:47:02 2015 UTC,"Can you be more specific about how you want to use DisplayPort?  Hands-down, the easiest way to use DisplayPort is to start with an SBC that has a DisplayPort output. The ODROID-XU3 is a good example. It uses a Samsung Exynos5422 chip that has a native DisplayPort output.  Implementing your own PCB around an SoC with native Displayport support is a very technical challenge, due to the complexity of the chips and boards (small-pitch BGA, high speed traces, strict timing constraints, 6-8 layer boards, etc).  If you want to design and implement a DisplayPort source by yourself, you're in for a much larger challenge. DisplayPort is a very high speed interface. Even the slowest DisplayPort speeds are still in the gigabit range, which requires careful design and implementation just to maintain signal integrity. Actually generating a custom high-speed signal like that is in the realm of high-performance FPGAs. A quick internet search didn't show any open-source DisplayPort source IP, so you'd either need to license IP from a vendor or design your own from scratch, which is a very serious undertaking.  If you'd like to get started in this area, I'd recommend picking up an affordable FPGA development board and getting started with something simple like VGA output first.  VESA has a light presentation that introduces some of the concepts behind the DisplayPort spec: http://www.vesa.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ICCE-Presentation-on-VESA-DisplayPort.pdf  VESA doesn't release new, full DisplayPort standards to non-members, unfortunately, but they do still host the old standard behind a registration wall: https://fs16.formsite.com/VESA/form608559305/secure_index.html"

I thought building a DP->VGA DAC would be a cool project to learn more about high-speed digital and analog electronics. An FPGA would be a necessity, I assume? (never used these before, but am willing to learn)   To answer your question: A custom displayport interface is theoretically within the realm of a very hardcore and dedicated hobbyist, but this would be a major, major undertaking. Even more so if you didn't already have access to serious lab gear and didn't have a background in high-speed digital and RF design.  FPGA is a necessity for any sort of custom high-speed signaling application. Like I said, Displayport has a link rate of around ~1.5Gbps at the very lowest speed, and it only goes up from there.  A simple composite out or VGA out is a great place to start, because it's well within the range of projects you can assemble, implement, and debug yourself without having access to crazy expensive lab gear.

They listened to the effect each circuit had when a guitar was played through it.  Most circuits produced undesirable effects and were discarded.  But a few of the circuits/effects were pleasing, or surprising, or hair-raising, and they got manufactured and sold and played by top musicians.  Some of these tinkerers were EEs who were intimately familiar with Fourier analysis and (germanium transistor) circuit design and pole-zero diagrams, to be sure.  Others were just lets-try-some-things experimentalists.  If you read the patent (US 3,530,224) on the Wah-Wah pedal, you'll conclude that its developer was a real EE who understood the frequency domain intimately.  He came up with a theory ""X would sound cool"" and then methodically set out to build X.  As luck would have it, X (= Wah-Wah) did sound cool.  On the other hand, if you peruse the schematics of some classic effects pedals, you'll see that quite a few are a dog's breakfast of random nonlinearities, randomly applied.  But they happen to produce desirable effects so they have survived.

Now, this is completely unreasonable in most cases but you can try just looking at a little bit of the board.  Start by looking at the circuit board and following the traces from the power connector. For example, usually you'll have power from the jack going through some protection circuitry and then into a voltage regulator (or multiple regulators). Usually these are in the form of either a controller IC with an external inductor and diode, or just a complete module. If you're able to read off the part numbers of the voltage regulators you might be able to find its datasheet which outlines its operating limits. Alternately, try to find some data on the protection circuitry (good designs should have some sort of over voltage clamp). If there's a 12V protection diode then that tells you that the supply input shouldn't be over 12V.  There isn't a foolproof way to do it."

HERE is a schematic that shows one set of resistor values.  In my opinion, this circuit meets all of your design goals.  I simulated the circuit using the free simulator LTSPICE.  Simulation Results part 1 shows what happens when you slooooowly turn up the battery voltage from 9.0 volts to 14.0 volts.  Battery voltage is plotted in the top panel (green) AND it is marked off on the horizontal axis at the bottom of the figure.  Panel #2 shows the current in the LED.  Your datasheet says that it can take a maximum of 10 milliamps so my resistor choices squirt about 9mA through the LED.  The LED switches from ON to OFF when the battery voltage rises above ~11.6 volts.  {Equivalently, the LED shitches from OFF to ON when the battery voltage falls below ~11.6 volts.}  Panels #3 and 4 show the power dissipation in the two zener diodes.  It remains below 70 milliwatts and 250 milliwatts respectively.  So your choice of 500mW rated zeners, looks pretty safe.  Simulation Results part 2 has the same panels 1 and 2.  But panels 3 and 4 show the power dissipated in the resistors.  It is below 200mW and 100mW respectively.  This might be just a wee bit aggressive if you use 1/4 watt (250mW) resistors, so you could either monkey with the resistor values some more, or else just replace R1 with two 250mW resistors in series: 300 ohms + 270 ohms."

AskElectronics,3cp7g1,Lashway,2,Thu Jul 9 19:03:00 2015 UTC,"It depends on the wording. If the datasheet says it ""recommends"" it then you can probably get away with it. If the datasheet says it's ""required"" then you can't.  In general it's worth paying the five bucks to buy a supply of a few hundred 100nF caps to put on the power pins of every chip you ever use in the future.  The datasheet in this case says:   To minimize power-supply ripple due to the peak digit driver currents, connect a 10μF electrolytic and a 0.1μF ceramic capacitor between V+ and GND as close to the device as possible.   It's told you why you need them, it's to make the power supply a bit happier. Segment display driving will involve a lot of instantaneous low-high transitions (0-V+) as you turn the LEDs on and off. The application notes omit the 10uF, but not the 0.1uF which gives you a clue as to which you can ignore.  It will almost certainly work without the decoupling, but you might save yourself a lot of headscratching later if you put that cap in."
AskElectronics,3cp7g1,Mrfazzles,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:24:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the detailed answer. When they say to put the caps between Vcc and Gnd, do they literally mean jump the two pins with the caps? Also, serial or parallel?"
AskElectronics,3cp7g1,slackchameleon,2,Thu Jul 9 19:05:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, jump from Vcc straight to ground, as close to the pins as possible.    It's acting as a sort of voltage regulator; protecting the chip from spikes in voltage by skimming the excess off the top and storing it to later compensate for dips in voltage, providing the chip with a nearly constant source of energy.    It's possible (maybe probable) that your device will never need it, but caps are so cheap and the problems it causes so unpredictable that I've been taught to just put them on anything and everything that I want to work."
AskElectronics,3cp7g1,Aplejax04,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:01:40 2015 UTC,Parallel - The caps are just there for smoothing to reduce spikes in the voltage. Think of them like the electrical equivalent of road suspension.

One thing to try is hooking up an oscilloscope to the V+ pin while you're driving the display and seeing what happens with/without the cap(s) connected.  With regard to serial vs parallel - it's parallel because each capacitor deals with different frequency noise on the supply."
AskElectronics,3cp7g1,NoradIV,2,Thu Jul 9 21:40:26 2015 UTC,Yes you do. You cannot have too many decoupling capacitors. The more the marrier. Basically you are increasing the RC time constant of the supply rail to prevent spikes or droops in the supply voltage.

Ic is about 0.07A so you ought to set Ib to about 0.007A.  Sometimes your so-called ""3.3 volt"" Raspberry PI GPIO pins are only going to deliver 3.0 volts.  Thus Ib = (3.0 - 0.7)/Rb.  Solving for Rb, we get 328.5 ohms.  Round to the nearest standard resistor value, 330 ohms.  I suggest you purchase a bag of 100 pieces of 2N3904; this should cost USD 5.00 or less.  Then try two or three of them in your circuit; typically their beta value in real life (not the datasheet) is closer to 250 than to 48.  The circuit design is a lot simpler if you use a logic-level-gate-threshold Nchannel MOSFET like a 2N7000 or BS170.  These require no base resistor at all."

Another thing, what is the actual difference between using a transistor as a switch, and considering a momentary value of an oscillating signal going into the base? Does it have something to do with field propagation?  Even though the Pi sometimes deliver only 3.0V, isn't is more conservative, and thus safer to say that it will deliver 3.3V? That gives 371 Ohms. Not that much greater - I may use this value, to be safe;)  Yeah, I've been looking into using MOSFETS as well, but for now, I'm just using which ever components I already have.  Cheers!"

AskElectronics,3cohwf,Holy_City,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:22:51 2015 UTC,"Alright simple circuit analysis problem here.   We have a resistor and diode in series. The voltage drop across the diode is fixed, call it Vd. The supply voltage, Vs, is fixed. What's the current through the loop?   We know via Kirchoff's laws that the current through the whole loop is constant. We also know the voltage drop across the resistor and diode is Vs, and the voltage drop across the diode is Vd, so the voltage across the resistor is Vs-Vd. Via Ohm's law, the current is (Vs-Vd)/R.   Now lets wire the same network in parallel. Nothing changes, but the total current drawn from the source is doubled. The current through the first network is still (Vs-Vd)/R, and it's equal to the current through the second network, therefore the total current from the supply is 2(Vs-Vd)/R.   What happens if we wired the network in series? Well Vs is the same and Vd is the same, but Vr is now halved (two resistors, two diodes). R is constant, so the current through the whole network is halved. Thus, the LEDs are dimmer.   tl;dr when you wire it in parallel, it draws twice the current. When you wire it in series it draws half the current."

You realize that with the volume at midpoint the input stages have an output impedance of 250k, right?  I don't think it will sum correctly.  Have you simulated that?

It's at 5Vpp max output right now and I could go a little bit higher than that, but not by much. The unit is designed to be powered by AA batteries which is the most important part of the design.

AskElectronics,3ckkuy,bart2019,3,Wed Jul 8 18:51:08 2015 UTC,"3.472Vpp   That equals+4dbu which, for most analog audio, is the average program level, not the peak level. +4dbu=0VU on a VU meter and is the usual level for calibrating analog paths. In broadcasting we use equipment which has headroom of at least 20db above that (+24dbu) to accommodate peaks. That requires a much higher range of 34 Vpp.   Now that we use digital audio, the average level is -20dbFS (decibels referenced to full scale).   You may be able to get by with less, it depends on what you'll be using it for.   To alert you of clipping, I would add a couple of comparators/LEDs to warn you of signals nearing maximum."

There's no way I could fit enough batteries in the enclosure to bring it up to 34Vpp.  On the other hand, the circuit is mainly going to be used as a way to record multiple mics when using a DSLR, and also providing the headphone jack which many of them lack.

AskElectronics,3cmann,Arbalezt,3,Thu Jul 9 00:40:42 2015 UTC,"DC knowledge + basic calculus = AC knowledge :)  The reason that AC is so widely used for power transmission is simply that a magnetic field has to be changing to induce a voltage on a coil of wire.  Now, there's two ways you can make a magnetic field change forever - either you can make it continuously increase in strength (impractical), or you can make it go up and down in a continuous cycle (works great).  Both inductors and capacitors associate voltage and current with the rate of change of each other - I = C.dv/dt and V=L.di/dt.  If you have a capacitor hooked to an AC line with a sine waveform, what is dv/dt (rate of change of voltage) when V=0?  When V crosses zero, its rate of change is maximum, and thus a capacitor draws maximum current at this point.  With the same setup, what happens when V is at the peak? dv/dt is zero, and the current is thus also zero.  Since current and voltage no longer have a direct proportion ala ohm's law, we need a new system to analyse this sort of thing. Luckily, complex and polar number systems fit perfectly.  In our capacitor example, we can see that the current leads the voltage by a quarter cycle - and just like engine timing, we can call this a 90° advance.  Also, the current and voltage are still related by I=C.dv/dt so we can still apply ohm's law - we just have to throw that 90° phase offset into the mix too!  Inductors are perfect opposites to capacitors - rather than current leading 90° ahead of voltage, they lag by 90°.  Now something really interesting happens when you apply P=VI. During part of the cycle, power is positive (ie flowing from mains into the capacitor), but during other parts of the cycle, power is negative (flowing from capacitor back into the mains).  If you add it all up, you find that the average power is zero!  Clearly, that 90° phase offset means that no real power is ever consumed or produced.  If we convert from polar coordinates to complex numbers, we can see that the real part (zero in this case) represents real or true power consumed, whereas the magnitude represents ""apparent"" power - the amount of power that the mains wiring must carry (even if it only carries it back and forth).  AllAboutCircuits has an excellent section on all things AC"

Later in your adventures, you will learn that there really is not such thing as other signal types.  There is AC and DC.  All other signals like square waves triangle waves etc are just multiple AC signals of varying amplitude imposed on top of each other.  AC power distribution is critical.  It allows high voltages to be transmitted down power lines then converted to lower voltages near the home using the power.  This avoids power loss related to higher currents. this is called I2 R losses.  It is much more efficient to send high voltage at low current than it is to send high current at a low voltage.  AC is further divided into small and large signal.  Large signal deals with things like power distribution.  Small signal deals with audio signals and things like that.  Large signal systems rarely need DC concepts at all, but small signal systems need knowledge of both AC and DC concepts."

AskElectronics,3cmann,cypherpunks,2,Thu Jul 9 19:16:02 2015 UTC,"Generally, you will not want to use AC for sensors and things like that, but it also depends on the type of sensor you are using.  Transducers vary widely in their design and application.  Some things work with DC, some things work with AC, some things work with square waves.  Your circuit will be limited to what you intend to use in it.  For instance, industrial position sensors called LVDTs require AC excitation.  This is because they are just transformers that have a mobile core in them.  As the core moves, the coupling between the primary and secondary windings change.  This means the position of the core can be determined by measuring the input vs output voltage.  However, since LVDTs are transformers they require AC excitation and therefore output AC proportional to the core position.  So, in order to use LVDTs, you MUST use AC somewhere in your circuit."

AskElectronics,3ckvlc,bradn,2,Wed Jul 8 18:48:20 2015 UTC,"So, it looks like you will make your own low voltage detect circuit.  The enable pin is active high on the switcher, we need to know that to get the output polarity correct.  With this in mind, I think we can use a transistor and some resistors to get things done.  Let's use an PNP BJT to detect the voltage (suggest BC556 or similar).  Make a voltage divider (maybe you want to just use a potentiometer) to give the transistor's base pin about VCC minus .65V when the battery is 3.0V (might have to tune to get it closer to exact triggering at 3.0V).  Since this divider will be powered whenever battery is connected, you probably want it at a pretty high total resistance (100K?) - at that high of a resistance you may want to add a capacitor from VCC to the base pin (10nF) to stabilize it from noise.  The transistor's emitter goes to VCC.  When the voltage is above 3.0V, the transistor turns on and pulls its collector towards VCC (VCC minus ~.3V)  The collector of the transistor should connect to the enable pin, and have a pull-down resistor (1K to 10K ohm should be fine, I'd go closer to the 10K to reduce battery drain).  Drawbacks from such a simple circuit:  There will be a little temperature dependency in what voltage the transistor wants to switch at, the output voltage (going to the enable pin) won't sharply change (it will drift through the range as the supply voltage crosses around the threshold), and there is no hysteresis so you will almost certainly have some hiccupping as the battery gets low (enable voltage starts to fall, switcher turns off, battery recovers a little, switcher turns back on, etc).  Also, with a high resistance divider feeding the transistor, you may have some part-to-part variation effects from the transistor (different transistors may need to be calibrated differently due to gain variation).  If you can live with this, it's 3 to 5 components to implement what you want, depending if you used resistors or a pot for the voltage divider, and if you use a capacitor to smooth the voltage divider output."
AskElectronics,3ckvlc,dimitrifromparis,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:25:28 2015 UTC,"The alternative would be to use a dedicated charge controller/battery protection IC, and the converter hanging off that.

A dedicated controller would refuse to discharge further without a charging cycle on between, plus it allows you to leave the charger plugged in overnight."

AskElectronics,3cicw7,Enlightenment777,4,Wed Jul 8 12:53:30 2015 UTC,"Pink or black are the usual colours for conductive foam (or at least static-dissipative).  Polyethylene (what they're usually made of) is slightly conductive--just enough that charge can be dissipated.  I believe the black stuff has carbon mixed in to increase its conductivity.  Bumping up the conductivity (on a per-volume basis) is the same reason it's usually high-density foam instead of low-density inflated, like most of the pink stuff.  I had a co-worker (who wasn't an electronics guy) who saw that I'd used foam on pin connectors and did the same for a batch of boards that he'd done up.  As you can probably guess, he just cut up the white polystyrene static-clinging foam that we had in abundance around the office, instead of the conductive stuff I'd brought in from home.  You can actually make this work, so long as you use a fresh sheet of aluminum / tin foil over top of the polystyrene foam and punch through the foil--static dissipative and cushiony.

Then I have been doing electronics for so many years I do automatically discharge myself safely I guess, once the human is grounded whatever was used for storage is not going to matter as long as it itself does not create that charge, I could see foil coated styrene worse than non foil coated if bad techniques like first contact with an IC pin as a bulk discharge could then occur to the entire sheet of foil as opposed to only being able to the actual die of the chip.  As regards failed hardware .. I did tv/vcr/audio repairs for 25 years so I have seen a LOT of failed hardware, 80% of that is caps and the symptoms of caps, about 19% of the rest is dry joints.

A mosFET gate works like a capacitor: When it is charged, the mosFET is open, when it is discharged, the mosFET closes. This means you will measure hardly any current when the gate is connected to vcc or gnd as you noticed. However, when you switch it, a small, high-current spike will be there to charge/discharge the capacitor. Charging it faster is better in principle, as you stated, but you have to make sure the driving pin (a transistor in your case) can handle this current spike."

The purpose is to stop the gate capacitance and the lead inductance oscillating.  A low-valued resistor can help damp oscillations, but at the cost of slowing transition speeds and dissipating more heat in the MOSFET.  Another solution you'll see in higher-powered applications is a small ferrite bead installed on the gate pin.  So it depends on the length of your gate trace, the strength of the driver (fast edges are more prone to oscillating) and the like.  The rule of thumb is that it's safer to include one in a circuit unless you're sure you don't need it.  But you can get away without it fairly often."

In frequency, you'll see peaks at specific frequency components.  I don't know about ""pretty"", but if you're looking for ""pure"", I think that means that you want a tone that has a single peak at one frequency, and nothing at other frequencies. In the time domain, that will look like a perfect sine wave.  Some other, potentially easier waveforms include the square wave, triangle, etc. Here's how they sound: http://onlinetonegenerator.com/  To actually generate one in analog, you'll use an oscillator. You can google for ""sine wave generator circuit"" or similar to get some examples. Depending on how you design it, you may be able to use a potentiometer to adjust the frequency of the oscillation.  Using multiple ""presets"" of frequencies makes it a little more complicated - you'll either be mixing the outputs from different oscillators together or changing the frequency of a single oscillator.  You're basically building a synthesizer. A theramin would be a good place to start, since it's basically an analog sine wave generator that produces a single tone that is adjustable in frequency and volume."

AskElectronics,3cgjy4,Laogeodritt,2,Tue Jul 7 21:23:34 2015 UTC,"Simple waveforms (in particular the square wave) are very harsh because they have a lot of energy in higher harmonics relative to the fundamental frequency. A pure sine wave is as pure as you can get, but it's also an indistinct sound—if you want the sound to have presence, you do want some of those harmonics. Even harmonic expansions tend to be less harsh than odd harmonic expansions of similar power spectrum.  In general, a decent subtractive tone control strategy is to use a 4th- to 8th-order lowpass filter. This will severely reduce the power of frequencies beyond a certain frequency (the cutoff frequency). More specifically, an input frequency will be very quickly reduced in power as that input frequency increases beyond the cutoff frequency (even when the input power does not change). For frequencies far below the cutoff frequency, the response will be the same more or less for every frequency. Here's an example of a first-order filter; the x-axis is frequency, the y-axis is gain (increase/decrease of the input power or voltage at a given frequency, in dB).  This is the first part of reducing the ""brightness"", even ""harshness"", of a given input waveform. You can play around with the cutoff frequency to make a sound more or less bright.  A 2nd order and higher filter can resonate. That means that frequencies just below the input frequency, instead of just kind of rolling off from the low-frequency gain to the high-frequency attenuation of the signal, you have a region where the frequency response is higher than the low-frequency gain (this graph shows many different filters with different amounts of resonance). You want to design the lowpass filter to have a control for cutoff frequency and resonance independently.  Now, not only can you cut off low frequencies, you can also emphasise a small range of frequencies. This can give a nice ring or brightness without being as harsh, or it can destroy your ears. The graph above is of a 2nd order filter; with a higher-order filter, the rolloff beyond the cutoff frequency is sharper (you cut out high frequencies better), and the resonance ""hump"" can be narrower. In general, I've seen 4th to 8th order filters on each channel of the analog subtractive/modular synth designs I've looked at (not too many, unfortunately).  If you change the parameters of the stages of the filter, you can actually do some weird EQ like stuff—instead of rolling off very quickly beyond the cutoff frequency, you can design it so that there's a region where it rolls off more slowly and then gets steeper. You could mess with the resonance so that instead a narrow resonant peak, you get a kind of wide resonant mountain (or camel back) with two distinct peaks. Or more. I haven't played around with this for audio all too much, so I don't know how much this flexibility translates to tone control yet.    An alternative method is additive: adding different waveforms at different fundamental frequencies of each other to build up your own frequency spectrum for the sound you're going for. I don't have much experience with additive synthesis."

It wouldn't make any difference. The limit on clock frequency for a CPU or µc is the delay of the gates between the register stages. Using DDR flipflops would not change anything - you could halve the clock frequency, but you have two instructions per clock cycle.  An example: If you have a CPU with an adder where it takes 1ms for the result to appear, then the maximum clock frequency for the registers surrounding the adder would be 1kHz (1ms period).  If your registers are now sensitive to both edges instead of just the rising edge, the adder still takes 1ms to complete an addition. Your clock frequency must now be 500Hz (2x 1ms period), but you could issue two instructions per clock. The result? You can issue instructions with the same frequency as before. So no gains."

AskElectronics,3cfkpf,jackwilsdon,3,Tue Jul 7 15:03:59 2015 UTC,"No that latch will not work. It expects all inputs to be present at the same time when you toggle the LE (latch enable). If you feed it with a 1:16 mux, only 1 input signal will ever be valid. When you toggle the LE input on the latch, all the latches will be reset.   This is how I'd do it, if I were to duplicate your exact requirements (1. keep one of 16 channels actively changing from a single input, 2. keep the rest of the 15 channels the same as the last input they received)   Step 1: Set Address of both muxes to output channel. Both are in parallel  Step 2. Toggle En inputs of muxes high. Both are in parallel. Top mux routes data to the output. Bottom mux will force the Enable HIGH on the selected latch because the bottom mux IN is tied HIGH. All other latch enables are low due to the pull-downs.  Step 3. Channel is now active. Do your data outputting  Step 4. Toggle the En inputs of muxes back down to LOW. All output states remain because the latches Enable input is low due to the pull-downs  EDIT uhhh actually I would seprate the two mux Enable lines. Then when you want to select an output channel, enable the top mux first, and bottom mux last. Do the reverse order when de-selecting the channel (put a small delay in between). The reason is because you want to make sure the latches have finished latching before taking away the input. There is probably a tiny delay  EDIT 2 duhhhh you don't even need that top mux. Put all data inputs in parallel.. Engineering. yay! One output feeding lots of inputs means a lot of parallel capacitance. Buffer it because all that extra capacitance will limit your output frequency."

It is a shift register + storage register where you write out all the pin states serially via shiftOut, then cycle the storage update to set the outputs to their new positions. All pin states are then held until you've sent new data and cycled the storage register again. This does however mean you'll have to resend all the positions every time you want to change just a single output, so it may not suitable if you want to change single bits at high speed."

Is there a 16 pin version of the 74HC595?   These chips are cheap and you can run several of them in parallel, sharing all but the DS and output pins between them, so you can write more than one at the same time. If you would prefer a single chip-type interface, you can use the Q7S pin connected to the next DS input to use two in series, and it will act like one big chip.  The thing is, it sounds like you want to write all 32 pins for the cartridge within 250 ns. If you are running this on a 16 MHz Arduino, that gives you 4 cycles/instructions to write all the shift registers. A Raspberri pi would also be a challenge, because linux isn't a realtime OS, so there could be unpredictable pauses in functioning.

AskElectronics,3cfema,iocan28,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:15:33 2015 UTC,"I started a project for and got a lot of parts of a single phase induction motor controller working with a PIC18F46K22.  Presumably your controller is managing output current as its controlled parameter - if you have some output capacitance, you can control the current going to the output to try to keep the output voltage where you want it.  Your PWM frequency (and feedback response rate if it's longer) will dictate how big capacitors should be to handle different rates of varying current without voltage getting too wild.  The phase angle idea only makes a lot of sense if you know your load consumes current sinusoidally - otherwise in the generic sense you end up with a one dimensional dataset of how much current is consumed at each point in the voltage waveform.  You could do something like finding the peak current and placing it relative to the voltage waveform, or do more advanced math to arrive at a better figure (maybe the peak current isn't at the center of the main current consumption?).  But it's probably not a big concern to make the thing function but I can see how it could be a nice parameter to read back.  Anyway, one thing to consider is using the PIC only for waveform generation and management functions - you could have it control the switching as well but then it becomes part of the time delay on the control loop.  You will have a much better performing inverter if it's all purpose designed circuitry handling the different parts of the feedback loop, but in principle you could do it in software instead if you can live with the drawbacks.  On that note, I recommend PIC18 for the hardware multiplier - this is about the minimum level you can work with with any speed if you want to do things like compensating ADC inputs against VCC variation (if your signals are not already scaled to match the 0-VCC range).  Also that multiplier comes in handy if you need to scale pulse timing to match main power bus voltage.  Advice there:  Lookup table the hell out of these conversion factors, then use that hardware multiplier to multiply by the factor.  The way I did it for a 0...199% scaling was lookup tabling the ADC read that controls it, then downscaling with a 16*16 multiply (take the upper 16 bit as result), and conditionally adding the original value to get the + scaling range."

That convention is here to stay.   While it is likely that the two lines in a 2-line connector belong to the same electrical circuit, that is not necessarily the case, and in any case it is unknown to the maker of the connector a priori.  With a 3-position connector, there's no telling.  With a 4-position connector, it could be two separate circuits, or just a single circuit, or 3 circuits using the 4th position as a return.  So, you see, when a connector manufacturer talks about circuits, and the electrical engineer looks at a schematic, they mean different things by the work ""circuit"".  An alternative terms is ""way"", as in ""20-way connector"" or ""position"". Though a position could be unpopulated by a contact.

There are other terms that may be used when you get into specific use cases, but conductor is still the proper overarching general term.

When they turn on, they (usually through a cascade of gradually larger transistors) switch some bigger transistors that actually drive the output.

AskElectronics,3cbpf6,TheJBW,2,Mon Jul 6 19:33:53 2015 UTC,"The main thing you get when you pay more is more samples per second. Remember that Nyquist tells you that you need to take 2f samples to detect a signal with frequency f. A rule of thumb is 10f samples; most manufacturers will quote their analogue bandwidth as a tenth of the sample rate.  Other things: you pay more, you get more channels. You might also get a mixed signal scope that has logic inputs. The screen gets bigger and higher resolution and so on. You normally get bigger memories so you can store more samples.  There's not much that you should worry about as a beginner. Figure out what the highest frequency signal you're likely to deal with is and go from there. For example, I rarely need to go above 20MHz because that's the top speed of the microcontrollers I work with. Having four channels is luxury, but two is perfectly doable. Where it gets wasteful is when you buy a scope that's far too overspecced for what you want. Why would I buy a 1GHz scope when I can get by with a 100MHz one?  If you must use a USB scope, then a second hand Picoscope from eBay will do you fine. What bandwidth do you care about? The entry level 2200 will give you 10MHz (100Msps). The software is nice and also does serial decoding. People will sniff, but I think they're great, well designed products and I'm glad I have one alongside my regular bench scope. The 2200 retails new for around $120-150 (£99 ex VAT in the UK). One reason to consider them over other competitors is that the hardware is nice and they've been established for a while and the software is pretty mature now. Also they don't bullshit on specs, what you see is what you get.  There's also Bitscope and its ilk, but I haven't tried them so I can't comment. Their website makes me suspicious already, they claim 40MS/s and 100MHz bandwidth - how?  You can read a comparison here http://www.ganssle.com/microscopes.htm  If you want to get something more benchworthy then you really can't go wrong with a used Rigol DS1052. You can hack them to have 100MHz bandwidth and they're really fantastic entry level DSOs. If you want to spend, then you can get one of the new 4 channel models for $400. As a beginner, don't waste money on the big name brands. Rigol is Chinese, but they've won a lot of respect from amateur and professional electrical engineers. A second hand 1052 should be around $250-300.  Another alternative is an all-in-one product like the National Instruments myDAQ which is designed to plug into LabView and has inputs and outputs. But in my opinion it's overpriced and you're locked into National Instruments who'll charge you $50 for a USB cable if you let them.  Obviously it depends what you want to spend...!

They aren't perfect, but they are hard to beat for the price. Even 300USD is too much for a brand new DS1052E when you consider how much more you can get."
AskElectronics,3cbpf6,grem75,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:23:15 2015 UTC,"This applies to single events, with equivalent-time sampling you can see repetitive events far beyond the ADC's sample rate.  This is simply not true. Nyquist is nyquist. You can average to get more bits, and you can heterodyne and frequency window, but you cannot reconstruct a signal sampled at less than the nyquist rate."
AskElectronics,3cbpf6,TheJBW,0,Tue Jul 7 03:16:28 2015 UTC,"Go tell that to Tek, LeCroy and HPAgilsight, they all do it. Equivalent-time sampling works, you're taking multiple samples at different intervals to reconstruct a repeating signal. It isn't as good as a high real-time sampling rate, but for a lot of applications it is adequate."

AskElectronics,3cbpf6,slackchameleon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:29:38 2015 UTC,There is definitely no substitute for a high sample rate and deep memory for single events. Though there is nothing wrong with equivalent-time sampling if it fits your needs and budget.
AskElectronics,3cbpf6,grem75,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:49:19 2015 UTC,"Why do they all have displays?   It is very convenient to have the display close to the circuit you are looking at if you have to hold the probe pressed against a high-pitch IC pin at the same time. Moving your head around gets really annoying, IMHO.  You also have the controls close to the display. Some new scopes have touchscreens, but there is clear benefit to having a physical knob to turn for scale and offset.   When do the diminishing returns start kicking in for someone completely new to the hobby?   Here is just my limited view. A Chinese manufacturer with a fairly stable reputation is Rigol. They have scopes at various price ranges. Most of the price depends on the number of channels and sampling speed (it affects the amount of hardware and internal speed).  More high-end manufacturers like Tektronix or Keysight not only use (in general) higher quality parts, but also have a much better user interface. More specialized buttons for the right things and better menu layout, etc. In short, more development resources put into the product. Finding one of these in an online auction at a reasonable price is definitely doable. Some argue second hand high-end is better than new low-end, but there are the same two camps of car buyers as well, so I'm not arguing for any one here. I will let others answer your question about the oscilloscope price ladder more thoroughly.  I'm good with the Rigol DS1052E, their cheapest. When I actually worked in electronics, it would have been fine as well, but that company had a Tektronix TDS 200 series, which certainly felt cheap for being a Tektronix. One of our clients had a high-end Tektronix (even with a built-in printer, IIRC). That was certainly a nice afternoon.   Any advice on how I should approach the investment would be greatly appreciated.   If the signals you want to look at are reasonable in magnitude (0.1 - 50 V) and low frequency (< 10 kHz) you would be fine just using an analog audio input on your computer and using Audacity or similar for recording. It can do filtering and DFT for you. With stereo input you will even have two channels. Since computers nowadays have virtually unlimited memory, triggering capabilities are less important than on a dedicated scope.  You will (worst case) need to build an analog frontend circuit that can convert the input signal range to 1 Vpp to work with usual analog audio inputs. That can be an interesting project in itself."

You'd be better off with a SPDT ON-ON switch. Either way, you'd wire the circuit output to the common, then the pickups to one pole and the output of the fuzz to the other pole.

To create a circuit with the LED, you need a battery, an LED, and a resistor. The resistor is what determines the current in the circuit. You should be able to find the voltage drop listed on the LED's datasheet, as well as the maximum current.  The only things missing are the voltage of the battery and the resistance of the resistor.

AskElectronics,3ccue4,frothysasquatch,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:39:21 2015 UTC,"In the datasheet of your LED (assuming you know the manufacturer/part number) is an I-V curve that shows the current as a function of voltage. This is an exponentional function, so as voltage increases by a small amount the current increases substantially. Because of this behavior, it's common to just assume a fixed voltage drop and use that to simplify the calculation of the resistor.   For example, if you have a supply voltage of 5V and your LED drops 2.4V at 10mA, you know that your resistor should drop 2.6V at 10mA. 2.6V / 10mA = 2.6kOhm. So when 10mA flows through your circuit, the resistor drops 2.6V and the LED drops 2.4V. Usually that's close enough.  You can do a more exact calculation, but you have to extrapolate the equation of the I-V curve from the datasheet and then solve the non-linear equation, and usually that's not really worth it."

Even with an 'ordinary' Low Dropout (LDO) part, the minimum input voltage is 6.25V.

If you want to preserve the polarity, you can either go with a flyback (which replaces the inductor in a buck-boost with a transformer/coupled inductor but has some EMI implications) or something like a cuk or SEPIC converter (which are a bit more esoteric and you might have to dig a bit more for application info).  I would recommend reading through Linear Tech's App Notes 19 and 25 to get a good base understanding of switchers. For SEPIC information, look at the LT1371 datasheet.

No, that's fine; the resistor is in series with the capacitor and limits the current through the PWM switch to a safe value.  The problem arises when someone wants to do away with the resistor to deliver significant power to the Peltier.  You can slow the turn-on, but then the heating of the switch skyrockets.  Power = VI.  When the switch is fully off, I=0 and there's no power dissipated in the switch.  When the switch is fully on V=0 (or pretty close) across the switch and there's no power dissipated.  But when the switch is half-on, Vout = Vin/2, so Vin/2 is dissipated in the switch, and there's significant current, and there's a lot of heating.  There's a finite amount of energy deposited per switch-on, so you can reduce heating by slowing the switching down to reduce the average, but that defeats the purpose of the capacitor.

FYI the thermal stress isn't a problem with PWM above about 1kHz since it doesn't have enough time to change temperature much during one period. The real problem is that it just wont work well at low duty cycle.

The metal enclosure should most definitely be earthed, and the transformer too, if the transformer is well bolted down with any paint between the contacting metal surfaces removed, this will be sufficient.  A circuit breaker isn't strictly necessary, a standard fuse in a screw-in type fuse holder would do. However, to use the breaker, mount the breaker in the box on a bit of DIN rail so it sticks out through a square hole just big enough for the end with the lever to fit (not too big that you can see the terminal screws from the outside). You can do this by neatly cutting the rectangular hole for the breaker to stick through, then drilling two holes either side. Fix two long bolts in place (longer than the breaker is deep) with some nuts and washers, then drill two corresponding holes on some DIN rail. Mount the breaker on the din rail after you have terminated your wires and feed it onto the bolts. Clamp it down with some nuts and washers behind the DIN rail and you're done.  You'll want a power switch too, wire that as the first thing after the supply comes into the enclosure, then wire to the fuse/circuit breaker, then your overtemp switch, then to your transformer.  Make sure there are vent holes in the box to let the heat out (or install a fan), and definitely connect up the overtemp protector too. If you hook up a neon lamp in parallel with the overtemp switch, and have the overtemp switch connected in series before the supply side of the transformer, if the overtemp switch activates the neon lamp will illuminate to tell you to chill out for a bit.  Also, make sure the secondary is completely isolated from the metal housing. I've seen (and repaired) many welders that completely melt the earth wiring all the way back to the switchboard and cause fires when the secondary insulation breaks down and the secondary current tries to flow through the thin earth wire...  As for the cable entry, get yourself a proper plastic clamp. Don't just knot the cable to stop it pulling through. This puts uneven stress on the cable which will lead to insulation failure and a short, even more so with the current you'll be pulling..  And lastly, thicker cable is better on the primary side. I'm not sure what sizes are standard where you live, but I'd be looking at using around 2.5mm2 cable at a minimum."

AskElectronics,3c8kku,TERRAOperative,2,Mon Jul 6 21:25:02 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a decent list. If you ground the case, and firmly bolt the transformer down as specified, you won't need the extra earth/ground wire for the transformer.  When I mentioned the thermal switch, I was just referring to the overload protector already in the transformer, I was assuming it was the self resettable type. You can add another external one if this isn't the case (they usually look like a small black and silver button with two flat terminals on the back) and mount it directly to the transformer. I'd try to get one rated about 90o C, but you can just stick with the one inside the transformer if it's the resettable type."
AskElectronics,3c8kku,highwirefixer,2,Tue Jul 7 00:10:08 2015 UTC,"Yes ground the housing.  You can isolate the transformer if you like but still ground it and the casing.  Ground anything that is metal.  You cant have too many bonds to ground.  Better to be safe then sorry.  I would also put electrical tape or something rubber on the wooden handles.  A lot of people think it is safe to use wood as an insulator but if it is damp at all or the paint that you use has conductive properties, you can get an awful shock! Thats just my opinion, it just depends on how safe you want to feel while you are using it."
AskElectronics,3c8kku,grem75,2,Mon Jul 6 00:01:27 2015 UTC,"Grounding the housing to earth is good, grounding the secondary is not. If your ground clamp doesn't have a good connection you don't want it finding earth ground through your mains wiring."

Earth connections are not fused or monitored so nothing cuts the power.   A GFCI or RCD will not protect you against this failure because it monitors the live and neutral for balance, this fault would not break that balance, the first you would know about it is when one of the appliance leads caught fire."
AskElectronics,3c8kku,NoobMadeInChina,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:11:01 2015 UTC,"About circuit breakers: they are meant to protect the wire, not the load.  If you look at the datasheet for your circuit breaker (which is probably documented better than your average home circuit breaker, because DIN rail for industrial use and etc), you should find a overload vs trip time curve.  Notice its not a sharp curve at 100% load; it may take something like many minutes to hours for the thing to trip when drawing a constant 100% of the breaker amperage.  Circuit breakers are typically used to protect wiring from overheating and catching on fire due to a dead short.  Circuit breakers protecting overloads that aren't as definite as a dead short?  Seek another option.  Also, how did you wire your circuit breaker and what are your local standards?  All I can tell is your mains is 240VAC, which may mean you live somewhere outside the USA.  How are you obtaining the 240VAC?  Split-phase or single phase?  If its split-phase you should have a double pole breaker, as both wires coming from your outlet is hot.  Make sure your breaker is in-line with the hot wire.   Take a volt meter w/ continuity tester to test your current overload protector.  Or take a battery, some wire, and LED/lamp.  Or replace it with a more popular thermal cutoff fuse (digikey search it, they're cheap).  Yes Earth it.  If a HV wire comes loose, the current will be shunned to ground which will hopefully trip your breaker.  On the secondary side of your HV xfrmr, its already isolated from Earth ground.  But given its capable of a shit ton of amps, you might be better off grounding one side of it as well (thereby getting rid of the isolation).  This is because if your high-amp wire comes loose, there is at least a chance that it may trip the thermal cutoff.  Otherwise you won't know anything.  (Disclaimer: typically obtaining isolation with a transformer is desired, but given that your application can be lethal, I don't see how the benefits of isolation outweigh the benefits of safety).  Another thing to consider is to use GFCI breakers.  Note that this won't work if you have isolation between your microwave transformer.  It will trip on overload and when it senses current being diverted to earth ground via an un-intentional pathway (such as your body)."

Looking at the graph linked should give you some idea of the type of breaker and it's time to switch when exposed to over current, note there are there types a,b and c, standard breakers in houses are B type, using an A type will improve the cut off speed, but at very high currents it will always be a race between the house trip and the local trip."

Is this correct?  You probably don't need to wire a power supply to the controller as they generally last 4-5 years on a single battery.   If you really insisted on having it powered by the motorcyle, tie it into something that is only on when the key is on. Efficiency doesn't matter, a LM780X would do just fine.   As far as the wiring to the switches, you can just use flooded cat3 and shove it into one of the flexible conduits already running to the bars. A minimalist approach would be a small selector switch with a pushbutton feature."
AskElectronics,3c8p3n,-Mikee,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:59:49 2015 UTC,"What I've done, is to keep the battery in the remote. Then I've used a relay to short out the push button on it, with a two pin socket/plug so that I can remove it quickly and use it conventionally.   The relay I trip via the flasher circuit on the bike via an 'AND' combination of the clutch lock out and the pass switches (i.e. I pull in the clutch, and flash the high beam). So as you coast up to your garage door with the clutch in, you just activate the pass/flash switch and the door opens.   If you just use the high beam circuit, the door opener is activated any time the high beam is on, which I imagine would drain the battery quickly.  The relay I used was a tiny solid state one that easily fitted inside remote.  Admittedly my solution is still activating the remote any time I change gears when I have my high beam on, but it hasn't prematurely drained the remotes battery, probably because if I'm on high beam at night, I'm generally just cruising down the highway at speed and thus not changing gears.

AskElectronics,3c8p3n,someguyfromnz,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:11:26 2015 UTC,"How valuable is the opener?  Automotive +12V is notoriously dirty and hard on components.  The worst-case is what's called a ""load dump transient"", and happens if the battery comes loose while it's being charged (e.g. right after starting).  The alternator, which had been supplying a lot of power, can't stop instantly and the +12V spikes to 100V or so.  This is rare. so the question is, do you care if the remote survives it?  If you don't mind just replacing the remote in this unusual case, then a simple 3.3V linear regulator with enough current capacity to supply the transmitter (measure!) and at least a 15V (preferably 24V) input rating.  That big a voltage drop will result in the regulator heating up fast, but if you don't hold the button down for long, you can half-ass the heat sinking.

Since you might want to consider using multiplexers to reduce hardware.   Are your solenoid valves all in the same place?

AskElectronics,3c6he9,petemate,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:50:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think that would be the case. The rectifier would still only rectify the top of each sinusoidal, where the voltage exceeds the voltage of the bulk capacitor(plus the diode drop). Current wouldn't be greater or smaller here, it would just stop flowing when the capacitor voltage would be equal to the sinusoidal, or when the sinusoidal were to get cut by the triac.   Since most phone chargers are able to perform at a very wide input range, they would work until the peak level of the chopped sinusoid would be lower than the minimum of that range. If they are designed correctly, they would have some sort of under-voltage protection, but if they are designed incorrectly, they could cause problems with the capacitor ripple current rating, since the flyback would need to pull more current due to the longer duty-cycle needed to energize the flyback inductor to the required levels. However, with the inherent duty-cycle limitation of the flyback, max duty cycle would be at the lowest input voltage and highest load, so most likely it wouldn't be able to pull enough current to actually exceed the capacitor ripple-rating."

AskElectronics,3c5wkp,Mentally-,2,Sun Jul 5 03:33:21 2015 UTC,"Wow, I had no idea about this and I've gone through a few basic electronics tutorials.  How does either formula work when a circuit is a mix of resistors and diodes, such as my LED strip?"
AskElectronics,3c5wkp,zootboy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:38:09 2015 UTC,"I believe it's the typical LED strip circuit that zootboy describes: a 600 LED strip with 200 parallel segments, with each segment containing 3 LEDs in series with a resistor. His explanation clarified things a lot."
AskElectronics,3c5wkp,zootboy,3,Sun Jul 5 03:40:07 2015 UTC,"There's no simple, single equation to do such a calculation. When a resistor and a diode are put in series, their different behaviors work at odds with each other. You have two different equations that must reach an equilibrium to determine the steady state of the system (if there is one).  Consider the case of a nearly perfect diode. We assume that it shows a 0.7V drop when any current is passed through it. A resistor in series with it drops voltage in linear proportion to the current passed through it. Because the devices are in series, their currents are equal. When 5V is applied to our circuit, current begins to flow. The diode drops 0.7 of the volts, leaving the remaining 4.3V to be dropped by the resistor. If we know it's a 1000 ohm resistor, we calculate with ohm's law a 4.3mA current. Note that if we had applied this 5V directly across the resistor, we would have passed 5mA. Thus, the diode has altered the behavior of the circuit.  But this was a semi-ideal diode. Now let's look at a real diode. Real diodes increase their voltage drop logarithmically as current through them increases. Or, from the other perspective, current passed increases exponentially as voltage applied increases. This can be bad for our LED, because diodes will happily pass enough current to destroy themselves if even slightly overvolted. They also tend to run at unusual voltages (e.g. 3.2V for white LEDs). So why does a series resistor help? Remember that the current passed through the diode is the same as the current passed through the resistor. So we start at 0V and ramp the supply up to 5V. The resistor is not passing current at first, so the full 5V is applied to the diode. At this voltage, the diode wants to pass tons of current, so it starts to try. But as it conducts, the current going through the resistor begins to drop voltage. This reduces the voltage available to the diode. The system will find an equilibrium at a current where the voltage drop sum of the diode and the resistor equals the supply voltage.   Of course, this is considering only a single resistor and diode in series. Often, 12V LED strips will have 3 LEDs in series with a single resistor. This is to make the voltage drops of the diodes add up to something closer to the supply voltage, allowing the resistor to drop less voltage. Less voltage drop in the resistor means less heat generated. If you assume the LEDs all have the same characteristics (generally somewhat true), they can be thought of as a single diode with a larger voltage drop."

The BT module claims to have differential audio stereo output (although how they get two differential signals on only 3 wires is a mystery to me)  If you want to keep the grounds isolated, then you can couple the audio through a pair of small 1:1 audio output transformers: each transformer has primary wired to SPKLP and SPKN, then the transformer output goes to your amplifier stage. It should be ok to ground one side of the secondary to match the amp input. Do the same thing with 2nd transformer for SPKRP and SPKN. Don't directly ground SPKN.  Edit: ah I see your amp board only has single ended audio inputs with ground in common with power ground. This is a weak design for an amp. But it is what it is.  I suspect that SPKN is not actually referenced to 0v, and you are probably causing some kind of unwanted output oscillation by grounding SPKN.

I have one rigged up that I use all the time. It's good enough for general tinkering. For more serious work you want a good quality adjustable bench PSU. Most ATX power supplies just don't supply very stable voltages.   You can easily build your own with a project box and some screw terminals. I made one like this: https://youtu.be/5TJaREOi1SY except I repurposed a mini to regular ATX adapter cable  and just cut off the mini end to give it more flexibility and durability.   The ATX should also have built in short circuit prevention. Mine shuts off if you do anything too dumb with it.

This is not a power supply though. Use a wallwart or something to power it. It will drop some voltage so plan 3-4v more than what you need. Laptop chargers usually have plenty of volts and amps. Or get a 24v power supply for 10$. I can't vouch for the cheap chinese supplies (it will probably be just fine for breadboarding) but the control unit is really good.

Seems like a decent idea, but what's different about a wall wart vs a battery if you have an over current concern? A typical 9v alkaline battery can source 1/2 amp for a little while, a pack of 4 AA batteries even in series can source 3-7 Amps! Yowza!  I guess the battery will run out of energy eventually in a short circuit which the wall wart won't. But I think pretty much any battery will have enough juice to kill miswired components, like an unrestricted LED."

This battery powered phone charger is charged by plugging it in to a USB cable, and supplies USB power when on the go.  You want to disassemble the battery powered phone charger, remove the battery from it, and use its charging circuit to charge up the other LiPo battery?  It might work, if both are LiPo as opposed to the other batteries  being LiIon. They have slightly different charging characteristics.  It also depends on the size of the batteries and charging current. Assuming the power bank is 1000mAh, and charges at .5 C (500mA) the 4000 mAh batteries would be charging at .125 C which may not be enough to charge them in a decent amount of time, if at all.  But it might work."
AskElectronics,3c32ng,notapantsday,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:51:18 2015 UTC,"Ok, what you need is a constant current/constant voltage device. This limits the current flow into the battery by adjusting the voltage, then holds a constant voltage while the current drops at the final part of the charge.  A smart phone has the circuitry to do this built in to it. The USB supply just provides a constant 5V to it. Plugging it directly into a battery is a REALLY bad idea.  Assuming your battery is lithium ion of some sort, applying 5V to the terminals could make it explode, or at least destroy it. A friend of mine showed me a picture of where he mischarged a lipo batteries and it detonated. There where holes in the carpet 10m away from blobs of molten copper from inside the battery. Along with some fire damage.  As for how to charge them. If you do not understand how chargers work, buy, don't build. You can find a number of reasonable ones on eBay that do most of the work for you. They cost around $10 and will keep being useful.  As for charging in parallel. It can be done (with a proper charger) but you will want to make sure you use matched cells. You want the same type, size, and wear pattern. This generally means new or from the same battery. Mismatching can damage the cells, though a charger should stop them melting."
AskElectronics,3c32ng,hoopycat,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:54:41 2015 UTC,"I think no.. lithium charging as far as I know requires a pretty well controlled voltage to work, not a fixed one.

If you just start throwing electricity into the batteries you're gonna end up just killing the batteries (if you're lucky) or, significantly more likely, causing a fire or explosion.  http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/charging_lithium_ion_batteries  I saw you ask about keeping the voltage fixed at 4.2 but that'll kill the battery too. From that link:  ""Li-ion cannot absorb overcharge, and when fully charged the charge current must be cut off. A continuous trickle charge (maintenance charge) would cause plating of metallic lithium, and this could compromise safety. To minimize stress, keep the lithium-ion battery at the 4.20V/cell peak voltage as short a time as possible.""  You may be desperate to charge those batteries but I really don't think you can DIY it at all, unless you find another actual device that charges lithium batteries (not some USB wall plug, which merely powers a charging circuit inside a device) you're gonna be a lot more desperate to find a fire extinguisher."

AskElectronics,3c2k91,gmarsh23,2,Sat Jul 4 15:15:23 2015 UTC,"I think pairing the TLC5916 with the 74HC595 is overkill and will trip you up. Theoretically these two chips together would have the ability to update the entire matrix with one synchronous pulse to their latch enable pins and that seems novel in its own right but I suspect you won't get the results you're looking for.  Let's assume you'll use the common cathode LED matrix and sink the columns to the TLC5916. If you limit the driver's current to 20mA and only light one row at a time with the 74hc595 you can expect each LED to light consistently compared to its neighbors but there's no need for the 74hc595 at that point. You could just use a 4017B decoded decade counter to do your line selection with same clock signal you'd be feeding into the TLC5916's latch enable. I'd recommend using a transistor array between the LED matrix and the 4017B because I don't think that the 4017B can be expected to source even 100mA.   When you try to drive the whole display at a time each column is sinking an arbitrary amount of current between zero and 140mA depending on which LEDs on the display are lit. I'm guessing this means the LEDs won't light consistently because nothing will limit a column with only one LED lit to 20mA when the TLC5916 is set to sink 140mA.  The TLC5916's current limiting ability is mostly novel because in the former example of only lighting one row at a time each column could consist of different LEDs with varying voltage drops and the current limiting will make them all light to a nice consistent 20mA. So if that LED matrix was 7x5 RGB (105 LEDs) you could chain together a few TLC5916s sinking 20mA and you'd have a consistent looking 8-color display.   Pairing the 74HC595 with the TLC5916 breaks down when you use them with a matrix that has common pins. If you could sink each row of LEDs to its own TLC5916 that would be a different story but you'd need seven TLC5916 for each LED matrix, it would be messy and expensive.   Your best bet would be to light one row at a time with something as simple as a decade counter. Instead of clocking data into a 74hc595 which gives you finer control than you need and eight bits at a time before having to also latch the data. Instead everything would be handled by the TLC5916.  If you wanted to get really crazy you could use a TLC5940 instead and drive that LED matrix with 12-bit greyscale but you might have a hard time controlling it with with your MCU. I know with AVRs you'll want to use your hardware timers for this."
AskElectronics,3c2k91,gmarsh23,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:57:23 2015 UTC,"Thank for for the detailed reply!  I like the idea of taking the sink latch in to a counter - slick.   I'm guessing this means the LEDs won't light consistently because nothing will limit a column with only one LED lit to 20mA when the TLC5916 is set to sink 140mA.   Ah, of course. I'm going to blame this oversight on 2am.  New plan, still with a column cathode / row anode matrix:    TLC5916 directly on the columns, configured to sink 20ma per channel 4017B on the rows, with the clock pin tied to the latch of the column driver. I'll need some sort of transistor array between the outputs of the counter & the rows.   Now, what should I use for the transistor array? It's effectively a high-side switch. I went looking for p-channel fet arrays, but they seem to be specialized (read: expensive) devices. My options seem to be:   7 discrete P-channel BJTs + associated base resistor 7 discrete P-channel fets, like the Fairchild NDS0610 Something like 2 TPS2095 though the rise time of 2280us could potentially be an issue   I'm leaning towards 7x discrete P-FETs - unless there is a common IC for this task that I am overlooking. Is there?  Also, if I wanted to add more 5x7 segments, presumably I could just chain more TLC5916's, and choose a P-FET which can source more current. For example, I could use IRLML5203TRPbF's (which can supply 3A) to power four 5x7 modules.  And for the drawing process : the MCU will shift row-by-row data in to the sink. This leads to a maximum (assuming one matrix) of 20*50=100ma per row and 20ma of current per column (sink-channel).  Aside, the TLC5940 looks very interesting. For the time being, I should probably keep it simple. I've noted it down for a following revision, though."

AskElectronics,3c1qa3,its_j3,8,Fri Jul 3 23:20:24 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, as someone who's done something like this and failed, a plain motion sensor is not enough.  The unfortunate thing is that when you're listening to music, you often stop moving for long periods - so just as you're getting into it, the music fades out.  You find yourself ""waving your hand in the air"" a lot to get the music to come back (well, it was a light in my case, and reading a book, but you get the idea).  I never did get a solution but my plan would have been the following:   A motion sensor for the room. An infrared sensor for each door that tells whenever someone enters or leaves the room (but not which).   And the following algorithm:   A door transition followed by motion sensor activity means someone has entered the room. Motion sensor activity followed by a door transition means someone has left the room. Motion sensor activity with no door transition means someone is still in the room.   (There might be a caveat there, because you might be able to trigger the motion sensor for a little longer after you've made a door transition, but you can easily work that out by experiment and code around it.)  This covers everything except when someone leaves when one or more people are still in the room, not moving - but they can easily fix that by simply waving their hands when someone leaves, and then they're good to go."

If you're interested, the overall circuit would go something like this:  Solar Panel => Solar Maximum Power Point Tracker & Battery Charger => Battery => 5V DC-DC converter => USB Charger Emulator => USB Device  Additionally, I'd keep in mind the power demands of the devices you're powering with your solar charger.  I'm not sure you'd have enough power generation capacity to power a hot plate for a considerable length of time without needing a very long charge time."

I also have the transformers as well, many of them. I have a Neotek Series II console and last year I balanced the line input section of console with some JT-10KD-B's. I still have a few dozen of them but I also have a variety of other types as I tested many before deciding on those. Regarding that though, this device already has a 'phono' input and a switch. I'm sure you saw that on the schematics. Couldn't I do the same thing by floating the cold to here?  Also, can you elaborate a little more when you qualify it as 'not going to be a good amp?' Good in terms of reliability? Performance? This is near field monitoring from a mono source. I don't need it to be loud or have exceptional response above 12khz or below 60hz. If it's relatively clean, it'll be great for my purposes.  and hey, at the end of the day, tinkering provides me endless pleasure so if this amp ends up sounding like balls, I'll buy a real one. The more I think about this, the more I'm interested in doing this. If it works, it'll be a sexy little device that will definitely be a conversation starter with clients. If it doesn't, I'll have enjoyed my time trying and I'll definitely have learned a lot more.   But I'm very much a 'learn by trying' kinda guy so the more info you all can throw at me, the better.

I didn't see the phono input. That makes it a little easier but it is not isolated from the AC line. You must use a xfmr on it.  The output xfmr needs to be checked to be for an 8 ohm speaker- your 5C.  Old carbon composition resistors tend to change value. The 4 section electrolytic is old and should be replaced. There are others who rebuild old radios who can offer more advice. Can it be done? Sure, and you will learn a lot. You will have a 1.5 watt amp . If that's enough for you and you don't need reliability, go for it! I would keep a tiny solid state amp with the same in/out connectors on hand for quick substitution.  Good luck"

In the real world though the wires and switches do have  a very small resistance depending on a lot of factors and so you would see more current flowing through the switches or wire by some ratio that is found by ohms laws.

Anyway, you have a voltage divider and a voltage follower. The voltage divider is the two 1M resistors, whatever connects between the dots and the capacitor. They produce a voltage to the operational amplifier, which is configured as a voltage follower. Its function is to pass on the voltage from the voltage divider in a way that doesn't load the voltage divider. If you just took the output straight from the voltage divider(this bypassing the voltage follower), the current that would flow further ""down"" the circuit, would load the voltage divider, thus changing the divider ratio. With the voltage follower, you don't load the voltage divider in any significant way.   If you want more gain, you should look into the various operational amplifier configurations. There are several types, depending on which one works best for you. Because you have the voltage follower, you should be able to add a non-inverting amplifier(using the second amplifier in the LM358 package) in order to get the amplfication that you need. Just remember that you can't do very large gain in a single amplifier stage. The gain-bandwidth product(GBW) sets this limit. The gain-bandwidth product is the product of the bandwidth and the gain of your opamp, and this figure is fixed for each type of opamp. For the LM358 its probably 1MHz, meaning that if you want 1kHz bandwidth, you can ""only"" do 1000 times gain, because 1000 times 1kHz equals 1MHz."

Measure the total voltage and put a resistor in series to limit the current to 2A or less(.5C, which should be an ok charge current). Have a voltmeter handy and another resistor to do manual cell balancing as you charge. The ideal resistor would probably be about 10 ohms and 2W or higher to get about 400 mA balance current. If one cell is more than a couple tenth of a volt higher than the others, put the balance resistor across it until it matches the others. Repeat as necessary until cells are at 4v each.  This will get you maybe 70% capacity since you're only getting to 4 volts. The end of charging will take forever unless you gradually decrease the current limiting resistance.

At 1A, linear control of just one channel typically requires heatsinking. Multiple channels at 1A is simply not gonna happen on a single chip at a reasonable cost.  That's why you're not finding much above 100mA.  The TLC5940 is a very popular multi-channel linear driver chip, but max current is only 120mA.  That leaves switchmode control. Switchmode is more complicated, but doesn't produce anywhere near as much heat as linear control.  Most switchmode LED controllers are designed to drive one string of LEDs - the string can usually have only 1 LED if desired.  MAX16820/LM3405A/LT3518/etc are the most suitable chips available for your application even though you will need one chip per channel.

AskElectronics,3by4l7,ottawastartup,5,Fri Jul 3 03:00:55 2015 UTC,"Basically, that 25-foot cable is going to act like a big antenna every time the PWM driver switches on and off.  10A switching on and off 300 times a second is going to be a LOT of EMI at every frequency/wavelength that divides nicely into the cable length.  Secondly, a 25ft distance means 50ft of 14AWG wire, which will have a resistance of about 125 milliohms.  That may not sound like much, but with a 10A current you're already losing 1.2V out of your 12V supply -- 10% of the energy is going into heating the wire rather than lighting the LEDs.  Unless there's a good reason for the 25ft distance, you can avoid both of these problems completely by moving the PWM driver closer.  It's much better to have a long cable for the dimmer input; it's practically zero current, so the cable can be longer/thinner/cheaper with no EMI, heating, or power-loss consequences."

The module itself should be as close as possible to the LED strip, ideally just a few inches, because those carry an order of magnitude more current than anything else and are switched on and off rapidly.  In contrast, the wires to the dimmer control could be hundreds of feet long.  It's not switched and the current is low, so it's not going to produce EMI, and the signal is large enough that it shouldn't be susceptible to EMI from other sources."

If you're still concerned (or do end up having trouble) you can get a ferrite core (probably a toroid) designed for dealing with RF interference at many common electronics and audio equipment stores. Take the wire coming out of the driver and wrap it around that a bunch of times and that should effectively filter out any EMI that might still be there.  Also, you can take your two wires going to the LEDs and twist them together a bit, making them coaxial, and that will reduce radiation as well. Just 1-2 full twists a foot would probably be enough."

If they're good enough then why not use them?  Another approach might be to put a biiiiiiig capacitor from battery- to battery+ on the PCB.  Then when it's time to swap batteries, do so in four steps:   Disconnect old battery         Connect this Magic Dingus to the PCB.

The standard ESD tests charge up a few-hundred-picofarad capacitor to 2000 volts and discharge this into your device.  Well if your device contains a few-hundred-microfarads, that forms a capacitive divider that decreases the voltage spike amplitude by a factor of 106.  Voila, no problem.

The way to deal with this is to get a higher voltage TVS with negligible leakage at your nominal voltage.  If you have a 3V SoC, a 6V or 7V TVS should do OK.  DON'T connect it directly between Vcc and GND because obviously that won't do any good.  What you can do is:   Connect the TVS directly between the battery terminals close to where they come in to the board Put some ferrites (in a larger package size, 0603 or 0805 should be OK, so you don't arc over them in a big ESD event) between the battery terminals and the Vcc and GND nets Put your bulk capacitance on the Vcc and GND nets   The ferrites and capacitance form a low-pass filter so any transient events at the battery terminal have time to dissipate.  In normal operation, the clamp diode draws negligible current because its clamp voltage is so much higher than the nominal voltage (eg. a 10V diode on a 3V net).  In a transient event, the battery terminals will be clamped at 10V, but the event won't bring Vcc to 10V because of the LC filter formed by the ferrites and bulk capacitance.  Obviously if you hook the battery terminals to a 10V DC supply, you're still screwed, but this setup is good for catching ESD type events.  Please note that the use of 10V above is just an example clamping voltage.  I got tired of writing ""the clamping voltage of the TVS"".  Hope this is helpful."

First off know what mode of operation you want to use since the device supports several.  For just reading bits as simple as possible RD is what you want as it requires the least amount of pin twiddling and timing considerations.  It looks like you need to ground ~CS (so the chip is selected) and MODE (so you're in RD mode).  ~OFL is an output signal and can be left alone.  Do not ground ~RD, ~WR/RDY, or ~INT.  You need these free to do the work.  Once you have it in RD mode you drop ~RD to start the process, and then wait for ~INT to go low which signals that the output latches has the bits you want.  ~INT would typically signal the microcontroller (hence the name INTterrupt) but can be adapted for other uses.  The timing diagram you need to respect is the first one given.  Note that ~RD remains low throughout the process so don't think you can drive it low for a split-second and expect things to work.  They might but I've been burned by details like that before.    Questions answered for posterity:   Why does it say ""data will be valid 800ns after WR's rising edge"" ?   Because in WR-RD the rising edge starts the process, and the process takes ~800ns.  To be honest WR-RD sounds kind of screwy but that may just be because I'm tired.   The figures show INT going high when there's no conversion happening, so do i need to do anything with that pin?   ~INT goes to whatever device is going to read the data and signals that the conversion is complete and the output latch holds the bits you want.  Try and read them before this signal and you're going to see a bunch of high-Z states instead of meaningful data.    edit  I've done more reading and stand-alone might by closer to what you want but it's hard to tell without seeing your specific circuit setup.  It substitutes several timing constraints for a different set of constraints, to start it you pulse ~WD low and then ~INT returning low signals completion.

Or solder one end on the wiper pin and use your hand on the other.    It might take some effort to get the wire right; sometimes it'll slip out of your hand unnoticed or a very thin invisible layer of gunk (most commonly dirty flux) is present on the surface of the pads that it will take some tries to get both ends of the wire in contact.  Furthermore, you probably won't see exactly precisely min and max; it might be very close to min and/or max, like by one bit off or something...this is normal.  The pot basically acts as a voltage divider, where the voltage at the wiper is a linear function of the amount of travel (rotation).  And on second thought, I remembered normal pots usually travel close to 360 degrees, where as joysticks travel less than that and are also probably offset to accommodate the movement range of the stick.  So there you go, its likely an issue with different resistance of the new pots."
AskElectronics,3bwpd7,Scripto23,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:28:35 2015 UTC,"Dude, seriously thank you.  The issue was that I confused the wiper and ground pins on the Tx. I was so focused on the pots! SO SIMPLE! I should have seen it sooner but every guide I read had them on the flipped on the Tx.  But again, thank you. My stupid-ass brain needed input from like 6 people before I understood what these pots are actually doing. I really, really, appreciate your input! THANK YOU!"

AskElectronics,3bwpd7,Lhosha,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:40:04 2015 UTC,"Right?! I go to Menu>Radio Setup>Calibration and follow the steps. But even there the range is all messed up. Left stick gets most of the throttle range, yaw goes just left of center to full right, pitch goes from just below center to top, and roll goes from just left of center to full right. Also, I wasn't too concerned about direction at first, just magnitude. But throttle and roll were both inverted, so I flipped their plugs. I don't believe such a swap was necessary with the original gimbals?  I got the other gimbal in now and it's behaving the same way. The only thing I can think at this point is that I just heated up those little PCBs that have the trim switches too much and somehow damaged them, adding resistance. I don't know.   I soldered one of the old pots back in temporarily and that was messed up too. Even though I tested it, so I know it's good. I think I'll make a tiny wiring harness to remove that PCB from the equation next.   Pretty sure I'm just gonna buy a Taranis now. But I really want to know what the hell is going on here!"
AskElectronics,3bwlte,MaxSensei,4,Thu Jul 2 19:21:08 2015 UTC,"Here is how I would calculate it:  First you need to know the worst case (minimum) Hfe (current gain) it is listed as 1000.   Ib(min) is therefore 800mA/1000 = 0.8mA.  However this is just the minimum value, it is good practice to add a fudge factor to this value. Let's be generous and make this fudge factor 2.  Thus we want 1.6mA base current.  Then you calculate the resistor while taking the Vbe into account. Vbe is 2.5V.  So you resistor needs to be around   (5V-2.5V)/(.0016A) =  1562 Ohms."
AskElectronics,3bwlte,alez,2,Thu Jul 2 22:46:34 2015 UTC,Thanks for your help. I guess most of my problem was just in reading the data sheet. Glad my equations were at least correct.
AskElectronics,3bwlte,Lhosha,3,Thu Jul 2 23:19:42 2015 UTC,"Your min hFE is 1000 and your Vbe is 2.5V (not 0.7V). Base current compared to Ice is nothing so you can assume that Ic=Ie=1000xIb, in this case you want 0.8mA to get 800ma Ice. Your Vbe is 2.5 so your Ib=2.5V/R or 0.8mA=2.5V/R, it's 2.5V because you lose 2.5v on base-emiter. Don't trust datasheet, test your transistor and do it on a breadboard. For easy way just use a pot to adjust it to your liking and then just measure the resistance across the pot."

AskElectronics,3bwiu9,Krizzen,5,Thu Jul 2 18:59:10 2015 UTC,"""ZD401"" is probably just the component designator, not the part number itself.  Since thats already damaged, I recommend you take it out, place it under a good light source or microscope/stereoscope/magnifying lens, and try to make out any markings on the body of the diode.  It looks like its made by ST Microelectronics, so it should be easily traceable if (hopefully) the part number on the body of the diode stayed intact.  Cutting the thing out by the leads using some fine pliers is okay, its already busted anyways.  The second thing to do is to take a multimeter (or buy one - ideally a digital one that has at least continuity, resistance, and diode functions...they're not expensive) and try to trace out what caused that diode to blow.  Based on my experience, if you just replace the obvious damage, it will blow again because you did not get rid of the cause, if any.  My gut feeling is that the diode blew because of over-current.  I would start by measuring the resistance of those resistors near by, make sure that their measured resistance is close to what they should be.  Check for any shorts in shunt components (i.e. capacitors in parallel).  Start from the blown diode and go outwards.  DO NOT do this with power applied.  If you still can't find anything, you can either 1) go ahead and replace the diode and hope it doesnt blow, or 2) apply power (!!!) and trace out the voltages."

AskElectronics,3bwiu9,NoobMadeInChina,2,Thu Jul 2 21:28:38 2015 UTC,"Seeing that it is a TVS diode, its probably some sort of snubber circuit to get rid of transients at the transformer from the switching action.  Those circuits can be somewhat arbitrary sometimes.

AskElectronics,3bwiu9,Lhosha,1 point,Fri Jul 3 06:35:06 2015 UTC,"given time and money everything is repairable, but you have to question if it's worth the repair. I've repaired some equipment that I had to reconstruct the PCB because traces were blown, in this case PCB doesn't look bad so that makes it easier to repair. Based on pic 3 diode seems to be 1.5KE200A which is pretty highly rated and that can be understood by looking at the cutout under the diode. Rest of the circuit might be worming up because the diode isn't doing it's function as it souped (cuz it's blown to hell...). You can swap for a new diode but those things don't burn just because they wanted to burn. Sure a defect in the diode might have contributed but probably there's another problem somewhere on hight power side. On pic 6 there's some residue and seems to be several traces - clean that off with some alcohol, not really probable but some gunk between high power traces may cause problems. Many times capacitors don't have visible signs of being bad but will have high ESR being pretty much useless for power supplies, if you have a meter capable of measuring ESR you can also verify those caps."

The short answer to your question is no.  Induction ranges all almost all made by the same Chinese company and use almost identical circuits.  The circuit is very specific to heating magnetic material below its Curie point.  The quasi-resonant oscillator will not start if no load or a non-magnetic load is presented here.  Read here for an analysis of this circuit http://openschemes.com/2011/04/28/manual-control-of-the-1-8kw-induction-cooktop/  For what you want to do you need a more conventional heater.  The two major types are the Royer oscillator and the resonant tank, the resonant tank type being sub-divided into two types - series and parallel resonant.  Fluxeon currently manufactures Royer type heaters.  I offer an open-source version on my website, http://www.neon-john.com.  For a good tutorial on the resonant tank type heater, read here:  http://www.inductionheatertutorial.com/  Jonathan has many videos of his heater in action on youtube, handle ""imsmoother"".  That said, aluminum is very difficult to heat owing to its high electrical conductivity.  When we have a project that involves aluminum, we use a flux concentrator (ferrite material that concentrates the flux the work coil generates by ~500x) and power factor capacitors on the work coil to supply leading VARs to the work coil.  The resonant tank heater does a better job on aluminum but is MUCH more complicated and expensive."

AskElectronics,3btibg,neon_john,3,Thu Jul 2 15:19:02 2015 UTC,"As they note in that link, current production ranges integrate the oscillator driver into the control chip so you can't convert to manual operation.  That shouldn't be much of a problem with what you're trying to do.  You'll need to keep the total inductance similar to the range's pancake coil with a pot on top.  Do you have any way to measure inductance?  If not, you can experiment but I recommend starting out with too much.  Too little can let the IGBT current build more rapidly than the protective circuitry can activate.  You can add inductance with a separate coil of heavy wire, wound around a piece of wood or other non-conductive material.  Connect in series with your work coil.  Note that this type of oscillator will stop when the steel reaches the Curie temperature - where it becomes non-magnetic.  I learned that with one of my kitchen ranges.    I wanted to use the induction heater to do Cajun blackened steak and fish.  That requires a cast iron skillet heated to a dull red.  I bypassed the thermal sensor and fired it off.  When the cast iron hit the Curie temperature, the thing simply stopped.  The processor tried to start it a couple of times and then locked out, displaying an error code.  John"

I'm familiar with the LPC1768 which has a built-in serial bootloader which I talk to using LPC21ISP.  Your ATSAM3 probably uses SAMBA which isn't the linux ""windows filesharing"" thing but some weird usb protocol that should be but isn't DFU.

AskElectronics,3bsihg,gnail,4,Wed Jul 1 23:06:22 2015 UTC,"Hello again!  First off I think you should define some requirements - heat output, pottery load (clay firing is an endothermic process isn't it? different loads could affect your gain margin), ramp rate (K/minute), maximum ramp deviation, ramp settle time, final settle time, allowable overshoot (-> phase margin) etc. Make a graph of the ideal profile that you want to follow, then add some window around it that you think is acceptable, and that can be your criteria  A step response would also be very useful - apply full heat to the kiln, let it heat up to a bit above your normal maximum temperature, and let it cool down again. I would guess that the plant can be approximated by a first-order system and the responses can tell us the kiln's heat capacity and where its pole is.  Using your requirements and your plant model you can then design your controller and even simulate the response. If you haven't done it before I do recommend just play around with the parameters a bit and gain an intuitive understanding on what the coefficients do. You might even be able to come up with an acceptable set of coefficients just by trial and error if your requirements are quite relaxed. A simple PI controller might be all you need! For a type-2 controller though I think your ki will probably be zero since your pii action can do pi's job as well. Tweaking it until it's good enough is quite widespread in the industry so there isn't really any shame in that.  Otherwise you can probably do pole placement to get the overall system behave to your requirements. Here's an introduction to pole placement for state-space controller. It should be quite simple for you since all your states should be observable. You can then discretise the s-domain controller to a digital controller using bilinear transform or other methods, and implement that in your code. It probably won't be anything like a PID controller but there is nothing wrong with that.  Don't worry if all of this seem very overwhelming. It took me 2+ years of university to get from basic modelling to state-space to digital control and then onto non-linear and MIMO control. If you do the control design properly this is probably worthy of an university final year project in itself!  And finally I'm by no means an expert - I'm doing my best trying to remember what I learnt but I could be wrong. As always you should do your own research (like control systems lecture notes) and have a good overview on the theory and also the options available to you."

AskElectronics,3bsihg,Denmarkian,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:20:25 2015 UTC,"Here's a quick and dirty example I've just made up. Sorry for the Excel graphs but that's all that I have at the moment.  I've made up a first-order plant with transfer function of y[t] = 0.98 * y[t-1] + 0.02 * x[t] and you can see the open loop response. The controller is as implemented in your code (but without D term). Coefficients k = [kp, ki, kii]. I was just playing with numbers and came to a set of coefficients for a PI controller that works reasonably. For PI without kii, the output settles to a constant error from SP and when the SP stops ramping it settles down nicely without much overshoot at all. That might be all you need for your kiln. After we add kii, the error during setpoint approaches zero so your temperature would follow your SP almost exactly, but it introduces a larger overshoot (still only ~3% though). Bit more playing around with the PI-II controller led me to this, just to show you the power of tuning. Feed that with a step SP change though and it'd go a bit crazy - you can't have your cake and eat it too. I'd suggest you to try something like this even with a made up plant just to get a ""feel"" on the coefficients.  And I was probably wrong when I said you don't need ki - you most likely would need ki > 0 to achieve a stable loop response with PI-II.  EDIT: added improved response"
AskElectronics,3bsihg,Denmarkian,2,Fri Jul 3 07:12:34 2015 UTC,There are ways of doing it mathematically.  Your algorithm is basically a negative feedback loop and you can translate that into an equation. I'll have to fetch my control theory book to remember the names of the analytical steps.

AskElectronics,3bsjlj,_ryu_,3,Thu Jul 2 05:13:09 2015 UTC,"well, it seems a RS232 device,  you better get any oscilloscope (even a cheap DSO) and check the signals. A stable Mark[1] signal should be -10V (from the TX to the matching Rx) an open Rx could be anything (mostly 0, but it also could be that -4V which also could mean ongoing communication)... a Space[0] should be +10V but as the RS232 line is idle in Mark[1] most of the time, you hardly have a +10V reading (as this could only happen when the main processor is dead before the Max232)  what I don't get is, are both the HMI and the controller communicating and working? or not?  if they don't work but they should, maybe the TX/RX signal is mixed, (if you can, check both MAX232 from both sides, the TXOut should go to the RXIn on both ways irrelevant from the pin name on the controller case/db9 pin ['cuz some people name the trasmitter pin as Rx for the hmi or stuff like that])  if they work, but you want to replace the HMI with a computer or something, do you have a software for this controller???  maybe trow some names and links here and there on /r/plc. If you don't have the software (and even if you have) I suggest you to make a RS232 Serial Sniffer, for that you need two serial ports (could be two RS232 to usb converters) and make a cable like this one(there are some variations with a diode an a single serial port) and use terminal software like RealTerm to check the communication, firstly you need to determine the baudrate, (that's easier with an oscilloscope but you can try changing on the terminal) the type of frame (7-8 bits? parity? stop bits? also easier with an oscilloscope) and finally try to understand the communication protocol (if you are lucky it could be an ascii protocol but most of the time it's a binary protocol which you can check with RealTerm)  maybe its Modbus RTU? it's easy to check the timing before a frame, and see if you get an address, a size the data blocks and a CRC  if you have a software you can still use this to check if it sends the same data as the hardware HMI and debug your configuration...  most of the time the HMI act as a Host, inquiring data from the controller(s), if there isn't a HMI the controller should be on standby until some HMI ask for data... in that way, the HMI is constantly asking data and occasionally sending data to the controller, if the HMI doesn't receive a response, it can assume comm lost or controller failure...  commonly it could be 9600,8,n,1 but you can't discard any other variation from 1200 up to 57600 for a healthy ATmega  all of this assuming you don't have more information that you already posted :p"

It depends on why the tests are failing, 4 wires to a two contacts will not help contact resistance, only eliminate lead resistance, 4 wires to 3 contacts will improve things.    previous job was in semiconductor testing, They regular used kelvin connections for testing and were landing two probes on 15 micron pads, so it can be done its a mater of how much is it worth.   One thing with die probing is that the pins are quite a bit different form a pogo pin. the needle is at about a 30 degree angle and mounted on a beam that is effectively like a 4 link suspension. The obvious reason is access to the die but the more important reason is there is the tiniest amount of ""scrub"".

With a 4 wire configuration a set current is forced through the dut and the voltage is measured by the other pair. The leads caring current will will develop some voltage, the contact resistance will also develop a voltage. this voltages will not effect the current passing through the circuit. Now if you sence the voltage at the tester(ie in two lead configuration) all of those voltages are added to your reading and are computed as part of the resistance value.  Now move the sense wire to have to separate contact to the DUT. The will also have lead resistance and contact resistance but it is presumed that the sense lines are high impedance so no current will flow in or out of them. They are just reading voltage. Since no presumable current will flow across the sense lines, those resistance will not develop a voltage, and will not affect the resistance measurement.   In the scheme of things lead resistance can be nulled out as long as it remains constant. It is contact resistance that changes every insertion that will not do.

AskElectronics,3br1nl,limpkin,5,Wed Jul 1 13:32:49 2015 UTC,"If these are electrolytics then this is normal. Electrolytic caps have to be ""reformed"" if they've been unused for a long time.  If you redo the test you'll likely find that the initial leakage is much lower."
AskElectronics,3br1nl,MaskedEngineer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:18:38 2015 UTC,"That is correct, and that was exactly what I was looking for! Thanks a lot!"
AskElectronics,3br1nl,Construct,3,Wed Jul 1 15:24:09 2015 UTC,"Very cool project. I'd love to see some pictures.  Electrolytic capacitors have a neat self-healing property in which some of that leakage current builds up aluminum oxide in the leaky areas. The longer you run leakage current through the capacitor, the more aluminum oxide is built up in the leaky areas.  This effect is more pronounced on very old capacitors that haven't seen charge for a while, which is what you are seeing here with your old 10uF cap."
AskElectronics,3br1nl,Construct,2,Wed Jul 1 15:21:54 2015 UTC,Thanks for your kind words and the info! I'll actually soon publish an article about it.... and maybe run a kickstarter campaign.    Cheers!
AskElectronics,3br1nl,intronert,4,Wed Jul 1 15:25:06 2015 UTC,"Best of luck!   .... and maybe run a kickstarter campaign.   Another word of unsolicited advice: Become close friends with someone who has good manufacturing experience before you go this route. The number of electronics project kickstarter campaigns that fail miserably due to underestimating the complexities of manufacturing a product (and associated testing, compliance testing and certifications, supply chain management, freight, packaging, inventory management, shipping, order tracking, customer support, returns, and refund requests) is sky-high right now. Having worked at startups and participated in Kickstarter projects before, I can say that as an engineer, designing the product and making it work was the easy part."
AskElectronics,3bqray,FelixTRX,2,Wed Jul 1 11:43:21 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you might not even need another relay. If you have a switch capable of handling whatever amperage that light bar draws you could run power directly through that and to the light bar.   However, I suspect that to avoid legal troubles, you'll want that switch to not be accessible in the passenger compartment, so mount it in a trunk or under the hood."
AskElectronics,3bqray,jet_heller,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:30:08 2015 UTC,Don't run things like this through a switch directly. Use relays that can handle the current.
AskElectronics,3bqray,ikidd,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:18:14 2015 UTC,Ok. You're going to have to explain the difference between a switch that can handle the current and a relay that can handle the current.
AskElectronics,3bqray,jet_heller,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:14:30 2015 UTC,"While you can do it, generally the practice is to do high current operations with a relay. Switches that handle high current are relatively expensive and in limited styles. They also tend to get warm, and it's good to keep potential fire hazards out of the cab. That's why the relays are in the engine compartment. Relays also switch without much bounce, and aren't as likely to arc."
AskElectronics,3bqray,ikidd,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:38:55 2015 UTC,"I already stated that if he had a switch that controlled a light that legally should only be on when high beams are on then the switch shouldn't be in the cab. The heat was the 2nd reason for that, but not a big deal."
AskElectronics,3bqray,jet_heller,2,Thu Jul 2 14:43:42 2015 UTC,"You could add a parallel leg to the control side of the relay with a switch. That way the control side of the relay gets power (or ground depending on how you wired it) when either   A) The high beams are on or  B) The manual switch is closed  If you want to get really fancy, you can wire  the manual switch through the neutral safety switch of the vehicle so that it can only close the circuit with the vehicle in park. You can use this to make a diagram and I can offer suggestions from there.  Edit: I'm going to say this even though I hope I don't have to, but for the love of god make sure you use a properly sized fuse when you start adding custom wiring."

AskElectronics,3bqray,Ru5tybike5,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:06:17 2015 UTC,"S2 makes the light bar selectable, rather than just coming on every time the brights are on. Legally it has to be switched.

AskElectronics,3brvbg,ethnicallyambiguous,3,Wed Jul 1 17:22:08 2015 UTC,"I think I see what you're getting at but I think you might be a little confused in your logic.  This is how your parallel LED circuit will look (ignore the values and the text, and obviously yours will have 5 leds).  You want to current-limit each LED individually (here's why, if you're interested).   Because you're wiring them in parallel, the all have the same initial voltage Vs = 9V. Using this equation, you can find the correct resistor. The LEDs are rated for 30mA absolute max, so you should really drive them a little below that or you might burn them out or shorten their life quite a bit, 20mA should be a pretty good starting point and plenty bright (you can move up from there a little if you really need to but, if you really need them to be a lot brighter, you should get LEDs with higher output capabilities).   With that equation:  R = (Vs - Vf) / I = (9V - 2.1V)/ (.020A) = 345 Ohms  But it doesn't need to be exact as we have some leeway at 20mA. 330 Ohm resistors are pretty common resistors (and may actually be 345 Ohms are generic carbon resistors are only ~5% accurate) and would give an estimated 20.9mA current.  So your circuit should be the circuit in the first, but with 5 leds, and 9V battery as power source with 330 ohm resistors in place of the 140 ohm ones."
AskElectronics,3brvbg,anonworkacct,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:42:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks. The bit I was missing is that it's 30 mA MAX and what's considered a ""common"" resistor size."

The wizard is trying to steer you to the next rounded-up (E12 resistor value) because E12s are a teeny bit cheaper and more plentiful."
AskElectronics,3brvbg,iso700c,2,Wed Jul 1 18:43:04 2015 UTC,"Use a single resistor per LED, as any variance in LED resistance could mean one sinks more current than the rest."

AskElectronics,3bqto6,stuner,3,Wed Jul 1 13:10:36 2015 UTC,"with wear leveling i get into the situation where it considers 1 cycle as full 16GB write?   More or less. It appears that SD cards fail after you've written about 10TB of data to them (Source, Plot). That would ammount to about 2E10 total writes (assuming 512 byte sectors) or about 618 years at 1Hz data logging. That should suffice for most applicatins, just make sure you get an SD card with wear leveling."
AskElectronics,3bqto6,_ryu_,3,Wed Jul 1 13:26:07 2015 UTC,"Remember, you write in 512 bytes blocks, and you can use a FAT implementation (like Elm-ChaN's) that physically writes a sector once it fills a 512b ram buffer, also it's intelligent enough to skip used but available blocks until they're really needed...  But even there I suggest you to commit the FAT table (f_sync) every now and then so you don't lose a lot of data in case of malfunction... (closing or sync'in a file commits the fat and could be considered an extra write but most sd already consider this extra wear..)  Now, remember that RAM memory doesn't wear off so it doesnt have the same problem... but your flash memory has an erase cycle limit, if you are only executing code from it , you don't have to worry for 10 to 20 years, bur if you are writing the flash by code, then, yes, it could wear down it, in that case look for eeprom memories that have 1 million erase cycles... as an anecdote, whoever thought that having a 100k erase cycle to develop and debug your code in an application isn't enough, have met with electrical and functional errors that rendered theirs circuits unusable, way before reaching that 100k limit...  Finally, if you manage your used/unused blocks you can consider a full 16GB write as a single write cycle, as you thought..."
AskElectronics,3bqto6,frothysasquatch,3,Wed Jul 1 13:07:48 2015 UTC,"NAND flash (which SD cards are based on) has limited erase cycles per block. So if you're just writing data and not really modifying it in place once it's written, you'll have no issue.  Even if you were to write a block, read it back, modify it, write it again, etc., the control logic on the card implements wear leveling which writes the modified data to a different block and maintains a mapping internally that makes this process invisible to you.  So in short, you have absolutely nothing to worry about."

AskElectronics,3bph3r,dc880610,5,Wed Jul 1 03:35:41 2015 UTC,"Wow, you're really aiming high here for your first serious project.    Are these the best components for this concept?   Choosing the ""best"" components for the project is a substantial undertaking if you actually plan on designing this for manufacturing. You'll need to evaluate the components from many different angles, including power budget, voltage rails required, physical component size, availability, lead time, shipping restrictions (batteries), and so forth. It looks like you've picked components that will work, but picking the ""best"" components for your application is a serious engineering undertaking if we're talking about actually manufacturing a product that you need to support.   Advice on designing the circuit?   Again, this is a relatively large engineering undertaking. This is far past the realm of Arduino-scale connect everything with jumper wires and piece together code snippets until it works. Designing and matching a proper bluetooth antenna, on flex circuit no less, is a serious challenge, for example. I'd recommend using a chip antenna there. The wireless charging is another serious undertaking, because it's not as flexible as you might expect.  You haven't actually told us what you're trying to achieve with all of these parts, but I'm guessing it's some sort of wearable tech or similar given your emphasis on flexibility, smartphone connectivity, cheapness, and robustness. Engineering a product to hit all of those goals is a seriously heavy lift for an experienced team of engineers with an equipped lab. I'll be honest, it's downright impossible for someone with zero gear or experience to expect to piece a fully-functional, ready-to-manufacture product like this together on a shoestring budget.   Advice on prototype fabrication? What gear am I best to get, and where?   Again, to be honest you're looking far too far ahead here. Your first step is to get some experience working with a project like this at a breadboard level, so you can develop a proof-of-concept and start writing code to support the hardware functionality.  If the CC2540 is your target SoC, you'll want to grab a dev board for that part. This will be the base for your breadboard proof-of-concept. The dev kit looks to be about $300, so start there. You can probably find barometric sensors and IMUs mounted on breakout boards at SparkFun. Get something that's easy to work with first, because your goal here is to get up and running with a demo.  If you can make it that far, then move on to the wireless power and battery charging circuits. Again, purchase the evaluation modules for the parts you're interested in before you even think about designing custom flex PCBs. Wire them up and make it work, but keep in mind that Li-Po batteries can still be dangerous if overcharged, although not as bad as other chemistries.  If you can get all of these eval modules, dev kits, and components on breakout boards wired together and working, then, and only then, should you even think about making your own PCB. Design the circuit and do an internal dev board layout on standard 2 or 4-layer material, because you don't want to be prototyping on crazy expensive flex circuit. Repeat multiple times until the circuit is right.  Then, and again only then, should you even think about doing flex PCB. Making a robust flex PCB that can be constantly moved and that is robust against shock is a very serious undertaking, so you're really going to need experienced help on this one. Also keep in mind that you really can't just solder components straight to flex PCB and hope that the PCB holds up over time with continuous flexing. Any mounted parts are going to pop off over time unless that area is reinforced. This is really difficult problem to solve, and if you look at teardowns of even the flexible wearable tech you'll quickly discover that manufacturers still use rigid PCBs to actually build the circuit. Building a high density circuit like this is a special challenge, especially when you have wireless charging and bluetooth built in, so you'll need an experienced PCB designer who will work closely with fabs.  I don't mean to discourage you here, but I also don't want to give you the impression that this is a starter project. You're best served by picking up some eval boards and playing with those, which might give you some insight into just how much work goes in to making something like this.  Realistically, I'd suggest just grabbing an Arduino and a cheap oscilloscope, and seeing if you're really even interested in the nitty-gritty of electrical and computer engineerings."

AskElectronics,3bph3r,mh512rtyog7d,2,Wed Jul 1 07:06:59 2015 UTC,"Sounds interesting, and quite challenging.  Usually you don't necessarily pin yourself down to the final components too early. Keep your options open in case a sensor doesn't have the low power ability you need, or the manufacturer suddenly can't locate you more than 20% of your order etc. so it's good to have a kind of modular design initially that lets you try alternatives.  Most companies would prototype it first as a proof-of-concept on a pretty big ugly circuit board with test points connectors and bodge wires all over the place. RF sections will be off on a daughter board connector so the RF can be swapped out for various modules. The inertial sensors will be on some little breakout board at the end of a cable, maybe flex maybe not. The battery will be some lithium ion pack with a 2 or 3 pin moles connector. This system will usually need a bench power supply to boot up because you usually don't do development for SOC systems on batteries. Often you can use a Dev board from your SOC manufacturer, or even an Arduino or raspberry Pi, beaglebone etc. It's really valuable to have a working barebones SOC system that you know can be reduced to a known good working state at any time.  Pretty much nobody goes straight from schematic to a end use form-factor build in one step, unless the design is completely trivial. It sounds like you might be trying to build something that goes on a wheel hub or some other difficult spot. If you can test your scenario with something bulkier in large board form it will be an easier way to work.  So you want to break it down into different sub projects like:   main SOC design & Timing & GPIOs,  Power (running, charging, brown out power down, temp monitoring),  sensors (driver development, calibration),  RF,  Display,  Memory (Ram, flash, SD) Buttons/input,  Firmware/OS/BIOS/EFI, application software,  test software/Dev tools,  Industrial Design,  Layout / flex PCBs regulatory compliance / EMI   ... Good thing you didn't mention cameras or audio it gets exponential...  So it's not impossible for one person to get through most of these, especially if there is help and prior work to build on.  If you are going to do any embedded device development at the hardware level, you are going to need some kind of logic analyzer. One that can capture and decide at least 8 channels at once: 4 for busses like SPI and I2C and more for other logic signals. also you want to do a rechargeable device, so you need to study analog power in detail, such as battery charge / run down, behavior of recharging system (current measuring over time), cutoff thresholds, and the power consumption of all your subsystem devices. So you also need an oscilloscope which captures analog phenomena. If you have the budget, I would recommend a Tektronix MSO-3000 series mixed signal oscilloscope. This will be a great 4 channel 100+ mhz scope with a 16 channel logic analyzer built in. I love this guy and his big brothers the MSO-4000s. These are in the $5K - $20K though so maybe you should start with something like a rigol 1054z and a Saleae usb logic analyzer also some engineers on my teams have liked these USBee combination analog/digital pc-based scopes they work pretty good but don't seem to have quite the robustness of an industry standard like tek, but they have their uses. I prefer actual physical knobs on my gear but that's just me. Even with a top end Agilent or Tek unit theirs is unavoidable knob and menu flipping with all the functionality built in now.  I bet you can get pretty far without soldering if you get a good Dev board and sensors already on breakouts."

The transmission line to the antenna can be 50 Ohms with no issues, because the impedance only depends on the ratio of the signal trace width to the distance to the shielding, and the permittivity of the substrate.  That leaves the antenna itself, which already works by being an impedance mismatch (otherwise the power would not radiate outward). 800 and 900 MHz are close to each other, and 1800/1900 MHz are close to the double of the others, so it should be fairly easy to generate an antenna design that performs well at 1800/900 and not-too-bad at 800/900."

AskElectronics,3bmyic,bastinka,10,Tue Jun 30 14:54:20 2015 UTC,"Cheapest solution: the PIC CTMU. Can (supposedly) measure times up to 3.5ps. There is an appnote and a video out there where they build a time-domain reflectometer measuring cable lengths with cm-level accuracy, for $10. Here's one app note explaining its capabilities, here's a video where they display a measuring application.  There is one crazy (impressive!) project where someone used a Cortex M4, some passives and amazing DSP to generate a phase comparison laser rangefinder. Interesting stuff, though I can't say I completely understand how he measures phase.  Finally, FPGAs. There are a few FPGA TDR papers out there that use DACs and ADCs to perform phase correlation or equivalent-time sampling to measure sub-nanosecond reflections. Unfortunately, they use expensive fine-pitch ICs.  The DE0 nano can be used for TDR as well, depending on how much you want to experiment. You can achieve some pretty cool stuff, really bringing the cheap FPGA fabric to its limits. Here's how I tried to do it once (before I ran out of time):   Drive the laser diode directly from the FPGA pins. Use a resistor for current limiting. That is the cheapest fastest way to get short rise times. Get a fast (fast!) photodiode and bias it properly. This can be done with PWM (from the FPGA) and much lowpass filtering. Read the photodiode back using the LVDS comparators. They can do 650MBit/s!   Now, the options split. How fast is your signal? There are three ways to determine the delay:   Feed the inverted photodiode input to the LED output and build a delay line oscillator. Oscillation time is 2*distance/c. You can measure the frequency as arbitrarily precise as you like. Measure the delay between LED on and photodiode on: This can be done with a fast free-running counter (manual counter generation can achieve up to 950 MHz internal counting frequency. Yes, on a Cyclone IV. Arbitrary counter width, 950 Megahertz). Enable the counter while the LED is high but the photodiode is low; calculate the distance from the counter value. Measure the delay between LED on and photodiode on (longer distances): drive a regular old counter with a fast clock (say 250MHz). Sample the signal four times with four 250MHz clocks, each phase shifted by 90° (0°, 90°, 180° and 270° phase offset). That gives you 4ns time resolution for the counter and 1/4th of that (1ns) that can be determined from the four sample lines.   However, these are some esoteric applications of FPGA logic that you won't learn from a household HDL course...  If you have any questions to the above, feel free to ask for clarification!"
AskElectronics,3bmyic,kegelwerfer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:56:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this is awesome information!  Luckily I have an STM32F4 board, but I'm not familiar with DMA. I'll have to dig through the datasheet. Wouldn't the trace length and wire length become a massive issue at 950 MHz? Would I also not use an op-amp to amplify the photodiode signal in photo-conductive configuration? I'll have to see what's available, and I'm not sure what rise time of a photodiode would be ""fast!"" - perhaps in the lower picoseconds? I'm looking to get at least +/- 2cm of accuracy and eventually would want to step this out to a long range (i.e. 100 meters, maybe up to 500 meters if even possible for a low power, 5mW laser diode)."
AskElectronics,3bmyic,kegelwerfer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:02:55 2015 UTC,"Well, the 950MHz is only inside the FPGA, and it serves as a timing reference for the (arguably) slower photodiode signal.  Just to get a sense of the timings - 500m (1000m round-trip) is a total delay of 3300 ns and a factor of 12500 (13 bit).  ""+/- 2cm"" (8cm round-trip) requires 260ps accuracy. That is ambitious, but effectively limited only by jitter (as you can compensate for any internal delays through calibration). With a delay line oscillator you should be able to get this accuracy.  The more interesting question is ""what's the minimum distance""? That is the main constraint that dictates the effort you have to take, concerning traces, components, amplifiers. For instance, a minimum distance of one meter (2m round-trip) has a delay of ~7ns, something your design has to be able to handle. I would guess that you can route this on a standard double-layer PCB, using readily-available fast comparators (though this is up to your personal high-speed routing abilities).  The rise time doesn't have to be that fast - in the PIC CTMU example, they use comparators with a propagation delay of 10ns, but are able to measure times below 1ns. I am not really sure about that, though - try it yourself! (And report back :-) ).  Uh, I'm not sure about the opamp and don't want to tell you anything wrong... I do recall that ""driving"" photodiodes, especially for fast responses, needs a special circuit topology to get the most out of the speed. However, you need to research this, I can't tell you about this. Assuming you don't want a linear transfer curve of light->current, but just a simple ""on/off"" value, a comparator should do the job but be much easier to handle.  Check out the LT1016 datasheet for high-speed comparator layout details and the PIC CTMU schematic/circuit for additional info concerning high-speed measurements."

I use an electric hotplate with a bit of 3mm aluminium sheet on top. I set it to max then chuck the board on. As soon as all the solder has melted properly, I pull the board off and let everything cool down  Furthermore, electric ovens usually have strong IR emission. PCBs absorb IR much better than many temperature sensors, so the PCB can trivially burn while the temp sensor reads a much lower value.  SO the question for you becomes, how do you enforce a reasonable rendition of the reflow profile with the equipment you've got?"
AskElectronics,3bor7f,xitech,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:04:23 2015 UTC,"Are you sure it was 250c? My reflow oven at work hits 280 something c and it's almost a 6 minute run.

I want to make PCB's, like 8, with a resistor on 'em (well, it's more complicated, but the end result is a resistor, with two leads. Just imagine they are transistors).  Now, to combine those different values into one (add them), I need to put them in series, as one does with resistors.  A and B are the connectors on the main board. R1 is the separate pcb. With one, it's easy.  /-- R1 --\ |        |    A        B   But now add a second module on top:  /-- R2 --\ |        |    /-- R1 --\ |        |    A        B   Yes, they are in parallel now :-(  /-- R2 --\ | \--------\                     | /-- R1 --\ |        ?

Your statement ""Obvisously, with a static number of board it's easy to write them serially and get the sum of resistances from the main board."" does not make it clear what you are trying to accomplish.  If you are daisy-chaining a series of PCBs for serial communication, that is one thing. If you are trying to simply determine the # of boards connected via an additive resistance, that is another.  An additional assumption I'm assuming here is that you intend on stacking your PCBs on top of each other, rather than connecting them serially with jumpers.

Also might want to make sure that the smoking dielectric grease doesn't smoke your meat, if that can happen.      Likely the connector that was corroded was the live wire and the other the neutral.

The latter can easily be done with an active filter, with a passive filter it's more difficult."

You need to get the entire led desoldered at once, can also snip its leads off and remove them one at a time. Failing that, if the board can sit flat in a fry pan, slowly bring the entire board up to temperature over a few minutes till the solder just melts on everything and pull the LED off then.

Several decades ago I was in the air force and a piece of equipment was wired switch-first. A friend of mine walked over to the control panel, flipped a power switch on a 1/4 inch thick steel control panel, and I saw a fire ball envelope the top half of his body, with just his feet sticking out from the fire ball. It roasted the eyebrows and hair off him, and shot molten BBs of steel into him. It blew a hole big enough to put your fist through the control panel, all the metal gone. The engineer had wired the power switch straight from an enormous diesel generator right to the switch with the breaker after the switch. The switch shorted to the grounded panel, and BANG!

AskElectronics,3bk7xn,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:44:15 2015 UTC,"It shorted the mains? Yes, that would flip the main breaker.   A panel or box should be locally breaker or fused, and not rely on the big mains breaker. So if the box only draws 20 amps, don't rely on the 300 amp breaker of the whole system.  Another safty hazard I have seen is when people are sloppy about how the cord comes into the box. You need to have a properly mounted heyco or other strain relief so the power cord doesn't get pulled out and cut by the metal chassis hole. That could be another BANG and possible fire.

Apparently, it can stop it fast enough that the worst you get is a little divot.  You'll need a new blade, brake, and pair of pants (if I recall correctly) but that's probably cheaper than an ER visit in the States.

If your application only requires handling serial data, you can get away with a simple software serial port.  Also, bradn has no clue what he's talking about."
AskElectronics,3bjbyw,dave_ee,3,Mon Jun 29 18:51:28 2015 UTC,"Bradn isn't wrong, he's just missing the point and talking about generic ""serial port"" interfacing from a computer. It would be more useful to post a response to his so your critique was localised.   For the OP Bit banging serial isn't difficult once you understand the signal, a uart signal consists of an ""idle line"" being pulled low for one bit length (the start bit) then 8bits of data, then the line is pushed to idle for at least one * bit length (the stop bit)  Diagram here https://www.mac-usb-serial.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/SerialSignal.jpg  The way that hardware uarts work is that they generate a clock 16 times as fast as the baud rate they are monitoring (eg 9600 baud needs a 135600Hz clock).   When the input signal is seen to fall (interrupt service routine!) the timer is started and after 7 cycles there are three samples taken (at time stamp 7, 8, 9). If two of these are zero then the uart assumes it has a start bit, otherwise it aborts.   From this point on it tries to work out the values of bits 0-7 by sampling at time stamp 7,8,9 for each bit and recording the modal value  Finally, it samples bits 7,8 and 9 for the stop bit to ensure the line returns to idle, if it doesn't then it records an overrun and/or throws the data away.   The reason why the 16x clock is used is to allow the line to settle between data transitions and also to allow for some clock drift at each end without damaging the data.    used to be 6,7 or 8 bits of data, but I've never seen anything other than 8 in use ** can also be 1.5 or 2 bit length of idle, if bit banging you might like to consider using 2 stop bits because it gives you more window to do your thing in"

AskElectronics,3bir15,sharpfork,2,Mon Jun 29 15:45:54 2015 UTC,Do you have a strain relief solution in mind to do you expect them to figure it out?
AskElectronics,3bir15,m37driver,2,Mon Jun 29 15:52:30 2015 UTC,Some of the cases for the DB 15 come with a set screw or clamp that holds the wire to the case.  I'm not totally sure what is the best cost to performance ratio.  Suggestion are welcome!
AskElectronics,3bir15,MATlad,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:56:40 2015 UTC,"If the failure mode you're worried about is the cable ripping apart (rather than, say, pulling out of whatever they're soldered into), set screws or cable clamps will not help increase yield or ultimate strength.  In fact, it may even decrease it if the conductors, their coatings, and/or the jacketing surrounding the cable are pinched to deformation (introducing a weak point).  Cables generally aren't meant to be load bearing.  But having said that, 4 kg may not be such a big deal depending on the jacketing, your assembly technique, etc.  It should be a simple enough matter to get a 4 kg weight, tie it to the cord, and see if it'll rip.  Heck, you could probably even come up with a stress-strain curve and test to failure.  When a cable does need to survive breakage, it's usually in the jacketing.  In general, the thicker or tougher, the better the yield / ultimate strength, and the more expensive.  There are industrial cables that are stainless steel jacketed, armoured (like BX) or just run through conduit and hard-wired into place.  Note that if you're producing a lot, most cable manufacturers will be able to supply information found on the stress-strain curve.  Or even tailor it to your specifications.  If you're really concerned about cables yanking out of your assembly (or it's expensive enough to justify), consider using a connector.  You probably can't get a MagSafe, but there are other ones that have similar break-away function.  BUT if you just want them to install the cable clamps, set screws, glands, or strain relief bushings write it into your contract that you want them to install cable clamps, set screws, glands, or strain relief bushings."
AskElectronics,3bir15,bosstronic,2,Tue Jun 30 05:14:59 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you're trying to define 'tensile strength'. If you're considering hanging as much as 4 kg from a cable, its going to be a bit more complicated than making sure you have decent connectors. If you use cheap cable and have that much weight on it for a long period of time, you might find that the cable will start to stretch.   You should probably prioritize having it built as locally as possible if you don't have much experience with manufacturing and this is meant for a performance or industrial application where it's going to see a lot of abuse. It'll be much easier to make sure things are up to your standards if you can visit the assembler and speak the same language as everyone."
AskElectronics,3bir15,whitcwa,2,Mon Jun 29 16:06:54 2015 UTC,I just want to make sure that someone pulling on the cable on accident isn't going to directly stress the solder joints.

This is probably because the force they can withstand would depend hugely on the cable thickness and quality of assembly. The best thing for you to do might be to order a few shells from digikey, solder them up and give each of them a few good pulls. Then you can get an idea of how much force the different types of strain relief can handle and how much they cost. Or you can just let your manufacturer know that strain relief on the cables is extremely important for your product."

AskElectronics,3biqvv,dmc_2930,2,Mon Jun 29 17:19:29 2015 UTC,"Also, it is probably advantageous to reorganize the table, so that its byte contents match the register contents.  It's not a big deal, and usually you can get by with shifting in the program, but if you are getting short on cycles, it is an easy thing to fix to get some speed back.  You can probably just multiply by 26 in whatever you used to generate your tables to make a fixed version."
AskElectronics,3biqvv,bradn,3,Mon Jun 29 17:34:47 2015 UTC,"I'd personally prefer to have the table readable by humans.  In 6 months you may or may not remember what the heck is going on when you're looking at a table with values that don't seem to make any sense, but looking at the code modifying the bits when they're needed will be much easier to recognize what it's doing and why.  The first rule of optimization is don't optimize. The second rule is ""don't optimize yet"". The third rule is ""profile"".  As an embedded developer who's had to deal with other people's PIC code that was ""optimized"", I can say quite readily that I prefer code that's easier to maintain until there's an absolute necessity to do otherwise."

AskElectronics,3biqvv,dmc_2930,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:39:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and at least in assembly you could generate the whole table with a macro loop (is this possible in C/C++?)

AskElectronics,3biqvv,bradn,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:46:04 2015 UTC,"Um, there's no issue with accuracy with using a macro for bit shifting. I don't even understand how it could be.

Personally I think the former is much easier to read.  There are, of course, other ways to do it, including making a spreadsheet or script to generate the table, and checking that in to version control.  If you don't really need 10 bit PWM, you could also just set the 'L' register to zero and only use the 'H' register. That's probably easiest.  If you're tight on code space, you could pack 4 10 bit values in to 5 bytes and unpack them as you need them. That'd be a real pain to implement of course.  In embedded, you often have to choose where the complexity lies, but it is usually in there somewhere!"

I'd assume that throwing a 16-bit integer into an 8-bit register would automatically ignore the top 8 bits (?).  If that's the case, then left shifting the bits by 6 should be good for PWMxDCL.

AskElectronics,3bidcx,My10thAltAccount,5,Mon Jun 29 13:52:16 2015 UTC,Generally the easiest way would be to clean up the signal with some simple analog circuitry (some sort of opamp filter and a comparator/schmitt trigger) then utilize the Atmel's own builtin hardware timers/counters. They're usually hooked up the internal oscillator but you can reconfigure it to count whatever kind of digital pulses that may be present on an external input pin.  The ADC is probably too slow or carrys too much processing overhead for something simple like this.

If you wanted exact currents you could calibrate it ..  you could even power a nano or similar so it gets powered up when the trigger is pulled and log the data into eeprom and remove it via USB later.

That basically means one magnet is attracting whilst the other is repelling which gives the flotation effect. In the base an electromagnet, when powered it creates the field which the magnets in the model can then interact with. Practically you would have trouble using this in a live game as it requires you to also move the base. There are alternatives to the method which the person in that youtube video has done however they are both convoluted and probably expensive.  tl;dr : the base would be too cumbersome for each unit and the power would not last long using a small battery."

I cannot say for certain what levitation you would achieve but i'd estimate 1-2 mm minimum.

Therefore we can ignore it.

I added a little test to the code to detect idle state and print it out, the unit under my sink has an RF modem on it for debugging and a programming header accessible. the max481 in that is idling with rx low also. so thats 2 out if 2. as mentioned, it is not a faulty chip, simply a state where i should not have the rs485 at all, I should never fully release the bus .. I think I will add device addressing, as soon as the tap receives a status character it drives the bus and holds it until its sent an addressed  reply, then release, the main unit does the same and I end up with a bus driven at all stages .. so long as both units reliably receive every time. There is always going to be a small lapse in time no matter how small where neither is driving.  It is actually better to have this period longer than a character time as if an erroneous start bit is detected the receiver will be forming a framing error and may miss the start of a real transmission."

Back when character LCDs were a new and exciting thing, the Hitachi HD44780 LCD controller was by far the most common LCD controller used. As a result, everyone else made their controllers compatible with the HD44780 pinout and protocol.   The result it that many years later you don't really need a datasheet for your specific LCD. Any datasheet for a character LCD with 14 pins will do. The red and black wires are probably just for a LED backlight, so you don't need to have it powered when you start testing the screen.  If you're using an arduino with this screen, you can start here or here  Otherwise, this datasheet should get you going.  If you can't measure Vdd before you set it up in your own circuit, test it at 3V and then try it at 5V. Both are pretty common for LCDs."

For 6V battery:  (per bank) Single LED with a 150 ohm resistor.  Running these LEDs at around 15mA will keep them under the maximum power dissipation spec.

AskElectronics,3bi8i8,whitcwa,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:41:29 2015 UTC,"The frequency I'm talking about is a mere 900 Hz. Any higher than this results in very high relative turn-on and turn-off times.  Any lower than this results in a flickering effect due to the PWM chopping a 50 Hz sinewave. This flickering is unacceptable as we're designing a very precise heat source.  Moreover, it's not the turn-on & turn-off times that are limiting. It's the time needed to charge up the gate capacitance on the IGBT with an extremely low (µA) gate current."
AskElectronics,3bi8i8,speleo_don,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:49:51 2015 UTC,"The 50mA is a ""continuous forward current"" maximum.  There are some things you can do here.  You only need the 50mA on the starting edge of your PWM pulse.  Well, for your lower duty cycles the 50mA would be most/all of the pulse, but for the longer ones, just the very beginning of the pulse needs to be 50mA capable.  Consider sizing your LED drive resistor for a drive of perhaps 30mA.  Then parallel that with a smaller resistor in series with a capacitor.  Design this network so that you have around 50mA of drive for the first 5-10us, with the drive decaying to ultimately 30mA beyond that.  You would probably meet your design objective this way, while coming no where near the 50mA ""continuous"" max current spec."
AskElectronics,3bi8i8,speleo_don,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:47:29 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't the charging of said capacitor use a relatively large part of the current @ 50 mA, thus reducing it's output either way?"
AskElectronics,3bgf7h,Pagal196,5,Mon Jun 29 00:20:11 2015 UTC,"First question, with clean and lead channels, and to Kt88 for power tubes how is this going to be a small amp?  I figure it will probably come in the area 40 to 45 W. Still going to need a cab for that so yes it will be smaller than a combo but head and cab together  probably not smaller than a combo.  Next, I'm not sure I understand your question. Are you going to have separate bass and treble controls for each channel.? Conventional wisdom is at least for the clean channel a gain stage, another words half a preamp tube , Your tone stack, another half a preamp tube for recovery, and then another preamp tube both stages as a phase inverter.   Is your lead channel going to be a distortion channel or just a boost for solos? If you want to distortion channel you're going to have to at least another half tube in there as an extra gain  stage, if you just want boost that can be done playing with The cathode bypass settings on one of the gain  stages in the preamp.  Using Siri on my iPhone so I'm sorry for typos or any other screw ups if these comments don't make any sense.  Edit fix some typos and I want to ask, why 12 a Y7?

AskElectronics,3bgf7h,sambooka,2,Mon Jun 29 02:07:25 2015 UTC,Ever hear of a twin reverb? Very clean and uses 12ax7s.. 12ay7 are usually used to tame an amp that was designed to be a little too gainy.  If you are designing the amp you have to power to decide if you and a lot of pre tube gain. Why use a harder to find and more expensive tube? Use what is commonly available and design the gain stage accordingly.  As for using KT88s.. they are not THE clean tube (but up there) .. and again.. not super abundant... if you use good 6l6s  and you want more clean headroom design with higher plate voltages and a beefier OT. Design your NFB accordingly and use a longtail pair.  (Little known fact/mythbusting... EL34s are actually cleaner than 6L6s all other things being equal and support higher plate volatages (google says up to 800v) than 6L6s but because they are used in Marshalls everyone thinks they are Dirty. Look up what Pete Traynor did with North American EL34s (6CA7s) you will see he was trying to outclean Fender)  EDIT: Disambiguation of 6l6s vs EL34s
AskElectronics,3bgf7h,QuerulousPanda,6,Mon Jun 29 13:51:07 2015 UTC,"Lookup the ax84.com ""firefly"" amp. It uses a 12au7 as the power tube to deliver 1 watt of power. It has switchable boost but no tone knobs. It was a popular and simple project so there are tons of mods.  1watt may seem like nothing, but if you learn the math of amplifier power you will realize that the volume difference between 1 watt and 50watts is very little.   I built a firefly and had it running through an 1x12 epiphone cabinet, or a 2x12 that i also built. The amp was LOUD. Sooooooo loud. Deafeningly loud, to the point where I had to use an attenuator (l-pad) to be able to get the cranked tone because it was just too damn loud to use in my practice space or bedroom.  There was an ax84.com forum member named Alex who toured with the band Becoming the Archetype (99% sure... there was another band calle Alethian too). he used DIY amps, all very low wattage. For practice it was plenty, and on tour he just mic'd the cab.   Building an amp with multiple preap channels and tone controls is not difficult. Wanting to use kt88 tubes and expecting it to be small is impossible.   If you don't believe me that 1watt is enough, you can step up to a class A single ended design using one el84 or 6v6 or even a 6550 and hit the 5-10watt level easily. To get any appreciable volume boost above that you'd need to start pushing 100 or more watts, and you'll be looking at a 50lb amp with 4 power tubes and huge transformers.  Good luck!"
AskElectronics,3bgf7h,QuerulousPanda,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:07:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the information, i dont expect it to be super tiny. jst smaller in length than a normal 100watt head, maybe like 1-2ft long.  Is the kt88 a bad choice for that, or is it the right choice for wanting a crystal clear clean? i think ill end up just doing a clean channel since i use pedals for all my effects anyway"
AskElectronics,3bgf7h,QuerulousPanda,4,Mon Jun 29 03:17:12 2015 UTC,"kt88 or 6550 are well liked in bass amplifiers because they do push a ton of power before they start breaking up too much. If you want a ton clean power, they will do the business. Keep in mind that the two tranformers to handle that kind of weight and power are going to be expensive (probably $100 each or more, from Hammond or Heyboer or some other vendors) and heavy.  Whatever chassis material you use will have to be pretty sturdy. A regular Hammond project box will just rip through with that much weight.   Keep in mind, building an amp that big is gonna be complicated and dangerous. You'll be in the 450-500volt range at least, which will put a serious dent in your day. Layout is going to be important too, otherwise you'll end up with an oscillating mess.   I would highly recommend finding kits or at least some pre designed turret boards or something. A board designed for a basic fender or marshall or sunn or hiwatt design would be appropriate, as you can change components as needed to suit your design. Trying to design the whole layout yourself from scratch will almost guaranteed not work.  Checkout the ax84 forum. When i was making tube amps it was an incredible reference, and as far as I know it is still an active board. It was by far and away one of the best resources out there, besides some individual websites that some people offered."
AskElectronics,3bgf7h,QuerulousPanda,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:30:40 2015 UTC,"I'd like to design it from scratch and have it looked over to insure it will work, just something about designing it myself would give me a sense of accomplishment knowing it's completely unique to me.  also this is the current sketch of what I'm thinking for the front of the amp if it helps. Also per your advice I decided against the kt88 and currently am thinking an EL34, i'd still like the 12AY7's though.  thank you very much for the help."
AskElectronics,3bgf7h,frothysasquatch,2,Mon Jun 29 11:02:05 2015 UTC,"EL34's are a good choice, as are 6l6. The transformers and power requirements will be a bit more manageable. 6550 and kt88's are nice but they're physically huge and use quite a lot of power.  16"" wide .... that's doable for sure but you will have to plan your layout quite well inside, especially with all the tone controls and so on.  It might be worth looking into one of the two-knob tone stacks; there are some pretty powerful and awesome ones that might be a lot easier to wire up, and will save you a lot of space on the front panel. Potentiometers, panel lights, switches and so on are quite large so it might be nice to have some space.  I noticed you don't have a negative feedback (aka 'presence') knob on the front too.. NFB is absolutely critical for helping maintain a good controlled clean tone so not having one on there is quite an oversight I think!  Anyway, front panel design is nice for sure, but you definitely need to start considering the internal layout a whole lot more. The lead dress and positioning of all the components on your turret boards or whatever is gonna be what makes or breaks your amp. If your wires inside are too long you're gonna have an oscillating mess.   In any case, I must say, you are biting off quite a significant project. It's totally doable if you have the patience and you do the research and planning in advance. You're gonna be spending at least $250+ in transformers alone, plus more for a quad of power tubes, and another $40+ for just the capacitors, and more for the chassis, and more for the stepped drill bits or punches you need to make all the holes, the materials for the box, and so on... it's going to be a big investment in terms of cost, time, and effort required. Plus the debugging time and so on.  The feeling of turning on an amp that you built with your own hands and hearing it roar is seriously badass though... I'm a horrible guitarist but even putting some crappy power chords through my own amps made it all worth while.   As long as you're aware of the cost and scale of the project ahead of you, it's totally worthwhile and wicked fulfilling. But don't expect it to be easy! I personally built I think five amps.. one ~10watt (2 preamp tubes and a 6550 in single ended mode), one 1watt (2 12ax7 for pre, one 12au7 for power) , a 50watter (solid state preamp based on a RunOffGroove pedal, with a 12ax7+2xKT66 output stage), and two 15watters (copies of the Matchless Lightning, one for me and one for a friend, using I think 3 or 4 preamp tubes and two EL84's). I started designing two more but due to various reasons I was never able to finish them. It was a hell of a lot of fun and heartache, but compared to just buying a Mesa head and going with that, it was a huge money pit.  Oh ... and.. buy a good soldering iron. Some Weller or maybe Hakko soldering station. If you use shitty rat shack irons you're gonna just have a miserable time.   I wish you all the best of luck! let us know what you end up designing, it'll be cool to see another tube monster start breathing fire~"

AskElectronics,3bgf7h,fatangaboo,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:51:45 2015 UTC,"$250 is never gonna even remotely happen unless you find an old amp for cheap that you can gut and repurpose.   http://www.hammondmfg.com/1608.htm Here's a good manufacturer of transformers. They're not the cheapest but they're a good middle of the road.  You're planning 100 watts with EL34's? They suggest the 1650R output transformer. That's $135 from Angela Instruments, and $140-$160 from mouser and other vendors.   Power transformers I'm not sure what the best option is. EL34's use 1.5amp heater current, so that's 6amps already, plus afaik 150ma or 300ma each for the preamp tubes, so that's at least another amp or two. The Hammond 270HX is only rated to 6amps and that's not even enough, and it's $85.   A quad of JJ EL34's on TubeDepot.com is 4x$15, so that's another $60.   Already you've blown way past $250, and you haven't bought a single passive component, jack, tube socket, piece of chassis, or anything. And capacitors... 450v rated 47uF caps are not cheap.  If you want to bring the amp down to a more reasonable cost, you can aim for 50watts or so, with only 2 power tubes. That shrinks the transformers down significantly, but you're still gonna be way over $250. $500 is more reasonable I think, or more.   1/4 and 1 watt resistors, 450v rated caps, turret boards or terminal strips, shielded wire, tube sockets, a big metal chassis, big potentiometers, good quality speaker and input jacks, the chassis lights, tons of nuts and bolts, the plastic things that make the pots look good, all that stuff.. there's a ton of little things.  That's why I suggested a hybrid amp. The power transformer and a kit for a high power solid state amp is not that much money. And, the transformers and parts you need to run a couple of preamp tubes is nothing; you can use $5 transformers from radio shack (or whatever nowadays) to do it. Two back-to-back 120->12v transfomers (dirt cheap) can produce all the voltages you need, heater current for the tubes as well as the high voltage for the preamp plates.   Tubes are beautiful things, but when you want them to start pushing real power, you end up needing a lot of copper to support them, and that stuff adds up quick."

You pay extra if you want the more-yellow appearance that improves color rendering.  The terminology gets a little funny, because people think of yellow/red colors as ""warm"", and blue colors as ""cool"", when actually, something heated white-hot or so hot it turns bluish (think of the actinic hue of an electric arc) is much hotter than something merely red-hot.  So in consumer marketing, ""cool white"" LEDs are bluish, and ""warm white"" LEDs are yellowish/reddish.   But in more technical circles, things are specified by their ""coordinated color temperature"", which relates to the equivalent position on a blackbody curve, and in that case, the yellower colors are around 3500-5000 Kelvin, and the bluer are around 6500-7000."

Have you considered miller effect related problems causing cross conduction?  The second scope shot you posted is showing a clearly miller effect curve, and the p channel fet that is being driven by that is going to be even worse, since it will have higher Qg.  I'd be curious to see a scope shot of the high side p-channel fet gate at 14v, i.e. just before failure."

I definitely just had to google what the miller effect is, so I pretty clearly didn't take that into account.  Would you be able to explain a little more about what it is/how to design around it?"
AskElectronics,3bfncd,triffid_hunter,2,Sun Jun 28 23:23:10 2015 UTC,"I definitely just had to google what the miller effect is   Miller effect: parasitic capacitance between gate and source, and gate and drain reduces switching speed.  Specifically, if the voltage on the drain rises rapidly, a large-ish current can flow from drain to gate through the parasitic capacitance. If your gate driver cannot fight this current, then the mosfet can take quite a long time to turn off.  We design around it by using proper gate drivers to drive the mosfet gates. A gate driver is capable of dumping several amps into and out of the gate to ensure rapid, strong switching.   What is dubious about the gate drive exactly?   Your N-mosfets are presumably connected directly to your microcontroller. Assuming that it has a max output of 20mA and they have a Qg of 50nC, that's a switching time of 2.5us.  Your P-mosfet has a 1k pull-up. Assuming Qg of 50nC and Vm of 15v, that's approximately 3.3us RC time constant, ie it will take at least 10us to turn off - which we can clearly see in your 'scope trace.  For low frequency stuff we can generally ignore Qg, but you've stepped out of that realm and now have to consider exactly how much time it takes to charge or discharge that ~2nF gate capacitance.  Furthermore, there's no limiting on the P-channel's gate voltage. Vgs(max) is 20v, but you've specced this circuit for 24v. That's not gonna work...  Usually, we would use 6x N-channel mosfets and proper gate drivers eg IR2101 (totem pole driver) or A4960 (BLDC controller, external mosfet)"
AskElectronics,3bfncd,euThohl3,2,Mon Jun 29 02:33:07 2015 UTC,"Indeed.  One other miller related phenomenon worth mentioning is dV/dT shoot-through.  Suppose both mosfets are off, the output is somewhere above zero, and the low-side mosfet is switched on.  The output rapidly drops.  Cgd of the high-side p-fet pulls its gate down with its drain, the only thing counteracting that is the puny 1k resistor, so that fet switches on momentarily, allowing shoot-through current.  A datasheet of a driver I'm using claims Low-Side Driver Sink On-Resistance (0.4 Ω) Prevents dV/dT Related Shoot-Through Current.  But OP has 1000 instead of 0.4."

Isn't it 25V? (Also I will likely run under the specced 24V, but would be good to know my actual ceiling).  How does using an N-channel FET high side work? Won't you get rapid on/off or do you drive the gate with a higher voltage than your drain will ever see (since when it goes on, source voltage is drain minus some little bit and you have to stay higher than that)  Also saw your post below and I'm running everything off a benchtop power supply for the time being, so no regulator issues.  And lastly, is there a general rule of thumb of switching frequency where Qg starts to have enough effects that you actually have to pay attention to it?"

I'd recommend designing for the lower Vgs(max) as 20v is very common.   How does using an N-channel FET high side work?   bootstrapping usually, although other (more complicated) techniques are possible too. See the IR2101 datasheet for more info on bootstrapping.   And lastly, is there a general rule of thumb of switching frequency where Qg starts to have enough effects that you actually have to pay attention to it?

At any rate though, those are the absolute maximum ratings and come with the warning: ""Exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.""  If something has an absolute max of 25, it doesn't mean you're supposed to operate it at 24 indefinitely.  It's probably best to keep mosfet gates in the 0-15v range."

Looking at the IR2101 datasheet it looks like you have to supply a voltage for the high side switching that is sufficiently higher than the drain on the FET it's driving?  If that is actually the case, this setup seems less appealing to me since my motor voltage is going to be the max voltage I supply to anything (I know I could step it up, but I'm highly space constrained on my board and already pushing the limits), so is there any drawback to using a high side P-channel/low side N-channel setup like I am now and just modifying it so I use the proper drivers and get my switching time way down?"

No, where did you get that idea? The schematics on page 1 are fairly clear..  You only have to supply it with ground-referenced 10-15v (use a 7812 for 24v operation).  This charges the bootstrap capacitor via the diode while the low-side mosfet is on, and the capacitor supplies power for the gate driver when the high side mosfet is turned on."

AskElectronics,3bfncd,whitcwa,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:45:53 2015 UTC,"I suspect the floating part of it is what's confusing me.   Yes probably.  When the low-side fet is on, the floating bootstrap section / high side gate driver is grounded. The capacitor charges via the diode from the chip's supply voltage (10-15v).  When the low side fet turns off, the entire high side gate driver floats. The charged capacitor continues to supply power to it, just like an isolated power supply.  When the high side fet turns on, some energy is transferred from the bootstrap capacitor to the mosfet gate. The high side gate driver's ""ground"" is connected to VCC, so the capacitor is providing the VCC + 12v required to drive the high-side gate correctly.  The gate driver IC internally handles level conversion between the logic input and the high side gate driver."
AskElectronics,3bfncd,triffid_hunter,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:19:49 2015 UTC,"Yup that makes sense now.

AskElectronics,3bh5vv,bradn,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:24:52 2015 UTC,"In the case of a mosfet with 4 terminals, the mosfet itself acts kinda like a relay.  But for various reasons, this is rarely available as a discrete device.  In principle you can emulate a relay which supports bidirectional current with two (standard) mosfets back to back (but it is tricky to control them in that configuration).  If current only needs to go one direction though they vary between braindead simple to use, to slightly harder depending on if there is a suitable drive voltage available.  The crash course to understanding them, is that the source pin is the reference voltage to the mosfet (a sort of ground if you will).  The gate voltage relative to that controls whether it can conduct.  N mosfets conduct when the gate voltage is higher (by some amount according to the mosfet parameters) than the source, and P mosfets conduct when the gate voltage is more negative than the source (again by some amount).  The gate pin looks like a capacitor connected to the other pins and never conducts besides charging capacitance (at least, not without high enough voltages to damage it).  But one part that complicates this, is that most mosfets only block current in one direction and look like a diode in the other direction (between the source and drain pins).  N mosfets can block current when drain is higher than source, and P mosfets can block current when drain is more negative than source.  The simple configurations are using an N mosfet to control a negative supply to something (ie, switching the ground to it), and P mosfets are natural for switching positive to something.  Other possibilities exist, and it is common in high power devices to use N mosfets for the large currents (they are more efficient per cost due to how the physics of the devices work).  There's tons more resources out there from web pages to youtube explanations, but hopefully this gives you some basic info to start with!"

I looked up the power supplies in the meantime, and they're really just 'dumb' 2-pin power supplies with no special features that would get in the way, so this will work.  The cord and connector on the AC side isn't a problem because the replacement PSU would come with its own anyway, so all you need to do is connect the two existing DC-side power connectors to the output of the replacement power supply, either by cutting and splicing, or by making your own Y-adapter with the correct female connector on one side and the NUC/display male connectors on the other.  As for the power supply itself, there's plenty to choose from. Most hardware manufacturers get their power bricks from either Delta (ADP), Fortron (FSP) or LiteOn (PA), and you should probably stick to those as well.

AskElectronics,3begkd,farmdve,2,Sun Jun 28 13:47:51 2015 UTC,"The magnitude of an inductors impedance, which is kind of like resistance, is based on the inductance and the frequency of the electricity supplied. |Z| = 2 pi f L, where f is frequency in hertz and L is the inductance measured in Henrys.  Now look at that equation and compare it to high frequency signals and DC signals. As frequency increases to infinite, the inductor's impedance approaches infinite. At DC the frequency is 0, so the inductor's impedance is 0 so it's a short at steady state. This is how filters utilize inductors.  The reason I said steady state is because inductors are storage elements. When DC is applied at time = 0s, the inductor ""sees"" a changing current in that instant of time. Going from 0A to 1A would in fact be an instant change in current so the inductor would have impedance associated with it during that split second. Inductors like to keep current the same just as capacitors like to keep voltage the same. When an inductor has constant current flowing through it and the power supply is suddenly removed, the inductor will create a huge voltage spike to maintain the current. This is how automotive ignition coils work.  You can work some RL circuits using the inductor equations or differential equations to figure out exactly what an inductor would do at a specific point in time in a DC circuit.  Inductors store energy in magnetic fields, and capacitors store energy in electric fields.   Edit: I'd also like to add that when dealing with electronics, engineers specifically try to avoid using inductors for many reasons. They are expensive relative to transistors and capacitors, they are usually very large, they induce current into other parts of the circuit creating noise and all kinds of other issues, and their tolerances are wide. There are situations where using inductors cannot be avoided though."

AskElectronics,3begkd,Krye07,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:54:27 2015 UTC,"How's your calculus and complex numbers? Only need basics...  First off, V=L.di/dt is the fundamental equation governing inductors and inductance in the context of modern electronics.  If V is constant, then I must increase forever in a linear fashion.  In practice, there's only so much current that a given inductor can handle, beyond which it ""saturates"", ie stops behaving like an inductor and instead behaves like any other bit of copper wire. Typically this causes some other component to emit fire, and is usually undesirable.  If the inductor is used as a DC choke or something like that where the current is limited by external factors, as the current grows, V drops and eventually they balance out in some sort of equilibrium. If the load suddenly changes, then V spikes, the current begins to shift and with a little time it finds a new equilibrium.  However, when we feed it an AC sinewave, the math spits out something interesting.. Essentially, the current forms another sinewave that lags behind the voltage sinewave by a quarter of the sinewave's period.  That time period divided by the sinewave's period gives a phase angle (90° for a bare inductor), and if we feed these two offset sinewaves into ohm's law, we get a complex resistance known as impedance.  The impedance is different for different frequencies - but note that the inductor doesn't actually change depending on the frequency - rather, the impedance is different for different frequencies all at the same time.  This means that multiple combined frequencies can be separated from one another, like the bass boost in your sound system, or the tuner on your radio.  Also note that this is a result that shakes out of the math when you feed V=sin(x) into V=L.di/dt and solve for I and R, the inductor does not magically know that you're feeding it AC and change how it works.  It always just follows V=L.di/dt."
AskElectronics,3begkd,triffid_hunter,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:31:52 2015 UTC,"With pure DC, an inductor is basically a low value resistor. When you pass  pure AC through it, it will resist the AC more than it did with DC. We call that ""inductive reactance"", and it goes up with frequency.  Now, many circuits with inductors have DC with an AC component as well. Inductors can be used to pass the DC while reducing the AC."
AskElectronics,3begkd,whitcwa,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:06:07 2015 UTC,"In Very simple words. in case of DC, Frequency is zero. When you apply voltage across a pure inductive circuit, then according to  Xl= 2 (pi) f L  if we put frequency = 0 then the overall Xl (inductive reactance) would be zero.  Now come to the current, I = V / R and in case of inductive circuit,  I = V / Xl  If we put Inductive reactance as 0, then the current would be infinite (Short circuit)...  So, If we apply DC voltage to a pure inductive circuit, The circuit may start to smoke and burn."
AskElectronics,3begkd,EE-Engr,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:19:55 2015 UTC,"As electric current is passed through an inductor, it creates an electromagnetic field, should be regardless of whether it's AC or DC, right!?   Yes, it creates a magnetic field either way. And that magnetic field stores energy.  But in DC, the magnetic field isn't changing.   With AC, the magnetic field is reversing polarity just as often as the current through the coil is. And in each cycle it stores energy and then releases it again.   The storing and releasing of energy to/from the magnetic field causes all the effects you know about when an inductor interacts with other elements in an ac circuit: filtering, phase shift, etc.   I assumed it's used in DC circuits with direct current as well, to resist the rapid changes in current,   There are no changes in current in a DC circuit, at least the way ""DC"" is used in circuit theory. DC means the currents and voltages in the circuit never change.   (Other fields may use ""DC"" to mean the current always has one polarity or the other, but it might change in magnitude. In circuit theory we'd use Fourier decomposition and say that the current has a both DC and AC components. Then we'd analyze the behavior at each frequency separately. We'd call the equivalent circuit for the DC component the ""DC circuit"" and the equivalent circuit at each AC frequency the ""AC circuit"", both referring to the same actual circuit)"

AskElectronics,3begkd,Althaine,7,Sun Jun 28 14:15:36 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. This is why highly inductive loads (like motors) can be difficult to work with sensitive electronics - if you try to change the current, the inductor resists the change by inducing a voltage across it. These voltage spikes can be very large if the current is changed very quickly.  I'm going to leave aside the precise definition of DC as /u/thephoton has covered that and look at three cases - sinusodial AC, constant DC and a circuit that exists in the steady state and then instantly switches.  Let's look at it from the mathematical definition of the inductor - the voltage and current in the inductor have the relationship:  v = L di/dt   If we were working with a sinusoidal AC current:  i(t) = I0 sin(w t)   Then the voltage across the inductor looks like a sinusoid as well, but shifted 90 degrees in phase:  v(t) = L d(I0 sin(w t))/dt = w L I0 cos(w t)   Notably, this means the instantaneous power delivered to the inductor is:  p(t) = v(t) * i(t) = w L I0^2 sin(w t) cos(w t)   If you average this out over time, the average power delivered is zero.  If we have a constant DC signal, this is the same as an AC sinusoid with frequency w = 0. Then obviously the voltage across the inductor is 0 and the inductor just looks like a piece of wire.  Now, let's look at a signal that has switching components.  For this to be physical we have to have a circuit with some resistance R. Then suppose we have a current source that starts at i0 at t = 0 and then instantly turns off. In this case we have a differential equation:  L di/dt + R i = 0   Which has solutions of the form:  i(t) = i0 exp(- (R/L) t) v(t) = - (R/L) i0 exp(- (R/L) t)   So the current (and voltage) decays exponentially down to zero.  If we were to force the current to 0 by cutting the wire, this is similar to making the resistance R incredibly huge, so you can see how the voltage spikes very high."

AskElectronics,3begkd,thephoton,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:04:38 2015 UTC,"You're taking a very strict view of the definition of DC, to the point where it's impractical and unrealistic.  Even DC circuits have to be turned on and off, which introduces impulse transients to the circuit.  In addition, DC circuits have to deal with all sorts of transient behavior, such as the effects of digital logic switching on and off.  If you were to apply your strict definition of DC, it would exist on paper only, which confuses the issue for the OP and many others.  It's more appropriate to have this discussion with regard to real DC circuits as opposed to ideal."
AskElectronics,3begkd,Capaenni,-2,Sun Jun 28 16:31:14 2015 UTC,"I specifically said that I was giving the definition from circuit theory.  Many concepts from circuit theory never actually exist in the real world: ideal voltage and current sources, perfectly conductive connections between elements, and truly dc circuits, etc.   Nonetheless circuit theory is very useful for predicting the behavior of real circuits in certain limits.   And if someone told the OP that inductors are not used in DC circuits, then then the circuit theory meaning of ""DC circuits"" was the sense they meant it in. So it's useful to explain to OP what those people meant when/if they said there's no inductors in DC circuits."
AskElectronics,3begkd,thephoton,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:37:53 2015 UTC,"And yet when the OP tried to clarify by pointing out that some components might suddenly draw current, you shut him down by saying that that wasn't a DC circuit.    This has a negative effect on his understanding, in no small part because it's incorrect.  Aside from the examples I gave above, a DC circuit can have part of itself shut off, which is turned on later.  This will absolutely change the current draw and introduce transients, which makes his query perfectly relevant.  Even in circuit theory, DC circuits can experience transients.  I'm not talking about electrical noise, which is modeled as an AC source.  Any DC circuit that switches transistors on/off is subject to transient responses.  For these transient conditions, the DC state is treated as the steady state - but the fact that there are transients doesn't disqualify the whole circuit from being considered DC, even in circuit theory."

I don't mean that other ways of defining ""DC circuits"" are wrong. I mean that there is a definition of them used by some people in a specific subfield that doesn't allow for transients, and it's only in that context that it makes sense to neglect inductors.

AskElectronics,3begkd,hardolaf,0,Mon Jun 29 04:35:12 2015 UTC,"Faraday's Law of Induction states that a change in magnetic flux produces a current. If you are sending a DC current through an inductor, the magnetic flux isn't changing, it is staying constant.   If you send DC current through an inductor, once it enters steady-state, the inductor pretty much acts as a closed circuit until the current is shut off. This is because the flux is not changing.   If you send AC current through the inductor, the changing magnetic flux produces current in the inductor that makes the actual current change more slowly. The current wants to remain where it is at the moment, kind of like inertia but in an electrical sense. If the frequency of the current is high enough, and the current has no bias, the inductor essentially acts as an open circuit.   Edit: Oops, I got the closed and open circuits mixed up."

And now that I'm thinking about it, I know the signals I'm feeding to it will be fine with that - I regularly manipulate signals with less sophisticated circuitry and this is not accurate 1V per octave pitch tracking. The issue is getting the most control range I can while protecting the CPU.  So input inline resistor, then scaling divider pot before the diodes to bring them down from clipping, and diodes before the op-amp, feeding the blend pot. And thank you on the TL97x front! I can't find many synth CV circuits using them but they seem perfect. TL972IP are less than $1 at digikey and mouser.  It'll lose some more of the input voltage but it'll be worth it to keep the synth.

The main reason for this is that the first thing on the input path is a 3.3k resistor.  Even with the potentiometer all the way up, and ignoring the buffer amp, etc. 3.3k is still the minimum input impedance.  To get any appreciable current through there is going to take a LOT of voltage, and even then, more of the power will hit the resistor than the diode.  (To a quick and dirty approximation, the diode drops the last 5.1V and the resistor drops the rest; they have the same current so the power is divided proportionally to the voltage drop.)  If the 3.3k resistor is rated for the usual 1/4W, you're good up to 34V, which seems fine to me."

AskElectronics,3bcog4,bradn,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:41:59 2015 UTC,"1) The real cheap ones usually only go up to a few amps like the one linked.  Better ones are out there but they're more expensive and larger usually.  2) Yep, just need to keep in mind current limits.  Also it is not a bad idea to derate the current limits unless the converter has some airflow to it (if it's in a box the heat may be trapped, also if it's exposed to engine heat).  3) Only really applicable to AC.  DC-DC is best done with a boost converter for these kind of power levels.  There are isolated switchmode converters that do use transformers internally, but it needs a circuit to make oscillating voltage to put through the transformer.  But here you don't need isolation anyway.  Wiring tip:  If it works out that you can put the converter after the related power switch, it's not a bad idea.  It will reduce parasitic drain on your battery.  But the main thing is you want them powered after the ignition (drain when the bike is off is when it's a problem).  Voltage adjustment:  Best to use a multimeter to measure output.  Normally a 12V system runs at 13.8V but you can adjust it down a little if that's tolerable to you."

Can this be modified to be a 2nd order PID?  Or can you point me to a computer algoritm that implements what you are talking about?"
AskElectronics,3bdcvt,furtivefox,2,Sun Jun 28 19:46:54 2015 UTC,"That's a very convoluted PID implementation for a simple application. There is no reason for you to go into that complex and non-intuitive formulation with all the coefficients having different meanings to the textbook kp, ki and kd (Look at eq 6: k_n and p_n are actually different sums of kc, ti and td). A simple PID loop (without integral windup or things like that) would be something like:  # initialisation pi = 0  def loop():     err[t] = setPoint - X[t]     pp = err[t]     pi += err[t]     pd = err[t-1] - err[t]    # or higher-order differences if you really need it     Y[t] = kp * pp + ki * pi + kd * pd   For a type-2 control system you need a second order integrator - let's called it pj. It can be defined as:      pj += pi     Y[t] = kp * pp + ki * pi + kd * pd + kj * pj   Tuning the coefficient kj might be difficult though and I don't think there are many resources out there. But as long as your performance requirements (rise time, settling time etc.) are not too difficult then you can probably arrive at some fairly conservative coefficients pretty easily. This code is much easier to understand and it's easy to translate between a block diagram/transfer function and the code.   For your kiln you probably don't even need the D term since you don't seem like you want very quick responses. Heck, even a normal PI controller might be sufficient. Take a look at figure 2 from my original link - are you fine with the type-1 system response? It converges to a fixed offset to your set-point ramp and the offset is inversely proportional to your ki. If you're fine with that then all you need might just be a conservative PI loop and ramp the set point incrementally. Otherwise if you want the response to follow your ramp exactly (after some time anyway) then you can add in a second order integrator.  EDIT: Oh and in case you're wondering why people usually recommend type C over B and A - yes it responds ""nicer"" when you have a step set point change, but the tradeoff is that it (and type B to a lesser extent) assumes that the set point is a constant. With type A, when the set point changes the controller's P and D terms react to it immediately, but types B and C effectively smooths the transition and ramps the set point, hence giving a ""nicer"" response. This is typical of most industrial control where you want to keep the thing at one of a few setpoints, but it's not valid and can even be counter productive for your ramping requirement. PID tends to be overused by people who often don't understand the theory or limitations behind it. It is definitely not the be-all and end-all for control systems.  EDIT2: My first Reddit Gold!

One last question: I assume the reason for the integral being a running sum over all history is ease and speed of execution.  But I'll have plenty of time between samples, and I'm doing it in python, so using a sliding window of samples would be easy.  I feel like this would help when transitioning from a ramp to a soak (constant temperture) by letting the old integral be incrementally forgotten. Is that a good or bad idea?

AskElectronics,3bdcvt,euThohl3,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:37:16 2015 UTC,"No an integrator is defined as integrating from t=0 to infinity. If you use a sliding window you effectively have an FIR low pass filter instead, your DC gain would not be infinite and your controller is not a PID anymore.

Basically you take one voltage of DC and modulate it at high frequency with a transistor switch. This HF AC gets put through a transformer to step the voltage up or down. The secondary output is then rectified and filtered for the final output.  That said, it would be much easier, safer, more efficient, cheaper, and compact if you just purchased the correct motor for the power you have available.  Designing power electronics is a big step up; you have to deal with mains line safety, heat dissipation, heavy gauge wiring, custom PCBs, and inevitably smoking $50 chips. It's best to start small with breadboard level projects that use the same principle but run off a 9V battery.  There are two main categories of high DC equipment. 180VDC hardware is designed to be ran directly from rectified 120VAC out of a wall socket. 12VDC or 24VDC hardware is designed to be ran off car batteries. It is best to just use the correct one to begin with."
AskElectronics,3bbri0,Oiman,4,Sun Jun 28 15:03:54 2015 UTC,"So that motor you listed is capable of consuming 720 watts of electricity, that's basically one horsepower.  Just because it can take up to 180 volts, doesn't mean you necessarily need to drive it with 180v.  Have you tried spinning it with 24v?  I guess it would consume a fair bit more current when driven with 24v, at 4a it's only about 100 watts but that's still a good amount of kinetic energy. An electric bike needs about 250 watts though. So with this motor you are going to need to push about 60 volts. Could you manage 5x 12 volt batteries? 4Ah 12 batteries aren't that big and heavy.   Get a DC motor controller rated for that load: http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Reversible-DC-10-60V-Motor-Driver-Speed-Control-Governor-Soft-Start-H-Bridge/2038585700.html  Then use some potentiometer throttle or an arduino doing PWM or something.  Another way to make the higher voltage would be to build your own poor mans unregulated inverter: feed your 24v into an (15A+) h-bridge that you toggle with a microcontroller at 1khz or so. Feed the h-bridge output through a reversed 24v mains transformer. Now you have unregulated 120v AC. Rectify it with a suitable bridge rectifier. Add a really big capacitor of suitable voltage rating. Now you have ~170 VDC, probably with a ton of ripple but it's going to a motor so who cares.  You can throttle this by PWMing the H-Bridge.  But if you attach this to a bicycle, look out for black vans following you around because you are going to radiate enough RF to cause a regional radio blackout."

There is no obvious 4th pin because if you add DSR, RTS, CTS they aren't useful individually. It could be V+ but that's not common.  Looking at your board pic (please can you take a high res pic of the other side of the board)  The header you circled is very close to a big covered area which is obviously RF section, with mini coax cables going to antennas made of copper PCB traces (this router must have crummy range with these $0.0001 antennas, kind of a shame because the RT3883 chip above can do active beam forming which is some hot shit. Maybe it is used to make $0.0001 antennas perform like $0.1 antenna. Imagine if it was connected to actual $1 antennas?)  But it's pretty clear the header isn't carrying any RF on those pins.  there is something interesting about the 4 pin header: the conspicuous two series resistors on pins 2, 3.  Can you measure the resistance of R53, R54? If these are close to 33 ohms, then I think it is usb, because the chip they go to is an RT3883 which has USB 2.0 host and client capability  Checking a low res pic of the reverse side of the board makes it look like the 4 pin header goes through he two resistors, then on the bottom traces they go to the RT3883 chip. The pic is crummy so I can't tell if they are straight or trace length matched (wiggly) which would tell if they were differential, what freq, etc.  RT3883 summary sheet (slow site) / mirror Also shows it has UART, so serial is possible) The other place you commonly see two resistors on a header is I2C, for pull-up resistors. These resistors would be 4.7k - 10k in most cases. The datasheet shows SPI flash, but SPI doesn't use any resistors usually.

They are used as part of EMI filters on the mains input. A transformer would have 4 or more pins. Photographing the context (ie: the parts around it on the PCB) would help."
AskElectronics,3bd6pg,VK2DDS,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:41:06 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I don't have the PCB any more. It has 7 pins, 3 on one side and 4 on the other."
AskElectronics,3bd6pg,classicsat,2,Sun Jun 28 05:30:29 2015 UTC,"Then it is a switch mode transformer,and most likely custom.   Basically worthless without the PCB it is from, or its specs, which are probably not published as a custom part.  The 4 pin side is the HV side, a drive winding, and a separate winding to provide continuous low voltage for the control IC.  The LV side is probably a dual winding transformer set up for 5 and 9 to 12V outputs,with regulation feedback from the 5V side."
AskElectronics,3bd6pg,VK2DDS,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:38:41 2015 UTC,"Then my vote got to a switchmode transformer. They can have multiple outputs for a variety of reasons; some can be used just for feedback isolation, others can just be there to get more than one output voltage without having to use linear regulators.  Exactly how it was used depends on the switchmode circuit's topology, there are lots of them!  Edit: being a switchmode transformer it will be designed for a high frequency, perhaps 10-20kHz, maybe more. As such it will have very few windings compared to a transformer designed for 50/60Hz mains and, as mentioned above, will rapidly burn out if connected to mains. Incidentally this is one of the big advantages of switchmode circuits: higher frequency means smaller transformers (or plain inductors) which use less copper resulting in lower cost. It's also the reason why aircraft apparently use 400Hz AC."

AskElectronics,3bcguy,speleo_don,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:41:22 2015 UTC,The 1/2 factor is if the voltage and current are RMS peak quantities.  Edited to be correct.
AskElectronics,3bcguy,Althaine,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:47:32 2015 UTC,"No No No!!  .... but I see the point of confusion here how.  If the PEAK values of I and V are what is known, then you need the 1/2 factor because the peak value of each (I and V) is sqrt(2) larger than the RMS values.  So when you multiply I and V, you are essentially muliplying (1.414)Vrms times (1.414)Irms.  You then need to divide by 2 to remove the (1.414)2 factor.  However, IN THIS CASE, I and V are already RMS -- so the 1/2 factor should not be included.  The convention is that 16V<45deg means 16Vrms at 45 degrees.  If the voltage source was stated as 16sin(Ø+45) degrees instead, that would be an example of the PEAK being specified instead of the RMS.  Is this clear?"
AskElectronics,3bcguy,speleo_don,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:56:09 2015 UTC,"Right, sorry, I got that the wrong way around.  I was trying to explain where the 1/2 factor might have come from (you didn't mention the difference between RMS and peak values in your first post) and I got it exactly opposite of what it was supposed to be.  As an aside OP if you read this, the RMS value of a signal is defined such that it will give you the same energy/power as if you had just used a DC signal of the same magnitude. For a sinusoid the integral comes out to give a factor of 1/sqrt(2).  So a 230VAC RMS signal delivers the same power to a resistive load as a 230VDC signal.  Later when you look at non-sinusoidal current waveforms, you'll still be able to break the current into RMS values for each harmonic frequency and you'll find power is only delivered for the component of the current waveform with the same frequency as the voltage waveform."

This setup would also allow each speaker to receive more power. To ensure the amplifier isn't being ""overdrawn/pushed"", I may put a fuse (or two, a fire with this could turn deadly) rated at the reasonable safe current directly from the battery to the amplifier."
AskElectronics,3bcgqx,Linker3000,2,Sun Jun 28 03:55:43 2015 UTC,I don't really know.  I'm pretty new to this stuff as well.
AskElectronics,3bcgqx,MrRobogoat,2,Sun Jun 28 22:55:17 2015 UTC,"The Lepai will do just fine. I own one and can't drive it loud enough to distort audibly. THD is a trickier measurement than audiophiles and salesmen would have you believe. The point at which harmonic distortion becomes audible depends on which harmonic it is, and some even sound good (only reason tube amps and to some extent vinyl records are still a thing). Also remember that 1W (defined as 2.83V, technically) into a typical loudspeaker will yield >80db at 1m. If you want it to be loud,  look into improving that number first and foremost. After the first watt, SPL (volume in decibels) increases by 3db for each doubling of power. So from 85db at 1 watt, if you drive it at 16W you will get 97db. Now look at the OSHA charts on hearing damage -- specifically, how long at a certain level it takes to achieve permanent damage. I think from that you will be able to figure out that the Lepai will be plenty. ;-)  To improve efficiency, get more / better drivers: Selenium (now owned by Harman through JBL) makes some good cheap drivers. The 8PW3 (8"", 8 ohm, 92db efficient) and 10PW3 would be decent, they were on clearance at parts express last I knew. Probably higher quality than the car audio drivers you're considering(JBL makes fine professional products, the consumer / prosumer stuff seems to be priced by the badge more than the quality), they generally have inferior thiele small parameters due to the nature of their application (thiele-small parameters will determine the size of your box). You do need to meet the minimum impedance specs for your amplifier, because of V=IR. Smaller R draws more current, which blows up your output devices. Putting drivers in series / parallel is an acceptable solution. Parallel you get a 6db boost to the efficiency and half the impedance.   For the battery, start by determining how much power you will be drawing (in amps), on average, then multiply by how long you want to run for. This is the amp hour rating you need. 90% is a good conservative estimate for the efficiency of the Lepai. The current drawn over time is directly proportional to the signal it's amplifying. Using the 20W number will probably oversize your battery by a lot. To get a better estimate, start by measuring how much current the amp draws while playing into dummy load. Use a charger appropriate for the type of battery you end up with. Usually a specific battery line well have a charger for it, check with the place that sells the battery. Batteries are chemical devices and can be serious safety hazards if not treated right (we're talking acid burns, explosions, and / or fire hazards here.).

The whole circuit has only sixteen components; why spend ten hours diagnosing it when you can spend one hour replacing it.  If that offends you, I suggest you replace all five transistors with brand new parts, all at the same time.  After you remove the old parts and before you install the new parts, you can use your digital multimeter to test whether the capacitors have infinite resistance (as they should), whether the diodes pass the DMM diode test, and whether the ohmmeter agrees with the schematic about the resistor values.

A good new power supply is EUR 10. Is that worth burning your computer? (not necessarily while modifying it; my power supply burned later when I used it)  But if you do:  See that big-ass capacitor? It stores charge. Don't touch its terminals. Just in case, short-circuit it first for a second (with no power applied!).   Should I use resistors to lower the voltage to 12v (I have plenty of those laying around)?    If you do make a new voltage divider at the output, keep the power dissipated at the (standalone) resistor in mind. You maybe need those big white-ish box-shaped ceramic resistors, not the tiny ones that will vaporize if you run (15 - 12) V 3 A through them (that is safe, though, and kinda fun to watch).  Do NOT modify the transformer part with the yellow tape on it under any circumstances. If you damage it (say while replacing the resistor at the switch), do not use it anymore. Do NOT short-circuit the transformer by accident.  (God, do I sound like a killjoy. But seriously, don't)   Or should I go for something more like a regulator or diode? I feel like I should also be putting a 12v fuse to protect my computer.   A normal diode will eat 0.7 V. You could put 4 of them in series at the output and set 15 V to get 12.2 V. Isolate the terminals and don't touch their terminals while the supply is powered.  But I agree with speleo_don, just replacing one of the resistors next to the switch should be enough. To find out which and by what, just measure their (unmodified) resistances, then try to get the equations to work with the voltages on the label (if in doubt, ask). Caveats above.  Seriously, a new PC power supply which can do both 5 V and 12 V and 300 W is EUR 20 - or fish a broken PC out of the trash and extract its power supply.  But if you do modify it, just be honest with yourself - if you screw up and damage something, stop using it. It's not such a big deal when done properly.

AskElectronics,3bajso,trimatrix,3,Sat Jun 27 10:19:21 2015 UTC,"I would use something like a max399 multiplex.  Connect the output of the rs232 transceiver to the common of the mux.  Then hook up your mcu to one of the muxed ports, and another transceiver (or the second port of a dual transceiver) to another one.  This will still require an additional ""out of band"" connection to the mcu to control it.  If you want to simplify things, you could just use an mcu with two uarts and two transceivers, then handle things in firmware.  If you make use of interrupts and dma to handle the mirroring, you should see very little appreciable lag.    However, this will require your software (on the computer) to be able to handle the extra commands being thrown around on the same serial bus, which probably will require custom software."
AskElectronics,3bajso,AngularSpecter,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:50:11 2015 UTC,This looks like an interesting solution to the problem.... From what the documentation of the LIDAR tells me is that all the computer software does is store the data to a log file and sends command. So with this solution seeing how everything is sharing the same bus I would just have to go back to the log file later and create a script to get rid of the commands the arduino sent that the computer might have captured.
AskElectronics,3bajso,AngularSpecter,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:36:21 2015 UTC,"Well, if the arduino is sending commands to the lidar, those won't sent back to the computer (unless you write the firmware to do that).   The problem becomes, if your logging software is using the serial port,  you won't be able to send any commands to control the arduino over that same port. So you either need custom software or to use a second channel"
AskElectronics,3bajso,cynar,2,Sat Jun 27 21:51:33 2015 UTC,"Easiest way is a pair of transistors and a second MAX232.  The second MAX232 brings the computers signal down to TTL levels. This is then fed into the original MAX232 via a transistor. The arduino is tied to the transistors to turn comms to the computer on and off. When the arduino is out of use, just set the serial port to high and it effectively drops off the line, allowing the computer signal through uninterrupted.  The other option though is to use a Leonardo and a USB link to the computer. The Leonardo shows up as a comm port anyhow, and has a separate serial out. Just have a mode in software that passes all commands from the USB serial to the hardware one and vice versa. It will add a very slight bit of lag, but that should be so small as to not effect anything."
AskElectronics,3bajso,cynar,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:13:48 2015 UTC,The second MAX232 idea seems intriguing and I will look into it. The other idea sounds great and was initially my first idea but the only reason why I have the computer in the first place is because it has a high speed capture card on that serial port.

AskElectronics,3b7kpu,sprash,7,Fri Jun 26 16:42:12 2015 UTC,"Your circuit has two problems:   DC block caps for a not dc-free signal is not a good idea. Switch the clocks for DC supplies at 5V (""RS232"" idle voltage) and let the simulation run for 10 real-world seconds. See the problem. Also, if both sides are low/high, your ideal comparator has precisely the same voltage on both pins and is therefore at ""0V"". However, resistor imperfections will turn ""both sides equal"" into either ""this side is a bit higher"" or ""that side is a bit higher"". A few mV difference will be enough to trigger the comparator into either level. Even if you had perfect resistors, variations in supply voltage will be enough source of uncertainty. Change your simulation resistor values randomly, around 5% (standard resistor tolerance), or your drive voltage, and see what happens. Also, switch the square signal sources with logic inputs and toggle manually.   Now, on to an alternative solution. The problem is relatively simple - there's really only four cases:   local low, remote low: line is at 0V local low, remote high: line is at 1/2 VCC local high, remote low: line is at 1/2 VCC local high, remote high: line is at VCC   So what you need is a window comparator that tells you the state of the line. If the line is at 1/2 VCC, the remote side is the opposite of your level, otherwise it is the same.  Here's a simulation that does exactly this. Works symmetrically on both sides (exercise left for the reader).  ""Long wire"" - be aware that you have to use weakened drivers on both sides of the cable. The high capacitance of a long cable, coupled with 500 ohms resistors, can really ruin your bandwidth. Worse, it can cause glitches with the XOR gate. This is best debugged with a scope...  Debug questions:   What logic drives this cable? (Microcontroller?) What length are you looking at? What baud rate do you wish to obtain? ""Real"" RS232 (+-12V levels) or 5V TTL levels?"
AskElectronics,3b7kpu,kegelwerfer,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:06:46 2015 UTC,"What logic drives this cable?   On one side there is a plain old industry PC . The other side is an old pump control interface. As far as I can see basically a Max232 plus a bunch of 74xx logic and an EEprom.   The point is, so far we only controlled the pump (basically just turning on and off) and ignored the output of the interface. However the unit spits out error codes/events and you can read out the speed which is really nice to have.    What length are you looking at?   100m+ shielded coax wire running a complex path through the building. (Therefore ""just"" add another cable is rather complicated). If all else fails I will try to use this cable as 10Mbit Ethernet and put a PC on the other side.   What baud rate do you wish to obtain?   So far we are using 9600. I don't think we can change that.

Generally, look into RS485 for long-distance buses with multiple drivers.  Half-duplex would require some sort of collision detection/frame syncing. If adding logic (read: microcontroller) to the far end is an option, it could easily be performed in software; otherwise, you would have to do it all on the PC side.

AskElectronics,3b70mw,wolfcry0,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:23:24 2015 UTC,BLHeli is a firmware? One of my SimonKs has murder on the mind so it needs reflashed. Is there a possibility to flash to BLHeli? Ive got all the reflashing tools.
AskElectronics,3b70mw,dexx4d,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:30:43 2015 UTC,"Yup, BLHeli supports a ton of ESCs so you probably can reflash   Here's the list of what it supports: https://github.com/bitdump/BLHeli/blob/master/Atmel/BLHeli%20supported%20Atmel%20ESCs.pdf"
AskElectronics,3b70mw,DrTBag,2,Sat Jun 27 17:32:57 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on the size of the ESC you're using.  I use an 80A ESC for a RC truck that would do the job quite nicely, I think.  Maybe start with a cheaper ESC and see what happens?  Then build up to more powerful ESCs if you don't get the wanted results.    I'm interested in seeing your results, especially when it is tested to destruction."
AskElectronics,3b70mw,FuturePassed,2,Fri Jun 26 16:54:21 2015 UTC,"Yes, I was curious a few years back and tried it. The hardest bit it connecting it, you have to solder some wires onto some recessed pins. I just bent them and soldered, but if you want something neat that would take a bit of work.  I'm not sure how fast it went. I seemed fast, but I had no way to measure it. I'm not sure if there will be enough torque to do much heavy lifting."
AskElectronics,3b70mw,twerps,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:34:28 2015 UTC,"I don't know the specifics on driving it with a speed controller, but in no-load conditions the motor will be running at a ""no load"" state (the only load is the moment of inertia of the spinning parts). The RPM will be related to the voltage and the current draw will be relatively small after a short inrush to get the motor up to speed. Your idea of using a current source with adjustable voltage is probably the simplest method."

That 7805 only powers the shift registers and an octal buffer on the board."
AskElectronics,3b6in4,stuner,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:00:57 2015 UTC,"I pretty much have.   Great, post the schematic then so everybody have a look."
AskElectronics,3b6in4,stuner,0,Fri Jun 26 12:03:42 2015 UTC,"Haven't got one, only a mental map.  All you need to know (and this is mostly useless anyway) is that the anode is powered through the named resistors from a current-sourcing Darlington array with Vs from the external connector.  The cathode is powered through a sinking Darlington array with a COM COMMON from the same external connector. No components on the board other than the 7805 can give me any more idea as to what the voltage could be.  I did mis-understand you with the LM7805 though, though you meant that it was powering the displays. Obviously you are referring to the limits of the input voltage."
AskElectronics,3b6in4,stuner,2,Fri Jun 26 12:12:55 2015 UTC,"I know the resistor for a segment is ~1.6 ohms, and for a segment ~180 ohms   It's probably 1.3ohms for the segments and 180ohms for the decimal point. Plugging that into the equations you would get a supply voltage of around 8V."
AskElectronics,3b6in4,LobsterSoulSandwich,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:58:06 2015 UTC,"Still, both equations should give equal values. My main thing is that the currents for the segment and DP probably shouldn't be equal, but no sane value fits there to bring that to around 8 volts."
AskElectronics,3b6in4,neuralnoise,2,Fri Jun 26 12:04:13 2015 UTC,"Still, both equations should give equal values. My main thing is that the currents for the segment and DP probably shouldn't be equal, but no sane value fits there to bring that to around 8 volts.   No, the result doesn't have to be exactly the same. The display will also work if the current is a bit higher/lower than 20mA. The current for the DP and the segments should be the same, but the voltage is only half because there are two diodes instead of four.  You should of course also trace out where this supply comes from, there's probably a ~8V regulator on the board."
AskElectronics,3b6in4,Dasmoofler,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:17:37 2015 UTC,"I have nothing but this board. Look, here's a picture. Best I can get, sorry (this is why you don't buy a $150 phone). That header on the right with the cap is the one I mention. The ICs to the left of the resistors are the sinking Darlingtons, and the IC below the rightmost resistor bank is the sourcing one."
AskElectronics,3b6in4,Dasmoofler,2,Fri Jun 26 12:23:10 2015 UTC,I think we're talking at cross purposes. I don't really see your question. This board seems to be power by an external 8V regulator (somewhere else). You can find out which pins carry this voltage by tracing out the emitters of the driver (darlington) pnp transistors with a multimeter.
AskElectronics,3b6in4,toybuilder,2,Fri Jun 26 13:01:15 2015 UTC,First result from google...  https://www.kingbrightusa.com/images/catalog/spec/SC23-12EWA.pdf  If you look at the forward voltage vs forward current graph you'll get the acceptable values. You can see the minimum forward voltage is 8V not 1.6V
AskElectronics,3b6in4,toybuilder,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:05:32 2015 UTC,"That's the datasheet I got the screen cap from, and that graph isn't of much use since it's the same as the named If in the column. What I really need to know is what I'm doing wrong to get different values from my calculations. I'll edit to make this more clear."
AskElectronics,3b6in4,Dasmoofler,3,Fri Jun 26 12:15:16 2015 UTC,"Everyone else has most of the pieces. In the DS, p4 top left graph shows the If (forward current) vs Vf (forward voltage). This basically says that a given current through LED requires a certain voltage.  Continuing with that, the LED with a higher voltage drop will require the smaller resistor, so you switched those around.  Finally, you're assuming that the resistors they selected will give the exact same current through the device (20mA). This probably isn't the case. If it's in a slot machine, they wanted to make them as cheap as possible, so they selected resistors that would get them roughly the same value for the 2 different LED types.  You can assume we're working in a linear region of the LEDs (otherwise we'd see very little). From there, the slope of the graph is about 4.5V/A at 20mA. This is pretty consistent for both of the graphs/LEDs. The V offset of this line is 3.91V and 7.91V. In other words, v = 4.5i + 3.91 for the dot and v = 4.5i + 7.91 for the segments.  Using this, 1.6 Ohms, 180 Ohms, and solving for the answer, you get a giant equation of v_1=v_2=4.5i_i+3.91+180i_1 = 4.5i_2 +7.91 + 1.6i_2 And you can then assume i_1 is 20mA, you get V= 7.6V and i_2 is -50mA. That doesn't make sense, so let's assume i_2 is 20mA, then V=8.032V and i_1 is 22mA. You could also plug in some values of V and get other i_1 and i_2. But you have to check and make sure that the current is between 10mA and 45mA, because outside that, the LED blows up or we loose linearity and our solution doesn't make sense.  This is a lot easier way of solving this problem. The other way would be to use the full diode model, which is an exponential equation, and lot tougher to solve. Plus we don't want to use it in its non linear region so there's no added benefit."
AskElectronics,3b79fh,BobLeeJagger,2,Fri Jun 26 15:19:34 2015 UTC,"It should work just fine. Take positive and negative right and positive and negative left and wire them as you need. However a few things. 1: why the 1/8"" Jack? (technically what you mean by a headphone jack) why not just use phono outputs since more speakers will have inputs for them. Or just use a 1/8"" Jack without bothering with the phono ends. A stereo 1/8th Jack has a tip, a ring, and a sleeve. Iirc the tip and ring are positive, and the sleeve is ground. Just wire L and R negative to the sleeve and positive L and R right to the tip and ring (which one is which doesn't matter. Just one to tip, and the other to ring)"
AskElectronics,3b79fh,Jcsul,2,Fri Jun 26 17:06:53 2015 UTC,"Be aware of line level vs speaker level.  If you want to pipe audio to another device like home theater receiver or external amplified speakers, you need to tap into the LINE signals before the IC.  That is the better thing to do because that speaker amp chip is probably no more than 5 watts per channel.  If you want to use the onboard amp to drive speakers you'll need to use balanced connectors as you CANNOT mix the amplified speaker grounds, so TRS headphone jack won't work.  You could check the IC's datasheet to verify whether or not that is true."

I could design it so 50% capacitance is ""enough"" for the circuit, and put one of each on.  Unless both brands fail, the board should keep working, and as time goes on I'll probably get some boards back and be able to pull the caps off and check their health.

Correct way is to use kapton tape to cover the plastic and components on the board, leaving open only the soldering area. Then use a thermostat controlled heat gun, turn it up to ~350 degrees, and turn the air flow down to about 30% to avoid blowing away your solder. flux the joints, heat the connector/pins, lift the connector, then add some solder and clean the pads on the motherboard with isopropyl alcohol, then heat the pads until the solder melts and drop in the new connector.

AskElectronics,3b3ox9,whereTehPandas,8,Thu Jun 25 18:34:57 2015 UTC,"The ULN2003 and ULN2803 aren't LED driver chips, they're just transistor arrays. It sounds like you're planning on doing your current-limiting using resistors, which is the least efficient way to pull this off. And really, when you start dealing with 3W LEDs, you're going to have a tough time dissipating all of the heat from those resistors in the first place.  For high efficiency, what you really need is a constant-current switching regulator. This is much more complicated than just using a resistor, but for 9W of LEDs you're definitely going to want to go this route unless you really want to have large resistors on heatsinks.  Unless you really need to control the channels independently, I'd put the LEDs in series and look for a constant-current LED driver that operates in boost mode."
AskElectronics,3b3ox9,Construct,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:25:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Do you know by any chance if I can take a standard buck converter and turn it into a constant-current driver? My original idea was to set a buck converter to a voltage just above the diode drop voltage of the LEDs, so I would then get a very small voltage drop over any current limiting resistor."
AskElectronics,3b3ox9,Construct,3,Thu Jun 25 20:53:50 2015 UTC,"The problem with using a supply voltage near the forward voltage of an LED is that small changes in supply voltage or even LED forward voltage (think temperature changes) will result in large swings in current through the LED. You can't just use an arbitrarily-small resistor and hope that things stay regulated enough. You actually need a not-insignificant voltage drop across the resistor to keep regulation in check.  There are ways to make a standard buck regulator work in a constant-current mode, but you have to be careful to make sure you don't accidentally make the regulator unstable in the process. You need to find the feedback pin of the buck regulator, which is usually attached to a two-resistor voltage divider between the output voltage and ground. Measure the feedback voltage at this pin during steady-state operation. The regulator will increase and decrease the output as necessary to keep the voltage at this pin constant.  The trick, then, is to make the voltage at that pin proportional to the current through your LED string. This can be accomplished by connecting your LEDs through a resistor to ground, then running the voltage at the top of that resistor in to the feedback pin. For example, if your feedback voltage is 0.7V and you're targeting 350mA, you would want a 2 ohm resistor. 350mA running through the LED string and then through the 2 ohm resistor will then produce a nice 0.7V output at the feedback pin, and you have converted your constant-voltage regulator in to a constant-current regulator all while only dissipating a quarter of a watt in that resistor.  Again, I'd recommend putting all three LEDs in series if possible, because then you're only dealing with one resistor dissipating heat."

Connect a large inductor in series with the 20A source. Use a 20A MOSFET that shorts the 20A current source to ground.   Turn on the mosfet so the current source dumps current into the mosfet, not the load initially. Turn on the current source, and wait until your inductor charges up with the 20A. Then, quickly turn off the 20A source and all your current will suddenly be dumped into your load. The high voltage necessary to ramp up the current of your load inductor can be provided by the source inductor.  Turn off the source by turning on the MOSFET and diverting the 20A into ground and away from the load. Then turn off the source.   Come to think about it I think the pulse will turn on fast but turn off slow. A complementary arrangement probably can be thought up to turn it off fast, though. Maybe an RC snubber to soak up that current, or a 0 current inductor. I'll comment again if I think of a better idea to make a fast falling edge."

And smaller transistors give you three things:   The transistors themselves are faster. Smaller circuits are lower capacitance.  What limits the work per joule that a CPU can do is the capacitance of various things.  Each time a wire's voltage is changed, some charge has to flow to charge up its capacitance.  The shorter the wire, the less charge is required, and the faster and lower power the processor. With more transistors, one can build more circuits that do things faster.  Bigger caches, more CPUs, graphics processors, etc.  Finding uses for more transistors is really taxing the ingenuity of CPU designers, and twice as many doesn't give you twice as fast, but 100 times as many does give you 10 times as fast."

Shorter wires do have lower capacitance, but the wires are also smaller and the insulating oxides are thinner, increasing the capacitance.  Overall, making the wires smaller does not change the capacitance as much as you would think.  Using high K dielectrics does help with the capacitance.  Also, thinner wires most certainly have higher resistance.  Overall, the time constant (R times C) of the wires actually doesn't change by all that much between different processes.    Another advantage that you get with smaller transistors is lower threshold voltages.  Since the power consumed by CMOS logic goes with the square of the voltage (dynamic power = clock frequency times capacitance times voltage squared) you can get a significant decrease in power consumption with a lower core voltage.  Current CPUs run with a core voltage of less than 1 volt, though they can draw over 100A on that supply rail at full capacity."

Practically speaking, the best way to ensure even distribution of the current across a rectangular mesh is to evenly distribute the connection points across opposite sides of the mesh. For example, if you were able to somehow clamp the mesh to low-resistance copper bars on either end and apply the current through the copper bars, you would get virtually even current distribution through the mesh. More realistically, you could simply fan-out the connection wires to several points along the edge of the mesh, ensuring that the current is mostly distributed across the edge of the mesh. Depending on the dimensions of your mesh and how even you need to keep the current, you could probably get away with a relatively small number of connection points."
AskElectronics,3azapn,Construct,2,Wed Jun 24 18:41:19 2015 UTC,"And how.   In the long ago I made a program that could show current distributions and vectors in arbitrary conductor and current source/sink surface shapes drawn in paint, and give an approximation of total resistance. Guy at work said the math would be too hard, so I wrote it up in a day. He was a dick.  It was pretty interesting seeing the current distribute through the surface, with somewhat shadowed spots behind holes and whatnot.  The idea is, if you inject the current into two points, the voltage drop, created by the resistance directly between the two points, will act as a voltage source for the area next to those points, and outward. The direction of the vector field of the current flow doesn't change with resistance, only the magnitude changes.  I had forgot all about it. I'll try to find it and see what injecting along the edge looks like. I'm guessing there will be a, probably insignificant, hot spot in the middle."

AskElectronics,3azapn,Construct,5,Wed Jun 24 19:11:29 2015 UTC,"Foil wouldn't have much of a cross-section with which to carry the current, which is key to distributing the current.

How about folding the mesh edge over a few times and pressing it together? Basically, building up the edge cross-section to lower the resistance.  But I'd also encourage you to do some testing with a single connection point first, to confirm that you really do need to distribute the current more evenly in your application. Premature optimization can lead to a lot of unnecessary work. Give it a try as is and do some measurements first. Settle on a target spec and work toward that."

Options include:   Outright omitting them and just having nichrome in one direction, like a toaster. Replacing them with something cheaper and more conductive, which will also solve the spreading problem. Turning the mesh on a 45 degree diagonal, which will force current along all parts.

Now, a lot of simple I2C slaves don't use this freedom and never pull the clock low, but be aware you have to qualify the ones you're using.  So you can just put a high-current driver (the simple one is a 74HC04 hex inverter with one gate driving five driving the SCL line) between your I2C master (and any main-board devices which do need to stretch the clock) and the SCL-powered remote slaves.

Fortunately, if you use a Schottky diode for the power supply circuit, it will keep the voltage difference low enough that the parasitic diodes responsible for latchup never turn on.  If you're limited to three wires, however, a possibly easier alternative would be a series of small microcontrollers with power, ground, and a bidirectional half-duplex RS-232 line."
AskElectronics,3b0xun,cypherpunks,4,Thu Jun 25 03:15:53 2015 UTC,"It might work, but it's not a good idea...  Asking your GPIO pin to charge a number of capacitors may make it sad, and the data high signal will be higher than VCC which many chips don't like at all.  Then there's the noise issue as well...  So do it if you absolutely have to, but 4-wire cables are not exactly rare, and you can always daisy-chain them"
AskElectronics,3b0xun,triffid_hunter,2,Thu Jun 25 02:19:19 2015 UTC,"This may or may not work depending on how much current your remote sensor uses and the size of the cap(s).   SCL to Schottky Diode to Capacitor to VCC pin SCA to Schottky Diode to Capacitor to VCC pin   Make sure your SCL & SCA lines are pulled up to the maximum limit for 100KHz/400KHz I2C bus rates, which is typically 3ma.    You can use either transistors to create a current source or pull-up resistor if the voltage is always the same.  If your I2C bus is 5V, then don't go lower than 1666 ohms on the pullup, and since resistors are exact, you should go higher, like 1.69K or 1.78K or 1.8K depending on the resistor tolerance (%).  uhhhhhh, yes it will create noise, so you would need to create a PI filter to filter out the noise generated by the clock & data lines.  to do it right, the number of parts / costs of those parts / cost of your time will be higher than the cost of extra wire."

AskElectronics,3b1eb6,GTPenguins214,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:10:07 2015 UTC,"Like drugs, flux is better when it comes in a syringe :D  Tack flux is great since it's quite viscous so it helps stick the component in place, and it doesn't evaporate at ambient temperatures so you can do your flux all in one go and then do the soldering. Syringe form is great because it allows you to control the dose very easily. And it's a no-clean flux unlike the one you linked which is water-soluble and it corroded my boards after a few months because I didn't clean it off with water. No problems with this one (it's a bit sticky but won't corrode your joints). No nasty fumes either - in fact the fumes actually smell quite nice - but try not breathe it in anyway"

Watt is power, and what you're looking for is Watt Hour, which is energy.  Not sure how you figured out 0.01851 watts, but you can't figure it out with just physics. The real world will not be able to lift something with perfect efficiency.  A battery will have a capacity that is specified in watt hours, or amp hours. Knowing that number, you can figure out how long a battery will last for a given power output for an specified amount of time."
AskElectronics,3b0gkm,TokenRedditGuy,3,Thu Jun 25 00:28:38 2015 UTC,"Using the limited physics I know, I figured it would take 0.01851 Watts to lift 150kg 2 inches for 30 minutes.    Assuming perfect efficiency, 150 kg * earth gravity = 1471 N.  A force of 1471 N over a distance of 50.8 mm (1 inches) is 74.727 J.  (1 J = 1 N * 1 m)  If you spread that work out over 30 minutes (1800 seconds), it would take 0.041515 W = 41.515 mW of power for that 30 minutes.  (1 J = 1 W * 1 s).  Once you stop moving the object, it doesn't take any more energy.  I have no idea where you are getting 18.51 mW.  74.727 J / 0.01851 W = 4037 seconds.

AskElectronics,3b0gkm,swrrga,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:04:08 2015 UTC,"So you know how to calculate watts, right? (V*I) well now we just need a little more info to get your answer. What is the quiescent current? Meaning, if it's in stand by/not doing anything how much current does it draw. Or is this unit ""always on"" meaning that it draws that 18mW all the time? Well either way we only need 2 conversions. Watts into watt hours. That's easy. If your device draws 18mW while running, that it consumes 18mW hours. Well some batteries lost their watt hours, but the standard in the consumer industry is amp hours. So, we convert from watt hours to amp hours which is the exact same as converting from watts to amps. Divide your watts by your voltage and you get your amp hours. So in this case .018 watts / 9 volts is .008amps or 8mA. Multiply that times 2 (since you said the .018 mw was for half an hour) and you 16mah for an hour. Multiply that by 24 to get how much you need for one day, then multiply that number by however many days are in the 6 months you're looking at, and you're good to go.   However, as another commentator noted, it really isn't that simple to just ""use physics"" to find your power consumption. You need to look at the data sheets for the parts/motor you'll be using and find out how much power all of that will draw, and you should be able to find some efficiency charts on the datasheet as well."

Usually X5R caps offer a high enough capacitance that stays consistent enough over a decent temperature range. But yes, class 2 ceramics do reduce their capacitance by about 50% at half their rated DC voltage and get down to 10% by the time they reach their rated voltage."

Leave your board on for several days before declaring any testing as succesful.  Yeah it'll take more space, another advantage of tantaluns is their small size."
AskElectronics,3az838,cbraga,3,Wed Jun 24 19:01:13 2015 UTC,"So with buck converters, the main things you want to keep in mind for capacitor is capacitance, voltage, rating, ESR, and ripple current rating.  Additionally, it's common to have some large capacitors with a moderately high ESR and also some lower capacitance ceramic capacitors due to their lower ESR.  If you're worried about the output ripple, I've found it useful to simulate the whole circuit in the circuit simulator of your choice.  If you do so, remember to add in the parasitic properties of the capacitor as well (ESR, ESL)!  For the bulk capacitance, I've had success with aluminum polymer capacitors.  I've used some 35V 330uF 7mOhm Al Poly caps recently in a buck converter for a project of mine for about $0.85 each.  About the 100nF cap for the ATTiny85, its purpose is not to help reduce voltage ripple but to mitigate the effects of line inductance.  Essentially, the microchip draws current from the decoupling cap, which draws current from the power supply.  With all the high-frequency switching that's going on in a microcontroller, it's possible for the chip to not be able to source enough current due to the rapidly changing current demand.  The 100nF capacitor placed close to the supply pins really helps to mitigate that effect since there is very little line inductance between it and the microcontroller."

AskElectronics,3az838,Emitcom,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:08:12 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how the math works out on this one, but the point of having small ceramic capacitors is because ceramics have much lower ESR than aluminum caps by a few orders of magnitude.  Just having the bulk capacitance without the ceramic caps has a much higher ripple than with the ceramic caps in addition to the bulk.  In other words, yes."
AskElectronics,3az838,cypherpunks,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:19:19 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand what you're asking that the data sheet doesn't already explain very clearly.  Equations 6 (once you rearrange it to isolate ΔV) and 7 add up to give you total output ripple.  ΔV = Iout × (Resr + (1−Vbat/Vout) / (f×C))  Plug in your proposed C and Resr and see if the resultant ripple is acceptable to you.  There are lots of ways to make it work.  Aluminum polymer or ceramic are the two obvious alternatives.  As the data sheet says, if the output capacitor ESR is very low (below 30 mΩ,which is likely if you use all-ceramic output capacitors), you need to adjust the feedback network to ensure stability.  That means using the adjustable-voltage TPS61030, and placing a small capacitor between the Vout and FB pins."
AskElectronics,3az838,cypherpunks,1 point,Wed Jun 24 22:08:09 2015 UTC,"What I was getting at was that by using the equation I'm getting undesirable values for voltage ripple and was wondering what alternatives I have for the tantalum cap. If I can use a different material then perhaps I can keep the same capacitance with a lower ESR and at a lower cost.  The datasheet didn't say anything about other capacitors in the circuit either so I wondered if those help mitigate the ripple.  However, ""adjustable voltage version"" didn't click for me until you pointed it out. Thank god I caught that before ordering the component, I had a different version in my BOM."
AskElectronics,3az838,cypherpunks,2,Wed Jun 24 23:05:58 2015 UTC,"The datasheet didn't say anything about other capacitors in the circuit either so I wondered if those help mitigate the ripple.   Only if they're of comparable size.  It's probably more complex but you could get a reasonable approximation of the net ripple by dividing the current among the capacitors weighted by value, computing the per-capacitor ripple, and averaging them.  So a 1 uF capacitor with zero ESR isn't going to change the figures you get for a 220 uF cap very much.  Remember that tantalums need significant (start with 2x) voltage derating; a 5C rail should have a 10V tantalum on it.  And as /u/Irrumatus says, high-K ceramics often have a wicked voltage coefficient; make sure you figure out the value at your desired voltage bias."

Ah!  Unfortunately you asked exactly the opposite question.  Not how to get the desired properties cheaper than a tantalum, but could you sacrifice the desired properties: ""Could I use a capacitor with a higher ESR?""  The answer is yes, obviously; you just get more ripple.  (You also generate more heat in the capacitor, as that ripple current passing through that ESR generates heat.)  If a fixed and adjustable regulator have compatible pinouts, I'll often lay out a board for the adjustable, and leave the extra components off if it turns out the fixed one will work."

I think you can safely assume that you can just not use it and use ethernet as normal.  You will need an ethernet PHY as well. A freescale K64F dev board uses a micrel PHY.

AskElectronics,3axlcz,stuner,3,Wed Jun 24 10:05:06 2015 UTC,"IEEE 1588 precision time protocol is a protocol used for sub-microsecond precision time synchronization.  To get this sort of precision, high precision timestamps are required to precisely time incoming and outgoing PTP packets.  This is generally done at the PHY level with dedicated hardware components, hence if you want to implement PTP 'properly' you need a system that supports capturing and processing these timestamps.  Note that PTP timestamps are 96 bit timestamps with 16 bits of fractional nanoseconds - the resolution is on the order of 15 femtoseconds.    IEEE 1588 devices have to be able to communicate normally over ethernet as well, so it will work fine for your application.  Just make sure that the PTP components are disabled or configured so they don't cause any trouble (extra interrupts, etc.)."

AskElectronics,3awxhk,BoltActionPiano,2,Wed Jun 24 04:03:59 2015 UTC,"The load always ""sets"" the current drawn from the supply. If the supply can't provide enough current, some of the following happens: a current limiting circuit trips (e.g. a fuse), the supply is ""blown"", the supply remains in operation but output voltage will be lower (practically to conform with the maximum power it can output).    Now I don't know about mist diffusers but that diode won't be sustaining 2 A of ""reverse current"" constantly. It simply won't be in a conductive state at all unless there is a surge, meaning that the load, most likely inductive, produces a reverse voltage across it, and in case of an inductive load, the reverse current/voltage will only remain until all the energy from the fields around the inductor are dissipated (i.e. for a short while).    Yes, the HPH05001 seems to be a step-down converter. Why use a step-down for the 12 V and not for 5 V, you ask? The basic premise is that using a linear regulator is cheaper, be it in terms of PWB space or component price. If the current drawn from the linear supply isn't high there is no need for a special cooling system and therefore low efficiency is not an issue."

AskElectronics,3awxhk,Jukk,2,Wed Jun 24 07:08:49 2015 UTC,"Current limiting will depend on the application. I suggest reading the wikipedia article for diodes at some point. For surge diodes, limiting isn't done since the component can easily withstand high currents for short amounts of time. For leds, it is done to set the current so that the optical power is high enough and the heat dissipation will remain manageable. It is also possible to drive leds from a current source since the optical power is directly proportional to the current.    But for your specific application the leds are the only diodes that need current limiting resistors."

It exploded in my hand with a bright flash and loud bang. Some LED circuits don't need limiters. A keychain LED flashlight with 2ea 3V cells in series doesn't have any limiter other than the cell's internal resistance. If you put a 6V regulated power supply to the diode the magic smoke would escape."
AskElectronics,3awxhk,I_knew_einstein,2,Wed Jun 24 20:37:58 2015 UTC,"Basically there are two types of sources: voltage sources, and current sources.  Ideally, a voltage source has a constant voltage (say 12V), independent of what current is drawn from it. In the same way, an ideal current source has a constant current (say 2A), independent of the voltage that is needed to make that current flow.  In reality, virtually all sources/power supplies/wall-warts/etc, are voltage sources. However, they are not ideal, and are limited to a certain current. So your 12V power supply always supplies 12V, independent of what current is drawn from it. However, if you draw too much current (more than 4.1A in this case), the power supply can't handle it any more, and strange things will happen (voltage drops/device burns down/blue smoke appears)."

I had one piece of equipment that had a bad 'lytic.  IIRC the particular capacitor was in the 100s of volts range; it was about an inch in diameter and about 6 inches long. We didn't have it in stock, so I order it, and the equipment goes back onto the shelf to await parts.  I updated the job card (no computerization then) as ""needs new cap, no other problem,"" or some such.  Often, when a parts came in, another tech can grab the broken item and continue work.  This was called ""cherry picking,"" because often times the new part would fix the issue, and the other tech would look good for ""fixing"" it, even though all they did was ride coattails on the original tech who figured out what was actually wrong.  This is what happened to the particular equipment I was working on.  As it happened, the person who grabbed it was two ranks higher than me (though not in my chain of command).  She and I ... didn't get along (mostly because the was a bitch).  She promptly installs the 'lytic, and when she fires it up, flames shoot out of the capacitor, and the whole shop fills with an acrid smelling smoke.    She checks the card, sees that I was the one who wrote ""needs new cap"" in the notes, and proceeds to chew me out, loudly, in front of everyone for ""bad troubleshooting,"" and ""being dangerous"" blah blah blah, mostly because she didn't like me.  I took a look at the device, and said loudly ""YOU INSTALLED THE CAPACITOR BACKWARDS.""   It was one of the most satisfying moments of my life to see her mouth shut, and her face change color.  I didn't have to say STFU, because everyone in the shop was now looking at her.  So yeah ... didn't really help our working relationship, but she wasn't quite as quick to dig into me after that.

AskElectronics,3aw26g,Jlocke98,7,Wed Jun 24 00:01:20 2015 UTC,"For low-speed stuff, where the exact path that the wires take doesn't matter, it's not hard.  The schematic generates a netlist, which is file that lists on each line all of the component pins that are connected together in a single ""net"".  Nets may be given meaningful names (e.g. GND, +5V, Vcc, CLK, etc.) or the program will generate one automatically (with a name like $$1532).  Try to assign meaningful names to nets with a lot of connections or that you expect to go a long way across the board (like to a connector), but it's rarely necessary for 2-pin nets from e.g. an LED to its current-limiting resistor.  Anyway, the PCB layout program will check for various ""design rule"" violations, the most important being that all of the pins in a single net are connected by copper and that copper is separated by a minimum gap from any other nets.  You can also assign additional rules to specific nets, like requiring a larger gap around high-voltage nets, or requiring a larger minimum copper width for high-current power supply nets.  Then it's a matter of making footprints for all of your parts (formally called ""land patterns""), arranging them on the screen, and connecting them.  Just like spell-check on a word processor, the PCB layout will flag design rule violations.  These days, a basic PCB has copper on both sides, with plated-through holes.  That means that a small hole drilled in the PCB, called a ""via"", will connect traces on opposite sides.  (Large holes, like for component leads, can also be used for this.)  Getting a neat compact layout that doesn't have manufacturing problems due to small components hidden under large ones takes practice.  But getting something that basically works isn't too hard.  Probably the most common thing forgotten in first PCB layouts is decoupling capacitors.  The simple rule of thumb is to place a 0.1 uF capacitor next to each power supply pin.  (If a large chip has multiple supply pins, multiple capacitors!)  When things get faster, and you have to worry about trace inductance, matched delays and EMC testing, it gets more complex, but if your speeds are below 1 MHz, it's pretty easy.  One thing I recommend is that if you have any degree of seriousness at all, skip through-hole and just start surface-mount.  It's really not harder than through-hole, just different, and there are a lot more components available.  Just buy a bunch of extra components (they're cheap!) to make up for the ones you'll drop, lose, overheat, or otherwise mangle while learning.  I like 0805 components for homebrew, because that's the smallest size that has easy to read component values."

AskElectronics,3aw26g,Jlocke98,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:29:46 2015 UTC,"The answer is everyone's favourite: it depends. In my mind, the most important thing is that there's nothing on the trace in between the cap and the device. If a power trace wanders from the regulator, through the decoupling cap, and then takes a meandering path to the load and has a few branches, you're losing all of the benefits of decoupling in the first place.   Proximity is going to matter more as you move to finer traces as well."

AskElectronics,3aw26g,cypherpunks,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:04:43 2015 UTC,"This is getting into the wonderful part of EE where there's correct answers and there's good enough answers.   If you want a correct answer for your specific board layout, you can use a field solver like Ansys to calculate all of your self and mutual inductances in your board layout and determine how far away the cap could be to still meet your specific requirements. That's going to take a while and cost a lot.   For me, I usually just look at the data sheet and see if they have any recommended values for decoupling, and then place those capacitors as close as I reasonable can to the chip. Most chips where decoupling is a big deal will have their power pins side-by-side, so I just place the cap as close as I can without interfering with neighbouring traces, and route the cap directly to the power pins on the same layer.   If it's a simpler chip (like 74 series logic), I'll put the decoupling right next to one of the power pins, and usually run the trace under the chip directly to the other power pin.   Is my approach guaranteed to produce an optimal result? Probably not. But it's way quicker and cheaper, and I have never run into a decoupling problem using this approach. Once the board comes back I'll hook the scope up to make sure the rails are clean enough.   Edit: there's a great book by Eric Bogatin called ""Signal Integrity Simplified"" that covers a lot of rule-of-thumb techniques that also explains the limitations of these approaches and when you should consider using the expensive approach."
AskElectronics,3aw26g,cypherpunks,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:47:27 2015 UTC,"Could you define what close proximity means?   It all depends on the frequency; as you get above 100 MHz, it starts getting crazy.  Basically, you begrudge millimeters.  Chips that need good decoupling will have adjacent power and ground pins, and that leads to a very natural layout.  Basically, 1 mm (0.040"") either way won't break your design, within 2.5 mm (0.100"") is good, 5 mm (0.200"") is okay, and 10 mm (0.400"") is not okay."
AskElectronics,3aw26g,Jlocke98,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:41:19 2015 UTC,"The caps could be several inches away with no issues right?   Good gods, no!  Several inches away is what we call ""bulk decoupling"": Tens to hundreds of uF for the whole board.  For local decoupling, it's all about the trace inductance; you begrudge millimeters.  At high frequencies, the fact that 7400 series parts put the power pins on the corners caused lead length problems.  Wire length is inductance, and inductance cancels capacitance at high frequencies.  A long trace imposes an upper limit on the frequency at which a decoupling capacitor is useful, even if it has infinite capacitance.  Once you get above 100 MHz, people start using tricks like turning capacitors sideways so they're 0306 rather than 0603.  All to make a shorter and wider electrical path with less inductance.  And soldering them directly to the bottom of the chip.  And doing away with pins because they're millimeters long.   you don't need to worry about that until you are at the .01uf level   All other things being equal (and ignoring obscure things like resonances and regulator stability), more capacitance means lower impedance, and lower impedance is always better for decoupling.  However, all other things aren't equal.  In particular, less capacitance means a smaller capacitor, and the fact that a 0.01 uF capacitor is smaller means less inductance, and that can mean that it has a lower impedance at high frequency despite the lower capacitance.   is it just a best practice thing?   It's a rule of thumb that's comfortably in excess of what's actually needed (without being ridiculously over the top), so you don't have to worry about the details.  If you can't afford the parts, or the space, you can do more careful engineering and cut it down.  Plenty of designs use 0.01 uF per pin instead, but my designs can afford 0.1 uF, so I use that.  It's more than you need, but it's a comfortable margin, not crazy overkill.  The other point I would like to make is that you can get away with a lot more if you have power and ground planes, which provide a nice low-inductance power supply with a certain amount of distributed capacitance.  If you're doing a 2-layer board with routed power and ground, then local decoupling is more important."

AskElectronics,3aw26g,OwlPenn,3,Wed Jun 24 15:23:12 2015 UTC,"Suggestion: put a 0.1 uF ceramic capacitor (not electrolytic, not tantalum) between the V+ and GND lines as close as possible to the chip.  Actually, for one-off perfboard designs, I often put them on the underside of the board directly beneath the IC.  It doesn't really matter here, but I also like ceramic for low-value capacitances (like your 1 uF).  Spec them correctly and they'll be more accurate, physically smaller, and longer-lasting at a lower price-point.  As a general rule of thumb for non-specialized applications, in any case.  EDIT: That 0.1 uF is what's known as a bypass capacitor--it bypasses the need to pull current from the supply in respond to higher current demand or in response to switching (e.g. PWM power delivery, or even something like clock generation).  Useful for reducing overall system noise and increasing system stability."

Make sure they are the same nominal voltage, and roughly the same charge state.  For what you're asking about, the resistor is OK, but make sure that the voltage differences between the batteries, divided by the resistor voltage does not exceed the C rating of either battery.    For example, you have two 3S (2200mAh) batteries (nominal 11.1V).  One is at 12.6V, and the other is at 11.4V.  If you were to connect them with a 1/2 Ohm resistor, then the current would be (12.6 - 11.4) / 0.5, or 2.4A.    This would exceed the C rating of the lower voltage battery; it's usually recommended that batteries not be charged above 1C.    Additionally, the power dissipation of the resistor would be 2.88W, which would fry most ""normal"" resistors.  In short, make sure your batteries are closely matched before connecting in parallel.

AskElectronics,3avc9i,CoroTheCat,6,Tue Jun 23 20:16:45 2015 UTC,"SCR power limits cannot be expressed in farads.  You need to figure out the total resistance and inductance of the circuit and find out what the peak current is going to be and whether the SCR will be ok with that.  Remember that the coilgun will work best if the field is zeroed as close as possible to the moment the projectile passes its center.  Also... you're using supercaps?  I don't think those work so well for coilguns.  The voltage is too low and the ESR is too high.  I think most people use like photoflash type caps, or something else rated for hundreds of volts."
AskElectronics,3avc9i,euThohl3,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:48:11 2015 UTC,"i will scrap the idea of using a SCR, by inductance, do you mean the inductance of the coil? I am still working on making a circuit so, i can't calculate the resistance yet. thanks a lot for help."
AskElectronics,3avc9i,kegelwerfer,6,Wed Jun 24 16:03:19 2015 UTC,"I have some caps wired in series 12v (15v max) and 58F in total.   Gold caps or pulse rated caps? 12V is an awfully low voltage for a coilgun. Normally, you want the coil current to rise as fast as possible. Coil current rise time is (delta i/delta t) = U/L. To get a fast current rise time, you should maximize the voltage across the coil or minimize the inductance. Usual coilgun voltages are around 350V... That is okay, you just need to have a low inductance now. Think welding cable wrapped around a barrel ten times. You'll need thick wiring, because if you want to discharge your 58F caps in 10ms, you need a current of 69.000A (I = C * delta_U/delta_t). I don't think your caps are rated for such currents...    A lot of discharging circuits use a SCR Thrysistor. I found this one[...] I am mostly concerned if it is going to hold up to the amperage, and how many farads can it take before it blows.   Puny 80 amps will spoil your coilgun fun very quickly.   Problem 1: Discharging your caps with 80A will take 8.7 seconds. Not really the time spans you are looking for, you want something much shorter (think less than 100ms) Problem 2: when conducting puny 167A, the thyristor has a voltage drop of 1.6V. That means, of your precious few 12V you have to get your coil to rise, you are losing 1.6V (13%) in your switching element. Problem 3: 80 Amps * 8.7 seconds * 1.6V voltage drop is 1.13 kilojoules of energy. Silicon has a specific heat capacity of 710J/(kgK); the SCR weight 28 grams (rough approximation). 1.13kJ will heat 28g of silicon up by 56°C (Kelvins...)/100°F. Okay, not as much a I expected, but still 128W power dissipation. And *one shot does this! Oh boy.   Okay, back to serious suggestions. If you want to know the peak ""current and time"" your device can handle, you need to look for the I2 t-rating. For your SCR, it is ~10kA2 s (rated for 10ms, nevertheless). That means that for a 10ms pulse, your device can carry 1000A; (because 1000A2 * 10ms = 10k), in a really rough zeroth-order approximation. There's plenty of info about the I2t rating online, so look into that.  In general: If you are switching low voltages, MOSFETs are preferred. The NTMFS5C404NL, for instance, has an internal resistance of 0.75 milliohms. At 80 amps, that is a power loss of 4.8W. If you put two in parallel, you have 1.2W per device (instead of 128W with your SCR). These are cheap SO-8 devices! Now, once you increase the switched voltage to >1000V, you should look into SCRs. Below 100V, don't. (In between, it is a sliding scale)   I have some different caps, so in the future i would like to upgrade the capacitor bank, is there a way to know how many farads the SCR can take? like if i tried to push 125F through it, would it work?   According to my math - no. That depends on the pulse rating of your caps, though. You might have better luck with using two capacitor banks in parallel, to decrease your internal resistance.  If your capacitors can do the pulse currents, you might have more success with a manual switch (think of a spring loaded copper busbar hitting another busbar).   I read a bit about them and from what i understand when you power the SCR on it going to dump all of the energy stored it the caps into the coil before the SCR ""turns off""  again, is this true, and is there a way to only dump half of the energy into the coil? Is there an easy way to turn the SCR off again?   Not really. Yes, there are so-called ""Gate turn-off tharistors"", which are SCRs that can be turned off again. However, they are slow, and the turn-off current is somewhere around one fifth of the current that is to be turned off. So be prepared to pump 16A into the gate to turn you (puny) 80A current off. No, SCRs are basically ""fire-and-forget-until-the-voltage-has-dropped"" devices.  My recommendation: sell the caps! Trade them in for high-voltage ones. Get some fat MOSFETS (if your caps have ~350V) or IGBTs/SCRs (if your caps have >600V) and have fun switching current into your hand-windable, handleable coils.  Though that is by no means meant as a discouragement! Feel free to experiment, but be aware of the math behind it. And as always, don't hesitate to ask if you feel like you still miss something."

AskElectronics,3avc9i,kegelwerfer,2,Wed Jun 24 15:58:00 2015 UTC,"Do you have a datasheet for your supercaps? When choosing energy storage methods (like capacitors), you generally have to decide between high power and high energy. Supercaps tend to be heavily on the ""high energy"" side, sucking very much at ""high power"" applications.  Putting caps in series has the problem that their peak current stays the same, you only have more voltage (good, but now the caps are the bottleneck and not the coil).  Before you buy any capacitors, you should try to calculate the other electrically relevant parameters of your coilgun. What are your physical constraints, what sort of wiring (thickness) do you want? What sort of inductance values are achievable? Keep in mind that to discharge 7.75F@108V in one second, you need 840A. So I think your capacitors are way oversized.  EXCEPTION: MOSFETs can be turned off! So you can charge the caps once, pulse the coil on for a few milliseconds, and lose only a few volts across the capacitor - instantly ready to fire again!  MOSFETs: basically, yeah. Rdson is the number you are looking for. And yes, you can parallel an arbitrary number of mosfets to decrease the equivalent resistance. If you want to switch higher currents, it is even better to parallel MOSFETs, as you might run into problems with package current limits (i.e. how much current can you get through the thin leads of the MOSFET package).  Timing-wise, pretty much every MOSFET that is less than twenty years old will do fine. Your example, for instance, will turn on in 91 nanoseconds (if properly driven), which is orders of magnitude lower than the coilgun time constants.  The FET you linked will do just fine, though yes, you might want to parallel them. Remember that you have to drive them properly to get good turn-on times, though due your extremely low duty cycle this is not that important.  TL;DR: pulse current rating of your caps decides if this project is doomed or not."

AskElectronics,3avc9i,kegelwerfer,2,Wed Jun 24 17:49:08 2015 UTC,"Oh, not bad, 1200A short circuit current! These are actually high-power! Okay, you won't get usable 1200A out of them, because their internal resistance is too high. Putting ten of these in series will give you 27 volts @ 31 Farads, with 22mOhms internal resistance. Your capacitors have one advantage - they supply loads of current without sagging! So they won't bottleneck you.  First of all, your ""resistance budget"" is R = 27V/250A = 108 mOhms - the sum of all resistances must be below this value in order to reach 250A. Assume you want the current to reach 250A within 10ms, after which you shut off the MOSFETs.    Your ten caps in series have 22 mOhms Your MOSFETs will have something around 5 mOhms (2 parallel). Your coil resistance must be below 80 ohms. Your inductance should be below 500µH, even lower the higher the coil resistance. Reasonable values seem to be in the 10µH-100µH range.   So this is actually kinda feasible!  Unfortunately, this is where my very limited coilgun knowledge ends. You'll have to find out yourself what sort of pulse times, currents and coil size you wish to achieve. Remember that you are committing yourself to a high-current design, where every milliohm of resistance costs rise time. Be prepared to get appropriate tools to measure low resistances and high currents.  On the good side - by using MOSFETs and a quasi unlimited source of power, you can go really deep into coilgun design! You can switch the MOSFETs to precisely limit the current, you can use feedback to turn off the coil whenever the projectile leaves the coil, you could trivially expand your design into a multiple-coil design... Also, you don't need to worry about lethal electric shocks or a 350V charging circuit.  A slight side note - another source of 27V 350A continuous would be two medium-sized car batteries in series. They might be a good power source for testing."
AskElectronics,3avc9i,wolfcry0,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:02:38 2015 UTC,"I have to thank you a lot for your help :D Do you suggest only using 10 in series? because i have 40 of them, and i don't really know what else to use them for.  And is 27V enough for a coil gun, since a lot of people suggested that i use high voltage caps."
AskElectronics,3avc9i,LobsterSoulSandwich,2,Wed Jun 24 19:11:22 2015 UTC,"No, 10 was just a number out of the air. So that's where the 108V 7,5F come from! If you have 40, use 40. Be aware that charging them will be non-trivial (108V current-limited boost converter needed).  Quick calculation with 40 units: stacking them in series will not change the current limits. I would keep the 250A as a reasonable limit, expandable if everything else works.  Your resistance requirements are now much more relaxed! 108V/250A = 432 mOhms. Your 40 caps have 88 mOhms internal resistance. Your MOSFETs will still be around 5 mOhms, so the coil can have a resistance value of up to 340 mOhms.  Once again, if the current is to rise to 250A within 10ms, the inductance should be below 2mH (relaxed constraint).  So the consequence of 40 caps instead of 10 caps is that you can have a higher resistance and higher inductance, but achieve better performance.  About the 27V for a coilgun - it is unusual. But: coilguns want maximum magnetic fields, fast. The field depends on the current and the number of turns. Increasing the current means thicker wire. Increasing the turns means more inductance so to get the same rise time, you need to increase the voltage. The result is: to get much power, increase the current or the voltage. Most coil gun designs seem to choose high voltage, as it is easier to handle than high current. 27V will work fine, as long as you get enough current out of your caps. But as said previously, debugging gets much more difficult because measuring really low resistances and really high currents is not trivial.  Now, a word about my numbers: once again, I am not a coil gun designer. I can tell you about power electronics, but not about coil gun specifics. A back-of-the-envelope estimate tells me that for a hypothetical muzzle velocity of 1000m/s, you would need ~20µs rise and fall times, which (for 250A and 108V) means a 4µH coil. This is getting into the area of fast-edge high-current designs, which are even more challenging than regular old high-current designs... YMMV, but be bold and try stuff."

AskElectronics,3avc9i,dmc_2930,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:39:02 2015 UTC,"A high-power (>100W) constant-current (~10A) source capable of going up to 100+V, with an output voltage range of 0-100V - difficult.  You can't really connect boost converters in series. You could do it if you can supply them with floating voltages. The problem is that you don't have just 100V at the output, but your output ""load"" starts at 0V and goes to 100V.  I would suggest building your own boost converter. However, you may be successful in finding something among high-current high-voltage LED drivers.  May I suggest:   A simple custom boost converter. 200V FET + driver, inductor, diode. ACS712 (20A version) to measure inductor current A microcontroller supplies the FET PWM, measures inductor current and output voltage. Regulates duty cyle for constant current and overvoltage shutoff.   An alternative would be to rectify mains and step that down."

AskElectronics,3avebd,Tito1337,3,Tue Jun 23 21:41:21 2015 UTC,"What is marketed as ""LED TV"" is mostly LCD with LED backlight.  The construction is identical to older LCD, except the CFL tube is replaced by a string of LEDs. Such panels are thinner and have better color response, but the price difference is not justified AFAIK.  OLED TV are much less common, but there are some new models in stores right now. The most common OLED application is smartphone screens, mostly AMOLED in Samsung Galaxy devices."
AskElectronics,3avebd,MATlad,2,Wed Jun 24 00:14:37 2015 UTC,"LED (Light Emitting Diode) just refers to how many LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) panels are backlit.  CCFL (Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp) lighting used to dominate, but they were often thicker, require high voltages to operate, are often more fragile, and usually don't last as long nor operate as efficiently.  The actual LCD is the part you're probably most interested in--it's the part that selectively blocks out (or partially blocks out) red, green, and blue of the pixels in your display.  There's a fantastic poster that hangs outside my University's microfabrication facility illustrating the process steps, but I can't find it online.  From a Google search for liquid crystal display fabrication process, this page talks about the processing steps and this page is a more interactive one illustrating the processing.  TL;DR: The microfabrication for an LCD display (usually carried out on transparent glass substrates) is very much the same way that CMOS is microfabricated on silicon.  Except that LCD mother glass is massive, compared to say, 300 mm silicon wafers."

AskElectronics,3asopn,d1d3r,2,Tue Jun 23 04:56:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, by using a H-Bridge. You take the PWM signal of your pin and the inverted signal, that is created by some simple logic, to drive the switches (e.g. MOSFETs). The wikipedia article describes the operation as well.  This is not the best way to drive the H-Bridge (output current ripple) but for the other way you need two seperate pwm pins."
AskElectronics,3asopn,notoriousnovi,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:29:50 2015 UTC,"Expanding on this: If you have a bipolar voltage supply, you can do it with only a half-bridge, but an H-bridge would work equally. Alternatively, you can tie one end of the motor to 1/2 Vcc and use a regular unipolar half-bridge.   A duty cycle of 0 would be full speed in one direction. A duty cycle of 25% would be half speed in one direction A duty cycle of 50% would be standstill. A duty cycle of 75% would be half speed in the other direction A duty cycle of 100% would be full speed in the other direction.   You won't get around to having to use external power components."
AskElectronics,3asopn,kegelwerfer,2,Tue Jun 23 09:12:44 2015 UTC,"Well, servos are controlled with one PWM pin. I'm trying to go off memory, but I think the protocol involves the controller sending a pulse between 1ms and 2ms in positive width that is repeated at a rate of between 50Hz and 200Hz. Pulse widths less than 1.5ms correspond to 'reverse' and pulse widths greater than 1.5ms correspond to 'forward'. However, this protocol only works because the servo has some internal smarts to interpret this signal. It won't work with a standard DC motor.  If you want to do it with brushed DC motors rather than servos, you will most likely need to have at 2 pins of your microcontroller driving it. One would be PWM, and one would be direction (low for reverse, high for forward, or something like that). This assumes that you have a bidirectional motor control that can allow you to set the direction with one pin. I have worked with an L298-based motor driver that included logic to allow for this, so I know they're out there. Hope this helps!"

AskElectronics,3asopn,LobsterSoulSandwich,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:15:49 2015 UTC,"Assuming you have a plain DC motor and not a servo motor (which has control electronics built in) you will need a motor controller with an Hbridge (for running in both directions) at a minimum.  If you want to control the speed at which the motor runs then you will need additional control circuitry.   The most practical setup involves 1 pin to control the direction (via the H-bridge) and 1 pin to control the speed of the motor.     To answer your question directly:  Yes it is, is possible to control a small DC motor bidirectionally with one PWM pin.  However it would probably be worth your while to get a  continuous rotation servo, since they are an all in one solution to your needs."

If you only have 5v then your next best bet will be to get a small modular DC-DC converter to step the 5v up to 12v, and use any old op amp to get your scaled output. here is a Mouser.com query of likely suitable DC-DC converters  Any op amp on this search should work for your voltage scaling.

AskElectronics,3ask48,t_Lancer,12,Tue Jun 23 04:47:49 2015 UTC,you are still limited to the supply voltage.  you can boost the voltage up with the step-up regulator.   though you may need filtering if the regulator is too noisy.
AskElectronics,3ask48,Zurmakin,6,Tue Jun 23 05:21:24 2015 UTC,Op amps can only amplify up to close to their rails. Transistors are also only like relays with more control. You are not going to get greater than the supply unless you use a DC/DC converter. There is absolutely no way you can get above the rails of an Op Amp or the supply of a transistor.
AskElectronics,3ask48,bradn,3,Tue Jun 23 04:59:23 2015 UTC,"And ""close to their rails"" has a very different meaning depending on the opamp.  Some lose like 2V on the edges...

AskElectronics,3ask48,Zurmakin,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:21:05 2015 UTC,I didn't think that rail-to-rail op amps were much of interest in this operation since he specified an input voltage of 5V. That isn't a term of interest in this operation. He needs a buck or boost converter in this application.

AskElectronics,3ask48,siren215,1 point,Tue Jun 23 05:06:05 2015 UTC,"For completeness' sake - yes, you can build a simple circuit that will amplify your input voltage by a factor of 3, regardless of supply voltage, even above any supply voltage Here's a circuit simulation of a circuit that does precisely that: boost the input Voltage by a constant factor of 3.  It does this by being a boost converter (duh...) with a fixed duty cycle of 33%. With adequate output filtering, you get an acceptably smooth output response, where V_out = 3 * V_in.  Now, does this make sense? Not really, because a power supply with an input below 1V is unusual; OP most likely has a 0-3.3V signal that is to be amplified to 0-10V, not a variable power source to be boosted by exactly a factor of three. If we're already building a boost converter we might as well use it to generate a supply above 10V and feed that to an opamp."

You can amplify a voltage, but the amplifier needs a voltage source equal to or greater than the output that you want. You can step up a voltage at the cost of higher current.

What I sometimes do to test these is cut one of the component leads, then measure, and if it tested out okay I'll just solder the lead back together.

I just assumed because I had opened the door, that she had jumped out. So after I got all the stuff out of the trunk for our family get together, I closed her door back closed.(assuming she had got out and I never looked inside). It has been the worse few days ever. So hard to explain to a 2 year old that his best buddy is gone too. It was an accident, but I had an opportunity to correct it and I didn't take it. I am really beating myself up over that. The family get together had ran out of ice shortly after I arrived and I was going to go to the grocery store to get some more only 30 minutes into the get together... But I just decided to wait for the ice maker to make some more instead. If I had gone to the grocery store, I'd have seen her in there and could have prevented the whole ordeal. My wife's uncle arrived and told us she was in the car and we ran out in a panic and pulled her out and started cpr and gave her oxygen from a oxygen tank while we called 911. They said they would send someone but never sent anyone. So for 45 minutes we did cpr and breathed for her but no one ever came so we drove 30 minutes away to the vet who told us she was dead. The only comfort I have is that according to the vet because of the intense Florida heat and her age, that she couldn't have lasted more than 20 minutes. The temperature in the car after only 20 minutes was already like 154 degrees yesterday. Dogs go to sleep and start to stroke out at 106 degrees and at a brain temperature of 108 degrees, their brains begin making proteins that cause massive clotting which causes death. I am at a loss for words, I feel so guilty and so sad and upset with myself. So I am trying to make something that can prevent something like this again in the future.

If you use a pull-down resistor (and the sampling circuit's internal resistance), and don't size it correctly to the output resistance of whatever's feeding it, you'll end up with a voltage divider where you don't want one.  And if you're really unfortunate, the output values will be right around the forbidden zone between logic 0 and logic 1 for the input circuitry.

Does the dot move when you adjust the horizontal position? Does the dot turn into a line or some other shape when you feed a periodic signal into the scope and set up its trigger? Does the external trigger input work?"
AskElectronics,3apa8q,-48V,2,Mon Jun 22 13:06:59 2015 UTC,Dot does not move when adjusting position.  I got a probe and hooked up a 9VDC battery and nothing happened (stays a dot).  EDIT: I put the schematic in the OP now
AskElectronics,3apa8q,-48V,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:00:32 2015 UTC,"Dot does not move when adjusting position.   It makes me think that the horizontal deflection system doesn't work in your scope at all, probably because of the +/-15VDC power supply.  Can you measure its input and output voltages when it is disconnected from the rest of the scope? You may also want to (but you don't have to) turn off all the other power supplies to make the whole thing a little safer. Note that there are high voltages present inside the scope, even after it was turned off, so you must be very careful.  It would also be nice to know if substituting the +/-15VDC power supply with your own fixes the problem."
AskElectronics,3apa8q,tron21net,2,Wed Jun 24 02:10:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that specific oscilloscope, but the ones I've worked with when no probes are attached to the individual channels, one per probe, then said channel's line is hidden(not shown) as there's no need to display it when there's no probe attached. I wonder if that's the case here when no probes are attached then it just shows a dot for this particular model."
AskElectronics,3apa8q,Eryb,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:53:36 2015 UTC,If you are in norm mode this is true but auto mode should always display a trace
AskElectronics,3apa8q,Eryb,2,Mon Jun 22 21:48:20 2015 UTC,"Be sure the oscilloscope is not set to XY mode.  This will cause the trace to appear as a dot.  If it is not that easy then your timing section is bad, there are a lot of situations that can cause this but without a schematic hard to narrow down for you.  Edit:  Btw be extremely careful with the old CRT scopes there are plenty of dangerous voltages for the tubes and should really not be attempted alone and as a first project."

If you're just doing USB 2.0 traffic, depending on the amount of shielding you're stripping away, then you might get flaky enumeration issues only. It could just totally fuck up your data transfer as well, though.   Moreover, you're exposing the data lines to all sorts of noise, as well as contributing a lot of background noise. The ground line which is unshielded (depending on how they made the cable) will act as an antenna and inject noise onto your device ground, which might affect the entire system, not just the USB.  In general, it might work, but you will probably see some weird errors."

That wouldn't matter in most circuits, but this circuit relied on the coefficient to act as a temperature compensation for a transmitter, so the slope was very important.  What we received were common COGs that have a flat thermal response. In the field all the transmitters went out of band when exposed to warm or cold temperatures.  We sent them out to be analyzed by a lab, and the report came back that the labels on the reel were forgeries.

In electrolytics that are used in low impedance applications very often it was a design flaw by the engineer. People are slow to learn an electrolytic should be rated at almost double the maximum applied voltage, or it will blow. So you see people using a 16VDC cap in a 12VDC power application, and that one is a ticking time bomb, because it will have a premature death. It usually doesn't happen until years later.  And in antique electronics the electrolytics and old wax paper caps give out to due the aging of the chemicals in the barrier.

This is written from the perspective of someone in the industry who is working with Wifi and has been trying to find the better/faster/cheaper chipset for the last 3 years. This is all my personal opinion, so take that with a grain of salt.  What options are available?   ESP8266: The darling of the ""1-bit"" communication needs and hobbiest market. Very low cost, but also the lowest performance of current chipsets. Full internal TCP/IP stack + Wifi Supplicant. Questionable availability and just where the hell are these coming from??? Who are they? How are they so damn cheap??? TI CC3xxx: Possible single chip Wifi solution (Wifi+Cortex M4). Rather expensive as a standalone part (as previously mentioned). Broadcom Wiced modules: Wide range of vendors, possible access to SDK (sortof). Prices range from barely single digits to $30 per module. Lowest cost that I know of (depending on form) are the MxChip module and the one from Ackme Networks. These guys are the former Roving Networks crew + some from the Wiced dev team. (Full disclosure: I have written custom WICED firmware and am utterly blown away by how well architected the SDK is. It's truly the best written software I've ever seen). Atheros: Um... Anemic chipsets. Poor drivers. No idea on pricing or availability Redpine: See Atheros, but worse. Roving Networks: Great products, but even more expensive than TI. Look at ACKme instead (same crew, same philosophy). Atmel: Currently releasing their WILC1000 and WINC1500 modules. Unknown what their pricing is in ~100 units. I have personally spoken with their product team on these units and they are heavily targeting the low power MCU space with these products. Personal opinion is that they would be a good first party vendor to work with. Gainspan: From what I can tell, they are fairly decent price/performance/reliability, but I've never dealt with them other than getting a quote. Their tools are fairly pricy at $5k for the sdk to work with their chips directly.   Reccomendations  What is your use case?   Serial to TCP only on LAN: Probably the MxChip. Unless you actually need support. Then I'd lean towards Ackme. Arduino on LAN: Atmel may be more attractive due to historic partnership. Max Throughput: Broadcom WICED module with custom firmware. Only way to go. BCM43362 chipset has throughput >30Mbps. TI CC3xxx is ~11Mbps. Serial-to-Wifi devices running SPI is 4-5 Mbps usually (My custom one is ~12 Mbps but runs with external stack and lots of custom things; not applicable in general). IOT and the Cloud: Ackme offers some sort of device cloud service. Also, the previously identified Spark device. I have no experience in this area, so Your Milage May Vary.

With the MxChip & ACKMe modules, my understanding is that they come pre-programmed a UART interface firmware on them, to be used with an external microcontroller.  On the MXChip, alternatively, you can link the mxchipWNet library to your own code, and flash the core of the module (an STM32F205) to run your app + wireless components on the module itself, no other MCU needed. Where does WICED play in to this?  Is the same true with ACKMe? I wasn't able to easily find what the core was in these modules - other than ""ARM Cortex M4 at 84mhz"". Likewise, where does WICED become involved?  My understanding is that WICED is a framework for creating applications (or rather, custom firmware) that can be flashed on to the ARM core in these modules, which communicates with a Broadcom wifi IC. Is this correct?  EDIT it looks like the MxChip modules are not officially supported by WICED. They're not listed on the partner's page, either. I found a fork on Github of WICED that supports the MxChip module. Obviously I cannot assess the quality of it, though."

Basically the process of getting custom WICED app working is to get the WICED SDK (aka, have an email at not gmail, hotmail, etc.) and then getting a vendor patch for the platform you're working with. Your understanding on about the framework is correct. I personally have only worked significantly with the Inventek ISM43362. Inventek is fully accessable with their patch to the SDK to support their modules (Inventek's WICED page), while I can't say the same for any other WICED partner.  As for a couple the other WICED module vendors: there is also Murata and USI, but if you're looking at <100 units, I doubt they would even answer the sales inquiry to tell you no.  Lastly, would you care to explain what you're doing that you need >10 but <100 wifi modules? If it's necessarily hush hush, I understand.

Having said that, this is a weird way to connect it, since you're basically making your opener power source -3v when referenced to the motorcycle ground.

Let's be super duper conservative and make a big over-estimate of the power dissipation.  Then you can sleep soundly, knowing that the zener diodes you choose are more than big enough.  You've got a large safety margin.  We will estimate that the LED current is 20 milliamps {but in the circuit attached to the OP, LED current is only 4 mA!  Golly are we conservative} and then we will assume that the maximum possible zener current is 2X the LED current.  {oh my good lord is that an over estimate!}  So you need a 10V zener diode that can handle 40 milliamps.  That's a power rating of 400 milliwatts.  You also need a 3.6V zener diode that can handle 40 milliamps.  That's a power rating of 144 milliwatts.  SOLUTION: CHOOSE ZENER DIODES RATED FOR 500 MILLIWATTS OR EVEN 1 WATT   For 3.6V: either 1N5227 or NZX3V6 or 1N4729 or 1N5989 or BZX79C3V6      For 10.0V: either 1N4740 or BZX85C10 or 1N5240 or NZX10 or 1N758 or BZX79C10   I suspect that other redditors are going to remind you, that your LED has a significant forward voltage drop, and this should influence your choice of zener voltage."

You can use single cell chargers, but the issue is slow charge rates aren't always very nice to Li-ion, so you want a charger proportional in current to the size of the battery.  So your 1A charger is only (1/15)C charge rate for your frankenbattery.  You probably want to charge at a .5C to 1C rate to keep the cells healthy.  So I would recommend a 10A charger or so.  Also look up recommended wiring strategies for putting cells like that in parallel (relating to the resistance seen from the common points to each cell).

AskElectronics,3am4wv,sopordave,2,Sun Jun 21 16:02:48 2015 UTC,"It works according to the same principles than a regular boost converter, but with a few components switched:   The load is now attached between the high side of the supply and the converter output (instead of the low side and the converter output). Current flow is now into the converter output, not out. That means you have to switch the diode and the MOSFET. Alternatively, look into synchronous rectifier designs. They have  two active switches instead of one switch and a diode, and are therefore natively capable of sourcing and sinking. Feedback is now sensed between the high side of the supply and the output (instead of the low side and the output). That means your controller has to account for this. Alternatively your duty cycle needs to be inverse (1 - old_duty_cycle). If you use a regular feedback structure, a ""5 volt PWM controller"" will regulate the output to 5V above the negative supply. In your example, that controller would regulate the output to 5V above -15V, or -10V. The duty cycle gradient is inverted, so increasing the duty cycle will decrease the output voltage. This can be easily solved if you use a difference amplifier and measure the voltage between the positive supply and your output pin and route this difference to the PWM controller feedback pin. Alternatively, add an inverter between the controller and the discrete MOSFET (or use a driver with an inverting input); that way the duty cycle is also inverted.   Here's a link to a simulation that illustrates the difference between the two setups. You can toggle the switches to change the ground reference.  If your input voltage is stable enough: Assuming your 15V are rock-solid, you can just tell any PWM controller to regulate the voltage to ""10V"". The output will then be regulated to 10V above the negative supply, which will be -5V (-15V + 10V). Any ripple on the 15V input will appear 1:1 on the 5V output.  To summarize your options:  Option 1: Get a half-bridge, a difference amplifier and a buck converter of your choice. Connect the feedback input to (V_positive - V_output) and connect the PWM output to the half-bridge, done. Proceed as if you had a usual regulator.  Option 2: Get an inverting FET driver and a buck converter of your choice. Set the feedback network so that the regulator regulates to (15V - output voltage). Put the MOSFET on the low side, the diode on the high side, done.  Option 2.1: If you make use of the fact that your MOSFET is now on the low side and needs to be driven inverted, you can just build a discrete MOSFET driver out of two complementary transistors (or a 555 timer, for ultra-simplicity). Inherently inverting, tada!  I'll see whether I can whip together a small simulation showcasing my design suggestions...  Edit: Here's a simple LTSpice simulation of the negative voltage buck concept. The ""simple PWM controller model"" is just an idealized voltage-mode PWM circuit. Save this as negative_voltage_converter.asc and this as NE555_LT_good.sub to run that simulation on your PC."

AskElectronics,3ajl6w,HawkDriver,10,Sat Jun 20 20:50:19 2015 UTC,"A modern computer will likely run from 400Hz (internally, they convert to DC before doing much else), and if it doesn't, it's unlikely to be damaged.  Motorized devices probably won't work correctly unless they use a ""universal"" (brushed AC/DC type) motor.  A cooler that runs from a thermoelectric peltier or something like that might be okay.  One that runs from a motorized compressor, I wouldn't recommend trying it on 400Hz."
AskElectronics,3ajl6w,bradn,3,Sat Jun 20 20:56:51 2015 UTC,"Interesting. My fear, was that all the laptop adapters, phone chargers, and almost everything say 50~60Hz on them. I was worried I might jack something up. I heard that someone had plugged in some cheaper appliances into it and they worked ok, however was worried to try something more expensive."
AskElectronics,3ajl6w,bradn,7,Sat Jun 20 21:11:14 2015 UTC,"Slower frequencies probably wouldn't work well (not enough buffering time in the capacitors they used), but faster at least should be compatible in principle.  That's not to say they couldn't use a PFC control chip that decides to freak out and shut down at 400Hz though, but electrically nothing should be damaged.  One possibility for damage though, is if they used a capacitive current limiter to provide power to the front end controller of the power supply.  Those would pass more current at higher frequency/voltage and might not be happy.  At 115VAC I would assume it could go up to about 100Hz without issues but because of the variance between ~90VAC at 50Hz up to 240VAC at 60Hz (yeah these are unusual but they are typically designed for), that kind of design choice is already questionable and not all that likely to be used.  My guess is if this is the case and it's not adequately heatsinked for 400Hz operation, it would run fine for a short period and then some type of regulator (maybe zener diode?) in the power supply would overheat.  If you had an infrared camera and opened the power supply up, you might be able to spot it before it goes.  I don't particularly expect this to happen though.  Older power supplies with the 115/230 switch on back should be 100% compatible - there is no brains looking at the AC side, it all operates off ~350VDC or so."
AskElectronics,3ajl6w,dizekat,3,Sat Jun 20 21:40:18 2015 UTC,"There could be also an issue with passive PFC. I'm not sure if 120v power supplies would have that, but European PC power supplies often have an extra inductor and a few capacitors.  Laptop power supply probably wouldn't have that.  The other issue is with transformers in non switched power supplies, they may not work well at a higher frequency (e.g. if the laminated metal plates that the transformer is made from are too thick)."
AskElectronics,3ajl6w,bradn,3,Sat Jun 20 23:35:07 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm not 100% sure about passive PFC... do you know how they are usually implemented?  Is it just a basic filter circuit?
AskElectronics,3ajl6w,dizekat,3,Sun Jun 21 00:32:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's some examples . Now note that at 400hz you'll have 6.67 times smaller impedance of every capacitor and larger for every inductor. The device would probably end up underpowered because of the series inductor.  If there's a resistor powered through a capacitor and resistor's power was chosen appropriately it is certainly going to burn. Capacitors can burn from over-current or burn the fuse/trip the breaker.  edit: basically for the switched power supplies it's a bandpass filter that tries to keep harmonics of 50 or 60 hz (produced by the rectifier) from passing through it. So if it's doing any correcting, it should fail at 400hz."

You'll probably have some addition THC and a slightly lower power factor, but it should generally work with any controller I've ever used.  The biggest problem I see is additional leakage through the ""Y"" caps in the EMI filter."

AskElectronics,3ajl6w,dizekat,2,Sun Jun 21 00:07:35 2015 UTC,"So basically depending on what you're doing you either need to rectify and make 60hz from it, probably best done using some special device you can buy for that, or you could get away with using 400hz as is and possibly a minor modification to the power supply or a rectifier before it (if it's a switched power supply). Depends mostly on whenever you want to be able to power any device, or you just want to power, say, a laptop (in which case you get an extra power supply that you open and look to make sure it would work ok with 400hz)."

Not sure the amperage the aircraft alternator can handle, but was also thinking of a small vacuum or battery charger for a dewalt style power drill battery."
AskElectronics,3ajl6w,drive2fast,2,Sun Jun 21 01:36:43 2015 UTC,"Well, hopefully it is all fused to where a short can't glitch up your electronics in flight. All in all unless you convert to 60hz it's device by device, often with modifications, and kind of dangerous if you don't have schematics for everything and can't simulate in some way how it reacts to higher frequency (and make required modifications). Even something that would seem like it would work fine - a transformer for instance - may melt because you have larger losses in the core at higher frequency especially without thinner laminations."
AskElectronics,3ajl6w,bradn,7,Sun Jun 21 04:19:05 2015 UTC,"Expanding on what /u/bradn said:  If it is a PC, it will run on anything between DC and maybe 400Hz. The upper input frequency limit is dictated by the reverse recovery time of the input rectifier, and if it works at 60Hz, it will work at 400Hz (maybe less efficient). If it is a switch-mode power supply, it will do the same, as it has the same setup.   If it is a power supply with active PFC, you might have some sort of (input) current distortion, but nothing problematic. Digikey has a short article about it here.  If in doubt, add an external full-bridge rectifier that can handle the faster AC and supply the PC with DC.  Now, the refrigerated cooler might be problematic. What sort of cooler, one with an AC motor? I have absolutely no idea about AC motors and their frequency dependence. If you are lucky, it is a universal AC/DC motor and will run on anything. If you have an asynchronous motor (most likely), you are out of luck.  To answer your actual question:   Rectify AC and filter it to get DC Generate 60Hz AC from that DC.   Generating the AC is the tricky part. Depending on what waveforms your device accepts, you might be okay with using 60Hz square waves (using a simple $10 half.bridge solution) or you might have to use PWM and filtering to recreate a sinewave.  Commercial solution: get a variable-frequency drive."
AskElectronics,3ajl6w,drive2fast,3,Sat Jun 20 21:45:14 2015 UTC,"Direct drive a 400hz rated motor with a 60hz gen head rated for the same RPM, or use a v-belt and gear ratio change to compensate for any differences in rated RPM.  Or for anything requiring a DC power supply just recitify it to DC. Knock it down with a transformer, add a beefy diode and polish with a DC/DC converter for final required voltage.   If you really needed bigger 60hz AC power, you could reduce the voltage with a transformer again, recitify it and directly drive an inverter."

There is a point when you have to put the calculator down, build it, and put it through it's paces and just see the performance empirically.   Also, for commercial servo applications that are going out into the field you should try pushing out certain parameters like load characteristics and drag, to make sure you haven't created a design that only works under the highly specific conditions of the prototype. There will be variation picked up by manufacturing variability and by aging in the field. You want your design to be able to handle that.  The most powerful tool at your command is understanding the concepts of loop control, the governing variables of behavior, and the symptoms of instability that can be seen. People who rely on calculating too much end up with tunnel vision and end up dismissing empirical clues of instability in the testing of the prototype.  So build it, vary the load, push the parameters of the loop, and see what happens."

Variable hysteresis (linkage slop) in the linkage or mounting, causing hunting oscillations. Will it hunt so badly that it blows the bearings out?  Variable elasticity in the linkage or mounting, causing hunting oscillations.  Asymmetric loading. Some system have a load symmetry relative to gravity, so you have the uphill and downhill side of the load. What happens if you push this beyond normal? Will it self destruct?  Those things can drive your loop control algorithm nuts.   Too often a single prototype is used for a long time to fine tune the peak performance out of loop, and the person pushes it to maximum response speed. That one prototype doesn't represent all the variation in manufacturing and aging, so you end up with weird or destructive behavior in the final released version. Find the edges of the loop performance, and back away, giving yourself some distance from the dangerous edge of instability."

Also, double check the values on each pin, don't assume you managed to hook everything up as you believe you did.

AskElectronics,3aiyb9,m37driver,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:05:43 2015 UTC,"well i'm assuming that a regular scale will not work for your application.  load cells that I have been exposed to have two parts to them. first some kind of mechanical beam (cantilever or Z) The cross section of this part is tightly controlled so that when a force is applied you can predict how much the part will deform under load.  And the second is a strain gauge that is mounted on the beam. the stain gauge will change Its resistance according to how much  it is deformed. since the beam is of a known material and size you can figure how much weight is on the scale. Or you can cheat and buy a Chinese load cell off of ebay.   Its the mechanical requirements that makes me think that you not going to find an off the shelf unit that will directly mount to a pcb. But the smallest load cell i have really delt with was 50kg  There is an analog devices has a chip that has all the front end required and up to 24 bit adc in a package.

AskElectronics,3ai7cp,classicsat,6,Sat Jun 20 13:15:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe yes! But to give you a certain answer, we need a bit more info.  Here's me drawing all over your image: schematic.   Can you look at the 8-pin IC in the center of the board? My suspicion is that it is a NE555 timer IC. I also suspect that the circuit is like this one, due to the diodes attached to the potentiometer. a high-resolution picture from the front and back might help. Do you have any sort of measuring instrument? Multimeter/Voltmeter, oscilloscope, 12V LED/Lamp, continuity tester? Check if Pin 6 (connected to the right side of capacitor ""C5"") is connected to the center pin of the potentiometer. If so: use a wire to bridge it to VCC (pin 8). The motor output should go low (0V across motor terminals, motor/lamp off). Use a wire to bridge it to GND (Pin 1). The motor output should go high (supply voltage across motor terminals, motor/lamp on). Measure the voltage between Vcc and GND. Alternatively, post the label of the regulator (where it says ""Reg"" in my schematic). If this voltage is not 12V, you might have to add a component.   If everything worked so far, then there is a simple way to get this PWM-controlled. Just unsolder the potentiometer (or at least the center pin), and attach GND from the PC to GND on your board and PWM from your PC to where the potentiometer center pin was attached.  Will this work? Most likely! The ATX standard says that the yellow wire from a fan (""PWM wire"") is a 12V 5mA 24kHz signal. That means the PWM frequency is now twice as fast. That means the losses in the MOSFETs can be twice as high. Try it on a limited load, at limited duty cycles, and check the thermal performance (""does it get hot afeter a few seconds/minutes?"") before putting it under full load.  What precisely do you want to drive with 40A, from a computer fan PWM output? I hope you are aware that you might really blow stuff up if you don't know what you are doing."

The wrist cuffs are definitely what I'm going to be going with, but that leads me to another question:  I'm assuming that compared with my current setup, a much lower voltage should be required to achieve the same 15-25mA over just my wrists and hands, so what might be a good voltage to try?

If you build a constant current source, the circuit adjusts the output voltage up or down to maintain the same amount of current.

I would stick w/ battery power but have you considered using 12v sealed lead-acid batteries? (not w/ your current setup though - that might be bad.)  Can you elaborate on this at all?   Which part? It would be bad in the setup you have now because you have no regulation or current limiting and the SLA battery has a much lower internal resistance than your 9v batteries so it would potentially put out a lot more current than you want.  Same reason you can start your car w/ a car battery but not with two 9v batteries in series.  If you meant why SLA batteries - because they have a comparatively huge amount of stored power so you would have to charge them much less often and I'm guessing they would last a lot longer before needing to be replaced."
AskElectronics,3ai9jd,mastermaw,4,Sat Jun 20 13:04:32 2015 UTC,Mostly likely will not work.  An AC motor speed control is a substantially different circuit from an LED dimmer.  You're likely to damage the dimmer and/or overheat the motor (if it doesn't have enough power to start rotation).    You might be able to connect them via an AC mechanical (not solid-state) relay.  The relay coil must be rated for your mains voltage.  Connect the coil to the dimmer output.  Connect the fan motor to the relay contacts and the mains (NOT through the dimmer).  At some brightness setting the relay should engage its contacts and start the fan motor.  The exact brightness setting needed is somewhat unpredictable and the relay coil may be noisy at settings less than full brightness.

You're on the right track. Contrary to what others have said you do not need neopixels if you don't care about being able to individually address each LED (and neopixels will cost a lot more than just a standard one color non-addressable LED strip). If you just want a white LED strip you will more than likely have to find a 12 VDC supply to power the strip with, and then some logic level MOSFETs to drive the strip with (you will not be able to directly drive the LED strip with a microcontroller).    Will my current LED placement work with a white LED strip?   Not anymore. You will have to drive this strip from the microcontroller to adjust brightness, you can't just have it connected directly to power. What you can do is use PWM to control the brightness of the strip. Again you will have to use a MOSFET to drive the strip.   Do I need that resistor for the LED ? (since LED strips seem to come with resistors built in.)   No resistor needed with an LED strip (providing you are giving it the proper voltage (usually 12V).   How can I send a signal to the LED strip to pull more power based on Force applied to the Force Sensing Resistors?   Looks like you're force sensors are already hooked up to your microcontroller - make sure they're connected to the analog inputs. Once connected properly you can perform some ADC with the voltage across each sensor and use that value to drive the MOSFET via PWM.     Other than that stuff - ditch Fritzing, your PCB is way too big (and will cost a lot more money if you want to get it made say by OshPark) and pickup a real EDA package like Eagle CAD, KiCad, or any of the other decent free packages. Once you've done that read some sparkfun (or other) tutorials on how to design PCBs. There's quite a lot you can improve upon based on what you have here.

If you have a 2% chance of a defect, building three boards has a 5.8% chance of giving you less than three boards, so you always build four, ending up with a 0.000016% risk of having to re-run the entire job -- so a 33% overhead gives you a good risk reduction.  Running single boards without overhead gives you 2% failure, which is a massive cost in labor for do-overs, and always running two reduces failure rate to 0.04% (still noticeable) at 100% overhead (which is rather steep)."

You're either transmitting your own radio so 1 freq, or you're just looking to receive radio in the office.  So, knowing that, just cutting a wire to a quarter wavelength antenna should be sufficient.  No fanciness required I would think.  To do this, I'd pick 100 MHz to be in the middle of the FM radio band. length = (1/4) * c / 100 MHz = 3/4 m of antenna.

To just buy the certification to see what you need to do costs in the ballpark of $1500(http://www.comm-2000.com/ProductDetail.aspx?UniqueKey=20941 looks to be similar to what you're looking for) and that's just to see what requirements you need to do in order to pass their certification process. On top of that you have to get your product certified, which you can do in house... once you buy the test equipment and pay a fee to UL, or you can send it away and pay a certified lab.  On top of UL, my guess is that there are plenty of rebates for solar inverters for home use, and in order to get those rebates, you need to get Energy Star certified.

AskElectronics,3af9uk,quitte,3,Fri Jun 19 20:48:50 2015 UTC,ATX PSUs often have multiple 12V rails so it is possible that while the PSU as a whole is capable of 500W a single 12V rail is exhausted at less than 80W.  So it might help to use a different connector or maybe even use multiple cables in parallel.

Do you have an oscilloscope? Can you look at what the supply is doing when loaded?  It sounds like you've either wired the ATX supply wrong, or are bumping up against safety mechanisms. The PSU may be unable to handle current surges from the SMPS in the charger, and limits the output. The charger sees the input voltage sag, and ceases function to protect what it was probably designed to connect to, a car battery. At 11.5V, that battery would be about 75% discharged.  Also, remember that energy is conserved. The charger supplying 10A to a battery does not mean that it is drawing 10A from the supply.   Double check your wiring, not all ATX supplies are the same."

My answer might have been slightly flippant, but still accurate - switching power supplies work by switching on and off (simplified) at a high frequency (50khz+) so they only need to supply/store power for very small fraction of a second (single ""cycle"" above).  And you did connect the size of caps with disparity of output ;)"
AskElectronics,3actjj,triffid_hunter,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:39:05 2015 UTC,What happens when my switching supply outputs a constant 36v or 48v DC at 10 Amps (which is what I'm looking at buying) but part of each mains cycle is below that (I guess it would be only about 10% of it at 230v rms)?  I'm assuming it uses a combination of its small-ish caps and some other magic to maintain output.
AskElectronics,3actjj,stuner,2,Fri Jun 19 07:58:43 2015 UTC,"It works out that this can be done for a non varying load without any output capacitor, for a chosen current error allowable.  In the example of a buck converter (this isn't what is normally in a big switching supply, but it's a little simpler explanation), you have an inductor feeding the output.  By its nature, it likes to maintain a steady current, and needs to absorb or release energy to change its current.  It's like a capacitor for current instead of voltage, in a way.  So if one end of the inductor goes to the load and feeds the output current, the other end goes to a source that's either at 0V or at a higher-than-output voltage (the ""switching"" part of switching power supply refers to something switching these voltages).  Well, when the source is at a higher voltage, the inductor current speeds up, and when it's at a lower voltage it slows down, but if you switch fast enough you can maintain it arbitrarily close to a desired level.  Capacitors are used in the output of most supplies with varying loads because they react basically as fast as possible (but also make the power supply less quick to alter its output voltage - but good thing most don't have to!).  Otherwise delay in the feedback that controls the power supply means sharp changes in load cause big voltage swings at the output, which may disrupt operation or cause damage.  The capacitors at the output help stabilize that and only need to last on the timescale the power supply needs to readjust its current output."
AskElectronics,3actjj,triffid_hunter,3,Fri Jun 19 08:30:54 2015 UTC,"Such a large PSU would probably use active PFC on the input to boost it to an intermediate voltage of around 350V*, where you would need to store enough energy to overcome the 50Hz input power drops. The advantage is that you can tolerate pretty large voltage ripple at this place (~50V should be ok) because your output regulators have great suppression at such a low frequency.   Just plugging in the numbers (500W, 50V ripple, 10ms) gives you a capacity of 300µF which should be doable at 400V.  *Edit: Probably more in the 400-600V range."
AskElectronics,3actjj,kegelwerfer,2,Fri Jun 19 08:03:58 2015 UTC,"to boost it to an intermediate voltage of around 350V   350v is too low, that's the normal peak voltage of 240v mains.  Most of the active PFC I've seen goes for the 500-600v range"
AskElectronics,3actjj,kegelwerfer,2,Fri Jun 19 08:21:38 2015 UTC,Interesting. Tbh I've never actually designed a mains PSU. What's the reasoning behind using a higher DC voltage?
AskElectronics,3actjj,triffid_hunter,3,Fri Jun 19 09:09:42 2015 UTC,"PFC (power factor correction) is a family of techniques to make the power supply ""look like"" a resistor, rather than simply cutting off the peaks which generates harmonics in the mains and thus EMI.  Usually it consists of a simple boost converter between the diode bridge and bulk storage capacitor. As long as the duty cycle remains fairly constant over each half-cycle, the input current will rise and fall in proportion to the input voltage, emulating a resistive load.  The energy stored during the peaks is consumed during the valleys, causing the capacitor to experience some ripple, but this ripple doesn't appear at the output due to the self-regulation of the switchmode converter that we're feeding.  It's also substantially less than with a regular diode bridge/capacitor arrangement, since the current profile lacks the hard edges from where the diodes kick in and out.  Since many modern power supplies are designed for the 90-264v wide input range, the input peak voltage can be as high as 375v.  If we have 375v at the input and we're boosting a large amount of energy into a capacitor, then the capacitor will inevitably be at a rather higher voltage.  It would be possible to lower the peak capacitor voltage by using a boostbuck instead of a plain boost, but it's generally cheaper/simpler to simply use a higher voltage capacitor and primary switch.  Furthermore, a higher primary capacitor voltage means less losses from primary switch devices like IGBTs which, like BJTs, have a relatively fixed Vce(sat). PFC is thus also extremely useful for the low end of the input voltage range - 90-120vAC or so, where the primary switch would otherwise have to be suitable for both high voltages and high currents.  500W at 500V is only 1A, and IGBTs can handle 500v easily, only losing 2-3W to Vce(sat) for an efficiency of over 99%. (efficiency for this one component, not the whole supply)  tl;dr: PFC not only reduces EMI/noise on the mains, but can also make power supplies more efficient."

(efficiency for this one component, not the whole supply)   Wow, never thought about it that way. Are there any disadvantages to the higher voltage (except needing higher-rated passives)? I would think the higher dV/dt might increase EM radiation, but the reduced dI/dt might compensate for this elsewhere."
AskElectronics,3actjj,triffid_hunter,2,Sat Jun 20 13:15:42 2015 UTC,"500-600V? Do you have any sources for that? Would be interested in having a higher-voltage PFC. Most PFC modules I know of, like the AIF04ZPFC lying in front of me, have an output voltage between 380V and 400V, and there are times a higher voltage would have been better.  (Besides a discrete PFC where I can vary the feedback resistor ratio and transistor voltage rating myself...)"
AskElectronics,3actjj,nikomo,3,Fri Jun 19 09:44:31 2015 UTC,"TEA1713T datasheet is a good read, and most of the active PFC stuff I've read went at least as high as 450v.  The reasoning makes sense to me, 240vAC peaks at ~350v, and you're also drawing max current during the peak, need a lot of headroom to store all that energy!  If you're only boosting to 350v, and input peak is 350v then you must be taking approximately zero current at the peak, which means your power factor is far from 1.0, completely defeating the purpose of PFC."

The TEA1713 reference design seems to target 390V (360 to 400. PFC output busses usually have a fair amount of ripple on them.

Is the system you are trying to power with this regulator going to take slugs or current or change a lot? You may need some bulk then.

This may not have been the best idea, though I can't imagine there will be much heat.  EDIT: Going through it using Figure 1 found here, the math seems to be as follows. Using a figure of 15mA at idle for the micro controller and 12V input gives roughly a 60% efficiency figure:  Pin / Pout = %eff Pin / (3.3V * 15mA) = 60% Pin = 0.6 * 3.3V * 0.015A = 29.7mW Ploss = Pout - Pin = (3.3V * 15mA) - 29.7mW = 49.5mW - 29.7mW = 19.8mW   Using a linear regulator..  Ploss = (Vin - Vout) * Iout = (12V - 3.3V) * 15mA = 130.5mW   That's quite the substantial difference even at idle.

To figure out how to use a different LED you'll need to draw out the circuit, else we can't much help.  P.S. You're measuring the voltages with respect to ground (or whatever) which is fairly pointless. Simpler to just read the voltage across the LED.  Presumably the 2V when On and 1.4V when Off, simply means that there's a bit of leakage current (when Off), but not enough to light the LED. Probably there's a Resistor across the LED which is shunting the leakage."

While the LED is off the proper way of checking the voltage going through it is to place your multimeter probes directly to its anode and cathode, not with one of the probes to ground and subtracting, otherwise the multimeter's own internal resistance sinks enough current through the LED for it to gain a bit of forward voltage, giving you a false reading."

AskElectronics,3ad8e4,bikeboy7890,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:22:33 2015 UTC,"Most of them use the same actual chip as the Arduino UNO (ATMega 328), just will less stuff around it, so the number of pins and the amount of memory is the same. The micro uses a slightly different chip but is just as capable. They can all do the same as a full size UNO.  One thing you need to keep in mind is that the Pro Mini does not have a USB connector (Nano and Micro do), so you need an external USB to serial adapter to program it.  Generally speaking I find it more convenient to prototype on a USB-enabled board and then when the code is ready, transfer it to a Pro Mini, instead of prototyping on the Mini itself.  UNO and Nano clones can be had for under $4 and Pro Mini clone is about $2 shipped, so getting an extra board is not a huge expense.  If you end up using plain 12V RGB strips, you're also going to need output transistors to drive the LEDs. One possible alternative would be to use addressable LED strips. With addressable strips, each LED has a tiny LED inside, so you can change the color and brightness of each one individually.  Addressable strips usually run on 5V and since they only take the color data from the microcontroller, you don't need additional circuitry to drive them. Bit overkill for a desk lamp, because you don't really need to control each LED separately, but the simpler circuit may be worth it.  Depending on which strip you go with, you'd also need an external 5V or 12V power supply. A simple wall wart will do the job."

AskElectronics,3aclih,agroom,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:40:12 2015 UTC,"I frequently use Li-Ion 18650's like these with a 3 battery holder.  Your estimate of 3A is probably a quite a bit high too. Each 5050 packages is made up of 3 LEDs (red/green/blue) consuming ~20mA each, so 60mA total. The strip is 12v, so 3 5050s are in run in series per section, so each 3 led section only draws 60mA. The strip you're looking at has 150 LEDs, or 30 LEDs/meter, or 10 sections/meter. 10 sections * 60mA = 600 mA per meter. So the maximum current draw for the entire 5m is 3A.  This also assumes every 5050 LED color is white (red, green & blue are all on). In reality, you'll probably not be displaying white very often, so the total current draw is going to be some % of 3A depending on what colors are being displayed. Also, since the colors are blended using pulse-width-modulation, they are technically not ""ON"" 100% of the time. In my experience, running the various color modes (not on full white) draw about 50-60% of the max.  So the max current draw for half the 5m strip is only about 1.5A. And since you likely won't be running pure white the entire time, it's actual (average) current draw will be closer to 1A. So with 3 18650s, you'll likely see about a 2-3 hour runtime with a single pack. Using a battery pack like you linked to, you should easily see 5+ hours of runtime."
AskElectronics,3absw8,Seventytvvo,4,Thu Jun 18 20:42:57 2015 UTC,"Look into the data encoding techniques used in AC coupled comms, such as Ethernet. These encoding schemes can be used to guarantee a ""minimum frequency"" of digital data, which you will want to put a fair bit north of 20kHz.  As far as injecting, you should be able to simply mix in the digital stream with the audio signal. If you need isolation, perhaps a transformer is in order?"
AskElectronics,3absw8,uint128_t,3,Thu Jun 18 21:33:37 2015 UTC,You could devise a data encoding scheme which generates a digital signal exclusively at higher frequency than the audible frequency range (make sure you never send 00000000001111111111 for example) and use a high pass filter at the inputs of your receiving GPIO.
AskElectronics,3absw8,permadaze,3,Thu Jun 18 21:21:03 2015 UTC,"Simple mixing via capacitor coupling is definitely doable with buffer amps and potentionally an inductor placed on at the AF source to avoid shorting your signal to the audio amp and potentially distorting both the amp and your digital driver.  However, there's a problem with digital signal sideband energy and cable bandwidth. If you just mash raw bitstreams on to the line, a long run of ones or zeros will produce subharmonic signals in the lower sideband.  To put this in perspective, imagine a 1Mbps signal. If you get an alternating pattern of a run of 1000 0s and 1000 1s, you create a signal that is a 1 KHz square wave, which will DEFINITELY make it through your speaker.  You can fix that problem by using signalling methods with guaranteed maximum run lengths (for example 8b/10b) at which point you just need to ensure your bit rate is more than 20KHz times the maximum run length*2. For example 8b/10b has a maximum run of 5, so your signalling rate must be more than 200Kbps if you hope to produce minimal audio frequency interference. Manchester encoding also works for this purpose, and has a maximum run length of 2 (though an efficiency of 50% as opposed to 8b/10b's 80%)  Lastly, most audio connections aren't intended to be used for signals above a few kilohertz. As such, you may not be able to get the data you need down the transmission line. DSL solves this problem by training the line and determining what frequencies transmit well and then tuning the transmitter to use them, but the circuits for that are complex and expensive. If this is entirely for a one-off project, it's cheaper and easier to use RF cables for speaker signals than it is to try and compensate speaker cabling for RF signals."

AskElectronics,3absw8,iterative,2,Thu Jun 18 20:53:56 2015 UTC,"Really, how many bits and how fast does your data change?  If it is not fast, you might be able to use sub-audible tones, or a bit fast, an ultrasonic FSK carrier."
AskElectronics,3absw8,classicsat,1 point,Thu Jun 18 22:31:45 2015 UTC,"You state that you don't want to use ""RF techniques"", but at an abstract level, that is what you have to do! Your audio signal is occupying the ""baseband"", so your ""out-of-band""-signal has to be somewhere else. That means somehow modulating a carrier. But don't be afraid - this does not mean you need a 500MHz mixer and PLL in your headphones! There are simple ways to modulate and de-modulate a signal (= shift the signal in the frequency spectrum).  One way to do it all-digital is a Manchester code. It brings its own clock, which is good (because it solves the problem of synchronizing the data), can be created stupidly trivial and decoded somewhat easily, assuming you have a microcontroller to decode it. Also, due to the embedded clock, the lowest frequency occurring will be 1/2 of the Manchester clock.  Another way is On-Off-Keying: Generate a 100kHz carrier (for instance by using a PWM module), and enable the output when sending a '1', disable when sending a '0'. Works either with a microcontroller-generated carrier or with a 555 timer and a XOR gate (when using an external data line). Add a DC-block capacitor and add the signal onto the headphone lines through a resistor. On the receiving side, use a high-pass filter and a peak detector to get your signal back.  One problem remains - framing/packetizing. You say you have GPIO pinS, i.e. more than one, and you probably want them all mirrored inside the headphones. That means you need some logic to send the state of each pin, one after the other, and you need some logic to understand which pin you are sending so that they are replicated in the correct order.  There are many ready solutions for this. You can use a microcontroller to do this for you (parallel-to serial conversion and framing using its UART/serial port) or you can use discrete logic, using a serial-in-parallel-out (SIPO) shift register + a parallel-in-serial-out(PISO) shift register + a ""SPI-over-one-wire""-solution.  Feel free to ask if you need anything clarified."

A python script reads a GPIO input, and lights an LED momentarily if it is HIGH.  The pin is tied high to 3v3 in series with a 1MOhm resistor.  A wire, connected in parallel to the input side of the resistor, connects to a piece of bare aluminum foil.  His confusion is that the LED shows a LOW input when he touches the foil with his finger, but HIGH when he touches it with the bare end of a ~6"" jumper cable."
AskElectronics,3abhgp,swingking8,2,Thu Jun 18 20:32:14 2015 UTC,"How are you expecting that circuit to work?  Generally you want to charge up the capacitor, then let it discharge through your big resistor. Then count the time until it reaches a certain voltage (if you're lucky you can use the digital pin's voltage threshold just fine). That time should be proportional to the capacitance that you have.  You probably need very fast code to do this switching. Here's some pseudocode:   Set your pin to an output low wait a little bit Set your pin to an input & start timer wait until pin reads high & stop timer   The last 2 steps are important timing wise, each step must be done as fast as possible(or a very constant/known time between the start of the timer and the input operation). The time between might also be very low if you're not touching the sensor.  I don't advise using python for this."

It's probably some round value like 100 uA, but it might be kind of rough, and the meter will calibrate any error digitally. The test current may automatically switch between different currents as the meter auto-ranges. The other meter has a finite input resistance. 10 meg-ohms is common.

Try putting it in A mode and measuring the short circuit current. Then, you can calculate the thevenin equivalent and determine if the Thevenin voltage and source impedance are suitable for your purposes.

We can assume the solar will be quite well placed, oriented and you have (wherever you live) 8 or more hours of good daylight. That means ~80Wh of energy every day. So, even with some loses charging, circuits or cloudy days should charge enough the battery until the following day. You choose a battery with 42Wh capacity.

AskElectronics,3a8jy1,jimmyswimmy,6,Thu Jun 18 03:56:42 2015 UTC,"If your CAD system is using a front-end to do parametric searches that automatically selects the correct symbol, then it's not a problem unless you try to work outside of it.  If your company is not using one then it's idiotic and probably a hold-over from more primitive CAD software that didn't support symbol/footprint parameters that could be dumped into a BOM separately from the symbol/footprint names.    In older companies it's not uncommon to find outdated and nonsensical standards that are followed out of tradition.  I once worked in a CAD department where it was mandatory that certain symbols never be rotated because it caused ""problems"".  I eventually found what was probably the culprit - an ""engineering rules checking"" tool, whose output was normally ignored, which would warn when schematic signal flow wasn't left -> right, top -> bottom.  That's it.  It's almost impossible to create a schematic with at least one net having logically-reversed signal flow and being overly-sensitive to symbol orientation doesn't help the report S/N ratio.  No other software in the tool-chain cared about symbol orientation, only the generated netlist.  Yet the department still followed the rule blindly to the point of creating graphically rotated versions of every symbol that were historically considered potential problems for a reporting tool whose output was no longer used.  An internal part number is essentially a specification.  It may be a 12K 0603 resistor, a MCU with specific firmware loaded, a subassembly built in another operation, or a wire cut to a specific length during assembly.  There may be only one source or hundreds.  In large companies these often have specification documents and drawings associated with them.  My current practice with Altium Designer is to use generic symbols for common simple devices and custom symbols for more complicated devices.  Sometimes I'll even make symbols for subassemblies that mount on a board or a debug version of a header with JTAG signal names instead of just pin designators.  For example, I have a library called ""discretes"" containing symbols for most diodes and transistors of various configurations (MOSFET-N-4PIN).  There are also libraries for specific manufacturers for more complicated semiconductors, usually with names based on manufacturer numbers (generic as possible to cover all pin-compatible variants within a family).  All these symbols only contain a part number field.    When placed on a schematic, the engineer looks up devices in the company engineering/inventory database and finds the matching part number (or asks me to create a new entry for a new device).  They enter this into the symbols in the schematic.  They then update the schematic symbol parameters from the database which sets the footprint and other parameters (manufacturer's name, part number, base electrical parameters, etc.)    The footprints are named using JEDEC standards numbers, manufacturer's package name, or something based on the name of the component series.  Generic SMT devices are in a ""surface mount"" library while everything else is in a library for each manufacturer.    The BOM is generated from the schematic and only lists part numbers and reference designators.  Database tools (custom in-house stuff) generates full BOMs, uses cross-reference tables in the DB to obtain pre-approved manufacturer part numbers and their corresponding vendor stock numbers, then obtains prices and quantity breaks (mostly by scraping html on the web sites of Digi-Key and Mouser).  It then produces order text that can be copied and pasted into web site order forms.    The only problem with this system is finding the correct symbol for each part number.  We're starting to plan for a major library overhaul and this will probably be addressed either through Altium or via custom software, probably driven by symbol/library names in the engineering DB.    Update: Clarification and typos    TL;DR: It's a stupid policy that no modern CAD software should require."
AskElectronics,3a8jy1,jhansonxi,3,Thu Jun 18 05:05:18 2015 UTC,This wouldn't be so bad if the parts carried the actual part number in the component data that it can be easily queried.  Some ECAD software are better than others in that respect.
AskElectronics,3a8jy1,toybuilder,7,Thu Jun 18 02:39:28 2015 UTC,"That sounds kinda retarded.  The only rationale I could see for something like that is if you come up with your own component classes that maybe include multiple actual parts that could be suitable.  Kind of a way to combine ""tolerances"" of sorts into the part descriptor.  But even that just seems really error prone and dangerous.  Ideally you want an engineer to verify that part substitutions are okay, but maybe for stuff like passives there could be ways around it."
AskElectronics,3a8jy1,bradn,2,Thu Jun 18 02:22:53 2015 UTC,"That is the function of an AML, or Approved Manufacturer List.

AskElectronics,3a8jy1,1Davide,1 point,Thu Jun 18 13:53:08 2015 UTC,"It's somewhat common, mainly in companies with more layers of management and purchasing. It makes it easier for the purchasing department, particularly when you don't care who makes a particular component. It's about how you specify parts on your BOM, you don't care if the 1% resistor is a Vishay or not, but if you spec the Vishay PN, then that's what you'll get. With a general/internal PN, you can specify a ""1% resistor"" and purchasing can buy whatever meets that spec. There are other benefits and trade-offs to stuff like that, but this is the main one. We've been going through similar pains at work, so feel free to ask more questions about the pros and cons."
AskElectronics,3a8jy1,imsellingmyfoot,3,Thu Jun 18 04:19:42 2015 UTC,"I think I should be more specific.  Our system gives every part on the market, regardless if they are interchangeable, an internal part number.  So 1k Vishay Resistor becomes COTS-1123-123-1K, and 1k Panasonic becomes COTS-3456-344-1K, etc.  Our symbols and footprints now have those internal names, so I have no idea what kind of part this is (other than the hint that they're both 1K - which sometimes isn't there)."

If it came across parts that were not in inventory, it would add them to a list that purchasing would get to add to inventory. Basically full BOM tie in to  inventory and purchasing. It was awesome. Also the part number had three formats LMxxxx for an assembly, xxx-yyyy for a component where say 922-yyyy were all 1/4 watt, through hole, carbon resistor, 940-yyyy were all 0603 metal film resistors, 560-yyyy were all 8mm, stainless steel, socket head machine screws. xxxxx was a drawing number for  mechanical made to order parts like un-stuffed pcbs or custom mech parts.  new company uses Eagle. Some parts have their own symbol and foot print, others use a generic and you set the >device attribute and have to check that the foot print pin out matches.

AskElectronics,3a979g,RedBenetton,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:49:54 2015 UTC,"In your case I think the amps are not enough to power your motor. What I think is happening is that when you are trying to make the car go forwards the voltage drops so much that the circuit board won't get the necessary voltage required.  In most cases where a solar panel is used, there's a battery in between. I imagine in your project you want to completely eliminate the use of batteries, so the only option in this case is to get more solar panels.  Whether two of those panels will be enough is hard to tell, generally with cheap solar panels they don't output as much as they specify, even in ideal conditions.  You are going to find that whenever the motor is getting some resistance (accelerating, going uphill) it draws more current, which lowers the voltage and might make your circuit not function anymore.  What happens if you connect your solar panel directly to the motor and measure the voltage?"
AskElectronics,3a979g,Bartulf,1 point,Thu Jun 18 08:55:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your input.   Yes, if possible, the car should run without the use of batteries in-between.  I can think of a few ways to overcome this:   (1) More solar panels connected in parallel to meet required amperage (the weight of the car brings a dilemma)  (2) The use of a rechargeable AA batteries in-between (I will have to check with my teacher if there are any rules against this)  (3) A new RC car that demands a smaller current to run (powered by batteries with lower output current/higher internal resistance than AA batteries?)  Unfortunately I do not have a multimeter/voltmeter with me, I will update on the results of the voltage output of the solar panel under direct sunlight tomorrow."

A cheap toy RC car is not going to be made using high quality energy efficient motors.  It is also going to be designed to be fun, which typically means it has should go reasonably fast, resulting in the use of larger, heavier, hungrier motors.  So you should rethink what you are going to use as the base of your build.   Also you could use a large electrolytic, or a supercap as an energy buffer.  Your circuit board should also have a large smoothing capacitor with a diode to ensure your control circuitry does not loose power when you accelerate."

This means you typically have to introduce a voltage regulator.  I suggest you measure the current and voltage that is drawn when running off of batteries so you can get a good idea of just how much power you need.

Basically, you'd have a logic clock (probably much faster than your counter clock) and two edge triggered latches A and B in series connected to your input; then you'd have a combinatorial circuit (A && !B) which would be true for exactly one clock cycle after a rising edge."

AskElectronics,3a8p0w,PlatinumX,3,Thu Jun 18 16:41:15 2015 UTC,"Almost all counter ICs have a reset pin.  Did you implement it with discrete flip flops?  Your choices for reset are asynchronous and synchronous.  Asynchronous directly sets the value of a flip flop to 0 regardless of the clock.  Synchronous resets are combined with the other inputs of the flip flops to set a particular value when asserted during the clock's rising edge.  So, you will need to maintain the synchronous reset for at least one clock edge.  If the reset signal timing is not guaranteed relative to the clock, you will need to synchronize it before using it."

A microprocessor?  If this is an academic exercise (and most of us have been there and, usually afterwards, understood the why and how of digital logic), it's instructive to draw up a state machine.  Even when you have a quasi-state, like an incrementing counter fed by a clock source.  If this is purely an implementation problem, how are you incrementing your counter?  A discrete counter (such as the 7400-series 74*68 counter, e.g. the TI SN74L68) will usually have a reset pin in which you can reset the count to zero (or whereever it starts counting from).   In the case of the 74*68, that's a \CLR, which means that it's an active-low signal, which will reset on a high-to-low transition (and keep the circuit reset when low, regardless of the clock).  Your spec sheet requires a reset on a low-to-high transition, but that's a trivial problem to fix if you have an inverter available (e.g. a 74*04, or a 74*00 with an input NAND'ed to itself) or even a discrete transistor.  Now you can reset your \CLR with a low-to-high transition!"
AskElectronics,3a80no,bradn,3,Wed Jun 17 23:14:45 2015 UTC,"N-JFETs are essentially a regular PN diode with two contacts on either side of the N region instead of the usual one contact.  When you apply a negative voltage to the P region (gate), the depletion zone expands to fill the N region and cuts off conduction between the two contacts on the N region.  If you apply a positive voltage to the gate, the diode goes into forward conduction and you get current from gate to channel. Typically this is highly undesirable.  I don't believe the conduction enhancement with small positive gate voltage (less than Vf) is significant."

Beyond 0.65V I start seeing enough gate conduction to make the 10K pot harder to turn up.  This is measured with the current probe on the drain end, so that any gate conduction isn't included in the figure.  Take Vgs= readings with a slight grain of salt, el cheapo harbor freight meter was used (but it seems in the ballpark).

AskElectronics,3a80no,dizekat,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:23:32 2015 UTC,"I came up with a trick a few months ago that I haven't yet used or seen used... probably not new but without any trick compilation it's impossible to tell.  For various sensors you may need to produce high voltage (e.g. 400v to several kV for Geiger counters and photo-multipliers) at a very low current draw, microwatts of power under normal ambient conditions. It is difficult to measure such voltage without draining too much power, with regular components. (e.g. at 2kV, a 100M resistor will draw 40 milliwatts)  So what I came up with, use a small ceramic capacitor between the HV output (which is filtered with a larger capacitor), and an input/output microcontroller pin of some very low power uc. Now there's a known trick, you can measure capacitance with just one pin, by switching it between input with pullup and output. (You would test it at a fairly low rate). Ceramic capacitor's capacitances depend massively to the voltage, something that is normally quite unwanted. (They also depend to the temperature, but it can be temperature compensated using an extra thermistor, if much precision is necessary). Reverse biased diode's capacitance could also depend on the voltage sufficiently, opening the possibility of going full magic and using just the rectifier diode to measure the output voltage as well."
AskElectronics,3a80no,AdShea,2,Thu Jun 18 01:42:27 2015 UTC,Neat... Some PIC18's have a capacitive touch sensor input peripheral that might help for a task like that.  See http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/41412F.pdf page 321

There needs to be a circuit obfuscation contest where a circuit is doing something completely non obvious. E.g. two ceramic caps are talking to each other instead of using an opto-isolator, all while measuring stuff, so it looks like it is absolutely impossible that the device would do what it does. E.g. a regulated power supply that measures voltage and temperature by using ceramic caps only, at the output side, and transmits feedback to the mains side using ultrasonic vibrations."

AskElectronics,3a8rzf,quatch,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:52:08 2015 UTC,"Tell me if I'm wrong, but what you're getting at is to connect all the 12V things in parallel with a voltage regulator.

AskElectronics,3a6tmg,Linker3000,3,Wed Jun 17 18:19:45 2015 UTC,"If you connect a circuit to the wiper of the unit and also to one of the other two terminals, you are using it as a variable resistor. If you connect the two ends of the resistance track to parts of your circuit and the wiper that sweeps the track is connected elsewhere then you are using it as a potentiometer.   In both cases it's the same, three contact device.  If you find a device with a stated resistance of 35K it should sweep between 0 and 35K but there may be ones that don't start at zero.  Note that you can get devices with a linear relationship between the spindle/wiper contact and track position, or a logarithmic relationship - the latter are generally used in audio applications to mimic the response curve of human hearing to changes in sound levels."

AskElectronics,3a6tmg,ucontrollers,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:51:47 2015 UTC,"You're using it as neither, since the wiper output is not connected to anything. If you connect the wiper to either side (of the potentiometer), it becomes a variable resistor. Also called rheostat, if you should ever stumble across that word.  What do you want to build, a simple frequency-sweepable high-pass filter? Then your numbers are a bit off. First of all, your resistor will work the other way round - 35k is off, ""0"" is filter at 12kHz.  That is the second problem: The formula for a first-order highpass like the one you are building is f = 1/(2piR*C). To get 12kHz cutoff frequency with 220uF, you need a resistance of 60 MILLIohms. That is a few orders of magnitude below your parasitic wiper resistance.  Lets analyze your corners:   ""Off"" = cutoff at 10Hz. R*C = 15900µ ""peak frequency"" = 12kHz. R*C = 13.2µ   If you use a 35k potentiometer, the lowest resistance has to be 13.2/15900 * 35k = 29 ohms. That is a reasonable value for a potentiometer!  If you use a 35k potentiometer, you have to use a 0.45µF capacitor. If you use a 220µF capacitor, your cutoff values are way too low, just like your input impedance.  If you have any more questions, feel free to ask! There are quite a few hidden pitfalls (unipolar capacitors, capacitance tolerances, impedances, wiper law (log/linear)), but that's why we're here for."

AskElectronics,3a626r,created4this,2,Wed Jun 17 21:31:12 2015 UTC,"It'd still need wrapping around in a way that doesn't pre-load it, and lets it recover after a blow. Many pressure sensors will act as a strain sensor when wrapped around a curved surface, and a sensor like the one above will typically have a near binary response so if curving it does trigger it, you might not be able to identify subsequent blows. The problem is not impossible by any means, but I would say it's the hardest part of the project.   Once the sensor is sorted it's a case of waiting for a voltage to exceed a threshold (trivial) and switching on an LED, which can either be done with a couple of transistors, or just code if using something like Neopixel strip (easy)."

AskElectronics,3a8go5,MaskedEngineer,1 point,Thu Jun 18 03:20:00 2015 UTC,"It should have a theory of operation in its users manual.  In any event, an impedance meter is much like an ohmmeter.  Impose a current, measure the voltage, compute the resistance.  To measure impedance you need to measure these over time.  Either do this at a discrete frequency and step through a range, or apply a wideband signal (white noise, for example).  When I have to do this by hand I use a discrete frequency and an oscilloscope, but I usually use a spectrum analyzer which does it for me.  Presumably it has a drive output (XOUT) and a signal input (YIN).  A fancier device might have a drive input (XIN) as well.  Connect the XOUT to your DUT's input, and YIN to your DUT's output.  If you have an XIN input, connect it to the DUT input next to wherever you hooked up XOUT.    I don't know what a neural microprobe is, but I am going to guess that this means you really want to measure the contact impedance between the probe and some neuron.  In that case my instructions above are probably not on the mark.  If I were to do that, I'd probably hook the probe up in a resistor divider, and apply the connections above to the other part of the resistor divider.  You'll then have to do some math."

AskElectronics,3a4caw,BillionaireMattDavis,17,Wed Jun 17 03:15:32 2015 UTC,"Read the datasheet. You will never have complete information from the summary.   That series of LEDs is rated maximum 1000mA forward DC current. White is 3.15V at that current, green is 3.7V. That'd 3.15W and 3.7W respectively (although if it lists 3W as an absolute max, rather than just a marketing number, you probably don't want to push it all the way to 3.7W continuously).   The numbers you cite are the forward voltage at that specific current, neither value is an operational limit.   Remember that NO diode in the world actually acts like the ""constant forward  drop"" model. That model is a zeroth order model only true close to the forward current that the forward drop was measured at. The diode in forward conduction is more accurately measured as an exponential curve i(v) = Is(exp(v/vt) - 1), where Is is reverse saturation current and vt is thermal voltage (both temperature dependent).   Notice that for a big change in forward current (vertical axis), voltage changes little due to the very fast rise of the exponential curve. This is why the constant drop model works for forward currents reasonably close to the value at which forward voltage was taken. Small signal analysis (when a DC operating/bias  current exists) also allows you to model it as a resistor, which is convenient for microwave engineering, but has a similar restriction of the current being near the operating current for the model to be reasonably valid."
AskElectronics,3a4caw,Laogeodritt,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:28:23 2015 UTC,So the lumen output would also be a lot higher at higher powers than the one listed? Would it scale roughly linearly with power?
AskElectronics,3a4caw,sleemanj,6,Wed Jun 17 05:20:45 2015 UTC,"No, it doesn't scale linearly, there are diminishing returns to increasing current to an LED.  It will be brighter running at full tilt, but not 3 times brighter.  Also running an LED at a lower current improves it's lifespan."
AskElectronics,3a4caw,gnail,3,Wed Jun 17 06:08:51 2015 UTC,"That's not quite right. Lumen is based on candela which is radiant intensity after adjustment to the sensitivity of the eye to different wavelengths of lights. It is not, however, adjusted to how brightness is perceived in the eye, which follows more of a power law.   The lumen output is roughly linear with power (pg 9 of the first one's datasheet). 800mA has roughly twice the radiant flux (and thus the luminous flux since your LED is monochromatic) as 400mA, but because our eyes' perception of brightness follow more of a power curve, doubling power doesn't make it twice as bright.   Also running an LED at a lower current improves it's lifespan.   That's also not quite right. LED's lifespan is very dependent on its temperature. I can guarantee you that a 10W LED running on full power with proper heatsinks at 40C will outlast the same LED running at 1/10 the power but at 90C because it has no heatsink. Your statement is true given the same heatsink, but the design priority should be to improve the heat dissipation of the light and not blindly reduce current. Chances are if you have to reduce the current to meet its intended lifespan, your heatsinking is inadequate."

Chances are if you have to reduce the current to meet its intended lifespan, your heatsinking is inadequate.

The amount of complexity included in such a small enclosure is going to create problems anyway (you need a microcontroller, 6 oled screens and bluetooth next to the charging electronics), so you are probably better off using a movement sensor and just run from a battery. It will also mean less points of failure as mechanical parts are usually the first to fail, especially when it needs to be cheap.

The resistor depends on the current, but the current isn't constant.   Reason: I want to turn 6v worth of D-cells or giant lantern batteries into 5v   ""D-cells"" probably means alkaline. An alkaline battery says ""1.5V"" on the label, but that's more a name than a measurement. When it's full it can be 1.55 or 1.6V, and when it's nearly empty it's more like 1V.  So 4xD batteries are actually more like 4-6V. So sometimes you need to increase voltage, sometimes you need to decrease it.  Or if you are lucky, your 5V device actually works with 4-6V, and you can just connect the battery directly.   to power/charge an iPad mini without having to find a wall outlet.   I'd be very surpriced if it would charge with less than about 4.5V, but I guess this is a small problem.  But I wouldn't try putting 6V directly on an iPad. Here's the problem with the resistor: When the iPad is done charging, or for that matter when it takes a break for any reason, the current becomes very close to zero. That means for any resistor value that would work while charging, the voltage drop is also very close to zero. So while the iPad is not charging, it gets the full 6V. USB charging is only allowed to go up to 5.25V. It will probably work with 5.3 or maybe even 5.4V, but I wouldn't put 6V on an iPad and hope for the best.  What you can do, is use more batteries to get 12V, and just use a car charger.  Or go on eBay and find a ""solar charging module"" with USB output. There are plenty of very cheap modules that can take a very low voltage (1-2 alkaline cells) and boost it to 5V, or very high voltage (like 12 or 24V), and reduce it to 5V.  Or (the options just keeps coming) you can get a DIY power bank without batteries. They are usually made for Li-Ion, but 3 alkaline is series has similar voltage. Just DO NOT charge alkaline or NiMH with that circuit."

Its purpose is to provide some Treble cut, plus stop RF from the output getting back into the input.   2 - The input Transistor does act as an Inverter, but that is irrelevant as it's function is to provide voltage gain to increase the voltage swing from the Mike. eg an Inverter can still have Voltage Gain.  3 - The L/C circuit is resonant at the Transmit frequency. Its function is to set the TX frequency, as well as to cut other frequencies. It doesn't ""create a wave"", the Antenna does that.  4 -To understand the function of Q2, you need to read up on Colpitts Oscillators.  5 - The Output stage generates RF power at a certain frequency, and this is applied to the antenna. Whether or not the Output Stage is matched to the Antenna depends on the design of both. Strictly speaking, there is no transmission line, so there can be no Standing Wave.  P.S. Don't build it. It's a terrible circuit with no interference filter (LPF) on the output. It will almost certainly cause interference to licensed services (eg Police, Aircraft, etc)."

In part 2, I was confused by some of the terminology. What do you mean by voltage swing and voltage gain?

AskElectronics,3a4989,freddy4321,2,Wed Jun 24 07:54:12 2015 UTC,"In part 1, by shunt are you saying the cap shorts some high frequency signal to ground so that it isnt picked up by Q1? How exactly does it do this, and only to higher frequencies?   The Impedance of a Capacitor changes with Frequency. By selecting the value of the Capacitor, you can control which frequencies are bypassed to ground.   In part 2, I was confused by some of the terminology. What do you mean by voltage swing and voltage gain?   With Audio, we are talking about AC signals. A weak signal will have a small Voltage swing, while a strong signal will have a large Voltage swing. The function of an Amplifier is to increase the Voltage swing, eg make a weak signal stronger.   But could you also talk about interference filters a bit more? What do they do and how do they work?   All Transmitters generate unwanted signals (mainly Harmonics) which can cause interference to other services. It is up to the designer to fit Filters to remove those unwanted signals. This usually takes the form of a Low-Pass-Filter (LPF).  But really, these are all very basic questions. As you say, you need to do a lot of study. These forums can give you a starting point, but they can't do your homework for you.  If you want to learn about Transmitters, find a copy of the ""ARRL Handbook"" and read it cover to cover.  You should be able to find old editions on-line or at ebay."

AskElectronics,3a3vgb,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:33:37 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of engineers that are ""sustaining engineering"". They keep the designs going in production. There is more employment in that area than is actual R&D design.  A lot of companies will go into a design cycle of needing new products. They will often take one of two paths:  Temporarily hire a design team. This may last only a couple years. Then they start firing people to trim it back to the sustaining engineers once the products have been developed. You can tell that they are doing this when you look back at the old schemtics and code and find that those people no longer work there. Also, when you inquire about who designed a certain product or board, the sustaining engineers reply ""Oh, he no longer works here."" Basically the company sees R&D as a short term overhead cost only during product development, and knows that the design engineers will not fit in when the R&D is over. R&D engineers often will not be happy in a sustaining engineering position.  Hire freelance design consultants. This gets rid of the hire/fire cycle mentioned above. The contract engineers know this is temporary.   Not all companies have an ongoing, continuously operating R&D department. It expands and contracts as needed. Small companies normally operate this way.  Whether a person works in R&D or in sustaining engineering is normally related to their personality and what they want out of life. R&D people are thrill seekers. Sustaining people often value stability and are more settled, desiring maybe a predictable future and working on a stable personal life.  I've always been R&D, except I tried to do sustaining for a while because it was DOD and the pay was really good, and I needed the money. I was really bored with sustaining, but I got to know this other side of engineering, and get to know the personalities of the people who prefer that."

It's just that it seems like it's a relatively small portion of the overall development of a product. I guess maybe that's what I'm wondering about? Like a project life-cycle seems to be around 1-2 years and only a small portion of that is design. So how do you stay engaged as a circuit designer?

Rookies straight out of college are normally assigned sustaining engineering work, and are observed as potential team members for R&D by the R&D teams. Voicing your interest is a good start, but they are also looking at your personality and skills. Boring paperwork for 6 months is the norm.  For personality an R&D person shows fascination with puzzles and problems and it actually energizes them. A sustaining engineer is annoyed by it. Both have the capability of solving the problems, but the attitude of the R&D person is to dive head first into the fray. The sustaining engineer frowns and tries to hammer it out straight. R&D type personalities talk excitedly about the latest bug, in kind of a happy way. An interesting bug has been found, and who can define it and squish it? R&D people throw ideas around spontaneously, and bounce things off each other. Sustaining engineers usually act grim and formal and silent. R&D people often are accused of ""acting childishly"" and are not well received in high level, formal meetings because they are spontaneous and lack an understanding of the formal political protocol that happens at those types of meetings. The leader of the R&D is that rare nerd who knows when to stop being a spontaneous R&D nerd, and knows how to interact with the formal upper level management.  Low level R&D people are considered the quirkiest by management, and they are barely tolerated. Often in meetings with a customer, the R&D people are given a lecture on ""proper behavior"", which includes thinking before talking, or just being silent. =-}  R&D involves working long hours without being asked, and loving it. Chasing the solutions becomes an addictive drug. This can hurt family life sometimes.   Having a certain skill that is weak in the R&D team is a good way to be invited for an evaluation. Doesn't mean they will keep you, if you lack the right personality to be an R&D person.  When R&D type personalties don't have mysteries to solve, they get despondent and start looking for other jobs. Management knows this, so sometimes they try to create a project just to hold on to some of them.  R&D people change jobs often. Sustaining engineers are those silent and solemn people who you see have been there for decades.  Watch the people where you work. Don't get involved in office politics.

If we assume a Vf=2 (about average for red LEDs), then you have a total Vf across the whole lot of 72V. 120-72 gives 48V across your resistors, 48/3300 gives about 14.5mA which seems about right for normal 5mm LEDs, maybe a little low for ""ultra bright"" ones. Either way it sounds like we are in the ball park.  If you remove two of the six sections then your total Vf is now only 48V, leaving 72V across across 2200 Ohms, for 32.7mA. That's probably out of spec for most 5mm LEDs, they will probably work for a bit but won't last long.  Take away 4 sections and you have Vf = 24V, leaving 96V over 1100 Ohms for 87mA. Your LEDs will be very bright for about half a second, then they will become SEDs.  If you want to shorten the segments, you need to restrict the current. The simplest option would be to just add bigger resistors, this is also the least efficient option and has some serious safety issues (actually even from the factory that thing has some serious safety issues, they should really be doing shorter runs at extra low voltage), a better option would be to match the power supply to your requirements, or ideally, use a constant current power supply."

AskElectronics,3a25oh,bradn,2,Tue Jun 16 17:32:52 2015 UTC,"It's possible to actually calculate what kind of inductance you want, a rough calculation is quite simple... however someone calculating that might call it a ""blocking oscillator"" or something likewise old and boring sounding instead of a ""joule thief"" :)  Say I'm converting 0.5 v worth of (battery voltage minus transistor's voltage drop, I would use a mosfet so that the drop is not huge) to 3v at  and I want ~10mA output current on the average. I can do that with a coil that is on for time t and off for time t/6 (neglecting parasitic capacitance for now), because I'm getting 6x the voltage out .   Let's say I want to use an oscillation frequency somewhere around 100 KHz , then the transistor will need to be on for roughly 8.5 uS and off for roughly 1.5 uS for the ratio of 6 (takes 6x longer to ramp up the given current in an inductor at 0.5 volts, than it takes to dump it out at 3 volts).   I want to deliver 70 mA of average current out of the inductor when the transistor is off (which is 1/7 of the time) and i'm getting current back out at 3 volts constant. It means that the peak current should be 140mA and linearly decreasing, dI/dt is thus 0.14/1.5E-6 ~= 93KA/s  Solving for L it's L=v/(dI/dt) , it's about 30 microHenry. You could go with lower inductance but then the peak current will be higher; if you go with higher inductance though, the frequency will need to be lower to allow for enough time to ramp up the current in the coil and ramp it back down afterwards.  The inductor must also not saturate at the current of 140mA.  Now you can just pick an inductor with the saturation current well enough above 140mA and an inductance of 30uH .  You also have to deal with some voltage drop on the resistance of the inductor at 140mA, you pick an inductor with resistance so that this value is tiny (you don't want it to be inefficient).  This ignores parasitic capacitances with which the calculation would be a lot more pain in the ass."

AskElectronics,3a25oh,bradn,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:37:21 2015 UTC,"At .5V you might have a hard time getting a BJT transistor to turn on... it would be right at the edge.  For a transformer circuit, you could probably just use a basic 115VAC->9VAC transformer backwards (a real old school large AC transformer, not the stuff in the new switching converters that phones use), then rectify the output with a schottky bridge rectifier, and buffer with a capacitor.  The circuit looks like any old AC->Transformer->Rectifier->DC power supply except you're using the transformer the other direction to boost voltage.  The voltage conversion ratio will be about the same as it originally was for that transformer, just the other direction.  Then afterwards use a linear regulator or diode drops or whatever to get the exact voltage you want if it's not close enough.  Beware that the transformer will be boosting the current drawn from the .5VAC source, compared to what the output uses."
AskElectronics,3a25oh,bradn,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:40:42 2015 UTC,"If Schottky rectifiers require a voltage of .4V, won't there not be enough voltage to the light the LED?

AskElectronics,3a25oh,iterative,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:19:12 2015 UTC,"If using a transformer on AC supply, you would use the Schottky's after boosting voltage so the .2-.4 volt drop (times 2) doesn't kill it then."

You should widen the power traces to be safe. Off the top of my head, maybe go for 0.75 to 1 millimeter traces. With all those through-hole components, I wouldn't expect you'd need dedicated test points on a project of this complexity. They're not a problem, but if they were giving you any layout headaches, you could probably safely do without. Given that you're using THT components throughout the board, I'm curious as to why you opted for SMD for R1 and L1. Is space that much of a concern? If so, why not SMD caps? I've never looked closely at barrel jacks, but that footprint looks wonky, with the two asymmetrical ground pins. Do you have a particular part in mind?"

You're right about this, but it seems like a good thing to do, I have changed them to SMD pads. I chose SMD simply because I have never used them before, and wanted to try something with them. 1206 seems like a nice big size to start with! I didn't know I could use SMD caps for decoupling/smoothing? Would SMD caps work the same as Electrolytic?

I would recommend putting the new input in parallel with the old input so that both are amplified together (with a simple resistor summer configuration). Add a separate volume control for your new input as well, so that you can keep the levels the way you want.  This approach is not perfect, because you are now amplifying your ""new"" source twice (once in the player that you connected to your amplifier, and once in your amplifier) so it may be a little bit more noisy.

AskElectronics,3a3fdi,Doubleyoupee,2,Tue Jun 16 22:38:01 2015 UTC,"The USB charger is a switching power supply.  That is, it will draw less current at 12v than it supplies at 5v.  Specifically 5/12=0.42 as much, though in practice more since it's not 100% efficient.  Within its functional range, the higher the voltage, the less current will be drawn.  If you use longer or smaller wires with more resistance on its input, then there will be more voltage drop, and it must draw more current to compensate.  I think in your case, though, you just don't have a super precise experimental setup.  Who knows if the usb device being charged has been drawing a constant amount of power..."
AskElectronics,3a3fdi,euThohl3,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:01:59 2015 UTC,"So you are saying, that when I'm measuring 0.3A draw when measuring in series at the input, it's actually outputting roughly 425mA  (or 720mA?, 2.4 times less V is 2.4 more A?) at 5V? I guess this is because of the way transformers work?  So in this scenario, using 11V>5V instead of 12V>5V on the input means it will need more current to get the same output current.  The thing is, as I said there's only 0.05 voltage drop across both input wires.  The measurement is pretty constant, hovering between 0.24-0.25A all the time. When I then use one of probes and bypass the wire directly to the terminal of the 12v adapter, measure current goes from 0.25A to 0.30A. (bypassed only 1 wire)."

Then you wire this in series (and opposite phase) to the the line voltage.  Hopefully you include a fuse, etc.  Test it first.    edit: Another approach might use a Capacitive power supply, without the bridge rectifier shown, since this is AC out."

Let's temporarily assume that's the exact value for the 2N3904's on your PCBoard.  You're putting 4.3mA into the base so you ought to get ~ 24mA from the collector.  Divide that by (oh let's just say) three because the transistor is saturated (VCE << VBE) ... so your collector is sinking 8mA.   5mA of that flows in the 1K collector resistor, and 3mA in the LED.  Voila, the LED glows."

AskElectronics,3a2m88,kitinajo,2,Tue Jun 16 19:10:40 2015 UTC,"You know that the opamp cannot possibly deliver more than Isc.  Therefore you should design your circuits such that you never ask your opamp to source or sink more than (Isc/2).  FOR EXAMPLE, in an inverting amplifier configuration, the feedback resistor connects the output pin to virtual_ground.  How much current flows in this resistor?  Vsupply/Rfb.  Since we just promised to set Iout <= (Isc/2), we have (Vsupply/Rfb) <= (Isc/2).  Rearranging,   Rfb > (2 * Vsupply)/Isc in the inverting amplifier configuration   That looks like a very practical design consequence of the opamp's short circuit current specification.  edit- the MAX current that can flow from the output pin of an inverting amplifier, is when the output is at the supply rail and the virtual_ground is at ground.  then the voltage across the feedback resistor is Vsupply and the current in the feedback resistor is Vsupply/Rfb.  we are interested in the MAX current so we make the worst-case assumption that the output is at the rail."
AskElectronics,3a2m88,fatangaboo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:13:55 2015 UTC,"It also implies bandwidth limitations when the limited output of the source tries to drive a capacitive load. It creates an RC circuit.  You would be surprised how many people learn this in college and forget it when they are out in the field.  Another thing that bites a lot of engineers in the butt is that with a lot of opamps the output impedance is not linear across its output range. It might be 100 Ohms at the center, and 1K Ohm near the rails. That causes distortion when you drive near the rails on low resistive loads. So the model for some opamps isn't just an infinite source that is resistively limited, it is more complex."

AskElectronics,3a0314,kegelwerfer,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:03:40 2015 UTC,Why does this work? Aren't you just effectively just driving the op amp down to its lowest voltage?
AskElectronics,3a0314,obsa,3,Tue Jun 16 17:54:39 2015 UTC,"I don't know how much you (or others reading this text) know about opamp outputs and feedback, sorry if I am too detailed:  Here are three circuits.  Look at the problem from the other side: to get 300mV at the output, the emitter has to be at 300mV. The base is typically 650mV above the emitter, so the base has to be held at ~950mV to keep the output at 300mV. Many opamps can drive their outputs only to about 1.5V-2V above the negative supply (same for positive). If you connect the negative supply to 0V, the opamp output can only go as low as 1.5V.   If you connect the output directly to the pass transistor base, it can not go lower than 1.5V, either. The emitter will be 650mV lower, at 850mV - too high! The opamp can not regulate the emitter down to 300mV. That is the first circuit (it uses a rail-to-rail opamp model, which can go to 0V, to show the voltages). Now add a diode between the opamp output and the base: The opamp output can go as low as 1.5V, so the voltage after the diode will be ~650mV lower, 850mV. That is the voltage at the base. The emitter is again 650mV lower than the base, so the emitter (and the output) is at 200mV - low enough! Due to the negative feedback, the opamp will increase its output voltage until it measures 300mV at its negative input. The voltages are 300mV emitter - 950mV base - 1.6V opamp output. OK, but close to the end of the regulation range. Not every opamp can do 1.5V above its negative rail. That is the second circuit. Now add a LED instead, between the opamp and the base (assuming a 1.8V voltage drop). The voltages are 300mV emitter - 950mV base - 2.75V opamp output, far away from either end of the opamp output range. Pretty much every opamp can do that. That is the third circuit.   Due to feedback, the voltage variation of the LED is irrelevant, as long as you stay within the opamp output range. You can use any device that causes a voltage difference between the opamp and the base, but a LED is the easiest.  The circuit has slightly different values, because it uses exact voltages, not human-math-friendly approximations."

Knowing building blocks really well means when you have a big schematic you can break it down into pieces and analyse it one step at a time, then put it all together to understand the overall system.   Learn how to read datasheets. They tell you the actual specs (performance and limitations) of parts, which is necessary to check whether it works in an application and how to make good use of it (for design). For ICs, they tell you what the hell the part does and how the part is to be used as well as those specs. It's essential to doing board level circuit design and analysis (which is what I assume you're looking at in terms of schematics)."
AskElectronics,3a1bid,Althaine,2,Tue Jun 16 19:16:03 2015 UTC,"Part of understanding schematics will be recognising certain patterns and how you can abstract them away into a higher level understanding of that configuration of components.  For instance, you'll often see op-amps with resistor (and possibly capacitor) networks around them. If you were to sit down and do the analysis or look up the arrangement in a book, you'd recognise it as, say, an amplifier with a certain gain or a filter with a certain cutoff frequency. Then you could draw a box around it and forget about what is going on inside and just treat it like an amplifier.  The next step is to understand why these blocks have been connected together the way they have. This requires a little more insight than recognising what the block is - you have to either understand what the circuit is doing in the first place in which case it is more obvious, or you have to be able to think about how the flow of information and power is transformed through the blocks .  For example, you can set up resistors and capacitors to act as a low-pass filter (one that removes high frequency components), but why are you doing this? Is it to remove ripples in the power supply so your sensitive components work correctly, or is it because you have an audio signal and you're chopping off the treble range?   Why are there some circuits not connected to anything else, for example the one including C2 in the upper left and the one including LED2 in the upper right. I cannot find pairs of labeled wires to show there connections (USBVCC is the only pair that seems to work out).   Another part of reading schematics is understanding that connecting wires to every single place they are physically connected would make for a very confusing schematic, so we use 'net labels' that represent that two different parts of a schematic, despite having no wires drawn connecting them, are actually connected.  For instance, C2 and LED2 are connected to the 5V power rail, labelled as '5V', down through to ground, labelled as 'GND'. A lot of different components will need to be connected to a power supply and ground, so it is very common to give these special symbols like the up arrow and straight line and use them instead of drawing wires every where.   For example what purpose do all these capacitors serve?   The majority of the capacitors are acting as filters to the power supply, ensuring that the 5V rail looks as close to DC as possible. (When something connected to the power rail switches on or off, the power rail tends to fluctuate as the load current changes. The capacitors act like little reserves of energy that they can provide or sink in order to maintain the voltage of the rail.)   When do you use a polarized one?   Typically high capacitance values are easier to make as electrolytic/tantalum capacitors, which are polarised due to the way they are constructed. So when you need a large capacitance (such as when you have a power supply that might sag by a large amount) and you know the voltage will always be correctly polarised, the electrolytic capacitor will be cheaper.   Why is the fuse in the usb module necessary?   To protect the computer's USB power rail from an overcurrent condition on the Arduino."
AskElectronics,3a1bid,1Davide,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:42:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that helped a lot. So as a rule of thumb most parts I see are there to fix the intricacies of reality (e.g. the source not being perfect 5V DC) rather then adding further logical function?  Logical function is almost purely inside the ICs, which I can imagine as black boxes, that work according to their data sheets."

The output will have a high output resistance, so it should be buffered and again AC-coupled to remove the bias.

AskElectronics,3a01wz,exp7222,2,Tue Jun 16 04:13:05 2015 UTC,"Putting them in parallel doesn't do anything too crazy, but it does (obviously) double your capacity.  It is doable to varying degrees of accuracy and friendliness to the batteries.  The best systems will balance the individual cells (you need connection points to each cell or pair of cells in the series), but it is generally accepted that this is overkill on NiMH (it's not overkill with lithium-ion though).  If you had very large cells it could be worthwhile to have individual cell management.  Another issue, many common NiMH chargers detect end of charge by watching the voltage decrease slightly at end of charge.  It depends on a charge current in a certain range (per capacity), and the effect is destroyed by putting cells in series (you can't see the individual cells change voltage).  So the best you can do is guess the state of charge of the whole series chain by the voltage it's at, and when it gets close to charged (read:  some cells are fully charged and some aren't), you should slow the charging to a rate that doesn't damage the fully charged cells.  When it hits a certain voltage, you stop charging or reduce to a low trickle charge.  When the cells start to get old, the problems get worse.  Also, the more variance in cell capacity, the more problems.  Anyway, this is the dirty technical side, but you will find chargers out there that handle 12V NiMH packs (you might not know how well they do without reading a bunch of reviews though...) - anyway, if the goal is just something that works okay, you'll be fine with a lot of them.  If you want a charger that gets the best battery longevity for a fleet of battery powered devices, more research is recommended."

AskElectronics,39xofy,rasminoj,6,Mon Jun 15 17:35:36 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: probably any old Instrumentation Amplifier such as INA126  Ok wall of text ahead here but read it through and you will learn how to solve this kind of problem.  I am 90% sure it's an op amp, but which one?  What's the power +/- going to it? +/-9? +/-12? +/-24? Maybe + and - aren't even the same, although it looks to me like a center tapped pair of batteries on the bottom of the schematic.  Pins 2 and 3 are differential inputs, pin 4 is power-, which is true for about 99% of 8 pin op amps. Looks like output is on your pin 6, and that connector also connects to ground along with pin 5 of your chip.  Many op amp choices... Looks really one off, OG maker used a socket like he expected the amp to need replacing.  At first I think ""could it be the Uber-amp? The 741? I see differential inputs, and split supplies (Vcc+ and Vcc-) they seem to match the 741 pinout so far. If it's a 741, the output on pin 6 is going out the 2 pin banana connector on the bottom right-so far so good. hmmm no feedback resistor from output to input :-(, ok open loop high gain, not so calibrated but maybe... Also the input is not ground referenced so maybe not..., and what's that something on pin 8? Resistors between 8 and 1? Nope not a 741 because pin 8 would be N.C. Not Connected""  Looks like pins 8 and 1 are gain control resistor(s) seems you even have a trimmer for fine gain probably...   So you have a probable op amp, 8 pins. Pin assignments are likely:     1. Gain     2. Inverting input (- input)     3. Non-inverting input (+ input)     4. V- power rail     5. Ground (?)     6. Output     7. V+ power rail     8. Gain  So any Google search for op amps always floods results with 741s, so my search URL will omit those, as well as any dual or quad channel amps. op amp 8 pin ""single channel"" -741 -dual -quad gain  (Off topic edit: what is all that bunch of numbers in that search URL? Is location in there?)  Maybe the 741s had all been nicked from the lab by EE201 TAs to prank the undergrads. So OG prof moves over a space and grabs a common audio amp the LM386? That has programmable gain on pins 8 and 1, but the output would have to be on pin 5 and it's not powered right then either... So not a 386 either  Hmm the Google search is not helping.  Let's try digikey instead Drilling down after just searching for ""operational amplifier"", there's like 35,000 but we can narrow that quite a bit using what we saw on the schematic:  Ok checking each Datasheet in the results one by one, and looking at the pinout of each chip (#digikey pls add chip pinout images in search results and detail pages kthxbye), the first 15 results don't work variously because  * some don't have output on pin 6 * or they are N.C. On pin 8 * or have something non-groundable on pin 5.  * Some have Gain Bandwith Product  >100 MHz amps, but doubtful OG prof was building a RF board with this wiring/layout...  Also still some little dual channel jobs sneaked in these results, they aren't the missing chip, the board is clearly a single differential pair input, and 1 single-ended output.   But result 16 is the old AD623, an Instrumentation Amplifier, which has the correct pinout: split (+/-) power supply on 4 and 7, inputs on 2/3, gain set on 1/8, output on 6, and pin 5 is ""ref"" which lets you create a virtual ground which is exactly what your circuit is doing. It's probably close to this chip, it may work except AD623 is a low power device chip, max power supply tolerated is +/- 6 volts. So if your power rails are +/-6 or less, the AD623 will probably work fine. If the voltage supply is higher, you need a different instrumentation amplifier  In fact now we know it's an 8-pin instrumentation amplifier, we can start again on digikey and get much better results oh cool only 2 pages of results now that's a little easier to manage. And guess what EVERY ONE OF THEM WILL PROBABLY WORK FINE!! (As long as you pick one with a high enough voltage rating for your power supply)  If you are at a loss, go for one of the INA* chips from TI, these are classic Burr-Brown designs that are time tested. The INA126 is probably fine and is only a couple bucks. It will handle up to like 36v so should be safe for wherever that board came from. Maybe buy a couple backups just in case."

That would also explain why the computer was complaining to you.

I just read that if you run something rated at 50mA for 1 hour, that's 50milliamp-hours, and it occurred to me that this is not 50 milliamps per hour.  So in other words you do not divide by 60 to get mA per minute and that's where my math is all wrong."
AskElectronics,39xbm2,dmc_2930,3,Mon Jun 15 17:13:01 2015 UTC,"mA is a unit of current. It's ""how much are you using in a given moment"".  Energy is current x time. You'll often hear ""Amp hours"" or ""milliamp hours"".  Your battery is 1400mA*h. That means if you draw 1400mA, it will last for one hour.  Because it's lasting for 5 minutes, you are drawing 1400 mA * h in 5 minutes, so let's do some math: 1400 mA H * 60 minutes / hour = 84000 mAminutes  Your battery last 5 minutes, so that means it's drawing 84000/5 = 16800 mA while it's flying. 16800 mA * 5 minutes = 84000 mA*min  As you can see, 50mA is not significant compared to 16800mA. Your motors draw a lot more current than your LEDs.  This is very simplified, and in the real world there are losses in these conversions and your batteries don't respond linearly, but as you can see, the power of your LEDs is lost in the noise."

So the fact that the battery is 1400 mAh @ 12v and the LEDs are 50mA @ 5v doesn't matter? I thought the LED would have the same wattage and therefore would draw less amperage because its at a lower voltage.  Also keep in mind that the 50mA rating is for a single LED.

Your DC-DC converter is probably 75%-90% efficient. We'll try it assuming 75% efficiency.  70 LEDs x 50 mA x 5 / 12 / .75 = 1944 mA.    Let's call it 2000.  In 5 minutes, those 70 LEDs will draw 2000 mA*5 minutes = 10000 mA minutes.  You were previously using 16800mA. Now you're using an additional 1944 mA.  Over 5 minutes, your new energy usage is:  (16800 + 1944 ) *5 = 93720 mA*minutes   It's drawing about 10% more energy than it was before, so as a rule of thumb you'll lose 10-20% of your flight time if you drive 70 LEDs at full brightness.  Play with the numbers and then do some experimenting. You'll get a feel for it.  Your job: How many LEDs can you drive to lose less than 5% of your flight time? What if you only want to fly for 3 minutes, but you want it REALLY bright? Ignore the weight of the LEDs in your calculations."

You've got 21 strings in parallel and each string has either 15 or 25 LEDs in series. That means each string is probably going to have about 50 Volts across it.  So what you want is a 400 mA constant current LED driver, and the output voltage should go at least as high as 50V.

I'm using IRFR3711ZPbF MOSFETs which according to the datasheet have a reverse diode that can handle 93A (if I'm reading that correctly).  How ""big"" should the flyback suppression diodes be?"
AskElectronics,39syt4,antiquarian_bookworm,0,Sun Jun 14 15:29:48 2015 UTC,"You need to find that stall current because it gives you a current value to shoot for in designing your controller. A good controller can withstand a full stall for at least several seconds, and it depends on your application. But a start up of a motor is like a momentary full stall.  If you rely on the body diode for suppression, then that puts more stress on your MOSFET. Four hefty fast schotky diodes will keep the flyback away from the MOSFET, and they will switch better. Look up ""flyback suppression of a H bridge"" to see how they need to go in. The flyback voltages can cause the MOSFETs to not switch at the right time, also, so getting rid of them has great benefits.  When the flyback suppressors are in the circuit and the motor is running you want to monitor the saturation voltage drop across the diodes with a floating scope. Then look at the datasheet for that diode, and see if the diode is going beyond specs. As the current gets too high the voltage drop will also goo too high.  It's a common mistake to design a controller that is boarderline about to blow, and then start using it or release it to production, and then find it blowing up in actual application in the field. You want to get the design right, then stress it on the bench, measure all parameters at no load and full load and stall, and make sure the components are still running within the parameters on the data sheet.  If it is going to be used outdoors, you also want to test it at high and low ambient temperature in a confined space (of the box it will be in).  I've blown up a lot of stuff designing big motor controller. They put out high voltage, high current..."
AskElectronics,39syt4,jlelectech,2,Sun Jun 14 15:46:48 2015 UTC,"I don't see any freewheeling diodes.  When you are flowing current through a motor winding and switching it, every switch-off creates huge voltage spikes seen at the motor leads and MOSFETs, unless you allow that current to go somewhere.  Your FETS should be rated for at least double your operating voltage as well.  Look at what the FETs are rated for as far as voltage, current, and power dissipation and make sure you have sufficient cooling if necessary.    Remember that a large motor like that will draw huge currents even at low duty cycle when it's starting.  Measure the winding R and V/R is your worst case locked rotor current.  That current won't be reached instantly but still we're talking about uS.  500 Hz may not be high enough without good D.C. limiting and control.   All of these things can be checked on the scope.  If you don't have a current probe then a sense resistor will let you measure current.  It'll need to be quite small, 0.1 ohm or less, because of power dissipation.    Another potential problem is dead time control if you're engaging the opposite set of switches too quickly.  Since FETs don't switch instantly there's a potential to have two symmetric FETs on at the same time which presents a short."

AskElectronics,39syt4,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:08:26 2015 UTC,"Inductor, you mean.  Also, switching losses are a huge source of heating the MOSFET.  If it were fully on your power statement would be true, but during switching, it dissipates much more power as Rds goes from Rds-on to 1Meg+.  It's not a simple analysis at that point as the Rds over time has to be considered along with the current which will change in relation to Rds.  The FET is operating in linear mode during that brief time."
AskElectronics,39syt4,jlelectech,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:14:03 2015 UTC,"Another problem with your circuit might be that you are getting shoot-through current from the use of low impedance drivers on the MOSFETs. The opto and the 1K to ground create an RC delay in snapping the MOSFET gates, and they drag up and down. That's called slew, and if the slew is unsymmetrical, you end up with the high and low side of the same power leg on at the same time, creating a dead short through one of the legs, which basically shorts your power source to ground and causes an extremely large current spike through the MOSFETs.  You're lucky you are only going at 500 Hz, because at high switching speed with bad slew the power drop across the bridge elements can become enormous, and make the heating of shoot through proportionally larger.   A ""snappy"" driver that can charge and discharge the capacitive gates of the MOSFETs really helps.  When you build a circuit like this, it is normal to put a current sense resistor in the bottom of each leg and then use a dual channel scope to examine leg synchronicity and look for shoot-through. You start out with a small motor to avoid blowing parts, and then when you think you have the timing right, you drop in the big guy."

AskElectronics,39syt4,jlelectech,5,Sun Jun 14 15:50:09 2015 UTC,"First thing, you can't control those FETs like that.  The lower FET will work this way (albeit it will have a compromised switching speed due to the pull-down style drive), but the upper FET just won't work like this usually.  Think about the gate voltage of the upper FETs.  That's Vgs, voltage gate-source.  If we consider ground your 0V reference (assuming ""turned off"", gate pulled to ground), then what is the source voltage of the upper FET?  Hint: it's not zero.  It's actually floating when the lower switches are off.  You can have all kinds of weird behavior doing this.  You really have to run a proper gate drive circuit to do this, if you're not going to use P-type or PNP transistors for your upper switch.  A lot of H-bridge diagrams oversimplify the aspects of actually creating one.    If you manage to turn your upper switch on which apparently you have, then the FET source voltage will now be ground PLUS whatever voltage can be seen across the load (motor).  As /u/antiquarian_bookworm stated, you would have to have a floating scope/probe to watch some of these voltages because they're not all ground-referenced and I think you will see that it's just doing weird stuff.  You can do this with discrete optocouplers as you are, but you will need to use separate optos and an isolated power source for upper switches (such as a little 0.5-1W DC/DC converter and I probably could send you some to try it).  Or you could use a true gate driver chip that takes care of the upper and lower drive for you and gives you individual control of each switch if you so choose.  Individual control also happens to be useful for braking, when you turn on both lower or both upper switches (recirculating current).  Also, what /u/antiquarian_bookworm stated below this, it's still an H-bridge.  You haven't changed the scheme of the switch/motor wiring, only rearranged them spatially to make the gate connections line up."
AskElectronics,39syt4,jlelectech,2,Sun Jun 14 16:29:18 2015 UTC,"Say you were actually getting a 12V drop across your motor, that means your upper FET Source pin is at 12V relative to ground, and the Gate pin is also seeing that 12V when it's ""on"", but the Vgs is the difference of those two, so the gate will not be able to turn on effectively, or you will get oscillating effects."

AskElectronics,39syt4,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:29:56 2015 UTC,"Like I said in another comment, stall current for a DC motor is = V-input / min-resistance .  At 0 RPM and DC input, there is no inductive component, only resistive, so that determines stall current.  With AC motors, those have a complex component to the stall load, so the inductance still matters since you're applying AC voltage.  For DC, it doesn't matter.  That would be the worst case current, but soft start/ramp start might be able to start it just fine.  It really comes down to rise time and control method.  That's where inductance matters, but of course inductance changes as the motor turns.  We can approximate though.  At 500 Hz, 2ms cycle, 1% duty would be 20 uS, so if 1% is the minimum D.C. possible, and we know the time constant of the motor winding, we can determine if that on time is short enough to prevent exceeding a safe current.  If so, then the motor can maybe be soft started by applying very low D.C. and then ramping it up once the motor starts spinning.  EDIT:  Got my V and R backwards this time!  I = V / R as always."
AskElectronics,39syt4,jlelectech,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:48:20 2015 UTC,"On big motors it is hard to measure winding resistance, so a cheaters method is to just stall the motor and measure directly.  Put a scope on the motor during start up and you will see this stall current. Repetitive stop and start can blow a controller, or if you have an application in which the load can stall the motor, you must design for worst case.  Servo applications are worse, because you sometimes can't have deadtime in the reversal, so you end up bucking the motor a lot, with incredible currents and flybacks and shoot through potentials. The motor is acting as a generator, so you are reverse pumping a rotating generator."
AskElectronics,39syt4,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:06:49 2015 UTC,"I forgot about motors having less than 1 ohm or so resistance.  It becomes very difficult to measure accurately with a meter.  Locking a motor can become a tricky proposition as the torque gets higher, but it's an accurate way.  EDIT:  Oh, but you can pass a smaller current through and measure the drop across the winding to determine resistance.  You don't necessarily have to pass the full voltage/current through.  Even 5A (on a 177A stall motor) would be good to get a much closer approximation than a meter would give.  BTW, OP listed stall current, assuming it's accurate.  OP can't really run that motor to stall without a 200A 12V source and can't practically design a 200A controller just to run it at 5A.  It's the wrong motor for the job, but that's up to OP.  We haven't even gotten into the aspects of a no-load current, available torque for a given current, etc.  If OP designs the controller to realistically give the power/torque needed in the application, a different motor could be found later.  It would be much easier to make it work now though, with the right motor.  Or OP should just go back to the smaller motor, make the controller work properly, then extrapolate from there."

Normally you design the high side with p channel, and they don't get PWM, and they are called the ""steering"" devices. They only change when the direction changes, so slew isn't a big deal, but saturation of the device is. A ""bootstrap"" driver is commonly used to put them solidly into saturation.  The bottom side can be logic level devices and they need to have the snappy slew to avoid heating up."
AskElectronics,39syt4,jlelectech,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:20:19 2015 UTC,"The bootstrap supply is essentially an independent supply generated by the chip that is referenced to Vs so that you can use N-type devices for upper switches.  Avoids the need for P-type altogether.  Even so, it's true that there's no need to switch both devices for current limiting.  With integrated gate drive, OP can setup the logic in code for the logic lines to the chip, then just toggle either upper or lower but not both.  There are caveats to these chips usually.  One is that you may need to switch one of the devices in particular (upper or lower) to keep the bootstrap charged up.  The IR chip doesn't mention it though.  Another is that if you want to use current sense resistors on the low side you need to always switch the upper switch and keep the lower switch always on so that current is always flowing through it.  Otherwise the current sense measurement will drop to zero every switching cycle.  Not a big issue unless trying to do more advanced control really, some controllers I worked on had sense resistors on the diodes as well to measure current when the switch was off."

AskElectronics,39rchu,ModernRonin,2,Sun Jun 14 11:20:26 2015 UTC,I'd have to divide by 4 which means that the 0.7 volt drop turns into a ~0.2v measurement.   I don't understand why you'd suffer a diode drop after the resistive divider.  Also your link doesn't work for me.

The jfet will keep the zener current stabilized.  Each jfet will be a little different current but you can maybe calibrate it out or cherrypick.    Maybe watch out for thermal effects though, I'm not sure how sensitive they are to that.  I think you might be able to get zeners around that voltage that don't care a lot, but not sure about the jfet.  And actually, on that note, if you have a fixed current, you can just use a pot instead of a zener to level shift.  Voila, now you don't need a weird specific zener and fine tuning is no big deal.  But, the downside is that the jfet temperature dependence has a bigger influence on the reading, as the zener tries to dull that a bit otherwise."

AskElectronics,39py7c,clientsoup,11,Sat Jun 13 16:48:24 2015 UTC,"How do you manage to get both a ground plane and a power plane on just 2 layers? (Maybe I misunderstood your question.)  I have been designing PCBs with only two layers for 35 years. On one side I place almost all the traces. On the other side I place the ground plane and very few jumper traces. My products pass FCC testing, even in plastic cases, and usually the first time.  So, in my experience, I would say that ground planes on a 2 layer board are good."

AskElectronics,39py7c,dukederek,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:52:52 2015 UTC,"Oh, I was just curious if you had a trick here. Thanks for your comments!"
AskElectronics,39py7c,aesthe,2,Sun Jun 14 01:46:21 2015 UTC,"I don't have nearly as much experience as you do, so jump in if you disagree, but I wanted to add on to what you said...   In a 2 layer case, you'll need to think very carefully about where you place your components on layer 1. Since you're trying to minimize traces on layer 2, you also want to minimize how many of your layer 1 traces ""criss-cross"" by optimizing component placement. More crossing nets means it's more likely you'll be forced to dive to layer 2 in order to complete a route.   For power on layer 1, you'll want to figure out how large your traces or plane shapes need to be in order to meet the current/voltage droop constraints of your parts. If your power trace is too narrow, your part will see a larger voltage drop when it draws current. If your part is something that can suddenly draw large amounts of current, the resistance of your small trace may cause the voltage, as seen by your part, to droop. Granted, this is exactly what decoupling capacitors are for, but making sure your power trace can accommodate this current load is good design and may even help you reduce your BOM costs by eliminating the need for a few decoupling caps.   Okay, so a few more details about the ground plane(s).... Layer 2 is your ground reference for the board. It's what is ""truth"" in terms of voltage on the board. A source of a lot of ""noise"" can come from a poorly-designed ground plane or one with many gaps or traces cut through it. Remember that currents always return on the ground plane, and that the ground plane isn't zero ohms! There is a very small resistor between the GND pin of your part, and GND pin of your power connector. Your goal is to make sure this resistor is as small as it can be, from any location on your board. So, if you cut a the plane with a trace, some return currents might have to go all the way around the trace to get home. This increases the resistance, which creates potentials on your plane, which can couple into any signals above it (not to mention the gap in your plane will act as a slot antenna). Fill any unused space on layer 1 with ground pours, and connect the layers' planes with gnd vias. If you're very worried about crosstalk or EMI, a rule of thumb is to space these vias 1/20th the wavelength of your highest frequency signal (remember wavelength and propagation is different on a PCB than in space!). So, if 1GHz is your highest, make sure you're tacking your ground planes about every centimeter (30cm wavelength in space, roughly 2/3rds of that in a PCB, and divide by 20, gets you ~1cm). If your frequencies are much lower and your via spacing much larger, then at least make sure every individual piece of ground pour on layer 1 is tacked to the layer 2 ground reference."
AskElectronics,39py7c,RandomUser33,13,Sun Jun 14 04:54:09 2015 UTC,"Big problem is it makes you lazy, you can just plop down a via to provide a pin with vcc/gnd but what you might not notice is that the path from the pin to the actual supply is a massive spiral around the whole board that passes through a tiny bottleneck (either of which will cause issues).  If I'm being really careful I'll route my ground tracks manually to make sure they're all reasonably short and then do a pour over the top."
AskElectronics,39py7c,1Davide,5,Sat Jun 13 22:42:51 2015 UTC,Good practice right here.   By routing the traces then pouring it's easier to visualize the actual current paths that will result.   I very much appreciate it when the PCB designer has this on his drawing in reviews.

AskElectronics,39qx3s,Tech_Entrepreneur,2,Sun Jun 14 12:25:25 2015 UTC,"I see that you have 2 different timers IC NE555  and IC NE556.  They are essentually the same except 1 is a single timer and the other is a double timer.  As for the caps and resistors you seem to have a solid assortment of values with enough pieces for 5 kits.  I would recommend you get some op-amps as well considering how common and cheap they are.   If your physics lab doesn't already have these, I would get some alligator clips.  They are useful for connecting things like power supplies.   The type of potentiometers you are looking for are called trimmers.  They will fit onto a breadboard, but require small screwdriver to adjust and are not as durable as normal potentiometers.  As for speakers you could order a small inexpensive speakers like these or you could order 3.5mm jacks and earbuds.  You could skip the earbuds and have students use their own earbuds (there is a chance they may damage the earbuds, so it should be an old pair).

AskElectronics,39qx3s,snarfy,2,Mon Jun 15 22:01:45 2015 UTC,"Some pretty standard opamps would be the LM741 or TL072 (mostly used for audio and a bit more expensive). You could also go with an LM386; it's cheap, widely available, has decent output power rating and is perfect for small audio projects. (Check online for the smokey amp and the noisy cricket) You might perhaps want to match the 2N3904 with its counterpart; the 2N3906. I see you have the BC558; nothing wrong with that but 2N3906's can usually be had cheaper and it's nicely symmetrical.  Also 1N4148 diodes are cheaper than 1N4001's, but again there's nothing wrong with your choice. it's just small signal (low current) vs rectifier diode (more current).  I'm not quite sure what equipment you have available, but having a multimeter around would be very helpful. They can be had for around 5 or 6$ on the 'bay. But mind you; they are not very safe so don't measure high voltage (i.e. mains) and other high energy circuitry with them. You could consider removing the current shunt so nothing can go wrong.

AskElectronics,39pxt3,Wirenutt,0,Sat Jun 13 18:56:27 2015 UTC,No. 1800 watts divided by 230 volts = 7.8 amps.  You'll need a diode rated 10 amps or better (allowing for 20% tolerance) in order to avoid burning up the diode.

AskElectronics,39pxt3,c8mini,0,Sat Jun 13 19:44:17 2015 UTC,"The first one you linked is fine. You're only switching grid frequency, so overrating the diode is fine.  The second link is for 3A diodes. What calculation are you making to come up with 13A? Honest question.  Edit: I think I see what you're doing. 3A means 3A. Period. The 1000v means that they will handle 1000v without failing due to excessive voltage. They are rated at 3A max current and 1000v max voltage. You don't do any math to derive a different current rating.  So no, you don't divide 1000v by 230v then multiply by 3A to get 13A. It doesn't work that way. But extra points for creativity!"

AskElectronics,39pxt3,bradn,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:24:49 2015 UTC,The RMS current is about 7.8 A so the peak current is just over 11 A.  A 10 A diode will probably be ok since the current over 10 A is for a short time.
AskElectronics,39pxt3,onions_can_be_sweet,0,Sun Jun 14 16:04:14 2015 UTC,"This is true and I forgot to specify it was RMS current, just as the voltage is RMS voltage.  For this purpose, RMS current can be treated as if it were a DC circuit of equivalent voltage, as the diode will dissipate heat as if it were 7.8VDC. Probably the biggest concern would be PIV, which may or may not be 1000v. But even if it were only 500V, he's still safe with the 325V peak the diode will see."

Something like this or this should work fine, whichever lead style is easier to work with for your project.  I like the leads-on-the-bottom ""radial"" style better for soldering most of the time, but it all depends.  These kind of caps aren't suitable for all applications (their capacitance probably drops as voltage across them increases) but they should work fine for decoupling and RC filters where you don't care a lot about the exact filter performance."

You need about 5V (recommended operating conditions in the datasheet). 3 AA batteries in series should do the trick.  USB is 5V, too. So if you have a spare cable the black and red wires make a nice supply. However think about where you plug that in. In most cases it won't do permanent harm and if it does it will only hurt that USB port. Still plan for the worst case.  I bet you have a 5V charger that you don't need anymore lying around.

Not sure why the fuse initially blew though, so I am a bit concerned about using it without a fuse. The dc Jack on this unit is busted, and the SNES uses a negative tip wallwart.

AskElectronics,39oqy9,NEXT_VICTIM,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:40:13 2015 UTC,"IF you want to get fancy, you could try some kind of optical thing. Use a paper target which is being backlit (maybe in IR) by some LEDS. Find a cheapo camera module, and a cheapo processor with enough grunt to handle a video stream. It'd be more expensive than some sensors, but if you shop around, it might acutally not be that bad.  Then, all the software has to do is monitor the video stream of the back of the paper target, and watch to see how it changes; a hit will pop a hole in the paper, which will show up in the image. A bit of work to tune which area of the image matches which part of the sensor would make scoring possible.  Possible problems are price, if the shooter gets two shots in the same hole, the paper ripping in such a way that it looks the same, and choosing the right angle for the camera so that it doesn't get hit but still has the resolving power to accurately see the target.  The positive would be that the problem becomes almost entirely software, rather than messing with little sensors. Also, you can put a proper angled or foam shot trap behind the target to prevent bounceback.   Another potentially cheaper method would just be an array of LEDS and photodiodes arranged around the edge of the target. If they're focused properly, you'll be able to see the interruption in the photodiode signal caused by the BB passing through. The software would be simpler, but tuning the optics would be harder."

If you're tense or trying to keep stable somewhere else in your body, your energy will be expended there and you won't be able to keep your soldering hand as stable.   For fluidity and range of motion, you want your arm floating (not resting on the table) or resting near the elbow. That's important for calligraphy, not for soldering.

AskElectronics,39ncup,clientsoup,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:49:07 2015 UTC,Where's your main oscillator for the processor or at the very least the PHY? Ethernet phys need a low PPM clock source at either 25 or 50 MHz (depending on MII or RMII interfaces). You're not going to get the accuracy you need with any sort of internal RC oscillator.  [Edit] Take a look at pages 93-95 of the ST datasheet. It has general schematics for what it should look like.

AskElectronics,39m6ty,mainst,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:40:31 2015 UTC,"Why do you think its busted? How are you measuring it? Its the transformer for a flyback power supply(indicated by the TNY267controller next to it). They do not typically fail unless something else fail, and that would leave big black spots on your PCB.   The side says Pulse, so I would imagine its from Pulse Electronics. Incidentally they do have a transformer for TNY-series devices called P5005NL. Its not the same transformer and its specified for a different part in the TNY series, so most likely its a custom wound transformer made by Pulse Electronics."
AskElectronics,39m6ty,petemate,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:58:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for pointing that out. I was doing a google search for the #s and thought pulse meant the type of transformer that it is. My eyes were too busy trying to find a logo.  This is a board for a fridge. I took it out and replaced a few blown resistors (those were easy).  I think it's busted because if you look on the 3rd pic there are two lines on either side of the coil that look like it burned through. The transformer also has a burnt smell to it. I could be wrong but it's the cheapest solution for me.   I'm going to send Pulse this picture and hopefully I can order one.
AskElectronics,39m6ty,petemate,2,Fri Jun 12 19:04:34 2015 UTC,"The two lines of either side of the coil is just where they put glue to keep the two halves of the core together. There is nothing alarming about this. See this picture to see how your core is put together, then it will hopefully make more sense. Also, those TinySwitch-devices(TNY) are pretty durable and have loads of proctective features, so there is little chance of the transformer being broken if the tinyswitch isn't. And it doesnt look like it.  Measure the output of power supply to check if it works. It looks like there is only one output, which is connected to C302, so measure across that capacitor and see if you have a reading. It should probably be 5V.  Finally, Pulse probably won't be able to help you. Its a custom part made for a company. Pulse wouldn't sell a clients custom parts without going through the client."
AskElectronics,39m6ty,Jcsul,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:17:06 2015 UTC,I measured across C302 and it's only showing 0.9V DC. I measured on the other side of the transformer (4 legs). There is 120V AC between each leg and ground.   Wouldn't that indicate the transformer is bad?  There is no way to tell the specs from those numbers on transformer?
AskElectronics,39m6ty,John01Doe,2,Sat Jun 13 21:31:45 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. Since you're measuring it in circuit it could mean that something else along the way has failed and is causing the whole system to not function properly. Transformers are just one of those things that almost never fail, and when they do it's usually in a big smoking flaming board charring kinda way. If you can get one for a few bucks go for it, but otherwise I would say try poking around the board more."

So long as you stay within the switching voltage and current, no biasing, no determining linear (FET) or saturation (BJT) operation, no inability to switch AC.

You're thinking of a battery tester, a very different device.  Battery tester vs multimeter   Is it likely to run the batteries down if it's constantly reading?   No.   Would it make more sense to have a momentary switch to periodically get readings?    No."
AskElectronics,39m5w8,1Davide,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:46:25 2015 UTC,"I have a few of those things. If you're getting power from an external battery (as is the case with handheld multimeters) you can safely leave it on all the time. You will drain down the battery in the multimeter but the thing you are measuring will be fine.  If you are going to be getting power from the same battery you're measuring, then yes you should put it on a switch of some sort. You could wire it to the same switch as the main power, so it's on whenever the amp's on and turns off with the amp. You will waste a tiny bit of power but it probably will be negligible compared with the rest of the unit. You could also wire it to a separate push button or switch so you could take readings even when the amp's off.  You are correct that the one thing you should probably not do is to wire it so it's constantly reading 24/7. It would be quite annoying to pull it out to use and find that the battery got wasted just sitting in the bag.   My units tend to pull around ~10-20 ma when I power them off the same 5-3.3v rail they're measuring. This is not a lot but can add up if you leave it on 24/7."

It will use some, but if its too much is up to you to decide. Typical multimeters have input impedances in the range of 1-10Meg ohm, but they are powered by a battery. This device is probably powered by the line it measures, so it will use some power.   Do you need constant readings?

For digital, class D amps: I don't know for sure.  PWM is, in theory, nearly lossless, so that could mean that virtually all power goes to the speakers. So yeah, the power rate will go up as volume increases.  A simple practical test is: how hot does the amp get? A class A amp will run very hot, even with no music playing.

Correct.   Does it make the Arduino run on 3.3V or the controller to run on 5V (or something else?) and either way, why is it that specific way?   The problem is that the Gamecube controller uses 3.3v and the arduino uses 5v. You shouldn't mix signals of different voltage levels, a logic level converter changes the 3.3v logic to 5v logic in both directions. 3.3v signals from the gamecube are boosted to 5v and then sent to the ardunio, and 5v signals from the arduino are lowered to 3.3v and then sent to the arduino.  He's most likely using a bi-directional logic level converter, but single direction versions do exist. Typically, a 5v device will work just fine with 3.3v signals, but usually 3.3v devices will NOT tolerate 5v signals.   And also, why does all the cables need to be connected to the breadboard and then to the Arduino, why not directly to the Arduino?

AskElectronics,39h9lz,TokenRedditGuy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:08:09 2015 UTC,"Here is the schematic I am using currently. It should be noted the Arduino has a USB host shield strapped on that was not present during that schematics creation.   It should also be noted that I am still learning to use Eagle so that schematic is not exactly the best piece of work. The +5v you see at the top right does not actually come into the circuit through an independent source as the schematic might suggest. Instead it is actually coming over pin 2 of the THRTL 3-pin header. I simply did not know how to convey that in any other way than you see in the schematic.  An in depth look at the project can be found here It goes through and explains all my logic and build process along with pictures. While it does not go over the incorporation of the USB shield yet, the basic concept is the same.  In addition I only feel that my issue is a result of a small brown-out since I had hooked my circuit up to my oscilloscope while plugged into an independent power source (my desktop PSU) and could not reproduce the bug. However when the circuit was put back onto the ESC's power, the brown out could be forced whenever I wanted it. In addition to that, the oscilloscope clearly showed a drop in voltage for a sliver of time, immediately after which the Arduino would freeze up and begin shooting out improper commands.  If there are other cause for that issue though then I am more than open to figuring them out and fixing them."
AskElectronics,39h9lz,TokenRedditGuy,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:45:53 2015 UTC,"If you have an oscilloscope, you could measure the battery voltage during brownout. If it's staying around 3.3V or higher, you could just directly wire the battery to Arduino's RAW pin instead of supplying your own 3.3V power."
AskElectronics,39h9lz,TokenRedditGuy,2,Thu Jun 11 21:06:37 2015 UTC,"A capacitor might help in this case, but you would also need a diode to make sure the capacitor doesn't get drained by your ESC when the voltage dips.  Size of the capacitor depends on how much current your arduino draws, and how long the voltage dip lasts."
AskElectronics,39h9lz,created4this,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:17:05 2015 UTC,I only need about 3.3v at 1.5 amps at my disposal. And even that is being fairly generous. The dip is very very short and only happens at one specific instance. I confirmed this through my oscilloscope. Basically when switching from full revers to full throttle very quickly causes an 1/8 of a second dip or there-about.
AskElectronics,39h9lz,created4this,2,Thu Jun 11 19:27:36 2015 UTC,1.5A is a lot of current for a capacitor to hold up. 1/8 of a second is also a long time for a capacitor to hold up.  You might be nearing the limits of your battery which is why you're seeing the voltage dip. Probably switching from full reverse to full throttle creates a big spike in current draw.  I'm thinking this might not be possible with a simple capacitor.  Using I= C * (dv/dt):  1.5A = 375000uF * (0.5V/(1/8s))  You would need 375000 uF capacitance if you want to only allow 0.5V drop during the dip.  It's an absurd amount that would cause you other issues.

So let's say you know your power consumption (4*1W seems a bit high (not to mention hot), maybe this can be reduced later, but for now let's say 4W). The energy required is 8h * 4W = 32 Wh.  Generally LiPo batteries have the best power density, with a cell voltage of ~3.7V. Let's say you have something like this, a 1000mAh single cell battery. The absolute max energy you'll get out of this is (very roughly) 3.7V * 1000mAh = 3.7Wh .  So to find a battery for your requirement, you would look at multiple cells of high-capacity LiPo. You'd probably want a ""series"" configuration where multiple cells are connected in series to give you a higher operating voltage. That will make generating the correct voltage for the LED much easier.  And then of course you need to consider other losses in your circuits - power conversion, LED drivers, etc.  Here is a battery pack that looks like it just might sort of work if you can trim your power requirements a bit."

Stagger the points you attach to along the traces so the intact solder mask on neighboring traces will prevent accidental bridging. If you feel they are too thin, just follow the trace back to a through-hole pin and solder to that. If you're running the wire more than a couple of inches, use some tape or hot glue to keep it secured to the board.  Also note how the VDD trace goes to connections on both sides of the damaged area. The torn out pin/trace was connecting them so you will need to restore that connection or something else will not work."

Also, the VDD definitely needs to be wired to the right of the pad.  The VDD/D+/D-/Gnd spacing seems to be sufficiently spaced apart that if you just scrape the solder mask carefully on the intact traces, you can tack-solder the pins to the traces, perhaps with the connector slightly skewed (assuming there's no problem getting everything to fit in the housing)?

AskElectronics,39gbao,CatsAreProtein,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:10:26 2015 UTC,"Serious question from an electronics noob here:  Is there a reason you have the resistors near the LED and not near the collector sides of the transistors? To my limited knowledge, it would make things a bit neater and use less components. I'll try to explain.  The current through the LEDs will change depending on how many are being operated and which ones. If only the red LED transistor is turned on:  Resistance of 3 600Ohm resistors in parallel: 1/R = 1/600 + 1/600 + 1/600 R = 200Ohm  I = V/R V = 14 - 2 - 0.3 = 11.7v  I = 11.7/200 = 58.5mA going through the transistor or 58.5/3 = 19.5mA going through each red LED  If you turn on more than one LED colour, less current will go through each component in parallel.  Rather than using 3 600Ohm resistors next to the LED, one 200Ohm resistor next to the transistor would have the same effect.  It doesn't matter if the resistor is before or after the LED, it will limit the current going through it regardless.  tl;dr I think your calculations are fine and don't worry about a resistor on the anode of the LED"
AskElectronics,39gbao,CatsAreProtein,2,Thu Jun 11 15:57:58 2015 UTC,"Just a quick correction, I actually have 4 LEDs set up in parallel here, it doesn't sound like it would make too much of a diffrence, but it makes a small one, I need to use more current in my system. More current, more power. The resistors I'm using can only handle 1/4 of a watt unfortunately :/ since I am using 4 LEDs the current through them would be 19.5*4= 78mA and thus, the power through an equivalent resistor of 150 ohms would mean that there is .0782 * 150=.913 Watts...

If you want to understand the CPU itself, design something in verilog and run it on an FPGA, or, if you feel masochistic, do it with TTL logic.  If you want to focus on the system architecture as a whole, use a CPU like the 6502, an M68k (e.g. Freescale's Coldfire), ARM, or an 8501 (some of these are not 8-bit of course). Decide if you want something with integrated or external flash and memory. Decide what peripherals you want - serial port? VGA connector? HDMI?  If you're most interested in the OS/software side, you may as well get an eval board and start there. If you want to design a PCB yourself, do that.  Do you want a ""standard"" OS? Linux? Something you wrote yourself from scratch? A simple Forth environment to poke around in?  So there's a million choices to focus on stuff that interests you. And also, there's absolutely no shame in duplicating someone else's work - when you're starting out, it's quite valuable, because you're still going to be facing many challenging road blocks, even starting from a known good design (just ask anyone who has ever designed anything based on an eval board)."

I'm not too keen on using an FPGA, and for some reason I really enjoy the idea of handwiring buses. I'm almost certain I'm going to use a 6502, although I'm not sure where I would get one. I might take an older design and modernise it's I/O with a PIA and MCU of some form. I'm going to spend a lot of time drafting schematics before I go ahead and buy components. I've never designed anything this complicated before, is there some form of emulation program I could use to help check over my work? Thanks again."
AskElectronics,39cj0r,AirborneArie,4,Thu Jun 11 15:57:04 2015 UTC,"I've recently written an emulator for the 6502 (and some other IC's for IO). It was an awesome experience and I think the 6502, together can lend itself very well to build your own computer. I mean it's what Woz did back in the day for the Apple ][, right?  Seriosly, there's tons of in out there on building 6502 based computers and the IC's are obtainable pretty well."

AskElectronics,39cj0r,Shyssiryxius,5,Wed Jun 10 22:55:55 2015 UTC,"wow!  So you're the guy who's instructable gave me inspiration to get off my ass :p  Thanks for all the effort you put into that thing. I am at the moment trying to build my own and have gone through an interesting process to learn all the hardware.  I learned about transistors first, the NPN and PNP kind, and how to build logic gates out of them. I even made a cheat sheet (incomplete http://i.imgur.com/njuW80H.png ) to tell me the most efficent way to build gates with minimal transitors. It also taught me VERY valuable lessons in TTL compatibilty, pull-up/down resistors and configurations, and how to make anything from transistors via NOR or NAND.  I then allowed myself to use the 2 input QUAD AND/OR/NAND/NOR/XOR IC's once i had made them out of Transistors. I then set out to build decoders, Mux's, adders, flip-flops, ect. with the logic IC's. Once I had made a package out of the basic logic gates and was satisfied I understood how it worked, I would sub it for it's own IC which would allow me to produce ever more complex components such as memory or the ALU.  I do have a small problem I have encountered with understanding the CD4027 IC and why I cant seem to get it to toggle if you dont mind taking a look:  http://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/38zq5i/please_help_me_understand_why_my_jk_flip_flop/  Thanks again!  EDIT: Actually might be a problem with me understanding how clocks work and drive this IC. Im going to use a 555 timer instead of my BJT - capacitor astable multivibrator I am using and see what that does for me.  Im pretty new to the 555 and you wouldn't happen to know what values I would need to have it work with the CD4027 would you?"
AskElectronics,39cj0r,skurk,3,Thu Jun 11 02:01:48 2015 UTC,"Building an 8-bit computer is quite simple, and I don't think you are out of your depth. I've built several 8- and 16-bit systems and you can whip one up in a weekend if you have the parts ready.  The easiest is probably to clone an existing system, such as the Apple I, as you suggested, or maybe a ZX81 or something similar. Obviously it all boils down to your taste in CPUs. Z80's are very breadboard friendly, and allows ""hand clocking"", while a typical 6502 usually requires a clock of at least 2-300 kHz to stay sane.  The most challenging part for me was the video signal generator. I wanted VGA output, and ended up using dual-port RAM for the video memory and use a dedicated AVR to render the video.  Another tip is to use an 64K EPROM as a substitute for PLA/addressing logic. Its D0-D7 simply connects to various /CE lines, allowing you to control the memory space down to the byte."

However, I don't think there's any guarantee that higher voltages didn't make it to a logic board further in the design.  Since that printer takes 110v directly, please be careful with touching any components inside that power supply.  You should enlist your local/neighborhood/family hobbyist who has more knowledge about these types of things.  If it was me, I'd try to remove the board if it was easily done, and try to get the board working by itself. You'd have to know (via schematics, or service manual) or guess the required voltages coming off the power supply.  Then power it up, and check those outputs to see what they are doing.  There's no way a NEW (or recent) capacitor would be bulging like that if it was still good. It looks like a couple of them gave up the ghost. I'd read the sides of each of those components, and anything not rated for 220V or greater, I'd replace.  There's so many assumptions here, but giving to your local smart dood would help narrow stuff down.  like synx508 mentioned below, it would have to be a high end printer before it would be worth fixing."

Or is it seperate from the speaker channels and I could use all three channels and still retain maximum output on each?   There are four channels on each module. two are used for speaker outputs, the other two drive the sub in parallel mode.  All channels are already bridged to gain more power from the low(ish) supply voltage.  50+50+100 = 200W total. 200W / 24v = 8.3A.   Power Supply   You're going to want more than a 70W power supply to feed a 200W amp module.  Instead, use something more like this   What kind of power should I expect from this thing, it states 100w (I'm assuming is it's ""maximum power""). Probably around 30Wx1 and 15Wx2 RMS, or do you think it does its rated at 50Wx1 RMS (It is a D-Class)?   I would be extremely surprised if you managed to pull 50W.RMS from these modules, cheap chinese modules are not exactly renowned for their attention to thermal design vs claimed ratings - typically they just claim the chip's maximum from the datasheet, which assumes a rather impressive heatsink (ie holds the chip at 25°C no matter what).  At 24v, you can only push about 35W into 8 ohms, you'll need 4Ω speakers to get the full 50W. You'd also need a 2Ω sub to get 100W according to the datasheet.  While class D is significantly more efficient than AB, it still generates heat that must be dissipated to the environment without the chips getting excessively hot.  The first thing I would do upon receiving one of those modules is to remove those pathetic heatsinks and put something more substantial on.  ps: you added a stray 'v' on the end of your Amplifier #2 link"

AskElectronics,39apaw,SteakAndAle,19,Wed Jun 10 13:48:12 2015 UTC,"Hi, professional EMC consultant here.  Here's 12 minutes ($40 at $200/hr) of free consulting.  There can be 3 things going on here.    When the compressor starts, there is a high current draw to the fridge, which in conjunction with possibly bad wiring (higher resistance) causes a voltage dip at the monitor that its internal power supply caps can't keep up with.  This is the fault of the building wiring but if your monitor's power supply caps are going, this will exacerbate the problem. The fridge motor is likely a split phase motor with a starting cap.  If the cap is bad, the motor is going to take longer to start, increasing the time of the voltage dip on the line. As your monitor only goes on the blink when the motor turns on, not when it turns off, this leads me to suspect it is not noise, but a dip.  (The explanation is complicated, but it involves the back emf of the motor windings vs. the opening time of the motor relay causing arcing.  Electrical noise is caused by contacts opening, not closing.)   Therefore:  Because it likely isn't electrical noise, conventional solutions like a ferrite on the line aren't going to help.  A surge protector isn't going to help either, as what you're seeing is a dip, not a surge.  I would suggest moving either the fridge or the monitor to a different circuit in the house.  A newer LCD monitor or new power supply may help, as the caps that hold up the power rail for the monitor might be going bad (they don't have to show visible signs to be bad).  Or it might just be a cheap monitor.  HTH"

AskElectronics,39apaw,Konsalik,4,Wed Jun 10 15:54:58 2015 UTC,"There are two likely culprits:   The monitor power supply has a capacitor that's going bad, or a capacitor that's undersized so it doesn't work when the line voltage is low (things are supposed to work at least down to 100V). Your apartment is wired badly and the voltage drop from the fridge compressor's inrush current is enough to make the monitor black out.   You can rule out 2 by turning off the breaker for that outlet and measuring the resistance between neutral and ground on the outlet. It should be less than 2 ohms (2 * 20 volts / breaker capacity)."

In my case I determined that the screen was losing signal and not itself being affected by the transient voltages caused by the fridge compressor. TL;DR I narrowed it down to the cheap ebay HDMI cables that I used at the time. I replaced it with a known good cable and the problem was immediately resolved.  I am not a proponent of expensive cables but make sure that if you are using a digital interconnect like HDMI that your cable is in fact properly shielded. I found upon opening my cable that there was no foil or mesh shielding in the length of the cable and the ferrite cores were fake solid plastic molds. One simple test for shielding is testing for continuity between the two connector bodies on the cable. No continuity is likely an indication of lack of shielding."

AskElectronics,39b01o,mduchalski,2,Wed Jun 10 15:06:39 2015 UTC,"should work if you hook it up right - make sure to get the coil polarity correct so that the auxiliary winding charges the output capacitor when the switch is off and the diode is in forward conduction, otherwise you'll have made a forward converter rather than a buck...  Something like this (just a quick sketch I threw together)  If you hook the second coil up in standard inverting mode, you'll make a mess - the voltages over both windings will be different so they'll fight each other. Best to slave the second one as in my diagram above.  here's an article on digikey about this technique - my diagram is basically the same as their first one, except I connected Cout2's +ve to ground and I put my diode on the other side of the aux winding.  Note that you'll definitely want linear regulators and pi filters to remove the switching noise, as well as extremely careful PCB layout."
AskElectronics,39b01o,triffid_hunter,2,Wed Jun 10 15:28:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not 100% certain, but I think it is not possible. At least that is how it was explained to me when I attempted it:  The coil is a current-compensated choke. What that means is that the current through one coil (phase) is normally the equal but opposite of the current through the other coil (neutral). Due to the way the coils are wound, the magnetic fields in the core cancel each other. So you can have huge currents through the coils, but the net field is zero, so the core does not saturate and the impedance seen across the regular current path is (ideally) negligible.  If you have any common-mode currents (most likely RF currents), their magnetic fields do not cancel but instead add up, because they don't flow one-in-one-out, but both-in/both-out. That means the common mode current sees the full 2x6.8µH, which filters any RF quickly.  The problem is that due to the high inductance value (many inductor turns), the core will saturate pretty quickly, somewhere in the mA range. That is the important mechanic of the current-compensated choke - you can run arbitrary currents through it as long as they cancel (differential), and the inductance acting on these currents is negligible. If you want to run non-cancelling (common-mode) currents, you get the high inductance value, but the core saturates soon.   The second big problem is that the coil is intended to filter RF transients - i.e. the magnetic material is designed to be as lossy as possible to be most effective for RF filtering. What you want is obviously low losses.  So the ""2x6.8µH 3.2A"" rating is more two ratings - 3.2A for differential currents, and 2x6.8µH, lossy, for common-mode currents. Still, I am not 100% sure about this, and maybe it will work just fine. This text is not to keep you from trying it, just to prepare you for possible failure and offer a reasonable explanation for it.  Here's what I would suggest: try measuring the inductance of only one coil. If you design a power supply, I assume you have a scope and power MOSFETs. Rig together a testing circuit that allows you to switch 12V (or so) across one coil. Measure the inductor current with your scope. Apply voltage across the inductor and measure at what current level the core saturates, i.e. the current slope bends upwards. If it is in the 3A range - great! If it is in the 10mA range - sorry.  If you have any more questions, feel free to ask!"
AskElectronics,39b01o,kegelwerfer,2,Wed Jun 10 20:52:13 2015 UTC,"The coil in question is designed for power-line filtering. I wouldn't use that one in a switching power supply. Look for coupled inductors. Also, you can look into a ""flybuck"" converter, which basically gives you a dual supply with a single converter. TI has written some application notes about it."

AskElectronics,39b01o,bradn,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:40:14 2015 UTC,"Well, its definitely designed to have a high impedance at ""high"" frequency(You'd want to attack stuff above 150kHz, because thats the lower limit of conducted emissions testing, e.g. CISPER 22). You also don't care about the inductance, you just want it ""to be high"" in order to get a high impedance. If you look at the bottom left figure on page 4 of the datasheet, you'll see that the self-resonant frequency is around 200kHz. For a DC converter you would want the frequency to be stable well into the MHz band, because your waveforms will have harmonics in that range(Obviously, its a question of practical considerations and all that stuff)."

AskElectronics,39c7p0,NoobMadeInChina,3,Wed Jun 10 21:11:06 2015 UTC,"My gut feeling is that its used for matching purposes.  How did you measure 1.5pf?  Down that low, your method of measuring and type of equipment can impact your accuracy.  Looks to be a 0604 size.  Definitely a C0G/NP0 dielectric.  Voltage rating shouldnt matter as long as you select something above the supply voltage.    And please use flux while soldering.  The quality of solder joints in RF circuits can also impact its performance.  The solder on the SMA connector looks like cold joints and may not be low-impedance especially if subjected to torque/motion/vibration (it will come loose)."

I was holding it in place with my finger for the photo so it was easier to see where the capacitor fell in the circuit. My soldering skills are bad, but they're not as bad as they look in this photo :D  Thanks for the tip, hopefully I can cross reference ""0604/C0G/NP0 dielectric"" on digikey and find something suitable."

AskElectronics,39bwdv,deNederlander,3,Wed Jun 10 18:47:18 2015 UTC,I think your best option is to have a mechanical arrangement where the motor can push the mole into its upward position and then disconnect.  Have the mole stay up by friction/magnets/ball and dimple/other and use the motor with a lever (technically cam) to quickly push it up and then immediately retract out of the way.

Disadvantages:   Balancing is limited, though it probably will be OK It will tale 40 times as long to charge the battery Temperature sensing will be limited, as the original BMS can only sense one point, and that point may be quite far from the other end of the battery If any cell develops a soft short (unlikely, but possible) the other 39 cells connected in parallel with it will discharge through the bad cell. This will at best kill the other 39 cells, and at worst catch fire.

Would the charger have to have it's own charging algorithm?   First you have to equalize the voltages, charging them individually would help.  Then, wire them in parallel and get a proper li-po charger. there's several decent ones on hobbyking and similar sites.

A BMS in a battery that you put together is marginally reliable, mostly because you may not know as much as the people who designed your laptop battery, and may make a mistake; also, the BMS you're going to find on line may not be the best; also, your battery won't be as well integrated into the product, as your laptop battery."

AskElectronics,39a8vn,Genrawir,2,Wed Jun 10 14:49:35 2015 UTC,"There are a couple of issues driving the trend.   The cost of new electronics has come down so much that paying someone money to fix something is becoming less worthwile. Especially since repairs get more complex and require more skill and experience. As the cost of new and shinier tech goes down the perceived benefit of repair does as well.  Continued miniaturization and increasing ubiquity of SMD components make things harder for hand repair as well. Repairing through-hole is much easier, and with larger components you can usually still figure out what they were after they fail. With grain of rice sized surface mounted stuff, you had better have another one to compare it to since you're probably not going to get a schematic from some random factory in China.  Also, you can deal with trace damage much more easily with through-hole PCBs, when you lose the pad for a tiny surface mount component, you're often screwed anyway.  The other factor is parts availability. A lot of cheap Chinese stuff will have part numbers on ICs that are impossible to find, and if you need something that has proprietary custom firmware, you may be out of luck.  I repair moving lights, and the number of component-level repairs I do is much lower than it was in the past. The cost of buying a replacement, or doing an RMA so they can put it back in the pick-and-place machine is lower than me spending hours on it in the shop."

AskElectronics,398xyi,triffid_hunter,3,Wed Jun 10 03:00:15 2015 UTC,"If these are the usual 0.1"" spacing single- or double-row male breakaway headers, here's my procedure:   Gently pop off the plastic piece: get a pair of side-cutters, squeeze lightly so the beveled part of the jaws lift the plastic, and work from both ends to raise the plastic bit up a little bit at a time.  Take your time and don't bend the pins. Turn on the soldering iron, grab your desoldering pump and a pair of tweezers. One at a time, melt the solder of a pin and gently pull it through the hole.  Optional: use the desoldering pump on the opposite side of the board to clean out the via while reflowing the solder (this works best if you have a Panavise or helper).  Otherwise, just remove what you can with solder braid. Clean flux off with isopropanol / rubbing alcohol."

Sometimes the cleanest way to remove something is to snip it up so each pin can be removed individually.  To melt all pins at once you can use a hot air rework, but for a big header... that's kinda a lot.  You'd have to dial it up to 11 and cover everything remotely heat sensitive with tinfoil or something."

This isn't a safety message, it's a legal one.  If you are using an SSR to switch a motor, ensure that it is specifically rated for switching motors / inductive loads. It will be explicitly stated in the documentation. Make sure the SSR is rated for the starting current your motor draws.  SSRs, as their names imply, are Solid-State devices. As such, there are no arcs when they operate, and arc suppression is not a concern with them. That is only relevant with relays / contactors (which is just a fancy name for a really big relay)."
AskElectronics,398b9v,zootboy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:32:35 2015 UTC,What I meant by using SSRs is to use an SSR for turning the relays / contactors on/off that control the pump.

AskElectronics,398b9v,zootboy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:53:20 2015 UTC,One thing I struggled with is getting the inrush current. I believe the relay rating has to support it? I haven't found a way to calculate it.
AskElectronics,398b9v,bradn,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:59:44 2015 UTC,"It's generally not possible to calculate it. If the rating plate doesn't list it, triple the continuous operating current."

AskElectronics,398b9v,doccynical,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:26:42 2015 UTC,"Your contactor should be rated for 1.5hp.

Older PSUs tend to have poorer efficiency - ie higher base power which is what's most relevant to your question.

AskElectronics,3982es,keithps,3,Wed Jun 10 01:34:10 2015 UTC,"You should probably use a bit more powerful asynchrone motor as stated before; powered directly from your fixed source (you don't need frequency controller if the speed is constant and if starting torque by the load is zero (you probably won't apply load to the saw and then start the motor).   The beauty of asynchrone motor is that the are kinda self regulating when connected to a fixed source. Let's say that you put a load onto said motor (and let's say that this motor likes to run happily at 2890 rpm), when load is applied the rpm will drop some (you can't really get around that) the nature of the motor will try to bring rpm back up to by applying more torque.  So in conclusion the speed of previously described motor is really determined by the applied load on the crankshaft; rpm will drop slightly (that is normal).  I know I'm repeating myself, but you should probably buy a bit more powerful asynchrone motor (powered by your standard outlet) as that is WAAAAY more cheaper (and simpler) solution to the given problem."

Some multimeters have a capacitance measuring mode, but that won't tell you voltage rating, dielectric type, precision, etc. Additionally, without a schematic or an analysis of what function the capacitor performs in the circuit, it's not possible to just guess what capacitor needs to be used.  On a separate note, how did this issue come about? Ceramic capacitors aren't known to fail like their fat, wet electrolytic cousins do."
AskElectronics,39802c,NoobMadeInChina,2,Wed Jun 10 00:24:02 2015 UTC,"Slightly off topic, but I beg to differ: ceramic caps do fail, just not as often.  I had an enterprise grade SATA HDD that failed due to a shorted ceramic cap on the +12V rail of the PCB.  The inrush ferrite bead/inductors was what kept the cap from turning into a firework sparkler by limiting the current.  Not knowing which of the hundred caps on the PCB it was (0204 ceramics, yay), I took a beefy power supply and probed the traces after the ferrite beads.  And off went the culprit.  Popped the drive back into my computer, everything was normal."
AskElectronics,39802c,zootboy,4,Wed Jun 10 01:23:01 2015 UTC,"Sorry I wasn't more explicit: electrolytics are known to fail just from age. Ceramics generally need to be physically damaged to fail. Basically, the conductive layers can short together if the device is crushed / cracked. But this failure mode is not very common compared to the drying out issues that electrolytics experience."
AskElectronics,39802c,zootboy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:34:43 2015 UTC,"I have found out from experience that shorting them to a piece of metal, like one of the shields on a motherboard's rear IO, you end up with a sparkler for a very small fraction of a second.  It is marginally exciting, and exceedingly aggravating.  The capacitor for the gddr5 was missing before I got the card. I got it for like $10 with the hopes that I could repair it about a year ago. I still hope to fix it and have a lot of free time this summer."
AskElectronics,39802c,zootboy,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:39:23 2015 UTC,"OK, that hints at the cap being a supply rail bypass cap. I wouldn't expect the cap to be damaged by that type of abuse. I could see the PCB trace blowing, but caps by their very nature block the flow of DC current. In other words, I think you damaged the PCB itself, and maybe even the device the cap was protecting.  But(!) there may still be hope. If it truly is just a bypass capacitor, the exact value won't be critical. So pick a value and try. I suggest 0.1uF, 16V (very pessimistic guess for safety). That looks like an 0603 size to me, but I can't tell scale very well from your pics."

Unfortunately, most if not all those types of parts will be SMT devices like this: http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Intersil/ISL54220IUZ/?qs=sGAEpiMZZMsLKVrzu2LM0Kkdf%2fpEcOep  ...and won't be easy to solder. Maybe you can find a mux that's fast enough in through hole, I dunno. You'll need something that can pass at least 12MHz signals bidirectionally.  As for your selection problem, what you can do is hijack the power coming from the USB line and have the default power-up state be all controller boards disconnected. After you make your selection, the mux can connect the USB lines and the microcontroller can supply power to that controller with a transistor (P-channel MOSFET would be the easiest to implement).

AskElectronics,398pjh,I_C_U_2,2,Wed Jun 10 01:44:12 2015 UTC,"Hi, just a few things I think you might want to ammend/check before you build this.   * That zener diode is dropping 3.3v across it in that configuration, supplying 12 - 3.3 = 8.7v to the LTC6992, assuming the current draw of the 6992 is within the right range. Perhaps try using a transistor zener regulator. The 6992 can handle up to 5.5v, so your 1n4728 is fine for this, but don't expect great results even from this sort of regulator.   * Even though your expected Fin is 150Hz, if anything should cause the output from the LM2917 circuit to exceed 1v, it will exceed the input range of the LTC6992. This may just cause clipping, but you're probably better off both checking the output from this half of the circuit using a multimeter as you run the motorcycle, but also perhaps trying to aim for a lower gain, such as 12.5 Hz/v, and then attenuating the now 0-12v output from the LM2917 with a resistor attenuator/voltage divider to drop it to 0-1v.   * Keep in mind that the LTC6992 can only source/sink 20mA, so if you are trying to drive more than two LEDs, you will likely need an output stage, perhaps using more of the transistors you're now using for the voltage regulator."
AskElectronics,398pjh,horzza,1 point,Wed Jun 10 03:02:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, when I calculated 150Hz I used a smaller wheel diameter than any motorcycle I would consider plus I added a margin of safety afterwards to ensure that it would not exceed this.

I also plan on have a power stage to the LED's.  I have yet to design this.  I am also goung to throw a switch/relay in on the 12V source up to the handle bars to turn it on and off.

AskElectronics,398pjh,horzza,2,Wed Jun 10 12:05:34 2015 UTC,"The zener needs a bit of current flowing through it before it starts to clip it's voltage. Going off the diode's datasheet you can pick a current through the Zener between 76mA and 276mA, so let's go with 87mA (this will become clear in a moment). Now calculate the resistance required for 87mA at whatever the voltage drop of the resistor is going to be. We know 3.3v is being dropped by the 1n4728, so that leaves 8.7v for the resistor, which at 87mA means you should use an 100Ω resistor."

The easiest thing to do is to grab the 74HCT595 (T for TTL-compatible input levels) instead, which will happily take an input all the way down to 2.0v.

So with a Vcc of 5V a high is 3.5V or above, a low is 1.5V or below, and everything between 1.5 and 3.5 is undefined.

If you have an unused opamp ""lying around"" in your circuit, you can perform integration simpler and cheaper (power/cost) than adding another analog channel (or adding a microcontroller in the first place).  So it is fringe cases like extremely low performance or extremely high performance applications.  The big exception is, as /u/I_knew_einstein writes, Delta-Sigma-Modulators (or sigma-delta, whatever). There, the integrator is the essential analog part of the ADC, and they are used ubiquitously.

If the signal is a 200MHz square wave, things look different, but then again a 200MHz square wave hardly has 200MHz bandwidth...  Although... It depends on the differentiation time constant, and correlated to that, the high-frequency gain. The transfer function of a differentiator is a straight line (log scale) with positive slope. If your differentiator parameters are that the system gain at 200MHz is (say) +20dB - good luck getting an opamp with 20GHz Gain-Bandwidth product. But then again, the same would apply for a high-pass filter with additional 20dB gain...

I think there are other iterative methods that end up more accurate, if they converge quickly, but I haven't tried them, and some methods that are more accurate but end up adding another pole.

The flip-flop is also the only one of these that is truly sequential [edit: the others are also sequential, but their clock works differently]: After the clock edge the outputs of the flip-flops change. Then the (combinatorial) logic between them is active for some time until it stabilzes at the new output values. Some time after that the next clock edge comes and the flip-flops accept the new (stable) data. This allows you to analyze a digital sequential circuit pretty easily.  One approach to analyze/simulate a digital circuit would be:   At the start all flip-flops hold only zeroes (a) Apply the new inputs, calculate the next values for the flip-flops generated by the logic between them Write down the new values for each flip-flop go back to (a)"

This is important because you can string along a series of flipflops and they will pass the signal from one FF to the next, one clock pulse at a time. This won't work with latches."

AskElectronics,394eln,Real-Name,7,Tue Jun 9 04:31:26 2015 UTC,"If you've got some budget, I'd consider one of the lower end Rigol scopes.  You can get a DS1052E for less than 300 and it's a nice scope for any beginner to intermediate level stuff.  There are some minor glitches in the internal software but it's not bad by any means.  One thing to keep in mind, is that if the waveform doesn't fit on the screen (vertically), it's not being recorded in memory accurately.  So like, if you use math mode to subtract the two inputs, make sure each individual input is tuned to fit on the screen, even if you turn their display off.  If you get one of the rigols, grab another set of 2 probes right away.  There may be situations you want to use both inputs and the external trigger input at the same time, and 2 probes won't get that done for you.  And having a spare isn't a bad idea in case you break a probe (it's actually pretty easy to do if you stick a probe tip on a component that overheats).  If you only care about audio level stuff, there are some USB adapters (basically glorified USB sound cards with BNC connectors attached) that are kinda adequate.  But they really don't compare to a real scope in usability and capability."
AskElectronics,394eln,bradn,7,Tue Jun 9 04:59:49 2015 UTC,"+1 to all the Rigol mentions here. Alternatively, you can check out Hantek/Tekway, they have so far proven to be worth their (even lower) price.  While I believe that a good oscilloscope with enough bandwidth (>= 50MHz) is a good investment for everyone working with electronics, if you are only working with audio there are other cheaper low-bandwidth alternatives.  Some say the DSO Nano with its <$100 price tag is a good device to visualize signals. Some say you'll have less frustration and more fun by burning the money.  If you are really limiting yourself to audio waveforms, soundcard oscilloscopes are a good but extremely cheap option. I can recommend Visual Analyzer as scope software. There are adapters from an audio jack to BNC with which you can connect a scope probe to your microphone input. If you really want to use soundcards to measure voltages, I'd recommend getting a cheap ""disposable"" USB soundcard to avoid any damage to your real soundcard. The advantage is that the ""scope screen"" is as big as your PC monitor, not some grainy 2"" postage stamp LCD.  Postage stamp LCD reminds me of the Xmega Xprotolab. $45 for a breadboard scope. It's a niche application, but small enough to be embedded into your pedal if you were so inclined. I got one of these once, and it worked fine until the display died.  If you go on ebay and search for ""oscilloscope kit"" you'll find some results in the $20 range. Julian Ilett recently reviewed one of these (although his was dead...). The kit might be a fun thing to assemble with your son (or not, some surface-mount parts, see the video). It has 1MSPS, so plenty of speed for audio signals, and switchable input amplification.  Many electronics labs throw out their old scopes. I got an old 60MHz tabletop scope from a university lab once for free. You do need some connections into the electronics community, though.  If you can get an old analog scope, that would be the best alternative (in my opinion). There is a great satisfaction grabbing these hefty knobs and feel the internal mechanics switch and resonate when you rotate them, setting into place with a satisfying click...it's quite the UI experience, not replicated by a lame old rotary encoder."

I'm a serious hobbyist so $400 for a Rigol DS1054Z or $800 for a Rigol DS2072 is an amazing quality to price ratio on the low end. (Still not super affordable on my grad student budget, though!) However, that might be a bit much for you depending on how serious you are.  If you really just need analog periodic waveform capture, you could look at finding used analog scopes (ask your local college/University) for $100–200. You could also consider a used, early model DSO for probably $200–$400 for entry level ones (at $400, might as well go for a Rigol DS1054Z).  For Rigol, TMetrix is the only authorized Canadian reseller, and they're super unresponsive in my experience, plus their shipping costs are high. Expect to pay $50–100 to ship from the US for a DSO (analog scopes are bigger and heavier, so unfortunately are quite expensive to ship anywhere). Unfortunately, I can't suggest any good suppliers who can ship from the US effectively and inexpensively—haven't had enough experience with that myself.  What kind of frequencies do you need to deal with? Expect to work with MHz-range digital stuff (e.g. SPI), or really just analog audio frequencies and maybe some audio sampling clocks (1MHz max or so to drive certain ADCs at 41-50kS/s) and PCM waveforms?  USB scopes could be adequate for your needs, but generally their accuracy, analog bandwidth, and speed (in terms of waveform capture per second and ability to capture runts or similar) will be much less than a proper DSO in the same price range. You can find them starting as low as $100.  You might consider the SeeedStudio DSO Quad. It's a toy (can't even do a 1MHz square wave well), but it's fairly inexpensive and nicely portable. However, you may be better served with a USB scope that has decent software."

AskElectronics,395hh2,ayilm1,3,Tue Jun 9 12:25:06 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be completely, brutally honest here. If you actually tried to correlate the values of the components on a raspberry pi with the ones on that motherboard based on colour, and assume that said colour is apple trying to obfuscate things, I'm really not willing to bet anything on you being able to repair this successfully. Those resistors are 0201 footprint. Soldering those buggers on is a challenge, let alone figuring out if they were all that was wrong with the circuit. Like /u/t_Lancer already said, spill damage is rarely localised to the components that show visible damage (Though it does provide a good starting point for troubleshooting).  Judging by the surrounding components, (mostly passives, crap load of decoupling and a crystal) that device is the embedded microcontroller. It's probably responsible for the all hardware interfaces/sensors; things like temperature sensors, fan PWM, clamshell hall-effect sensor, power button, etc. It'll also do low level control of the rest of the system. i.e. bringing up all of the voltage rails, enabling/disable hardware based on some other parameters. Basically anything close to electronics that isn't directly handled by the OS and CPU is managed by this thing.  A good starting point might be to use your knowledge of what's buggered to narrow down what those resistors may have been connected to. Typically, the system turning on but certain things not working is a good sign (maybe fans or backlights not coming online).  You could go brute force and try putting in some jelly bean 10k/100k resistors on the hunch that they're all GPIO. Maybe 10k if they're in series with something. Try probing the pads with respect to ground and see if any are connected, they might be pull-downs and a 10k would likely work. Of course they could well also be I2C pull ups, which need to be 4.7k, or one way level converters from a sensor. The truth is, there's no way to tell without designators and a schematic; neither of which you have. It's a crapshoot, but the alternative is a non-functioning board, which is what you already have.

When you're just measuring a single component, it's obviously the resistance across the component.

Twisted pair takes care of many current loop problems. Use CAT5/6 cables (LAN cables) to get four pairs of precision wound twisted pair cables. place the in-amp as close to the sensor as possible. If you're using CAT5, you can even make use of the extra wires to supply power to the sensor. Use a differential driver to get your signal through the cable If your ADC has a high enough dynamic range, perform DSP to eliminate the 60Hz (-> notch, as you mentioned) If the signal changes slowly (plant signals?), just average over a ""long enough""(TM) period. If the signal changes slowly, you can also add a lowpass between the sensor and the line that filters anything above ~10Hz. Synchronize your sampling to the 60Hz cycle. Move the ADC to the sensor, too, and send the digital signal down the line Modulate the signal onto a higher carrier frequency (10kHz) and add a highpass that eliminates anything in the 60Hz range."

Those have some really good bandwidth too, for higher-speed signals or modulation as you suggested in 9.  2. And here I was hoping to avoid extra boards and passing power around. For a project like the plant thing, there's also the fact that the two electrodes are ~50cm apart, so I can only go so close, and the in-amp/driver may have to contend with humidity (soil + water being poured nearby)—probably not a good idea to have a bare PCB hanging around there! (Cable would also have to split into two conductors at some point.)  5. Some of the plants we experimented with didn't exhibit any action potentials (we used a bridge circuit to detect resistance), some had some slow activity... however, others (e.g. venus fly trap) had some fairly fast spikes in activity (a few hundred hertz of bandwidth represented it well enough), so a low-pass filter (averaging window or more analog-like IIR methods) wouldn't work out to filter mains frequency.  7. Huh. Now that I wouldn't have thought of. Seems hacky, inelegant and a fair bit of work! Clever if nothing in hardware can be changed though.  8. and 9. would be great in applications where fidelity is extremely important, at the expense of quite a bit of cost/complexity on the sensor board."
AskElectronics,394sba,kegelwerfer,2,Wed Jun 10 06:53:26 2015 UTC,"1. Cheap cheap cheap and so ubiquitous, you can get them for free! There's maybe even a few lying around in your lab that you could victimize. Also high performance, good shielding (S/FTP at least), multiple (anti-crosstalk-optimized) conductor pairs...it's the bees knees! The secret gift to engineers from the multi-billion dollar networking industry.  2. I have a feeling that a guard ring/shield driver may solve that problem, but I have no solid knowledge about that. The idea is that you replace a single conductor with a coaxial cable and drive the shield to the same voltage as the center conductor (using an op-amp as voltage follower). That way, the center conductor is always surrounded by the same voltage level and external interference is absorbed by a low-impedance path. I am not sure if that helps against line interference, though. I remember a few appnotes about that...  7. Not at all! It is the easiest solution of them all and brings good results for the effort. Since it doesn't matter when in the cycle you sample, just as long as it is at the same time, you can just sample every 16.667/20ms. Solved with a one-line delay function, or choosing every n-th sample. The line frequency is fixed enough (and your ADC clock must be stable enough). The theory is that you're undersampling the 60Hz signal and it is folded/aliased down onto DC, where you can ignore it (if you are not interested in DC :-/ ). Alternatively - you can synchronize to the signal phase really easily if only you were able to measure it... Hey, wait a minute, isn't that the whole reason you posted here? Because you are measuring 60Hz? So I reject that. Hacky? Kinda. Inelegant? Just dress it in sampling theory, and all of a sudden it is an elegant hack of sampling limitations. Fair bit of work? Calling one line of code ""work"" reflects badly on what you define as ""fair bit of work"" ;-)"
AskElectronics,394sba,kegelwerfer,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:42:48 2015 UTC,"As one of the people responsible for the lab stocks (student-run lab at a university), I know we don't have any CAT5/6 available except in Ethernet/RJ-45-terminated cables we're using and a few spares. We really should have some spare cable. On the other hand, it is now on my to-buy list! (Also, a graduating student just donated a bunch of stuff to the lab literally an hour ago, we might have some CAT5/6 in there).  For the shield driver, the idea is that the shield can absorb interference, similarly to a shield grounded at one end, but being driven to the signal line's voltage reduces how much that interference could couple from shield to line? Any EM insights as to why?  For the 60Hz sampling, my comments are based primarily on two problems: first, if you need a bandwidth of ≥ 30Hz, then 60S/s sampling rate isn't very useful! You could try and sample at a multiple of 60S/s, at which point there's a fair bit of work needed to cancel out the mains pickup (sampled without aliasing), and that turns out to be fairly inelegant.  The other issue I was seeing is that the sampling clock may not be so precise—and stabilising/calibrating the clock or sync to mains isn't trivial. I'm not sure off the top of my head how precise, say, an integrated RC clock typically is (if we're going minimum part count; I'm thinking long-term RTC timing applications when it comes to the nontriviality)—if the sampling isn't synchronised, instead of aliasing the 60Hz to DC you'll get a low frequency, which is worse than a predictable 60Hz if we're talking DC signals or very low-frequency signals.  I can see that working pretty well if, say, you're working with 10-30Hz signals and can reject any mains pickup at very low frequencies due to clock imprecision. Don't take this as me rejecting the technique, it just doesn't seem useful for any applications I've previously had to deal with that has the mains pickup problem!"

Let me refer you to this PDF (Analog AN347). It seems though that while shielding protects from stray capacitances, driving the shield protects only from leakages (voltage differential conductor-shield = 0, therefore leakage current = 0). That is not related to your RFI problem, but might not hurt, depending on your source impedances.  Still, if you have 50Hz problems, they are of a magnetic origin and can not be solved with shielding (but twisted pair).  About the 60Hz sampling: yeah, I was still stuck on slow-changing signals, not the 100Hz venus flytrap. Of course, your signal better be slower than 30Hz.  I seem to recall a ceramic resonator having an accuracy around 5000ppm, or 0.5%. Sampling a 60Hz signal with a 0.5% accurate clock will alias the 60Hz down to 1/3Hz. Okay, that can seriously degrade both DC and low-frequency measurements. True, using 60Hz synchronization won't be helpful if you can't also solve the problem with long averaging (though it gives better results than averaging)."

Maybe you can halfass it with some quick connects stuck into perfboard?  Unfortunately .250 makes you have to drill out between holes, but then again I think you'd have to anyway with it that wide.  But .400 lines up.  Another possibility is just solid copper clad with holes drilled whereever you need them, and dremel away to make connection pads?"
AskElectronics,393wkk,bradn,3,Tue Jun 9 03:44:17 2015 UTC,"Now this is interesting. Is it three flip-flops? Something like Eccles-Jordans, with dual triode tubes? How did you get your hands on it? Do you know how it is supposed to work so that you can interface with it? Do you have a power supply? Can we see a better picture of it? :)  As for the connector I'm no expert, but I wouldn't be surprised if it were something that IBM manufactured themselves only for this purpose. Rigging something up yourself might be the only solution."
AskElectronics,393wkk,Updatebjarni,4,Tue Jun 9 04:33:00 2015 UTC,"Here are some additional photos: http://imgur.com/a/o7GsJ  Bonus question: can anyone give a part number for the glass-encased germanium diodes? At least one is broken, and several are rusted.  I would have expected the circuit to use flip-flops (which they called ""triggers"" back then), but it uses three Havens Delay Units - that's a patented two-triode circuit that provides 1 microsecond delay. The output is fed back to the input and clocked every microsecond to provide storage. The bit is updated from one of multiple different inputs that can be selected through AND-OR circuitry, which is built out of dozens of diodes. The module contains about 15 AND gates and 3 OR gates.  To power it, I just need a high-current power supply providing -250V, -100V, -30V, +10V, +15V, +150V, +220V, and 6.3VAC. The input signals are not exactly TTL-compatible: -30V for low and +10V for high.  I got the module off ebay. One surprise is that half the tubes in the module are the wrong tubes. Apparently someone in the past 60 years was using it as a display piece and stuck random tubes in it. This caused me a whole lot of confusion, trying to figure out the circuitry. It uses 8 dual-triode tubes: 3 triodes for the input gates, 6 triodes for the delays, 3 triodes to shape the input clock and sync signals, 3 triodes to amplify the output signals (not one per bit, strangely enough), and 1 unused. (A triode is kind of like a transistor, one control input controlling the current between two other pins.)  I'm sure the exact connector is IBM-only and lost to history, but I'm hoping to find something at least moderately usable. I figured there must be some sort of connector with two spring fingers that the tab could slide into, but I haven't been able to find anything."
AskElectronics,393wkk,Updatebjarni,2,Tue Jun 9 05:24:56 2015 UTC,"it uses three Havens Delay Units   How do they work exactly? I find historical computer memory technologies very interesting, and I haven't seen that one mentioned before.   To power it, I just need a high-current power supply providing -250V, -100V, -30V, +10V, +15V, +150V, +220V, and 6.3VAC.   How convenient... The -30V and +10V voltages are probably for output clamping, so you can possibly get away with just diodes to ground for those (one zener and one plain diode for each voltage, for example). I get a feeling you might have already figured as much.  Annoying that they need so many different high voltages though. I've seen it in engineering manuals for other IBM machines; they explain the functioning of the circuits very nicely with one plate supply and one negative supply for level shifting, but then when you look at the circuits they have maybe five different voltages without mentioning why.  I hope you get this working! Hopefully you can find authentic replacements for the broken diodes. The engineering drawings don't have component types listed?"
AskElectronics,393wkk,Updatebjarni,3,Tue Jun 9 05:44:30 2015 UTC,"IBM used the Havens Delay Unit in the NORC and 700 series computers. Note that it was just used for register storage, not main memory storage. The best explanation I've found of the Havens Delay Unit is in an appendix of IBM's Early Computers, but the patent is fairly clear too. The quick explanation is the CLAMP pulse discharges a capacitor and the SYNC pulse gates the input into the capacitor. The capacitor discharges slowly, holding the value for a microsecond until it is refreshed. One bizarre component used in this circuit is a large cylindrical resistor-like component that contains a 750uH coil and a 8.2K resistor in parallel.  For the voltages, the -100 and +150 power the tubes, -250 and +220 are used for pull-down / pull-up, the small voltages are clamps as you guessed, and the 6.3VAC / 12.6VAC powers the tube heaters of course. One thing I'm realizing is just how much power tube circuits use: notice all the 2W and 1W resistors, plus each tubs uses a couple watts just for the heater. It's going to take a lot of power to drive just this one module, and the whole computer had hundreds of these modules!  The engineering drawings do give the diode types: the black ones are ""F"" and the glass ones are ""G"". (Which is entirely useless to me.)

AskElectronics,393wkk,hmistry,3,Tue Jun 9 06:22:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah they use some power. About half of it is just in the heaters I guess, 2-3W or so in the miniature tubes, as you said.  I just put together a small exhibition about computer hardware history for a display case at my university, and remember a couple of figures: the BESK, a Swedish tube computer (this is Uppsala University, Sweden) consumed 15kW of power, while the first transistorised computer that was built (at U of Manchester, cleverly named Transistor Computer) consumed 150W. The direct comparison isn't fair because the TC was a much simpler machine, but even if you scale the figure up to the same number of devices, there's about an order of magnitude of difference in power consumption. :)  Is your module designed for 6.3V heater supply? Some IBM machines used lower voltages with the same 6.3V-rated tubes for longer component life.   The engineering drawings do give the diode types: the black ones are ""F"" and the glass ones are ""G"". (Which is entirely useless to me.)   I... laughed, hah!

I'd be very interested if you could come up with some information about rationale for the circuit designs. I'm a computer scientist, not an engineer, so I find it very informative to read about the decisions made in designing circuits (how did they pick those particular supply voltages, for example?). Rationale behind architecture too, I find the historical background interesting. Do you have anything on your blog now that is related? (and where is it?)  I've built some circuits myself based on the IBM 604 (which has exemplary hardware documentation available on Bitsavers!). Here's a counter in action:  http://www.update.uu.se/~bjarni/temp/raeknare.avi  Photos of the flip-flop modules it's made of:  http://www.update.uu.se/~bjarni/krafas/flipflop-modul/  Those capacitors were the only ones I had that were rated for the voltages, so they're fantastically oversized and the counter wouldn't count much faster than it does in that video.

You will always need an additional relay between the internal ones and any mains load, as the internal ones will fail at 120V.

From what I've read the ESC is quality (YEP 80A), and the braided wires from the ESC to motor are indeed shielded by the same shield that covers the ESC, which is connected to the negative rail. When you say ""disconnecting it"" you mean severing the shield's ground connection correct? As I understand it an ungrounded shield still acts as an EMI barrier, just not as effectively as a grounded shield. But my shielding is probably overkill anyway and that would be a really simple fix. I think the key piece I wasn't getting is that hf voltage can get back into the supply rail through the caps. I thought that since caps act as a reservoir of sorts they don't allow voltage spikes through, but obviously my understanding there is incomplete. Voltage spikes on the supply rail would certainly explain the ESC glitches - I hope I didn't fry anything. I will try ungrounding the shield and report back. One other piece I'm fuzzy about: what does adding a resistor do? Take the hf voltage down in energy and dissipate some of that energy as heat? Would a resistor lessen the effectiveness of the grounded shield like ungrounding it would.   Thank you for your advice. Learning is awesome."

Because this question proves you do not grasp the basic concept. Not to be rude or anything. But you should a least take basic electronics. Do a google search on free online basic electronics tutorials or something like that.  Here are two Link 1 and Link 2. At least read until Ohm's law. To answer your question:   Does a resistor affect the entire circuit or just where it's at in the circuit?   It depends on the circuit. Here are circuit examples .  In the 1st circuit, the answer to your question would be YES.   Because the resistor is the only component in the circuit.     In the 2nd circuit, the answer to your question would be YES.  Yes, for voltages. Because the voltage drop across the resistors will be proportional to their values because they are in series.   And also YES for current because the current throughout the circuit will be inversely proportional to the total sum of the resistors. But the current will be the same everywhere in the circuit because the are in serial.    In the 3rd circuit, the answer to your question would be YES and NO.  Yes, because the total current is equal to the sum of the current through R1 and R2.  But R1 and R2 can have different values therefore the current through them will differ also because they are in parallel.  The voltage however will remain the same as they are in parallel.    In the 4th circuit, the answer to your question would be YES. And it is a mixed circuit  Current goes through R1 first. And there is a Voltage drop. So if you increase or decrease the Value of R1. The rest of the circuit will be affected. If you do the same to R2, since It = I1 + I2 then obviously Itotal will change. Same thing goes for R3.  IF you remove R2 or R3 then we're back to circuit number 2. Remove both we're back to square 1. Remove R1 back to number 3.     After all this my point is...    Does a resistor affect the entire circuit or just where it's at in the circuit?   Yes, depending on the circuit!!! and what you are looking for when you saying affect. Are you talking about Voltage or Current or both. Are you talking about the total impedance? The list goes on and on. Which is why I say go through basic electronic. At least until you've master the principles of OHM's LAW. Good luck  EDIT: Sorry if it sounded like I'am scolding you. Which  I'm not. As I said in the beginning I don't want you to perceive me as being rude. And if in any case I was the sorry again. If you have other questions feel free to ask I'll be glad to answer. Have fun."

AskElectronics,3900ub,ucontrollers,24,Mon Jun 8 06:47:45 2015 UTC,"You should get some proper switch-mode LED drivers instead. Saves you charlieplexing or the chunky resistors while saving energy at the same time.  I really don't get charlieplexing - sure it's smart and useful in a pinch, but it's almost never worth it in a real product. The complexity slows development, makes your code an unreadable mess and when your LED fails it's not gonna be pretty. It's much better to spend a few more cents to get more channels/GPIOs on your microcontroller/driver and it leaves room for future expansion.   The exception being charlieplexing built into some Maxim LED drivers - less pins but without all the hassle! Bloody expensive though."
AskElectronics,3900ub,gnail,0,Mon Jun 8 07:26:50 2015 UTC,"I have a 12x12 grid of leds to drive, which will display my patterns. By using charlieplexing I can drive up to 240 leds from 16 outputs, using the formula   n = Pn x (Pn-1)    where n is the number of LEDs and and Pn is the number of outputs.  By using resistors I can pulse them rapidly on/off and the cost is only 20c per LED for 1 watt resistors."
AskElectronics,3900ub,kegelwerfer,3,Mon Jun 8 12:02:51 2015 UTC,"That is correct. But for the low number of 24 outputs, you can directly drive cathodes and anodes. But there's more! By driving cathodes and anodes, you can use one MOSFET/BJT per pin (24 total, 12 p-devices and 12 n-devices) and forget about having to tristate anything, and writing (and debugging!) the code becomes laughably trivial in comparison to the charlieplexed code.  Extra bonus: You need only 12 current-limiting resistors!  Super extra bonus: Use a TLC5940, you then need only 14 pins, and get programmable current limiting *and PWM dimming for free!  Super mega extra bonus: Use three MAX7219 and control 192 LEDs (with high-current transistors, again) - with only four pins, even more trivial code and 0% CPU usage (except for pattern changes)!  Seriously, I don't want to turn you off your project. But you should ask yourself - do you want to crack charlieplexing? Then by all means, go ahead! Do you want to get 144 LEDs to light up individually? Please, do yourself and your project a favor and consider alternatives. I understand your motivation - charlieplexing is a brilliant way to make the most out of tristate pins without external hardware, but it is akin to building a multi-nailclipper-contraption to cut the grass of a football field and ignore the ride-on mower at the edge of the field."
AskElectronics,3900ub,gnail,2,Mon Jun 8 23:34:00 2015 UTC,Ok. I didn't know there were so many other ways to do it with reduced number of lines. And PWM dimming would be great. Thanks.  Back to the drawing board.
AskElectronics,3900ub,kegelwerfer,3,Tue Jun 9 02:57:59 2015 UTC,"You should decide on what brightness you want as well. Multiplexing will necessarily decrease the duty cycle for each LED so your peak current will need to be higher to maintain the same brightness. Do you want the brightness of 350mA constant current (bright enough to temporary blind you) or is it just what the LED specifies? Do you want individual brightness control or are you fine with just on-off?  Unfortunately the chips that /u/kegelwerfer suggested won't do 350mA. High current, multi-channel LED driving is a rather niche field and there aren't many products available. If you really want to drive 144x ~0.6-1W LEDs going at full brightness you pretty much have to drive them individually. You might have better luck if you could get LEDs with multiple dies packaged in series (e.g. 11V 85mA instead of 2.8V 350mA) - then you can use TLC5940"
AskElectronics,3900ub,kegelwerfer,2,Tue Jun 9 06:44:11 2015 UTC,"/u/gnail is correct - you'll still need to sprinkle some power transistors in your circuit (as described here for the MAX7219). Alternatively, you could increase the current limit of the TLC5940 by simply stacking them in parallel (solder on top of each other - beware of overheating).  If you have any more questions, don't hesitate to ask! That's why we're here! And above all, I hope you're not discouraged by my/our comments here, but that they help you to have fun and learn cool stuff."
AskElectronics,3900ub,kegelwerfer,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:02:14 2015 UTC,"It's definitely escalating into a bigger project, and I may need to accumulate some more funds, but it also seems like the end results could be much more unique than I expected.   I'm also realising what a disaster it would be to have 1 LED fail in a multiplexed design and knock out a significant portion of the array. Now I'm thinking about how much redundancy each design has as well.  Stacking the TLC5940's sounds like an easy solution. I'm reading the data sheet for that one now.  As suggested above I think I'll spend a bit more on the RGB emitters and get 3x3 dies with 8-11v fvd which will give acceptable brightness at 80-100mA or excellent brightness if I can somehow run them at the full 350mA/~3watts per colour."
AskElectronics,3900ub,kegelwerfer,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:24:56 2015 UTC,"Stacking the TLCs has one ugly caveat - they are effectively linear regulators and can dissipate 2.4W at 25°C ambient. Stacking them will greatly reduce the possible heat dissipation.  A rough calculation: Assume 12V input, 6V/9V/10V red/green/blue forward voltage, 100mA current. TLC voltage drop is 6V/3V/2V, TLC dissipation per channel is 600mW/300mW/200mW, or 360mW average per channel. That means that a TLC standing alone can dissipate the heat of 6 channels if ambient stays at 25°C, which is rarely true.  Stacking two TLCs will result in the same power dissipated (half per device), but both devices have only half the surface area to get rid of the power (slightly more). If you have the space to place them side by side, things look much better (especially as you could glue these cheap heatsinks on top of them) - at the cost of more complicated PCB routing.  One advantage of external driving transistors is that the heat dissipation is spread across several devices physically apart. If you use D2PAK/TO220 transistors (wired as constant-current sinks), you can dissipate 1W per transistor without heatsinks.  Let me propose a possible solution:   144 LEDs, grouped into a 9x16 matrix (electrically, not physically). 9 high-side switches (P-channel MOSFETs, for example) connected to the LED anodes, with negligible power loss. 16 heatsinked constant-current transistors on the low side. Two 8-bit shift registers for the top side, two for the bottom side. Due to the high-side switching, each constant current sink is periodically switched to a R/G/B/R/G/B/R/G/B diode. The average forward voltage seen by the current-limiting transistor is (6+3+2)/3 = 3.6V. Your described worst case is every LED being on at 50%. We are therefore assuming 50mA average current per LED, translated to 450mA due to multiplexing (1/9 duty cycle due to the 9 anode switches). The power loss in each constant current sink is therefore 1.62W, handleable by cheap heat sinks. Now you feel confident and want to turn all the lights on. Now we are at 100mA per LED average, 900mA per LED pulsed, 3.3W per transistor. Still manageable, and now you are driving 144 LEDs at 1W each! People will be blinded! Your driver board has to dissipate 16x3.3W, or 52W, therefore you decide to add a CPU fan to blow some air over the heatsinks. If the heatsinks are physically spread out, the fan might not even be necessary. Use ShiftPWM to get PWM dimming through only four pins! You would have to modify the code to account for your multiplexing.   The power budget don't really change if you use your regular 3W RGB LEDs with 300mA, as long as you reduce the power to 4V (3x current, 1/3 voltage, same losses).  Cost for this solution:   16 NPN transistors able to handle 1A, including heatsinks: <$5 9 P-channel FETs or PNP transistors able to handle 1A: <$5 4 74HC595 shift registers: <$1 16 current sense resistors (500mW), plus other assorted resistors: <$5   The financial budget also does not change significantly if you decide to stick to the 3W RGB LEDs. I found these  (with a star base, $100 for 200pcs). Total system cost (including PCB, wiring power supply) would probably be below $200, maybe even below $150.  Now comes an important question - how do you intend to drive them? How often does the pattern change? What sort of PWM resolution do you want? What sort of patterns are you thinking of, text and lines or graphics? That dictates what sort of controller is necessary. An Arduino might suffice for precomputed or slowly changing patterns. An ARM Cortex might be needed if you want 60Hz refresh rates. If you want higher PWM resolution, you might have to resort to using an FPGA. I would recommend you look into projects with RGB LED panels, these people have to deal with 32x32x3 LEDs switched in real time."
AskElectronics,3900ub,kegelwerfer,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:38:08 2015 UTC,"I'll reply in more detail later, but for the power supply I was planning on a 750w PC PSU which has two 12v 30A rails for under US$100. Not sure if they can be parallelled, probably not. Those leds are very cheap, the 10w units are around $3 each  or hopefully less in quantity. Regarding thermal management I can add 12v fans.  What do you make of this design:  http://www.whitewing.co.uk/rgbdim48.html  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQWnLOCGpXM  It looks very robust and can do 1A per channel on all channels simultaneously. Very redundant without multiplexing, although that would mean more wiring. Buying four of them would do the job, but is outside my price range (>US$1500 total) and I'd rather make something myself anyway. Just wondering what you think of the design. He says he uses a PIC to a PWM driver to Mosfet outputs. Is that what makes it more expensive? Controlling sequencing via DMX does seem like a good idea, there are many ways to do that."
AskElectronics,3900ub,bart2019,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:42:14 2015 UTC,"Okay, I am unsure about your setup. Do you have 12x12 RGB LEDs, resulting in 432 individual channels? Or do you have 12x4 RGB LEDs, resulting in 144 channels? That does influence the design a bit.  I make very little of his design (for your case), because his design is for LED strips with built-in current limiting resistors. So he does not have to regulate current, but just switches 12V to the outputs. If you were to do this, 50% of your LEDs would be dead within the first 5 minutes. Sorry about that.  Building something like that (at least, the hardware), is not complicated. It consists of designing one driver and replicating it often enough. The magic is in the software inside the PIC (and actually cramming 48 transistors in there). What makes it so expensive? $6 per channel is not so expensive, considering he needs one good power transistor and one MOSFET driver per channel.  Controlling via DMX should work. DMX has a baud rate of 250kBaud/s, or 25kByte/s. If you use 8-bit PWM values, you can issue 25.000 updates per second. At 144 channels, that is an update rate of 170Hz. Many DMX sources will do only 50Hz at all, so you're on the safe side."
AskElectronics,3900ub,created4this,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:07:49 2015 UTC,"I was just reading about how multiplexing reduces brightness and yes I really do need the full 350mA (1 watt per colour), which might be difficult. I will be lighting up some large opaque lanterns, and I want them to be brightly lit from a distance.  And yeah individual control as well, ideally PWM, or at minimum the ability to rapidly pulse and flicker.   Multiple dies is a good idea. I've found some 3x3 series connected RGB emitters with an 8-11v fvd per colour. They are more expensive due to higher power rating (10w if you believe the seller) but I could try running some at lower current (~100mA per colour for 1watt per colour) and see the result.

AskElectronics,3900ub,quitte,10,Tue Jun 9 12:02:30 2015 UTC,"I am afraid charlieplexing won't really work for your case, as it is more intended for low-current LEDs. Building a tristatable high-current driver defeats the purpose of charlieplexing (using no external hardware).  I think you will have to ""bite the bullet"" and get a proper external solution. Chips like the TLC5940, MAX7219 or TPIC6B595 come to mind. However, all of these have a current limit of < 350mA.  What sort of lighting pattern do you intend? Can you properly cool the high-power LEDs when they are arranged in a 3D shape? what sort of duty cycle and power are you aiming for?  You could obviously use MOSFET pairs (P and N in one package) and manually create a tristate driver that way. It uses two pins per pair (one for each gate), so you won't save pins. But you could easily switch 100+A per transistor, so current is not your limiting  factor anymore."
AskElectronics,3900ub,fatangaboo,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:36:35 2015 UTC,"I was just thinking, perhaps I can use high current opto-isolators?  It means one for every LED, so 144 of them, but some are priced okay at 100+ quantity, and it might be cheaper than any other solution. Since each one is only driving one LED it only needs to pass LED current, 350mA.  I'm going to monitor LED temperature and see if they require heatsinks. Each one is RGB 3x1watt but most display patterns only use 1-2 colours at a time, and pulse and flicker so the duty cycle is low. Average power should be below 1 watt. The cheapest LED heatsinks I've found are US$1.50 each just for tiny ones so it could add a significant cost."
AskElectronics,3900ub,tlbutcher24,3,Mon Jun 8 12:06:02 2015 UTC,"What are high-current optoisolators? Please don't be fooled by MOSFET driver optoisolators, they can drive ""3A"" but the ones I know are spec'ed for only a few microseconds (charge a MOSFET gate with 2A and be done with it), not for continuous conduction. But I would love to be taught wrong here!  I fear optoisolators will not be what you're looking for. Optoisolators have something called a current transfer ratio (CTR) - current x goes through the diode, current y = CTR*x can run through the output transistor. With cheap optoisolators, the rule is ""the higher the CTR, the slower it switches"" (roughly). Sure, you can get more expensive ones, that have internal buffers. But they'll need an external supply, and they are expensive.  Still, I don't get how optoisolators help you. What do you hope to achieve with them? Effectively, they are pretending to be transistors but doing a bad job; you only use them for the isolating action. I don't see where you would profit from that isolation that you would accept the huge downside (slower, bigger, less current, more expensive).  You don't have to monitor LED temperature, there are many comparisons online. You can pretend that your LEDs are similar to TO220 transistors (in size and dissipation, for a first-order estimate). A rule of thumb is that a TO220, standing in stationary free air can dissipate ~1W and become hot (+65°C, IIRC), but not too hot. Your LED will behave similarly (similar size - i guess, similar materials). So 1W, as long as it is not crowded with other LEDs emitting 1W and heating up the ambient air. If you have the typical RGB hex-star, it might be able to dissipate a little bit more.  So your power budget is ~1W: 33%DC for RGB, 66%DC for two colors, 100%DC for three colors. Once again, only for lone LEDs not heated by neighboring LEDs. So great, you might be able to deal without heatsinks. But I'd still recommend them.  Looking for heatsinks? Get better sources! Going to aliexpress and entering ""led heatsink 100pcs"" gives this result, for <$50, and they are big enough to dissipate far more than you need. A bit small, but probably big enough for your application, would be this link, where 100 heatsinks cost $5.12, including shipping.  What do you really want to do?"
AskElectronics,3900ub,dave_ee,2,Mon Jun 8 23:50:33 2015 UTC,I see. Opto-isolators are not going to be suitable in that case. The other chips suggested above are probably going to be much better.

AskElectronics,3900ub,tlbutcher24,2,Tue Jun 9 03:13:19 2015 UTC,"You need a buffer. A pair of power MOSfets might do, configured like a standard CMOS inverter, but do remember that output will indeed be inverted.  But that won't give you a 3-state output.  I don't think there's a simple solution for that. You'll probably need a pair of Arduino outputs, one for each MOSTfets. You do have to make absolutely sure to never ever open both of them at the same time."
AskElectronics,3900ub,dave_ee,5,Mon Jun 8 10:24:19 2015 UTC,"A pair of transistors gives you tristate, turn a on you get +ve, turn b on you get negative, turn neither on you get floating, turn both in you get smoke.   With mosfets thus clearly requires two digital outputs per high current driver, because you need to be able to independently switch each transistor and without /driving/ the gate it will float until one or the other or both turn on.   Now, you might think your sunk here but you can recover slightly more information, you can see if the output floats. Let's say you have a tristate output (5v in this case):  you pull it up you'll either see 5v for on/tristate or 0v for off.   You pull it down, you'll see 5v for on, 0v for tristate/off.   You attach it to a potential divider (in the example made from two equal resistors) you get 5v for on, 2.5v for tristate or 0v for off. Or, thinking of it another way, I in the drain resistor for on, I in the source resistor for off and I/2 for tristate.   Extracting this information could be done by putting a led in the source and the drain sides, A on = ""off"", B on = ""on"" and A&B on = tristate. If these LEDs are in optoisolators then you now have three states you can do whatever you like with!  Of course, this is all crap as far as the OP is concerned, he should just chain some 74595 logic chips running from the I2c port to generate his signals, either using them to drive one transistor per LED, or to provide the two signals required to recreate tristate drivers externally from two FETs.   http://www.protostack.com/blog/2010/05/introduction-to-74hc595-shift-register-controlling-16-leds/"

And those two outputs are connected to form your tri-state output. Now there are 4 configurations you can switch those switches into: High closed, Low closed, both open (Hi-Z), both closed (short).  By making sure that the short state is never used you end up with three states. This also shows that you need two inputs to drive one 3-state output."

For example, I made a single pushbutton controlled two light switch with a dual D flip flop chip (state storing), quad schmitt trigger nand (switch debouncing, some power-on reset logic, doubled up inputs for inverters).  Q' just went back to data, and either Q or Q' became the clock for the second flipflop.  The most challenging part was making the power-on reset work under various conditions: power input slowly rising, quickly rising, partial power-off (voltage never totally disappearing), all these conditions with the debounce capacitor in different state of charge, etc.  I ended up using the power LED as part of the power-on reset circuit (as a voltage reference of sorts)...  I wish I would have made a schematic of all the weirdness.  Anyway the constraint I worked with is that accidental output activation isn't allowed.  It is okay if it loses state and turns both outputs off, but not turning something on that was off, through power glitches.  Anyway, the long and short of it, is you can use an RC filter into a schmitt trigger logic chip and it does a pretty decent job of debouncing.  It might not catch some really weird corner cases of very momentary partial contact (the enforced delay between presses might become rather short, but it's still there), but it did perfectly fine with the real switch I had connected to it.  In retrospect, even something this simple is a job for a damn microcontroller.  I just really wanted to do a project playing with some raw logic chips."
AskElectronics,38zq5i,bradn,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:10:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response,   I actually think my NOT debouncing switches/ using decoupling capacitors was causing me several issues that needed to be addressed, and now I have I have a better idea of my problem.  The problem I am having is it seems if I tie the J and K inputs to High with resistors and use the push button tied to the CLOCK input on the IC, it works. As in, it toggles everytime without issue (after debouncing the switch). What I cannot do and what i am looking for the answer to is why when I have either J & K tied to a press-button that is enabled (for HIGH state) or just tied to HIGH via resistors, if the CLOCK input is to my astable multivibrator which is alternating pulses say @ 1Hz, INSTEAD of changing state each clock transition, it just remains lit.. I does seem to flicker for a microsecond visually, on the rising edge of the clock transition, but doesn't change state and remain that way. It's on, flickers for microsecond, and remains on.  If i modify this configuration and leave the CLOCK tied to the multi, and the J and K inputs to their own switches, then I can set / reset the bit IF I time it with the rising edge of the clock; so I know that works I just cant understand why it wont toggle based on the clock input going low->high->low->high automatically. It seems the only way it works is if the clock is a push button.. Ideas?"
AskElectronics,38zq5i,bradn,2,Thu Jun 11 00:02:16 2015 UTC,"Edit:  Oops, my understanding of JK flipflops was incorrect - both high should configure it to toggle.  Although here is another option you could consider trying:  I would suggest using a D flip-flop with Q` routed back to D.  Then every clock will make it toggle, if that's what you're going for.  The fancier flip-flop chips have clear/preset inputs that let you implement a reset switch that sets everything to a certain state (these may or may not be synchronized with clock - check datasheets)."
AskElectronics,38zq5i,bradn,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:04:08 2015 UTC,Ill give that a go.  Any idea on why I cant get the toggle to work with the clock pulse generator (astable multivibrator)? It's really bugging me that I cant figure it out and I feel it's going to give me problems down the road when I implement larger bits for memory.
AskElectronics,38zq5i,bradn,2,Thu Jun 11 00:12:32 2015 UTC,"Does the resulting clock signal have both a sharp positive and negative going edge?  CMOS inputs often have a no-man's-land voltage area in the middle that must be traversed quickly or strange stuff happens.  When I did my switch debouncing experiments, I tried it first just with the RC straight into the flipflop, but as the voltage changed slowly in one direction (RC charge time), the chip totally flipped out in the middle voltage area.  Running it through a schmitt trigger style chip fixed it (they have low/high thresholds that change based on the current input ""state"", preventing self-oscillation).  So once it goes from low to high, it has to go a ways lower than that point to be considered low, and vice versa.  Also, make sure you have a small decoupling capacitor on the IC's power rails, near the IC.  Sometimes without that, it can't maintain a good power supply to itself and weird stuff happens."
AskElectronics,38zq5i,bradn,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:26:37 2015 UTC,"I didn't know about deCaps initially :p but I am using them now and still have the problem.  I am not sure about the sharp + and - edge of the clock as im still pretty new to this but I made the clock based on the following schematic:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivibrator#/media/File:Transistor_Multivibrator.svg  with a 100uF cap and 10k resistors feeding into the caps. This gives me about a 2Hz clock to see whats going on but subbing the 100uF with 10uF or even 1uF gives me a freq. increase (1uF cant even tell LEDs are blinking) but makes no change to the toggle not occurring.  What makes me think that it's NOT the clock is that if I have the J and K inputs HELD down HIGH by physically holding down two push switches tied to them, and the CLOCK input tied to a 3rd switch, hitting the clock input MAKES NO CHANGE.  So now that im thinking about it, maybe they are related and the clock button is not fast enough like the multivibrator and thus I get the same result?  Based on this IC, what frequency do I need for the clock and would I need to make one from a 555 timer if the above is the case, or just as something to try?  Thanks again!"
AskElectronics,38zq5i,spap-oop,2,Thu Jun 11 01:29:37 2015 UTC,"It's not the frequency of the clock (at least not how you normally think of frequency), it's how fast it goes from a low voltage to a high voltage and vice versa.  If you use a 555, you want to pick the output from the chip that drives high and low, and not pick the capacitor node that slowly changes voltage.  Another consideration is that high voltage must be high enough or it won't register, and low voltage must be low enough.  Running it through a schmitt trigger based chip will probably fix that problem as well, if the thresholds are far enough toward the center.  Also using a CMOS 555 IC would get you outputs that approach VCC and ground pretty closely.  Sometimes there are problems connecting between TTL and CMOS where especially the high output voltage from TTL isn't high enough for the CMOS input.  Sometimes running the CMOS from 3.3V and TTL from 5V can fix this (but I don't think this specifically is your problem here)"
AskElectronics,38zq5i,Apollo_O,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:52:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah im beginning to think it's my understanding of the clock that is the problem..  I'm going to implement a 555 based on your advice and see where that gets me. At the moment the clock is capacitor based and the rate from low->high must be agonisingly slow.  Im fairly new to the 555 and will new to probably follow this to get one going right: http://www.instructables.com/id/555-Timer/step1/555-Timer-Pin-Diagram/  It offers 2 modes, mono and astable. Which would I want for my particular setup?"
AskElectronics,38zq5i,kenshirriff,2,Thu Jun 11 02:11:35 2015 UTC,"You want astable.  The short intro to how it works, is the 555 has an output that drives low or high (you want to take this as your clock output), and then there is an input pin that flips the output when it crosses past VCC*(1/3) or VCC*(2/3).  This pin gets connected to a capacitor pin (other end of cap to ground), and you use a resistor from the 555 output to the top end of the cap which pulls the capacitor towards VCC or towards ground depending on the output state.   So the capacitor voltage moves by (1/3) of VCC each half cycle (this would likely not be appropriate for a CMOS input in any way, but that's why you use the chip output instead), but that particular voltage swing makes the RC time calculations really nice to work with.  Basically multiply R and C (in ohms and farads) and that's approximately how many seconds it takes for each half cycle.  Keep R in the 1K<->100K range for best results, so that it doesn't try to pull too much or too little current (too much is an obvious problem but with too little, leakages can throw off operation).  Check this page and scroll down to ""50% Duty Cycle Astable"" - this is the circuit I'm talking about - many of the examples use 2 resistors in a different configuration, but for 50% duty cycle like a normal clock has there's no need.  The capacitor on the control pin might not be necessary depending on the particular 555 but it's probably best to include it (it doesn't really factor into the timing calculations though). Hopefully this helps!  [Edit:]  Actually at 5V operation, you will save a ton of grief by using a CMOS 555 instead of a normal one, because the output high voltage may not reach high enough!  The one time I implemented this circuit, it was with a CMOS part because it needed to draw very little power during operation (it was part of a weird low current power supply for helping to drive MOSFETs)."
AskElectronics,391ipo,OctoPussyBomb,8,Mon Jun 8 15:56:31 2015 UTC,"First, it's important to note that the L298 is not a stepper motor, it is a stepper motor driver: it creates the signals that drive the stepper motor.  For the rest, you should look at the datasheet for the L298 to understand what the function of the pins is. Then consider what the function of the stepper motor driver is: applying signals to the inputs causes the driver to switch the polarities of the outputs such that the motor rotates between phases. Given the phase you are at now, and the direction it is told to rotate it will move to one of two adjacent phases, but only if it is not inhibited or in reset. There are other special things that happen when enable is low or when reset is low. Check the datasheet for a description.  Hopefully that points you in the right direction. There are plenty of tutorials online that talk about the operation of the L298.  Also, consider that your teacher might not be lazy: he might be forcing you to learn on your own. If an engineer wants to know what a part does, he doesn't expect a teacher to tell him, he reads the datasheet.

AskElectronics,390pp6,odokemono,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:50:03 2015 UTC,"Well, your datasheet doesn't mention what forward voltage (Vfwd) the LEDs have, nor their current limit, neither have you stipulated with what voltage you're going to power them.  Assuming they're all identical red LEDs with a Vfwd of about 2 volts and a 6 volt power supply and a target current of 10ma per segment, that would set the desired resistor value at: (6v-2v)/10ma = 400 ohms per segment, so 400 ohms / 3 = 133 ohms for each of the A-F segments, 200 ohms for the G segments and 400 ohms for the DP segment.  In the very popular E12 series of values: 150, 220, and 470 should give you uniform brightness.   These number were anally extracted so YMMV.  Let me reiterate: I'm not responsible if you destroy the display catastrophically or set fire to your house.  It's also possible that instead of blowing up open as desired that the segments may fail leaving you with a dim yellowish LED, a parasitic resistance, or take out neighbouring LEDs.

AskElectronics,390pp6,FuturePassed,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:22:04 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I love your project. On the subject of batteries, how long do you want these LEDs to be lit? A rechargeable 5V power bank that people use for phones may be a better solution than six AAs.  This type of LED display is meant to be run by a microcontroller or LED driver which switches the pins rapidly. Initially, all the segment pins (11, 7, etc) are low, and all the digit pins (8, 9, 12) are high. Then, a single digit pin is brought low, and the appropriate segment pins for that digit are brought high. After a very brief pause, the segment and driver pins are all brought to their configuration for the next digit. By flashing these quickly enough, all the LEDs can be controlled with significantly fewer pins.  I don't have a great solution for controlling it small and simple. Would you consider switching to 3 seperate digits like this? This would allow you to hard-wire everything, so there's no need for controllers.  Using the single digits I described, and assuming this will get light use, no LEDs should burn out so it should be okay to use a single resistor on each common pin. The resistor calculations change based on your battery solution, but for 25 mA running through each digit, your resistor needs to be R = (V - 2) / 0.025, where V is your battery voltage. Each resistor needs to be able to dissipate N*[(V - 2)2] / R watts, where N is the number of segments lit (7, 8, and 6 respectively)  Quick Edit: If the LEDs don't look good to you within each digit, you'd want to instead attach individual resistors to each leg."

You mention only needing one resistor per common pin - I'm confused - if it's three seperate displays then there are no common pins, right?  Battery-wise, I'd also thought of using a power bank but the power bank I have will shut-off if the load is not above a certain level. So if that doesn't work I guess I can use 4x NimH AA batteries.

So this is just a freak coincidence involving the circuitry of the laptop and my proximity to a certain radio tower? And chances are it's probably close to impossible for a repair technician to reproduce the issue when I sent the laptop in for repair.  I don't really like the idea of wrapping every audio cable I use with this around a ferrite core. =P
AskElectronics,38ymix,1991_VG,3,Mon Jun 8 01:31:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's just a freak occurrence, although this sort of thing does happen a lot near high power transmitters. The technician like wouldn't have a clue without a nearby transmitter.  There's several other solutions. You can move, or turn the area you use the laptop into a faraday cage. Ferrites are the easiest solution."
AskElectronics,38ymix,1991_VG,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:02:31 2015 UTC,"I tried a ferrite core (extra one from an hdmi cable) around the headphone cable near the plug and it removes the interference.  Would it work to get a short 3.5mm female to male adapter and wrap that around a ferrite core, then just use that between whatever headphones I'm using and the laptop when I'm using it at home (or sitting under that radio tower, or something)?  Also, (just out of curiosity) in the case that I do move, I just have to try not to live near a tower broadcasting close to FM 95.7, right? Or is it something like anything within 5 MHz of that? Or do I need to try and stay away from all radio towers?"
AskElectronics,38ymix,1991_VG,6,Mon Jun 8 02:12:18 2015 UTC,"I'd try to avoid all high power towers -- so it's not so much frequency as the fact that you're nearby (I'd be curious as to how nearby you are) a transmitter operating at 15,000 watts ERP. Chances are the laptop is just susceptible to anything.  Yes, using a short adapter wrapped around the core would very likely work.   I also had one other idea that you can check -- it's a long shot -- but look into your mixer settings and make sure the mic and line in are set to zero (some audio devices will feed these back into the mixer at the analog level, and so, if they're turned up, it'll amplify anything on them.)"

I'll likely live in/near big cities for the foreseeable future, so I'll probably be nearby high power radio towers. \=  Distance: I'm about 1.5 miles from the radio tower in question. Tomorrow I'll try driving closer to the tower to see if the response changes.  Microphone: I turned the volume to zero and even disabled the microphone device completely in Windows (and same in Linux where I was originally troubleshooting this).  Oh and I found a (rather long) 3.5mm extender laying around. Wrapped it around a ferrite ring a few times and it eliminates the interference."

It's actually pretty unusual to have high ERP transmitter towers everywhere, so decent odds when you move you won't be as close to one. I'm surprised you're getting interference at 1.5 miles, that's actually pretty far away to have problems."
AskElectronics,38ymix,bradn,2,Mon Jun 8 03:23:51 2015 UTC,"I'm probably done troubleshooting this; it looks like there's no way to resolve this problem through repairs so I either have to return the laptop and buy something different or live with the issue while I live here, but:  If you're interested, today I drove up to the tower broadcasting 95.7 and parked within about 200 feet of it and the interference was pretty clear. There are actually half a dozen radio towers nearby that one, so I tried getting as close as I could to a few and each time I parked next to one, I was able to match the interference I could hear with the tower (and I could confirm I was at the respective towers using radio-locator.com). I did this for at least FM stations 93.3, 94.5, 96.5, and 95.7.  Pretty interesting stuff. Never realized I was so close to such a large cluster of radio broadcast towers."

AskElectronics,38ymix,MaskedEngineer,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:19:59 2015 UTC,"Your wire is picking up the RF signal and feeding it into the laptop circuitry (probably negative feedback going on there). Slope detection + IMD or something else in the output amp is unintentionally causing it to get demodulated back down into baseband frequency.  I don't think you necessarily need to have a station nearby, really depends on how bad the problem is—how much signal power needs to be picked up for the output amp to demod and output it. It really just is poor analog design on the audio frontend on the laptop though (and this is why you want to buy good motherboards, among other reasons)."

I noticed a few other towers in the area, too, and found I was able to pick up FM stations 93.3, 94.5, 96.5, and 95.7 depending on which tower I was parked closest to. Definitely quite interesting."

I'm sort of confused as to the source of the interference.   AM radio transmitter -> headset cable as antenna -> Jack on laptop -> semiconductor connected to jack, together with capacitance across jack, form a rectifier diode, demodulates the AM into audio ->headphone cable -> headphone speakers  It's a poor design of the laptop. Repair cannot fix poor design.    Fix it externally: add a ferrite to the headphone cable, as someone suggested Fix it internally: requires surgery inside the laptop, to overcome its poor design (I doubt you have the stomach for it) Filter in line between the headset and the laptop (but my quick search didn't find one) Exchange the laptop for a better designed one    great laptop   Maybe not so great.

AskElectronics,38y1lz,aford89,3,Sun Jun 7 20:33:46 2015 UTC,"The DIY calls for 22 LEDS ran in parallel.   That's really not a good way to do it. With LEDs you want to put as many as you can in series. That makes wiring easier and improves the efficiency.  So naively one would put 6 of these LEDs in series and not use a resistor, because 6 in series need 12V, right? The problem with that is that LEDs always need resistor in series to limit the current, and that your supply voltage isn't actually 12.0V. Depending on whether the engine is running or not, it's going to be somewhere between 12.5V and 14.4V or thereabouts, and minor variations in voltage produce huge variations in current (and brightness).  So if you put 6 LEDs in series without a resistor and run them at 14.4V (with the alternator charging), the current would be too high.  Your best bet would be to put 5 in series and then use a resistor. Build four of those circuits and you've got 20 LEDs. And then you make another circuit with two LEDs in series and a higher value resistor.  I would suggest using this website with the following parameters:  Source voltage: 14.4V  Diode forward voltage 2V  Diode forward current: 20 mA  Number of LEDs: 5 or 2  Output: Wiring diagram  Note that the website can also design your entire 22 LED array, but in this case it does a bad job because it doesn't take into account that your supply voltage fluctuates quite a bit. It would tell you to put 6 or 7 LEDs in series with a lower value resistor, but that's not a good idea because the brightness would change a lot depending on the battery voltage. It's possible that the LEDs would only be running at 30% brightness at idle and 100% when the engine revs up. Using a smaller number of LEDs in series and a higher value resistor is better in this regard.  Long story short, four 220 Ohm and one 560 Ohm resistor is what you need. 4 x 5 LEDs and 1 x 2 LEDs."
AskElectronics,38y1lz,bal00,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:55:21 2015 UTC,I believe i have them wired up in parallel maybe i am incorrect on that as well. I currently have a whole setup wired up  1 wire of positive and 1 wire of negative and have the LEDs just attatched at 1inch increments.....
AskElectronics,38y1lz,bal00,3,Sun Jun 7 22:54:12 2015 UTC,"That's not really gonna work, I'm afraid. If they're in parallel, each LED would need its own resistor.  If you've got all the LEDs in parallel and only one common resistor, most of the current would go through the LED with the lowest forward voltage. LEDs are never perfectly identical. So that one would be very bright and the other ones would be dim. And when that LED fails, the same thing happens with the next lowest voltage LED. May not be quite as dramatic if the LEDs are evenly matched, but it's still not a good idea."
AskElectronics,38y1lz,bradn,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:19:11 2015 UTC,"Yep, this is the right advice.  Sometimes you find products that do put LEDs straight in parallel but these are the products that end up working crappy."

AskElectronics,38y1lz,bal00,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:35:37 2015 UTC,"If you have them all running in parallel right now, it would probably be least work to give each of them their own resistor (clip a lead on each one and solder a resistor in).  This results in the least rewiring work.  But, better efficiency is attained by putting them in series groups and then less power is lost in the resistors compared to usefully used in the LEDs.  A 2V LED with resistor to take it up to ~12-14V is under 20% efficient, but for low power LEDs probably isn't a huge problem.  600 ohm resistors should work to give them 20mA at 14V, but each resistor will burn about 1/4 of a watt.  So you should probably use 1/3W or higher rated resistors (maybe this isn't very important if you are soldering them straight onto a heavier wire with a short lead on the resistor side - the wire will heatsink it)."
AskElectronics,38y1lz,bal00,1 point,Mon Jun 8 00:38:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know what the current circuit looks like, but I'm afraid there's not much you can keep.  The only option would be to remove the connections to positive and then put a 680 Ohm resistor between each LED and the positive wire. They would have to be 1/2 Watt resistors though. That way they would still be in parallel, but the current would be balanced. Not very efficient though, and the resistors would get reasonably hot.  Redoing it with 5/5/5/5/2 LEDs in series would be a better choice though."

AskElectronics,38wk4r,jubjub7,7,Sun Jun 7 13:02:57 2015 UTC,"Similar materials in sliding contact have molecular transfer issues. That is why slip rings use carbon brushes or a material that will not bond with the base layer. This will transfer and fuck up very fast. A spec of dirt inside will also cause lift. You have no wear compensation between the layers either. Once one ring slings some shit around in there (including transferred materials) it will be at a different height. And you loose contact.  Start putting low dc current through that thing. Ring 1 (+) is going to transfer material from plate a to plate b.  Ring 2 (-) is going to transfer matetial from plate b to plate a. See the problem here?  Slip rings need good tough wearing surfaces. My guess would be aluminum bronze for a base layer matetial. Thick enough to wear with the carbon brush drag. Uou would want at least 0.080"" of material.  Want to build something better? Send power through some coils and data through a wireless link. Make something with no wearing items and it will last forever."

AskElectronics,38wk4r,Njubivoje,3,Sun Jun 7 19:46:11 2015 UTC,"At a previous company, I have had success designing slip ring PCBs using pogo pins. You have to understand that they aren't going to last forever, but by specifying the design for longevity they may last long enough. This can include specifying ENIG, >1oz. Cu final weight, etc.   From experience I can tell you that signal lines on a slip ring aren't 100% reliable. They suffer from discontinuities and can add noise to analog signals. One way to get around this is by using differential signaling. They are fine for power, however."
AskElectronics,38wk4r,odhinn178,2,Sun Jun 7 17:39:41 2015 UTC,Are PCB slip rings reliable?   At some point in their lifetime they will fail. It depends how long they have to last. If you buy them from a decent manufacturer they will give you a quote for the lifetime (e.g. these are quoted for 30-80 million revolutions).   Or would I need some sort of spring-loaded pin?   I don't see how you would get a reliable connection without some (it's common to use more than one per track/connection).
AskElectronics,38wk4r,stuner,2,Sun Jun 7 13:41:49 2015 UTC,PCBs squishing against each other? Or would I need some sort of spring-loaded pin?   Definitely the spring loaded pin. If there is a slight bend in one PCB you have to put a lot of force on it to get good contact which leads to a lot of wear.  For examples of this look at the design of mulitmeter slip rings. You propably have to use a gold finish or something like this to have a very hard surface that won't corrode with time.
AskElectronics,38wk4r,cloidnerux,2,Sun Jun 7 15:32:41 2015 UTC,"Slip rings are designed to be in contact against a springed contact in motion.  If the intent is to have a static (non-moving) connection, you might be able to load them enough to squish the metal together and have it reliable enough to last.  But I'm not sure I'd take my chances.  PCB's are not perfectly flat, usually.  Also, any solder mask on the boards would ride higher than the copper."

AskElectronics,38wmzc,2ndTimeLucky,4,Sun Jun 7 13:34:59 2015 UTC,Projectors use a lot of power to be run from battery.  The first step to take is calculate how much power the entire system will consume.
AskElectronics,38wmzc,DilatedSphincter,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:33:45 2015 UTC,"The projector I linked uses LEDs instead of a conventional filament bulb and says it has a power consumption of 24W and can be charged by a 2A power bank. If I needed to run that for, say, 14 hours, how much energy storage would I need? not really sure how to work it out. Would I be able to charge the battery and simultaneously use it to power the projector?"
AskElectronics,38wmzc,coder543,5,Sun Jun 7 18:14:59 2015 UTC,"So, from those numbers, it runs at 12 volts with 2A.  14 hours * 24 Watts means you would need 336 Watt-Hours of energy, plus a little extra to account for reality.  A lead acid battery would probably be a great choice for this. Especially if you got a deep cycle lead acid battery. Look for a 12 volt lead acid battery that has a capacity of at least 30 amp hours at a 20 hour discharge rate. You should be able to find one locally."
AskElectronics,38wmzc,grem75,3,Sun Jun 7 18:38:54 2015 UTC,"Does the projector already run on 12V? If it doesn't you need to worry about the losses in whatever step-up/step-down converter you will need. What is the total draw of everything? How are you feeding the video to the projector? What kind of audio system is there?  A decent Group 27 size battery has about 100Ah if you are discharging at a slow rate, which is 1200W/hr. If you intend to keep the battery after the 3 day festival you don't want to ever have it discharge below 50%, so you have 600W/hr to work with.  You could get away with all solar if you want, a 50W solar charging kit is pretty easy to come by. If you want to incorporate human power you'll figure on about 20W sustained for the average person."
AskElectronics,38wmzc,DilatedSphincter,3,Sun Jun 7 18:47:38 2015 UTC,"ohh i missed the projector link on mobile.  /u/coder543 did the math and a deep cycle lead acid battery would cover you for the weekend for sure.  dunno if you have walmart or similar in Ireland but in north america there are 100ah deep cycle/marine batteries for about $100 that are exactly what you'd need.  Note about that projector though, 30 lumens is miserable brightness.  it'll be dim even in a fully blacked out room.  standard DLP projectors tend to be around 2000-2700 lumens.  Also native resolution of 480x320 is gonna look sad.  I have an LED projector rated for 100 lumens with 858x600 native res and it's barely adequate.  any room brightness makes it hard to see.  You may want to just use a flat panel TV.  They tend to be about 200 watts which is still manageable with a deep cycle."
AskElectronics,38wmzc,DilatedSphincter,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:56:55 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks for the heads-up on the projector - during the day it wouldn't really be a problem because we could black out the inside of the caravan, but at night it could be in an environment with a lot of ambient light...   At the same time, we would like to use a projector if possible so that there would be scope for projecting onto a bigger screen at night, eg. a screen that was a similar size to the side of the caravan (say 12x8 feet).  Perhaps something like this would be more appropriate? Although I don't know how much power that one needs... Or how much a set of computer speakers with a subwoofer needs."
AskElectronics,38wmzc,DilatedSphincter,3,Sun Jun 7 19:48:37 2015 UTC,the reviews imply it is bright enough but I dont trust the cheap stuff.  Brand name LED projectors go for around $400-600 US for comparison.  If you want 12x8 foot projection you're going to need a really bright lamp.  brighter than anything but top of the line LED projectors can do.  standard bulb projectors start around $400US and use about 300 watts.  standard 2.1 speakers typically use no more than 50 watts.  I use one that's rated for 50 watts and true consumption is much lower.
AskElectronics,38wppj,Mitcheypoo,7,Sun Jun 7 14:03:14 2015 UTC,"It will work as is, but there are constructive details worth looking into.  Use a ""bus bar"" to make wiring easier.  Use a power supply that is at least 1.25 larger than needed (this means 270W in your case). Make sure your wires' AWG is rated for at least 125% for the current you will use.

AskElectronics,38wppj,MATlad,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:38:26 2015 UTC,"I'll just add that P = IE, so 24 = 12I, I = 2 so your current is 2 amps.

That's the usual size of you see in AC power cords so it's easy to find.    Also, when you build it, don't wire them all up at once and turn them on.  Wire up one LED strip, test it, then another.  Back off if your power supply starts showing signs of distress like tripping breakers, sizzling noises, burning smells, sassy backtalk etc."
AskElectronics,38wppj,dockerhate,-2,Sun Jun 7 18:08:10 2015 UTC,"Some issues: 1. You should have a current limiting resistor for each LED string to ensure 12 V never supplies over to 2A 2. You should have a better power supply. You are cutting real close when you need 2W and can only deliver 24 W. When you first turn on the supply, there may be higher power requirements by the load until steady state occurs. I recommend using at least 35 W supply or an additional 1 A per channel.  3. Add decoupling capacitors for each DC channel. Parallel capacitors will smooth the DC voltage for your LEDs. This especially important since you are rectifying AC to DC.  4. If you care about extremely uniform light out of each LED strand, look into LED drivers that can provide constant current on each channel.   Hope this helps."

AskElectronics,38wppj,zephyrus299,-1,Sun Jun 7 14:18:19 2015 UTC,"Agreed with /u/TitMouse182 - each LED string should be regulated, either with a series resistor for each LED string or with discrete current regulated output from the PSU.  If the LED strings themselves have the required series resistor, then you're fine.  OTOH, if the LEDs are just straight-up serial LED's and nothing else, you can have a thermal runaway  where one string starts pulling more current as it gets hotter than the others, get hotter, than pulls even more current, then hotter still, and then... poof."

There's a US listing for the same product on Amazon.com where a reviewer confirm more details.    Note that I did qualify my above post with:   If the LED strings themselves have the required series resistor, then you're fine.   It turns out that these LED's have a series resistor for each string of 3 LED's.  Now, one might think ""Duh, they all have series resistors"".  But that's not true.  Using a series resistor to regulate the LED is a waste of energy.  For high-power applications where you care about light uniformity, maximum light output, and minimum heat, they are lousy.  Most high-power LED modules (the kind that are on metal-core PCB's) are straight-up LED's without resistors."

So your first setup had 15 meters, which equals 15* 4,8W=72W. The power supply you bought had 12V*5A=60W, so you were actually overloading it by 20%.  By hooking up 75m to this power supply you tried to get 360W out of a 60W power supply, I'm not surprised that it melted. A more expensive power supply would have turned itself off before it started melting, consider this while buying your next supply.    In case you now want to buy a 360W power supply, I would not recommend you doing that since the resulting current (360W/12V=30A) would certainly melt away your cables and the cables on the LED strip."

A CC PSU only works on series strings of LEDs if you put two strings in parallel off of a single PSU then one will end up taking more current than the other and burning out, then you have the same current going into (N-1) strings, rinse and repeat accelerating as you go.  White LEDs have a forward drop of about 3V so you can't run more than about 3-4 of them in series from 12V. Which is why the strips are made up of a bunch of segments in parallel, each segment containing 3-4 LEDs and a current limiting resistor.  Rewiring the strips to insert a CC PS into each segment would be possible, and would work, but it would be an incredible amount of effort and as each segment is about 5cm long, for 75m of strips, he would need 1,500 power supplies."

Once the conduction band was filled, the higher, normally empty energy bands also started filling up (increasing the fermi level of your semiconductor).  Those higher energy bands would have allowed optical transitions which are in the visible spectrum, resulting in the colour black.  When the diode failed, those high energy bands depleted and the colour returned to what it was, but the internal structure of the diode has fundamentally changed, i.e. the interfacial structure has been changed, the crystal structure has changed, chemical reactions may have occured, etc. resulting in a non-operational semiconductor.

AskElectronics,38vj3l,charitable_view,1 point,Sun Jun 7 10:35:59 2015 UTC,"This may not be the best solution.  You can find a lot of them on ebay.  Also look for buck-boost converters that have low input voltage requirement, as some buck-boosts wont even turn on if input voltage is e.g. under 4.5 volt. That can be little tricky to find.  I recommend using a model that has constant current, because if your supercap was empty at start of your ride it would seem to the buck-boost converter like a short circuit (basically you have 0 volt drop on empty cap, and resistance is only internal resistance of cap wich is in range from 0.02-0.7 ohm).  This limitations make it unpractical, unless you want to build your own. Companies like Texas Instruments have chips that can meet your requirements, but there are no ready made boards. You would need to make pcb and add few components.  My recommendation would be simple circuit that would charge the cap if the voltage of the bike motor is higher than cap voltage (and the cap was not full), and ignoring the times when it's under voltage.  By this approach you could use all the power if you start with emty cap, and everything above 2.7 on the full cap. With buck boost you can only use power over 4.5 volts which actually defeats purpose in this case.  If you are interested PM me an i will try to draft schematics."
AskElectronics,38vj3l,dantex47,1 point,Sun Jun 7 10:56:47 2015 UTC,"Well, doing it in two steps like that seems silly; you have two sets of losses.  How about putting two 5F supercaps in series (same energy storage capacity: V2F) and charging that to 5V?  Also, the AtMega328 processor inside an Arduino will run, at reduced clock speeds, on supply voltages down to 1.8V; you only need 5V if you want the full 20 MHz.  Why step up the 2.7V at all?  All that said, yes, there are circuits that will do what you wan.  The simplest one is the inverting buck/boost converter.  Which takes a positive input in and produces a negative voltage out, or vice-versa.  Since your circuit is isolated, ""ground"" is arbitrary and you can use either to power it.  This TI app note Using a buck converter in an inverting buck-boost topology is a good intro.  There's one basic non-isolated switch-mode converter core, which consists of an SPDT switch (which is normally implemented as a transistor and diode, or two transistors in synchronous rectification variants) with an inductor connected to the switch's common terminal.  The three terminals of this are connected to input, output, and ground.  The three variants are distinguished by where the inductor is connected:   Inductor to output: Buck converter (0 < Vout/Vin < 1) Inductor to input: Boost converter (Vout / Vin > 1) Inductor to ground: Inverting buck-boost converter. (Vout/Vin < 0)   The hard case, when you need things like SEPIC, is when Vout/Vin can be on either side of 1."
AskElectronics,38uxxr,Bag06a,7,Sun Jun 7 01:18:51 2015 UTC,"RC batteries crucially also have a C rating. The C is how much current you can safely pull - it's a ""proportional constant"" that determines how much current you get from a given mAh rating, and it differe from battery to battery.  For your 1500 mAh battery, if it has a C rating of 10, then you can safely pull (1500 * 10) / 1000 Amps - thats (mAh * C)/1000. So 15 Amps. And you could do that for (theoretically) 6 minutes - 1500 mAh / 15000 mA = 0.1 h  Your 3000mAh battery with the same C rating could safely pull 30 Amps for 6 minutes, or 15 Amps for twelve minutes.  Two things to note:   1) Current is pulled. ""Output current"" is what a battery can sustain, but the actual current is determined by the motors doing the pulling. The same motors on the above batteries will pull the same current regardless of battery. The ""safe"" output current will rise, but if a motor pulls an amp, it pulls an amp, regardless of the battery - a bigger battery won't ""push"" 2 amps.  2) ""Theoretically"". Output time actually drops non-linearly as current draw (and really, temperature) increases. The above math is generally reliable below your max C rating, but at the max C, you probably lose time."

If you look at a spec sheet from a reputable cell manufacturer, you will not find a C-rating.   The C is how much current you can safely pull   That's what the RC toy marketing wants you to believe.   In reality, there is no ""safe"" current. Any level of current will result in some degradation in the cells. There is no ""transition"", below which it's safe to draw current, above which it isn't. The degradation vs current is a continuum, it's not linear, and it depends heavily on the SoC, temperature and internal resistance (which in turn depends on age).   Unfortunately, C-rating is simply an overly simplistic marketing tool used to appease the unsophisticated user."

AskElectronics,38u51f,panhandelslim,3,Sat Jun 6 21:08:42 2015 UTC,"Hi, first of all, you are missing the pretty important lower half of the circuit in question. This makes me wonder if your measurements are correct.. With respect to what did you measure those ""blue"" voltages?   The circuit is a bit convoluted. The key is U501, the TL431. It is a shut regulator, which means that it will draw some current, depending on its voltage. It is very often used as a reference and feedback controller in a ciruit, and this is also the case here. When the TL431 is employed in feedback, it will try to make the voltage at its reference(marked R in the schematic) equal to its internal reference of about 2.5V. It will do this by trying to draw as much current as it needs to, in order to bring the voltage at R down to 2.5V. So, what happens? The VR501 should produce about 2.5V for the TL431 to be happy. Lets do the math: In normal operation, the system outputs 140V, which is across R514,VR51 and R513. This the ref input from VR501 to swing between ~2 and 2.8V, depending on the position of VR501. Now, if the voltage R from VR501 is too high, the TL431 will start sinking current. This current will come through R516, which will have an increased voltage-drop and thus a lower voltage will be present at the emitter of Q504. Increasing the emitter voltage at Q504 will eventaully turn off the resistor, because there is not enough voltage across the emitter-base junction. But that doesn't happen, because when the emitter voltage is decreased, so is the voltage at the base of Q503. When this lower voltage appears, Q503 will conduct less current and appear as a variable resistor which gets larger, since it conduct letss current. Since Q503 is in parallel with R512, those two together will actually regulate the output voltage to 140V, because of the actions of the TL431. So, the TL431 functions in a negative feedback loop. When the voltage from VR501(and thus the 140V) becomes too high, the TL431 will try to bring it down by increasing the resistance of Q503. And obviously, it will try to decrease the resistance if the voltage at VR501 becomes to high.  Now, what about the upper part of the circuit. Well, the voltage divider formed by R507 and R508 produces a voltage of about ~141.8V at the base of Q502. The configuration of Q502 and Q501 is very similar to the Q504/Q503 circuit, so they probably do the same thing. But they use the already-regulated voltage of 140V, instead of using another TL431. Now, D502 will have a voltage drop of about 0.6-0.7V, so the voltage at the emitter of Q502 is 140+0.7=140.7V. With the additional voltage drop from emitter to base of Q502, the voltage will be 141.4, whic is pretty close to the 141.8V of the R507/R508 voltage divider. Now, if the R507/R508 voltage divider for some reason produces a bigger voltage, more current will flow though Q502, which will in turn create a larger voltage drop across R506. This voltage drop will in turn push the voltage of the base of Q501 down, until it acts as a big enough resistance to provide the voltage drop necessary to deliver 260V at the output. In much the same way as Q503 more or less shorts out R512, Q501 more or less shortw out R509. So, the top part of the schematic piggybacks on the 140V regulated voltage to regulate its own voltage to 260V.   Im sure that explanation was a bit messy and disorganized, but hopefully it will give some insights on where to search, or at least some knowledge on power supplies(namely discrete linear regulators). Anyway, the 140V seems to be functioning corretly, but there is something wrong in all the other places. You do measure 130VAC across the rectifier, right? What do DC voltage you measure across C503? It should be about 169V. The fact that you measure 34.3V on the R50/R508 voltage divider, when you have only 38.4V across the entire voltage divider either suggests that the voltage divider is broken or that you do not measure the voltage at that point correctly."

An op amp without feedback is essentially a comparator.  Apply one pit to +V and the other to -V.  Switch it around.  The output should swing from +V to -V (though, not all the way, unless its a rail-to-rail op amp).  Verify the voltage swings with the datasheet.

AskElectronics,38udys,cynar,1 point,Sun Jun 7 00:01:15 2015 UTC,"Be careful when picking an ATX PSU for a test supply. Many require specific loadings on the 5V and 12V lines. Improper loadings can damage their regulation ability. I have seen some vary the 12V from 7V up to 19V due to internal damage. They were never taken out of their rated range.  A better option is to get a LED PSU they are a lot more tolerant of loading. If you want multiple voltages, you can source little switched mode buck converters that can go from 1V to 35 or so, depending on input voltage. Combine a couple of these with a 24V PSU and you have a VERY capable bench supply for the same cost as an ATX."

The fuse (if it only one) must be a primary input fuse, and these generally won't blow if you short a rail because they are rated for the full psu power plus surge current and then some. They are designed for a mains short, not a short on one of the rails.  My suggestion would be to see if you can find the auxiliary 5V rail to use, it will be a much lower power though around 15W. For future reference add fast fuses to the output of your ATX breakout, and use PSUs with SCP."
AskElectronics,38tnjm,Shadow6363,3,Sat Jun 6 18:46:39 2015 UTC,"Couple things: one, can you tune so the spikes are centered in one half of the window? Dead center can be deceptive due to mixing and seeing both sidebands. Assuming the spikes stay, that'd be a strong indicator you're looking at FSK instead of ASK.   Second, you probably need to sample at an even higher rate than you have. Eventually you'll see something that looks like a square wave coming out of the modulated signal."

AskElectronics,38tnjm,1991_VG,3,Sat Jun 6 21:27:35 2015 UTC,"OK, on the image you posted, you have the signal of interest tuned to the exact center of the FFT. On some systems there can be artifacts in the exact center, so the idea is to tune it so the frequency spikes are all on the left or right hand side of the display.   Making it really simple, tune it so the signals show up about 1/4 of the way in from the left. If you still have two spikes there, it's FSK.  I'd sample at the highest rate possible. Normally when I do things like this, I'm looking at the discriminator output from a receiver rather than the audio, so that might complicate it a little. It's almost certain this is simple digital ASK or FSK signalling, and likely at a data rate of 4800 bits per second or lower -- we just don't know the baseband scheme and encoding."
AskElectronics,38tnjm,1991_VG,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:57:56 2015 UTC,"Is this what you mean? If it's FM, should I then choose fm or wdfm when I run rtl_fm?  Thanks again!"
AskElectronics,38tnjm,1991_VG,3,Sat Jun 6 23:43:22 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's it.   OK, it's without a doubt FSK. By the looks of the spectrum, it has a 100 KHz deviation. Keep this in mind, if you want to send a signal, you'll need a 900 MHz band transmitter that is either very rapidly tunable or supports FSK output itself.  FSK isn't FM, so rtl_fm isn't going to help you. We don't know the baseband encoding, but I'll give a simple example: the higher frequency is a ""1"" and the lower frequency a ""0"". The decoder would just look at which frequency was stronger and output a signal accordingly.  What I'd normally do in the past is put a comparator on the discriminator output of a FM tuner, but I'm ancient. Today someone would probably just gnu radio the thing.  Given the tools at hand, you might want to try tuning the stronger peak (around 916.7) in USB mode, and then look at the audio output on that. If the data rate is modestly low, it will look like the tone is being on-off keyed (like really fast morse code) and you'll be able to suss out a bit pattern. If it's not low, you're really going to be forced to either build a gnu radio path or a hardware discriminator, and sample the output from that.   You could also crack the thing open and see if they're using a module. I could easily see using something like the 900 MHz version of a RFM12B to do something like this."

The PDF I linked in my first post said to use a Quadrature Demod to do the FSK demodulation. I don't know what I should set for the gain. Similarly, I've no idea what I'm doing with the Low Pass Filter. If I should use it, what should the decimation, cutoff freq, transition width, window, etc. be?

AskElectronics,38tnjm,WristViolin,3,Sun Jun 7 03:22:55 2015 UTC,"OK, I know zero about setting up the gnuradio stuff, so I'll be of marginal help there.   That said, you're on right right path. The second image, if you look at the scope view, that's exactly what you're looking for -- you can see it's a binary pattern with a slight amount of carrier in it. Eyeballing it, it looks around the 45-50ms mark there's 4 or 5 bit transitions, so the data rate looks to be 1/(.005/4) 800bps or 1/(.005/5), 1000bps. Definitely in that range. You can use that information to tune the LPF, but it looks pretty good as it is.  See if you can stick a block between the low pass and the scope sink that cleans up the output -- it'd be called a discriminator, comparator, or slicer -- we're just trying to get binary DC levels out. Once you have that, you'll have a time-domain binary signal that's carrying the doorbell data, and the next trick will be to figure out how the baseband is coded (is it simple NRZ or something fancy), framing, etc."

To get even a few seconds of 60mA at 2V (making assumptions about LED here) you're going to need tens or hundreds of millifarads. That's a big honkin' capacitor.
AskElectronics,38vox5,Walmart_Internet,1 point,Sun Jun 7 06:15:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks, that looks pretty useful. I looked around on the ti website and found this which has a lower minimum input voltage.   The capacitor will be something like this (the 0.1F version). I figured that should be enough, but just did the math to check: total energy is 1.25J, power usage (with 70% efficient regulator) is about 0.17W, of course we can't keep running until the capacitor is at 0V but it should be fine for about 4 seconds, that's actually less than I expected but should still be enough. I might run the LEDs at slightly lower brightness to get some more time."
AskElectronics,38vox5,general_nuisance,1 point,Sun Jun 7 07:01:04 2015 UTC,From my experience you can't much tell the difference in LED brightness from 15mA to 20mA.  Even with 10mA some LED's are plenty bright for indicator lights.  Also the LED viewing angle/package can play a big role  in how bright the LED looks.
AskElectronics,38vox5,Walmart_Internet,1 point,Sun Jun 7 07:15:01 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. That should probably work. One thing to watch out for with those Vishay super caps is a very high ESR. Looks like those are on the order of tens of ohms, so some power will be wasted there, as well as limiting your max current draw. Also they have a pretty high leakage current, on the order of 0.1-0.2mA, so that's going to take a (small) chunk out of your run time."

Lithium ion is more space/weight efficient but charging is more complicated and it might not be quite the exact voltage you want for your inverter.  24*11 watts is 264W so I'd recommend a 350W or better inverter just to have a safety margin.  At 300W you'd need a pretty big battery to last any real length of time.  It is similar to a car battery lasting with the lights and fan all on.

If you use the spray button and little spray tube extender, like you see on WD-40 sometimes, you might be able to hack up a couple of those automatic spray things so that they would just push that button down.  To trigger the motion sensor, you could mount the sensor heads so that you could have a servo turn a half-circle opaque plate into the sensor's ""view.""  If you're okay to hack the circuit boards in the sensor heads and have some arduino-type experience, you can probably skip the servo and just trigger the spray by switching it with the arduino. Which might be pretty darned cool.   You can get some pretty small air cans now, mainly the sort you find in dollar store in the novelty/party supply area as a ""stadium air horn."" You could build a bunch of maneuvering gears on a smaller scale. With enough, you could place them all over the costume and operate them in sets as though to assist the wearer moving in space.

There was a gap between the door and the frame on the top that was filled with a rubbery material to provide a seal. I was able to displace a bit of that in a corner and run the coax from my satellite dish through that gap.  This was ordinary coax. It got squeezed a little bit when the door was closed, but that did not cause any noticeable degradation in performance.  If you google ""flat coax"", you can find special flat coax cable designed for running over/under doors and windows. Example. Another Example.  A sliding door is essentially a big sideways window, so if that's what you have instead of a hinged door, flat coax could work. If you live in cold climate and are concerned about the door or window not closing all the way, you could put some kind of insulation in there to fill the gap made by the flat coax.  My friend who lived in the apartment above me also had a dish on his balcony. He simply ignored the apartment's prohibition on drilling holes and drilled in an unobtrusive place, and was willing to eat the minor cost of repairing the holes before moving out. Are you sure that's not an option for you?  As far as your original idea of doing it wirelessly, the approach I'd look at would be to put a small computer outside with a TV tuner and wireless networking, and software to allow controlling the tuner over your home wifi network. Put a streaming video server on that computer, and arrange to stream it to your TV. You can probably also make it easy with this approach to stream to your indoor computers, tablets, and phones.

A voltage drop occurs when induction motors or very low impedance loads are connected, initially. That's why some people see their lights dim for a split second when their heater or AC system turns on.   If you were to flip a main breaker on and off repeatedly, and there were large inductive loads running, the turn off would cause a voltage spike, and the turn on would cause a voltage drop.  Someone also said something about capacitors in this thread. Capacitors wouldn't cause a voltage spike as they resist a change in voltage. It is possible for capacitors to cause voltage drops, though.. but we know the impedance of both inductors and capacitors is based on frequency. At 60/50 Hz, capacitors would have high impedance and inductors would have low impedance.   The main cause for a voltage drop when the power is suddenly flipped on is induction motors or electric heaters. The main cause for voltage spikes is when inductors are suddenly switched off. I.e. pulling the power cord out of the wall with a vaccum still running or ignition coils on a vehicle.   The electrician switching the main power on and off very well could have damaged electrical devices, considering that they were introduced to repeated undervoltages and potintial repeated overvoltages."
AskElectronics,38rng0,StyrofomE_CuP,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:52:08 2015 UTC,"At X frequency, capacitors would have Y impedance and inductors would have Z impedance   It depends entirely on the values of said inductors and capacitors.  Also, don't get confused by the Z there; it's just a placeholder (X, Y, Z), not a standard symbol."
AskElectronics,38rng0,PointyOintment,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:57:59 2015 UTC,"Yep you're entirely right. I'm assuming household sized capacitors and induction motors. The run/start capacitors on an AC unit are typically in the uF range, which is pretty high impedance at 60 Hz. The blower motors can range up to several horsepower. The impedance of an induction motor greatly depends on its load but in order to produce a couple horsepower, the motor will have to have a pretty low impedance compared to the caps."
AskElectronics,38rng0,StyrofomE_CuP,4,Sat Jun 6 22:19:32 2015 UTC,"When a switch is opened on an inductive load (i.e. a motor, like in an air conditioner) it produces a voltage spike.  Sensitive electronics not on surge suppressors may not like that.  I doubt that doing it several times quickly is particularly bad, except insofar as if there is an X% chance of damage each time, doing it 10 times is a 10X% chance.  (ok, 1-(1-X)10 or whatever.)"
AskElectronics,38rng0,euThohl3,8,Sat Jun 6 07:50:05 2015 UTC,"What I could see being a problem, is that any power pumped back into the line by a device after the breaker is open has nowhere to go.  It won't be sucked up by the power company because it can't get through the switch - it can only go into another device."
AskElectronics,38rng0,bradn,7,Sat Jun 6 13:42:05 2015 UTC,"You are getting downvoted for some reason while some guy that just says 'ground' is getting upvoted, but you're right. There will in fact be an inductive voltage spike for the exact reason that the current has 'nowhere to go', i.e. the magnitude of di/dt is much too large. The net effect depends on the input impedance of all the other devices on that breaker circuit, but you could end up with voltage spikes on every other device on the circuit. If you are concerned about this happening again, ask the maintenance man to flip all the individual breakers off before flipping the main disconnect off, that way inductive flyback voltages will be limited to the circuit they started on - probably your AC or fridge. If your electronics are on the same circuit as one of your big inductive loads, get a surge supressor.  As for why this happens, the non-mathy answer is that inductive devices like motors store energy in a magnetic field. Changing a magnetic field quickly results in an electric potential difference roughly proportional to the strength of the magnetic field and how quickly it changes. This means that a big inductive load like a motor coil with a big current going trough it can produce a pretty impressive voltage spike if you shut it off fast enough."
AskElectronics,38rng0,idiotsecant,3,Sat Jun 6 15:55:45 2015 UTC,"If your electronics are on the same circuit as one of your big inductive loads, get a surge supressor.   Yeah, this is probably one of the places where surge suppressors will legitimately help, with the caveat that many of them will only clamp to 600V.  Personally I think this is too much and won't stop a lot of things from being damaged.  Something that clamps at 200V (115VAC) or 400V (230VAC) would be a lot safer.  A lot of the time lightning damage doesn't happen from hot<->neutral/ground anyway, but rather the electrical power wiring as a whole, and the complementary path being a phone line, or cable hookup, or something else.  Having proper surge suppression where these other connections enter the house is really important."

AskElectronics,38rng0,mattfromtelevision,2,Sun Jun 7 02:20:15 2015 UTC,"Voltage spiking is definitely a thing. Power companies recommend that you unplug all electronics in your home during an outage to prevent damage to your electronics when the power is restored. When the electrician flipped the breaker off, it was equivalent to a power outage. When the breaker flipped back on there was a large demand for power since the windings in motors of your A/C, central air and refrigerator had to charge back up. Also all of your wall wart step-down transformers had to charge up. Also all the inductors in all your AC-DC converters had to charge up. When an inductor is first charging up it has very low resistance, which means it draws lots of power, helping to create the voltage spike. Repeated voltage spikes can damage equipment.  Get surge protectors for equipment you can't afford to have damaged. Note that not all power strips are surge protectors.  As a complete aside, you mentioned that your apartment and your neighbors were wired together. Make sure you're being metered independently so you're not getting overcharged. Sometimes power companies do some weird figuring when there's only one meter to measure multiple dwellings. Also since you already have weird wiring, it may be entirely likely that your apartment is wired to other ""public"" spaces (such as hallway lights) which means that you are paying for this electricity. Check out some of the stories in the comments of this post. One guy found out that the public washer-dryer room was pulling electricity from his apartment, so he was paying a lot extra to run those units."
AskElectronics,38rng0,KapitanWalnut,6,Sat Jun 6 07:53:17 2015 UTC,"When an inductor is first charging up it has very low resistance, which means it draws lots of power, helping to create the voltage spike.   No, inductors resist changes in current - they have a large resistance when voltage is first applied to them. It's the capacitors that have low resistance when turning on and charging up.  When things turn on they'll cause the voltage to drop, not spike, due to the increased current draw and wire resistance. Spikes are caused by inductance when things suddenly turn off."

Check out the bottom of page 3 from this paper where they begin to talk about transient sources within your own facility (home).

AskElectronics,38ral9,0OKM9IJN8UHB7,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:05:59 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately no amp clamp or similar, just a regular multimeter.  A heat sink is recommended (been using fine for a few years without one) but here is the thing I find strange: the tripping does not necessarily happen when a lot of charge is being passed.  I.e. the unit is used both to bring the bath up to temperature and to hold it there.  Obviously heating the bath causes a lot more ""on time"" than holding it (which for typical temperatures consumes 100-200 W as computed from the duty cycle).  However, the breaker sometimes makes it through the heating portion and then trips during the holding portion."
AskElectronics,38ral9,Purple-mastadon,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:21:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the suggestions, I just checked out the circuit breaker again and noted it is actually a thermal circuit breaker, it seems likely the heat from the relay is actually setting it off.  Datasheet here: http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/65/CTB%20from%20Thermal_Catalog-471605.pdf  This also explains why it stays tripped even after removing it from power.  Doesn't really answer why this started happening recently, but maybe the relay gets hotter than it used to?  Or the breaker has become more sensitive?  At this point would you replace the relay or the breaker, or mount the relay on a heat sink?  The only problem I see with a heat sink is that without a vent in the box (not ideal when working around water), won't it just radiate/convect the heat to the circuit breaker anyway?"
AskElectronics,38qv99,InductanceIsFutile,3,Sat Jun 6 01:18:41 2015 UTC,"My guess is that your voltage booster draws a lot of current on startup as the capacitors charge, and that is what is causing your voltage rails to sag. I would bet you that your simulated 555 doesn't limit current like a real 555 would.  P.S. a phantom powered microphone or other device can draw up to 8mA in some cases. It takes 32mA at 12V to push 8mA at 48V with 100% efficiency! Be aware of this!  P.S. I would replace the connections to ground in your 555 with connections to -V. Twice the voltage swing and current into your charge multiplier means less stages and less load on your virtual ground."

I was also planning on adding some sort of buffer (maybe using MOSFETs or op-amps?) before the booster because apparently 555 timers can only supply around 100mA -- probably not enough for up to four microphones.   I tried a bit of troubleshooting:  I connected my -6V rail to the ground portion of my 555 timer. +V went down to a constant +4.7V and my -V went up to +1.4V (not a typo). Output was a constant 6.4V rather than a square wave.  I switched out the 'Rated' 555 timer for an ideal one. This made things better somehow. Voltages were at +5.97V, -4.89V, and the output of a constant +10.9V.  Then I changed the load resistance from 200 to 1k. Voltages went to +6.00V, -5.98V, and output 12V constant. I'm glad that the power supply is no longer being overloaded, but the thing still isn't oscillating.  https://i.imgur.com/mkdFfWL.png  I should also mention that Multisim really hates my regulator's diodes, despite the fact that this source says that they're good to use. Disconnecting the diodes resolves heaps of ""Error: Connecting Power to Bidirectional: X to Y"" errors, but doesn't actually fix the timer problem."

Next you may want to re-think the decision to run the voltage multiplier off the post-regulator supplies rather than the pre-regulator supplies.

The proper way to do PWM, during the off phase the motor has a short circuit applied to it.  That way the current continues to circulate through the motor.  It is equivalent to driving the motor with a DC voltage produced with a class D amplifier, only that you make use of the motor's inductance as the filtering element of the class D amp.  Of course, it requires high frequencies.  With your kind of PWM you only have to make the frequency above the mechanical time constant of the motor.

EDIT: what kind of motor control applications do you use that forces a short circuit on the OFF phase? I'm rather curious.
AskElectronics,38nv07,karma911,2,Fri Jun 5 19:12:35 2015 UTC,"short-circuiting a motor causes the rotor to violently brake   Suppose you have a motor with 4mH winding inductance being powered by a 12v, 10khz, 50% duty cycle PWM signal.  Let's say there's some load on it and so rather than the ideal 6v, its back-emf is only 5v.  Let's suppose that the moment the PWM signal goes low, the current in the windings is +1A.  The back emf is now reducing the current in the windings.  It changes at a rate of -5v/4mH, or, -1250 amps/second.  But the off period only lasts for 0.5/10000, or, 50 microseconds.  In that time, the current changes by 50uS*(-1250 A/s)=-63mA.  Which is pretty small.  The whole time that the motor was in the pwm off phase, even with the windings shorted, the current stayed positive.  Now yes, if you had kept it in that state for 1A/(1250A/s) = 800uS, the current would have gone to zero and reversed, producing the braking you speak of.  But that is why you do this at high frequency."

AskElectronics,38nv07,karma911,2,Fri Jun 5 19:47:57 2015 UTC,"Huh, that makes sense. What's the advantage of doing it this way?   Literally, everything.  Lower electrical noise, lower mechanical vibration, higher efficiency, faster control response, linear velocity transfer function, regenerative braking, hell, braking at all.  It's just a more elegant method in general.  The arduino crowd always tells you to do pwm at 500hz or whatever.  I'm not really sure why.  I guess beginners have trouble making high frequency power electronics work, because they lack oscilloscopes and math skills.  Or maybe it's because they think capacitors ""smooth"" things, and that can end very badly."
AskElectronics,38nv07,euThohl3,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:04:31 2015 UTC,"The same motor result, yes.  The difference is that control would be extremely weird/difficult and losses would be insane if you didn't use the FETs as switching devices."
AskElectronics,38nv07,nasty_nate,2,Fri Jun 5 18:14:17 2015 UTC,"MOSFETs don't have a very large linear region, so you'll probably struggle to control the speed with the kind of precision that PWM would give you, and the biggest concern is obviously heat.  A TO-220 MOSFET with no heatsink can dissipate about 1W safely. If you have a 12V supply and want to run the motor at say 7V, anything more than 0.2A would already require a heatsink. That's basically a single computer case fan. Do the same with an unfiltered PWM signal and you can control 20+ of them."
AskElectronics,38nv07,bal00,2,Fri Jun 5 13:28:02 2015 UTC,"If you're switching the transistors (which is the only way you should do this), you will save a lot of efficiency.  However, driving them isn't as simple as you're making it out to be.  You'll need a ""high-side driver"" for the transistors at on the top of the H-bridge.  I'll try to explain simply:  An n-MOSFET (I'll be taking some guesses about your hardware btw) is turned on/off with its gate-source voltage.  To turn it on you need a high gate voltage, and to turn it of you need a low gate voltage.  Both of these are voltages RELATIVE TO THE SOURCE VOLTAGE.  This is the crucial point; I hope you won't mind my caps.  Anyway, the sources of the top devices are connected to the outputs of the bridge, meaning they are always changing in voltage.  You can't drive the gate with a PWM signal that varies relative to ground if the gate needs to be varied relative to the bridge midpoint.  A high-side driver will (depending on the type) use a ""bootstrap capacitor"" and optical isolation to allow you to drive the gate properly, even as the source voltages vary.  If all this sounds complicated to you, I'd encourage you to check some digikey options for high-low drivers.  I'm sure there are packaged solutions through which you can connect the PWM source to the MOSFETS will minimal additional components.  Good luck; have fun.  EDIT: To specifically answer your question:  If you switch the devices, you can reduce losses to a tiny fraction of the output power.  It's complicated, but you seek to run the FET's in either zero voltage or zero current at all times.  In theory, this would lead to no losses; in practice, nothing is perfect.  Still, compared to linear-region operation you will reduce FET losses by orders of magnitude, especially at lower output powers.  Secondly, every single bit of control theory I've ever seen with SMPSs is based on switches being switched completely on or completely off.  The math is actually really simple and elegant.  The non-linear operation you'd get without using PWM for switching is nothing like this.  Control of the motor/inverter would be impossible."

AskElectronics,38njgr,nasty_nate,2,Fri Jun 5 21:46:48 2015 UTC,"This is hard to follow because you've not defined anything.  Vc's polarity should be labeled on the circuit and the resistors shouldn't share the same name.  That being said, V_L = L dI/dt when V_L and I are defined with the passive sign convention.  If you don't follow this convention (ei. you define I as flowing into the negative side of V_L), then you will get V_L = -L dI/dt.  When I taught I always tried to impress on my students that labeling circuits was one of the most important parts of solving it.  Draw the circuit large to leave room, and then be sure to define things clearly.  If you define a voltage, Vc, across the capacitor with the positive side being one the left, then you'll find the following:  i = -Vc/R  (Ohm's law on the top resistor)  i2 = C dVc/dt (definition of a capacitor)  Vc = L di3/dt + i3 * R  (KVL around bottom + Ohm's law + def'n of an inductor)  From there it's just algebra.

The output appears to be fixed but tweakable, which is not sufficient. What you need is an adjustable power supply. If the LED strips you're using are designed to work with 12V DC, then you'll want an adjustable regulated DC power supply that can output something like 2-12V.

Power tool batteries are wired in series - this is the configuration that needs active balancing.  The voltage adds up (two 4.3V cells makes a 8.6V pack) and the current capacity is the same (two 1 Ah batteries makes a 1Ah battery).  These can be combined - a 2S2P battery pack has 4 cells - two parallel sets in series.  You could theoretically wire cells in parallel to make your own pack, but I don't recommend it for the following reasons:  1) Soldering battery cells takes special techniques - laser welding is often used.  If you heat up the cell too much, it will probably catch fire.  You probably won't be able to put out a lithium fire (a fire extinguisher won't work unless it's class D).  2) You don't actually know that the cells are balanced when you connect them together - they could be from different manufacturing runs, different manufacturers, or even different chemistry (pack vendors often use multiple cell sources).  If there's even a little difference in voltage, you can get a large amount of current between them.  Since you're connecting the bare cells together, the current is not limited and again, could start a fire.  3) Even if you manage to get the cells together, if you're using the protection circuitry from one of the original packs, the circuitry won't be rated for the resulting pack.   Using protected cells is a better idea, (there's a guy doing that in this video).  However, it's still risky because 18650 cells have variably quality protection.  You still need a cell balancer if you're putting them in series.  Cell balancing is not that hard - there are purpose built ICs for that.  You can read about how it's implemented here"
AskElectronics,38mmox,PlatinumX,2,Fri Jun 5 06:19:21 2015 UTC,"Don't you mean 4.2 V?  It sounds like you are contradicting yourself. You say cells of the same chemistry can be combined in parallel even when the capacity differs, and that they are self-balancing, yet you go on to say that a parallel pack cannot be made without balancing. The OP isn't asking about series, they are asking about parallel.  The answer from what I know is yes, yes you can make a lithium-ion parallel battery without balancing. In fact it's a common practice when we look at hobby RC batteries, such as those from Hobby King."
AskElectronics,38mmox,lavaslippers,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:26:55 2015 UTC,"Different chemistries have different maximum voltages.  The highest I've seen is 4.35.  Parallel cells are self-balancing over the lifetime of the pack if the pack is manufactured with balanced cells.  A more obvious way to think about this is at the extremes.  Imagine two parallel cells connected with exactly the same voltage.  No current will flow between them when they are connected because there is no voltage difference.  Then, imagine two parallel cells, one fully charged at 4.3 volts, one completely depleted at 3 or 2.8 (or wherever you consider ""fully"" depleted) - you will get a ton of current flowing, only limited by the internal resistance of the pack (if not protected).  This is what is not safe.  If your voltage difference is less radical, you will get less current, but it will still be there.  In the video I linked when the top plate is connected to 10 batteries at once, what will happen is the current would suddenly start to flow between all the batteries at once, from the most charged to the least charged.  If you're very confident about the state of charge of your cells (manufacturer, cell batch, time since manufacture), you could do it, but I'm extremely conservative when it comes to lithium ion."
AskElectronics,38mmox,PlatinumX,2,Fri Jun 5 17:02:04 2015 UTC,All you have to do is leave them connected together a while with a 50 ohm resistor or something and they will equalize out.  This really isn't as bad as you're making it sound.

AskElectronics,38mmox,PlatinumX,2,Fri Jun 5 14:54:47 2015 UTC,"What happens when the smaller cell depletes/charges first?   The key is the smaller cell would not deplete or charge first in a parallel configuration.  The discharge current is proportional to the  capacity.  If you have a 1 Ah cell and a 2 Ah cell in parallel, then draw 3 amps, you'd get 1 amp from the 1 Ah cell and 2 amps from the 2 Ah cell.  If the two cells are equal size, the current will be pulled from them symmetrically.  If they are unequal, the current will also be unequal.   what makes the ""2/3/4P lithium ion pack"" you refer to self-balancing if any pack I build will not be?   When making a pack, the cells are sourced from the same company/batch and are balanced at the time of manufacture.  So they know the chemistry and charge level are the same.  If you safely get 2/3/4 cells of the same run and charge level together in parallel, the resulting pack would be self-balancing."

As /u/KapitanWalnut said, its not easy to control the speed of an AC motor from DC.    For DC motors, the simplest but inefficient way is to vary the voltage applied to the motor.  By ""inefficient"" I mean it dissipates excessive heat, speed is not linear with voltage, and it actually shortens the life of the motor due to coil resistance vs voltage and power dissipation.  For DC motors the next step up, there is something called PWM.  Instead of controlling the motor's speed by keeping the motor 100% on but at (x)% voltage, PWM controls the speed by keeping the motor (x)% on but at 100% voltage.  The analog version of PWM for AC motors is variable-frequency drive.  To my knowledge, lighting controllers are not meant for this kind of drive."

Changing from one coil to the next is one step, which is (usually) a 90° electrical rotation, since after 4 steps you are in the same configuration again. To do micro steps, you want to do smaller steps than 90°. One simple way to do this is by activating two coils at the same time. That way, your rotor will set into between to steps, which is at 45°. Now, if you vary the current going into each coil, you can get even smaller steps. For example, putting twice as much current in one coil as the other will cause the rotor to move more to that with more current, which would cause a angle of 30°/60°. By varying the ratio of current between both coils continuously, you can get any angle between two steps that you want.

AskElectronics,38k620,ExasperatedEE,7,Thu Jun 4 19:24:21 2015 UTC,"The job of a buffer is to replicate a digital signal and also increase its tolerance to being degraded by other circuitry.    For example, a standard microcontroller may be able to output either 0 or 3.3v from a pin (logic 0 and 1 respectively), and it may be able to change from logic 0 to logic 1 in 5ns.  This allows you to produce a nice clean signal like this (black line).  However, if you start to connect things like a capacitor, LED, or other chips to the microcontroller pin, the microcontroller may struggle to maintain the 0v and 3.3v levels and may also have trouble keeping its 5ns rise time.  The signal will look like this (blue line) .  All the buffer does is take the signal from the microcontroller and reproduce it.  Unlike the microcontroller, the buffer has a higher tolerance for being loaded down and the buffer will more faithfully output the correct voltages with fast rise times.  A level translator is similar to a buffer in that it replicates signals and is tolerant to being loaded down by other stuff.  However, it contains an additional feature.  Remember how in our example 0v and 3.3v corresponded to logic 0 and 1?  This is not always the case.  Sometimes your microcontroller will use 0v and 3.3v, whereas something you want to connect (an accelerometer for example) to it will use 0v and 5v instead.  what happens when you connect the two?   Well, the microntroller will try to communicate with the accelerometer.  It will send a 0 at 0v, and the accelerometer will recognize the 0v as logic 0.  Everything is fine so far.  However, when the microcontroller sends a logic 1 at 3.3v, the accelerometer may not recognize that as logic 1 since it expects logic 1 to be 5v.  A level translator will allow you to convert between those voltages.  When the microntroller outputs logic 0 at 0v, the level translator will output 0v.  When the microcontroller outputs logic 1 at 3.3v, the level translator will output 5v instead.  The accelerometer sees 0v and 5v and everything works out.  Some level translators also work in reverse, allowing the accelerometer to send 0v and 5v back to the microcontroller and convert the voltages back to the 0v and 3.3v that the microcontroller will recognize as logic 0 and logic 1."

Like, I can always expect a translator to be able to go from 3.3V to 5V or vice versa, and a buffer can do that sometimes, if the inputs are tolerant, but mostly it's for boosting signals, and a translator can be bidirectional, while a buffer never is?"
AskElectronics,38k620,TheMuffinMan91,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:21:41 2015 UTC,"A buffer only goes one way.  A transceiver is basically a buffer that goes both ways.  A level shifter may only go one way, or it may go both ways.  To answer your other question about using buffers in places where you have different logic levels (such as interfacing 0-3.3v logic with 0-5v logic) we need to talk a bit about logic levels.  You probably already understand that digital logic consists of two states: 0 and 1.  0 usually corresponds to a low voltage (like 0v) and 1 corresponds to a high voltage (like 3.3v or 5v).  The truth is that for most digital logic, there is a range of voltages that correspond to a 0, another range that correspond to 1, and sometimes there is a range of voltages that have ""undefined"" behavior (i will go back to this later).  Here is the datasheet for a 74HC125/74HCT125 quad buffer chip.  If you look at page 5 of the datasheet you will see a table that specifies the logic levels for the 74HCT125.  You can see the following:  High level input voltage: min: 2.0v, typ: 1.6v Low level input voltage: typ: 1.2v, max: 0.8v   These numbers are telling you the range of voltages that the chip will interpret as a 0 and 1.  The manufacturer is telling you that these chips will always interpret anything below 0.8v as a 0 and anything above 2.0v as a 1.  Any voltage between 0.8v and 2.0v will result as undefined behavior, meaning the manufacturer cannot guarantee that a voltage in that range will be interpreted as a 0 or 1.  So, lets say your microcontroller outputs 0v for a 0 and 3.3v for a 1.  If you hook a microcontroller output to this buffer, then the 0v your microcontroller outputs will be interpreted as a 0 by the buffer because it is <0.8v while the 3.3v will be interpreted as a 1 because it is >2v.  This means that you can use this buffer as a level translator and it will probably work fine.  Now, lets say you instead are using a microcontroller that outputs 0v and 1.8v as logic 0 and logic 1.  The 0v will once again be <0.8v so the buffer will see it as a logic 0, but the 1.8v is not >2v, so the buffer may not see the 1.8v signal as logic 1.  This means that your system may not work at all, or worse- your system may work intermittently.  This kind of intermittent failure can be very difficult to debug.  So what is the point?  Well, you can get away with using a buffer or transceiver in place of a level translator, but you will need to check very carefully that all the logic levels are going to be compatible if you want to ensure consistent operation of your system.  Even if the logic levels all are compatible, there are some other caveats that I haven't told you about that could cause problems in some circumstances.  If you are only working on non-cricital hobbyist stuff, feel free to experiment and see what works.  Just remember that you usually want to be using the correct tool for the job; buffers are not designed with level-shifting in mind, and level shifters are designed to do exactly that."

They are often bidirectional as well.  Some buffers will work as unidirectional level shifters, but only certain cases. TTL (or HCT, ACT) logic running on 5V will accept >2V as a high. LVCMOS (which runs on 3.3V) has minimum 0.7 * 3V output, which is over 2V, so using a TTL gate here is effectively a 3.3 -> 5V level shifter. (but doesn't need to be, 5->5 is fine was well).  In the reverse case, newer logic types like LCX, LV, are 3.3V logic, but don't blow up with 5V on the inputs, and output 3.3V, so they can shift 5V down to 3.3V. (HC running on 3.3V would let the smoke out).  Hopefully that makes sense... You kind of need to know about the logic families to understand it."

It can be modified fairly easily to accommodate a crystal but you probably won't need the thermal stability, just tweak the car radio's frequency if it gets faint.

AskElectronics,38hkrj,DJPhil,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:52:04 2015 UTC,"That's the sort of stuff I like hearing, I didn't know that.   A pure sine wave with no distortion represents a single frequency or tone, in both audio and RF. Any other shape of waveform by necessity contains multiple frequencies. If the waveform is distorted in such a way that every cycle or half cycle experiences the same change in shape then you'll find those other frequencies are harmonics, or multiples, of the fundamental (or lowest) frequency. Assuming that you start with a single frequency you can distort the snot out of it any way you like (for example symmetric or asymmetric clipping of any magnitude), but you'll only be able to make tones that are harmonics of the fundamental. The amplitude of each of the harmonics generated by clipping is mathematically related to the shape of the clipped waveform.   You can work all this backward while looking at a scope (time domain) to make some educated guesses about what you'd see on a spectrum analyser or FFT (frequency domain). If you're looking at a scope and you see a 1MHz asymmetrically clipped sinewave you're looking at a signal with significant even harmonic content (2, 4, 8 MHz on up), the amplitude of which will be proportional to the severity of the clipping. Symmetrical clipping has the same relationship with odd harmonics (3, 5, 7 . . .).  If you want to explore this further without a spectrum analyser you can use various audio software or simulators like LTSpice to play around in simulation. The principles are the same, and the weirdness of RF is minimal at frequencies as low as AM broadcast. A better explanation of what I clumsily attempted above is available here, and the remainder of that website represents maybe the best general electronic reference work I know.   I take it this is all the interesting noise on the radio dial near the quiet spot I'm aiming for?   Possibly. The AM band is full of natural atmospheric noise. It pretty well describes where to find the loudest RF noise from lightening strikes, and so it gets hissy and crunchy with a vengance this time of year. It's also full of the collected RF garbage of mankind. You can usually find 50/60Hz mains harmonics (yeah, even that high) and noise from switching power supplies and motors of all kinds. If it makes a spark it makes broadband noise, so cars (the older the louder) and electric motors with brushes make quite a racket. Grab an old portable AM radio and walk around your house, see what you can hear. AC units and cheap CFLs are usually pretty loud, for example.    Buffering the input and oscillator helps a lot.   Can you explain further?    Sure, but I have to leave right now, back to edit this in a few hours."
AskElectronics,38hkrj,DJPhil,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:28:05 2015 UTC,"Sure, but I have to leave right now, back to edit this in a few hours.   Please do, this is very, very, informative.  On the noise thing I mean that stereotypical old timey radio whistle/whine/howl, it gets very pronounced right around the actual carrier frequency with the circuit powered up."
AskElectronics,38hkrj,DJPhil,1 point,Fri Jun 5 04:25:57 2015 UTC,"Back, I'll start with buffering.  This page gives a good explanation of why buffering an RF oscillator is good.  Sine wave oscillator design is complicated by the fact that any load placed on the output, by circuits that the output is supplying, effectively places a damping resistance across the tank circuit. As well as reducing the amplitude of the oscillator output by having the effect of reducing the Q factor of the tuned tank circuit, this can adversely affect both the wave shape and the frequency stability of the oscillator waveform.  A changing load can suck as bad as too heavy a load. A buffer allows the oscillator to happily sing into almost no load at all on it's input, and provides a low impedance, powerful output that can be used to drive other things. Buffers are super useful for keeping one part of a circuit from playing hell with another and creating a complex interdependent puzzle for you to troubleshoot. Buffering the audio part of a transmitter will help ensure that the drive to the modulator transistor is well controlled and can help ensure that weak signal sources don't wind up distorted.  I'm not sure what you mean by the noise you describe. Let me start by describing normal operation of an AM transmitter like the one described above.  A clean sine oscillator at 1MHz will sound like dead silence in a nearby properly functioning AM radio. As you tune across it the background noise will drop to nothing and then rise again after you pass it. If you gently modulate the amplitude at 1kHz then you would hear a faint 1kHz tone on frequency that fades to noise in either direction on your radio dial, but never changes in frequency.  If you were to tune an AM radio across 1MHz and you heard a rising or falling frequency then what you might be hearing is the radio and the transmitter interacting with each other to produce a beat frequency. Most AM radios have FM too, and are superheterodyne, so there are frequency conversions going on within the radio that make it sensitive to outside EMI on a few particular frequencies. If the oscillator is radiating many harmonics then we're back to that complex interdependent puzzle from earlier.  Most of the energy in an AM transmission is located in the carrier, with the modulation sidebands that contain the audio making up the rest. If you're using a radio with Single Sideband demodulation (SSB) and you tune across an AM station (very common in shortwave) you'll hear the carrier as a loud tone that starts at a high pitch and drops in frequency as you approach the carrier. When you're exactly on frequency the carrier is inaudible as it would be essentially a zero hertz tone, and you can hear any modulation on the carrier clearly (speech, music, whatever). Tuning away from the station in either direction will cause the loud carrier tone to rise in frequency from sub-bass all the way up to dog whistle and the program material will fade in loudness proportionally. SSB demodulation is not really appropriate for AM signals, but it sort of works, and it's downright necessary for SSB transmissions, but that's off topic.  If this stuff interests you I'd strongly recommend getting an old ARRL handbook and reading up. They're released annually and any used paperback from the last twenty (or even fifty really) years will work just fine for learning RF electronics or even electronics in general. Contact your local ham radio group and ask around, someone's bound to have a copy to lend. Amateur radio is all about learning and playing with this sort of RF stuff. Hop on over to /r/amateurradio if you have questions."

Then I did some work to halfass isolate the input with a 100uF electrolytic on the transistor side of R2 (- towards transistor) and a Y brach of two 470 ohm resistors on the other side of the cap to combine the left and right channels from the input. I also replaced R2 with a 10k pot, which seems to be helpful.   I also noticed that even at 10megaohms, the scope was seriously loading the circuit down, causing wacky behavior. I found I could better look at things by setting the scope to max sensitivity (1mV/div), coupling set to ""HF rejection"", probe on 1x, and touching the probe to an end of the enamel wire inductor coil. This seems to provde me with a beliveable waveform (that appears to be all AM when modualted!) without affecting operation.  Now I'm getting somewhere with it, I'm getting shitty transistor radio fidelity at this point, range around 4 feet(good enough), I think some more tweaking might actually make it passable. It appears to like 1.5 V more than 3 V, with such low power consumtion and no suitable regulator on hand, I think I'll just splice in another pot to play with that with more precison."

The Fluke brand name is on it and it's a solid, reliable, and somewhat pricey piece of kit.  It'll still measure down to 1 mV and 1 mA, autoranges, and measures capacitance, but only measures up to 1 kHz and I'm not sure if it'll do PWM.    If you want an electronics meter (with measurement capabilities and accuracy in the lower portion of the scale) which can still do most of the stuff that the electricians' meter can, you can get a very good meter for under $50 or $100 (see Dave's videos to that point).

AskElectronics,38f149,Malik_Killian,2,Wed Jun 3 19:57:12 2015 UTC,"Those tools are 20V max, 18V nominal -- so you are really looking for an 18V DC power supply.  Then the current requirements need to be determined.  It looks like a typical tool gets about one hour use from a 4 amp-hour battery, so you should obtain an 18V power supply with at least say, a 5 amp capacity.  A switch-mode power supply would be a lot smaller than a linear supply, so you might look for one of those.

You could simply find a DPDT relay to switch the signals and tie the grounds together. Something like this would do.

AskElectronics,38euyx,Toy_D,2,Wed Jun 3 19:43:27 2015 UTC,"Well if it's a speaker that's a bit easier.  You know there is going to be two wires for the left side audio.  Can you trace the input lines from where they come into the circuit board until they go back off the board.  Can you visually inspect, with a magnifying glass, the connections to the volume control?  Generally you want things to be turned off while your hands are in them, but in some cases when you're probing a signal, it will have to be on.  Since you can hear the signal faintly, it could be an open circuit somewhere and you need to find the point this happened and repair it.  I'm not sure the multimeter will help too much since you're looking for an audio signal.  You could try disconnecting everything and start measuring resistance comparing the right side to the left.  connect a simple wire between the pos/neg of each output and measure resistance between each side pos/neg working your way back to the input.  Ideally you want it to read exactly the same on both sides, and if you can find a point of difference, maybe you've found your trouble spot.  This may not work depending on how much digital interconnection there is, but it's a shot."
AskElectronics,38euyx,Toy_D,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:55:05 2015 UTC,"Both wires for the left (even checked right, just in case I mixed them up bc that's totally possible with me) looked fine themselves and were firmly connected to the board on both ends.  Took a gander at the control pod, one of the wires has a slight cut in the plastic tubing, and also it just seems like the whole set up is a cluster fuck asking for a short, but then again, I don't really know much about anything.  With respect to the subwoofer's circuit board, is it possible that a component has a problem and that only caused one channel to be a bit fucky, or would that have caused problems in the entire system?"
AskElectronics,38euyx,Toy_D,2,Wed Jun 3 20:21:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's possible that it's a component problem, but if it's a left channel problem, I'm not sure you'd find it on the subwoofer board.  However, you said you dropped it.  So, assuming that's what initiated the problem, it has to be a physical disconnection or broken point somewhere.  You just have to find out where.  It may even take probing the connection points with fine tools while inspecting for loose connections.  The problem with modern day electronics is that they are so small that its very difficult to find these.  I'd look for broken solder points at the volume control area.  Not just the left channel inputs, but control inputs as well."

However, when I plug the headphones directly into the computer, it's fine.  I believe I read somewhere that the sound goes through the pod to the subwoofer and then out the speakers/back to the control pod for the headphones, but I don't know if this person was right or not."
AskElectronics,38euyx,classicsat,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:35:26 2015 UTC,Basically you're going to have to physically trace wires.

I traced where the cable from the control pod goes into the circuit board to the left channel wires, but I'm not really seeing anything sketchy or out of place along the way.   edit: probably an important/stupid question I should have asked earlier, but how do I know that the wires that I'm following are from the left channel.  My process went as follows: L and R inputs are right next to each other on the outside. Found their location on the circuit board, which was some half cylinder...thingy...and connected to that are four cables. On the outside, the L channel is on top, R channel on bottom. On the inside, the wires are vertically stacked. Are the top two definitely going to be for the L and bottom two for R?"
AskElectronics,38euyx,MATlad,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:29:44 2015 UTC,"If the wires awe oriented that way outside, they'll likely stay that way since there's no good reason to change it.  Keep in mind you're looking for small break points in any connections.  It can also be the inputs to that op amp so it won't amplify.  You just have to check everything.  You can set the meter to resistance and check from part to part looking for low resistance.  This indicates that wire connection is not broken.  An OL or open means it is broken and maybe that is your problem point.  Do not do this through the parts since that will vary your readings in unexpected ways.  Only do this on the output of one to the input of another.  Inspect all the way from left side in to left side out.  Then do everything that connects to that op amp."

Almost always(actually, always), /u/fatangaboo has much better answers than me on these kinds of things, so hopefully he'll comment.  Ug.  You're using 1N4001 for signal levels?  I would really consider using 1N914 or 1N4148 for that application.  They may work OK, but 1N4001 diodes are really only rated for power line frequency rectification.  Signal level diodes exist for a reason.  You really need to measure the voltage drops across RE1 and RE2 at a no signal condition.  Assuming that two diode drops equal two VBE drops is somewhat risky.  If these don't match really close, your quiescent current could be too high or too low.  Too high wastes power, and too low will have crossover distortion.  For a class AB1 amp, the current should be almost zero, but not quite.  There are ways to adjust this.  Do some testing with a bench supply to see if your idle current is OK.  Plot your input voltage and output voltage on a scope to see how linear your amp is.  X-Y mode is good for this."

You could do it all with discrete logic but you'd need a counter, a clock circuit, display drivers - probably more work than it's worth, unless you want the practice of doing that.  You'll want to multiplex the digits - turn on one digit at a time, but fast enough that the eye doesn't see the flicker.  That way you need 11 outputs - one for each segment and one for each digit.

AskElectronics,38cwxh,classicsat,1 point,Wed Jun 3 12:35:42 2015 UTC,Are there any downsides to leaving the battery connected to the panel in the dark?
AskElectronics,38cwxh,DilatedSphincter,2,Wed Jun 3 14:04:58 2015 UTC,"If the solar panel has a built in diode, no.  Without a diode the panel will consume current when dark."
AskElectronics,38cwxh,classicsat,2,Wed Jun 3 15:58:37 2015 UTC,"It is just not drawing the current to turn the FET on, and from status LEDs,  That is somewhat how my charge controller works."
AskElectronics,38cwoy,honey_pie,2,Wed Jun 3 12:12:01 2015 UTC,"This is a harder problem than you think.  It's not just about converting voltages -- laptops are generally not designed for variable input power.  That is, they have absolutely no concept of ""it's kind of cloudy, I guess I'll just charge my battery slowly.""  Most likely you will need an extra battery in the system, so that the laptop can draw as many watts as it wants, and when the battery is empty a circuit would  cut off the laptop and wait for the solar to recharge the battery."
AskElectronics,38cwoy,euThohl3,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:58:05 2015 UTC,"So if say, the laptop was turned off and connected to the solar output (regulated to 19v).. what would happen as the available current varied? it wouldn't charge slowly, like phones and tablets seem to have no issue with?"
AskElectronics,38cwoy,GaianNeuron,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:00:41 2015 UTC,"Solar chargers are just that -- battery chargers. They aren't designed to output a constant voltage like your laptop expects at its DC input port.  The laptop will have a charging circuit which is designed to take that constant voltage and use it to apply voltage to the laptop battery's terminals, as is appropriate for the battery chemistry (these days, lithium-ion or lithium-polymer).  A solar charger is designed to take the fluctuating voltage input from a solar array, and apply that voltage to a battery, either directly in short bursts (PWM type), or by running it through a buck-boost voltage regulator (MPPT type). The voltage output of this charger, like the laptop's internal charger, will depend on the battery's chemistry (for solar installations, usually lead-acid).  Without a battery in-between, the charger's output won't be usable."
AskElectronics,38cwoy,GaianNeuron,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:48:32 2015 UTC,"Without a battery in-between, the charger's output won't be usable.   I'm struggling to understand why. The regulator (as part of the solar system) should ensure constant voltage surely? So why can't it charge the laptop's battery?"
AskElectronics,38cwoy,GaianNeuron,1 point,Thu Jun 4 09:38:01 2015 UTC,"EDIT: okay, instead of being a sarcastic bitch, I'm going to point you at Battery University (Google it). Go look up ""charging"". It's WAY more complicated than ""look up nominal battery voltage, apply to terminals"", in fact, doing this won't actually charge most batteries very far at all."
AskElectronics,38cwoy,GaianNeuron,1 point,Thu Jun 4 11:50:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you for not being a sarcastic bitch, I had no intention to suggest that I know that you're wrong, I just want to understand it.. that might provide a solution.. [i'll read your suggestion ASAP] and if I need to include another battery in the system then that's fine and I'll do that.. but I still need a system around it to charge up from the panels (they have a 5V output, although that seems limited to a max of 2A, so there could be some value in creating another system.. or I guess charge 2 batteries simultaneously) and output to something that can charge/run my laptop. So how would you suggest going about that.  I was under the impression the batteries commonly used with these things were li-ion the same as laptop and mobile phone batteries.. so surely it is just an issue of creating a proper charging control circuitry? can't that be done externally either.."
AskElectronics,38gkn5,frankdboss,5,Thu Jun 4 01:49:05 2015 UTC,An Arduino cannot replace a logic board.  Time to buy a new one.
AskElectronics,38gkn5,uint128_t,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:00:13 2015 UTC,I'm sure you could build new guts for it but I'm sure people will argue that Bose has better signal processing.
AskElectronics,38ceka,downloaders,4,Wed Jun 3 08:55:07 2015 UTC,obligatory warning about 220v - it can be lethal.  you can get various timing devices on ebay heres an example  and another that might be suitable (you would need to check with supplier)  its probably preferable to use a 12v  timer and drive everything with a 220 to 12 volt power supply  connected to the fridge light to minimize exposure to 220v wiring  the only other thing you would need is a buzzer perhaps a loud one
AskElectronics,38ceka,paultz,1 point,Wed Jun 3 10:17:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your advice, I have done many projects like this, so the security part is covered, thanks though. I was more searching for a way to execute this, and wanted to have some opinions. I have also checked out that 12v timer you posted above and think it is a good solution, because its small and also enclosed. But it runs on 12v, so i would need a very small 220v to 12v converter to attach it too, and maybe replace the actual bulb with a led light (from those 12v) and the buzzer like you mentioned.  EDIT i noticed now you also posted a power supply, that on is 200v AC to 12v AC though. But something like this would work right?  Thanks for all opinions"
AskElectronics,38ceka,Tech_Entrepreneur,3,Wed Jun 3 12:56:10 2015 UTC,"First of all if you have problems with your door not closing properly, many times (especially on older fridges) it is due to the magnetic seal around the fridge door failing.  Replacing it would be the most straight forward way to solve your problem.  If you are intent on having a buzzer for your fridge, then Stay Away from mains!  You could build a system based on 555 timer and a switch, that is actuated by the door.  As for the power source you could use standard Alkaline batteries (provided you use it in a fridge, not a freezer) or you could could use a small DC power supply."
AskElectronics,38ceka,TurnbullFL,2,Wed Jun 3 11:39:17 2015 UTC,"The problem is not the door, its more forgetting to check if it closed properly ;) This actually happened 2 times in 5 years or so, I'm doing this mostly for fun,and not an eminent need. I would like it to be only dependent on the bulb socket so it is stand alone and I can remove it at any time if the misses doesn't like it for instance ;)"
AskElectronics,38ceka,TurnbullFL,3,Wed Jun 3 13:02:45 2015 UTC,"For the power supply, I suggest a wall wort and a light socket to receptacle adapter."

AskElectronics,38cmlg,Lawrence_The_Lurker,3,Wed Jun 3 10:26:14 2015 UTC,"I would create something more solid state instead of this microcontroller fake stuff.  analog oscillation is fairly easy to create with just a few components and no code.  Take the circuit in this image.  It outputs a small pulse every microsecond.  You can alter the 555 timer values per the datasheet to do it, say every tenth of a second, or even small width 10 times a second.  Then, make it a low voltage output, say < 1 V.  DC bias it with your 5V, and use that timer to charge a capacitor.  So you get your small ripples using a charging/discharging DC biased capacitor output.  Plus, only a few inexpensive (pennies per) parts."
AskElectronics,38cmlg,Toy_D,2,Wed Jun 3 14:44:35 2015 UTC,"OP, don't waste your time and money with an arduino. You can make exactly what you need with a single chip and some analog components. Use a 555 timer IC and you can get a pulse generator with a specific duty cycle that you choose. I can help with the circuit if you want, but you should be able to find all the schematics you need with a google search of ""555 pulse generator"".      Seriously, using an arduino is not only overkill, it won't teach you anything about electronics, and I can't stress enough how much more money you'll have spent once you're finished with it. An arduino costs maybe $20 at best, and my solution (a piece of perf board to mount the components, the chip, some resistors and capacitors) will cost you less than $3. Additionally, it will have a longer battery life, and you won't have to mess around with code, it will work as soon as you're done building it."
AskElectronics,38cmlg,DrFegelein,2,Wed Jun 3 14:51:21 2015 UTC,High Five timer buddy!
AskElectronics,38cmlg,Toy_D,0,Wed Jun 3 14:52:20 2015 UTC,If he wants to display game data he will need a processor. Your suggestion is great until it needs to talk to some kind of data stream.   PS A basic Arduino can be had for a few bucks.
AskElectronics,38cmlg,pugworthy,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:14:22 2015 UTC,"He didn't mention interfacing with the game at all though. You might be mistaking him when he says ""I will be replacing the analog measurements with units involved in the game"", all he means there is that he'll replace the paper units inside the meter, no interfacing with the actual game was implied."
AskElectronics,38cmlg,DrFegelein,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:29:06 2015 UTC,"You could do it with any milliammeter (or microammeter), and Ohm's Law, and a microcontroller's digital-to-analog output.  Including PWM output.  Just use Ohm's Law (R = Vdacmax/Ifullscale) to choose the appropriate resistor R which will make the milliammeter read full scale current (Ifullscale) when the microcontroller's d-to-a output is its highest possible value (Vdacmax).  This may be preferable since it works with dozens of different microammeters and milliammeters, AND it doesn't assume your dac maximum output is 5.0V.  It might be 3.3V.  Or 3.0V.  Or whatever your microcontroller does.  Just pick a matching resistor and feel proud of using an equation (Mathematics!!) in your design."

AskElectronics,38cmlg,realrube,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:26:50 2015 UTC,...and a cool oldschool meter.
AskElectronics,38cmlg,realrube,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:30:15 2015 UTC,"Quite easy to do. I am building something similar for a project. (Game data displayed on an analogue gage).  Best bet is to buy a voltage displaying analogue gage. A 5V one also means you can drive it without bothering with amplifiers etc.  Best bet would be to drive it with an arduino. If you don't know if it, Arduino is a combination of open source board with a microchip driver and USB, combined with a software package that makes programming it to do simple (or not so simple) takes quick and easy. The coding environment is based on C and is easy for beginners. They are easy to get hold of.   With these 2 it should be fairly trivial to send the data from the computer via serial to the board, the board then scales it etc and sends out an analogue (technically a pwm, but so fast it approximates analogue to the gage) signal to the meter. I am driving 6 gages this way.  5V Analogue Gage (I'm still waiting for mine, but it should be fine)  Arduino (official, can also be ordered from several official suppliers)- These support arduino's development etc   Arduino (Chinese clone)  Arduino (Miniature board, same core microprocessor but smaller and cheaper)  Hope that helps"
AskElectronics,38cmlg,cynar,1 point,Wed Jun 3 11:25:20 2015 UTC,"You could do it with an Arduino and a 0-5V DC voltmeter. Specifically, I'd get an Arduino Nano clone (~$4) and connect it to one of the USB ports internally. That provides power and lets you program the thing. The voltmeter would be connected to one of the Arduino's PWM ports, and you could then move the needle using analogWrite(0-1023). 0 would be 0V and 1023 would be 5V.  Because the Arduino maintains a serial connection to the computer, it would also be possible to send data to the Arduino from the PC and control the needles using software on the PC.  You could also add an IR or ultrasonic distance sensor for $1-$2 and have the needles respond when something/someone approaches the panel."
