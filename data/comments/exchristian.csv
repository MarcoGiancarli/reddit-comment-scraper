But then he proceeds to show that all knowledge is encultured as was the Incarnation of Jesus. Therefore, is no such thing as an objective, neutral standpoint from which to judge any of the world's stories. Even science itself is not acultural, ahistorical access to nature as it is. Scientists too as scientists walk by faith and not by sight.  Doubting always requires a ground on which to stand, and faith is suspending doubts until contact is made with reality."

Your frustration is justified; priest's/lay Catholics are dependent on the Church for emotional integrity and/or physical sustenance.

Another cousin came out to me privately that he was gay, but told me he wasn't sure how God felt about it and was trying to decide whether he would be celibate for life or not. A different cousin talked about how she could really feel God's presence one day when her daughter had been throwing a tantrum and instead of being angry about it, she was able to just be calm and peaceful, and how it was like God was just telling her ""You can do this"".

I actually grew up listening to metal when I was a little little boy, but when my family converted when I was 10, metal was a no-go. I got into Christian ska, it being the next best thing, and the one thing my parents would allow no matter what (even though, secretly, it's deeply, deeply, unsatisfying). One year for my birthday, my cousin bought me the Project 86 debut CD and told me it was kind of like ska. I put it in, and it was without a doubt the heaviest thing I'd ever heard up to that point. First track for reference. I was a little repulsed and freaked out by it. I shut it off after the first line of lyrics, but that crunchy roaring sound wouldn't leave my head, and so a few weeks later I put it back in and discovered I loved it. I still listen to the band.   my dad, a highly educated and respected doctor in our small town sat me down and told me that this music was dangerous, would make me violent, is demonically influenced, and that there are supposed studies that show that it is detrimental to mental health (Source with peer reviewed evidence please?)   2 things:   I recently read this article with research showing that a person had to have a doctorate-level education before they started to shake their superstitious thinking. This statement kind of makes me think that research is wrong. I mean, there are tons of doctors and PhDs wandering these lands with a wide variety of blatantly irrational religious thoughts. It makes me think the truth is even scarier: we can never know if we're ever capable of shaking our irrationalities. I went to a private Christian school when I was in high school, and the bible teacher was gone for a week or so at a conference, so the owner of the school stepped in and played us a series of tapes in which they discussed having rats try to solve mazes while playing Iron Maiden, and not only were the rats incapable of solving the mazes, but they dissected the rats and found ""strange growths"" at the base of their spinal cords. So not only is metal going to send you to hell, but it's going to give you some kind of retarding cancer. I laughed out loud. A couple years later when we got our first internet connection, I Lycos'd or Yahoo'd or AskJeeves'd (them's the days) the internet about that study, and big surprise, not an ounce of truth to it. Well, the only potential truth is that the rats might have been spooked by the metal, it being a sound they'd never heard before, and therefore might have been too disoriented to solve the maze. But no retardation, no brain growths.    I find 2 Timothy 1:7 sadly ironic, ""For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind,"" because many fundamentalists fear everything and anything that they don't understand or care to understand (Pokemon, He-man, Halloween, evolution, fun), condemning it as satanic, and instilling fear and paranoia into their own children.   I remember quoting that to my parents. They would talk about the spirit of discernment. I remember arguing that discernment wasn't the same as reactionary fear.

exchristian,3dznx0,vicdamone911,14,Mon Jul 20 20:50:10 2015 UTC,"Man, I just typed a long comment and accidentally hit refresh. I hate how my touch pad is like operating a stone tablet when I want to use it, but it's like a delicate bed of feathers when I'm trying not to touch it.  In short: toward the end of my time with Christianity, I started to think Christianity would be better off if it dumped Paul. I mean, somehow his authority is assumed and trusted even though the only real place to confirm his authority comes from books he wrote. That's confirmation bias and circular reasoning. ""Paul is god's apostle because the book he wrote says he is."" I mean, if a guy today said he met Jesus on the road, no one believes him, especially if he goes on to write thick boring books about it.  Also, Jesus' closest followers did not like Paul. Acts records a pretty big fight they get into. Three (maybe 2) of Jesus' disciples are ripping Paul a new one in front of the temple. When you read Paul's own account of it, he's all like, ""Oh yeah, we all, like, hung out and gossipped and got our nails done, and we hit that new felafel joint, but they were all like, 'oh yeah Paul, you totes should carry on the savior's legacy, like, to the gentiles, man!' And then we were all like high fivin' and makin' out. Pretty sick bro!"" So, that shows either Luke (the purported author of Acts) or Paul was lying, know'm'sayin'? And if Luke is lying, that means 1/4 of the gospels are unreliable.  There are also key differences between what Paul and Jesus taught. Jesus had virtually no restrictions on women and their responsibilities, and Paul is famously misogynistic; Jesus spoke about sex maybe twice, but never about homosexuality (which could easily be because he assumed that everyone else knew it was bad), but Paul lays down hella rules; Jesus has a pretty sharp focus on following the law, but Paul is pretty low down about it. If Paul is for Christians, then why is Jesus for Christians? The stuff Jesus says is pretty hardcore essene/temple Jew, which has a huge focus on purity, temple rights, and the law. Paul is all like, ""Oh yeah man, eat pork, don't get circumcised, do the sabbath whenevs. I mean, as long as you're not gay, it's totally cool.""  There's also substantial archeological information showing Paul wasn't straightforward about his identity. When you read Paul, you have an image of a serious old school rabbi, but in reality, he's like a white kid wearing a feather head dress because he discovered he's ""like, 1/16th Cherokee dude,"" by which I mean Paul was way more Roman cosmopolitan than he was Jewish. His education wasn't even Jewish.  I don't know how all of that could possibly help, because like I said, your husband's belief run parallel to rationality, and I'm sure he's got a way out of every one of those points. If you bring them up, report back, because I'm always curious to see how people wiggle out of pretty basic and blatant facts."

exchristian,3dznx0,JesusHMontgomery,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:40:05 2015 UTC,I have not had a chance to speak my case about Paul just yet. I researched and found that Paul after being enlightened then went on teaching for three years before he decided to talk to any of Jesus' disciples (you know Jesus's chosen to help spread his word).  When he did they dismissed him but he just ignored them. Then it was 13 years before he started to bring his message to Jesus' chosen people. Why would Jesus appear to a Jew to tell about salvation for Gentiles? Why would the disciples not have had the same vision or teaching as Paul?

exchristian,3dznx0,etherias,3,Tue Jul 21 02:40:26 2015 UTC,"For starters you could ask him what basis he has for making that assumption aside from reliance on his own interpretation of the texts. What scriptural proof does he have that the only relevant passages from the bible are those written by Paul? Attempt to challenge his self-appointed authority. Who is he to make that decision, to cherry pick from God's supposed word? What makes his interpretation more correct than that of other Christians, especially well versed scholars who have devoted their lives to the study of Christianity and the bible?  Secondly, you could challenge his reliance on Paul's teachings. If Paul's word is the only relevant basis for which he should conduct himself in his beliefs, then ask him if he truly believes things such as 1 Timothy 2:12 - “I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she must be silent.” If he doesn't believe that, then ask again, what authority or basis does he have to cherry pick? If only Paul's teachings are relevant, but then only some of his teachings are relevant, what sort of ground does his belief really stand on? Is he not just willfully reconstructing and making up his belief system as he goes? If that's the case, how can he really call himself a Christian? If he is only willing to accept a fraction of the teachings of Christianity, what makes him a Christian at all? Why would he worship a God who would deliver an almost 2000 page long book of His word to mankind only for 90% of the teachings to be irrelevant within a millennia or two? Why would an infallible, omniscient God waste time laying down extremely finite laws for only one small tribe of people, when he could have instead gave mankind as a whole lasting, timeless, powerful lessons which would have shaped their behaviors for the better? And why would he deliver the message for all people outside of that tribe through one single man during one single time period, rather than through multiple authors over generations as he did with Old Testament teachings? Doesn't the singularity of Paul's teachings discredit their authenticity as being nothing more than the opinions of one man, rather than holding the weight and credibility of being divine law? Wouldn't God, being omniscient, have been able to foresee that delivering a message to the gentiles through Paul alone wouldn't have been enough? Why did no other authors beyond Paul echo his sentiments to affirm the validity of his words? Also how does he account for modern systematic contradictions to Paul's teachings, like female pastors? Does he believe it's acceptable or not? On what logical grounds, either way? And if he believes that actions and adherence to old laws do not determine the admittance of a person into heaven, how does he account for the lives of non-believers who were never introduced to Christ, were raised within another belief system, or were isolated from His message? If their good works cannot save them, only their belief alone, despite having a handicap by the circumstances of their birth, how does he make sense of this in a way that leaves room for admirable worship of a fair and just god?  Hope that wasn't too much of an overload. It sounds like your husband is grasping at some serious straws to justify the threads of his faith.

He had no answer except that it is not a problem for me because I do not aspire to ""teach or lead men"" because I am a former Christian and an Atheist. We had to stop talking about that subject because I became really really angry at this ignorance and we have not broached the subject again.

And you also need people to translate the Bible, so you need scholarship to study language translation. And etc. You can carry this logic on to til you make the point that saying ""all you need is X plus nothing"" makes zero sense.

exchristian,3dznx0,SparksMKII,2,Tue Jul 21 01:58:42 2015 UTC,"Well, there's two things to be discussed. First, the definition of faith. Second, the authority of Paul.  The modern definition of faith generally runs along the lines of accepting something as true despite lack of, or contrary evidence. The definition of faith by Paul was that ""faith is the substance of things hoped for, of things unseen"". These two definitions don't line up very well. Paul seems to be saying that when you hope for something that doesn't currently exist (or can be seen), and then that hope comes to fruition (ie, physically manifests) then that is faith. It's a pretty muddy definition of faith. We can hope for dinner that night and receive it without exercising faith. Personally I think it's an important distinction though, as so many modern christians slip back and forth between modern reinterpretation and traditional interpretations without being aware of the hypocrisies that arise.  As for taking ones entire faith based on Paul's letters alone, both jesus and Paul referred back to the old testament in order to strengthen their argument. One of the major steps in me leaving the christian faith behind was to read Grudem's Systematic Theology. It gave me a much greater grasp of the necessity for the bible to be read as a whole. The vast majority of the doctrines that modern christians follow are built upon many different parts of the bible. More often than not, the doctrines are built upon assumptions as well. This is a big part of why we have young earthers and evolution deniers. In order for christianity to be true, its foundations must be true. If the garden of eden is a myth, then original sin is a myth. Without original sin, then human beings aren't inherently sinful. Without that, not all people are in need of a messiah. That's the easy example, but there's plenty others. What it comes down to though, is that without jesus fulfilling prophecies of the old testament, and without Paul staying true to the old testament, neither have any authority. It's my personal experience that in order for a believer to be receptive to rationality, they must begin by viewing their own faith rationally. For me, it was learning about the history of the church, formation of doctrine, systematic theology, and finally, watching and participating in countless debates.   It's been a while since I've given this sort of thing any though, so please excuse me if I'm just pointing out the obvious to you (I've only just found r/exchristian ). Good luck in your efforts!"

exchristian,3dznx0,drunkwithblood,2,Tue Jul 21 04:49:23 2015 UTC,"He believes that the only thing we need for salvation is the letters of Paul in Romans and a few books that Paul was said to have authored.   Saved from what, exactly? Paul never talks about ""personal salvation"" or an afterlife of hell for the unsaved.  Paul's main obsession is with whether or not Gentile converts need to become Jews and follow the Torah. His solution, to completely ditch the Torah, is at odds with what Peter and James teach and practice according to Galatians. The logic of some of Paul's arguments is quite bizarre when you analyze them closely. (Though I have met few, if any, churchgoing Christians who could actually summarize the overall arguments laid out in a single epistle; the theology of evangelical Christians is usually based on a handful of popular proof-texts.)"
