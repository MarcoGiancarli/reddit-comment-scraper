It is commonly regarded as the first daily comic strip. The concept of a newspaper strip featuring recurring characters in multiple panels on a six-day-a-week schedule had previously been pioneered through the short-lived A. Piker Clerk by Clare Briggs, but it was Mutt and Jeff as the first successful daily comic strip that staked out the direction of the future trend.

I think I came up like 10m short of 1/4 but got credit for it anyway.  I had really good endurance but could never get into the sub-elite range because of my ""lack of speed"".

With their big brown eyes, and heart-melting smile it's hard not to fall for them. They are different, in a beautiful way. Even though they've had a bad past, you'll never know it. They are really strong people, and they change for the better. They are there when you need them, and they value their friendships. They like to look good, and dress well. Handsome, and charming. Very successful at life, make great Dads. Known to be players but when they meet that special girl, their sold. Matt's come off as tough and solid, but deep down, their soft side comes out and you see the sweet gentleman in them. They're not popular, but not a loner either. Friends love them, and guys want to be him. They have a really laid back attitude about themselves, but at the same time they can be the life of the party. Even though they can be a jerk at times, they mean well and are really the nicest guys ever. If you have a Matt, don't let him go. None other compares.  I had to edit to remove the nauseous ""Matt or just mat"" part but other than that it's solid"

matt,34s5u2,flatlineskillz,1 point,Mon May 4 15:09:38 2015 UTC,"I work in IT and there are tons of Matthew's in the field(as there are everywhere). I prefer Matthew but unfortunately, the propensity for it to get shortened to ""Matt"" overrides personal preference due to people's laziness.  When I started this latest job, and knowing it would be a long term thing and not just another 1-2 year gig, I said that if you couldn't call me Matthew to call me by my last name. This was particularly important as I work for a very large company and there were about 20 Matthew/Matt's working in my department. It has caught on and many people call me that now.  Interestingly enough, my last name is two syllables and yet people won't/can't shorten it further. It's the ideal situation: I have a unique name and identity."

matt,2xocma,patt_patt_hat,26,Mon Mar 2 15:38:50 2015 UTC,"Matthew, but you can call me ""Gift from God"" if you're feeling formal."
matt,2xocma,IGOTDADAKKA,3,Mon Mar 2 18:56:19 2015 UTC,My mum told me that's what Matthew means as well..
matt,2xocma,unicornial,8,Wed Mar 4 02:40:02 2015 UTC,Matt. The other 3 letters are a waste of ink and human energy.
matt,2xocma,Mattvision,8,Mon Mar 2 16:12:37 2015 UTC,I think the only problem with Matt is people confusing your name with Mac or something of the sort. I also think Matthew sounds a bit more professional.
matt,2xocma,Mehrk76,2,Mon Mar 2 16:35:15 2015 UTC,"Matt here. I tried going by Matthew when I was stuck in the suit and tie world, but stopped after the one gay guy at the office hit on me my first day of work. I went back to Matt real quick and he got the hint.  My nephew couldn't say Matt when he was younger, but he could say ""Mack"". He is almost 12 now and still calls me Uncle Mack. I don't know if he actually knows my name IS Matt. No one has told him that I know of. Even some of my friends call me Uncle Mack..hah"
matt,2xocma,MichiganManMatt,2,Tue Mar 3 10:26:06 2015 UTC,"My young niece started with ""Mac"" which evolved into ""Macaroni""... Now I'm Uncle Macaroni. It's not so bad."

matt,2xocma,william_liftspeare,2,Mon Mar 2 18:19:19 2015 UTC,I knew a guy who only went by Thew. He said Matt was stupid. I'm guessing he isn't allowed to be apart of /r/matt

matt,2xocma,onomnomnom,6,Tue Mar 3 00:13:24 2015 UTC,Just never been a fan of the Matty
matt,2xocma,IvarBiggen,4,Tue Mar 3 00:35:57 2015 UTC,"Why not both? Matthew for formal, Matt for everyday.   Honestly I kinda think it strange if a Matt's legal name is not Matthew. They are missing out."

matt,2x6m4m,TomB722,27,Thu Feb 26 01:41:42 2015 UTC,"I think our popularity comes from our simpler qualifications. If you're a Matt, you're in. Some of our mothers call us Matthew when she's angy, and even the Mats of this world are at least half amazing.  I can't imagine it so simply for you guy, what with your hidden H's, your mies, your mas-es, its a lot more confusing.  Plus, you know, we're just so awesome"
matt,2x6m4m,mattwandcow,8,Thu Feb 26 01:57:04 2015 UTC,"Possibly. You raise a good point. We have such a range of different variations of Tom, some even sounding the same, like Tom and Thom that it may become hard for us Toms to know that there is a sub dedicated to all shapes and forms of Tom.  -Tom"

matt,2x6m4m,Xethaios,6,Thu Feb 26 10:02:33 2015 UTC,Heathen. The extra T is there for the nickname. The first T is to give the nickname that 'at' sound and the second is to give the full name the 'th' sound. If your name is Mathew then your nickname must be 'Math'. Nobody likes math.
matt,2x6m4m,MikeMo243,12,Thu Feb 26 23:10:07 2015 UTC,"Hey Tom, I'm neither a Tom or Matt.  Also, coincidentally I  saw your casualiama and saw the comment that led to /r/Matt and when I clicked it I saw you posted this about 20 seconds."

matt,2x6m4m,Belushimcc,4,Thu Feb 26 11:59:05 2015 UTC,I think that you're the 3rd or 4th person to ask me about Myspace. I never even used it Neobo. YOU CAN'T PROVE ANYTHING!  -Tom
matt,2x6m4m,utterable,2,Thu Feb 26 14:21:33 2015 UTC,I propose an alliance between the Matts and the Toms against the Chads. Any Tom shall be welcomed in r/Matt and any Matt will be welcome in r/Tom. And we all stand against Chad's assholery.

Saint Matthew was one of the twelve apostles of Jesus in Christian Theology.      The Hebrew name ""מַתִּתְיָהוּ"" (Matityahu) was transliterated into Greek to ""Ματταθίας"" (Mattathias),  which was shortened to ""Ματθαῖος"" – (Matthaios). Deceptively, it is therefore unrelated to θεῖος (theios) meaning divine (adjective, e.g. theology) or sulfur (Koine noun, e.g. thiol group).  The Greek Ματθαῖος was Latinised as Matthaeus, which became Matthew in English. It is commonly shortened to Matt.  The name is also sometimes used as an anglicisation of the Irish name Mathúin, meaning bear.       Interesting: Matías | Matthews (surname)   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

And I bet that place has the cutest waitresses and server girls who have the cheeriest smile on their face while they take your order and ask you, jokingly, ""you want ice and a straw with that beer buddy?"" Just to bust your balls a little bit in front of your friends so everyone can know that you're cool enough to be on casual terms with the pretty waitress. And you can guarandamntee that waitress drives either a truck, an old muscle car, or a motorcycle.   And the atmosphere, my God. This place has 12 pool tables, 15 dart boards, a bowling alley in the back, a bbq pit on the side, a basement for their own microbrew, they own a pasture outside town so they can make sure their food is living a good life before it becomes food, they've got a menu that makes Slaters 50/50 jealous, and they even sell hats and tshirts.  They even have an attic loft where you can spend the night if you've had a little too much to drink (just a little, nothing gets out of hand at this bar). If you need to get home but still had a little too much, they have reverse valets, where you give the valet your keys, he will drive you home, and another valet will follow. Once you're home, they give you the keys, driver 1 hops in with driver 2 and back to the bar they go!   I'd like to go to this place. Matt, where is it?"

It was developed from the general purpose UUCP dial-up network architecture. Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis conceived the idea in 1979 and it was established in 1980.  Users read and post messages (called articles or posts, and collectively termed news) to one or more categories, known as newsgroups. Usenet resembles a bulletin board system (BBS) in many respects, and is the precursor to Internet forums that are widely used today.

matt,2r24sv,autowikibot,3,Fri Jan 2 02:02:09 2015 UTC,"Matthew (name):       Matthew (/ˈmæθjuː/; __MATH_-ew) is a given name that ultimately comes from the Hebrew name *Matityahu. Saint Matthew was one of the twelve apostles of Jesus in Christian Theology.      The Hebrew name ""מַתִּתְיָהוּ"" (Matityahu) was transliterated into Greek to ""Ματταθίας"" (Mattathias),  which was shortened to ""Ματθαῖος"" – (Matthaios). Deceptively, it is therefore unrelated to θεῖος (theios) meaning divine (adjective, e.g. theology) or sulfur (Koine noun, e.g. thiol group).  The Greek Ματθαῖος was Latinised as Matthaeus, which became Matthew in English. It is commonly shortened to Matt.  The name is also sometimes used as an anglicisation of the Irish name Mathúin, meaning bear.       Interesting: Matías | Matthews (surname)   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Born just south of Colby, Kansas, he was his mother's pride and joy. Yes, and joy was just a thing that he was raised on, love was just a way to live and die. Gold was just a windy Kansas wheat field, blue was just the Kansas summer sky.  And all the stories that he told me back when I was just a lad. All the memories that he gave me, all the good times that he had. Growing up a Kansas farm boy, life was mostly having fun. Riding on his daddy's shoulders behind the mule, beneath the sun. Yes, and joy was just a thing that he was raised on, love was just a way to live and die. Gold was just a windy Kansas wheat field, blue was just the Kansas summer sky.  Well, I guess there were some hard times, and I'm told some years were lean. They had a storm in '47, twister came and stripped 'em clean. He lost the farm, he lost his family, he lost the wheat, he lost his home. But he found the family bible, his faith as solid as a stone. Yes, and joy was just a thing that he was raised on, love was just a way to live and die. Gold was just a windy Kansas wheat field, blue was just the Kansas summer sky.  So he came to live at our house, and he came to work the land. He came to ease my daddy's burden, and he came to be my friend. So I wrote this down for Matthew, and it's for him this song is sung. Riding on his daddy's shoulders, behind the mule, beneath the sun Yes, and joy was just a thing that he was raised on, love was just a way to live and die. Gold was just a windy Kansas wheat field, blue was just the Kansas summer sky. Yes, and joy was just a thing that he was raised on, love was just a way to live and die.

That one was pretty boring and I have some better ones (I think)  /2. Next was a joke about the xbox ring of death being faulty itself.  Following that comes the comments I worked hard on:  /3.

Gif I made from the comments of the thread.  /7. Gif I modified.  /8. Gifs that demonstrate how to perform autocoitus using portals.

You already programmed the cocoon you call Mom to make sure you'll be addressed as Matt when you make your human-form debut to the masses.    And, in doing so, your awesomeness inspired the people around you to bring  food and feed you along with other gifts and new experiences...

matt,2k0mrq,redneckstomp,1 point,Thu Oct 23 15:43:11 2014 UTC,I started skiing when I was 6 so I'm quite proficient. I tried snowboarding for the first time a few years ago and it was pretty tough to learn. I've been snowboarding maybe 3 or 4 times and I've progressed from total novice to beginner. I can link my turns and only fall occasionally. To answer your question I'd say snowboarding is harder to learn but easier to master.

Things have changed now, i'm still a pilot, and still looking to fly for the navy so i decided to keep it  As for the military, i come from a long line of military men. My father was a marine, and said it was some of the best times of his life. I also know a few aircraft mechanics and they love their job."

matt,2k0mrq,Sciar,1 point,Thu Oct 23 17:08:05 2014 UTC,"Hey thanks, Matt. I've done around 150 jumps in the past 18 months or so. I highly recommended doing it at least once."

matt,2k0mrq,MelloDeath,1 point,Fri Oct 24 00:58:58 2014 UTC,"I've considered it, but I need a lot more jumps and training to get to that point.  In the grand scheme of things, 150 isn't that many. Most highly experienced skydivers have thousands. In the skydiving world, I'm still considered quite new and inexperienced.  When you think about it, 150 jumps is less than 3 hours of total freefall time. It takes a lot more than a few hours to become an expert at something."

matt,2itx2m,TheRandomAwesomeGuy,10,Fri Oct 10 06:03:35 2014 UTC,Matt is a great name.  War tactic #1: Choose your battles. I wouldn't choose this one
matt,2itx2m,mampersat,5,Fri Oct 10 08:10:34 2014 UTC,"Just believe in yourself. Not in the Matt that we believe in; not in the Matts that you believe in. Have faith in the Matt who believes in you.  Just remember these words, brother. Know that these people who pick on you, Matt or not, are insignificant in the end. After school you will probably never see them again, and they don't matter that much.  As far as dealing with them, just pull straight, dead-pan serious face. Then just turn around and if possible, walk away. This face will show them you don't give a fuck what they think. After all who are they to judge you? They're nobody. They don't matter. Not to you. The only person whose opinion you should always value is your own.  Don't listen to those hating fuckers anyways. They're nobody."
matt,2itx2m,Xethaios,3,Fri Oct 10 06:18:06 2014 UTC,"True Matts' use their intellect and not their steel-laden fists.  Use your situational awareness to deduce what faults your bully possesses.  Maybe they have an alcoholic dad.  Maybe they have a single-mom who brings home different dudes like every week and he has to listen to them pound the absolute shit out of their moms vag, like, ""WHOOOOO WHOOOO the fuck train has pulled into the station!"".   Use his flaws against him.  But watch out, because if it is the single mom scenario, your bully is probably that kid who wears Army Surplus jackets and tortures little animals, so he'll probably be coming with a butterfly knife.  Fuck, don't follow any of that advice."

matt,2itx2m,DFrumpyOne,3,Fri Oct 10 15:59:36 2014 UTC,"The best way to get around bullying is to just ignore it. Act like you don't hear them at all. If you're forced to acknowledge them, you take their insults with stride or just own them if they're innocent enough like ""nerd."" Honestly, in today's day and age that word isn't even an insult.  Also, since he's a weeb, just imply that the only show he watches is Inuyasha. Or make a stab with hentai jokes, that might hit close to home."

matt,2itx2m,mriddell001,2,Fri Oct 10 12:44:29 2014 UTC,"If you're not quick-witted enough to verbally spar with them (does the bully have a girlfriend? If not, bring that up like ""what's your girlfriend's name? Oh, right.""), then you best bet is to let it go. If you don't react at all, they'll get bored and leave.   Or they'll kick the shit out of you, in which case, my bad."

It didn't help that I was suffering through some pretty rough emotional times for me. I hate Matty. His name was Matt also.   On the flipside, there are two people in this world that call me Matt: One of my absolute best friends from high school (who I haven't stopped crushing on for the past 10 years) and another friend of mine from the Netherlands. Hearing them call me that makes me feel special inside, like cuddling up with pile of warm laundry."

matt,2fcu0h,powder507,2,Thu Sep 4 00:45:16 2014 UTC,I used to have this on a small vinyl. I didn't know there was a video version until about 2 years ago. My grandmother sang this to me every birthday until she died.

matt,2b2ksr,meekstadt,7,Fri Jul 18 19:19:17 2014 UTC,"That's right. A Matt shares a name with admirals, generals, explorers poets and saints. Chad, on the other hand, shares a name with a little flap of paper that precipitates election recounts. I would be jealous too; but I'm not, because I'm a Matt."
matt,2b2ksr,SeaZucchini,3,Fri Jul 18 19:37:52 2014 UTC,I'm glad you are okay Matt.

So in the modern tradition of just rewriting things as they sound without regard to their origin, people just drop a T. It drives me nuts!"
matt,27ilt1,mattityahu,1 point,Tue Jun 24 02:37:15 2014 UTC,I have seen Mathias' with only one t before. Also being a Matthias I not only get asked about the T's but also about the H... And always have to spell my last name. Always.

matt,23bfhz,YourMatt,3,Fri Apr 18 00:34:17 2014 UTC,"I was in San Diego last week and got this at the Stone Tap House.  It was pretty good!  It's a saison, so it's not for everyone but I thought it was pretty interesting.  And yes, I only got it because it said ""Matt""."
matt,23bfhz,mattc286,1 point,Fri Apr 18 12:28:16 2014 UTC,"It's not really my style.  I like my saisons to be much lighter than this.  It's a style for subtlety, and with nearly 10% ABV, it's far from subtle.  The story that goes with is was really nice.  I like when a company bands together to recognize a fallen friend.  Proceeds go to this Matt's charities too, so it's not a case of profiting from someone's death.  But besides all that, I too did pick it up simply because of the name."

matt,22qj0l,utterable,1 point,Sat Apr 12 18:59:09 2014 UTC,"Maybe it depends on the time of day, you go, but that Arby's has the fastest service I've had during lunch hours outside of the one in downtown B'ham. I've never had any problems with the food there..but that's just me.  The chicken should be in the fryer for 5 minutes minimum. Yeah...I used to work at a different Arby's, and if the practice is the same as it was 8 years ago, they put new people in on the closing shift. The receipt says 9:19PM, so... probably a new person.  And you have no idea, jamocha shakes might as well be included with the meals here. They are... fairly popular."
matt,22qoez,Mattloaf3,19,Fri Apr 11 00:48:46 2014 UTC,The extra T in your name means you can't let people walk all over you. Remember that.
matt,22qoez,mattymogue,5,Fri Apr 11 02:07:52 2014 UTC,"I switched back to Matthew in my 20's to avoid this shit. Not that we can't handle it, but it's fucking annoying hearing it EVERY time..."
matt,22qoez,More_Cowbell_,3,Fri Apr 11 06:01:42 2014 UTC,Same thing with me but there's another Matt so we just attack anyone that makes any mat jokes.
matt,22qoez,gorvetus,3,Fri Apr 11 04:32:28 2014 UTC,(Un)fortunately I have the last name of Cox. Everyone leaves my first name alone.  You could change your last name to something that is easier to make fun of.
matt,22qoez,borediswhyimhere,3,Fri Apr 11 07:24:02 2014 UTC,"I can top you.  I'm a Matt and I just found this sub yesterday.  Yay!  Anyway, I work for an industrial distribution firm in sales.  A large part of our product line is rubber mats (like you see commercial kitchens or behind bars).  I hear the same joke.  Every. Damn. Day."
matt,22qoez,mfigroid,0,Fri Apr 11 21:00:19 2014 UTC,Matt in Arabic sounds like the word for dead/died. This girl I once met who speaks Arabic teased the shit out of me about it when she was new to the place where I work.

matt,1zgvh7,Hot_Wheels_guy,4,Tue Mar 4 01:27:07 2014 UTC,I hate myself for saying it but Leo should have won. A great day for Matt's everywhere but a poor day for cinema
matt,1zgvh7,hallmark1984,3,Mon Mar 3 23:06:20 2014 UTC,I haven't seen either of their performances so I can't give a honest opinion.  Leo is consistently a great actor. So I'm sure he'll be there again.
matt,1zgvh7,allclasszero,3,Mon Mar 3 23:24:55 2014 UTC,"No way, did you see Dallas Buyers Club? His performance was amazing. This is the one year where I think Leo actually wasn't ripped off. Gatsby was crap and Wolf Of Wall Street was amazing but Leo just kind of had to be a dick in it DBC required a whole range of emotion as well as a physical change in order to play the role."
matt,1zgvh7,Surf_Ninja,1 point,Tue Mar 4 13:14:11 2014 UTC,chiwetel should have won imo. though he and matt did give better performances than leo. a film like wolf of wall street just doesn't win oscars.
matt,1zgvh7,allclasszero,1 point,Wed Mar 19 18:36:04 2014 UTC,"An argument could be made for 12 Years A Slave being an ensemble film though. I think that's why he didn't ultimately. I mean Fassbender, and the girl whos name im not gonna try to spell were amazing as well."

matt,1zddr4,slydawg,5,Sun Mar 2 23:54:20 2014 UTC,"I have my private, taking the instrument rating checkride in the next week or so (weather permitting...) and continuing to work on my commercial after that. Nice to meet a fellow Matt pilot."
matt,1zddr4,slydawg,3,Sun Mar 2 22:21:11 2014 UTC,"It's an instrument rating.. as long as the weather doesn't make you need an alternate for your return to base approach you'll be good to go. Unless yours is like mine with the checkride happening at a different airport, and I had to also do a VFR flight there and back..."
matt,1zddr4,slydawg,2,Sun Mar 2 23:57:21 2014 UTC,"It is an instrument rating, however when your plane has no de-icing equipment and you're training in Ohio during winter, it's pretty much VFR only."
matt,1zddr4,slydawg,4,Mon Mar 3 00:57:02 2014 UTC,"Oh right, parts of the world that have winter. Not the Australian version of ""it's wet for a couple of days""."
matt,1zddr4,slydawg,2,Mon Mar 3 01:20:42 2014 UTC,"Yeah, the freezing level has been at the surface for the majority of the past few months. Which happens to be about how long I've been working on my IR. I wish I could be training in Australia."
matt,1zddr4,godofallcows,2,Mon Mar 3 01:24:06 2014 UTC,"Wow. Trust me you don't. I was FAA trained then did the conversion to the Aussy equivalent. IR here sucks. Didn't get cleared for a certain approach on your test flight? Not approved to fly it until you do another test.  I'm not sure about OH, but there were no NDBs in southern CA. Next thing I know that's all I have out here. A VOR at the nearby international airport and none for 100 miles. But a bunch of NDBs.  And don't get me started on the recency requirements down here."
matt,1zddr4,my_dog_rescued_me,1 point,Mon Mar 3 01:52:11 2014 UTC,"Damn man. That's rough. That would be incredibly frustrating to be so dependent on ATC to give you what you need.    We have a lot of NDBs in OH, but nobody uses them. You won't even find an ADF in most of the newer planes here. I've only done one or two flights in an airplane with an ADF, so I know how to use them on a very rudimentary level. It makes you appreciate VORs and GPS!"

Mechatronics is a multidisciplinary field of engineering, that is to say, it rejects splitting engineering into separate disciplines. Originally, mechatronics just included the combination of mechanics and electronics, hence the word is a combination of mechanics and electronics; however, as technical systems have become more and more complex the word has been ""updated"" during recent years to include more technical areas.

I don't really know that much about the long term effects of our current fracing methods because every company does something slightly different to make themselves competitive. I would like to know more about it, but I'm just a bottom level grunt and not allowed to ask questions. If it's anything like everything else, the big shots only care about the bottom dollar. They either don't know what will happen, or they do know and not worry because they'll be dead when it becomes an issue. (That sounds like I'm disgruntled because I am, especially if my future gets uffed up to make their present better.)   I can't really do anything about it until either more data is collected, or I get into a position to collect said data and make a difference.

matt,1xekcg,matt01ss,3,Sun Feb 9 04:04:03 2014 UTC,And yet she dumped you?
matt,1xekcg,inutero4,3,Sun Feb 9 04:43:52 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it was complicated, started dating her a week or 2 before I had to leave for school which was 2 hours away from home, I asked her if it would bother her if we started dating even though I was leaving, she said no it didn't. I made the effort to come back as much as possible 2/3 times a month for the weekend to see her and then this weekend when I got back on Friday she told me she can't handle it anymore, she would get angry at her self and me every time i left to head back to school, so she decided that it would be better to not be together.  I was able to tell from her voices, facial expression and eyes it was the last thing she wanted to do but she felt she had to.  We don't have any hard feelings towards each other but still feel like my heart was just stomped on. Oh well it's a part of life"

Going through high school, only my second name was used. Okay, that was cool. Pretty alpha and all that.  Now i'm at uni, and everyones switched back to matt, it was a wave of nostalgia, it was like coming out of a long hard winter, and tasting some by-gone forgotten fruit."

matt,1tjtkl,TheMattMobile,2,Fri Dec 27 05:34:03 2013 UTC,"5th grade! Was asked to write my name on a post-it and stick it to my desk. My friend decided to write ""Andy"" in place of Andrew, and I wanted to copy his move and went with ""Matt.""  Now I'm pretty interchangeably Mat/Matt/Matthew, but it sticks with me."

matt,1tjtkl,rex8499,1 point,Tue Dec 24 13:22:07 2013 UTC,"Same here, but it was just awkward to introduce myself as that in uni. Especially as its an american style first name"
matt,1tjtkl,Komania,1 point,Tue Dec 24 18:25:49 2013 UTC,"It was about 5th grade I think, when I decided it was easier to write Matt on all my school papers instead of Matthew, and then I insisted to my family that I wanted to be called Matt. Took awhile for them to do so.  Now when someone I don't know that well calls me Matthew, I jokingly say, ""Only my girlfriend and my mother call me Matthew. I know you're not my mother...so does that make you....???"""
matt,1tgs5l,SatelliteDaddy,24,Sun Dec 22 16:29:00 2013 UTC,This is the truth. I was just about to make a post on this. Matts are a herd creature. Among every herd of Matts is one Alpha Matt. Be the Alpha Matt.
matt,1tgs5l,hiesatai,7,Sun Dec 22 17:51:23 2013 UTC,I don't know. I was in the only Matt in my smallish high school and many people still used the matt surname format. The combination of the two just rolls off the tongue and sounds pleasant. I've had this conversation with people before.
matt,1tgs5l,sir_lurkzalot,1 point,Mon Dec 23 05:21:32 2013 UTC,That's what I'm talkin' bout. When you have two awesome names... you can't stop the awesome mouth flood... people must say both.

matt,1tgs5l,Mattloaf3,8,Fri Apr 11 01:05:12 2014 UTC,"Happens to me all the time! It's especially annoying when there are multiple Matts present and I'm the only one they use a surname for. I do have a monosyllabic last name though, so it flows nicely."
matt,1tgs5l,Subplot,3,Sun Dec 22 17:56:43 2013 UTC,"I haven't found this. When my current friend group formed there were two more senior Matts already there. Customarily, within this group one would go by their surname only. This is what the four Nicks had worked out, unless Nick Theirsurname rolled off the tongue better. I couldn't be either on account of close proximity to other family members. I had to be Matt Mysurname by default. However, when the other Matts and my brother left, I remained Matt Mysurname, or on occasion only Mysurname."
matt,1tgs5l,CatMines,3,Sun Dec 22 18:45:50 2013 UTC,"I was always Matt A throughout school.  In my current group of friends, I am the alpha Matt, and only Matt. Yet they all call me Matty Mysurname. The alpha I replaced must have placed some voodoo spell on them for if he ever returns. Matt, if you're out there, let my people go!"
matt,1tgs5l,AchtungKarate,3,Sun Dec 22 21:08:11 2013 UTC,"Sweet! When I hang out with a group of people that includes another Matt, I'm Matt and the other is Fullfirstname.  EDIT: A word."
matt,1tgs5l,blacklab,2,Mon Dec 23 05:16:22 2013 UTC,I am typically Matty which alphas me over all other Matts
matt,1tgs5l,muzog,7,Mon Dec 23 00:07:48 2013 UTC,Matty means you're the alpha Matt to the ladies.

matt,1tgs5l,davey57,2,Mon Dec 23 10:00:01 2013 UTC,"My group of HS friends only has one Matt....me. We are all a close group and have nicknames for nearly everyone. Mine is a variation of my last name. I hope I can still be their alpha Matt. As a side note, this thread is hilarious. I'm happy to have a place where I can share Matt issues!"
matt,1tgs5l,Danpad18,2,Mon Dec 23 18:25:18 2013 UTC,You're my alpha Matt <3
matt,1tgs5l,Dirschel,2,Fri Jan 3 18:18:10 2014 UTC,"I, surprisingly, have the opposite problem.  I prefer to be called Matthew and have made it a point to be called that, so everyone knows me by Matthew and everyone else is Matt Theirsurname.  It has distinguished myself at work, which is a great strategy as long as it's not a negative thing."
matt,1tgs5l,durrf,1 point,Sun Dec 22 19:13:39 2013 UTC,I once was the second Matt to move into the dorms. People called the Matt that was there longer than me Matt 2. I never realized that I was the alpha Matt..

Like Hannibal Lecter, Vito Corleone, Iñigo Montoya (you killed my father, prepare to die...), Atticus Finch... etc...  Also, all Matt are ""alpha"" unless they do something to tarnish this great name. In which case, they become lower than Daves and Adams...  Ain't nobody got time for that..."

matt,1ex9gd,imMatt19,9,Sun Oct 27 16:15:51 2013 UTC,"Hey Matt,  One day last summer, he and I were hiking in the Washington Cascades. The terrain was really steep and rocky and I lost my footing. I went off the side of the trail and tumbled a couple hundred feet, breaking my leg and collar bone. He came down the slope after me and for the first night stayed with me keeping me warm and safe. I kept trying to get him to go for help but he didn't want to leave. I finally passed out from the pain and exhaustion sometime the next day. Apparently, he went for help after I became unconscious. I came to with people around me giving me aid and telling me that my dog had led them to me. Actually, none of that happened. The truth is I was pretty depressed when he came into my life and he helped me through some hard times. I always feel like I should have a better story when people ask. Also, his middle name is Matthew."

Once when on a camping trip with my family before I learned how to ride a ride a dirt bike my brother, Brian, had taken my four wheeler fora long while and he left me on the beach, stranded and bored. My oldest brother, Ben, come speeding along and tells me that Brian fell and broke his collar bone. I hop on the back of Ben's dirt bike to retrieve the four wheeler when I see Brian on a sand dune writhing in pain. I look at him just lying there and say ""serves you right"" then I drove off on my four wheeler. A medical helicopter had to airlift him off of the the dunes to the nearest hospital. I mean, hey, dude shouldn't have left me stranded on the beach for 3 hours. There is no bad blood between us now but it's a good story to tell."

ANYWAYS.  When I was maybe 10 or 11, I googled my name, to see what came up. The first result was a MySpace profile. The title was ""Matt Fuckin' Marin."" I was curious, so I clicked the link, the account itself was very inactive, unused for maybe a year or two (MySpace was dying and/or dead at that point, for context). I scrolled through all the profile comments and on July 9th, there were a bunch of messages along the lines of ""R.I.P, Bro. Happy 23rd b-day."" And, you know, stuff like that. July 9th is also my birthday. I don't remember what comment it was, exactly, but I became aware that he had gone to Iraq to fight in the war and was killed in action. I read through a bunch of the comments and would occasionally, over the course of years, re read the page. I realized a while ago that it was gone. I don't know what happened to the page, maybe got deleted during MySpace's 47th reformat.  I wish I could've linked the page, but alas, I cannot."
matt,14qv90,SteamApunk,5,Wed Dec 12 21:38:37 2012 UTC,"This happened to me a little while ago. The guy who friended me was from California and I'm from Indiana. If this is the dude, I will shit bricks."
matt,14qv90,Wookapotamus,2,Wed Dec 12 21:25:58 2012 UTC,"Mulder? The guy I friended was from indiana....but I'm from idaho, not CA. Though I did spend a summer in CA in 2006...which maybe is when I sent that request."
matt,14qv90,Wookapotamus,3,Wed Dec 12 21:50:56 2012 UTC,Nah. Got excited there for a minute. That would have made my day.
matt,14qv90,major_majors,2,Wed Dec 12 21:53:24 2012 UTC,Dang! That would have been pretty epic.
matt,14qv90,totalrecarl,2,Wed Dec 12 21:54:35 2012 UTC,"I'm originally from Indiana and now I live in California. I'm reasonably sure it wasn't me, though."

matt,14qv90,The_Fjordster,5,Thu Dec 13 17:24:50 2012 UTC,"My name is so common, the very first day I joined Facebook in 2006, I was invited to ""The Matt _____ Group"".  There were over 100 members already."
matt,14qv90,Godimhigh,2,Wed Dec 12 22:43:23 2012 UTC,lol. Awesome...and disappointing at the same time.
matt,14qv90,Godimhigh,4,Wed Dec 12 23:44:21 2012 UTC,My name is rare...I am a lone Matt.
matt,14qv90,Slyvr89,2,Wed Dec 12 22:19:39 2012 UTC,"Ummmmmm....is that a good thing to put on reddit?  I will say, it's Danish."
matt,14qv90,mtreef2,4,Fri Dec 21 05:56:38 2012 UTC,"I added all the people with the same first/last name as me. I have about 14 Matt XXXX on my friend's list, and one of them shares a birthday with me."

matt,14qv90,mattamus,3,Wed Dec 12 22:50:56 2012 UTC,I ball hard.
matt,14qv90,SteamApunk,3,Wed Dec 12 23:44:51 2012 UTC,"Yeah, there's one in my same city that's just a few years older than me and also has a brother named Ben (I do too)"
matt,14qv90,DishoveledPanda,3,Wed Dec 12 23:48:57 2012 UTC,My name is Matt and I also have a brother named Ben.
matt,14qv90,mappum,3,Wed Dec 12 21:37:13 2012 UTC,"I had a guy from Australia friend me, then invite me to a group of Matt's with the same last name from around the world.  I didn't join.  Kind of reminded me of a cult or political party bent on world domination."
matt,14qv90,greatbawlsofire,4,Thu Dec 13 00:47:19 2012 UTC,"Oh jeez. I think I have the same name. Exactly the same thing happened to me, and I'm still friends with the guy."
matt,14qv90,noles602,2,Wed Dec 12 21:37:26 2012 UTC,But this. This is WAAAY different.
matt,14qv90,matthewsmithnl,3,Wed Dec 12 23:00:43 2012 UTC,"I used to play alot of PS3 with my friend, but then stopped and went to computer games. I texted him one day and got his skype, so he added me to a call. 3 people in the call. Matt Hayes, Matt Hayes, Christian xxx (Dont remember his name) Bricks were shat."
matt,14qv90,mappum,3,Wed Dec 12 21:39:19 2012 UTC,True Matts use vim.
matt,14qv90,Quate,2,Wed Dec 12 23:38:37 2012 UTC,Why? What was the harm? If they all accepted his request they were having fun with it. You've just broken up a clan of Matt's!  :O I say we banish you. You're now a Norman.
matt,14qv90,mattstache,2,Thu Dec 13 00:08:48 2012 UTC,Yeah - tons of Matts with my last name ><

matt,14qv90,Phibbonacci,1 point,Wed Dec 12 21:41:41 2012 UTC,Mine is not common...
matt,14qv90,Phibbonacci,2,Wed Dec 12 21:56:31 2012 UTC,"There was one that went to the same high school as me, but graduated the year before I got there...every teacher asked if we were related."
matt,14qv90,Matter1234,2,Wed Dec 12 21:55:45 2012 UTC,"I went to university with another Matt Smith.  He was an Electrical Engineering student, I was Ocean & Naval Architectural Engineering student.  The office use to always mix us up, I actually got one of his job offers once.  I did the right thing and rejected it, who wants to work with circuits...."
matt,14qv90,imperfectalien,2,Wed Dec 12 22:07:04 2012 UTC,"My name is Matt Bell, and apparently there are a lot of us. I can't go anywhere without finding someone who knows a different Matt Bell.  Also, I used to have an eye doctor named Matt Bell (mostly because of his name).  Also, some other Matt Bell on Twitter was finding all of the other Matt Bells and following them. #mattbell"
matt,14qv90,mingling4502,2,Wed Dec 12 21:44:54 2012 UTC,I'm one of the only American Matts with my last name. All the rest are British web designers.
matt,14qv90,mingling4502,2,Wed Dec 12 22:02:32 2012 UTC,I thought my name was pretty rare until I found another on FB around the same age. He seems to be completely unrelated. When we first friended each other (I can't remember which of us was the creep so it was probably me) we never spoke once. Every so often I would comment on one of his posts and confuse the crap out of people.
matt,14rhuu,buster2Xk,3,Thu Dec 13 02:49:11 2012 UTC,"Welcome, Matt! My name is Matt. You may call me Matt. Talk to Matt and he'll show you around. You should also get acquainted with Matt. Watch out for Matt though, he's a bit of a dick."

matt,decwa,hepafilter,1 point,Wed Sep 15 20:35:56 2010 UTC,I am half-bald.  It's awesome.  The friggin question of which hair-cut and so on: gone.  Just raze what's left from time to time and that's it.
