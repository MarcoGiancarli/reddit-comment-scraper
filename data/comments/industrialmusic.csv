industrialmusic,3e2ltz,C0CKPUNCHER,2,Tue Jul 21 20:54:59 2015 UTC,If you enjoy it check out Sophia.  Another great martial industrial project.  And delve into some death industrial.  Brighter Death Now is an intensely great death industrial project.

industrialmusic,3e2ltz,m80kamikaze,2,Tue Jul 21 21:38:43 2015 UTC,Good choice btw.  Fucking love ISN.
industrialmusic,3dtg01,Kmorrt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:50:15 2015 UTC,http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3398436/soundtrack?ref_=tt_trv_snd  Just on the off chance you haven't checked here.  Film worth seeing?
