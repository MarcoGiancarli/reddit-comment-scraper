husky,3dunz5,tuck1395,2,Mon Jul 20 01:49:15 2015 UTC,#1 - dress up in a hyena costume
husky,3dunz5,TheMagnificentJoe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:41:17 2015 UTC,They are just as cute though. But not as soft.

husky,3dqei6,harleyhusky,3,Sat Jul 18 13:04:15 2015 UTC,"Looks broken, have you tried unplugging and turning back on?"
husky,3dqei6,amazing_husky,2,Sat Jul 18 13:55:38 2015 UTC,Is the bowl designed so she has to eat slower? I've never seen that before. I think it's pretty interesting!
husky,3dqei6,OliviaStevens,3,Sun Jul 19 05:36:14 2015 UTC,"It is! We had a gulping problem when she was younger. She's much better now but when I got this bowl for her little sister (GSD/samoyed) she was jealous so I got her one too! They're not too expensive at petsmart, maybe 20$."
husky,3dqei6,OliviaStevens,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:51:51 2015 UTC,That's super cool! I'm glad they make bowls like that
husky,3dqei6,anna661591,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:15:29 2015 UTC,And here I am with a husky who refuses to eat out of a bowl. Food toys only! Sheesh
husky,3dqei6,kamadian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:27:10 2015 UTC,She does that occasionally. So I just put her food in a pile on the kennel floor. She noms it right up!
husky,3dsfs5,Odin_the_Husky,5,Sun Jul 19 00:36:22 2015 UTC,"We've gone through a lot of toys with our girls.  I hate squeaky toys so that limits what we've bought for them. But rope toys are their favorite. There's lots of different kinds of rope toys so you can get some that are easier to throw.   We also have gotten a bunch of tuffy toys.  The ones that are just shapes, like the circle, are better than the animal shaped ones.  There are squeakers in those but they're not terribly loud usually.  With any toy you need to make sure they aren't just sitting there chewing on them for long periods of time.  That was usually our biggest problem when they destroyed toys.  We got them some nylabones for them to chew on and then we just play with the ropes and stuff.  Our girls, when they aren't destroying things http://imgur.com/a/8E4kv"
husky,3dsfs5,spartyon7,6,Sun Jul 19 00:55:31 2015 UTC,"A lot of the toys they ignore but the one that generally held up the longest was the sofa, last a few weeks..."
husky,3dsfs5,SimonReach,2,Sun Jul 19 07:19:34 2015 UTC,"After lots of money spent on my boy and lots of stuffing to clean up with the toys claiming to be indestructable, i found just generic toys like ropes, thick rubber balls and rubber ""tire"" toys have lasted the longest. His favorite lately has been fresh branches off my tree, he likes to hang on them and swing until they snap. Best of luck!"
husky,3dsfs5,The_Twiggler,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:39:36 2015 UTC,How about a log!    Simple and easy to replace.
husky,3dsfs5,spinwizard69,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:28:15 2015 UTC,My husky won't play with dog toys. He LOVES cat toys though. I bought him a pull rope and he didn't even pay attention to it. My cat got a mouse with a bell on it? Destroyed by the dog. But I found out he loves natural fur like rabbit. Some stores sell rabbit pelts and some bait stores sell deer tails for making flies. My dog loves them and they last quite a while.
