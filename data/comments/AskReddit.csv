AskReddit,3e2iyf,Isares,334,Tue Jul 21 15:14:15 2015 UTC,"First the grape must be peeled, very slowly, and carefully keeping it in one piece. Set the skin aside and let it dry out slightly. Then gently massage the peeled grape all over and squeeze out the juice into a pure lead crystal goblet - it has to be lead crystal! Discard the seed. Then cut the dried skin with a very sharp knife into tiny little strips. Cut again in a perpendicular fashion until the skin is now small squares. Sprinkle over the squeezed juice in the goblet. Add a double shot of any liquor of your choice. Drink the mixture. By this point you will have forgotten what you intended to do with the grape, and you can remain free from incarceration."

The vibe of the theater was ""fuck this POS movie"".  So we all collectively started a commentary to the movie.  People were yelling out shit at the screen.

A negotiated end to the Vietnam War was in sight, and Johnson was intent on securing his legacy by defusing the war issue.   Richard Nixon was the Republican candidate. He was terrified of losing the war as an election issue - to the point that he sent advisers to tell the South Vietnamese government to back out of the talks, and he'd get them a better deal as president.   He sabotaged U.S. diplomacy and got thousands of soldiers killed - he committed treason - in order to secure his election. And it worked.

AskReddit,3e2f09,Khourieat,12,Tue Jul 21 13:41:14 2015 UTC,"My favorite will always be Legato in Trigun.  Basically, the protagonist in the show never kills anyone, and even hurting a bad guy goes against his code. He basically tries to resolve all conflicts peacefully, but frequently things get out of hand. He doesn't even like harming insects! If he HAS to hurt someone, he always guarantees a non-lethal shot.  Legato uses this against him. Kidnaps his friends, and then gives the protagonist two easy choices: A- The protagonist can kill Legato, and save his friends B- The protagonist can watch his friends die.  From the viewers perspective, this is a super simple thing. But if you take the time to get into the protagonists head, the bad guy won 100%. He eventually chooses A, but it messes him up pretty bad. It's an excellent sequence."

His scream of utter agony when he flashes back to killing Legato and going against his no-killing code is heartbreaking.  It's literally difficult to listen to because you can just hear his guilt and anguish.  And we're led to believe that Vash does this several times - it takes him quite some time to come to terms with the fact that sometimes he's going to have to kill people.  Legato was a goddamn genius, willing to die (essentially killing himself) in order to completely break the will of the protagonist."
AskReddit,3e2f09,Aurumsloth,39,Tue Jul 21 17:20:47 2015 UTC,"Easy one. My favourite villain of all time, Slade, from the Teen Titans cartoon.   Not only does he win once, but he wins again, and then technically wins a third time. But I'm going to focus on the first victory because it's the most memorable.   The first time he wins, he dies. Sounds kind of counter-intuitive to being with, but he's one of very few villains to achieve victory in death. Before he died, he programmed the mask he wore to pump out a mind-altering gas whenever it was tampered with. Robin, not being aware of this, fiddles with the mask in their evidence locker in the basement of the tower.   This leads to an entire episode of Slade antagonizing Robin, and the rest of the team through proxy, while being dead. They eventually figure out what's going on sure, but even though he fucking died, he still gets the last punch in. You kind of have to see the episode to understand it, but the psychological torture Robin goes through trying to make sense of what's happening and convince the rest of the team that Slade's alive is crazy. Really top tier stuff.   He also comes back to life by making a deal with a demon, manipulates Robin into joining him, manipulates Terra into joining him, ends up with sick fire powers, and slips away after the demon is defeated therefore breaking free of his control and, again, winning.   Slade is fucking awesome."

This doesn't really follow when examining how modern groups hostile to the existing hegemon are described.  There is little evidence that the Rebel Alliance actually conducts terrorism in the sense of attempting to cause fear in the general population in order to enact political change.  Most violent operations we are aware of are against government and military entities, with the notable exception of the Jabba the Hutt incident, which was a violent confrontation with a criminal organization caused by a botched rescue attempt.  The Rebel Alliance would be more likely described as ""Insurgents"", ""Separatists"", ""Rebels"", ""Anarchists"", or ""Insurectionists"" outside of what were revealed to be false - flag attacks on places like Alderaan.  Rooting for the Rebels in the movies is in no way congruent to rooting for terrorists."

Naturally, we thought it would be a good idea to roommate at my place to cut down on expense. Little did I know, he was one of those drinkers that black out and destroy everything. Each day after work was him with a case of beer and getting in arguments with kids in Yahoo chat rooms over a mic until he would pass out.   It escalated. He quit going to work and I'd come home with him passed out, vomit all over the floors, piss in the corners, half-eaten pizza face down on the couch, the works. I started telling him he needed to leave but he wasn't hearing it. Eventually he got arrested for something and ended up in jail. I was free. For a while. He got out and I woke to banging on my door. I didn't let him in. (His mom collected all his things when he got locked up)  Fast forward to recently, I'd been overseas for 6 years and moved back to my home state afterward, and recently stumbled across his Facebook page after not having seen or heard from him in 13 years.

Before her roommate had left to go to a party, she had placed her white mac laptop on her chair by her desk. The rationale here, is that we believe the white from the laptop on the seat made the chair look like a porcelain load-throne in the mind of her drunken roommate. So she approaches the chair, pulls down her pants, and sits on her laptop. My friend braces herself because this situation can only go one way. As she braced for impact, her roommate releases a sigh of relief that unfortunately is synchronized with the release of her bladder and bowels. Despite her laptop being covered in piss and shit, her roommate denies that this ever happened.  TL;DR roommate drunkenly covers laptop in piss and shit"

AskReddit,3e2p3v,hi_meh_heh,245,Tue Jul 21 14:58:52 2015 UTC,"Dude.  A friend of mine's male roommate did the same fucking thing.  It was freshman year and we were all forced to live in the dorms.  So we had one room, two beds, two desks, and an ensuite bathroom with the room next door.  He came home drunk as FUCK, tried to crawl into bed and cuddle with him, only to be kicked out.  My buddy fell asleep and woke up the next morning with his roommate sprawled on the floor, completely fucking naked.  He gets up to go take a piss and sees his brand new macbook pro in the bathtub.  Completely covered in fucking piss.  Turns out his roommate got pissed off when he wouldn't fucking snuggle and pissed on his laptop.  Needless to say, his insurance/warranty didn't cover destruction by piss, and the roommate had to pay for it.  TL;DR Friend wakes up to take a piss and finds his macbook pro covered in piss from his pissed off, piss drunk roommate and gets pissed the fuck off.  Also, Apple warranty doesn't cover piss. piss."

AskReddit,3e2p3v,accentmarkd,21,Tue Jul 21 17:16:19 2015 UTC,This is really important to me now
AskReddit,3e2p3v,JessBroBabe,58,Tue Jul 21 16:47:07 2015 UTC,"Apparently I'm bad at summarizing stories so this is super long but I need to get it out there and off my chest.  Well, speaking of shit, I have a couple stories for you courtesy my shitty roommate, nicknamed ""poopy plunger,"" for the following reasons:   She clogged the upstairs toilet one day, and didn't tell anyone. My other roommate (M) found out when she was upstairs cooking and happened to need to use the washroom. Fortunately M's boyfriend unclogged it for us. Unfortunately, he didn't want to clean the mess up (and I mean, it wasn't really his problem so M wasn't going to make him). M started cleaning it but had texted me just before. When I saw the text, I went upstairs. She cleaned half of it and I cleaned the poopy plunger with lots of bleach and hot water. I woke up one morning and noticed the downstairs bathroom's (which is the one we all usually use, since it's by the bedrooms) toilet was looking a little low on water in the bowl. Figured it was clogged and didn't feel like dealing with it them (BIIIIIG mistake) so I used the upstairs bathroom and went back to bed. Well poopy plunger decided she was going to use the washroom (I would like to give her the benefit of the doubt here, about knowing to not use the toilet but she blew that months ago at this point). I heard her enter the washroom and the toilet seat lift up. I thought to myself ""don't fucking do it, poopy plunger."" But she fucking did. Like, JFC, I was so mad. I texted M letting her know what happened. But, to make matters worse, poopy plunger had a friend staying over! And guess who ELSE DECIDED TO USE THE FUCKING TOILET. Poopy plunger's partner in poopy crime.  I had to get up and check to see that it was in fact clogged and Jesus, I damn near threw up from that sight. It was so, so, so gross. Like there was just poop, TP and no water whatsoever in that bowl. I'm going to tell you now that poopy plunger uses exactly too fucking much toilet paper. It got to the point where M and I would just bring the TP with us so we wouldn't have to have poopy plunger waste our nice, soft, and fluffy TP. A plunger was going to do no use in this situation but I have to explain this to you. Anyways, M was out while all this was happening and I was relaying it to her via text. When she got home (not knowing that poopy plunger was home) she ran downstairs and made a nasty comment about how gross it was and that poopy plunger was going to clean it up. M put the plunger in the bathroom for poopy plunger, how nice of her eh?  But here's the kicker, we have two plungers, one that is more for a sink clog (M's boyfriend clogged the upstairs bathroom once before and it was an emergency and that's the only plunger the grocery store had, they eventually bought a better one a few days later, so toilet was dealt with correctly). We also have one that's for a toilet but has these little ribs in it to create a vacuum and suck the clog up I guess? I'm not sure how it works. But poopy plunger uses the wrong fucking plunger and just gave up on unclogging it. So M put the right plunger (but you still pretty much have to unclog it by hand (gag)) on top of the closed toilet lid in hopes of poopy plunger actually cleaning the mess up. Eventually she did, but left both plungers-which were covered in poop- sitting on the bathroom floor. I just about fucking lost it on this cunt. I caved and washed both plungers plus the whole bathroom because that poop and poopy water was probably everywhere.   This is probably the worst of the stories for this roommate. I've had other awful roommates but they were mostly just awful humans in the behaviour department and unnecessarily loud. Poopy plunger is also my most recent roommate and it was just an accumulation of small things she did that absolutely made me hate her. We never actually did anything to her directly (no pay back or anything) but apparently my nickname was ""the bitch"" for whatever reason. Maybe because I told her to do her friggen dishes before she leaves for a weekend?? And I called her out on leaving her two ""best friends"" alone in our house so M and I hung out with them while she went to a party with her new ""university friends."" Idk, maybe I am a bitch?  TL;DR - Roommate is shitty in both the literal and figurative sense. Enjoys: making me clean up her shit.  Edit: added TL;DR, also extra detail I forgot from story 2: there was also a toilet cleaning brush that she used to try and unclog the toilet I assume? She doesn't clean so that's a far fetched assumption for her to use it as it is intended. Anyways I found it when I went to clean the toilet next (a couple weeks later I think, M and I are civilized humans and don't make nasty messes like poopy plunger, we clean up as we go). She had hidden it behind the toilet. It had poop and TP still stuck to it. My God. I wanted to scream. I just about did, poopy plunger was home and it would have been nice to rip on her but I'm not that big of a bitch. I cleaned it but M said I should have just thrown it out, but oh well it was done and over with."
AskReddit,3e2p3v,pronto285,349,Tue Jul 21 19:05:09 2015 UTC,"The worst story i have is just really creepy. She was a great roommate but i couldn't sleep right for a month after.   So it's literally the first night we are sleeping in the same room, so things are already a little awkward since we only know each other's names. But night falls and we go to sleep. I wake up to the sound of her yelling ""NO NO NO NO NOOOOOOOOOOOOO"" and then she flings all of her blankets off of her bed and onto the floor. At this point I'm freaked out so i ask if she's okay and she doesn't reply. Instead she sits up and looks around, sees the window and kind of whispers ""not the window..."" then she stands up and walks to the window. At this point i realize she must be sleep walking, or crazy. She gets to the window grabs the lock with both hands and is locking and unlocking the window over and over again while whispering to herself. She never opened it, but after about 3 minutes of that she let's go and says ""that'll do"". And then starts walking back to her bed, but when she was passing by my bed she stopped and turned to face me. Then she just stood there sleep (i hope) staring at me for a good 2 minutes. Then she started whispering to herself again walked passed her bed to the door, dragged her hand down the middle of it, turned around and walked to her bed and went back to sleep.   I was terrified, but i never told her about it. She never did it again.   Edit: spelling"
AskReddit,3e2p3v,Magical_T-Rex,49,Tue Jul 21 16:26:26 2015 UTC,"One of my dear friends has night terrors.  The first night that I met her at a big group gathering (at the time she was a friend of a friend who thought we'd like each other and was bringing her alone to introduce us) she fell asleep before the end of the party and we couldn't wake her up.  Whatever, she's crashing here now.  All's well, until about 2 am...when she starts ""screaming.""   It's clearly something she's adapted to after years of having night terrors...she screams and screams and screams her head off, but in a whisper.  It was horrifying.  And once she's asleep it's impossible to wake her up.  So she just whisper screamed her lungs out for an hour or so, frozen completely still and then went back to bed.  She's slept over a few times and it's horrifying every time.  It's more creepy because they're so quiet"
AskReddit,3e2p3v,JessBroBabe,19,Tue Jul 21 18:19:24 2015 UTC,That is terrifying! Night terrors are one thing I am so glad I've never experienced

AskReddit,3e2p3v,petrilstatusfull,37,Tue Jul 21 17:43:42 2015 UTC,"I did something similar once. My ex was crashing at my place one night. It was midterms so I was stressed out. This is also the point in my life when I was experiencing REALLY bad night terrors. If you've never had a night terror, your lucky. They look, sounds, and FEEL as real as day. This one was particularly bad.   I was in my back yard because I heard some strange sounds and went to check it out. It was black. The only light was coming from my back left, it was my neighbors driveway light. He always left it on. Beyond what the light showed was only black. When all of the sudden bright blue eyes started popping up. First 1 then 3 then 5. I quickly turned and ran into the house, hearing horrifying-glass-breaking screams from behind me.   As burst through the door. I woke up in my bed. I glanced around to the front of my bed to see blue eyes staring back at me. It stood up and slowly made its way to my side of the bed and sat 1 foot from my face, breathing, I could see sharp white teeth with long hair and dark bumpy skin. I couldn't move, I was experiencing sleep paralysis, which I wasn't new to me but this was bad. I screamed for help as it niched toward my face but I couldn't open my mouth, the sound was almost completely muffled. It's eyes were in a dead stair with an open mouth smile. With every once of energy and strength, I tried to move but, nothing. Finally after what seemed like 2 minutes I started to feel my body move. I desperately started to yell; first starting as a mumble as I couldn't open my mouth. The blue eyes still staring at me, seemingly getting closer. Then I felt my body rock side to side and I screamed louder, still only a mumble. Then, snap, I broke free! The eyes vanished and my arms shot up to defend myself and in the process I hit my ex in the head, pretty hard. She was apparently trying to wake me up, but I couldn't tell she was there. She said it was weird, she could tell my eyes were open and I was making noises but I wasn't moving or acknowledging she was there.   She wasn't happy, but I explained to her what happened. She was very comforting. That relationship didn't last long, she wanted more commitment and I was a young and stupid college kid. We're still friends. She's still pretty awesome.   TL;DR - Had a night terror, when I finally snapped out of it my ex was trying to wake me up and I punched her in the head."

The kind of notes with overly-polite language, underlines, and randomly capitalized words. Always written in red marker. Always rude enough to get the shit beaten out of her. Always signed from both of us.    I spent that year following her around and removing the notes as quickly and quietly as possible."
AskReddit,3e2p3v,MonsieurLeFabre,212,Tue Jul 21 15:22:24 2015 UTC,"I've done that, left a passive-aggressive note on someone's car parked in the apartment complex I used to live in. There was no assigned parking for tenants and guests, and this person took up two spots with their parking. I had to park pretty damn far away and I was pissed, so I left a note on their car. Then some asshole in a red car hit my black car leaving a hole in both my doors, they didn't leave their insurance information so I had to pay over $1000 out of pocket. I fucking hate apartments and will never live in one again unless it has a parking garage with assigned parking."
AskReddit,3e2p3v,lightswontbeblinding,46,Tue Jul 21 16:36:20 2015 UTC,"I've lived in apartment buildings for years, and my secret is to request (or just take) a generally inconvenient or out-of-the-way parking spot.  I usually shoot for corner spots in garages or lots.  Minimal traffic anywhere near your car, nobody's going to steal your spot, and if someone hits your car, there are usually only one or two suspects because nobody other than people assigned to park near you has any reason to be driving near your car."

Everyone else had to park at the end of the parking lot. Our neighbor would constantly have no one over and park in our visitor spot. We asked her nicely, left notes, complained to management, nothing would stop her. We finally started parking in our visitor spot. But as soon as we would leave she would move her car."

Repairs were $800 and under my deductible so I never fixed it. I paid for a carport then this asshole kept parking there.   I left post it notes on his car and then one day when I got home early I caught him parking in my spot and told him this is my parking spot and he needs to stop parking there. ""Oh it's just a pickup. I'll be right out"". ""Motherfucker I pay $35 a month to have this spot and you keep parking here. GTFO!"". ""It's just a pickup. Why are you so angry? I'll be right out!""

But they aren't passive aggressive. Thought one was just plain aggressive. My boyfriend and her both leave trash on the counter BESIDE the trashcan instead of throwing it away so I left a note on the counter that said 'This isn't the trashcan! Don't be lazy!' I'm not proud of that one.
AskReddit,3e2p3v,ambersayamber,142,Tue Jul 21 15:28:06 2015 UTC,"I also felt like a dick writing notes to my former housemate, but like you, had no choice - he paid rent and had a room in our house but spent all of his time at his girlfriend's. He would come to ""our"" home to cook his meals (which were one of three options every time - chicken tenders, plain pasta, or frozen pizzas) and then would leave the washing up undone in the sink or his bedroom, once to the point (while I wasn't there to tidy up after him) where the metal tray eroded the sink.   I cannot tell you how many times I had to wrestle his door open, climb through piles of damp, sweaty, rugby gear, rescue whatever cutlery that had amassed there, and then spend hours scrubbing the caked on dried chocolate milkshake from our glasses. None of this, I felt, deserved a passive aggressive note, other than one above the sink that said ""Please do your washing up!"".   However. When he bought food and left it in his cupboard to ROT and MOULD and STINK, I finally reached the end of my tether. I cannot abide unnecessary food waste. The note on his cupboard read along the lines of ""Something in here is fucked to the point where I WILL NOT clean it for you. This needs immediate attention and if it happens again I will remove the offending item and place it in your bed."" He texted a half-arsed apology the next day, explaining that he had bought and consumed half a child's birthday cake and then left the rest to decay. Two months later, when we realised he had left a Maccies cup half full of chocolate shake on the kitchen counter, I did put it in his bedroom. He stopped coming home at all, until after I had moved out.  Sorry this is so long! I guess still feel some resentment.

I do believe he doesn't remember though. He got laid off after getting a dui. Proceeded to drink himself stupid for eight months and was eventually taking our rent money to pay his car bill. Didn't realize til we had an eviction notice. Forced him to get his parents to pay for our three months of rent he didn't pay but I still have an eviction on my record.

AskReddit,3e2p3v,soMuchToFind,191,Tue Jul 21 20:06:13 2015 UTC,"Well here is my ex roommate story... Dated a girl for awhile, she moved in and we ended up breaking up. I let her stay and move into one of the upstairs bedrooms because I made the mistake of feeling sorry for her. Fast forward a few years (yes, I'm a huge pushover and way too forgiving of people. I think she finally broke me of that.) And I finally had to kick her ass out. It started small over the years, with her just being a general slob. However... She had the upstairs of the house more or less to herself. Large bedroom, her own full bathroom, nobody ever went up there to bother her. She also had a pet rabbit. I liked rabbits, they're cute and adorable... The rabbit however was not taken care of. She went back to Arizona for Christmas to visit family and asked me to watch the rabbit. Sure no problem... I go up to check on the rabbit, give it food, water, clean cage, etc, and the upstairs looks like a crack house. There is trash everywhere, just piles of dirty dishes and food wrappers just general trash. The bathroom looked like it had never been cleaned at all. Just layers upon layers of makeup residue and hair and trash. Ugh. And worse, the rabbits cage was this tiny thing designed for small rabbits and was too small for this one since she never let the rabbit out of the cage. And the entire cage was filled with rabbit crap. The nails on the rabbit were long enough you knew they hadn't been taken care of in awhile. I was horrified. But, me being stupid, didn't immediately pick up a phone and bitch her out and tell her to keep her bags packed when she got back... No, I was stupid. I cleaned up upstairs, went out, built the rabbit a new much larger cage and took care of it. When she got back I told her flat out it wouldn't happen again.   Fast forward a few months and the rabbit is put for being sick. She starts posting on Facebook about how sad she was, etc. I sat there thinking, bitch, you didn't take care of it, why are you sad. I even offered to help her take the rabbit cage down after it happened. She declined.   Fast forward again and I'm wondering why all of a sudden the house is crawling with bugs. I start seeing ants and roaches in larger and larger numbers. Not cool. Then I start noticing an odor in the house, something rotten. I'm thinking something got in one of the attics and died. A squirrel or a mouse or something and that's what's caused this. So I venture upstairs and check one attic. Nothing. So I go to check the other side which is accessible from the roommates closet. I open the door and the room is once again a disaster area. Everything from blackened shriveled banana peels to fast food bags to piles of dirty dishes and clothes. And bugs crawling over it. I, understandably, was a bit upset. Even the rabbits cage was still there. Still filled with rabbit shit. I was confident she hasn't changed the litter from when she got back after Christmas to when the rabbit died. I told her flat or she needed to clean her room now today this instant because I wasn't going to have the upstairs of my house become a garbage dump. She wasn't exactly happy with me but I didn't give a fuck at that point. I stormed out and left for a bit before I snapped and did something I would really regret.   So, being my dumb self, I assumed that given the situation and context that the upstairs would then be cleaned. That I got the point across. So I go upstairs a few weeks later to change the air filter in the ac system and lo and behold, the room is not only still filled with the exact same shit it was before, there is new trash!  I'm done at this point, I'm livid. I tell her when she gets home to clean the upstairs pack her bags and get out by the end of the week. She gives me a song and dance and sob story and all about how it will never happen again. You're right, it won't, you're not staying here.   No one should be surprised when they find out I still ended up having up clean the upstairs. The carpet was a loss and the entire house had to be fumigated. I even had to repaint the walls to cover stains since nothing would get them off. I took pictures. There are episodes of hoarders that looked cleaner."

AskReddit,3e2p3v,TinyBahamut,103,Tue Jul 21 19:00:20 2015 UTC,"My freshman year, I had a crazy roommate. He was a bigger guy with a pornstache who thought all the women around him desired him. He tried very hard to make people like him, and failed miserably. He also had some shitty roommate habits. For example, he would set multiple alarms in the morning and not wake up when they went off, which forced me to get up and wake him up every time (it was a college dorm where we slept in the same room). He would also drive like 80 MPH on residential roads to to try and impress people.   Anyway. After 4 weeks of creeping everyone out in the hall and alienating himself, someone took his iPad as a joke. He freaked out and threatened multiple people, saying he would hack their computers and destroy their lives. Eventually someone told him his iPad was in one of my friend's rooms. He went inside, grabbed the guy, put a knife to his throat, and asked him where the iPad was. The cops came and he was expelled. But after that I didn't have to share my room the rest of the year, so that was cool."

Did that work? lol no  Everyone hated her new boyfriend but I was the only one that flat out told her she was being used and she should get out. I became Enemy #1, as suddenly everyone else was so supportive of her relationship. They plotted ways to get back at me. I actually overheard them saying what they were going to do around the apartment to piss me off.  Jokes on her. They're divorced now, and one of the others in a spiraling-to-hell relationship.

She told me that the dishwasher was broken, and that she just kept her dishes in it so she could use the cabinet space for more food. Ok, never questioned it.

AskReddit,3e2p3v,FPSRadar,86,Tue Jul 21 16:48:30 2015 UTC,"I lived with a roommate who was a complete and total narcissist. It was a $1500/mo apartment (three bedroom in a nice part of town) that should have been $500 a person, but he was a lazy shit and maybe contributed ~$150 of that. His dumb twat girlfriend wasn't much better, contributing about the same amount per month but she was at least more pleasant to talk to.  I lived with them for about six months and paid the $1200 I was paying to cover the rent because I didn't want my credit to take the hit that would result from an eviction.  The whole time they were going out to eat and wining and dining each other; meanwhile I never could do anything because I was burning up all my cash just trying to cover the rent.  Of course I would talk to the dude to say ""man, this can't continue, it's stressing me the fuck out, I can't afford to buy food most of the time"" but since he was a piece of shit narcissist, he would turn the argument around to somehow make it about how ungrateful a person I was.  The end finally came when I spoke with the leasing office people and explained that while I loved the apartment, I was the only one who was really giving the property managers any real money and the situation was untenable. I also said I would love to continue doing business with them (possibly with a smaller apartment), but I was locked into my lease and couldn't afford to pay an early termination fee because these assholes I lived with were sucking me dry.  They looked up the paperwork and said ""well it looks like only [piece of shit] filled out lease paperwork so you have no legal obligation to pay the rent.""  ""Is that so?"" I responded. I thought for a few moments and then said to the agent ""you should probably get eviction paperwork ready for next month. I have no intention of continuing to fund their lavish lifestyle. What other units do you have?""  I went back to the apartment and began packing. One day they came home to see that my bedroom was empty and my car was gone. They started packing like crazy for three days, having to throw a lot of it away because they were going to get locked out before they could get it all. On the second day, the power was turned off, because it was in my name at the old apartment and now that I had my own place I wasn't about to pay for the power in two different places.  So they had to frantically pack, in the sweltering July heat in total darkness. Fuck those people."
AskReddit,3e2p3v,thebloodofthematador,122,Tue Jul 21 17:06:13 2015 UTC,"First year of college. My two roommates got a major kick out of yelling weird shit down at people as they walked by our top floor dorm. It was usually pretty harmless, if probably pretty annoying/confusing for the people on the receiving end. Anyway, as guilty as I was of laughing about it, I never participated, and did a lot of eye rolling at them.   One day they were doing this, and I went to take a shower. When I got back the dorm was empty. Didn't think anything of it, must have grabbed lunch.  Soon there is a knock on the door. Still in my towel I open the door, expecting the roommates or friends from down the hall. Nope. Four enormous, hugely pissed off black guys.  Wonderful.  They want to know who has something to say. Who's got the big balls now, say that shit to their face.  Oh god they didn't....  Yep they did.   So now I'm a 150lb white dude in a towel, and these four dudes have been basically hate-crimed. I swear up and down I didn't do it, that I wouldn't do that, and that they're more than welcome to hang out until my roommates got back, who will surely offer them the apology they're entitled to.  But they were too pissed. They called me everything. Didn't believe me at all. Said I was hiding in the shower and all this. I've never felt so shitty in my life.  And nothing ever happened. I cussed my roommates out huge, but that was it. One of the black dudes saw me later in the year and, sort of condescendingly I think, gave me a ""last chance"" to be the bigger man and confess. I told him again it wasn't me, that it was the roommates. I put my hand out for a shake, but he declined and made fun of me about hiding in the shower again.  Still bummed it happened."

He then jumps on my bed and makes humping motions and whatnot in my direction.  I am just thinking wtf and laughing it off, but the  n he jumps up and ends up sort of sitting on my knees with his butt towards  me(I a m laying on my back with me feet flat on the bed). He begins to move his butt around and his boxers come down.  At this point I feel the line has been crossed and I'm not super intent on man handling this dude to get him off me.  The first thing that popped into my head was ""Oh,  I have germx hand sanitizer on my night stand""  so I reach over grab the bottle,  take aim right at his buttcrack/butthole and slam my hand on the dispenser.  A stream leaves the bottle and is right on target. He jumps up screaming asking what that was and runs to the shower screaming that it burns...i never had to deal with any situation like that again.

It was a dry campus, and she would drink all the time in the dorm and leave bottles and cans all over the place.  I drank too, but I at least had the common sense to hide the bottles!  She'd come back from sorority parties trashed off her ass and expected me to take care of her.  It came to a head when I went back home for the weekend, and when I got back she had put a leaky McDondald's cup on my brand new laptop.  Who knows how long it had been sitting there.  I told her I was going down to the student life office to see about getting my own dorm.  It was worth the extra fee to live alone.  Luckily there was an empty dorm on the same floor I had been on and was able to move there.  I went back to my dorm to start packing up, and the cunt had already moved all of my stuff out into the hallway!  I hadn't even told her I was able to move out yet!

He would set his alarm clock to ring every half hour from 4AM to 9AM.  And it would play through his iHome speakers, and of course it would be that one that sounds like my head is inside of a clock tower bell.  Especially after staying up late to party the night before.  He would watch anime porn, but instead of jerking it, he would just laugh super loud.  Thankfully, he always had his headphones in when he did this.  And, if I'm being honest, I always thought this was kind of funny, but it definitely scared off a few chicks I was trying to get with while we would pre-game before a night out.  We only had one cord for the cable in our dorm, and every time I asked him if I could use the cable on my TV he would say no with much hostility.  Even if he wasn't planning on using it.  So I'd ask if I could just use his TV to watch cable and would be again met with a hostile, ""NO!""  EDIT:  I forgot about this, but one time he went through my shit because he ""thought he smelled something rotten"" only to find my weed stash.  He then reported it to our RA.  Luckily, I knew the RA from my hometown, so I got the benefit of the doubt (and my weed back).  But after that happened I was just like, ""Da fuq?""  I can only think of two occasions where he was kind of chill.  One time, he let me have a couple glasses of Crown Royal on the rocks (which is like a total jackpot when you're in college and used to crushing $10 handles of liquor).  The other time was when he was using the stove top in the common room to make himself a burger, he offered to make me one, so I was like, ""Hell yeah!"" because I he was, from what I saw every day, a excellent cook.  Right after he hands me my burger, before I could even ask if he had any ketchup the fire alarm went off and the whole dorm had to be evacuated.  Everyone was so pissed because it was like 10PM on a weekday.  In the crowd outside I heard everyone asking, ""WHO THE FUCK CAUSED THIS?  I'LL KILL THEM!""  So instead of telling everyone it was my roommate cooking my food that made it happen, I just quietly snuck off to the student center so I could put some ketchup on my burger."

This guy would literally sit on the couch in the living room all day watching TV, playing on his computer, and listening to his god awful music with the biggest headphones (All at the same time. Yes.). On top of that, he just left his dishes, bowls, and utensils around after he finished eating in the living room, so my friends and I never hung around there. If my friends even bothered to come, we'd just hang around a little bit in the bedroom before heading out.  Oh, did I mention the bathroom? No? Well this guy barely used the bathroom. And when he did, oh dear Lord. He would take 50-70 minutes taking the shower (God knows what he was doing since the smell of him didn't improve whatsoever afterwards; it would sometimes get worse), and if he took a shit? I literally went in the first time afterwards and threw up. That was when I was moving in, and I didn't want to embarrass my parents and friend who were helping me move the furnitures. So when they asked what was wrong, I didn't want to point fingers at my roommate on our first day, so I just lied.   And when this motherfucker sleeps. He takes off his shirt and exposes the smell of death, which will squeeze and suffocate your nose. It's so hard to sleep. On top of that, he snores. Actually, I'm not even sure if that's snoring. It sounds like someone's choking him by stuffing Hot Cheetos down his throat but he's satisfied with that and just eats all of that shit up. I literally had to invest in some earplugs.  Oh, and I'm pretty sure he killed my pet turtle."
AskReddit,3e2p3v,paranoidpikachu,30,Tue Jul 21 16:14:28 2015 UTC,"I lost the random roommate lottery freshman year of college. She was a foreign exchange student from China, and we had NOTHING even remotely in common. Here's a list of my favorite things she did to me.  •She would wash her clothes in the sink, not the washing machine downstairs. She would hang the clothes up to dry, even on my side of the room. I finally convinced her that she couldn't hang her wet clothes on my TV. I came home one afternoon and she had hung a wet dress over my closet door. It was soaking, and had ruined all my pictures from home. She came back to me crying on the floor and she patted my shoulder and said ""it OK. It only photos.""  •She liked the room hot. Not warm, HOT. She would turn the thermostat up to 85°. I tried to talk to her over and over about a compromise, but finally I got fed up. I ended up opening the window when it was 15° outside. We both got sick as shit, but at least I wasn't so fucking hot.  •She told me I had to take my room decorations down. The bedroom should be a peaceful place and my pictures of home were too busy.  •She hated my boyfriend. He would come over, and we'd sit on my bed and play Xbox. When she would come back from class and see him there, she'd take all her clothes off, turn the lights off, and go to bed. Didn't matter if it was 3pm or 9pm.  •Instead of talking to me about my boyfriend, she told the RA I was bullying her.  •She would blow dry her hair while I was doing homework. In the room. Using the plug next to me.  •She refused to take medicine for things. I get that it was her culture, but she would lie on the bed and scream (literally) from menstrual cramps. Didn't matter if it was 4 am the night before finals. She was screaming and chewing on a ginger root.  Sorry for the wall of text. She was evil."

She originally wanted to rent with her friend but unfortunately her friend pulled out of the university course at the local university they were attending together, so she ended up having to find somewhere to rent alone. She ended up renting a room in a house share with 4 other guys (also students). After the first week she informed them she was going to the shop and they asked her to pick up some toilet tissue for the house. Unfortunately she forgot and they were pretty upset about it.   So the next day, after being out of the house all day she came home to find her bedroom walls and bed sheets smeared in shit.

AskReddit,3e2p3v,Universal-Cereal-Bus,23,Tue Jul 21 16:45:19 2015 UTC,"Before I start i'd like to say that this all took place within a 1 month time period  In 2010 I needed to get a roommate as the other one was moving out. I was in my last year of my masters program so I wasn't home for most of the day. Found someone off kijiji who was starting college. He seemed like an ok person when I met him but that's where it ended. First red flag, he was late on his very first rent payment of $430. He decided to make a bong and spray paint it in the basement instead of outside. Now there's spray paint on the walls and floor. He would throw huge parties of 80+ people when I wasn't there 3-4 times/week. Most of them I suspect were underage. I had the neighbors yelling at me 5 times a week because of his parties/dual subs in his shitbox car. He somehow managed to crack a floor tile and punch a huge hole in the wall. I would constantly come home to him not being there, but 10 of his friends are there ""chilling"". He managed to break a window. The cops were called to our house a total of 8 times. I had $2500 worth of stuff stolen from me from his parties including my laptop that I was doing my research on. Luckily i had backed it up the week before so not too much was lost. Out of all the xbox360 games I had, only one game was stolen: Call of Duty 4. But what really pissed me off the most is when one day i found my razor/shaving cream in the bathroom which I usually keep in my room. The guy had a fucking beard so god knows how long he'd been shaving his nuts with my razor. Razor blades are fucking expensive man, buy your own. He also stole my glasses and tire iron from my car. Seriously, who steals a fucking tire iron. I had enough and moved out knowing full well that he couldn't afford the $1300 rent alone. He moved out 6 days after me. I ended up moving into a friends house that was smaller than the one moved out of and also had 6 other people living there. It was actually pretty enjoyable"

She insisted on doing the dishes every night, but would only use 1 drop of soap for the entire load. It got to the point where it became habit to pull ""clean"" dishes out of the cabinet and quickly wash it before we could use it.   I also had pet frogs that summer. Frogs that like temperature control. Well this frugal roommate went on a rampage during the hottest week of the summer and tried to ban us from using the air conditioning to save money. We would all fight back and turn it on when she wasn't home. After a few weeks of this, one of our other roommates did some research. Turns out, the breed of frog I had likes to get frisky when their environment gets too warm. So we all agreed to let her control the a/c for awhile. We also moved the frogs to a more prominent location.   About 2 days in, little miss conservative walked in to see the nicely displayed frogs humping each other to no end. She screamed, demanded to know why we were letting this happen. We told her about the research and that if she wanted it to stop, then let us have air conditioning. We spent the rest of the summer in air conditioned bliss. The weird thing is that she was pretty well off, so we don't know why she was so cheap.  Tl;dr  humping frogs brought air conditioning back."

AskReddit,3e2p3v,mfwater,39,Tue Jul 21 14:56:07 2015 UTC,"Oh god, this just happened to me the other day.   I am a girl, and I live with a girl, so you'd think our apartment would be fairly clean, right? Nope. My roommate is a huge slob, but it's not just clothes on the floor type stuff, it's legitimately gross and disgusting messiness.  Like she'll leave her menstruating dog's bloody panty liners on the coffee table in the living room.  She cracks open eggs to use the whites, then leaves the shells and yolks in the sink to fester.  She leaves half-eaten trays of sushi on top of the bookcase so her nasty little dog won't get them, but then I don't find them until days later when the smell betrays their location. Other than the slovenly lifestyle she's a pretty good roommate (pays rent on time, not super noisy) but this is a pretty significant flaw that I've been meaning to talk to her about for a while.  Then, a couple weeks ago, she goes on a 3 week vacation with her family. She made a minimal attempt at cleaning up some of her stuff, which I appreciated.  However, Thursday night I get home from work and there is a horrible smell lingering in the house-- kind of like vanilla/beer/mold, and I can't tell where it's coming from. I go through the fridge and throw out all her old food.  I take out every garbage in the house and the smell is still there.  I scan the tops of all the furniture to make sure there wasn't a sushi tray I had missed, but nothing.  Defeated, I went to bed.  The next morning the smell was worse than ever. I walked past the door to her room (which had been shut since she left) and the smell seemed worse there, so I ventured inside.  The putrid stench hung thickly in the air, as she had turned the fan off and this is Texas in the summer. I immediately noticed my large, Pyrex lasagna dish in the corner, covered in tin foil. Unthinkingly, I removed the tin foil cover and a CLOUD of these tiny, brown, gnat-like insects swarmed out from underneath.  I gasped, coughed, and choked as one of the insects flew up my nose and became attached to the back wall of my nasopharynx.  You know, that spot where sometimes loogies get stuck where you can neither blow them out or cough them out? That spot.  I could feel it wriggling but it was pasted to my nasal passages with no way out.  In that moment I was so disgusted and blind with fury I paid it no mind. I looked down at the pan of what had formerly been banana bread, to see a chunky, gelatinous substance that was now wriggling with maggots and covered with a filamentous black fungus.  It was too much.   I grabbed the dish and stormed out into the parking lot, then chucked the whole thing into the dumpster while cursing my roommate loudly.  When I got back inside, I got in the shower and, becoming more aware of the sensation of an insect so deep up my nose it felt like it was touching my brain, began to vomit for the next half hour.  I puked so hard it came out my nose, and though it burned like a mother******, I think it finally dislodged the fly because I couldn't feel anything after that.    This was probably one of the most disgusting things I've ever seen in my life, and I work in a hospital and have seen several disgusting things.  Of course I am incredibly pissed at my roommate, but as she has not returned from her trip yet, she has no idea. I hope this makes you feel a little better about yours though!"

There were no oddball horror stories, just the day-to-day things where you grow sick of being around that person.  They grown and change, and you grown and change - and you each grow and change in different directions.

AskReddit,3e2p3v,tofu98,12,Tue Jul 21 16:12:20 2015 UTC,"I had a clean freak roommate who was crazy.  She'd literally FREAK OUT and scream and clean up after you while you were cooking.  I'd cut vegetables and be putting the first part into a pan, and she'd walk over furious that I'd left the cutting board out and messy for her to clean up....I'm literally still using it!  I'll clean up when I'm done using the cutting board!  She however only ate two things, chicken nuggets and popcorn....WHICH SHE NEVER CLEANED UP AFTER.  She cooked the chicken nuggets on the same baking sheet every day.  And when it was so caked in nugget residue it would burn in the oven, she'd put a layer of tin foil over it and cook on that.  And then when that layer was gross, instead of removing the tin foil layer, she'd add more tin foil over the top!  When she moved out, she left the pan in the drawer under the stove covered in 6 layers of greasy burnt crumbed chicken nuggets.  She couldn't stand me not cleaning a cutting board of vegetables half way thought cooking them, but apparently a baking sheet covered in 3 months of chicken grease and crumbs can go back in the drawer?  She also made herself popcorn every night, and then left the uncleaned pot on the stove all the time.  That pot was never cleaned.    She did this before she'd go to bed....at 7pm.  She's had the same bedtime since she was a child.  She never went to bed after 8 pm.  If you made it past 9 without waking her up though, she was a sound sleeper and the noise level wouldn't wake her.    She would invite her neices over with no warning.  So I was working retail at the time and had just worked an inventory until 4am.  I got home and at 6am she and her neices aged 6 and 9 started playing games that involved shrieking.  We'd never have any idea children were even in the apartment until the morning activities and she would get furious at us for implying we'd like them to keep it down until 8 or 9 because ""this is just as much her place as ours and she can do whatever she wants!""  However, if we had anyone stay for more than 2 hours she'd ask us to pay a higher share of the rent because they now counted as an additional resident of the apartment and we needed to be responsible for the burden.    She'd watch TV in her room with the door open, and get mad if you made too much noise in the living room on the other end of the house while she was watching.  But she would never change the volume, or close the door.  If she couldn't hear, she'd lecture you about roommate respect and watching the volume instead of shutting the door and turning the volume up a small smidgen.    Remember when I said she was a total neat freak and would walk around the kitchen cleaning up after you while you were still using items to cook?  She made a big deal about how the cleanliness of the kitchen was of the utmost importance.  I got off work 2 hours early one day and walked in and what did I find her doing?  Cutting someone's hair....IN THE KITCHEN!  There was hair all over the stove, counter and floor.  Vegetables are a kitchen abomination, but she cuts people's hair in there twice a week and doesn't think it's a big deal at all.    Finally she was moving out.  She let us know about a month ahead of time that she'd be leaving, and slowly started moving her stuff. This was her last, and greatest FUCK YOU:  She charged us for the last month's internet service....and the first thing she moved out was the router, which was hers.  She refused to reimburse us the month's internet, and hadn't let us know ahead of time she'd be taking it for us to go get a new router.    Then when she was upset we asked for our money back, she exacted revenge.  The table and chairs we ate at were hers, because she insisted they be the common furniture because it was the only stuff she trusted.  We couldn't fit our table and chairs in until she moved them out and she knew it.  So she left the table, our only place to eat, and she left the chairs, the only place to sit and eat.....and she took the mother fucking cushions off the chairs.  She had her brothers unscrew the cushions on all the chairs and take them, but leave the unusable chairs and table for 29 more days out of spite.  We tried to move her chairs to put our usable chairs down, and she hid all of ours into a closet in her room and set the chairs with no seat back at the table.   I still hate her guts."
AskReddit,3e0ueb,TheRadiantWreck,816,Tue Jul 21 02:19:50 2015 UTC,"Hey! This is a question I can actually contribute to. I moved to a small town a year ago and still haven't met anyone outside of coworkers. At first, I hated it and was really lonely. I was a bit depressed for a while. But I've spent a lot of time working on myself and learning how to enjoy being alone. I've tried a ton of new hobbies. Building doll houses, writing, cooking, painting. I made a commitment to fitness and I've been going to the gym almost every day. A gym is also a great place to go if you need something to do. You'll feel better about yourself after a good work out, and most gyms have free classes you can take so you can be social too if that's what you want. I google healthy recipes and make them at home. Yesterday, I made black beans (not canned)and brown rice with avocado, crumbled queso fresco, and cilantro. It was so freaking good I didn't know beans and rice could be so good. I've figured out what my perfect day looks like. It consists of sleeping in, going for a swim, coffee at home, and then hanging out at the bookstore and reading. I also binge tons of TV shows and go for long drives to listen to music.   I've stopped telling myself I can't do things just because I don't have anyone to do them with. I go to concerts, parties, movies, and all my favorite restaurants. Because I still do all the things I love, I don't feel quite as much like I'm missing out on life. Sure, sometime I'd like to have a friend or date do those things too. But the important thing is that I don't wallow in that feeling.   It also really helped when I got a dog. She is honestly my little bestie.  It helps to have another presence in the room. I don't feel nearly as lonely as I used to, and she makes me get out of the house to take her on walks. She also has helped my anxiety a lot. Now when I'm hanging out at home alone, I don't feel like I'm hanging out at home alone. I'm hanging out with my dog. There's a huge difference.   Edit: Thanks for all the support, guys!  It's honestly been a tough decade for me, and it means a lot to have some positive re-enforcement.  The truth is, the first time I went to a restaurant or movie alone, I felt really awkward and self-conscious.  It took time and effort for me to find peace with myself and to feel comfortable being alone.

Anyway, this would be my advice. Start thinking more about the things you want to do, and don't just think about how lonely you are.   You might think you don't have the discipline to consistently try new things, or exercise, but trying to figure out how to get yourself into a routine is in itself is not thinking about how alone you are.   One last thing, you may be an extrovert. Meaning you draw energy from being around people. And by energy, I mean you enjoy being around people, and feel an unease when alone. That's fine.

But opening up to other people, compromising with them, and interacting with other people - that is hard.  I don't have much experience with that - it's an unknown.

I have a dick and have the urge to use it..  But the thought of letting someone close to me again like that after this girl that I was never unsure about marrying completely crushes me and she was the one that was supposed accept me for everything I am and I thought she understood me.. it makes me shutter. I'm absolutely fearful towards letting someone in like that again.

AskReddit,3e0ueb,Snagglefart_Bumqueef,21,Tue Jul 21 15:40:42 2015 UTC,"Take it from a 40 year old female who found love, romance, passion, and intimacy after believing that the loss of my first love would crush me into pure darkness. I was determined to never let anyone close again. I had beautiful long blonde hair. I had it all cut off to a very very short pixie hairstyle. The hair that boy enjoyed, no one would ever enjoy. It wasn't until 2 full years after the break up with my first love that I met my soulmate in college. This was about 21 years ago. We are still married today. We have a son who has turned 18 and is finding his own way now. I've watched him suffer his first major heartbreak. He became suicidal as I had back in high school. We have passionate hearts and when we give them, we don't hold back.  I didn't leave him alone for one second. I carried him through. It sounds like you really loved this girl -- a lot. You wanted to spend the rest of your life with her. I too wanted to spend the rest of my life with that boy back in high school. He had other plans - to play the field, to live as a single man. Perhaps it was my mistake for not talking that through before giving my heart, but I was a young high school girl without the wisdom of a woman. I say all this to say there is someone out there for you and your radar for her is finer tuned because of what you've gone through. You don't trust now. Those that are worthy will have to prove themselves worthy. Those that don't want to prove themselves worthy, simply, aren't. I spent the first year after my break up all those years ago just being a slut. No feelings. Angry. Empty. Then I began sorting through some feelings and let my hair grow out again. I opened my heart just a little. So, when I met my future husband, I saw him for what he was...worthy."

I would honestly like nothing more than to call up a friend and vent about it while eating copious amounts of junk food. My problem is that I don't have any close friends that I can open up to on that level.

AskReddit,3e0ueb,PastelMilkTea,55,Tue Jul 21 05:05:26 2015 UTC,"I learned that it's never too late and you're never too old to make close friends. You find someone that you just like spending time with and you start hanging out more. Eventually, because you feel comfortable with each other, things just open up more. I'm also usually closed off and will very rarely let people in on my deeper thoughts. I can think of maybe 4 people tops that I would ever confide in.   Finding a good friend is a lot like finding a boyfriend/girlfriend. You gotta work at it and you take a risk by putting yourself out there emotionally, but the risk is well worth it."
AskReddit,3e0ueb,yognautilus,24,Tue Jul 21 08:01:01 2015 UTC,"I believe this 1000%, but   You find someone that you just like spending time with and you start hanging out more   This just isn't happening for me. I used to be able to make friends as you describe, and I never really had to think about it. But not any more. There are a million possible reasons for this, but after years of (honest) effort and trying new things, it seems like the only constant in all of this is me, and it's hard not to see this as a reflection of poor character (or something), which makes it very hard to put myself out there."
AskReddit,3e0ueb,MLBfreek35,13,Tue Jul 21 09:48:02 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up, it's not a reflection of poor character, the 'constant in all this' is the part of you you leave out when you have friendships with these peeps. So they filter in and out of your life (like ALL friends will do for the rest of your life), you go through that patch of the social rhythm where you chill alone, and that bit, the unincluded and uninvolved, the little drummer boy that didn't get to bang his drum, let's out a sigh and waits for the time when you take him out to play again.    Sounds pretty creepy like this. You got a community of selves people! Finding your 'best friend' of the time is usually just someone with who you can let a part of you dance that hasn't really got to dance before. So that one'll get tired out, take the bench, so someone else can come through, and the best friends will all get rearranged again. This is called growth.    edit: grammar"

AskReddit,3e0ueb,GREEN_BULLSHIT,103,Tue Jul 21 14:50:49 2015 UTC,"I thought I had a friend I could call up and vent things with. It was commonplace for us for 3 years because we had alot of the same issues. So I took a risk, and confided to them that I'd had suicidal thoughts. They immediately cut ties with me and the only reason given was they wanted to distance themselves from me.  So now, I don't confide in anyone and my small handful of friends keeps dwindling because of it.   But as for loneliness.. I'm lonely quite a bit. Painfully so. But I dislike most people. So I have my dog and my hobbies and I cry. It sucks. Bad.    Edit: I just checked my inbox and was amazed by all the kind words sent my way. Thank you all so much.

AskReddit,3e0ueb,mrocks301,40,Tue Jul 21 07:33:20 2015 UTC,"Sometimes you just say something you can't come back from and then it's over. I had a female friend I spent all of my time with. We would play video games, go to movies, dinners, go for extra long drives to nowhere. We were like flies on shit if you will.  For years We talked about anything and everything under the sun. One day we were drinking and at some point I blurted out that I loved her. She told me she knew for a long time how I felt and that it was pretty obvious. She told me she understood and we should talk about it another more sober time.  We were never close again. We stopped hanging out alone, only seen each other randomly when out with other friends. She started daiting some guy and distanced herself from me completely. We never even text or anything anymore.  Had I not said anything that drunken night we would still probably be inseparable pigs. Still I've had a lot of time to think about it, I really did feel closer to her than anyone ever. Having her around all the time was kind of a tease too I was pretty much a walking boner on days she wore yoga pants, and she never seemed to mind. It even seemed like it flattered her. I was very much in love with her at the time. She just couldn't handle that, and now I am home alone all day everyday.  If I get overwhelmed with the loneliness I try to play video games online with other players. At least then I feel like there is someone else to talk to."

What I find is that as you get older, it becomes much harder to acquire a close friend because most people has an established circle. It's extremely difficult to break into that circle without putting your new friend in a difficult position as he/she will need to prioritise you as well as his/her existing circle of friends.  Personally, I haven't had any luck finding close friend(s). Everyone seems very social and tend to invest in a variety of social networks whilst I'm the type to just find a small group and stick to it.  Perhaps, it's about personality. I'm sure there are lots of us out there who enjoy routine, small group, peacefulness and has yet to find each other."

Even if I don't find anyone i connect with, it's still a great way to spend some time. Typically the people who go are also in the market for new friends and connections, so... you never know. Your next great friend might be there.   I do think it is harder to find close friends as an adult, but that's mostly because we are pickier I think... I also think the concept of a close friend is over-inflated by movies and shows. In reality, most friendships are transient. People move away, or enter different life phases. Locals have more close connections but that doesn't mean they are fulfilling."

I guess the only thing I can suggest is to,start doing something that is a routine where other people will be each week. Like classes at a gym, or martial arts, or boxing classes, or working out at the same time each day, or go,to night classes for somethung, or join a hiking group, or cycling or some kind of pursuit or sports team. It might help to feel socail, even if you only get acquaintances out of it, at least while youre there, youre interacting with people and it migt take the edge off.  And you never knowmwhomyou may click with. Its worth a shot. Its quite necessary that its a routine type thing, so you keep seeing the same people.

AskReddit,3e0ueb,tughdffvdlfhegl,10,Tue Jul 21 05:33:12 2015 UTC,"you never know who you may click with   Honestly, this is the answer. Just keep putting yourself in positions to meet and hang out with other people. Talk to them. Eventually you'll click with someone. Don't expect them to just come to you, or for the first person you meet to be someone you can care about.  And once you make that first new friend, the second is much easier."

I used to stay home every day after work and get high and play video games. Never really hosted parties. Never went out much. It was taxing on my conscience. I decided to go help people in need. Changed my perspective on things. Ive never met an asshole who helped feed the needy or help take care of the elderly or disabled. You just havent met quality people. They are out there. You just have to go find them and they arent in bars necessarily, unless of course thats your thing...then go do that. Its easy to make friends with drunk people especially if you become a regular. Staying home by yourself is the worst thing you can do if you want to find connections with human beings.

AskReddit,3e0ueb,tacopileon,7,Tue Jul 21 04:48:59 2015 UTC,"I can relate to that. I'm a loner by nature, and I have a very small circle of friends that I stumbled into by chance after moving off for college, but other than that I abhor making new friends. I spend most of my time alone, and I love it, but every so often I feel the need to be around people. Being at work doesn't satisfy that need, though, because interactions at work are typically structured and task-based. They're employee-employee or customer-employee interactions, designed to accomplish a purpose. So when I feel the need to be social, I just go to the bar. Sometimes I sit and talk with my friends for hours; sometimes I sit quietly in the corner and browse reddit and only speak to the bartenders, but just being in the presence of other people is often all I need to feel like I'm connecting with the outside world. But everyone is different, so I don't feel qualified to give you advice on how to make new friends, but I can tell you what worked for me: I found one person with whom I had a common interest (writing), and he introduced me to his circle of friends, and they introduced me to their respective circles of other friends. All I did was have a seemingly meaningless conversation with a random person, and now I have a circle of great friends I adore. Hope that helps OP."

AskReddit,3e0ueb,Sparta2019,289,Tue Jul 21 10:27:45 2015 UTC,"I've never been someone who makes friends easily, even back at school. At the age of 21 though I left my home in the UK to meet an American girl I had started taking to online.   She was basically my only friend here. I haven't made any friends really in the decade or so I've been in the US. The only people I know are some online friends that I've met through online gaming, and one in particular whom I've known about a decade.   My wife died five years ago. So now it's just myself and our two children. I wish I had some friends, but I'm very much the classic loner introvert. I'll be honest, it's somewhat of a minor miracle that my wife and I ever connected in the first place. It was something I wouldn't normally have pursued, but just something about her intrigued me and broke through my normal reticence.   I'm trying to come out of my shell more, because honestly I'm very lonely, and still feel like a stranger in a strange country, despite having been here for some time.  I stayed a virtual shut-in for two main reasons: I was very fat, and I was an illegal alien and was afraid immigration was going to catch up with me and I'd be deported. I've since solved both of these problems, to some extent at least. I've now got a green card, and I've dropped almost 180 lbs. The old habits from before are hard to break though. The voice in my head telling me to run from new experiences and to stay indoors is both alluring and comforting. Little by little I am managing to say no though, and do new things. I took my kids to New Orleans for a few days recently, for example, and that was a lot of fun.   I very much feel like a square peg person living in a round hole world, and I don't think that's ever going to go away. Losing my wife almost crippled me, and if anything, helped to reinforce my idea that ""world = bad"". It's taken me a long time to come to terms with what happened, and I know that I'm never going to really be properly ok again. When the kids turn 18 I might have some decisions to make with regards to my personal future. At that point I don't think they will need me anymore on a daily basis as they do now.   (Edit) Thanks for all the good wishes. Not been on Reddit long and this is my most popular comment."

I've found it's pretty easy to get over myself and strike up conversations while traveling since most people have already pegged me for an idiot tourist and I can only move up in their eyes. And if they still don't like me, then who gives a shit since I'm going to be hundreds or thousands of miles away from them in a few days anyway.  Breaking the ice like this is really easy too, since you can just ask for advice on things to do, or ask other travelers where they are from.

I go weeks without speaking to another native speaker but I don't really see it as ""dealing with it"" bc I actually enjoy the isolation. I do have the internet so I talk to my friends back home pretty often and my Thai is good enough to order food and small talk. But after work I like to go for runs, listen to podcasts, draw, read, sleep at 9pm. I write a lot bc it's kinda like talking to myself. So far I've filled three journals. Weekends, I cruise around the rice paddies on my motorbike with some good tunes, pick up some market fruit and milk tea, set up my hammock. Every person will wave to me and yell, ""Hello Teacher!""

Something about the way you put it   7 billion people on this planet and people are forced to feel alone   makes it very real how ridiculous a problem this is. Sometimes I wonder whether there are people who are too eccentric or weird or boring or lazy or selfish or mean (or anything) to get along with any of the other 6,999,999,999 people on Earth. Honestly, there are days when I'm 99% sure I am one of these people. But it seems so stupid to even think that could be possible. I'm not that bad, I don't think. No one is."

I have felt my career somewhat hinders my ability to make friends. People just open up & pour out their problems. It really kills it for me. I hate being alone & would like nothing more than to find playmates.  Being alone destroys my motivation, which in turn impacts my sense of self-worth. I am still looking for soluntions."

Dude. Just get out. You know you should. Just do it, trust me.  If it gets too awkward, retreat back to your cave and do it again the next day. And the next. And the next.  Eventually, it will stop being terrifying. Eventually, you'll stop having panic attacks. Eventually, you'll stop rolling over it all in your head when you go to bed.  Eventually, you'll actually enjoy it.  I don't know how I'd be able to live my life without going out to shows these days- I went from being a shut in gamer to becoming a social butterfly, if only for one reason: I found out I really liked going to rock shows, even with the resultant panic attacks and freak outs and strangers and crowds. The more I went, the easier it became. I've become good friends with the local bands in the area, and the circle of friends I have are one of the most important things I've ever had in my life- I'd trade all my games, my PC, my internet connection, anything other than my son or my job, rather than lose the people I've found and the life I've been able to make with them.

I can go out and do things like shop and whatever, talk to cashiers or everyday stuff.  I can go to work and deal with rough tradesmen.  But friends?  No.  Can't make them.  Don't trust them any more.  Last good friend I had, he helps me move and then two months later I'm walking by his work so I decide to visit.  We hadn't seen each other since I'd been working out of town so I thought he'd be happy to see me.  And sure enough, he was friendly. I talked to a few of the other people I knew from my time working there.  I get home, I'm making dinner and I get a text and he's bitching me out about visiting and how it makes him uncomfortable.  I think it's bullshit but either out of desperation to have a friend or politeness or whatever, I apologize.  He bitches me out some more, I apologize again.  Delete his number and haven't heard from him since.  I figure I must have done something to piss him off but I can't think of what.  Or a month ago there was this girl at a burrito place I'd been talking to.  Started flirting, joking around, ask her out, she says no because she's married (I never saw the ring under the gloves).  I say no problem.  She offers to introduce me to someone, I say sure, if you have someone in mind.  A few weeks later I'm back there, dressed nice just in case, she says the girl is working next door.  I go over and she starts talking Filipino to her and the other one is almost yelling back.  I don't know what was said, but she was clearly not happy to make my acquaintance. I was humiliated in front of a whole restaurant, left, never went back.  I'm done.

AskReddit,3e0ueb,defeatedbird,24,Tue Jul 21 05:58:23 2015 UTC,"It's been a culmination of a long, long bad run.  A girlfriend who was happier when I was out of town and really only wanted me for the money.  A long nightmare of constant rejections in online dating leading up to that girlfriend.  Losing my best friend because I can't stand to watch the way his wife treats him.  After 6 years we had two talks about it.  He acknowledged it but contact has been dying off.  The damage to the relationship isn't helped by the pity he feels towards me for my struggles.  I really resent that and told him too, when we were having that second talk about his wife.  A lifetime of unpopularity in school.  Didn't like the geeks, wasn't part of the jocks or any other clique.  Didn't even try after a while, because hey, who's going to make friends in high school when they actually say what they're thinking and have the social skills of an Aspy without actually having asperger's (and yes, I've asked three of my therapists, a psychiatrist, and a physician about it.)  A horrible divorce between my parents where my dad pulled a knife on me after beating my mom and I hated him for years over it (even planned his murder), but it turned out my mom had cheated on him with this huge alcoholic loser.  At that point I was already broken and dependent on her for support.  As a grown man, in his 20s, when I should be getting out on my own.  I'd stayed in denial about what my mom did until shortly before her death when I confronted her about it to get silence in return.  Oh, did I mention that my dad's way of raising me was to ignore me until it was time to criticize anything I did?  If I wasn't good enough - the standard cliche bad-dad thing - then, worse, that hobby was for losers.  My mom tried compensating by smothering me and clinging to me as the happy thing in her relationship with my dad.  Unusually enough for an overprotective mother, she taught me that everything had to be perfect.  And yes, like I mentioned earlier, I've had therapy.  I've tried anti-depressants (which lead to the collapse of the closest thing I had to an actual relationship because fucking Cipralex makes it fucking impossible to having a fucking orgasm and it turns out that men who haven't had an orgasm in 5 months are a little snappish).  And all that the therapy did - group and otherwise - was make it obvious just how utterly broken I am.  I was happier being a clueless loser in denial.  edit: sorry, had to vent."

AskReddit,3e0ueb,Drumdrumdrum66,29,Tue Jul 21 11:25:11 2015 UTC,"Learn the difference between being alone, and being lonely. I currently have no job, no money, and no car, yet I've never been happier. I used to hate being alone, now I look forward to the next time I can be. I ride my bike everywhere around my hometown and every day I discover something I never knew about before and it's such an amazing feeling. Being alone allows you to be free to feel and express yourself in any way you'd like without judgement. Just the other day I witnessed a chipmunk chasing another and I instantly smiled and started to laugh and I can't help but wonder if I would do the same in an area full of people. Being alone, for me at least, has truly helped me pull happiness and satisfaction from the littlest things. I believe when we're alone, we grow and learn, and when we're around others, we show what we've learned. Then again I'm 23 and kind of a loser but I'm the happiest loser I know."

He also calls me daily (which I usually answer)  I live alone in my 3br house.. and like it just fine.  I hope I'll meet a girl and things will go great, but I'm 36 and haven't yet.  shrug, I like refinishing guns, collecting knives and watching movies and such.  If my job didn't require being around people most days, I'd probably only see most people when I was out mowing the lawn.   When I go out to a party, picnic or whatever social gathering, it usually takes a day of quiet solitude for me to feel calm and.. um, reset? I have made up excuses before to keep from going to things I'd probably enjoy, but the onset anxiety just isn't worth it for me.  I suppose I have the opposite problem of you, OP.   I don't think its healthy to just be alone and by yourself all the time.  I play some video games online and have joined the local volunteer fire department, done volunteer work, participated in a few charities, headed safety committees at work, etc. in an effort to be more social.  I also go visit my 91 year old grandmother one evening each week; it's a 60 mile round trip and she doesn't really know who I am at any given time, but it's pleasant conversation and I feel like it must be nice to know that people care enough about you to visit.    Anyway, as you can see, there's ways of putting yourself out there in social situations if that's what you want.  I really don't, but I feel like I should so I do.

AskReddit,3e0ueb,tylerherod,27,Tue Jul 21 05:45:55 2015 UTC,"I've been living in a new bachelor since May, and I'm in my last summer of university before graduating. All I have for responsibilities is a research job at school. The kicker is I essentially lost my social group by moving out...because my social group relied on the relationship I had, which fell apart (which was why i moved to a bachelor).  So, I've been alone a lot. It was hard at first. I had too much free time and initially, my best attempts to ""keep busy"" ended with me dwelling on things I couldn't change. So I decided not to mope around and got busy as soon as May First hit. I started a rigorous gym routine. I wake up, make breakfast, and head off to work. After work I head straight to the gym (this is important - I don't go home between) and I push myself. It leaves me feeling accomplished and gives the feeling of productiveness. It also tires me out. Since I walk to work and the gym, walking takes up about an hour of day. I get home around 8pm and shower, and cook if I need to. I've been ""meal planning"" and this has sparked a desire to take cooking seriously, which again, eats up time. After cooking, I'm pretty tired, so I usually just want to relax. This helps kill my desire to see other people on weekdays after work. So this is when I rely on entertainment like shows or Xbox. I don't feel guilty or lonely playing xbox at 9pm at night because I'm too tired to do otherwise! And the gym makes me feel like I've earned it. The only troubling part of my routine are weekends, because I don't have work obligations and I also don't have anything pushing me to the gym (leaving at 10am or 2pm for the gym doesn't change anything, so I'll often push it off until 2pm). So, that's something I need to work on. There are unfortunately some days where I just binge a show or play too much Xbox. Having chores like going out for groceries or doing helps. sometimrs I'm too exhausted from the week to mind, other times it's tough.  I still spend a lot of time alone despite keeping busy, so my solution is..podcasts. Yeah, that might sound lame, but I've found a really good one that I'm burning through at the moment. It keeps my mind occupied and i couldn't live like this without them. I think I'm on episode 154, and I started at 1 back in May..at 90 minutes each you can see how it could keep you entertained. Another idea are audio books - something I've been meaning to get ahold of. I usually have headphones in when at the gym, walking, cooking..so it keeps me occupied.   I couldn't maintain this lifestyle indefinitely, but as a student knowing I'll get invested in classes in under two months, I just don't mind. As soon as September hits in back to school and that will get me out of this situation. I'll get busy with school friends (those who I only see in class) and also with studying. I'm sure your life is different, but perhaps some of what I said helps. You will make new friends and won't always be lonely with enough time. If I had to maintain this lifestyle as a non student I'd put more time into seeing new people (coworkers?) on weekends and establishing those friendships."

So I cope with that urge for people by reminding myself how much people always end up disappointing me. But that's just me.

I'll respond to a few common themes I've seen here.  1) Woman beating- In not trying to be an apologist here, but the truth is, I don't know the story, because he's never really given his side that I've seen. There's never a valid reason to beat your wife, but I just don't have enough info to make a character judgement here, and I probably never will. So I choose to enjoy his work as a performer.  2) Drug use- eh, so what. There are probably a lot of celebrities you know and love that do drugs. Maybe they do it more privately, but whatever. It's their choice. As long as they're not pretending to be a role model for kids, it doesn't really bother me.   3)  He's a jerk!-  Says who? Have you met him? I know he had a reputation years ago, but people can change. Its seems like he devoted a lot of his time nowadays, just randomly popping up in people's selfies and at weddings and just goofing off. I don't think he would do that if he didn't like people. Again, no judgements from me.   4)  His work sucks!- if you don't like anything he's done, fair enough. I'm a child of the 80's, and Bill Murray was a huge comedy icon in those days. I grew up on a steady diet of Stripes, Ghostbusters, and SNL reruns.  Bill Murray more or less introduced me to bring funny. The man has informed parts of my personality that I didn't even realize until I was an adult. My dad was a huge fan, and I got my sense of humor largely from him. So, in a pretty big way, Murray was responsible for that side of me as well. So fine, you're not a fan. I am. And I'll be sad when he goes.  Ninja edit: formatting"

The United States was a pristine, gigantic environment with practically every type of geological wonder or natural climate represented. Through repeated efforts since the early 1900s, our amount of public land has skyrocketed. 8% of the land in the U.S. is protected by the U.S. Forest Service alone.  That does not include the bureau of Land management, or state parks.   In comparison with many countries, the U.S. remained relatively pristine even as we industrialized and ascended to supremacy.  Edit: 12% of the United States is protected land managed by various groups. To put it into perspective, this is also one-tenth of the protected land area of the world. The U.S. also had a total of 787 National Marine Protected Areas, covering an additional 627,830 km2 (242,410 sq mi), or 67 percent of the total marine area of the United States.  Further edit: The United States makes up 6% of the land in the world, and is responsible for a 10th of all protected lands. Some countries may have greater amounts of public land set aside, however most of these countries, such as Germany, have had much more significant deforestation. This means that protected lands in other countries may not have the same level of biodiversity. The level of management and attentiveness to natural environment in our protected areas is also top notch, which is why the American National Parks system are renowned worldwide. From a percentage of land protected standpoint, we are not number one, but examining all of the relevant factors provides a convincing argument for the United States supremacy in the realms of National Parks and public land management."

In other countries, creditors can keep hounding you for money and take a lot of your stuff to get their money back.

Amtrak is actually profitable in this corridor btw, it's just they're required to run through rural parts of the country by Congress that are never going to be profitable."

AskReddit,3e27na,pvbob,74,Tue Jul 21 12:50:43 2015 UTC,"A lot of the reason they go crazy after a tackle in the NFL is to maintain the intensity. As the sport is played in short, intermittent bursts, it's very difficult to keep warm and active, so they are constantly overcompensating for the inevitable down time. For example, including breaks and half time, some players can go over an hour between play on the field. Not due to substitution or anything, just waiting for the opposing team to finish their drive."

Constantly surprises me that if it was necessary, 1 Aircraft Carrier Strike group could flatten most of the navies out here (literally uncontested, like no one on our side would probably be hurt) simultaneously... And we have 11 different strike groups.   But in the end, all we are doing out here is sending marines, SEALs, Navy ships, doctors, war lawyers, engineers, etc to train up these smaller countries militaries, build relations, and generally make friends.   And if anything goes wrong (tsunamis, floods, downed aircraft, piracy, general disasters) the navy has 2-3 ships underway, the Airforce has a cargo planes full of supplies circling in the air, and the marines are standing by to provide doctors, water, and food ---before even being asked and without expecting anything in return---. So that if any of the countries who require assistance can merely ask the U.S. for help and we are there in less than 24 hours. So yes, we are good at war, but those instruments of war are used primarily for peace and stability."

Not because I actually want to talk about my feelings, but because I don't.   The whole deal with it being supposedly unmanly to discuss emotions has lead to the notion that men are holding back their feelings to appear manly and are just waiting for that special moment/person to open up, and that just isn't true of so many people.   No doubt it's far worse to want to talk about something and feel like you can't or shouldn't. But it is still god damn infuriating to have someone repeatedly prod and poke and insist that you ""can talk to them"", refusing to accept that you'd really rather not.  Both cases completely dismiss the idea that there might be some degree of individuality to how a person deals with distress, and that's really shitty."

In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine.

For context, I had a stop sign, and they didn't. Almost every week, some driver would see me waiting at the stop sign there and would STOP in the middle of the road and wave me across in front of them, even while the other lane was still whizzing with traffic. Some of these over-enthusiastic yielders would even start honking after a minute after I refused to go. I would just be sitting there, like, dude, I'm not going to bike into the middle of traffic; I'll wait for the lull that I get when the light a few blocks down turns red and it becomes safe for me to cross.

He waives them through. He's waving me through before I even stop; I come to a full stop (guy's still waving me through) and then go.  Here's the thing though. The dude waving the first car and me through had four cars behind him. As I started to go, some guy in that line started to try and pass the dude waving everyone through. They couldn't see, and I had to slow down to let that person back in line.

I am a small woman but I work in a job where I am required to be able to carry reasonably heavy objects, and push heavy 6-wheel carts.  I am required to do this.  If I was unable to do this, my employers would either not have hired me, or had someone else do the job.  When a customer (always an older man, zero exceptions.  Sometimes young men or women will offer to help, but old men, some of them quite frail, will just bound up with a self indulgent smile and snatch things from me) takes something from me because they just assume I am unable to carry it, that just wrecks the whole situation.  If I am carrying it without falling over, that means I am situated and well on my way, and you probably have to give it back to me because you don't know where we are going with that thing.  What's worse is when people try to steer the 6-wheel carts from the front unexpectedly.  Again, you have no idea where I'm pushing this thing.  And that languid, smug half-drag that these men always do usually makes the carts start to wiggle and lose control.  You doing that dopey smile and trying to ""help"" someone who didn't need help has now smashed my cart into a display, breaking all the things on that display and knocking all the stuff off of my cart.  I was about 5 seconds away from delivering these items from one department to another, but now I need to drag another person from their job to clean up the display you smashed while I re-stock my cart.

I had a roommate that takes my supplies like they're his, so I keep a lot of my stuff in my room. Anyway, I had just bought a pack of bar soap one night and it was on my desk. I was looking for a good video to get the job done, and got side tracked wanting to smell the soap (I really liked the smell). So eventually I start jerking it, getting frustrated because of the prozac-caused difficulties, and I just grabbed at the bar of soap, idk why, and started rubbing the dry bar across my face. Fast forward four years, I'm off prozac, and I have no problem ejaculating....as long as I rub my face with a dry bar of soap. If I don't do that, I can hardly keep it up."

Aside from that, I don't really buy a whole lot of junk food.  Thing is, my wife and I are healthy but when we do get junk food it does not last long.

AskReddit,3e0psl,pteam-pterodactyl,961,Tue Jul 21 05:32:01 2015 UTC,"I live in Salt Lake City and there are just a lot of homeless people here. A couple years ago I saw an Ask Reddit thread about useful things to give homeless people, so one day I threw on some shabby clothes and filled a backpack with said things. I walked up and down the street and through parks just making eye contact and striking up conversation with them. Most of them figure I'm on the road too with the backpack and all, but after talking a bit to check them out I ask if they could use help with anything, then I give them whatever I think they could use from my backpack. It's the most amazing way to spend my free time. It's incredible to get to know some of them on a real basis.  Anyway, this is really the first time I've ever told anyone I do this. None of my friends know. I don't necessarily keep it secret because I'm all selfless or whatever, it's just something I really like doing on my own. It's a one man show, and I'm really good at reading them now and it's like a game figuring out what I have that they could use. I don't want anyone else messing up my private time, so I've kept it to myself in the eighteen months or so I've been at it.  Edit: A lot of people have asked me for a list of items and tips so I'll jot a few down here. My backpack is split into 3 separate categories-- sanitation, sustenance, and humanity.  Sanitation-- If you've ever read Slaughter House 5, Vonnegut talks about the key to surviving a POW camp is to keep clean. Hygiene is the first thing people let go and it's all downhill from there. *Bar soap with container *Shampoo *Travel sized toothbrush and tooth paste *hand sanitizer (non-alcoholic) *deodorant (make the effort to have men smelling and women smelling ones-- they appreciate it so much) *tampons or pads for women *bandaids and other first aid kit items *CONDOMS!!!-- I can't stress this enough and it's so often overlooked. So many homeless women turn to sex work for money and don't have money for protection. You want to help spread STDs and children from people who can't care for them? GIVE CONDOMS TO THE HOMELESS!  Sustenance *nut bars-- get the kind with real nuts and seeds and shit. I like Nature Valley. *cans of tuna *small jars of peanut butter (they lose their shit over this) *crackers *jerky (if you can find it at a good price) *You get the idea here... high protein, sustainable, non-perishable foods. I honestly go with what's on sale, what I can get the most of for my $  Humanity-- Humanity? WTF, right? So this is actually the most important one IMO. The thing many of us don't realize is how quickly these people lose their sense of being human. They literally don't see themselves as human like the rest of us, just depressed needy things sulking about the city. And when you reach that point... damn, the looks on some of their faces. I don't know how some of them ever come out of it. When you give them money or the rest of your pizza or whatever, that's great and they DO appreciate it. But it perpetuates this idea that you're on a different level than them and de-humanizes them in a way. That's why I take off my suit and basically dress homeless when I do this. I am NOT above them. My six figures and their broke asses have nothing to do with the degree to which we are human.  Be careful here, be safe, but sit down with them when you can. Have a conversation. Ask their name. Find out where they're from and what they like and what they want. You'd be so goddamned surprised how many of them have these epic dreams to get degrees and have careers and start families and buy property, things most people would laugh at them for admitting they want. They go days with people giving them dirty looks, saying terrible things to them, no human interaction. If you just sit down with them, level with them, look into their eyes and realize you're both the same kind of stardust... it'll do as much for you as it does for them.  That said... *Books *New underwear and socks (size medium and large for both sexes does the trick) *flashlights *portable phone charger-- I have a portable charger and sometimes ask if they need their phone charged. Many of them have pre-paid phones they use to look for jobs or call family but have a hard time finding a place to charge them *note-pads and pens *Maps of shelters and treatment centers in the area *Bus passes  Finally, I always give them a note and every time I see a repeat they tell me they still carry my note with them. Basically I just tell them to hang in there and encourage them to get a little closer to where they want to be every day. I say some other shit too but it's like my trademark so I won't go into detail.  I've gotten a lot of responses from people saying they want to do this and I just need to say be safe. It can get scary at times and unless you've been in a few bar fights and won most of them consider donating or volunteering at a shelter which is just as valuable."

I'm not saying that you have to feel a certain way about them but I've learned to love my little boobs! Some pros: you can wear strapless things, little spaghetti straps, pretty much any bathing suits, adorable bras, smaller top sizes fit you proportionally, and sometimes you don't even have to wear a bra. They don't hurt, they don't jiggle too much when you run down stairs, you can buy cheap sports bras. That stuff is awesome. Although I hate to say it, I didn't think my boobs were great until I started dating me current boyfriend. When I was younger and flatter than all the other girls I was convinced I was going to get a boob job when I was 23 because I heard somewhere you might still develop until like 22 or something. I was like you know what, 34C would be perfect for me. When I started dating my boyfriend I realized that little boobs are still desirable and every reason why I didn't like them before was because I felt undesirable. I felt ugly and never sexy or hot before. Once I realized that the only person that truly felt that way was me I felt so liberated. I stopped buying uncomfortably padded push-ups, I didn't wear a regular bra with padding under my sports bras, and I bought a bandeau swimsuit top. I really like how I look now and I like how they make me feel slim and I like the way my torso looks when I'm topless and I like the way really cute and padding-free bras look on me.   I just want to let you know that you are beautiful exactly how you are. Don't let your idea of what a sexy woman looks like get in the way of having pride in your body.

AskReddit,3e0psl,IranianGenius,374,Tue Jul 21 02:10:08 2015 UTC,"I have a family friend who also thinks it's important to respect roadkill.  Where he was born and raised in the Middle East, he was taught that life was precious, and that when we kill something, we should not let it go to waste.   When he was in college he had a long distance girlfriend. At the time he lived in Washington State and she lived in Montana. One winter evening, on his way to visit her, he saw a deer dead at the side of the road. He figured it would be better if it didn't rot, and he could just bring the deer for his girlfriend and him to eat. He'd cut them up before, eaten them himself, and everything was fine.    Well the night got really foggy, and he was having a hard time driving, so he ended up going pretty slowly. Apparently he was driving poorly because a cop ended up pulling them over. He was starting to feel a bit anxious because he wanted to be with his girlfriend already.  Well the cop knocks on the window for him to lower it, and he does. The cop shines a flashlight inside, so he can see who's driving through the dark and fog, and he sees a deer, sitting on the passenger seat, wearing a seatbelt, with its tongue hanging out.   The cop gives my friend a look like ""what is this?"" He casually asks ""so you found this deer on the side of the road?""  My friend excitedly says ""yes! I'm planning to eat it!""  The cop coolly responds ""you know that's illegal?""  My friend said ""no, I didn't know this is illegal.""  The cop started pulling out his pad. Without skipping a beat, my friend opened the passenger door, undid the seatbelt, kicked the deer outside, and sped off.  It's a much better story when he says it with his accent. Sorry I can't do it justice.    tl;dr: respecting roadkill is normal."

AskReddit,3e0psl,BonjourMyFriends,19,Tue Jul 21 05:01:52 2015 UTC,"Grew up in a pretty small town, not much to do but drive around and get into trouble. One night when I was 16, a friend and I hopped the fence at the public pool where I worked in the summers. After a swim, I got out my keys, we started poking around the office and the supply rooms, and ended up finding this five gallon bucket full of rubber chickens. (No idea why we had them.) We figured we could use them for something funny eventually, so we put them in a paper bag and continued cruising around town listening to a mix CD. Typical Saturday.  Later we were at Wal-Mart, and we recognized a friend's car in the parking lot. We put one of the rubber chickens on his radio antenna, shoved the antenna in the little squeaky hole in the chicken's bum. I moved my car across from his so we could see his reaction. Our friend finally came out to his car along with this girl he just started dating. He took the rubber chicken off and looked around. Next we started up the car and followed him. At the first red light, leaving the Wal-Mart parking lot, we pulled up next to him and threw a rubber chicken onto his hood. He was so terrified he wouldn't look over at us. Finally we had something to do!   At every red light in town, we'd pull up behind or next to him and throw rubber chickens onto his hood. We did this for about 10 or 15 minutes, until my friend realized he was driving to the girl's house to drop her off. We didn't want to scare them too bad, or get shot by her dad, so we decided to head back towards his house before he got there, hide in his bushes, then jump out with some rubber chickens and reveal ourselves.  I started speeding towards his house so we'd have plenty of time to hide the car and walk there. He lived in one of those little towns that pretty much just had one traffic light, a Speed Limit sign, and a cop always waiting there nearby to give a speeding ticket. Right before my friend's street, I saw blue and red lights in the mirrors, the first time in my life. Being an invincible teen, my first instinct was to quickly turn down a couple roads to try to lose the cop. It didn't work. I ended up being pulled over right next to my friend's house.  It was a relatively cold night (for Florida) so I didn't roll my window down right away. The police came up quicker than expected and angrily knocked on my window and said to roll it down. I don't remember what he said at first, but it was something furious. Then he lowered his head in to look around and right away this ridiculous song on a mix CD started playing super loud. I thought I'd turned the volume down, but the previous song was just much much quieter. He jerked his head back and asked, ""What's wrong with you guys? Are y'all on drugs or something?""  My friend said, ""no sir,"" the cop shined the flashlight in his eyes, and then down at the paper bag at his feet.  ""What's in the bag?"" he asked.  ""Rubber chickens, sir.""  ""...What?""  ""Rubber chickens sir.""  ""You better not be messing with me, boy. Let me see.""  My friend opened up and showed the police our remaining haul of stolen rubber chickens.  He leaned on the edge of my window and whispered, ""Y'all get the hell out of my town and don't come back.""  Right about that time, my friend drove by really slow, recognized both of us in the car pulled over by the cops practically in his front yard. He was pointing at us and laughing his ass off, it was really the ultimate schadenfreude karma moment for the asshole pranksters my friend and I were.  Anyway, we didn't have a dead deer in the passenger's seat, just some rubber chickens, but I did try to run away from that cop at first, and he did end up letting us go with only a stern verbal warning, no ticket, and no paperwork... it does happen."

AskReddit,3e0psl,Writes_Sci_Fi,88,Tue Jul 21 03:40:31 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I think about this too. Just yesterday I passed a dead horse on the road. It was sad. There he lay, on his side, still white, his hair still moving with the wind. But he was distorted. His belly was inflated and his mouth was open. I imagined what he was like when he lived. He probably belonged to someone who treated him well. He looked like a healthy guy. I'm sure he ran many times on many fields.  There's always the question of what animals experience. I own three dogs, and I can tell you that they know what joy is. They know fear and they know excitement. It's strange to put oneself into their shoes because our minds are so different. I see them sometimes staring through the gate. It's entirely possible that I'm projecting human emotions on to them, but I do think there is a longing in them.

An individual who has mastered the art of return banter and accepts it as playful japery.  Nando's - a South African chicken restaurant, that claims to be a Portuguese restaurant that has based its spicy 'peri peri' sauce on the cuisine of Mozambique. Popular with lads, especially if you decide to pop in briefly for some chicken (a cheeky Nando's).  Cheeky - naughty, but not that naughty.  Ant and Dec - annoying TV show hosts from Newcastle, although nobody is really sure which is Ant and which is Dec. Think Ryan Seacrest, only two of them. Initially known as PJ and Duncan after the characters they played on 'Byker Grove', a TV show where PJ was blinded by a paintball. This has led to Ant screaming ""Duncan, man, I'm blind!"" in a spate of atrocious acting. Also famous for the rap hit 'Let's get ready to rumble', a song so bad Vanilla Ice would cringe.

My ex used to be on the board of directors for the student housing they use, and they would often just trash the place when they left. Holes in the wall, broken fixtures - just wanton destruction. Sometimes they also shit in the middle of the floor before leaving, just to say ""fuck you for providing me affordable housing during my holiday"".  Recently a bunch of them died when a balcony collapsed during a party - which led to some awkward national conversations. On the one hand, they were all J-1 visa idiots and thus part of our national shame. On the other hand, eight or nine people died and at least one more was paralyzed (and impressively brave about it on social media). Furthermore, they died because the building was full of dry-rot due to shoddy construction, not because they were being louts or anything like that.

Examples of this include homeowners' obsession with house prices even to the extent that they oppose things that can make housing affordable for people who don't own housing (ie.

That'll be 25 fucking years to build, mostly due to legal battles about deciding where the route will go. Good luck suggesting any actual novel infrastructure ideas (HS2 is hardly a novel idea - the Japanese had bullet trains in the 1960s!) - it'll never happen.  We really need an injection of industry in the UK at the moment, and the freedom to over-rule a minority objections for the good of the rest of society (its a balance that's swung way too far one way - especially as the country is so densely populated), the UK is already lagging behind lots of places, it'll be a shitty place to live in 50 years compared to most of the rest of the West if we keep the current rate of 'progress' up.

London in Summer is overcrowded, full of tourists and commuters trapped in the sweaty ninth level of hell called The Tube. London in Autumn is rain-swept misery and inescapable sniffles.

Doesn't mean the guy's perfect though, but if one of his core beliefs is to respect himself and others, he's on the right track and he knows how to get back on there. There's no ""stereotypical"" image either-- I've seen big bearded tattooed biker gang dudes who have treated me with respect, and I've seen young entrepreneur-type slick haired gentlemen who've treated me like I should consider it an honor that he's even speaking to me. And vice versa.  You know when you're being treated with respect. It doesn't mean they're treating you like a god though. Maybe I'm just lonely but when someone just looks at and talks to me like a person who has my own thought processes, ideas, preferences, my own individual life, I consider that person a friend or a brother in life even if we're strangers."

Rank butt, face and boobs from 1-10, but butt gets weighted higher then face which in turn gets weighted higher then boobs. Every butt point is worth 50% more then face, and each face point is worth 50% more then boobs. So lets say I rank OPs mom like this:  Butt - 5 = 10 Face - 6 = 9 Boobs 4 = 4  That's a total of 23. If her sister (OP's aunt) ranked like this:  Butt - 3 = 6 Face - 8 = 12 Boobs 7 = 7  Op's aunt would get a total score of 25. So even though the aunt doesn't have as nice of an ass her better face and boobs make up for it and I would bang her first."

I would also get calls from Spanish people asking for here at least once a week. I figured out that she must have never told anyone that she was getting a new number or something.   The saddest thing was the Mother's Day text.   She didn't even tell her kids what was going on.   I'm actually starting to believe that she died and no one found out. I've been getting calls less frequently now and when I do, I usually tell them that she doesn't have this number (Or ""Ella no tiene este numero"" or whatever it is).   The last call was from some white guy asking for her and after I told him I wasn't a dead Spanish lady he said ""You must get these calls all the time""  You have no idea."

It was some dude who was clearly strung out on some combination of drugs. He started out the message by cursing me (well, technically he was cursing out ""Jeff"") for not coming over to his house. Then he went into a very detailed account about how his mom whooped his ass the other day. This guy was a grown-ass man, too. That story morphed into a heart-to-voicemail conversation about his marriage failing, and about how ""Jimmy"" never called him back after a rendezvous (I got the distinct sense it was of the sexual variety).   By the end of the message he was in tears and I could hardly even understand him. But he was telling Jeff for the first time that he had been abused as a kid, and I was left wanting more because through his sobbing and slurring I missed out on what seemed to be the real personal stuff.  Well I'd normally laugh and move along, but I felt obligated to tell this guy that this very personal message didn't go through to Jeff. So I called the number back the next day, and a woman picked up. I said that a man had called me mistaking me for Jeff.

Of course, this release party was at the venue of choice for all major music releases: the strip club. But that wasn't the news story. The story was the strippers. Apparently, all the strippers were celebrities. And these strippers weren't strippers so much as they were prostitutes. The only one he named was Dakota Fanning, and apparently he was concerned because she was only 15 (she was 18 the year I received this call).

When the new exchange was introduced, many people were used to calling the 4 digit number only and now had to dial the exchange (123-4567 instead of just 4567).    Well, everyone was 'used' to the old exchange prefix so everyone dialed it.  New company in town was NEW-1111 and my house was OLD-1111.  We probably got 10 wrong numbers a day for well over a year.    Being a 12-13 year old kid, I decided that after answering it ""stonemender residence"" was enough warning for them.  If they persisted in asking me questions about water heaters, air conditioners, furnaces, water softeners , etc that I would simply do my best (and most comical) to answer their questions.  The one I remember best was someone who had a billing dispute.  I answered and they started yelling (they were absolutely raging and semi-crazy) that the item we sold them was defective!  I assured them that no one here has EVER sold them anything nor would I EVER even think about replacing their item or giving them a refund.  They flew into an all-out rage, and yelled they were COMING OUT THERE RIGHT NOW.  I informed them if they set one foot on the property that I would call the police.

Then the lady on the other end of the call says, ""What are you wearing to the party today?"" and finally, my mom had to ask who she was.  ""Karen! It's your mother.""  Well, no. My grandma was living with us at the time, and she was in the other room.

AskReddit,3e2tx9,Hetsybardi,16,Tue Jul 21 16:57:45 2015 UTC,"This one was downright creepy...  About this time last year I was hiking around Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado with some friends of mine. As we were walking we stumbled upon these old, black, creaky, seemingly abandoned cabins. They were like something you would see in a horror movie like Cabin In The Woods. We all made some sort of remark about how incredibly creepy they looked. Not more than 10 seconds later my friend Matt gets this phone call from an unknown number. He picks it up, and says ""hello?"". There was no response. So he says ""who is this?"" He must have had it on speaker because we all remember the response... ""Satan"" and then the phone hangs up. We were all super creeped out. By far the weirdest inexplicable call I've gotten."

AskReddit,3e2tx9,infernic15,5,Tue Jul 21 17:23:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe not truly a wrong number, but strange none the less:  A few weeks ago, I got a call from a blocked number and, out of curiosity and sheer loneliness (I had a bad breakdown earlier in the day and no one I cared about was available/willing to talk to me/see me), picked it up. The girl on the other end asked for ""J"" and I said there was no ""J"" here, but she said not to hang up, she wanted to talk. Her voice sounded weird, like she had been crying, so I said sure I'll talk.  Come to find out, she's not crying, she's masturbating. She says she bought a new toy, a double-ended vibrator, and asked if she could have my address so she could come over and have fun together. ""I'm not giving you my address,"" I told her.   Oh, and another strange thing about this call that I should mention: The noise on the other end occasionally dropped out for a few seconds, like we had a bad connection or she was muting her end of the call.  I'm about to hang up, but she keeps talking more. She knows one of my hobbies, which I find a bit strange (though it's not a very uncommon hobby for women: collecting nail polish)... She tries to get my address again and I turn her down. ""I have my ways of finding these things,"" she tells me.  ""Oh, really?"" I ask. At this point, I'm starting to suspect it isn't so much a wrong number as someone trying to annoy me or drive me to paranoia (too late, buddy, I've been there for awhile now). I tell her I suspect she has been told to call me by someone who likes to mess around with me. She asks for a name of this person and I refuse to name names (because I had more than one suspect in mind and I didn't want to ramble off a list of names and sound too crazy).  She says we can still have fun over the phone because I have a sexy voice. Usually, I'd be all up for some weird anonymous lesbian phone sex, but my breakdown earlier in the day had sucked any sexual energy I had out of me. At this point, I begin to cry and I tell her, ""This is bad timing..."" She asks why, and I can't really form a sentence. I just mumble ""I'm a horrible person."" I hear some moving around on her end, like maybe the phone is being placed on a surface or something, then the line goes dead.  I keep waiting for someone to show up at my door."

My phone usually doesn't even have a signal when I'm out there, but this evening it did. I had just switched my number about a week prior to this and I had gotten several calls and texts for whoever had had the number before me (some were from a federal penitentiary). That evening I got a group text message from a pregnant woman who had just come from a doctor visit and wanted to update her friends. She went into detail about the examination and how it was uncomfortable for the doctor to have his fingers inside her. Then she talks about how this pregnancy has really made her body hair grow quicker and fuller. The friends all comment on how that happens sometimes or has happened to them too. Then comes 5 pictures of her forearms, her belly, her legs and the top of her bikini area - all of which were pretty hairy. So, naturally, I commented and said that she really needed to get that under control with some shaving and waxing. Then nothing for like 10 minutes. Then I get, ""Who the fuck is this?"" I responded by sending her a selfie of the guy that has tattooed his face and had cosmetic surgery to look like a cat. Whiskers and everything. She says, ""Eww, fuck you. Leave me the hell alone and you better delete my pictures."" So I do and I did."

A girl complimenting anything about me.     Goosebumps as the breeze hits the back of my neck.     The first bite of a plump nectarine.     Seeing how many peas can fit stuck in my fork.     Taking my pants off after a long day.     When someone says ""You made my day.""     Complimenting someone.     The feeling of inertia as the plane descends.     Giving out halloween candy.     Getting a straight or a flush in poker.     Seeing an animal (even as simple as a deer or squirrel) in the wild.     Opening the door, the fly leaves, no flies enter.     The moment of meditation after I do something wrong.     Drawing a perfect circle with a compass.     Hitting green lights my whole way home.     Getting a call from a friend from long ago.     Writing handwritten letters, licking the envelopes, and mailing them.     When you climb to the top of the tree.     When you hike to the top of the hill.     When you wake up without hitting the snooze button.     The fog layering glasses when eating soup.     Seeing very old couples happy together.     Giving food to a patient at the hospital.     Giving a hug to someone who needs it.     When all of the popcorn pops.     When the sequel is somehow better than the original.     When there is someone to share the Kit Kat with.     The moment I slip on my lucky boxers.     The initial feeling of jumping into a puddle.     The sound of a leaf crackling while walking in the fall.     When she hits me up first.     The moment of silence after listening to a good song.     When I accomplish something someone told me I could never do."

AskReddit,3e2ho2,Can-eh-dian_B-eh-con,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:26:44 2015 UTC,"I really like the idea behind this list, basically ""the small things."" Like, the big things in life are usually out of our control to a degree, and if you depend on them to be happy you're putting your own mental wellbeing out of your own control as well. But if you can take the small little things and focus on them and let them be the main factor in how you feel your life is, you have a way, way better chance of being happy on average.  And none of that precludes enjoying big good things as well! But it means that big bad things are less likely to hugely impact your outlook on life. Because even when big bad things are happening, you still have small good things to help you along. You still have just a bit too hot showers that make you jump, and the cold side of a pillow, and that ozone smell when it rains."

It's a complete escape from daily life, and the feeling of getting everything (choosing the right wave, the run, drop, approach, and catching the wave) right and riding the wave back is orgasmic.   I think part of what makes surfing, skimboard, and most other board sports in general such a good mental exercise is that the goals and objectives are almost completely detached from the other aspects of your life. Landing that trick or catching that wave has value that applies only to you, it has nothing to do with your job or whatever else is causing you stress."

It just makes me think of how dumb these kinds of people come off, and I make it a point to never do that kind of crap: a little kindness goes a long way. When I see an old couple who are still together and still so much in love. They have probably lived through so many tragedies that I've yet to encounter or will likely encounter in my lifetime; they've probably argued over countless things and got into an untold number of fights, and yet after all the years they're still holding hands, or hooking their arms around each other's, still saying their favorite inside jokes or terms of endearment that they've long established before I was born, and it makes me so appreciative of the woman I have in my life and how much I look forward to having the same thing with her towards the end of the long road ahead. It just helps put all the struggles we've endured into perspective when I see that love indeed can last as long as both sides make it work. When I see just how far I've really come. I've had a handful of failed relationships, been poor most of my life, grew up in a broken home, been a loner through the pivotal social years of my teens and early 20s, came close to committing suicide, battled depression, and still have little progress to show for all the dreams and goals I've been searching for, but in spite of all that I'm still here trying to make it work. The more I try to tell my inner anxieties, worries of the future, and regrets of the past that they're all meaningless because the now is what dictates the outcomes of those thoughts, the better I do in letting go of the things that worry me the most and be happier in doing the best of what I'm capable of doing today. Sometimes things get more cumbersome than I can deal with, and whenever that time comes I tell my brain my favorite quote from a line in one of my favorite sci-fi shows of all time:  ""We have done the impossible, and that makes us mighty."""

AskReddit,3e2ho2,Aleadroleinacage,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:33:31 2015 UTC,":)  There was a thread yesterday on AskReddit about what people do when they're overthinking about everything, and the third point kind of ties in with some of the top responses I read in it.  A lot of the things we stress about are usually regrets from the past or worries about the future, and if you condition yourself to address those worries directly, it helps bring you back down to earth and worry less about what's to come or what's already past. Admittedly, it's pretty fucking difficult sometimes, especially when you have so much riding on finding success in both the near and long-term future, but when you think about it if you don't do the present tense well then that will adversely affect your future. So why worry about all that when you can focus your efforts on the now?"

Now what's the point of all this? What's the point of life? What's the point of your life?  Reproduction.  Everything you experience, you need, you do... is to carry forward the ancient dance that is Evolution. You are just a node of that algorithm whose sole job is to select and adapt traits that help, and carry forward in your gene.  What's the point of evolution? I don't know. Maybe it's to create, at the end, one super-powerful being that the gods will use in their fight. Whatever it is, It surely isn't your concern at all. As far as you are concerned, your job is to acquire good traits, reproduce and die. In the end, after billions of years, it won't matter if you as an individual were wealthy or famous.

The fact that you don't want kids doesn't hint towards the idea that your life is 'pointless.' Ultimately, reproduction is the key point to ensuring survival of the species but no person truly knows what the point of survival itself really is. I think life itself has become something that we've come to accept doesn't really have a deep meaning or significance, life just is, and will continue to be. Reproduction just ensures that certain life will continue to be, hence the emphasis we've come to put on it. It's one of the only factors of life we have in common with every other animal on earth and one of the only facts of life we know has been existing for millions of years, ensuring evolutions path, and bringing us here today.  A few members of a giant pack who think differently to the herd is a drop in the ocean. You not wanting children just means that your particular genes wont be passed on; they will simply end when you pass on. The desire to procreate has diminished based on the personal hard-wiring of your brain at the present moment. Does it make your life pointless? Of course not. It may just mean your being will play a different role in the overall scheme of things and your mind can be utilized to focus your energy on other factors in your life, which, have a point to you."

If I'm down, or I mess up, I just think...I'm one person in 7 billion. And that's a tiny speck in the universe. I dunno, just the sheer scale of how many people have lived before me and how many will live after, and knowing that that's not even a drop in the overall size of everything...Kinda puts things in perspective sometimes. Being in nature has the same effect. So I messed up a test, big deal! It's not even a blip on the radar. Life's short and then you're done, so enjoy it.

AskReddit,3e2ho2,Sumimi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:06:07 2015 UTC,"My sister.  Born with a 90%+ hearing loss, lived a life where her entire family and extended family spoke primarily Chinese. Needless to say, my mother was devastated when she found it, and we went through much, /much/ trouble to include her in everything we did. This was my childhood, over 20 years ago.  Throughout my childhood, I'm constantly reminded that I have to go out of my way to get her attention, to the point of frustration. My Sister never learned Chinese, instead she learned English (spoken) and American Sign Language. My parents never learned Sign Language, and I only learned the alphabet. To make matters worse, my parents were struggling to learn English as well. I still can't imagine how frustrating it is for her to not be able to follow conversations we have. A few years later (I was about 14), it turned out my Sister had invented her own way of figuring out how we spoke, and she gained fluency in lip reading.   By the time our household got internet, and cellphones became much more popular it became easier to communicate. But I made it a point to keep talking to her, lest she lose her ability to communicate with the outside world. Of course it was frustrating to me, having to repeat what I say over and over again until she gets it. I can't remember the number of times I've used new words haphazardly and had to spell it out for her to look up the word in the dictionary.  Eventually, my sister found her own life outside of the house. Little did my parents and I know, she got into professional volleyball in College and was eventually selected for the special Olympics a few years ago representing the Canadian team.  Now? She's happily leading a life as a Secretary, organizing and filing financial papers working hard, happy as can be. While she has her own share of issues, I can happily say she's happy where she is (some minor set backs). She moved out of Toronto this year, and chose to live on her own in Victoria. We keep in touch of course, but I'm going to drop a word here and say I do miss her.  Reflecting on all this, I can't help but feel that taking life serious results in an unhappy life. If you don't let yourself loose and broaden yourself you won't find what truly makes you happy. Had my sister done that, instead of perusing what she wanted, I will say her life wouldn't be like it is now.  Of course, as the older brother, I remember advising her to do what she wanted and not care about the consequences. I was told by an older lady on the bus that day that it was one of the most heart warming conversations she ever listened to."

I have to say, starting out my day every day singing ""Happy and you know it"" while watching in the rearview mirror as my daughter beams and laughs in her car seat behind me ... it's IMPOSSIBLE to be in a bad mood after that. I could have had the most rotten night's sleep, full of bad dreams, and then I dropped the milk on the kitchen floor and it was a huge mess and we were late getting out the door and traffic is going to be a disaster ... but then we sing ""Happy and you know it"" and we clap our hands and shout ""Hooray!"" and I just feel like the happiest person on earth.

AskReddit,3e2ho2,DruidMaster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:10:07 2015 UTC,"I honestly think about what it would be like to be a proto-human, having to live out in the uncomfortable and dangerous world with no other alternative.  I'd be living hand-to-mouth every single day, sometimes going days without a meal. I'd have basically no sanctuary other than the cave or thicket of bushes I scrapped together to protect myself from the wind and rain.  If I were lucky enough not to be separated from or driven off by my family group, I still couldn't communicate anything substantial to the people I care about.    The days might be rough, but the nights would be absolutely terrifying.  Just about the only thing good in my world - the warm, brilliant Sun - disappears.  And although it seems to rise every morning, that's no guarantee that it might not return the next time.  Then I think about how it would feel if my proto-human-self encountered one of the countless modern conveniences my actual self enjoys.  Like a faucet with running water.  What an absolute life-changer that would be for my proto-human-self.  Thirst, a very familiar urge, would swiftly become no more than a bad memory.  I might have spent days searching for water before I discovered this faucet; which by the way, is a glorious thing in and of itself.  My PHS would have never seen something as smooth, hard, and uniform as a metal faucet.  Regardless of the equally unbelievable stream of water, this artifact could be a cause for celebration as well.  Then I think about adding another convenience: say modern (durable) clothing.  Now I wouldn't need to worry about finding shade when the Sun is high, nor about retaining warmth in the middle of the night.  And once again, the colors, patterns, texture and design of this modern convenience would be stunning to my PHS, perhaps even enough to inspire my first contemplation of the Divine.  So you can see where I'm going with this.  Whenever I get pissy about something trivial, or whenever my mood is just plain rotten, I try this thought experiment.  I usually only takes one or two 'additions' before I start to feel giddy and thankful that it's not 20,000 B.C. and I don't actually live out in the wilderness."

Most of the members in my family are terrible at handling difficult situations and after watching these breakdowns for several years I just decided to let what happens happen. If something embarrassing happens just embrace it and move on. If you're doing poorly in a class don't freak out about it. Stay positive and try to find a reason to smile when you don't think you can anymore.

I wouldn't say I have completely become some wise wizard that understands life. But I know that whenever I face the times when I am so held up in things, my brain kicks itself and tells me about vanity. I have realized that no matter how much we try to change something or do something, there is only so much we could do. In the end, life is unpredictable, uncertain, and mysterious. We can always worry about the things of the future or even the past and forget to live in the present. We can always try to prepare or even predict for the future, but we will never know exactly what will happen. It isn't about what will be will be, but it is to change whatever we can change and accepting the things that can't and knowing the difference."

It's not that I'm not NICE to them, but I'm not as patient as I should be and I'm not as super friendly like some of the other rangers.  But when I meet people who are just nice, happy people, no matter their age or their looks, it just makes me think, dude, you could have been nicer to people throughout the day because they're human just like you.  It also kills me when I think about how I may have been impatient with a mother and/or father with kids in the car, like they're just out on vacation with their family and I wasn't as patient as I could have been.  It actually makes me tear up because who knows, that could have been my parents with us when we were younger, and it's just not right.  But I don't put myself down all the time.  If someone is taking their sweet time and I have a VERY LONG LINE OF TRAFFIC, which is most of the time, then I need to be impatient and direct with them.  But I don't need to be like that ALL the time.  I need to just relax which I am at times, and it usually works in my way."

Your boss in your weekend job is being a dick and putting the pressure on? Who gives a shit, neither of you will remember or care in ten years. Doesn't stop me being annoyed in the moment or stressed but it stops me carrying it with me and bringing a bad mood into the things I care about.  Also, I always try to see the humour in things. It's not always possible but it makes all life's little stresses easy to manage. My sense of humour can be incredibly morbid so there's very few situations I can't see the funny side of. Doesn't mean I can't be serious when I need to be but most things when looked at in the bigger picture just aren't that important.

I didn't know anything about the topic until I learnt it at school, so everything was new to me.   One day I was pooping, and after I was done I wiped and looked down at my brown creation. And to this day I remember the horror of seeing BLACK SEMEN IN MY POO. I was so scared ;_; How did semen get inside of me? I was still 12/13 years old, and I never thought about boys that way. I was panicking in the bathroom, because I wanted to ask my mum for help, but I didn't know how to explain how black semen got into my poo. I was worried about being pregnant, so instead of flushing it I shouted for my mum.   and she was just like ""girl, wtf. That's just broccoli which didn't get digested properly""  ""oh :D""  In science class semen was often referred to as the 'tadpole looking thing' so I just assumed they were black as well, instead of looking like hacked-up phlegm."

So I can set var i = toInfinity in the beginning of the for loop, since var toInfinity is already globally established to have the numerical value of 9000? I've been formulaically(sic) following (var = i; i some math expression #; i some math expression) like it's the holy grail of code when it comes to for loops. The threat of crashing keeps me on edge :c  As far as increments go, I intentionally made it i < 9001 since toInfinity will always be 9000 and cause the infinite loop for my meager attempt at a coding joke :) I would need to write ""toInfinity++"" after the console.log so the value of toInfinity will go up by one after each test... which should close the infinite loop.    (edit): so should the code look like this to force the infinite loop?  . var toInfinity = 9000;  . for (var i= toInfinity; i < 9001; i++) {  .      var toInfinity = i;  .      console.log(""And beyond!"");  . }  And to close the loop, can it look like this?  . var toInfinity = 9000;  . for (var i= toInfinity; i < 9001; i++) {  .       var toInfinity = i;  .       console.log(""And beyond!"");  .       toInfinity++;  . }"

Exactly!       I've been formulaically(sic) following (var = i; i some math expression #; i some math expression)    Crashing gives me anxiety. I know how that feels lmao. But the global(throughout most - if not all languages) is:  for (start condition; end condition; step condition). Anything can be put in those three areas, the start will run whatever is in there first, the end will check for a true/false after each iteration, and the step will run whatever is in there after each run-through in the loop. It's standard to initialize in start, check for end or i </> condition, and increment in step.      As far as increments go, I intentionally made it i < 9001 since toInfinity will always be 9000 and cause the infinite loop for my meager attempt at a coding joke :) I would need to write ""toInfinity++"" after the console.log so the value of toInfinity will go up by one after each test.   Can't say I didn't laugh. But! Since the i++ is in the step condition, it will make i 9001 after the first loop, so once checked in the end condition it will break out. to add a little flair (and to show understanding that for loops don't have a predefined rule) you could actually put the toInfinity++ in place of the i++! therefore i will never reach 9001, and it will still increment toInfinity every iteration. :-)"
AskReddit,3e37cc,TetrisArmada,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:58:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks again :D  So with the corrected code, the i++, from my understanding of it so far, is that it will increase the value of var i by 1 each time the test is run; and since we defined var i to equal var toInfinity, which is 9000, the code is already set up to close the loop since 9001 < 9001 is false?  So to make it run infinitely, I would need to remove i being defined as toInfinity, which should cause the computer to think ""Wtf am I testing over and over and over again?"", or would I get a syntax error saying that var i is undefined?  Thanks for the updates. I didn't think I could add toInfinity++ as a step condition within the parameter, being seeing as how I've assigned toInfinity in place of i in the for loop--and the fact that the i can be replaced with just about anything--makes sense."

If you start var i = toInfinity, it will start i as 9000 and won't ask questions. As long as toInfinity is defined as well. (var toInfinity = 9000). Then since it's checking if i < 9001 every iteration, it will happily say it's false (9000 < 9001) and keep on going. All it's doing is if checking, really.   It gets pretty tricky. You're picking this up quick, though. You'll get it in no time with practice. :D"

If you truly are eating right, keeping your diet balanced and making sure you're exercising regularly, it could be another issue.   Things as simple as Vitamin D (which a lot of people are low on), or a thyroid test could give you a good look at what may be going on. If you are a male, you could get tested for low T as well!  as /u/rustyoldtimer said, consistency is key. You need to stay consistent with your intake, output, supplementation, and sleep status.

You just slice them out, cooks do it every day. You might be kind of wasteful and not efficient at it but you could definitely cut out pieces of meat to cook. You could even just cook the fish whole, cut open and pick out the meat and eat it. Same goes for any other animal you kill, you might not really know what you're doing but you could cut out some hunks of meat to cook. If you walked up to a cow/pig/etc and shot it in the head you could cut out some slabs of meat if you were willing. And actually it probably wouldn't take you very long to get pretty good at it by trial and error."

AskReddit,3e14z7,Temjin,3,Tue Jul 21 13:32:11 2015 UTC,I think the problem with that show was that the main character was a caricature instead of a real person and the situation is extreme and absurd enough just to populate the world with realistic people instead of cartoony neurotic characters.

AskReddit,3e14z7,ChickenStrips45,22,Tue Jul 21 12:41:13 2015 UTC,"Oh god, I thought about this. This assumes a plague killed everyone except me. The first thing I would do... Secure resources and scout around for remaining infrastructure in the nearest city. I would want to get a transport vehicle maybe a truck and i would want to search cars and stores etc for water and food items with very long shelf life. I would fill the truck to the max. Next up would be to move along into rural areas because assuming whatever wiped out humanity didn't destroy the bodies. The decomposition / flies / rotting corpses would make the area disease hole from hell (not to mention the smell). I would settle into a home that is isolated  and then depart again continuing to stock up on water and food, but mostly water. I don't know if the tap water is safe to drink or if it is even working.  I would also have to travel to many a wallgreens and raid it for medications like Tylenol and antiseptic items. At this point antibiotics would have probably expired and i certainly wouldn't know how to use them or which one to use so prevention would be the best tactic health wise.  If all goes well and water is not an issue: Now that this is done I would set up a garden. It would be medium size and a quick raid from Walmart would yield the seeds needed as well as supplies to beat the sun and protect the plants. and have fresh produce. Otherwise i would have to live off of cambels chicken noodle soup and spaghettios which wouldn't be all that bad.  Next, fuel based power generation is loud and smelly and resource costly, i don't have mechanical skills. I would have to go around neighborhoods and steal solar panels off the roof.  I dont need power at night because humans are supposed to sleep at night anyway. This is where my plans would likely hit the biggest hitch. I have no background in electrical engineering nor will i know the voltage of each solar panels. I would need a high voltage meter and a transformer system to ensure a proper voltage to supply the home, this would take care of entertainment and HV/AC. The solar panels could be set up in the street because whose going to drive in it...certainly not Wilson.  Assuming at this point I don't kill myself on accident, I would pay many visits to the untouched dust laden shelves of the public library and learn about cooking as well as first aid / engineering and ofc countless works of fiction. Next i would hit gamestop and get every game they have and then visit retro game stores and build a collection of games dating back to pong. You guys know where i will go with this :^ )  This would keep me happy and normal for a decade but the isolation from people would fester like an infection in my very soul. Boredom and loneliness are the biggest hurdles if all went well. Eventually I think i would be done living and really start doing crazy shit. the shenanigans would be real. Although they would burn out quickly.  Next I would begin to travel to a lot of the state parks specifically focusing on forest regions and take in all the beautiful sights in this world. After the fun of exploration...  I guess I would head to an airport and try to find a privately owned plane. commercial ones would be full of rotting corpses hoping to escape the fate of humanity.  I have no experience flying at all but i did gain a lot of knowledge of it from the library. I would take off in a private jet if possible and just get to a safe altitude. While in the air I would try some of the liquors because I held off for a decade. And then it will hit me. I will become the death of humanity. I would fly the plane around until it ran out of fuel and plummet it straight into the ground, closing a chapter in the history of the earth."

AskReddit,3e14z7,Andrelucky9,10,Tue Jul 21 07:26:44 2015 UTC,"First, I'd have to get me some basic supplies.  Food, water, medicine, generators, and fuel.  I imagine I'm missing some things, but this should be a good start, and after that I can fill in whatever else I might need.  Then I'd need to stop by the library, or hop online, and do a lot of learning on how to break into places - hopefully without destroying anything, but also places that are a lot better secured.  Places like research labs/manufacturing plants for medicines, foods, water treatment, fuel refining, etc.  I'd likely spend a lot of time reading through a bunch of this stuff.  Once I have these more important things taken care of, I'll probably need to stockpile a metric assload of extra parts, tools, etc to maintain the things that I'll be using for the next however many years.  That way, when something inevitably breaks, I can fix it, and if it's beyond fixing, I'll have extras.  I'll need all the various fluids needed to keep a car running, multiple vehicles most likely.  I'd need to get a hold of hunting rifles, and learn how to use them and kill/dress/cook my meals, before it becomes my only source of food.  If there are cars all over the road, I'll have to borrow a nice big piece of construction equipment, and clear some routes from where ever I decide to set up a living space, and other areas nearby that I'll be frequenting.  Assuming I haven't missed anything, next step is to get a trailer, and find an area nearby with solar panels.  Assuming everything is still up and running, I'll need to do even more research, and get these wired into my living quarter's grid.  Again, lots of extras, for when something breaks.  Download as much info off of Wikipedia, WebMD, etc etc, for when I inevitably get sick, so I can treat it.  So now, hopefully, I've got a sustainable operation set up.  Maybe even in a couple different areas of town - just in case I fuck up, and burn my home down.  Once I have somewhere that I'll be able to go back to and not have to worry about supplies, a bed, or what have you, it's time to have some fun.  I'll go down to one of the local dealerships, and I'll snag one of those big trucks that haul cars.  And I'll put a few cars on that bastard - whatever I goddamn feel like, because this is Huoberg now.  And I'll bring those back to my place.  I'll fill one up, grab my ipod, plug her in, and blast that shit.  Then I'll make my way out to the interstate.  And I'll floor that bastard.  I'll drive all damn day, until that sun starts to set.  Once I've had my fill, I'll learn my ass how to fly a plane.  And I'll grab me a parachute.  And I'll take that bird up as high as I can, and I'll eject.  Maybe I'll do it twice, because fuck you, this is flight number your mom on Kiss My Ass Airlines.  You gonna tell me I can't?  He'll no you ain't, because you're not here no more.  Then I'll find me some explosives, or grenade launchers, or RPGs, or I don't know what.  Where?  Hell if I know, but it's not like I got shit to do.  I'll be sort of responsible, I guess - wouldn't want to blow a piece of shrapnel into my own face - but I want to hear some noise.  I want to feel that shockwave in my soul, motherfucker.  Oh shit, maybe I'll get some fireworks, too.  Not those shitty ass smoke bombs and whatever - I'm talking about the kind the local fire department sets of on the fourth of July.  I'll set a few off, and then I'll hook them all up to the same circuit and fire those bitches all at the same time.  Go ahead, call the police for disturbing the peace, I don't give a fuck.  Then I'll go into the forest and find me a bear.  And I'll train that mean sonofabitch, and he'll be my pet.  And I'll get a saddle, and I'll ride him through the wilderness, and just participate in some general badassery.  Aw fuck, that's even gonna be his name.  General Badassery, Chief in Command of the 41st Grizzly Regiment.  Because he's a goddamn bear, and I'd like to see you tell him otherwise.  And then I'd probably get bored, have a fap, and take a nap."

AskReddit,3e14z7,Brickowski7,7,Tue Jul 21 03:59:03 2015 UTC,"First let me preface this with the fact that I actually am a rocket scientist:  Head to DARPA HQ in Arlington VA, Groom Lake, China Lake, Edwards and Vandenberg and find ANY experimental energy or propulsion systems or aircraft that look promising. Then head to NASA Eagleworks and take whatever they've got on Warp Field theory or the EmDrive. THEN go to Lockheed Martin, University of Washington and University of Wisconsin and gather everything they've ever done on fusion reactors. Finally go to Kennedy Space Center with all my stuff and set up shop where the Shuttle Atlantis is being housed. Build a homestead to stay alive, set up as many solar cells as I need to keep power going, but spend every waking minute adapting the shuttle for spaceflight. Install a nuclear power source of some-kind. Preferably fusion derived from the High-Beta Rate reactor, but the Russians have some mini-fission reactors that they've been using for years. Take one of the old SpaceLab modules and install it in the cargo bay, strip out any research material and try to replace as much as possible with modern hardware. If it actually works, install an EmDrive, if not scrounge around for what ever remains of project NERVA. Now for the tricky part. Take whatever next generation air breathing rocket systems the military had under wraps and adapt it to act as a horizontal booster for the shuttle. Its only got to fly once, and no one else is gonna be using pieces of other aircraft so tear apart and modify as needed. Finally the really hard part. Go to UPMC Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburgh at Pennsylvania, University of Pittsburgh's Safar Center for Resuscitation Research and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and gather EVERYTHING they've got on suspended animation. Spend as much time as possible testing it on monkeys, dogs, etc, while working on the shuttle. Finally if and when I'm confident that I've got a working system, and after sufficient testing. Fuel her up with LOX Hydrogen and take off. I'd have the SpaceLab converted into a greenhouse with my ""stasis pod"" in the center. I'd plot a transfer orbit out system to Alpha Centauri, kill power for all but a beacon broadcasting an SOS in every language switching between frequencies (if the military had a halfway decent quantum entanglement system that I could cram on the shuttle I'd use that too), and crawl into my pod. Best case scenario I wake up in a few thousand years and am greeted by extraterrestrials, worst case scenarios I drift through space as a monument to mankind's stubborn will to explore. Either way, I at least kept busy for the last few decades of my life."

AskReddit,3e2qyp,WastelandMelody,15,Tue Jul 21 19:01:02 2015 UTC,"It's not that I hate it, but I'm noticing every game is super-focused on open world storyline.   On some games it works really well but on others it feels weird.   For example in the witcher 3, I don't like it when I feel like there is something important to do in the main storyline but I don't want to miss the 50 available side quest.     I missed how old rpgs would kind of get you to a certain area with the story and kind of maroon you there for a while so it felt natural to take a break from the main goal."
AskReddit,3e2qyp,Springheeljac,7,Tue Jul 21 14:59:33 2015 UTC,"Biggest problem with Witcher 3 in that regard was the side and main quests didn't snych up in terms of levelling - focus too much on the main, and you're overlevelled for many sidequests. Focus too much on sidequests and you're overlevelled for the main."
AskReddit,3e2qyp,Sablemint,4,Tue Jul 21 15:53:43 2015 UTC,"I think the idea was that they didn't want to make the sidequests mandatory so you could keep up with the level demands of the main.   Having said that, I probably would have done some level scaling, at least for the main quest line."
AskReddit,3e2qyp,urchigold,3,Tue Jul 21 16:36:15 2015 UTC,"Having the main quest scale would solve the issues people have with open world leveling. You're always overpowered in those games, but if you choose to ignore everything and do main you're underpowered. TW3 ""solves"" it by giving you tons of exp for the main, so now you're always overpowered.   Scaling the main quest while having fixed levels for the sides could be a good idea. It wouldn't work in a Bethesda game since those are very freeform, but for a linear open world game like the witcher or Dragon Age it could be the thing that fixes the problem for good. I hope someone implements it to see if it works."
AskReddit,3e2qyp,thehonestyfish,4,Tue Jul 21 17:22:52 2015 UTC,Agreed! Older Final Fantasy games did a great job of getting you going with the story while also opening up side-quests at a rate that wasn't overwhelming.

But they made doing so as difficult as they could. and with 13 they just threw the whole thing out. And Final Fantasy Tactics S? Yeah you didnt even fight the battles, you would just watch them play out. Which means its not actually a game.  But anyway. When the computer is controlling more characters on my team than I am, I have trouble feeling like im playing a game. Now some people who know me would be all ""But you like secret of mana!""

Next scene he's being carried out in a coffin. Maybe an hour later it is revealed that he never shot himself but was knocked out by the enemy.

AskReddit,3dy22n,bostwickenator,3882,Mon Jul 20 20:29:50 2015 UTC,"There's a branch of therapy called mindfulness that's about staying in the moment.  Runaway thoughts and anxiety are almost all about regrets and shame of the past and worry about the future.    Take stock of the present. Be hyper aware.  What's around you?  How do you feel at this moment.  Focus on one object intently, in detail.  Edit:  this is a branch of therapy, not a convenient trick; there's a lot to it.  People work for months and years, and there are tons of nuanced techniques.  Read a book or two about it before summarily rejecting it; I recommend Full Catastrophe Living.  Edit: book title"
AskReddit,3dy22n,Funkingthefake,369,Mon Jul 20 13:56:19 2015 UTC,Yeah I practice this a bit to calm my thoughts. I used to go over things in my head constantly at night and take hours to get to sleep. A helpful tip I was taught was to picture a flame and let your thoughts come and go into the flame. I imagine it to be something akin to going into the void state that Rand goes into in the wheel of time books.  It doesn't have to be a flame but let your thoughts come acknowledge them and let them go.

AskReddit,3dy22n,cudder17,691,Mon Jul 20 19:56:43 2015 UTC,"This works extraordinary well for me. Give myself an outcome of feeling only (not situational) for my day or whatever I am going to embark upon. Your brain is over thinking merely because it hasn't been given a direction to go in.    So, a nicer way to think of it is that it is giving you ALL the possible options and directions you could go.   It is laying them all out before you.   That is why it gets so ""noisy"" in there with our thoughts. But, if you will give it a direction to go....a straight up command basically of what you want to feel in any moment or event or for the day ahead of you....it starts to line up with that. So, the important part is to remember that you aren't saying ""I want this day to go really well.""   or ""I want this event to end up like this.""   You are NOT setting an intention concerning the actual outcome of the situation. You set your intention around how you want to FEEL. ""Today, I want to feel more at peace and calmer and clear headed than ever before."" ""I intend to feel confident in my decision about ______."" Then, your brain realizes.....""Oh...we are going to feel confident today...""   and then it quiets down with all the noise.      Hope this helps.   Basically...give it a direction to go...and it will stop giving you every option available to it to think about.  You don't have to have the answer either..you just have to know how you want to feel.     Let the rest fall as it may."

Are you going to be open and accepting of yourself and others, are you going to be mindful and ever in the present, is there something that you really want to focus on, an ambition, that you can constantly fall back on as your purpose for that day?

It was really soothing to sit in the darkness of the flight deck and mess with the lights, intensity of the instruments and switches etc...   As soon as the power was on the aircraft, all sorts of lights and whatnot would blink and flash, among them were the Master Caution lights.  If you pressed them, they would extinguish.    Years later, I was watching Apollo 13, the movie, and there is a scene where they have to correct the ships tumbling through space manually.  They did this by firing short blasts from the little blasty things that made corrections to the ships attitude and direction, while observing the artificial horizon on the instrument panel.  I started using that as a technique to calm my mind, especially if I couldn't sleep, by visualizing an artificial horizon instrument in my mind, and Master Caution and various other blinking indicator lights that I could ""extinguish"" by ""clicking"" on them and making adjustments to my position in space at the same time.

Warning:   This is something that needs to be done very consciously...very deliberately and very much on purpose.    It is not something where you just let it run and you aren't in control.     Imagine that you are the owner of all these thoughts.   And each one has a message for you.   They are trying to tell you something.   They want to get your attention.   Even imagine them as little children trying to get love from you.   They are at your door banging and trying to get in...but since you are ignoring them or at least trying to...they keep trying to get louder.     Write them out.   Just get them on paper and let them have an actual voice.   They want to be heard.   You can burn the paper after...or one of the best things you can do is RESPOND to the thoughts with the one thing that they have always wanted to hear.     You be their parent and tell them what they have always wanted to hear.   So, if you have a rampage of thoughts about something surrounding a mistake you made...or how you aren't doing what you thought you would be doing at this point in your life.    Listen to those thoughts....even write them down...give them a voice and then respond to them with what the best parent in the world would.    Literally talk to them.   Tell them that you are here for them...that you aren't going to ignore them anymore and that you believe in them.  They aren't worthless.  You understand they are scared and tell them that it is going to be okay.      I know this seems kind of crazy...but understand that the noise of the mind is literally our ""inner child"" conditioning trying to get through and be resolved.   If you will become the ""parent"" in this and let each fear and thought be heard and then you respond with love and kindness and compassion....they WILL be silenced.   All they really want is to be heard.    They have energy of their own.     The key is this HAS to be 2 parts.   1) actually listening to them (not if they tell you to do harm to yourself or others by the way...) but listening to them as a parent would sit down and listen to a child.    Understanding that they might be really confused or scared. 2)  Responding with love and by doing that...diffusing their fear....their anger.  Diffusing whatever they have been scared of all along."

The first one you sit down with will feel really scary.  I won't lie to you.   But being in the driver's seat is so much more empowering.   Knowing that you are literally there to love each of them back into oblivion. It may sound trite, but I use a visualization of sitting at a dinner table and all of these negative thoughts at my back door.   I imagine them as little children that all want to come in.   I let one in and I let them talk.   Milk, cookies...whatever.   They finally get to tell me why they have been so scared all these years. And then I love them like they have been wanting for all this time as well.   I tell them I am sorry for stuffing them down and ignoring them.  I tell them that I promise to listen to them from now on.   And I may not know what to do but I will listen.   I tell them that i love them...no matter how angry they get or what they say...I will always be here for them.  I am never going to leave them again. It usually results in a lot of tears but it has literally changed my life.   I used to walk around with this low-level anxiety at all moments and all times.   It is no longer there.    Am I happy 100% of the time?   No.    But I have this knowing that there is nothing that can ""get me"" anymore.

For me, the first 2-3 weeks are the worst.   You need to find a routine that works for you that you can stick to, to fill up that free time. Get into a routine that fits your lifestyle and stick to it.   Also, become aware of your own body and mind's state. Know what your warning signs are, and try to lessen the impact when you see it coming. Probably 80% of the time now, I can anticipate depressive episode coming on, and I'll have about 12 hours before it gets really bad, so I spend the rest of the day on myself- make a good meal, get a good night's sleep, etc. It usually makes the next day more bearable.

AskReddit,3dy22n,Snapped_Calcium,75,Mon Jul 20 17:36:17 2015 UTC,"For me, it just got to the point where I wasn't enjoying it anymore. Every time I smoked I would just wish I wasn't stoned but I just couldn't break the routine. I could be wrong here, but I think most stoners who want to quit have lost the enjoyment of smoking. For me it was just acting on that realisation that I was not enjoying myself and it just became a total waste of time (and good weed!). I still smoke from time to time but now I actually enjoy it when I do, I enjoy it now because it's a choice, because I've had time to totally clear my head, and because it doesn't feel like something I have to do to feel like myself anymore. It feels like a drug again so I'm very careful to be moderate and not let it seep into the rest of my life.. Just my thoughts.  Edited to add, I really enjoy dreams and lucid dreaming, and this acted as an instant gratification for not smoking because I would instantly have amazing dreams after just one day sober. Again though, just my thoughts.."

AskReddit,3dy22n,yosemighty_sam,62,Mon Jul 20 19:40:04 2015 UTC,"It was a combination of things. I got a new job that I really enjoy, it's hard work both physically and mentally, and that helps a ton. Used to wake n bake, and smoke during my breaks, etc. It was 24/7 smoking. But had to take a break to pass screening for new job, and once I started work again I simply refused to let myself smoke until after work. I couldn't afford to lose this job, and it's challenging enough that I couldn't do it baked.   I went almost a year like that. Then something else happened that let me quit altogether. Long story short I lost my sense of smell for many years, but a new treatment restored it. I could smell again, and to my horror I hated the smell of smoke. Made me nauseous. I just couldn't smoke anymore.   Could have started eating it instead, or vaping, but my job is going well, I'm enjoying the clarity, and just didn't bother to keep smoking. Took a month for the cravings to subside. It was rough. But on the bright side I'm not eating as much either, no more munchies, and I feel better with the healthier diet.   For stress I go hiking, golfing, or swimming. Anything physical. And that too has improved my moods.   It's really night and day, and truly shocking how clouded my thinking was. The really insideous thing about mental diseases, and addiction, is that by their very nature they blind you to what's really going on. Causality gets all twisted around and self serving.   Bottom line, exercise and healthy distractions are the key.  Good luck mate!"

I have pretty bad anxiety and runaway thoughts all the time. I smoke, but I have cut down a lot. I used to wake and bake, then smoke before I left work, and then smoke all night after I got home.   Now I just smoke 1-3 times after work, basically just putting a pinch of weed into the bowl and doing a 1-hitter.   But my girlfriend wants to move back to where she is from, Florida, and we're living in Washington where I have a medical marijuana authorization so I am pretty nervous about the move in general but compounding that with the inability to get weed legally has been stressing me out.   I don't really want to stop smoking but I have wondered if it might be good for me to only eat/vape and limit that to the weekends.   Anyway, I wasn't the person who asked you to clarify but I found what you said very helpful and I wanted to say thank you. So, thank you."

You're already halfway there by cutting back.  I'll tell you, up until this year I read and ignored advice like this all the time. I could have acted on the advice, but I wasn't ready. It took life kind of forcing me to do it before I realized how good that advice was, and how bad weed was for me.   I still get the runaway thoughts, but I have the clarity now to see it happening and now I simply refuse to get on that train. It took some mental exercise at first. I tried doing times tables in my head. Then I started memorizing Shakespeare monologues and just reciting them in my head instead of going down the rabbit hole. Felt a little crazy, but it was the tool I needed to break the habit."

I smoked because I was depressed (sorta still am, dealing with it, not the point) and it made me chillax for a few hours. But then I started depending on it and knew something needed to change. So I went to the store and bought hundreds of butterscotch candies (enough to last me a couple weeks at least) and started a new video game (I think it was skyrim). Whenever I thought about weed, I ate a butterscotch and played skyrim. Did the same thing with cigs a few months ago. I just replace those bad habits with less bad habits that are easier to quit.

Therapy is important because you need to deal with your real issues. Quit smoking completely for a while. Just suffer through the first couple weeks without it which will suck but after a while you'll come back from it. Just find stuff to keep your mind busy. Literally any hobby will help.

For example, RDJ's quote: ""Worrying is like praying for something you don't want to happen.""  You might read that and immediately nod.  What a smart guy.  Doesn't mean you'll stop worrying though.  You need to catch yourself doing it, and remind yourself of the gist to RDJ's quote (and there are so many that encapsulate the same logic).  You'll begin to train yourself and the way you think, but you have to be patient.

AskReddit,3dy22n,brandondase,67,Mon Jul 20 21:16:06 2015 UTC,Meditation helps me alot. I concentrate on my breathing and all of my senses at once. You dont think about much else when you ask yourself what do i hear? What do i feel? What do i see? etc. Work on slowing your breathing until it feels you are one with the air around you. Try and feel your entire body. Your heart beat and even the blood pushing through your veins. Ive actually scared my girlfriend a few times because she thought i wasnt breathing when i was just fine. I had just slowed my in and out to the point where it wasnt easily detectable. It takes some practice but it does become easier to clear your mind.
AskReddit,3dy22n,PrettySmartAndHumble,14,Mon Jul 20 16:16:44 2015 UTC,"This kind of meditation in my view just makes you kinda zone out. I feel like meditation while doing something is much more realistic. Cause   A) its easy to lose track of the speed of things when all youre doing is thinking, i.e. you have no reference point, and B) life is not just thinking.   A much better meditation is to go for a walk and just walk SO slowly, that every time your mind tries to worry or go crazy, just keep going slowly. There is no rational reason why any thought should be important enough to draw you away from your walk. Soon you will see everything around you will start to take on much greater detail as you actually pay attention to it."

AskReddit,3dy22n,SativaGanesh,50,Mon Jul 20 14:28:52 2015 UTC,"Hey OP,  hope you're doing ok. If not you'll get through this. My mind tools utilize some ""mindfulness"" techniques.  When you have a thought - DO NOT TELL YOURSELF TO STOP. Thoughts are like wildfire and telling yourself to stop is like dousing it in gasoline.  I suffer from pure OCD and have been diagnosed with anxiety issues. What I have done is this:  -when a thought comes. Don't tell yourself to stop. And don't try to fully ignore it.    imagine yourself walking on a side walk. the cars on the road that speed by are like thoughts. Now think about the attention you will give to a thought. As an illustration, one of these cars caught your consciousness, stoping you from walking and has your attention - even when it is now 10 miles away from you. Puts a lot of strain on he eyes right? That strain is like your mind going insane.   -acknowledge your thoughts. Say to them ""I know you're here  -give them time to roam. Now say ""I'm going to give you time to run rampant""  -focus on your breathing.   -here's what I have learned and I use as my trick: don't emotionally respond to it  The last one is a challenge. Depending on the thought we can get crippled by it. But it takes practice. The fuel for my ability to fight the thoughts is knowing that I have been through the standard anxiety cycle countless times - I should be able to handle it.  With practice, when a thought comes, and with following the other steps, the time it bothers you will decrease and decrease to the point that your mind just doesn't go through that specific thought pattern anymore.   So rather than putting gas on the wildfire you're letting the fire burn itself out.  Good luck"

My mind will try to wander but it's an exercise in refocusing, usually on my breathing. The key for me is to be grounded in the present, thinking of my breath, trying to slow my heartbeat, feeling my feet press into the ground, the focus is on physical sensation rather than what's going on in my head. Usually when it goes well I feel rested, like I just took a quick nap.

AskReddit,3dy22n,ParadoxParade,20,Mon Jul 20 17:17:54 2015 UTC,"Dan Harris gives a good intro.    Basically, set a timer and sit for 5 min and just focus on your breathing.  Your mind will wander and you will then say ""crap, focus on breathing!"" and you will repeat this for the entire 5 min.  Note: when your mind wanders you haven't failed; it is when you notice your mind wander that you have succeeded!  And this is a ""practice"" in that you are going to get better with time at noticing when your mind wanders.    The point then is, with practice during meditation, you'll be better during the rest of the day at noticing when your mind has wandered to things you shouldn't/would rather not be focused on."

AskReddit,3dy22n,StrukkStar,300,Mon Jul 20 21:12:08 2015 UTC,"I'll post my bad trip to help you understand what a bad trip really is(Hint, it isn't seeing spiders)  My bad trip occurred while I was living in Manhattan. I have never been much of a city person, always preferred nature, but I live in the city for college. I decide with my friend that I have tripped with before to drop then journey to central park. It was around Christmas time and we were all set to go.  Once the trip began I decided that I wanted to see what it was like to be homeless. I wanted to be able to understand what it is like, so I sat on the ground. I didn't beg, just sat there and watched people walk by, ignoring me. But it was no different once i stood up, everyone in the city seems to avoid eye contact. It was driving me crazy, I was looking for anyone, to be, human. As weird as that sounds I was walking around trying to have an human interaction with people and everyone was avoiding me like the plague. All I was doing was smiling, looking them in the eye and saying hello. And everyone blew right past me. It was very disheartening.  As we journeyed upwards we accidentally happened upon the Rockefeller Center tree, with THOUSANDS of tourists. Just dull eyed, people staring at the epitome of consumerism and over consumption. All I saw when I looked at it was the amount of money put into that instead of feeding the people freezing on the streets. I began getting really upset so I moved to the church across the street, and to my dismay there was a man there ringing a bell for charity yelling ""Money for the homeless""  Now I know what you think, why would that be terrible? Because the guy was classic businessman, clean cut, nice jacket, expensive shoes and a million dollar smile. He was selling charity. He wasn't trying to help the homeless, he was selling charity for stupid people who want to feel that they did something ""good"" when in reality they were consuming. I can guarantee that money was not going to be helping many people and that the man smiling at those over-consumers did not give 1 shit about the hungry homeless.  I escaped and tried to find my friend who I had been separated from. I convinced myself to try to find him without technology, because I believed that was causing this disconnect of humans from one another. I tried asking people if they had seen him to try to work together with people but EVERYONE avoided me again. I learned what it feels like to ask people for help and them literally DEHUMANIZE you in front of your face. It was the most horrifying thing I have ever experienced and opened my eyes to how cruel people can be.  I escaped and journeyed north until I came upon a homeless man on the street. I sat next to him and talked to him for a little while. He told me his name, some of his story, and how he was really hungry. He was sitting in front of a BK and I went to give him money, but I have a rule when I give homeless people money, I make them look me in the eye and promise to spend it on food. When Anthony(the homeless man) heard this condition he said, ""Don't give me the money, just get me some food."" I asked him what he would want, he motioned to the sign on BK for a chicken sandwich, I and I bought him 3 and fires and soda. He thanked me profusely and I looked him in the eye and said,  ""Life is hard, you know that more than anyone one of these 'people' around us. I want you to know that there are people that care about you, I care about you. I hope you have a great holiday.""  He teared up and I went along my way. I later tried to convince my friend to pick me up out of the city and drive me to Alaska but that didn't happen.  I learned that night to be real. To cherish human interaction, eye contact, trust, and help anyone in need. Anytime I see anyone, within reason(if I think they could hurt me I keep distance), that needs help, I help them. Whether its food, or simply saying hi. Homeless people are just that, PEOPLE. Don't dehumanize them, the on thing that separates you from them is a foot of concrete, and in the scheme of the entirety of the universe, that distance is nothing."

I'm sure he was getting ignored quite a bit as well.  I'm sure he would tell you that I was just rationalizing a close-minded, ""normal"" outlook. Maybe I am.

AskReddit,3dy22n,GetOutOfBox,7,Mon Jul 20 17:10:53 2015 UTC,"but see i go back to the idea that you will get what you want out of them. if you are empathetic by nature, that makes sense.  i recently found out that my grandpa is part of a goshute religion and legally can do peyote for religious rituals. i had a conversation with him about tripping recently and he says that most of the members don't do it anymore, just at the beginning. they believe they can achieve the same results from meditation. so they start off using it. but the real change in perspective comes from action, and the perspective shift can happen in any number of ways. he says psychedelics are just a lazy meditation strategy, i guess i tend to agree.   i definitely hold onto things i experienced while tripping, but i think the biggest things are things that i already knew inside, and it just gave me a new way of approaching it."

AskReddit,3dy22n,in-co8,57,Tue Jul 21 13:08:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's pretty much what tripping is like, being faced with reality much more raw than when sober, which is the opposite of what people might assume. Turns out being sober is kind of just another way of not being ""sober"" (or rather honest and rational) when it comes to a lot of things, because you get in a habit of tuning out the things that are weird or sad or scary.   That's the funniest thing to me about people getting drunk to escape reality. Most of the time being drunk makes me way more objective about myself and everything around me, but I guess it keeps me in a good mood on top of that so that's really the only benefit."
AskReddit,3dy22n,rdstrmfblynch79,9,Tue Jul 21 14:44:44 2015 UTC,"This is a very interesting way to look at it, for physiological reasons. LSD has recently been shown to cause connections in the brain that don't normally exist, which is why some people experience synesthesia (smelling colors or hearing a human touch).   In normal circumstances, the human brain actively culls the amount of information being transferred to it, in order to keep you from being overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of sensory information. Some disorders, such as certain kinds of autism, are thought to be caused by a lack of this ""filter,"" and we've found that deep brain magnetic stimulation can temporarily ""turn off"" the parts of the brain responsible for the filter in otherwise functioning individuals, enabling them to experience the world without said filter.  So, psychedelics could, in certain cases, be used as a way to alter your perception of the world around you, rather than as a way to simply hallucinate. Even when you return to a ""sober"" state, your mind has been altered by the new viewpoint, much as a powerful book or movie can do."

I know for a fact that my perception of risk is irreparably broken, so I trust past experiences or outside information much more than I trust my ""what if"" thoughts.  It's like driving in a car with a broken speedometer. At first, it might say you're going 90, and you start to worry that you're going to get pulled over. You slow down, slam on the brakes, and nothing seems to change number on the stupid dial.  But then you pay attention to the cars around you, and they all seem to be going smoothly. The speed limit sign says 50. You're going with the flow of traffic, so maybe you're going 50 like everyone else, and not 90.  Trust past experiences and outside evidence before you trust your own catastrophic thinking. The doubt will probably always hang around in some form, but if you no longer trust it, it's easier to deal with."

Over time, I started being more mindful of the ultimate goal of whatever I was doing instead of focusing on the small tasks that led to that goal. This let me start looking at smaller issues as bigger pieces of a whole, and it was a lot easier for me to stay relaxed about the little details when I knew that they were all helping me towards the ultimate, desired outcome.  Another way: by forcing myself to think about something else if I couldn't impact the issue. Awhile ago, I applied to work at Blizzard and was on and off a mess while waiting for the response. But here's the thing: no matter what conclusion I come to after I've sent in my resume, there's nothing that I could do to affect the outcome, so I forced myself to think about something - anything - else."

Something I thought about though was, I don't remember anything before I was born, and I don't remember anything from when I was like 1 year old, I know this can be explained, we don't register memories, but what if there's something before and after, and we just don't remember them.

AskReddit,3e0gyg,ThisFingGuy,42,Tue Jul 21 03:33:02 2015 UTC,"Death is inevitable, it's inescapable, one day you will end.  That being said, the single greatest threat to your life and knowledge of your existence is clinging to this thought.  If you become so obsessed with death, you run the risk of wasting your life being obsessed with something inevitable.  You run the risk of being remembered as a morbid person focused solely on death.  Rather, take a look at the little things.  Take a walk outside on a beautiful day, and appreciate every moment you experience.  I often think of my own eventual demise, and yet every time I pet my dog and he smiles, I simply return the smile.  It as though we both just live in that one moment, and that moment feels timeless and serene."

AskReddit,3e0gyg,FappyJacky,14,Tue Jul 21 02:53:34 2015 UTC,My grandmother reached this point. She was tired.
AskReddit,3e0gyg,Fluffysniper,18,Tue Jul 21 03:06:12 2015 UTC,"At least she lived a life, of what I hope to be filled with the love and care of her friends and family. My stepfathers aunt recently passed, and he was devastated. I have been around death for most of my life, most of my family has passed, but I know most of them died knowing that they have a legacy, my great grandmother passed when I was 6, and I still remember times when she would care for me.  Now, there's another side to this.  I don't want to die young.  I don't care what happens, if I go out, its after I lived my life, I understand its not up to me, but god dammit, I wont, no, CANT, accept death at 16, this is too young an age. My cousin died when she was only 2, her lung collapsed, and she wasn't strong enough to fight the infection that caused her to deteriorate. Ever since that day, she hasnt left my mind, I dont want to die YOUNG, everyone has they're time to go, but I want to go when I am old, peaceful, probably euthanasia. I try my best to make sure my clock doesnt run out on me too soon, I want to live to see my kid graduate college, and get married, and have kids, make memories, be there for my grandchildren.  I do not fear death, I do not embrace it. It is impending, and inevitable, and I WILL die one day, everyone will. But it doesnt matter to me.  Live life to the fullest, next time you see your SO, kiss them, hug your parents and and family, love and appreciate everything in your life. Make memories that will live on in the hearts and minds of those you touched, thats all one can ask for.   I may be a young 16 year old kid in the eyes of some of those reading this, but I believe I have a pretty mature and astonishingly happy view on life, for the shit cards that I've been dealt. At the end of the day, all I can ask for is to be remembered after I'm gone, and for some strange reason, I find comfort in that."

AskReddit,3e0gyg,jarviscoca,45,Tue Jul 21 01:30:54 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing you're in your late teens or young adulthood.  The existential dread of your own mortality is a normal part of adult life.  It's not pleasant, and you'll find that these thoughts will come and go.  If you can figure out what types of things prompt these thoughts, try to stay clear of them to minimize your discomfort.  If you ever feel really bad, don't hesitate to talk to somebody, a loved one or a therapist.   Each of us must resolve for ourselves the answer to your question, ""how do you handle it?"".  Personally, I haven't come up with an answer that I can't defeat when I'm feeling that dread, and I fear that the closer I draw to the hour of my death the harder it will be to suppress that feeling.  I don't believe in an afterlife, I like to think death will be a state of existence exactly like pre-birth, and that comforts me.  But the state of death is not what I fear, I fear the experience of death.  It is something each of us must do alone, and I hope that I acquire the courage in my remaining years of life to accept it.    The closest I've come to making peace with my mortality was while listening to some really good music and smoking some really good weed (I know, cliche).  In that moment I fully appreciated the beauty of life, and how lucky I was to get to experience it, and I felt guilty for being so greedy as to wish for it not to end.  The experience should be enough, at least that's how I felt.  So I guess my advice to you would be to try and cultivate that appreciation.  Also, know that you're by no means alone in these feelings, its part of the human condition.  I wish I could give you some magical answer to your existential crisis, but unfortunately no such answer exists.  Hopefully you see this and it does some good."

AskReddit,3e0gyg,dottmatrix,45,Tue Jul 21 00:36:46 2015 UTC,"I don't want to go into too much detail, but basically my therapist tried to understand where was the root of my problem (what triggered this anxiety) and recommended me some books, meditation and stuff. The way I see it, this is an inevitable thought to the human mind. The thing is: some people overcome that fear by believing in something (religion, for instance), others just don't think too much about it and are relaxed, and others, like you and me, get to think about it all the time and feel anxious and/or overwelmed. Honestly, I'm yet to accept that I'm going to die but I'm fully aware that's a battle I'm going to lose."
AskReddit,3e0gyg,OccamRager,29,Tue Jul 21 00:48:55 2015 UTC,"Those aren't the only possibilities. You can be someone who doesn't believe in any “higher power” (religion, etc.) and who doesn't avoid ever thinking about their mortality.  Most things have to end.    If you went to a concert from your favorite band, should you spend all the time there worrying that the music will stop in a couple of hours, it'll be over, and you'll have to go home, or should you rock out and enjoy the music? If you go to a movie, should you say “oh no, it'll be over soon and the characters will start to fade from my mind”, or do you enjoy it? When you get up, do you start the day anxiously worrying that the day will soon be over, gone forever. Do you worry that tonight you'll have to go to bed and the you who is conscious now will vanish forever, to be replaced with a new-and-purportedly-improved (but perhaps actually worse) version tomorrow, a thief who as stolen the memories you so carefully made, corrupted them subtly, and taken them as their own.   Yes, death looks pretty much inevitable, but if you spend the time you have morbidly worrying about your eventual death, you're literally wasting the life that you have.  Yes, the rock concert will end. But it can still be a damn good concert, right up to the end."

I avoid the subject of my death like a plague. I fully plan on living forever.  Sidenote: you know what's worse than the thought of death? The thought of being really old and knowing death is inevitable. Not like one day inevitable, like possibly next week inevitable. I look at old people and wonder how they deal with the thought that they could drop dead any minute and people literally expect it because they are old as fuck. My family is really bad for this, too. My grandmother lived to be 99. Strong as a horse up til her death. This lady walked a country mile through Georgia heat and humidity for fun! She still dropped dead randomly after a fishing trip.

Just believe that you will live forever if you can.   I personally don't worry about it because if I don't worry about it I'll die but if I do worry about it, guess what? I'll still die!

Embrace the beauty of life, the fact that we are alive is a sheer miracle, there is like  a 1/1-quintillionth chance that we are alive, so appreciate it, life itself is a miracle, and should be treated as such? Dont get caught up in the future, live in the moment, that's what matters.  I hope this helps you get through that rough patch, I know how it feels."

Real mundane stuff, ya know.   The song ""still haven't found what I'm looking for"" by U2 was playing. During the song, I was overwhelmed with the sensation of warmth, a love feeling. That was the moment I fell deeper in love with him, deep deep. I finally found what I've been looking for. It occurred to me, in this moment of deep appreciation, I realized that one day he won't be here and I'll only have these memories of us singing in the car being goofy in our 30's.   The thought of death made me appreciate and stay in the moment.   It was this freaky paradox of projecting about dying that kept me so present, really listening to him sing, feeling this intense emotion of ""God I love him so much, it makes me sad to know that one day it will end, because death.""   Thoughts of dying make me cry."

Being dead will be just like that no more being worried about money or kids or taxes or anything of the sort, no more worries at all just pure nothingness like the deepest of sleeps.  For me death is something in a way i look forward to it. Life is like a rollercoaster and while its fun you cant keep riding it forever eventually you will know its time to get off.

I was an early bloomer in the panic world. Yes, it is true, and it does keep me up at night still sometimes, and yes, the panic can still creep in occasionally, but the truth is, life is worth the price, even of death. Sure, none of us alive really knows for sure what comes after, some, believe it is a void, some, another life, others, an eternity. Either way, we all do know one thing, now, we are alive, for better or worse, it really is a gift as bad as it can seem sometimes. It becomes more of a strength than a weakness over time and you learn to cope. I personally have set beliefs of my own that I take comfort in. They have been proven to me, and for me in my life on my journey. Whatever is right for you will come to you in time and at the right time. Just hang in there and know that this too shall pass."

I came to the conclusion when I die, I'm dead. That will be it. I won't be waking up in another world or seeing family and friends I've lost. I don't remember before I was born, so why will I know anything when I'm dead. But at the same time I will still exist, because I am made of molecules, atoms, neutrons, protons, electrons and energy. All of that will still exist in one form or another when I am dead, because death is only the end of consciousness, but not really the end of our matter. All we are is stardust able to look back at itself.  After I had this crisis, I felt so much better about my life. It gave me a clarity. After I felt like I could finally live without the burden of other peoples expectations that had guided me for the entirety of my life (which at that point was only 20 years). James Toback said something along the lines of ""You cannot truly live until you are ready to die,"" and I completely agree.

AskReddit,3e0gyg,kellzone,4,Tue Jul 21 02:06:06 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing - you don't have to come to terms with it. We will all die some day. For some, that day was today. They couldn't stop it and neither can you or I. So don't dwell on it. Instead, why not think about things that you can change? How can you become a better person? How can you become a person that others will lament upon your passing from this Earth? But most of all enjoy the life you have now."

AskReddit,3e0gyg,corey561,4,Tue Jul 21 04:47:41 2015 UTC,"Well, I don't know for sure, but it's the most logical thing to assume with our current knowledge.  As for the point of life? That's for you to decide. It's hard to eat ice cream and drink alcohol if you're dead though."
AskReddit,3e0gyg,MovetoPortland,3,Tue Jul 21 05:25:18 2015 UTC,This is oddly comforting to me. I guess there doesn't have to be a point. Maybe I'm looking so hard for a point and meaning of life when I should really be enjoying the good parts of it while I can.

AskReddit,3e0gyg,libragliese581c,3,Tue Jul 21 00:44:01 2015 UTC,"No, it's not. You've got two choices though, embrace it or deny it.  What's even worse is that eventually the sun will go nova and wipe out all life on Earth. Every scrap of history will be forever wiped out. Not a shred of anything a human has ever done will survive. Doesn't matter if we inhabit other stars, as those will go nova, or super nova, or otherwise just fizzle out unceremoniously. In the end, everything will die and there will be no record of any life having ever existed. Big Crunch? Heat Death? However it happens, the end of the universe will come and with it the end of all life and history.  Work 9-5 for 50 years while denying your mortality. Retire when you're too old to live and explore the world around and then die anyway. Or live life and embrace what time you do have. Explore the world around you, explore your mind, enrich the lives of others, etc. Sure, plan your career and retirement (work is a fact of life after all) but experience what you can while you can, because soon enough you won't be able to experience anything ever again."

AskReddit,3e0gyg,dnick,8,Tue Jul 21 08:48:00 2015 UTC,"This is something I've thought about a lot since I was a little kid, and I saw one of those discovery channel programs on doomsday prophecies and the end of the world. The thought that the entire world might not exist one day really bothered me, and I couldn't understand how people would just go on living their lives not consumed by this. I was raised going to church and catholic school, but I never connected with religion. It seemed too simple to just think that if you go to church every Sunday you get to go to an eternal party in the sky with everyone you know and love once you die. I became really bothered by the thought of eternity, that once the earth is gone and there are no more new people coming to heaven eventually that would get really boring, and then you were still there for the rest of ever. I've recently gotten interested in quantum physics. We understand so little about what life is and how we perceive the universe we exist in. I find comfort in the fact that everything in the universe is made of the same thing and is connected. The fact that you exist means every thing that has happened from the beginning of the universe has lead up to this point right now. You're part of something so much bigger than the person that you perceive yourself to be. You're consciousness is part of the universe discovering and manipulating itself. It also gets crazy when you start to think about time. Time doesn't exist in the way we experience it. Think about traveling through time as traveling through space. As long as the universe exists you will exist in this little area of spacetime that you're in right now. I don't have a good enough understanding to really justify to you the peacefulness I get from it, but if you're interested in science it might help you to understand that you are part of something so much bigger than you can really comprehend. The universe is looking out for you"

AskReddit,3e0gyg,IBM_9001,4,Tue Jul 21 01:15:53 2015 UTC,"I think about this a lot. Like, a lot. What helps me is knowing there are so many possibilities after death. On one hand, matter can't be destroyed, so we continue on in some form. Time may not operate like we think, so the idea of an ""end"" is moot. We may experience quantum death (which is no death, really). We may become spooky ghosts or we may become nothing.   And if we do become nothing, we won't be around to care so worrying about how that will feel is silly.   All said, we really know so little about what makes the universe and how it all works. That leaves a ton of possibilities open."

The point is to make yourself part of an historical continuum that extends from your ancestors, through you, and onward. The story is passed to us from our forefathers. We add our few pages, and then we pass it on to those who come after us. Make your contribution the best it can be. Do not squander your time in useless worrying.

I don't think about it most of the time, but still, it's an incentive to do as much as possible in the time that I have, and worrying will not change things much. Granted, I am extra careful because I don't want to die, and I don't party much, but I have simply accepted it, slowly, and do my best to be kind and appreciate the simple things in life.

AskReddit,3e0gyg,libragliese581c,3,Tue Jul 21 02:47:49 2015 UTC,"You will die and it should feel uncomfortable. It should bother you to know that at some point you will no longer be able to be awed by a sunset. You will no longer be able to enjoy a lover's caress. All the books you haven't read will forever stay unread. This should all be incredibly tough to swallow because we spend most of our lives disconnected from the passage of time. In the relative blink of an eye, you will find yourself in an old person's body (if you're lucky enough to live that long) and wonder where the young person went.   The beauty of life is that it is temporary. The fear of death has driven so many people to make the most out of the time we have. Don't get that confused with fear of the afterlife, because that's a whole other bucket of worms. Your life will end, so do what you want with it when you can. That doesn't mean to be selfish, but to be the person you want to be. Some times will be better than others, but don't let some troubling days/weeks/months hold you back from enjoying the universe while you have a chance.   What you should look out for is feeling no discomfort in thoughts of death. That's truly scary."

AskReddit,3e0gyg,cuddleholic,3,Tue Jul 21 04:30:37 2015 UTC,"I'm 29 now. I have been thinking about it steadily since I was 18. At 25 my youthful invincibility wore off after a few classmates of mine died in quick succession. Since then my thoughts of death have been accompanied by that famous angst. Neither science nor philosophy can help you out. No doctor or mathematician or philosopher can make it OK. You're on your own on this one.  I've often thought of posting this exact askreddit, but realised I would only get two types of answers. One, people who completely miss the mark and have yet to get to an understanding of personal demise that involves total self-effacement. They say things like ""but your spirit will live on in the memories of others,"" or some other comment that barely veils their hidden faith in an afterlife and subjective continuity. Two, I would get answers from people in the same place I am, hung-up on their own mortality.  There is no third type of answer, because no one actually comes to grips with death. Anyone who says they have is either full of shit, unknowingly drowned the problem in some type of spirituality, or is already suicidal (and I would argue these types also have an insufficient understanding of death).  And that is really the only solace. You can never come to terms with it, you can only mitigate the angst. I always try to recall the three following bits, they seem to help somewhat and I'm fairly confident they are true:   The fear is normal. The animal in you fears death. The human in you grew out of that animal brain, and so no matter how complex it has become, it still springs from the tension between life and death. Being scared shitless is natural, for lack of a better word. You will never have to know you're dead. The intellectual fear of death comes from the ego - what will the world be like for you when you no longer exist? The answer: it won't. Everyone has the same fear as you, whether they know it or not. Anyone who has had presence of mind at the final moment has been gripped by the same terror. Every human to have lived and died has faced the same music. Everyone alive today will face that tune. Presumably, everyone ever will, at some point, be eradicated. You are so alone, but so is everyone else."

I had a life planned out with little urgency - even before this disorder, I had gone back to college because I thought 35 would be a keen age to begin a new career. I budgeted and planned for retirement and learned how to negotiate for compensation packages that would prepare me for a sweet easy life leading into a death that had me leaving this world feeling fulfilled.   Suddenly, now, there would be no time for retirement. Even continuing on in my chosen field, I won't graduate soon enough to work for one agency long enough to let benefits mature. I don't have the time to travel like I wanted. I don't have the time to complete that giant painting I want to finish, master Scrabble, find someone to love, know my place in the world...  Suddenly, the possibility of going to the grave unfulfilled is there. Within the minutes it took to read a few photocopied leaflets, the fact that I may die without actually finishing life was a thought in my head for the first time.   It hit me like a ton of bricks. I'm not handling it well at all. Yeah, sure, I have like 30-35 years left in my life but I just don't have any motivation to do anything with them. The physical disability prevents me from enjoying life the way I used to. It's really no life at all. Perhaps I'm not seriously thinking of the fact that I will die at some point - I'm dealing with the fact that I'm dying as we speak."

Death is not a thing for you. Only existence in various places. For op, death is the opposite of life. For you, death isn't an option.

AskReddit,3e0gyg,DevilsAdvocate77,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:19:51 2015 UTC,"I think about death every time I'm in a plane as it takes off. Intellectually, I know it's very unlikely, but with flying the possibility of death is much more apparent than with riskier activities like driving. Maybe it's the lack of control. You see the ground fall away and you know you're only one mishap from oblivion, and there's absolutely nothing you could do about it.  It's not that I'm afraid. I actually really enjoy flying. But it does make me think about death for a moment. And what does it mean? This bundle of atoms I borrowed from the universe and swish around in the patterns I call myself will all wander off to do other things. It doesn't seem so bad, really. I'm in no hurry to die, but when it happens, it's not like I'll be there to feel sad about it. In that way it reminds me to appreciate the current moment while I can. I like that."

AskReddit,3e0gyg,just_dots,2,Tue Jul 21 03:11:36 2015 UTC,Death is like this chasm people view as being the end of the road. Like a crack in the earth leading to darkness. Most people slowly journey toward that crack then fall into it (death). There's some people though..where death is behind them. They've just come to accept it and they'll go back to it.

I've seen them grieve for a sister, a grandfather, and several other family members and that's what frightens me.  They are both young adults but I literally lose sleep thinking about it.

How do you feel at this moment.  Focus on one object intently, in detail.  Edit:  this is a branch of therapy, not a convenient trick; there's a lot to it.

AskReddit,3dy22n,cudder17,691,Mon Jul 20 19:56:43 2015 UTC,"This works extraordinary well for me. Give myself an outcome of feeling only (not situational) for my day or whatever I am going to embark upon. Your brain is over thinking merely because it hasn't been given a direction to go in.    So, a nicer way to think of it is that it is giving you ALL the possible options and directions you could go.   It is laying them all out before you.   That is why it gets so ""noisy"" in there with our thoughts. But, if you will give it a direction to go....a straight up command basically of what you want to feel in any moment or event or for the day ahead of you....it starts to line up with that. So, the important part is to remember that you aren't saying ""I want this day to go really well.""   or ""I want this event to end up like this.""   You are NOT setting an intention concerning the actual outcome of the situation. You set your intention around how you want to FEEL. ""Today, I want to feel more at peace and calmer and clear headed than ever before."" ""I intend to feel confident in my decision about ______."" Then, your brain realizes.....""Oh...we are going to feel confident today...""   and then it quiets down with all the noise.      Hope this helps.   Basically...give it a direction to go...and it will stop giving you every option available to it to think about.  You don't have to have the answer either..you just have to know how you want to feel.     Let the rest fall as it may."

It's easy to get derailed and lose it.  But I try to think of it like a filter or a lens through which I or you will see everything that day through.  Are you going to be open and accepting of yourself and others, are you going to be mindful and ever in the present, is there something that you really want to focus on, an ambition, that you can constantly fall back on as your purpose for that day?  When you settle on that thing, the rest of your tasks/actions sort of fall into place under that purview.

AskReddit,3dy22n,Epledryyk,539,Mon Jul 20 19:42:48 2015 UTC,"I used on work on fighter jets,  and sat in the cockpit doing 'electrical inspections' on the instrument panels often.  It was really soothing to sit in the darkness of the flight deck and mess with the lights, intensity of the instruments and switches etc...   As soon as the power was on the aircraft, all sorts of lights and whatnot would blink and flash, among them were the Master Caution lights.  If you pressed them, they would extinguish.    Years later, I was watching Apollo 13, the movie, and there is a scene where they have to correct the ships tumbling through space manually.  They did this by firing short blasts from the little blasty things that made corrections to the ships attitude and direction, while observing the artificial horizon on the instrument panel.  I started using that as a technique to calm my mind, especially if I couldn't sleep, by visualizing an artificial horizon instrument in my mind, and Master Caution and various other blinking indicator lights that I could ""extinguish"" by ""clicking"" on them and making adjustments to my position in space at the same time.

AskReddit,3dy22n,movinonup2east,250,Mon Jul 20 19:21:11 2015 UTC,"Another way is to finally listen.    Warning:   This is something that needs to be done very consciously...very deliberately and very much on purpose.    It is not something where you just let it run and you aren't in control.     Imagine that you are the owner of all these thoughts.   And each one has a message for you.   They are trying to tell you something.   They want to get your attention.   Even imagine them as little children trying to get love from you.   They are at your door banging and trying to get in...but since you are ignoring them or at least trying to...they keep trying to get louder.     Write them out.   Just get them on paper and let them have an actual voice.   They want to be heard.   You can burn the paper after...or one of the best things you can do is RESPOND to the thoughts with the one thing that they have always wanted to hear.     You be their parent and tell them what they have always wanted to hear.   So, if you have a rampage of thoughts about something surrounding a mistake you made...or how you aren't doing what you thought you would be doing at this point in your life.    Listen to those thoughts....even write them down...give them a voice and then respond to them with what the best parent in the world would.    Literally talk to them.   Tell them that you are here for them...that you aren't going to ignore them anymore and that you believe in them.  They aren't worthless.  You understand they are scared and tell them that it is going to be okay.      I know this seems kind of crazy...but understand that the noise of the mind is literally our ""inner child"" conditioning trying to get through and be resolved.   If you will become the ""parent"" in this and let each fear and thought be heard and then you respond with love and kindness and compassion....they WILL be silenced.   All they really want is to be heard.    They have energy of their own.     The key is this HAS to be 2 parts.   1) actually listening to them (not if they tell you to do harm to yourself or others by the way...) but listening to them as a parent would sit down and listen to a child.    Understanding that they might be really confused or scared. 2)  Responding with love and by doing that...diffusing their fear....their anger.  Diffusing whatever they have been scared of all along."

The first one you sit down with will feel really scary.  I won't lie to you.   But being in the driver's seat is so much more empowering.   Knowing that you are literally there to love each of them back into oblivion. It may sound trite, but I use a visualization of sitting at a dinner table and all of these negative thoughts at my back door.   I imagine them as little children that all want to come in.   I let one in and I let them talk.   Milk, cookies...whatever.   They finally get to tell me why they have been so scared all these years. And then I love them like they have been wanting for all this time as well.   I tell them I am sorry for stuffing them down and ignoring them.  I tell them that I promise to listen to them from now on.   And I may not know what to do but I will listen.   I tell them that i love them...no matter how angry they get or what they say...I will always be here for them.  I am never going to leave them again. It usually results in a lot of tears but it has literally changed my life.   I used to walk around with this low-level anxiety at all moments and all times.   It is no longer there.    Am I happy 100% of the time?   No.    But I have this knowing that there is nothing that can ""get me"" anymore.   Because if it shows up, I know it is just there knocking on my door...asking me to love it.    And I can do that now.    It has taken some courage....but I can finally do that."

When you quit, not only does your brain chemistry get imbalanced, you also end up with a lot of free time. The combination of brain imbalance and free time is brutal. For me, the first 2-3 weeks are the worst.   You need to find a routine that works for you that you can stick to, to fill up that free time. Get into a routine that fits your lifestyle and stick to it.   Also, become aware of your own body and mind's state. Know what your warning signs are, and try to lessen the impact when you see it coming. Probably 80% of the time now, I can anticipate depressive episode coming on, and I'll have about 12 hours before it gets really bad, so I spend the rest of the day on myself- make a good meal, get a good night's sleep, etc. It usually makes the next day more bearable.

Every time I smoked I would just wish I wasn't stoned but I just couldn't break the routine. I could be wrong here, but I think most stoners who want to quit have lost the enjoyment of smoking. For me it was just acting on that realisation that I was not enjoying myself and it just became a total waste of time (and good weed!). I still smoke from time to time but now I actually enjoy it when I do, I enjoy it now because it's a choice, because I've had time to totally clear my head, and because it doesn't feel like something I have to do to feel like myself anymore. It feels like a drug again so I'm very careful to be moderate and not let it seep into the rest of my life.. Just my thoughts.  Edited to add, I really enjoy dreams and lucid dreaming, and this acted as an instant gratification for not smoking because I would instantly have amazing dreams after just one day sober.

AskReddit,3dy22n,yosemighty_sam,62,Mon Jul 20 19:40:04 2015 UTC,"It was a combination of things. I got a new job that I really enjoy, it's hard work both physically and mentally, and that helps a ton. Used to wake n bake, and smoke during my breaks, etc. It was 24/7 smoking. But had to take a break to pass screening for new job, and once I started work again I simply refused to let myself smoke until after work. I couldn't afford to lose this job, and it's challenging enough that I couldn't do it baked.   I went almost a year like that. Then something else happened that let me quit altogether. Long story short I lost my sense of smell for many years, but a new treatment restored it. I could smell again, and to my horror I hated the smell of smoke. Made me nauseous. I just couldn't smoke anymore.   Could have started eating it instead, or vaping, but my job is going well, I'm enjoying the clarity, and just didn't bother to keep smoking. Took a month for the cravings to subside. It was rough. But on the bright side I'm not eating as much either, no more munchies, and I feel better with the healthier diet.   For stress I go hiking, golfing, or swimming. Anything physical. And that too has improved my moods.   It's really night and day, and truly shocking how clouded my thinking was. The really insideous thing about mental diseases, and addiction, is that by their very nature they blind you to what's really going on. Causality gets all twisted around and self serving.   Bottom line, exercise and healthy distractions are the key.  Good luck mate!"

I have pretty bad anxiety and runaway thoughts all the time. I smoke, but I have cut down a lot. I used to wake and bake, then smoke before I left work, and then smoke all night after I got home.   Now I just smoke 1-3 times after work, basically just putting a pinch of weed into the bowl and doing a 1-hitter.   But my girlfriend wants to move back to where she is from, Florida, and we're living in Washington where I have a medical marijuana authorization so I am pretty nervous about the move in general but compounding that with the inability to get weed legally has been stressing me out.   I don't really want to stop smoking but I have wondered if it might be good for me to only eat/vape and limit that to the weekends.   Anyway, I wasn't the person who asked you to clarify but I found what you said very helpful and I wanted to say thank you. So, thank you."

You're already halfway there by cutting back.  I'll tell you, up until this year I read and ignored advice like this all the time. I could have acted on the advice, but I wasn't ready. It took life kind of forcing me to do it before I realized how good that advice was, and how bad weed was for me.   I still get the runaway thoughts, but I have the clarity now to see it happening and now I simply refuse to get on that train. It took some mental exercise at first. I tried doing times tables in my head. Then I started memorizing Shakespeare monologues and just reciting them in my head instead of going down the rabbit hole. Felt a little crazy, but it was the tool I needed to break the habit."

I smoked because I was depressed (sorta still am, dealing with it, not the point) and it made me chillax for a few hours. But then I started depending on it and knew something needed to change. So I went to the store and bought hundreds of butterscotch candies (enough to last me a couple weeks at least) and started a new video game (I think it was skyrim). Whenever I thought about weed, I ate a butterscotch and played skyrim. Did the same thing with cigs a few months ago. I just replace those bad habits with less bad habits that are easier to quit.

Therapy is important because you need to deal with your real issues. Quit smoking completely for a while. Just suffer through the first couple weeks without it which will suck but after a while you'll come back from it. Just find stuff to keep your mind busy. Literally any hobby will help.

For example, RDJ's quote: ""Worrying is like praying for something you don't want to happen.""  You might read that and immediately nod.  What a smart guy.  Doesn't mean you'll stop worrying though.  You need to catch yourself doing it, and remind yourself of the gist to RDJ's quote (and there are so many that encapsulate the same logic).  You'll begin to train yourself and the way you think, but you have to be patient.

AskReddit,3dy22n,brandondase,67,Mon Jul 20 21:16:06 2015 UTC,Meditation helps me alot. I concentrate on my breathing and all of my senses at once. You dont think about much else when you ask yourself what do i hear? What do i feel? What do i see? etc. Work on slowing your breathing until it feels you are one with the air around you. Try and feel your entire body. Your heart beat and even the blood pushing through your veins. Ive actually scared my girlfriend a few times because she thought i wasnt breathing when i was just fine. I had just slowed my in and out to the point where it wasnt easily detectable. It takes some practice but it does become easier to clear your mind.
AskReddit,3dy22n,PrettySmartAndHumble,14,Mon Jul 20 16:16:44 2015 UTC,"This kind of meditation in my view just makes you kinda zone out. I feel like meditation while doing something is much more realistic. Cause   A) its easy to lose track of the speed of things when all youre doing is thinking, i.e. you have no reference point, and B) life is not just thinking.   A much better meditation is to go for a walk and just walk SO slowly, that every time your mind tries to worry or go crazy, just keep going slowly. There is no rational reason why any thought should be important enough to draw you away from your walk. Soon you will see everything around you will start to take on much greater detail as you actually pay attention to it."

AskReddit,3dy22n,SativaGanesh,50,Mon Jul 20 14:28:52 2015 UTC,"Hey OP,  hope you're doing ok. If not you'll get through this. My mind tools utilize some ""mindfulness"" techniques.  When you have a thought - DO NOT TELL YOURSELF TO STOP. Thoughts are like wildfire and telling yourself to stop is like dousing it in gasoline.  I suffer from pure OCD and have been diagnosed with anxiety issues. What I have done is this:  -when a thought comes. Don't tell yourself to stop. And don't try to fully ignore it.    imagine yourself walking on a side walk. the cars on the road that speed by are like thoughts. Now think about the attention you will give to a thought. As an illustration, one of these cars caught your consciousness, stoping you from walking and has your attention - even when it is now 10 miles away from you. Puts a lot of strain on he eyes right? That strain is like your mind going insane.   -acknowledge your thoughts. Say to them ""I know you're here  -give them time to roam. Now say ""I'm going to give you time to run rampant""  -focus on your breathing.   -here's what I have learned and I use as my trick: don't emotionally respond to it  The last one is a challenge. Depending on the thought we can get crippled by it. But it takes practice. The fuel for my ability to fight the thoughts is knowing that I have been through the standard anxiety cycle countless times - I should be able to handle it.  With practice, when a thought comes, and with following the other steps, the time it bothers you will decrease and decrease to the point that your mind just doesn't go through that specific thought pattern anymore.   So rather than putting gas on the wildfire you're letting the fire burn itself out.  Good luck"

My mind will try to wander but it's an exercise in refocusing, usually on my breathing. The key for me is to be grounded in the present, thinking of my breath, trying to slow my heartbeat, feeling my feet press into the ground, the focus is on physical sensation rather than what's going on in my head. Usually when it goes well I feel rested, like I just took a quick nap.  I have a tape of Tibetan bells I'll sometimes play, when I first learned to meditate it was to Tibetan bells, they're beautiful the way they drone and oscillate."

AskReddit,3dy22n,ParadoxParade,20,Mon Jul 20 17:17:54 2015 UTC,"Dan Harris gives a good intro.    Basically, set a timer and sit for 5 min and just focus on your breathing.  Your mind will wander and you will then say ""crap, focus on breathing!"" and you will repeat this for the entire 5 min.  Note: when your mind wanders you haven't failed; it is when you notice your mind wander that you have succeeded!  And this is a ""practice"" in that you are going to get better with time at noticing when your mind wanders.    The point then is, with practice during meditation, you'll be better during the rest of the day at noticing when your mind has wandered to things you shouldn't/would rather not be focused on."

AskReddit,3dy22n,StrukkStar,300,Mon Jul 20 21:12:08 2015 UTC,"I'll post my bad trip to help you understand what a bad trip really is(Hint, it isn't seeing spiders)  My bad trip occurred while I was living in Manhattan. I have never been much of a city person, always preferred nature, but I live in the city for college. I decide with my friend that I have tripped with before to drop then journey to central park. It was around Christmas time and we were all set to go.  Once the trip began I decided that I wanted to see what it was like to be homeless. I wanted to be able to understand what it is like, so I sat on the ground. I didn't beg, just sat there and watched people walk by, ignoring me. But it was no different once i stood up, everyone in the city seems to avoid eye contact. It was driving me crazy, I was looking for anyone, to be, human. As weird as that sounds I was walking around trying to have an human interaction with people and everyone was avoiding me like the plague. All I was doing was smiling, looking them in the eye and saying hello. And everyone blew right past me. It was very disheartening.  As we journeyed upwards we accidentally happened upon the Rockefeller Center tree, with THOUSANDS of tourists. Just dull eyed, people staring at the epitome of consumerism and over consumption. All I saw when I looked at it was the amount of money put into that instead of feeding the people freezing on the streets. I began getting really upset so I moved to the church across the street, and to my dismay there was a man there ringing a bell for charity yelling ""Money for the homeless""  Now I know what you think, why would that be terrible? Because the guy was classic businessman, clean cut, nice jacket, expensive shoes and a million dollar smile. He was selling charity. He wasn't trying to help the homeless, he was selling charity for stupid people who want to feel that they did something ""good"" when in reality they were consuming. I can guarantee that money was not going to be helping many people and that the man smiling at those over-consumers did not give 1 shit about the hungry homeless.  I escaped and tried to find my friend who I had been separated from. I convinced myself to try to find him without technology, because I believed that was causing this disconnect of humans from one another. I tried asking people if they had seen him to try to work together with people but EVERYONE avoided me again. I learned what it feels like to ask people for help and them literally DEHUMANIZE you in front of your face. It was the most horrifying thing I have ever experienced and opened my eyes to how cruel people can be.  I escaped and journeyed north until I came upon a homeless man on the street. I sat next to him and talked to him for a little while. He told me his name, some of his story, and how he was really hungry. He was sitting in front of a BK and I went to give him money, but I have a rule when I give homeless people money, I make them look me in the eye and promise to spend it on food. When Anthony(the homeless man) heard this condition he said, ""Don't give me the money, just get me some food."" I asked him what he would want, he motioned to the sign on BK for a chicken sandwich, I and I bought him 3 and fires and soda. He thanked me profusely and I looked him in the eye and said,  ""Life is hard, you know that more than anyone one of these 'people' around us. I want you to know that there are people that care about you, I care about you. I hope you have a great holiday.""  He teared up and I went along my way. I later tried to convince my friend to pick me up out of the city and drive me to Alaska but that didn't happen.  I learned that night to be real. To cherish human interaction, eye contact, trust, and help anyone in need. Anytime I see anyone, within reason(if I think they could hurt me I keep distance), that needs help, I help them. Whether its food, or simply saying hi. Homeless people are just that, PEOPLE. Don't dehumanize them, the on thing that separates you from them is a foot of concrete, and in the scheme of the entirety of the universe, that distance is nothing."

Most of the time being drunk makes me way more objective about myself and everything around me, but I guess it keeps me in a good mood on top of that so that's really the only benefit."
AskReddit,3dy22n,rdstrmfblynch79,9,Tue Jul 21 14:44:44 2015 UTC,"This is a very interesting way to look at it, for physiological reasons. LSD has recently been shown to cause connections in the brain that don't normally exist, which is why some people experience synesthesia (smelling colors or hearing a human touch).   In normal circumstances, the human brain actively culls the amount of information being transferred to it, in order to keep you from being overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of sensory information. Some disorders, such as certain kinds of autism, are thought to be caused by a lack of this ""filter,"" and we've found that deep brain magnetic stimulation can temporarily ""turn off"" the parts of the brain responsible for the filter in otherwise functioning individuals, enabling them to experience the world without said filter.  So, psychedelics could, in certain cases, be used as a way to alter your perception of the world around you, rather than as a way to simply hallucinate. Even when you return to a ""sober"" state, your mind has been altered by the new viewpoint, much as a powerful book or movie can do."

He is, literally, some kid strung out on hallucinogens in the streets. 99% of the public would actively avoid such a character. I'll wager he looked and sounded friggin' crazy.

I spent about an hour away from them laying down on a bed of moss, trying not to think about anything stressful, but enjoy the moment. It was tough cuz of how powerful some of the waves were, but when I started to become more functional, I realized I was having a great time and only focusing on the right things.

AskReddit,3dy22n,-Caerus-,16,Mon Jul 20 20:44:17 2015 UTC,"Oddly enough, I think dealing with OCD has made me much better at stopping my overthinking. I know for a fact that my perception of risk is irreparably broken, so I trust past experiences or outside information much more than I trust my ""what if"" thoughts.  It's like driving in a car with a broken speedometer. At first, it might say you're going 90, and you start to worry that you're going to get pulled over. You slow down, slam on the brakes, and nothing seems to change number on the stupid dial.  But then you pay attention to the cars around you, and they all seem to be going smoothly. The speed limit sign says 50. You're going with the flow of traffic, so maybe you're going 50 like everyone else, and not 90.  Trust past experiences and outside evidence before you trust your own catastrophic thinking. The doubt will probably always hang around in some form, but if you no longer trust it, it's easier to deal with."

I'm in my early thirties now, but when I was younger I would absolutely overthink almost every decision or small detail, whether it was about work or my personal life. Over time, I started being more mindful of the ultimate goal of whatever I was doing instead of focusing on the small tasks that led to that goal. This let me start looking at smaller issues as bigger pieces of a whole, and it was a lot easier for me to stay relaxed about the little details when I knew that they were all helping me towards the ultimate, desired outcome.  Another way: by forcing myself to think about something else if I couldn't impact the issue. Awhile ago, I applied to work at Blizzard and was on and off a mess while waiting for the response. But here's the thing: no matter what conclusion I come to after I've sent in my resume, there's nothing that I could do to affect the outcome, so I forced myself to think about something - anything - else."

AskReddit,3e2ikh,beetnemesis,2,Tue Jul 21 13:44:55 2015 UTC,"My apologies but as someone with a very, very vague understanding of how baseball works, I understand that it's the same batter each time for all 12 throws, but what I don't get is how come he isn't that one that's out since it seems like he's missing all of the throws. Could you perhaps explain what's going on here?"
AskReddit,3e2ikh,bitchesbrewseph,2,Tue Jul 21 19:00:55 2015 UTC,"He is out.  So, in order to get ""out"" in baseballl, you need 3 strikes, which is when you swing and miss the ball (it also counts as a strike if you hit the ball, but it goes off in an odd direction, away from the field, this is a ""foul ball"").  This article is saying that the batter went up to the plate four times over the course of the entire game. Each time he went up, he never even hit the ball (barring one foul ball). Sometimes he would swing and miss, sometimes he just wouldn't swing at all!  The final time he was up, was when the score was tied, and the game about to be over- when he struck out yet again, the game ended."
AskReddit,3e2ikh,ShadowsOfAThought,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:09:18 2015 UTC,"I get it now! What I misunderstood was I thought that the video was showing consecutive throws so that to me it looked like the batter was standing there each time, while the pitcher was being struck out and replaced four times (which probably doesn't make any sense).  Oh gee, that'd probably be me if I were up as batter. Thank you for your explanation. It was very helpful."

AskReddit,3e2ikh,OllieMcJeeves,2,Tue Jul 21 19:58:38 2015 UTC,"I may not be understanding fully (please don't think I'm being rude) but in that video, you are watching 4 separate at-bats over the course of the game. What happened was the batter struck out 4 separate times, facing the bare minimum pitches to incur a strikeout (3) each time. Pitchers sometimes throw what is called a 'ball', which is considered not hittable (too up, too down, too outside, too inside) or batters sometimes 'foul off' pitches - hitting a tough throw out of the legal playing area (you can hit as many 'foul balls' as you want, and as long as a defensive player doesn't catch them, you won't be called out). Either a ball or a foul ball will extend the at-bat. In this case none of the at-bats were extended beyond the bare minimum.  1-2-3, you're out.  1-2-3, you're out.  so it goes.  e: a 'strike' is just considered a legal, hittable ball, usually a ball thrown anywhere between the batter's knees and his shoulders, and at a reasonable distance from his bat/body (there is a specific horizontal distance, but I cannot recall it at the moment)."

Not saying this as an insult, its just from an outside view, Donald Trump=America. The U.S. Population is only 5% of the world population but look at the enormous influence you have on the world. I thought Americans would really get behind Trump."

As an American, this terrifies me. The prevailing view of Trump in America is, from what I can tell at least, that he's a joke. He builds ridiculous, tacky things of generally poor quality (but look fancy as hell- gotta keep up appearances), guts companies to declare bankruptcy and turn a profit on the sale, and whores out himself and his name for publicity. I'm not convinced this is an actual run- he's just drumming up the Trump™ brand in the news."

The typical American Redditor is a 19-30 year old Obama-zombie wannabe socialist who thinks the United States is the great Satan and thinks radical Muslims are ""misunderstood"". They think Caitlyn Jenner is a braver hero than Chris Kyle, the American sniper.

Were you recently hurt, is your attention being pulled in too many directions, do you only want sex without the strings, or does it not signify anything except for another way of telling us you're not interested?"
AskReddit,3dz6an,razza221,284,Tue Jul 21 03:28:37 2015 UTC,"It'll vary from person to person, and situation to situation.   When I said it, I mostly meant ""I am a walking train wreck right now, and I don't think I have what it takes mentally or emotionally to do my part in a serious relationship. I am an incredibly poor choice for a partner if you want anything more than having a man child start crying on you in the middle of terrible, drunken intercourse.""

AskReddit,3dz6an,Imapancakenom,23,Tue Jul 21 03:43:25 2015 UTC,"It could mean any of the things you mentioned and more. For myself, it means I am in no position to have any real relationship. Every time I've had my life in any kind of shape, I've lost my job, or endured a failed relationship, or both all at once. And I don't really want to stand here and explain my life's sob stories to someone I don't really know all that well. So to save that trouble, ''emotionally unavailable'' is a lot better than ''I'm fucked up, my life has been fucked up for a long time and probably will continue on that path, you can do better''."
AskReddit,3dz6an,JDogish,76,Tue Jul 21 04:34:12 2015 UTC,"I certainly don't go around describing myself as emotionally unavailable, but I've had more than one girl tell me that's what I am. My personality has also been compared to that of Don Draper from Mad Men- in a not-complimentary way. I've never seen the show- but that's what I've been told, if that helps.  It's not an excuse to avoid relationships, or a function of sex addiction or anything... Mostly I think it's just what it sounds like- My feelings (literally: happiness, sadness, anger, fear, etc) are all way muted compared to when I was in my teens and 20's. What I do truly feel, inside, I have a really difficult time showing anybody. I'm closer with my mom and the one girl I've had/have a long term relationship with, but even they would admit I'm distant in terms of access to my feelings. I'm mostly concerned with acute stability in my relationships, and as such they're almost all surface deep. I'm a fraud- I'm socially pliable/skilled enough to be exactly who anybody needs ""me"" to be. People probably think I'm intelligent, kind, and well-principled, and would probably admit it somehow seems like they barely even know me. I get along with everybody I meet, and people like me- I have zero friends. I'm like a mirror that reflects back whatever other people need to be totally comfortable in the moment- but there's no access to anything underneath the image. If there's even anything there at all."
AskReddit,3dz6an,exitpursuedbyagolden,20,Tue Jul 21 05:46:32 2015 UTC,"Yep. That's what it means. And this is incredibly common in guys, as society basically tells us that you can express positive emotions and occasionally anger. That's it. Nothing else.  Stoicism gone wrong ends up with emotional unavailability.  For me, moving to a new place and making one really good guy friend that I eventually got comfortable enough around to really let in has helped me to open up to other people too. I do my best to just let my current gf into everything I think now, even if it's negative. And it's the best relationship I've ever been in.

The thing is, I have a pretty quick initial reaction where I can go from 0 to 100 attraction to someone in a day or two time (happened recently), and it dwiddles down to 'normal' levels after that. Indicating interest or not, if I were to text back as much as I wanted to in that first period, every girl would be creeped out and it's not how I normally am.

I started to realize that this girl I used to see would go out of her way to text me and I didn't have to twist her arm to try to have a meaningful conversation. After that, it was pretty easy to confidently make a move on her, with success.  Essentially, if the guy isn't putting in time for these most basic courtesies (not cancelling plans frequently or without reason, responding to texts/calls at all, etc.), he's probably not interested. If he does, then just ask him out somewhere super casual and see how much you enjoy it.  Best case - You get a direct answer or go on date and then get answer. Signals are now clearer.  Worst case - You go on the date, but he doesn't know you're interested or something else still prevents things from being more clear to you. Try more dates and if the uncertain mood persists and all else fails, instead of asking if he is interested tell him that you're interested and proceed with your own judgment from there. If nothing else, you'll get resolution on the whole affair."

AskReddit,3dz6an,PM_ME_UR_BRA_BUDDIES,340,Mon Jul 20 18:45:29 2015 UTC,"Something I've learned about humor (from a psychology of humor class) is that many if not all people use humor to address a subject that they aren't comfortable discussing seriously.  If a dude makes a sexual joke including you, he's essentially trying to give you a hint without flat out stating his intentions.   This explains why so many comedians kill themselves (""but why, they seem so happy!""). When they make jokes about their appearance, family problems, emotional problems, lack of relationship experience, they're pretty much pouring all of their insecurities and weaknesses out to you without feeling vulnerable, because hey, it's just a joke, right? We think they're happy because they're jokesters, when in reality they're just looking for a way to get all the pain out.  TL;DR Humor is used to express things we don't feel comfortable expressing in a serious conversation."

AskReddit,3dz6an,FalconMC,85,Mon Jul 20 20:12:34 2015 UTC,"""Important to point out that just because we aren't currently interested doesn't mean we won't ever be interested.""  I think it's important to point out that this is true for women too. For example, the ""friend zone"" is mostly bullshit. Yes, there are some guys that a girl would rather be friends with, but the majority of guys who think they've been friend-zoned really haven't been. For many women, interest isn't instant (beyond the physical), interest builds. In my experience, the more I get to know someone's personality, the more I'm attracted to them - they even become more physically attractive because I look at them in a different way (conversely a hot guy may start to seem ugly if he has a shitty personality). I think the problem is that many guys give up because, honestly, they don't want to put forth the effort of a relationship with no sure sexual reward. There's no guarantee that you'll ""get the girl,"" but if you make an effort, your good qualities will become more apparent and attractive. We might not be immediately interested, but that doesn't mean we're uninterested.   edit: I think some of you missed my point, which is not to immediately jump to, ""She's not interested. Time to move on."" My point is: if you think the girl is worth it, give it time. Again, just because a girl doesn't seem interested doesn't mean she won't be. I'm not saying to put all your eggs in one basket and devote your life to this girl in order to attract her. I'm just saying that attraction isn't always immediate, but if you put forth effort, there is a greater chance that you will become more attractive to someone because they've had the chance to get to know you."

If he responds with ""I’m not interested right now."" then he’s not interested right now, for some reason(raging from physical issues to emotional drama or just a rought couple of months ahead).

I awoke the next day and got on facebook and immediately saw a new friend request, and I remember thinking 'oh shit, i think this is the dude I made out with.' Initially I was not into him, but eventually we began talking as friends. I even, to my dismay, used him for his car and fake ID. He knows all about this, because I can't lie to him about anything. I'm honestly the nerdy girl that usually cannot talk to anyone, but the beginning of college kind of made me a horrible bitch, so forgive me. I also wasn't doing great in school, which was a first for me, but I wasn't adjusting to college well for some personal shit going on. Anyway, the guy got me a job at a book store, where he worked, and we just kept getting closer and closer. Eventually I realized one day at work when he was in charge that he was the one. It hit me all of a sudden, it was so fucking weird. Immediately upon me finally showing him affection and gratitude he basically moved in and we have probably never spent more than a week apart (except for this month, because i'm studying in Poland, and it is fucking terrible). Four years later we are both in grad school and plan to spend the rest of our lives with each other. He is my best friend and lover, and it is seriously the best thing that has ever happened to me. He made me me again, I excelled at school (besides my terrible grammar) and I honestly don't know what I would do without him. What I gather from my story is that sometimes people need to get over being self centered and open their fucking eyes, because if i continued to be a self indulgent brat and someone that was looking for a perfect human being, I could have missed out on the best thing ever.   oh, passion pit was important because we loved them. i guess it wasn't that important to our story."

I love the energy, I love the gains, I love feeling my muscles work and struggle to push and pull heavy ass weight. I love picturing my muscles breaking down every rep and fueling them with awesome food to make them bigger and stronger. I love how amazing my body looks and the recognition I get from it, especially from girls. I love that it cures my lethargy and cloudiness. I love that I can zone out for 1-2 hours a day and nothing matters but getting one more rep in.  Marijuana. I hesitate to call this one an addiction - though I do smoke almost every day, I can and do go days/weeks without it no problem, and I'm confident I can quit any time I want. But I love the way it makes me think. I love the new perspectives I experience that otherwise wouldn't be possible. I love how deep my mind goes thinking about anything - the breakthroughs in thinking I can achieve; the objective views on the world that are otherwise unattainable.

Picture a slightly bigger Pacquiao/Mayweather with a little less muscle definition (their BF is probably like 5-6%). I rarely smoke weed before my workout because it makes me too relaxed, but almost always after working out. I really don't see it impacting my gains at all - granted, I understand from a biological perspective it certainly must since combustion/inhalation constrict blood vessels. However, I doubt it impacts progress significantly - IIRC a recent survey for of NFL athletes, something like 70-80% smoke weed, and this is at the absolute pinnacle of athleticism.

Whether it's what restaurant to go to, when to have a shower, when to go to bed, what to wear for the day, what jobs to apply to, or whom to have sex with - all these decisions they've had to make together, and they don't know any different.

AskReddit,3dxtox,challenge4,1385,Mon Jul 20 14:31:20 2015 UTC,"For those who want links, here was the original post.  But that post doesn't tell the whole story. The safe was posted in March of 2013, but the OP never returned to tell us if he opened it or what was inside. For the rest of 2013, there were hundreds of posts across many many subreddits about people's blueballs from not getting a resolution to the story. It was a circlejerk for about 9 months until December.  We found out after the fact that the original OP had moved out of the house in the meantime. Also during that time, the new tenant discovered reddit and made an account. Remember all those circlejerking posts? Well, one day he ran across one and was surprised to see his own basement posted on reddit.  So he set out to open it, and posted the results two days before Christmas.  If you were a redditor in 2013, you will have seen the extent to which reddit will not let something go. And also the absurd amount of celebration there is when a circlejerk reaches it's climax.  EDIT: I should add that the best part of the great reveal was that the safe was empty. Unless you count the single spider."

AskReddit,3dxtox,dangerbook,66,Mon Jul 20 15:48:06 2015 UTC,"From u/flossdaily    Before you read this: Please don't judge me... I'm just sharing my story because people asked...  Wow... okay, I wasn't sure if I was ever going to tell anyone about this, but it's late and I'm sleep deprived so i guess I'll just write it now and regret it in the morning :/  First of all, - just for some background: My mom died right when I was born, (she was actually really, really hot- but this isn't about her. I guess that's fucked up to say, but whatever.) I actually grew up with my dad's family, because my dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before I was born. So you can see, my childhood was really kind of messed up.  Anyways, growing up I feel like there was always a lot of distance between me and my sister. When I was about 17 or 18 I first noticed that my sister was a hottie.   I don't want to go into too many details about it, but basically what happened is that I accidentally found a video that she made of herself. I knew she didn't make it for me- but I thought she was so fucking beautiful that I watched it twice. I probably would have watched it a hell of a lot more, except that like right around the time I found the video, all this crazy shit went down and I had to leave home. (My dad's family who I was staying with got in bad trouble with the law. I never talk about it).  Sooo... I was totally lusting after my sister at that point. She was also having bad trouble with the law. She was actually in custody when I left home.  My friend and I went to go pick her up. When I saw her that day, after seeing the video, I have to be honest, I just wanted to fuck her brains out. Looking back on it now, it's pretty messed up- but I think she had feelings for me too. She actually kissed me right after we came to get her... and it wasn't a sisterly kiss, you know? I mean, it wasn't like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn't sisterly.  After we left, we all went to crash with my Sister's friends. On the trip there, my friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with my Sister, and I got a little jealous. He's a good looking guy- and even though she was my sister- I just felt like he was competition. Not much else happened between us for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging.  Pretty much everyone in my life at that point was wanted by the government, so we all moved around a lot. I'm not saying that I'm proud of it or anything, but it was kind of an awesome time.  My friend and my sister never hooked up I don't think- but I thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them. It was around that time that I got really badly hurt in an accident. It was fucked up. I almost died. But when I was in recovery my sister came to see me, and out of the clear blue sky she started gives me this awesome, slow, passionate kiss on the lips.   Sadly (although, I guess for the best) nothing ever came of it. We spent some time apart... and I started to get really religious, so I tried not to think of her that way. It was actually going well for a long time- like I was totally over her. But I have to say, like a year or so after all that stuff went down, we were out sailing (not like a date or anything romantic like that), and she was wearing like the hottest bikini I've ever fucking seen and it brought back all the old feelings. Sigh.  A little while later she actually wound up with my friend from before (the sexual tension guy). I can't say I was surprised.  But even after she was shacking up with my friend, there was one time we were at a party... my friend was inside, and my sister and I were outside alone. It was a really intimate moment. I think something might have happened, except that I killed the mood when I told her that Darth Vader was our father and that I had to go face him."

It was pretty popular, but people often came completely uninformed about what the food would be like.  Ethiopian cuisine, if you don't already know, is known for a type of bread called injera, which serves as an edible plate and utensil during a meal. So it's quite funny when people ask for a fork and knife with their meals, which happened quite a bit.  The best though, is when people ask for a specifically made dish to be modified like it was a pasta or something. There's this seasoned ground beef dish called kitfo which is best served raw, but we would serve it cooked at the restaurant unless specifically asked too (if it doesn't say tartare, people are unpleasantly surprised by raw meat). Maybe this lady just glanced at the seasonings, but she asked if there was a vegetarian option for this dish."

No common ground to start from   Fair enough.   And we're falling apart   Wait, if you haven't started because of lack of common ground, how can you be falling apart?   You'll say, the world has come between us   Again, it seems like y'all weren't even together. So, how can the world come between you?   Our lives have come between us   Well, which is it? Your lives or the world? Let me reiterate: y'all don't seem to be together in the first place.   Still I know you just don't care   I would focus on that tidbit of information, pal.   And I said what about Breakfast at Tiffany's?  She said I think I remember the film  And as I recall I think, we both kind o' liked it  And I said well that's, the one thing we've got   Okay, a few things: First, are you basing your entire connection on a movie you watched together? That's ill-advised because she seems unsure if she's actually seen it, which is odd because ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is a very memorable film. I think you might be talking about ""Roman Holiday"". Also, no one ""kind o' likes"" Breakfast at Tiffany's. You either love it, hate it, or you haven't seen it. People aren't ""meh"" about that film. Again, I think you're talking about ""Roman Holiday"". Finally, given that y'all are pretty fuzzy on what movie it is that y'all may or may not mutually ""kind o' like"", you should hold off on saying ""that's the one thing we've got"".  Proceed to Verse 2   I see you, the only one who knew me  But now your eyes see through me I guess I was wrong  So what now?   It's plain to see we're over  And I hate when things are over  When so much is left undone   What the ever-loving fuck does this mean? She knew you, but now she sees through you? Doesn't that transparency of yours mean that she actually knows you more now than in the past, which makes the past tense use of ""know"" very, very confusing here? And, what the hell do you guess you were wrong about? That she knew you then or that she knows you now? This is incredibly confusing. What are you saying about the state of this relationship, which, if you remember, you implied never really got a chance to start due to lack of common ground? Can something that never started be said to be over? And, if not, is there really anything left undone, let alone ""so much is left undone""? This entire situation is incomprehensible - conceptually muddled. No wonder she's leaving.  [Repeat Chorus]  [Repeat Verse 1]  [Repeat Chorus x3]  FML.  Ladies and gentlemen, ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" by Deep Blue Something - quite possibly one of the worst songs to ever grace the top 40 for at least 33 weeks."

Place a empty beer bottle on each post.   The player/ team will stand behind on of the poles.   Now you need a frisbee and everyone to be holding a beer or beverage of their choice.  You will be playing to 21 points Points are earned by.  Hitting the bottle with the frisbee( one point). The bottle hitting the ground. ( one point) the frisbee hitting the ground.(one point).   There is no reaching I front of the pole to catch the frisbee. No point if the throw was too high. ( out out of arms reach over head) No point if the throw was to low ( under knee high) No point if the throw was to wide ( more the one step from behind the pole)  As for the drinking part you will drink for the following: Letting the other team score a point.  Catching the frisbee against your body( body trap) Dropping the frisbee after you already caught it( sloppy B) If you have to replant the pole (replant) If the frisbee goes between your legs ( 5 hole) If you take out your phone you have to finish your drink. If the frisbee hits the drink you are holding   Only acceptable pause to the game is to get another beer. So plan your trips. To the bathroom accordingly.

I live in a VERY bigoted area and you never know if coming out will be met with acceptance, anger, or violence. I also love to do typical guy activities, like going snowboarding with a group of guys or kayaking or swimming. Some guys immediately feel uncomfortable if they know a gay guy is with them so to save us both the awkwardness I just keep my mouth shut, pretend I like boobs and dodge relationship questions.   I'm not out to my family because they're very anti-gay. Although I don't value their opinions on the subject I don't feel like dealing with the drama that will ensue unless I have to.  I'm also not out because in my state there are no workplace protections for gay people. You can be fired for being gay. I read an article that very recently sexuality was declared to fall under the civil rights act but I don't know if that means I'm safe or not to come out at work. (I'd like to come out at work since that would instantly stop the hookup attempts and relationship questions by older women in my office). I know its a rare case but I live paycheck to paycheck as it is and can't afford the financial hit of being fired.  Coming out sucks. I hate it. People suddenly see you as a ""gay"" not a person and its a shitty feeling. Even those meaning well will see you as their new ""gay best friend"". The best kind of responses are the ones where you know nothing has changed.   Unfortunately coming out is one of those necessary evils we still have to do."

AskReddit,3e362i,ChobitAlice,12,Tue Jul 21 16:33:09 2015 UTC,"My mom told me this story.   One of my mom's students was born to two teenage parents. When the kid was barely a year old, the mom died of an aneurysm and left the dad with full custody of the kid. He was forced to drop out of high school in order to support his son, and they were in and out of homeless shelters while he worked odd jobs. However, it got to the point where they could no longer stay in the shelters and so they were on the streets for months in the middle of winter. The dad got to the point where he couldn't find any work and he was desperate. One morning he left his son (then about four years old) at his estranged parents' house and drove to one of the tallest buildings in the city. He walked up to the roof and stood on the edge, about to jump. Somebody grabbed him from behind and yanked him back onto the roof, holding him down. Turns out it was one of the managers of the building. They sat on the roof for hours talking about him and his life. He was just a twenty-one year old guy who had been down on his luck because of circumstances pretty much out of his control. The manager actually offered him a job as a custodian for the building and temporary housing until he could afford rent somewhere else, which he accepted. And he worked his ass off until they were back on their feet. The dad finally got his GED and went to culinary school. Last my mom heard he owns a restaurant in a good part of town and his son is about to go to college. Pretty awesome to see a guy go from being homeless and suicidal to happy and successful. He really loved his son throughout everything and in the end his son is what drove him to work hard."

I told him about how I saw my (after that episode)ex go home holding hands with another guy, then he shut off the taxometre and drove me home to my dorm.

For instance, when he talks on the phone with my mom he would say he's alone but there's a woman's voice in the background.

AskReddit,3e1y3j,wmass,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:09:48 2015 UTC,"Those actually relate to the gender of the person they are referring to. When people complain about ""gendered"" nouns in other languages, this isn't what they are talking about. They are taking about how every noun uses a gendered article and each adjective has to be gendered arbitrarily based on the circumstance.   In English, ""red"" is always just ""red"". In Spanish, it's arbitrarily ""rojo"" or ""roja"" for no real reason."

For Indo-European in particular, the early Proto-Indo-European only had animate and inanimate nouns. The animate split on the accusative case, forming masculine and feminine nouns, while the inanimate became neuter.  It wasn't as if someone arbitrarily chose a bunch of genders for nouns :).  English certainly had gendered nouns (Old English had three genders and five cases), though they were mostly lost by Middle English."

AskReddit,3e1y3j,billionsofkeys,7,Tue Jul 21 15:19:20 2015 UTC,"Coming from German as my native language, I find the difference to English is rather minimal. English does sound smoother on occasion, but over the years I found there are areas which I prefer to discuss in one language or the other. The use of composite nouns in German especially makes it easier to shorten some explanations without losing content (and makes translations harder on occasion because of a single term in German resulting in a complete sentence in English). On the other hand, run-on sentences mostly sound more elegant in English.  Personally, I think romanic languages like Spanish or Italian sound much smoother, more musical compared to both English and German. Languages like Polish or Russian tend to sound even harsher than English or German (though I do admit I know these two languages only from discussions on local trains I overheard, whereas I did have more contact with a couple of romanic languages)."

AskReddit,3e1y3j,nicecreamdude,3,Tue Jul 21 10:10:43 2015 UTC,"Yup, English pronunciation is a complete mess.  Mostly due to this:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Vowel_Shift   Through the Great Vowel Shift, all Middle English long vowels changed their pronunciation. Because English spelling was becoming standardized in the 15th and 16th centuries, the Great Vowel Shift is responsible for many of the peculiarities of English spelling"

AskReddit,3e1y3j,Echono,2,Tue Jul 21 16:22:43 2015 UTC,"English is a lot more permisive than other lenguages.  for example is I say ""I have been smartphoning all the day"" I have just made up a word, but you know that I have been all the day on my phone.  But on the same time it has been so simplyfied that you need everything on a sentence to it make sense. In latin lenguages the verb also tells you the exact tense and who did it. ""Cantariamos"" tells you the same as ""We will sing"" used in the ""we will sing if..."" sentence. So in some way is more simple, but also need more thinks to make sense."

AskReddit,3e1y3j,freshasineed,2,Tue Jul 21 09:41:27 2015 UTC,"I'm Polish. Now let me tell you - learning English has proven to be a somewhat bittersweet experience for most Poles I know. Whereas the language itself seems really easy and not very difficult for us to pronounce in terms of accent, it is a pain in the ass with many of its irregularities.   Since in the Polish language, every letter or sound is always pronounced the same way, it's difficult for us to simply memorise how some words are said, e.g. the letter G in the word Globe and in the word German, or how the word bow can be pronounced in two different ways (as in the weapon, or the verb). Because of this, many of us find it difficult to learn to speak the language proficiently.  From my personal experience, of the languages I've learned, English is definitely the simplest and easy to learn. I'd say it's followed by Spanish, then French, and then German. But that's just my opinion. Then of course we have the language groups (or whatever they're called), e.g. it's much easier for a Pole to learn Russian and vice versa than it is for either of us to learn English or German.  All in all, English is an awesome language, I'm glad we can use it to communicate! :)"

In terms of speaking, I see English as a very friendly language. I don't have to use prefix/suffix to show respect as much as when I speak in Thai.  ex.

As I mentioned we had this huge problem with apostrophes that we were finally able to fix so we could accept them in e-mail addresses. I guess it's not a priority for us because we never/rarely mail clients anything and just collect their address so we know their location/time zone.

English is a son of a bitch because there are so many rules that you have to follow. It is hard to translate certain things because although there are so many fucking words something's just don't translate well because of the lack of words. Worst of all is having to explain to someone who isn't very familiar with English that there are words that sound alike but are spelt differently. Flour and flower both sound the same. It seems to be that we have a very limited amount of tones. When speaking other languages you are able to make certain sounds and accents that you aren't when limited to just English as it shuts you off

It was a time where I was between jobs/school so I was just trying to find something. I applied to a sales position, I say sales position it was really one of those annoying sales people you find on the highstreet selling you electricity or phone provider. I was called in for an interview which went really well, so the first day comes and I get put together with this attractive blonde girl, we drive to our assigned destination. Turns out the destination we had been given was wrong and we stood for 8 hours in a semi abandoned shopping mall. This was fine for me having no experience in sales to start out slow. Maybe twenty people passed in those 8 hours, and only 3 of them actually wanted to hear what we had to offer. I realised then and there that I cannot do a job like this, turns out reaching out and selling to random people is not a good job for an introvert. Meet in the next day, quit my job then and there, and I never ever looked back, it's one of the best decisions I have made career-wise.

And yeah, it was like that. Nobody in the building was getting sleep.) Told my school that it was interfering with my ability to do my job, as I couldn't sleep and felt strung the fuck out. They didn't feel like doing anything about it. That combined with them doubling my teaching hours per day (so zero prep time) and 40 kids in a class led to me giving them my month's notice. I felt very bad about letting the kids down at the time, but I figured I had to do it for my peace of mind.

It was like talking to a zombie. No one was doing anything.  So the day after my graduation I entered the adult world by planning a whole funeral with just my sister. I was even the person who told some of the cousins he had passed. It fucking sucked.   I'm also a huge dumbass and asked everyone to send me their stories that I was to read at his funeral.

Sometimes the family pays and once I In a blue moon someone has insurance but since we're such a small department I think usually they're just taken home and told in a firm tone to go to bed. That happens a lot regardless of disability. If someone disabled really was dangerous or had caused an accident I'd have to defer to an officer who'd probably have to talk to the seatbelt or lieutenant on duty or possibly the Sheriff about the legality of driving a motorized wheelchair whole intoxicated.

Most people think because they were allowed to stay there that they have some sort of right to continue to stay there.  That's totally not how squatters rights work, just because you are there doesn't mean you can stay there. It's a way for people to claim old property that was abandoned; you must have been living there for a long period of time and made improvements on it, without being asked to leave by the previous owner.

To the extent ""squatters rights"" refers to adverse adverse possession, the mechanism for claiming abandoned property you discussed, you are correct. But you can't just make someone leave, even if they don't have any right to be there.  In recent decades the laws in most jurisdictions have evolved to a point where a landlord typically can't take it upon herself to kick out squatters. Instead you need to go through the courts to get an eviction order, which can take months. You usually can't even change the locks on someone who has no colorable claim to the apartment without a court order. The exact extent and mechanism will vary by state.  Anecdotal example: someone broke into an apartment my uncle owns and started living there. It took him over a year to get them out."

AskReddit,3dywbn,ggchappell,44,Tue Jul 21 05:07:14 2015 UTC,"I'm confused, doesn't there have to be an injured party for prosecution? Don't you have to press charges?   No to both. (I'm talking about law in the U.S. here.)  In a criminal case, the prosecution represents the government -- usually stated as ""the people"" -- not any particular person. Prosecutors  can generally bring charges against anyone they want. They do need to be able to prove their case, and without an injured party ready to testify, that can be difficult to do.  To ""press charges"" is simply to make an official report to the police that a crime has been committed. It is the prosecutor's decision whether a criminal charge is actually brought against someone.  EDIT. Fixed verb."
AskReddit,3dywbn,CowboyNinjaAstronaut,27,Tue Jul 21 03:30:31 2015 UTC,"""Pressing charges"" isn't a thing. The prosecutor decides whether to charge someone, and what to charge them with.  Essentially, crimes against an individual are crimes against the state. This sounds bad, but it's actually more just. Victims can't be intimidated into not pressing charges, nor can you get away with crime by victimizing people who won't complain. ""A crime against one of us is a crime against all of us.""  Of course, this backfires against people who think they can report someone for a crime ""just to scare them"" but then ""not really press charges.""  Nope. If the prosecutor thinks he's got a case, he'll go for it.  This also means the prosecutor can not charge someone, and leave people arguing about whether he's not pursuing the case because ""no, really there isn't enough to make a case,"" or ""the 'victim' is wrong about the law"" or graft."

Even IF...you weren't guilty of doing another crime, you can still be charged with this crime. All that is needed is ""reasonable suspicion"".

Courts are very lenient when it comes to an officers ""suspicion"", because it's their job to drive around and poke around in order to prevent crime.   Most lawyers will advise you to make no statements to police, but if you ask them about this, they'll tell you that if an officers stops you and tells you WHY they are stopping you, or tells you that you are being detained, go ahead and cough up the ID or provide your name and DOB, THEN tell them you don't want to answer any questions.

AskReddit,3dywbn,Klowned,47,Tue Jul 21 00:59:35 2015 UTC,"Jurisdiction is important, because most of those laws are state or local laws, and therefore vary from place to place. There are a number of states where the passengers are allowed to drink, for example."

AskReddit,3dywbn,reohh,8,Tue Jul 21 03:43:51 2015 UTC,Place I go to seals the Growlers with a plastic ring and a heat gun. Does this obfuscate the concept enough to incite leniency or no?  I guess my buddy was right about leaving the emergency social interaction liquor in the trunk. What about a pickup? locked glovebox?
AskReddit,3dywbn,45calhp,7,Tue Jul 21 00:06:10 2015 UTC,That's perfect sealing.  As long as it's not a seal you can just put right back you're fine.  Honestly as long as it's a full growler you're fine 99% of the time.  Just don't have it in arm's reach.  The back seat is even fine.  Glove box is iffy.  Trunk is the best.
AskReddit,3dywbn,EuphemiaChoosesLife,13,Tue Jul 21 00:58:25 2015 UTC,"Not really something that directly answers OP, but, people are under the impression if you ask an undercover cop if they are a cop they legally have to say yes.  That's not true."
AskReddit,3dywbn,45calhp,335,Tue Jul 21 03:41:11 2015 UTC,LAPD here. Here is what comes to mind:  Stepping off of the sidewalk to cross an intersection when the cross walk is flashing a red don't walk with the timer counting down. The counter is for people already in the intersection.  Crossing after the timer starts delays vehicle traffic and is illegal.   (Not illegal but related) Search warrants. People demand a copy of the search warrant while we are in the middle of it. Sorry no that's not how it works. You get a copy after we are done.   Delaying/obstructing/interfering with official police business. People believe they can film/do what they want to the point people will walk up right in the middle of an investigation and begin filming. I don't mind that you are filming. But don't walk up within a foot of me while I'm dealing with a suspect or multiple suspects.  To go one step further suspects will pull their phone and say they can film while I'm attempting to detain them. No. No you cannot.   When we are trying to get somewhere with our lights and sirens on people will stop in the middle of the street or even pull to the left to get in the middle turning lane. You're supposed to slow and pull over to your right.  Technically this is failure to yield to emergency vehicles which can cost almost a thousand in fines... But you'll probably never be stopped because we are already trying to respond to an emergency.   Specific to the area I work many people litter. Right in front of me they'll toss trash. When asked they just shrug and say they didn't want it anymore (this has happened several times now). No that's littering. Also you're an asshole.   Honking because someone pissed you off. Unless you are trying to warn someone of danger or a possible collision that honking is excessive and illegal.   Talking on your cellphone with your phone in your hand but away from your face. Like you're holding a plate in front of your face or chest. Sorry but you cannot have it in your hand at all.   Riding your bike in the opposite direction of traffic. In certain areas riding on the sidewalk as well.   There may be more but these are what come to mind.
AskReddit,3dywbn,ROFLSwithSYRUP,138,Mon Jul 20 23:14:18 2015 UTC,"Talking on your cellphone with your phone in your hand but away from your face. Like you're holding a plate in front of your face or chest. Sorry but you cannot have it in your hand at all.

AskReddit,3dywbn,AssholeBot9000,68,Mon Jul 20 23:58:22 2015 UTC,"I'm embarrassed... completely left out ""while driving.""  As penance I'll admit the following: While looking for cellphone violations (while driving) I've seen a violator, pulled out of my hiding spot after checking to see that there was no oncoming traffic, and looked towards where the violater should be... only to realize I'd looked at the driver with their phone to their ear and not what car they were in.  Immediately made my next right turn and left the area in shame."
AskReddit,3dywbn,45calhp,12,Tue Jul 21 00:37:51 2015 UTC,"Speaking of hiding spots, I've always heard from friends that you have to be in plain sight. Is there any truth to this?"

AskReddit,3dywbn,Hello_34,9,Tue Jul 21 12:35:04 2015 UTC,Nobody cares about the admissibility of evidence. The problem with an illegal search is the inconvenience you didn't have to go through.
AskReddit,3dywbn,jakesboy2,27,Tue Jul 21 14:04:21 2015 UTC,"No, then they just use parallel construction."
AskReddit,3dywbn,lolpubs,43,Tue Jul 21 02:56:04 2015 UTC,"If they never had a search warrant present, then all evidence found is not usable, and the case will be thrown out."
AskReddit,3dywbn,Muthafluffer,60,Tue Jul 21 02:32:32 2015 UTC,The cops still get to throw all your shit around and you have to clean it up whether the evidence is allowed or not. Huge inconvenience and not difficult to just show them the search warrant assuming you have it.
AskReddit,3dywbn,tylerthehun,44,Tue Jul 21 02:56:57 2015 UTC,"You ask? ""Do you have a warrant"" is a reasonable question. That's almost never a critical or inexcusable delay. There's an obvious difference between simply asking whether you're legally compelled to comply with the search, as by a warrant or probable cause, and effectively or literally demanding they delay their activity until you touch the warrant, read the warrant, consult your lawyer, or whatever."
AskReddit,3dywbn,45calhp,41,Tue Jul 21 02:09:23 2015 UTC,"As a Paramedic, I gotta say I HATE when everyone pulls to the right when there are two or more lanes of traffic travelling the same direction (highway, for example).  In Canada, we have the whole 'pull to the right' campaign going on, and I firmly believe it should be 'pull to the nearest/safest shoulder'.   Just had a elderly patient with a broken pelvis in the back, and we were driving (lights and sirens) down the white centre lane. It was glorious watching all the highway traffic part perfectly to the closest shoulder, allowing us passage through the rush hour mess. However,  some car decided at the very last moment to swerve in front of me to make it to the right shoulder. I slammed my brakes and missed them by inches, but had to endure the horrifying screams of pain coming from the back.   I understand your point, but damn."
AskReddit,3dywbn,IWearTheMask,20,Tue Jul 21 05:29:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry but you cannot have it in your hand at all.   So I can put the speakerphone on and set it down in my lap or the seat next to me? Or would that still imply that I had to handle it to answer the call, activate speakerphone, etc.?"
AskReddit,3dywbn,45calhp,27,Tue Jul 21 00:13:56 2015 UTC,Turn the speakerphone on and set it on your lap or seat.  As long as it's not in your hand you're good.  Or setup your bluetooth system if you have one available in your car.
AskReddit,3dywbn,CoverIsCode3,12,Tue Jul 21 00:40:18 2015 UTC,"Different states, different jurisdictions and all that, so I'll take your answer with a grain of salt when extrapolating to here, but: Are Bluetooth headsets illegal while driving? For example, a single earbud that goes into one ear, or the around-the-neck dangly-thing with a single earbud in, or hell, screw Bluetooth, how about just a cabled earbud?"
AskReddit,3dywbn,Klowned,16,Tue Jul 21 03:39:57 2015 UTC,Those are okay.  You can't hold the phone in your hand.  However another rule is you cannot have earbuds in/covering both ears.  Those people listening to spotify with both earbuds in while driving: illegal.
AskReddit,3dywbn,Junebug476,6,Tue Jul 21 03:43:10 2015 UTC,"Also incredibly dangerous. I see people like that all the time on the road and at stoplights and it pisses me off. You can't hear shit with earbuds in, nearby vehicles like motorcycles, emergency vehicles, tires screeching, etc. I'd even give them the benefit of the doubt if I could say they are paying extra attention visually, but those are usually the same people who are weaving in their lane when the light turns green because they're looking at their phone to change the music."
AskReddit,3dywbn,yeah_but_no,37,Tue Jul 21 05:50:51 2015 UTC,"You mentioned littering, I gotta ask.  People argue with me about what constitutes as litter, how do the cops see it?  Personally, I'd never drop plastic or Styrofoam, but chucking banana peels and apple cores out the window is fair game.

AskReddit,3dywbn,Konnektor,65,Tue Jul 21 00:01:13 2015 UTC,"Actually in my state, throwing out biodegradable junk is littering. The reason is you are then luring animals close to or into the road since they want to eat it, which can then cause accidents. Check your state laws."

Also as long as you aren't weaving through traffic, I won't be too hard on you.

While on a walk him and his mission companion discovered a plane in the middle of the forest.  His father was into plains so he took some pictures and sent it to his dad.  He was later held in custody by the French Equivalent of the United States FBI.  Apparently they thought he was his dad (because they shared the same name.)  Sent by America to spy.  The plane in the forest they had discovered was a prototype fighter being developed for WWII.  Long story short his name was cleared.  So I would imagine there's probably other ""Area 51's out there.""  However, maybe other countries do a better job than America does at hiding where their top secret bases are.

AskReddit,3e373w,Asdyc,3,Tue Jul 21 18:00:03 2015 UTC,"My SO and I survived infidelity somehow but it did not feel like we  were going to in the beginning.  I was the one who was cheated on, and we did split up/got back together several times afterwards.  Partly because we had a little girl together and partly because we were best friends, had been together 6 years(at the time), and even though he was the one who hurt me, for some reason, he was still the person I wanted to talk to when I was down about it.  He fought hard to get me back, even though, I had given him an out several times.  I was pretty much trying to convince him that he doesn't want me back because it felt like a part of me died, and it would never be the same.  It was so sad for both of us in so many ways, like adjusting to spending time with our daughter separately, and the reality that our relationship and history together had been tainted.  It was not at all what I imagined my response to being cheated on would be.  A lot of my friends would say things like ""I would be breaking all of his stuff, throwing all of his clothes out, beating him up, fighting the girl he was seeing"" etc...  But instead I tried my best to be an adult about it.  I went through a lot of stages and emotions afterwards, like anger, jealousy, disbelief, depression, and so on.  But the part that stuck, even now that it's years later, is the sense of certainty in my life.  For example, we are now married and happy again, and I have forgiven him a long time ago, but I will never ever again feel certain about our future.  I'm happy with my decision to stay with him, and to forgive him, and he says he would never jeopardize what we have again but there is part of me that is always waiting for the other shoe to drop.  I do miss that feeling of security and trust in the relationship but new feelings have come out of it.  We now have made through something so difficult and have had to really learn more about ourselves and each other through this forgiving process and therapy.  This seems to have made us stronger somehow.  My view of him changed in the way that I lost a lot of respect for him after learning about all of the lies he told and time he spent with her instead of with his family but over time, I have found new respect for how hard he has worked and continues to work towards regaining my trust and love."

I could tell she was a little more suspicious than she was in the past (before there was zero hints of jealousy.)

AskReddit,3dy4bp,SlaughterMeister,39,Tue Jul 21 05:10:03 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how the two are different, honestly. My brain and my consciousness are effectively one. We are physical and chemical processes that also take into account feedback from our surroundings and process them in order to make decisions. That is free will. Free will means I'm not wound up like a toy and set to walk my life with predetermined decisions. Every decision is weighed based on stored memories and other inputs and my brain's ability to process information and come to the best solution it is capable of. That's me, that's free will.  The problem is that people have long been conditioned and taught to believe that there is some sort of mystical reality beyond the brain. That free will means there is a soul or something that makes use and utilizes the brain but is distinct from it. That chemicals are unable to come together in complex processes that compute inputs and output data. I am chemicals, i am a brain and a body and I would argue, while most people can't even explain what they mean by ""free will"" in the first place, that these processes qualify as free will as much as anything can."
AskReddit,3dy4bp,1jl,16,Tue Jul 21 04:09:31 2015 UTC,"You're skirting a fine line on the definition of free will, though.   Right now, look at characters in video games. AI has developed to a point where NPCs can have daily routines, schedules that mirror a typical person's. They can talk to other NPCs, mix up their routine every now and then, and make the world feel more realistic. When the player interrupts that routine, their behavior might change. They ""learn"" and ""adapt"".  While it's not perfect yet, to some players it might seem as though these characters have some semblance of a free will. Why is Lydia from Skyrim standing on this fire trap? It's because she's stupid, not because the game is forcing her to. Some NPCs are reliable, and some are reliably unreliable.  To a programmer of the game, of course it's apparent that the NPCs don't have free will. The data is all laid out in front of you. Behaviors have weighted values, their schedules can be specifically constructed to seem believable, and it's all orchestrated by the world of the game itself like a large invisible puppetmaster.  So let's scale up drastically and apply this to humans in our world. The typical person firmly believes that they are 100% in control of their actions and their beliefs. Yet we are also primarily products of our environment; those beliefs and thoughts are created by external forces acting upon you, shaping your mind into a rather specific state whether you acknowledge it or not.  If it were possible to fully map and understand the chemistry of the brain right now, would the result appear similar to the AI controls of a video game, albeit on a massive scale? Extrapolating that data, and also accounting for the effects of interactions with others as the model runs, I believe it would be possible to accurately predict an individual's behavior as if they were just another AI character in a simulation. In that regard, free will cannot exist because everything is predetermined by the environment that an intelligence occupies.  I would love to see an experiment someday carried out in both a simulation and in reality, using accurately scanned brain patterns to upload two digital consciousnesses and stick them in a room together. Then do the same thing with their physical counterparts while giving them the same exact stimuli and see if the scenario happens the same way in each version."
AskReddit,3dy4bp,Proditus,7,Tue Jul 21 05:06:11 2015 UTC,"Actually, I think it precisely means that you are ""wound up like a toy"".   That's actually a very good analogy.  Your brain is to your decisions as the toy's mechanism is to its movement.  To be honest, I don't think I have a real objection to what you are saying, just a semantic one.  I think we have the same point of view on what the relationship is between brain and consciousness, but we use the term ""free will"" differently.  When I say I reject the idea of free will, it is more on the basis of rejecting that there is an ""I"" which is making decisions in the first place.  In other words, I am not deciding to write this sentence any more than the earth is deciding to orbit the sun.  Both of these events are simply results of the laws of physics and the current configuration of the matter in the universe."

AskReddit,3dy4bp,fdsdfg,837,Mon Jul 20 20:30:44 2015 UTC,"it's a fundamental human right.   The problem here is that the whole post WW2 ""Human Rights"" movement has coopted the word ""rights"" and abused the hell out of it. Its use in the context of Natural Rights back in the time of Locke was perfectly sound, the basic underlying premise being ""you have the right to do whatever you wish, so long as it does not infringe upon the rights of others"". The basic fundamental rights are the right to life, liberty, and property, and no one can deprive you of any of those things without due process of law. The various additional rights are derived from these three, and are logical within that framework. This concept worked exceptionally well as a basis for modern representative democracy, empowering the governments of the people to protect those rights. It's been a great improvement over previous systems like Divine Right of kings.  Then along comes the modern socialist movement, and there's all sorts of things they wanted to get done, so they piggybacked onto the established concepts and named them ""rights"", despite the fact that many of them were philosophically incompatible with the concept. As a result, we have the UDHR declaring that everyone has the right to stuff like unemployment insurance, paid holidays, and free medical care. Personally, my politics sit a little to the right of Leon Trotsky, so I'm totally down with creating a socialist utopia where we have all that stuff. I am not, however, self-deluded enough to claim all this great stuff is rights. I say that as wealthy nations we have a moral obligation to provide these things to everyone to as full a degree as we can afford, but only a nut could read Locke and till think they're rights.   It'd sure be nice if we could afford to give everyone free medical care, but of we can't afford it, we can't afford it. Do we then enslave the doctor to provide free care, depriving him of liberty? Do we nationalize the bandage factory, depriving the factory owners of their property? In the context of rights, medical care just isn't one. Everyone had the right to equal benefit from government services, but this must necessarily be limited by what we, as a nation, can afford."

All other western countries pay doctors well (but not quite as well) and do not ask for free labour, yet still manage to hold it together, while covering everyone AND spending half as much money (or less) than the United States.  But shifting the system would be painful.  Insurance companies (mainly) would be shut down or drastically down-sized.  Wholesale switch-over would be a massive economic shock, but it wouldn't involve anything like your little polemic ""slavery"" to spin up a state-by-state single-payer scheme with a national negotiation over prices and obligations (Medicare already has that structure in place, so it's not even a big burden).  Other than shareholders in 6 major insurance companies, who would lose some money, the remainder of the US would benefit hugely from a public system with optional enhanced private coverage (similar to Canada).  The number of dollars that go into the system vs the number of actual health procedures that get done is (IIRC) something like 35% higher under Medicare, than it is under private insurance.  That would more than account for all the uninsured AND would have some left-over savings to go around.  The system, after the transition to ""universal medicare"" would be something like 5% cheaper than the current system, WHILE covering everyone (instead of only 70%)."

From wikipedia:   The Fermi paradox is the apparent contradiction between high estimates of the probability of the existence of extraterrestrial civilization and humanity's lack of contact with, or evidence for, such civilizations. The basic points of the argument, made by physicists Enrico Fermi and Michael H. Hart, are:   The Sun is a typical star, and relatively young. There are billions of stars in the galaxy that are billions of years older. Almost surely, some of these stars will have Earth-like planets. Assuming the Earth is typical, some of these planets may develop intelligent life. Some of these civilizations may develop interstellar travel, a technology Earth is investigating even now (such as the 100 Year Starship). Even at the slow pace of currently envisioned interstellar travel, the galaxy can be completely colonized in a few tens of millions of years. According to this line of thinking, the Earth should already have been colonized, or at least visited. But no convincing evidence of this exists. Furthermore, no confirmed signs of intelligence (see Empirical resolution attempts) elsewhere have yet been spotted in our galaxy or (to the extent it would be detectable) elsewhere in the observable universe. Hence Fermi's question, ""Where is everybody?"""

It would not at all be surprising to find some microbial, methane-based lifeforms living within the atmosphere of Titan, with a fully functional ecosystem and all. Not at all ""habitable"" for humans, but for some other creatures who have evolved in a methane environment? Who knows?!  Another potential ""life hotspot"" around here could be Europa, one of the 4 Galilean moons of Jupiter. It has a solid ice crust, with liquid oceans of water underneath! We know that here on Earth, where there is water, there is life. Also boding particularly well for the chances of life on Europa, is that it is very likely that there is some warm water, due to the intense gravitational pulls from Jupiter, also potentially from any seismic hot-spots that may be underneath that icy crust.

To ensure the longevity of this paradise, the Matrioshka Brain would be undetectable to outsiders.   But even if that were the case for some species, certainly some others would take a path of endless colonization and expansion, so the paradox still remains!"
AskReddit,3dy4bp,lesubreddit,80,Mon Jul 20 18:18:46 2015 UTC,"IMO the Fermi paradox is not a very good paradox because of the massive number of underlying assumptions it makes. The main thing that it ignores is the difficulty in achieving long-range interstellar travel, let alone colonization.   They have to develop FTL travel and something like cryo-sleep for journeys which will take decades or more likely centuries. Bonus points if they develop tech that lets them warp wherever they want instantly, but also defies known universal laws. They have to be able to plot an extremely accurate course towards their destination even though the universe is constantly expanding during the decades/centuries long trip. Even a minute error can send the ship to the middle of nowhere.  They have to be able to plan logistics and supply the proper amount of food, water, heating, oxygen, etc that is needed to sustain life during the trip which will likely last a few decades to a few millennia. If they use cryo-sleep and reduce the need for food, water, and heat, they need to have the capability to not miss their target or they wake up in the middle of nowhere. In addition, if the mission is colonization then they need to send enough of them to make sure the genetic pool doesn't become too shallow (the more the better, but the more complicated everything else becomes). The ship they travel on must be able to withstand extreme impacts and can either self-repair or be repaired with relative ease. The ship's components must also be protected from wear and tear if it is using mechanical parts and there is friction between those parts. Everyone can retain their sanity and no one can take over the ship with a small group. Basically makes cryo-sleep or an equivalent essential for small cramped ships.   Basically, if they want to colonize outside of their solar system they will need to build a fucking city and plot a course that lets them refuel necessary raw materials during the long-ass journey.  IMO I think that Macross Frontier had the right idea for their colonization ship thing with the dozen supply ships attached to it. It solves all the problems but the ship is taking a massive amount of resources from whatever planet it was build from and will need to resupply because it is impossible for there to be zero waste."
AskReddit,3dy4bp,BravelyThrowingAway,5,Mon Jul 20 21:52:59 2015 UTC,"IMO the Fermi paradox is not a very good paradox because of the massive number of underlying assumptions it makes.   And in my opinion, your criticism also makes a massive number of underlying assumption of what an alien race would be and how it would travel. First of all, if they were going FTL (which is your first point) the rest of your argument is null because time does not elapse at the speed of light. Anyway, assuming you didn't say that..  Aliens may not need cryogenics if they have immortality - there's a jellyfish on earth with this ability. ""known universal laws"" of course they're always changing at least you recognize we're probably wrong on a lot of stuff so yeah, maybe they could warp where ever. Regarding logistics and supplies - maybe they don't need the typical water, oxygen and other shit because they aren't even DNA-based life. Maybe they can roll up into some sort of cocoon and survive like that for millions of years. Maybe they don't even need a space ship. How do you know the alien race isn't some super resistant goo or fungus-like entity that was blasted into space from a meteor impact and just floats around from solar winds? look at tardigades, they can withstand open space and be blasted with UV rays out in space and they don't give a fuck."

A child can be born premature and survive at 25 weeks, around 6 months. It's viable outside the womb. I personally believe a fetus should not be aborted after it hits the 3rd trimester area, unless of course harm is to come to the mother or the fetus is unable to be carried to term. But after that it's able to live outside the womb even with a premature birth. So I think that's what a majority of pro choice advocates such as myself consider a fetus  a human more so than just tissue during the first trimester. Because within 1-12 weeks of pregnancy, it's literally just a very small mass of cells and tissues.   Depending on the state, a majority permit first term abortion, and a decent amount permit late term abortion. My own argument being a vast majority of woman are typically aware they are pregnant by around 2-3 months."

AskReddit,3dy4bp,Ratelslangen2,188,Mon Jul 20 16:27:04 2015 UTC,"I took a philosophy class my freshman year of college, and we learned about a philosopher who described defining the line of what is acceptable and unacceptable to kill, based on intellect. We all know that some animals are pretty smart and can utilize tools, solve puzzles, and can communicate effectively with others of the same species and even humans. Forgive me for not knowing who the he is, but he says that if we define a line like this, we need to recognize the fact that some animal species will rise above it and that some humans (talking about those with mental disabilities and handicaps) will fall below it. May or may not contribute to conversation, but I thought it was worth sharing."

AskReddit,3dy4bp,paulb001,8,Mon Jul 20 22:47:05 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure Singer's work is geared towards the feeling of pain. The result is similar, in that some animals take precedence over some humans, but t wasn't based on intelligence. His argument was that the level of pain a being can feel should determine how hard it is to justify killing it. So in context, a puppy would be worth more than somebody in a vegetative state."
AskReddit,3dy4bp,Tehmuffin19,11,Tue Jul 21 01:47:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, his whole point is that intelligence ISN'T a good measure because if/when a human being fails to meet the arbitrary limit, they wouldn't suddenly lose their rights or status as a person. The result is that we can't rationally discriminate against non-human species based on intelligence, either. Basically by 'level of pain' it just means anything that demonstrates a complex reaction to pain stimulus. Anything that ""suffers"" is worthy of dignity. Incidentally sounds kinda buddhist."

I watched my girlfriend slowly deteriorate due to cancer. Her brain wasn't getting the blood it needed and for the last few months she simply couldn't process much at all. One time she remembered a game she enjoyed growing up called ""Old Maid"", not much different from ""Go Fish"". It was made for ages 3+, but she couldn't grasp the rules. She was enough there that she knew she should be able to understand, but couldn't. I've never seen someone more frustrated or disappointed with themselves. She was one of the smartest people I knew, and here she couldn't understand a game for children who aren't even in preschool.  I know that if I lose myself the way she did, I want to be put to sleep.

His life was already over, I simply gave him a graceful exit. On the other hand, I don't have the right to make that decision for an individual.  I think the best way would be similar to the ""do not resuscitate"" process. When a person is healthy, they should be able to decide if they don't want to live under extreme mental and/or physical conditions. Then, if those conditions are met, they could make the choice (for a second time) that they want to end their life. This way the family knows it was what they wanted both while they were healthy and while they were suffering. Nobody has blood on their hands, because nobody chose for them."

(I don't see it either, btw)  Free will is important because without it there is no love (something 'programmed' to love is not really loving), and while we continually use our free will to screw up his plan (e.g. by murdering someone which messes us up emotionally, and them physically), but he has thought about a way that his plan can still keep on track despite setbacks."

If you have no control over people, there's no way to keep a plan on track.  I mean imagine a small scale.  You get maybe 100 people together and put them in a warehouse.  You can control the environment- lighting and temperature and all- but you can't control anything the people choose to do.  On top of that, you haven't told any of them what the actual plan is.  So its just 100 people hanging out with no idea what they're supposed to be doing, none of them have ever met you, some of them have never even heard of you, and they all can make up their minds to do whatever they want.  Unless the 'plan' is just for you to watch and see what happens for your own entertainment, how could you possibly expect it to be achieved?  I just can't wrap my mind around how anyone believes there's someone up there that loves us and has a plan for us and can control anything he wants to, but chooses not to and lets people suffer immeasurably all the time for no apparent reason other than some ""master plan"" that is... what?  Peace and happiness for all his children?  Then why not just grant them that?  If you've every loved someone else you know you'd move the earth to stop them from suffering if you could, so how could any loving god allow it, even though he could stop it?

God has no qualms about striking people ill with cancer, allowing worms to eat out the entrails of poverty stricken children, or causing earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes that kill millions.   And even so, God wouldn't be infringing on someone's free will if he, for example, took a murderer and moved them away from their victims, or put an abusive father into a caring environment where he can see the harm he's doing, rather than trapping him in poverty with his frail wife and their infant.  And even if all evil somehow did come from human choices... human beings have become eerily good at predicting and directing a person's choice. Statistics can measure and predict the likely outcome of a large population. Psychology can predict the likely response to a given stimulus under certain conditions. Marketing is an actual field because we can do things that direct the flow of people. Child Development can accurately predict what conditions will cause what traits in children - all who, presumably, have free will.

I can't remember having seen any papers in physics discussing the possibility of those supernatural things being carried out by the tools we have in place to describe reality.  In short, those 12 / 36 (which are numbers I am not familiar with myself) dimensions have already been 'used up' in describing what we observe scientifically. You would need additional degrees of freedom to account for things like karma and ghosts, which are supernatural and defy the picture science is painting from observations.

Your language isn't terribly clear here, but if I understand you correctly, you are arguing that God can perceive all time in space, but he is somehow limited in how he creates. This creates a strange concept of God for me, where he is all knowing and beyond time, and he can still create things, but he somehow can't control how he creates things. Or he somehow can't create new things after he's created the first thing. Or he can only create Earth and humans as a species, but he can't create anything else on Earth to help direct his creations."

If you are a mature, stable adult that can provide for yourself, then by all means, smoke up Johnny. An adult should be able to do what they want with their own bodies.   But if you can't even put food on your own table without help in the form of government handouts (from me, essentially, through my tax dollars, which in all likelihood you're not paying either) then you don't need to be wasting your time and money doing drugs. You can live without them while I'm paying for your food and rent.  EDIT: Sorry, I guess this was unclear based on the point of this thread. My belief is that any adult should be able to do drugs, because it's their own bodies. The argument against is the welfare recipients.  EDIT AGAIN: This has drawn some attention so I'll clarify a bit. In this hypothetical world I'm referencing, since all adults are free to do what they wish with their own bodies, all drugs will be legalized and taxed. All the money that previously went to prohibition enforcement, plus the new dumptrucks full of tax revenue, can now be reallocated towards the cost of testing and to rehabilitation services."
AskReddit,3dy4bp,zorph,14,Mon Jul 20 22:00:44 2015 UTC,"I know this kind of approach sounds good in theory but even aside from cost efficiency arguments this kind of approach ignores the interrelationship of poverty, substance abuse and mental health issues. It assumes that everyone is in complete control of their lives and will make rational decisions which isn't the case, particularly in groups that are poor, uneducated, have little to no social support, are more likely to experience domestic/social problems and have greater instances of mental health issues.  For example, mental illness rates are generally higher in poorer areas where people have less access to medical support, because of that they are more likely to self-medicate with drugs which worsens their condition and you can see how the downward spiral goes on from there. Poverty, disadvantage and drug abuse are really, really complex issues that won't be solved by demonizing and removing support for those that are on that downward spiral trajectory. The kind of approach you outlined would not break the poverty cycle, in fact it would further entrench existing patterns of disadvantage."
AskReddit,3dy4bp,MattieShoes,21,Tue Jul 21 02:41:33 2015 UTC,"The thing is, enforcement of such things is not free, and you're paying for that too.  And that means every honest recipient of social aid costs the system way more than before.  Not enough enforcement might yield higher rates of fraud.  Too much enforcement and you're spending more protecting yourself from the fraud than you're saving from fraud prevention.  Logically, there's an equilibrium point.  Everything I've read suggests we're overspending on enforcement -- we overreact to the small percentage that are abusing the system.    Then there's the moral argument that we'd be punishing the dependents of addicts for something they're not at fault for.  But what are you going to do, take their kids away and put them in foster care?  That's really expensive too, and the foster system is really fucked up anyway, so you're trading one punishment for another.  TL;DR: drug testing social aid recipients is fucking retarded."

However, Country Y sees Country X building its military and thinks that now they might invade. So Country Y builds its military even more, and thus the cycle continues.

AskReddit,3dy4bp,dryerlintcompelsyou,243,Mon Jul 20 19:28:23 2015 UTC,"It's not my strongest belief, but I believe in strict anti-drug laws.  Reddit pretty much attempts to counter this on a daily basis  (Semirelated note: Please don't downvote this, I legitimately want to ask a question... but why do so many of you support drug legalization? Not bashing your belief or anything, just wondering why Reddit attracts this opinion)    EDIT: Okay, this post kind of exploded in replies. Let's get a few things straight:  I do NOT support hard jail time for drug users. The punishment should go to the dealers - the users should get rehabilitation and a chance to get back to normal.  The biggest thing I'm against is chemicals that negatively affect your consciousness/ability to think. It's a moral opposition, I just don't believe humans should be damaging their own brains. Sorry...  ""But what about alcohol?"" If it wasn't for the complete and utter failure of Prohibition, I'd be fine with banning alcohol :P    EDIT 2: Let's also make it clear - I understand that most of the stuff in this post will probably never be achieved. I'm putting this out there as more of an... ideal than something a politician would follow. It looks like most of Reddit imagines utopia as a place where we can all smoke weed freely and without intervention, well, I imagine utopia as a place where drug addictions and drug dependencies no longer exist. Not a police state, but a place where policing drugs is not necessary, because the use of drugs is a thing of the past. So basically a similar situation as the creators of communism - never gonna happen. Ah, screw it, I'm a naive idiot, and I'm tired"
AskReddit,3dy4bp,thainebednar,33,Mon Jul 20 16:50:46 2015 UTC,"Just go look at the improvement that Portugal saw after legalizing narcotics. Addiction rates halved over several years and I think there was a drop in crime as well. By legalizing the drugs and supplying them through strict regulation (see what basically every country does with alcohol) you take money away from the real criminals like the cartels. By treating addiction like an illness instead of a crime you help the citizens of your country instead of hurting them. Addicts often have some sort of mental illness that only gets exacerbated by drug abuse. The argument for the prohibition of drugs is that drugs create crime, but usually the opposite is true. Remember how North America had a prohibition on alcohol? Remember how terribly it failed? There was still rampant alcohol use through all levels of society and the influx of dirty money let organized crime flourish in an unregulated market. Not to mention people often were drinking poor quality alcohol that was dangerous to drink due to varying concentrations of ethanol (no regulation, no labels, no standards) and often would have dangerous byproducts of poor brewing/distillation (see methanol).  Prohibition doesn't stop drug use, the amount of drugs that go into the U.S. alone increases year after year with no sign of slowing. We see the same things happening today, drugs continually go through various countries borders and the funds all go to terrorists or criminal groups.   So basically it comes down to this- prohibition doesn't work, and probably never will unless you want some Orwell level of ""security"". So a common solution that comes up is to legalize, regulate AND TAX THE LIVING SHIT OUT OF IT. Then we have safe drugs (you know what's actually in them and at what percentage) where the money can go back into the government/communities instead of criminals who perpetuate violence to make sure their cash flow doesn't stop. When drug dealers want there to be prohibition there is a problem, that should be obvious."
AskReddit,3dy4bp,Slobotic,178,Mon Jul 20 19:29:55 2015 UTC,"Since you ask:   I support drug legalization for the same reason I support free speech, and also because it would be a better policy in the interest of health and safety.  Leaving something legal is not an endorsement. When the Supreme Court ruled that burning an American flag is constitutionally protected it did so not because they think burning the flag is a fine thing to do, but because ""the flag protects those who hold it in contempt.""   Legalizing drugs would not be the same thing as endorsing their use or abuse. It is saying simply, ""this is your decision"", just like the decision to say and do offensive but constitutionally protected things, or to eat junk food, or waste your money on frivolous things.  As a health and safety policy legalization would allow people struggling with addiction to safely get the help they need. It would allow for meaningful regulation of an entirely unregulated market which would cut back on overdose deaths and deaths caused by synthetic or counterfeit drugs. Most people buying heroin have no idea what they're actually getting. They don't know how strong it is, what it's cut with, or even whether it's actually heroin as opposed to a strong benzoate cut with baby laxative. The benzoate is more likely to cause a fatal OD. Also, the benzoate may make a person feel high but will not be the dose of opiates their body craves and so their next dose of actual heroin will be more likely to cause a fatal OD.  Moves in the direction of legalization include the free distribution of clean needles to help stop the spread of HIV/AIDS and other diseases and protection from prosecution for someone who calls 911 to save someone who is in medical distress. (In some states if two people are getting high together, one ODs and the other calls 911 to safe his life, that guy could get arrested. This is a perverse incentive to allow someone to die rather than call 911.)  Drug prohibition has been tried for a long time and has absolutely failed in its stated goal of reducing drug use. What it has done instead is filled prisons and made it impossible to regulate the shit that is being sold on the streets and harder to keep away from kids.   Any economist could tell you that the profit motivation for selling drugs is high enough that the threat of incarceration will not curb the drug trade. Not even the threat of execution or death by rival cartels/dealers will do that. All it does is drive up the price of the crop which further incentivizes poor farmers to grow poppies, coca, or marijuana rather than other less profitable cash crops.   Legalization would allow for the taxation of the drug trade as well, which money could be used for drug rehabilitation and education.   Fundamentally I think health decisions, even bad ones, belong to each individual. Laws should protect private and public interests; they should not be in place to protect mentally competent adults from their own poor life decisions. But even if that were a legitimate basis for law I think drug prohibition has failed miserably by that standard."

People will still get the drugs if you make it illegal, and they will get lower quality drugs that could poison them.

AskReddit,3e44hj,I_Threw_The_Fork,3,Tue Jul 21 21:40:59 2015 UTC,"My best friend from 6th grade.  Nerdy kid with thick glasses.  He was a musical prodigy, he could play every Metallica song on the drums, and could pull off some pretty decent Stevey Ray Von, when he was 12.  We bonded over Rollerblading (it was the 90s) and comedy .We would have a every Saturday to watch SNL (Mike Myers Dana Carvey Days).  The sweetest kid.    When we got it to high school he kind of grew into his own.  We smoked pot like most kids did, experimented with other stuff. One time in the hall way he opened his mouth and showed me that he had 3 hits of acid on his tongue, but he could handle it, nothing too crazy. He was super charming.  He co-hosted the public access show me and our other friends did in high school. He could skip class and sweet talk the teacher into letting it slide every time. Eventually becoming our home coming king, even though he wasn't the typical preppy jock that always got elected, he was just that slick.  After High School we still hung out but he had another group of friends that got him pretty heavy in harder drugs like coke and Meth.  Do to his charm, he was able to hide it for a while but eventually his charm wore off and people stopped believing his lies. I caught him in my parents house once stealing change from my dads change jar.  We had a pretty open door policy at my house so I wasn't surprised to see him, but he made a quick excuse to leave and thats when I noticed the change jar on the stove, not where it was supposed to be.  I got pissed and called him and told him to stay away from me and my house until he got some help.  A few months later he joined the Air Force to clean him self up.  When he got out a couple years later he looked great.  Cleaned up, gained some weight, and his eyes weren't sucked into his head anymore. I was so proud of him, and so happy to have my old friend back.  By this time I had bought a house and had a room to rent so offered it him, and he moved in.  Things were great, for a while.  Then he started to slip back into his old ways.  But again it was hard to tell because charming people become good liars and good liars turn into pathological liars. I looked in his room one day and saw that it was a pit, it looked like a crack den, but I just figured he was messy and as long as the mess didn't seep into the rest of the house I didn't care.    Until one day I come home from a trip and find the place a complete disaster.  Some SUPER skinny girl sitting on the floor and some strange dude asleep on my couch with baking pan of half eaten chicken strips on my coffee table.  There was garbage everywhere.  The mess had seeped.  I was pissed.  My grandmother was in town, and she was on her way over to see my house.  I flipped and told him I was leaving and the house better be spotless when I got back in a hour.  Luckily, the one thing Meth heads are good at is cleaning up quickly. The next day I told him he needed to move out and to not to talk to me again. That was 12 years ago.  I saw him a couple years ago at a mutual friends wedding. He is living in half way house now, doing odd jobs and still struggling with addiction.  We talked a little but I could not too get close.  He tries to reach out to me on Facebook every now and then but I ignore it.  I feel like a kid who has been bit by a dog.  No matter how innocent the dog looks I know that as soon as I feel comfortable, the dog is going to try and fuck me again.  I miss his friendship because when he is not fucked up he is a fun, funny, talented person who has my exact same since of humor because we grew up cultivating it together. He could have been so many great things with the talents he had. He could have been a great musician, or a kick ass salesman with his personality but it was all thrown away. I just couldn't take the lies that I believed so many times and I could never trust anything he ever told me again.   TLDR:  Fuck Meth"

Claimed qualifications usually only completed by guys with 8 years or more service. We followed up and did a phone interview just out of sheer curiosity. Told him that our regulator would require proof of military quals and schooling ( They actually do.) He stated that his DD214 and evaluations from his time Navy were left on the ship because the CO had not signed them and that they were supposed to mail them to him. He then told us they accidently sent them to the Navy's record vault and that he had been informed that the vault had burnt down and that his records were lost forever.

We used to omit technical questions during the interviews, instead trying to get a feel for how a new employee might fit in.  One woman impressed our team during the interview with a resume containing experience in the following areas: Linux Unix AIX Shell scripting C++ Programming etc  Her second day, I asked her to decompress a few ZIP files, and recombine them into a single ZIP. She asked me what a ZIP file was. She didn't last long.  We ALWAYS ask a few pointed technical questions during the interviews now.  EDIT: I didn't actually post the job description of what we do. It's IT Project Management with a heavy dose of client relations and technical support thrown in. We're kind of ""IT Project Management Plus"" though. For instance, we don't just define needs and then let another team come up with a design. We define the need, come up with a design, come up with all the testing requirements, etc. We spend as much time on the phone with clients as we do with our heads buried in data files.  The sad thing about all this was that up front, someone doesn't necessary NEED to be an expert in everything. We have people who worked tech support for Dell. I used to be a network engineer with some supplemental programming experience. One of our team members used to be a Sergeant in the army, and his strong management skills offset a minor lack of tech talent up front. Different clients need different breeds of support to keep them on track. It takes about a year to bring ANY new hire completely up to speed. We can train intelligent people on how to do stuff.

Haven't taken a CS class since), along with some history of how this developed into a science.  Never talked about what a ZIP file was because... well it's too basic even for a 100 level class. When you're teaching 20-somethings CS and they've all had computers since they were little kids, I can see how teachers would skip over it. It would be like teaching 100-level art students how to use MS paint or teaching a 100-level biology student that rocks aren't alive. Or (to add a funny one) teaching Psych students that phrenology is bullshit.  Just to play devil's advocate a little bit... I can see why and how something so simple would be skipped over.

I give all that background to lead up to the point that this guy was an AWFUL coder. He literally hacked together bits and pieces from across the Internet until he had a semblance of what he needed, didn't comment any of it, and then tried to pass it off as his own work.

The next day during a rather dull meeting, I was flipping through a major software QA forum I used to frequent, and low and behold all the questions are posted there by someone who's just created an account. He used headings like Really hard question please help!!, then copy and pasted the question about testing a calculator and you press the number 6 and nothing happened - what would you do next to try to isolate the problem (try again, try a different number, try a different calculator, enter 3+3, etc). Seriously not rocket science especially for someone with ""QA Certification"" and 5-10 years experience. Everyone on the forums told him to do his own damn work thankfully.   Dude even used his first and last name to make the account name.   When he returned his questionnaire, he'd clearly had two friends helping him - and not only that he didn't proofread their responses. One answer started with a nicely formatted bulleted list then quickly changed to block paragraphs with the worst possible segue I've ever seen I was embarrassed for him that he could leave it in.... It read:   I agree with Robert but you may want to add...   Clearly he'd just copied and pasted both his friends answers and mailed it off to us.  I chatted with HR and we agreed though it would be great fun to bring him in and make him cry, that probably wouldn't be the right thing to do. Instead we sent our regrets and blacklisted him from being hired ever.   Shortly afterwards, HR expanded their reference and degree checking to include degrees from other countries as well.   TL;DR: Fake degrees and certifications, cheated on questionnaire, didn't even proofread his buddy's answers - blacklisted from ever being hired at company"

AskReddit,3dykaq,CaspianX2,175,Mon Jul 20 22:58:02 2015 UTC,"Not a hiring manager, and not really a resume, but still somewhat relevant. At the time, I worked as a product representative for a computer company. At one point, when my sister was looking for work, I recommended her to my boss, and he hired her. She ended up being a damn good employee, and stayed with the company much longer than I did.  This is not a story about her.  I also have a little brother who has a... spotty employment history. His first three jobs, he got fired from in rather spectacular fashion. Bear in mind that these are all his version of events. Heaven only knows what the other versions would sound like.  His first job was working for a fast food joint. One evening, a customer walks in who was apparently just joking around and being annoying, and then walked out without ordering. Joker then gets in his car and goes through the drive-through. Brother gets him his drink and Joker responds by doing that thing that kids do, where you use the straw to blow the straw wrapper off as a projectile. Wrapper flies through the air, right by brother's head, missing him. Brother flips out, and as Joker is pulling out of the lot, brother takes another cup of soda and flings it at the back of Joker's car.  ""What the hell?"" I ask my brother.  ""I hate it when people spit in my face.""  ""But... but he didn't spit in your face. He blew a piece of paper at you. And you said it didn't even touch you!""  ""I don't care, I hate it when people spit in my face.""  Whatever.  Brother's next job is working at a coffee shop. While working there, he became good friends with the low-level manager, and one day the two of them were talking about a co-worker my brother despised.  ""I just want to slit her wrists,"" my brother tells him.  Apparently unfazed by this and just laughing along, manager says, ""Why the wrists? Cutting someone's throat would be faster.""  ""I don't want it to be fast,"" my brother responds.  Apparently, said co-worker was standing right there listening during this conversation.  His third job was working for a car insurance/repair/travel agency. He was so astonished that his large black co-worker's wife was a small Asian woman (?) that he apparently made a scene about it. Yeah, I don't even know. It didn't make sense to me either.  So it's at this point that he asks me, ""Hey, so you think you can get me a job with [computer company]?""  ""What? Are you serious? After all that stuff you just told me?""  ""Yeah. I don't have a job now and I need one.""  ""But you don't know anything about computers! You don't even like them! Why would you even want to work for [computer company]?""  ""I need work. So, can you give me a good recommendation to your boss?""  ""No. Sorry, I'm afraid I can't.""  You know what's scary? These days, he works for TSA."

So, IDK my dad must've been some sort of manager responsible for hire back then, because one day he comes home and just sits down and shakes his head. This young woman had applied with average references and qualifications and her application didn't stick out at first - then the secretary showed my dad the picture of herself that fell out of the envelope: It was her, in a bikini, at the beach, with a wardrobe malfunction. Now, I have seen brazen attempts to be hired based on looks alone in my (later) time, but, Jesus Christ, you pull that shit at the interview! Not in the application! Another time, he tells me about this guy, who put it on paper that he had worked at a certain company that the holding of my dad's company also owned. Nothing easier to check, and BOOM, he never worked there. Apparently he tried to bluff himself into a job all over town, always giving references with companies he had previously interviewed at, because then he had met people there and knew names, what the office looked like, etc. There was this one interview, that I was present for, where we looked for someone to start an appreticeship with our company. Apart from the 40+ crazy lady that must've worked in every industry know to men for about 3 months over her lifetime, there was this one other gal. She was the age you usualy start this stuff at (17/18), but her voice was so tiny that my boss had to ask her to speak up several times. She then displayed such a misunderstanding of what she would GET from being employed that everyone at the office was incredulous. As the lowest rank at the office, she expected her own office with a door she could close, severely over-estimated the pay she would get (factor of 3, in fact), asked whether her grandma could get medical benefits under her coverage, and DECLINED politely to work through all of the departments. Like ""No, thank you, I don't think that will be necessary. I don't like archiving files. That was so dusty at my last job."" The best thing was that her tiny voice got very confident at the exact wrong times: Every time she had to sell herself she got real quiet, every time she wanted something or said what she wouldn't do she got very confident. A mouse-madwoman combo. Never seen anything like it. She was so convinced she got the position that my boss needed an additional 6 minutes of arguing with her for her to actually leave. By that point she was furious, of course."

His amateur looking resume indicated that he was project manager for the electricals on some kind of infrastructure project, the details of which I cannot quite recall. I think it was a dam, waterworks or a locks. Something like that.   Without question this is the kind of responsibility given only to an engineer with decades of experience and here was this 24 year old trying to convince me, and my technical department manager that he had overseen a major project like this. The lie was made even more obvious as he could only display a very basic understanding of electrical engineering upon questioning. When we asked him his salary requirement it was at the same time far higher than what any junior engineer in any company in my industry could command, and yet far lower than what he would easily command had he indeed had the experience he claimed to have.

We are so set about becoming better than the next guy that as a society we try to limit others so we can put ourselves on a higher platform.  If you want some relevant examples of this, please direct your attention to post civil war southeast where poor white men were extremely oppressive to newly freed slaves. the newly freed men were growing in power and could soon be seen as equals, so Jim Crow Laws were put into place to oppress them, as a result, the poor white people would feel empowered despite usually still being in a bad situation.  In today's context we see it as ""keeping up with the Jones"". we want so badly to be the best. And people will try to force the argument that school isn't for everybody, they will use that argument so far as to try and define who and who isn't fit for an education. Now who is anybody to say ""hey, you want to learn about science or math, or art? well its not right for YOU to learn it."" People are fools, and our want to be recognized and appreciated for our efforts lead us to these hierarchies. We want to be the best and ""rise the ladder"" of success.

For example, why does a rich kid have more opportunity have any more opportunity for an education than a poor kid? they're both kids, right? which one of them deserves it more? which one has more potential? which one is smarter? more athletic? it doesn't always matter. But what we do know is that the rich kid can afford to go there.  And something inherent in the system creates our hierarchical structures. That's one reason why Americans can't stand socialism and communism. We worship hierarchies. and there is plenty of reason why. But its mainly so we can point to people high up and say ""this person has made something of themself, this person is a hardworker"". So in a way, anything that can break that hierarchy devalues everything the people up top worked really hard for. I'm not saying put everybody on a level playing field.

They probably can't imagine not being able to do basic math or anything like that. And the best way I know to learn the value of something is to not have it or have it and then it be taken away. People probably just can't fathom the value.  But then there are those who have seen those without an education and they realize what they could have been, what they wouldn't have been capable of, and what it would have forced them to do.

Being one of the biggest states with the biggest populations, the education bureaucracies  find it easier to buy textbooks in bulk, and just stick with one standard.

When someone calls into question your political stance they're questioning your identity as a person and that does not lead to reasoned argument.  That's not to say that other less religious countries are bastions of free thought (looking at the UK and their problems with political compromise) but there are fewer barriers at least.

AskReddit,3e2ous,equalescape,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:07:33 2015 UTC,"L.A. Confidential. Although, lately with Ferguson and other racially problematic police behavior, it serves as a reminder that the hard boiled Noir cops of 1950s L.A. haven't changed too much.   The film itself is tremendous, with stunning performances from the three leading men: Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, and Guy Pearce. Kim Basinger and other supporting characters are also so on point. The shootout at the end is beautifully lit, shot, and acted."

AskReddit,3e3r7v,Frozesolid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:45:40 2015 UTC,"I actually don't pee in the shower ever.  I did when I was younger and one day I remember standing in the shower and I looked at my feet surrounded by the water that had yet to drain and I had a revelation.  Once I was finished and out of the bathroom I went to my mom and said, ""Mommy, my feet must be the cleanest part of my whole body.  They spend the entire shower in water.  They're constantly being washed in there.""  She said, ""My boy, all that dirt and germs that you're washing off your body is in that water that's soaking around your feet.  I sincerely hope your feet are not the cleanest part of your body and if you really think that at this moment, they are, then you need another shower.""  My next shower I was standing there, cleaning myself, and I started peeing.  I watched the pee hit the same water I was standing in and the two liquids started mixing together.  I realized that I pretty much just peed on my feet.  So I turned the shower off, let all the water drain so I could be sure that there was no more pee in the water, then I continued my shower.  Haven't pee'd in the shower since.  I pee right before getting in the shower."
AskReddit,3e3r7v,CM1990,2,Tue Jul 21 20:25:46 2015 UTC,unless your shower drains shitty I don't see the issue... im a guy and just shoot it right down the drain
AskReddit,3e3r7v,Frozesolid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:27:40 2015 UTC,"The shower we had at the time probably did drain shitty, but this was like 15-18 years ago.    I just don't see a reason to pee in the shower and I think it's kind of gross that so many people do it.  That's where you go to get clean, stop peeing on it. haha  I actually explain this story to room-mate in hopes that they'll just stop peeing in the shower.  I don't like thinking about standing where a bunch of people have pee'd.  And I thought only guys did it! Fuck was I wrong.  Now I've never watched a girl pee, but would they not just be basically pissing between their ankles?  I think it's way worse for a girl to pee in the shower because you're right, as a male, we can aim for that hole and minimize the the affected area.  But girls...I just imagine them peeing on their feet all the time.  No wonder so many of them hate feet. haha  Like I said, I used to pee in the shower.  Everytime I showered actually.  But sometime between the age of 8 and 12 and decided, ""well, this is fuckin gross and I'm not doing it anymore."""

I think I've read a different one before where it was a person in a catatonic state after being tortured/raped, so it made more sense to picture someone in a hospital setting with people telling them to wake up."
AskReddit,3dxpy9,TabbyCaterpillar,247,Mon Jul 20 18:28:43 2015 UTC,"From kym   The “wake up” meme started as a creepypasta that has become a meme involving seemingly normal and generally positive sentences that suddenly write “wake up” in larger lettering.  It is unknown where this meme originated but one could assume that it was created for a creepypasta site and adapted on sites such as tumblr, facebook etc.  There are many similar texts that follow the same theme, but this is one of the original texts: It has been reported that some victims of torture, during the act, would retreat into a fantasy world from which they could not wake up. In this catatonic state, the victim lived in a world just like their normal one, except they weren’t being tortured. The only way that they realized they needed to wake up was a note they found in their fantasy world. It would tell them about their condition, and tell them to wake up. Even then, it would often take months until they were ready to discard their fantasy world and please wake up.  this version of the text cannot be called the ‘original’ as stories similar to this have been around for a long time and the true original seems to be buried in the old corners of the internet.  other adaptations apply for their respective websites, such as the tumblr version that is about rape, the facebook version about a coma and various other unfortunate predicaments.  the meme itself can involve anything from long texts that slowly start to give readers an uneasy feeling by saying “wake up” in increasing frequency, to short jokes that put a little too much emphasis on the “wake up”.  the optimal “wake up” meme will include no reference to rape, comas, or torture and will seem to appear out of nowhere, barely noticed by the viewer.  Please, wake up."

We made some friends during preschool but didn't really know anyone in our new town. A couple months into first grade and winter is upon us. My brother and I are staring out the window enjoying the beauty of the fresh fallen snow and filled to the brim with excitement of a snow day. As we sit and stare out the window talking about sledding and snowmen, we notice someone come out of the house across the street. Now mind you it's winter, so he was dressed to the nines in snow gear. He seemed to be our age so we ask our mother who it is. She comes to the window and explains that that was one of the friends we had made last year. We got super excited and our mother starts to pull out all of our snow gear so we can go out to play with him.  We continue to watch our new neighbor and friend as he calmly walks outside, makes his way over to a tree in almost a foot of snow, drops his pants to his ankles and leaves his mark on the fresh winter blanket. When he was finished, he simlpy went back inside and started to pull off all of his snow gear as if there was no other motive for going outside in 25° weather. We're 25 now and still the best of friends. Hard to beleive it only took some rear nudity to make a lifetime connection"

This was, of course, due to Extra Magic Hours keeping the parks open late and guests not leaving.  Anyway, I just remember being in the jewelry store restocking some items and my partners went away with the tills, leaving me alone in a dimly lit building.  Now, you have to remember this is not only Disney World, its the Magic Kingdom on Main Street.  It's the only artery in or out of the park for guests and there's always music playing.  I'm used to the noise.  Not this time, it's dead silent. The music shut off as did the lights on the street.   It was just...very creepy feeling like I was the only one in the park even though I knew I wasn't.  I even stepped outside and just absorbed the silence, it's just...kinda unnerving.

He was very drunk and I was scared shitless because I thought he might literally attack me over change.

AskReddit,3e2k8k,derppoolthulu,9,Tue Jul 21 16:05:28 2015 UTC,"I used to work the overnight shift at a radio station, ran the boards and such for a cluster of stations. One of the stations was an easy listening station that ran a show called ""Delilah"". A satellite show that played cheesy songs hosted by a very soft spoken woman, Delilah, that played requests for what seemed like nothing but very depressed people or people who just lost a family member to some horrible illness. The guy who trained me would crack jokes about the callers who would call up and ask to talk to Delilah. They didn't realize it was a syndicated show and that she wasn't actually in the local studio. Anyway, multiple times a week I would get calls from listeners wanting to request a song to kill themselves to or people wanting to talk to Delilah about how they're going to kill themselves. Sometimes it would just be super lonely, depressed people who just wanted to talk to someone. More depressing than scary but it would always shake me to the core. At first I would just give them the actual request line for the show but eventually I would either talk with them or give them a number for a suicide hotline. I can clearly remember talking to a few people and thinking that I was probably the last person that they would talk to before doing something awful to themselves."

AskReddit,3e2k8k,derppoolthulu,3,Tue Jul 21 16:42:10 2015 UTC,"It was weird. The conversation was usually,  Caller: ""I'm thinking off killing myself could you play ""blah blah"" for me? That song just means so much to me."" Me: ""I think you need to call the suicide hotline and not the Delilah show. Here, call this number and speak with a councilor.""  I was in no way trained to deal with that kind of thing so I just did my best. The worst part was that the show was recorded during the day and aired at night so there was no way to get the request through to anyone. I would tell them to call the suicide hotline and in the meantime I'd try to get the song on for them. I would usually just hang up and sit in silence for a couple of minutes. All kinds of fucky."

We had a guy and girl walk in around 9:45, so I just let them know we would be closing in 15 minutes and could make them their drinks in to go cups if they wanted, but they would need to be out by 10.   It was immediately obvious they were high, the girl had a very glassy eyed look, and the guy was just smiling. The girl kept asking if she could have one of the shot glasses we used to pull espresso shots, which I told her no. She asked for a spoon and again I told her no. She started freaking out and reached over the counter to try and grab the shot glass, I moved them away, so she grabbed espresso cups and started breaking them on the ground yelling. Then her boyfriend grabbed the dish on the kiosk for dirty spoons and they both ran into the bathroom and locked themselves in. My co-worker called the police and then a manager.   The police showed up and the manager showed up, got a key to unlock the washrooms (as we for some reason didn't have one). They were shooting up in the washroom, blood was everywhere. The guy was pulled out by the cops, but the girl needed to be left for the paramedics. I didn't work closing shifts for a long time after that."

It was them or Starbucks and this place had nicer sofas to sit on. I would see a lot of stoners who would get high in the forest preserve then walk around and into the shop to get something to drink or a deli sandwich, nothing that was a big deal. However I noticed a trend amung some of the pot heads, they would often get a coffee, throw tons of sugar, honey and crap into but never use the spoon. They would then drink it down as if they were waiting for some secret alarm to sound. Always they get up and go right to the bathroom but as always the spoon is gone. If they dont return in 5 minutes they are already needle deep. I dont use the bathrooms at that coffee shop no matter how much they clean it, I'll go take a piss in the woods while all the stoners light up thinking no one knows what they are doing standing out in the woods in a group."

One night she was so tired that she just fell asleep on her chair resting her head on the desk wearing her lab coat, when  her alarm woke her up like 12 min later for her next trial she found her lab coat all covered with lines made with a pen... Just random lines all over the coat.  She told us that she just started crying like crazy,  left everything behind the way it was,  ran to her car and went home.

AskReddit,3e2k8k,ajp12290,5,Tue Jul 21 14:40:25 2015 UTC,"Working late at my company as i typically do, I like not having anyone around to interrupt my process or phone to ring. So there I am, in a 25,000 sq/ft warehouse, lights are on, music is on and I am getting work done. The next thing I know is I see red and blue lights through the windows but think nothing of it, the firehouse is just down the street, I see their lights all the time. Then my loading dock door begins to shudder as it looks like a pissed off bull is trying to break down the dock doors.   Quickly I rush to the door to see a rather large man hanging over the loading dock guard rail, all dressed in black from what I could see and whamming on the door with all his might. Not thinking I lift the dock doors and yell in the face of this person, ""What the fuck is wrong with you, we have a front door and besides it's almost midnight, what the fuck do you want!?""  Then I see the guy's face, then I see the gun in his hand, then his face, back to the gun as I notice the safety is on. He hits me with it across the side of the face, knocking me the ground. What I see next with only half vision as my eye is starting to swell and blood is covering that side of my face, is two cops dive over the guard rail, into the building, screaming at the guy to stop. A third cop runs to my side and asks me if I'm ok, obviously I am not and I believe at that point calls for the medics to come over the radio.   I think I lost track of time because the next thing I remember is being on the gurney and the medics are checking me out. I watch as they drag this guy out of my building. Turns out they caught him when he tried to use the back door to escape. This would have worked if only my property owner had not put a 10 foot high security fence around all his property. The guy opened the back door and had a fence staring at him in the face then turned around and got put down by two POPO. I guess they tazered him, a lot, which I was pleased to hear.  The cop who was making sure i was alright asked why I think the guy hit me instead of just shooting me. I told him I noticed his safety was on and he probibly had a full magazine but had no idea what he was doing, like most people who run from the cops. Couple of people laughed and that was it. Though I do have a small fear that he will come back to get some sort of insane revenge because that's what stupid violent people do."

Usually it's some idiot who's had too much to drink and couldn't get laid that night or something. One time the door bursts open around 2am and two guys came running straight at our baking table towards the front. Turns out they were running from the cops and were tackled by them as soon as they had made it out the front door but for a split second it seemed like they were breaking in to attack us or something.

Anyway, we were fortunate enough to have this crazy local woman stay with us for about 3 nights. She was unwashed, almost anorexic and had dyed blue hair. Based on her skin colour and general appearance I'd say she was a frequent drug user. One evening, my boss caught her using a breast pump in the communal eating area. Tits out, just going at it as if she were a cow.  My creepy experience was the night after. At around 9pm I dimmed most of the lights, locked the front door and went into the office. At about 3am the doorbell goes, so I go to check it out. No one. I turn around and she's there. Face pressed up against a window, just staring at me.   I did what any reasonable person would do. Slightly opened the door, yelled goodnight and ran to my office and locked the door."

In the end, I think the best thing would be for there not to be heaven or hell at all.  There is literally nothing which can be done in a finite life which justifies either endless reward or endless punishment.  Instead, why not have a person relive the lives of everyone else in the world they touched?  To see themselves as the world  saw them and their place in it?  The humanitarian would live out the lives of those he brought aid to.  He would truly be given a chance to see his contribution and the gratitude of those he helped.  He would get to see those people go on to live their lives better for him having been there.  Likewise a violent and abusive husband and father would relive his life through the eyes of his spouse and children.  He would feel the children's terror when he struck his wife... And watch as his actions influence them in their lives, and see those that they would go on to hurt in his image.    And everything in between.  ...  Or you can expand the idea one step further."

If you didn't accept their church during your life, you basically get a second chance in the afterlife, because the good Mormons in Spirit Paradise send missionaries to Spirit Prison (where bad people/non-believers go). Paradise and Prison are just temporary too, until Judgment Day when everyone gets their final destination decided. Even if you still don't want to be Mormon by judgment day, you still get to go to heaven, just a lesser heaven and you don't get to become a God like in the higher heavens. Only like a handful of people actually go to hell according to Mormonism, and to do so requires having a perfect knowledge of God's truth and then still rejecting him, so only like Prophets and shit can qualify for that. So, ""realistically"", your worst case scenario is that you get into heaven, and best case scenario is you get to become a God."

The workers at their Colombian plantation wanted better working conditions, which United Fruit didn’t want to give them. This resulted in the Colombian army setting up mounted machine guns around the strikers, and systematically mowing them down. Later, they changed their name to Chiquita, which is a word you can see on nearly every banana in the grocery store today. But wait, there’s more.  In 1954, the Guatemalan president Jacobo Arbenz Guzman was implementing a revised labor code that would effectively take 40 percent of United Fruit Company’s land away. At that time, Guatemala was basically United Fruit’s playground, so rather than take the losses, they responded by initiating a coup d’etat that overthrew the entire government, dissolving the country into 36 years of civil war that had an estimated death toll of up to 250,000.  So by this time United Fruit had become Chiquita, and washed their hands of Latin politics for good. Except, they didn’t. In 2004, Chiquita was accused by the Justice Department of paying money to a right-wing terrorist group in Colombia to protect their plantations. And then they turned around and provided funding to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia, a leftist terrorist group that has in the past been involved in a plot to assassinate Hugo Chavez."

AskReddit,3e3r1r,Errtsee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:00:13 2015 UTC,"I always wanted to do something like a rock or pop anthem. Write a song over a few minutes, have it sell well enough because a big band or singer sings it, recoup the royalties for years after it plays endlessly on the radio. A few years ago, ""About A Boy"" was based on the same idea. A man lives off the royalties of a Christmas pop song his father wrote decades earlier. Brilliant.  About three years ago, I made a stupid t-shirt design based on the throwaway line in Jurassic Park that the raptors tested the electric fences. A little later, I made one that looked more like the film logo and (more recently) I made one in blue when the Jurassic World trailers showed the logo in blue instead of red.  In the last two months, for something that took me a little over an hour a few years ago (and minimal time for the tweaks - after all, the logo is just a font and geometric shapes in the right place), I've earned enough in commission to pay for my weekend coffee shop visits for the year. All thanks to Chris Pratt and the success of Jurassic World.   The rate of return for that one hour's work is outstanding.  Now: I DID sell two tickets for Michael Jackson (with Kim Wilde as the supporting act) for the BAD Tour at Wembley Stadium for a £400 profit, but that wasn't easy. The tie-breaker I used (""Michael Jackson drinks Pepsi because... it means more to him than mere Bubbles"") was considered long and hard before it was submitted."

White ink has very poor coverage and fades incredibly fast, it's even worse than yellow and red.  This is why hardly anyone gets white ink tattoos.  In the last few years there have been improvements in the formulation of white ink, and the quality is improving, but they still tend to not look good after a few years (less than 5).  There's also the reality that many black guys with tattoos get them in prison, and prison tattoo ink is generally made from carbon ash, and thus is always a blue-black color."

AskReddit,3e2m0f,Skarbjorn,2,Tue Jul 21 14:40:13 2015 UTC,Hypothetical scenario     We know that Joe is a major (bad stuff) dealer and drives a blue sedan license plate 123 ABCD.   We have good reason to believe that he sells downtown.  So the cops put out an alert that a toddler is missing from a park downtown and was last seen with a man (Joe's description) in a blue sedan with plates 123 ABCD.  It is believed the man is armed and the child may be inthe trunk so do not approach if you think you see him or the vehicle.   Just call emergency services.   The child's name has been withheld to protect the innocent. And to further protect the child their parents' name/s are also being withheld.   Anyone who hears that and is far more likely to be on the look out vs. a known ___ dealer has been seen in this blah blah blah.
AskReddit,3e2m0f,DarkPoppies,4,Tue Jul 21 14:54:32 2015 UTC,"And what's so great about this, is that because the ""identity"" of the ""child"" is kept secret, the fact that this was all a ruse. also, Warrant law says that if anything illegal is uncovered in plan sight during an investigation, whether or not it relates to the case being investigated, it's fair game. So when the cops find the guy and pop the trunk to look for the ""toddler"" and find a whole bunch of the aforementioned bad stuff, the cops can just arrest him for that. Tldr; Cops find loop hole, (bad stuff) dealers beware!"

AskReddit,3e2m0f,Got2Go,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:56:15 2015 UTC,"Basically, people will call and say where, when, and in what direction the car was going (ex South on Main St. around 2:00pm).  The hope is that someone else will see the car after the first person (South on Main St. around 2:30pm). The hope is that the police can follow the criminals' path, to where they are hiding out."
AskReddit,3e2m0f,rwmmwr,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:21:04 2015 UTC,My assumption is that since the amber and silver alerts are for missing children and elderly people that they get more people to actively try to help and report on the info the police need.

We had given 3 out of 6 away to friends and such and one of the people we gave one too called us, like a week or a couple weeks after we gave one to them and asked us if we would take it back and we said 'of course'. And so we got there at their house to pick it up and one of her eyes was in really bad shape like she hit it on something (which is easy for pugs to do) and it looked really bad, to the point where shes partially blind in that eye after all the care we gave to her with it. But yeah, it was like one of those scenarios, they wanted her because she was a puppy but once things became too involved they gave up, they NEVER took her to the vet for her eye injury and it looked like it had been injured for a while because by the time we were able to care for it it was too late and she ended up partially blind in it, like i said. Whereas if she had been treated right away her vision may have been saved.  We still have her to this day (and changed her name because her name before was stupid) and shes in much better care and im so glad we got her out of that household she was in, they didnt seem very well off, like they didnt even have the means to care for a puppy"

I had zero sleep the night before, and had to be back down by 8am.  Car crossed the highway, hit a rock cut, flipped 4 or 5 times and ended up upside down. If I had done this 1km earlier or later, there would have been a huge drop instead of a rock to hit, and I definitely would have died.  Somehow (limp body?) I managed to walk away with a black eye and a burn on my hand from the airbag coming out. I had most of my stuff piled on the shoulder by the time EMS arrived.  The car was totaled. The quarter panels were torn off, the nose was crashed in, all of the windows were broken, and both axles were snapped. I am incredibly lucky to be alive. My Volvo station wagon's thick steel plate was the only reason the engine block didn't drive into the passenger compartment.  Never drive tired. It's worse than driving drunk.

It was pretty cool - a new gym opened called Orangetheory Fitness (OTF), that does heart rate based workouts.  Every day is a different workout, each workout is an hour long, led by a coach, and the other members are all friendly and cool.  I was doing this 5-7 days/wk.  I dropped 30 lbs in < 5 months, and my wife started making comments about my physique.  Two weeks ago, when I did a body comp, I was 212.5 lbs, and 12% body fat (6'3"" tall).  Then my goals shifted from ""lose weight"" to ""build muscle"".  So I started up at another local gym.  Now I do:  Mondays: chest/triceps  Tuesdays: OTF  Wednesdays: Still setting my schedule - not sure if this will be legs/shoulders, or biceps/back  Thursdays: OTF  Fridays: Still setting my schedule - not sure if this will be legs/shoulders, or biceps/back  Saturdays: Rest or OTF  Sundays: OTF or mountain biking.

Depending on your goals, your lifestyle, your current BMI, and your comfort level, routines can vary a lot. I've been working out for years, so my routine is similar to bolognahole's. There are a few basic things to consider: if you're trying to bulk up, you need clean food, lots of protein; and a ton of cardio is not necessary. If you're trying to slim down or lose some body fat, again, clean food, no sugar, only good, clean carbs (oatmeal, broccoli, etc) and plenty of cardio. I'm sure there are many people that will both agree and disagree with me, which is fine. This is just my routine, and it works for me. FWIW, I'm male, 5'7"", 150lbs, 21BMI."

Sitting around with people who constantly dog on the person you are trying to get over does not put them out of your mind.  If you don't feel like that route works, find a hobby and pour yourself into it. Make it a point to try to learn everything about it so that your mind is occupied.

Seriously, there's no more fundamental right in my book.  To balance that out, however, suicide should be well thought out, consulted with your doctor (if you have a terminal condition), and checks need to be in place to ensure the doctor isn't edging a person toward this choice for ulterior motives.  Anyone contemplating it should ABSOLUTELY seek help and not make this an off-the-cuff decision.  That being said--at the end of the day if you've gotten your mental evaluations or turned your life around financially or fixed whatever might have been externally and temporarily causing your depression, yet you still feel like ending it, that's your right and no one should be able to take it away.

AskReddit,3e2r6n,ickykarma,3,Tue Jul 21 15:37:10 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to stick my toe in the ""assisted suicide"" trolling stream, but I WILL provide you with the original logic that forms the basis of the laws against suicide, and in so doing, I'll explain why someone might have the right to live but not the right to choose to die.  Remember that one of the primary origins of law in the U.S. is English law.  For good and obvious reasons.  Now, let's take English law and set the WayBack machine for about 1200 CE.  One of the things that we would see is that feudal lords and fiefholders are engaged in almost constant mini-struggles against each other, which often involve shedding a little blood.  In addition to that, there is a slow-moving series of battles between individual kingdoms.  So, what I'm getting at is that fighting is not at all uncommon.  If you're anything other than a lord yourself, your life and your body literally belong to your lord.  If you happen to be a woman, your life and your body literally belong either to your father or your husband, and a bit on that in a second.  One of your obligations is to go to war when your lord orders you to.  And the law recognizes some sub-obligations.  One of them is not to injure your fellow subject in a way that would prevent him from effectively serving in combat (that crime was called mayhem, and literally meant inflicting the sort of injury on another that would render them combat ineffective).  And just as you cannot (intentionally) injure someone else in a way that removes them from the combat roster, you also cannot do that to yourself.  Your fealty to your lord obligates you to remain in his service until released, either by him or by natural death.  Because he might need you to go fight for him.  The rule for women is just an extension: because you belong to your husband (as any sort of an adult, you'd be married), you can no more off yourself than you could legally kill someone else's cow.  That comparison, by the way, is directly equivalent: women were the chattel property of their husbands, owned by them legally in exactly the same way the husbands owned a cow or a chair.  TL;DR: The origin of the prohibition on suicide is the legal reality (way back in the day) that your body belonged to someone else.  You had the right to continue to live (no one could legally flat out murder you), and indeed were OBLIGATED to continue to live in case your lord or husband needed you."
AskReddit,3e2r6n,bolognahole,2,Tue Jul 21 16:03:51 2015 UTC,"Depends on where you live.  In my opinion, go for it, it's your life, so long as you don't end your life with some C4 in a subway car.   In the opinion of people who want to control other people's lives, no you don't have that right."

It was something big, so everyone watched it but no one really cared. People the next day just said the usual, it's an inside job, fuck Americans and stuff.   I didn't care much too but what I remember, I felt really bad about the firefighters and the people who jumped out of the window.  Today I would probably feel different. I would always think, I could be in this situation too when I would have visit NYC. I was also really upset and down because of the cunt from Germanwings a few months ago, who made suicide. I live near Düsseldorf and I planned to fly to Barcelona as well, I could be in this plane."

AskReddit,3e4oo6,skoomaed,2,Tue Jul 21 22:54:14 2015 UTC,"Love is a temporary madness, it erupts like volcanoes and then subsides. And when it subsides, you have to make a decision. You have to work out whether your roots have so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part. Because this is what love is. Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion, it is not the desire to mate every second minute of the day, it is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every cranny of your body. No, don't blush, I am telling you some truths. That is just being ""in love"", which any fool can do. Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away, and this is both an art and a fortunate accident.  ― Louis de Bernières, Captain Corelli's Mandolin"

How baffling it was that even the most cunning and clever people would frequently see only what they wanted to see, and would rarely look beyond the thinnest of facades. Or they would ignore reality, dismissing it as the facade. And then, when their whole world fell to pieces and they were on their knees slitting their bellies or cutting their throats, or cast out into the freezing world, they would tear their topknots or rend their clothes and bewail their karma, blaming gods or kami or luck or their lords or husbands or vassals -- anything or anything -- but never themselves.”  ― James Clavell, Shōgun"

I need to make the most of it. Today is the first day of the rest of my life. I'm a walking cliché. I really need to go to the doctor and have my leg checked. There's something wrong. A bump. The dentist called again. I'm way overdue. If I stop putting things off, I would be happier. All I do is sit on my fat ass. If my ass wasn't fat I would be happier. I wouldn't have to wear these shirts with the tails out all the time. Like that's fooling anyone. Fat ass. I should start jogging again. Five miles a day. Really do it this time. Maybe rock climbing. I need to turn my life around. What do I need to do? I need to fall in love. I need to have a girlfriend. I need to read more, improve myself. What if I learned Russian or something? Or took up an instrument? I could speak Chinese. I'd be the screenwriter who speaks Chinese and plays the oboe. That would be cool. I should get my hair cut short. Stop trying to fool myself and everyone else into thinking I have a full head of hair. How pathetic is that? Just be real. Confident. Isn't that what women are attracted to? Men don't have to be attractive. But that's not true. Especially these days. Almost as much pressure on men as there is on women these days. Why should I be made to feel I have to apologize for my existence? Maybe it's my brain chemistry. Maybe that's what's wrong with me. Bad chemistry. All my problems and anxiety can be reduced to a chemical imbalance or some kind of misfiring synapses. I need to get help for that. But I'll still be ugly though.

AskReddit,3e3sci,temkofirewing,0,Tue Jul 21 19:33:29 2015 UTC,That makes sense; the guys who have asked me to do anal are also the types of guys who like to see women in pain from anal. I guess it's the fantasy of being in control. I'm not into that. But I could see it being enjoyable if the guy isn't a dick about it and the girl is enjoying it.
AskReddit,3e3sci,ReturnofTheClap,0,Tue Jul 21 19:35:21 2015 UTC,"yeah for sure, and you're right about the control aspect. porn can be very damaging for both men and women if you aren't careful. there's a fine line between fetish and issue"
AskReddit,3e3sci,temkofirewing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:50:40 2015 UTC,"lots of bullshit in replies from others about this. i personally love anal, and have done with with 3 different partners (wife / gf and fwb ). Takes a lot more effort from both parties than vaginal sex does and all 3 partners have required different ways to get ready and react differently to it.    See, an anus doesn't lube itself, and is used as an exit shute ON TOP of having an amazing muscle that makes sure stuff stays inside.  so if you want to try anal, you need to take 3 precautions.    1 - Condoms. i cant stress this enough, i mean it, ANAL = CONDOM. doesn't matter if it's your wife of 20 years.  2 - Cleaning (for the receiving end) Clean it inside. it's not hard, but look up how to do it properly.   3 - Lube. Use it on hte Anus, inside the anus, on the penis, add more wile doing it. just lube. love this stuff.  so long story short: anal can hurt, it might take hours to relax the anus enough to get a penis in. you might want to start with a small buttplug and see if that provides a good feeling.    some women love anal, but a great part of loving anal is being relaxed & lots of lube. But as a man, you need to take your time and slowly build up to it. Also accept that sometimes, it just doesn't work and plenty of women just dont like it. also, please for all things holy dont take porn as an example on how anal goes. Look up actual information."

My wife enjoys it on occasion but not a top of the list thing. Fwb finds it pretty fun. We do it 1 out of 3-4 times we gave sex.

The kind of makeup that makes people go ""you're look nice, you don't need to wear makeup!"" But not this guy. He had a lot of problems with women anyway, and one of those facets  was that he was like a creepy bloodhound for cosmetics, as in, he obsessively scrutinized all the women around him. Dude was hella weird.   Anyway,  I rarely wore makeup to work, except to cover up acne. One day, I had some extra time getting ready, so I put on some eyeshadow. Flat brown. I exaggerate not when I say that you could barely tell it was there.  Well, he tried to humiliate me about it in front of my entire office, all but flat out stating that I was vain, lazy, and  didn't care about the rules (that I wasn't breaking), all because I was wearing makeup. This is not an exaggeration of what he said.  With tense politeness, I managed to get out that he was incorrect, and I could show him on paper exactly how he was incorrect, right here, right now.

At first, I'll throw out random numbers.  23!  18!  5,7,9!  42!  Usually, this isn't where they break.  Most of the time, though, their face changes, just a little.  It's very subtle, but it's best described as the acceptance of my challenge, mixed with the knowledge that I won't affect their counting.  So I switch to letters.  M!  T!  G!  E!  E!  A!  H!  This usually goes the same way.  They're still going strong.  I make the jump from letters to whole words - fruits and colors are my usual go-to.  Purple, grape, yellow, red, apple, peach.  This seems to be a bit more successful - they're counting just fine, but then their brain betrays them for a split second, and broadcasts this thought to themselves: ""This guy is fuckin' weird.""  And sometimes, this is where their expression falters - and they get irritated and start over.  But not always.  A decent few people keep going.  So now, I count in order - but two or three numbers behind.  3734 3835 3936 4037  This is by far the most successful.  I may jump forward a couple numbers, or back a couple.  But at some point, they're not sure if they skipped one, or repeated one.  And they give me what I've been hoping for since the start - they roll their eyes, and let out a huge sigh.  This is my prize, and with it I know I've won.  And if they still aren't phased?  I ask them to remember the seven letters I said earlier, and ask them to rearrange them for me, if they can, in their head."

AskReddit,3e2k0b,Uggy,3,Tue Jul 21 14:26:01 2015 UTC,"I'd be curious about this as well - but here's my own supposition.  I would imagine it is similar to the way IT professionals diagnose computer/network/application problems. You google it. Now, googling doesn't get you the complete answer, but starts you down a path of investigation. Your experience and training are going to eliminate a ton of wrong suggestions and your formation is going to guide you while you research. It's not that google is diagnosing the problem, but it is perhaps narrowing a bit the scope of your investigation. Now that you have a few possible hits, you will run some tests, gather some more information, and repeat until you fix the problem or find a workaround.  The internet isn't making the diagnosis (that's where a doctor's education and experience come in), but I would imagine it's an invaluable resource."
AskReddit,3e2k0b,smoot99,2,Tue Jul 21 15:32:44 2015 UTC,"exactly - that's exactly right ... wikipedia if someone has a diagnosis you don't know much about but it's not something you really need to know about, uptodate if you need specific details about specifics of diagnosis or treatment of something you see less often or are experienced with less, or pubmed if it's less common or a specific question that seems research-worthy and you're willing to wade through a bunch of stuff"
AskReddit,3e2k0b,Uggy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:44:12 2015 UTC,"I also think there are some parallels in this thread to the idea that IT professionals who use google to solve problems aren't really doing anything. I think this question - internet to diagnose patients - has as an undercurrent of skepticism that doctors are unnecessary, because the information is out there.   The problem is also exacerbated by the attitude of people who say, ""Just fucking google it"" as if that's a solution. If my mom could solve her computer problems with google, i would be very surprised. There is a lot of value to crafting a precise query. I use it, but I am informed by many years of experience and education.   People can't use webmd/google/orwhatever to solve their health problems.

I grew up with dogs and treating/handling a cat the way you handle a dog didn't work out one time. I got scratched pretty badly. Hated them for several years after that and avoided them.  Then one day when I was in the older end of teen years, I was at someone's house and their cat sat down beside me and just stayed there. Eventually I started petting him and he snuggled up to me more.  That's when I started liking cats."

AskReddit,3e2lqo,Gally341,4,Tue Jul 21 15:00:09 2015 UTC,"I've answered this type of question before. So this will be a bit of a re-post as I can't remember the password on my old throwaway.  I was the class clown from elementary school and into junior high/middle school. I didn't have any other learning disabilities or issues, but my class clowning became such a distraction that I got put into special education classes mostly to keep me out of classes where I'd have a large audience of other students to entertain. They classified me as a a B.D. (Behavior Disorder) student and I was in classes of 5-6 kids for about half the day, and regular classes the other half.  In 7th grade myself and the other half a dozen or so students in my grade were assigned a new teacher who was in her mid 20s and this was her first full-fledged teaching gig. My grades and work were never a problem, but I was constantly quite literally taking over classes I was in by steering the lecture into other directions, making comments, jokes and otherwise comandeering the attention away from teachers. Some of the comments I would make, particularly when in the class with only a half dozen students were of a sexual nature towards the special education teacher.  Everyone would laugh and such, one day I had been sent to the assistant principles office from a non-special education class having made some silly comment, she got called into the office and I was given the usual after school detention from the assistant principle. Usually detention days were specifically scheduled (like Monday, Wednesday, Friday). But I had built up so much detention they asked the special education teacher who I spent half the day with if she would supervise detention specifically for me on a Tuesday and she agreed for that day. During that detention she dropped a plastic cup that had pens, paperclips and such on the floor and bent over to pick it up. As she was getting up I made a comment about her bending and dropping the cup again. To my surprise, she did just that so I could get a nice view. At that point the comments continued throughout the rest of the detention. From here there were a lot of steps that led up to actual sexual contact, during that detention incident it became clear that despite being engaged and in a relationship she was desperate for attention, even from someone half her age. And if given privacy and the right opportunity was willing to cater to a young boy's desires to boost her ego and feel wanted. I think quite frankly she was less than 8 years out of high school and probably had some repressed desire to want to be involved with the ""Bad Boy"", and despite the fact that I was 10ish years her junior and still a middle schooler, there was a draw there.  So what happened afterwards. Well, the more time I spent with her privately the more she was willing to do, it was a gradual process over a few months until I got her to partly disrobe. By that point I felt pretty confident, I got a finger in there and she just accepted it. I unzipped my pants, and just began intercourse right then and there as she remained in position, I did this without asking and she clearly enjoyed it as this occurred at least a dozen more times in eighth grade and at one point she even offered it (disguised as staying late for extra credit) as something of an incentive for bringing up my grade in another class."

I honestly can't tell the difference between most shampoos and conditioners, but I will never use pantene (sp?) because I've heard that it just coats your hair with wax too make it look more shiny. And I think that sounds dumb and unhealthy.   I don't use conditioner every day to make sure it doesn't get too oily and I use old spice brand pomade I think it is. I've bought really expensive hair product from my barber/hair stylist before and I can't tell the difference really.   Also, I spend a good amount of money on getting my hair cut. This will go a long way in making your hair look good, as a guy. I think for girls it can help to keep it healthier too if the hair stylist has a better idea of what they are doing. But I've had the same woman cut my hair for the last 15 years and I'm in my 20s. She is an absolute magician.

Ask if you have the right kind of hair to pull off the look you want. If you don't like how your hair was cut, find a new barber. And lastly, if ya get a bad haircut, don't worry about it.

AskReddit,3e2p6d,Fatgimli,2,Tue Jul 21 15:21:31 2015 UTC,"I shampoo my hair every 2 days, unless it's been a hard day. If you're going to condition it too, don't use a 2 in 1. Cold water is much better for your hair, scalp and whole body, if you're brave enough.   For styling, hairdryers are brilliant. If gives everything a lot more hold and means you need less product. If you're going to add product, start with a small amount and if you need more add extra after. A pot of product for me lasts about 2-3 years, with styling most days. A tip about applying hair products is to not look in the mirror. This will stop you just putting it all at front, which will make you look like you're in a 90's boy band. Once the products all in your hair, look in the mirror to perfect :)"

AskReddit,3e2p6d,Ponsh,2,Tue Jul 21 15:28:08 2015 UTC,"Besides the obvious question of what you want to do with it, you didn't really provide any useful information. Strong and medium is not a description. Do you mean your hair is thick? How exactly is it always ""messy""? Is it curly, wavy, or frizzy? What kind of hair style do you want? I'm gonna go ahead and guess it's kind of a mixture of wavy and frizzy, and you have pretty thick hair. You don't need fancy pants shower products, but shampoo and especially condition your hair if it's frizzy. Don't wash it more than once a day, this will cause it to dry out if it isn't already (frizziness). If you find daily condition after a shampoo isn't improving your hairs health/moisture, start washing it less. Take a break from any products you're using to style it.  Once your hair is healthy and the length you want it, get a decent haircut. Not a $9 barber one unless you have one of those exceptional barbers that actually know how to deal with hair that's longer than 2 inches.  To style it: I usually find after a wash (with shampoo) is easiest, but to each their own. Some like to have some oil build up (not right after a wash). If your hair is too curly or wavy, don't be afraid of lightly using a hair iron or blow dryer to straighten it. Experiment a bit and use common sense, you don't need to go to beauty school to figure out how to use these things. Invest in a good paste/pomade/gel depending on the look you want (how high of a hold and shine) and hairspray if you need extra hold. Hairspray you can get away with the cheapest stuff, they sell big tresseme at pharmacies for like $5-6.   Tip: if you get an iron, buy a small one. More important for it to be a thin one (length doesn't matter), not the big, wide plate ones that women use. Doesn't have to be high end at all"

This is simply because I think rich people complain about the stupidest things, this means that they are attentive to the stupidest things. Poor people might not know how to properly tie a bow tie, or something little, and all of a sudden he stands out for not knowing what others know. Rich people pick up on little things and make big things out of them. I don't think poor people do that as much. When you're poor, you do your best to maintain healthy relationships with your friends.

Having to live in a hot house in the summer and cold house in the winter are things that poor people are accustomed to, but for a rich person it would be a non stop reminder of 'sacrifice'. This is something rich people don't even fundamentally understand on a basic level. Being poor is sacrificing every day. Every decision has very real implications. Food? do I have enough gas to make it for a week? What bills are going to get paid... Rich people would lose their mind if they realized the reality. Having been through that, I now have resources but live not terribly different than before. I still don't have cable, I don't really splurge on much. I am not terrified of bills and having checks bounce anymore. I have a well stocked bar and I always have beers in the fridge. I have a nice bike collection, but otherwise I am still driving a 12 year old car- though I did buy a '68 F100 for $800 because I always wanted an old truck.  Money acts like a magnifying glass. If you have serious personal problems when you are poor, money will just bring that out more. I don't think it really changes a person."
AskReddit,3e3way,Shvingy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:17:19 2015 UTC,"The type of rich persons we're talking about would have a big impact. Business Owner/Self-Employed rich have developed a very different skill set than university degree/white-collar rich. Drop the former group into a poor situation and over 10-years you can bet they've vastly improved their situation. The latter I'm not so sure of; the entitlement and bitching might keep them victimized for the entire time.  I don't remember who solidified the concept in my mind, but at least in Canada, two adults in whatever situation possible (bankrupt, no education) can turn things around in a huge way if they have the mental fortitude to do what it takes. I'm barely inside the lower middle class for my age, but the only thing stopping myself, wife and two kids from being 'rich' is lifestyle choices, family/work balance, some laziness (don't do a course on codeacademy, watch big brother), the entitlement that deserve to eat out again this week, or we deserve the trip to Mexico again this year.  I understand there are places in the world that this is not the case but I think in Canada, with some exceptions, where you are at is determined by your mind and either what you do or do not think is possible or able to be sacrificed."

AskReddit,3e43gx,Ted_Denslow,2,Tue Jul 21 20:55:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think you truly understand how the Misfits works if that's your answer. It works slightly like this:   70s Misfits:    Pretty great stuff considering the musical landscape those songs were written in. Even for punk there was still something ambitious happening.   80s Misfits:   Those ambitious things that we were seeing hints of were a bit fleshed out. It turns out that those ambitions were speed and gore. Either way it's some damn good punk rock. A punk collection is all but worthless if a copy of Walk Among Us isn't resting comfortably in its depths.   Anything after the 80s:   Garbage. All. Garbage.  Now you will have nay-sayers and ""true believers"" that claim that there is salvageable material here. Even I think a few of the tunes are catchy AF. But this does not constitute even a glimmer of past genius to be considered canon with the original lineup. Anything that came out in this era is to be either ignored whole-heartedly or to be listened to with cautious indifference as a parody of its former self."

So i narrowed down the time he would grab his mickey d's with no success, it was all random. So one day, i went down the road and there was nothing there but crossed a dude eating out of a shitty bag so i turned around and there it was. I picked it up and brought it back to his home and rang. No one opened, but it was obvious that he was home. I wrote on the bag that it's quite shitty what ge does and left it on the doorstep.

Books are old tech, people have had them and been comfortable with the written word for centuries. Then along comes movies, television, video games...all things that are new to parents and old timers, if you will. Being unfamiliar and set in their ways, they see this new tech as a threat or similar. Then once the rating system is in place, it remains because people become used to it. But we never had one for books, so probably never will. (Not that we need one.)"

AskReddit,3e495b,OobaDooj,2,Tue Jul 21 21:14:16 2015 UTC,"This question is a hard one to answer because of everyone's different methods of measuring intelligence. Personally, I do very well at school because I'm an auditory learner and don't take very much notes, then to study I just re read my notes once and I'm good for the test. Also, at a young age I learned to problem solve efficiently, and use deductive reasoning to do well on exams. So I don't think of myself as smart, just that I've accumulated a set of skills that make me successful at school, but it surprises me that most students have to put in more effort to get good grades."
AskReddit,3e495b,Eats_All_Meats,2,Tue Jul 21 21:40:47 2015 UTC,"I hope this gets buried because I kind of feel insecure about expressing my thoughts about myself, and it's really hard to explain what I mean. Based off of my view on intelligence, it didn't start at a particular age, but throughout the years I've noticed particularly more activity in my thoughts than anyone I've ever met.   When I see other people stare off into space, or whenever I ask someone what they are thinking about, most of them will respond with ""nothing"". I've always been thinking. I've never lost touch with reality or became unaware of what's going on around me.   When I realized that I knew exactly where my thoughts were coming from and why my brain was making the connections it was making.   When I stopped being surprised about things, and instantly would understand why something might be the way it is.   I don't think a lot of people would think of me as smart right off the bat, but my mind works so hard that I go into panic sometimes thinking about my own existence. I can sense all of the information that my brain has received when I perform a task, and I notice a difference in something every time I do it.   I know I can understand everything any other human being can or will ever experience, and the way I perceive the world is more like a drugless high at times I need it to be. I can make myself experience a psychedelic ""trip"" when I think about the universe, I can experience oneness with all by just wondering about it.   The thought of alternate dimensions and infinity is always in the back of my mind. I constantly take every single bit of knowledge in my head, and morph it into different forms, effortlessly applying it to all the new things that I learn. When I realized my mind will balance itself, I felt really euphoric. It's still a long way to go, but I just thought I would share my definition of smart. I think I am very smart and have a lot of capability- more than most people I know."

But wait theres more! You can drag out grad school and continue to push adulthood off until you're 30 and havent even attempted a career.
AskReddit,3e4gqt,lilchubber,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:09:32 2015 UTC,"In a nutshell...  Pros: Depending on where you go, the money is good. The job is what you bring to it, so if you're a lazy jackass then it'll be easy, and if you work hard, you have an opportunity to make a difference in somebody's life. Traveling is made possible by said money, if you're into that. Skills applicable to many jobs down the line, but again, only if you treat it like an actual job. Broaden your horizons, and develop an appreciation for where you come from (or the opposite), and therefore find out more about who you are. Depending on the country, your marriage market value may automatically go up because ""exotic"".  Cons: Money terrible depending where you go. Whether or not you'll get a good school is a complete roulette. Job market (depending on the country) is much tighter in recent years, so many good teachers are having to accept shittier jobs to continue to do what they love. Shitty ""teachers"" ruining it for the good ones. ...everpresent occasionally not subtle racism. ""Blood money."""

That's really just the extremely well-understood Observer Effect and has nothing explicitly to do with quantum mechanics. The Uncertainty Principle is far more bizarre, as properties such as position and momentum are represented with types of waveforms that preclude measurement with the same degree of precision.   Bizarre, as you have to imagine (for instance) position as being a wavelength, where momentum might be frequency. You can measure one or the other precisely, but not both at the same time."

I don't see a congress in this nation being willing to work with a self-proclaimed socialist whose campaign is largely based on destroying the very things they financially benefit from.  I think a Sanders presidency will also inspire more political entrenchment and obstructionist politics from Tea-Party affiliated groups and lawmakers.  While Clinton may not be the most ideal choice, I see her as being far less polarizing than Sanders.  Ideally she'd be able to bridge the gap between ideologies (wishful thinking that any president will accomplish this next term) but at least she won't drive people further into their corners like I believe Sanders will."
AskReddit,3e4gci,damien6,2,Tue Jul 21 22:48:17 2015 UTC,"One of the reasons would include his stance on the minimum wage. I know reddit is crazy about the whole national 15/hour wage, but it far exceeds what this nation needs. Yes, anything below $8 is simply unjust, but if I were being realistic, keeping small business in mind, an $15/hour national wage is simply unrealistic to small-medium sized businesses. Furthermore, socialism, in the way that Bernie Sanders views it is dangerous in the sense that it really never works in a capitalistic society. Greece and France are prime examples of that."
