londonontario,3e3hma,spcars,5,Tue Jul 21 17:51:19 2015 UTC,"Old south / wortley is a great place to live. For affordable housing, there are some places for rent in Old North, Cherryhill, Fanshawe and around Masonville. Expect students. Move closer to downtown, otherwise you will never be able to use buses efficiently. They're sort of everywhere. There's Springbank Park near Byron, some trails in the Northridge area, Harris Park, all sorts. Walking around Fanshawe or Western can be calming if you do it at the right time, and stressful otherwise. It never hurts to window shop on Richmond. Despite being a bit more conservative (and honestly a bit behind the times sometimes), London has a decent bit of culture. The Poacher's Arms downtown has a trivia night one night during the week, and there are all sorts of board game nights and such around the city. There's even a board game cafe right by Dundas and Talbot. Board game nights! Find a thing you like, and do it. There's all sorts of beer league sports, gaming clubs and stuff like that. If you're on the geekier side (Welcome, friends!) then L.A. Mood downtown has D&D and MTG nights."

londonontario,3e3hma,inimrepus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:29:25 2015 UTC,"I would highly recommend the Old South/Wortley area! The buses in the area are better than a lot of areas, you are close to a hospital if you have an emergency, good schools and there are festivals in the area. On top of this you are close to the downtown still. There are other areas of the city that are good as well, but this is my favourite area. There are a fairly decent number of bike/walking paths in the city. You can actually go all the way from Old South to Western University (north end of the city) without going on a road except for one bridge. There are also trails around Western, Fanshawe Park and the Pond Mills area that are really good. Some of the other comments have given some good answers but I would add that you should check out Meetup. They have a good list of events going on in London that not many people know about. Also, Morrissey House (a really good restaurant/bar) has a trivia night once a week. I would recommend going to some of the Meetups in town. There are a lot of people that attend some of them (if you are a web developer then I would recommend the PHP Meetup). Also attending events in the city. There are a couple car shows each year (one is tonight in Wortley Village), go to some of the quieter bars like Morrissey House and Milos. This is a tricky one to answer though since it really depends what you are into.   I hope this helps and I hope you enjoy London! Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions or if you are looking for tips on places to go."

londonontario,3e3hma,xvodax,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:01:05 2015 UTC,"Wortly/Old South has won national awards in planning for its community. so of course its really the only place to look at. (i grew up there, so i'm partial to it) If your looking for maybe an up-and-coming area. my suggestions would be Old East Village, you may have to an open outlook to it, as it can be seen as shady. But if your open to Fix-Er-Ups and maybe getting a better value for your home in an area that is going to be worth a lot more in the near future. i would check there. The western fair has big plans and the community initiative wants to create a cultural - arts district for Old East Village, it continues to improve its image and make it more a ""place"" rather then just a section of city that carries a poor stigma.    My second suggestion would be South Street area, North to Horton. and then South from River to Baseline road(wonderful area close to everything) The South Street to Horton Area, can also been seen as shady, but buy a house in there you'll begin to see value as the area gets an infusion of money from the south street hospital development. There are some big plans, hopefully its not just smoke.   In terms of area, Commissioners to the South, Highbury to the east, Oxford to the North (unless your money enough to afford Old North?) and Wharncliffe to the West is your area of interest, as it is for most, young, intelligent professionals. anything outside of this, i would have a tough time considering living out side this area. simply because it becomes car friendly and needed and you become out of touch with the greater culture and events London can offer.    All the locations i've suggested are located close to bike and walking paths. the River is your corridor of biking and trails. And even transit to work? What other people said. I'm so out of touch now.. (i went into JBRs on Saturday for the first time in years..apparently its now called Toboggaon? and is a classy place.) Sports Teams. (dodgeball leagues, ultimate frisbee, Disc Golf)    good luck"

londonontario,3e3hma,enkidusfriend,-1,Tue Jul 21 20:42:29 2015 UTC,"What is your definition of nice? Most activities happen downtown, so you will want to be within distance of the core. There are a number of what I would consider ""nice"" areas all around there, including a few in what would be considered bad parts of town. Hamilton/Adelaide area is typically good to avoid, but there are great areas bordering that region (e.g. parts of Trafalgar, the end of Woodfield, etc.). The Thames Valley Parkway is the major trail system in town. It is paved and good for biking and as an active transportation corridor to some areas. A number of non-paved paths branch off the system, so there's lots to explore. The Thames Talbot Land Trust manages a number of properties that have great walking trails. Check out the ""Our Properties"" tab on their website. I don't know. Not my scene. Volunteering is always good. We have a number of agencies that run social sporting leagues and events. The Central Library offers some decent programming geared towards adults (academic talks, author visits, etc.). There are plenty of clubs and organizations focused on specific activities and interests. There is also the London Redittors Facebook group that sometimes coordinates meetings and activities.

londonontario,3dzj9n,LouisBalfour82,2,Tue Jul 21 15:49:54 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is that CP owns the bridge and the city really has no say in renovating it or replacing it.  Where as the city has skin in the traffic flow in and around downtown,   CP really only needs to worry about its operations.  They run the trains as they see fit,  they maintain their infrastructure as they see fit.  They don't really need to worry about the congestion caused when they Park a train across downtown and block evey north - south street between Talbot and Quebec St.  They don't really need to worry about the bottleneck caused  by the narrow underpass where wharncliff turns into western Rd.  They did need to worry about trucks hitting the bridge at Talbot,  but only to the extent that it may damage the bridge and tracks though... So they installed the I-beams on either side of the bridge to take the brunt so that trucks hit them first and spare the bridge itself.  So far that solution seems to be working pretty good for CP.  For the rest of us? Not their problem."

While London is a fair-sized city, being so close to Toronto means that it just lacks a diversity of opportunities. It'd be shitty to move here, only to find out that the positions you're qualified for aren't open here. Look into that first.  As for the city itself, it's a great place to live. Locals who've lived here all of their lives tend to be a little bit too hard on London. Cost of living is low, the public transit is pretty decent on the major routes, and kind of shitty for the smaller routes (just like everywhere else) and overall has stuff going on."

Not having a car while living in a suburban subdivision sucks no matter what city you live in. Subdivisions are not designed to be public transit friendly. Most cities in North America aren't designed to be public transit friendly. It's not a London-specific problem, so I'm more inclined to think it's people who haven't lived in other places who act like it is."

londonontario,3dwjc9,ArrestedDevelopments,5,Mon Jul 20 16:54:48 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  I suggest lining up a job prior to moving.  It's rough everywhere, and London is no different.  2 part time jobs may be what you'll have to roll with for a while.  Housing, you should aim for about 700-1000 for an average place.  Rent varies based on the usual stuff, check out ViewIt for some ideas.  All in all, public transit is mostly reliable.  It really has been missing marks on the areas around UWO and Fanshawe, during school times.  Over crowding is taking it's toll there, but there are improvements being made.  You can bike to wherever you want in the city via paths, just please, avoid major roads when biking.  There is a huge us vs them mentality here with cars.  Health care, we have South Western Ontario's largest hospital with Victoria.  We also have University Hospital, which is a teaching hospital.  Both do fantastic work, and are pretty world famous for stuff they focus on.  Finding a doctor may be tricky, but I found one within a day of looking 2-3 years ago, so I assume it's the same.

I think there are a lot of great things about London that make me love it and there are also a lot of shitty things, like the bike theft situation which is actually ridiculous. I don't think you could ever hate this city, what it comes down to is what you make of it and how you spend your time here.

Stabbings are a recent thing that people in this sub seem to have focus on as being ""It's a London thing"" ER times have been pretty good.  Been myself a few times over the last few years, never a wait of more than 90 min to 2 hours. Transit isn't great, but it isn't horrible.  The routes haven't really changed to move with the population, they've just added routes so it's kinda missed the mark there, but it isn't horrible. EAO - Guessing you don't live in EOA?

I have been to the ER about 6 times in the past few years for myself but mostly others and on average have spent at least 6 hours waiting for a doctor by a bed. In terms of transit, you'll never change my opinion on how much it sucks. The amount of times I've spent waiting for a bus while in school in -10 degree weather for hours because of the bus being too full or the bus driver just not paying attention has made me a little biased, and also running for a bus because it's 15 minutes early only to see the bus driver shake their head at me and drive away has made me a little resentful. I've also noticed there's a few ""future transit stop"" signs in my area that have been there, no exaggeration, for 10+ years.

londonontario,3dwjc9,JaquesNoir,2,Mon Jul 20 17:48:22 2015 UTC,only 6 hours for a broken bone? that sounds like fucking torture. you'd be better off going to St. Thomas.
londonontario,3dwjc9,howdareyou,0,Mon Jul 20 20:11:52 2015 UTC,There are those coming in with severe trauma.... Your bones aren't getting any brokener...
londonontario,3dwjc9,JaquesNoir,0,Mon Jul 20 22:16:48 2015 UTC,yeah i get it. but 6 hours is a long time to wait around with a broken leg.
londonontario,3dwjc9,jackofnotrades1352,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:21:43 2015 UTC,Even longer when someone is having a seizure or a stroke.
londonontario,3dwjc9,kitkatmrow,3,Mon Jul 20 22:41:12 2015 UTC,"Hospitals operate as hospitals should.  I've been to the ER a handful of times, and I've always been admitted right away.  If it's not a life-or-death emergency, you have to wait.  If it's urgent but you aren't dying, that's what St. Josephs is for.  If it's just a common issue, that's why we have so many clinics.  Use the appropriate facility and you'll find things go much smoother.  The ""stabbings"" are just your typical domestic disputes you get everywhere.  I'm from one of the safest US cities and we have homicide rates several times higher than this.  London only has about 5 homicides a year (~1 per 100K people).  You really don't get any lower than this in the english-speaking cities of the world.  University kids act like typical kids, but the police are very proactive now in controlling the parties that got out of control in the past.  Again, in the US, we had real student-disruptions every week after any major sporting event."
londonontario,3dwjc9,jackofnotrades1352,-4,Mon Jul 20 08:25:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why people are getting butthurt about my hospital comment, I'm just basing it off of what I've experienced so I can't really speak in behalf of anyone else. If you haven't had to wait a stupid amount of time that's great, but I have so sucks to suck. I also don't think stabbings are exclusive to London, I'm simply giving a rough location as to where you might be more likely to get stabbed. In terms of students, I'm not really sure what you're getting at, I only recommended not living around Fanshawe because that area is pretty notorious for being rowdy because well...it is.  http://www.lfpress.com/2014/01/13/st-thomas-vs-london-er-waits-a-world-apart  http://www.lfpress.com/2014/07/01/university-hospital-ranks-worst-for-wait-times"
londonontario,3dwjc9,kitkatmrow,3,Mon Jul 20 08:42:21 2015 UTC,"I'm just trying to help you out.  If you are waiting 6 hours, you are probably not in the right place for your issue.  ERs give priority to life-threatening emergencies.  St Josephs is for urgent care.  If you don't need an immediate ultrasound or anything, use a clinic.  That's probably why you're waiting so long with ERs, but not in clinics.  London is a sizeable city, so facilities are segmented like that - a small town like St Thomas is going to have far fewer people, so everyone can just use the ER without much wait.   I'm simply giving a rough location as to where you might be more likely to get stabbed.   The crime rate is so low for London, homicides are due to domestic disputes - not geography.  You are far more likely to be injured in an argument with family and friends.  You can't change your rate of victimization when it's that low by moving... it has much more to do with who you associate with.  The point about Fanshawe is that it's pretty typical of a college region, albeit much better now.  If OP wants to go to school as he says, he's likely going to deal with the same party issues at any school.  Yes, Fanshawe is rowdier than the retirement homes in the north end, but OP isn't going to be concerned with this."
londonontario,3dwjc9,OrangeNova,-3,Mon Jul 20 10:12:50 2015 UTC,"That's fair, the times that I've been to the ER for myself or with others was outside of urgent care times and they were serious enough to go to the ER. It's not like I went to the ER at noon because of a cough. And yes, I get that, I'm in no way arguing London's homicide rate that was never the point, but I am definitely suggesting that there are areas in which you are more likely to get stabbed (not necessarily murdered). Rates of crime and violence usually correlate with lower income areas. And ya of course they would deal with the same ""party issues"" at any school, again...all I was saying is that it is not a very favorable area to live for most people because as far as I read OP didn't say anything about wanting to go to school but wants to move once they are done school where they currently live. Maybe I'm wrong for assuming, but I put two and two together and figured they might not want to live in that area because of the reputation. I know if I was moving to a city and found cheap places to live I'd want someone to say ""hey fyi, that area is cheap because it's pretty much all students living there"", so I could search elsewhere."
londonontario,3dwjc9,kitkatmrow,3,Mon Jul 20 10:39:28 2015 UTC,"Most of the Stabbings this year are West of Adelaide, Try harder."
londonontario,3dwjc9,OrangeNova,-5,Mon Jul 20 12:08:20 2015 UTC,"And you capitalized your T after a comma, omg the horror of a useless specific detail! Everyone from London knows EOA isn't the best area, so I'm just going to go ahead and assume people getting butthurt about my EOA comment are people living in EOA. Sorry I don't like your area of the city, get over it."
londonontario,3dwjc9,kitkatmrow,3,Mon Jul 20 12:32:08 2015 UTC,"I've lived in a fair amount of areas in the city, there's more sketchy areas west of adelaide, or south of adelaide then east of adelaide.  Get over your shitty prejudices."
londonontario,3dwjc9,Blackmesa40,-3,Mon Jul 20 12:33:36 2015 UTC,Nah.
londonontario,3dwjc9,ttjr89,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:36:14 2015 UTC,Insane amount of gyms is what i was hoping to hear when i get my certification like any city its hard to find work but anywhere is better then where i currently live unemployment rate for people 17-35- was 17% last i checked and i will have few months of living expenses in case i cant line something up right away
londonontario,3dwjc9,kitkatmrow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:11:04 2015 UTC,Dude traffic is only bad from 7-9am and 4-530pm. I can get from Westmount or Byron to my work around Dundas and Highbury in 15 minutes or less. I can't think of any other similarly sized city where you'd be able to accomplish that.
londonontario,3dwjc9,sick__and__tired,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:12:18 2015 UTC,I'd say 3 to 5 30 because alot of factory workers and stuff get done at 3 in east end anyway...
londonontario,3drqs9,dog_ate_my_username,8,Sat Jul 18 20:42:38 2015 UTC,I was there had to hold a baracade up for half the rise against show
londonontario,3drqs9,mateo_rules,2,Sun Jul 19 04:38:43 2015 UTC,"That was fucked, i was in the section right in front of it. I was afraid it was going to crash down and I'd be trampled by drunk dudebros."
londonontario,3drqs9,Brutalitor,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:30:47 2015 UTC,The luxury siuts ?
londonontario,3drqs9,mateo_rules,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:22:22 2015 UTC,No I was in GA but I think it was the luxury suites behind us? They broke the barricade in half and people were jumping over to get into the front area where i was.
londonontario,3drqs9,Brutalitor,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:33:13 2015 UTC,I was the white guy in shorts holding up the fence no shirt on
londonontario,3drqs9,mateo_rules,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:45:28 2015 UTC,Were you the dude sitting in between the barricades with the security?
londonontario,3drqs9,Brutalitor,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:50:31 2015 UTC,No I never went in the space between I was keeping the people from it crashing down
londonontario,3drqs9,mateo_rules,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:04:04 2015 UTC,"I saw you! My GF said they should refund your ticket or something for having to do that.  You might not have seen, but the mosh pit about 8 feet from the barricade was pretty rowdy. Couple of bleeders. Rise Against put on a good damn show though."
londonontario,3drqs9,JimmaDaRustla,2,Mon Jul 20 02:49:38 2015 UTC,I got a free bottle of water from a security guard and he let me have a smoke lol so that's good enough for me lol
londonontario,3drqs9,mateo_rules,2,Mon Jul 20 05:04:55 2015 UTC,Here as well....working though.

Not sure if anyone was forwardish for the Billy Talent show, but I'm the guy that bought the 10 bottles of water to pass around by the barricade."
londonontario,3drqs9,Zerioc,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:31:26 2015 UTC,Where you in the beer garden on the broken side of the baracade when u did this ?
londonontario,3drqs9,mateo_rules,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:29:36 2015 UTC,"Middle pit area, right hand side, about 1/4-1/2 way back. Don't know if there was the broken baracade close, but I know it was broken somwhere along that side."
londonontario,3drqs9,Zerioc,0,Mon Jul 20 18:44:14 2015 UTC,I'm here in luxury suite #1!
