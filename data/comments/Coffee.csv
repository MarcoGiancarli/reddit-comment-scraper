Coffee,3e39zf,anonymau5,2,Tue Jul 21 19:18:22 2015 UTC,"Hi all!  My work has this espresso machine in the break room which I've been learning how to use. I want to find some documentation to see if I can adjust the pressure or perform some other maintenance on it, but I can't find the model name/number on the machine! Anyone have an idea? Thanks."
Coffee,3e39zf,dave_two_point_oh,2,Tue Jul 21 17:02:00 2015 UTC,Best way to improve shot quality would be to replace that toy tamper with a real one.
Coffee,3e39zf,uselessjd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:09:26 2015 UTC,"Looks like a single group ek-series,  but I didn't see any non-automatic examples with a quick Google. I would ask over at s1cafe.com to see if they know."
Coffee,3e39zf,duseless,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:17:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, semi-auto version of the New EK, called the Special EP. Looks like they are out of production, but these guys will likely have documentation. EDIT: Looks like Burgess has a brochure. EDIT2: Here is the complete parts catalog. You'll notice on Tav. (Tav. = ""Tavola"", or ""Page"" in english) 07/a four pump configurations. The top two (rotary pumps) are adjustable, the bottom two (vibratory pumps) not so much. Peek inside to see which configuration you have. Dispense water as if you were pulling a shot and turn the screw on the side of the rotary pump clockwise to increase or counter-clockwise to decrease the dispensing pressure. The water MUST be dispensing to make an adjustment.  Tav. 21, part position 1101/2623 (above the motor, bottom right) shows the boiler pressure switch, or pressurestat. Dispense steam and adjust the same as the pump: clockwise to increase the boiler pressure or counter-clockwise to decrease the boiler pressure. Make your adjustment, close the steam valve and wait, watching the needle climb. Note that this increases or decreases the steam pressure, directly affecting the temperature of the water in the boiler at the same time. These are about the only two features that need adjustment, or that the average user need be concerned with."

Coffee,3e48do,anweaver2007,6,Tue Jul 21 20:54:13 2015 UTC,"I started with a French press myself. And in my opinion, the best starting point is to get a grinder. Doesn't matter what kind honestly. If you're just starting out, something as basic as an electric blade grinder will be fine. Or even a manual burr grinder. The main point is that you should grind your own coffee, right before you brew. It will jumpstart your coffee game. You can worry about upgrading and more detailed stuff later honestly. Good luck!"
Coffee,3e48do,sheldyshoe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:19:55 2015 UTC,I have a grinder already. I just don't know anything about the coffee bean....
Coffee,3e48do,KoreanDominican,4,Tue Jul 21 21:23:58 2015 UTC,"I recommend finding a local roaster or coffee shop and stop in to talk to them. They can set you up, give you some tips, and give you beans that will make folgers taste like bath water."
Coffee,3e48do,Jurph,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:56:13 2015 UTC,"Pick up some good whole-bean coffee, ideally something roasted freshly and locally.  If you're new to coffee I'd look for a light roast from the South Pacific (maybe a Sumatra?) in order to really take advantage of some of the flavors you won't ordinarily taste otherwise.    Get your water-to-coffee ratio right first, and then get your grind size consistent.  Once you've got those two factors locked in, work on your brew time -- recognizing that you want to decant the French Press into another container as soon as the brew time is reached (so the excess doesn't get over-extracted and bitter).    When you've walked through all the variables and you know you have your process down, you can splurge on a little bit of Kona or Blue Mountain to taste the 'fine wines' of coffee.  Then start hunting for other regions and roasts that you like."

I still use it in the office everyday, but have since moved to an aeropress and hario v 60. I must say, after french pressing so long, I really love the clean taste I get from an aeropress or hario. I also recently purchased a ""130 dollar grinder"" but I would definently recommend going with a french press first, and trying out different roasts. Starbucks sumatra is pretty good, and there dark one that starts with a V is pretty good. I'm trying out new light roasts now to experiment. enjoy!"

Costa is a great place to start for people just getting into specialty coffee."
Coffee,3e48do,ilivefaster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:34:45 2015 UTC,"I need a starting place.    For me, I was in the same boat. I'd been drinking Dunkin' Donuts swill for a while, but I'd noticed a huge improvement just buying (yeah whatever I'll say it) Starbucks beans, grinding them myself with an electric blade grinder, and using a french press at home.   To take the next step in coffee love, it was about finding a coffee place nearby that served delicious coffee. In Boston, it was pretty easy with places like The Thinking Cup and Render around to show me the delicious flavor a cup of coffee could have. After a while, you end up feeling like spending $4-$5 on a cup of coffee is silly, and you drop a bunch of money on a good grinder and gooseneck kettle etc etc etc"
Coffee,3e48do,elpfen,0,Tue Jul 21 23:15:52 2015 UTC,Obtain a French press. Find a local coffee roaster and ask them for a medium-dark roast of their recommendation and have them grind it for French press.

From Home-barista.com:      The WDT in Brief Equipment:      Empty yogurt container, with bottom cut out to make a funnel that wedges securely into the top of your filter basket. A pointy implement; I use an inexpensive dissecting needle (yes, it has only been used for this purpose!).      Steps:      Wedge the yogurt funnel into filter basket. Grind and dose directly into yogurt funnel/filter basket, until you have a mound of coffee grounds that heaps slightly over the rim of the filter basket. Stir grounds vigorously with needle. Remove yogurt funnel and level grounds to the top of the filter basket. Tamp. Pull shot. https://www.home-barista.com/weiss-distribution-technique.html This works really well for me in getting a uniform shot with no spray or channeling."

Dripp, in Chino Hills, CA (http://www.dripp.com) serve incredible turkish coffee based drinks, aside from the latte, they also have a ""turkish"" version of an affogatto (ice cream + turkish coffee on top)  I don't recommend replacing water with milk though, it's pretty disgusting, coffee is not as soluble in milk, as it is in water, also the consistency of milk makes it impossible for the grounds to settle at the bottom, leaving you with a muddy light brownish undrinkable mess."

Coffee,3e3c8g,quinndonnelly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:14:55 2015 UTC,Most people here seem to be pretty pleased with their Encores for any methods that aren't espresso or Turkish. What grinder do you currently have?  It might be fairly loud though. Not much more than any other electric grinder though. Manual grinders like Lido 2 or 3 might be worth looking into if noise is an issue. ROK is coming out soon with a manual grinder that they just recently announced will be stepless.
Coffee,3e3c8g,jja619,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:37:40 2015 UTC,"I'm actually pretty pleased by my Encore, even for espresso (Lelit PL41EM). I found it quite loud, mostly in the morning just after waking up. But if you don't have your grinder in your bedroom/livingroom, it's really ok."

Its a great grinder, especially for the price. I have had a Maestro+ for over 4 years (was a slightly nicer version back at that point, but I the newer encores are a slight upgrade from what I have). My dad picked up a refurbished encore over a year ago and loves it."

Just make sure you make a divot before you pour, and that you keep your pouring mostly in the middle, and it shouldn't clog."
Coffee,3e3c8g,very1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:26:26 2015 UTC,You will not have to wear ear plugs to operate it.
Coffee,3e3c8g,Steepslider,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:10:44 2015 UTC,"It's quite loud, but all grinders are. I measured it as over 85 dB from the distance I stand away from it, which is a few feet. What most grinders differ in is the type of sound it makes, or the frequencies that it hits. The Encore is not a particularly fast grinder, so the noise is a lower-frequency motor type of noise, combined with the sound of beans being torn apart. Compare this to something like a high end grinder (espresso or shop-level brew grinder) that would run at a higher RPM for less time, and you'll find the latter type would be a higher frequency almost squealing type of noise. This could mean that some perceive the Encore as louder, because its frequencies are in the mid-range and easily block conversations and such since it's at the same frequencies. I hope that helps clarify...  As far as pour overs, it depends on what you want. Generally, most off-the-shelf electric brew grinders under $1k will perform slightly better as the price goes up, but will still produce a significant number of fines, imparting a bitter flavor on the brew and negatively affecting flavor clarity. If you're seeking shop-level quality, you'd have to either spend quite a bit, or purchase a used shop-quality grinder (Bunn G series or Bunnzilla comes to mind) and deal with its subjective ugliness and its size. You also have the option of going with a high quality hand grinder, something like the Lido 2 or Lido 3, but both of which hit at a higher price point than the Encore. However, any grinder at the Encore level or above will be significantly better than any other ""faux burr"" grinder or blade grinder in the fines department, and also better than cheap hand grinders, so if you're just looking for an improvement from that, then it's perfect for you. Personally, I'm satisfied with the Encore on a day to day basis, but in the future when I have more counter space and feel like making the investment, I'm going to upgrade to something really good. For what it's worth, I haven't experienced any fully clogged brews with the Encore, but there's definitely a noticeable slowdown on the final draw-through if the pour is sloppy."

I use a Bonavita variable kettle for the water. It's the most cost effective solution for me, but I am very much considering picking up a 3-cup Chemex as I really miss drinking out of it everyday."
Coffee,3e2efn,Tarpit_Carnivore,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:59:35 2015 UTC,For at your desk I think an aeropress would be less mess and take up less space than a chemex. The aeropress and chemex yield very similar results cup wise. Coffee from a moka pot doesn't taste anything like the others. Very thick and bitter.
Coffee,3e2efn,wolffire99,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:10:46 2015 UTC,"True, but it makes a more espresso-like coffee, which I happen to like as well. In terms of setup and ease of use, which do you think is better?"
Coffee,3e2efn,wolffire99,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:25:14 2015 UTC,The aeropress being self cleaning is the kicker for me. Saves you a trip to rinse out the chemex after every brew.

Coffee,3e2efn,jja619,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:42:53 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't heat any coffee after it's brewed ever. Stove or hotplate. If it's for the Moka, it likely won't even get hot enough to work.  As for the Bonavita, the part of the stopper that touches the coffee is silicone not plastic. Like the Clever, a gooseneck is not required."
Coffee,3e2efn,PriceZombie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:53:28 2015 UTC,Interesting! Maybe I'll go the Bonavita route then. So I'd just need a source of hot water (could I just boil on the hot plate?) and the filters and grinder.

The cleanup of the aeropress is hard to beat, though a v60 comes a close second. Both are way more convenient than French press which I normally only reach for on a lazy Sunday.   Sometimes I pump milk in my French press combined with the aeropress for a latte style coffee. Works surprisingly well. Takes about 30seconds of pumping.

So you have the immersion like body, but cleaner with no silt and a much easier clean up. I think it is incredibly forgiving, consistent, and makes an incredible cup. I would get that over the Aeropress (which I also like, but more for travel). If you are looking to try something wildly different from what you are used to with the french press and can spend some dough, a Chemex will show you a different side of coffee highlighting the light and fruity, but that might be for another day.."

Coffee,3dxwjc,gassy_broccoli_fart,9,Mon Jul 20 21:50:50 2015 UTC,"Aeropress is spectacular and one of the best bang for buck coffee gadgets out there, but it's not a French Press replacement.  They produce pretty different cups.  Generally, the AP makes a stronger, cleaner cup while the FP is is less concentrated but more full bodied and they're both fantastic in their own ways.  Unless you're hurting for money, I'd say replace your FP and get an AP on the side to see which one you like."
Coffee,3dxwjc,KaptainKoala,5,Mon Jul 20 17:26:42 2015 UTC,I'll sell it to you like this. . . . .you should try various brewing techniques. I use the aeropress mostly at work but I also have one at home that I throw into the mix. My current at home brew is typically a hario V60 pour over but sometimes I use my french press. Each style of brewing has a unique experience. Its great to change it up every once and awhile and sometimes certain roasts work better with different gear.
Coffee,3dxwjc,dervidjerseph,5,Mon Jul 20 13:43:05 2015 UTC,"The aeropress is the fastest, cleanest way to get a good cup of coffee.  If you buy one of the amazon packs you'll get enough filters to last you two years, so all you'll ever need to purchase is beans."
Coffee,3dxwjc,bannana,2,Mon Jul 20 15:42:49 2015 UTC,"two years   If you reuse those filters they will last much, much longer than that."
Coffee,3dxwjc,shord143,4,Mon Jul 20 17:19:11 2015 UTC,Wait you reuse filters? Doesn't that mess up the flavor of the second cup?
Coffee,3dxwjc,TheEmaculateSpork,8,Mon Jul 20 17:22:58 2015 UTC,"If you reuse within the same day and you wash it well it should be fine, that being said, aeropress filters come out to be literally .014 dollars each, saving them only saves you a penny so there really isn't a point."
Coffee,3dxwjc,bannana,2,Mon Jul 20 17:40:31 2015 UTC,"Not really IMO, others have talked about it here and this is were I came across the idea in the first place. Some people, like myself, reuse them multiple times and everything seems fine.  The only way to know is to give it a shot and see how it works for you, nothing to lose aside from maybe one or two cups or however many it takes you to decide."
Coffee,3dxwjc,sawyersutton,4,Mon Jul 20 19:26:17 2015 UTC,"Like others have said on here, it's not expensive to experiment with other american coffee methods.  I love what my aeropress does, but I am not sold on only having the option of single 10 oz. cups all of the time. You're not gonna go broke if you choose to get a pour over too."
Coffee,3dxwjc,RaccoonRazor,2,Mon Jul 20 17:55:16 2015 UTC,"This might seem obvious, but you can brew concentrates in the aeropress and then dilute to taste. You get a lot more coffee that way, but I find the flavor isn't as great."

Coffee,3dxwjc,p3ppino,2,Mon Jul 20 17:55:59 2015 UTC,"If you like the full bodieness of the french press then you should definitely get another one, or get and aeropress with the stainless steel filter for oils."
Coffee,3dxwjc,Fuckthepavement,2,Mon Jul 20 18:24:16 2015 UTC,"Do you only make coffee for yourself, or do you frequently make coffee for others as well?  This was the first thing i recognized when I bought the Aeropress, you can only make 1 cup at a time.  (Yes, I know you can make 2 cups, but its not nearly the same or as exciting/interesting as the recipes for 1 cup).  Chemex all the way.  Easier to clean, more possibilities to alter cup profiles, and equally as delicious, though in a completely different way than a french press."
Coffee,3dxwjc,BWebster704,2,Mon Jul 20 19:06:26 2015 UTC,"Aeropress is my favorite of all methods I've tried.  I recently got a Kalita Wave 185 with Kalita carafe and I just don't get it.  It's good but I just can't get the flavor I can with the aeropress.    The only downfall IMO is quantity.  If you are doing an inverted Aeropress, you may get a 10oz cup.  Most french presses you are going to get about 3 10 oz cups.  I recently got a Bonavita electric kettle which makes it easier to do another aeropress, but still a bit of a pain."
Coffee,3dxwjc,CptPatches,2,Mon Jul 20 19:36:42 2015 UTC,Aeropress is good if you're just making yourself small cups of coffee. Anything more and you'll probably want a pourover.
Coffee,3dxwjc,RaccoonRazor,2,Mon Jul 20 21:07:13 2015 UTC,"I've tried French press, aeropress, chemex, clever dripper, and V60, but my favorite for home has got to be the aeropress. I'd recommend it to anyone. It's so simple to use and you consistently get a fantastic cup of coffee. I make my morning cup of coffee with about a 20 second brew time, which is a huge plus if you work at the asscrack of dawn like me. My favorite part though is the cleanup. You just eject the filter and grinds as a ""puck"" into the trash can, then wipe or rinse the plunger off, that's it! Also, you can't beat 1 cent per filter."
Coffee,3dxwjc,6745408,2,Mon Jul 20 21:41:46 2015 UTC,"I use an aeropress with an stainless steel mesh filter and love it. It's not better than a french press, but it does work well. If you're making coffee for more than one person though, pick up another french press or go the pour over route.  With the SS filter, I find that it allows more of the oils to make its way into the cup, which I love."

My feeling is that, while a manual is absolutely helpful, and can be very important depending on how you intend to go about training, everything ultimately has to be about the trainee.  Everyone is coming in with different levels of knowledge and experience, everyone has different thoughts and feelings and presuppositions and styles of learning, and while there's some amount of general dissemination for a whole staff you can do, everything comes down to an individual level.  That said, tips and tricks or specific things depend on what you, or the manager, or the owner, wants out of their cafe, and not really what Reddit has to say about it.

Coffee,3dz7j9,i_dont_give_a_care,3,Mon Jul 20 18:52:44 2015 UTC,"My time has come! I'm originally from Boise, Idaho but am currently living and working in El Paso. You're in luck - up until about 5 years ago there wasn't good coffee now you have a few options. I'll list them below. If you're not familiar with the layout of El Paso, the ""West Side"" refers to everything west of the Franklin Mountains. The ""Northeast"" is between the Franklin Mountains and Ft. Bliss. ""Central"" El Paso stretches from downtown (directly south of the mountains, but north of the border) to about the airport, and the East Side is everything East of that. Generally speaking, the West Side contains more local restaurants and older buildings while the East Side is more developed and has a bigger variety of chain restaurants.   Now, onto the coffee.   BLDG 6 Coffee is located on the East Side, and is one of two choices for true specialty coffee in El Paso. They roast their own beans, have great espresso, and feature seasonal single-origins from their brew bar. I believe they use v60s, if I'm remembering correctly though Chemex might also be an option. It's a small coffee shop somewhat tucked away, but Google Maps will get you there easily enough.   Hillside Coffee & Donuts is the other option for true specialty coffee in El Paso. It is located on the West Side, within the fairly new TI:ME shopping center. This is by far the most ""hipster"" area in El Paso - the whole shopping center is made out of shipping containers. This is also home to the only record store in El Paso, and a couple great restaurants. They have an artist market here on the weekend. Hillside Coffee is a big coffee shop with long tables, a bar running the length of the room, and a few love seats around the room. The coffee is really good, though the skills of the baristas vary quite a bit. They typically have a couple single-origin options that they brew in a Chemex or Kalita Wave (I think), and they have full espresso options as well. Their donuts are made fresh every day and are really quite good. I've eaten lunch here once as well and it was great.   The Coffee Box is the newest addition to the coffee scene in El Paso (the grand opening was earlier this year), and it's located downtown. It uses BLDG 6 beans, though it's hardly specialty coffee. It's more of a ""on the go"" type place for people who work downtown, but the baristas are really nice folks. The Coffee Box is made of two shipping containers stacked on top of each other. Downstairs is where you get your coffee, but you're going to want to sit inside upstairs because the A/C works much better up there. There is also a nice area to sit outside and watch cars drive by while you sip your coffee. The Coffee Box uses an automatic push-button espresso machine and doesn't feature any manual-drip options yet. I keep telling them they need to, and the owners have told me that it's likely going to happen soon.   2Ten Coffee has two locations in El Paso: one in Central off Montana, and a drive-thru stand on the West Side. 2Ten locally roasts their beans at the Montana location. The Montana locations had some small tables to sit at, though no outlets so bring a full battery. The baristas and roasters here are great and love to talk about coffee. They make an excellent Japanese Iced Coffee, and their coffee-stand on the west side has fresh cold brew everyday. The Montana locations does manual pour-over in addition to espresso but the coffee stand only has espresso options.   Joe Vinny & Bronson's Bohemian Cafe (JVB for short) is getting a lot of press lately in El Paso, and I'm super stoked for them. They are located just down the road from 2Ten's Montana location in Central El Paso. JVB is my go-to spot to chill and enjoy cheap delicious food, quality beer, or great coffee. Their 420 fries and Javi Burger are straight-up incredible. They also make a mean cold-brew. The best part is that they are really affordable and love meeting new people. The name is fitting; it's the most bohemian place you'll find in El Paso with a huge variety of customers. They have plenty of outlets, and a great food menu. They also have revolving beers on tap and a good selections of bottles. Definitely check out JVB.   There are also a host of restaurants, bars, and lunch eateries in El Paso that have great coffee and food alike. Most of them use a roaster from Las Cruces, though some rely on 2Ten. These places include Eloise, Crave, and Ripe. Eloise also has interesting alcoholic mixed drinks that contain coffee. Their food is a bit pricey though.   That about covers it! If you want a coffee buddy while you're in El Paso, hit me up. I run a coffee blog (BoiseCoffee.org) and always love meeting new people and talking about coffee. Regardless, have fun while you're here. This city is really great, you just have to look around a bit to find the tucked-away gems."
Coffee,3dxxaa,climberslacker,5,Mon Jul 20 13:10:30 2015 UTC,"What did your search turn up? Here are my suggestions, with some notes:   Qualia Coffee, Petworth: The most interesting local roaster, in my opinion. They rotate beans monthly, and sometimes weekly-- very rare that you'll be able to purchase the same bean/origin more than a few times. Strong focus on freshness (beans sold to consumers are pulled from shelves after 3 days). If you're looking to buy beans for home consumption, start here... you can't go wrong. The few times I've had pour overs from the shop, they don't seem to pay attention to weight (don't use a scale for beans/water pour) which can lead to a bad extraction. Most affordable single origin roaster in the city (most 12oz bags sell for $13). They hold free to the public cupping's 2 Sunday's/month. Vigilante, H St NE (@ Maketto) or Hyattsville, MD: Probably my second favorite local roaster. They're much more expensive than Qualia, but in line with most third wave roasters. Their roasts are always great, and they've probably made the biggest imprint on wholesale in the city (9:30 club blend, e.g.). They do cuppings a few times a month. Compass Coffee: They do some rotating single origins, but these seem to be an afterthought. They're really big on creating blends that hit multiple tasting notes. Their focus seems to be centered around providing a consistent coffee year 'round. Notes on roast date are suspiciously absent from their packaging, at least the last time I purchased from them. Zeke's (RI Ave NE, near the MD border): They use an air roaster, which is faster overall, but I think tends to create roasts that lack complexity. They skew towards dark roasts, and I've not yet found a palatable offering.  Ceremony (Annapolis MD, but available via Colony Club in Park View): Falls into the ""wholesale account"" i guess, but Colony Club is one of the best third wave shops in the city. They've got a house blend specifically for Colony Club, and they offer a rotating selection of single origins otherwise. The barista's at Colony Club know what they're doing when it comes to brewing. Colony Club does cuppings every Friday, using upcoming Ceremony roasts. Peregrine Espresso, Union Market, 14th St NW, Capitol Hill: Not a local roaster, uses Counter Culture beans. I know you specifically asked about roasters, but Peregrine is my choice for the best 3rd wave shop in the city. They put a lot of work into training their baristas, and it shows. Avoid the Union Market location on weekends, as the line tends to be 15-20 people deep throughout the day. Wanderlust: Haven't actually tried their beans yet, but they're strictly roasters for now, no storefront. I'm pretty sure they're just starting out, so you could give 'em a try, but I have no information on them. Rare Bird, NE DC: online only, and first and last Saturdays per month. Their Sidamo Ardi is one of the most flavorful coffees I've ever cupped. Berry and vanilla explosion. M.E. Swings, Alexandria: I don't have enough experience to adequately give information on this, but /u/rowponiesrow has good things to say about them. Will have to check 'em out!   I left out: Sidamo (H St NE), Harrar (Park View, free bag of coffee for checking in on Yelp) as I'm not sure they qualify as 3rd wave... but the definition for that is nebulous anyhow.

After that I got a coffee that had really nice oaky tones to it that I enjoyed a lot.   Also, what was that about a free bag from Harrar? Do you know if they still do that. I'm always down for a free bag, even if it's not that great."

They don't use scales, so they're not as precise as you'd make at home, but still excellent.  For ceremony beans, I'd go to Filter.  Probably the best espresso in the city (tied with Wydown, but they don't do local).  Maybe I'm an outlier here, but I intensely DO NOT like swing's.  Way too roasty for my taste, with sour notes like I'd associate with cheap coffee.  If I were tasting this blind, I never would call it specialty coffee."

Coffee,3dx61z,LerithXanatos,6,Mon Jul 20 07:18:53 2015 UTC,"First and foremost - the coffee you're drinking probably is too sour. This may well be because it is a little underextracted, and making the grind finer would probably bring a bit of balance back.  Balance is really the key. High acidity coffees shouldn't be all about the acidity - it should just be part of the balanced end cup (if roaster and brewer have done their job).  Some apples are more acidic than others. Usually, a ripe apple - even if it is sharp, tangy and crisp is balanced out by some sweetness. Unless it is unripe - then all acid, no fun. There's no perfect apple, and your preferences for acidity will be different from mine in both apples and coffee.  Soft drinks are usually painfully acidic. They're also delicious, though the sugar is there to counteract the acidity (pH is a terrible measure of perceived acidity, though it will still tell you how effectively the drink will clean up your loose change). To me they're just another excellent example of balance and enjoying acidity, even when you don't think you do.  As for balancing out the brew: Start at 60g per litre of coffee, but don't be afraid to drop it down to 55g/l (I can't do the imperial on this. Well, I can - but I won't...)  Keep grinding finer every time you brew until the brew suddenly gets oddly bitter. The previous grind setting is then a pretty solid place to brew with that coffee. There's a bunch of other tips and tricks to get rid of sourness (sieving out the very large pieces of ground coffee coming from most domestic grinders is a surprisingly effective technique, though something of a PITA).  In the end - drink as much as you can with baristas, and ideally roasters. (Roasters will have a pretty fixed idea of how the coffee ""ought"" to taste - it's what they're aiming for in their day to day work.)  This might mean hunting out the odd tasting at places like Peets, or other local roasters.  At the end of it you might still dislike high acidity coffees. I love wine, but I'm never really going to love a high extraction, inky, fruited Syrah from a hot climate. And that's ok... Learning what I like and don't is most of the fun anyway."
Coffee,3dx61z,kingseven,15,Mon Jul 20 10:30:31 2015 UTC,"Let's be clear: your taste can't be 'wrong'. Even if your taste and pallete might mature, that doesn't mean you should drink coffee you find unpleasant until you 'learn' to like it. And don't assume a love of sour, fruity coffee is ubiquitous.  There have been enough similar threads to this here and on other forums, that it's clear now that there are plenty of people who don't like acidic, fruity coffee flavours. Those happen to be 'en vogue' at the minute so everyone is talking about that, and certainly a lot of coffee enthusiasts are into that, and good for them - but there are at least as many coffee lovers who aren't. Just Google 'sour coffee', 'third wave fruity coffee' etc, you'll find many, many rants from people who don't like the current flavour trends.  The key should be choice, so that those who enjoy that kind of flavour profile get their fix, but the rest of us who are just as passionate about coffee but prefer a more traditional group of flavours should not be excluded from gourmet coffee. In practice we're not, but you have to know how to 'read' the labels on gourmet coffee. What the third wavers call a 'dark roast' is what has previously been known as a 'medium' (a true 'dark roast' is the horrible burnt beans at Starbucks). This rule isn't absolute but it's a good guide. I get 'dark' roasts from high-end roasters and cafes a lot and it's generally more of a medium, and will have the more recognisable 'coffee' flavours.  And if anyone calls you 'unsophisticated' or says your pallette is unrefined etc, tell them where to stick it. Taste is never 'wrong'."
Coffee,3dx61z,DearTereza,2,Mon Jul 20 09:01:50 2015 UTC,"Taste is never 'wrong'.   People keep saying this on here, and it's making me very confused.  If you mean, ""You can never be wrong when you say, ""I don't enjoy X"" or ""I enjoy X"""", then I agree. I mean, you can lie, but you can't be mistaken about what tastes good to you.  If you mean, ""There are no objective facts about which things taste better than others"", then I disagree. There's a reason that the French Laundry can charge what they charge for a meal; it's because their food is objectively better than Subway. And Jeni's tastes objectively better than Baskin Robbins.  And if you mean the latter, then you should drink coffee you find unpleasant, if you think it's objectively better coffee and that you can learn to like it.  So, which do you mean?"
Coffee,3dx61z,RelativityCoffee,3,Mon Jul 20 20:40:12 2015 UTC,"The things you mentioned are not objective. They are subjective, but are established by common consensus. And anyone disagreeing isn't 'wrong'. Everyone tastes things differently.  To apply this, I contended in my previous post that common consensus does not strongly suggest light roasted, acidic coffee is 'better'. In fact, the vast majority of people don't like it, regardless of how uneducated you think that makes them.   Nobody had to learn to prefer a good restaurant to a bad one. Some tastes develop, but not all, there's nothing to suggest anyone can learn to enjoy fruity coffee (I've been drinking at various third wave cafes for the past year and a half and never got to like it as much as a good full city or viennese roast). Even if they could, that doesn't make their prior contention 'wrong'.  All taste is subjective, even that chocolate tastes better than faeces. It's just a commonly shared perception, which makes it begin to qualify as objective, but something as inexact as taste does not fit well with objectivity as a goal. In any case, consensus about light roasted coffee is nowhere near as strong as any of the examples mentioned, even among coffee fans. Plenty of people in the coffee world are not fans of that type of flavour, and vastly more outside of that world cannot tolerate that taste at all. It doesn't mean anyone is 'wrong' for liking it. It's just a preference, like people who prefer a particular type of bread, cheese, wine etc."

I just have an issue with the inference from ""All taste is subjective, nothing objectively tastes better than anything else, therefore your preferences are reasonable."" I think the preferences are reasonable, but I think it's clearly the case that some things objectively taste better than other things.  And I still just can't believe that if someone expressed a preference for feces over chocolate, you would treat it the same as someone who expressed a preference for vanilla over chocolate."
Coffee,3dx61z,RelativityCoffee,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:37:19 2015 UTC,"I would not. The whole point is common consensus is as close to objectivity as taste can get, and by that extremely unreliable and inexact measure at least, light roast coffee can't really be argued to be 'objectively better' - it is not predominantly preferred, even among coffee enthusiasts. I know you're not contending that either, I'm just trying to explain what I mean."
Coffee,3dx61z,DearTereza,3,Tue Jul 21 21:23:55 2015 UTC,"I still think that the reason I like acidic coffee is because I grew up drinking regular coffee. So when I tried those fruity coffees it was like a breath of fresh air compared to the same ol flavor I had been drinking my whole life. Sure it can be a little sour but it's like certain fruits which have an acidic, sour or sharp taste but still good overall. I could still go to a diner and enjoy their coffee but it feels ordinary, it doesn't challenge me."
Coffee,3dx61z,silentspyder,4,Mon Jul 20 13:23:34 2015 UTC,"Coffee tastes the way it does to you because you have no baseline. The day I began to really taste coffee was the day I had 10 cups lined up side by side in a tasting and got to walk around tasting each one while a mentor of mine told me the roaster, origin, and the notes he tasted.  Coffee is one of those things where it will always taste like ""coffee."" You'll never drink a cup that tastes like orange juice. What you will get is a coffee with a hint of orange or a finish that resembles tobacco.   Every time you go out and eat a basic ingredient (like almonds, pears, oranges... not cream chicken, salsa, etc.) really taste that ingredient. Don't just shove 10 almonds in your mouth and chomp down on it. Stick the almond in your mouth and let it almost melt there. Let your saliva do a lot of the work for you. It'll turn into some pretty gross paste as you slowly chew it. Let that coat your whole tongue so every tastebud is really activated. The more things you begin to taste and recognize, the more you'll begin to notice different flavors in coffee.  And one last thing that I've found that helps me specifically with espresso is not to serve it into a tiny 2 oz demitasse cup. Even if you're only pulling 30 grams or 36 grams. Put it in a cappuccino cup that's like 8 oz. It has a much wider opening so you can really stick your nose in there while you're sipping and get all the aromas while also tasting the espresso.  One last thing (I'll keep saying one last thing until I'm actually done, I guess) is get a scale. AWS makes a very popular scale that's less then ~$20 here the absolute BIGGEST improvement you can make to your coffee is a very good grinder and consistent weights in and out. Weigh the weight of every shot's grinds and weigh the liquid weight out. If you want good recommendations on where to start based your portafilter basket size (a smaller basket needs a smaller dose so that it won't hit the dispersion screen above, and a larger one needs a higher dose) you can feel free to send me a message."

The snare drum is essentially the ""heart of the drum set"". It's a main component of the beat so you want something to sound good. Snares are made from steel, brass, copper, titanium, wood (and all sorts of variants of wood shells)... essentially there's literally hundreds of combinations of materials that can go into making a snare drum.   Pearl Drum Company set up a display that had a large number of their snare drums set up in an array; all one could see was the striking surface (the head) and it had a number on it. Each drum was miced up and headphones provided so each ""tester"" could imbibe in the nuance of each individual drum.   So the testers went about their business and every one of them kept referring back to this one drum, the one that just sounded amazing and incredible! Certainly it was the $2500 Titanium Alloy model or maybe it was the $1250 Birdseye Maple wood shell drum...   ...nope, it was the $150 steel shell intermediate version.

Many pro drummers have specific tunings and an actual sound in their head beforehand because of what they've developed through experience. I'm sure there were quite a few people who picked the expensive ones too.  It's the same with coffee. The roasters and baristas have had so much damn coffee that they have nailed it down to having a list of flavor profiles to choose from. I think OP just doesn't like bright, fruity coffees. Just like some people who like craft beer but may not really like hop flavors. The idea is to have the flavors that you want in mind so you don't end up wandering around blind stuck with 7-11 or hotel coffee for the rest of life.

Coffee,3dx61z,Scrofuloid,2,Mon Jul 20 13:30:19 2015 UTC,"I don't know what it means for a person's tongue to be wrong. Obviously, people have different tastes. Apparently you don't like acidic coffees. You could try to acquire the taste (by drinking more acidic coffees), or you could some of the delicious, not-too-acidic coffees out there.  Sour espressos have kind of been the trend at third-wave places for the past few years. I'm not a big fan of this trend. Fortunately, there are still some roasters who sell not-too-sour beans. If you're willing to order beans by mail, try an espresso blend from Seattle's Herkimer Coffee, or Espresso Vivace. These shops tend to pull their shots low in acidity, high in sweetness, and pretty low in volume compared to what a lot of the other third-wave places are doing now. For this style of espresso, maybe start with about 19g of coffee, and adjust the grind until you get extraction times in the 25-30s range. To my tongue, this is how espresso should taste.  As for your sour Aeropress, my guess is that's a technique/method issue; I don't often drink Peets, but I don't think they're prone to under-roasting. Sourness often means under-extraction; try some combination of increased infusion time, hotter water, smaller grind, and more agitation. I can make more specific suggestions if you describe your current method.  Personally, I don't mind a bit of acidity in pour-overs and Aeropress, compared to espresso. Some beans really shine with a lighter roast level. Ethiopian coffees and other African coffees are often processed and roasted to be enjoyed this way. If you like more earthy or funky coffees, maybe try more Brazilian and Indonesian coffees, or dry-processed coffees from anywhere. Many wet-processed Central American and Colombian coffees tend to be what I think of as well-balanced, 'default' coffee, with clean flavors, sweetness, and moderate acidity."
Coffee,3dx61z,VolatileBeans,3,Mon Jul 20 09:32:16 2015 UTC,"If a third wave shop is pulling ""sour"" coffee then they're doing it wrong. There's a world of difference between sour and acidic and there's not a single reputable barista or coffee shop that strives for sour.  Sourness is a sign of underextraction in espresso. A well balanced shot (proper dose, proper time, proper weight out) will dance across the palate hitting all the areas of the tongue. And that totally sounds like bullshit until you've had a shot that does just that. Once you've had multiple shots like that you realize it's not just a specific origin or coffee shop or whatever that does it this way.... every specialty coffee has the ability to do this and it's limited only by the machines and barista pulling those shots."
Coffee,3dx61z,Scrofuloid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:43:45 2015 UTC,"There's a world of difference between sour and acidic   By definition, sourness is the taste sense that detects acidity. The more acidic something is, the more sour it tastes. By convention, people use the word 'sour' in tasting notes when they don't enjoy that level of acidity, or words like 'bright' or 'tart' of they do enjoy it, but these are all euphemisms for the exact same chemical phenomenon. The difference is in degree and personal preference."

Coffee,3dx61z,VolatileBeans,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:39:57 2015 UTC,"Sourness is caused by acidity but not all acidity causes sourness. A plum is more acidic then a grapefruit but isn't as ""sour""  There's really 2 different types of acid in every coffee bean - Quinic acid, chlorogenic acid.  Chlorgenic acid - This is the good stuff. It's also what causes the bad stuff. When coffee is roasted, it has very little quinic and caffeic acid. When coffee is roasted it begins to break down this chlorogenic acid. Generally, by the time you begin to get to a medium roast around 440º, you'll have broken down 50% of your chlorogenic acids and they'll have been turned into both quinic and caffeic acid. Chlorogenic acids though can be preserved by having a quicker roast. The amount of quinic and caffeic acid created depends on ""depends on the heating time and temperature"" according to a study by a university in Lublin, Poland. So exposure time during roast and heat level both affect how much of these side effect acids are created. Chlorogenic acid is also the most noticeable acid in the cup and what is noticeable in every cup of coffee.  Quinic acid - This is what causes stomach pains and astringency in the mouth. A coffee that is roasted darkly have more quinic acid because when chlorogenic acid is burned off during the roasting process, it creates quinic acid. Quinic acid is what you begin to taste when hot coffee sits out for a while. It's pretty undesirable but does cause a lot of the aromatics that we know and love from coffee.  But besides those 2 there are still a bunch of other acids that can be present in coffee in high doses and these depend on origin: citric (citrus flavors, orange/lemon/grapefruit), malic (apple/pear/rhubarb adds a bit of sweetness), phosphoric acid (mostly adds sweetness but sometimes grapefruit flavors), tartaric acid (grape/wine notes also adds sourness) and aecitic acid (vinegar in high levels, limely in low levels). These are just off the top of my head.  I'm a big proponent of acid in coffee. You can't have the flavors we love in coffee without acid, and they certainly don't necessitate sourness in coffee."
Coffee,3dx61z,Scrofuloid,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:18:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with a lot of your post, but not this:   Sourness is caused by acidity but not all acidity causes sourness.   I don't see how you can still think this, if you've read the definitions of 'sourness' I linked to above. All acids are sour to some degree, by definition. 'Sour' does not imply stomach pains or astringency; sourness is simply a measure of how much acidity (hydrogen ions) we can detect via taste. If a substance has no hydrogen ions, it is not an acid. If it does have hydrogen ions, it will register as sour on your tongue. So yes, all acidity causes sourness to some extent. This is not subjective or debatable; it's just what the words mean. I don't understand why you wouldn't look this up before typing all that out. The word 'acid' literally comes from the Latin word for 'sour'.  Of course, different acids can have different tastes in addition to sourness, because they have different conjugate bases (the stuff other than the hydrogen ions). These additional tastes (and the sourness itself) can be desirable or undesirable, depending on the proportions. This is the part that is subjective and debatable. For what it's worth, I do agree with you that some acidity is desirable in a cup of coffee."
Coffee,3dx61z,AtlasAirborne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:28:08 2015 UTC,"Move to Australia :P  Seriously though, within ""great coffee"", there exists a wide spectrum of flavours.  Even among craft beer lovers, some will hate porters and the like, some will hate wheat beers, etc etc.  Personally, I can't stand a lot of the US interpretation of specialty coffee, because I like sweet, chocolate/caramel flavours, and just a hint of bitterness (especially if there's any milk involved) and most of what I've had here has focused on fruity/floral flavours, and treated bitterness as so much floating stool in your cup.  Look for quality shops offering medium to dark-roasted blends, and your experience might be a lot more enjoyable."

Speaking simply, where a darker coffee might need to sit for a day or two before drinking, lighter roasts might need more like a week to sit. The acid and sour notes can mellow out with some extra time.   I doubt this is the problem OP is having; it's doubtful that all three coffees were too fresh. It's just something to keep in mind."

The thing about pour over stands though, is that it's really hard to make a great pourover with them.  When you pour with the cone on top of the cup/carafe, your scale will read what your final output will be as soon as it hits the cone. When you use these stands, you have no idea how much water you'll have (exactly) once the cone empties into your cup.   To me, there's no point in taking all the time to make a great cup only to leave it up to guess work at the end.

Coffee,3du8wz,iamdylanshaffer,6,Sun Jul 19 20:20:45 2015 UTC,Completely agree - 3 months in Peru made my SO and I miss a good cup of coffee almost as much as peanut butter.   I love peanut butter.   I just don't understand why they drink so much instant when South America is the continent that produces the most coffee.
Coffee,3du8wz,Yarncandy,27,Sun Jul 19 21:29:09 2015 UTC,"Third wave coffee is primarily a Western culture associated thing. Now, I'm no expert but I would primarily think that this is associated with there simply being more wealth in North America and Europe. We have the disposable income to spend $4 on a good cup of coffee every day, we have the disposable income to purchase a Chemex, to invest money in a reasonably expensive hobby, or spend an hour or two shitting around at our favorite coffee shop.  Many South Americans, and Southeast Asians can't afford this luxury. In many countries, Chile included, there is a rising middle class - many families are getting to the point that they're able to purchase their first car (as a side note, this is creating a real traffic congestion and pollution problem in Santiago, Chile) , so the times are changing. But, the wealth disparity that we currently deal with in the United States, or in Europe is absolutely nothing to that compared to what is experienced in South America and many parts of Asia. A ""middle class"" neighborhood in Santiago looks like you're on the wrong side of the railroad tracks in the United States, despite it being perfectly safe.  Anyways, my point here is, instant coffee such as Nespresso is cheap and it gets the job done. It can be bought in large quantities for low prices and it doesn't go bad. I highly doubt that many working men and women have ever experienced anything else. Eventually third wave coffee culture might make its way to these counties and become more common, in fact these places already exist in Chile but they're located in what are very typically ""tourist driven"" areas such as the Lastarria neighborhood in Chile - places like Wonderful and Colmado rank, to this day, as one of the better places I've had a cup of coffee. But, this type of coffee culture has yet to extend to other portions of the city - and I assume this holds true in other areas of the world as well.  In fact, the ""service industry"" in Chile and other parts of South America is typically very poor, and it's quite a shock visiting these parts of the world as an American for this fact alone. This is primarily due to the fact that ""going out"" is still yet something that many families traditionally don't do often, because it's not something they have the disposable income to feasibly afford.  I think once we see the middle class in these areas continue to grow, as more and more families have more downtime and disposable income. When the time comes that parents (and even children in many cases, because they typically stay in the family home much longer than is considered typical here in the United States) aren't working 12-14 hour days filled with mainly manual labor to support their family, and when the technological advancements that are common in America make their way into the daily lives of many Asians and South Americans (e.g. most grocery store checkout is still done manually in Chile, they have to refer to a paper ""guide"" and type in item codes to ring you up) we will start to see the service industry as a whole improve and we will see a rising middle class that has the time, as well as income, for things like third wave coffee culture slowly creep up in other parts of the world.  In many parts of the world, coffee is still viewed as it was in America during the 50s and 60s. It gets the job done, and that's about it. It's a working man's drink, and it's not meant to taste delightful or even be particularly pleasant. Instant coffee is simply  a more easily accessible, faster version of the coffee we had access to in the American 50s and 60s in many parts of the world. And quality coffee is seen as a way to produce money, not spend it."

Coffee,3du8wz,AsteroidMiner,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:45:10 2015 UTC,"No, it's okay to nitpick. Most of my experience is in South America, but I've definitely got some knowledge of Southeast Asia,  as well as some friends that are based there. But, my statement was somewhat generalized and definitely wasn't meant to include each and every country in the regions I discussed.  The makeup of every country is obviously unique, and the culture often changes even within different regions of the country.  I can't say I know a lot about Malaysia and I will say that in general, oddly enough, coffee culture in Southeast Asia is in a much better state than it is in South America.  So feel free to nitpick and discuss, as I'm entirely open to that.  How is the quality of coffee in Malaysia? I ask because $1 or $2 seems cheap, if we're talking third wave coffee which is specifically the type of coffee culture I was referencing. But, I also know that you can typically find food and beverages for much, much cheaper in Southeast Asia, even for meals of very good quality. So I wouldn't want to assume the quality is poor simply because the price is cheap."

The first time they served me breakfast, they gave me a mug of hot milk and a packet of instant coffee.  I dumped in the packet, gave it a stir, took a sip, and wow!  It was the strongest coffee I had ever tasted.  Blew the doors off the espresso I make at home with my namesake.  I somehow managed to choke it all down, but I drank it just to be polite.  The next day they showed me that I was only supposed to use a teaspoon worth of instant.  The packet contained enough to make 8 cups or more!  It was a lot better once I had the right mix.

If the choice is instant or stale, inexpertly brewed coffee from a drip or cafetiere, I'll normally stay safe with instant.

A gooseneck kettle isn't required, just something that can maintain a certain temperature for a long period of time so it's always available. Maybe a bonavita or zojirushi.  aeropress with paper filters.  grinder. Baratza Encore is a good one.    process:    Use the measuring spoon included in the aeropress package to measure out one spoonful of whole beans.  Have the grinder preset at a good grind size.

The damage caused by freezing beans and grounds is from moisture accumulating on the beans, and then freezing.

The best you can likely do in that range is a used/refurbished Gaggia Baby or Color, but you'll find your hand grinder severely limiting (and those machines, while actual espresso machines with decent internals, are pretty limited). If you just want something to tinker and have fun with, you might be happy with these, but if you want to start chasing the dragon and consistently make good shots, you'll be disappointed (good shots are possible, but lots of work, although admittedly what constitutes a good shot is subjective).  If you want a good, durable espresso rig, wait until you've graduated and have some disposable income to buy a real rig. If you're itching to buy new coffee gear, you can always get more brewing equipment. I'd recommend upgrading your grinder, which will improve your drip coffee."
Coffee,3dyf41,TheEmaculateSpork,3,Mon Jul 20 17:25:45 2015 UTC,"I was in the same boat and wanted to recreate the espresso I can make at my parent's house, and after doing some research, I can just tell you that it's not really feasible to do so below ~500. People recommended I get at least a Baratza Preciso to grind with (~250$) and a Gaggia Classic (~400 new) or a Gaggia new baby ($170 Refurbished). The cheapest thing I found was 100$ for a Gaggia baby twin on Ebay, but people say those break down often so I didn't really want a machine that was known to breakdown easily and used.  If you're being really frugal and find good deals, I got an encore (practically new) at 80$ and then you could go for the refurbished baby which puts you at 250$, but that's still over your price limit and that's being very frugal already. My price range was higher than yours, you can get a Gaggia Classic on Ebay for like~170 if you're lucky, but then you need a decent grinder to go with it, mini mill doesn't really cut it for espresso. Plus getting an used espresso machine really is a crapshoot, it could last you a lifetime if the owners took good care of it, or it could break down within a week.  I ended up going with just a Baratza Encore and sticking to aeropress, I also got a Chemex and a variable temperature gooseneck because I found a good deal and got them both together for ~70$. In the end, I'd recommend that if you really want to upgrade, just get a good grinder for now and then look out on CL/Ebay for a Gaggia Classic/Baby or maybe a Breville for cheap, and maybe just stick to aeropresses/pour overs/other cheaper methods for now."

Something like 1 out of 3 shots will be drinkable but you won't be able to repeat it.  With a budget of $200, you're really going to have a tough time.  Your best bet is to save up to ~$400 and then keep an eye on Craigslist or Ebay for a used espresso grinder that you should be able to get for around $200-$300 and then even a cheap machine like this will be able to deliver repeatable results.  Maybe not the greatest results every time but you'll be able to get drinkable espresso.  If you drink milk drinks, one thing to be aware of is that most of these cheap machines need to be switched from ""coffee mode"" to ""steam mode"" which takes some time.  Of course the ones that have a separate boiler, thermoblock or E61 group head system cost more $$$."

Coffee,3dvuqg,assingfortrouble,0,Tue Jul 21 02:03:49 2015 UTC,"Hopefully this doesn't come off harshly, but in what way is it substantially similar to a properly pulled espresso?  Some of the primary differences between espresso and coffee are that espresso:   Is polyphasic Is more viscous Has a flavour intensity and profile that is a result of an extraction that relies on a certain level of pressure and fresh solvent passing through the puck (as opposed to immersion brewing).   Given that your AP brew was presumably none of those things, are you basically saying it was ""stronger than regular coffee""?"
Coffee,3dvuqg,PoorRover,5,Mon Jul 20 05:44:18 2015 UTC,OP clearly recognizes that what he made was not actually espresso...  They are clearly not some noob that doesn't know the difference.

We all know we can make stronger coffee with less water in the AeroPress, so we want to know: is this just another one of those, or is there something actually more espresso-like about this recipe?"
Coffee,3dvuqg,AtlasAirborne,2,Mon Jul 20 13:18:48 2015 UTC,"Fair question. This is not simply stronger coffee - specifically, the flavor profile is much closer to espresso than simply a strongly pulled cup of coffee.  I tested this by running the same procedure without the rapid plunge (thus generating a higher pressure due to the rapid compression) and the flavor profile is different. So, I have to assume (I tried to think of a good way of measuring this, but can't think of one that doesn't require me to mutilate my AeroPress) that the pressure is considerably higher than a typical slow plunge, thus causing a different extraction profile."
Coffee,3dvuqg,RuB1sC0,2,Mon Jul 20 14:49:41 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I guess, having seen this crop up a few times, I'd wondered at the reason for it, for a lot of people I suspect that it's simply that ""espresso"" holds a certain cachet for them, which they wish to replicate on equipment that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, and that's something I'm critical of for a number of reasons.  For me, the mouthfeel and polyphasic nature of espresso is a huge part of my enjoyment of it.  That said, if you've managed to closely approximate the flavour you enjoy in espresso, with an AP, then that's pretty impressive."

Since you're selling a premium product, more than likely you won't be selling a lot of product in the mass market -- and that's where you'll find the bulk of Keurig users.  There, coffee is a commodity, and often price is the selling point.  I find that ironic, given that people are paying $45-$50 a pound for beans that are likely nowhere comparable to what yours.  The idea of pre-portioned product is intriguing, though, because that will ensure your product is as fresh as possible, and that it won't be as oxidized."

Compared to fresh ground, you lose about 10% quality immediately, the big advantage is holding them at 90% for ages after.

Coffee,3dulw5,anothercoffeefanatic,3,Sun Jul 19 20:25:03 2015 UTC,"That's actually (mostly) incorrect. Caffeine is a rather stable molecule even at high temperatures, pyrolysis only breaks down a very slight amount.  And roast degree certainly affects how the bean grinds. More developed roasts are less dense owing to more expanded macro-pores. More developed roasts produce more fines."
Coffee,3dulw5,_fups_,2,Sun Jul 19 22:25:51 2015 UTC,"I have noticed this trend as well. In general, super high grown Ethiopian coffees usually have this trait.   The only thing that came to mind immediately is that more fines are generated because the higher density and hardness of a high-grown coffee leads to more brittleness. When ground, it's possible that this brittleness leads the coffee to shatter rather than crush.    One analogy that I came up with was the way quartz crumbles or breaks into large fragments, while diamond or obsidian will fracture on a cleavage plane, with small shards occurring where the cleavage planes join.   Maybe it's a stretch, but that's what made intuitive sense to me."

Grades 1 and 3 were added to indicate higher quality processing, with 1-2 for washed and 3-4 for natural.  Here's a very detailed summary (though a few years old) of the classification and grading system for coffees through the ECX (Ethiopia Commodity Exchange).  And here's the shorter version (a little more reader-friendly).  It's also worth nothing that Ethiopia Grade 1 Naturals began to appear on the market last year, and many more have become available this season (some lots are still just shipping out).  Basically, this means that the coffee has undergone intensive sorting after being dry processed & has very few defects.

Coffee,3dss1z,Nparticles,6,Sun Jul 19 13:30:19 2015 UTC,"""Natural sun-dried"" here refers to the post-harvest processing method, referred to as dry processing or ""natural"" processing. Instead of washing the fruit off of the coffee seeds and then drying them, the whole fruit is dried in tact, with the seeds inside. This leads to a bit of fermentation in the bean, which imparts thick fruity flavors. When people talk about ""fruit bombs"" or big blueberry notes, those aromas and flavors come from the dry processing.  Wet processed, or ""washed"" coffees,  are cleaned up prior to drying. The super clean, floral, tea-like, and mildly fruited Ethiopians fall into this category. All of the flavors here come from the cultivar and terroir, so the fruit-like flavors here are relatively very mild compared to dry processed equivalents.  Which is better is totally subjective. Washed coffees are typically considered cleaner and more refined, but natural coffees can have insane complexity, with flavors you can't find without the processing method."

Kenya uses letters to indicate size with AA being the largest, Ethiopia uses longberry, shortberry and mocha and peaberry is a pretty common name for coffee beans that didn't develop properly and are smaller and rounder as a result.

Coffee,3dt1e0,CommunistWitchDr,4,Sun Jul 19 04:25:01 2015 UTC,"First of all, here's a link to buy the dripper. Shipping really kills the price bringing it up from $38 to $63 to the US. Personally, I'm still glad I bought it. YMMV. http://www.kyuemongama.com/en/eng_shop.html    Initial setup:  As soon as I got the dripper, I rinsed it with a full liter of boiling water three times and checked after the third that the taste of cold filtered water was unaltered by it. Possibly excessive, but I wanted to make sure any taste from production was gone.    Amounts:  16 grams of whole bean Ethiopa Reko from Sump roasters ( http://www.sumpcoffee.com/products/ethiopia-reko-10-oz ) was brewed using 256ml of preweighed water (so that the scale would not be in the pictures, it's not a beautiful scale). Unfortunately, I completely forgot to time the brew.    Grind:  For my first brew (the one seen here) I used one full revolution on the Lido 3 since I've heard from the person who practically sold me on it by raving about it in a coffee IRC room that a fairly course grind works best. No real evidence of over or under extraction, so I'm probably at least close. I'll try some other settings both ways just to see though.    Water:  The water I used is St. Louis county tap water filtered through a Pur filter heated to 210 and poured from a Bonavita gooseneck kettle. The pouring was done in circles trying to keep wetting as even as possible and using a pulse pouring like technique.    The Drink:  Now for the most important part, the coffee itself.  I swear that if someone had handed me this coffee blindfolded with no information on it at all and just had me taste it, I would have bet good money that it was a tea. A very enjoyable tea at that. I've had other brews I'd describe as having tea like attributes, this was not like that.  Absolutely delicious, but even knowing exactly what this is, a bean I've been drinking for two weeks at that (So good I got a second fresh bag, which I used for this) and know fairly well, I could barley convince myself that the drink in my hand was coffee.  And I'm not saying that as a point for or against it, the brew tastes great and that's the important part. The fact it's not something I'd have known to call ""coffee"" is irrelevant, I plan to use this device fairly often. And at least once for every new bean I get.  Also to note, the coffee was only improving as it cooled up until I finished the last of it.    Cleaning:  Not that bad actually, but consider that I use a Hario Woodneck. Every morning. At 5:00-5:30am. Before work.  It's definitely more intensive than throwing away paper, but doesn't take very much time. In my opinion, the work is slightly more than the Woodneck's flannel filter, but not by much. And the storage is easier, so overall around the same work as a Woodneck to use. I'll report back on maintenance over extended periods of time.    Conclusions:  This is a wholly different taste than paper, metal, or cloth. A good one, but very very different. For the time being, if you want to try it you essentially need to buy one yourself since I don't know of a single coffee shop offering brews from one. I highly recommend giving it a try if you can, but the price is steep enough it's difficult to recommend buying one if you don't plan to use it fairly frequently or consider coffee a hobby."

Coffee,3dt1e0,exploding_chemist,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:39:10 2015 UTC,I have exactly no idea. But I somehow doubt that infrared effects are what give it the taste it has.
Coffee,3dt1e0,kingseven,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:17:42 2015 UTC,"As a chemist, I think this is hilarious.   I think it's just saying that the ceramic radiates heat that is in the far IR, which is not actually a great thing when brewing coffee because it's going to absorb a lot of heat from the water in the process."
Coffee,3duwxn,cuatrofluoride,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:41:04 2015 UTC,I just got one. During my research I found no cheaper ones (new). Either be patient (ebay/thrift stores) or spend 75 on a new one. Bear in mind that these steamers often have some relatively exotic rubber seals; on second-hand ones these might be old/missing/brittle and need replacement.
Coffee,3duwxn,sirolf,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:56:35 2015 UTC,"I've used this type for years for cappuccino on the road and love it. Classic manual pump style. Easy to use, no worry about rubber parts. I've even poured latte are with the ""near"" microfoam I can get out of it if the milk type is right (good quality whole milk) and I haven't burnt the milk.  Cleaning = simply run the pump part under hot water directly after use.  Easier cleaning (less scrubbing) of the pot part if you heat it inside another pot of water, or just heat it on low heat and don't let the milk get too hot (to keep a good texture of milk and maintain the milk's natural sweetness you don't want it too hot anyway)."

Coffee,3duzll,Tarpit_Carnivore,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:30:54 2015 UTC,I have a refurbished Virtuoso w/ Precisio burrs and have owned it for near three years now. Using it every day and sometimes multiple times a day without any issues whatsoever.
Coffee,3duzll,thefourbees,3,Tue Jul 21 14:03:38 2015 UTC,"Preciso owner here. Bought it four or five years ago new. Almost bought a refurbished rocky, but the general consensus was that the rocky was old and outdated so I went with the preciso. It grinds well, but the build quality is horrible. Thankfully baratza sells all the replacement parts pretty cheap, but I wish I'd had the rocky, which I envision as being a bit more light-duty commercial (which I can't confirm since I dont own one). In other words, I think the grind quality is great for the money, but the grind quality is great only when the stupid thing isn't broken. I thought the preciso would be the last grinder I ever bought but I'm currently saving for a Mazzer or something."
Coffee,3duzll,familydogs,2,Sun Jul 19 19:15:23 2015 UTC,"I was down to the same decision 1.5 years ago and went with the Rocky. I got it secondhand for about the same price as a used preciso, not a single problem since. Very easy to clean/maintain, too. I think the size of the grind step isn't really the limiting factor in the quality of my espresso... There are a lot of aspects of my technique that could be improved first. If I ever get a windfall of cash I'd love to upgrade to a Mazzer, though, and make the Rocky a dedicated pour over grinder."
Coffee,3duzll,HoratioDUKEz,2,Sun Jul 19 21:28:20 2015 UTC,"Like the Rocky, the Mazzer Mini is outdated too.  The SJ is good, but for that money I would get a Macap or maybe the new Profitec T64 instead, they both have worm gears and are much more easily adjustable then anything from Mazzer.  Best bang for your buck will always be in hand grinding though.  OE Pharos, or maybe the new ROK hand grinder."
Coffee,3duzll,Xkot,2,Sun Jul 19 21:30:42 2015 UTC,"At the entry level for a capable espresso grinder, the two choices everyone mentions are the Preciso or the Rocky. From what I read across many reviews and threads here, it works out like this:  *Preciso: better grind and stepless, some reliability issues  *Rocky: grinds a little less consistently, stepped, but more reliable  In my case I chose the Preciso because the warranty will cover failures and my credit card automatically adds a year to the warranty of everything I buy. If the grinder fails after 3 years I figure by then I'll either buy replacement parts (which Baratza seems good about offering) or by that time I'll have decided if I want to invest more in a nicer grinder."
Coffee,3duzll,jacybear,0,Sun Jul 19 21:28:47 2015 UTC,The Preciso is not stepless.
Coffee,3duzll,westcoastroasting,2,Sun Jul 19 22:37:36 2015 UTC,"Lol, a bunch of people who don't know anything bench racing grinders in here. Thus is outdated, buy a hand grinder, lulz.   Just no."
Coffee,3duzll,menschmaschine5,4,Mon Jul 20 05:46:21 2015 UTC,Because it's the best option for the lowest price. The rocky is largely considered to be outdated and overpriced.
Coffee,3duzll,Anomander,2,Sun Jul 19 19:10:49 2015 UTC,"Additionally, at that price pont you're buying either performance or durability; the Precisio offers modern performance and makes making espresso comparable easy, while the Rocky is the brand-new-est ten year old grinder on the market - it's durable and ""works great!!!"" to the the crowd that leaves glowing performance reviews of the Roma or the Silvia, but it's an antique design and outdated performance that are solely counterbalanced by low price.   Once you're spending Rocky money, there's way better options - and used?  You could have a brand new modern grinder for the same price - in both cases you'll hear the call of the upgrade within five years most likely, might as well do your learning on a nice grinder."

Coffee,3duzll,_Sigma,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:46:20 2015 UTC,"I have a Preciso for espresso. I've had a few things fail on it from heavy, normal use. It's a plastic espresso grinder -- it takes a beating. But the replacement parts are cheap and Barazta sends parts for free most of the time. There is no grinder like it at the price. The Rocky is outdated and generally considered a poor purchase. The Preciso allows one to get a foot in the door, and then upgrade later one. Proper coffee reviews show the grind of the Preciso to be on par with some of the larger commercial grinders."

I was eliminating all dairy and cut that out about a year ago. Every time I try to have good coffee now with anything additional, it just tastes too weird, for me anyway.  I still like to have a dash of simple syrup in iced coffee depending on the brew method. But again, I usually add a bit of almond milk and that has a natural sweetness to me.  I've been about middle coarse for Chemex and really happy overall with the results regardless of ratios. I've been doing 29g coffee with 275g ice in the Chemex to start, then 225g hot pour over. I'm sort of addicted to that at the moment."

Coffee,3dt1mh,marshmallowwisdom,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:46:39 2015 UTC,ditto the Chemex. My preferred method...it produces such a clear crisp cup of coffee! And it looks pretty awesome on the counter too.
Coffee,3dt1mh,slohcinbeards,2,Sun Jul 19 22:45:31 2015 UTC,"Chemex is nice but I get tired of cleaning out the carafe every time I use it. I only use mine on the weekends really. If you prefer something easier, I recommend the Kalita wave in stainless steel. It's a mug-top pour over that makes really consistent and awesome coffee, plus it is an absolutely breeze to set up and clean.   EDIT: As another poster said, you will definitely need a gooseneck if you don't already have. Most people on here have splurged for the Bonita electric variable temperature, but I have the normal Hario stovetop kettle and it works fine. I just wait 30 seconds off the boil, which is just enough time for my grinder to get through its cycle."

I was almost ready to give up on the pour over and go with an aeroporess but I'm so glad I stuck with it and didn't return my Kalita Wave.

You won't even know the schmaltz is in there, it just gives everything a certain richness. But I mean, everyone has their own techniques, so just do what you enjoy."

Coffee,3dqfsq,ChocoCoffee,5,Sat Jul 18 17:36:34 2015 UTC,"Yep, the whole egg and shell, but it's water for much more than one cup. The boiling water cooks the egg/shell/grounds into clumps and you strain it all out. It absorbs the acidity and makes a really smooth brew.

Your water might be too hard, with too much limescale, or your beans might be too old, or simply not good enough.  My advice would be to try to rule out those factors first: Go to a fancy coffee place where they roast the coffee themselves. Purchase something that has been roasted recently, like within the last week.  Then clean your gear properly, taking care to remove all limescale from it. Boil some bottled water, and grind those beans just right.  It might just do it."

Coffee,3dqjuu,NarwhalingBacon,6,Sat Jul 18 15:00:21 2015 UTC,"I used to use a French press, but switched over to a Chemex as my main brewing device last year when I discovered how ""clear"" the flavours could be. For this reason, I tend to use my very light roasts with a Chemex. For darker roasts, I use my French press since it goes well with the thick body.  The variety is very important, as well as the roast profile. It's all preference. My recommendation is to find very light roasts from different regions (start with something ""bright"" and acidic like Ethiopians) and experiment with those so that you can develop a palate.   The other problem is that good quality dark roasts can sometimes be hard to find. Roasters don't want to waste unique or higher quality beans by roasting the flavour away. With dark roasts, the taste from the roasting process overtakes the taste of the bean. This isn't to say you bought something bad, but it's something to consider."
Coffee,3dqjuu,bethanynash,4,Sat Jul 18 15:08:35 2015 UTC,Agreed. We drink much lighter roasts with pour-over brewing methods.

Set timer to countdown from 4 minutes. With chemex on scale and scale tared I add 150gm of water and start timer. I pour away from the edges but otherwise take no other care. At 3:20 left on the timer I add 250gm more of water (bringing the scale up to 400gm). Next, I Very gently with a butter knife/chopstick etc i stir the grounds down into the tip of the cone until i am sure that all the gounds in that tip are saturated taking care not to tear the filter. (I found this to be necessary bc no matter how careful i poured - i frequently found dry grounds.) At 2 minutes left I add the remaining 300 gm of water bringing the scale up to 700gm Comes out perfect almost every-time. Finishes brewing almost exactly when the timer beeps. When something is off i usually adjust the amount of beans but not any other factor with the chemex. I brew medium to medium/dark roasts mainly."
Coffee,3dqjuu,wolffire99,2,Sat Jul 18 15:01:04 2015 UTC,Dark roasts in general burn off most of the unique flavors that really shine with hand brewing. None of the local roasters here even have dark roasts for that very reason.

They're cheap enough to buy new.  You only have to rinse the moka pot with water and dry with a towel (I use paper towels to not stain the cloth ones), with paper towel itself you can take away any residue and it will be nice and shiny.  Original moka pots were aluminuim, they heat quicker because aluminium heats quicker than steel. I'd only buy a steel one for induction plate.  Metalic taste may come if you try to clean it with anything abrasive that may scrape off the protection layer. Is is smooth to touch, or kinda velveti? I suggest you buy a new one (aluminium is fine) and try that. If the protection layer was rinsed off of this one, then you might be drinking aluminium itself.    Post a photo."

Coffee,3dq5zi,chubbychic,2,Sat Jul 18 14:32:46 2015 UTC,"A lot of that that taste is caused by the method you use? Be sure to fully clean the pot out, start by boiling your water in another pot,  then add it to the bottom chamber. Put the funnel and grounds in, then put the top on. Place the pot on the already hot burner from before with the lid open. Be sure to pull it off the second you start geting more steam than liquid.

Coffee,3drn26,expertlevel,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:06:43 2015 UTC,"I assume you mean immersion brewing. Can't see why it would be...  On a molecular level, the ice part is very seldom actually in contact with the grounds. The only real chance of this is when you first put in ice that is well below freezing and will freeze a small amount of water (with grounds) around it. The effect is very minimal and only lasts a short time.  The rate of extraction is temperature dependent, so too are most flavour compounds. In an ice/water bath it will nominally be 0 deg C (32F) excepting minor temp gradients. This is why fridge coldbrew will taste different than counter or ice immersion. You'll need to vary your brew time based on the temperature for a similar strength."
Coffee,3dqf85,TheyTukMyJub,2,Sat Jul 18 13:14:05 2015 UTC,I personally like the Indriya but it's a rather strong coffee. For a mild and flavourful one I'd recommend the Dulçao from Brazil.
Coffee,3dqf85,Huevoos,3,Sat Jul 18 15:19:20 2015 UTC,"I will take a look at the Dulcao, thanks! I've got the Arpeggio, and it has a very sweet chocolate-like after taste but the coffee itself is quite bitter. (Almost burnt ?)"

Coffee,3dpm8b,TheMokaPot,4,Sat Jul 18 05:43:52 2015 UTC,I own a lido 2 that has the swiss burr set found on the lido 3. I've had good results at 6 notches from zero using this recipe.  That being said the best way to find the right grind size is to repeat a particular recipe only adjusting the grind setting. Start at a coarser setting and work towards the finer settings. As soon as the coffee becomes bitter or you dislike the taste move back back a notch. You will have to repeat this process if you change coffee/recipe.

I love (and feel weird) about how there's no rules when it comes to grind and brewing. I'll have to keep playing around with it.  Although, I will say that the quality of this grinder is amazing but I'm still getting used to not screwing up my grind lock while unscrewing the bottom jar."
Coffee,3dpm8b,Naviers_Stoked,3,Sun Jul 19 08:07:23 2015 UTC,I use 16 notches on the Lido 2.  That may be a good place to start unless someone chimes in with Lido 3 experience.
Coffee,3dpm8b,ndbutter03,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:47:46 2015 UTC,Thanks!  16 on the Lido 3 would be really coarse. So I think the Lido 3 grind would be pretty different unless you had the swiss burrs that are in the Lido 3?

Coffee,3dm6it,MichealKenny,42,Fri Jul 17 11:55:58 2015 UTC,Why two filters? I have never had a problem just using one. Wouldn't it just take more oils (and therefore taste) out of the final product?

I'm genuinely interested, there must be a reason for it other than it being the coffee world's equivalent to double-bagging :D  Edit: After a bit of searching, I found that it might because using multiple filters can cause higher pressure that mimics the pressure-brewing effect of an espresso machine. It might not really be the reason, but it sounds interesting. Read here: http://www.wecravecoffee.com/how-to-make-crema-with-the-aeropress/"

Coffee,3dm6it,matholio,3,Fri Jul 17 13:54:39 2015 UTC,"I just use one of these - the specific one in the photo, in fact - it provides considerably more pressure (2-3x by my estimation) during pressing, and you still get the oils.  Plus you can wash them, they last forever, no more paper filters, and they still ""stick"" to the lid if you pour a bit of water over them while in the lid and flip carefully.  Edit: That link isn't very helpful if you're wanting product info, price, etc, so here ya go."
Coffee,3dm6it,Kijad,5,Fri Jul 17 20:25:52 2015 UTC,I have one but only use it as a backup.   I like the speed of shooting the grounds into the bin with the paper filters.
Coffee,3dm6it,matholio,2,Fri Jul 17 21:53:02 2015 UTC,"Ahh, that's a good point, and you can also burn the ever-living hell out of your fingers/hands if you grab it right after pressing to clean it off.  I usually drip a bit of water on the metal filter, then quickly slide it off the top into cooler water."
Coffee,3dm6it,grungypoo,7,Fri Jul 17 22:20:44 2015 UTC,My dirty secret is that I only clean my Aeropress before use!   Shameful.

Coffee,3dm6it,BleepBleepBeep,2,Sat Jul 18 03:16:44 2015 UTC,"I just hold the bottom of the aeropress under the spring water for a second after brewing. Cools the filter and grounds, and pushes the filter back from the cap so it sticks to the puck. Then move it over the bin, take off the cap, take the filter and knock out the grounds. Maybe it takes two more seconds, but it also saves the annoyance on the (rare) occasions where a small fold or misplacement of the paper ruins the entire brew.. :)"
Coffee,3dm6it,Roarence,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:13:50 2015 UTC,I bought one of these – within a week it was accidentally in the trash and never seen again. The force-of-habit of just plunging into the bin means I threw away the equivalent of two years of paper filters.
Coffee,3dm6it,TelamonianAjax,2,Sat Jul 18 01:56:44 2015 UTC,Some people just dont like the oils as much (ie. me) and prefer a more  chemex-y taste  (if that makes sense)
Coffee,3dm6it,najra3000,6,Fri Jul 17 18:01:13 2015 UTC,Maybe they're just trying to really clean up the pour? I don't think it makes sense or is necessary.

Coffee,3dm6it,w1ldm4n,3,Fri Jul 17 12:26:37 2015 UTC,But how does it make a difference from just pressing down after inversion?
Coffee,3dm6it,Englandboy12,6,Fri Jul 17 12:39:26 2015 UTC,"I suspect it just reduces the turbulence of the ground coffee in the chamber when you turn it over.  *edit: I just tried it, it makes for a better vacuum and you can flip over the press without as much of a chance of leaking."
Coffee,3dm6it,Gseventeen,5,Fri Jul 17 14:05:58 2015 UTC,"That's just because there's no air to expand. Many of the inversion methods call for swirling after you put the filter on. That is to warm the air in th chamber before you flip it, so it doesn't spill."
Coffee,3dm6it,simmonsfield,8,Fri Jul 17 16:46:41 2015 UTC,"My method for preventing spilling/leaking is to flip the cup over on top of the aeropress first, then flip both right-side-up at the same time.  That way, the cup is underneath anything that drips out."
Coffee,3dm6it,pokeatthedevil,5,Fri Jul 17 23:11:30 2015 UTC,"Sometimes when the water is not filling the aeropress completely, some grounds get stuck to the plunger part and don't touch the water. Pressing the air out before inverting makes sure all the grounds are completely submerged while pressing. At least that's why I started doing it."
Coffee,3dm6it,TelamonianAjax,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:04:59 2015 UTC,I've heard people say that pressing the air into the coffee adds bitterness.

Coffee,3dm6it,voidcirc,10,Fri Jul 17 20:14:49 2015 UTC,"I think that this is a misunderstanding of why you stop at the hiss. It's more because what's soaked in is seen to be overextracted, so the hiss is used as a cue to stop pressing so you don't get any more liquid. I don't think pushing the air out would really do anything.   But on the other hand I have no data so I could be completely wrong."
Coffee,3dm6it,sirolf,9,Fri Jul 17 13:46:47 2015 UTC,"That is absolutely why people don't push the air in.  That said, us home brewers probably aren't dialing things in as closely as people do in competitions, so the argument to push air or not sounds pretty stupid to me.  It's a really simple brewing method. You simply can't fuck it up if you have hot water, good coffee, and don't let it brew for too long."
Coffee,3dm6it,ezrasharpe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:26:48 2015 UTC,"I love the sound of the hiss, it sounds like i'm operating an espresso machine :( While I do feel like i might be over-extracting by pushing it too far down, i just... love that hiss. And i never taste a difference - Usually because i never extract for longer than 2m."

Coffee,3dm6it,brett88,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:52:28 2015 UTC,they mean the air at the end of the press into the coffee cup. i'ev tried it both ways and while aeropress claimed a difference in taste I wasn't able to.
Coffee,3dm6it,jglazer75,2,Fri Jul 17 23:01:57 2015 UTC,I am an advocate for pushing the air out before flipping it. I've had too many spontaneous eruptions of boiling hot coffee to not do it.

Coffee,3dm6it,Stereo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:12:00 2015 UTC,Make sure you store the plunger either fully pressed in (without the cap) or separate from the aeropress cilinder. The rubber tends to settle when compressed for a while in my experience.
Coffee,3dm6it,TheHumanMe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:35:05 2015 UTC,"I always press out the little bit of air at the top until a little coffee starts to leak through the filter, though I've never seen a guide that said to do it before this one.

Coffee,3dm6it,Stereo,3,Fri Jul 17 12:44:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I've always gone with a finer grind (8 clicks on a Hario Mini), and a 30 second steep, instead of the coarser, 50 second steep in this recipe. Intrigued by the second filter. Did I miss the instructions to prewarm the Aeropress?"

A more technical answer would be that your machine probably has less pressure applied than the commercial machine at the cafe."

Note that different brew ratios will result in different cremas. Many great espressos don't have a thick crema at all. I had a shot at G&B coffee that was one of the best ever with a brew ratio of 18g in and 43g out, with almost no crema. A brew ratio of 1:1.5 coffee weight to end liquid weight coming out in 25s will probably result in a stable, thicker crema. Sounds like you're probably pulling long shots that get watered down too much to get a thick crema, but if it tastes right then the coffee you're making isn't supposed to have a thick crema. Do you weigh your shots?"

Coffee,3dp4tm,thebsenior,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:25:28 2015 UTC,"For the most part, crema is only important for aesthetics. I found this video and really that whole series very interesting. They go through a lot of espresso myths like good crema = good espresso. Worth a watch."
Coffee,3dmq21,GoTeamJosh,5,Fri Jul 17 15:01:58 2015 UTC,"That temp for the aeropress is fine and most people would prefer that over 185. I love traveling with the aeropress because I don't need to be anal about the water and it still makes a good cup. Around 200 would actually be my personal ideal aeropress temp. I like it lower then most here, but not always as low as the Aeropress Champions. For the Melitta, the water actually isn't hot enough (off the boil or a little cooler is best, I like 206). Sounds like you are all good with the aeropress."
Coffee,3dmq21,RobbieZev,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:46:19 2015 UTC,I guess I spent too much time reading the recipes from the Aeropress Champions and convincing myself that I needed it to be a lower temperature. Thanks very much for the advice. I honestly had no idea what the right temperature might even be for the Melitta.
Coffee,3dmq21,voidref,5,Fri Jul 17 18:35:36 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's easy to cool water, just wait. =)"
Coffee,3dmq21,illamac,2,Sat Jul 18 06:03:48 2015 UTC,"You might enjoy something like a clever brewer. The cup profile is similar to a aeropress and it brews in a similar way as a french press but with easier clean up. If you're worried about being over-temp on the aeropress, the clever works well with the traditional 200 degree brew temperature. Because they're easy to use, even Starbucks sells them. You may be able to get one off the shelf for about 25 bucks, or online for 20ish. Additionally, they're plastic so it'll be a little safer for daily office use and wont be any worse for wear if it gets knocked around when your aren't using it."
Coffee,3dmq21,illamac,2,Fri Jul 17 18:12:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I'll read up about it. Is it a pour over device? If so, do you think it's better than the Melitta Ready Set Joe?"
Coffee,3dmq21,RobbieZev,2,Fri Jul 17 18:36:22 2015 UTC,"Super similar, except that it holds it water until you set it atop your cup, releasing the brew. So it works as an immersion brew like a french press except it passes through a paper filter once you set it on your cup. You'll get a richer body closer to the aeropress with this brew process unlike the Melitta. You can even make single cup cold brew with it. Just use room temp water for 8 hours and a 1:10 coffee to water ratio.     With that said, the Melitta is kick ass brewer for what it is. I just think that if you enjoy the aeropress you may enjoy the Clever's brew profile more.     Quick edit: More Uses!    You can brew tea with guy as well, letting it steep like coffee. Also, if you set it atop your cup before brewing, it will work just like the Melitta."
Coffee,3dmq21,firefox2150,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:42:12 2015 UTC,"The clever is amazing and my go to for one cup at my house, but like a French press, which it is similar to as an immersion device, the water should be hotter then 200 at time of pour."
Coffee,3dmq21,CommunistWitchDr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:50:14 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of brewers that I've never used (in fact, I've only used the Aeropress and Clever), but I love the Clever.  It's simple to use, and it would be perfect for the office, especially with the office hot water tap."
Coffee,3dmq21,illamac,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:24:36 2015 UTC,"There's also the Bonavita immersion brewer, which is like a porcelain Clever with a silicone stopper so no plastic is in contact with the coffee at any point. As a bonus, it looks a bit less odd on the desk than the Aeropress, but so does the clever.  It's what I'd get for sure if I wanted to start brewing in the office instead of bringing from home."
Coffee,3dmq21,blinkisnaked,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:08:54 2015 UTC,"I didn't know about these! They look great.    I will argue that for an office environment I think that plastic is better choice though. Cheaper and less chance to break if co-worker tries it out or if it is used often. And I would consider using plastic a pretty minor infraction in terms of taste. For home use, ceramic all the way. I'll definitely be buying one of these. Thanks for mentioning it."
Coffee,3dmq21,geekRD1,2,Fri Jul 17 23:20:20 2015 UTC,"I usually heat my water to 205 for Aeropress, so I think you're in a great spot to press yourself a mug of delicious brew at work!"
Coffee,3dmq21,tubcat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:17:03 2015 UTC,specific to your water temp question: I use a electric kettle in the office for aeropress and use it just off the boil. works great.
Coffee,3dmq21,paradocs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:21:28 2015 UTC,"The Aeropress is a great option, but a Clever Dripper is also great. It's a little easier to clean since you just toss the filter/grounds and rinse.  Additionally, although the Aeropress is a pretty awesome device, user  error (and sometimes the status of your plunger) can result in quite the scalding hot mess. With a Clever, the worst you do do is knock it over OR accidentally hit the bottom plate and drain a little bit. Neither will happen if you're not a goof. If you do inverted method on the aeropress, that flip can be scary if you have the plunger backed out most of the way."

Something about the paper or you could use a Kone filter if you want some fines in it.    I'm not sure what you are doing about grinding but my guess is that the best way to improve your ""in the cup"" experience is to get a grinder for work and grind fresh.    I have a Baratza grinder at work that feeds my aeropress and Chemex and I'm pretty much all set.    Oh and make sure to use freshly roasted and well roasted beans"
Coffee,3do40r,yeezak,5,Fri Jul 17 21:19:39 2015 UTC,"Too low, you won't obtain the flavours and aromatics you're after since the water doesn't have enough energy to fully extract.  Too High you'll 'burn' the coffee. Unwanted reactions will occur and the water will have enough energy to pull more out of the coffee than you would desire.  The sweet spot is around 200F, however different brewing methods can allow you to dip down lower or scale a bit higher. If you can get your water to 200F reliably without much fuss you should be alright."
Coffee,3do40r,june_yah,-1,Fri Jul 17 22:59:40 2015 UTC,"200F (93 degrees in logical units) is IMO far too high for light roasts. I usually brew light roasts at 80 C (176 in freedom units) and I think it brings out the fruitiness a lot better than at higher temperatures. This in with the aeropress btw so it doesn't necessarily apply to other brewing methods.  I don't think there's one sweet spot for temperature - there are so many other factors that plays a role - grind size, type of coffee, brewing method, personal taste etc."
Coffee,3do40r,RuB1sC0,2,Sat Jul 18 09:43:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed with all of the above with the exception that no temperature water ;) or ""cold brewing"" is another approach which yields interesting characteristics tho it takes a longer time to achieve a desireable brew. The process can take typically 12-24 hours to get best results but a decent finished cold-brew might offer a smoother viscocity, lower acidity, the expanded presence of fruity and sometimes ""sweet"" flavors; also frequently less caffeine.   One upside of cold brew is that you dont need really any equipment. You can cold-brew excellent coffee while camping for example, by brewing a batch of coffee grounds in something like a larger tea sachet (cheese cloth, fine mesh pouch etc) in a mason jar while you hike, or better, while you sleep. This is how I do it when Im on a longer excursion and don't want to carry my french press into the wild."
Coffee,3do40r,thejordachelook,2,Sat Jul 18 01:13:28 2015 UTC,"Why would cold brews have less caffeine? You typically use a lot more coffee than with normal brewing, so intuitively I thought that the caffeine content would be the same or more than in ""normal"" coffee ... According to wikipedia, caffeine has a solubility of 2 g/100ml at room temp, which is much lower than in boiling water, but I would imagine that the brewing time, which is many hundred times longer, would counteract that."
Coffee,3do40r,RuB1sC0,2,Sat Jul 18 09:55:49 2015 UTC,"This is a fair question, the variability (as I understand it) has to do with 3 factors:   The yield from the cold brew method is a concentrate, you need to add water to your liking, this affects the caffeine/liquid ratio Brew duration - longer the brew, more extracted Potentially the temperature of the water during the initial brew"
Coffee,3do40r,thejordachelook,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:44:58 2015 UTC,"I definitely want to start cold brewing but your insight in terms of using the method when camping just changed my life just now! I was thinking just aeropress, and maybe mako pot. But that would require a fire and a fire isnt always accessible."
Coffee,3do40r,thejordachelook,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:06:52 2015 UTC,"Im a huge fan of brewing this way. I like just about everything in coffee, but I can share that this has made coffee more accessible for me in a number of circumstances. Equipment is a luxury ;)"
Coffee,3do40r,hono1,2,Mon Jul 20 22:46:04 2015 UTC,In VERY simple terms:  low temp and/or short duration of brew time = under extraction = acidity / sour taste  high temp and/or long duration of brew time = over extraction = bitter taste  Keep in mind that the water cools down over time and if you don't preheat your mug/AeroPress etc. that'll also have an effect on it.
Coffee,3do40r,Iron_Tits,0,Fri Jul 17 23:16:31 2015 UTC,Except when you're doing a cold steep for 24 hours and using lots of coffee. Then it tastes fucking perfect and completely smooth.
Coffee,3dn11c,sharules,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:26:53 2015 UTC,I'm researching on the difference between importer-buyers and roaster-buyers and to explain to the coffee farmers.   Would love to hear your thoughts.
Coffee,3dn11c,Anomander,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:32:14 2015 UTC,Can you clarify what you mean by that?
Coffee,3dn11c,zacharack,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:41:20 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that an ""Importer-Buyer"" is typically a Coffee Trader. Think of a coffee trader as the liaison between the farm and/or exporter and the roaster. As for a ""roaster-buyer"", they would be a coffee roaster buying from a trading company, directly from an exporter, or in some cases like Bird Rock Coffee in San Diego, straight from the farm."
Coffee,3dn11c,BrahCJ,2,Sat Jul 18 01:38:03 2015 UTC,"The biggest advantages to direct-trade is that a roaster can build a longterm relationship with their farmers. This has a few advantages.  1) They can negotiate bonus kg rates for leaving under-ripes and over-ripes on the tree while picking.  2) If a green bean is bought, and then when the container arrives you're certain that the coffee isn't the same as you agreed to purchase, you have right of recourse   3) Traceability and moral standing. When you visit each farm every year you know the people who are farming your coffee. You know they're not children, you know their working conditions, and you know that they're being paid."

I'm a social media/event coordinator for a new shop in NYC and I was wondering how useful, how much time, and how much money should be invested in marketing through social media and events. I have a latte art throw down next week to put us on the map, a well curated Instagram for a few examples. Is the time and effort into these projects worth it from a business standpoint, how can I expand on a brand in an industry that feels already oversaturated? How do I stand out?

Coffee,3dmps1,magiccoffeetruck,2,Fri Jul 17 18:17:45 2015 UTC,"I have advertising background of a sorts as well and I'm going through the interesting process of brand/community building through social media. So far I've found that by far the folks who engage the most with the best feedback are on Instagram. I think that coffee lends itself to extremely visual and by extension visceral feelings that work really well on that platform. It also skews younger.  I do have Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest going but at the moment they are almost extensions of what I'm doing on Instagram (partially because you can post once on IG and then share to the others) because I found a more interactive group of folks on IG. FB has been good for longer more informative posts and I have a private group of users who help on specific feedback like opinions on labeling.   My focus is perhaps a bit different than an established shop though and I've had many people tell me they are living vicariously through my start-up process.   To build on the ""do something different"" mantra, what sets the coffee shop apart just generally?"
Coffee,3dmps1,Exoticbounty,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:15:28 2015 UTC,"Well right now this shop is using a newish roaster, but beyond that it's really the space that draws people in.

Coffee,3dmps1,magiccoffeetruck,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:03:50 2015 UTC,"I think you could definitely use that as a focus of your marketing.

Coffee,3dmps1,Anomander,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:26:55 2015 UTC,"Is the time and effort into these projects worth it from a business standpoint,   It is not worth not investing basic time and energy into maintaining your social media.    They may not drive growth or even contribute to it, but lacking a minimal presence can cost you, especially within the craft markets where target demographics highly value engagement and interaction.    So dedicate resources to keeping them up & running & current, don't try and justify your position based on them.    How do I stand out?    There's no answer to that, beyond ""do something different"" and hope it's not too different.  Or just do normal really well and hope the hype carries you to stand out.     how can I expand on a brand in an industry that feels already oversaturated?    It's easy to miss if you're only looking at current industry and market leaders, but you don't have to have a solid, well-formed, or even particularly good ""brand"" in order to foster relatively immediate success.  It's much more useful long-term, but most big brands nowadays didn't start out thinking branding and identity marketing; they simply branded themselves as themselves and didn't think twice about identity or communication or market engagement."
Coffee,3dmps1,Exoticbounty,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:48:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think right now my lack of a solid brand (both the shop and the roasters) kind of hurts.

Coffee,3dmpi6,RobbieZev,3,Sat Jul 18 01:03:32 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's not due to extraction (there shouldn't be any coffee solids left to dissolve in a complete filter brew). What's happening is the chlorogenic acid in the coffee starts to break down with heat applied to it. It breaks down into acetic and quinic acid. Acetic acid gives coffee a more vinegar-like taste, but quinic acid is probably the more unpleasant flavor, more harshly bitter and astringent."

Coffee,3dmpi6,dashed,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:11:11 2015 UTC,"Definitely in the two digits area, I can't see myself spending more than $100 on a grinder"
Coffee,3dmpi6,STLien808,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:28:30 2015 UTC,The cheapest decent electric is the capresso infinity at $80. You can also go the hand grinder route if that's still too much (Hario or porlex for $30-40).
Coffee,3dmpi6,drbhrb,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:44:49 2015 UTC,As long as you don't mind spending a minute or two grinding by hand a Hario Mini Mill or Hario Skerton can be found for around $30 and they are pretty consistent grinders.

Coffee,3dmpi6,PriceZombie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:36:47 2015 UTC,Can someone explain to me why grind consistency is so important even in drip brew? I get that different size chunks would extract differently but since the resulting product is a liquid I would think you'd basically just get an average which doesn't seem so bad.
Coffee,3dmpi6,Mywonderwall,4,Sat Jul 18 21:20:26 2015 UTC,"You'd get an average, yes, but that doesn't mean it will just taste like everything was extracted to one rate. Let's say you have three different grind sizes in your brew basket (that's generous, as an inconsistent grind will have like a million different particle sizes).   The first is the grind you were aiming for. This group extracted to a totally desirable rate. It's sweet and complex.   The second group is way more fine than you wanted. This group over-extracted. It tastes woody and bitter and astringent.   The third group is far more coarse than you wanted. It under-extracted. It's sour, lacks body, and has no sweetness.   Then they're mixed all together. The sour and bitter flavors dominate the cup. There are so many different extractions that the flavors are all muddled, except for the most unpleasant ones. There's sweetness in there, yes, because there's properly extracted coffee. But it's lost amongst all sorts of other gunk.   The more uniform your grind us, the closer you can get to just one level if extraction."
Coffee,3dmpi6,RelativityCoffee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:48:12 2015 UTC,"Imagine it this way:  the first part of your extraction is lemon juice.  The second part is sugar.  The third is poop.  If you're trying to make lemonade, you want the right amount of lemon juice and sugar extracted from each ground.  If you get extra lemon in there, and add in poop, it doesn't balance anything out, just makes the coffee too lemony and adds poop."

I would have to think if you were going through the kegs quickly enough really you would only need to do a power clean maybe every 4th round?

My little PSA isn't really meant to scare people away, but it's a design flaw that a load of people are running into. (I ran through a bunch of Reddit posts and Amazon reviews just to see if it was a fluke.) The problem is that the metal on the handle is all that gets contact with the bolt, so it's a really small surface area with a lot of force, in particular if you get beans caught up in the burrs."

Coffee,3dmdkb,Gefiltefish1,2,Sat Jul 18 02:05:19 2015 UTC,Go for a 1:10 (coffee:water) ratio.  You'll get better tasting coffee because it's actually extracting into the 19%+ range and it's still a plenty strong brew.  It will give you a much larger yield as well.
Coffee,3dmdkb,41FiveStar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:02:41 2015 UTC,Depending on how you strain you may end up with a bit more liquid. I discovered if I don't allow my brew bags to drain a while when time is up that I can lose up to half a gallon of the good stuff (am brewing in 6.5 gallon set-up).

Coffee,3dkz08,bubblewhip,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:55:52 2015 UTC,"You'll probably notice a difference in quality between fresh-brewed and coffee sealed in a thermos for many hours. However, since it's sealed, there'll be less exposure to oxygen (oxidation) and less loss of liquid and other stuff due to vaporization than with something open sitting on an external heat source. And retaining heat is different than adding heat to make up for the heat that is lost.  Also, colder things have less energy which means the molecules will have a lower tendency to escape.   The science all seems pretty intuitive, but you could set up your own experiment and compare the tastes side-by-side of what you listed."
Coffee,3dkz08,jja619,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:35:16 2015 UTC,"To answer one of your questions, hot plates ""burn"" the coffee because the plate is much, much hotter than the desired temperature of the coffee. When you put 95 degree coffee in a thermally sealed carafe, it will slowly cool down, a few degrees at a time, but will never go above 95 degrees ever again. When you put 95 degree coffee on a 200 degree plate, it will make up for the heat lost in the coffee pot as a whole, but the coffee at the bottom will get much hotter than 95 degrees, resulting in a burnt taste."

Coffee,3djx7x,Im_getting_to_it,7,Thu Jul 16 21:37:59 2015 UTC,"Aye, what a can of worms!   When I think of Ethiopian coffee very simply I think of 3 regions: Sidama&Yirgacheffe to the South (of Addis), Harrar to the East, and a larger region that I just call ""The West"" since it is so big and includes huge diversity from Limu to Jimma to Lekemte and more.  There are then many microregions within each of those 3 large regions.  3 regions is a massive oversimplification, but its my starting point for when I look at a new coffee from Ethiopia.    Yirg/Sidama usually has most of the famous origins (for example all 3 regions you mentioned come from there) and, for me, they usually have the tightest flavor profile goals, i.e. what a Sidamo or Yirg should taste like (though to give them credit there's still a lot of fun variation).  Western has a massive variety of unique flavor profiles so I find that the most interesting - there's no way to pin a specific flavor profile to the West since every micro region surprises me with something new and unexpected.   Harrar, while unique, usually disappoints me.  Harrar coffees always seem to have consistency/cleanliness issues for me.    Ethiopia has perhaps the coffee world's most strict set of classifications for each region's quality levels, washed vs unwashed, etc.  See here.  Take a look at the contract names (i.e. regions/microregions)  for washed vs natural, with grade #s corresponding to quality level (1 being best for washed. 3 being best for natural).  Pull up google  maps and search the names under ""delivery center"" to get an idea of location for each.  If I can muster up the time I will definitely throw down some more thoughts on this. I haven't even touched on specific flavor profiles yet.    Certified coffee (FT, organic, etc) can only be bought/sold/exported by a Union/cooperative.  There are about a dozen Unions and their hundreds of member cooperatives in Ethiopia. Their coffee usually does not go through the ECX. This coffee has trace ability to coop level.  Private exporters can only sell coffee that they have bought off the ECX. This makes up the bulk of Ethiopian coffee that is exported.  This coffee only has traceability to region.   Single farm coffee (i.e.one single land owner) can only be exported on its own (i.e. not sold into the ECX and blended with others from that region) if the owner of the farm's land has an export license.  These are the most rare to find.  Using the above rules, a private washing or drying station (not part of a coop or a single farmer) that purchases coffee from neighboring farmers must sell its coffee to the ECX.   A coop could sell its coffee to either a Union (of which many coops are members) or to the ECX (at which point it loses the coop's name since it is blended with other coffees from the region).  The tip of the iceberg.   Check out Boot Coffee's excellent guide here."
Coffee,3djx7x,coffeesourcin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:51:44 2015 UTC,"Wow. That is complicated and fascinating, and exactly the sort of thing I was looking for. I didn't know the difference between the ECX and the coops, and that you can't easily trace to farms.  I guess that explains the abundance of Ethiopian sidamos and yirgacheffe on the market, but not much distinction beyond that.    I would love to hear more about the tasting notes from the different regions, and also where you can find roasters that work with beans from Harrar  or ""the West"" as you call it.  Apparently the only etheopian coffees I've been exposed to are from the south.  Edit: more questions! I'm reading through the Ethiopian coffee buying guide you posted (which is fascinating by the way) and had a question about regions.  Is kochere considered part of the yirgacheffe region? Also, from the EXC contracts, is the second column all the different farms/coops that the coffee came from? For example, the guji contract has 5 or 6 different locations mentioned.  If you buy this lot of coffee are you just getting a blend of beans?"
Coffee,3djx7x,coffeesourcin,2,Fri Jul 17 01:41:58 2015 UTC,"Kochere is a woreda (kinda like a county), as is Yirgacheffe, so in the mapping sense they are equals (note Yirgacheffe is also a town name within Yirgacheffe woreda, while Kochere is just a woreda not a town). However, for our purposes a Kochere bean is often considered a type of Yirgacheffe.  ECX calls it a Kochere contract but classifies Kochere A as having ""Yirgacheffe flavor"" (B = from Kochere woreda, but not with Yirg flavor) so they tie Kochere to Yirgacheffe in terms of cup profile.     Second columns in the ECX contracts page is the geographical origin of the coffee (not specific farms or coops, which would require a lot more drilling down to micro regions/groups).  So, yes, a Guji coffee could come from one or a blend of all those locations. If it's a Guji bought off the ECX (i.e. contract name from first column) I don't believe they classify which sub-region it came from, but I may be wrong on that.    Maybe a coffee history buff can answer this question...why did Yirgacheffe (if it's just a small woreda and town) get its own far reaching cup classification, as opposed to, say Abaya or Wenago?"
Coffee,3djx7x,RelativityCoffee,5,Sun Jul 19 11:36:01 2015 UTC,"I'm sure someone who visits Ethiopia and works with farmers there will be able to say more, but I can say a bit. There are regions, and subregions, and co-ops, and particular farms, and sometimes even particular areas of particular farms. The main coffee regions in Ethiopia are Harrar, Sidama, and Limu. Then there are subregions (e.g., Yirgacheffe is a subregion of Harrar). Guji is a co-operative in the Sidama region. Kerbal Aricha is a washing station in Yirgacheffe in Sidama. And there's not agreed-upon labeling; e.g., some people label the Hambela Estate coffee as Sidama, some as Harrar, some as Guji.  Most coffee in Harrar is natural-processed, so it's a lot of berry and a tea-like body. Most in Yirgacheffe are washed, so it's a lot of lemon and a bit fuller. Some (like the Amaro Gayo coffee mill) are natural-processed.  Coffee Imports has a decent write-up."
Coffee,3djx7x,AmonDrool,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:12:33 2015 UTC,"Konga is most likely from the ECX.  Exporters can't verify with documentation because of how the exchange is set up.  Guji is near Sidama.  Technically, Guji is not a legal exportable grade.  It might be Sidamo Gr1 for instance.  But the coffees in the Guji Shakisso area are much more distinct in my opinion. There are 3 ways to export: 1. You are a Union YCFCU, OCFCU, SNCFCU, etc 2. Through the ECX (Ethiopia Commodities exchange).  Private washing stations sell parchment to private exporters 3. You are a land owner with more than 20 hectares of land (with a special license).  At this point you are most likely purchasing from outgrowers as well. I should mention that all of this business is regulated through the national bank of Ethiopia. Bonus fact: a lot of coffees in Ethiopia are organic because the Birr is a soft currency.  The transfer of goods and services into the country is difficult.  So most COOPs/Privates spend the cash to get organic certification.  It adds value in the market place."
Coffee,3djx7x,KCcoffeegeek,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:25:13 2015 UTC,"Some complicated answers! Here's a simple answer: for the most part, there are two types of coffee processing in Ethiopia, just like everywhere else. You have natural or dry process and washed or wet-processed. Occasionally you'll find an ""in-between"" coffee like Perc's Koke Cooperative which is a ""pulped natural"" or ""honey process"" or ""semi-washed.""  I'm sure there are some regional differences, but they're probably subtle as all get out.   What you're describing sounds like a natural process coffee. Natural processing is where the coffee cherries are picked, sorted and then dried, kind of like raisins, with the coffee beans still inside. Once everything is dried out they are processed further to remove the skins and other layers beneath. There is some fermentation that happens inside the cherry while all this is going on, and the beans pick some of that up, some sugars, and a lot of berry flavors that I love like you do. So, a natural coffee from one area may have different nuances than another area, but I wouldn't worry about it because those areas will have differences crop to crop and year to year, too. It's not worth micromanaging, to me. Just keep your eyes peeled for natural Ethiopian coffees and chances are you'll love them.   Wet processed or washed coffees are really common in Ethiopia, too. In this processing the skin and pulp of the cherries are removed right away and then the coffee is dried after all the sticky, syrupy gunk (mucilage) has been removed. Again, nuances can exist in different regions, but they'll change year to year, too. Washed Ethiopian coffees tend to be have bright lemon and lime acidity, a pretty thin body and short aftertaste and notes that can be downright tea-like. It has taken me a fair amount of time to like and appreciate washed Ethiopian coffees.   Once in a while, like I said, you'll find a ""pulped natural"" coffee from Ethiopia, too. The Perc Koke Cooperative is the only one I've ever seen. Pulped naturals get the skins removed during initial processing, but most of the mucilage, that sticky ""honey"" around the beans, is left behind and they are dried that way. These are a bit cleaner and more subtle than a full on natural, but they also have some of the lemon-lime high notes from a washed coffee. Sort of the best of both worlds, potentially.   Most coffee in Ethiopia is grown on tiny plots, so farmers will work as cooperatives or will bring their coffee to washing stations where the cherries from many farms will get mixed up together and sold on an exchange. You will rarely, if ever, find an Ethiopian coffee that came from a single estate, farm, or farmer this way.   So, ""Kochere"" is coffee grown in the area of Kochere, but who knows what farms and exactly where from, whereas in Colombia, for example, you can know right down to the little farm where the coffee came from, potentially."

Coffee,3diq5d,menschmaschine5,4,Thu Jul 16 18:55:39 2015 UTC,"While it's impossible to know what the water temperature actually is by ""a minute and a half off boil,"" I have found that higher temps lead to lower acidity and more extraction in general. Of course, it depends on the bean, but it sounds like OP is under-extracting, and temperatures that are too low could very well be the culprit."
Coffee,3diq5d,poorover,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:27:48 2015 UTC,"Development? Only hear that as a roasting term usually. Either way, higher temp will increase your extraction, which means a larger proportion of non-acidic compounds are in the brew, which will lessen your perception of the acidity.   But if your water is around 205f, (which it will be, if you are nearish to sea level, and left the lid on while you waited) you shouldn't mess with that. Grind finer. For some reason, a lot of french press tutorials recommend a grind that is WAY too coarse. I'm using around table salt (perhaps a bit finer) for immersion brewing."
Coffee,3diq5d,menschmaschine5,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:14:32 2015 UTC,"There's a remarkable amount of heat loss that occurs when pouring water even into a pre-heated vessel.

Coffee,3diq5d,Intrepid510,3,Sat Jul 18 18:26:50 2015 UTC,"How much coffee are you using? Sometimes the reason why their coffee tastes better is because they are using a lot of coffee. If you don't have a scale, a tablespoon is about seven grams of ground coffee.  So for a standard 8 cup (32 oz) press you should be using around 60 grams of coffee or 8 rounded tablespoons."
Coffee,3diq5d,menschmaschine5,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:32:45 2015 UTC,"I don't have a scale, but my french press came with a scoop that is supposedly 7g too. I've been using 3 scoops for 400ml of water."
Coffee,3diq5d,Intrepid510,5,Thu Jul 16 19:08:03 2015 UTC,Invest in a scale. It's the only reliable way of measuring coffee. You can get a decent one for around $20.

Coffee,3diq5d,poorover,3,Thu Jul 16 23:05:03 2015 UTC,A scale would be the way to go. And you should be using four spoonfuls for that amount of water.
Coffee,3diq5d,wolffire99,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:26:33 2015 UTC,21g per 400ml is a pretty wide brew ratio (especially for immersion). Try something closer to a 15 or 16:1.

It'd then take another 15 mins for him to hand you a completely manually-made coffee.

Coffee,3djaai,KlausGregor,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:21:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the reason I'd see the clover is the rarity, but the shop would have to already have it or buy it used.  The trifecta has the combination immersion plus pour over, and adds agitation by aeration."
Coffee,3djaai,RelativityCoffee,2,Fri Jul 17 13:52:01 2015 UTC,"Fair, but the Clover draws down via a vacuum. So it has the negative pressure chamber like a siphon. That basically pulls the coffee out of the bottom of the brew chamber instead of pushes it out the bottom via pressure on top like this and a french press. The clover/siphon neg. pressure chamber allows the coffee to be pulled out which gives you a tonnnnnnn more flavour clarity (and hardly any body). Not entirely sure of why this ends up as it does, but the difference is huge."

Coffee,3djzk4,CoffeeMechanic,2,Thu Jul 16 22:04:20 2015 UTC,Coffee looses weight as it is roasted roasted and the longer the roast the more weight is lost. The beans also become less dense and larger as they are roasted. Since your 2 coffees are not the same bean type there are factors other than roast that can contribute to differences.

You could get a bit more of a discount that way."
Coffee,3dj9r6,HoratioDUKEz,3,Thu Jul 16 20:11:23 2015 UTC,"As others have already stated, the Baratza Encore is the best starting point for an electric burr grinder - there's nothing in it's league for that price.  Forget Ebay and craigslist - get a refurb directly from Baratza for $99! LINK  Baratza's grinders are made overseas, but the refurbs are basically completely rebuilt at their facility in Washington.  I would wager that the failure rate of the refurbs is lower than the new ones!  If you want to step up in price a little bit the next tier has two good options for around $200.  These both have beefier construction, and the smart grinder has some smart electronics.   The Baratza Virtuoso The Breville Dose Control   After that you're getting to entry level espresso grinders, and again Baratza and Breville have the best two options:   Baratza Preciso Breville Smart Grinder Pro   Both of these options are well built and have much more precise adjustments.  After that things get expensive fast, but if you're ever really interested in espresso it's worth it!  Although the previous two are decent starter espresso grinders I wouldn't bother with anything less than a Baratza Vario.  Although the best bang for your buck in espresso grinding is a hand grinder - the OE Pharos (under $300).  There's a lot of midrange espresso grinders - about $750-$1000 (Baratza Forte, Mazzer Mini, Macap M4D, Profitec T64), but if you want the best you're going to need to spend plenty more than that.  The Mahlkonig K30, Compak K10/F10, Macap M7D/MXD, and Nuovo Simonelli Mythos are all top of the line grinders, but again hand grinding will be the best bang for your buck with the HG One.

A lot of people here might turn up their noses at your question and extol the virtues of grinding to order, which I agree is better in the long run.   For now, though, enjoy playing with your new moka pot. Grab some Iily preground espresso and it'll be perfectly serviceable.

Coffee,3djyq2,meddlingbarista,2,Thu Jul 16 22:37:14 2015 UTC,"I recommend going to a local coffee roaster/cafe and buying a bag of beans from them. Most shops will be happy to grind it for you on the spot.   Over the long-term, you will make better coffee if you grind the beans fresh on the spot. For now, getting some good beans locally (and ground by them) will make some great coffee if you can go through it in 2 weeks or less, and you store it in an airtight container.   On that note, I find that aluminum moka pots can take a while to break in. I recommend using basic grocery story coffee (ground with their available grinders) for the first half-dozen moka pots of coffee.

Coffee,3dg4ir,tobyj3,2,Thu Jul 16 03:38:28 2015 UTC,The temp control is usually misused. If you want to brew at 200F you'll need to start with water hotter than that because you'll need to compensate for the grounds being at room temperature. That also assumes your pourover is already at 200F.   They are great for green tea though.

The only thing that's a little annoying and not at all a deal breaker, is that to ensure the water is at the exact temperature you've selected, when it gets about 10 degrees away from the temp you can hear the heater shutting off and on, to slowly heat the water until it gets to the right temperature.

Coffee,3dgtzn,niram00,3,Thu Jul 16 04:02:39 2015 UTC,"Breville Barista Express owner here.   My 2 cents:  Its price is near your top budget but as a starter machine (my first machine with an actual boiler) I am quite satisfied with it.  I decided on it for several reasons:  Breville is an australian company IIRC that much like apple has strict design and quality control guidelines but their stuff is assembled in China (good luck finding a handmade italian machine that performs this well at this price range)  The built in grinder. This one made the decision easier for me. The grinder might not perform like a Baratza Vario but the burrs and the adjustments are really precise in the espresso range, it will do a proper pour over grind, but it won't get it quite right for a coarser grind like for a french press.  Breville gives you everything you need to start: 4 baskets (2 pressurized, 2 non pressurized) cleaning tablets, water filters, a brush to clean the grinder, a tamper, a tool for disassembling the head, milk frothing pitcher, the razor dosing tool, an illustrated guide..)  The portafilter has a unusual (54mm) diameter so it will be hard to find a bottomless portafilter for it.  Also has preinfusion and the pressure gauge is a godsend when adjusting your grind.  The cons: The water tank could be bigger, weird portafilter diameter, the tamper that comes with the machine feels a little too light and of less quality than the rest of the machine.  Overall I'd rate it 8/10, which is excellent for the $599.99 I paid for it."

Yup - unfortunately, espresso is an extremely expensive habit to get into.  The problem with espresso is that every little change or mistake has a huge effect on the final product.  There's not a large margin for error so good gear has to be extremely precise, stable, and have the ability to be fine-tuned; producing machines like that tend to be more expensive.   Why is breville so highly rated in reviews on amazon and it's not even mentioned in the sidebar gear suggestions?   The sidebar is probably somewhat out of date, it doesn't seem to have been updated in a while.  Also, Breville is an appliance company, not a coffee company.  Their stuff isn't bad, but a lot of people don't take them as seriously since they haven't been making coffee products for that long - whereas some of the Italian brands have been doing so for decades. FWIW, I haven't had an issue with Breville products and I think they're fantastic, including their espresso machines and grinders. /u/jorsiem's suggestion is a good one, I'd take a look at the BBE."
Coffee,3dgtzn,newdefinition,2,Thu Jul 16 07:04:41 2015 UTC,"There's two good options:   Get a really nice grinder, I'm thinking a Bartza Vario or Preciso. The  Preciso is the cheaper of the two at about $300, and is just about the cheapest machine that will consistently work for good espresso. The Vario is around $450, but is very good (it's regularly compared favorably to grinders that cost $1,000 or more). Both will work for brewed coffee and will also work for espresso when you/him get a machine.   Without a good grinder espresso is a frustrating and inconsistent experience at best, or practically impossible at worst. Plus a good grinder will make all your coffee better.   Buy the cheapest possible grinder and machine that will work (something like a refurbished vario, or a grinder that will only work for espresso like the LeLit PL53   The cheapest machine would be a small gaggia. Whole Latte love usually has some good refurbished models like this one that's a great deal.   I know it seems a little crazy to spend $200-300 on the grinder and only $180 or $200 on the machine, but that's because the grinder is really important, if that one thing isn't right, the whole process becomes so frustrating that it's almost not worthwhile."

You could get him a Vario grinder 300-400, or the Breville Smart Grinder Pro which is 200-300. (I know the price tag on the grinder seems insane, but it's worth it.)   OR you could go with the Breville Barista Express.  It's definitely slightly higher than your stated price range, but sometimes department stores offer it at a decent discount. (Like The Bay, here in Canada.) Has an internal grinder, which has pros and cons, but takes care of these purchases in one fell swoop, and they really are wonderful machines. 2 year product warranty.   Best of luck! You sound like a pretty thoughtful partner!"

Coffee,3dfmsh,jtskywalker,2,Thu Jul 16 14:40:17 2015 UTC,"French press is probably the easiest. It's less work than the aeropauses, but it has to sit for longer. It's a lot more efficient for multiple people, tho, since it only takes 5 minutes no matter how much you're making.  I have a 34oz french press (1 Liter) which is a pretty standard size and it will make 3 regular 11oz coffee mugs full of delicious brew."
Coffee,3dfmsh,MacEwanM,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:52:49 2015 UTC,I also have this problem.

Coffee,3dgpr5,jordansideas,2,Thu Jul 16 03:24:06 2015 UTC,"We've tried a lot of different variables in our batches (literally hundreds). Very simply, it's 50% coffee, and 50% matching that coffee to the other variables, which include: grind size, roast profile (light to dark), dosing, and steep time. So for a given coffee, we'll slowly dial in the formulation.  The first variable I would start with is roast profile, following by grind side. Too bitter? Maybe you have over extracted and you need to use coarser grinds or shorten the brew time.   We use only premium coffee, and using the same coffee the results can be surprising and delightful to not notable.   Good luck, would love to hear your experiences."

Coffee,3dgpr5,Buffarrow,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:02:22 2015 UTC,"depends what you want the cold brew for... eg  if you want to make a summery drink like a coffee lemonade (https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/3dbt9o/iced_coffee_lemonade/) i would use a lighter roast, natural coffee to bring out some bright notes and fruityness, i think that goes well with a hint of lemon  if you want a more traditional iced latte style drink, go for a dark roast to bring out more caramel and deep tones that will blend well with milk.   so basically, cold brew anything!"

Go crazy with it!"
Coffee,3dgo0e,StopMakingScents,2,Thu Jul 16 03:08:48 2015 UTC,"I have read that a 1:4 ratio (coffee:water) is good. I find it a little strong, and since I don't like to dilute it I have been experimenting by adjusting it to find the right strength for me. I think my last batch was a heaping 1/2 cup, which I put in a quart jar and filled with water. That was pretty good to me.  A plastic pitcher will work fine, but a glass jar with a lid would be better. Plastic can absorb flavors, so if you don't want to use it for anything else go right ahead. A jar is also easier because you can just give it a shake instead of stirring it. A french press is also great because it has the filter built in.  The water can be cold or it can be room temp, it really doesn't matter. Just mix the coffee and water, leave it on the counter for 12-24 hours, strain, then drink. You can add ice if you like. Store any leftovers in the fridge."

Coffee,3dgo0e,eugenemah,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:16:55 2015 UTC,"I've been doing my cold brew using 64-66g of beans in a quart size mason jar (~1L). The beans, after grinding, turns out to be just over 3/4c by volume loosely packed into the measuring cup (wife measured it yesterday so she could pass my recipe along to someone else).  I normally stash it in the fridge for a couple of days, and it gives me something I can drink straight up for when I really need a boost, or (more typically) diluted down a bit with some chocolate milk and a handful of ice cubes"
Coffee,3dgo0e,swroasting,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:54:22 2015 UTC,"1C = 80g of beans, 4C = 946g water, Your brewing ratio would be 1 : 11.825.  Most cold brew recipes range from 1:4 to 1:10.  It can be done at room temp and will extract a little more quickly than in the refrigerator. IIRC, people who do this in a French press at room temp generally steep 8-12 hours."
Coffee,3df6zf,peaksix,14,Wed Jul 15 20:11:11 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that while a $1000 espresso setup may be the minimum many here on the coffee subreddit may find ""acceptable"", don't let that discourage you from getting into the game.  I certainly consider probably around that price point to be a minimum acceptable NOW, but I started out on a $350 setup.  And I enjoyed the drinks I was making.  And as I could afford to upgrade and find some deals and step up the equipment I would think, ""Wow, that's a much better drink.  I was making crap before.""  You don't have to start out racing a Ferrari.  You can race a Honda Civic."
Coffee,3df6zf,bbrooking,2,Wed Jul 15 20:34:20 2015 UTC,"Good point. The hard part is I just don't know where to start. I have a Baratza Encore grinder currently, which everyone says is not suited for espresso. So I would have to upgrade that, in addition to buying a machine just to get started. And in all likelihood, I would be more than halfway towards the $1000 setup.  I'm also a huge fan of buying something high quality once and being done with it. I know that espresso is a black hole of upgrades, but the same can be said about one of my other hobbies, music / stereo equipment. And after spending a little more than I wanted on my first setup, I now have no desire to upgrade further. Which I can't guarantee would be the case if I had bought cheap speakers and other components as a first step."
Coffee,3df6zf,westcoastroasting,3,Wed Jul 15 20:46:19 2015 UTC,"Incorrect. The minimum starter setup is $500. That's a cheap gaggia (which is 99% of the expensive ones) and a preciso, tranquilo, rocky, or used super jolly. Out of those grinders, given your very fine idea of buying once, the super jolly would be the one to buy. The preciso just isn't an heirloom quality piece of gear, not even close, even if grind quality is excellent. The cunill is, but it has a few niggling drawbacks, as does the rocky (clicks for adjustment). The cunill is, however, a full fledged commercial grinder, and it has endorsing, etc. It's a hell of a deal."

And i'm not a huge fan of single use appliances. just to make a cup of coffee I would need a stovetop steamer, an aeropress, and a kettle. a single espresso machine is more attractive to me, but thanks for the idea.  As far as the aeropress, I basically just use the inverted method with a very small amount of water. I quickly read through your post. Looks like you get good results with tamping down? Never tried that."
Coffee,3df6zf,crappysurfer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:43:40 2015 UTC,Fair enough. Just thought I'd offer a cheaper alternative before you jump the gun on a machine. Try to find a machine with a good steam wand. And invest in quality milk as that will be making up %50+ of your final drinks. =)
Coffee,3df6zf,Doneeb,2,Wed Jul 15 21:06:02 2015 UTC,"I got a Barista Express by Breville. I've used it at least every day I've owned it (that I've been home) and absolutely love it. It's not the most expensive espresso machine, but in terms of usability, native grinder, and quality I think it's an amazing deal. I've been very happy with it. Having the built in burr grinder removes the need to get a separate one, it has lots of options if you want to get advanced but is also very easy to use if you're not crazy about customizing your experience.  I don't think you need to spend a grand to have enjoyable cappuccinos, though do consider other costs. Having freshly ground beans makes a HUGE difference. The sealed hopper and grinder on the Breville really help there."

Coffee,3df6zf,KCcoffeegeek,2,Thu Jul 16 02:17:01 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go against the grain here. I drink a TON of espresso both at home and outside in the world in GOOD shops. My home setup is a Hario Skerton hand grinder (I ONLY use it for espresso), an inexpensive tamp from Amazon, a $15 digital scale and a refurbished Gaggia Espresso from Whole Latte Love. I get espresso out of it with very little fiddling around that tastes great and I can also steam up very nice milk for the occasional cortado or cappuccino.   I do not make multiple drinks in a row, so if you're wanting to knock out 3 lattes for friends, then it's a different story. It's 220 turns of the crank or so for 18g of coffee on my Hario! LOL   I do the espresso first, set it aside, turn the steam on. Takes about 30 seconds until I am steaming my milk. Some say that is completely unacceptable, but I'd be interested in having them do blind taste tests to see if they can actually tell a difference in the freshest drink vs the one with 30 seconds of lag. LOL   There's nothing wrong with pricier equipment but it's not NECESSARY and I think the biggest factor is if you're making volume or not. I'm the only coffee drinker in my house so it's one, maybe shots or one milk drink, so this setup works great for me.   Have had the Gaggia Espresso since 2007 and I paid less than $200 for it then."

Coffee,3df6zf,acn684,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:57:47 2015 UTC,"I think so. I've never screened it to see for sure, but I get consistent shots with it, so I would say so. The thing about something like a Hario is there is wobble between the burrs since there is no bearing or bushing to stabilize the rod/axle that the center burr is fixed to. As you turn the crank, then, the distance between the burrs is larger on one side than another. The thing about espresso, though, is that it is such a fine grind that the wobble is pretty negligible, since the burrs are just about touching anyway. If you were trying to use that same grinder for a French press where you want big grounds, it'd be a mess because there would be a ton of play between the burrs. I think it's fine, for me."

Coffee,3df6zf,newdefinition,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:50:15 2015 UTC,Heres the thing: milk drinks tend to be better from more expensive machines.

The difference is in the beans - if you can find fresh beans and grind them then you don't necessarily need the best equipment.  While saying that, it's always best to get something that will last and is known for making decent coffee, but you don't need to spend huge amounts of money to make it taste good."

The problem with a small machine like that is that the same boiler is used for brew and steaming. Which means you can pull a shot or two, then switch to steaming and steam enough milk for a cappa or two. But if you're making 3 or 4 it's going to be a real pain in the ass."

I thought variable would be good for my aeropress, but have not changed the temp for any coffee related reasons. I do change the temp for different teas however. The main thing with a fairly precise temp is to make sure you preheat your other equipment to minimize heat loss.

Coffee,3dfrec,orthodox_caveman,3,Thu Jul 16 01:17:41 2015 UTC,"Rao says that caffeine is not destroyed or degraded at typical roasting temps.   There may be a slight difference between a very light and a very dark roast, depending on how the beans are measured out. Dark roasted beans (of same cultivar/terroir/etc) are less dense than lighter roasted beans, because more water has been roasted out and they have expanded more. Since the per bean caffeine content is the same, if you measure them by volume you will find that you will get fewer beans of dark roasted coffee than light if the volume is the same (and therefore more caffeine content in the resulting brew of the lighter roast). If you measure by weight you will get more beans of darker roast and more caffeine in the resulting brew of the darker roast."
Coffee,3dfrec,poorover,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:30:58 2015 UTC,"Idk if that is true. Light roasts are heated to an internal temperature of about 205C while darks are about 450C. Melting temp for caffeine is about 235-237C. Also if you need more evidence and have access to journals here's this paper http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10973-008-9138-4. Based on my basic chemistry understanding of the article (Enough for a Bio degree!), they show that there are three stages of caffeine decomposition, one around 160C, a second around 285C, and lastly around 455C. So it seems that a dark roast is near the point of the final caffeine decomposition process, and some dark roasts may even exceed that point. This doesn't mean that there isn't caffeine in dark roasts, there definitely is, but there must be some caffeine degradation at that point.   Edit: I meant 250c but confused  it for 450f in the dark roast temperature section. Light and dark roasts hit this first ""decomposition"" stage in the paper but dark roasts may get to the second decomposition stage."

Can't read that article as it is behind a pay wall. I'm only going off of what it says in Scott Rao's book (he has analyzed a lot of roasts, so I'll take his info over most). But if you care to, I'd like to hear a break down of what happens at 160c."
Coffee,3dfrec,poorover,2,Thu Jul 16 03:16:49 2015 UTC,"You're right, I mixed them up. The paper calls this process thermal destruction implying that the chemical structure is degraded. However, reading their discussion they call the first stage a polymorphic change in structure, which could be thought of as a molecule with the same mass but with a different organization. Possibly a bad example but sort of like paper crumpling when it is beginning to be heated to burning temperatures. In any case, I don't think this is the reason why OP feels more caffeinated. As other people mentioned, its probably mostly due to psychological effects and this slight difference in caffeine may be increasing the effect. There's a lot of research with novelty increasing drug reward in animals, such as animals receiving cocaine in a novel environment will increase their locomotor activity more compared to their home cage."
Coffee,3dfrec,orthodox_caveman,2,Thu Jul 16 04:14:34 2015 UTC,"Just to add some nerdiness to the discussion, a number of factors can affect the caffeine content of a cup of coffee, elements to consider:   Roast temp (orthodox_caveman already addressed this suggesting dark vs. light roast differentiation) Coffee bean genetics (arabic beans, while typically considered more flavorful, contain as little as half the caffeine as robusta beans) The age of the beans Brewing temperature Water volume / Coffee Grounds ratio Inclusion of other ingredients (esp fats) You; your metabolism, digestion, avg blood-sugar, your current state of fatigue, and generally of course your pre-disposition to caffeine    Interestingly caffeine is fat soluble and the presence of enough fats can aid in the absorption of caffeine, so if you're looking for more of a kick, you can borrow from the diet trend and throw in a good healthy oil or butter."

Coffee,3deyh5,ahonken,4,Wed Jul 15 19:14:03 2015 UTC,"What you used was a stove-top espresso kettle. Chemex makes good coffee. Grind is important. With darker coffee's, using a blade grinder and a french press is a little more forgivable because the bean is a little less structurally stable and any uneven grindage is all swept away at the end. A chemex makes a real mean cup of light roasted coffee. A light roasted coffee bean is harder to crack and therefore get ground unevenly in a blade grinder. Burr grinders are what you want with these bad boiz. You can pick one up relatively cheap, but it'll be a hand crank. Hook that puppy up to your dads old corded drill and you've got yourself a real nice set up. The grind and water temperature matter too, but I find when you throw a dark roast into a chemex, apart from being clean tasting, it doesnt do much for the coffee. A chemex makes a light roast coffee shine real bright."
Coffee,3deyh5,hotelfrontdesk,3,Wed Jul 15 20:19:46 2015 UTC,"If you've got $100 to spend put it all into your grinder to start with. A Baratza Encore is selling used (like new) on Amazon right now for $90-something. If you want to stretch to $200 then check out a Lido 3.   After that, look into other options. Aeropress or pour over would be a good jump from French Press. If you do pour over you'll probably want a Gooseneck Kettle. I prefer a V60 and that's nice. A Chemex is different, but also nice. You can really go just about anywhere from where you are.  But definitely start with a good grinder."
Coffee,3deyh5,fluffman86,2,Wed Jul 15 19:32:16 2015 UTC,Chemex is on the other end of the coffee spectrum from French press. It is pour over instead of immersion and uses very thick paper filters instead of a porous metal filter like the French press. I would recommend saving up for a new grinder. I recommend the bratza encore or a lido 2.
Coffee,3deyh5,PM_Me_Turkish_Coffee,2,Wed Jul 15 19:30:15 2015 UTC,"I'd say get a scale and a grinder and refine your french press. I've made French press for years and just eyeballed it and topped it off. Now I weigh the beans, grind them (in a sort of cheapo burr grinder), and weigh the water that goes in. I also futz with steep times between 3 and 5 minutes. I have my ratio pretty dialed, the process is entirely repeatable, and I could write directions for someone to copy and make the exact same cup of coffee I enjoy every day, in fact I have done this for when my parents visit, because my dad just puts an absurd amount of coffee in the container and forgets about it so it sits there forever."
Coffee,3deyh5,user_1729,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:08:25 2015 UTC,I recommend the Clever Coffee Dripper which combines aspects of the French press and the Chemex.  I was a long time Chemex user — and still use it for serving company — but I really like using the Clever for one cup brews.

Coffee,3dfacg,TwoToedTerror,5,Wed Jul 15 20:34:33 2015 UTC,"Overall I would say that it does more hurt than help when trying to apply to a specialty shop. They don't teach the best habits and there is very little talk on calibrating the coffee or one's palette.   That said however, cafe experience, no matter where it came from can be really helpful. The ability to multitask, deal with customers in a professional and informative matter, and the ability to prioritize tasks at hand are only gained through experience. Once you have that experience it is fairly easy to move it from one shop to another.  The applicants with Peets/Starbucks experience that I have seen do very well in the specialty coffee realm were the ones that were excited about coffee. They yearned for knowledge and wanted to see how deep the rabbit hole really goes. Most of them were also very sociable and had a very refined customer service approach, which isn't really something you can teach.   I would probably suggest to stay where you are if it is more stable and pays better than the Starbucks would. But put in the time outside of work. Check out this sub, Home-barista, Coffeegeek, sprudge and really cultivate the excitement and passion. That will get you much further in the coffee world that anything else. As a trainer I can say that I can teach pretty much anyone how to make coffee if they are excited to do it, their previous experience level doesn't really matter."
Coffee,3dfacg,mtdewman0809,2,Wed Jul 15 22:27:59 2015 UTC,Thanks very much for the advice! I'll definitely keep learning in the mean time - I had never heard of home-barista or coffeegeek so thanks for introducing them to me!
Coffee,3dfacg,Anomander,4,Thu Jul 16 00:44:03 2015 UTC,"In both cases much less important than other factors.  Biggest one in all cases is customer service or customer facing experience.    I generally like seeing a Starbucks' on a resume 'cause a lot of their customer relations training is/was really good.  But that needs to be supported on the applicant in person; simply having worked for SB doesn't guarantee those skills, it just suggests them.    As far as coffee experience, it shouldn't necessarily be your first priority in getting on at a specialty shop - you can learn as much or more hanging about somewhere like here as you might at SB, without the lens of corporate PR influencing training curricula.    In general, I tended to slot any other cafe experience in general with a tonal focus on ""coffee knowledge"" as a negative when reading resumes.  Working in a cafe is so much more about your ability to manage customer relationships with the business itself than it is about knowing how to ________ ""correctly"".  I would rather take someone who doesn't know which end of the bean to start grinding at but can make friends with all my regulars within the first week; most cafe owners and managers are much more comfortable teaching coffee than they are social skills and customer service nuance.  Not to say retraining other people's staff wasn't a hassle, just more specifically that the more value they placed in what they already knew, the more work it was to retrain them to what we wanted them to know.    A proven and strongly referenced history of success in customer service, basic understanding of and any necessary certifications relating to local food safety regulations, and a glowing track record of ""getting along with everyone"" from team-oriented workspaces are my three priorities in an ideal applicant; if coffee knowledge is prioritized in the resume above those more practical concerns it often indicates a similar misprioritization on the part of the applicant."

Coffee,3dfacg,kylesbagels,2,Thu Jul 16 00:55:31 2015 UTC,"Well this is just anecdotal experience but I  worked at Starbucks for a year and a half, it's a great job to learn how to communicate with people and be able to multitask. It is a good foundation to start out with. At least with the one I worked at they did really try to focus on the craft of coffee and reading materials when time was available but the standards of Starbucks stores can vary. I kept visiting other coffee shops especially specialty ones and now I work at a local one that uses a la marzocco machine and is all manual brewing with local beans it's close to third wave coffee territory in terms of how they run. You can climb the coffee ladder if you are determined enough! or work towards to a better job and save up and get specialty equipment is a good idea too. Edit: I have met quite a few coffeeshop owners that 'started' out in Starbucks, having a variety of experience is a great thing and you can always be super part time at a Starbucks with your job which is common thing with baristas"
Coffee,3dfacg,crazed_cyclopath,3,Thu Jul 16 20:09:20 2015 UTC,"Not much experience with specialty coffee shops, but I did work at starbucks for a bit. Since then I have worked service jobs with espresso machines and had to do some barista work. Honestly, the only real carryovers I got from starbucks work were experience steaming milk, and tasting coffee.  They had a no latte art policy, as the coffees are all meant to be the same. The machine does the grinding, tamping, and pulling of the shot for you. I guess experience at starbucks would show the ability to work under pressure, since most branches are usually slammed.   Im gonna go with no, starbucks wont help you, but it probably wont hurt you either. Id hold out in your better paying job till you can work for a mom and pop coffee shop if you want to do your hours with espresso machines."

Coffee,3dfacg,crazed_cyclopath,2,Thu Jul 16 00:56:23 2015 UTC,"Coming from a Starbucks barista, stay with your job now. If you make more than a barista at starbucks, you may be making more than a barista at a lot of other places.   That said, I have read (on this sub) and spoken to a few owners and managers at ""third wave"" specialty shops, one of which is a former SBUX partner. Generally, it doesn't have a lot of transfer. You learn a few things about tasting notes and roasts etc, but in my experience, people don't go to Starbucks for the coffee quality, but instead for their milky sugar drinks with some coffee added in. Starbucks doesn't use semi auto machines, so you learn how to press a button and the machine does it's thing and you call the product espresso.  What starbucks is GREAT at is customer service though. Any barista is supposed to give a good experience to the customer so they are more compelled to go back instead of frequenting the coffee shop that won't serve espresso in paper cups. You'll also learn about efficiently making drinks with a repeatable routine, so you're never not doing something if you have a line.   What I'm saying is that there's some good takeaways from working at Starbucks, but it doesn't make them the best starting point for becoming a barista."

Coffee,3dfacg,crazed_cyclopath,2,Wed Jul 15 23:50:57 2015 UTC,"401k is a good benefit, but you can get that at more places than just a coffee shop.

Coffee,3dbk21,Billcos8y,2,Wed Jul 15 18:13:55 2015 UTC,"That is an interesting thought. Yes, various substances have different suitabilities at given temperatures, and this COULD be used to control the extraction of unwanted substances if you knew their solubility curve.

Why isn't that a valid brewing temp? It takes longer, yes. So does room temp brewing vs hot water brewing."

Coffee,3dee0k,TriteContrivity,7,Wed Jul 15 16:52:04 2015 UTC,Filter paper. Chemex has a much heavier paper that collects more sediment and oils.
Coffee,3dee0k,Titus142,3,Wed Jul 15 16:57:55 2015 UTC,So if I used a V60 filter in a Chemex would I theoretically achieve the same extraction as in a normal V60?
Coffee,3dee0k,pig_is_pigs,2,Wed Jul 15 17:05:18 2015 UTC,"I think the adhesion of the filter against the Chemex glass may impede the brew when using a V60 filter. A Chemex filter in a V60, however, yields coffee with virtually nothing distinguishing it from a Chemex filter in a Chemex. The thickness of the filter itself restricts the flow rate enough that the smaller contact area of a V60 doesn't account for any appreciable change in the brew."
Coffee,3dee0k,fluffman86,2,Wed Jul 15 17:18:55 2015 UTC,"Also, the Chemex is solid, smooth glass, so the filter sticks to the glass, and no water / brew can slip through. Essentially, this means you pour the water in and you've got more of an immersion / drip style brew happening because the water only has 1 exit point.   The V60, on the other hand, has ridges all the way around the cone. So as you pour, water filters through the coffee over to the outside edges and the brew will exit the filter paper in the air pockets near the ridges. Each of the ridges create a swirl or vortex design, and that keeps water moving and agitating.  IMO, that leads to a quicker, less bitter brew on the V60 vs. the Chemex or the Melitta pour over brewers. More exit locations leads to less brew time which means less chance for over extraction which means less bitter.   You really really want a gooseneck with a V60, though. Standard kettle isn't going to cut it unless it's got a really fine spout and you have a really steady hand. You can get away with a quicker / ""coarser"" pour on a Melitta or a Chemex, though."
Coffee,3dee0k,wsfarrell,0,Wed Jul 15 17:12:10 2015 UTC,"Here are some ""explanations"" I've gathered for what the ridges do on a Hario---some from the manufacturer, others from ""experts."" You'll note that many are directly contradictory. 100% marketing BS in my opinion.  1.helps control water flow 2.aid in the even distribution of water and proper flow of air 3.funnel the coffee away from the filter and prevent over-extraction of your coffee 4.keep water distributed evenly among the bed of coffee grounds 5.meant to deter ""channeling,"" wherein water all seeks the same small path and overextracts part of the coffee, leaving the rest of the coffee underextracted 6.help prevent a vacuum from forming (which slows the speed of the water draining through) 7.provide aeration around the paper filter. 8.allow water to extract out of the side of the V60, as well as the bottom. 9.reduce contact with the paper filter and allow the water to run more freely 10.help create a separation between the filter and the cone, allowing for additional movement and expansion of the coffee grounds 11.promote the even circulation of the grounds when the water is added in a clockwise circular motion 12.allow the air to escape and the grounds to fully expand 13.helps to facilitate a more even extraction of the coffee and prevents water from sitting in the coffee bed 14.create a seal, preventing water from being dripped without passing through the grounds 15.keep the paper from sticking to the sides, preventing channels from forming"
Coffee,3dee0k,fluffman86,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:25:59 2015 UTC,"That's incredibly difficult to read. Let me separate those out for you.    helps control water flow  aid in the even distribution of water and proper flow of air  funnel the coffee away from the filter and prevent over-extraction of your coffee  keep water distributed evenly among the bed of coffee grounds  meant to deter ""channeling,"" wherein water all seeks the same small path and overextracts part of the coffee, leaving the rest of the coffee underextracted  help prevent a vacuum from forming (which slows the speed of the water draining through)  provide aeration around the paper filter.  allow water to extract out of the side of the V60, as well as the bottom.  reduce contact with the paper filter and allow the water to run more freely  help create a separation between the filter and the cone, allowing for additional movement and expansion of the coffee grounds  promote the even circulation of the grounds when the water is added in a clockwise circular motion  allow the air to escape and the grounds to fully expand  helps to facilitate a more even extraction of the coffee and prevents water from sitting in the coffee bed  create a seal, preventing water from being dripped without passing through the grounds  keep the paper from sticking to the sides, preventing channels from forming     Out of all of those, really only #14 is contradictory to anything. The rest are mostly repeating themselves more than anything else, but are otherwise true. And #14 is the only one that's mostly false. A seal is created between the ridges and on the ridge itself, but there are air channels between them. So when you pour, you have to be really careful not to pour all the way along the outside of the filter because the water will pour out the sides without hitting much coffee.   When I pour, I start in the center, making clockwise concentric spirals getting bigger and moving outwards. When I'm done I make one final pass along the outside to rinse down the grounds that have clung to the outside wall of the filter."

Coffee,3dbt5j,SmellyGymSock,2,Wed Jul 15 09:24:09 2015 UTC,"Actually if you want nutty and toasty, with minimal acidity and fruit, espresso blends can have this.   Something like Big Trouble  from counter culture, or really any nutty/toasty espresso blend. Counter Culture actually stopped labeling blends like this espresso because they felt that any coffee can be brewed any way, while most still use this for espresso, some brew it for drip, press, or other ways. I've had it before as drip, and it delivered the nutty toasty, slight chocolate notes, with minimal fruits and fairly low acidity. Not what I personally love, but seems right up your alley.  If it's moderate acidity in espresso, it's likely low in normal coffee. Hoperfully that will help your search opening a bunch of posiblities."

Coffee,3dbt5j,westcoastroasting,2,Wed Jul 15 09:25:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah,  the blend/roast was geared with espresso in mind.  I've seen coffee that are single origin espresso and non espresso,  that and talking with roasters,  it's become clear most coffees roasted for ""espresso""  are just roasted to mellow it out and bring out the toasty notes.  This doesn't mean a darker roast,  more so,  the ramp up to the first crank and or the the roasting after the first crack  is longer and slower .  This evens out the roast,  and mellows the acidity. Some places make this a darker roast,  others just slpw things down to a nice mellow but light roast. The components of espresso blends are often Brazilian,  but this has zero bearing on if it was or wasn't roasted for espresso in mind,  just a bean that it's cheap and works well in espresso (and brewed).   .  Take for instance  a bright Kenyan coffee.  Roasted for drip,  this would be fruity and bright at a light roast.  Perfect for some.  Through  it in an espresso machine,  it can be tongue twisting sourness!"
Coffee,3dbt5j,SmellyGymSock,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:24:55 2015 UTC,"Espresso is often made using a blend of beans that are usually roasted darker than beans used for drip.

I think the last time I made it, I used 15-17 grams, but I didn't make iced coffee. I used a tablespoon of sweetened condensed milk and got about 4-5oz of coffee on top of that. I also have never had a real Vietnamese coffee since there are no Vietnamese restaurants near me so I have nothing to compare mine too.    However, I think you could make a larger amount of coffee in a fashion similar to cold brew. Just make a concentrated amount of coffee in the phin filter, then dilute with some cold water and ice. Since you would be using hot water, more coffee should be extracted in less time so I think it would out if you used the proper amount of coffee for the size you want. I'm not a scientist or a coffee extraction expert tho so just experiment. If I were doing it, I would try maybe like 21 grams of coffee at a drip grind, fill up the phin with 195-205F water, then dilute it with cold water, condensed milk, and ice to your liking.

Its an amazing shop in culver city that seems to get no attention from r/coffee.  I don't know if it is because it is not ""3rd wave"" enough or what. But whenever LA coffee is mentioned its like they forget about this place. It's been there for 20 years so it's probably been roasting coffee in LA for longer than most any other shop mentioned here. If i remember correctly Balconi sources some of their coffee there too.  If you live in LA (especially the west side) you owe yourself to make a trip down there.  Rant over..."

I've sort of unconsciously started avoiding intelligentsia as I find their shot quality really suffers mostly because it's always slammed.   A trick I've learned with a number of these places (cognoscenti, Fairfax coffee commissary, and single origin in the farmers market especially) is to let the Batista know that I am in no rush at all. If they need to dial in, or make a few drinks ahead of mine, it's no problem.   Originally, I thought I'd get less than friendly reactions but 90% of the time I get looks of relief and gratitude and a fantastic shot. The only place this has never worked is intelligentsia...

I stopped by today and it was in the 10 -12 dollar range for a shot and it was around 6 -8 dollars a week ago. Hopefully, it goes back down to the 4-5 dollar range soon.   Edit: Yea I try to avoid the Proof location if possible, but I've been going during their downtime and I've had some pretty good shots lately."

Although they usually look a lot less complex, it otherwise looks very similar to the samovars I saw everywhere in Turkey. Usually there is a bottom reservoir that holds the tea and has a horizontal handle you turn in either direction to fill up your tea. Then there's another reservoir--usually on top of the first but not always--that pours out hot water so you can dilute your tea to your desired strength.

Stove roasting is very difficult to get right and even then, right isn't a great result. An air popper is usually the go to suggestion for simple home roasting and they are much easier to use, especialy because you don't have to shake it around over a flame for 5 minutes straight. So if you want to get into home roasting, the fastest and easiest way is to use an air popper, which is quite a bit less expensive than that and can be found used for even less than retail at yard sales or thrift stores.

Much more consistent and much fewer fines / sludge at the bottom of the cup. You'll just need to drink it up pretty quick."
Coffee,3dcxs4,fluffman86,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:17:49 2015 UTC,"It's obviously a strong opinion, but no. Blade grinders do not produce uniformly ground coffee, making the coffee both over-and-under extracted almost every time, resulting in a bad tasting cup. Furthermore, you're going to be unable to exactly adjust your grind from cup to cup, which is what enables you to find the sweet spot for your taste and your equipment. If you want an affordable grinder, get a hand grinder."
Coffee,3db2gl,koszorr,3,Tue Jul 14 22:01:49 2015 UTC,"Rust hasn't been an issue in my experience (and it's stainless, so it shouldn't rust).

It's also the only gooseneck with a variable temp function that I'm aware of."
Coffee,3db2gl,menschmaschine5,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:09:51 2015 UTC,Perfect.  It's not like I'm gonna keep water in it or anything and its going to dry after I use it.  I'm just sick of using the stove for my french press / pour over.

The other problem is that the plastic over the buttons is pretty fragile and starts to wear quickly. Also not a big deal to me but you should know if you care if it stays pristine.

My kids love using it for their oatmeal too.
Coffee,3db2gl,fluffman86,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:30:27 2015 UTC,Exactly what I would use it for.  Over in my area bottled/filtered water produces the beat coffee hands down.  Our tap is OK but for the flavor I am trying to produce from the coffee it will not work.
Coffee,3da1t6,Brandon58DT,5,Tue Jul 14 17:50:50 2015 UTC,"The Chemex will bring out more of the natural and cleaner flavours (and normally the sweeter notes) but the biggest change you can make is in your beans! If the coffee youre brewing has a more nutty or rich profile, youre never goiing to get sweetness if it doesnt contain it.  Try coffee that has taste notes of milk chocolate or lots of fruit - like central american or african coffees. Aeropress and French Press are both immersion methods so tend to bring out more of the deeper and richer tones in a coffees profile, as the Chemex is pour over, it takes the lighter notes and leaves lots of the oils (which can be bitter) behind. Good luck!"

Coffee,3da1t6,oktyone,0,Tue Jul 14 21:17:49 2015 UTC,"Chemex doesn't really ""bring out"" anything. The filter paper is thicker, so it (a) filters out more bitter oils and sediment, (b) makes for a longer brew time, and thus (all else being equal) a cooler cup, which naturally tastes sweeter."
Coffee,3da1t6,discourseofdesire,5,Tue Jul 14 19:48:16 2015 UTC,"so if it filters out the bitter oils and sediment, it leaves the rest and therefor it 'brings out' the sweeter flavours from the mix if it has it, no?  And the water temperature wont drop by passing through paper...? If anything, being absorbed by larger grounds would take the heat out of it, buy maybe by 0.05 degrees?  And a cooler cup doesnt always bring out sweeter notes, it could be more acidic or more fruity, it all depends on the coffee no?"
Coffee,3da1t6,IranRPCV,3,Tue Jul 14 21:12:46 2015 UTC,"In my experience, sweetness in a cup is mostly related to a good roast / quality of bean, than brewing method. So i'd start there, make sure you get a very good bean from a reputable roaster that lists sweetness as one of its main characteristics, and  only then, focus on brewing method to tweak it to get the most sweetness out of it."
Coffee,3da1t6,onthevergewoolf,2,Tue Jul 14 18:08:46 2015 UTC,"I followed the 80/20 method that Matt Pergers posted on Barista Hustle a few months back. I can't offer guidance on what brewer to use, but I personally try to keep all of the variables the same (temp, ratio) except for grind size, which I'll modify to get a more extracted or less extracted cup, until I hit that sweet spot we all look for. Hope this helps!"
Coffee,3da1t6,Baristaabby,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:55:59 2015 UTC,"I roast my own coffee from Sweet .Maria's.  You might try posting your question in their forum as well.  I use an aeropress to brew, and I find that if their descriptions suggest that a particular coffee results in a sweet cup that this is generally the case.  You might find that to be a good guide for sourcing roasted beans that provide the taste you are looking for."
Coffee,3da1t6,grindhouse_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:15:05 2015 UTC,"Try cold brewing. You get a sweet cup of coffee and it's 10/10 worth it. You have to use the French Press in the regular way, but with room temp water. So, put in a couple table spoons of coffee (that's the standard for me; use as much as you normally use), pour water up till the line, put the top on and don't push down the piston. Put the French Press in the fridge, and check on it about 12 hours later (so, leave it in overnight). In the morning, if you like cold brew, push the piston down and pour yourself a cup, and if you don't like your coffee cold, you can just heat it. It's worth a try at least once, I promise."
Coffee,3da1t6,Baristaabby,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:22:31 2015 UTC,"First off, the easiest way to bring out sweetness is to find a more bitter coffee that already lends itself to sweet notes: milk chocolate, caramel, bourbon, etc, also a darker roast. Unlike some other suggestions posted here, I would stay far away from some floral/fruity African coffees since those tend to be more acidic. I think that off the vat this will make the biggest difference, but you should also try exploring brewing at a lower temp, under 210 degrees. Hope that helps!"
Coffee,3da1t6,I_lie_50_percent,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:40:38 2015 UTC,What do you mean by bitter? I assumed bitterness came from brew method... Also would dark roast only caramelise the natural sugars and therefor degrade the sugars rather than preserve them?
Coffee,3da1t6,crispykid,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:17:28 2015 UTC,"Not so much. When tasting coffee, you evaluate it for on a scale from acidity to bitterness. Bitter notes would still be considered chocolates, caramelly, etc. All coffee has different bitter/acidic notes, so bitterness is really just referring to specific notes, as well as the development of the coffee which can be affected by brew method. As far as dark roasts caramelizing natural sugars, I don't think so, but this isn't something that I've heard of happening so I can't really say."

If possible, getting a cheap electric kettle from walmart or somewhere (something like this) would give you hot water quickly and easily, otherwise you can just put a pyrex measuring cup (or even another mug) in the microwave for a couple minutes and you're good to go. The aeropress will let you make a concentrated drink similar to (not exactly the same as though) that of a moka pot, and there are loads of different techniques for brewing if you ever want to try other styles of coffee.  If you just want something concentrated like cuban coffee, put it in, add water, push down the plunger, done."

Coffee,3d98bw,Hamtaur,6,Tue Jul 14 14:19:08 2015 UTC,"You may be experiencing channeling. This is when the water finds a ""shortcut"" through your puck, typically around the edges or through a crack. First, don't tamp too hard, shoot for about 30lbs of pressure, not much more. Coffeeshops often train baristas using a bathroom scale on the counter. Too much pressure and your puck will be brittle, and crack under pressure.    Next, don't overfill your portafilter. Ensure that your grounds have a little room to expand. Without, water will not evenly disperse.     Finally, briefly hold your portafilter with tamped coffee grounds upside down before locking in your portafilter to ensure you have an even tamp all the way around the edge of your puck. If you tamped well, your grounds usually will not fall out. If the tamp is uneven around the edges, your water may flow around your puck rather than through it.     Oh, also avoid banging your portafilter on anything before locking it in as it will ""unseat"" the puck. Lock it in gently to ensure that doesn't happen as well.    Hope some of this helps. You may also double check your pressure, grind size, and dispersion screens.     Edit: If it helps, let me know and I'll try to take some quick pictures and demonstrate what I'm talking about."
Coffee,3d98bw,illamac,2,Tue Jul 14 17:16:45 2015 UTC,"Also, have a look and see if your seals are locking in right - if theyre wearing out water might be escaping around them and channeling the coffee."
Coffee,3d98bw,grindhouse_,3,Tue Jul 14 18:01:17 2015 UTC,Instead of tamping harder I would recommend trying to dial in your grind size a bit. If you grind a little finer you will notice a difference in extraction speed. Play around with the grind size but keep your tamp consistent so you know which variable you are changing.  This might take 5 or 10 shots to get right. Hope this helps.
Coffee,3d98bw,FoodeatFood,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:25:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  It sounds like OP removed build up when they cleaned and now has increased pressure at the brewhead.  A finer grind should compensate.  In general, I tamp the same way every time and tweak the grind as needed."

Coffee,3d98bw,j1mdan1els,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:18:19 2015 UTC,"I have the exact same setup and deal with the same thing after pretty much every cleaning. One thing that helps is to back off the nut on the screen by a quarter turn. Don't tighten it all the way. It might be unique to my dosing habits, but it seems to help.  One other thing someone mentioned is that updosing might actually be harming you. To add to that, I've heard that the Silvia is really sensitive to updosing, and actually does better with a smaller dose. Supposedly it has something to do with needing headroom for pressure to build up more gradually."

Coffee,3d98bw,PriceZombie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:33:37 2015 UTC,"It may be that the change in speed you've seen is just coincidental to the cleaning. Someone's already mentioned that you might be suffering from channeling but you have to remember that as beans age and as humidity changes, you have to grind finer. If trying a finer grind wasn't your first step in remedying the problem then the other things you tried (harder tamp and more coffee in the portafilter) might have just added to the first problem.  TL;DR go back to the original weight/tamp but grind finer."

I mean, an industry leader in a pretty flaky field is announcing they're launching a tasting kit that standardizes the language of coffee analysis ...  Same as every one else who's launched a standard, lexicon, or kit.   The article mentions a few other competing initiatives coming down the pipe as well, and it seems to fall into the pitfall of code standards in programming.  Have two standards, try and unify them, end up with three standards - repeat until you can't count that high.    Why are none of these folks trying to develop, refine, and grow existing standards, rather than each attempting to create their standard to compete for primacy."
Coffee,3d9g3c,Anomander,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:38:51 2015 UTC,"It's a defect kit, rather than a coffee analysis kit or anything similar.

Video: The b-roll is a bit long for some of these, but the overall aesthetic is compelling. In the same way that some people have a face for radio, those presenting have a demeanor for being baristas, and there is nothing wrong with having this demeanor, it just doesn't (oddly) seem easy to identify with in a tutorial. I think that another approach worth trying may be to complete the videos with subtitles and clever tunes, or an independent voiceover with close up shots of the process. This will focus the attention of the viewer on the process instead of identifying irrelevant non-verbal (specifically body language) communication, and taking away from the intended message. Just my silly rant.  On the coffee, particularly the pour-over clips; I think it's okay that they pull ""early"" this could be discussed further in the video, but as it's something that can be polarizing, it may just be best to identify this as a typical thing that people run into during this process and that it means different things to different people."
Coffee,3da2d8,sawyersutton,2,Wed Jul 15 01:24:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for writing that all out.  Funny thing is, I actually like that about the videos, that they seem less like a tutorial in a way and more of an interaction with a barista. I guess because in the end, someone learning to do a pourover has to learn to pour slowly and correctly themselves and its not really something that can be just immediately copied correctly.  I don't really understand your last paragraph. Specifically, I think its ok to pull  before its finished draining if you have the amount you want to end up with or during a pour where it is clearly going to take way long to drain, but if I am using my wave and I know that it'll take an additional 10 seconds to drain from the time I am aiming for, I know (from experience) that extraction won't be affected, but if I pull early, I am losing some coffee.. I'm definitely aware its not a big deal, just clarifying."
Coffee,3da2d8,fluffman86,2,Wed Jul 15 02:57:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I never pull out earlythat'swhyIhave3kids! unless I've really screwed up. Removing the dripper early is just one more thing to make a mess. I will do it under 2 conditions though.   I poured way too much water accidentally. Then I let it drain to my preferred amount of brew and remove. I needed to rinse some grounds down off the side wall because it splashed up or I screwed up some other way. In that case, I probably poured too much water on purpose and need to remove the filter early.   Otherwise, I'm doing 30 grams grounds, tare, 50 grams water to bloom (they did a LOT of water to bloom in the video), almost no brew drips through on the bloom, then finish off at 500 grams water and that will fill my 16 oz mug perfectly after losing the trapped water in the grounds."

Coffee,3da2d8,Intrepid510,2,Wed Jul 15 03:26:45 2015 UTC,"To me it seems that you have a bad recipe if you consistently end up using way more water than you allow to pass through. If that were the case, it would make sense to just reduce your water until you have no excess.  Or even better, start a recipe with a brew goal, and create the poured water and coffee weight to give you that output. Want 16oz of brewed coffee and a 17:1 brew ratio? Coffee absorbs about twice its weight, so if you divide 16oz (453g) by 15 (roughly giving you your dose) and multiply that by two and add it to your desired beverage weight you'll get roughly the amount of water you need to pour (~513g). Rough math, but it gets close.  Water costs money and energy (and water) to use, why not make recipes to avoid wasting it."
Coffee,3da2d8,fluffman86,2,Wed Jul 15 07:52:36 2015 UTC,"They are pretty good videos, although I do feel like they are really just aiming for the person who came into their shop loved the coffee and bought X now wants to use it.  If I look at in that vein I think they are great videos that give some extra information like you should be weighing your coffee but if you are not use x spoonfuls. And since these people could be using a whirly blade or those god awful banshee  20mm flat burr grinders, it's good to pull by time. Just think of a chemex clogged with sludge and not draining for 10 minutes! no bueno.  If you have been doing it a while, then it's nice to look at as a reference and see if there is anything you might want to tweak with your own technique. But it's not mind blowing or unconventional stuff."

Or maybe they're just using a really light roast.  Also on the V60, either I have really coarse kosher salt, or else that sounds way too coarse of a grind. I use Morton's Kosher salt in a box, and it's a lot closer to where I grind my French Press.  And just a small thing to me - it seems weird that in the V60 video the barista pours from a Bonavita Gooseneck into a Hario (?) copper gooseneck kettle. Seem superfluous."

What I did was I filtered out the boulders (probably anything larger than 500 microns) from what was supposed to be a grind for drip coffee (melitta style), and then brewed two separate cups at a 1:16 ratio based on the amount of coffee grounds I had. I also decided that I was going to brew the grounds sans boulders through drip and the boulders with a french press.   My results were a bit different than yours; I actually got a more complete tasting cup with the grounds sans boulders that didn't seem super underextracted (a problem I was having), while the french press brew had much of the oils characteristic of a french press, but a very light, tea-like body and no depth of flavor. To me this one tasted like watered down coffee. I'm starting to see the point that Matt Perger has - fines, from my experience, are kind of essential for coffee brewing completeness, and boulders are the ones that cause problems.

My palate is not as refined as yours, but I had the fortune of tasting under/barely roasted coffee one time. That REALLY stuck with me, so any time I even taste a hint of grassy flavors in a coffee it tends to dominate the cup for me. I hadn't thought about using the french press though for the boulders, that probably would have made more sense. I wanted to keep everything as consistent as possible though.   It's really odd though how we all usually want to get away from fines as much as possible, but then we have Matt showing us we're all dumb.

Mehmet Efendi is just a low grade brazilian natural process arabica.

I'd either buy it at a place that offers grinding on demand, or get a turkish coffee hand grinder, they're cheap, reliable, and the burrs are specially designed to allow an extremely fine grind.

I use my Hario Mini at 5 clicks or so, then I dump the grinds into a Mortar and Pessle and mash it up to a powder consistency. Doesn't take long at all and I actually enjoy the hands on experience.

Coffee,3d94k2,PriceZombie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:06:58 2015 UTC,"There will be degredation of flavor. If you keep the grounds in a jar or something that can help keep air out you can slow the process.  Day 14 grounds will not be as good as day 1 grounds, but they will still be very drinkable. If you do grind, will you just be grinding for you?  How many cups do you have throughout the day? If it's just you and you drink one cup it wouldn't be bad to grind. If you are grinding for multiple people several times a day you will not be a happy camper."
Coffee,3dad48,slaucsap,3,Tue Jul 14 19:06:42 2015 UTC,"Health issues - not per se.  Like, it won't have time to go icky before you finish it, assuming it's not camping your fridge for a week or so.    Coffee does degrade at two key points you want to be aware of - oxidization and temperature.    So brewed coffee starts oxidizing and is generally fine for rather a while, but in time those sharps and astringents will come to be pretty noticable.  And once brewed coffee drops below 74c, the degradation of acids accelerates substantially, as chlorogenic acid (responsible for brights, sharps, and citrus-ish) decays into quinic (sharp, bitter) and caffeic (bitter, bitter, astringent) acids.    Both oxidation and CGA breakdown are one-way reactions, and the brew doesn't repair itself by being reheated.  It would be related to ""little more bitter"" very directly, but again, no health consequences beyond basic food safety."

Coffee,3dad48,Anomander,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:37:50 2015 UTC,"what about the de-emulsion of coffee oils when reheated?   You may have lost me a little, though...  Normal brew coffee doesn't really produce oil emulsion, that's one of the more fundamental differences between espresso and brew, that espresso's pressurized extraction both pulls far more oils and produces a beverage where oils, fines, and water are emulsed, and oils, fines, water, and gas emulsed for the crema.    These emulsions don't degrade over temperature AFIK, though they will separate out if left alone for a while, and the trapped gases in the crema will eventually de-emulse into coffee-oil-froth (visible bubbles).  Those emulsions need pressure to form, so wouldn't re-emulse without a similar application of pressure, if at all.    Your coffee should naturally carry some oils in it, less so if you've a paper filtered brew method but still some.   Those weren't emulsed to begin with, and nothing substantial really changes from cold to reheated there.  The oils would heat up, and ""soften"" to a viscosity that may more closely match the water, and be less visibly apparent as a result?  Maybe that's what you're seeing?"

Optional:  These next rules are good if you really want to play it safe, but they're not likely to cause any harm on their own as long as your pressure release valve is functioning properly:   Don't tamp (not heavily, at least). Tapping the side of the basket is usually sufficient to get the air pockets out. Don't use super-fine grinds.  This may lead to your filter getting clogged."

Coffee,3davcr,clockworkdroid133168,6,Tue Jul 14 21:10:37 2015 UTC,"TL;DR You're not gonna get a lot of love or input on here because many of us on here are happy to spend 5-10 minutes weighing beans, dialing in a grinder and using a manual brewing method to get a satisfying and balanced cup. Try a different brew method, it could be fun.  If you've gotta buy coffee at the grocery store, I really don't mind that particular blend. I think you may find that a lot of folk on here purchase whole beans and grind them immediately before brewing. Given that a box of 32 K-cups costs $25 or so, and there is 8-10 grams in each K-cup, which really is optimized for 6-8 oz cups, you're paying roughly $50/lb of coffee. This is what a lot of tourists pay for whole bean Kona FWIW.  If you're okay with this sort of outlay for this chemical dependency that we all know and love, I would suggest diverting some of those funds into a suitable grinder and experimenting with different brewing methods, and the wide world of micro and small scale roasteries out there. You will also be spending less $$ on coffee. There's a lot of love , and rightly so for Stumptown and Intelligentsia on here, but you could spend some time checking out your local options. How's that for a ""clear as mud"" response?"

If you want to use the region on the label, you have to pay an exorbitant amount to certify it.   That is not how Geogrpahical Indicators work, and any trademark filed would be laughably unenforceable.  Trademark would require a new term without precedent of use in common trade already.  This is why both trademark suits and copyright suits are so commonplace - if the term isn't actively defended and becomes part of common parlance, ""your"" right to protect the term is diluted.  The sheer number of roasters out here who are selling those products identified by the farm and origin they came from would render any attempt completely farcical.   You may be thinking of Geographical Indicator, which is like a trademark for a product produced in a location.  Ethiopia has four that I know of, for the regions of Sidamo, Harrar, Yirgacheffe, and Limu.  They don't mean we can't sell our Harrar as ""Harrar"" they just mean we can't sell our Brazil Fazenda as ""Harrar.""  This is the same for instance as sparkling wine, and how only a sparkling wine produced in the Champagne Region of France can be sold as ""Champagne.""   That's why many labels will forgo that because having that 'certified' name doesn't really benefit the farm it comes from.   Do you not believe if benefits the original farm to have their name associated with particularly excellent coffee?  The farms and collectives we deal with certainly do.  The organizations they belong to who have worked to protect those particular terms in those particular ways certainly do as well - it is in the interests of each and every grower from that region to live up to and protect a reputation of quality in order to increase the demand for their crops the following years.    This is using a somewhat slippery pathway of logic associated with Western Fair Trade certifications and then applying them to a context where licencing fees are neither applied nor collected in order to discount or disregard entirely the aims inherent to building brand reignition around high-quality coffee farms.     The entire coffee comes from one place in Ethiopia, but they aren't gonna pay bookoobucks to just get that name on the label. They are a small coffee roaster after all.   They don't need to pay anything and should certainly be more than aware of that.  They're older and bigger than the vast bulk of North American craft roasters, many of whom have very clearly had no problems selling product labelled as a geographically indicated origin.  It's not that everyone else is paying up and Allenn is a strong independant roaster who don't need no trademark, it's that nobody needs to pay shit and Allenn is blowing smoke up your ass if that's why they can't own up to their origin on a single-origin product.     Plus, you can't roast low quality ethiopian beans medium or dark.   Are you kidding?  AFIK that's how most folks ""use up"" a bad lot - because it doesn't need to be ""highest quality"" when you're roasting dark because so much more of the flavours are coming from the process rather than the bean at that point that a particularly nuanced green is unnecessary.  Even medium is a really solid way to correct for a light bean that may carry some undesirable characteristics, as the heavier roast notes can balance out some of the effervescence and sharpness that's typical."

Coffee,3d9kdv,centech,3,Tue Jul 14 22:21:32 2015 UTC,"Protected Designation of Origin   They're actually different!    A Protected Designation of Origin is for foodstuffs & beverages that are all three of produced, processed, and prepared in the named locale, with that locale providing accepted distinction of some sort.  A Geographical Indication is for foodstuffs and beverages that at least one of of produced, processed, and prepared produced in a given locale, with that locale providing accepted distinction of some sort.    Champagne is absolutely (or at least almost absolutely, I don't know their legal specifics) a PDoO because it's grown, picked and processed, then fremented, casked, and finally bottled in the Champagne region.  In coffee's case, because we're buying coffee that is particularly notable for having originated from the Harrar region of Ethiopia and that coffee has also been processed in the Harrar region, but we are roasting (preparing) it in Canada, we cannot badge it as PDoO, but it is absolutely Geographically Indicated Harrar because we're as proud of the Harrar as they are.    So if you buy coffee that was entirely farmed, processed, and roasted in Ethiopia, that would be PDoO coffee, but it's exceptionally rare because it's mostly tourist shit coming back with someone's gran and gramps and there's way too many costs associated with delivering quality PDoO coffees to Western markets, especially keeping in mind that if it can't be delivered fresh, there's no point in shipping the good stuff anyway.

Coffee,3d98is,FoodeatFood,3,Tue Jul 14 14:20:35 2015 UTC,What everyone has failed to mention - with espresso you're always trying to hit a moving target so you're constantly adjusting the grind for both the type and age of bean. If you keep making major adjustments back and forth from brew grind to espresso grind you're going to drive yourself insane while wasting a considerable amount of coffee (sinks shots). It's recommended to have a dedicated grinder for espresso.
Coffee,3d98is,SonVoltMMA,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:17:56 2015 UTC,"Not entirely true. While you will need to change grind size for those variables, it doesn't really take much effort to have a single grinder. I use a single grinder, and it is very consistent if I put the dial to the same place each time. So long as you aren't working the worm gear of a dedicated espresso grinder (or collar adjustment, or whatever very precise adjustment device it has) you can dial between grind sizes very quickly.  It also saves you a lot of money to only have one grinder. Or it can get you something of better quality in the same budget. Plus, dedicated espresso grinders (until very recently) have been made with the ""brick and mortar"" myth incorporated into their design. They make a grind size that is less modal than grinders that are intended for regular use (in general, at the same price range). This means worse tasting coffee.   I would recommend against having a grinder for espresso. Unless money is not an object, or you have tight time constraints between coffees."
Coffee,3d98is,poorover,2,Wed Jul 15 06:58:47 2015 UTC,"The Rocky was a good choice 5 years ago, Baratza has really shaken up the market with excellent grinders at great prices, especially for grinders that can do both brew and espresso.  The Preciso is probably the cheapest grinder that can do a good job grinding for espresso, and is a good choice at that price. The Vario on the other hand is an excellent grinder at twice the price, it regularly gets compared to much more expensive grinders in terms of grind quality and is leaps and bounds ahead of many commercial grinders in terms of usability.  I'd say, buy the best grinder your budget will allow."
Coffee,3d98is,newdefinition,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:43:01 2015 UTC,"That was kind of my thought process, but people say to use the Vario for espresso only. Do you think that switching grind settings would be too much of a hassle?"
Coffee,3d98is,newdefinition,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:49:28 2015 UTC,"I've only used a friend's Vario for brew occasionally, but it seems really straight forward. There's a ""macro"" and a ""micro"" adjustment. You set the macro adjustment for the brew method (french press, drip, espresso, etc.) and then you can use the micro adjustment to adjust for the exact right grind for espresso. Switching back and forth seems easy (of course I don't have a ton of hands on experience, but it seems to work well)."

Coffee,3d98is,_Sigma,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:10:42 2015 UTC,"I've been using a vario for mostly espresso for about nine months and every time I've tried to switch the grind for a pour over it messes up my espresso setting and annoys me and makes me want to buy an encore just for pour overs. Luckily I rarely do a pour over so I'm fine with just the vario. If you're going to be switching between the two regularly you really need two grinders. Any grinder you use for espresso should really be dedicated to espresso, whether that's a rocky or vario or super jolly."
Coffee,3d98is,CoffeeMechanic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:07:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. I drink a lot of pour over now, but that's because I don't have my espresso machine yet.... Once I do if I want a ""regular"" coffee I could also just make americanos."

Coffee,3d98is,westcoastroasting,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:17:21 2015 UTC,"I posted about my experiences with the preciso for espresso yesterday.  I have not personally used the vario, but given my experiences with the Preciso, I would go with the Vario for dedicated espresso. /u/newdefinition is right: the Vario is frequently compared to the top commercial grinders. Given how good the Preciso is at espresso, I don't think you'd be unhappy with the Vario. Especially the new Vario with the Forte's metal portafilter holder."

Coffee,3d98is,sawyersutton,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:40:59 2015 UTC,"I think people usually recommend getting the best grinder you can afford.  So if you can swing it, the Vario will probably be the best choice."
Coffee,3d91ur,HawkeyeNation,6,Tue Jul 14 13:23:59 2015 UTC,If ease of cleanup is crucial then aeropress all the way. Cleaning up is the most simple process: you push out the puck and filter into the trash.   Lots of people enjoy the aeropress as part of a work set up and it makes a delicious cup of coffee.
Coffee,3d91ur,FoodeatFood,3,Tue Jul 14 14:38:59 2015 UTC,"Aero press! So much quicker, easier to clean and lots of techniques you can experiment win to keep it interesting."
Coffee,3d91ur,skippgil,2,Tue Jul 14 14:41:47 2015 UTC,"For a work/ office environment, I definitely agree with the Aeropress love. However, I actually prefer the cups that I get from my French press to my Aeropress. That being said, I have both of them. If you brew differently at home, assuming you're not going to transport the Aeropress to and from, I say go for it. If you're going to commute with the brewing device, maybe buy another single cup French Press."
Coffee,3d91ur,GodspeedSelf,2,Tue Jul 14 14:58:42 2015 UTC,"I have both, and while I prefer the flavor I get from the French Press, the cleanup for the Aeropress is impossible to beat. It can be a real hassle digging into the cup and disposing of the beans. With the Aeropress you just give it a push and the beans eject themselves into the trash can.   I'm looking into getting a metal screen filter for the Aeropress in hopes the taste will mimic that of a French press."
Coffee,3d91ur,thethisthis,2,Tue Jul 14 15:40:54 2015 UTC,"I would recommend an Aeropress as it would be the easiest method to clean and seems to be in everyone's office set up, mine included.   It also as the added benefit of being able to adjust your recipe in countless ways, want a short brew time with a fine grind go for it, prefer a longer brew time more akin to a french press, you got it just."
Coffee,3d91ur,Somerandomlog,2,Tue Jul 14 15:50:03 2015 UTC,"Aeropress is a great option. Something else to consider is buying some reusable filters. Want something closer to a FP type brew, use a mesh screen. Want something closer to the aeropress paper filters (but dont' want to use paper) use a steel disc with micro-holes in it.  AP is super easy to clean. Just some paper towel to wipe everything down, and a good wash everyone once in a while.   What do you have at your disposal for grinding your beans? Many people will have different opinions on optimal grind for AP, but I prefer a very fine grind. If you need to change up your grinder set up then you might be looking at a bit more money than just replacing the Bodum, and sticking with the budum might be your best option."

This is what I do, and I enjoy several cups of awesome coffee every day. When I want an espresso, as a treat, I go to the coffee shop. Their grinder + machine is probably worth upwards of $20K and they are the ones who have to pull blank shots to heat it up, dial in the grind (wasting beans in the process), maintain the machine when it breaks, and clean it at the end of the day. I used to own a nice Gaggia machine, and the day I sold it, realizing that good espresso wasn't doable on my financial/time budget, was the best day of my coffee drinking life."

Look up permitting procedures for selling foodstuffs in your jurisdiction. You'll likely need a personal FoodSafe certification and the use of an inspected and certified kitchen.
Coffee,3dbccs,kallisti_gold,2,Tue Jul 14 23:21:40 2015 UTC,"Is anyone familiar with the legalities of starting an operation like this?   Pretty much everywhere, ""scale"" is not a determining factor in local food safety ordinance, so you would need to cater most specifically to your region's regulations for food & beverage preparation & packaging.  Because your product would neither be fermented nor distilled, your regulations are different but similar to local breweries or the like (I mention this 'cause I know a guy who followed local brewery regs 'cause he thought that they were all beverage production, regs are actually different esp. regarding sealing & sterility; you may even need pasteurization).    If the local folks are unfamiliar with cold brew, it's best compared to unsweetened iced tea at a regulatory level.    When you're doing this, it's also worth checking if regs are different in any of your near- and mid-term planned markets - if you want to expand to statewide, or America-wide, there may be additional or different regulations you would need to adhere to.  If so check costing out for equipment against needing to halt production and change hardware and process if you need a substantial upgrade down the road."

I don't think it really matters all that much what ratio you use -- you're using the recommended ratio for the Toddy Brew, but it's more just a question of how concentrated you like your cold brew and whether or not you plan to cut it with more water after the fact."

Coffee,3d6ez9,Shteevie,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:24:44 2015 UTC,"Whenever anything tastes too weak, you wanna use more of the base and less of the water in combination. Or just more of the base and the same amount of water.  I have a 64 ounce pitcher, and I add 6 1/3 cups of coffee and then fill the pitcher with nice filtered cold water. Stir it up some more so you got room to add more water. Then top it off to 64 ounces (You can eyeball this).  I let mine steep for at least 24 hours. 20 Hours is okayish, but a good 24 hours is solid. Don't do it any less, this really matters. It's cold water, the coffee needs to be fully extracted. Don't hesitate to pull it out and stir it every like 6-8 hours.  This is when I strain it with a french press once, and then run it through a paper filter. You're not really extracting any oils to begin with since it's a cold extract, so it's not bad to use a paper filter.  End result, you get a super concentrated and really smooth cold extract. Dilute it with 2/3's of milk or water (whatever you're in the mood for), and add some ice.. If you have a sweet tooth at the moment, I find that adding some agave syrup to the iced coffee diluted with milk is really yummy.   But honestly, it's so good when the coffee is straight too. I always drink this over ice, but you can heat up the cold brew if you'd like.  This is what I do every time, and it tastes so damn GOOD."
Coffee,3d6ez9,Foxtrot56,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:30:24 2015 UTC,"You are using about half of the coffee that you want to be using. There is definitely a difference between making a coffee concentrate and adding water [which is what most cold brews aim for], than aiming for the final volume during brewing.  The toddy ratio is 12 oz of medium-grind coffee to 56 ounces of water for 12 hours. The whole operation looks more like really wet mud while brewing, rather than a lot of water with grounds in the bottom. Adding the coffee and water in stages rather than all at once also help make sure that everything gets wet without lots of agitation.  Third, depending on how you decanted it, you might have been pouring the weakest part of the brew off the top and tossing the oil and more heavily-concentrated part of the brew out with the grounds. It's important to strain the whole lot through the grounds at the end rather than pouring it out and chucking the grounds at the bottom.  tl;dr: -More coffee: 12oz coffee per 56 fl oz water -Add coffee and water in stages; look for 'wet mud' consistency -12 hours brew should be enough -Strain all liquid through the grounds to get the good stuff Better luck next time!"
Coffee,3d8kn6,Silvire,2,Tue Jul 14 10:11:06 2015 UTC,"The only downside is that a larger french press will act as a bit of a heat sink if it isn't pre-heated and you're only brewing a small amount.

I find that it's more useful than not and there are no issues with using the press at under capacity. One thing to keep in mind is that because the plunger leaves space at the bottom you will not be placing as much force into the grounds when plunging a smaller batch as opposed to when you use 3x the amount of grounds for a whole batch.

Coffee,3d6hdf,jocamero,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:50:15 2015 UTC,"Here are the steps to a successful nitro coffee experience (short version): 1. Select and brew a coffee that tastes good to you (cold brew or hot brewed - chilled) 2. Keg that coffee in a clean keg an put under approximately 40PSI of 100% nitrogen gas pressure, leaving at least a 15% air gap in the keg so that there's room for nitrogen gas in there.  Force the oxygen out of the keg through the pressure release valve (corny keg) 3.  If you like more cascade, shake the keg back and forth for a good minute. 4.  plug in to your tower and pull the nitro.  IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT YOU USE A STOUT TAP--NOT A DRAFT TAP TO PULL NITRO  A stout tap contains a flow restrictor plate that causes the nitrogen gas to infuse itself within the coffee.  Without it, you won't have the cascade effect in your nitro.  Good luck!  www.nitroconditionedcoffee.com"
Coffee,3d6hdf,Fapcam,2,Tue Jul 14 15:00:39 2015 UTC,"While a stout tap does contain a restrictor plate, it actually does the opposite and causes the nitrogen (and CO2 if using beer gas) to come out of solution.   A stout tap contains a flow restrictor plate that causes the nitrogen gas to infuse itself within the coffee."

Coffee,3d6hdf,Donkeywad,2,Tue Jul 14 04:31:16 2015 UTC,"I've never seen it come out with any kind of head at all. Even just pushing it out with nitrogen wouldn't seem to do much since it needs to be mixed and doesn't necessarily get mixed that way. Filling growlers is cool but since the nitro separates from the liquid you're going to end up taking home a growlers of cold brew. That said, I have had nitro cold brew and it does seem to have that sort of creamy texture that nitro beer has. Not as obvious but I noticed it, or maybe it was just in my head. I also have experience with home set ups as well as experience in a brewery and restaurant with draft systems so I'm not completely making this all up, I promise."
Coffee,3d6hdf,frankgotthegirl,3,Tue Jul 14 00:05:22 2015 UTC,"There's a key difference between nitro cold brew and nitro beer: cold brew uses just nitrogen, which is not very soluble in water, so the coffee doesn't feel bubbly and carbonated, just creamy. Beer, on the other hand, uses a specific mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen, so you get some carbonation and some creaminess."

I worked with a local home brew store to build a mobile 3-tap system that I can use at events. Beveragefactory.com is where I got a stout faucet as well, just to replace one so I have options when serving.   I have yet to find any info on how long coffee would need to be in a primed keg with nitrogen before it would start to incorporate? I know that nitrogen wouldn't actually mix with the coffee. I don't think it's a necessary step but I thought it would be interesting if you know. I also could be using the wrong terminology for a couple things."

The major points I would recommend you follow are:   Only use a nitro faucet tap. Regular taps won't dispense the PSI you're probably shooting for and also won't give you that nitro head Make sure you use a Corny Keg (soda keg) and not a regular one used for most commercial brewing. The Corny can be either a ball lock or pin lock, but stick to one since the hookups need to match Get a fridge large enough to hold the Corny keg but one that doesn't have coils or anything else on top of the inside since you'll want to cut a hole through the top Use stainless steel for everything since the acidity of coffee will eventually wear down anything else   Other than that, just do some research and you'll find plenty of DIY articles. Good luck and happy cold brewing!"
Coffee,3d6hdf,shawnthegrom,2,Mon Jul 13 23:24:45 2015 UTC,"Avid home brewer (beer) here and for a beginner I definitely don't suggest making your own kegerator / coffee dispenser.  I would suggest Beverage Factory's Javarator.  I have one of their triple tap kegerators for beer and it has worked great for over a year.  The model I linked to hold three kegs and the nitro bottle, has wheels, and you can set the temperature digitally.  While it doesn't have a PID, I can confirm with my own tests the temperature swing is +/- 1ºF."

Coffee,3d6hdf,TheOutlawJoseyWales,3,Tue Jul 14 00:15:36 2015 UTC,look into something called a jockey box.  I think you can use those with nitro taps.
Coffee,3d6hdf,jocamero,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:33:11 2015 UTC,"Yep, you can.  All the jockey box does is basically hold a 50-100 foot line of coiled stainless steel or copper tubing that you put ice on top of."
Coffee,3d6hdf,jocamero,2,Tue Jul 14 03:48:57 2015 UTC,"Depending on your definition of portable, the dorm sized fridge linked above might be considered portable.  It does come with wheels and would likely stay cold for several hours after disconnected from AC.  If a generator or extension cord were available I would think this would be ideal.  Otherwise, as /u/TheOutlawJoseyWales stated a Jockey Box is a great idea, otherwise a less expensive option would just be an ice blanket + neoprene keg insulator and connect the keg to a nitro source and dispense with a tap.  Sorry for all the beverage factory links.  I don't work for them, just a happy customer, and their prices are pretty good."
Coffee,3d6hdf,piles_of_it,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:57:05 2015 UTC,Get a 2 gal keg and stick it in a cooler full of ice. Drill a hole in the side and mount your tap there. Get a 6 cubic foot tank and that'll fit in there with it.

Coffee,3d6hdf,shawnthegrom,2,Mon Jul 13 23:35:48 2015 UTC,Pure nitrogen at 35 PSI. The beergas blend you're using does give more body and cascading but I've found the same results with off flavors from the CO2.
Coffee,3d6hdf,piles_of_it,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:07:07 2015 UTC,"Why only a corny keg? Stick with ball lock if going that route and replace all the gaskets to get rid of the coke smell.   Can use plastic, beer is more acidic than cold brewed coffee hence the need for refrigeration. Stainless is just easier to clean and looks cooler/lasts longer."
Coffee,3d6hdf,jocamero,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:37:16 2015 UTC,Corny kegs (aka pin lock and ball lock) kegs are all functionally the same except for the inlet/outlet fittings.  You can purchase either new in stainless steel to eliminate the potential for previous soda flavors.  http://www.cornykeg.com/resources/corny-keg-tips/cornelius-kegs-pin-lock-ball-lock/  There's a video on that page that explains the difference in detail.

Coffee,3d6hdf,jocamero,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:37:28 2015 UTC,I prefer ball lock kegs as well due to the size (so I can fit 3 in my kegerator) and plus they typically have a bleed valve that can be manually enabled.

Coffee,3d6hdf,jocamero,2,Mon Jul 13 23:27:35 2015 UTC,/u/KFBass is a professional brewer and has chimed in on previous discussions of nitro coffee; hoping they will join this discussion again.
Coffee,3d6hdf,KFBass,4,Tue Jul 14 04:20:27 2015 UTC,"yeah not much more to say, as everyone seems to have it correct.  Nitrogen is barely soluble in water at the temps and pressures we are talking about. It is used to push the coffee/beer through a stout faucet which has a small plate in it with tiny holes. As it goes through these holes it knocks out any remaining co2 (if using beer gas, or pushing carbonated beer) and you get that nice cascading effect.  So using pure n2 would be best for coffee, because you dont want carbonated coffee. You are basically just pushing it with n2 and serving it through a stout faucet. It's not going to matter much what psi you push it since it's pure n2 and not really going anywhere, just balance the system so it pours cleanly and fast.  I havn't had much luck with head retention on coffee yet. I've been considering steeping some malt in it or something to give it a little protein for the head retention."
Coffee,3d6hdf,jocamero,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:43:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info!  Cheers!  I would appreciate it if you share your future experience with head retention.  I finally have an empty corny keg so I'll have to give nitro cold brew another shot.
Coffee,3d6hdf,cultr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:02:59 2015 UTC,"We went through this, adding emulsifiers and protein-based sweetners and the like. It's a fun avenue to explore with very interesting results, BUT, it does take away from the purity of the coffee itself.   Here's our cascade with 100% pure coffee and nitro. This cascade maintains over at least two days (the longest we've had a keg last). I'm working on a write-up to help anyone interested in doing this themselves. It's a lot of effort to do it right, but the results are incredible. We sold 5 gallons in 4 hours at our local Farmer's market in the tiny town which we are located."
Coffee,3d6hdf,KFBass,3,Tue Jul 14 18:49:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah we get a solid cascade no problem, just no foam on top. The idea was to try and make it have a nice head similar to a crema. I don't think its possible with that setup without adding something to it."

Carbonating your coffee makes it bitter. The nitro effect people go on about is from using a stout tap which basically aerates it while pouring, the cascade effect will release a bit of smell but if you let it sit a few minutes taste is the same. It looks cool and you can charge more for it.   Make sure you get a nitro regulator and nitro tank. Go to a medical gas place to fill with 100% nitro. I push it at 5 psi."
Coffee,3d6hdf,jocamero,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:31:26 2015 UTC,"Nitro and CO2 regulators and tanks are functionally basically the same (I have both style of tanks and regulators).  The only real difference is the valve.  There are minor differences with safety relief valve pressures, and max pressure of the cylinders.  My local gas suppler will fill either tank with nitro, CO2 or beer gas.  Also, why are you only pushing at 5 psi with a stout faucet?  I would think the coffee would barely come out at that pressure.  ≥30 psi would seem more ideal to me.   Make sure you get a nitro regulator and nitro tank.

Americano is espresso in a mug, then filled up with hot water. Etc.

Coffee,3d8d1i,GodspeedSelf,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:54:17 2015 UTC,"The espresso is poured on top of the water to maintain its crema.  The crema holds most of the aroma and a good bit of flavour - Its just tiny bubbles from the extraction process which is why it dissipates over time.  If the water went in after the espresso you would loose lots of the crema before you could taste it. We serve both long back and americano in  my shop, the long black is an espresso with a small amount of hot water, and americano is a much larger drink with more water - just depends on how strong you like it."
Coffee,3d8d1i,grindhouse_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:07:42 2015 UTC,"So essentially, a long black is a stronger Americano due to less water. Do you pull the shot over the water for both?"

For my taste, it brings out a bit more body in the end result.  I also do a second steep of the same grounds for smaller batches but only use 1/2 the amount of water."
Coffee,3d4yv8,Spankmeister88,3,Mon Jul 13 18:44:59 2015 UTC,"After about 36 hours it basically doesn't taste any different from my experience at room temperature. Cooler temperatures slow down the steeping process so it is easier to get the exact taste that you like. Something to keep in mind is that acids come out first. Then everything else. Then bitterness. It is hard to say when it starts over extracting because it depends on the coffee, grind size, and how you want the coffee to taste."

Coffee,3d4yv8,Howitworks,3,Mon Jul 13 21:14:32 2015 UTC,"I have made cold brew in several different ratios.  Cold brew is tricky as when you go up in water volume, you also go down in coffee.  The smallest batches I have made (and turned out fantastic) is 1lb coffee to 8 cups (.5 gal) of room temperature water.  This was made in the Filtron device and double filtered to produce a rich, nutty, almost chocolatey cold brew that is delicious diluted or straight.    I have also experimented with larger batches.  The largest batch I have made so far that also turned out wonderful is 5lbs coffee to 5 gallons of water.  Pretty much the same brew as the smaller batch.  So, as you can see, the ratio differs as you scale up production.  If we were to use the same ratio for the large batch as the smaller one (1lb/.5gal), then we would use 10lbs of coffee for the 5 gallons of water!  I have not tried that, but the 5lbs of coffee for 5 gallons of water results in the same brew as the smaller batch.  Now that we have two data points, we could probably extrapolate the line ratio of coffee/water, but I have not done so yet.  I only use distilled water or at the least, pure spring water for my cold brew as well.  I drink the water out of my tap, but it is chlorinated and I have noticed in larger batches that I can taste the difference.  I have not tested the refrigerated/room temp methods.  This is because I don't have a fridge large enough for the 5 gallon buckets I make my batches in (but may be moving to a commercial kitchen to bottle and sell my cold brew soon, so I may test that out) so my cold brew so far has been 18 hours in the 75-78 temp range.  Lastly, I always double filter my cold brew (cloth and paper) to remove any silt or sludge from the brew itself.  I have had bottles in my fridge for upwards of a month with only minor settling.  Hope this helps!"
Coffee,3d4yv8,Spankmeister88,5,Mon Jul 13 18:37:33 2015 UTC,"Why would you ever change the ratio? IMO, this does not pass common-sense; the coffee doesn't ""know"" if it's a 1 gallon container of water filled with 1 lb of grounds, or 1 cup with 1 oz grounds - the proportions are identical.  FWIW, I have recently been using 2 cups coffee to 1 gal water based on a recommendation, and it's turning out well for 12 hours of brewing time. I'm not sure what mass of grounds 2 cups is, but it's a lot less than the 1/2 lb coffee I have used with 1 gal in the past (result was more like a concentrate)."
Coffee,3d4yv8,mtnspirit,3,Mon Jul 13 19:33:36 2015 UTC,"I did a lot of research on scaling up cold brew production.  The Toddy company has a 5 gallon cold brew maker and in their instruction video, they said to put 5lbs of coffee in for 5 gallons of water.  I also read interviews and watched several hangouts that had folks from larger cold brew makers (Chameleon Cold Brew for one) and they also said that as you scale up the batches, you don't need as much coffee to achieve the same results.  I have done taste tests for my family/friends as well as myself on batches I have done with 1lb/.5 gallon batches and 5lb/5gallon batches and everyone that has tasted them say they are just about identical.  I use the same beans, same grind, and same steeping time for both.  I don't know the chemistry for this and if I had not done the research, I would have used 10lbs of coffee for that 5 gallons, all I know is that it comes out pretty much the same...:)"
Coffee,3d4yv8,Spankmeister88,2,Mon Jul 13 19:45:33 2015 UTC,"And maybe that's what's going on here: you get a similar taste result for wildly different ratios. Taste is potentially imprecise and everything points to that being the case here.  My guess is you could easily be using HALF as much coffee as you are (depending on whether you're diluting a concentrate or not).  EDIT: Time / temperature of brewing and filtration quality are going to have a large effect on the flavor. I'm brewing at room temp (which right now is ~77 degrees F). Brew time has decreased from 24h to 12h since I started doing this. Some people take the ""cold"" part of ""cold brew"" literally and brew in the fridge. I haven't tried this yet, but I may. Chemistry + common sense would suggest that this should require more grounds, more brew time, or some combination.  My filtration methods used to leave a lot of the super-fine grounds in the resulting brew, but now I filter in 3 steps to get just about everything out. First step is a fine-mesh strainer, 2nd is cheesecloth (in the strainer) or a reusable coffee filter, 3rd step is commercial-sized coffee filters (also in the strainer)."
Coffee,3d4yv8,mtnspirit,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:52:51 2015 UTC,"Yup.  Since I had started out with the smaller batches, I had been ready to go the 10lbs for the larger batch but in researching brewing techniques for the larger batches, came across the 5lb amount (that was reiterated by several unrelated sources).  Bean, roast, grind, time, temp, ratio...they all play a part!"
Coffee,3d4yv8,Spankmeister88,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:01:18 2015 UTC,Try getting big fine mesh hop bags. Works great and cuts way down on cleanup and silt.
Coffee,3d4yv8,piles_of_it,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:56:15 2015 UTC,"None of this really follows a logical train of thought. Changing the brew ratio should only alter the final strength of the coffee, assuming you are achieving a similar extraction yield. A 1 lb/0.5 gal batch should be twice as strong as a 5 lb/5 gal batch or else you are not extracting the same amount of coffee solids, which points to an issue with grind size, agitation, brew time, etc. However, it is pretty hard to seriously underextract cold brew since much of the extraction happens very quickly. If your informal taste panel couldn't tell the difference between two samples of wildly differing strengths then it is most likely an issue with lack of blinding: unblinded taste tests are notoriously unreliable to the point of being useless.   Immersion brewing is very simple and scales extremely well from tiny press pots to barrels of coffee. The real reason large commercial cold brew outfits don't produce concentrate at your ~1:4 ratio is because at that strength the brewed yield from a fixed amount of coffee drops dramatically due to the grounds retaining so much of the brewed coffee concentrate. 1:8 is a far more commercial viable option to produce a double strength coffee that can be diluted with ice and milk while only losing 20% of the yield rather than 40%."
Coffee,3d4yv8,bob_mcbob,2,Mon Jul 13 21:32:23 2015 UTC,"Can confirm. Currently producing 60-80 gallons a week scaling to 150 by 8/1. You can't fit 5 gallons of water in a 5 gallon bucket with 5 lbs of coffee in there. We do 3 lbs and 3.25 gallons of water. The grounds suck up the .25 and we're left with 3 gallons of concentrate. Sucks doing 10 bucket batches. About to invest in some tanks, hopefully ratio doesn't change when we go to 100 lbs at a clip."

Many places use this for espresso.  So a fine graind is going to extract faster than a coarse grind.
Coffee,3d4yv8,Spankmeister88,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:11:12 2015 UTC,Yes I use the vacuum block. I really like the coffee concentrate that it produces since my experiments with iced coffee end up being too watered down and weak.

Also a darker roast is going to give you a much richer cup than a light roast.  The Cafe Bustelo that the article uses is ground very fine, finer than I usually grind my cold brew coffee.  I would also recommend filtering through a paper filter as well as a cloth filter to make sure you don't get any super-fines into your cold brew.  Regarding stirring, I add all my coffee, then put in around 4 cups, stir around to make sure that all the grounds are saturated and then add the rest of the coffee.

My filtration method has changed and this seems to be working very well:   Start with a fine mesh strainer (stainless) to get the coarse grounds filter a second time (into original vessel) with several layers of cheesecloth or a reusable plastic mesh coffee filter finally, a large / commercial paper coffee filter as the last step to get the really fine stuff   In my last few batches (all 1 gallon), I have gone from using 1/2 lb to using ~2 cups. Results are pretty similar, but it's an ongoing refinement. My experimentation would suggest that people are using more coffee than they really need to.

I know I'm biased, but it is the actual best. So we make our coffee in big batches, but the ratio will be the same. So first thing is we make our cold brew as a concentrate--I brew the coffee, then when it is done brewing i add equal parts concentrate. The ratio of coffee to water I use is 1:1.17. Again, it's in a batch, but I use four pounds of freshly ground coffee, then add 3 gallons of water. I brew this for about 12 hours, filter the coffee, and measure how much comes out--it usually produces about 1.5 gallons of concentrate, so I add 1.5 gallons of water. Refrigerate, and it's good for a few weeks."
Coffee,3d4yv8,Baristaabby,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:22:18 2015 UTC,"I was initially horrified at the amount of coffee you're using, then realized you dilute 2:1 in the end. It's still a lot compared to what I'm making, but less than I thought.  For comparison, you're using about 12 oz coffee to 1 gallon water (after dilution); I used to use 8 oz for the same amount and have since reduced it by half or so. Lately I've been lazy and measuring coffee by volume (2 cups). It's imprecise, so I may go back to weight in the next batch."
Coffee,3d4yv8,Generic_Username0,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:57:48 2015 UTC,"It is a low ratio, and a lot of coffee to use, even for cold brew, but I've found that with the particular blend I've been using, it works out so well. It's the best cold brew I've ever had."
Coffee,3d4yv8,Generic_Username0,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:11:40 2015 UTC,"4 lbs coffee to 3 US gallons water is something like 1:6.25, not 1:1.17. You should be getting far more than 1.5 gallons of concentrate out of that batch."

Coffee,3d5pgu,Keep_Scrolling,7,Mon Jul 13 18:57:18 2015 UTC,"If you have it set to the finest possible grind on the finest poossible setting on your grinder, and you're not only failing to choke the macine but instead pulling far too fast ... Either your grinder is off-calibration or you're channeling.    Check either your manual or the manufacturer's website for information about calibration, contact them if there seems to be a problem; you should be able to roughly tell if you're getting espresso fineness if you're familiar with ground espresso eslsewhere, if not it can be hard to tell.    If you don't think it's the grinder, or at least the grinder seems properly calibrated and dispensing the correct particle size - channeling.    You're providing too much resistance to flow, and the backing up and excess pressure are blowing through weak points in your puck; despite the fineness you're getting a much too fast flow and overextracting the shit outta one tiny patch of your puck while barely touching the rest of it.    What does the top of your puck look like when you take it off the machine? If its' level its no guarantee, but if there's a notable divot or soupyness, it's a good sign of channeling."
Coffee,3d5pgu,Anomander,2,Mon Jul 13 19:15:00 2015 UTC,"holy shit. yes. The puck is quite soupy, and is a bit of a mountain range instead of the flatness it should be.   This would explain EVERYTHING. I knew about channeling, but I didn't think it was happening because watching the extraction stream from the bottomless portafilter didn't give any telltale signs.   What other clues are there for channeling?"
Coffee,3d5pgu,Anomander,3,Mon Jul 13 20:04:12 2015 UTC,"Try backing off on grind and seeing if you can tag a drier puck as an end result while edging a little closer to ideal time/volume dispensed.  Your rig - and all Gaggia entry models - has a fairly narrow ""ideal"" range but an absolutely manageable one.  I have a Pure, which is a model or two down from yours, at home that ... well, it ain't a commercial machine - but does great espresso when I get the grind right.    You're probably not exactly getting channeling, in the strictest definition.  If it doesn't look like channeling on a bottomless portafilter, something similar but a little more complex is occurring.   At least, probably.  Here I gotta get a little speculative 'cause I cannot figure out how to measure these things but I've seen this prior on other machines.    The obvious portions you know as well as I - shot runs way too much too fast, way more water trapped in the puck than desirable, and a heavily disturbed puck surface.  The top half (1/4, 3/4, etc) is of your puck is being disturbed by the introduction of water, breaking up the puck and going soup; as this happens it stops particpating in resisting the fluid and instead becomes part of the fluid - but the bottom portion is still firmly pressed into the bottom of the basket and is held there by both soup and water.  So on the bottomless, there's no stand-out thin or fast spots, because the bottom layer is even, the whole puck is simply providing substantially less resistance than expected because the portion of your coffee acting as ""puck"" is not actually all of the coffee you have in the basket.  I've found that on tapping-out, the puck often has a drier bottom or even a bottom portion stuck to the basket while the soup flows out freely.    You'll probably want to head coarser on your grind, but also reduce your dose to allow more clearance within the portafilter / brew head.  Ideally, you don't want your screen and your coffee to be in contact before you're started infusion (often the swelling of the coffee during extraction will cause it to reach the screen but even this is undesirable)."
Coffee,3d5pgu,AtlasAirborne,2,Mon Jul 13 20:43:19 2015 UTC,"I think you're completely right. I just did another shot. 5 seconds in and the extraction emerges from the nude porta'. But it's not normal - its actually really slow and gnarly... which could be because its having such a hard time coming through, its compressing above the puck. Then, there's a huge shift and it all comes out super swift and thick. Maybe the shift is caused by what you're describing, a portion of the puck is blowing up and becoming part of the soup, and suddenly there's a softer puck that the huge pressure can escape through.  even more evidence is the shower screen is dirty with coffee - that's not being caused by an overdose."
Coffee,3d5pgu,Anomander,3,Mon Jul 13 21:02:17 2015 UTC,"Given what OP has said, I suspect that reducing dose is the absolute last thing he'd want to do (hear me out).  If he's using ultra-fresh beans, they're probably lightly roasted and therefore dense.  This would require updosing to get within the ""workable"" range of puck volume/thickness, and IME this goes double triple for VSTs.  If you drop the dose such that the puck is relatively thin/there's a decent amount of space, it's nigh-on impossible to get an even extraction (IMHE).  There's no way 18g of light-roasted beans are hitting the screen in an 18g VST in a Classic.  As a result, I'd suggest OP prepares a puck, chucks a penny/similar on top, locks/unlocks the PF, and if it's not pushed into the puck, starts by updosing to 19g, checks for puck integrity and, if the pour becomes too slow, backs the grind out.  Just my 2c"
Coffee,3d5pgu,AtlasAirborne,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:13:01 2015 UTC,"Puck ""thickness"" or total mass is a compounding relationship with grind size in its effects on extraction / pull rate.  It can be very tempting to cheat out by simply updosing in all scenarios because a higher throw will flow slower without any changes to grind size, and small changes to grind size are more impactful over a larger puck as opposed to less so on a smaller one.    But much like the 14-bar boiler - it helps in a very narrow range of circumstances while making the ""success"" range narrower at the expense of greater likehood of utter failure.    Admittedly, under no circumstances do you want ""a lot"" of space, especially on a gaggia; room for water to pool and swirl above the puck is as bad or worse for shot performance than what OP is getting now.     If you drop the dose such that the puck is relatively thin/there's a decent amount of space, it's nigh-on impossible to get an even extraction (IMHE).   What I find here is that it's somewhat harder to get a perfectly even extraction, but much less likely to cause a catastrophic failure like channeling or backup.  Harder to get ideal results, easier to not get a disaster.  You may be dropping yours overmuch if you find this split is too exaggerated.  There should be a range of accessible tuning where a balance point between the two extremes sits."
Coffee,3d5pgu,Anomander,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:06:16 2015 UTC,"But OP is already grinding as finely as possible, with a grinder that should be more than capable of choking the machine.  He's likely using dense beans, so I'd still argue that he's likely to be underdosing if anything, and this is likely to exacerbate any issues he's having with channelling, especially since he's using a basket that, more than any other, relies on the puck for flow regulation."
Coffee,3d5pgu,unawino,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:00:06 2015 UTC,"But OP is already grinding as finely as possible, with a grinder that should be more than capable of choking the machine.   I also recommended backing off on that, though.    Channeling isn't a response to a too-coarse grind; it is, essentially, choking the machine except that the puck isn't consistent enough in its structure to hold back the water.  The puck is already showing it's providing more than adequate resistance by forcing a backup-and-release scenario.  Remember, gaggia entry line doesn't even have a three way, so you can't choke it like you would a commercial - on a commercial or semi-pro if your puck hasn't given way by the time the three way engages, you've ""choked"" it, on entry machines that pressure generally camps until it blows through.    The response to channeling shouldn't be to try and get a more solid, more resilient puck, but to back off on sum resistance until the water can penetrate the puck evenly at the appropriate rate and there's no backup or accumulation of undesirable pressure."
Coffee,3d5pgu,bikemowman,6,Wed Jul 15 00:38:56 2015 UTC,"Coffee could be too fresh, and giving off too much gas during the extraction. May be worth trying some beans at 7-10 days old."
Coffee,3d5pgu,AtlasAirborne,4,Mon Jul 13 19:05:20 2015 UTC,"The cafe where I work lets all the beans we use rest for at least 5 to 7 days after roasting before we brew with them. I know immediate use is usually recommended here, but that's how we do it."

Coffee,3d5pgu,Bergeron83,3,Mon Jul 13 23:15:24 2015 UTC,"As you roast coffee, gasses are formed and are trapped inside the bean.  This is why brew coffee often involves a ""bloom"" phase - to let all that air out before trying to brew.    In brewed coffee, the escaping gas gets in the way of water coming in contact with the grounds.    In espresso, the grounds swell up more and very quickly vent the excess gases as 9bars of water displaces 1bar of gas pretty quickly, but it can result in narrower range of ""success"" parameters than slightly less gassy beans would."
Coffee,3d5pgu,Bergeron83,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:36:54 2015 UTC,"Very fresh coffee gives off lots of CO2 during the brewing process, which has the potential to interfere with the dynamics of espresso extraction. Possibly a myth, but widely held. See this for further info."

In short, stir your grinds in the portafilter with a needle before tamping. That will even out the grinds and allow for a much more even tamp across the grinds, reducing the likelihood of channelling. When I first used the needle I choked the machine 3x times in a row as I kept increasing the grind size trying to find the sweet spot."

Coffee,3d538g,DashAttack,6,Mon Jul 13 16:20:39 2015 UTC,"You're not gonna like this answer, but many people recommend having two separate grinders: a grinder for espresso, and another for everything else. The reasoning? Once you dial in your grinder for espresso for a particular batch of beans, you won't want to go back and forth between espresso and brewed coffee because it'll be too much of a hassle to re-dial in. Of course people do so, but it isn't terribly practical.   I'd recommend if you're comfortable with getting two grinders, to get the LIDO (2/3 is your preference on portability) for your needs now, and maybe wait till later for a dedicated espresso grinder if you really want to dive into the world of espresso. It'll make your life easier in the long run, and let you have more options with grinders/more time to save up for a grinder you want.   If your main concern is cost savings and are okay with having to switch between different grind sizes on one machine, I'd go for the Preciso."
Coffee,3d538g,exploding_chemist,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:33:45 2015 UTC,"Don't need to ""re-dial in"" if your grinder has a precise and easy to read and use adjustment method. It takes me a half second to go from pour-over to espresso, with reliable results.   That said, do not recommend the lido 2 for espresso, as it is much too much effort to do often."
Coffee,3d538g,poorover,5,Wed Jul 15 07:07:54 2015 UTC,"I own precisio. Their adjusting rings are problematic. Go for Lido, if you dont mind the manual grinding."
Coffee,3d538g,Kalita155,2,Mon Jul 13 20:04:49 2015 UTC,"For every other method besides espresso, the lido 2 is a beast. It is plenty fast for your needs. Plus any housemates will appreciate a quiet grind. When it comes to espresso you have to figure out how much you are going to make. If you are just going to do one or two shots at a time, grinding for espresso with a lido is fine. I say that as someone who grinds at least 25 grams of super fine Turkish coffee a day with a lido 2.  The lido is also super easy to clean and maintain. Removing the top screw and unscrewing the bottom gives you access enough to clean the grinder (not deep clean it, but you can still clean it well).  Unless you plan on becoming an espresso fanatic, I would recommend the lido."
Coffee,3d538g,PM_Me_Turkish_Coffee,2,Mon Jul 13 17:25:58 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend the Lido over any of those other options. For drip, no question at all. For espresso, the Lido is pretty useable until you get a dedicated espresso grinder far nicer than the Preciso. I use mine for the occasional espresso drink I make. When/if I get a nicer machine I'll be getting a Pharos or HG One to go with it."
Coffee,3d538g,CommunistWitchDr,2,Mon Jul 13 18:00:01 2015 UTC,"As a few others have said, the Lido is a pretty solid grinder for your current routine.   If you do want to get into espresso later, don't overlook a used commercial grinder. I found a Mazzer for less than a Preciso, even with new burrs factored in. You might also find yourself making nothing but espresso drinks after you get it going."
Coffee,3d538g,anon72c,2,Mon Jul 13 18:51:09 2015 UTC,"You said ""Ideally this would be my last grinder purchase ever (at least for the foreseeable future).""  Know that all grinders need some sort of service at some point. Electric most likely will need to be repaired and eventually be replaced.  If that is a hard requirement, then get the Lido 2/3. It will be a BIFL grinder. It CAN do espresso if you want it to. And if you THINK you want to do espresso, then you can use the Lido 2/3 for it. However, you should get a second grinder dedicated to espresso like others have suggested.  So my recommendation is to get the Lido 2/3 then eventually get a dedicated grinder for espresso. But be honest with yourself; are you going to be okay with a manual grinder? For me, I didn't mind since the grind time is 1g/sec and I knew the Lido 2/3 has better grind consistency than all grinders within the same price point. I wanted the quality and BIFL factor more than convenience. It's not for everyone."
Coffee,3d538g,lippstuh,3,Mon Jul 13 20:07:40 2015 UTC,"I must admit I can't imagine using a manual grinder for espresso. There is too much iteration when dialling in a bean. You would just been grinding all the time. Being able to quickly grind into a portafilter is just too nice.  The encore goes fine enough to do espresso, but it doesn't have the micro adjustments required. I've tried a Virtuoso for espresso and it was pretty frustrating. I frequently found myself between settings which were either too fine/too fast.  I have a preciso that I use for chemex/FP/espresso. It works. Two annoyances: 1) switching between drip and espresso is a pain. Going back to drip is fine as you only need to be approx in the right grind. But going back to espresso is a pain as it's tough to find exactly where you were. I find the grind the wanders a little so if, for example, 13G, was the correct grind, I switch to 40F for drip, it might be 13D now for the same espresso. It isn't a deal breaker, it's just a pain.   However, the preciso has gotten me into the espresso world, and now I am upgrading to a Forte (I lack counter space for a dedicated espresso grinder). Downside of the Preciso for espresso is that the plastic internals take a beating. I've had a couple problems with bits wearing out. However, this was with the old version 1.0 gearbox, and the new 2.0GB solves the problemsm I was having. Baratza's customer service is spectacular and they have a good company mantra of selling products that are upgradable and serviceable for as long as you own them. Any issues I've had were quickly fixed, often with a free part from Baratza.   Ideally this would be my last grinder purchase ever (at least for the foreseeable future).   The reality is, if you get into espresso and drop $1-2k on a machine, you'll want a dedicated espresso grinder. But the preciso gets you in the door, which the other 3 grinders you listed won't. You can then ""retire"" it to a dedicated brew grinder and have no regrets as it's a fantastic brew grinder.  You should check out the refurb section of Baratza's website: there is a preciso up now. http://www.baratza.com/cgi-bin/commerce.cgi?search=action&category=rfrb  tl;dr: I would highly recommend the Preciso if you are interested in getting into espresso at some point."

I love the customer service and had no troubles with my encore however my preciso was constantly broken. I'm moving to the lido 2 for that reason. It seems that if you have a little more spare time that the grind quality at the espresso level is very close of not the same with the preciso. When you hit drip there is no comparison. Some reviews show it as able to recveal flavors that grinders 2-3 times the price weren't able to produce.

It's not perfect, but it allowed me to get my foot in the door for espresso. Bought the espresso machine I wanted (r58) and can now upgrade to a more suitable grinder. It's somewhat different path than the one recommended here and on CoffeeGeek/HB, but it worked for me.  But if you're willing to accept you need two grinders and you have the counter space for two grinders and you are ok buying a grinder when you buy your espresso machine, then I would look at the virtuoso. Identical, including burrs, to the Preciso, but without the micro adjustments."

Coffee,3d64ed,deltadeep,2,Mon Jul 13 20:40:08 2015 UTC,"If you're not picky about actual mesh size, most kitchen sieves will do the job nicely.  If you want a precision sieve, you'll end up paying more but you will have a better idea of the particle sizes you're eliminating. Coffee fines are not particularly well-defined, but generally they're considered to be particles smaller than about 150 microns. However, to most efficiently remove those, you'll also want to separate the bulk of the coffee particles from the finer stuff first. If you don't, you'll just be sifting for a longer period of time to get most of the fines out. So, you may want a 400 and a 600 micron sieve as well as a 150ish micron sieve. What's caught between sieves is what you'll want to brew with, and you can ditch (or brew) the boulders and fines. This is assuming a drip grind profile however, where 600 microns would be on the more bouldery side of things for that brew method. For a press or immersion brew 500-800 microns is more desirable."
Coffee,3d64ed,pig_is_pigs,2,Mon Jul 13 21:11:15 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this detail! I did look at all the kitchen sieves sold locally, and their meshes are roughly what you might see in a window screen. Definitely too large - anything but french press grinds will just fall straight through. This may be just because I live in a small town and the local product selection is pretty slim - they must not sell the type of common kitchen sieve you are referring to. That's why I was hoping someone could link me to a specific product on Amazon or other major online supplier so that I can be sure of what I'm getting. Buying something with a specific micron measurement is a good idea, I will look into that. Thanks again."
Coffee,3d64ed,pig_is_pigs,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:30:05 2015 UTC,"I have one of these, though it's smaller and certainly wasn't that expensive. The hole size is about 400 microns, by my measurement. I've seen similar strainers at both grocery and kitchen stores, some with slightly larger holes, but not many with anything smaller. Some specialty sieves at restaurant supply stores will also use a nylon mesh instead of steel, which I think is probably not the best combination for use with coffee."
Coffee,3d6806,darkrom,5,Mon Jul 13 21:06:00 2015 UTC,"Are there any methods that are nearly as easy and quick as using my kcup machine, but aren't full of plastic?   Sure depends how you're pegging ""nearly"" - some methods I would say are similarly quick and easy are actually not and I just enjoy the process, some are really quite easy with a lot of depth...  Very few actually ""aren't full of plastic"".    My two go-to methods for cheap, fast, & easy are the Clever Coffee Dripper and the Aeropress, both of which are constructed entirely of plastic.  In both cases they're relatively easy and foolproof for good coffee, the AP produces a more concentrated brew while the Clever is more like a pourover, and in both cases you put a paper filter in, add coffee, add hot water, stir maybe once if you feel like it, let it sit briefly and then dispense.  Only slightly more effort than a pod machine and similarly fast.    Nobody makes a metal AP nor Clever.    Something like a bodum or espro press (glass/metal or metal/metal respectively) is probably the most plastic-free brewing you can have, but many folks find cleanup is a hassle, especially compared to pod."

I dont let my coffee sit around long , i like to drink it soon after i get it, so im not too sure if it retains heat for long periods, but probably not.   on the plus side, i have gotten discounts and even free coffees just by using it."
Coffee,3d3y1w,goldenbeans,2,Mon Jul 13 14:07:15 2015 UTC,Thanks for this. I didn't like the look of the keepcups too much and this might fit the bill. I had to switch to disposable cups because the travel mugs I bought retained heat well enough to keep my coffee/tea too hot to drink for hours.

Theyve won an award for good design too which is great!
Coffee,3d3y1w,grindhouse_,7,Mon Jul 13 12:14:09 2015 UTC,Yep I have one and we sell them at work. They're probably the biggest reusable coffee cup brand in NZ/Aus. I quite like mine but if you're not the type to remember to bring it everywhere with you they don't stop that problem.  The glass ones are beautiful and I've dropped one before (on concrete! ) and it didn't break.  You can't put the cork band ones in the dishwasher though. They both feel nice to drink from but for me nothing beats ceramic.
Coffee,3d3y1w,fredzizi,2,Mon Jul 13 09:39:55 2015 UTC,I've heard they don't retain heat well. What are your thoughts on this?
Coffee,3d3y1w,NotATankEngine,8,Mon Jul 13 10:48:39 2015 UTC,I have a glass/cork one and they don't really retain heat much better than a regular mug. But I don't think that is their purpose. They're not supposed to be a replacement for a thermos. I think of them as a replacement for disposable coffee cups. They're nicer to drink from and mean I'm not throwing away a ton of cardboard. I keep mine on the desk at work and just take it with me to the bar when I want a coffee. For that purpose it is perfect.
Coffee,3d3y1w,Spamfactor,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:02:28 2015 UTC,Fair enough. Thanks for the thoughtful response!
Coffee,3d3y1w,NotATankEngine,3,Mon Jul 13 11:17:22 2015 UTC,"I think it's a benefit that it dosen't retain the heat. This means I can start drinking my coffee right away. I used to have a contigo mug, I wouldn't be able to drink it on my drive to work as it was scalding hot. I wouldn't didn't get white and light grey again, I wish I would have gotten darker colors.

Coffee,3d3y1w,fredzizi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:40:58 2015 UTC,They seem to be similar to all other reusable cups I've used but I drink a long black so don't usually drink coffee slowly.  They don't get super hot so I assume that's good insulation.
Coffee,3d3y1w,Deschain_,3,Mon Jul 13 19:54:10 2015 UTC,"While they aren't that expensive, i'm struggling to see why you'd buy this over a similarly sized travel mug that is going to keep your drink warmer for longer.   I personally don't like the design of them either. The colored plastic ones look like a child's sippy cup and the glass one with cork doesn't look particularly functional. The cork makes it look like they're going for a very trendy, 'cool' look, but it's not going to be very comfortable holding a hot glass when only a 1 inch band is insulated."

Coffee,3d3y1w,_fups_,2,Mon Jul 13 13:07:28 2015 UTC,I ended up getting the glass one anyways because I liked the Temple logo and a lot of people were saying the plastic one doesn't have the best taste.

Coffee,3d3y1w,cowgirlsteph,2,Mon Jul 13 18:16:53 2015 UTC,"Single wall glass doesn't retain heat at all.   If a glass reusable cup is your thing, get a Mason jar and a coffee lid from Cuppow or EcoJarz and it's a fraction of the cost. You can even add a Mason jat koozie from a dozen manufacturers so you don't fry your hands. Still a fraction of the Keep Cup.

If you do get one, PLEASE wash it, too many cafe's refuse to accepted them because one dirty scum didn't clean theirs and ruin it for everyone.

Coffee,3d45gu,swroasting,2,Mon Jul 13 11:27:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you for answering. My response is going to sound very ignorant after reading yours as you seem very familiar with the terminology. This is going to sound very basic and I'll likely get the terms wrong so bear with me. I currently grind my coffee from bean stage using a grinder I picked up from the electric appliance store. I then tamp it down in the metal filter attached to the handle (??) and the machine pushes hot water through this into my cup. I do this until it starts to run clear (approx 20-30ml) and then I add frothed milk. It appears the only filter is the metal bit which sits inside and is able to be removed from the handle contraption. Is this a certain 'style' of brewing? And trying to deduce what you previously said, is there a way I can filter this further to lessen the bowel symptoms and will this affect the 'coffee content' and thus the wakefulness effect/taste?  Thanks again for your help."
Coffee,3d45gu,swroasting,3,Mon Jul 13 11:38:41 2015 UTC,"Espresso... uses a permanent metal filter which passes the oils and some fines.  I don't know of any way to improve the filtration for espresso, sorry.  If you're willing to change brewing methods, my advice might be helpful."
Coffee,3d45gu,fluffman86,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:53:24 2015 UTC,"Like /u/swroasting said, you're making espresso, and at least for me, that's pretty rough on the gut. I can handle a little bit, but not often.   Instead, try switching to any other brewing method. Cold brew will probably be a good option, as long as you use a paper filter. Search on this sub for more info on that.  Another good option might be an Aeropress with the paper filters, or a pour over like the Hario V60, or I've had excellent luck lately with this drip machine using these filters. Those filters are excellent at their job and produce a very clean cup of coffee.  Note that with most of those ways to make coffee, it will be quite different from your Espresso. Espresso is very ""dense"" - you get a lot of caffeine in a little bit liquid drink, so you end up diluting it with milk. Coffee made with any of the other machines will use more coffee and produce a much ""weaker"" liquid, so you'll probably want to add less milk and drink more coffee.  I used to do French Press, and had the same trouble as Espresso - the metal filter isn't fine enough to catch all the coffee. You'll probably also want to stay away from a Moka Pot.  Once you look into some different coffee styles, feel free to come back with any questions!"

So I presume I'm not lactose intolerant as I don't get symptoms from dairy products when drinking anything other than coffee.

Coffee,3d3ve9,lazarescu,3,Mon Jul 13 18:40:51 2015 UTC,"You might want to check out a video tutorial I made on using Moka Pots.  It addresses a lot of your questions.   Grams of beans will vary depending on grind and unit size. The best thing to do is to fill the basket properly, then weigh the contents to see how much you're using. That'll help you calibrate the number of grams you'll need to grind later.  Grind consistency:  Not too fine. Definitely not espresso-grind. (Too fine of a grind may cause the unit to clog.) I like to shoot for something slightly finer than standard drip grind. Basket fill level: I usually fill it to the top. I don't tamp, I just tap the side of the basket to flatten any air pockets.  Level it off with a knife or finger and make sure the lip of the basket if free of stray grounds. Brew Time:  This will vary depending on the size of your unit. My 1-cup pot takes about 3 minutes. My 3-cup pot takes a little over 5. Heat: If your brew is ""spouting"" out of the top, it generally means your heat is too high. Try it on low to medium-low heat.   Hope this helps!"

So, I'd take the advice of someone who's entire career has been coffee rather than someone who is a celebrity chef/actor.  just sayin, you have to have standards.  If you are getting bitter or making bitter coffee, you don't want to use chemistry to fix it.  You shouldn't have to fix it.  Fixing it means you got crap to begin with, or you did a crap job.  Instead, you should do one of two things: 1) get something that isn't crap (or) 2) don't fix your method so you don't make crap.  The sweet taste of a perfect brew and practicing to make it is more of an accomplishment than doing it half assed and relying on a pinch of salt to fix it."

I know several people who bring their own gear/beans to work because of this.  I have an AP and FP at work, but the actual beans here are pretty decent, I just like to have a fresh cup every time."
Coffee,3d44yu,cnbll1895,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:19:29 2015 UTC,"Here are the tips to getting a great tasting coffee.  Make sure when you buy a coffee it comes from an altitude above 2,000 feet.  The lower the altitude the less flavor it will have.  Make sure the water you use is not hard.  Soften it with a filter, or buy bottled water to fill your brewer.  Use a french press, because coffee filters prevent the coffee oils from pass through into to your caraf.  The oils are essential to the taste of a good coffee.  I order my coffee from a company in Oregon that always has very high quality beans.  They are called Allann Bros Coffee.  My favorite is the Maestros Blend and Monte Carlo.  Nice full body coffees."

Coffee,3d3i6e,Korrak,2,Mon Jul 13 05:51:03 2015 UTC,"I have one of these and the most important thing is to use very coarsely ground coffee. If you don't the plastic filter will get clogged and the coffee won't be able to return to the bottom chamber once the vacuum begins. Oh, and be gentle with it. The top portion is top-heavy and is prone to tipping over. I've broken both the top and bottom chambers and I'm a fairly careful person. On a positive note, I really like the coffee from these brewers. You've made a good choice."

Start coarse, set up your timing and stirring with spoon/agitation (for me, 4 rotations of a wooden spoon over 2minutes total in the top bowl works best - you have to figure out when to turn the heat off to hit that  / whether to put a damp towel on the bottom section for faster drawdown)  Once you have your routine down to a repeatable art, then slowly grind finer until you start getting overextracted tastes, and adjust to suit"

Coffee,3d1wnt,craigs119,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:27:41 2015 UTC,"I don't see it ever working for a hot extraction. Proper extraction temp for coffee is roughly ~200F, much less and it will be rediculously weak and unbalanced. Milk scalds at 180F, any hotter and the lactose in the milk caramelizes and develops a bitter/sour flavor.  You might, might, with a lot of tinkering, be able to pull off a cold-brew extraction for iced milk-coffee. This assumes that milk will steep your coffee well (lots of fat solids & sugars in your solvent of choice, which will ultimately affect the efficiency and balance of the extraction), and even then cold brew is usually a room-temperature soak for 12-24 hours. You would have to keep the whole system refrigerated to avoid spoiling your milk (40-140F is the ""danger zone"" of bacterial growth), and that will vastly slow down the rate of extraction.  Best of luck, but I think you'll just wind up wasting your time and money."

Coffee,3d5l2t,CommunistWitchDr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:06:02 2015 UTC,Well you can increase the taste by upping your coffee ratio to water.  But normally cold brew coffee will taste lighter/weaker than hot brewed.  The heat is what draws out a lot.of the oils in coffee that produce a full body flavor.  Those same oils increase acidity which ends up being the bitter.  Cold brew doesn't...so you may need to increase the coffee amount or add in filler like milk or hazelnut.  Filler will round out that weak flavor you are experiencing.  I like to put a little milk and vanilla with hazelnut.  Its amazing
Coffee,3d0ynu,spilja,41,Sun Jul 12 16:41:39 2015 UTC,"Meh. A thermos is fine. Just clean it out thoroughly every so often so residue doesn't build up.

Coffee,3d0ynu,SeventhMagus,0,Mon Jul 13 07:55:21 2015 UTC,Anything hot should be consumed as quickly as possible. I guess with your situation I'd suggest cold brewing and diluting with hot water (though I've never tried that and can't say it'd taste good) or just getting used to drinking it cold. Concentrated cold brew lasts a good two weeks in the fridge but only a few days once diluted (not sure how hot water would affect it). As long as you can avoid microwaving your coffee I'd say go for it.
Coffee,3d0ynu,co_ja,-2,Sun Jul 12 16:52:58 2015 UTC,"I picked up my best insulated coffee thermos ever and added a home made cozy around it for extra thermal insulation.  I made my cozy by sewing a thermal blanket inside a quilted sleeve and slipping the sleeve around the thermos with just the handle peaking out. I needed to hand sew the bottom of the cozy with a circular pattern of extra fabric,  to keep it flush on the desktop.  The addition of the cozy Keeps coffee hot for longer periods, and better than just the thermos by itself.  If it had a USB plug from the container to my computer to warm it up I'd be even happier.   My coffee is blended so perfectly that if it goes cold it still tastes great and I've warmed it up in a ceramic mug at the office when it's an hour old nad it is still fine.   I make pour over coffee using my own blend of roasted beans, where I i also add browned, groundup pearl barley to extend the coffee (due to my GERD,) and this  brought the caffeine level down a lot, I also add carob nibs to the coffee grounds along with cinamon and just pour extremely hot water over the grounds.   I make some seriously aromatic grindage in the morning with an exceptional bloom which really  helps the whole process for me to wake up, but I put the coffee into a steel travel Thermos and wait for a half hour before drinking it.  Ihave to take my morning pills, but won't diluting the coffee with cool water.  I will also use my Moka pot for making Cuban coffee - espresso with triple sugar and whippped cream after I've had my first cup of coffee  and only on special occasions.   When one has Barrett's esophagus like i do, one has to keep the amount of acid down - and I do medicate before drinking anything as potentially as risky as coffee can be.  I never drink any coffee outside of my own kitchen for this reason.  This summer I plan to undergo the radio frequency ablation for my esophagus due to the potential for cancer is 50 times higher for those of us with a diagnosed case of Barrett's esophagus plus GERD."

There's really not a lot of plastic for the coffee to come into contact with, as most will flow along the filter and only just touch the vanes. Even at that, it's only flowing over the plastic, not sitting in contact with it. If plastic were soluble enough to taint the small amount of coffee it touches during brewing, your V60 would be noticeably dissolving day by day."

That and the fact that you're most likely masking any imperfections with the cream and sweetener.   Try a cup of 50/50 brew to water free of any additives and see if you can't truly taste any bitterness, then you'll be able to say definitively that time isn't a big deal.

Coffee,3d1qkc,decompn,0,Sun Jul 12 20:31:16 2015 UTC,"Zip lock bags are great if they have a gas valve - as beans get older, they release gasses naturally which will bloat the bag, but the valve will let the gass out and stop oxygen getting in. They are actually much better than the brown bags which seem to be trending at the moment as these bags are so poarus and oxygenage the beans too easily. Your tin might impart a slight taste into your beans if you leave them for a long time in there but if you are opening and closing it, and rotating your beans regularly then youre probably fine!"

Find a local place that sells fresh coffee, buy in the smallest increments they'll sell, have them grind it for you, and you'll be making a major step up in quality, and a major savings in cost over K cups or convenience store coffee. Plus you'll have the ability to brew it as strong as you like. All you need is a way to boil water, ie pot or kettle, and you pour the water over the ground coffee in the filter (oh yeah, don't forget filters, available at any supermarket in the world), out comes the brew. Watch a few you tube videos on technique and you're in business.   Alternatively, go into that fantastic shop and ask for advice."

Getting the pour just right and to have consistently good coffee can be tough. Of course, I haven't made my own pour over, but I've had it a few times at a local coffee shop and even there where they have scales and weigh out the beans and water to get it just right it still tastes differently each time. You can make a great cup with it if you know what you're doing, but you can also make a really crappy cup of coffee, haha. That said, I suggest a product called Aeropress, which was suggested to me and that I've been using and have been really happy with for about 6 months. Much harder to screw up and that way it's easier to get a consistently good cup of coffee from!

Coffee,3d2021,cache4gold,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:57:09 2015 UTC,"To add on to that, Houndstooth has two locations, but try to check out the one on 42nd and N Lamar if you can. Caffe Medici is also pretty good and has multiple locations, but in my opinion their espresso drinks just don't quite match those of Houndstooth  If you're not looking for espresso, both of these places also have excellent black coffee. One big difference I have noticed is that Caffe Medici will only use immersion brewers (french press, Clever), whereas Houndstooth has a larger array (Kalita Wave, Chemex, Clever). Caffe Medici usually carries three different single-origins, and for Houndstooth, it really depends.  Both of these coffee shops also have locations just off Congress Ave. about two blocks away from one another. (2nd at the base of the Austonion & 4th at the base of the Frost Bank Tower)"
Coffee,3d2021,notPythagoras,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:02:25 2015 UTC,"As for espresso -  Cafe Medici uses the same beans all the time (and get them from Cuvee) - their philosophy is that they can make their espresso the best possible by knowing that one bean well.  Houndstooth is constantly switching up the beans they use for espresso. Their philosophy is to have constant variety. They will sometimes even do Single Origin  As for Cuvee, they are the new kid on the block when it comes to having a cafe, but as a roaster they have been IMO the best roaster in Central Texas for years. I live an hour away and I order my beans from them. I don't however know their philosophies in the shop - I just know that everything I have had there has been super tasty."

One local roaster I haven't seen mentioned is Fara. I think cuvee is better but also carries a price premium of $3-5 a pound. Fara claims that they grow their own beans on family owned farms in Nicaragua and oversee all parts of the chain. I haven't seen any independent verification or dispute of those claims so take it as you will. All I know is that results from the whole beans has been very good and the coffee is widely available. I don't know if they have a 'retail' location as Cuvee does. Cuvee is pretty damn innovative.

Coffee,3d0wu9,Stats_monkey,3,Mon Jul 13 02:38:03 2015 UTC,"crema looks pretty light, if it tastes sour try grinding a bit finer and/or waiting for the machine to get hotter.  If you leave the portafilter in the machine while it's heating up and run some water through before packing the pf you should be able to get a higher extraction temp.  Also look up the weiss distribution technique it helps a ton with a gaggia mdf."
Coffee,3d0wu9,MitchH87,2,Sun Jul 12 18:00:36 2015 UTC,You can also increase temp by hitting the steam mode button for a few seconds just before the shot begins to get the water a little hotter.

Coffee,3d0wu9,Stats_monkey,2,Sun Jul 12 18:05:26 2015 UTC,"First, are you trying a double or single? The Classic comes with a commercial double, so try to pull an even two oz.   Second, how many grams did you pack? It's variable that one might use a finer grind, but pack closer to the 14g ""usual"" for a double... But sometimes pack down 16/18g and fill the basket higher but grind less fine.  The MDF lacks the ability to weigh/dispense metered (manual suggests 7g per pull, but I contest...) amounts into the filter, using the doser... Your double filter should weigh about 24-26g so please tare and reweigh after dosing.  Lastly, experiment! Different beans like different grinds, so keep a log for what works really well to build consistency with your routine."
Coffee,3d0wu9,frogstomp19,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:18:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, going for double shot. Basically all I did was dose into the portafilter, level off with a finger, tamp and pull.

Coffee,3d0wu9,frogstomp19,2,Sun Jul 12 20:38:03 2015 UTC,"G'day, I'm about to upgrade from my Classic after using it for 3 years daily.  Some tips.  Get yourself a naked portafilter and a 18gram or 20gram VST basket.  The stock basket on these machines are rubbish, I threw mine in the bin. Use the naked to tune your shots, it will teach you a LOT.   Also you can mod the machine to have the Rancillio Silvia steam wand. I don't know I they are still selling the classic with that plastic POS 'easy foam' wand, if they are throw that shit in the bin too.   Another tip for when you have to do more than one shot, keep the water reservoir low and boil the kettle and use that to fill your reservoir.  The boiler is tiny in these things and using hot water will give you more consistent shots and will help you pull them faster.   Also get a blind (also called blank) basket for back flushing through the group head when you are doing a descale/clean."

The extraction keeps taking so long. I read somewhere if you preboil it should spout out almost instantly. When it actually begins to come out of the spout, the stream is still irregular the entire way, then stops brewing about halfway through. It's never streaming out of the spout for more than 2 seconds before it gets cut off.   I mean, I see people on youtube just slap the thing together not being careful at all then produce something at least edible. I think it's a manufacturing problem (I have no idea what it could be) based on how careful I've been until now."

There's obviously something preventing the water from being pushed into the top piece, but I don't know what it is.   It's possible there are TWO filters behind the rubber seal, this could have been a human/factory error and would result in more resistance at that area and why your seeing the results your getting."

With their paper filter they also are more forgiving to what grinder you get (as in, a cheaper grinder will still work well). A ROASTER?!

Coffee,3d0k88,Shiny5hoes,6,Sun Jul 12 17:45:51 2015 UTC,"Two completely different methods. Moka pot is a thick, espresso-like coffee that is very easy to mess up and create burnt tasting coffee. However, when done right, it tastes awesome and you can make some interesting drinks with it. The Aeropress is immersion brewing with a filter, so you get full flavor without any oil. It's also essentially fool proof -- the grind doesn't matter much and the methods can vary greatly with fantastic results across the board   If I had to choose, aeropress is more of a daily driver -- but I have both and I certainly Love my Moka when I want to make a Cuban coffee or just have a few sips of a really strong espresso-like shot.   Someone on here recently mentioned attaching an aeropress filter to their Moka pot which I have to try soon, but the beauty of the Moka is its oily, viscous product."

I'll second the aeropress. It's pretty fool proof if you stick to a basic recipe and will give you either a decent 8oz in one go, or a more than decent 12oz americano . ( never could get 16oz out successfully).   Pick up a hario mini mill, super cheap and good enough for the aeropress. (Porlex is also an option it fits inside the aeropress until you put it in upside down like I did and loose your cap forever)   Skip the press for now, you'll be hard pressed  (yuk yuk) to get coarse enough to make it work without tasting like ass."

Coffee,3d0k88,DiscoJaguar,3,Sun Jul 12 15:28:32 2015 UTC,"Aero press. Seriously, so much easier to clean especially if you're in a dorm. I started with a French press and it's now sitting in my cabinet all dusty (even though it's my most expensive coffee maker). If you really want to buy a French press, I'd go with a stainless steel. Frieling is the best but expensive, there's a few others with good reviews on Amazon. I also bought an extra mesh filter and applied it to the press with the existing screen already on it, as I was getting a ton of silt which was making my coffee bitter in my travel mug.   If you like the grittiness of a French press, they sell reusable discs for the aero so you get a little oil and silt. I really recommend the aero press. So does everyone. Believe us.   Hario Skerton or mini mill are good. Counter culture has great beans for sale online, or find some local roaster that can hook it up. Where are you located?   With your budget, get a good travel mug. I really like the zojirushi -- it stays hot for many hours and is super durable. Definitely loved mine to keep my brew hot during long labs and lectures.   All of this stuff is on Amazon:  Skerton is $30, aeropress (with 300 filters) $30, electric kettle $15, ozeri scale $15 and zojirushi travel mug is $30. That's $120 and will last you forever if you treat everything right. A years worth of aero filters is $5."

Grind 20-22 g beans. Bloom with 20-30 g water for 30 s.  Add 150 g water. Stir for 10 seconds.  Add 50 g more water or more depending on how much you have to fill it.  Let steep. [I've tried a lot of different steep times.]  Invert & press. Dilute 100 g water for 300 g coffee total.    I've tried a lot of different recipes, though. That's the onethat worked out the best for me. The cup doesn't come close to v60, chemex, siphon or french press in my opinion. I even prefer my moka pot over it. Hence, it's my work coffee for that 3:00 pm crash when I'm really just looking for caffeine more than taste."
Coffee,3d0k88,landrybennett,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:05:26 2015 UTC,"To each their own! I use a similar method. Can I ask what don't you like about the cup compared to other methods?

I too am a college student and I have had great success with the Aeropress and Hario grinder. I've never made a bad cup of coffee with the Aeropress, and it is very easy to store and clean."
Coffee,3d0k88,dog-luver,2,Sun Jul 12 18:43:37 2015 UTC,"My starter kit was a Hario Mini Mill, V60, and Buono but if I could go back, based on what I actually used most in a dorm setting, I would sub the V60 for an AeroPress. It's easier to use, extremely versatile to different brewing methods (pourover, immersion, pressurized), and always makes an amazing quick cup of coffee. I still use my AeroPress just about every day because it's so easy to pack around in one neat little bag with my grinder and a bag of beans. So I would probably get a Hario Skerton or Porlex grinder (if you want an upgrade from the Mini), any kettle, and the AeroPress."

Coffee,3d2ayg,davidplaysguitar,5,Sun Jul 12 23:17:46 2015 UTC,"Have you tried inverted brewing? INVERTED METHOD!  Seriously, I tried the method that the aeropress instructions suggest, but I can't even remember how to do a ""regular"" method anymore. Inverted is easier, cleaner, and I don't get any leaking like you describe.  If you want to diagnose it further, make sure your grind isn't too course!"
Coffee,3d2ayg,Towelz0r,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:43:51 2015 UTC,"Thankyou! I haven't tried the inverted method but funnily enough I was looking at it this afternoon and it actually looks much more sensible than what Aerobie recommended. Just out of interest, how long do you leave the coffee brewing for before you plunge?"
Coffee,3d2ayg,Towelz0r,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:52:07 2015 UTC,"At this point in my morning routine, I have a mean case of not being able to make coffee until I've had coffee, so I can't really comment. I guess I pour my hot water into my inverted aeropress to wet the grounds (bloom it) and leave that 30 seconds or so   stir it a bit pour water up to about a finger or two from the top stir it 6-10 times, then put the lid and filter on and wait 20 seconds  swirl the whole contraption  wait another 30 seconds  then invert over a mug (warm it up with some boiling water after you've bloomed then throw it out before you start to press!)   I stop pressing as soon as I hear hissing.  Because of all the variables in aeropress brewing, you can tailor this to your taste. I don't have the mental capacity in the morning to set timers and whatnot. The most I can do is weigh out my 17 grams of coffee and grind it.  What sort of grinder are you working with?"
Coffee,3d2ayg,erickssm,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:04:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this was super super helpful! I followed all the above steps spot perfectly and still experienced a lot of dripping. Again, I lost about 1/3 of what I poured in by the time I started to plunge. I feel it may be that I'm not grinding the beans fine enough (I have uploaded a picture of the grinds in response to an earlier comment). The grinder is my Dads Molineaux, which he probably got in the 90s, so that may be the problem! Could you recommend a good grinder that is affordable? I'm a student something that does the job but doesn't break the bank!"
Coffee,3d2ayg,Rmccoy2011,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:02:38 2015 UTC,"The timing of the brew is highly dependent on your grind size and water temp.  It could be anywhere from 45 seconds, to 2-3 mins.  You will have to ""dial it in"" based on your situation and preference.  Its best to measure out 1) amount of beans (simple .1g scale) 2) temp of water (basic cooking thermometer) and 3) grind size (quality adjustable burr grinder helps a lot) and 4) amount of water used (changes the strength more than the quality).  If you cant measure all those out, you will have trouble making a consistent cup with the aeropress.  I use 20g of beans, grind similar to standard drip coffee, with 83-85C water, about 12-14oz of water (half added after brew) and let it brew for about 2:15 before starting the downward press (about 30 seconds to press.)  To each his own, there are a thousand recipes for the areopress."
Coffee,3d2ayg,coldpear,3,Mon Jul 13 17:01:26 2015 UTC,"Can you post a picture of your grinds on a white background?  I had the same problem, but found that it was because my grinds were not fine enough."
Coffee,3d2ayg,coldpear,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:34:56 2015 UTC,"Definitely. I also notice a huge difference based on the age of the beans. If they've been freshly roasted and the oils are still...oily, I only get a little dripping. If I'm using older beans, drip city."
Coffee,3d2ayg,Sullyboy,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:43:21 2015 UTC,"While I don't know how long they were in the shop for, I bought my beans two mornings ago and they still look very oily. They are however a very very dark roast - potentially a stupid question, but would that affect the oily-ness of the beans and contribute to the issue?"
Coffee,3d2ayg,Rmccoy2011,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:50:51 2015 UTC,I'm actually not sure! Would need someone more knowledgeable than me to answer that ;)
Coffee,3d2ayg,Vomitclaw,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:00:19 2015 UTC,Yes dark roasts will start getting oily within a couple of days. Medium roasts at about day 5 or 6  If the dripping is an issue google the inverted method

Coffee,3cwv13,0root,17,Sat Jul 11 15:39:13 2015 UTC,"Here's a good article from Boot in Roast magazine about examining the cross-section of beans to identify roast defects.

Coffee,3cwv13,swroasting,2,Sat Jul 11 16:45:05 2015 UTC,"Yes, and yes.  Beans release the chaff on the outer surface during first crack, but will hold onto light colored chaff in the seam until they approach second crack, during which it will quickly darken and then be released."
Coffee,3cwv13,tomhusband,3,Sat Jul 11 17:08:43 2015 UTC,Thanks. I wondered why I still have some chaff after my roast.  It's because I rarely go to 2nd crack.

Coffee,3cziwx,kingseven,3,Mon Jul 13 00:20:28 2015 UTC,"I typically start with an 18/28 ratio, unless the roaster suggests something else. I've talked with a lot of baristas around NYC and it appears that when a shop uses a blend they use something closer to 18/28, while with a single origin espresso they tend to go with an 18/40 (these are just to express percentages, not exact in/out, which may fluctuate by a few grams).   EDIT: Here is a link from James Hoffman, the UK barista champion. (http://www.jimseven.com/2007/01/02/espresso-extraction-ratios/)"
Coffee,3cziwx,twogscoffee,2,Mon Jul 13 00:45:08 2015 UTC,"Interesting, I have always tended to go shorter for single origin. I wonder if /u/kingseven has any plans of coming back to revise that with current trends."

Anyways, I think the reasoning behind this is that people pulling SO shots like to have more clarity, in order to better taste the bean and pick out individual flavors. Meanwhile, I think that the blends are pulled with more body, which mixes better with milk drinks. I'd like to see what /u/kingseven says though."
Coffee,3cziwx,Hooblah2u2,3,Mon Jul 13 18:13:54 2015 UTC,"It's really a question of starting density to me. This is a combination of roast and also component coffee.  If the blend is fairly traditional, has some lower grown components (like some nice estate Brazils etc) and is roasted a little more to be present in milk then it is likely pretty soluble so I don't need a tonne of solvent (brew water) to get a good tasting shot. These kinds of blends do well at 1:1.5 (assuming equipment is in good condition).   There's some personal preference involved. I can guarantee 100% that I'm not going to like anything pulled in an old school 1:1 kind of way - even though some people love the texture of these kinds of espressos (and the strength).   SOs are a little easier to guess out of the gate - looking at roast, and having pretty uniform elevation (sufficiently uniform), especially if the coffee has been size graded in some way.  Generally I prefer 1:2 as a starting point for just about everything (not a finishing point, a starting point when beginning to dial in) - this has the mixture of clarity and strength that I typically enjoy."

It's amazing how using the same recepie on 2 consecutive days tastes so different. We also change the preinfusion and pressure profile to make it tastes the best. Different roast batches and length of time from roasting always change the recepie so we always dial in in the morning and change recepie throughout the day to keep it always tasting the best!

Coffee,3cyly4,blue_bass,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:18:48 2015 UTC,"the only controls you have are the quantity and duration. you can stop the roast at any time and start the cooling cycle. so yes it can do light roasts and most people are saying it's better for light roast, I just like medium-dark roast with this El Salvador coffee I currently have.  it roasts faster if you put fewer beans in it, so it's easier to get a darker roast in a short amount of time. also the blower and agitator don't have to work as hard, so I'm hoping the machine will last longer if I keep the batch size under 100 grams. the manual says it can handle up to 1/3 lb (150 grams), but with this quantity it would take 20-22 minutes for light roast and 27-30 minutes for dark roast (including 5 minute cooldown cycle  I've done 3 roasts so far. with 120 gram charge, 15 minutes of heating prices produces full city. with a 60 gram charge, 10 minutes of heating produces French roast (full city+). you can extrapolate from there. it's definitely slower and more controllable than a popper."

For a vacuum pot, pour-over or aeropress (all like $4 at my local spot) -- I will do 2 dollars usually. If it is just cold brew or drip, a $1-1.50. The shop I go to has Square (the iPad payment system) that allows for the customer to choose a 10, 15 or 20% tip. They sometimes don't even give the option to tip if I just get a cup of cold brew or a bag of beans."

Coffee,3cz4ft,GodspeedSelf,3,Sun Jul 12 20:10:45 2015 UTC,"Are Baristas making the $2.13 waiter/waitress/server minimum wage? No. They making the normal minimum wage or more. The reason you tip a waiter/waitress/server is that they are actually working for you (but have a different boss). At least that's how I look at it. I bring this up because some people don't know what the waiter minimum wage is.   Note 1 - Some states have a higher minimum wage for wait staff. Very cool. Note 2 - When tips are counted, and you didn't make minimum wage with tips + the $2.13, the restaurant must make up the difference. But good luck with that... Note 3 - Linky - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipped_wage_in_the_United_States   Tipping for drip makes no sense to me. They took a cup and put coffee in it. A counterperson on their first day can do the same. If you want to tip please go right ahead. I don't think you are under any obligation to do so for somebody fulfilling their duties as an employee by pouring a cup of coffee and ringing you up. This is a 1 minute transaction at most.  However, if the barista takes the time to work with you on your perfect Latte, makes subtle changes to the extraction based on your feedback or their knowledge, or otherwise uses their skill to produce a beverage that you thoroughly enjoy, tipping is not out of line.  This is how I approach it.  Edit: It's Sunday morning and I haven't had coffee yet..."
Coffee,3cz4ft,Luxin,2,Sun Jul 12 12:54:54 2015 UTC,"Tipping is a gratuity - while it's obviously more of an obligation in the restaurant industry, it's a way to show gratitude toward the server regardless of what their wage or what they're making and serving. If a customer is grateful for the person who pours them a cup of coffee then they have all the freedom to put something in the tip jar, and the barista will definitely appreciate it.   Also, there's a great deal of effort that goes into making drip coffee taste good, even if you don't see it the way you see someone pouring a latte. With a rotating selection of coffees, each one gets dialed in, tested and measured, and adjusted until we find the right specs for drip coffee. This requires several pots to be made and a good deal of beans wasted.  In short I don't think it's inappropriate to tip a good amount for drip, but I also understand why people wouldn't feel the need to do so."

I tip if I brought someone with me that doesn't tip baristas and got something that they really should have tipped for or if I know my guest is slightly disruptive (moms with kids that can get fussy, people who tend to get loud, or if I'm in a bad mood and talking with my guest and might cuss) I tip if they're really busy and still maintained control. I tip if I know I'm going to be there for a while, even if it's going to be empty the whole time.

Coffee,3cz36u,JustHereForTheTips,4,Sun Jul 12 02:43:37 2015 UTC,"I own both with no particular preference between the two. Both are special and produce good cups.  Chemex - What's special about it is the filters, amazing clarity and lends itself to light roasts really well. Good for large batches, and looks sexy as hell on a counter top. The jury is still out on if the way the filters seal to the glass adds to the method. But I find it a mostly bullet proof way to make coffee where I struggled to get a pleasing cup out of others.   V60 - Cheap,(plastic) compatable with a ton of filters. (Standard malitta, and chemex) Thinner filters so the cup gets more body, and some of the deeper notes that sometimes go missing in the chemex show up here. However, the v60 is a fickle mistress and will punish you if you try and rush her. I've had some godawful cups out of this method. Still worth getting especially if you don't want to drop for a chemex. It's a really good way to evaluate your methods and variables since the changes in any are exaggerated here  Tldr why not both"

My kettle is a dragon neck, and it took me a while to get it to where I wasn't agitating the grounds in different way every single time. I believe that problem is then magnified with an even shorter (arguably spoutless) nosed kettle that is commonly available.  There's no reason not to get one, especially with offerings like the fino being just barely more than a standard pot in the first place."
Coffee,3cz36u,magiccoffeetruck,2,Sun Jul 12 05:54:40 2015 UTC,"I started with one of the all-in-one V60 with the plastic cone over glass carafe and it was nice, compact, easy to clean. After getting a Chemex, I like it more and tend to use it more but it's really a difference of small degrees. As a coffee ritual, it's just more fun with the Chemex and with the 6-cup it's just bigger than the all-in-one V60 I have so that could be part of the appeal for me anyway.   I did end up buying a gooseneck kettle after a bit too as it did help with overall control but love my regular neck (er, I guess) electric kettle as well. They both get used (the latter mostly for French press).  I did notice in the Sprudge article about what methods the finalists in the World Brewers Cup that 4 of the 6 used some sort of V60 so take that as you will: http://sprudge.com/6-of-the-worlds-best-coffee-brewing-methods-80081.html"

Coffee,3cz36u,j1mdan1els,2,Sun Jul 12 05:04:53 2015 UTC,u/discojaguar pretty much gave you everything ... the only thing I would add is that the Chemex delivers 'higher' notes. If you've got a coffee that's laden with floral and fruit notes they come through more with the Chemex. It's probably that the thicker filters remove the deeper flavour notes making the others more recognisable but it is a distinct difference between the chemex and other filters.
Coffee,3cz36u,Shtyke,2,Sun Jul 12 15:03:43 2015 UTC,"I was doing some research on this today. I have a Chemex and recently had some Yirgacheffe from a v60 at a shop and it was unbelievable, tried to recreate it at home but I couldn't.   It seems that the Chemex produce a full bodied cup with lovely aromas but the v60 produces a way more delicate cup of coffee.   I'm going to brew some Yirgacheffe in my Chemex in the next hour or so with less coffee to see if I can recreate what I had in the shop. Will report back!

Coffee,3cz36u,deltadeep,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:51:49 2015 UTC,"Psychology might play a small role but if you think you're missing the target, you probably are. You gotta keep experimenting with the variables, of which there are many. Water is surely an important thing. See if you can get a bottle of Volvic water which is a very specific water from a Volcanic spring in France, and they are very controlled about the water's mineral content and it's great for brewing coffee. Other bottled water brands can be highly variable even from bottle to bottle. I wouldn't use Volvic all the time (it's expensive and not eco-friendly to use it) but it can, for the sake of experimenting, help eliminate the water variable. Also: grinder, grind size, water temp, pouring technique..."

Coffee,3cz36u,deltadeep,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:20:25 2015 UTC,"Is it actually the same bean as what you had in the shop? Is it fresh? Also, what kind of grinder are you using that your coarsest setting is still suitable for a Chemex? You want grinds the size of typical table-salt grains, or in that ballpark. A 1:20 ratio might work but as far as I know it's more typical to see 1:17, so 1:20 would lend to under-extraction more than over-extraction, so something sounds amiss here."

Coffee,3cyrh8,rlynch1996,9,Sun Jul 12 00:20:49 2015 UTC,"was sad to realize that I had to give up my french pressed coffee.    Well, who told you that?   Peptic ulcers are typically caused by an infection with Helicobacter pylori. There are som other risk factors like anti inflammatory drugs, but the majority of ulcers are caused by an infectious disease. When a H.p. infection is confirmed, the treatment is a combination therapy which eradicates the bacteria, and the sore in the lining of the stomach or duodenum will heal.   The idea that coffee in itself causes ulcers is pretty much out of the window, but traditional dietetic advice still lingers, despite lack of documentation.    There is no conclusive evidence that dietary restrictions and bland diets play a role in ulcer healing. No proven relationship exists between peptic ulcer disease and the intake of coffee and alcohol. However, since coffee stimulates gastric acid secretion, and alcohol can cause gastritis, moderation in alcohol and coffee consumption is recommended.   http://www.medicinenet.com/peptic_ulcer/page4.htm  Disclaimer: This information may or may not apply to your case.

Caffeine is not the only variable because decaffeination does not reduce these effects of coffee [75].  Despite these observations, there is no evidence that coffee consumption is a risk factor for ulcer disease, although increased consumption may be associated with a higher rate of infection with H. pylori [46,76]. In one series, coffee increased dyspepsia in subjects with nonulcer dyspepsia, but not in those with DU when compared with controls [77].

Coffee,3cyrh8,westcoastroasting,4,Sun Jul 12 14:52:39 2015 UTC,"Coffee is not very acidic. Acidity in coffee is a flavor descriptor (of tartness) that people misinterpret as a pH indicator.

Coffee,3cyrh8,H0kusai,2,Sun Jul 12 16:52:18 2015 UTC,"Westcoastroasting has already answered the concern about acidity of coffee. On the other hand, coffee can increase the secretion of gastric acid which IS highly acidic:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_acid  In the end it is gastric acid that is responsible for the formation of ulcers when the protective mechanisms of the lining of the stomach or duodenum are compromised, typically by H. Pylori or by NSAIDs like ibuprofen.   In the absence of gastric acid, the ulcer will heal. Therefore peptic ulcers are treated with H2-blockers or proton pump inhibitors which drastically decrease the production of gastric acid. For a simple NSAID related ulcer that will do the trick, for H. Pylori infections antibiotics are added.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptic_ulcer#Treatment  So I do hope you are prescribed an H2-blocker or a PPI, and in that case coffee shouldn't give you any problems."

After it sits, filter it with either a coffee filter or cheese cloth over a pitcher or other container. (I only had plastic pitchers that would leave the coffee flavor in them forever so I actually used a flower vase.) This part can be hard because the grounds clogged up the filter a bit. I ended up replacing filters a few times.  After the coffee is filtered, you can put it in the fridge of just add ice to it, but it will be super concentrated so when you drink it, add equal parts water or milk, otherwise you might get a bit jittery."

It's a lot of work for what amounts to a slightly cleaner Aeropress-style brew. Fun to noodle around with on occasion, but it's not part of my regular brewing repertoire.  I think the folks at Everyman Espresso in NYC converted theirs into a terrarium. I've considered doing the same to mine."

Winning Brewers Cup is as much about the coffee and presentation as it is about the technique or device, and Todd used this device to highlight some specific concepts in extraction and pull what he wanted to get out of his coffee. But it is a novel concept, it has some substance to it, it's just too cumbersome to me for such a minor improvement.  I will say that I know some folks really love theirs.

Though they don't yet have any retail products, Brewista is an up-and-coming company to look out for on the coffee scale front. If I recall correctly their price point is intended at around half of Acaia's. Unfortunately, none of this helps you right now. Most coffee shops end up with either the CJ4000 (great for weighing doses and manual brewing), or the AMW-SC-2KG (great for weighing shots). Neither of these are waterproof, but that's why they're in the $20 range and not $100+. In my experience, as long as you wipe them dry when necessary, they'll stand up reasonably to what a coffee shop has to offer-- especially the CJ4000, which can last for years if treated right."

Coffee,3cva0c,SleepyLizard,14,Sat Jul 11 01:45:51 2015 UTC,"That happened to me when I first started out too. Doing it correctly will only come with time and practice, but here's something that had helped me a lot:   Tamp as you would normally Lift up the tamper and gently place it over the portafilter at eye level. Notice towards which direction it leans. Fix your tamp accordingly. Some people might be thumb heavy (puck dips towards where your thumb was pressing) whereas some might be index finger heavy. Get rid of that, and dose again. Tamp again but be mindful of where you're applying your pressure. Polish the puck (give the tamper a spin inside the portafilter to seal off any gaps between the coffee and the portafilter walls. This will help prevent channeling) and re-do the tamp-alignment test (step 2) until you're tamping straight. Insert and brew. It should come out nicer."
Coffee,3cva0c,VodkaWithSnowflakes,2,Sat Jul 11 03:59:10 2015 UTC,"This is how my trainer was diagnosing my shots, at eye-level. Seems like im thumb-heavy, but I often over-compensate where the other side is then uneven hah. You're right though, as my trainer said too: it's just repeating it until it's right."
Coffee,3cva0c,Anomander,7,Sat Jul 11 12:36:12 2015 UTC,"Does your work have access to a bottomless portafilter?  They're a great tool for diagnosing channeling and working how to correct it if you do.   If so, watch the shot come out the bottom.  Where to flows fastest or blondes soonest is where you're channeling - kinda obvious, yeah?  - and this can be used to apply some correction.  If you have consistent areas, you can adjust your distribution or even move where you place the portafilter to correct for that.  If you have inconsistently-placed but patchy extractions, you're experiencing clumping that isn't being broken up and evened out.  If you're regularly channeling on an edge but not always the same one, you need a distribution method that puts more coffee towards the edges.  If you're having way too slow in the middle, same deal, while if you're running in the middle first, maybe your distribution is creating too much of a dip.   Without, you kinda have to judge entirely based on time vs. weight or volume (weight is far more accurate, your shop may not have trained or want you guys training with weight).  You want your shot over (20 - 30, some number or range chosen by your employer) seconds to fill a set amount of coffee or set weight.  Work on various distribution techniques, attempting to pull four or five shots per same method and checking them all - you don't want to pick a bad method because of a single lucky shot, or ""fix"" something excellent when a bad shot was the outlier result."

Coffee,3cva0c,steezmonster99,4,Sat Jul 11 19:05:09 2015 UTC,"GROOMING - if you're working with a fully manual set up, the one thing that helps greatly is to groom your shot even before you tamp. Consider tamping as the final thing before locking in that basket. When you grind out your dose into the basket, take the side of your finger and move the coffee around and fill in the basket evenly, covering any space where channeling may occur. After this, tamping will be even more effective and will make sure that the puck is uniform and that even extraction will occur."
Coffee,3cva0c,bikemowman,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:00:22 2015 UTC,"I could definitely spend more time grooming. Or practice grooming more efficiently.

Thanks, I'll be more conscious of clumping and uneven distribution pre-tamp"
Coffee,3cva0c,rioter,5,Sat Jul 11 12:51:07 2015 UTC,"Tamping was tough for me too when I first started... and there's surprisingly little info on how to do it correctly around the web. My problems with form were largely resolved when I changed the way I was standing and the angle of my tamping arm. I'll do my best to explain my form but I apologize if it sounds confusing.  Stand so that you are perpendicular to the edge of the table with feet shoulder width apart. If you are right-handed, your right hip should be closest to the table and your left hip should be furthest from the table. With the portafilter in your left hand, reach across the front of your body to rest the portafilter at the edge of the table in a tamping position. It should be resting very sturdily. Hold the tamp in your right hand in a very natural position - imagine that the tamp handle is a door handle and grab it as if you were going to turn the handle. That grip is the grip you should use more or less. Now, form a 90 degree angle with your right elbow. Maintain this 90 degree bend throughout the tamp, you may need to bend at the hips to reach the portafilter and apply pressure.Be sure to maintain a neutral wrist as you are applying pressure.  That's my basic stance when tamping, I exaggerated some of it to help illustrate the form, but I hope you get the idea. This stance and the 90 degree bend in the arm helped a lot with even tamps for me.  As far as actually pressing down evenly, you should let feel dominate and relinquish your efforts to try and measure the tamp with your fingers as it goes down. Push down from the elbow and upper arm and you will make an even tamp. While applying pressure, take a moment to feel how flat or slanted the tamped puck is. Without looking, you can feel whether it is even or slanted. Hope this helps a bit!"
Coffee,3cva0c,ZIING,2,Sat Jul 11 07:45:08 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right about there not being much info. YouTube, with its countless pour over tutorials, has barely any useful tamp videos.   What you've detailed really well is pretty much exactly what I've  been taught in my shop. When I say that my height might be interfering with the process, it's because I just can't get that 90 degree angle on the low counter. I'll have to find another position. My trainer recommended tilting the portafikter which I might give a try. As for just feeling it, you might be right. My trainer said I'm probably overthinking it hah. I'll try just using the Force."

Coffee,3cva0c,I_lie_50_percent,3,Sat Jul 11 19:05:56 2015 UTC,I am also pretty tall and struggle with applying waaay too much pressure. Try tamping with less pressure than you think you need.
Coffee,3cva0c,I_lie_50_percent,2,Sat Jul 11 03:20:05 2015 UTC,"IMHO, the best practice is to keep your thumb pointing straight down and elbows straight up.   As far as holding the tamper. Thumb runs parallel to the handle and use both thumb and index to ensure even tamping."
Coffee,3cva0c,I_lie_50_percent,2,Sat Jul 11 08:41:30 2015 UTC,"I've found that using thumb and forefinger to gauge how tilted your tamp is in the basket... lightly tamp, rotate (to feel if your tamp is level) and then aplly pressure. Repeat once more to ensure that your full pressure tamp was level as well, and go for it!"
Coffee,3cva0c,Whiskyandtinder,2,Sat Jul 11 14:26:35 2015 UTC,"Tamp with less pressure - you're less likely to tamp unevenly because you're not putting so much force on the portafilter and you'll reduce your chances of injuring yourself. Remember - you only need to tamp hard enough to remove any pockets of air in the basket and to make the bed flat, any harder is a waste of time."

Real gourmet stuff. The sort of stuff that puts your average high street coffee shop to shame. Most people here will insist on having whole beans that are less than 10 days post-roast. Many will have a standing order with a local roaster. Others will go so far as to roast their own. Rather than asking which Lavazza roast is better, you're more likely to find people here asking which Yirgacheffe is fruitiest.   So, here's the answer: all those pre-ground supermarket bought coffees are stale. It doesn't matter if they're a Lavazza vacuum packed brick or an Illy canister filled with some inert gas - they've all been roasted months ago, then ground and have sat around on shelves losing any real flavours that they might have had.  But I'll tell you what ... next time you're in the neighbourhood, call on over ... I'll make you a coffee and you can decide for yourself."

Coffee,3cyag9,skippgil,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:22:24 2015 UTC,"Others have already expanded on what I said above. A cheap hand grinder and some fresh beans is a great place to start. The Skerton is good if you're not going to be put off by cranking that handle for 5 minutes each time you want to make a pot (40g of coffee for a 600 ml pot). There are better hand grinders and there are decent electric grinders sub-300 but you have to decide for yourself the level of investment you're willing to make.   I can tell you this: if you decide to try fresh roast, fresh ground coffee then you will be surprised by the variety of tastes that you get. Real coffee is much more varied than the options you have from a supermarket. You get sweetness, chocolate, fruit, acidity, toffee ... all in different amounts. Enjoy your first incursion into the rabbit hole."
Coffee,3cyag9,skippgil,2,Sun Jul 12 10:26:22 2015 UTC,"Just to be helpful and add on to the top post, your next purchase online should be a Hario Skerton hand grinder. You can get one on Amazon for less than 30 bucks. It's awesome, and will let you grind whole bean coffee for your French press. I think you'll really enjoy the difference in grinding your coffee fresh and tasting what each has to offer!   You'll want to use a 15:1 ratio of water to beans (by weight) or you can measure by converting tablespoons/scoops of coffee to ounce of water. The ratio thing is totally based on preference, I like my French press strong and therefore my ratio is less water and more grinds.   You can probably find a local roaster in your area on Google, or post on here and get recommendations for a spot near you or even an online roaster that ships to your door. The top post said it best -- most beans are best enjoyed 10 days or less after they are roasted, and furthermore, 15 minutes or less after they are ground.   In the meantime, visit a cafe or two that serves quality coffee and figure out what fits your flavor profile the best before purchasing a whole pound or 12oz bag. If there isn't a great spot, most Starbucks even have a selection of single origin beans from all over the world. They aren't fresh, and are oft over-roasted, but it's still a good place to start to determine your taste preferences.   Good, freshly coffee goes anywhere from 15-22 dollars per pound, but you can get better deals if you look around.  Enjoy and welcome!"

It's $175 but considered by most to last a lifetime. I bought one this week and it should arrive on Monday.   Other than the Lido 2, common choices are the Hario Skerton or Mini Mill or Porlex. These are significantly cheaper than the Lido 2 and while they do a decent job on the finer side of the grind spectrum, you will still get boulders if you are attempting to get a coarser grind.

They could have priced it at $199 and I might have bought it, but advertising at $175 with ridiculous shipping made it a pass for me.   Actually, I take that back. I once ordered a wooden crate of Russian surplus ammo and shipping is about $23 for 50+ pounds of ammo. A 3 pound hand-sized grinder shouldn't cost that much to ship.

I jumped straight from a Bodum Bistro, considered an Encore, but ended up with the Lido. I've had a chance to compare the grind sizes from my Lido against the Bistro, a Hario Skerton, and a Baratza Virtuoso. Beat all 3 hands down in terms of grind consistency. Personally, I wanted to get something that I wouldn't have to replace for a while so I decided to pony up for the Lido. But the Encore is definitely a solid piece for the price."

Very sturdy, very fast and easy to grind, and with the foldable handle and travel bag it should be easy to take with me on trips should I want to. Oh, and the biggest thing, the grind is close to perfect and makes amazing coffee.  The 2 is cheaper (keep in mind the price gap goes away if you add in the free spinning knob on the 3 and a 2 travel case), may look better to some people (though I like the black of the 3), and has a faster but more difficult to turn burr. The consistency is supposedly about the same, but the 2 does have an easier to use adjustment range."
Coffee,3cx6iy,CommunistWitchDr,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:01:04 2015 UTC,"Yup, the Lido 3 looks great. I went with the 2 because I think I'll prefer the aggressive burs, plus I wanted the glass jar and silver colorway."

Coffee,3cx6iy,CommunistWitchDr,2,Sun Jul 12 16:56:27 2015 UTC,"I've got the hario skerton and it's great. It's easy to use and clean, and it's not expensive. Also the grinder part can screw onto Mason jars as well, so if you break your original jar or need additional ones, they're easy to find.   Also for chemex, I find it does a pretty good job at an even grind with no chunks. I set it at 6 for chemex with a kone."

Take a mug (preferably 14-16 oz) and fill it about 1/3 the way full with Mexican coke (american coke probs works just fine.) Then add a shot of espresso. WAKE UP ITS TIME FOR TURBO COKE. Folks seem to either be disgusted that they love it or disgusted because they hate it so much. Never really had an in-betweener.

Caffè Pedrocchi. It's named after the café itself, which is very old and located in Padova, Italia. It's absolutely unreal.  It's a rich, thick, creamy drink with zesty chocolate on top and minty crème fraîche as a sort of base. It's both hot and cold at the same time, as the crème sort of floats on the espresso. You sip the coffee through the crème. The flavour hits in waves, with chocolate and sharp coffee coming first, followed by a creamy washout and minty finish. It's absolutely excellent, and worth going out of your way to try. Padova is a charming little city, not unlike Bologna's little sister, and they do have the best coffee drink I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing.  Here's a picture of some caffès Pedrocchi.

Instead do a cold brew overnight in a french press in your refigerator (lacking a french press just use any old jar and just use a coffee filter or piece of cheese cloth to filter the grounds out). This is to minimize the oil content which, as I mentioned, will go rancid during the aging process.  Also you can head over to /r/Homebrewing for all your beer making questions."

Coffee,3cwj9f,StereoHeathen,2,Sat Jul 11 11:20:21 2015 UTC,"I think people express ratios in many ways that is just the primary style. I agree though, I alway talk about ratios in relation to how much brewed coffee I want to make not how much dried coffee I have."
Coffee,3cwj9f,writesgoods,2,Sat Jul 11 12:41:36 2015 UTC,"20:30 is equal to 66,66% and 20:40 is 50%. Maybe people are used to this way of measure due to displays sizes. A 16:9 wide screen (1,777), 16:10 (1.6)."
Coffee,3cwj9f,protoUbermensch,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:21:43 2015 UTC,"Convert the ratio to a fraction and you have your answer. 20/40 = 0.5, or 50%."
Coffee,3cwj9f,pig_is_pigs,2,Sun Jul 12 03:31:17 2015 UTC,"Right, but this doesn't answer my question. As stated, I understand how it's derived, but why do it this way around and not the other? I want to state how much liquid I'm pulling out of my coffee, not how much coffee I put into the basket."
Coffee,3cwj9f,pig_is_pigs,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:25:47 2015 UTC,"The why is because we usually state our ratios in the form of input/output. That's something like a recipe: you can't measure an output before measuring an input. So if you place those numbers in chronological order, you've given yourself a fraction that yields 50% rather than 200%.  However, the inverse also messes with the implications of the ratio. A 50% ratio using input/output (20/40) is lower in strength than a 100% ratio (20/20). If you flip that, then a 200% ratio is lower in strength than a 100%, which doesn't logically make a lot of sense. If you want to use ratios as a training tool, you'd have to also give instructions on mentally calculating the changes in strength using an inverse rate. That's not a huge hurdle, but it does pile on to everything else involved in training espresso.  In a practical sense it doesn't matter which way you decide to parse the ratio, because it means the same thing in the basket and in the cup. 200% = 50%, have it either way. Just be consistent."

And when you take that and want to know it in percentage, well 1 = 100%, .66 = 66%, .5 = 50%  Its done this way because its the proper way to define mixing ratios.

Coffee,3cur0u,lampsu,11,Fri Jul 10 23:00:49 2015 UTC,"My general experience in visiting new local roasters is that if you're generally nice and friendly to them, they're nice and friendly in return. Doesn't hurt to start off with saying, ""Hi, this is my first time. Can I ask for a recommendation of a light/medium/dark roast?"" But since you have a roast in mind already, you can ask for their opinion on it. Maybe mention your brewing method and see if they'd like to recommend something else as well. Nothing to be  nervous about! Just bask in the ambiance of a shop that's all about coffee coffee coffee."
Coffee,3cur0u,Meitachi,7,Fri Jul 10 23:45:38 2015 UTC,"Nothing to be nervous about,  we all had our first time. Ha.  Anyway,  in my experience shops will not carry everything they list on their website,  and roasting is a long process so most shops only do it once or twice a week (at least smaller shops,  bigger shops typically roast more often but at a different location.)    If I were you,  if they don't have the beans you were looking for,  ask them about they have (ie,  which would they recommend,  what are the flavor notes,  are they brewing in the shop,  if so could you sample it?)  at any shop worth their snuff,  all the employees can talk intelligently about their offerings.   Good luck,  but I'm sure you won't need it."

Coffee,3cur0u,w_nights,4,Sat Jul 11 04:36:32 2015 UTC,"I get very anxious about going to new types of shops   Don't worry about it, everyone has that type of feeling to some extent when getting into what is essential a new subculture to them. When I got into sneakers I felt a bit weird going into speciality shops because I didn't ""look"" like a Sneakerhead but eventually you feel comfortable and realize most people just like to share knowledge and excitement.    Do roasters generally carry all of the varieties that are listed in their website in-store?   In my experience, yes. There is a a lot of ""first come, first serve"" type of thing and sometimes the websites may not update fast enough.    And if they don't, will they roast it fresh for you, or do you just have to buy something else/come back another day?    Most roasters roast on a particular day and then sell for that week, so a ""on the spot"" roast is highly unlikely.    I've just never done this before and am getting more anxious the more I think about it.   Like I said, think of it as a physical /r/coffee interaction.

Coffee,3cur0u,magiccoffeetruck,3,Fri Jul 10 23:50:58 2015 UTC,"My main question is do roasters generally carry all of the varieties that are listed in their website in-store?   They should, especially when they're on that scale.  We're substantially smaller and 90% of the time, we carry everything we advertise on our website in stock.  The few times that's not the case, we've either failed to update our website (note: to be specific, I have failed, it is my responsibility :s) or we've received a surprise large order and roasting is scheduled for tomorrow.     And if they don't, will they roast it fresh for you, or do you just have to buy something else/come back another day?   I would advise immediate distrust of anyone who offers to immediate roast-to-order of something they're out of stock on.    I don't think we should be letting anything leave the plant until it's had at least two days rest to degas, coffee fresh off the drum is pretty bad and most need between two and five days to ""settle"" properly.    Most roasters, especially large roasters, use a machine with a minimum batch size between 30 and 50 pounds, and the machine takes ~an hour to come up to temperature and another two to cool enough to shut down and go home after roasting.    If you really want that one and are nervous they may be out of stock, simply call ahead."

I think most of our coffee is at its best from day 8 to day 16.

That being said, their roasting style is among the lightest in the industry, and while they generally do some of the best job with the style it's often unapproachable.   If you're in Portland, your water is going to be working for you (low TDS waters tend to be more aggressive at pulling out sweetness and less aggressive at pulling out acidity, or, well suited to extracting light roasts) but outside of Portland, I can't say I've had a properly extracted cup or shot of coffee from Heart, and good luck to the home brewer."

All of which have done the coffee justice. For what it's worth, I think they're way better about really developing their roasts than they were a few years ago... which probably isn't saying a lot, when they used to be ""ultra light"" for most roasts and now generally skirt ""very light"". None of that makes them not my favorite, though neither does it discount fine roasters like Sterling, Coava, Water Ave, or even Stumptown. But if I have to pick one absolute, it has to be Heart."

You don't want to let the fact that you've two different coffees confuse your testing on aging, after all.    Or maybe just call the roaster directly, ask if you can buy a two pounds of the same coffee, one old and one fresh.  Most won't have anything immediately available (most places either sell through or dispose of old stock rather than sell stale) but if you ask nicely they may have a QA division that keeps a back catalogue of samples to some extent or other.  I have samples going back four batches of each origin at a given profile, which is usually a month to a month and a half or so."

Coffee,3cvzbw,Tallm,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:39:27 2015 UTC,"Don't just ask your supplier for fresh bean because most will say ""we only sell fresh bean"". They have to move their bean. To make your own mind up, ask a reputable roaster for the actual days that they roast. Show up later that day and buy a small quantity of bean that came out. Store it air-tight for two days (this is when it's at its optimum point for brewing, because it needs two days to off-gas most of the carbon dioxide) and then start the following test:  Pull one bean out everyday and chew it up good, taking notes of the flavor. Do this once every day for two weeks.   Oxidation is what stales coffee and most of it occurs up front. You'll notice that days 2-3 are very fresh and the flavor notes will jump out, and then it goes down hill from there. Days 4-6 will still reflect these notes but they'll be in the background. Days 6-10 will just taste like coffee, but without the distinct notes that separate varieties from eachoter. This is my experience from cupping about 300 coffee roasts.  One other thing to note is that fresh roast doesn't always equate to good coffee. For example, an underdeveloped roast will be missing flavor and taste very acidic. An overdeveloped roast will be missing flavor and just taste empty, and sometimes burnt/ashy depending how deep they went."

To me, the stale coffee tasted dead. There wasn't much flavor at all. The freshly-ground coffee had flavors. Some of those flavors were offensive, but, hey, it had something. Granted, I didn't try very hard to dial in the grind (just tried to make it look reasonably close to what my better grinder is dialed in to), but a big part of the problem with blade grinders is that you really do that.  My suggestion: try it yourself! Grind some of the coffee, then try it a few days later and see what you think. From my experience, one's preference could go either way.  But if you are pre-grinding your coffee, it's probably not worth it to spend much on your beans. Anything that was special about them will be gone by the time you brew."

Coffee,3ctk79,eddied96,3,Sat Jul 11 01:36:45 2015 UTC,"I'd say it depends on what you're using to brew it with. If your machine needs a courser grind to produce a better pot (French press, moka pot, etc), I wouldn't worry about it. If you're going for a finer grind (drip brewing, etc.) you might notice a difference.  If you decide to grind at the store, I'd store it in some tupperware and put it in the fridge. You're less likely to have the oils evaporate on you with something with a good seal and it being temperature controlled.  Edit: you'll fine a lot of people have distinct feelings toward quality of grinder. Personally, I think that, at times, it can be similar to wine snobbery that has more to do with perception than actual taste difference.

If you use a low quality grinder, you will never produce a good brew, so for 2 weeks your coffee will be inferior, and it will not change. But if you get it ground on a good grinder, then you will start out making excellent coffee and the ground coffee will gradually get stale. How long it will take until you notice is going to be highly variable. It might be on day 2, or it might be on day 13, who knows? But just because it starts to lose its freshness does not mean it's ""bad"". It will only be bad when it is sufficiently stale, and you may or may not notice this for a while.   tl;dr - get your coffee ground when you buy the beans, and you will at least have good coffee for  a time"
Coffee,3ctk79,unawino,7,Fri Jul 10 18:14:04 2015 UTC,"Saying you'll never get good brew out of a cheap grinder is a bit ridiculous to me. It really depends on the brew method IMO. I've gotten lots of good brew when I had a Hario Mini Mill and used an Aeropress. Espresso? I wouldn't even try. French Press? Not really. Pourover? Very hit or miss, but still better than older grounds.   I would take fresh ground in a lesser grinder for my aeropress any day over days old grind from the shop. It just doesn't seem as picky to me as far as brew output is concerned. Probably the same if I ever used an auto drip machine.  And I'm assuming it has a lot to do with climate, but where I am ground coffee has probably 3 days until it's not much better than cheap grocery store stuff."

Coffee,3ctk79,data_double,-1,Fri Jul 10 19:02:17 2015 UTC,But the Hario is a low quality grinder.
Coffee,3ctk79,JethroMcClintock,2,Fri Jul 10 22:30:26 2015 UTC,"You're just being contrary. The Hario Mini Mill is an immense step up from the truly ""low quality"" grinders, ie, blade grinders and cheap electric flat burr grinders. It is not going to compete with ""high quality"" grinders, but it has its place, and many serious coffee enthusiasts use the Hario (and similar grinders) for travel, backup, etc, and it produces pretty acceptable results."

Coffee,3ctk79,SeventhMagus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:54:17 2015 UTC,I'm currently visiting my parents and only have access to a blade grinder. Shaking while grinding improves consistency. I'd say my pour overs are about 80% (+-10%) as good as when I was using my Encore burr grinder. Don't grind two weeks worth as a blade grinding fresh beans will be very superior compared to a few days old ground beans.

But a bad grinder will turn the world's best, freshest beans into garbage immediately.  Edit: If you disagree, could you please be more specific about what you disagree with? I've done lots of testing and tasting, and to my palate, the degradation of coffee happens slower than ""common knowledge"" says. It's certainly not an absolute that coffee ground yesterday will make undrinkable coffee today. But it is an absolute that a bad grinder will produce a range of grind sizes that cannot produce a properly extracted brew.

Coffee,3ctk79,thiroks,2,Fri Jul 10 23:53:12 2015 UTC,"Yes. If the grind size is inconsistent, then you've got a lot of small particles that will extract very fast, while the large particles extract very slowly. So you end up with coffee that is bitter from all the over extracted small particles, yet weak at the same time from the under extracted large particles. As grinder quality increases, the result is a smaller range of particles sizes, and thus more even extraction across all the particles, which gives you better tasting coffee."

The burr grinders cheaper than that aren't worth the cost, blade grinders even less so; while the cheapest ""tier"" is typically looking at ~$130+.  The Baratza Encore is my go-to entry level burr grinder, and it retails for $129 pretty much everywhere in the states - do not expect or count on any advertised sales below this price point.    Given that you scoped the Lido, I figure no aversion to manual grinders? The Hario Skerton or Porlex are both great hand grinders, and the Handground is a more recent release getting decent hype that I've not had a shot at testing out."

I think I got the last of the scratch and dent ones. They're on sale for $95.86 right now, though, which isn't too bad, and I've seen them as low as $90 recently for different colors. Works great for pourover, definitely doesn't go fine enough for espresso. I have an Encore that I use most of the time, but I wanted something to replace my Skerton when I'm home from college, since I got tired of spending 10-15 minutes grinding every day.   Make sure you give it a decent tap on the counter to get the last bit or it'll retain about 1.5g of grounds. Other than that, it grinds fast, has pretty even particles, and works pretty damn well for the price."

Coffee,3ctlvg,PoorRover,2,Fri Jul 10 17:52:56 2015 UTC,"Mostly good advice and analogy, except... you do not fix under extraction by changing the brew ratio. If your coffee is too weak or too strong, then you change the brew ratio, but that is different than under or over extraction. In order to compare your brewing techniques fairly, you must hold the brew ratio constant."
Coffee,3ctlvg,unawino,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:24:23 2015 UTC,"Practically speaking, yes, it's better to change other variables first (namely grind size).

Every office I've worked at, I've ""fixed"" their bitter (and weak) drip brews by doubling the amount of grounds in the basket. I could be wrong, but this is what I've been working from for a while.   (btw I didn't downvote you -- I appreciate your comment, thanks!)"
Coffee,3ctlvg,unawino,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:36:52 2015 UTC,"Brew ratio determines strength. That is the definition of coffee strength. Extraction is independent of strength. I refer you to the standard coffee brewing control chart.  BTW I really like your ice cube analogy. It does illustrate pretty well what you're aiming for. But to improve it a little (maybe), suppose your ice was made of salt water, and in addition to achieving a perfect 100F temperature, you also had to achieve a certain salinity in the resulting brew. If you melt too much ice, you get too much salt. If you use too much water to achieve the right final temperature, then your final salinity is less. Or, said another way, weaker. I'm not sure this is a perfect analogy but I think it is."

Coffee,3ctlvg,unawino,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:24:02 2015 UTC,"Brew ratio determines strength. That is the definition of coffee strength. Extraction is independent of strength.   This isn't adding up for me. I thought strength was the TDS of extracted solids in the final cup. For instance, I can use a really high brew ratio and pour the water fast over really large (french press) grinds, and the result is still gonna be water with a slight coffee flavor. Seems to me strength is a combination of brew ratio and extraction.  Looking at the standard chart you reference, notice that it's the diagonal lines that represent ratios, and all those ratio lines eventually move upwards into the ""strong"" zone if they extracted for long enough...  Or what have I missed?"

The cocoa butter will coat the tonge, and this can cause a delay in flavour release.  Next you might have some suppression of matching aromatics - coffee and chocolate contain a lot of similar compounds as both products involve roasting so the Maillard reaction (this synergy is why they pair so well). However, if you have a similar compound - the more you taste of it the less you perceive it. This will change your perception of the coffee slightly too."

Coffee,3csn42,GodspeedSelf,2,Fri Jul 10 15:09:04 2015 UTC,"Yes this is possible.  MSG, for example, stimulates the taste receptors for the Umami sensation.  It is why MSG can make meats taste very good, and it can even make meals with no meat in them taste meaty.  This is why Asian foods, among others, often contain the substance.  Somebody correct me if I am wrong as it has been a while since I have studied physiology, but it is not that chocolate wakes up the taste buds so you can taste the complexity of coffee, it is more that the chemicals in coffee and chocolate together stimulate the taste buds in such a way that it creates a nerve impulse, that coffee and chocolate alone cannot create, that the brain interprets as tasting good.

What actually bothers me, though, is how weak their coffees look with the steep times they're mentioning. 9 hours of steeping with no agitation yields coffee much darker than they have. 9 hours with lots of vibration should cause further extraction. They're either not grinding their beans at all, or they're using incredibly low amounts of coffee.

I'd probably go for one of these over just about any cold brew out there (it really is rather nice, and I think the idea that cold brew is ""sweet"" is one of the industry's naked emperors) except at $6.50 for a ~8 Oz. glass, I'm not in a hurry to order another.

If you've had cold brew before, that's essentially the experience you'll get out of it. There is not nearly as much complexity and nuance as the hype would suggest; it is simply a very well produced cold extracted coffee. Silky mouth feel, sweet front with a subdued body, brief afterimage. Very tea-like, great as a pair to a scone or something. The differences between the hours are what you would expect. 13 is fuller than the 9, closer to an earl grey, while the 9 could be compared to a white tea or a tisane.   7/10, not revoutionary, ignore hype, enjoy it as a well crafted cold one."

Right now I only have a Keurig (I'm sorry, don't hate me), but was wondering what I should get to make the best iced coffee. I've seen things on Starbucks' emails such as this cold brew kit and this pour over iced coffee brewer. I'm pretty flexible and like almost all coffee. I'm also in medical school so stronger would be better.   Thank you!"
Coffee,3cssd9,jja619,3,Fri Jul 10 14:50:41 2015 UTC,"Cold Brew will be ""stronger"" as you generally use a higher coffee:water ratio that you can later dilute. Or not if you want a nice caffeine kick. =D   Iced Pour Over/Japanese Iced is generally more refreshing and crisp. Not as muddy/malty as CB.  I generally make cold brew if I have a large excess of beans that I don't think I can get through in a timely manner, to have a quick source of caffeine on hand, or if I see a cool recipe that has it as an ingredient. It also mixes well with cream/milk.  Japanese Iced is what I make when I want something refreshing similar to unsweet iced tea. I just drink it black. It's great and doesn't require the 12+ hour forethought."
Coffee,3cssd9,whiskeysnowcone,2,Fri Jul 10 15:07:37 2015 UTC,I agree. I enjoy the Japanese method the best. I have a Melitta pour-over brewer that I use to make iced coffee. I just use half the amount of water I use and replace it with ice in the cup the coffee drains into with ice.   I usually shoot for 25 grams of coffee grounds and use 375-400 grams of water. If I make iced coffee I just use 200 grams of ice in the cup and 200 grams of water to brew with. Makes a very clean and refreshing cup of coffee.

Simple, easy home cold brew. Plus, now you have a french press for simple but delicious hot coffee.

Coffee,3cssd9,jja619,3,Fri Jul 10 22:48:08 2015 UTC,"As far as texturing, you can steam any of those, they'll just require different amounts of aeration. And it'll differ from brand to brand depending on quality and other factors.  The taste will probably be the biggest change. Whole milk is the specialty coffee standard, but you can do fine with other fat levels. My wife finds whole milk too heavy, so I've switched to 2% at home... for now..."

Coffee,3cssd9,koffeekev,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:48:11 2015 UTC,"you can't use a monarch on a burner? i really like using my buono on a burner (especially induction...oh my, the fun!) so that the whole kettle is HOT before i use it to pour. i've done transfers in the past, but i think on longer extractions like chemexes, i can flirt with less than 195 brew beds."

Apparently pouring from a boiling Bonavita gooseneck with no preheating in the Monarch ends up about 202-205 to start and stays over 200 in the kettle during the brew according to a post I found on coffeegeek. So I suppose with preheating it could work out pretty well."

Coffee,3cssd9,SleepyLizard,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:00:00 2015 UTC,"The quickest and cheapest way to go from newbie to great coffee is to use a French Press. You can get a good cheap one at Ikea. Get some beans, not too dark, and grind them on a very coarse setting (if you don't have a grinder right away and just want to see if you like non-instant, you can grind at the grocery store).  The standard ratio of coffee:water is 1:16, so for example 22g of coffee and 352 ml of water.  Boil your water, wait 30 seconds. Put the coffee in the Press and pour your water. Give it a gentle stir and then put the cap on the press. Wait 4 mins. Once time's up, push the handle down and then pour!  EDIT: I should also mention that there's tons of further info in the sidebar ------>"
Coffee,3cssd9,CommunistWitchDr,2,Sun Jul 12 02:00:59 2015 UTC,"I think a Clever, Aeropress, or even a pourover that doesn't absolutely require a gooseneck would be a better start. French press just isn't at it's best with a cheap starter grinder."
Coffee,3cssd9,SleepyLizard,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:51:35 2015 UTC,"But I'm  assuming he doest have a grinder. Yours are all for sure good starts, but an immersion brew just doesn't require the same attention to detail, and French press is definitely the most accessible immersion method. If he's grinding grocery store coffee at the grocery store, I think Press the way to go."
Coffee,3cssd9,CommunistWitchDr,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:57:12 2015 UTC,"So am I. French press also requires an extremely high quality grinder to do right. If he later wants one, the lower end hand grinders are pretty much out of the picture and even some commonly recommended electrics aren't ideal.  The clever and aeropress are both immersion as well, but don't need a nice grinder and have much quicker cleanup. I'd argue that as long as you live in the US and can use Amazon, french press is the least accessible common immersion method by far."
Coffee,3cssd9,GroundDweller,0,Sun Jul 12 16:42:47 2015 UTC,"There are many ways to do so but I'll go with the subreddit's standard method for beginners: the aeropress. It is an inexpensive device that can be used to make very good coffee quite easily. You can find it on Amazon somewhere, it comes with free filters so no need to spend extra on those at the start.  You will need to grind your beans. You can use pre-ground coffee which will be miles better than instant but not quite as good-tasting as freshly ground beans. If you choose to use beans that haven't been ground before you buy them, you will need a grinder. You can get a Hario Mini Mill or Skerton hand grinder for pretty cheap (like £20 or so) which will be good enough for a while. These are adjustible to make the grind bigger (coarser) or smaller (finer). It's worth experimenting with this to see what works well - personally I find 10 clicks from closed to work well for Aeropress coffee. This might seem like a fair bit of effort but it's worth it, trust me,  As for actually brewing coffee with these things, there are many methods to be found on the net. I am a fan of this one by Heart but again I recommend trying different methods by other people as well - after all half the fun is experimenting! I highly recommend you use a good set of scales and some kind of timer (your phone will do) as they do in the video as it pays to be precise. There is an app that has lots of different methods which it times for you, telling you at what times you need to do different parts of the brew method  I'm not sure if my post makes it all sound difficult or requiring a lot of effort but I promise you that it's all really quite simple. Don't be put off if your first few cups aren't amazing, you'll quickly get the hang of it all."

Coffee,3cssd9,_dustin_,2,Fri Jul 10 20:06:12 2015 UTC,"yes you can change the grind size, and it works fine for the aeropress. the stabilizer is just a washer (maybe? i think) or something to keep the burr from ""wobbling"" as much as it does, which causes an even bigger variance in particle size."

Coffee,3cssd9,rioter,3,Fri Jul 10 21:11:29 2015 UTC,If it is draining quicker it means it has less contact time with the coffee. This will more than likely result in under extraction. You could adjust your grind(make it finer) to compensate.
Coffee,3cssd9,anonmarmot,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:22:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response!  A follow up question, does a finer grind impact the flavor? (or is the grind really just to determine the water exposure time... which impacts the flavor?)"
Coffee,3cssd9,Anomander,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:28:40 2015 UTC,"Sure does, but in the way you speculate in the latter half.    A finer grind extracts faster, as water reaches the core of the particle sooner and has less denisity to overcome in unlocking taste.    So it won't change how the coffee tastes, but you are more likely to get to ideal extraction sooner, and to get to overextraction sooner as well.    Meanwhile, a finer grind also ""holds on"" to water better as well, slowing the flow of water through your slurry.  ...So a finer grind allows your coffee to extract (both ideal and over-) faster, while slowing the passage of water and extending water exposure.  It can be a compounding failure to over-fine your grind size."

Coffee,3cssd9,wdswds,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:22:25 2015 UTC,"I just started drinking coffee and I am using a french press with fresh beans ground coarse at home with my hario hand grinder. I'm methodically changing things to see what I like best. Here are the variables I have so far:  Water:Bean Ratio  Bean Grain size  Water Temp.  Brew time  and then I have the amount of cream and sugar that I add.  Currently, I like a 1:20 ratio, I put 12g of beans for every cup of water. I pour at 190F.  at the start of the timer, I pour about a cup in and let the coffee bloom. I wait 30 seconds, then pour the rest of the water in and then stir for about 15 seconds. Then I put the lid on and bring the filter down to just above the coffee, touching the foam.  At this point, a lot of grinds are floating at the top, so i swirl the entire press around to get them moving and off the surface, is that fine to do? does it make a difference? After 4 minutes from when I started, I push the filter all the way down and pour.  Am I missing anything?"

If so, once you press the filter down, you could let everything settle and then pour.   If you like the overall resulting brew, I think you are probably doing it right :)  Agitation won't hurt anything. I'm not sure that if you are stirring before you press the filter that's going to make a huge difference.  Do you decant or use everything? Otherwise it will continue to brew."

Coffee,3cssd9,RelativityCoffee,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:51:14 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, if you like it better than the alternatives, then you're doing it right.   A few things I would change, just to see if you like them.   1) Raise ratio. 1:20 is pretty weak, especially for an immersion method. Have you tried 1:15 or 1:16?   2) Raise temp. SCAA guidelines are between 205 and 195, and you're starting off below that, plus once you pour and the water sits it's losing temp. I use boiling water.   3) After the initial 30 second bloom, I stir before pouring in the rest of the water. I think that helps settle the grounds a bit more."
Coffee,3cssd9,wdswds,2,Sat Jul 11 15:25:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you!    That's on my list of things to change.  I remember reading that the coffee can burn at temperatures above 190°F, it's on my list of things to change as well.  I think I already do that.    Thanks!"
Coffee,3cssd9,wdswds,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:29:59 2015 UTC,I remember reading that the coffee can burn at temperatures above 190°F   This is complete hogwash. The beans are roasted above 400 degrees Fahrenheit; they won't burn due to water that's half that temperature.

Getting a great cup will be, because there's no way to guarantee a great cup with a blade grinder;  you just have to get lucky. With a burr grinder, you can follow a method more consistently.   Blade grinders spin indiscriminately. They don't recognize the size of the particles; they just keep spinning. Almost always, some beans will end up quartered, while others will end up pulverized into a fine dust. When you immerse, the bean quarters will be underextracted and sour, and the dust will be overextracted and bitter."

I'm pretty sure better ingredients going in means a better product coming out, as long as I don't screw up the process.  Can any of you recommend a good coffee to try out for my first batch? I have a tiny little drip brewer that I got with the apartment."
Coffee,3cssd9,cuatrofluoride,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:17:08 2015 UTC,"Are you asking about coffee to mix with the kahlua, or just in general?  Really, if you want to get a start in good coffee the first step is just to get a cup made with freshly roasted, freshly ground beans. Regardless of brand/roaster, you'll notice a difference and can figure out what you like from there."
Coffee,3cssd9,trojanwing,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:04:52 2015 UTC,"Well, I think generally good coffee will make better kahlua. So in general, but that's what I'm doing with it.  OK, where does one get fresh beans to freshly roast, and what do I need to roast them? I've also seen a ton on here about different brewing methods."
Coffee,3cssd9,das_hep,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:02:45 2015 UTC,"You don't need to roast them yourself, just find a local coffee shop that roasts or order online. Typically the beans will be ""good"" for about two weeks after roasting. What's more important is that you grind them right before brewing (hand grinders are cheapest).   Brewing methods are just different ways to experience the same coffee. The cheapest and easiest to get started with are a french press or aeropress, which are immersion methods that don't require too much fancy equipment. Pourovers get a little more complicated because you need a kettle and a more involved technique.   I'd recommend starting with finding beans to buy and grinding them at home, then brewing them with whatever method you have available. You'll notice the difference right away and from there you can decide what other brew methods to explore."

I have a lot of trouble shaking and tilting and smacking this machine to remove the last 500mg that I don't want to come out in my next grind in case it's a different grind setting. A follow-up question - does 500mg of the previous day's grind affect the taste much?     How important is water temperature in immersion brewers? With the Aeropress I have gotten vastly different cups by varying temperature and keeping all other things constant, but I don't have a thermometer so I end up eyeballing the amount of cold water mixed with boiling water. Does anyone have any tips on checking water temp without a thermometer?"
Coffee,3cssd9,eddied96,2,Mon Jul 13 14:41:18 2015 UTC,"grinding a small amount of coffee (a few beans) before grinding what you'll brew will usually purge the old grounds.

Coffee,3crlky,Jeikobu1,7,Fri Jul 10 05:21:18 2015 UTC,It might just be the lighting but that looks a little under roasted
Coffee,3crlky,trevor__,8,Fri Jul 10 06:17:01 2015 UTC,Agreed.  They almost looked baked rather than roasted.  The real question is how is the coffee?  What method did you use?  Did you hear the crack?  Glad you had fun!
Coffee,3crlky,IranRPCV,6,Fri Jul 10 06:59:15 2015 UTC,I used an air Popper style popcorn machine. I'm fairly certain I got to the start of second crack but hard to tell over the machine. Went about ten minutes as most tutorials recommended. Haven't brewed it yet as I'm letting then rest a day first.
Coffee,3crlky,IranRPCV,6,Fri Jul 10 07:21:15 2015 UTC,"Even if the coffee continues to improve over a few days, I have never seen the harm in trying some just off roast.

I always like to see people catching the joy of roasting their own."
Coffee,3crlky,IranRPCV,2,Fri Jul 10 07:25:17 2015 UTC,That sounds wicked. I'm excited regardless of the first step :p. The photos are actually the second batch. I did a smaller trial run earlier and made it in a moka pot. Though I'm new with that method and I think I messed up the grind a bit. Too bitter. If it wasn't 2am I'd try these ones now.   I also just went and compared to some mild roasted Columbian beans I have from a local roaster and mine are ever so slightly darker. Not the city + roast I was aiming for though I'm sure.

Coffee,3crlky,NobleArbre,2,Fri Jul 10 18:45:35 2015 UTC,The picture also belies their true color. For whatever reason under the light of my stove it cranked the brightness of the photo. They are somewhat darker than in the photo. They are comparable to a mild roast Colombian that I bought from a local roaster.  Just brewed some up in an aeropress and there is deffinately the acidity of a light roast. Bright coffee. I'll roast it a little darker next time if i can.

Coffee,3ctrkp,silentspyder,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:51:02 2015 UTC,"There is a bit of a chute that the grounds might get hung up in on the Encore. It might work to just run a few beans through to purge the grinder but that's going to waste a little bit of coffee and, being a college student, I'm guessing you don't want to waste a lot :-)  The other thing is to check the top burr on the Encore.  When you pull it out you should see 3 flanges that hold the burr in place. I've had those get broken off without me even knowing it. Then the top burr ""floats"" and you don't get as even a grind. The only solution is replace the top burr.   That said, if it's only a few boulders that's not likely a problem. More likely stuff stuck in the chute."

Coffee,3cu26l,wolffire99,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:51:22 2015 UTC,"Opinions on this are going to vary. ""Common wisdom"" seems to be that coffee is at its best before it's 2 weeks old. I agree with this, as there is noticeable degradation of flavor beyond that. However, the point at which you find it ""bad"" is going to be highly subjective. I find 3 week old coffee to be decidedly inferior to fresh, but still drinkable, and hence not bad. But because of this being my experience, I strive to never have any coffee older than that, and take whatever steps I need to prevent the situation.   Only you can decide if the cost savings is worth it to you for the older beans. It definitely would not be for me, and having fresh coffee was my primary motivation for getting into home roasting."

However, I can buy beans from the same local roasters at the grocery store for $8-$12 for the same 12oz single origin beans.   Wat????  It's more to buy direct from the roaster than that roasters' coffee through the grocer?    Everyone in our market is opposite, lol.  If you're buying from the roaster, they shave anywhere between a buck or two and the entire wholesale markup (we sell beans at the plant for $10-11; grocery retails $15-18+), though shipping can stack up pretty fast if you're ordering online and want us to mail a pound.    I set a month as my top end; I prefer to buy coffee with a date less than two weeks.  I ain't /u/unawino and I find that I can enjoy coffee up to about a month before staling flavours become intrusive, and could easily enjoy while ignoring staling up to six weeks lifespan ... but I don't want to buy coffee that I have to try and power through in a week 'cause it's dead soon, so select for short roast date all the same."

Sour is usually an indication of underextraction,  so water temp, improper grind size (to coarse), not enough time for bloom or to quick of a press (or incorrect ratios) could all be culprits.   What is the water temp at by the time you start pouring it into your Aeropress? Water sheds heat pretty quickly in non-preheated, non-insulated containers. could be losing a bit of heat between the water dispenser and the aeropress."
Coffee,3cs4d9,Reddit-Hivemind,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:30:03 2015 UTC,"Well in terms of grinding I'm using the Hario Mini Mill - if I'm not wrong it's generally agree that for Aeropress the setting is 6-8 clicks, I'm currently at 7.  The water temperature is 85 degrees Celsius when its resting in a cup. So what I did is I filled half a cup of water, then dunked a typical milk frothing temperature gauge in, and it rose to 85.  I preheat my Aeropress but I assume due to the grounds, the temperature of the water would drop to 80-83 once it hits the grounds.   Recipe-wise I strictly follow the guides in the Aeropress app, usually I go with The Bold, which leaves no time for bloom at all but has something like 45 seconds of straight stirring. I might try a few others that call for some bloom time."

Here is the method I used: -Applied dark soy sauce to the burrs on the moving carrier, put the grinder back together, and dialed to the finest setting. -Took the spinning carrier/burrs off and looked at the stationary burr and found that about 1/3rd of it was covered in soy sauce. -Cleaned everything off, and re-applied soy sauce to the spinning burrs, but replaced the carrier onto the shaft rotated 180 degrees, so that I could see if it was the static or the spinning burr set that was out of alignment. The result was the same, but rotated 180 degrees - the problem was with the spinning burr. -Cleaned everything off again, and rotated the burrs one screw hole (with the carrier being marked, so that I could be sure that the burrs were in a new orientation). -Repeated the soy sauce process -Found that the soy sauce transfered in exactly the same way, which told me that the carrier was the bit that was out of alignment, and the burrs were fine. -Added a small amount of tin foil between the burr and carrier (started w/ 2 layers and went up to 8 layers, and 3 layers in another point, repeating tests between each adjustment) -After adjustments, the soysauce transferred to about 85% of the static burrs. Not perfect, but enough for today.  Here is the picture of the grounds at the same setting as previous: Imgur  (not the best pictures, but maybe you can see the difference - very noticeable irl)  Update: Extraction yield went way up. Was maxing at 19.5~ before, now around 22."

Maybe it has to do with the pre-extraction process where the grounds are introduced to the water prior to the espresso shot being pulled."
Coffee,3cs350,UCSBEE,2,Fri Jul 10 09:07:56 2015 UTC,weigh your coffee post grind and adjust accordingly
Coffee,3cs350,ents,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:13:09 2015 UTC,"The encore is known to retain some grounds, which is really kind of inevitable. Just keep giving it a smack to get the last couple of grams out."
Coffee,3cs350,Marcop0lo,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:05:16 2015 UTC,"That's called grind retention, and yes, it happens."
Coffee,3cs350,jacybear,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:53:05 2015 UTC,Even high end commercial grinders retain a few grams of coffee. There are some models that are designed to minimize retention.
Coffee,3cu00t,zombiebycranberries,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:35:32 2015 UTC,"I think the idea of showcasing small, family-owned coffee farms is really cool and deserves to be more well know   It's certainly well known within specialty coffee, and relatively common.    At least most folks with any Single Origin offerings use this appproach in pitching them, and many pursue this sort of relationship either exclusively or primarily within their products as a marketing and branding strategy."
Coffee,3ctw2p,silverdroid303,2,Fri Jul 10 19:06:45 2015 UTC,"If you didn't get a full shot, then you were underextracting because you haven't hit your desired brew ratio. Sourness is caused by incomplete extractions, basically meaning the flavor balance hasn't shifted enough toward sweetness yet and the acidity is still prominent. A low temperature creates a lower rate of extraction, because there's less heat energy present. A more restricted shot, like you were seeing, also decreases the rate of extraction because the flow rate is much slower. So to get more balance, you would use a coarser grind to increase your flow rate, and get a more reasonable volume in the time you wanted."
Coffee,3ctw2p,pig_is_pigs,2,Fri Jul 10 19:26:21 2015 UTC,"On the original shot, it probably would have taken like 40 seconds to get a full shot.  What would have been the consequence if I would have actually waited for that instead of correctly adjusting the grind for a typical 25 second shot?"
Coffee,3ctw2p,pig_is_pigs,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:44:39 2015 UTC,"At full pressure, you'd likely see some overextraction by the time you hit your desired volume. You can extend espresso extraction time if you use lower pressures, but not every machine is capable of doing so. So changing the grind was likely the best course of action for you."
Coffee,3ctw2p,Crimms,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:14:50 2015 UTC,"If you think about it, everything that affects extraction should affect the taste.  Changes in temperature, grind size, and brew time all affect extraction."
Coffee,3crk2e,james_strange,12,Fri Jul 10 05:05:01 2015 UTC,"I doubt it. Those beans had just been roasted to around 420 degrees. The inside of your car got to what, maybe 140? Give those beans another chance. Even if the heat had some effect, horribly weak brew is not one of the results I would have guessed."
Coffee,3crk2e,unawino,5,Fri Jul 10 05:15:48 2015 UTC,"I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here. Is it not a well known fact that excessive heat is bad for roasted coffee? It increases the rate at which oils evaporate, which leads to less flavour.   Just google 'storing coffee beans heat' and you'll get a bunch of results saying that in order to retain freshness, you should be avoiding open air, moisture, sunlight, and heat.   Horribly weak coffee is exactly what you should expect from beans left in a hot car for an extended period of time."
Coffee,3crk2e,L4MB,3,Fri Jul 10 17:19:34 2015 UTC,"But an hour is not an ""extended period of time"". It's barely enough time for a bag of beans to even reach ambient temperature."
Coffee,3crk2e,unawino,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:32:33 2015 UTC,"Depends, if it was a dark-colored bag and the sun was beating down on the bag, it could reach even higher temperatures inside the bag than inside the car.  I don't think this is outside the realm of plausibility."

Coffee,3crk2e,germdisco,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:13:45 2015 UTC,this is a brewing error not a bean problem most likely unless the beans were roasted until they are charcoal.

Even though the Baratza's aren't very consistent, I chose the settings that they suggest for Espresso (4), Brewer (13), Chemex (20), and French Press (30).  Incidentally, with each new grind size I cleaned the grinder as I would on a regular basis - basically getting everything out that I could using the cleaning brush and an air puffer."

Just want to use the same methodology for more meaningful results."
Coffee,3cr860,DiscoJaguar,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:07:58 2015 UTC,"Good question, cool you're taking this so seriously! I ground into the jar, but did my usual slap-slap on the hopper to get most everything out, then slap slap from the jar onto the paper. I.e. the same thing I do when making a cup. I don't brush it out, just tap the main stuff out. (I'd imagine 1/4 g might get left in there, tops?)   Also, not sure if beans matter, but this was a throwaway cheap house blend of medium-dark sold to me for making Turkish."

Coffee,3crgak,mikeoalphone,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:25:52 2015 UTC,"5g fines out of 25g doesn't sound too bad to me. With conical burr grinders (pretty much all consumer grade burr grinders use conical, I think), fines are inevitable because of how the burrs chew up the beans. The finer you grind, the more ""chews"" need to take place. For each chew, the bean cracks and gives off a puff of dust. So, at coarser settings, fewer chews thus less dust. Somehow, some grinders produce more fines than others, and I don't know why. But I've seen worse than 1/5 fines and still had a decent cup. Think 1/3, or more..! (But yeah.. Straining em out can be sweet.)   Also, a certain amount of fines can be a good thing -- for some brew methods.   One more thing, are the non-fines consistent among themselves? That's one thing that a decent grinder like a Baratza should get you over a Hario hand grinder for instance.   Note, I'm sort of a noob, but have been reading way too much about this stuff lately :-D Looking forward to corrections from more experienced folks."

Looking at other users experience, the water should go from 212 in a bonavita gooseneck to 202 in the kettle without any preheating, and stay above 200 the whole brew. I like to use a bit hotter so I'd just preheat. Not that brew temperature beyond a basic acceptable range is a very major factor anyway.  The point of not using the same kettle to heat and pour is to have the more comfortable and controllable kettle be the one in my hand for the brewing process. If the kettle I want to use to pour came in say an induction hob or electric edition, I wouldn't be looking for a separate heating device."
