Being that he had traveled the world, he had a bit of a taste for Belgian Style beers. Our local had DT on tap. So he went there, then us as his students went there. So there was a couple generations of young 20-somethings drinking DT from this bar, like several kegs a week. At first because it got you shitfaced, second, because it's super good.  Once I got into brewing professionally, I turned a few people on to other golden strong type ales like Duvel, or other Belgian styles, but whenever I'm back in town and I hear some young kid ordering a DT, I know it's because he is a music student.  But it is weird how as a beer hipster you move away from it. It's all over the place now, and there are better golden strongs, but it's still a tight beer."
beerporn,3dkp6u,bezdancing,5,Fri Jul 17 20:29:13 2015 UTC,"Terribly expensive for what it is, even in Europe: just a decent beer. Both the normal one and the Nocturnus."
beerporn,3dkp6u,losernameamirite,2,Fri Jul 17 14:25:11 2015 UTC,The Delirium Red is a fantastic beer. Probably my favorite of the range.
beerporn,3dkp6u,templar77400,2,Fri Jul 17 15:25:48 2015 UTC,"Agree. I think the ceramic bottle gives the ""cool"" factor and the elephants are kind of cute.

beerporn,3dkp6u,tikiwargod,7,Fri Jul 17 09:31:40 2015 UTC,"Correct me if i'm wrong but Duvel isn't technically a Tripel, but a 'Golden Ale' (didn't they basically invent that style?)"

beerporn,3dkp6u,tikiwargod,3,Fri Jul 17 20:01:41 2015 UTC,Light weight doesn't address the increased ML per L3  which means more beer per pallet and therefor higher shipping efficiency.

Closer to the city, Mile High Wine and Spirits had a great selection. There are a lot of good shops in Denver, so it depends where you are staying.   As far as bars, I mostly went to breweries but also went to Falling Rock a couple times and had Pliny, Blind Pig, and Hoppy Birthday on tap. If you're in Colorado still on August 1, I highly recommend making the drive to Casey Brewing. Crooked Stave is an obvious brewery you should visit. And as far as lesser kbown places, definitely check out Former Future Brewing."

It put the prairie bomb to shame, although one's a little easier to get than the other.  Just a little. Edit:  also, the Dark Lord was still an great beer, but we had a huge selection of great beers, some will be better than others.

beerporn,3d4jg7,Badwolf2013,5,Mon Jul 13 14:26:58 2015 UTC,"We had about 25 people.  Ask people to bring snacks, a tasting glass, and their ""whalez.""  Put your tongue fully in your cheek for the ""whalez"" portion.  I always feel bad when some of my less geeky friends feel bad for not having crazy rare beers.  We're all just hanging out and drinking beers.  This is more for fun than anything.  Provide water and any other snacks you want to provide.  Have fun."
beerporn,3d4jg7,bigdah7,5,Mon Jul 13 15:01:47 2015 UTC,I usually provide most if not all of the beers for tastings. I own a beer store and have more beers stashed away than I will ever be able to drink for the rest of my life. I love sharing beer with people. The main reason I don't try more beers is because it's no fun to drink the whales by myself. My pregnant wife has been a pretty weak beer tasting partner for last 8 months.
