milliondollarextreme,3dmzaj,420__points,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:16:00 2015 UTC,"i don't agree with it. i agree that actions are usually (NOT always) as important as ideas, but to call a good idea a piece of shit is dumb. if the thing sam was trying to get across is that you have to act on your idea before it's valuable, the idea itself is still the starting point for those actions. if you never had the good idea that ended up making you successful or got you to accomplish something, you wouldn't have the path to act upon anything. at the very least the idea is worth as much as the actions that you follow it with. but yeah if you don't act on it at all then usually the idea is rendered worthless.  not always though. someone else could take that idea and act on it. look at marx's ideas. unless you count the act of writing the books that he laid those ideas down in as an 'act' (and if you do, then merely putting your ideas into an online forum or using any other method of sharing them, even doing it verbally, would also be an action), he himself didn't really do much to help bring about anything like communism as he described it. other people looked at his ideas and acted upon them and that ended up changing the entire course of history, imo for the worse. so in that case those ideas have a lot of historical weight. those ideas changed the world. it's an extreme example but it still proves my point and you can find more common examples all over if you just look.  on top of all that, i agree with other posters here saying that it resembles some quote someone would put on their facebook, or even the rant from shia labeouf on youtube. i still thought it was entertaining."
milliondollarextreme,3dmzaj,TVdinnerbythepool,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:48:42 2015 UTC,"As far as a personal philosophy goes with regards to being productive and realizing your potential, then this quote is accurate. You could dissect any quote the way you’re dissecting this one. Sure, you could put a disclaimer stating ‘BUT the idea is worth something if it’s stealable’, however that would of course negate the power of the statement and for no good reason.  If you have a fantastic idea and it gets stolen and realized, then the idea is still worthless to YOU and still a piece of shit to YOU, because it was yours in the first place and that’s that shame in it."

milliondollarextreme,3cuhh5,MDE-100percentREAL,1 point,Sat Jul 11 09:05:22 2015 UTC,"Sam, I believe you are approaching a crossroads in regards to your comedic direction. Marshal McLuhan explained in the 60’s that with the arrival of the electronic/information age, our time “presents us with a unique opportunity for learning by means of humor”. “Learning” in the traditional sense is indeed a very serious endeavour, and much of what you provide is an amalgam of this basic concept; you don’t merely appeal to the “funny bone” so much as you do to the “truth”. Engaging the masses will mean a compromise between reputation or truth.  Here —and at all times— we should heed the insight of the ancients… Plato’s thesis that democracy naturally evolves into tyranny was an accurate one and those such as Aristotle and Polybius believed in an “anacyclosis”; a natural circular evolutionary process from monarchy into aristocracy, aristocracy into democracy, and democracy into tyranny. We now find ourselves facing down the tyranny of the majority… the more you appeal to truth Sam, the more you will be persecuted for it."

milliondollarextreme,3cn09u,pifarm,18,Thu Jul 9 05:06:54 2015 UTC,"When it comes to weed, the boys rely strictly on the facts. Over the course of the last decade, they have dedicated themselves entirely to analyzing government statistics and crunching long lists of numbers taken from medical studies, in order to form a mathematical model of the exact mechanism of the effects of weed. What they have found is incredibly disturbing. The data shows that every single time a person smokes weed, their nipples grow an average of 0.3 cm in length. Heavy, long-time, users invariably end up suffering from a condition known as Long-Titty Syndrome, in which the nipples hang long and thin like ropes on the floor. The patients are generally confined to wheelchairs as their long nipples and dreadlocks tangle up around their feet, causing them to trip and injure themselves thousands of times a day. As support groups for these sufferers have begun popping up around the nation, a subculture has spawned around them. The followers of the subculture are alienated from the rest of society. These Niplords, as they call themselves, have lost interest in socializing with outsiders, referring to them pejoratively as Narcs, preferring to stay indoors with other members of the group and forming pair bonds by tying their own nipples to another person's nipples in a pretzel and stroking each other off, while frantically ""shotgun""-ing marijuana smoke into each other's mouths. The boys have concluded in their study that these people are extremely dangerous and yucky and need to be put down."

Not saying you are but there are some people here who see Sam's opinions as holy and if they stray for a second they think they're worthless."

When I am back in glorious states of united (usually once a year), I often get a few chances to smoke with friends. While it's nice in some ways to be ""clear headed"" for many years now, I also unabashedly miss it and sincerely believe that it has certain medicinal properties when eaten or vaporized in moderation (lower stress, improved mood, possibly anti-aging effects on the brain and nervous system, among others).  In terms of casual use for simple want of intoxication, I believe it is so much better than alcohol on every level, and much less dangerous to your health. However, like most things in life, it should be respected and used in moderation. Extended breaks (over a week for regular uses) is good for many reasons, least of all that the next time you have some, the effect is amplified many times over due to lowered tolerance. Also, absolutely, positively, 100% reject bullshit ""weed culture"". That shit is lame and I have no idea why it is so prevalent. Just because someone drinks beer or whiskey or smokes cigarettes doesn't mean they have to dress differently or say stupid shit. Reject. It.  Edit: Misread the title as ""what are your guys thoughts on weed"". A title with correct grammar, capitalization, and punctuation would be nice next time.

milliondollarextreme,3cbitm,greasycomb,3,Wed Jul 8 03:29:01 2015 UTC,"easy to make fun of, but there are health benefits to this. there is something called the ""counter-clockwise"" effect. an experiment took old folks out into a monastery where everything was vintage just how they remembered it in the 1950s when they were young, and they spent a weekend there playing around as if they were young kids again and they all showed huge improvements in health and even looking physically younger. this effect was found in people simply thinking about being young, but was much more profound in people actually doing the things that they did when they were young. i don't think such a thing is really necessary for 20 year olds though but i'm sure it still helps with stress"

milliondollarextreme,3cbitm,hstsa,12,Mon Jul 6 17:47:05 2015 UTC,"Its quite the opposite, Its people who always had mommy and daddy who loved them very much and never faced any sort of struggle.  Now they are 24 and moved out of the house but don't want a job yet because the real world is ""scary"". They ask for some money from their happily retired parents so they can go to this day care and complain how its hard for young people to get a career, so they finger paint instead"
milliondollarextreme,3cbitm,pifarm,4,Mon Jul 6 18:44:10 2015 UTC,"This seems more accurate. I've watched a few documentaries on people like this and more often than not it seemed like they came from fairly normal, loving, middle class families.

milliondollarextreme,3bq446,KowalskiTheGreat,5,Wed Jul 1 23:14:33 2015 UTC,"i feel like there should be a place for amateur journalism projects like these. i do that shit sometimes too. like this one time i thought i was discovering this illuminati elite-mafia organization through the show Arthur. now hear me out, i know it sounds crazy. as some of you may know arthur has had illuminati stuff framed in their episodes (back in 90s and its in an animation so you know it was purposeful, and not possibly related to the recent internet trends). well it turns out that the company that produces the show, Cinar run by M. Charest and a guy named Weinberg. the company was involved in a bunch of fraud like embezzling and tax credit fraud. now Michelle Charest and Weinberg are married and first met in the 70s and their first project was marketing the obscure occult horror film ""the wicker man"". they drove accross the country selling this film to theaters. i haven't seen it but basically this is an occult film about sacrificing children to pagan gods on an island or something.  the film was produced by ""british lion"" whose logo is a damn all-seeing eye. now back to the charest and weinberg company. apparently their fraud and scams came about through their connection with an investment banker named John Xanthoudakis, CEO of a hedge fund called the Norshield Financial Group which lost alot of money (mafia money). he has ties to the Rizzuto crime family who he owes money to and who assaulted him for said money. he's the one who came up with the Cinar scams and brought it to them. the Cinar scandal was in 1999, charest died in 2004 due to complications in plastic surgery, the year that she and the others of Cinar turned down a settlement and hired lawyers to protect their seized assets, and the year that Cinar was later bought and rebranded to ""Cookie Jar Group"" . this guy Ursuth who was involved with all this and wrote a book about this scandal says the Royal Bank of Canada has tight connections with Norshield and is embroiled in litigation over their possible involvement. there's some good quotes from the article:   “There was nothing complicated in the assault—the Rizzutos simply wanted their money back. The incident is unusual only in that it has become public. Countless points of contact exist between the legitimate business world and organized crime. If you look closely, you will see there are distinctions in the underworld that reflect crudely the distinctions in the upper world,” says Diego Gambetta, an Oxford University sociologist and expert on the Mafia. “[The Mafia] wouldn’t have lasted 150 years if they had been just a gang of extortionists. They served the interests of various portions of the business world.”  As the case of Norshield showed, the Rizzutos’ contacts in the business world were widespread.  The Rizzuto organization extends across Canada, into the U.S. and as afar afield as Latin America, Italy and the banking havens of Switzerland and Liechtenstein. “These guys are so sophisticated it’s unfuckingbelievable!” exclaims Salvatore (Big Sal) Miciotta, a former capo and hitman with the Colombos, one of New York’s five Mafia families. “Because you’re talking about big, big, gigantic money here.…They have the gross income of small countries. They are able to sway bond markets, that’s how big they are.”   now i dunno what this points to but i thought it was pretty interesting. a strange weaving of occult, entertainment, financial banking and mafia. and as you have said, these are the people that create our culture. I suspect most of the media and entertainment industry are hierarchical and have all sorts of esoteric and criminal connections. i guess the reason why I like amateur journalism is that it's not really interesting enough or well-conceived enough to have an article written about it, and yet it provides some perspective."

It's one of the worst film movements in history, and I think I'm in the majority with that opinion. This looks aimless even for a mumblecore film, was directed by and stars Tao Lin and is like 2-3 years after the end of the mumblecore boom. The worst is when boring, narcissistic people make movies about their everyday lives because not only are they boring, they have no style or aesthetic, so EVERYTHING about the film is boring. You can make a film about ""nothing"" but you have to know how to do it, you can't just do it all half assed.  I do respect anyone who makes good, unique low or no budget work though, I just can't stand the improvisational actor shakey cam shit. It feels inhuman and tedious.

Forget ""boring"", that is meaningless and always has more to do with you than anything that is happening to you. if you find something boring it is because you are expecting something; you aren't living in reality and accepting it in a real way. in this absurd world, it is the quantity of experience that matters, not the quality. with judgements you are qualifying reality in a way that meets your conceptualized ideas of what it is supposed to be all about. This mumblecore video was made by someone, and who put a couple years of work into it and thinks it has value, and in doing so it already does. the most important thing in art is the frame because that is all it is. the important part of this process is seeing into a 'strange' perspective. it makes you feel funny. the feeling comes before grasping. but without allowing yourself to feel 'funny' you'll never grasp, and therefore never grow. simply by examining this dynamic you are already in the process of change."

milliondollarextreme,3bkax3,SpoderSlayer,16,Tue Jun 30 00:55:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe because in order to combat nihilism, on an individual or seemingly intentionally engineered institutionalized level (Kafkaesque shit you experience daily), one needs (and we can deviate entirely off course here and talk about what one ought to do) to give a fuck enough about being sincere and projecting something positive, novel, ""outside the box"", or enveolope pushing into a planet and cultural world full of a lot of shit and nonsense rehashing. The see-saw is pretty fucking lopsided, and maybe Sam and Co. got sick of being easily written off as irony obsessed deconstructionists, or whatever the fuck you want to call them.  Anyway here's some more worthwhile wall of text for you to digest you beautiful fucks:  “Irony and cynicism were just what the U.S. hypocrisy of the fifties and sixties called for. That’s what made the early postmodernists great artists. The great thing about irony is that it splits things apart, gets up above them so we can see the flaws and hypocrisies and duplicates. The virtuous always triumph? Ward Cleaver is the prototypical fifties father? ""Sure."" Sarcasm, parody, absurdism and irony are great ways to strip off stuff’s mask and show the unpleasant reality behind it. The problem is that once the rules of art are debunked, and once the unpleasant realities the irony diagnoses are revealed and diagnosed, ""then"" what do we do? Irony’s useful for debunking illusions, but most of the illusion-debunking in the U.S. has now been done and redone. Once everybody knows that equality of opportunity is bunk and Mike Brady’s bunk and Just Say No is bunk, now what do we do? All we seem to want to do is keep ridiculing the stuff. Postmodern irony and cynicism’s become an end in itself, a measure of hip sophistication and literary savvy. Few artists dare to try to talk about ways of working toward redeeming what’s wrong, because they’ll look sentimental and naive to all the weary ironists. Irony’s gone from liberating to enslaving. There’s some great essay somewhere that has a line about irony being the song of the prisoner who’s come to love his cage.”  -David Foster Wallace"
milliondollarextreme,3bkax3,NEWLOWS,15,Tue Jun 30 06:14:15 2015 UTC,"shit man this is exactly what i've been saying to all my buds. you NEED to care about something. most normal people do but to a lot of us in the 15 to 35 range we take such pride in our senses of irony and our ability to make a joke out of anything that we feel uncomfortable having any real beliefs, i guess out of fear of criticism.   i would say that's an awful reason to keep yourself an empty pagliacci sad boi but when you've been told everything you like is faggy and retarded by at least someone online you tend to put up a wall and second guess yourself before you hit that enter key or open your mouth at the coffee table. i know of no other way to cope with life than to devote your energies to something you can authentically say you care about. if you're lucky that thing will present itself to you, and if you're like most of us you'll have to find it. religion, politics, music, writing, art, exercise, crafting, whatever you want, just pick SOMETHING and educate yourself and further your own experience and enhance your fellow man's experience as well."

This is from a guy who grew up in the late 80s and 90s when ""grunge"" was popular and many of my peers were proud of being lazy slobs. If on the other hand you tried something and failed, even a little, people were quick to label you a ""tryhard"". It was better to just wallow in mediocrity, from their perspective, than to try and care about things and face challenges head on."
milliondollarextreme,3bkax3,HaHawk,4,Thu Jul 9 14:09:01 2015 UTC,"new sincerity and metamodernism are boring. the former is a failed movement and the latter is out of touch. try to stop being pessimistic and ironic if you feel it'll improve your personal mental health (it probably will), but expecting any worthwhile social change to come from vague, uncoordinated social movements (like new sincerity) that are perpetuated and discussed mostly online, is a bit more than hopeful"

I'm talking about the bettering of the entire planet not just the fucking mostly already dead intelligentsia.   Furthermore I'm not just discussing this shit online, from a personal standpoint. I genuinely am trying and effectively am becoming ""the change I want to see in the world""  Otherwise you're a passive bitch fuck boy spectator doing nothing but ridiculing from the peanut gallery. Lift weights, eat well, don't be a consumerist fucking whore, be kind to people and treat them like an end and not a means, whole-ass whatever it is you're doing at the given moment, and get a regular amount of sunlight/fresh air. This shit is so much easier than people make it out to be. Especially the hormonal messes that constitute adolescence in America.   edit: Oh I forgot the most important one: learn multiple helpful trades and be your own fucking boss.   double edit: So what's your opinion on genuine and effective political action? Local organizing to improve a community's infrastructure, showing up to town hall meetings, whatever. Giving a shit beyond merely accepting ""this is our world and we deserve it"". You can call it quixotic but I think that's a fucking cop-out."

I admire your commitment to striving for personal growth and being a well-rounded type of person - but this very much sounds like some delusional ""I can make a difference"" belief of a person with no real power or influence. like you've recognized that you can't do much so you'll just do what you can but blow it out of proportion.  again, all of these things you (supposedly) do are peachy for personal growth, but to think it somehow translates into any significant, lasting social/political change is ridiculous. and to use that belief to put yourself above others and claim superiority is just as stupid.  have fun going to town halls and being disappointed with the government though, I'll be having fun over here masturbating to hentai and playing cs:go"

It's an incomplete ideology but I don't think that makes it worse."

Tim and Eric) need to actually do something with it other than make silly jokes and noises: I'd assume that because they're now reaching a larger audience, attaining some success and taking this really seriously they're being more careful about the overall message MDE presents.   It's not as if they were wholly negative in the past either, you can see glimmers of MDE's hopes for a brighter future here... Or maybe I'm just seeing what I want to see.  Like NEWLOWS said here it's pointless JUST presenting people with the view that the world sucks and is extraordinarily unfair. We know already and unless the suggestion is we should all go with 'Plan S' it's not helpful. You consume MDE's work and it just makes you want to go shoot yourself? - COOL. I need more of that because I don't have an unending torrent of bad news crashing down on my head via internet, TV, newspapers, radio and magazines daily.  I speculate and hope it's because while MDE tries to lift the veil on the bullshit we're surrounded by it also gently (lovingly?) nudges us in the direction of the way out too. There's my take on it."

This guy is just saying a bunch of weird and almost funny stuff. If my friend was coming up with this off the top of his head then I'd laugh probably but I can't say it's that great."

It sure is great television and I'm glad this guy got to feel fantastic for a day. But I don't agree with patting someone on the back just for trying because I would rather he work to improve his set or come to the grim realization that he isn't funny and find talent elsewhere before his bitter three-job-working girl ditches him. Unfortunately the ""inspiring figure"" schtick doesn't really have lasting value if he doesn't actually have skill. I envy the crowd's freedom from cynicism and their genuine happiness at a sight like this but while this poor fuck is bombing at an actual club their memory of him will have long faded along with every other inspiration of the week so I don't think they're doing the right thing.  Also I hate myself for validating this dumb reality TV shit by even talking about it but the masses are going off of the flimsy narrative presented so that's what I'm responding to"

I had to tilt my head all the way up to see it. What I saw was this. About 10 commercials in a row, each commercial featured kids destroying things, throwing food, wasting food, brandishing fake weapons, fake fighting. And then it dawned on me - this is why we are the ""strongest"" military power in the world. We condition are kids to act like complete violent lunatics."

milliondollarextreme,3b0yrn,tatleoat,2,Sat Jun 27 08:14:51 2015 UTC,"I seriously doubt he meant all TV. It's common for people to say ""I hate X"" when they mean most X rather than all X and that kinda annoys me but that's a different issue. He has said on here that he likes Wonder Showzen (a tv show) and he said in a YouTube comment that he likes Chris Morris (a guy who makes TV shows). Also, MDE are getting a tv show. Granted he said all that after making the video you link to but I doubt his views would change so radically over only a few years. Lastly, and this is pretty subjective, it's just dumb to say that literally everything in a certain medium of art is bad or stupid, and I don't think Sam is that dumb. Watching shit like Jersey Shore or Duck Dynasty and then saying all television is stupid would be like reading the Twilight books or Fifty Shades of Grey and saying all books are stupid."

milliondollarextreme,3aouw2,lonelyboyonreddit,21,Mon Jun 22 21:11:41 2015 UTC,"We have all seen this video before  But today I was actually doing the same thing Sam was in this video, and I was on some ad agency's site, and it was like the same people. All of the people that worked there had quirky, unique pictures for their resumes...you know, to show how creative and out of the box they were...and they actually had titles like ""Creative"". I remember Sam saying how preposterous it was to have that as your job title, and he was right. It's so vague. It sounds like you're kind of just a yes man...a guy with no clear cut skill, just bit of this, a bit of that, etc. Just a cushy job.  I used to think that is probably nice job to land. Absurd salary for the work you do but at the end of the day, you have to share an office with those quasi-people. People who are safe, with no real sense of humor and no sense of urgency.   I really think or hope these kinds of people are only dominant in places like NYC or LA. I have a friend who has lived in cities all over the world- cities in Italy, Spain, Germany- and he always tells me how he will never live in NYC because it's a pile of shit. It's an overrated, bad city. Every time I go there I feel like I'm in Escape from NY. Like looking over my shoulder, feeling nervous and pressured even though I have reason to be. The entire city always smells bad too and the noise never stops...ever. On any street. Something New Yorkers somehow seem proud of. Nothing I like better than being jolted awake every 15 minutes, literally, by loud unnecessary car horns. Or going to the park at 7AM and actually have a bum pull down his pants and just continue walking around the park with his bum ass and bum dick hanging out, accosting people.  I'm sorry for the rant, I'm not trying to be funny or anything, but New York is truly the most overrated city on the planet."
milliondollarextreme,3aouw2,TVdinnerbythepool,9,Mon Jun 22 08:20:33 2015 UTC,"i don't like new york because its basically like the nexus of evil. new york and london. the two centers of financial terrorism. during the revolutionary war george washington almost burned the city down because it was 9/10ths loyalist. that's why they have their accent. the ""empire state"". full of babylon towers that are absurd and without any humility. cities themselves are essentially the center of a parasitic system and new york is probably the biggest. im not some Ted K anarcho-primitivist (or maybe i am?) i wouldn't mind living in most cities or even NYC itself but you can't rationally justify them unless you're okay with a big pile of shit sucking everything good out of the world. sure that's a big ""caustic"" and ""puerile"" but let's get down to brass tacks; the convenience and food variety and hip clubs don't really justify the human and environmental degradation. it just sounds so immature and retarded to me. if you ask me, any place with big towers is the sign of ""this place is inhuman and fucked up"". because you have to take in consideration the whole causal environment that would create those towers. what they mean. i understand if people don't get where i'm coming from, but there's an multitude of ways to live"
milliondollarextreme,3aouw2,lonelyboyonreddit,3,Mon Jun 22 21:04:27 2015 UTC,"The thing is cities have necessary resources for many people. Tons of jobs, both shitty and long term, lots of entertainment, etc.  The thing that annoys me is that NYC is the self-proclaimed ""Greatest City on Earth"" and yet I can't think of any advantages it has over other famous big cities. What it makes it better than Tokyo or Madrid? Or Stockholm? Or Hong Kong? It seems like every other city has what NYC has in some fashion while also being possibly cleaner, less noisy and more interesting. I don't pretend like every other city is great, and maybe it's because I grew up near NYC, but it has so many negatives compared to UNIQUE positives. I like maddox's article on it because he nailed all the problems with it. The architecture is boring, it smells bad, it's noisy and the people are terrible and if you live there for more than a few months, you become terrible too."
milliondollarextreme,3aouw2,TVdinnerbythepool,4,Mon Jun 22 21:08:41 2015 UTC,"i'm approaching from a different point of view. i dont care what city is wonderful or not. i'm looking at it in terms its relation within the causal nexus of society. and sure maybe i'm wrong and should just 'lighten up'. my view is mostly informed by philosophy which i understand is not very pragmatic. all cities are a place of 'disorder' and 'corruption' because they 'parasite' the flow of energy and this results in classism/hierarchy. you can see it as a tax farmer, living off the fat of the land. he can't produce anything, but through using power or law, he can profit from production. a city doesn't produce anything, it only reproduces by way of interception. if you don't see what i mean, what happens at the end of civilization? the cities become bare and useless. they are there because of surplus, and by cleverness in their interception and reproduction for the aim of profit-making. their complexity is a result of that desire for more. some people see it as beautiful, romantic or awe-inspiring but to me it is just symbolic of parasitism. even all of the amenities and cleanliness and architectural beauty is there to take advantage of our  human biases. ""look how tall, look how detailed, look how this, so shiny, so clean"". this is all illusion projected by our small unknowing relation to it. things are beautiful because we are shitty. because it takes time, because of entropy and everything being against our efforts, because of our lack of immediate understanding of complexity. the term 'concrete jungle' very much applies. and yeah you can go into all the superficial ways in which it sucks as well. i'd live in NYC if i could, though. not that i really want to but i don't really care about what places are nice to live."

I can honestly see someone preparing a noose to this, like Shawshank Redemption style, but instead of a weary old man, it's a bushy-bearded hipster with a perma-frown wearing a pink tucked in collared shirt and tight pants despite being noticeably on the pudgy side, plus immaculate hair, so he looks kind of like he's trying to be dignified but failing in most respects. You can kind of tell he doesn't have any particularly good reason to off himself and probably has it better than 99.9% of the world population, but he still manages to go through with it by really just letting the fantasy fade for a minute and doing the math on his 5 failed bands and the 30+ years of waiter jobs that lie in store for him."

First of all I'm not presenting my comments on this subreddit as art for the benefit of other people. She's putting her work on YouTube with the obvious intention of retaining and entertaining an audience.  Furthermore, this music is completely self-indulgent and seems almost devoid of any meaningful thought. No one wants to hear your voice on loop in 2015 with no effects. It's boring and unimaginative.  If you're going to create work, why make it anything that has been done before? Let me guess, you listen to Modest Mouse and Radiohead, a group of five or six white guys who have never experienced real problems and you think it's really emotional and important music, right?"

It's polarizing; no celebs or recognizable people involved.  We feel as though it's the best stuff we've ever made however at this stage it's still possible for us to fuck the edit up. There are a lot of problems and variables, which things to cut for time, whether to try to make it appealing for MDE fans vs. appealing for Adult Swim fans, etc., trying to please people inside the network and finally ourselves.  All the stuff we shot would be probably 35 minutes if we were to edit it the usual way. We did an 11-minute cut using everything and it was so fast, like constant edit jokes, embarassing shit, so we've got to cut some sketches.  Oh yeah, it's an 11-minute block. Chuck's comment about 3AM was a joke, no guarantee that it'll air at all. If I had to guess, my guess would be that it'll air and get picked up for multiple seasons, but anything can happen.

I listen to it on YouTube when doing other stuff on the computer, I listen to it in the car, and I listened to it when I worked out (need to get back on that) but I know it's crap so I wouldn't say it's what I ""listen to"" because there is a lot of music I think is better and I pay more attention to it when listening to it. I also used to be embarrassed to say that I would do that but I've mellowed out on that more. I'm fine with saying I eat McDonald's occasionally even though it's obviously crap, pop music is just the same thing. The important part for me is knowing that it is crap. That all being said I guess I'll talk about the kind of music I really enjoy.   I like at least one artist from every genre I know of but I mainly like rock music. Especially any kind of ""weird"" rock music (particularly if it's from the 60's and 70's but I listen to a decent amout of newer stuff too), my favorite genre is prog rock. So my favorite bands are Genesis (just for the Gabriel-Hackett era), Pink Floyd, and King Crimson. Recently I've been getting into Slint and Tortoise."

The style itself is typically shit and the lyrics are even worse but the number one songwriting rule of good pop seems to be ""be as deceptively simple as possible"" which is hard to disagree with as a bad thing but it's easy to get insecure about."

milliondollarextreme,38z2j9,transfaggot,8,Mon Jun 8 01:47:40 2015 UTC,"i personally like the absurd characters like the johnney and the more subtle satire. what you describe is useless to do just by the fact that you made a post about it which one can with inductive reasoning infer from that there's no need to satirize what a regular dude thinks is stupid. like you and your misanthropic frustration for example would be sort of worth satirizing. ""satire"" is meant to be pragmatic not just to preach to the choir. every single person's behavior can be satirized, including sam and MDE."
milliondollarextreme,38z2j9,TVdinnerbythepool,7,Mon Jun 8 02:01:45 2015 UTC,"Also, I would say MDE really does satirize a lot of what this guy has a problem with but they don't do it in a really obvious way. I feel like this guy expects MDE to do a ""parody"" where they make references to specific millennial trends that last for a few weeks at most like the yellow/white vs blue/black dress thing. But if you want that shit you can just follow some shitty comedian on twitter. In Keep Calm and Mouth Milk, Sam talks a little bit about Doctor Who and the phrase ""Keep Calm"". Little stuff like that satirizes so much of what OP is talking about without shoving it in your face."
milliondollarextreme,38z2j9,SinisterExaggerator_,-8,Mon Jun 8 06:11:14 2015 UTC,"Wrong, they need to be satirized because they are fucking everywhere and they suck.  People like me arent influencing society but these shits are, and their bad lowest common denominator culture is spreading like a fucking mind virus faster than ever before due to social media.  At least in the 80's and 90's the elites ran the media, so they could spread a more elite culture, but now with social media, popular culture has just dropped to the lowest common denominator.  Also, I think parody has much more power than people give it credit for.  Some douche can be on top of the world on every TV show and all it takes is one well-done parody that exposes the truth, and then people start turning against them."

How can i have worth if they don't like me? to resolve this dissonance the others must be in the wrong, the others are a stereotype you created. the stronger the doubt you have of your own worth,  the more vitriol you have and the more you feel you hate the others. as a few others have referenced, this is the elliot rodgers disease. the illogic of being the ""supreme gentleman"" and the lack of female attraction. the ""backfire effect"" inflates your sense of self in a narccistic delusion of grandeur. the dissonance intensifies with every reminder (im sure you feel stress and anger every time you see an ""urban normie millenial"". his killing them was the only way to solve the illogic which made him suffer, because his delusion reached its apex and couldn't go any farther."

milliondollarextreme,38z2j9,janjostine,4,Mon Jun 8 02:33:43 2015 UTC,"hate the game man, not the player(s). perhaps the idea is not to satirize people that annoy us, but to satirize the system, although that is sometimes done by making fun of people who are annoying. if mde were to listen to everyone's idea of people they don't like, well, it just wouldn't be a criticism of the whole anymore.   it's easy to have un-ideological rages at people, and many of us do all the time, but creating media based on deeper beliefs requires more than just funny versions of these."

milliondollarextreme,38z2j9,onlinerocker,2,Mon Jun 8 04:53:52 2015 UTC,"recovered weed addict here  small amounts of weed is way more addictive than large amounts of weed. with small amounts of weed, it just makes you laugh more and makes you happy. with large amounts of weed, it does both of those things, but it also ""fucks you up"". there is no downside to the buzz you get from small amounts, but there is a downside to being incapacitated on larger amounts. thats why, if you're gonna smoke weed, you should only do large amounts at a time."
milliondollarextreme,38z2j9,DeorcHund,2,Mon Jun 8 10:41:49 2015 UTC,"I mean, you can go on and on about all the specific trends and whatnot that you find annoying. Ironically, I think complaining about the specific things you hate (obsession with Instagram for example) really only serves to reinforce their hold on society. I also get annoyed by most of the stuff you said, but in the end it's really not the trends themselves I dislike, but the unsavory aspects of human nature that they bring to the forefront and, by their popularity and ubiquitous nature, serve to de-stigmatize. (Perfect example being social media fueled narcissism; as a whole it seems like blatant narcissism is no longer looked down upon as it once was. If the myth of Narcissus was written today, it'd be about a man who accidentally walked into live traffic because he couldn't stop hamming it up for iphone selfies.) Rather then attack specific memes or trends, like you suggest, which will inevitably go out of style and make your criticism seem dated, I think the best course of action is to do what I feel MDE does best; subtle satire that takes aim not at specific millennial tropes, but at the broad, ugly aspects of human nature that are enabling it. They do it all the time. Parody what seems to be a somewhat small, unrelated quirk, but kinda serves as a microcosm of everything that annoys them about [insert group]."

milliondollarextreme,378wxz,transfaggot,1 point,Tue May 26 18:35:14 2015 UTC,"""Time Scam: Illegal Broadcast"" kinda sounds like it's meant to be the title for a sequel. As though it could also be ""Time Scam 2"". However it still works really well, and that's what I voted for. I said it out loud quite a few times.  Just ""Time Scam"" on its own also sounds good when said out loud, however it felt a bit lacking. The sort of thing that might be better off if it was referring to a group, eg. ""Time Scammers"" (although that could get mistaken for being some 4am cartoon that's about a world of super heroes and villains that hack time travel...who knows).   My next actual choice would be either World Peace or Smoke Machine. World Peace as a tv show name is just hilarious, and Smoke Machine has good vibes and feels like it could implicate multiple different meanings or references:   Is it just a horror show about the adventures Roberto the 40yo stage prop guy who has a really creepy obsession with smoke machines, but ends up using the stage actors to create smoke? Is it a super fly name, almost as though some MC is about to pop up and dish out words that linger in the audience like smoke, followed by his beats which penetrate said smoke like lasers at a rave?   ..etc.  The others on the list mostly come across as either too long or just feel like random combinations of words.  Cooljacker instantly made me think of ""cool jacket"", it felt more like some street brand name for clothing that a surfer might wear in winter."

They are literal walls of text to me.  They're impressive in the sense that they resist interpretation w.r.t. authorial intent, also in the sense that total trash (Sunshine Day off Twat) is impressive for having no redeemable qualities. But what's gained from it? A cheap laugh, but you feel worse after reading it, like eating fast food. Sunshine Day isn't much different to me than Friday; that MDE knows they're being ridiculous in Sunshine Day doesn't make it much different than Friday. Why even make it, when Friday can parody itself? Why write paragraphs like this [in the image], when plenty of bloggers can parody themselves? All you're doing is pointing it out, maybe making a snide joke about pointing it out, but why bother?   (The pointing-out is different than the white privileged male standup or the tumbl-this video. Those would be ""pointing-out"" if, respectively, the videos were replaced by still screens of Sam's speech and screen caps of the tumblr blogs.)  Is the feeling of disgust ""the point""? If so, why? I can go watch youtube celebrities and feel the same way. This type of satire is a dead-end; it's never better than what it's satirizing, just trash begetting trash."

BJJ... BJJ is really the only thing worth considering. Getting in fights is probably cool and you should do it, just remember your homework will be:   a night in jail thousands of dollars down the drain (lawyers) looking like a stupid ape the guy hits his head on the curb and gets brain damage and you spend five years in jail you hit your head on a bar stool and are a vegetable for the rest of your life   Get some power but hide your power level and only use it if the benefits are greater than the above homework. Most people walking around out there have more to lose than you do. It might be funny to throw your drink on someone's car but they are an unemployed piece of shit with all the time in the world to follow you around and let the air out of your tires. Don't fight poor people ever. Learn BJJ!"

milliondollarextreme,34z22v,butterbelievethat,-2,Fri May 8 01:19:27 2015 UTC,You think the show is ingeniously realistic because its two main black characters are a crackhead and an incompetent boss hired to fill a minority quota? So it's a good show because you can impose your narrow worldview upon it? Why would this make anyone want to watch it? You assume all purveyors of MDE are bigots? You can fuck off now.

milliondollarextreme,34z22v,butterbelievethat,0,Wed May 6 01:50:07 2015 UTC,"He wasn't railing against blacks. He was pointing out how the show had hidden messages in its characters. Crack and prostituton are huge problems in black communities, and racial diversity is flat out rediculous like he thinks the show depicts.   You don't need to be all ""Hide behind me black people! I'll protect you!""  Black people can stick up for themselves."
milliondollarextreme,34z22v,ninob168,-1,Wed May 6 02:37:31 2015 UTC,"Hidden messages? Like black people are either crack addicted prostitutes or they get to positions of success through affirmative action? crack addiction is a problem in any community it afflicts. Prostitution isn't necessarily a problem (as long as it's two consenting adults, etc.), and there is a ton of it outside of black communities. How is racial diversity ridiculous? (Learn how to spell, fucktard) Are you saying segregation is preferable? I never told any black people to hide behind me. I just think it's stupid to recommend a show to this subreddit- with its primary selling point being ""it propogates negative stereotypes about race""- when one could just as easily say ""it makes fun of bureacracy in the corporate workplace."" Also, if you're saying black people can stick up for themselves, you're implying they're being attacked in this thread. Why should they be attacked in the first place? Why should they be singled out for being black? Can't they just be seen as people? What makes you so much better than them?"
milliondollarextreme,34z22v,greasycomb,2,Wed May 6 03:02:41 2015 UTC,"look, I can see that discussing race makes you very uncomfortable. I know it's much easier to dismiss me as overly sensitive and make an epic meme comment to show how little you care. You should go lick your dads penis until he comes and you can feel truly manly and detached."
milliondollarextreme,34z22v,fu_ckyou,-1,Wed May 6 08:02:18 2015 UTC,"No. It was making a statement about a prevalent issue in their community and mocking a popular PR stunt.    Prostitution isn't a problem? Would you be okay with your daughter doing it?  Nothing in his post is bashing African Americans. It's calling attention to issues, and just because it might be doing it subtlety doesn't mean they're trying to get away with racism.  Also don't post text walls. If you can't say it short, don't."
milliondollarextreme,34z22v,greasycomb,5,Wed May 6 20:36:14 2015 UTC,"Exchanging sex for money isn't a problem. When third parties (like human traffickers and pimps) get involved, it becomes a problem. What is wrong with one adult paying another consenting adult for sex?   I don't have a daughter. If I did, I would have higher expectations for her than a career in prostitution. However, if that was the career path she really wanted once she was old enough to make an informed decision and was completely safe and healthy, I would have to accept that. Because she would be her own person. I also wouldn't want her moving across country, buying a cat, or joining the army. My feelings towards those things dont make any of them wrong. I'm sure you would want to keep your daughter to yourself so you could have sex with her as much as possible.  I never said the show was trying to get away with racism. I said OP was advertising the show as racist, in an assumption that it would encourage the MDE subreddit to watch it. I don't approve of bigotry and I'm not going to let a thread based on such an assumption, without a single dissenting opinion, make everyone who likes MDE look like a fucking retard.   I'll post as many text walls as I want you illiterate piece of shit. Learn how to spell. Learn how to read. Learn how to write. Learn how to argue before you talk to me again you ignoramus. I can't ""say it short""because you fail to understand simple concepts that most educated human beings take for granted. How many chromosomes are you missing? I can't fathom how much your mom drank while she was pregnant with you. I'm assuming you're a complete failure in every aspect of your life."

You don't need to defend MDE's fan base and I doubt most care about what we look like to those we don't agree with. You shouldn't worry about how you look to others so much.

I will describe what I heard:  Sam and Andrew filming some kind of hired craigslist actress. Sam was taking the role of the dominatrix while Andrew was directing. I barely remember what i had heard, but I do recall hearing Sam ask this girl to eat a bunch of taffy. Another part sounded like the girl was made to run up and down some stairs; umm then most of the audio sounded like Sam interviewing this girl in that weird half-acting half-breaking-the-4th-wall asking all kinds of personal questions. At one point it sounded like the girl was crying from all the strange requests that Sam would make and Andrew had to interject and lighten the mood a bit. By the end of the audio, you could hear Andrew asking Sam to make a shout out to his film-making professor, so this could possibly be some kind of school related project. Anyways, hopefully they release it. Overall it sounded really funny and I would love to see the girl. Anyone else find this stuff? If I find the file ill share it, but I think my comp has been wiped since then."

milliondollarextreme,34j29w,fhjnjjk,3,Fri May 1 22:00:27 2015 UTC,"Oh really well if you are friends with sam you should have the inside scoop on what happened to the supposed Adult Swim show, so let's hear it.  btw your comment sounds like something a scientologist  would say about L Ron Hubbard.  Also my source says he's got at least $100,000 in bitcoins.  And if he spent the kstv money on rent, that doesn't explain why he didn't make the videos.  The videos would cost nothing, and anyone with talent could make 5 of those a day.  I don't think anyone even paticularly enjoyed those videos, they just gave him the money because they are low self esteem fags who are easily manipulated.  Also look at how he made like 100 rewards for kstv.  He knew there was no way he could deliver on all that shit, but it didn't matter because he wasnt planning on it.  Don't be surprised if this comment gets deleted and I get banned here real quick."

From the Socialblade FAQ:   Estimated earnings are just that, estimated. We take a low CPM value ($0.25 USD) and a high CPM value ($4.00 USD), numbers that we have found to be common from our partners, and multiply them by the number of views the channel gets per day. This assumes that every view on the partner's channel is monetized, which is usually not the case."

Essentially, the most popular radio show, 99% Invisible, had a charismatic leader who took advantage of their popularity and had an enormous pledge drive. So could with sponsors, they raised enough money to pay their staff's salary and to distribute grant money to other independent radio shows. Now, these dozen or so shows are all very high quality and their producers are creating media full time.

milliondollarextreme,33xc4u,dykedestroyer,10,Sun Apr 26 21:37:00 2015 UTC,"This video was really good at articulating something I've always had an issue with but hadn't fully realized.   People too often are a direct product of the TV shows they watch, which isn't a new concept but it's true. What I mean is that people only subscribe to whatever brand of humor has been approved by the shows they watch. They need some form of validation from movies or TV to change their persona, and when they get that validation they change immediately because they don't have a unique bone in their body.  I remember when Napoleon Dynamite came out, everybody was wary of it and it was just a weird quirky movie. Somehow that movie caught on like wildfire and suddenly you had all sorts of commercials and advertisements with that brand of humor. Weird looking people weren't in commercials before that, but because Napoleon Dynamite had gotten so popular it was now ""okay"".  Remember when it was ""cool"" to say ""... ooooookay..."" when someone said something off-topic, or unusual? It was cool to shun ""random people"" who talk about ""random things"". Yet a few years later those same people were embracing the mindless random icanhascheezeburger meme culture, because it was now acceptable and Wal-Mart and Hot Topic sold shirts with funny random things on them.   But that's just humor, it's the same with the TMI issue. Someone saying they're uncomfortable with a particular piece of information because some character on some show they watch would also be uncomfortable with that information. And people think they're becoming a unique person. Picking and choosing a trait they like from this character and that character. At the end of the day you're just a nasty Frankenstein's monster of badly written characters and shallow celebrities. Instead of a person who has become a product of life experience, they're a product of an imagined world. In the internet age and on Tumblr it's even worse."
milliondollarextreme,33xc4u,69pissface420,15,Sun Apr 26 15:31:17 2015 UTC,"I mean, you're pretty much describing how 'culture' has always functioned. It's just more clear to us now because with mass media the process accelerates exponentially. Instead of generational cultural eras like 'Romanticism' or 'Modernism' we have bright light screen stuff that changes form every few months. I would hazard a guess that more ""prank"" videos have been made in two years than books were written during all of the Romantic period. Trends that would otherwise be regional or restricted to certain portions of the population before now become ubiquitous overnight and then die in a few weeks. You wake up one day and suddenly a picture with white text on the top and bottom is now a universally understood genre with its own tropes and nuances. For a month everyone does Ice Bucket Challenges, and now watching those videos is akin to watching a black and white movie. When was the last time anyone did a Harlem Shake video? Dubstep gives way to Trap overnight.   And to be honest, television is basically a relic at this point. With few exceptions, TV series are basically just things you binge-watch on the internet, and talk shows are just aggregated youtube clips. You can see this in the way people like Kimmel condense everything into separate two-minute segments that you don't have to have watched ANYTHING before to understand.   What interests me is the fact that we've only been 'plugged in' to a constant live stream matrix via our mobile devices for what, 8 years? And it's already completely changed everything about how society interacts in public and private spaces. You walk around a college campus and make eye contact with no one. It seems fresh, efficient, ""better"" to people now, but what kind of malaise will have set in when we've been doing this for 30 years? When for the majority of our lives our experiences have been almost completely mediated by the digital image, and to an extent that was literally unimaginable to any previous generation? Scary to think that we are basically running a global experiment on how much alienation from real life the human psyche can withstand."
milliondollarextreme,33xc4u,butterbelievethat,2,Sun Apr 26 19:09:14 2015 UTC,"We only see them as generational cultural eras because hundreds of years have passed. We can study these eras and see what was going on in history to influence culture during these periods of time. We cannot study this point in time objectively because we're living it. I'm sure people played pranks on each other just as often back then as they do now. There are higher literacy rates now than ever, so I'm sure even more books are being written now than in the Romantic period. It still takes much longer to write a book than it does to play a prank on someone. Fads have always lived and died over short periods of time. I'm sure graffiti in Ancient Greece had its own tropes and nuances as well. The fact that the Internet allows fads to spread more quickly does not mean it is killing art or destroying creativity.   Television is still television, even if people are watching it on their computers and mobile devices. No shit, talk shows are still mindless and shallow. They always have been. But people still watch slow burning, serialized series like Game of Thrones. People still watch The Sopranos. Art has always been and will always be 85% shit, 10% good, and 5% great. While the Internet makes it more acceptable, it doesn't change the creative process. Also, TV and movies are only like 100 years old, so their evolution says very little about humanity as a whole.   You could say the same thing about being ""plugged in"" as you could say about the printing press. You don't have to constantly look at your mobile device. You don't have to constantly look at the Internet. Just like back then you didn't have to constantly read books (yeah they weren't as accessible but neither are smartphones to a lot of the world). It's already completely changed everything about how society interacts in public and private spaces? In what way? I make eye contact with plenty of people. This malaise of yours might just be a byproduct of your shyness. Say ""hi"" to people, they'll usually say ""hi"" back. People have ALWAYS had difficulty being social with strangers. Why do you think there's always a war going on or arguments or shit talking? It's just a part of being human. Before people didn't look up from their phones, they'd be not looking up from a book, or a newspaper, or a tool they were whittling, etc. etc.   Yes, the Internet has changed the way people communicate, as have mobile phones, and other forms of technology. No, people isolating themselves from one another is not a new thing.   *edit: also, what makes you any different? what makes you able to step outside of this ""plugged in"" matrix and diagnose society's technologically wrought problems?"
milliondollarextreme,33xc4u,SinisterExaggerator_,5,Tue May 5 21:57:08 2015 UTC,"I mean, you're pretty much describing how 'culture' has always functioned. It's just more clear to us now because with mass media the process accelerates exponentially.    The fact that people have been doing this forever doesn't really make it any less of a problem (not sure if that is your point but I wanted to say that if it is). People mindlessly basing their lives off of fiction is still a problem regardless of how long it's happened.   Also, I think the fact that the process has accelerated makes this even worse of a problem, rather than just making it more obvious that the problem exists. Say you have a person during the 1800's who reads a new Dickens novel and it influences how they live and they quote it occasionally when it's relevant to a situation. Then say you have a person in modern times who watches a shit ton of sitcoms and YouTube videos and they base all their mannerisms and everyday conversation off of these videos, only to change those mannerisms and conversation the next week because of some new sitcoms and YouTube videos. I would think the latter person is a much more shallow and generally shitty person than the former. I realize this is sort of a strawman and assumes a sort of nostalgic and idealistic version of history but I can't think of a better way to explain my point. I guess my point is that music, television, books etc. are all well and good but if you're overly saturated with them you're more likely to live a shallow fantasy life than someone who takes time to think about a piece of art rather than constantly moving on to the newest thing. And we are more likely to live this shallow fantasy life because we are far more saturated with ""art"" than before the internet. As you said, ""I would hazard a guess that more ""prank"" videos have been made in two years than books were written during all of the Romantic period."" We don't have to wait years for the newest great Romantic novel, we expect and experience constant satisfaction.   And it's already completely changed everything about how society interacts in public and private spaces. You walk around a college campus and make eye contact with no one.   So I guess this is gonna seem like a contradiction because I already ranted a little about how society has gotten worse but statements like the one above kinda annoy me and I think they're hyperbolic. The situation you describe will probably happen but it is not here yet. People still often have face-to-face conversation. People still make eye contact and wave to each other and say ""hi"". What you're describing sounds more to me like an overcrowded city like New York than your average college campus (and I live on campus at a large State University). And besides, in places where people really do walk past each other without saying anything and just generally being in a rush all the time, they have been like that for most of the 20th century, much longer than when cellphones have been around. I'm not even sure how much I'm disagreeing or agreeing with you here, your statement just kinda reminds me of people I know who say stuff like ""social media has actually made us less social"" and think they're being super profound so I felt like I needed to offer a counterpoint.  So I admit this is kind of a rushed post, I apologize if any of this is blatant bullshit. The internet is already saturated with enough of that and I don't want to contribute anymore. These kinds of discussions just don't come up a lot on here so I figured I'd contribute."
milliondollarextreme,33xc4u,butterbelievethat,2,Sun Apr 26 20:29:16 2015 UTC,"You're right. I guess my statement is rather general, and maybe outdated.  People often call this the ""post-contemporary"" era, which is hallmarked by the internet. I think we're starting to see less solid, substantial, trends and more of a big soup of everything all at once (including fleeting brief trends). The internet has certainly allowed all genres and all mediums to find their audiences.   Will it ever be out of fashion for musicians to make music similar to a past decade? Not anymore. There will always be people who like 80's style music (or even Dubstep or Trap), and as long as the internet exists they will be able to find it, make it and share it. If you search you can find exactly what appeals to you personally and find people who like it as much as you do. Maybe it won’t be currently “in-style” but you’re right in that trends change overnight now and I think we’re getting closer and closer to people giving up on trying to follow all the trends. Back when a trend lasted months or years, you’d look stupid not to follow it. Now you’re lucky if you even catch a trend before it’s already over.  So I guess what I was whining about could thankfully be more something of the past. It was certainly truer when Sam made that video, and probably even truer when he worked for those companies where people that had that attitude."
milliondollarextreme,33xc4u,paultownreddit,1 point,Sun Apr 26 19:43:14 2015 UTC,"People are not a direct product of the TV that they watch. The world is an extremely diverse place.  People are a product of their genetic code and environments. People pick certain television shows because of their taste, which is a product of their personality and life experiences. When a show no longer caters to a person's taste, they stop watching it. For example, if a typical 15-25 y/o male watches keeping up with the Kardashians, they will change the channel, rather than adopt the traits and world views of the show's main characters. People around you might be less likely to shun those that are different from them because they're growing older and maturing. Walmart and commercials will always cater to the lowest common denominator and appropriate marketable culture for their own financial gain. This says nothing about the people who buy these products besides the fact that they can't afford / don't care to spend money on more expensive clothes. People might adopt slang and speech patterns from the culture they consume, but that's just how language evolves. If you think people are actually ""becoming"" the people they see on TV, you're very stupid."

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”  I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.  The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.  When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

Also there was a conspicuous lack of evidence surrounding the whole youtube channel takedown, and when the channel came back all the videos magically had like 10x more views.  I think he took down the main channel and then linked the backup channels to his main channel so that they would boost the view count.

milliondollarextreme,33f1o7,thorin92,3,Wed Apr 22 01:00:00 2015 UTC,"Trouble over the Wu stuff. He used to post a lot in a secret board on the Chris Chan forum and implied that he wasn't able to talk about Wu at all. He posted about upcoming plans and ideas regarding the future of DN and his WDG site and whenever the subject of Wu came up he just said he couldn't talk about it. Now his profile and subforum are set to private, and sites related to DN are offline too.  Something obviously went down."

If the mods Sam got to do the Thanksgiving live stream indiscriminately spam banning people out of the chat wasn't enough, Sam has shown a good number of times he couldn't give half a shit about what any of us have to say. Do you honestly think I would post this & be like ""haha Sam is gunna think I'm funny cuz I found where that sound effect was from!"" Are you that fucking aspergers ridden?  I just had always wondered what program the sound was from on the bioshock video, & went I finally found it, I thought I would put it here.  If I had some incredibly well thought out & hilarious counter-culture comedy bullshit with some cute little underlying fuck you message, this is the last place I would put it.
