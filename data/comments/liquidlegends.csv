liquidlegends,3e03u8,shdwfeather,2,Mon Jul 20 22:46:21 2015 UTC,"Xpecial plays such an important part in TL, even faker has bad games. Xpecial plays the popcorn kernel of TL, his main job is to make CLG choke."
liquidlegends,3e03u8,Watermelonhypetrain,2,Mon Jul 20 23:52:50 2015 UTC,"I don't know if Xpecial ever checks this sub, but I just wanted to say in case he does that ever since I saw this small interview when he first joined the team I have had high hopes that he would be a strong leader for Crs/Liquid. I just wanted to say hes writing whole new chapters in our history, bring us one game away from worlds, finishing above 4th for the first time in our teams history, us having the best and most stable regular season we have ever had. Xpecial you have already done great things for our team and now you are so close to accomplishing your main goal of taking Liquid to worlds there are still more chapters left to write I know you have hit a small rough patch lately, but I have 100% confidence you will be able to pull yourself out of it, finish strong and take us to worlds. Keep working hard and Thank you for all that you've done. As a loyal liquid fan I have faith. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL9fJY_Rswg"
liquidlegends,3dx014,kondor35,11,Mon Jul 20 06:00:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's between Piglet, Move, FeniX, and Bunny Fufuu. Tough call."
liquidlegends,3dx014,motivate18,3,Mon Jul 20 09:53:02 2015 UTC,I completely agree but I think it will probably be move because they talk about his dramatic impact on Gravity soooo much.
liquidlegends,3dx014,XsickxplayX,4,Mon Jul 20 12:05:30 2015 UTC,Move is gonna get rookie of the split
liquidlegends,3dx014,leaffeon,2,Mon Jul 20 13:51:19 2015 UTC,"If it is not Move, I can easily see BunnyFuFu getting MVP. Honestly I think it is between Piglet and Bunny. Piglet because of his insane play and never losing lane. And Bunny because of the massive improvement of Gravity from the last split to this split largely done by his shot calling."
liquidlegends,3dx014,TheDigitized,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:00:06 2015 UTC,"I want to also put rush up there, he is definitely a huge reason why TiP was able to go on their crazy surge they are on now."
liquidlegends,3dx014,Thr-ne,7,Tue Jul 21 13:00:41 2015 UTC,"I agree, not just because of his KDA but like you said, his consistency. I don't think he's lost a 2v2 lane this split and you can always rely on him to carry the game."
liquidlegends,3dx014,waveykhan,6,Mon Jul 20 07:13:29 2015 UTC,And in the end Bjergsen will win it.
liquidlegends,3dx014,butwhathappenedwas,2,Mon Jul 20 14:02:58 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree. Other contenders include Fenix, Aphromoo and maybe BunnyFuFu (because I feel like a Gravity player should be on there but none of them have stood out because they've done so well as a team so I figure the shot caller is a good bet), but Piglet is easily the front runner imo"
liquidlegends,3dx014,Exinih,2,Mon Jul 20 07:59:10 2015 UTC,"Piglet can likely break the kda record, because he will probably go off against team 8 and do well against impulse."

liquidlegends,3dx014,TheBoyWonder11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:04:52 2015 UTC,12.3 or 12.7
liquidlegends,3dx014,Watermelonhypetrain,2,Wed Jul 22 02:48:28 2015 UTC,"Considering the stats that Piglet has been putting out, his play hasn't generated a lot of attention.  He's been the OP5 ADC twice, but hasn't been named the MVP of a week.  I agree that he has been ultra-reliable and a huge part of the team's success, but I feel like it's been overlooked by a lot of people.  If you were to ask fans who had the highest KDA, I don't think a lot would guess correctly."
liquidlegends,3dx014,CodeBaKaNa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:09:51 2015 UTC,"I would say either piglet or fenix may get it. Fenix has shown he is more comfortable on stage with his play, and does really well in landing phase now (don't recall any 1v1's going against him in mid), but I do think piglet will get it"
liquidlegends,3dx014,Hounmlayn,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:44:11 2015 UTC,I think Move is up there. Hes been the active piece that has helped GV surge up the standings. Doublelift has also had a more impressive split (Probably not MVP caliber).  My candidates would probably be:  1.)Piglet  2.)Move  3.)Fenix  4.)Bjerg  5.)Really close between XwX and Doublelift

liquidlegends,3dw6w9,Illegallyepic3,2,Mon Jul 20 23:40:02 2015 UTC,"It actually is rather plausible that if we got second we could get to worlds, just because I feel like it would be TIP vs. TSM for 3rd/4th, and I feel like Impluse could take it as long as the new support doesn't mess everything up. So that makes me rather hopeful. Either way we are just going to get first to it doesn't matter!"
liquidlegends,3dw6w9,10people,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:53:17 2015 UTC,If Liquid beats TiP and goes 2-0. We most likely will have auto-qual for worlds. I think
liquidlegends,3dw6w9,BanjoStory,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:38:56 2015 UTC,We'll probably be in a tie-breaker scenario with CLG for the second seed.  They've got an easy schedule next week.

liquidlegends,3dv4pq,Sohyang,3,Sun Jul 19 19:47:48 2015 UTC,"He's really good on Corki though, just Corki isn't as capable of hard carrying games as much so as other ADCs"
liquidlegends,3dv4pq,Tanexor,4,Sun Jul 19 21:09:06 2015 UTC,I know it was just NME but that game was so refreshing to watch after yesterday's mishap. TL dominated in every aspect of the game and looked so good in teamfights. Awesome to see going into the last week of the split
liquidlegends,3dv4pq,Ruthless_Boss,2,Sun Jul 19 19:49:11 2015 UTC,The kiting at the early dragon fight was beautiful. Whole team just slowly moving backwards keeping FeniX alive and dishing out damage on NME as they chased.
liquidlegends,3dv4pq,motopitchman,3,Sun Jul 19 21:48:52 2015 UTC,"One of the great things about TL this season was their consistency when facing bottom half teams. Even if NME made it easy for us, it was nice to see a clean snowball.  Edit: Also, I'm impressed at the quick turnaround they made on the 2v1 strategy. NME used the same 2v1 that CLG did, but this time we had a response for the top lane freeze. Serious props to the support staff and the team for being able to adjust their early game basically overnight for this game."
liquidlegends,3dv4pq,shdwfeather,2,Sun Jul 19 21:12:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was my #1 concern going into the split, and they've definitely alleviated my worries. The worst team they've lost to is DIG, which is acceptable even if not exactly desirable."
liquidlegends,3dv4pq,ReOsIr10,3,Sun Jul 19 22:02:07 2015 UTC,"Xpecial was truly incredible in this game, nice to see him bounce back."
liquidlegends,3dv4pq,motivate18,2,Mon Jul 20 09:54:03 2015 UTC,100% kill participation in bot lane with both Piglet and Xpecial on comfort picks.
liquidlegends,3dv4pq,Lsky72,2,Sun Jul 19 19:50:05 2015 UTC,This made up for the loss against Choke Logic Gaming. So awesome to see the guys wrecking! #TLWIN
liquidlegends,3dv4pq,DylanFrostTurtle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:17:40 2015 UTC,"I always doubt the Kalista pick b/c in crazy passive games if you don't win lane or lane swaps etc. it can become useless. Here we made great use of it with that dive and it was very exciting to see us make aggressive plays early. Also the Fizz kinda shut himself down with the double jungle, I'm not sure if NME could do anything about it but that was a huge relief that we didn't have to worry about a fed fizz again."
liquidlegends,3dv4pq,Zanacorfe,2,Sun Jul 19 19:50:54 2015 UTC,"Week 9, Day 2. TIP vs TL. the most important game of the split. It makes my head hurts how important this one is for us. (Assuming we would beat T8)"
liquidlegends,3dv4pq,xSensei,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:13:37 2015 UTC,"That was a good one to watch for the first time with you guys.  Was a bit nervous at the very beginning, but TL played that just about as perfect as they possibly could."
liquidlegends,3dv4pq,CodeBaKaNa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:43:33 2015 UTC,"I feel nme will bounce back next split, they seem to have lots of raw talent but poor shot calling and pick/bans."
liquidlegends,3dv4pq,Watermelonhypetrain,2,Mon Jul 20 23:51:03 2015 UTC,Report Quas for feed.
liquidlegends,3dt0i9,akhelios,9,Sun Jul 19 04:15:06 2015 UTC,"There's a few differences between GV's game and our game. First of all, CLG had a crazy fed Fizz which nobody in TL could go up against. If we tried to force a tower, Fizz would have split pushed us to death. Also, DIG was honestly pretty bad controlling vision and snowballing the game which allowed GV to make more trades than we could have.  Our pick ban was okay. Once we locked in Janna/Corki/Viktor/Rek'sai, Hecarim was our best answer to Ezreal for the backline dives and flank initiations. We saw that Quas (despite being pretty far down) successfully assassinated Pobelter a number of times with good TP plays. Of course, life would have been easier if we picked Alistair instead of Janna, but Saint mentioned in a VOD review today that Xpecial didn't seem comfortable on the champion, so perhaps TL wanted to avoid it.   The single biggest reason why we lost today was how far Hecarim fell behind because of being zoned off a massive wave after interrupting the Fizz TP. We didn't get to coordinate the double Trinity power spike and lost our mid-game power, which was fatal because CLG had the better scaling comp. We made some nice plays around Baron and as well as some misplays, but honestly, everything is eclipsed by the overwhelming impact of the 2v1. If this was a scrim, they would have gg'd and remade after the first 10 mins. Luckily, early game stuff is easier to practice than major teamfight issues, so hopefully they will iron this out for play-offs."
liquidlegends,3dt0i9,shdwfeather,0,Sun Jul 19 07:12:24 2015 UTC,"The hecarim pick was just bad honestly, yes quas did ok considering the circumstances.   But look at the comp ali, trist, ezreal, gragas, and even a fizz. Hecarim couldn't stick to a squishy long enough to kill anyone, even if he had gotten a 1v1 lane and equal farm, hell even if he'd trashed zion in lane, i don't see how hecarim does his job.  Honestly they needed to go something that would beat fizz in lane and in a split push post mid game or pick something that could tank poke forever and hard engage. And i can't think of any pick off the top of my head that could fill that role, i think our draft was really bad this game and clg did enough with a better composition to win. Despite imo their team individually being weaker than ours."
liquidlegends,3dt0i9,myfutur3,2,Sun Jul 19 08:58:12 2015 UTC,"Hecarim wasn't bad. You said it yourself; we had to sacrifice laning or team fighting. Hecarim was the best pick in that situation where all other picks were locked. If Hecarim was even with Fizz, it prevents the uncontrollable Fizz split push and coordinates with Corki's Trinity spike to push down turrets to generate a mid-game gold lead. The role of Hecarim in a teamfight is a flank teleport from an area where the enemy is blind and one-shotting a carry before the enemy can disengage. With a mid-game gold lead, we could have set up the vision to pull off such plays.  If we're looking at the pick/ban as a whole, yes, there were problems and I agree that CLG came out with an advantage. However, it wasn't a huge, insurmountable advantage. We could have won with the picks. The early game was the much larger issue."
liquidlegends,3dt0i9,shdwfeather,0,Sun Jul 19 09:06:55 2015 UTC,True i could right an in depth analysis and continue this discussion but im on mobile and it sucks to format long post's
liquidlegends,3dt0i9,myfutur3,3,Sun Jul 19 09:31:06 2015 UTC,"I think some of it has to do with our pick and ban phase. A lot of our losses have come from games with questionable picks and bands, choosing champs that give us the disadvantage or picking champs that are easy to shut down while doing nothing to prevent the shut down from happening. Today's comp. did not even try to shut down the ez comp, there was no hard lock down like Mao, even though he was open, and we had too many team reliant champs rather than carry champs. This isn't to say the shot call isn't the problem, that is a huge problem in both the calls and willingness to follow when on the losing end, as could be seen in the last TL v GV game. I'm just happy that these losses show our weaknesses during the split instead of playoffs so we have time to improve for playoffs."
liquidlegends,3dt0i9,EpicCenter134,3,Sun Jul 19 05:37:40 2015 UTC,That Janna is what imo killed us. Ap ezreal loses to hard engage so we needed a thresh/shen to dive the backline. Whatever only one loss
liquidlegends,3dt0i9,DylanFrostTurtle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:49:22 2015 UTC,Quas just shouldn't have stopped the tp he would have had a freeze top lane and been ahead of fizz. Can't really say liquid has no idea what their doing off 1 misplay
liquidlegends,3dt0i9,piratejuic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:05:27 2015 UTC,"If he did not stop the TP, it was a guaranteed 4v2 dive bot, where Piglet and Xpecial would've both died without a shadow of a doubt. They ended up putting Hec behind, instead of all of CLG ahead. The position of the wave is what hurt, but you live and learn."
