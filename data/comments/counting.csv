Noticeable progress.   200k-300k took 179 days to complete  300k-400k took 232 days to complete. That was because our pace plummeted just after getting 300k. Data to support this below.   And the most significant observation:  300k-350k took 172 days to complete, whereas   350k-400k took only 60 (!) days to complete, which is three times less than the first half. Excitement over the milestone? Or an influx of new users? I guess both, to some degree. Mentioning our sub elsewhere on reddit a couple of times brought many people who stayed for longer. Yup, except for me, the lucky child, who found it via r/random, most of us probably got here this way.   So... Let's get that 450k done before the end of summer, and 500k will be plain sailing.
