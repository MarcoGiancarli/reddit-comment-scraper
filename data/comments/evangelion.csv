Otakon itself can't even use photography from within the event to promote the event, we have to shoot outside or elsewhere, the only exception (I believe) being photoshoots within the convention center where you're shooting on a backdrop, so you're not actually photographing the venue in any way.

She says something like ""Everywhere can be Paradise as long as you are alive"". Then they awake in a devastated world, but Shinjis suicidal mentallity is still gone, thanks to his new resolve (The moment he stops choking her, which was a callback to the near-instrumentallity scene, where he didn't stop and started instrumentallity. The choking was a direct metaphor of wanting to live or wanting to die) even under this provokative situation.

There is no official source on what happened after that last scene but we can assume for sure that more people than just Asuka and Shinji have the resolve to live their own lives. If enough people come back, civilization will be rebuilt. This however, is the realm of fanfiction. If you're interested, the fanfiction 2018 A.D. deals partly with this. It can be found on ff.net even though it was abandoned by its author and if IIRC it also includes Mana from the Girlfriend of Steel series."

evangelion,3dt1xn,antelopeking,14,Sun Jul 19 04:48:56 2015 UTC,"""Subtitute"" oh why must you ruin such an epic picture? I'd totally get these posters though and frame them because these are fucking amazing!!"
evangelion,3dt1xn,theradicalbanana,3,Sun Jul 19 05:39:12 2015 UTC,This is wonderful
evangelion,3dt1xn,mshimoura,2,Sun Jul 19 14:00:24 2015 UTC,Is there a higher resolution of this one? I'd love to have it as a wallpaper :)
evangelion,3dt1xn,axiobeta,10,Sun Jul 19 23:06:41 2015 UTC,"Amazing stuff, especially Asuka. Wouldn't mind these framed"
evangelion,3dt1xn,mechawreckah,16,Sun Jul 19 07:29:22 2015 UTC,"I really like these. I find most posters have the female pilots a little sexualized, and while its super awesome, I can't really hang something like that up on my wall and not feel awkward when people come over. This, however, is just the right balance of showing the pilots, the robits, and nobody's being shown in an overly sexual way"
evangelion,3dt1xn,Komodo135,5,Sun Jul 19 13:01:27 2015 UTC,My brother and I got all three for $20 at AX this year. They are a stunning combo all together.
evangelion,3dt1xn,SILVERG7,2,Sun Jul 19 13:06:14 2015 UTC,"new wallpaper material! :) loved it, thank you"
evangelion,3dt1xn,CorpDelta,2,Sun Jul 19 08:54:07 2015 UTC,And there goes a significant part of my paycheck for some nice frames.

evangelion,3dti66,mrcooliest,6,Sun Jul 19 08:29:28 2015 UTC,Made my day
evangelion,3dti66,ForFB,3,Sun Jul 19 14:32:00 2015 UTC,Wonderful improvement. Honestly thought my stream froze when I got to that scene.
evangelion,3dti66,Agent117,5,Sun Jul 19 14:57:16 2015 UTC,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jna_dE_O4SA This one's even better IMO.
evangelion,3dti66,UmanTheInimitable,2,Sun Jul 19 15:12:41 2015 UTC,Amazing.
evangelion,3dti66,higuy8000,2,Sun Jul 19 14:45:49 2015 UTC,I love this fuckin' fanbase.
evangelion,3dti66,TeaPoweredGames,2,Sun Jul 19 23:57:24 2015 UTC,I dont know what i was expecting.
evangelion,3dti66,sebbodes,2,Mon Jul 20 04:12:08 2015 UTC,"I was hoping this would be a Rebuild scene where they were fighting, and then cut to The Shining scene where the elevators open and blood pours out."

evangelion,3dv35g,Baka_Mark,4,Sun Jul 19 19:33:02 2015 UTC,Your best bet would probably be to order it from Amazon.co.jp. They have the cheapest price I've been able to find on it so far and they ship outside of Japan.
evangelion,3dv35g,coolthxmcdoom,3,Sun Jul 19 19:38:10 2015 UTC,"*¥ 30,369 Japanese Yen  is kinda sorta $244.63USD  *I am not a bot. Just bored."
evangelion,3dv35g,zhiryst,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:48:58 2015 UTC,"Sadly, the high price of physical media in Japan versus the US is nothing new.  It's why some series get a really long delay between Japanese market release and NA market release, to avoid reverse importation of cheaper NA blurays."
evangelion,3dv35g,disposable-assassin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:41:56 2015 UTC,A plan that I wanted to do that definitely wouldn't be cheap would be to go over to Japan and get it there and visit the Eva museum since it'd be released on my birthday but lost my job so I can't :/
evangelion,3dv35g,husky1993a,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:22:53 2015 UTC,Would it be worth it to you if there's no English subs?
evangelion,3dv35g,Spindash54,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:47:54 2015 UTC,I would not be able to understand anything if there isn't any English subs
evangelion,3du8nz,Squiggy-Peterson,10,Sun Jul 19 15:03:18 2015 UTC,"Most of the concepts I have seen in this area has somewhat lame, but then most of my experience is from fanfics. I think Evangelion: Genocide is the only fic I remember off the top of my head that came up with some designs for Angels that was actually serviceable.  A memorably bad design is from a fic that had an Angel that was literally a huge green-skinned Goblin. I especially remember that one because the writer had in the very the same chapter decided to experiment with putting in lyrics from some metal song."
evangelion,3du8nz,Bhorium,4,Sun Jul 19 16:05:58 2015 UTC,"If you look on the Adeptus EVA irc/forum, you're bound to find some, considering it's much funner to fight original enemies in a tabletop RPG"
evangelion,3du8nz,drako125,-2,Sun Jul 19 19:05:08 2015 UTC,accidentally falls on angel and begins glowing and ascending upward
evangelion,3dskm7,eggydrums115,6,Sun Jul 19 01:25:31 2015 UTC,I can't find other animes to do what Eva does for me. I recommend checking out some Ingmar Bergman. The last movie of his  watched was Autumn Sonata.
evangelion,3dskm7,slavetothought,3,Sun Jul 19 03:55:00 2015 UTC,"Same, there's just something in Evangelion that can't quite be matched by anything I've seen in anime.  There's something genuinely human about it that I haven't seen anywhere else, sure other shows might try to replicate a certain humanity, and are really good shows. But they don't have the same effect."
evangelion,3dskm7,spacemonkey1357,2,Sun Jul 19 13:07:01 2015 UTC,So how many nightmares did you have last night?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b46F7afDQbE
evangelion,3dskm7,pieindaface,2,Sun Jul 19 06:31:51 2015 UTC,"I actually love that scene. They pretty much teased it one or two episodes before by showing the same door opening animation.  And no, no nightmares. Just hours of thinking and thinking"
evangelion,3dskm7,pieindaface,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:09:22 2015 UTC,better man than me thats all I can say.
evangelion,3dskm7,Havik2537,2,Sun Jul 19 14:23:15 2015 UTC,My favorite of all time. What's your top?
