We should start giving more funding for engineering better viruses to cull the population of undesirables before its too late. We managed a feat of social engineering in radicalizing the muslims and demoralizing minority youth via government programs like head start and affirmative action, but more needs to be done ensure the violence not only continues, but grows."
besteurope,3dzrvc,besteurope,0,Mon Jul 20 21:17:14 2015 UTC,"The idea that governments can change the way markets operate is entirely illusory.   it is an essential part of social democracy to step in where markets fail, and this has been proven as efficient so far.   for example chemical companies don't pay horrendous amounts of money to dispose toxic garbage because the market demands it, but because governments made them do it.   If a worker A’s skills don’t have enough value for an employer B to pay A the minimum wage the government forces him to pay, B will not hire A.   but if b depends on a and his colleagues to make money, without a minimum wage he can use a's desperation. so especially in fields where workers don't need to be too skilled it becomes a race to the bottom.  so when b pays all other employees of that low skill labour field he depends on 5 pounds per hour  and a says 'pay me 7' he won't get hired. market.  but when the government steps in and says that b needs to pay every low skilled employee 7 pounds he won't have much of a chance instead of hiring people at this wage.   Raising the minimum wage means that the competition for jobs will be harder, and all those job-seekers who were barely employable at the previous wages but don’t possess the qualities that justify the higher cost now required for their work will simply be left out of the economy without any prospect for employment.   companies tend to hire as little as possible. they need to keep their business running but if you are paying people to little they are still expensive. in the aforementioned numbers even the very low wage will be expensive in the long term (585*52 = 10.400). simple maths still leaving a bit out but the bottom line is that workers are expensive even when you don't pay them sufficiently, so an employer will hire just as many people as he has to one way or another.   In the end, this will make the cost of living higher, which results in the reduction of real income, including wages and salaries.   the reason why people think about introducing a minimum wage is because the cost of living are already to low. if there are people who work full time and can still barely afford essentials then they are not getting payed enough.    The right way for a worker or job seeker to get a higher salary is different. He should make himself more valuable, more worthy of being hired at a greater cost for his employer by studying hard, getting sought-after skills, refining his talents and working hard.   this may be hard to understand for a philosophy graduate and writer but this isn't really an option everybody has. if you look at low skilled labourers you will find people who could maybe work their way up, but you will also find people that are at their maximum in this field of work.  also if everybody on a assembly line studies really hard to become a supervisor there are still at best two positions per shift to be filled with that position. the rest can be qualified all they want, if they don't make they can still barely afford a living.   A government’s diktat, instead, is an artificial method, and as such it backfires.   like environmental diktats, or workers rights, or safety regulations etc. etc.   There are no shortcuts in the economy, no free lunch in business.   but there are marges that don't have to be maximised at all expense.    But even in the so-called capitalist, or free-market economies, when governments succumb to the temptation to meddle with the marketplace, they practically introduce small elements of socialism, which unbalance the market and cause grave damage to the very people they pretend to help.   eww 'elements of socialism' lol  markets need to be controlled to some extend and they are pretty much everywhere in the developed world.  more in some places and less in others, however i wouldn't even want to be near a country where the government doesn't 'meddle with the market balance' because this would be a dystopia in the making.  also as far as i'm concerned the countries that are totally ruining the market seem to do just fine.  shit i'm bored..."
