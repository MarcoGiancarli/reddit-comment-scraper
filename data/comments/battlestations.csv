battlestations,3e1swa,william12211,4,Tue Jul 21 13:52:55 2015 UTC,"Obviously this is a very unpopular opinion in this sub, but I'm going to have to agree with you. The function keys are right next to the number keys, basically adding more keys within ""main rotation"" range for gaming that you can easily use all the time versus keys you'd only be able hit occasionally. I have pretty large hands and the reach is too far on a standard keyboard layout to bind skills I'm constantly using without getting hand cramps after a while.  I wouldn't even want to play an MMO without the Apple keyboard or one similarly laid out. However, I do prefer a regular keyboard for FPS games since it's much easier for me to pad down on the ctrl key. I know mice exist with tons of extra buttons on them, but I just prefer it this way."

However I'm seriously considering buying a mechanical TKL... only heard great things but never had one long enough to test (and likely never will without buying one). Since you do coding as well and tried a mechanical against apple's keyboard (which I'm assuming is quite like the one on mbair 13'') what's your opinion for someone who types with a lot of pressure?

battlestations,3e1swa,william_13,7,Tue Jul 21 16:45:39 2015 UTC,"VMware Player/Workstation is capable of running OS X up to 10.10 from Windows. This is against the EULA of OS X (as is installing OS X on a PC in the first place, so I guess it's okay to discuss this aspect on this sub too). You'll need a tool named VMware Unlocker for this. VMware Unlocker is available in the Misc download section of InsanelyMac.  The VM is not pleasant to use as it lacks hardware graphics acceleration, but will do just fine for creating an installation medium with the OS X installer and Clover. I recommend against using any prebuilt images from various release groups, they usually break on updates and I would not necessarily trust them either."

Nevertheless just google your mobo model and gpu before just to check whether someone had any problems.   Component wise, I'd strongly recommend having a disk only for os x. It will save you from a lot of trouble with boot manager and updates later on.  ninja edit: I've been using os x for some 4 years on a asus motherboard, and just recently had to replace the mobo to another asus and still works like a charm."

Since I technically broke it, I was dubious I would get a replacement. Since I was busy (it was near finals) and didn't want to deal with all that, I ditched them. They had also caused me a bit of a headache at a few points with some driver issues (I googled and it was common, so were the fragile joints), so I said screw it and went with a pair of Grados.

Yes it takes a lot to power games at that native resolution, but I'm fine with 1080p until tech catches up. I'm currently using a 900p monitor, so I'm sure that helps.  But the idea of having 4 1080p monitors in front of me is tempting. I watch a ton of Netflix, and to be able to have 2 or 3 other things going while watching a stream at full resolution is highly tempting.   And since I wouldn't be getting anything smaller than 32"" with a 4k resolution, I could opt to full screen a game or stream and enjoy it from several feet behind my computer chair.

As I've heard it isn't very good for smaller hands. Also are the brown switches good? Finally is it worth the price when you can buy a full sized mechanical keyboard for that price?? Thanks :)"
battlestations,3duwdv,Diox788,2,Sun Jul 19 20:00:27 2015 UTC,"I do have big hands.. I would say that it is a factor, because although the Orbweaver is adjustable, it requires a bit of an effort for me to hit the top row of buttons unless I lean forward with my hand.   That said, I can't recommend the Orbweaver highly enough for games with lots of controls such as MMORPGs, or in fact any game where you have customised the mapping for it. Using it is a lot more ergonomic in long sessions than a keyboard, and it feels better than my Das Keyboard, even though they both use brown cherry keyswitches.  The difference between the brown and blue Cherry keyswitch versions is the sound and 'feel'. I opted for the browns because my (now ex) girlfriend used to complain about the sound. I think I would prefer the browns if you are sharing a place with someone else. They feel so much better than my previous non-mechanical keyboard, and I don't have any problems gaming or using them for extended typing sessions. See /r/keyboards for more advice on the switches than I can give here."

battlestations,3dq720,funeralfrost,37,Sat Jul 18 11:11:42 2015 UTC,What do you think about the DXRacer chair
battlestations,3dq720,MrPS3skills,16,Sat Jul 18 12:13:06 2015 UTC,"I just bought one last week (Racing series) and so far it's a nice chair. The best part is it's not just foam glued to some plyboard; It's a massive foam piece that is supported to the frame by a few giant elastic straps underneath - squishy foam, but when you sit down on it, it's overall firm. The pillows are a nice feature although I fidget a lot so the lumbar pillow typically falls down and I have to adjust it - minimal issue. My only real complaint is that commonly online the R-series is labeled as a ""wide"" seat size and that's definitely not true. I'm a pretty average 5'11"" 175lb, medium build, and the seat is pretty narrow. I'm a guy, so I tend to sit with my legs open a bit, but this chair restricts that because of the racing seat wings. It's not a deal breaker, but I can't lounge like I did in my last chair."
battlestations,3dq720,clush,4,Sat Jul 18 15:05:34 2015 UTC,I have the same problem with my D series chair. Wish I had gone with an M or U series where the seat wings area is more foam instead of empty space.
battlestations,3dq720,bs000,2,Sat Jul 18 17:31:57 2015 UTC,"I bought the R-series 3 months ago. They really hurt my shoulders, because if you look at the photos, the seat at the height of your shoudlers arc to the front. For me (I'm pretty average build), the chair forces to arc my shoulders which hurts after a while. I have to get rid of the chair unfortunatly."
battlestations,3dq720,liosnel,15,Sun Jul 19 10:58:25 2015 UTC,"It's very comfortable, but I wish I shelled out a bit more one one that could lock the tilted seat function. Well worth the price though!"

battlestations,3dq720,DXRacer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:06:39 2015 UTC,"I thought so too, but unless I'm doing something wrong I can't lock it."
battlestations,3dq720,iamraw,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:55:54 2015 UTC,Maybe /u/DXRacer could confirm?
battlestations,3dq720,Entropy1982,3,Sun Jul 19 11:25:09 2015 UTC,"Hey there!  If you're referring to the recline, yes! All of our chairs can lock into any reclined position between 90 degrees and 170 degrees.  If you're referring to rocking the seat back, all of our chairs can rock, but not all of them lock into a rocked back position. That's the primary benefit of chairs with the dual mechanism. That secondary mechanism is what allows a user to lock into any rocked position.  Chairs that feature dual mechanisms: Iron Series Max Series (MN models) King Series (PC Models)  Hope this helps!"
battlestations,3dq720,ahighlifeman,4,Mon Jul 20 14:33:12 2015 UTC,"I have the k series of this chair which is the largest they sell and it's the most comfortable I've sat in. I paid around $400 for it and it's well worth the money. Also, I saw you ask about the quality and it's really good in my opinion it has a steel frame with a life time warranty and it supports 400 pounds."
battlestations,3dq720,Entropy1982,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:02:30 2015 UTC,"Question for you,  I am considering also getting a DX Racer. One of the things that attracts me most to the K series is how much customerization the arm rests have. I am only 5'6"" and under 150 lbs so I don't need the added support, but the added functions with the ""4d arm rests"" seems like that is worth it alone. It seems like the smaller series don't have these functions.  Edit: It seems Max and King series look the best to me just from their descriptions. I wonder if i'm too short for those though  Thoughts?"
battlestations,3dq720,ahighlifeman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:38:28 2015 UTC,The armrests are really the only thing I don't like about mine. Both the lack of adjustments and the cheap feel of them. They are pretty much the only parts of the chair made of plastic and the tops aren't very comfortable. They seriously just don't fit with the quality of the rest of the chair.
battlestations,3dq720,Entropy1982,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:11:14 2015 UTC,"Hmm, does this apply to all the series? I'm pretty picky with my arm rests"
battlestations,3dq720,ahighlifeman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:28:00 2015 UTC,"I don't have one with the fancy armrests you described, so I don't know about those. Mine has the standard armrests that can only adjust height."

battlestations,3dq720,Entropy1982,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:16:10 2015 UTC,"Looking at their website, I don't think they sell it anymore. I ordered the FE57, but they dropped it in the warehouse shipping it, and it was the last one. They let me pick any other chair they had in stock to replace it, so of course I traded up. I cannot remember what series it was for sure though, and I picked the new one over the phone so the order still has the FE57 on it. I want to say it was a drifting series, but they don't have that on their site anymore."
battlestations,3dq720,iamraw,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:44:32 2015 UTC,"Get the Max, I have one and the arms are full adjustable.  My wife is 5'4"" and she's okay in the chair - it has to be almost at the lowest for feet to touch the floor but it's still comfortable."
battlestations,3dq720,Entropy1982,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:40:51 2015 UTC,Thanks dude. Will be going with this one.
battlestations,3dq720,NoBluey,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:46:21 2015 UTC,"Idk if my opinion still matters but I love the king series because of the way I sit I love to have a lot of room to move. Height wise if your shorter it is definitely a problem unless you don't mind having your feet hang. I am 6'2 and my feet are barely on the ground when the chair is fully up, in my opinion bigger is better but it's all up to the way you sit. I also heard the smaller chairs has a smaller back rest in width so if your a skinnier guy the smaller chair fits better but you can never go wrong with big."
battlestations,3dq720,Stifleroo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:05:26 2015 UTC,It's actually pretty important for me to have my feet planted firmly on something. My back hurts if they are not. I have a foot rest that I bought that I'm using with my current chair so I actually don't mind using the foot rest. Desk heights are usually high enough where even if the chair goes lower I can't really sit lower or my elbow angle would make my wrists hurt.  I appreciate your input. I think this is the series I'll be going for.
battlestations,3dq720,upallhours,2,Tue Jul 21 18:13:53 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm deciding between that and something like the IKEA Markus which I hear is quite ergonomic.

Any issue I've had, they've either shipped parts or sent a tech to my house.  No doubt I'll get 12 years of good service out of it and save dough in the long run.  tl;dr herman miller is cheaper in the long run"

The a leg you can set at any height but you need tighten them each by hand. The tleg look like they might have those little bolts that snap into place at certain heights so you could set it at intervals of ten, but I have no idea honestly. Also I personally think the aleg look better no matter what. Also they don't sell the black at Ikea anymore sadly. Check Craigslist if you want that one."

battlestations,3dpdz4,Junesrawr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:42:25 2015 UTC,"Yes. I haven't owned many gaming PC cases personally or dealt with many others, but compared to my previous Antec P183, this one is just way, way better (and about the same price as what I paid for the Antec). Basically the pros with the Enthoo Luxe is that it has lots of features and space like other more expensive cases but a lot cheaper and feels just as solid. It looks great and I'm likely to re-use it in future builds, and classy so the style won't go out of date.  I was deciding between the Fractal Define R5 and H440, both of which are really popular and well-reviewed, until I found out about the Phanteks Luxe. I ended up getting this mainly due to the size and LEDs and saw more long-term potential with it."
battlestations,3dpdz4,YourPersonality,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:53:29 2015 UTC,Yeah I was stuck between the same cases until I saw the enthoo luxe. I got the white version but it is an extremely nice case with excellent cable management.

I'm aware that 1080p is not the greatest for the 980 ti, but it's what I have right now and it still works.  At the moment I think there was only an Acer Predator monitor that fit what I wanted, and that was still about $1k.

The speakers are about 9 inches high, they won't fit under the shelf, however they're just under 6 inches wide and if you could add a tiny bit of height to the legs they could fit on their sides, it's so, so close to being a perfect fit http://imgur.com/NHh9TWK"

battlestations,3diaeo,chickenisgreat,22,Thu Jul 16 14:25:09 2015 UTC,"I built a new gaming/coding rig recently, and the environment didn't match the awesomeness of the computer. To add to it, all my nerd shit was starting to pile up around the house, and I needed a contained nerd area for all of it.  One thing led to another, and the other day I found myself walking around IKEA for seven hours picking out the desk, shelves, and other accessories. Five trips to Lowe's later, here I am. I'm really happy with how it turned out.  Some points:   The ""desk"" is just two IKEA tables pushed together.  I like having the desk space to the left - good area to mess with my build while still having a computer in front of me, or to do general nerd things. The adjustable work lamps are awesome, and stupid cheap. They mount to the back of the desk (I hate having small lamps with gigantic bases that waste space). When I'm working on my build, I can have them both pointed at it from two directions so I can see what I'm doing. Three monitors on the right powered by the new rig. ASUS All-in-One drives the right dual monitor, and a ~2012 Asus gaming laptop powers the left dual monitor. I don't really like the All-in-One. Cool idea, but man is it slow. Kinda wish I could hack it to do something custom with its touchscreen. Synergy connects all three boxes together so I can control them from the main PC. Guys. That mountable power block that I have on the top of the desk is the bomb. Was like $25 at Lowe's, and lets me plug in things temporarily without having to crawl under the desk. I really like having the mounted surge protectors under the desk, and my various power cables at least aren't a rat's nest on the floor, but I still want to make it look cleaner. Any suggestions?   Random links to things on the desk:   Dual monitors Dual monitor stand Triple monitor stand Anker USB Charger Anker USB Hub FiiO DAC M-Audio Speakers Mountable Power Center   Some things I still want to do:   Better switching for the monitors. Technically I could power all of them from my main rig, but I'd like to mix and match between them all.  New keyboard/mouse. I have a Das Keyboard and a Logitech MX Master at work, and need to up my game here. I wish I could bring my PC off the floor, but I don't have the space for that gigantic case. Will have to be vigilant in keeping it clean. I want to install some softer lighting - right now I have the bright work lamps or the overhead room light. Maybe some LED lights under the shelves?   As for the rig itself...I wanted to play around with overclocking, so this is my first stab at it. So far seem stable at 4.8 GHz @ 1.260V, but I want to go higher, so I bought a watercooler that I haven't installed yet. Still has an Evo 212 right now. The two 970s are also overclocked and seem stable. More intensive tests for both CPU and 970s are needed to see if it'll be sustainable. The IPS monitors are great so far - I couldn't spring for 4K just yet. Contemplated an ultrawide, but I really prefer the division of multiple monitors for coding.

battlestations,3dj3ud,Bickell,3,Fri Jul 17 01:28:56 2015 UTC,"Aeron at the office,  embody at home. Here is my take: The Aeron is a tank.  The metal frame makes the chair feel super solid and the mesh gives great support. The embody on the other hand doesn't feel nearly as solid however when you sit in the seat (after adjusting it)  you never want to get up.  I never get fatigued during long sessions.  The chair flexes and moves with me in a way that makes me feel supported all the time.  I don't get the same feeling to slouch my butt forward the same way I do in my Aeron after sitting for a extended period.   Both are great chairs and I suggest trying both but if you can swing it go with the newer version (the embody). The chair will last for a long time and the price isn't as daunting over 10+ years of use. Checking craigslist (in large markets like the bay area) you can find them new for half off sometimes (with warranty)  and used for a third (no warranty)."

I love the way the computers are hidden, yet easy to reach. The Mac Mini is running 24/7 and serves as work computer and server at the same time.  For the Mac Mini i bought a small moveable table for 19.99 that fitted perfectly in the corner of the desk. Also on that are the power bricks.   The audio interface is used to sum both signals of the computers and send the output to my headphones and the soundbar. But i use headphones most of the time and the soundbar only when i feel the need for actual bass. Attached to the headphones is a clip-on mic making it a headset, just with studio quality cans.   In the center of the table, near the monitor is a small switch. This swaps my input between Mac and PC. Thanks to the keyboard software i was able to configure the keyboard to work with Mac layout while PC simply use the native layout of the Keyboard. The game pad is wireless, even if it doesn't look like that in the image.   The giant mouse-pad carpet from Razer works in favor of this setup as i can move the pre-wired mouse/keyboard/headset combo in one motion if need room in front of the monitor.  What else.. hmm. Oh yeah.. on the left there is my new headphone rest attached to the desk. I still have to get used to using it. It kinda blocks my drawer, but that is a black hole anyway and not often used. ;)  If you want details about the hardware just ask."

That, coupled with the fact that the monitors were a little high before, inspired me to head over to Ikea and grab some couch legs to put under the shelf, lowering it and allowing me to put the speakers on top, closer to ear lever.  Another note I got a lot was that my mouse sucked (Apple Mighty Mouse). I agree that it's not the most comfortable mouse (and the Bluetooth really blows) but I really liked the scroll ball on it, so when I heard about the Logitech MX Master and its two scroll wheels, I jumped on it went it went on sale on the 4th of July.  Also FINALLY upgraded my chair game. Not a Herman Miller or anything, but much cheaper and not bad for the price. And it's designed for short people!  One last upgrade is the sound card. I still can't get the internal audio to work on my Hackintosh, so I got a used M-Audio FastTrack Pro. It's nice because I can plug in the speakers and headphones to it, as well as a microphone when I do voiceover work.  Sorry for the wall of text! I'm pretty pumped about the upgrades."

This is a great bit of gear surprisingly costing only about 100$ which is a great deal considering it has a motorized fader.   The speakers are JBL LSR4328P and sound awesome. I used to use the KRK VXT 4 but a colleague of mine was getting rid of those JLB and upgrading so I managed to snag them for half off from him.   Behind the screen there are 4 hard drives dedicated to various things.  Most importantly, since I live in LA, is the APC power converter under the desk. Can't really see it in the pictures. But it comes in handy whenever there is fraction of a second black out as there often is, it allows the computer to stay on and run for about an hour on it's battery allowing you to shut it down naturally.   I have 2 mics that I tend to use as a stereo pair when recording things like guitars or string instruments. MLK 770 which a great mic for the price.

battlestations,3d8dnv,DickTreeFactory,2,Tue Jul 14 15:03:28 2015 UTC,I use three monitors without bezel correction and I only play FPS. I never have that issue. My problem is going backwards to playing on 1 monitor (on my kids PC). My brain is now wired to expect 3 monitors. I'm certain it's not for everyone but I can definitely say you'll get used to it and after a short duration your brain won't register the bezels.
battlestations,3d8dnv,dbdev,3,Tue Jul 14 15:02:29 2015 UTC,Well yea three monitors would have the center be the exact middle. He is saying on a 4 screen set up the middle would be the bezels of the middle screens.

I have been in the process of doing a bezel removal myself on my surround, but there was an unexpected hiccup... primarily that after removing the bezels and back I found out that the entirety of the VESA mount was build into the monitor case not the monitor itself. While trying to mentally come up with a method to custom mount them, using custom VESA mounts, I have since made my own desk. I am still working on a mounting method, but want to test it out on a cracked screen before I use my good monitors. Its just finding time to wanna try it vs gaming or cuddling with the GF."
battlestations,3d8dnv,GhostfaceHecklah,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:58:57 2015 UTC,Yeah... just removed the bezel on one monitor... using a guitar pick works as if it were designed to do so!

This would allow adjustable mounts, and provide variable rotation height as well because the screws that would hold it tight could also be used as stops.     Sorry if I have given a terrible mental image, but I have it all visualized in my head, and think it will work. My desk and monitor mount alteration worked great."

It's great!  It makes things pass between your screens naturally.  Just right click your desktop and select NVIDIA Control Panel.  The third option down is Configure Surround.  You can select which monitor configuration you want to use then tweak the bezel correction space between monitors.  It turns them all into one effective monitor.  I'm running at 5920x1080 across three monitors (with 80 pixels between screens ""behind the bezels"").  Most things still behave the way you want them to (with a center screen, at least).  For example, things still maximize to just my middle screen instead of stretching impractically across them all.  I play everything from current FPS's to AoE2 on three screens now.  It's awesome."

battlestations,3d895r,PastaActual,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:33:18 2015 UTC,"Pretty well. So long as you are running 980s that have three DisplayPorts each. I'm running a pair of superclocked EVGA 980s that have three DisplayPorts each so I can run SLI and Gsync at the same time. Obviously results vary with each game, as even two 980s can't run every game maxed at 7680x1440 resolution. Elite Dangerous is pictured there running at full res and medium detail, although the finer aspects of the detail settings look very close in that game. I can run the game pretty well at full detail at that resolution, but not 100fps well."

battlestations,3d0yr7,Xander_The_Great,3,Sun Jul 12 19:41:18 2015 UTC,"speaker   AudioEngine makes some matching stands which work pretty well.  If you have some extra cash, I highly recommend IsoAcoustics stands.  They have excellent isolation and they can be tweaked in all sorts of ways to get them right for your desk/setup (they come with two different height polls as well as two different height spacers for fine tuning).  The proper size for A5+'s would be the ISO-L8R155's.  I have a pair of the smaller 130's for my CEntrance MasterClass 2504's and have been very satisfied.  I've also heard them demoed with Dynaudio monitors at an AES convention, and the difference on and off the stands was more than I expected, which just goes to show how important mechanical isolation is.  Now I just need to address the terrible acoustics around my desk which are causing me issues with standing waves and even some phasing at some frequencies.  It's currently a mess with old technology that I probably won't bother working on until I move on.  This is what it looks like if you're curious (those stupid corners are what cause me most of my acoustic problems, and I have very little room for acoustic panels): http://imgur.com/CXto9VB"

battlestations,3cz4km,TalkinBoutJesus,2,Mon Jul 13 02:44:15 2015 UTC,me  Not really its more thats its hard in this dual monitor setup you have with a tilted ultrawidescreen+Regular widescreen monitor adding another monitor and you can easily place the speakers in there proper place for optimal sound on the sides of the monitors while still tilting your monitors like that and having perfect symmetry.   Looking at it more closely I would recommend placing the left speaker right besides the left monitor tilted towards you and take the right speaker and place it closer up so it lines up with the left speaker also tilted towards you . It would be like next to your mouse pad but a little closer up. Regardless I really like your setup looks really sweet very nice case and like the shelves with the figures this really the only major flaw in it.
battlestations,3cz4km,Wonka_Vision,2,Sun Jul 12 19:48:31 2015 UTC,Same here proper speaker placement and seat arrangement for best possible sounds wins out over everything else for me. Whats worse is these look like some high quality speakers he using.
battlestations,3cz4km,Subrotow,3,Sun Jul 12 19:36:56 2015 UTC,"I think you'd much get better sound if you returned those Yamahas, got some smaller desk speakers that can go under or infront of your monitor, and put some acoustic panels behind your chair to kill the reflections.  Near Field monitors only sound really good if placed the right distance and pointed at your head.  This is the audio equivalent of buying a Quadro for gaming"

It's a wonder I never went into Computer Design.   But it wasn't until a couple of years ago that I finally transitioned from what I consider a basic computer builder to a high end computer enthusiast.    It's not just circuits and connections anymore.  It's not even about connecting all the parts and praying it all works.  Although that happens more often than it probably should. It's art now.  Maybe it's not Rembrandt, but hey it's mine.    I have always had difficulty finding passions and expressing them.

It's a great chair and reasonably priced, relatively comfortable, and no doubt it's cool looking. But if you are doing something that has you sitting/working at your computer for more than a few hours a day, I would recommend investing in a nice ergonomic office chair. I went with a Steelcase Leap v2, and while the retail price is much higher ($900 on Amazon) you can get them used on Craigslist quite often from office buildings that are shutting down for about half the price. I got mine discounted through my work, but I think it's worth every bit of the $900 retail price."

battlestations,3cwmd4,Entouchable,3,Sun Jul 12 02:24:11 2015 UTC,"My old roommate got a DX Racer chair recently, and I went and sat in it to see what the fuss was about.  It's a solid chair, and I could see the appeal to it. (On his model, the seat/cushion reclined back with the backup, while I personally like the back to recline separately from the seat cushion. I know there are models that do that, though.)  However I personally feel that the IKEA Markus chair is a superior chair. The only issue I have with the Markus is that the seat cushion has worn through, but due to the design of that chair it's a pretty simple process to reupholster it (just need a 5x5 fabric square and a staple gun)."

Dx Racers aren't bad chairs but the youtube celebrity endorsements, flashy design, and high price point for the product you get always made them seem like the ""Beats headphones"" of office chairs."
battlestations,3cwmd4,SpringerTheNerd,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:47:42 2015 UTC,"I've had one for about 3 years. It looks nice and that's about it.  Material-wise it's solid. Good fabric (not that horrible mesh stuff everyone likes to use in chairs), average-ish cushioning, and very solid metal legs and casters.  The back angle adjustment is fine..and for some reason it can lay completely flat, if you're into that..?  The arm rests are cushy rubber, and adjustable in height. my only complaint here is they aren't connected to the chair back, so headphone cords and loose fitting sleeves will get caught on them doorknob style.  Most importantly, the chair's ergonomics are very bad. The sculpted ""bucket seat"" shoulder area is way too high and wide to serve a purpose. the seat area is also sculpted, with raised sides, making cross legged sitting a bit uncomfortable.  That adjustable lumbar support pillow is essentially useless, and will slide back down to the very bottom position instantly no matter where you put it. Also the pillow cover is held together with velcro, and mine has started to come apart, leaving the sharp side of the velcro exposed.  The neck pillow is a joke as well. Not adjustable. There's actually a little butterfly-shaped piece of plastic included to clasp it into the ""windows"" at neck height on the chair back.  Basically they attached pillows to the chair as some kind of afterthought, rather than building it into the design of the chair in the first place.  I bought mine from rakuten in Japan. Maybe around $250. Would not buy again.  edit: looking at OPs chair again, he seems to have a higher tiered version. The red legs and large black addition to lower back of the chair are completely different from mine. but ergonomic design-wise, everything else is the same."

I plan to use it for singing and and to voice act for small projects if I can find any. The mic is good for vocals but not really for anything else. The reason I haven't used it yet is because my cheap ass laptop decided to finally die.  I recommend if you're looking to buy one, look up mic buying guides.

There is virtually no performance to be gained in gaming between DDR3 and DDR4 and an i5 and i7...and if Skylake is any indicator, there won't be for quite a while.

battlestations,3cstf8,nuggetinabuiscuit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:27:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not the best one to ask, as most of the gaming that I do on the screen is slow paced, such as RTS's and emulators. I do my ""modern"" gaming on a Oculus Rift DK2 (and the consumer version as soon as it comes out).  But there is a huge thread on this series of TV's over at HardForum. I've seen quotes of under 30ms of input lag, so it's not too bad as long as you either scale down to a lower resolution, turn down some detail, or have a beefy video card (Titan X, 980Ti, etc)."
battlestations,3cstf8,najiawad1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:30:57 2015 UTC,Fair enough. I guess I moreso meant does it reproduce colors pretty well and does it have the proper input for 4k@60Hz? Ive been debating what tv I want to mount over my bed for controller gaming so I dont care about 1ms blazing fast response time haha. Im rubbish at competitive games.

Meh, I played a little Heroes of the Storm on it and it ran fine, that's all I've really done though. I'm fortunate enough to have a job where I can study at work virtually the entire time, so I do quite a bit of coding related homework assignments. I got it for $1600 shipped with a GTX970. I wouldn't have paid the full price for it.  Before I was using a Surface Pro 3 on the go, and a desktop at home. It worked fine, but dealing with cloud storage and different configs and hardware setups was starting to be a pain. It's nice to have everything on one computer for home and travel but still be able to have a decent gaming video card while at home."

battlestations,3cu0ph,ClarenceWagner,2,Sat Jul 11 15:27:37 2015 UTC,plasti dip (or paint) the red to green to match the Motherboard. for the ram unless you oc'd the heck out of that ram then you can just take the metal of the vengence ram and paint the the metal easier or leave it off (hair dryer for the thermal pads) or you could pull a linus and paint the board red... that's all i've got based of visuals. can't see the keyboard so cannot comment on that. though without spces it's hard to say and  reallt dont car about what my pc looks on the inside so if that desk has enough ways to intake air and push it out the back then as long as you like it that's all that matters

battlestations,3cu0ph,thraduil,3,Sat Jul 11 14:24:53 2015 UTC,"for the ram unless the heat spreaders are more for visuals than heat dissipation plus there would be a lot of unpainted surface area on the inside of the heat sinks. I've taken apart the vengeance ram before because they were too tall for my cooler i sold that pc to my friend and it's been running 24/7 for over a year now and there is no issues with it. (there are some ram that have spreaders for a reason, but what is most likely 1600mhz kit at stock jdec specs is not one of them)  the paining was only a suggestion because you seemed to put effort in making a black and red build and then the MB didn't match the colors and painting the fans and the metal on the care is 100000x easier than trying to change the MB colors."

battlestations,3cr6r7,regmaster,2,Fri Jul 10 06:24:29 2015 UTC,"Depends on the wood you utilize, I think he used plywood which probably made the end cost around $250-275ish. If you go with an ""appearance board""(Oak/Pine) the cost will easily double."
battlestations,3cr6r7,JamesGibsonESQ,8,Fri Jul 10 11:18:00 2015 UTC,"You nailed it.    The sides of the cabinets are cabinet grade plywood (not the maple or oak ply) and were about ~37.  The fancier maple board was about ~47, but since I was painting the cabinets I thought that would be a sin to use.  All 6 cabinet sides were cut from one sheet, 23.5"" deep, 28.5"" high.    Between the sheets of plywood if you visualize them standing are shelves made from 1x12 so about 11 1/4"", 23.5"" long.  The doors were also originally the same 1x12's at 23.5"" but had to be cut down slightly with a circular saw to fit with the hinges used and to swing freely.  If you used a hinge mounted outside the face frame, you wouldn't even have to change them at all.  The top is 5/4"" pine.  This was pretty crappy at HD.  Lowes has a better selection of this and it's listed as ""Premium"" there.  It's milled square and joins easily without any gaps like you'd have with construction dimensional lumber.  It's also dryer, meaning it won't shrink like construction lumber - however it still does expand and contract with the humidity.  The finish iirc is Early American Minwax with 5 coats of foam brushed polyurethane.  My wife likes how shiny it comes out.  Costs including all the hardware were about $250.  Edit:  I'd be happy to work with anyone who knows google sketchup to make plans for anyone interested.  This is something anyone can do, and it can be scaled to pretty much any length/number of cabinets."

battlestations,3cr6r7,dorekk,2,Fri Jul 10 14:06:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks!!  Not a pro, just a guy who builds stuff outside on his uneven deck.  The wood itself is 5/4"" pine boards.  It's already predried and squared.  Once glued and joined, I used an orbital sander with 80, then 220 grit paper to smooth out the joints (caused mostly by my crappy work area).    The stain is Early American Minwax iirc, goes on really easy with a cloth pad, only takes a few minutes.  Wipe on, wipe right off.  The excess is picked up with an old shirt rag.    After the stain sets and is dry, I used a foam brush to apply gloss polyurethane, 5 coats.  If you put the brush in a ziplock bag it won't dry out between coats.  It was very humid during the process but the poly was dry to the touch within 45-60 minutes for each coat.  I did sand the poly by hand after the second poly coat to smooth it back down with a small sheet of 220 grit paper.  It might sound like a lot, but when you break it down into the parts it's very easy to do.  Would recommend practicing on scrap wood first instead of taking any chances on a finished product."

battlestations,3ct4v1,Yspadaden,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:57:58 2015 UTC,Only been a few months since I built my first PC. What do people mean by non-reference components?
battlestations,3ct4v1,SirBostonTBagParty,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:57:32 2015 UTC,"Non-reference are items that have 3rd party builds, typically seen with video cards. Nvidia and AMD are the makers (or reference) but companies like Asus, MSI, XFX, and GIgabyte make their own versions of the card that usually are tuned and have different coolers. Thus, making these versions non-reference."
battlestations,3ct4v1,tindo10,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:05:22 2015 UTC,"Ok so a card directly from the manufacturer would be a reference card and one from MSI, ASUS, or EVGA would be non-reference. Thanks for clearing that up!"
battlestations,3ct4v1,ProtectThisHaus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:11:01 2015 UTC,"Not quite. 3rd parties will build reference cards also. Nvidia and AMD will often design and build the GPU chips and design a reference card for manufacturers to follow but they won't build the cards themselves. It is up to the manufacturer to build reference cards or deviate away from the reference to improve the design if possible and have a non-reference card. With the non-reference cards, you will often find coolers with multiple fans which dump air at the back and front of the GPU; reference coolers will typically only push air outside the case which is why they are better for SLI as they are only dumping heat out of the case and not straight in to the case."

That's mostly because it has 8GB of VRAM. And the 970 only 3,5GB with very slow 0,5GB. And in games like GTA V 3,5GB of actual VRAM is very little."

battlestations,3cm6tn,Veshil,7,Thu Jul 9 05:32:05 2015 UTC,"Depending on if you buy the assembled or kit version of the printrbot depending on how confident you are at building things like this, its no harder than building a computer for example. Its pretty easy, calibration took about an hour and theirs heaps of fantastic tutorials on calibration on you tube that i followed when i was getting started. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPGpEPR6Xxc. I would highly recommend learning how to use a 3D modeling program, theres heaps of free ones out there like 123D Design. Being able to make your own parts is much more rewarding than downloading them.  Depending on what plastics you print does depend on the smell. I print primarily PLA which is made from sugar, so when its printing it sort of smells like candyfloss :P. However if you print something like ABS (what lego is made from) then it will smell like melting plastic, and can give you headaches if you dont open a window.  There sure is http://printrbot.com/shop/lcd-interface-v2/ you just need to print your own case to hold it :P  A roll of filament which is 1KG(2.2LB) last me around ~2 -3 months depending on how often i use that color and how much im printing, size of the prints etc.. Filament usually ranges from $25-50 a roll depending on the amount and the quality of the filament.  Yes i have, I brought this printer because i wanted to try 3D printing out and to see if i like it, and its has become my favorite hobby by far. The main reason i upgraded was volume, i wanted to print larger things so i was looking at other printers such as the Ultimaker 2. However i then came across this http://www.matrix-precision.com/products/metal-simple-880v2-xy-upgrade-black-edition. Which takes the normal 6""x6""x6"" up to a possible 8""x8""x10"" depending on what kit you get. And thats what i have on there at the moment. I love it and now i can pretty much print what ever i like. Depending on how well you calibrate it the print quality is onpar with something like an Ultimaker 2. So at the moment as it stands i dont want to upgrade mainly because i dont see any benefit at this point in time. Maybe in a year or 2 when they become drastically better then i will upgrade but im super happy with my Printrbot Metal.    I hope this helped :) if you have any other questions feel free to PM me. Also r/3dprinting and r/printrbot are a great source of information as well."

battlestations,3cjnw9,TheTsel,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:43:02 2015 UTC,"Glad to see I could offer up something useful.  Hey /u/snugglen, for affordable headphones that are great daily drivers, I'd recommend the HD668B from Superlux. They really do sound great. They're a semi-open, over-the-ear headphone. They come with a cinch bag to carry them in, as well as two lengths of 3.5mm extension cabling, a clip to ensure that the two cables stay connected as best as possible and a 3.5mm to 1/4"" jack adapter. They're currently $59.95 on Amazon.  Here's a link for those: http://www.amazon.com/Superlux-HD668B-Dynamic-Semi-Open-Headphones/dp/B003JOETX8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1436471306&sr=8-1&keywords=hd+668b  For a great affordable, level amp that doesn't have too much warmth to it, I'd recommend the Bravo Audio S1 solid-state amplifier. It doesn't use any tubes. I much prefer solid state amps to tube amps. It puts out great sound, and it's capable of powering higher-ohm headphones as well, in case you decide to invest in an even better set of headphones down the road. It's currently $67.99 on Amazon.  Here's a link to that: http://www.amazon.com/Bravo-Audio-S1-Headphone-Amplifier/dp/B00KABHXMC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1436471579&sr=8-1&keywords=bravo+audio+solid+state  I hope that what I suggested helps, as good audio is just as important to your gaming as your GPU (in my opinion... I'm sure plenty of other redditors/people in general would agree). I can also recommend some affordable, worthwhile mechanical keyboards if you're interested. Just let me know. :)"

battlestations,3clsrd,Steveohh72,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:55:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  I don't have much space to fit speakers on my desk. A height of 7 or 8 inches is the max that they can be and can have a depth of 5-6 inches. Width is similar.  The A2+s seemed to be the best for my situation, but if you know of a better set of speakers that I can find on non-obscure websites, then if you could let me know that would be great.  Edit: My desk is also only 4 feet wide, so that hampers stereo imaging for very large speakers."
battlestations,3clsrd,lonewolf142,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:27:38 2015 UTC,"Damn, that's pretty small. You might be stuck with the A2+s. The depth isn't too limiting, but the height probably is. If you read that review, though, they're not particularly good speakers, and he only recommends them if you require super-small speakers.  I was going to recommend the Micca MB42X (or PB42X if you just want powered speakers w/ a built-in amp) but they're 9.5 inches tall. I'm not seeing anything with 4""+ woofers (for better sound reproduction) that is under about 8.5"" tall. Maybe Mackie CR3s? Those are 8.2"" tall. Their larger speakers are well-regarded. Here's a review of the CR3 and CR4: http://www.musictech.net/2015/04/mackie-cr3-cr4-review/. These speakers even include the stands that AudioEngine make you pay like $30 for. And they're less than half the price of the A2+s."
battlestations,3clsrd,rpRj,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:33:34 2015 UTC,Hmm. I can possibly get another inch or two in height if I raise my monitor mount on the highest point on the mounting pole. It might be a bit tight... I'll look at the Miccas and Mackies.

battlestations,3ckgw9,__________-_-_______,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:25:26 2015 UTC,"Good audio drivers will effectively cancel out speaker noise, and the Yeti has the added benefit of using three smaller condenser mics and in-mic processing to allow for different modes:   cardiod (heart-shaped) is what I use.  It makes the mic most sensitive directly in front of it, then the sensitivity gets weaker as  you deviate from that.  As a result, the sounds behind are extremely weak, and on the sides are pretty weak. circumaural - equally sensitive in all directions stereo - most sensitive on the sides, like if you have a bunch of people bidirectional - for recording an interview or duets; two people on opposite sides of the mic.   No regrets on the purchase.  My one concern is how tall the mic is (and the fact that it's meant to stand straight up.  I put my left monitor as high as I could get it, but it still overlaps a bit."

battlestations,3chuh4,adambobroy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:19:35 2015 UTC,"As someone with a $500 amp, I'm guessing once you get higher and higher, you end up with more connectivity options (in terms of inputs and outputs - more specifically, balanced outputs). The HDVD800 has a DAC included as well, so that might also help increase the price (about a $400 as indicated by the site).   Also, the Sennheiser HD800 are pretty notoriously difficult to drive appropriately, so I guess the market for amps to do them justice is just going to be pricey by that very nature."
battlestations,3chuh4,adambobroy,3,Wed Jul 8 13:29:22 2015 UTC,Thanks for that I know I came off assholish but I really wanted to know the difference. What do you mean when you say the hd800 is hard to drive? Meaning they don't get enough power?
battlestations,3chuh4,JakeTF,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:32:16 2015 UTC,"Oh, I didn't interpret that comment as assholish at all! I'm sort of a new audiophile so I'm getting into it more and more myself! :D  And from what I've heard, its not so much that the HD800 require lots of power, its just that not a lot of amps can make them sound as clear and detailed as they should be. I've heard them through a Bryston BHA-1 though, and that was an absolutely splendid pairing."
battlestations,3chuh4,JakeTF,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:42:43 2015 UTC,"Very little to no difference, really. Numerous studies have proven that once you get clean power and a relatively flat response (which can be had for a couple hundred bucks, generally) there is no audible difference between amplifiers (speaker or headphone). I was just reading an article the other day (at home, unfortunately, I don't have the link right now) with tons of links about that and other audio myths.

I haven't got to play with this first-hand though as I'm holding out for CV releases next year. As far as how I hope the tech could work, I really like the way AltspaceVR will let you drag around and resize browser windows as if they are floating in front of you in virtual space. Being able to use my hands to drag around and resize windows is what I really hope for, along with the ability to customize a semi-transparent HUD of sorts that will let me keep track of IRL appointments, date/time, todo list."
battlestations,3cfmtp,x3avier,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:43:39 2015 UTC,"Both Headless Ghost and AltspaceVR look amazing. I never really realized how far VR will extend past games, it's going to be unreal. Just out of curiosity, is there a VR input you're interested in? I'm keeping my eye on Oculus Touch, though I think something like a more advanced Leap controller or VR ""gloves"" would be better in some cases."
battlestations,3cfmtp,PM_ME_A_NEW_USERNAME,3,Tue Jul 7 22:57:57 2015 UTC,"Oculus Touch, in my opinion, makes Valve's ""wands"" look like shit. The grasping and moving capability the Touch looks to afford is exactly what I am looking for when it comes to physically manipulating my workspace. I think it'll be a great stopgap until Leap Motion type controls are able to be implemented to a workable standard. I don't really have much doubt that Leap Motion or a competitor can deliver on the promise of a ""controllerless"" VR control solution within the next few years.   I have a pretty decent inkling that once this whole VR ball gets rolling, shit is going to get out-of-hand awesome pretty quickly as people begin to realize that it is the biggest thing to happen to computing since the GUI came around. Maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration on my part, but once this moves from being vaporware that is always five years out to something that people can actually go to a retail outlet and try out, people are going to demand it.   Gloves with some sort of haptic force feedback are the dream, IMHO. Once we get that down, there isn't much left but to push the resolution through the roof/increase FOV and eventually aim for jacking straight into the cranium."
battlestations,3cfmtp,x3avier,3,Tue Jul 7 23:11:03 2015 UTC,This statement! I thought I was being a bit OCD but I can't work unless each window is in a certain place at all times. I get distracted easily and move on to other tasks without finishing the current one so not having to minimize/restore/move/repeat all the time is a major help. I only have three monitors but with WinSplit Revolution I lock in certain windows to go to certain areas of the screen each time. Definitely feels as though I have 5 monitors and keeps me focused.
battlestations,3cfmtp,Clipboards,2,Tue Jul 7 21:43:03 2015 UTC,That is so neat. Thanks for sharing! I'm gonna look into WinSplit.

battlestations,3cfmtp,youmirinbro,2,Wed Jul 8 03:53:02 2015 UTC,"Wow, had no idea it was discontinued. It must have happened within the last year or so since the is when I last reinstalled my OS. Never thought to check on updates since it just works and never crashes or bugs out.   Found a relevant comment in a article from Lifehacker that's 6 years old...   So I've tried MaxTo, and I think I like WinSplit better. The differences are subtle. MaxTo splits the screen into regions that allow you to ""Maximize To"" a specific region, whereas WinSplit simply sizes and places windows based on rules that you set. WS is a bit more controllable because it sports more of an ""opt-in"" design—when you want to size & place a window, you hit a hotkey. MaxTo has more of an opt-out design—it will automatically snap certain newly opened/pop-up windows into screen regions (that you may not want it to), and it you to have to hit a hotkey to bypass that functionality. But I'm running one monitor most of the time. People with multiple monitor setups may prefer MaxTo.   Based on that last line I'm guessing it's worth a try plus that's 6 years ago so it could have only gotten better, it's only $19 as you mentioned and they have a money back guarantee. I'm making the switch today."

I'm a composer, and one of my more high paid gigs at one point was being a copiest, that meant I was given old manuscripts or handwritten documents and transcribe them in a notation program and make midi mockups of them.  That meant I had the PDF of the original manuscript, often zoomed in, a notation program, an audio editing program, a shortcut of windows alt codes (for foreign languages) and some sort of email going back and forth with a client all at the same time.  I went from 5x 1440x900 monitors in portrait to a 4k monitor.  With the right arrangement of the windows, I can't say I miss it.  I still have a tablet, watch and phone nearby for similar tasks, but I find I can still manage my workflow with the single screen.  I might add a 25"" 1080p ultrawide under my current 4k, but other than that I don't think I'll ever go back to lower resolution multiple windows."

I have had quick contacts that are only a few minutes in duration and others that have gone on and on - some very nice people out there.  After the contact you usually exchange QSO Cards - either real cards in the mail or electronic ones.

And yes to a certain extent it is just talking to other folks.  In a way - I see it like fishing.  The atmosphere is always changing and sometime you never know where your signal could be heard.  I cast out my fishing line (make a general call of CQ  which is an invitation for anyone to answer back) and I never know who I am going to talk to.  I'be been doing this for a year so far and I have had over 700 contacts from 75 different countries.  Pretty cool to chat (remember - I am doing digital modes so chatting is really typing back and forth) with folks from all over.  I talked to a guy from Easter Island - that was pretty cool.  Ham is a geek's delight - find something you are interested in and go for it - lots of room to be creative in designing your setup and then seeing what it can do....

battlestations,3cc4xi,Jotebe,7,Tue Jul 7 07:42:05 2015 UTC,The starter level of licensing is the Technician - it lets you work primarily in the VHF and UHF bands - which go a shorter distance.  BUT the test is easy and you can get a 5 watt handheld unit for cheap (http://www.amazon.com/Baofeng-Warranty-Dual-Band-Radio-Improved/dp/B00HX03AMA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1436270278&sr=8-1&keywords=baofeng&pebp=1436270501978&perid=1KVNZMV9GAYKRPTYGB0B).  You can get started for less than $50!  The handheld will allow you to connect with local repeaters that will not only give you broader coverage in your local area - but some repeaters are connected via IP between cities and you can begin to talk to people across the country.  Great way to start and meet with local HAMS!  Then you can progress onto the General licence which gives you a more complete set of HF frequency rights - this is where you start getting global coverage.  The test is a little harder but not too bad.  I took the Technician and General Exam on the same day and passed both.  Then you can get a used rig to start - Yeasu has some great values in used rigs out there that are worth getting as a  newbie!

Coming from someone who is interested (currently studying for licensing and pricing out equipment to pull the trigger on) - I have a (probably stupid question).  I've read up on AMPRnet a little bit and am wondering if there is any structure put together where instead of just back/forth text conversations like you are describing here, is there anything equivalent to somethin more permanent where users can post something (like a message board type thing) where the text stays permanent and people can respond to a general question over this type of network and you can 'check back' for responses at a later time?  The way I understand it (which is miniscule at the moment) it could be possible as long as few people stay comnected or you have a dedicated machine running somewhere?   Or am I way off?  Thanks again for the thread!"
battlestations,3cc4xi,MyrddinWyllt,2,Tue Jul 7 17:14:00 2015 UTC,"This is possible with ham radio, but not utilized very often any more.  How old are you?  Do you remember BBS's before the internet was around?   There were a great deal of BBS's in ham radio before the internet was prolific.  Many of the concepts that developed the TCP/IP packet were developed first in ham radio BBS's.  The concept of a message header and checksum originated with hand written messages that were passed across the country.  ARRL radiogram - instructions  You can run a BBS connected to a ham radio, where you can accomplish exactly what you described.  The most common today is Winlink, which allows you to send / receive emails from all over the world, if the winlink station is connected to the internet.  A BBS can be connected to a packet station for VHF/UHF or it can be connected to an HF rig to be available to users around the world.  There are still some active BBS's around.  Those that are not part of Winlink are operated for nostalgia, or for fun."

battlestations,3cc4xi,Pr0ject_Mayhem,10,Tue Jul 7 01:31:38 2015 UTC,"Still lots of voice only ham stuff going on out there.   Very common and very popular.  You can do that AND digital.  Its not an either/or thing.  I'm a technologist by training and love computers and such, so digital resonates with me personally - your mileage may vary.  Lots of people are doing a lot of very different things in Ham - you have to choose what you want to do.  I started with voice - and with a 100 watt setup and a very inefficient antenna, I was only getting out a couple of hundred miles.  voice has a fairly broad signal - about 2.7KHz of bandwidth, so your 100 watts is spread across that bandwidth and then bounced off the ionosphere many times.  Digital has a much much narrower bandwidth.  A PSK31 signal has a bandwidth of about 30Hz - so all of the energy is concentrated into a very narrow channel and this is much more efficient.  At 100 watts voice I was getting out a few hundred miles.  My very first PSK31 digital contact - with the same inefficient antenna and using only 25 watts - was with a guy from the Ukraine - 5000 miles away.  For me - using lower power and being able to get to far away places was a great thing.  Also - talking with folks from far away can be tough to understand accents and dialects through the broadcast distortion.  Text eliminates that.  I remember the first voice contact I had and I must have drove the poor guy crazy asking him to repeat his callsign so I could get get it right.  In digital, I just read it - in fact I do more that read it - I see if come up on my screen, and I click on it, and my system looks up the call and I know all about the person I am talking to!  His name, his country, how far away he is, often I can find his web page and see his Ham shack while talking to him.  It just works for me.  But hey - that's not to knock voice only, or morse code only, on whatever you like to do - its all there for you to play with...."

I'm a technologist myself, I do large scale hospital radiology software engineering, so digital has a little appeal to me.  I'm an old CB junkie from the 80's and 90's, so perhaps voice appeals to me more for that reason.  dunno."

Which means the people still doing voice are drying up... no fresh blood so to speak.   I'm a younger ham and can tell you from experience that there is a whole lot of voice activity. On HF you will find both digital & voice, and on VHF/UHF voice is much more common. On the repeaters here in Oregon we have new hams getting on the air (using voice modes) all the time.  The hobby is large enough to satisfy peoples desire to explore digital while still having a foothold in voice. I get on digital modes sometimes, but I also love to chat with people over FM.  Consider getting licensed! :)"
battlestations,3cc4xi,simohayha,2,Tue Jul 7 16:43:22 2015 UTC,"Digital is 'easier'.  With a little bit of power and a compromise antenna, you can make contacts around the world.  Voice is harder to copy and to be copied, but when it opens up it's golden.  My first night on the air, I worked a station in western russia from my place in Oregon on 100W with an antenna strung up about 6 feet off the ground, and we could hear each other clear as day.  Some nights, I can't hear anyone for shit.  Depends on propagation, your rig, a number of different things."
battlestations,3cc4xi,OH3EPZ,2,Tue Jul 7 16:53:36 2015 UTC,"I like digital, because my radio room is next door to my son's bedroom, and there isn't any insulation in the interior walls.  I don't want to keep him awake at night, so I prefer modes that don't require me to talk.  Also, digital modes are usually more spectrum-efficient, albeit also usually slower than voice.  For example, a typical voice conversation (on SSB) will take up 2500 Hz or so.  A PSK31 digital transmission will take up around 50 Hz.  Means there's room for more simultaneous conversations in a given swathe of radio spectrum.  Also, because the bandwidth is so small, the power applied to the transmission is far more effective, especially in poor atmospheric conditions.  100w spread out across a voice transmission is not much power anywhere.  25w in 50 Hz is a lot of concentrated signal strength.  For me the appeal is that I just think it's really neat to be able to talk to other people in a truly wireless fashion.  When you call someone on the phone there is a physical connection between you and them - copper cable going under the ocean, and so on.  When you email someone, that information is travelling by a physical connection, fiberoptics and whatnot.  That I can communicate across the world with a 30' length of copper wire, and enough electricity to power a dim lightbulb, by bouncing a radio wave off the atmosphere, is just really neat to me."
battlestations,3cc4xi,sniff3000,2,Tue Jul 7 19:18:58 2015 UTC,but everyone moving to digital like they have   They haven't. Digital is a quite niche part of it. The majority by far is still voice/CW. I got first in world in class in the 2011 CQ-WW-RTTY contest but I've not done much data since then. Maybe 20% of my log is data modes.

battlestations,3cc4xi,phreenet,6,Tue Jul 7 15:06:11 2015 UTC,"This is a really, really extensive station. So it's not typical.  TL;DR - Hams (not an acronym, no caps) communicate.  Long version: We're licensed to operate on a wide variety of frequency ranges, known as bands, everything from around 1.5MHz up to light. Some people do contesting, where they try and contact as many stations as possible in a set period. Others ""work DX,"" where they try and make contact with stations outside of the country that they are in. Stations with more power and better antennas can do moonbounce, and skip signals off of the moon. Those of us with less money/space can use satellites in orbit to repeat signals. Some hams are big into emergency communications, and provide comms for things like Nepal, Katrina, and less dire stuff like races. Others just like to chat.  We can use voice (single sideband, FM, AM, and others), CW (continuous wave, or morse code), and any number of digital modes to make these contacts.   This guy's station is centered around an Elecraft K3 - the black box with yellow screen in the center. To it's right is a panadapter, basically a box that shows the activity on nearby frequencies. The smaller black radio with a yellow screen is an elecraft KX3, a portable version of the K3 that you can take into the field - common with guys who like to operate from mountain tops. It has it's own panadapter next to it.   The grey triangle things on the right are antenna switches, either feeding one antenna to multiple radios or one radio to multiple antennas, depending on setup. Below those is some variety of VHF FM radio, used for local communications.   Umm....There's some power supplies in there, the red and gold thing on the desk is a Begali morse paddle, there's a wattmeter in there, the box with the heatsinks to the left of the monitors is an Elecraft KXPA100, which amplifies the KX3's 10W output to 100W.  On the monitors...let's see. Top left looks like a logging application, for recording contacts. Bottom left is software for using the digital modes he's working in. Bottom right is connected the P3, the panadapter on the K3, so he can see the signals bigger, top right is something called PSK Reporter, that shows active digital stations and is a good indication of how well our signals are propagating through the ionosphere. Top center is another propagation report, I think.  I hope you're an advanced 5 year old."

battlestations,3cdr5b,SirHappyPanda,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:01:14 2015 UTC,"Currently I have a two PC Setup for doing a live broadcast. PC1 to run my music, Teamspeak, and games and then PC2 which will encode all of this then broadcast it to twitch.   So what I need is a mixer that will take my mic input, then I need a Stereo input for Teamspeak, then at least one more Stereo input for Game audio and Music audio (if I can get a third stereo input so I can have these separated that would be even better). These inputs will all run to PC2. Then from my understanding I will need a FX out option that will allow me to send my Mic back to PC1 for Teamspeak/skype while still sending in the main mix to PC2.   I Don't know if there will be separate gear needed/recommended to add to this or if this would help with a recommendation."

battlestations,3caxe1,bentika,34,Mon Jul 6 14:09:18 2015 UTC,"I would definitely reverse your fan setup. You want cool air coming in from the front and out of the back. The way you have it now, you're pulling in cool air, but pushing it over a hot radiator and circulating that over your mobo, before going out the front.   Otherwise, very nice write-up. I've always loved that old Mac pro case, and this kinda makes me want to do it myself."
battlestations,3caxe1,sleepymkiii,20,Mon Jul 6 14:54:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, also because you generally want positive air pressure inside your case. In other words more air coming in than out. This helps stops any dust that enters the system from settling and building up.  Nice build though, this makes me want to do something similar with the G5 I have laying about. Maybe build a hackintosh out it...."

If you're building a rig for home/small office use i'd say yeah, but professionally speaking time is worth more than the cost of penny pinching on a DIY build. You've got a bunch of separates, all with their own warranties, coming in from different vendors. If it fails, you're going to have to spend the time getting it back in working order rather than simply shipping it back to the supplier and receiving a new one. Day rates of your operator, IT dept etc.. you're going to burn through your $500 savings in half a man-day it took to put it together.  But yeah, totally. The MP's a couple years old now and they don't refresh the internals all that often so it will render less bang for buck as time goes on. Still it's a nice machine and an incredible piece of engineering IMO. And, whilst i'm a fan of Fractal (running a node 304 for my htpc), that R5 doesn't really compare to the architecture of the MP.

battlestations,3caxe1,rui278,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:44:17 2015 UTC,"I was thinking of the single person or very small business use case, you are right that having a single manufacturer outweighs the savings in a larger business environment. I think that in very large environments however the workstation yields to the server cluster for computational usefulness, eg a rendering server/cluster/farm for use by multiple animation artists. I only chose the R5 because it also has the professional look, the Mac Pro case does have an aesthetic advantage."

battlestations,3cb0t5,Wozzle90,3,Mon Jul 6 20:06:23 2015 UTC,I like It. If you want a smaller keyboard I would reccomend it. You get use to the arrow keys but it can get annoying. All you have to do is press a button to switch between the number pad and arrow keys.

battlestations,3cbq1g,Sinner15,2,Mon Jul 6 21:41:25 2015 UTC,"Well congratulations on the new addition! Hope your new setup works out well. Like another commenter said, you might want to consider how you route things through the walls, if at all. Generally it seems the lower-powered cables like HDMI and USB are fine, but 120v power cables are an electrical code issue. A lot of electricians would probably recommend you use a shielding metal sleeve for all your cables, called BX, or to run conduit behind the drywall, and to not run cables through studs, especially if they're metal.  Of course, an easier option would be to get a simple paintable cable management system; you can some good ones from eBay. They don't look too bad, and they have the added bonus of not helping your house burn. Then if you have a desk with a back panel, you can hide all the cables behind it and keep them off the ground by using hooks or nails with zip ties. My desk has a sort of cheese plate panel that's great for zip ties, which has worked out nicely"

battlestations,3cbq1g,ItsNotCharlie,2,Tue Jul 7 23:36:30 2015 UTC,Hey nice setup! I was considering getting a MacBook and I have a couple questions for someone like you.   I have a gaming PC but same as you (assuming that's what it's for) and was wondering how you like the OS on your Mac. I was primarily going to use it for school and messing around with so that I don't always have to sit at my desk. Also did you get it from Apple or is there a cheaper place they can be purchased? As much as I would like one I'm not sure I could justify the cost but the build quality is amazing. Thanks!
battlestations,3cbq1g,ItsNotCharlie,2,Mon Jul 6 23:07:01 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks! I originally wanted the mac because I was interested in trying out a new OS, and had been pretty unhappy with the quality of the high-end PC laptops. There is a bit of a learning curve between the two, but I've found a lot of things I like about OS X (Yosemite is what I'm running), and I also haven't lost my enjoyment of Windows 8.1. Both systems have their pros and cons (I like the multitasking and file browsing of Windows a lot more, but the interface and support on the Mac are also great). I used to use my desktop for a lot of gaming (had three screens--woohoo!) but have shifted over more to video editing and graphic design, with some gaming, of course. The PC definitely does games better, but it's not all bad on the Mac; Steam has in-home streaming which is pretty fun for the couch, and of course Blizzard games all work on Mac, and fairly well, too. (Mine is the mid-2014 Retina model with 2.6GHz CPU and 8gb RAM, with iris graphics). I mostly use Adobe applications for productivity, and I haven't found any discernible difference between the two systems at all. The Macbook handles everything very well, and the trackpad is by far the best thing you'll ever use. Half the time, I forget that I'm not using a mouse while I'm in Photoshop. I also use Microsoft Office, which used to kind of be bland and featureless on OSX, but the Office 2016 beta is out and it's fantastic. I use my MacBook in college and the battery life nets me about 9-12 hours for normal use. My classmates had the new Dell XPS laptops and have had nothing but trouble with them in the same capacity. When I bought my Pro, I basically stopped using my desktop for a few weeks. The screen looks brilliant (and is pretty close to calibrated quality) and I basically got into Reddit lurking because I kept wanting to read the internet and browse dank memes on it. In fact, it's the reason I upgraded to high-res IPS monitors for my desktop. I couldn't stand normal screens any more. Things just look better on it. And as a sorta-freelance designer, it's really helped to have accurate colours. It's a whole new world.   As for price, there really is not any place to get it cheaper. Apple is pretty tight on that. You might find a discount someplace for about $100 off, which would basically be buying it at cost. If you're a student, Apple does student discounts. I saved $100 on mine because of that, and during a back to school promotion I also got a $100 Apple Store gift card I used toward an external hard drive and a 4-year Office subscription. But even at full price, the MacBook is definitely fair. A similarly-specced laptop with good battery life and build quality (in the same small size of the Pro) will generally cost the same (check out the Dell XPS laptops I mentioned) but Apple tends to have much better service, and if you have an Apple Store in your area, you definitely won't regret buying into that. I'd say go for it. But if you want to game, make sure you get more than a 128gb Solid State drive. Also if you get a mouse, make sure it's not the Magic mouse. I bought it and then drove an hour and a half to return it, it was so bad. Bought a Razer Orochi bluetooth mouse instead. 100% recommend it to everyone."
battlestations,3cbq1g,telelax,2,Mon Jul 6 23:38:51 2015 UTC,Wow thanks for the reply. You've definitely made my decision a little bit easier so I guess I'll start saving!
battlestations,3cbq1g,OmeletteDuLeFromage,2,Tue Jul 7 00:17:14 2015 UTC,"if you're going to spend mac money on a laptop, look into the Razer Blade. Yeah yeah it's made by razer but its build quality is insane and it has massively better internals. Battery life is decent at about 5 hours for simple stuff though I only got 3 today working in Maya. They also have a student discount. 5% off if my memory serves."

battlestations,3cbq1g,orairwolf,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:49:39 2015 UTC,"I'm using an Asus Xonar STX sound card. It has a header for the front-of-case headphone jack, which I use for the Shure SRH-440 headhones. It also has rear RCA and 1/4"" outputs which I use for the A2+ speakers and the tube amp respectively. The card comes with software that does really quick switching between outputs. It's pretty fast but not perfectly ideal. The software supports equalizer profiles, and I have one for each set. To use my Razer headset, I switch to the motherboard's onboard sound input and output. This isn't always necessary, as I have Skype set to always use that, even when the sound card is enabled. The Turtle Beach headset on the other side is used for my PS3. The turntable is attached to the input on the sound card, and I have Listening enabled, so when I turn it on, music comes through whichever speaker set is currently enabled. I wish Windows had a better way of managing sound outputs, but I don't switch back and forth very often, so it works pretty seamlessly for what it is."
battlestations,3cbq1g,orairwolf,2,Mon Jul 6 23:57:47 2015 UTC,"Does your turntable boost the analog outputs so your card can use it or is your card capable of accepting a phono input?

battlestations,3c8kmi,dearfenrir,98,Sun Jul 5 22:26:04 2015 UTC,"Quick, someone post the SR-71 story."
battlestations,3c8kmi,Flyboy2057,107,Sun Jul 5 23:42:23 2015 UTC,"It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet.  I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.  Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.  We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied: ""November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground.""  Now the thing to understand about Center controllers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna, or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the "" Houston Center voice."" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.  Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed. ""I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed."" Boy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. ""Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check"". Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: ""Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground.""  And I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.  Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then, I heard it. The click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: ""Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?"" There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. ""Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground.""  I think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: ""Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.""  For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A.came back with, ""Roger that Aspen, Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.""  It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast.  For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there."
battlestations,3c8kmi,RobotChinchilla,14,Mon Jul 6 00:27:53 2015 UTC,The other ones better. With the flyby circling
battlestations,3c8kmi,whereisthetrashcan,40,Mon Jul 6 01:35:26 2015 UTC,"As a former SR-71 pilot, and a professional keynote speaker, the question I'm most often asked is ""How fast would that SR-71 fly?"" I can be assured of hearing that question several times at any event I attend. It's an interesting question, given the aircraft's proclivity for speed, but there really isn't one number to give, as the jet would always give you a little more speed if you wanted it to. It was common to see 35 miles a minute. Because we flew a programmed Mach number on most missions, and never wanted to harm the plane in any way, we never let it run out to any limits of temperature or speed. Thus, each SR-71 pilot had his own individual ""high"" speed that he saw at some point on some mission. I saw mine over Libya when Khadafy fired two missiles my way, and max power was in order. Let's just say that the plane truly loved speed and effortlessly took us to Mach numbers we hadn't previously seen.  So it was with great surprise, when at the end of one of my presentations, someone asked, ""What was the slowest you ever flew in the Blackbird?"" This was a first. After giving it some thought, I was reminded of a story that I had never shared before, and relayed the following.  I was flying the SR-71 out of RAF Mildenhall, England, with my back-seater, Walt Watson; we were returning from a mission over Europe and the Iron Curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base. As we scooted across Denmark in three minutes, we learned that a small RAF base in the English countryside had requested an SR-71 flypast. The air cadet commander there was a former Blackbird pilot, and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty SR-71 perform a low approach. No problem, we were happy to do it. After a quick aerial refueling over the North Sea, we proceeded to find the small airfield.  Walter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat, and began to vector me toward the field. Descending to subsonic speeds, we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze. Like most former WWII British airfields, the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure. Walter told me we were close and that I should be able to see the field, but I saw nothing. Nothing but trees as far as I could see in the haze. We got a little lower, and I pulled the throttles back from the 325 knots we were at. With the gear up, anything under 275 was just uncomfortable. Walt said we were practically over the field—yet, there was nothing in my windscreen. I banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field.  Meanwhile, below, the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the flypast. It was a quiet, still day with no wind and partial gray overcast. Walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us, but in the overcast and haze, I couldn't see it. The longer we continued to peer out the window and circle, the slower we got. With our power back, the awaiting cadets heard nothing. I must have had good instructors in my flying career, as something told me I better cross-check the gauges. As I noticed the airspeed indicator slide below 160 knots, my heart stopped and my adrenalin-filled left hand pushed two throttles full forward. At this point, we weren't really flying, but were falling in a slight bank. Just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame (and what a joyous feeling that was), the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower. Shattering the still quiet of that morning, they now had 107 feet of fire-breathing titanium in their face as the plane leveled and accelerated, in full burner, on the tower side of the infield, closer than expected, maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knife-edge pass.   Quickly reaching the field boundary, we proceeded back to Mildenhall without incident. We didn't say a word for those next 14 minutes. After landing, our commander greeted us, and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings. Instead, he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest SR-71 flypast he had ever seen, especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking. He said that some of the cadet's hats were blown off and the sight of the planform of the plane in full afterburner dropping right in front of them was unbelievable. Walt and I both understood the concept of ""breathtaking"" very well that morning, and sheepishly replied that they were just excited to see our low approach.  As we retired to the equipment room to change from space suits to flight suits, we just sat there—we hadn't spoken a word since ""the pass."" Finally, Walter looked at me and said, ""One hundred fifty-six knots. What did you see?"" Trying to find my voice, I stammered, ""One hundred fifty-two."" We sat in silence for a moment. Then Walt said, ""Don't ever do that to me again!"" And I never did.  A year later, Walter and I were having lunch in the Mildenhall Officer's Club, and overheard an officer talking to some cadets about an SR-71 flypast that he had seen one day. Of course, by now the story included kids falling off the tower and screaming as the heat of the jet singed their eyebrows. Noticing our HABU patches, as we stood there with lunch trays in our hands, he asked us to verify to the cadets that such a thing had occurred. Walt just shook his head and said, ""It was probably just a routine low approach; they're pretty impressive in that plane."" Impressive indeed.  Little did I realize after relaying this experience to my audience that day that it would become one of the most popular and most requested stories. It's ironic that people are interested in how slow the world's fastest jet can fly. Regardless of your speed, however, it's always a good idea to keep that cross-check up...and keep your Mach up, too."

battlestations,3c8kmi,budgiebum,38,Mon Jul 6 02:22:13 2015 UTC,"I'm no mic expert but to me that looks like a Snowball. A great mic but far from the best. Anyways, people own good mics like these because its so much better to hear ""hey so-and-so, your mic sounds great!"" over Teamspeak or Skype rather than people telling you to mute yourself because you bought a $10 mic off of Amazon. Even in regular in-game voice, you always have that guy using an absolutely abysmal mic that sounds lile he's simultaneously running a turbine engine and a gas generator on his desk every time he pushes his push to talk button. Nobody likes that guy."
battlestations,3c8kmi,christhemushroom,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:28:36 2015 UTC,"I don't get why everyone gets condenser mics. Most people I know who use them live in flats/apartments or terraced houses, so I can hear every door closing, every dog barking, every child playing in the street through the open window, every police siren etc.  And this is all while they are talking.   I've found a solid gaming headset to work really well - one feature I use frequently is playing music out of speakers and listening to in-game/teamspeak over the headset; the mic doesn't pick it up the music at all.  Most of the problems people have with mics usually comes down to Windows Sound levels being set on 100 (like +50dB of gain) I have found."
battlestations,3c8kmi,RyanSamuel,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:11:11 2015 UTC,"It can largely feel dependant on what the other people you're talking with are using. In a Teamspeak server with 5+ people, one person with a shitty headset mic is particularly noticeable. That's not to say you can't get good headset mics but it's rare to find one the even gets close to a ~$50 condenser."
battlestations,3c8kmi,zosis,3,Mon Jul 6 13:26:34 2015 UTC,"It isn't what I use (Steelseries Siberia V2, see below) but the Plantronics GameCom 788 is $60, which is a good price if you factor in the quality of the headphones as well (apparently not the build quality though, so someone might be better off with the Steelseries Siberia V2 for $50 - I bought mine used over a year ago, and I use it on the go as media headphones (they're bright green so people don't talk to me).   I'd highly recommend condensers to youtubers/streamers, voice actors or people that want everyone to hear their farts with crystal clarity in TF2 arena graveyard, but otherwise it just seems unnecessary.   Take the one in this picture for example; let's assume OP isn't a youtuber or a streamer or anything, and just uses it for comms. If we take a wander down hypothetical street and they've got the window open, those blinds are going to be to be flapping and fluttering unless they're opened all the way, which would allow the sun to obstruct OPs vision, so it's unlikely they'll close them all the way. They've got a mechanical keyboard which is likely to be picked up, and based on what I can see (corner of the room on the right, bed joints on the left) OPs bedroom is likely ~4.5x6m (could be student) and the door is either behind him (which would be picked up by the mic) or near the bed. Because there is a window near but opposite the mic, it is likely to pick up the outside noises that I previously mentioned but that means there is a hallway through the door, which could entrance to noisy housemates, students, pets, parents, siblings, robbers, fire alarms, acts of god and other loud nuances OP doesn't want to be picking up on they're mic. Not to mention OP has an SR-71 as they're wallpaper, so might like to listen to the sound of the engine on repeat through the speakers I can't seem to see on the desk - they must have the actual engine in the 4.5x6m room. Also based on the flatness of the arms of OPs chair he has this chair which is known to develop a squeak after 4 months or so of excessive sitting.  Based on the information I have gathered by not knowing OP at all and thinking there's nothing I don't know about OP at all, I have concluded that they and all of humanity should buy a headset so that headsets get upgraded to be as good as condensers, because that's the way economy and microphones work, apparently."

battlestations,3c8kmi,KiiWeee,23,Mon Jul 6 08:34:28 2015 UTC,Do HD598 even benefit from amp? They're only 50 Ohms.   I ask because I read a rant on /r/headphones few weeks ago how amps are useless for these headphones.
battlestations,3c8kmi,JackCarver,20,Sun Jul 5 22:54:24 2015 UTC,"598s are just as much in need of an amp to be driven properly as any other high end Sennheiser. The nominal ohm rating is ~50ohms, but in the bass frequencies, the ohm rating spikes up almost six times as high. They take a lot of juice to have controlled bass, and this is a trend you see in Sennheiser headphones.

battlestations,3c8kmi,Ofenlicht,3,Mon Jul 6 01:02:49 2015 UTC,It hugely benefits the midbass. The 598's have a huge impedance spike at 100 hz to ~250 ohm and an amp helps bring up its otherwise pretty anemic bass.

I haven't tried all of them but essentially they are broken down into 2 main categories: tactile and non-tactile. Tactile ones have an audible and tactile click when the key is actuated while the non-tactile (linear) ones are just one smooth press all the way down. Red and Black are the linear ones afaik with red having a very low actuation pressure and black having a higher one. Blue, green, brown are all tactile with different actuation pressures and ""clickyness""."

The thing is phone camera sensors are very small, and when you combine small sensors with high ISO you get a lot of heat that translates to lots of noise in the final image.   A camera and a wide angle lens and you're good to go. If you don't have these just turn the lights on. We won't see all the cool lights but at least the photo is going to have more detail."

I own one as well, and I must say it's one of the best microphones i've used. Extremely clear sound recording quality, different settings for different purposes (capturing the whole room / what's in front of it etc) and the overall design and functionality as well as how small it is makes it an absolute blast to have.  Though I must say it's hard to place the microphone anywhere (if you have it for a desktop setup and you have monitors with thin bezels) , you can't smack it onto your monitor so it'll have to be on the desk where having a mechanical keyboard is going to be a pain if you plan on using it to skype or voice chat.  As for how clear it is, extremely clear. My friends actually hear a bit too much sometimes (airplane going by, cars or motorcycles passing by ice cream sellers [with the little bells] going by etc) mind you, i'm in the basement."

Having every item in that menu expanded rather than having organized, collapsed folders means more scrolling and reading around trying to find what I wanted. And that bullshit horizontal scrolling, too.  Settings and options fragmented between the Metro interface and regular desktop. Networking didn't seem as intuitive to me.  Really, the whole Metro interface. I never used it, and every time I was forced to use it, it slowed me down.  I use Windows Media Center to watch TV with a CableCARD box, and Media Center is now a paid addition instead of an included feature. Media Center in 8 is literally an exact copy of the version in 7, they could have at least updated it and justified the cost.  I use OneDrive, but I didn't like how OneDrive was dug into the OS. I much prefer the standalone application in 7.   Literally the only thing I liked more about Windows 8.1 over 7 was the faster bootup time. That was it."

Here's another album of just the monitor stand. http://imgur.com/a/tWOEL#0  I will try and print out a parts list of all that I used to build this. The gist of it is this, I used all 80/20 black anodized strut instead of the typical plain aluminum strut.   Horizontal ""wing"" supports (sits on table) are 3"" square tube (2 EA 80/20 part # 3030 x 12"" length) Center horizontal member is 3"" square tube (1 EA 80/20 part # 3030 x 18"" length) Upright posts are same as wings, 3"" square 3030 tube, 12"" length (I'd suggest using 16"" or 18"" though to get a bit more height if needed) All of the horizontal supports for the monitors are 1.5"" x 3"" strut (80/20 part # 1530). The center support is 18"", and each of the side supports are 12"" All of the fixtures are the hard part, there are about 10 different part numbers for all of them (the hinges, the end caps, the braces etc.)   I'll try and PM you or post a PDF of the part numbers today or tomorrow.

I drilled holes in the backplate of the mount to fit the center-to-center distances of the grooves in the strut. Then all I had to do was slide in a few nuts for each mount and tighten then down. I used a flat plate behind each mount to get the spacing correct for the standard 80/20 bolts.   Here's the mount I used, it tilts in one direction and I can move the monitors in and out or left and right using adjustment in the stand itself.   http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AMAUV2?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00"

I'd recommend any of the 144hz panels from BenQ or Asus, though the 24'' variants run anywhere between $250-$400 dollars depending on which model you go for. BenQ has a 27'' 144hz 1080p for ~$400: http://www.amazon.com/BenQ-XL2720Z-27-inch-LED-lit-Monitor/dp/B00GWFNMJS/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1436065849&sr=8-2&keywords=BenQ+XL2730z  Though for 1080p, I think 24 inch is the sweet spot for the pixel density.  For 1440p, I've heard great things about the korean panels like the Qnix QX2710, Crossover 27QW, etc. The panels can also be overclocked in most cases to around 96 hz on average, which a 980 Ti could easily leverage. They run for about $300 on Ebay. However, this panels have about a 8 ms response time, but most people claim this is not an issue."

battlestations,3c2vfz,QwarkDreams,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:25:14 2015 UTC,Well yeah that's how you assemble the CPU cooler. Air is sucked in through the radiator and it cools the water that loops from it and the cpu block.

battlestations,3c2vfz,Semajalz,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:45:32 2015 UTC,"I know that. It's just unusual to mount it this way. Most people mount the fans so they push the warm air out of the case, not suck it in.  Your fans on the radiator are sucking air in, push it through the radiator and heat the air up, then release it into the case. This usually results in higher temps inside the case. In the worst case your fans might even fight each other, by blowing onto the radiator from each side.  If you can see the whole fan it's sucking air (like this -> http://cdn5.thinkcomputers.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/372-415x260.jpg ). If you can see the braces that hold the fan and its motor it is blowing air (like this -> http://img.hexus.net/v2/cooling/Enermax/Liqtech-120X/120X-08b.jpg )."
battlestations,3c2vfz,SUPREME_DONG,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:09:31 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip! I just changed the directions of the fans and the case is way cooler now. I haven't had the H80i on for a while because of stripped screw holes in the radiator so I guess I forgot which direction to mount the fans.
battlestations,3c2vfz,coolguyflex,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:46:10 2015 UTC,"No problem, glad it improved your temps ;)  Fans usually have the direction they are spinning and moving the air printed on the side of the frame, like this -> http://ppbm6.com/Fan-air.png  Sometimes those arrows are a bit difficult to find because they aren't really that outstanding, but in general: if you can see the whole fan and the center -> the fan sucks air. if you the fan-motor bracket is in the way (with the little round label in the middle that has the volts, rpm, etc written on it) the fan blows the air towards you."

It's always the little things like how the angle of the monitor bases fits with the angle of the side pieces of wood.  But if I could offer some engineering advice: As it is,those monitor stands will only work for your current monitors, as other monitors will have different-shape bases. If you had designed them with adjustable VESA mounts, they would work with any brand or size of monitor in the future. Just something to think about for future projects/upgrades: It's usually best to make things as universal as possible."

I actually considered getting the white & black Corsair C70 for this build while in the planning phase. I wanted something white/black & mobile, the C70 lost out to the 380t when I went to go check out the cases in person at Canada Computers.  For anyone looking into an itx case I recommend going to your local PC parts store and actually getting a feel for the size and the limitations the itx cases have. YouTube review videos can only help so much."

battlestations,3byztg,LittzDJ,2,Sat Jul 4 09:19:10 2015 UTC,My suggestion would be to go to ikea. They have those table top tables and you would be able to sit directly in the middle of your set up and it would be a better experience with games and what not.

When you game with all 3 1080p monitors it is rendering close to 4k resolution so you have to have a pretty easy to run game or/and a really good graphics card. As for genre car games and flight sims benefit the most from it, really adds to the immersion.

Sometimes he would yell from waking during a nap, I watch for a few and he goes back down and sleeps another hour.  Plus now its kinda fun to watch him play with his toys and do silly things like try to do somersaults or dance to his crib soother. If I was to get another one I would also look for one that showed the temp of the room.  I always wonder when the temp drops at night if his ac is freezing him out.

I guess it's awesome for things like skyrim though, that barely has a UI.  In windows i only ever used 2.  So i guess it depends on the games you're playing ect.

I was getting an average of 75-85 fps. Which compared to normally getting 144fps, it feels a little slow. Guess I'll have to go SLI :) I'll test out Witcher tonight and see how it handles it.

The hardline tubing and layout in the case is impeccable. Also, you listed 12x 120 mm fans do you keep the pump and another rad in the basement with more fans? I would imagine the fans are kept at a pretty low rpm, but how's the noise?"
battlestations,3bvu4r,dorekk,3,Thu Jul 2 20:51:43 2015 UTC,"Schedule cleared! Who needs friends?!     I have built a few pcs, but only one other air cooled gaming pc and have never worked with water before this. I just watched tutorials and did a lot of research. It was a bit confusing and intimidating at first and I imagine it still would be if I was to do it again (talking about all of the parts and compatibility). Drawing it out (multiple times) helped, even though those plans changed several times when the parts started coming in. The pumps and tubing are sandwiched in between the two rads in the lower part of the case (the reason for the sheet metal that separates the two areas). This picture shows the mess going on down there. And I was going for as silent as possible so they are running at the lowest rpm possible, which is something around 20db. It's quiet enough :) I'm happy with it.      Thank you for the kind words. I'm very happy with the results."

battlestations,3bz5kq,Bakken0,7,Fri Jul 3 09:34:05 2015 UTC,"Only real suggestion I have is perhaps a way to tidy up your wires a bit. If possible, your case may have venting to allow you to flip your powersupply, fan pointed down.  This does two things, gives your PSU outside air instead of case air, and puts the wire bundle at the back of the case where it can be routed more easily.   Illustration  If the Auxillary power for the motherboard(small connector) cant route behind the motherboard tray and over the top, you can route it flat against the motherboard underneath the brackets of your graphics and wifi card. (marked with yellow dashes)  You should also be able to route the main motherboard power through the channels right of the motherboard tray. (marked in red)  Not sure exactly how your case is configured, but the area below your harddisk (marked in green) may be a nice place to coil up the bundle of unused power connections rather than leaving them in the bottom."

Your power supply will suck it downwards and the fans on top will suck it upwards. Better let the air flow to the back and up.

I know they're of high quality, but I just couldn't get over it. The mouse has a nice feel, and lovely button presses, but the ball keeps spinning after flicks and malfunctions at super low speeds. Mouse polling rate is 75hz too. I've used a more modern mouse, but I don't like how light and smooth it is. I like friction and weight. tl;dr, It's great fun and I prefer it over most modern gear.

Make a ton of half shitty projects that aren't really worth anything and you will learn a lot and not disappoint yourself. This sounds painful but start with dumb simple shit, follow a whole youtube series (I started with youtuber 'thenewboston' but that was a while ago, there might be something better now).  Check out codeacademy (maybe the python course). This is actually probably better than youtube tutorials right now, it's interactive and will guide you through pretty thoroughly - it's really high quality and loads of people recommend it.   I used to keep a word document of specific stuff i wanted to remember when programming. For example if I found out how to generate a random number, I would screenshot the code and put it in a word document in case I couldn't remember later - this was actually really helpful and made committing things to memory a lot less painful."

battlestations,3bvvz6,GNTGLDNRNGS,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:28:20 2015 UTC,"Hmm, C++ tends to be aimed at advanced projects so resources for learning it as a first language won't be as in depth or as useful as other languages.  I don't know that much about C++ but over time have heard it's not the best first language. Honestly just learn what you think feels best, and if you commit 20 hours to learning something but get stuck and frustrated then move to another language.   It wouldn't be wasted time, from language to language the skills are very transferable. After a few years languages won't matter so much and you can pick any of the popular ones in no time."

battlestations,3brb06,SirCircularCube,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:33:45 2015 UTC,I'm really looking forward to seeing the finished product. I'm thinking about getting this exact case and pairing it with the EK kit specifically made for this case: https://shop.ekwb.com/ek-kit-d360-x2-caselabs-mercury-s8-drop-in  You are planning on sticking a 360 radiator in the hard drive section. From what I've read that is very problematic since apparently the power / reset buttons get in the way. See this video https://youtu.be/tteAA4NR1zc?t=1301
battlestations,3brb06,scotty_pimmpen,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:25:26 2015 UTC,"Ah I've seen that EK Kit, It looks nice but I am using the XE Rad's which perform really well compared to other Rads I've seen. I also will be doing 2 loops. That kit seems good for a nice all in one setup!  I actually am going to mount the radiators in the bottom left and on the top, hence the 36mm extension panel on the top of my case ;)    The front will be nice and clean and will most likely have an Aquero 5/6 controller in one of the front bays ;)"

battlestations,3brb06,ericelawrence,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:32:06 2015 UTC,What's confusing you? I can guide you if you have some questions. I customized the shit out of this case from the base S8
battlestations,3brb06,Hanz_Mantis,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:47:33 2015 UTC,"So for the S3, I am confused about...  -Top Chasis Mount; what is this? I see radiator options. I really want to do an EKWB custom loop, so if this where I would put the radiator?  -Top Cover Options; What is this? Won't the radiator get in the way of any other drop cover options? Especially if I do a 'drop in' style radiator mount?  -Left/right door options; is the perspective like looking at the face of the case? So, stage-left and stage-right?  -5/16 nut driver option; is this just asking if you want them to include a screw driver with the case?  Thanks for the help!!"
battlestations,3brb06,kallexander,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:46:21 2015 UTC,"So for the Top Mount: Here are some closer pictures of my top mount option. Its hard to see I know but basically it provides a plate for you to affix the entire radiator with fans to and to create one unit. Good pics on the CaseLabs site as an example:  Top Mount Example Top Mount Example 2 Top Mount Example 3 I'd highly recommend it if you have the space or if your build allows it to go for the top mount The doors are like this Essentially like you say yes, the left door is the panel to the left of the front panel and same for the right The nut driver option is also as you say, some of the cases have that type of panel nut (I don't think I do) and they'll ship you one if it requires you to put the case together"
battlestations,3brb06,SimpleStatement,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:48:45 2015 UTC,"Ah! Alright thanks for the clarification and bonus pictures! I definitely want a drop-style radiator in there, I just don't know if I should do the 120mm or 140mm. I'm thinking 120mm. It seems like it'll be trial and error for me though...I'm not sure why, but I can't shake that feeling. I guess your response warrants another question, why wouldn't I have space for a top mount? I'm planning on mounting a 980, and the EKWB custom loop. Those are the only things I can think of that might obstruct space, but other than that do I have something to worry about?  edit: grammar"
battlestations,3brb06,SimpleStatement,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:17:49 2015 UTC,120mm Fans IMO flow really great these days. I think you can't go wrong. Trial and error? How so? There are a few sites that have tested CFM@RPM and lots of other stuff for many different fans. If you need some links I'd be happy to provide.   The Top mount thing is more a question of how thick a radiator + fans can you basically hang from the top of your chassis. A 45mm Rad + 2x15MM fans sandwiching the rad for push/pull will take up a lot of space very quickly in your average case (you can see the size of that mounting plate in the top mount example). It also might aesthetically bother you if you have to hang a significant portion of your cooling solution down into your chassis. With cases the the S8 I specified a 36mm extension so I'd be sure to have adequate space to mount a push/pull with a 60mm Rad ;)

The ultrawide is my first IPS panel, so the viewing angle and and colours look amazing. I had gotten used to my macbook's retina screen, but honestly the image quality here makes up for the lower resolution. The width is good for video and audio where you're using a timeline, because you spend less time scrolling left and right. It also supports two simultaneous inputs side by side, so I can have pc on one half, playstation on the other. I probably won't be doing that much though, now that I have this beefy GPU to play with :)."

battlestations,3bl6l4,MocoIMO,1 point,Tue Jun 30 06:09:10 2015 UTC,"Thank you :)  I enjoy the MX Master a lot. The upright position is really nice when I am not using my Wacom. I use the left button where your thumb rests to snap windows and the side wheel to swap between open programs. Also the scroll wheel unlocking is fantastic for getting through content quickly. It was a mouse I wasnt blown away with when I first got it, but now that I have gotten used to the functions it has, I feel it is an improvement.   The AV40s were something I had for a long time and kept flat on my desk. The benefit of the stands is the isolation from the surface, and directional formation of the sound. If I had them flat on the desk the speakers would be aimed more at my chest and shoulders and not my head. I think it made enough of a difference to warrant the purchase."

battlestations,3bibve,markrar,3,Mon Jun 29 16:29:02 2015 UTC,I think he is saying that every smudge or spot on the white surface would show up more and he would have to clean it. Then he would notice something else and clean that. Even if it really wasn't dirty.  He might also be a messy-desk type person and would constantly (many times not necessarily continuously) have to clean the desk because of all of the ensuing spots and smudges and what not that come from use.

battlestations,3bijln,changetip,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:05:44 2015 UTC,"Man either there's something odd going on in the conversions or books are really surprisingly expensive in... Denmark is it? USD$39 for a paperback HHGG omnibus? Even really overpriced physical bookstores wouldn't charge that much here.  That same Hitchiker's Guide on Amazon.de would be $15 euro, so about USD$16 (and it's about $10 on the US site). And probably $5 if you shopped around the 3rd party listings.  The price on the Narnia Hardcover seems right though, that's a nice edition of it."

battlestations,3bfrgd,Baycon,12,Mon Jun 29 05:19:47 2015 UTC,Browns. I love it. I bought a Microsoft Sidewinder after the glowing reviews everyone gave it and I hated it. The keys are way too flush and made typing fast impossible. I never use the 10 key so I knew I wanted one without but I usually play shooters or use a controller for everything else so I didn't need extra keys. They just got in the way and made it too easy to press accidentally. The mouse is new as well. I think I can honestly say that I am done with my build for a long while.

Follow the wake -> eat -> play -> sleep and you should be able to have a couple of hours of gaming a night.

Ditch the junky stock Corsair fans on the radiator, get some of their static pressure ones. Already had one of the stock grey ones die on my 750D.   Maybe buy The Anchor for your headphones. It's a cheap under the desk headphone stand, just to make things a bit neater.

battlestations,3bfv7h,levirules,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:38:33 2015 UTC,"pretty good looking first battlestation! since you asked for suggestions: 1) cable management. Not much you can do about mouse and keyboard besides drilling a hole through your desk. but you could improve the cables hanging off the back of the case. 2) Get a stand for your headphones. Either on the desktop, or something that you could hang underneath the desk. (btw i like the schiit stack). 3) put the monitors on some sort of mount. 4) straighten out your tower instead of angling it. Also putting it on the floor (but not on the carpet) would give you a lot of desk space and let more light in (although that might create glare on the monitor). 5) not really a fan of the clock. 6) your cable management inside the case is fairly well done, and since you don't have a windowed case, probably no point in improving that. An SSD will make your computer feel snappier."

They're $300+, and the support isn't even that great. Look into the Ikea Markus swivel chair. I own one, day9 uses one, they're the best, and under $200 for leather."
battlestations,3bdi0q,Corghee,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:35:47 2015 UTC,Yea I was looking at the $469 chair.  Will look into that chair you mentioned though. Thanks!

Back when I didn't have good chairs, I didn't have a backrest, so I leaned forward all the time. This made me be able to see everything up close but obviously wasn't healthy. So with this chair, I relearned and retrained my body to adjust to a slight recline instead. Now I'm just as good on competitive games without having to be inches away from the screen because of the natural distance gained from a slight recline. But the chair can recline to to 90 degrees backwards, so it can be really comfortable when you want to essentially lay down using only your chair when you're tired after a frustrating game of league or csgo."

Until then, just play with it. If it crashes and you can boot (which can happen with certain combinations of disabling/enabling power management utilities on the mobo), just reset the CMOS by either A: removing the battery, waiting 1-3 min, placing it back, or B: if that doesn't work, jump the CMOS by finding the two header pins (labeled, be sure to Google it, first) and running a single piece of metal (paperclip would work fine) to connect them for a moment WITH THE POWER OFF.   Needless to say, I take no responsibility, etc, blah, bullshit. :) And good luck!"

battlestations,3bas2p,decayo,3,Sun Jun 28 00:18:05 2015 UTC,"That is effective in preventing sound from getting in or out of the room, but it doesn't prevent reflection and echoing, which is what these diffusers do. If you yell in a square room with bare walls, you will hear all sorts of echo; the same happens with a sound system. The echo is the sound hitting the wall and bouncing back to you. The more odd angles and irregularities in the wall, the better the chance that the sound will bounce somewhere other than back into your ear. That is what these diffusers are doing, not preventing the sound from escaping the room (sound proofing)."
battlestations,3bas2p,stereophony,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:15:28 2015 UTC,"It's definitely not the most stylish option, but you get the most bang out of your buck with regular old moving blankets (the kinds that have a little weight to them).

If you think wearing an occulus rift or other head tracking options and having to move your head to look around your cockpit is worth it for the immersion (and many many people who play these games think it is worth it), then being surrounded by 3 large projection screens and looking around them to look around your cockpit is also worth it. And it would avoid a lot of the really annoying technical issues the current Occulus has too.  The point of these setups for flight sims is to have your entire field of view taken up by displays since you're supposed to be looking out a cockpit canopy in all directions. Three regular sized monitors help, but don't come anywhere near occupying your field of view even just horizontally.  It would be uncomfortable to play WoW or TF2 like this probably, but I don't think that's what it's made to play."

battlestations,3bas2p,alienangel2,3,Sat Jun 27 15:22:22 2015 UTC,Fixed base simulators actually have their screens 2-4m away from the cockpit and are at more obtuse angles. Not sure of the exact reasoning though!
battlestations,3bas2p,Weeksy79,6,Sat Jun 27 18:42:32 2015 UTC,"Mostly because they tend to have more screens, so can distribute them at more angles to cover above/below as well. When you have more screens to fill your field of view by actually surrounding you, no need to keep them close."

battlestations,3bas2p,twitchosx,2,Sat Jun 27 21:04:21 2015 UTC,"I was talking about the official ones, like this F/A-18F training simulator over at NAS Oceana (courtesy of http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/12/mach-2-hair-on-fire-ars-flies-the-navys-fa-18-sim-into-the-danger-zone).   I believe it's running 8 screens with a dedicated projector and PC for each one. They need distinct projectors for each since they render them from different viewpoints to account for the pilot's perspective on each. I admit I don't know how common that kind of setup is though. Maybe the military ones have more money to burn than commercial setups, especially if the canopy views in commercial aircraft are more limited? The rear and overhead screens would be pretty useless for an A320's enclosed cockpit (not the case for fighter plane/space ship cockpits)."

Referencing DBs are a lot easier as well, since it's all one language.  On top of that, if I wanted, I can code all core functionality in one project, then just have my android project reference that and skin it. It allows me to deploy to different machines with relative ease.  Even though I'm really not a big fan of Java."

battlestations,3b98qr,nicksnacs,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:01:13 2015 UTC,"The stands are super easy to pop off the back, you should do that and they should be able to take up very little space stacked and you could slide them in some sort of backpack and walk off. Make sure plenty of people have been in the storage room since last time someone had done inventory so the blame can't be traced to you. Of course there will be new rules afterwards that probably make you sign in prior to entering anymore but hey, free monitors."
battlestations,3b98qr,KrisndenS,1 point,Sat Jun 27 12:08:37 2015 UTC,Do you use the VESA mount by just popping off the stand? I was thinking of getting the U2414H but this has more of a reasonable price :p

I want the learning experience.   Second, is there anything special you need to run a 4K monitor/tv? You run one with a 960, but as soon as I plugged my PC into the 4K tv my parents have, I could barely use it due to the terrible response time. When I put the TV to 1080p, it was fine. I mean, I understand the 970 isn't a good card for 4K, but I was surprised by how badly my PC handled the 4K tv. Unless I'm dumb and did something wrong.  Nice setup. That sleeving looks amazing."
battlestations,3b6y5s,Crayola_ROX,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:10:23 2015 UTC,"First, Sleeving is not cheap. I spent around 200-300€ for the cables alone. But it is incredibly rewarding. If you are sure you want to go that route, go to /r/PCSleeving .  Make sure you use the right connector. When I plugged it in first and it was still DP 1.1 it felt horrible, but once I set it to DP1.2, which supports 4K, everything was fine. Even on onboard graphics it works. so make sure that the connections work and it is set to 60Hz at least, otherwise you feel like you will throw up. Maybe your TV is limited to 30Hz, which is not unusual, so the experience will always be a bit wierd.."

Unless you're running a machine with less than 4GB of RAM or constantly running low on RAM I wouldn't bother with this guide for Win 8.

When I was living in Virginia, my wife and I bought these really cheap office chairs that had shitty back support and it was painful using the computer for more than an hour or so. When I moved back to NYC, I used a kitchen chair that was even worse. I ended up buying two DXRacer chairs for my wife and I, mostly my wife because she has horrible posture and the DXRacer chairs have excellent back support that improves posture.

battlestations,3ay7d9,JoeBMX,10,Wed Jun 24 18:41:34 2015 UTC,Those logitechs sound great. They are 550w and THX certified. I have the old z5500 which are basically the same thing except 12 years old.
battlestations,3ay7d9,animalinapark,7,Wed Jun 24 18:57:11 2015 UTC,"It's subjective I suppose but I bet you good money you'd enjoy more a pair of these paired with a budget-ish amplifier with a good quality DAC. Sure, the cost would probably be greater but still if you are going to listen to a lot of music isn't it something you want to invest in, just like your computer?  There probably isn't anything that wrong in those logitech speakers but I just cannot recommend enough to get rid of the ""subwoofer"" and just listen to quality stereo speakers."
battlestations,3ay7d9,Idontlikecock,2,Wed Jun 24 19:04:50 2015 UTC,"You seem to be confused. The Z5500 was not some piece of junk $100 box set of surround sound. It was a $300 surround setup made for computer speakers.  Is it incredible? Not by any stretch of the imagination. It is probably my least favorite speaker I own (I own Kef Q300s, NHT Absolute Tower speakers, and most recently, the Sonus Faber Venere 2.5). Does it even begin to compete with any of these speakers? Not at all. What about other ""budget speakers"" I've owned? My favorite pair of budget speakers I've ever owned were the Fluance XL7S, absolutely great bookshelf speakers, and at $180, they packed quite a sound!  What else was there to consider though with that price?  In order to get a comparable sub to the Z5500, you would need to spend around $200, the Z5500 sub has an RMS of 180W, not peak, so it actually is much better than you are giving it credit for.  So we are are $380 so far for the sub and speakers as of now. What about a receiver to drive your speakers? You would probably be looking at $150 or so give or take a few dollars for a 2 channel receiver. But why are you getting a receiver when you can just get a normal amp? Because you the Z5500 has basically a ""receiver module"" with it which allows for the switching of multiple inputs across a multitude of devices.   Alright alright. So what is our grand total for the equivalent set up in 2.1 form? Roughly $520.  That is almost DOUBLE the cost of the Z5500.  And do you know what else? I would take the Z5500 all day over the 2.1 setup. Not only do the speakers share similar audio quality to where I would consider them equal, but the Z5500 has other great advantages such as light weight, small, and complete surround sound. The first point as for being light weight, you are looking for something on your desk, you want it to be able to be moved around with as little effort as possible. The next point, they are small. I have a giant 9 foot total L shape desk, and I could still use more room, small speakers, mean more desk space which matters a lot, especially for someone with little desk space in the first place. My last point about the surround sound. If you are using these at your desk, chances are, you also watch movies and play video games on your computer, in which case, surround sound is a very nice touch. If you are using them solely for music listening, a 2.1 is better than a 5.1 arguably, but you can run the Z5500 as a 2.1 system with a few turns of a knob, so that is no longer an issue.   TL;DR - You seem to be judging a product very harshly for which you have no experience with and you seem to have little experience with high end audio in general. There are much more things to consider when buying an audio system other than X will always sound better than Y because it didn't come all in one box. There are exceptions out there."
battlestations,3ay7d9,Devian50,2,Thu Jun 25 03:57:07 2015 UTC,"I agree with you wholly. Naturally a dedicated analogue setup will blow any digital competition out of the water if you do things right, but for what these speakers are designed for, they do a damn good job at the price they're at. A friend of mine dropped his dated analog setup for these and wishes he did so sooner. (tight for space, having foot and a half by foot wide woofers + mids + tweeters took up a lot of space, and the two amps he needed cooked him alive just about)  I have the little brother to that set, with the smaller woofer and no separate controller, and I love them. Logitech makes damn good digital speakers."

battlestations,3ay7d9,animalinapark,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:02:33 2015 UTC,"I'll admit that I don't have the best of(or even passable) knowledge from audio equipment, just a firsthand experience between those kind of supposedly good 2.1 and 5.1 Logitech as well as other brand speaker systems and a simple amplifier + 2 speaker system, with no additional subwoofer. The stereo system has always sounded vastly better.  I'm sure I could listen to that Z5500 no problem and it probably is better than those cheaper systems I've listened to. I'm no sound technician but at least all the systems that have had that separate subwoofer just has the bass playing way too high in the frequency range, ending up in a just overwhelming monotone bass instead of good, highlighting punch. Might be because the user has boosted bass to ridiculous levels and so forth instead of the fault of the system itself. Room acoustics and speaker positioning has an effect of course as well.  While a separate subwoofer is better to get into the really low range, do you think it is absolutely necessary in a budget build? Of course if you want minimal size desktop speakers you need to sacrifice from the cone size and frequency response. Still, I've listened to speakers not that much bigger from those in the z5500, with no subwoofer, that give certainly low and powerful enough bass for my desktop listening purposes.  So for the cost calculation I would imagine you can get a preowned amp and a pair of speakers for around $300 and they could give z5500 a serious contest, though not in surround sound nor the very lowest frequencies.  I would give an argument against the size of the z5500 system also. Sure, the speakers itself are lightweight and take little less area on the desk but the system itself is way more bulky and requires more cords and peripherals. An amp and 2 speakers is a simple as it can get.  As far as my original post goes, I didn't really know what kind of system it was. I just went straight from seeing that subwoofer and tweeters setup to recommending a stereo speaker setup with integrated bass. Which wasn't really a great argument for or against either, just what I have experienced and enjoyed. I'm glad it started the conversation at least."

I'm sure there's very sensitive 100W systems which would sound just as loud as these.   In saying that, i own a set of z5500's and they have served me just fine for basic music and gaming use on my PC. I have a considerably better (and of course, more expensive) setup in my lounge room which sounds leaps and bounds better than the Logitechs.

battlestations,3ay7d9,nilleftw,2,Wed Jun 24 20:01:48 2015 UTC,"The issue is likely SLI itself.  I am running 660ti and I'm getting between 50-70 fps with some of the nvidia effects turned on (rain, lod, physx boxes/papers).  I popped most things on high/medium (shadows was low).  I'm noticing a trend in the people reporting issues is that they're doing one of the following:   SLI Overclocking something Running AMD shitdrivers   I think I'm on 1080, but it might be 720.  Either way I've only noticed one stutter so far.  Largest issue might just be is people's expectations of PC gaming being amazingly better is more in line with PC vs PS3 than a PS4.  The PS4's hardware specs aren't amazing, but they're definitely able to push more than a PS3, so 720 with a locked 30 fps allows them to turn on more features that makes it look wow (and less rubber banding of the FPS definitely makes it look smoother).  You're i5 with SLIed cards and flaky PSU and some overclocking might not be able to keep up anymore."

battlestations,3b06b0,KeepingMyselfAlive,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:50:23 2015 UTC,"I have a H630 (which I think that's what OP's case is) and it definitely does not have good airflow. Air hardly gets pushed out the top even with 2x 200mm, 3x 120mm, or 2x 140mm. Intake is okay in the front and bottom (I have 4x 120mm for front and bottom combined).  The case is extremely quiet. All that foam and restricted air venting makes for a supremely quiet case, which is fantastic. However, when I had 2x 290X Vapor-Xs my temperatures were sky high (40 degrees Celsius over delta temperature) until I switched to 2 reference style GTX 980s.  Good sound isolation, great build quality, a useful fan hub in the back (although mine failed after a year), and a spacious interior offsets the extremely poor airflow the case has. If you don't mind higher temperatures and prefer quiet, I would go for this case. It looks swank too."

Unless you have a really bezel-less setup and/or need to monitor a fixed program/terminal constantly, I'd say that ultrawide is the way to go!   The added flexibility to arrange the space is really neat - I can fit 2 terminals + documentation/browser side-by-side easily, and each 1/3 has nearly the same size as an A4 sheet of paper.  The monitor itself is your regular IPS screen. It has that glow (a drawback of the technology iirc), but my panel is pretty uniform. If you're coming from a really high-quality panel you might notice the difference though..."

battlestations,3b0844,SenpaiPleaseNoticeMe,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:33:28 2015 UTC,What's that?
battlestations,3b0844,ch4ppi,2,Thu Jun 25 11:38:23 2015 UTC,"When you have a stereo setup you want the sound to go directly from the speakers to your ears, left speaker to the left ear and right speaker to the right ear. But since sound doesn't magically go in a straight line, some of it goes sideways or backwards and this gets reflected off the walls. The reflected sound waves can then cause interference with the ones coming directly at you from the speakers, degrading the sound quality and stereo imaging.  The foam on the walls absorbs the extra sound, preventing reflections and therefore you only hear the sound directly from the speakers.  TL;DR the foam absorbs unwanted sound.  This page goes over a lot more."

On my computer i have audioengine A5s. For my piano i have yamaha HS80Ms. For my projector I have some random klipsch set up. The foam is set up to absorb reflections from all these different speakers."
battlestations,3b0844,HaxRus,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:47:54 2015 UTC,Wow okay thanks for the reply.
battlestations,3b0844,ThaChoppah,2,Thu Jun 25 19:27:04 2015 UTC,"The theoretical perfect room would have no reflections at all, so I suppose if one were to randomly place foam on the walls it couldn't harm the sound since they'd only reduce reflections. Whether it helps it or not depends on if there are actually any reflections hitting the foam. If budget isn't a concern, the best way to treat a room would probably be to totally cover the walls.  OP's setup is actually pretty well thought-out and not random at all though. Since the room isn't perfectly rectangular or otherwise symmetric around the speakers it might look a bit off but he's got foam in all the right spots. For a minimal setup you want to eliminate ""first reflections"", since every time a sound wave is reflected it loses some of its energy so the second, third, etc reflections aren't as big of a concern as the first.   Since OP's listening spot is sitting down in front of the desk, he only needs to eliminate first reflections that would reflect back to that spot in particular rather than the entire room. This allows him to save a lot of money and wall space."

battlestations,3awrk8,PilotFriend,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:53:23 2015 UTC,I have my radiator pulliing in air and those two rear ones sucking it out. Only space for the radiator is in the front of thr case..
battlestations,3awrk8,MagnumMagnets,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:27:09 2015 UTC,"I was about to ask why you are using the radiator as in intake. I personally wouldn't blow that warm air into the case. If you could, put the fans on the other side of the radiator and blow air out while flipping the fan on the back to blow in. You should also get one or two more fans blowing into the case if you go with my suggestion to keep neutral or positive pressure in the case. I have the same cooler and regularly feel heat being pumped out through the radiator. It is good to keep that out of your case.  As a side note though, the way you have it has its advantages. This pulls cool air into the radiator instead of the warm air inside the case.  Edit: also, what card is that? If it has the same type of cooling system as the GTX970, you get a lot of extra hot air in the case. If it is like the Titan X, that blows all the air out. The GTX970 cooling system requires more airflow in the case because that is where the GPU dumps all the heat."

battlestations,3ax3tn,Feveredbike,7,Wed Jun 24 05:14:12 2015 UTC,"It looks good. If it were me though, I'd change a few things:  I use a keyboard very similar to yours at work, not exact model, but having said that you are missing out. Check out /r/mechanical keyboards. Do some switch research and see what color is right for you. Consider putting o-rings on the keys, aftermarket keycaps etc. It'll make a world of difference even more than looks.  Also, that case. If it works it works, but if you don't mind spending ~$100.. fractal design r5, NZXT h440, or for like $60 an s340. I bet it'd reduce sound while looking super nice too.   Only other thing I can say is possibly a monitor stand? Are you in a house, I mean can you drill into the wall? You can get a nice vesa wall mount for like $15. Looks way cleaner and can move wherever you want. Also doesn't shake anymore. Possibly even buy some nicer monitors depending on what model that is, I can't tell.  EDIT; OH, put some posters on the wall! can be had off amazon for super cheap <$5 each but the frames will get you. I think the cheapest I found was ~6 for $70 in a pack from Michaels?"
battlestations,3ax3tn,Zarknox,2,Wed Jun 24 05:18:53 2015 UTC,Thankyou for your response! I'll look around for the stands and keyboard!
battlestations,3ax3tn,Zarknox,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:32:09 2015 UTC,"do lots of reading on keyboards, I recommend zomething tenkeyless its just a really nice size if you dont really need the numpad. and I stay away from backlit as I think theyre ugly and that aise the price way up.  As foe stands just type vesa into amazon"
battlestations,3ax3tn,d3wy,2,Wed Jun 24 06:46:45 2015 UTC,+.5 on Tenkeyless. I did it and regret it. I love the keyboard I did get Leopold FC700R in charcoal however the more I do in excel/similiar (studying commerce at University) the more I miss the shit out of the number pad. BUT there is a plus side. You can buy standalone (mechanical too) 'number pads' which will allow me to have it to the left of my keyboard which I think I'd prefer allowing me to use it for macros/shortcuts in video games as well as allowing me to number + mouse at the same time :D
battlestations,3ax3tn,Zarknox,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:08:57 2015 UTC,"Ya, absolutely get a number pad if you do lots of number entry, but like you said standalones are a great option and allow for more customization to fit your needs than a full size keyboard!"

I would definitely consider a new case like the Define R4 since it looks so sleek. Get some ""Supernight"" LEDs off eBay and stick them to the back of your desk, they make a huge difference in a setup. Could also make a cheap monitor stand out of an IKEA Lack shelf and some Capita legs then stick you HDPVR under it. Other than that, looks pretty nice and clean!"

battlestations,3arsnh,badel321,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:06:41 2015 UTC,"You can find them everywhere lightly used around or under $450 USD which is a phenomenal price for an ergonomic chair built specifically for sitting on your ass all day.  You can not even compare a DXracer to any decent chair rated for 8+ hours of sitting. There is no adjustable lumbar support (there is a shitty lumbar ""cushion"") and a quick look at their official site shows no actual rating for the length of time one can comfortably sit.  DXracers are gimmicky chairs for classless kiddies who love too many LEDs inside their chassis. If you have $350 to spend on a mediocre chair you can save up or scrounge together an extra $100 to get something more appropriate for a desk.   If racing bucket seats were actually good for sitting in for extended periods of time they'd have caught on long before a couple years ago when the fad kicked in."

However, there are newer models of Momentums where you can fold them, so it's easier to bring around. These ones are a little tough to bring around, so if you end up going for Momentums, go for the newer ones (Momentum 2.0 I think).  These ones are over-ear ones, however it depends on how big your ear sizes are, it might end up as an on-ear (and that would be uncomfortable). Check and try them out first if it fits nicely."

battlestations,3asjtd,iciclevii,9,Tue Jun 23 04:55:10 2015 UTC,"I started out with a Corsair k95 because of the macros on the side, but quickly found the need for more than it had.     So I grabbed another keyboard I had lying around and ""remapped"" the keys to do different macros. The majority are simple shortcuts, but the ones on the left, ""red & white"" ones, allow me to arrange windows in certain spots on my Monitors.      Its a REAL time saver, especially with all the pixels its pushing. It was tedious moving things around to maximize space and usage, but those macros make it a breeze... kind of like the Aero Snap function in windows, but on steroids."

battlestations,3aqfox,ghosthardware_,3,Tue Jun 23 03:44:12 2015 UTC,The massive cpu cooler is blocking the slot. He should be fine.
battlestations,3aqfox,RoyalRs,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:01:37 2015 UTC,the slot he's using now is probably going to the PCH and at 8X rather than running a straight pci lane RIGHT to the CPU and @ 16X.   i would rotate the cooler and install the card in the proper slot
battlestations,3aqfox,TheAngelicOne,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:34:05 2015 UTC,Depends on the motherboard. Mine has two x16 slots.
battlestations,3aqfox,ierc,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:48:35 2015 UTC,"yes, but many boards don't have 2 by 16X slots. the second is only pinned as a 8X slot.  unless you have a board that has a PLX chip on it or have a X79 or X99 motherboard, it's more than likely a  8x on the second slot"

battlestations,3ar4vo,KumaLeBear,2,Tue Jun 23 08:57:46 2015 UTC,I've been using them for the past 3 months and so far they are great.  The keyboard feels nice to type on and the mouse is comfortable for long sessions. The only problem I had was that the scroll wheel started squeaking about 1 month after purchase but disassembling it and applying a lubricant fixed that and I haven't had a problem since.  For $30 it was completely worth it.

battlestations,3ano96,PurplePlatypus99,3,Mon Jun 22 09:19:12 2015 UTC,"This is the same comment I made in this thread a minute ago, but here.   I made just a small guide earlier this week on how to paint the H440 for those that want to:   Here is the teardown of the H440. The first few images are for the colored strip around the top and front. You essentially unscrew all of the screws to remove the metal mesh that covers the ventilation holes, and then you pull out the mesh. You then lift up all of the metal tabs and you can easily slide off the steel cover. For the power and reset switch its just one screw and you pull them off together.   The next part is for the shroud. When you take the PSU out you'll see two screws on the inside behind the shroud. Unscrew these two screws with a small screwdriver, since a big one is too long to fit. Then you will need to unplug the the power connector to the light, and when you do this you can pull the whole shroud out like is shown in the last picture. I forgot too take a picture of the back of the shroud where you'll see two holes next to the screw holes. Use a screw driver and push into both hols to pop off the colored part of the shroud and separate it from the clear plastic. If you do all of this you can just directly paint the plastic and wont have to tape anything besides the soundproofing material. I would suggest you spray paint the plugs since you can see them and them being colored when you look into the case would be unsightly.   For painting I used Rust-Oleum Painters-Touch Ultra Cover 2x. I would suggest 2-3 coats, since mine did peel a bit after banging the case a lot with my chair while my battle-station wasn't complete.   Here the final product (the  lights are more orange than in real life) I hope this helps!"
battlestations,3ano96,cantbecool,2,Mon Jun 22 12:47:23 2015 UTC,"I replied to a comment earlier with details but basically I pulled the plastic bits, sanded and primed before painting with spray cans very slowly and carefully. Patience is key :)"

I have a single 780 and it's fine for now, but playing heavily modded skyrim on 1440p I find that the VRAM runs out fairly quickly. I'm hesitant if I should trade out for a more powerful card with at minimum 4gb vram in the future, or get another 780, because the card itself is still extremely powerful."
battlestations,3ano96,kiwiandapple,2,Mon Jun 22 17:04:57 2015 UTC,"They're great. I was up against the same dilemma - glad I went with the 2nd 780 because it was cheaper than replacing the one I had with a more powerful card. I manage avg ~75fps in GTA @1440p with everything up except a couple of the advanced options. Of course, if VRAM is your issue a 4GB card might be a better choice.   I haven't played Skyrim for a while now but I remember having the same problem when it was modded heavily. I should reinstall (and re-mod it.. ugh that's a time consuming task..) and check it out now I've got the second card."

Edit: Noise is fine - the rear and CPU fans are really quiet (and both are PWM); the front fans are the stock H440 fans and they're pretty quiet. The graphics cards are the noisy part.

battlestations,3ap1k4,MagnumMagnets,2,Mon Jun 22 11:45:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks! :)  The Snowball is a great all round £50ish mic, probably the best for that price. The Yeti is a whole lot better for more professional situations, which shows from its price tag. It also looks incredibly fancy :P  But for basic Skype stuff the Snowball is more than enough. I've used it for voice chat, Twitch streaming and even ukulele recordings and it does the job really well. Depending on the toggles on the back, it can be geared towards detecting 'direct input' or listening to a whole room, which for this price is pretty great.  tl;dr For Skype the Snowball is great, you probably won't need a Yeti."

For FPS games like CS:GO, Dishonored etc I use KB+M, and for 3rd person stuff like Dark Souls, Witcher 3 I use a PS3 controller.  In terms of this mouse in particular, I love it. Some find it a little wide due to the ring finger button, but I like that. The numpad is nice, as I don't have one on the keyboard, and having the flexibility to use custom keybinds in games is always useful (in some more than others e.g MOBAs). The MOST USEFUL thing for me, however, is the scroll wheel tilt to go back and forth in browsers. I just can't shake the habit, and when I use mice that aren't mine, I instinctively try and tilt the scroll wheel to no avail :P"

battlestations,3ansek,Ashifkillz,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:51:08 2015 UTC,Been thinking about getting that case too. Was the installation fairly easy?
battlestations,3ansek,PizzaSaucez,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:12:53 2015 UTC,Installation was not hard but it could have been easier. Cable management was difficult due to the tight spaces but I was able to get to a point where only the fan cable and GPU power connectors where showing. PSU selection is restricted at 160 mm depth as any larger would be hard to add wiring after installation. CX750 met my needs but I'm looking for a better PSU to put in in the future.

Do you find yourself using the watch enough to justify having it, or is it a cool accessory that gets nominal usage?  Is it a pain to remember to charge it every night?  Would you say it's worth it to invest in one now, or wait for another revision from Motorola?"

Charging it is convenient, as you just set it on its stand at night. Also, it's pretty cheap right now at $149. I'd say go for it and give it a test run.

Decided the LG 29UM67 would fit the bill. It was 1"" taller and and 2"" narrower than my old monitors put together, and now I can use all of my screen space for a game. I was torn between the 29"" and 34"" but am happy I went with the 29. First of all getting the 34"" with the same 2560x1080 resolution would have meant less PPI. Second sitting 23"" from the screen I find that It fills my vision to the limit of what I find useful. I am thinking of maybe picking up another screen to put in portrait.   shot of the screen  whole desk  old setup  Specs: AMD Phenom II x4 965BE @ 4.1Ghz Water cooled, maybe someday Ill upgrade  AMD R9 280X With a full cover block  8Gb ram  SSDs and HDDs and other stuff like that  Keyboard is a CM Rapid-I  Mouse is a Razer Taipan"

I know Newegg has the 29"" for 341 shipped right now.  The clean desk look and the extra screen space for gaming is exactly why I wanted it it. I took no noticeable FPS hit from the extra resolution. My desktop is just for games and watching youtube while I waste time on the internet. Knowing I was gaining an inch in vertical space was nice for the internet part.  LG includes a screen splitting software that lets you chop up the screen space but I found it to be pretty much useless to me and just use snap in windows.   Freesync was also pretty appealing to me until I realized AMD was dumb and didnt include it in the 280 series.  Just FYI make sure you pick up a display port cable with you monitor. HDMI only supports 50HZ at full resolution. DP will let you run 75Hz"

Its only a marginal increase in pixels compared to going up a resolution like 1080p to 1440p. I run most of my games on max settings and the other games turned down a little to keep the 60FPS minimum. Going from 1920X1080 to the 2560X1080 I saw no noticeable drop in fps.  With the new monitor my GPU doesn't have to drive a whole other 1920X1080 monitor on the side while I game on the other so that may have helped too."

I have notice they do crack on highs sometimes. I was playing Dirt Rally earlier and the co drivers pace notes caused a bit of cracking.

battlestations,3agkuc,bevo00,10,Sat Jun 20 02:03:40 2015 UTC,"The curve is VERY noticeable. Much more so than curved TVs. This is probably because you are sitting much closer to your monitor than the TV. The sides being seemingly closer is very pleasing on the eyes. Watching anything gives you a much more immersive feel as well. The weirdest thing I have noticed is that after being on the computer for a bit, if I take a look at my phone or my iPad, the screen seems / feels a bit weird because it is not curved. It does not look the same.   Might also be worth mentioning, I had the non flat 34UM95 prior to this. Definitely worth switching for me."

battlestations,3agkuc,shellderp,2,Sat Jun 20 11:10:29 2015 UTC,The curve alone makes it worth it. The stand that comes with 34UC97 is a lot more attractive than the UM95. The back of UC97 is in gold finish similar to that of Apple gold color (vs Silver for UM95) and is very nice to look at.

battlestations,3af2d2,Widdrat,9,Fri Jun 19 20:04:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you're familiar with Haskell or not, but for the sake of explaining why someone would use Haskell I'll assume you are not (if you are, I apologize):   Immutable data types. Not being able to mutate state leads to code that is much easier to reason about and avoids hard to find bugs. This also goes with the stateless nature of the HTTP protocol. Pure functions. Functions cannot have side effects, and are equivalent to mathematical functions. They map a set of inputs to a set of outputs. This means that you will always get the same output given an input. This is a general good practice when coding. If your functions perform side effects it's going to be very difficult to debug down the road. Lazy evaluation. Allows you to work on infinite lists without running out of memory. For example: take 5 [1..] would print out [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] even though [1..] goes on forever. This is a huge performance win over languages that use eager evaluation (if used correctly). Auto currying. If I call a function with too few arguments I get back a partially applied function with the arguments I passed. For example say I have a function called add that adds 2 numbers. The following will give me a function that will always add 2 to a number let add2 = add 2. This is just useful in general and a super powerful feature.   This was a very high level, not even close to exhaustive list of why someone would use Haskell (specifically, why I like using Haskell)."
battlestations,3af2d2,Widdrat,3,Fri Jun 19 21:14:53 2015 UTC,I studied Haskell for about 3 weeks back in college (and Prolog). I was unable to understand the realistic application to purely functional languages. Thanks for your feedback.
battlestations,3af2d2,VankoTheBrony,3,Fri Jun 19 21:50:10 2015 UTC,"Haskell is very different from imperative languages like Java but it's nonetheless a general-purpose language that has potential applications in every area of software development, generally speaking.  I would expand on what /u/giggly_kisses said by saying that:   Haskell's type system is amazing. It's powerful and expressive and helps eliminate many potential runtime errors by allowing you to eliminate them at compile-time, to a degree beyond what's possible with other more conventional type systems I've used. It also arguably facilitates good design practices. Monads are a first-class feature of Haskell, and have dedicated syntax sugar for using monadic binds to sequence operations a la imperative code while retaining functional purity. That makes no sense to you, I know, and monads are a hard concept to grok, but they open up some very cool possibilities. Haskell is quite good with concurrency, in part because its insistence on separating pure code (no side effects) from impure code means that issues relating to state tend to come up less, but also because the reference implementation of the language simply does a good job implementing it. It's actually debatable whether lazy evaluation by default is a good language feature, as it can lend to odd performance issues due to the runtime building up large ""thunks"" of unevaluated expressions. Haskell allows you to force strictness, but laziness by default is not a friendly feature for beginners."
battlestations,3af2d2,Kutchyx,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:39:36 2015 UTC,"Lack of tooling, commercial support, and fewer online resources are some big reasons not to use Haskell.

battlestations,3af2d2,Rymere,2,Fri Jun 19 22:54:47 2015 UTC,"I agree that lack of tooling is a huge deal, and from what I've seen is definitely one of Haskells weak points.  I also agree with your sentiment towards Java as language (if I can help it, I hope to never use it again). But IMO I don't find Java tooling to be anything great. Ant and Maven are a huge pain in the ass, and Gradle only slightly alleviates that pain.  A language that I think has really good tooling is JavaScript. npm, nvm, Grunt, Gulp, Jake, Broccoli, etc. all very popular, relatively easy to use tools."
battlestations,3af2d2,xAimBot_,2,Sat Jun 20 00:40:37 2015 UTC,"And Javascript is an even worse language than vanilla Java, IMO.

For example:   It has a poor excuse for generics (type erasure at runtime, what the fuck?!) it has the philosophy of being a ""pure OOP"" language and yet still has primitives. Furthermore, the programmer can't create their own custom primitives. Why? it lacks a lot of modern programming feature up until recent versions (it took 8 versions to get lambdas? gimped ones at that)  packages are terribly implemented (com/why/the/fuck/are/there/so/many/directories/src)   As for JavaScript's terrible features, I've found that as long as I use strict mode, and lint my code you can avoid most of its weirdness. As for Java, they're baked right into the language and are much harder to work around.  I really want to try TypeScript, I've heard nothing but good things about it. And Web Assembly is looking to be very promising. It's about time we open up the ability for programmers to choice what language they use in the browser."

There is no comparison with 'normal' pc speakers, these are hifi. The sounds is comprehensive and enjoyable. Not harsh or fatiguing at all.  Compared with hifi speakers, these should probably cost more than they do. Good hifi bookshelf speakers plus a decent amp you are looking at, at least, £350.

battlestations,3af90h,new_to_theinternet,3,Sat Jun 20 03:24:29 2015 UTC,How do you afford all those hobbies??
battlestations,3af90h,new_to_theinternet,5,Fri Jun 19 21:51:51 2015 UTC,"Antique stores/Craigslist/Ebay/Steam sales :)   (Most of my wardrobe is from Goodwill as well).  TL:DR My hobbies don't really include disposing anything, just maintenance; ink, shaving soap, film, e-liquid, drum sticks/strings, and safety razors (disposable but a years worth costs <$10).  Most of the pens, watches, shaving, and camera stuff I have are decades old so they're cheap. Things made long ago weren't made to be thrown away so I've found that the quality of these are much better.  I have a straight razor that is at least 100 years old at the cost of a Gillette fusion razor and a few packs of cartridges - and works much better. RAD (Razor acquisition disorder) is real and can be a bitch to the bank account, though. I have a sharpening stone (hone) to maintain their edges so I don't need to send it to a honemeister. Shaving soap lasts almost for an eternity.  I have a $50 limit on what watches I'll buy and they are usually mechanical/automatic Russian brands. I haven't had to have any of my watches serviced but I know that will cost quite a bit.  I've found numerous fountain pens at antique stores for <$20 that still work great after a good cleaning.  Noodler's ink is the best bang-for-your-buck at $13/90ml which lasts a long time.  Old 35mm cameras are cheap and often just need a new battery. I'll be developing my own film soon so that hobby will get even cheaper. I did splurge on the Yashica ($150) at an antique store because I've been looking for one for a long time and still saved $50-150 considering Ebay listings. The film can be pricey but I haven't been very active in the past few years.  Vaping isn't that expensive, especially since I just buy e-liquid and wire (cheeaap) now. I also don't vape nearly as much as most people do.  The instruments (Not including my wife's black bass) were acquired over the years (Since 2000) and I was fortunate enough to receive a few instruments as gifts.  Oh, and the PC I got through making payments within PayPal's six-month-interest-free deal. All paid off, now :)"

Also, contributing less plastic to the local landfill is a nice feeling as well. Some have called me a hipster before but I couldn't care less (You can't digitally replicate the grain on film, anyway). If you are ever looking for new dishes, check out your local antique/thrift stores (specifically for the brands Corelle/Pyrex/Fireking) since those dishes have had regulary use for many years, yet still are in great shape and cheap.  Now, I do have a 2012 Ford Focus for the sweet 32-37mpg :)  Edit: These Corelle cups are pretty awesome if you enjoy coffee/tea."
battlestations,3af90h,mikaelfivel,2,Fri Jun 19 23:07:47 2015 UTC,"Learning to record, eh? I can offer you a few really quick, and simple ways of getting an immediate improvement out of your drum kit's sound if you'd like."
battlestations,3af90h,mikaelfivel,2,Fri Jun 19 18:37:52 2015 UTC,"I would absolutely appreciate it! I've been experimenting with different mic positions but I can never really get the toms to sound balanced. I'm using Ableton Live 9. Also, I have the Beta 52A in front of the bass drum's sound hole."
battlestations,3af90h,urection,2,Fri Jun 19 18:42:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah! experimenting is going to be your constant go-to. I would first switch the snare and floor tom mic (SM57s are by far one of the best snare mics you can find) and i'm guessing that's an Audix F12/F10 on the snare, which work great on toms anyways.   Second thing - and it will have an impact on how it feels to play, but will improve the sound - is to lift the cymbals (hihats included) considerably upward away from the drums so that you increase isolation of elements, and reduce bleed.   Third thing, for a less boxy sound on your drums, don't place the diodes so close to the heads. Lift them off and away but point them across the head at the opposite end of the hoop. This will give the toms a bit more life and less of that pangy, thwacky attack sound.   Basically, the mics are electronic ears, so if you put your ear where the microphone is, you can kinda tell what you're bound to pick up.   Are you using only one overhead microphone currently? Also, try positioning the bass kick mic (i love the B52a, favorite kick mic ever) above the sound hole about an inch off the head, about 5 inches away from the rim. I've found this gives a nice beefy response without too much boomy-ness or resonance.   Of course, what i'm saying isn't law, but they're things to consider and try out."
battlestations,3af90h,urection,2,Fri Jun 19 18:52:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Yeah, for some reason, I had always thought the f10 was for snares. I was also going to replace it with another 57 in the future. Or, should I grab another f10, replace the other 57 and then have two overhead mics?  I'll agree with lifting the cymbals - I've also been experimenting with putting a gate on the mics to isolate them.  Good call on pointing the mics across the heads, I'll try that!   above the sound hole about an inch off the head, about 5 inches away from the rim.   Like this?  Also, thanks again for the great tips!"
battlestations,3af90h,urection,2,Fri Jun 19 19:13:14 2015 UTC,"You know, an F10 on the snares would probably give it more low end response, which could be cool for certain types of music. The SM57 just happens to have the right diaphragm size and response to capture a good sound from snares. Before you consider replacing those mics, simply swap out which tom gets which mic and where they're placed. You may find the F10 picks up your rack tom really well. I play miked drums for a church and use an F10 on my rack tom and an F12 on the floor tom and they sound great.   Putting a gate on the mikes? which ones? if you want overheads to primarily capture cymbals, i'd start with just lifting the cymbals and if it has the option on the mic, to have the low end roll off so they only pick up mid-high frequencies.   Your bass kick mic placement is basically the same placement i use. I found that the mic sitting in line with the port hole itself actually cancelled out that nice fat thud sound because of the air rushing into the mic.   Again, though, time and experimentation are your best tools. If you have a friend over, one of you can be hitting the drum as the other moves the mic around as you hear back the monitored sound.  edit: and yeah, a second overhead, preferably a matching mic, would add a lot of value to your overall sound. That would allow you to record a stereo image of your kit."
battlestations,3af90h,BlackFenrir,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:42:49 2015 UTC,"Great points. Oh, I put the gates on snare and toms but I'll definitely try raising the cymbals."
battlestations,3af90h,mikedelfino,2,Fri Jun 19 19:56:31 2015 UTC,"On the gates, not a bad idea. You can do both at the same time. I was watching a video on youtube the other day about a guy who used triggers to control the gate while it was being miked naturally. I'll see if i can dig that up for you, it made me want to try that approach, too."

Recorded via: 100W Solid state Yorkville amp > audio interface > Ableton Live. Adjusted the EQ a little and added a slight delay for a stereo effect.  So yeah, it's not meant for slap. But the strings will slap if you hit them hard enough - which honestly isn't that hard - it just lacks the signature metal slap fretted basses have.   Also, it's fun to play harmonics on fretless basses because you can slide while the harmonics ring out (1:10ish)."

battlestations,3afdwk,kirbycommander,5,Fri Jun 19 20:39:32 2015 UTC,"The primary reason I use a secondary PC to stream is to reduce input lag, since I am a competitive counter-strike player. When you stream on 1 pc, even if you have 400fps the entire time while streaming, you feel mouse delay (in FPS games like cs, not in other games as much).  So by offloading all those OBS cycles onto another computer - my gaming pc isnt streaming anything and I can get full performance. I can also make the quality of my stream alot better.  I was thinking about making a tutorial, but since its different for everyone, id rather you ask me some specifics and I'll be happy to answer them.  For starters, in the streaming PC, you need a good capture card (avermedia, black magic, elgato), and a good cpu (i5 quad, i7 quad, amd fx series 6 or 8 core) to get the most out of your quality settings. The rest is pretty basic in terms of hardware needed.  but yeah, just ask away and ill be happy to answer, and thank you for the kind words about my setup :D"

battlestations,3aczxt,eoinster,2,Fri Jun 19 15:48:41 2015 UTC,"Plex is kind of both. It has a server component that streams media (videos, photos, music) and a client component that you watch it with. There are clients for Android and iOS as well as Windows/Mac, although you can just use the web client there. There are also media centers based around it, like RasPlex, although you still have to have a device to act as a server.  Just know that if you get a SHIELD, you're still missing the server component and there's nothing about the SHIELD that makes it any better for Plex than some other Android tablet. Personally, I'd use something like a chromecast to watch it on a TV. As far as the server, any computer where you have your media will work, although your experience will be much better if you have an always-on device like a NAS or server. I personally run mine on a home server that is primarily a NAS server and can access my media locally or remotely."

I saw the support for GRID, but it would be nice to stream from my PC as well. And you would still be missing the server component unless one of your friends had one set up.  And yeah essentially. It works in a way similar to netflix, but with your data. It's also nice if you have a bad internet connection and keep a lot of media. I'd say netflix is a better choice for the average person, but it doesn't have everything either. There's an even bigger difference in music where there's a lot of songs such as remixes, covers, etc. that aren't on services like Spotify.  Plex is free for most things, so you can always download it and try it out. One of the paid things it remote streaming, but you could simply forward ports on your router to get remote streaming. The paid remote streaming allows your to log into your Plex account at their site and automatically links your server without you having to get a domain name or remember your IP."

I ended up building a computer about 2 weeks later, and I haven't bought monitors yet because I don't have a use for this second TV at the moment.  It's actually kind of nice in my opinion. The plan is to buy 2-3 24+ inch monitors, but right now, this isn't too bad. I have the screen all the way on the back of my desk, and I have the keyboard tray fully extended. I would say that I am about 3.5-4 feet away from the screen.

I had to return 2 of them before finally getting one that wasn't damaged by the time I got home. I definitely wouldn't want this as a permanent solution if I owned a house, but as a desk for my bedroom in my apartment it's cheap for the sizes you can get. And the quality really isn't that bad when you get down to it. The surface finish is a little rough in my opinion compared to smoothly sanded wood, but then now I'm getting really picky.  TLDR: So much space for so little price."

battlestations,3aaklb,Sophomore,0,Fri Jun 19 18:29:08 2015 UTC,Either you are confused and meant speakers or I'm now seriously confused...
battlestations,3aaklb,HoodRichJanitor,2,Fri Jun 19 07:25:55 2015 UTC,"monitors are the more technical terms for speakers. ""Audiophile"" speakers are usually referred to as ""monitors."""
battlestations,3aaklb,NotreLux,2,Fri Jun 19 05:17:17 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. All monitors(in this sense) are speakers, but not speakers are monitors.   Monitors are active, so don't require an amp, and are designed that they can be used as independent units, having individual volume controls, power etc.   Speakers on the other hand are generally passive, and require and amp/receiver of some sort to power them.  I'd say most ""audiophile"" speakers aren't monitors."
battlestations,3aaklb,NotreLux,3,Fri Jun 19 06:00:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think monitors necessarily have to be active. I think they just need to be designed for constructing music rather than listening to it. So they have a dryer, more even and accurate sound, as opposed to say a warmer, deeper or lusher sound people may enjoy listening back to.   Many studios may have a set of both set up, so they can hear what it actually sound likes, and what people are likely to listen to."

battlestations,3a8edy,Leo0003,3,Thu Jun 18 11:03:47 2015 UTC,"Sure, subjectively it's ugly but that might just come from my growing hatred over the past year. Objectively, it has terrible airflow which wrecks my temps, no room for more fans or any watercooling, no SSD mounts, the front I/O is at the bottom which makes it hard to reach if your comp is on the ground, the auxiliary port on the front I/O is unusable because it makes your headphones sound like a static mess, also, those ports are loosely in there, so they wobble around, absolutely no cable management, top mounted power supply which in combo with no cable management puts the cables in a really annoying position, the PCIE slots in the back can only be payed out and broken as well as the disk drive so there are permanent holes in the case which ruins the already shit airflow. It opens like an upside down Delorean which is a gin mic and is actually a pain to work with, and the front panel swings open and is cheap plastic with a tacky design and font on it, you can't close it if you are using the USB ports in the front, the metal ""gpu cooler"" is completely useless, and two of the three fans died on me in the first 3 months."

Almost every website advantages from increased vertical space (on Reddit, you can see more comments/submissions, Facebook/Twitter/other social media, you can see more posts at once, on Skype you can see more of the conversation without having to scroll... ), and on music players such as Spotify you can see more of a playlist at once.

I've flipflopped between having both my monitors landscape and having one of the two portrait. I love the portrait setup because as the previous post said you can read infinity lines of everything, but there's definitely downsides to it.   My two biggest peeves about having a portrait monitor are: if i have a youtube video on my portrait while I'm doing something on the landscape, the video remains tiny despite being fullscreen because... well portrait. And also what drives me nuts is if I want to split screen vertically, have a top and bottom window I can't do that without manually adjusting and moving screens, I like having a quicksnap possibility on my screens that i can quickly split two windows on it.   For the rest I love it."

My buddy and I went round and round on this till I just decided to throw them in and try it since they've not got blocks on yet.   I agree that if you're doing it from scratch, it's probably a better plan to snag a X99 setup (hence why I have one, along with work stuff)"

To be totally fair there is a bit more hitching on the Z97 rig, but I'm not sure if that's cause I have a NVMe SSD + 32GB of high speed DDR4 in the X99 or due to the GPU/CPU/Mobo combo  Although: You can pry my X99 from my cold, dead hands. Epic CPU power is amazing for lots of stuff as is having copious amounts of RAM."
battlestations,3a5t64,gnu_bag,2,Wed Jun 17 16:16:24 2015 UTC,"I agree completely, my original plan was to upgrade to x99 at the same time...

battlestations,3a5t64,xramzal,-2,Wed Jun 17 16:14:48 2015 UTC,Pay attention? Skylake is the same reason I was suggesting he moved to x99. Which is why I pointed out Skylake-E.
battlestations,3a5t64,gnu_bag,3,Wed Jun 17 16:16:33 2015 UTC,I guess if OP wants to he could wait for Skylake-E he could wait but that's definitely not necessary for his setup. x99 is extremely expensive and only worth it if you plan to use it for other things besides gaming. If OP really wants to upgrade then skylake z170 will most likely be the better route.
battlestations,3a5t64,xramzal,-5,Wed Jun 17 16:47:13 2015 UTC,"I mean, its a really good cpu and I used to have one myself but it seems odd to have such an expensive build and not upgrade to like a 4790k or something"

My GPU's on the other hand were becoming a large hindrance and it has been years since I upgraded them (SLI 670s).  They were just too weak and lacking vram to power all 3 monitors.

battlestations,3a5t64,Aerodash,1 point,Thu Jun 18 09:27:26 2015 UTC,It depends on the motherboard but even if it was the case there would hardly be a noticeable drop in performance. The latest cards still don't take full advantage of the PCIe v3 bandwidth available to them of which the 3570k supports anyway.

There are about 20 System Restore ISO files in there along with other information / documents that if lost would be really, really bad. Also a lot of my school work / projects I'm working on go in there because they are extremely important.   Energy costs have gone up noticeably, but nothing drastic or noteworthy necessarily. The 2 larger Synology NAS ones (DS1815+ and DS1515+) Run on a schedule so are not actually on at all given times. Although, lately I have been running plex off my DS1815+ instead of my actual server pc just because it is much easier / quieter at night.

The 1.5TB is going to be replaced this year with another 3TB HGST or even a 4TB (depends on the price development and what else needs to be replaced).

battlestations,3a275r,djnaden,11,Tue Jun 16 23:04:50 2015 UTC,"I'm about to be a Sophomore at the University of Texas at Austin. I'm a computer science major, if that explains anything lol. I haven't worked since last summer after senior year of high school. From 10th through 12th grade I ran a little local computer business. Nothing fancy, just a few of my friends who are pretty technologically inclined helping out people set up their own networking solutions like WiFi / Cell boosters things of that nature, speeding up older computers using a program one of the people who worked for me actually wrote, and also by helping people set up printers/fax machines and get their computers loaded up.  By the end of summer after senior year I had either 6 or 7 kids working for me at the time. It was all fairly basic and we never over charged so we actually never had any competition, and the community really enjoyed and benefited from our services. The thing about today's world is that people who are younger are now growing up with computers, cell phones, and portable laptops and stuff like that, as compared to say my 50+ year old former neighbor who once bought a PC from Best Buy and couldn't figure out how to turn the dang thing on. That was actually the start of my business. Sophomore year, about 2 weeks into schools my mom says the neighbor called asking if I could help him learn some stuff and set up a printer. So I set up his printer, fax machine, laptop, wireless internet, and go run an errand to go get another tv remote from his cable company.  Then at the end he says well it took you what, 2 and a half hours? What do you think is fair, 50? And immediately I'm thinking this guys just yanking my chain, but he paid me 50 dollars and I decided this would be a great business to go into. My best friend and I started it up and put out some flyers on the mailboxes, and within about a week we had at least 2 customers a day total, which solidly grew up until I left. Where I handed it down to my little brother who's going to be a Junior next year. He now has 10 employees, but I still get 10% of the profits to this day. Wasn't even my idea, but we agreed that if I let my former employees work under him, let him use the anti virus and computer speed up scripts one of them wrote, and legally transfer the business over to his name that he would for one run the business himself as head and then give me 10% of the profits, which is actually 10% of all revenue because we don't charge by the hour and include routers and modems, we go buy the products ourselves, bring the receipts with us and then the customer pays in full for the time spent there (hrs worked/services rendered) as well as all hardware."

battlestations,3a275r,whoisthedrizzle,2,Wed Jun 17 03:23:15 2015 UTC,"Hook'em!!! Thanks man, I really appreciate it!   And yes haha, I loved that job. The awesome part is once you start getting a few customers here and there (given you do a good job) word starts to spread by mouth throughout the community, so you don't actually have to advertise.   Just make sure you can offer people your services for less than they could get it done by say Best Buy Geek Squad or another local professional computer repair service. Back when I ran it we had one person who had built their own pc, but we never offered that to customers. I'm assuming that if we could've at the time it would have helped us grow. Oh well, good luck to your future endeavors! Pm me if you have any questions."

battlestations,3a275r,sss7527,4,Wed Jun 17 12:22:34 2015 UTC,Might I ask what your field of work is? A 4790k and a 780 + 16gb of ram for a htpc feels extremely overkill atleast imo!
battlestations,3a275r,sss7527,3,Tue Jun 16 23:31:25 2015 UTC,"Well, it never starts off as an i7 4790k w/ 16gb of ram and a gtx 780.   It starts off like this.  Dang, that InWin D-Frame Mini is one good looking case. 1 week later Oh wow look that case is on sale! I guess I do have an extra SSD I could throw in there, and oh yeah that PSU I needed to return because 800W EVGA G2 PSU won't be enough for my SLI 980s I can just make work in this case since it takes ATX PSUs, so that means I don't even have to go through the trouble of returning it. And then it begins.... I buy the case.  Then the hunt begins. I wait patiently for deals, and boom the 16gb of ram goes on sale on newegg for $95 or $100 or whatever, buy it. The GTX 970 MSI 4g promo goes live and then BH Photo has a $15 MIR and it's only $330 because no tax and not including MIR yet. Then I go to micro center... talk to the lady. She says oh the i5 4690k will be fine for what you need, but why not spend just 2/5ths more than I already am and get the top of the line 1150 processor is what I'm asking myself... and oh wow those H100i GTX AIO Coolers are sweet, can't believe MC already has them.... so I get both. Then I get the VII Impact cheap from Newegg because of a deal, buy some custom sleeved cables, and boom there it is. 2 grand invested and I built myself a whole new system.   When I start these projects I tell myself I'm going to budget myself and not overkill it, but each time I have to ask if it's worth that extra fraction of the cost to get something that is faster or faster? The answer is almost always yes.  Originally told myself I'd go with the Asus-E something mitx motherboard from MC so I could use the coupon, but my store never got them and in stock and oh how convenient the best MITX board on the market is red/black, my color scheme :). I've learned to love the process so much though. The hunt for deals, the researching of which part is better, which version of the 970 should I get.   BTW: I mention the 970 because I had the MSI 4g in there for about 3 months, but then when I decided to water cool I got the 780 Poseidon instead with the already included GPU block. The 970 is about to be put to use though, no worries haha.  Edit: Check my response to the post above as for my field of work. Or PM me if you want to know more"

battlestations,3a275r,dieselstation,3,Tue Jun 16 20:13:26 2015 UTC,Mind if I ask what is your monitor stand? Do you recommend it? Any sagging involved?
battlestations,3a275r,subflax,5,Tue Jun 16 18:24:44 2015 UTC,"Ok I'll give you the full run down.   For the single monitor stand, here is the link to the product page. This is a type of clamp mount where it screws into the edge/back of the desk and keeps the monitor up sturdy without any screws/drilling. The arm can move freely and is very stable. Overall I would recomennd this 10/10 to any friend. This is the one I used for my Acer GN246HL on the left side.  As for the one housing my BenQ monitors (the triple stand one), here is the link for that product. This thing came in a ginormous box from Amazon, and is amazingly sturdy, BUT the base was under sized in all of their product pictures horribly. It is huge. Big big. The wingspan of the arms is not adjustable, so if you are planning on putting this in the corner of your room you will be forced to pull your desk out quite a fair bit just to be able to fit it. Where I have it in the album I posted, the edges of the arms are actually touching wall to wall. However, the screws that hold the monitors in their current upright/curved position are amazing. With this mount I have had no trouble at all with them collapsing, moving when I don't even touch them or any of that. I give these a 6.5/10 as far as to say I would recommend these to a friend. The pros are the monitors, once placed, stay in position very securely, the base, although massive, does provide good solid support for the monitors without any tilting, and it keeps the monitors in a good position for viewing, no noticeable sagging. The cons are the wingspan takes up SO much space, planning is needed ahead of time, the installation process was fairly difficult as the instructions included were very brief, and the holes that were meant for my montior cables are way too small to house all 3 monitors power cables and dvi/hdmi cables, so that's a bit of a bummer.   Now, for the acer triple monitor stand here is the link. These ones are by far the most dissapointing. Becuase these were going to face outward towards the hallway, I needed a stand that could have retractable arms to both fit in the corner as well as look nicer without the huge eagle arm spread. In that sense, these worked well, but the base could not support it worth a crap. I have to put my InWin D-Frame Mini case just slightly over the back edge of them so that the monitors don't take a nose first dive straight onto my keyboard and into my lap. They are not stable at all. However, this could also be because of the Acer VESA mount adapter kits I got off Amazon since the H236HLbid does not have VESA mounting already included. These ones would be able to fit in a corner, but in my honest opinion, these would get a 4/10 and I would tell my friend to try and look elsewhere. The product feels cheaply made, especially when compared to my other two mounts. The screws holding the monitors in their upright position wiggle constantly, and everytime I sit down to get on that computer I have to readjust them so they are actually bezel to bezel and not an inch in front of one another obstructing my vision of all 3 screens.   Did I answer your questions? If you want to know any more specifics just reply to this post and I'll respond ASAP."

Never really understood it though, triple monitors are more of a personal preference (in my opinion, speculation).   My IPS Triple monitor set up has increased my work productivity at least two fold. I need the color accuracy of the IPS screens for the models I draw, but then when 3d rendering or something more gpu/ram intensive, I just use my triple monitor TN panels because they have sli 980s behind them rather than a single 970, or rather now 780."
battlestations,3a275r,OmeletteDuLeFromage,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:17:31 2015 UTC,"you use all 3 for drawing the models? do you draw multiple at a time, or do you have one zoomed in or working on a different part, or what?"
battlestations,3a275r,urbn,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:33:53 2015 UTC,"Multiple at a time. Usually just zoomed in parts of different models I'm working on. For some introductory class I took as an elective we had to make a 3d model of a real life appliance related to technology, so I did the 3d rendering on my main rig, then just brought that over to the IPS panels and did all the shading and filling in of colors to complete it. Also extremely ADHD, so keeping myself busy with actual work on all three screens is beneficial in that I don't get too distracted :)."

battlestations,3a275r,_entropical_,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:51:38 2015 UTC,"Well, if you can see in the pictures how there are 3 monitors in one corner, and then 3 monitors in the other corner, just imagine right in the middle where they intersect (so like right above the middle of my DS1815+) about 3 feet up a 40ft 1080p tv with an Apple TV, an Xbox One, my cable box, and my htpc hooked up to it. There was some sort of program I saw where my HTPC can actually control all the devices on there and multitask between two at once if need be. Not really sure how useful something like that would be for me, but it'd be cool to look into. Behind the U-desk (where I took the ""Big Picture"" pic in the imgur library) there is a fouton, so it'll fit in nicely I think.   I've already bought the mount I'm going to be putting it on, but I'm just being greedy and stalling because I want to keep playing ESO on the 60"" tv in my living room where my xbox one is hooked up haha.

Either, invest in a dual monitor mount ""stand"", or buy two of those wire-mess stands for monitors and place the Xbox one under it. 2. Buy a large, or small mouse mat, even if your mouse operates fine, it'll still add a better look. 3. All though not very important, just makes it look alot better, invest in either two, or one of the same monitors. them both being the same really cleans it up."

A good option is use a belt sander, or by hand sand the desk completely down, make it so improfections cannot be veiwed, than purchase a cheap stain, or paint (Could be black, don't know how it would look with handles, I would stick with wood finish) and do that. If you take your time on it you can have your desk looking completely new. Another thing you can do, take our those three or four drews and convert it into a cabnet, place the computer in there."

battlestations,39xeru,yahia_shkokany,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:06:42 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I actually may have jumped the gun in assuming that's a part of the IBM complex I live near. The one I'm talking about is their original site in Endicott, NY. I left to go to lunch with my girlfriend, and snapped this photo as we drove by. You can see at the top of the building where their logo used to be.  It's actually a fairly sad story for my area. When IBM closed down this plant, it essentially crippled our economy. We've been attempting to recover ever since. A company called Endicott Interconnect Technologies took over the complex. However, I believe they entered bankruptcy after some shady business dealings. So I'm not entirely sure whether or not they're still around. The only business that I'm aware of that is using any of the buildings in that complex is BAE Systems.   Regardless of who is currently inhabiting the building, much of it fell into disrepair after IBM left the area. The site is too large for any company smaller than IBM to completely utilize and maintain. So, they simply closed off a lot of it, and as far as I know, have allowed it to rot from the inside.  It's a sad story, sure, but it's also a very interesting piece of history for my area. I would love to see things improve. I would also love to see some restoration begin on the buildings, as it's an extremely cool complex. As it stands though, we're still in a bit of a decline, and crime is rising quickly in that area.  Edit: I believe your main background is a part of the complex that I'm talking about. I know where that is, but it is nowhere I could get near without their campus police force approaching me. It's down a massive flight of stairs, and in a but of a gully between the building and the street above. The complex is huge, and there are a lot of portions of it that I have never taken a good look at."

battlestations,39swnb,ItsOnlyRocketScience,44,Sun Jun 14 14:27:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Well I have used a 32"" 4K monitor without scaling and 32"" for me is as small you can go without scaling.  40"" works great without scaling. I don't code , but i do use Lightroom and Photoshop. And i love it. The mouse is OK, I have had some issues with it. If it was to far away away from the base station it would lag. And when that happend I didn't think it was that far away (< 1m) But that could be some interference. The rubber things on the isde is starting to come of, so if I would buy a new mouse today i wouldn't have chosen the mamba.  WALLPAPER: https://dribbble.com/louiscoyle/projects/243171-Lakeside"
battlestations,39swnb,ItsOnlyRocketScience,14,Sun Jun 14 14:48:37 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. I'll probably steer clear of that mouse then.
battlestations,39swnb,The__,8,Sun Jun 14 15:22:26 2015 UTC,If you're looking for a wireless mouse I'd definitely recommend the G602. Had mine for about a year now with no complaints.
battlestations,39swnb,Sky_Light,6,Sun Jun 14 16:39:30 2015 UTC,"Definitely second this. The G602 is the first wireless mouse I've used that never decided to just wig out and send my cursor across the screen.

I develop websites, so I first got this Dell monitor just for previewing the website on, while having another 1080p monitor for coding, but I ended up viewing the website and coding both on the 4k monitor because it looks just so much nicer, and the other monitors just didn't get used at all.  I went from 3 1080p 22"" monitors to a single 24"" 4K monitor, for web development, and I have no regrets at all. In fact, I have already sold my 1080p monitors.  If you have a Mac, text will look even nicer. Text rendering on OSX for HDPI displays is for some reason much better than Windows its text rendering."

I work in a remote office and most of our interactions are done via some type of computer communication. It was my assumption that everybody sounds like shit because of that. Then one guy at my company dropped $40 for a mic and he sounds like a god damned radio announcer. Super clear. No background noise. It was awesome.

Are you going to have Facebook (one of the 17 biggest time wasters) open in one monitor and your work open in another? How about you just use one monitor, focus on your work, finish it faster, and then use Facebook to your heart's content when you are done? And don't try and give me some bullshit about how it makes you more productive either. I've never seen a computer program which requires more than one monitor to run."

battlestations,39rnjb,Timues,-1,Sun Jun 14 09:22:30 2015 UTC,My experience of ultrawide IPS screens has been that they are not worth the money. My first AOC have severe glow followed by its replacement that also have severe bleeding. I decided to part with my money and bought the 34inch Samsung VA ultrawide and the screen is glorious. The black is black. No dead pixels and absolutely no glow. I'd recommend a TA panel as I don't think I could ever be happy with an IPS screen because if the glow for the price you are paying.

battlestations,39rnjb,_Kraksx_,0,Sun Jun 14 11:16:56 2015 UTC,"Be aware of a few things. You mean a VA panel, and while the contrast is much better yes, the colour won't be as good as on an IPS. Also, there have been a lot of reports of the text giving eye strain due to the way the panel type handles it. Black crush is also a problem on VA panels.  Neither one is better than the other, just have to go with what you can stand better,"
battlestations,39rnjb,grandslammed,0,Sun Jun 14 15:21:43 2015 UTC,The colour in my opinion is far better with the VA panel as the blacks are actually black. The Samsung can be calibrated to 99% sRGB IIRC. I'm currently writing a large report at the moment and viewing text is fine for hours on end.
battlestations,39rnjb,grandslammed,0,Sun Jun 14 15:58:14 2015 UTC,Right - the colour might look better because of the contrast but they're definitely nowhere as near as accurate as IPS - otherwise VA would have taken over some time ago.
battlestations,39rnjb,Cheecher,0,Sun Jun 14 16:02:48 2015 UTC,Colour accuracy is nothing without the correct contrast. Don't think many people are going to benefit from 100 sRGB over 99%.
battlestations,39rnjb,JC--,0,Sun Jun 14 16:21:38 2015 UTC,Photographers and so on have been using IPS monitors for years without the contrast harming their work at all. Colour accuracy is very different to contrast. Most IPS monitors should be able to hit around 1000 which is fine.

And do you mainly use it to adjust the volume?  I've been thinking about upgrading my 10-year-old Creative speakers to something of better quality, but I have very little knowledge of how it all works. Is the audio interface required if I get any kind of good speakers?"
battlestations,39sfgm,CoffeeDrivenCoder,2,Sun Jun 14 18:31:45 2015 UTC,"Sure!  The interface is actually a dedicated audio input/output device. It's used to equalize and mix inputs from multiple sources, then send the signal to multiple outputs. It's recording-oriented hardware, but it does improve sound quality because it uses really good components to switch between analog and digital signals.  If you want to build a purely listening setup, however, an interface is overkill. What you will need is the following:  1) A digital-to-analog converter (DAC), to get the signal out of the computer into the speakers  2) An amplifier, to magnify the signal, also maybe equalize it  3) Good speakers or headphones.  A traditional audio setup is based on using the already-integrated components. PC sound card, be it internal or USB, will provide the first two. Most desktop speakers come with an internal amplifier (if they come with a volume knob and power adapter, they're amplified) and some come with a DAC that bypasses yor PC's sound card (if they have USB input, they come with a DAC).  If you wanna go full-audiophile, you can buy those components separately and mix-and-match! It's expensive, but it gives you greater flexibility than a traditional setup.  EDIT: I saussage-finger-posted this before I was done."
battlestations,39sfgm,darkjedi1993,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:01:43 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for the explanation!   I've thought about getting M-Audio AV32, since I've seen the brand several times here on /r/Battlestations. Do you have any suggestions for a good pair of speakers (maximum $150)? I really like the fact, that there is only two speakers and not a subwoofer that requires room under the table etc.  What is your opinion on speaker stands? I remember reading a post here on /r/Battlestations where a guy recommended IsoAcoustics. Do you think I will notice a difference if i get speaker stands?"
battlestations,39sfgm,darkjedi1993,2,Sun Jun 14 23:17:48 2015 UTC,"Brand-wise, you can't go wrong with M-Audio. I don't have personal experience with that particular model, though, so I can't tell if they're good or not. You should read some reviews!  What I can tell you, though, is that they only reach down to 80Hz in frequency, so you might feel they're lacking in bass. Personally, the bass boost equalization in my speakers is more than enough, but others might expect more. In any case, you could always buy a subwoofer later if you need more bass. I haven't been able to find an actual frequency response curve for those speakers, but I trust M-Audio will have a good response across the spectrum.  Regarding speaker stands... You should understand that stands accomplish two things:   First, they isolate the speaker from the surface it's standing on, reducing vibration transfer and resonance. There's some debate whether this helps or not. I guess YMMV. Second, and more important, they help you better position your speakers. If you point your speakers towards you, you will notice a drastic improvement in audio projection and positioning. Here's a picture of one of my speakers in its stand. You see how it's inclined upwards? The improvement is marked even more if the speaker is at ear level or ""looking at you"".   So yeah, get stands if you can afford them and you have space for them... but as long as you can make them point towards you (or even better, if you can point them at your head) you can already noticeably improve the sound quality. Getting your speakers off the table might be even better, but is not such a drastic measure."

Their physical dimensions are 24.0"" x 15.0"" x 7.4"".  I get what you mean, mounting monitors becomes difficult when they're so long width-wise.

Right now I have the ATH M50x headphones and some random brand speakers, but I mostly use the headphones. I've always used my internal sound card and never tried a good sound card such as the one you have. I've read reviews and everyone says the difference is really big.  What would you say about it? Do you think it's worth the 67€?"
battlestations,39rpxi,adixgaming,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:19:42 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think it's a worthwhile upgrade, but I still waited until the sound card was on sale to purchase it. The difference between on-board sound and the sound card is pretty big.  I picked up the Sound Blaster Z for a few reasons:   The card has a dedicated headphone output that is amplified, and (according to the specs) supports up to 600 ohm headphones. Most on-board sound cards have low output impedance, or non-amplified audio jacks. I noticed an increase in volume, and a bit of a bass boost with my headphones when switching from on-board to the sound card, even with the EQ and Creative features disabled. Of course, a headphone amplifier will also provide this same benefit. I like the fact that I can save individual settings in the software for speakers and headphones, then switch between them without by selecting a single option in the Creative Control panel. I have a second output running to my receiver for when I just want to listen to music, and the ability to switch the current application's output from headphones to speakers without disrupting playback in the current application is great. For the Sound Blaster Z series, there's a free 3rd party application by applejack on the Creative Forums called SBZ-Switcher that makes this even easier. I actually like a few of the SBX Pro Studio features, mainly the surround emulation when using headphones. It's not perfect, but it does a pretty good job of emulating surround sound with my Sennheiser HD 558's in games. The positional audio is fairly accurate over headphones.   Sorry for the wall of text, but I hope the information helps. I'd pick up the card again if I were still using on-board sound, but A DAC and Headphone amplifier is another solid option."

battlestations,39rpxi,TerranByte19,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:42:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comment! It was a little tricky getting the monitor arm installed on the MALM desk, but the end result works well.   I had to disassemble the mounting hardware for the MX arm, flip the L shaped bracket around, then reassemble the mounting hardware in order for there to be enough clearance to secure the arm to the underside of the desk.    To attach the monitor arm to the desk, I had to remove the top of the desk from the MALM legs and cable tray, then attach the arm to the removed top. Once the arm was mounted to the desk top, I was able to reassemble the MALM desk. There's not quite enough clearance in the cable tray under the desk to turn the dial to tighten down the mounting hardware with the desk fully assembled. Once the desk is reassembled, the arm is definitely not going anywhere easily."

Much easier to connect new devices, just tilt, swivel, and pivot enough for me to stick my head underneath to see where I'm plugging in. Standing took a few weeks to get used to, but it's very natural now. Gaming is no problem, either.

Maybe it's not as bad while sitting directly in front of it (I haven't tried that) but from a bit higher it seems weird. What's your take on that?
battlestations,39plze,Krysys,1 point,Sun Jun 14 01:13:12 2015 UTC,"It's definitely less noticeable when directly in front of it. Honestly, I was skeptical about the both the curved and ultrawide hype. I had kept my eye on the LG 34UM95 for awhile, but couldn't quite pull the trigger. However, a deal came up for the Dell which made it the same price as the LG, so I went for it. The Dell also comes with a better warranty, panel guarantee, and better stand. Having owned it a few months now, I love the ultrawide aspect for gaming and productivity, but the curved part is not a feature I would pay extra for IMO, as I don't find it substantially more immersive at this size than flat.

So I'm curious to know what you think."
battlestations,39plze,Zarknox,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:21:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely! I want to have as many experiences with headphones as I can in order to better understand the perfect headphone setup for me. Whether that's by comparing sound signatures, open/closed, dynamic/planar/electrostatic, I think all of that is important in making the best educated decision. I didn't want to fool myself into believing that throwing as much money as I could from the get go would be the best ""endgame"". If it turns out that way, then that's fine. But it's very possible I could be as happy with a $300 pair as I would be with a $1500+ pair.    That said, since you have the HD800s, has your opinion of the HD600s changed at all? Do you still enjoy listening to the HD600s as much you did when you got them, or are the HD800s that much better?"
battlestations,39plze,youcrew,2,Sun Jun 14 01:52:38 2015 UTC,"Yes actually, the comfort of the HD800s is so far beyond that of the HD600s. As far as sound signature, they are so similar but the HD800s seems to do everything better. Overall the biggest difference is how articulate the HD800 is and soundstage/instrument separation being much better.

Oh and I'm curious about one thing; at what point do you just build yourself an actual NAS (ala UnRAID or FreeNAS) instead of buying more NAS appliances? I'm sure that one big UnRAID system with 20 drives would be way cheaper than the QNAPs + the other mysterious box.

I added a post yesterday after this one in the retro section yesterday of my gear from the millenia era in which everything all home built.   https://www.reddit.com/r/retrobattlestations/comments/39rh91/my_battlestation_from_19992000/?ref=share&ref_source=link  I used to build all my own gear but it always required more time and effort to support. I make a bit of money on some of this gear so I need it up and running all the time. Using name brand products and builds offer better support options when in need. I buy it all used or broken and fix as necessary. I've been running those QNaps since 2008 and I've only had to replace one fan. It's the drives themselves that cost the money. The highest cost in that rack was the LTO4 which I paid $500 off ebay for it a year and a half ago. It still a few years of warranty on it after extending it.

If you can afford the sub, get it. If you can't, they're still really nice speakers that are worth the buy."

battlestations,39pxi1,hckyplyr606,1 point,Sun Jun 14 14:26:27 2015 UTC,"FL is a fantastic learning tool and a perfect way to get started with music production. Ableton simply comes with more features and abilities (albeit these can all be added to FL studio) that a beginner wouldn't necessarily need, and tends to emulate a professional environment more than an experimental one.  I'm sure some people will disagree, but that's how I see it after using both for a few years. If FL studio works for you, definitely use it. If you feel it's lacking, give Ableton a go :)"
battlestations,39pxi1,zarny77,2,Sun Jun 14 16:44:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if I could, I would use FL. I really enjoy the interface a lot more.   FL feels more like I'm making music and composing. Ableton to me feels like I'm doing some advanced engineering (which isn't a bad thing) but the vibe is different.   The only bad thing with FL for me is that I cannot use Komplete Kontrol with it. The Komplete Kontrol midi controller is one of the greatest things I've ever used and having the full NI Komplete with it is just unstoppable so I will never switch from ableton, although I enjoy the feel of Logic and FL better.  I also use the APC 40 and will start using it for live stuff so Ableton is a necessity.  FL is a great program for learners like many say, but I would say just suck it up and learn ableton and you'll never be able to go without it. It's extremely intuitive which also means that almost everything you would want has been thought about. (unless you had a Macbook Retina for the few years that the resolution wasn't supported....)  Anyway, cheers. Love the setup. Would love to get a multi monitor setup for mine soon."

I would've gotten a 1440p IPS panel, but far too expensive and this is still way nice. Also just sold my GTX 760 via eBay and got a new 290X.  Small upgrades! I plan to replace the keyboard (Sidewinder X4) soon with a mechanical one. The mouse is superb (Mionix Naos 3200) and I will keep it for a while.  Bought that sexy little Lepai for my dad's old Realistic Minimus 7's. They need to be sanded down and repainted, but they sound good. 30 years old. Also used a Y-Splitter from my 3.5mm output to hook up a *Pioneer subwoofer since the Lepai only outputs to one set of speakers.  Trying to find a purpose for my old Nexus 7. It looks nice off to the side of my keyboard but serves no purpose.  EDIT: Also, the network adapter on the left under the monitor is because I have run out of slots on my mobo (ASRock Pro3 Gen3) and need an external adapter. Would get a USB one but this works fine and I don't want to invest $50 in one that is as good and hogs USB ports.  EDIT: Oh! And the computer of course. Gotta love that cable clutter ;-)"
battlestations,39q6zi,themaskyrobot,2,Sat Jun 13 18:07:39 2015 UTC,"Hey, those are my guts! :)  That monitor looks really slick. What's your experience in eBay?

Hope you can give me a bit of advice there."
battlestations,39q6zi,sammen89,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:28:43 2015 UTC,"You ""get"" the money through PayPal, but it doesn't deposit into your account until 5-10 days after they RECEIVE the item. I'd much rather do Craigslist or Hardwareswap where the funds come in immediately. There is less risk with eBay, but also less reward.  However, I sold my GPU when someone messaged me over eBay after seeing my listing and was in the area.  I bought the monitor after seeing a month-old listing for it at $175 on Craigslist. I said $135 and he said sure. One thing with eBay is that most people aren't willing to lower the price much.  Buying on eBay is nice, because most people are quick to ship after you pay and it's got eBay's satisfaction guarantee and some people will take returns.  The monitor is great, but the stand isn't fantastic, and since my table is sort of flimsy, until I put it on a sturdy desk in my dorm room, it shakes with the table.

battlestations,39lxc2,C4ples,20,Fri Jun 12 17:42:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Here's what I did:   Remove panels from case and disassemble wire mesh and window by gently prying the tabs back. Covered the parts of the panels that I didn't want to paint with masking (just used blue painters tape and newspaper). Lightly sanded all panels with 240 as the paint was in great shape. Just needed to get some tooth for the primer. Did not sand down to bare metal. Primered the metal and plastic panels with Rust-Oleum Flat White Primer made for metal and plastic. There might be better paints out there, but Rust-Oleum had the blue that I was looking for and I didn't want to experiment with mixing brands. First few coats were very light, just a dusting really. Last few coats were a bit heavier. All coats painted within the recommended one hour. Let the panels cure (dry) for 24 hours then sanded the primer with 600 grit to remove some orange peel. Optional. Painted the base coat of baby blue. Again very light and then a bit heavier. Completed in one hour.  Let the panels cure again for 24 hours. Masked off the area that wasn't going to be the stripe using 3M automotive masking tape. I detacked the tape on my jeans as I didn't want to accidentally pull up the blue. Burnished the edges of the tape to avoid any seeping under the tape. Very light sprays over edges of masking and then progressively heavier. This helped seal the edges of the mask to avoid seepage. Dry again. Mask again. Paint again. Let paint dry for one week and then applied Rust-Oleum clear gloss enamel. The orange-red that I needed only came in flat. I wouldn't recommend using this clear unless you absolutely need it. The blue looked great in gloss, but the clear gloss didn't not apply as evenly as I would have liked. Let the clear dry for 24 hours and then applied decals. Next week, after the clear has cured for a full week, I will apply some wax to protect the paint and add some more gloss.   Let me know if you have any specific questions. It's really all about the prep and taking your time."
battlestations,39lxc2,C4ples,9,Fri Jun 12 17:55:46 2015 UTC,"Not original dude, but damn I appreciated that explanation.   I am in the middle of painting an S340...I don't work for NZXT though :P not sure their stance on Australians!  I'm following a similar set of instructions...I don't have an ideal environment or any skills, but I'm doing the best I can. This looks really professional, have you painted before?  I'm laying down my colour, I've done many, many very light coats and I'm getting a lot of orange peel. I've sanded through it, but even going from 600-2000 grit wet sandpaper and then rubbing/polishing compound my finish has tiny micro scratches. It is as smooth as silk, but visually, it has a bit of a brushed aluminium look...whereas I thought it would end up quite flat.   My plan is to apply the clear and see how that comes up. Whether that fills in the marks and maybe even needs a light sand/polish itself.   So I guess, my point boils down to...is you finish flat or is it a bit of orange peel? As I noted you didn't mention sanding between coats.   However it is, are you happy with it? As I guess my final decision will be whether to leave it in it's current sort of state with the micro lines or leave the orange peel texture.   Thanks and congratz on the new job :)"
battlestations,39lxc2,thebornotaku,4,Fri Jun 12 21:03:24 2015 UTC,"If I would have had the time I would have color sanded each time, but cure time ate everything I had. There is definitely orange peel there and more specs in there than I would care to mention, but it will work for me. I haven't rattle canned anything like this before, but the next time I do this I will definitely be saving my pennies to get the good automotive paint. Two part primer is much better and you can lay down very flat coats without having to worry so much about orange peel (provided you've thinned your paint properly).   Clear, especially gloss, will only highlight your flaws. Your one best opportunity to get rid of microscratches is in the primer. I haven't seen colorsanding beyond 1200 grit do much to surface finish, other than making it difficult to get the clear to stick. I have a few more builds planned this year and I will budget more time and money for the paint.   Would love to see your S340."

It was and is my first mechanical keyboard and I've had it for almost 2 years now and it holds perfectly. The only con I have for it is that the bottom row (CTRL, win key, ALT, spacebar, etc) is special sized, so your average keycap pack don't fit there and you have to spend even more money ordering them from someone who can make them that special size.

battlestations,39ljow,ocarinaboy96,5,Fri Jun 12 16:16:38 2015 UTC,"I always hate giving out the specs because people tend to think I'm a complete idiot. The desktop has an i7-3820X, 16 gigs of standard ram, EVGA x79 FTW mobo, two 660ti's, two small SSDs and a few other drives that give me ~7tb of storage. Its a HAF 932 case.   As far as peripherals go I have a logitech g700s mouse, corsair k70 keyboard (MX reds), a blue yeti mic, some webcam, 3 unremarkable monitors and a HD tv. My audio goes through my home theater reciever, Danon AVR X1100W, which powers two polk floor standing speakers (TSX330 or something), and some audio technica ATH M50x headphones. I think thats about it... its a real bitch to movie it from place to place."

battlestations,39ljow,QwarkDreams,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:14:30 2015 UTC,"You're just being humble and there is nothing wrong with that. I think those specs are fine and fit together nicely.   You may already know this but when you're ready with the money, whatever you do, don't skimp on your center channel. Espcially with the towers you have. WTMW center would, imho, be easier to match to those towers than a mtm. Btw, what sub is that?"

battlestations,39ml19,PJ7004,2,Fri Jun 12 21:39:54 2015 UTC,It sounds good (and much better than having the speakers behind the monitor stand which is how they were on my old desk).  I'm planning on getting speaker isolation pads that are wedge shaped in order to better aim them at me when in use and also prevent them from rattling on bass-heavy music and video games.
battlestations,39ml19,Wootwoot97,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:04:59 2015 UTC,Grab a cable tray like Ikeas Signum and tuck them all up under your desk. Works like a charm for easy cable management.

As long as you're comfortable using a measuring tape, a speed square and some form of saws, the rest isn't too hard to pick up.  I bet there are some fantastic tutorials on youtube on making the necessary joints.  The really important part, IMO, was the planning I did before I made the desk.  Actually making the desk only took like 8-10 hours, if that.  But I spent probably 20+ hours on the CAD design (partly just learning how to do CAD).  You could work out the design on paper instead but I think that's the most crucial part of the project."

battlestations,39lj72,panda_foo,6,Fri Jun 12 17:17:35 2015 UTC,"They arrived yesterday, I figured if I am going to buy them in a couple of months after I move, why not buy them now!? :-)  Honestly, they are cracking. I have sennheiser HD650 headphones and the DAC you can see in the pic is an Epiphany Acoustics EHPO2Di. (I big time recommend investigating a seperate DAC like this, makes a genuinely huge difference vs the Xonar soundcard I had before). The sound with the headphones is excellent but I now prefer the A5+ for general listening.  I mean, they look brilliant in Bamboo, but I was genuinely surprised by the sound they give. Good bass, good mids, detailed highs. I am not an audiophile but I do like good sound (hence the HD650s) and I am massively impressed by these A5+ speakers.  I have had, and have, hifi speakers (currently for home cinema and music), for me, for the price, these speakers give a cracking sound, really good soundscape, effortless sound at lower volumes due to the 5 inch speakers, effortless sound at HIGH volumes. Overall I'm bloody happy tbh. Music ranging from The Pixies, to Bob Marley, to Iron Maiden, to ACDC, to Beethoven, to Mozart.   tldr, they're bloody good, sound good, look good. Can't really fault them at all."
battlestations,39lj72,panda_foo,4,Fri Jun 12 17:33:25 2015 UTC,"I kept reading ""cracking"" as ""crackling"" and was confused to why you were stoked on speakers that crackled.

battlestations,39henl,AudioMan612,30,Fri Jun 12 14:43:04 2015 UTC,"Awesome setup!  Some suggestions for the speakers (other than the Magnepans and that M-Audio ""center""):  So typically you want your speakers in a vertical setup, not horizontal.  This is especially true of monitors where you do critical listening.  Here is a brief explanation.  In addition to this, tweeters should be at ear level (or close to it and tilted to make up the difference), and speakers should be on isolation stands.  The isolation part is important, because when you furniture is allowed to absorb the vibrations of your speaker cabinets, it will muddy up the sound (especially affecting lower frequencies).  I highly recommend IsoAcoustics stands (ISO-L8R155 would be the model that fits those P5+'s).  I'm currently using their smaller stands on my CEntrance MasterClass 2504's and have heard them demoed on high-end Dynaudio monitors (with one pair on the stands, the other on the desk), and their performance and ability to be tweaked per user is outstanding.  The most annoying part of speaker placement: room acoustics.  Corners are not your friend.  This is especially true with your Magnepans, where one is in a corner and the other isn't.  Corners lead to all sorts of standing waves, which will cause certain frequencies to be unnaturally boosted, and others cut (mainly in the bass region).  With your setup, certain bass and lower mid frequencies are going to sound louder from the left when they shouldn't.  I would consider putting an acoustic panel in this corner of the room, and possibly behind the other speakers as well since they are close to walls (you can find info on room treatment for Magnepans around the internet, but always remember that every room is different, and this will affect each setup individuall).  This is why many people recommend placing a subwoofer in the corner of a room.  It will sound louder, but it will also be muddy and low quality bass.  Corner-loading a subwoofer is a cheap way of getting out of buying a proper sub that can handle the room, and the sound quality will be hampered as a result.  Also, you have your P5+'s horizontal with the tweeters to the inside.  This is fine for that center channel setup of yours, by typically not what you want for a stereo setup.  The reason for this is that treble is directional, and usually, having your tweeters on the outside will create a wider sound field.  This is not always what you want, as it depends on the speakers, but usually, tweeters to the outside is better.  You can find a bit more discussion on the matter here  It's worth experimenting with if you haven't already.  Lastly, for that center channel setup of yours, I would try just placing the speakers aimed straight for you.  It's coming from the center, so I don't see a reason to angle them, especially if the sound of them will cross before reaching your ears (I can't tell if this is happening or not).  I've never seen a curved center channel, even in extremely high-end setups .  This is worth playing with though, and whatever sounds best to you is what you should use :)."
battlestations,39henl,AudioMan612,3,Thu Jun 11 23:52:51 2015 UTC,"It will sound louder, but it will also be muddy and low quality bass.   What is the logic behind the reduction in quality? I understand the worth of corner loading in order to play into 1/8th pi space for increased perceived volume, but I don't understand where the impact on sound quality comes from?"
battlestations,39henl,AudioMan612,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:49:45 2015 UTC,"Because of the standing waves that propagate in corners.  These waves affect the frequency response of what you hear by artificially boosting certain frequencies, while cutting out others.  So what will happen is that your subwoofer will sound louder, but what you hear from it will usually be less accurate and sound kind of ""boomy.""  For something like home theater use, this shouldn't be a big deal (though it's still better to try to get a more accurate frequency response), but it becomes more of an issue when dealing with music.  Here are a few guides and discussions that go into greater detail if you're interested:  http://forum.audiogon.com/cgi-bin/fr.pl?cspkr&1124216584&read&keyw&zzbass+traps  http://forum.blu-ray.com/showthread.php?t=48286  http://www.theabsolutesound.com/articles/a-guide-to-better-bass-tas-197-1/"
battlestations,39henl,ankrotachi10,2,Fri Jun 12 12:57:59 2015 UTC,"Because of the standing waves that propagate in corners.   You will have standing waves wherever in the room you place the sub, simply due to the size of the room. What specifically is it about corners that 'propagates' them?"
battlestations,39henl,ankrotachi10,1 point,Fri Jun 12 13:23:13 2015 UTC,"The pressure of sound waves goes up when those sound waves hit a barrier and their velocity goes to zero. In a corner, you have more of these boundaries.  It's something I still don't 100% understand the physics of, but it's easy to test out with any speaker or subwoofer (as long as the speaker can put out reasonably low frequencies).  The size of the room will affect which frequencies are affected, because that's what determines the resonant frequencies of the room.  These resonant frequencies are often known as ""room modes.""  There are calculators out there to figure out these frequencies for your room.  Here is one of the better ones that I found.  If you want a few more reads that go into the matter, here is a very good one that I found.  This one isn't bad either.  Sorry if I didn't give as good of an explanation as you'd like.  As I said, it's something I don't understand in enormous detail either.  Annoyingly, waves is one of the few things I didn't have covered in any of the physics classes I had to take while in college."

I couldn't remember which side the tweeters were on so it kind of ended up on the back burner, but I will definitely change them around. Thanks for the heads up!   EDIT: Unless you were talking about the AudioEngines, in which case I will do the same! And still thanks for the heads up haha."

battlestations,39henl,DemonMuffins,2,Fri Jun 12 14:51:49 2015 UTC,"Great setup man! Just letting you know that unless that HDTV has a native resolution of 480p that it can display at, you're probably playing smash with input lag. I noticed that in one of your replies you talk about competitive play, so I thought this was important to mention in order to maintain your play at any tournaments you go to. If you're looking to play melee/PM optimally, you're gonna want a regular ol' CRT from your local goodwill/craigslist. HDTVs for the most part have an input lag of about 1 to 2 seconds, or 60-120 frames. Not great for learning the game, practicing, or just going through the motions the day of a big tournament. Good luck! :)"

battlestations,39j0nq,farmerjoe1996,1 point,Fri Jun 12 04:15:45 2015 UTC,"It's pretty decent, but not the fastest. The 8350 is 500 MHz faster than the 8320. I use it mostly for gaming, browsing, and web development."
battlestations,39j0nq,TDuffin,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:37:36 2015 UTC,"I've found mine pretty good in all honesty. It's a bit of a drag if you don't get the right motherboard (AM3+ socket is not enough, you need one that supports the 125W TDP and has the power delivery to support the 8XXX series) as it'll sit at 2.9Ghz all day and slow shit down. At 3.5-4Ghz (boost) it runs superb for gaming.  I've used mine for gaming, with great performance in all games, especially multithreaded ones like BF4. Do be warned that some engines like Unity 4 and Gamebryp do slow down the 8320 a little if there's a lot going on in the game, but I blame that on the engines as much as the CPU. For 3D model rendering I find it decent (though as a noob I don't know what is 'fast' or 'great' at this task), with ~20mins for a 2000 sample (iirc) image at 720p in blender. While it's not CUDA processing, the 8 threads make it a beast in world of CPU rendering.  It gets the job done at a good price, if you're a td;dr kind of guy."

battlestations,39hx9a,PJ7004,3,Thu Jun 11 22:55:39 2015 UTC,"I have mixed feelings.   I was quite used to the curve with the previous setup so at ~20 inches from the screen the edges seem really far and small. Curved screens have, from what I saw, a wider arc than my previous setup.  The main problem with 1080 screens vertical was that most apps / webpages are made for at least 1280px wide.  Now I think I would have been better with 3x 1440p 27"" vertical."

Why did you go all out building a custom desk to put your computer in but then leave your actual computer itself so bland and boring. IMO if you are willing to put the time and effort into building a desk you should put more effort into displaying your masterpiece.  For example, I would have done a full custom loop using rigid tubing and got a pcie riser card so you can lay the GPU flat which would then allow you to shorten the display completely so that way it looks more sleek and less waisted space. And if you don't want to liquid cool it you could still use the riser card to lay the GPU flat and get a sexy CPU cooler.  And just a personal opinion but those monitors are way to high.  EDIT: I highly recommend a mechanical keyboard. It will change your life."

The weight of the monitors does push the bar down at the edges, but there's more than enough adjustment via the hinges and height bolts to get everything aligned and even.   I tried a similar model with hinges in the arms and integrated VESA mounts. It was much more flexible, but indeed, it drooped by about an inch on both outer monitors. No amount of adjustment or tightening could fix it. Drove me crazy."

I think 4K could work on a 32 inch monitor but that would be the minimum.  I am using a 3440x1440 ultrawide monitor right now and I prefer the pixel density on this one.

Often you are referencing several other projects, looking at an older version to see the changes in code, pulling up stackoverflow while looking at your code whilst looking at the output, whilst watching netflix at the same time lol...  As a developer myself, I find 2 screens to be the bare minimum of usable, but even then, barely.  Now, this is talking about maximum efficiency, usually for larger projects.  If I know what I am doing and coding something simple, I can do that on a small 11in ultrabook if I needed to.  But ya, for serious productivity, I need a few more screens.  I personally don't think this setup is something I would use as I like having a couple vertical monitors, but this would still be comfortable to develop on."

Sometimes I'll split it between a web browser and a code window.  3: Right right is for explorer windows and other file structure windows.  Git console / windows console will go here as well usually.  I have tons of folders for our various projects that I never seem to have enough time to work on.  So being able to quickly open files across all the projects is important.  4: Left is for console output and/or matlab, skype, emails.  While not all will be used for coding, it helps being able to multitask while keeping the minimizing of windows to minimum (terrible pun maybe?).  Having a web browser for debugging/stack overflow is pretty much a necessity, as well as having code documentation for whatever you're doing.

battlestations,393ozc,Dinduks,0,Tue Jun 9 13:34:27 2015 UTC,"Depending on what you're developing, I don't think 4 screens is unreasonable:   One for code. One for documentation. One for version control, unit testing, command line, database management[, possibly also software specification, email, chat, music player].   That's 3 monitors already, and the 3rd can arguably get very crowded already. Depending on what you're developing, you could easily fill up 1 or 2 more monitors.   For app development, you may want to simulate different OS versions and resolutions (e.g. running an iOS simulator for iPad iOS 7, iPhone iOS 7, iPad iOS 8, iPhone iOS 8, etc.). For frontend website development, you may want to run different browsers (preferably at high resolution), and also some simulators for tablets and smartphones). For desktop applications, you may need a few VMs again for testing on different operating systems.   Yes, you could tab between all your stuff, but that takes time. If you're just trying to get something to look right when doing frontend development, a lot of the time you won't even have to move the focus away from your editor, so you definitely wouldn't want to have to tab to the different browser windows either.  Sometimes, you may be working on two files (or even more) at once on one monitor—that is not uncommon at all—and then you're suddenly in doubt about how a certain API works, so you may have to look up that code, too. Yes, you could put that on your documentation screen or whatever, but then you'd end up having to tab back and forth between those windows, too.  Claming that n amount of monitors is enough for anybody is stupid, unless you have mastered the perfect, optimal workflow for all applications and all people. Pro tip: You haven't."
battlestations,393ozc,wanze,0,Tue Jun 9 11:02:44 2015 UTC,"Claming that n amount of monitors is enough for anybody is stupid, unless you have mastered the perfect, optimal workflow for all applications and all people. Pro tip: You haven't.   I started my comment by ""I believe each his preferences"", and I stated my opinion by using ""I think"", which as far as I know means it is my personal opinion. Nowhere I said that ""n amount of monitors is enough for anybody"", and I'd never say that because I know how annoying these comments are (I'm the kind of guy who plays on a 120hz screen and needs the biggest storage possible on a phone for music). So, stick your passive aggressive life lessons up your ass and go try to be smart elsewhere.  That been said, the fact that I respect others' preferences, doesn't prevent me to have my opinion about this topic, which is (again): with a half-decent window management it is very possible to have an optimal workflow with using more than 3 screens. And this workflow wouldn't involve:     Wasting desk space Spending a lot of money Spending time moving your cursor around (if you're not a keyboard-only person) Moving your head too much   I experienced the last two points with two 27"" Apple Cinema Display screens and it was a pain in the ass.  This workflow would involve using multiple virtual desktops, using a tiling window manager or a software such as Divvy (windows shouldn't overlap), and being comfortable with using a keyboard to quickly switch between desktops (which becomes second nature after few days of use).  Again, it is my opinion only and I believe everyone has the right to do whatever the hell pleases them with their life (and money)."
battlestations,393ozc,Dinduks,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:57:55 2015 UTC,"You said ""I believe each his preferences, but"" as in ""Regardless of preference, I think 4 screen is too much"". And yes, that was your opinion. Opinions can be factually wrong and I was telling you why yours was. I was telling you why 3 monitors isn't enough for everybody. If that is not what you meant, maybe you should have been more precise. You could have said ""More than 3 monitors is way too much for me"" if that's what you meant. That's on you. It has nothing to do with me being passive aggressive.  If you get neck pain from turning your head too much, you may be sitting too close to the monitors.  Switching between virtual desktop causes you to lose focus and having to refind focus. The fact that you mention Divvy and Apple Cinema Display suggests that you're talking about OS X, in which case OS X also has an incredibly annoying desktop-switching animation (that you can't turn off), meaning you have to spend about a second every time you want to look at something else.  Sometimes, you want to start a test and keep writing code, then just glance up to see if you get all green bars in your unit tests. Or you want to have 2 monitors, with whatever you are working on (either 2 browsers or two dvice simulators) that you look at simultaneously. The idea is you wouldn't want to have to tab to these windows. Even tabbing to one window can be bother some. Having to tab to both windows even time you make a small tweak would be incredibly annoying. I get frustrated from just working without tools that automatically update the browser when I make changes, because I have to tab to the browser and do CMD+R.  In regards to money in this sub in particular, people tend to waste their money on other stuff anyway by spending $100 extra on a slightly faster SSD or on RAM with better timings whose only real performance gain is in the 0.5s increase in boot time–the rest is just for getting prettier benchmarking results.

Also, we can't talk about this being factually wrongs as there's no facts in this shit, it's all about personal preferences. Looks to me you're just inventing stuff and wanna argue over nothing. There's no hidden meaning in what I said.   If you get neck pain from turning your head too much, you may be sitting too close to the monitors.   I personally don't have neck pain, it's just annoying and slow moving my head from the edge of screen 1 to the other edge of screen 2.

The fact that you mention Divvy and Apple Cinema Display suggests that you're talking about OS X, in which case OS X also has an incredibly annoying desktop-switching animation (that you can't turn off), meaning you have to spend about a second every time you want to look at something else.   I use TotalSpace2 to have persistent workspaces, assign an app to a specific workspace, to have multi-row workspaces, and to be able to easily see the content of my workspaces. TotalSpaces2 allow to disable the transition animation, which means I don't have to wait and thus won't lose focus. And it's faster than moving my eyes/head to the other screen.

Incrementally increase the multiplier, then test with prime95 or IBT. Increase the vcore when needed. Keep the load temps below 65-70C and your vcore below 1.35V."

battlestations,3941f4,spinningtardis,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:49:44 2015 UTC,"Thermaltake Chaser A71.  I can't say enough good things about it.  Excellent cable-management (though I only did the bare minimum for good airflow, it ain't pretty).  The hard drive dock is very useful.  Plenty of room in the case.  I really feel like this case has flown under the radar.  The price:features ratio is fantastic.  Only downside would be if you don't want such a large case and that the stock fans that come with it are kind of weak.  Quiet, but weak.  But replacing stock fans and adding a fan controller is pretty standard these days.  Here's the review that sold me on it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShfpSMr6oII  It's in Thai, so I didn't understand a word of it.

They don't need a huge amount of desk space.  I just want to be able to have multiple projects set up at the same time, and have space to set stuff down besides the couch or floor.  Basically this."

battlestations,3955hw,CommanderArcher,2,Wed Jun 10 07:44:10 2015 UTC,"I don't hate the people I hate the job. It's dated and often part of a scam, at least where I'm from. And it's really annoying, what right do you have to call my phone and advertise? It's my phone, and I pay the bill, so why are you allowed to call me if I don't want you to?"
battlestations,3955hw,kerberosv2,-6,Wed Jun 10 07:57:41 2015 UTC,"It's not dated. This is 2015, how do you prefer advertising? Via your mailbox? You have a phone and your number is public, so you are announcing to the world how to contact you, no one has the right to allow or not allow me to call you, but yourself. There are ways to do that.  The best way to avoid it is just to say 'no thanks, I'm not interested' same way you would flip the channel if an ad on tv didn't catch your interest.  I have worked some con jobs, sure. I've made it a principle now though to only take on business to business sales. Honestly if you run a business you should be thrilled to get calls.   What bothers me about the telemarketing hate is that it's largely unwarranted. For example, the job I'm doing from the station in the picture is just opinion and market research, I often call lists of people who would have a genuine interest in expressing their opinions, either because it's about a brand they consume, or because it's about current political affairs everyone should care about.  I still get told to fuck off, drown myself in the toilet, get a real job..that's OK though because I'm a 'telemarketer'..I bet they would be real excited if their grandma called.."

I would highly recommend the made for TV movie that portrays both Steve Jobs and Bill Gates on their respective sojourns through life. My personal opinion of Jobs is part Bill Burr's approximation, that he's heralded as some sort of nerd Jesus when in reality he wasn't personally slaving away all night over a motherboard or program and other part is that he was a visionary with incredible drive and perseverance but just that. Not some paradigm shifting colossus of a industry figure. But mostly due to the fact that the movie ""Jobs"" is just so unenjoyable and comes off as flat and trite."

battlestations,38wsdl,ninjamuffin,34,Sun Jun 7 17:02:58 2015 UTC,I live near a Micro Center so I got them at a very good price. I bought my motherboard and 3570k there 2 year ago for around 250-300 I think. The case Corsair Air 240 was 50 after rebate at newegg. The GTX 970 was a Micro Center price mistake for $145 and they honor it. Pretty much everything else I got them on sale from Newegg. Estimated for the build is around $550-650. The speakers are the legendary 20 year old Realistic Minimus 7 from Craigslist for $20 and Lepai amp is $25 on Amazon. Keyboard is refurbished from meritline for $70 and G600 is $30 after newegg Mail in rebate. I accumulate parts through sale over the years so it ended pretty cheap.

battlestations,38wsdl,dexter130,3,Sun Jun 7 18:56:01 2015 UTC,"I use my hackintosh for writing/producing music in Logic (which is OSX only), and game on W7. Photoshop I can use either OS, but I find working in OSX a little more fluid for some reason. My OS drive is actually only a 64GB SSD (build is about 3 years old) that's just partitioned in half (technically there's three partitions, because the bootloader has it's own tiny partition), and all my other stuff like files, games, sound libraries etc are on secondary (and tertiary ... and quaternary) HDs so there's no issues with drive formats (FAT, NTFS, HFS+, etc) and things can be backup up easily.   Updating Windows is effortless, of course, and updating OSX is usually easy. I recently upgraded to Yosemite, and while I did have to tweak a few things, it's running fine now. It's weird, if you build a hackintosh you actually have to set what kind of Mac it's pretending to be, and it makes a difference on how the CPU performs. Like, if I had it set to tell OSX Yosemite that it was a 2007 iMac, it wouldn't run as well as if I told it it was a 2012 Mac Pro. I never update my Nvidia drivers on OSX, since I don't use OSX for games, and my sound card is also external, so no problems.   All in all, I'm very happy with it. And setup really wasn't too bad when I built it in 2012. Yeah, I had to pick specific parts, but I never felt restricted by it. I wanted parts that would last me a while, so I went with an Intel i7 3770k CPU, which literally was only a few months old from release. And I got a GTX 660ti, which has been just wonderful.   Longer post than I intended..."

battlestations,38wsdl,SIBERIAN_DICK_WOLF,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:49:57 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say building a Hackintosh is a big process, it's only a couple extra steps beyond building any other PC. If you know how to build a PC, chances are you're already familiar with how to partition and format a hard drive. Beyond that, you just need some custom firmware to make the hardware work on OSX, and honestly that's becoming a thing of the past as more and more current computer hardware is becoming out-of-the-box ready for both OSs (my motherboard was already universal). Back in 2012, all you needed was a copy of OSX straight from the app store, a single file from tonymacx86.com, and a USB drive. The tonymac files would put the OSX install files on the USB drive, and alter them to include all the custom firmware and ""hacks"" that you need to get things running. The USB would boot up from the BIOS, and install OSX on the new partition you made. For me, it was enjoyable and an opportunity to learn stuff. The first PC I ever built was my Hackintosh.   Anyway, I'm not going to try and convince people to use one audio DAW over another, or one OS over another. I've used both Mac and PC since I was 5. So the common mentality that I see of Windows being the ""default"" choice over OSX (""why not just use Windows?"") just never applied to me.   I've used Logic since 2005, and using OSX and Logic is simply more conducive to my workflow. I use a different program for notation (Finale, though I may switch to Sibelius), and I have it set up to wire the MIDI playback out of Finale and through Logic, so I can hear playback in real time using my sound libraries. In OSX, rewiring MIDI playback is simply a pre-built-in feature (the IAC driver), so it's much easier to accomplish than in Windows, at least in my experience. And beyond that, navigation through folders and files and managing multiple open windows and programs is easier with OSXs ""hot corners"" (mission control ftw). Maybe W10 will catch up with the ease of use and functionality that OSX has, but I'm not really interested in learning an entirely foreign software suite just so I can still use an OS I'm not really partial to either way.

battlestations,38wsdl,Philementalist,1 point,Sun Jun 7 16:09:37 2015 UTC,Yosemite is very good at DPI scaling so you won't notice any difference compared to 1440p monitor. It makes text look sharper since the monitor has higher DPI than regular 1440p.
battlestations,38wsdl,drpepper_is_the_best,0,Sun Jun 7 16:11:27 2015 UTC,"I find scaling on my 28"" 4k screen to make things unsharp. Except for 1080p scaling, but that's a stupid thing to do."
battlestations,38wsdl,vN_GreeD,7,Sun Jun 7 16:17:15 2015 UTC,"He's DPI scaling, not choosing another resolution, there's a difference."
battlestations,38wsdl,Philementalist,2,Sun Jun 7 16:28:28 2015 UTC,"I know. Choosing the option that looks like 1440p looks unsharp because the actual amount of pixels representing the scaled pixel isn't a whole number. Where as with 1080p each scaled pixel is 4 actual pixels, thus making it very, very sharp."
battlestations,38wsdl,xDialtone,3,Sun Jun 7 19:28:20 2015 UTC,Yo I see you using that Magic Trackpad and I was wondering what bluetooth solution you're using? Are you just using the official OSXwifi adaptors with the Broadcom chipset adapted to pci-e?
battlestations,38wsdl,vN_GreeD,2,Mon Jun 8 15:50:11 2015 UTC,It's the iogear 4.0 usb bluetooth adapter. You can look it up on amazon. I used wired but for wifi you can use rosewill pcen900 (works out of the box)

battlestations,38x19y,Balogne,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:33:05 2015 UTC,Nope
battlestations,38x19y,MySpl33n,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:02:28 2015 UTC,"The fastest Dial-up modem was 56kbps. ""56kb"" is not a measure of speed - that was the joke.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial-up_Internet_access  v.90 allowed up to 56kbps of bandwidth, this could be expanded with compression, but compression was unreliable at best (almost everything on the modern internet, apart from HTML/CSS code is compressed - eg. images, video, data files, etc. - compressing compressed data sometimes yielded a larger set of data to be transmitted, resulting in a negative compression ratio).  Therefore, it would be near impossible to attain, or maintain 150kbps speeds on dial-up.  All forms of DSL are considered ""broad band"", though many equate them to a form a ""dial up"" since almost all DSL providers require you to engage some form of PPPoE authentication.  On windows systems this process leverages the ""dial-up networking"" dialogs and subroutines to generate prompts and basic functionality, but the underlying technology is still a broadband technology.  DSL as ""dial-up"" is a misnomer.  The fastest dial-up networking speed was 56k, and only in very ideal conditions. Often this was reduced to 53kbps, simply due to the quality of phone lines, which was often not as good as they could have been, or should have been."

battlestations,38x19y,fuqd,0,Mon Jun 8 04:42:55 2015 UTC,"Really?   It looks extremely non-functional to me. For starters, 3 of the 4 monitors are basically resting flat on the tabletop which is a really poor placement for them ergonomically and in terms of seeing content on the screens without having to constantly move your head. Only the top monitor is placed an any kind of reasonable ergonomic position and even at that it looks like it's far too high up. Additionally, that one is partially blocked (i.e. in the bottom left and right corners) by the other monitors.   Which makes me wonder which of these monitors is the primary/home screen and how you interact with the taskbar. If it's on the only screen placed reasonably ergonomically (which it should be) then you can't see any of the important content in the bottom left or right of your home screen (e.g. start menu, time, notification, etc). If it's on any of the other screens then you will be constantly tilting your head down to see what's going on.  Basically, the sweet-spot where most of your content should be on a computer is just full of bezel and every monitor is either too high, too low or too far to the left/right to be your primary monitor."
battlestations,38x19y,TootinOnAFlizoot,2,Mon Jun 8 07:16:38 2015 UTC,"I said it looks functional because I have 4 screen setup too, but unlike OP, I have placed them horizontally. That makes one pretty wide setup, 180 cm. Not very ergonomic width to be honest, but that's the best I can do for now.  However we can't possibly know how OP uses them and how he takes care of his ergonomics. You have a point though."

battlestations,38w1w6,jack-dawed,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:50:29 2015 UTC,"but there's nowhere around me I've found a DXracer I can actually sit on.   That's the biggest problem with them so far, IMO, combined with the return policy.  I ordered a 'R-Series' at first and it was way too skinny for me (Despite being 160lbs, but I'm a bit broader than average), I also tend to put my feet up on the cushion (Whether sitting cross legged, indian style, or just sitting on one leg) and the chair was not well suited for that at all because of the metal bars on the sides of the cushions that stuck up an extra two inches.   This is where I'd normally say I 'returned' the old one, but shipping was looking to be 100$, and they informed me of a potential 20% restocking fee. So potentially 140$ lost just because I didn't like that model. Eventually went to craigslist instead, practically still new-in-box.   Decided to get this one which was a lot better for me in terms of comfort, and it was also a step-up in terms of build quality from the r-series (Metal base and much larger, locking casters, and the ability to 'lock' the seat in the reclined position). With this chair, I honestly don't think I've found a single complaint yet.  I'm like you, couldn't really justify 800$+ on a chair (Despite sitting in it for 6+ hours a day) but still wanted something better than what OfficeMax could offer. I think DXRacer fits that need very fell, but I also think they need some floorspace somewhere, as their return policy and shipping costs suck big time."

At LANs there sometimes isn't enough keyboard space for all the players to have their keyboards horizontal, so they angle them to allow for more space.

battlestations,38xbwm,Yemia,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:29:25 2015 UTC,what kind of switches do you have and do you use the keyboard for gaming? I LOVE the look of 60% and tenkeyless keyboards and I also love the noise of Cherry MX Blue switches but I'm not sure what I should get for gaming.   I hear brown is best of both worlds as far as clickyness and gaming goes.
battlestations,38xbwm,Yemia,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:47:01 2015 UTC,"My Poker II has reds, and the K70 you see there has browns. I have tried blues elsewhere, and am getting a keyboard with them soon.  As you say, the noise on blue is nice, but in my opinion it is definitely not for gaming. Especially if you often Skype/call friends whilst gaming, the sound can be a lot more annoying on the other end.  Reds are thought of as ""gaming switches"" and definitely feel very different to browns, but I actually like gaming on both. I use the Poker II more for gaming due to its small size, and mainly the K70 for typing. But I do use both for gaming, and if you are getting just a single keyboard, I would say browns are the best of the three. They are nice to game on and nice to type on, whereas reds aren't that nice to type on.  I hear people swear by clears though, so that may be worth looking into, but I get the impression they are much better for typing and less so for gaming. I actually have 2 keyboards coming, one with blues and one with clears, but for now browns defo get my recommendation for a best of both :)"

If you are intending to buy one, make sure you measure yourself properly first, and buy the correct chair. The diagonal flairs on the side add to the comfort as they are pretty much exactly positioned for my shoulder width, but make sure that your shoulders aren't too wide for them!   My only problem with this chair is that the arm rests don't tilt forwards/backwards. They turn on the top, and go up and down, but don't tilt forward/backwards. I think this is different on other models though.  Also, watch out for the height - I had quite a high desk when I got it and could only have the chair on the highest height to sit at my desk - the chair doesn't go especially high. I have since got a new desk and it isn't a problem. Make sure you check the dimensions on the site before you buy.  Feel free to ask if you have more questions about it :)"

I prefer AMD because the nVidia driver doesn't support >4 monitors, while the AMD supports 6, and because the proprietary nVidia driver never fully worked for me.  both the open and closed AMD ones were mostly fine for me (the catalyst one had a small issue with my WM, so i switched over to the open source one).    if you don't have an AMD card with 6 ports (few do), you can use an MST hub.    if you get prety much any new card, you'll be fine.  i know AMD works fine all the way back to the 6000 series, but I don't have any multi-monitor experience with nVidia older than the 700 series."

battlestations,38ubis,pablosu,7,Sat Jun 6 22:02:22 2015 UTC,"If you still can I would recommend getting a different SSD. The 840 Evo has the infamous performance degradation, meaning that the older the data on it the slower it will be read (speeds of my own 840 Evo - left side before performance restoration, right after http://i.imgur.com/ulFyXJQ.jpg ). There IS a fix for this included in the latest firmware update and Samsung Magician but the catch is that it increases the workload a lot (since the old data is rewritten periodically).  There should be no decrease in speeds of older data now, but it will reach its write cycle limit much sooner (read here for more detailed information and all the pros and cons of the supposed ""fix"" from Samsung -> http://www.anandtech.com/show/9196/samsung-releases-second-840-evo-fix ).  Just a FYI. The 850 Evo and 840/850 Pro are not affected by the performance degradation (they have a different kind of NAND).  Edit: oh yeah, and get rid of the V300 too, they are hella slow (http://www.anandtech.com/show/7763/an-update-to-kingston-ssdnow-v300-a-switch-to-slower-micron-nand). Same goes for the 3TB Seagate drives, they don't tend to last long (https://www.backblaze.com/blog/3tb-hard-drive-failure/). I can recommend the HGST Deskstar 7K3000, I have one of them myself and it works flawlessly. If you want Seagate just avoid the 3TB ones, the rest should be better."
battlestations,38ubis,QwarkDreams,2,Sat Jun 6 22:21:51 2015 UTC,thanks for all the info man! I really appreciate it! Whats your opinion about 2 x 850 EVO in RAID 0?
battlestations,38ubis,QwarkDreams,2,Sat Jun 6 22:42:08 2015 UTC,"Never did RAID (was always too lazy to set it up or didn't ahve matching drives or didn't want the hassle of restoring data if one of the drives dies in RAID 0 - since both drives only hold half of the total data, like drive a: 1-3-5-7, drive b: 2-4-6-8). Most SSDs provide sufficient speeds for games and programs. RAID 0 could be useful for loading big projects in Photoshop or Premiere. There are even people (with a LOT more knowledge and understanding of the topic than I have) pointing out that RAID might be obsolete ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAuEgepZG_8= )  You could go for a m.2 SSD or PCI-e SSD but since you're using 2 GPUs in SLI I'm not sure if you have enough PCI-e lanes left. Asking in a forum or a subreddit here (/r/hardware for example) should solve this question.  Other than that, I personally would just go for 2x 850 Pro without RAID (one for OS and important/often used programs, one for games) or 1x 850 Pro and 1x 512GB or 1TB SSD that's cheaper than a 850 Pro. If I had the money^ In reality I will stick with my 840 Evo (OS and drivers only) until Samsung Magician changes from ""Drive Health Status: Good"" to something different and only swap it out then. It's not like I don't have a M550 256GB laying around but I'm too lazy to reinstall everything (this one will end up in my laptop since the performance boost would benefit me there more)."

battlestations,38ubis,QwarkDreams,1 point,Sun Jun 7 01:07:46 2015 UTC,"Actually not that much to do. Making sure the RAM runs at the proper speeds/timings, checking the idle/load temps (GPU + CPU), cablemanagement almost doesn't matter in this case. Maybe some better case fans (I have a Corsair case myself, the fans aren't bad but there are certainly better and you wanted to improve ;) if the temps are fine then just save the money ).  Did you make sure that the overclocks are stable?"
battlestations,38ubis,dorekk,1 point,Sun Jun 7 02:41:24 2015 UTC,What about faster ram? or 32GB of RAM?
battlestations,38ubis,QwarkDreams,1 point,Sun Jun 7 08:11:31 2015 UTC,"What MHz does it have? I'm asking because your photos don't match the RAM model you wrote in the part list (Vengeance in the pictures, XMS3 in the list)  If you have 16GB you should be fine for a while (8GB is the maximum games now require). If you can't use it it's wasted money (unless you're running one/several VMs, are coding or video editing, those activities profit from more RAM). I personally never had the problem of having not enough RAM when gaming and I only have 8GB (then again, I don't have a very beefy PC do begin with, so the settings in games aren't as demanding as yours might be).  The speeds don't really matter (exception: APUs). 1600MHz CL9 is pretty standard now, everything above is a bonus but not necessary unless you want to pay much more for 2-4fps more. CPUs and GPUs show bigger differences in performance (like GTX 970 vs GTX 980, or i3-4130 vs i5-4690K). Stick with it for now. Your next upgrade will most likely include DDR4."

The HyperX 3K is listed with a multitude of what the other two SSDs can endure, but still not even close to 2petabytes.

battlestations,38ubis,PyroFuzion,1 point,Thu Jun 11 14:59:35 2015 UTC,"The thing is that due to the performance degradation tool the data on the 840 Evo gets rewritten periodically so it stays ""fresh"" which takes up ~30% of its total TBW.

I noticed the bottom right side of your desk where your tower is located looks like it's parallel with the lower section on the left. Does this create any issues when you're sitting up against your desk? It seems like you would have to sit in at an angle.

Buy a shelf from Ikea, mount it on the wall, put what I assume is a receiver on that. Mount the router to the wall with scrws under the desk or above the desk (above the laptop). The laptop can be moved, I can't comment on that. The second PC is something I don't understand, if it's not in use it seems like you're wasting a perfectly good footrest.   Now the whole side of your desk is cleared off, it's not that hard, I had to do the same thing and since doing it I have so much more space."

Nothing comes close right now for gaming, but they do have their issues.   If you are fine with the $800 price tag, hold off for a few months.

From my own experience, it's pretty solid. It peaks a little too much to be used in an even semi professional environment, something apparently corrected in the 2i4.  The DAC portion works flawlessly, in that it cuts all white noise, and rocks the house when cranked up. XLR inputs are nice as they have an LED indicator when your levels are too high, and the gain change is actually noticeable, whereas there is a significant deadzone with the audio output knob. Direct monitor is nice, not something that is particularly common.   Honestly, it's great for the price. Just don't expect a miracle."

battlestations,38o827,iDontKnowMyself,2,Fri Jun 5 15:53:27 2015 UTC,"aw yiss!  lol true. the main reason i got the steelseries rival is because of its simplicity and ease of use, while being a pro gaming mouse and being extremely ergonomic and comfy on the hand.  also, the keyboard in my opinion is the best looking, feeling and all round cherry mx blue keyboard for my price bracket.  my advice on your battlestation would be to improve cable management and clean the dust. seriously. i can see basically all of your cables. since the cables coming out of your monitors have to go down under the desk where the power plug is, you can only route them down, but the thing is that you can improve this. use something, for example a Velcro strap or maybe a zip tie to tie the monitor cables directly in a straight line down that black stand. the black cables will blend in with that black straight stand as long as you use something tight to tie the cables right behind it.  for the keyboard, mouse and mic cables, i don't know much on what to do to them other than making a single small whole in the desk around that area of them and directing the cables down there, which will completely clear out those cables and make it look cleaner. another option is that you could use some sort of tie to tie those cables together multiple times so it is straight and direct them where the monitor cables are going. this would make cleaner, and make it seem as if there only one cable going into one area.  also, just clean all the dust from your battlestation."

As much as people like to hate intel and nvidia, it doesn't mean you run out and waste your money on worse parts. I saw in your other comment that you were upset about the 970 vram issue, but I am willing to bet that you don't fully understand what actually happened, and that you only went by the comments saying ""Ugh, I am never supporting these companies again!"" Don't get me wrong, the 295x2 is a great card, but the drivers for crossfire can be a mess, especially for new games. Overall, I just don't understand the ""pride"" people have for having an all AMD build, as if it's the noble or moral thing to do.

battlestations,38mhd1,The_Basic_Swede,1 point,Fri Jun 5 10:32:21 2015 UTC,I don't use nvidia surround I just use the middle benq (2420z) as the main and use the rest for multitasking proposes only since the middle monitor is 144hz it downscales to 60 hz if I surround it so I never do.
battlestations,38mhd1,stormer14789,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:09:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I ask. I have 2 monitors and I want to use one for game and the other for other purposes. But if I want to do it the game should be ran in windowed mode, which is a huge FPS killer. Do you run it in windowed mode, or do you run it fullscreen mode (when you switch from the game the game is minimized) ?"

The build quality is good and they look cool but I don't think they are worth the price. I now have a corsair m95 and I love it. It takes a little getting used to and requires more of a palm grip than a claw grip but it's much more comfortable. The pads on the bottom last longer because they are far bigger and it slides smoother because of that. I've never had a problem with it

I've seen way too many horror stories of those desks shattering under too much pressure. I'd recommend a properly sized piece of wood under the computer just to elevate it. I would also look into seeing if you could move your computer under the desk next to the subwoofer and under the monitor with the window facing the subwoofer. It would be easier to manage cables and would look a lot nicer. You might have to move the desk a bit for that which may cause a rather large gap in-between the wall and your desk.

But with these small monitors it's as I describe below, just thin metal bracket on the inside of the back cover.  So I took the back cover off, took some measurements, drilled some holes, then attached the metal bracket from the broken monitor, and threaded the mount to the back cover and re-attached. The only tricky part was getting the back cover off. On that monitor you have to remove the little rubber pads on the bottom, revealing some tabs to release the back cover."

battlestations,38ibed,PyroFuzion,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:10:26 2015 UTC,So nice! I love the way of your desk I wouldn't change it too. And sorry for your granddad...
battlestations,38ibed,Artbreeze,1 point,Thu Jun 4 12:58:41 2015 UTC,"Nice setup. What desk is that, I'm looking a new one?"
battlestations,38ibed,DasIstNichSantiClaus,1 point,Thu Jun 4 16:53:45 2015 UTC,It's actually a part of a bedroom suite.

battlestations,38fm9s,CMDR_Albert_Hofmann,8,Wed Jun 3 22:04:26 2015 UTC,Hope I'm doing this right...
battlestations,38fm9s,concretednut,7,Wed Jun 3 22:05:51 2015 UTC,"Yessir, I'm running SLI 970s in a 350D and curious what temps you idle/max with the 800D."
battlestations,38fm9s,concretednut,3,Wed Jun 3 22:58:36 2015 UTC,"You know, thats a good question. Idle is around 38-45C (depending on what card you're looking at)... however Ive not really kept an eye on temps while gaming as I dont OC the cards."
battlestations,38fm9s,SWaller89,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:20:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I get with mine stacked on each other at idle, trying to figure out how much difference it makes (doesn't seem too terrible right now)"
battlestations,38fm9s,Zombinxy,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:12:10 2015 UTC,"Also to be fair, the 800D sucks for air cooling things."

battlestations,38fm9s,rickman1011,3,Thu Jun 4 01:02:14 2015 UTC,"Dude, is there an electric nail back there??  If so, how do you like it?  Having to have a fuckin' huge torch around isn't that easy to get away with; the wife would not be alright with that."
battlestations,38fm9s,rickman1011,3,Thu Jun 4 02:00:24 2015 UTC,Yup. D-Nail 2.0. Best purchase I've ever made in that area. I'll never use a torch again unless the power goes out! You just can't beat the convenience and consistency of the heating element. No more guessing or measuring temps or wasting oil via too hot or too low of a temperature.

battlestations,38fm9s,Hay_Lobos,5,Wed Jun 3 23:41:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I appreciate that! I did have two of these monitors at one point, but as you can imagine, having that bezel in the middle sucks a fat one."
battlestations,38fm9s,TheGoodBanana,2,Thu Jun 4 00:19:21 2015 UTC,"I could imagine the curvature might be a little bit of a limiting factor with two as well, I'm lazy and tend not to want to turn my head.   But yeah that bezel right in center of vision must be frustrating to all hell."
battlestations,38fm9s,Dr-Banner,7,Thu Jun 4 00:33:13 2015 UTC,"The curve wasn't really too much of an issue. Besides I naturally turn my head when I play due to the head tracking device.

battlestations,38fm9s,Simonateher,3,Thu Jun 4 06:47:12 2015 UTC,Nice rig! I want to get some footpedals but I'm afraid on carpet that they will slide. How are they working for you?
battlestations,38fm9s,Simonateher,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:58:45 2015 UTC,"They are rigged up to the stand, so it goes NOWHERE. Of course the pedals themselves are rather hefty AND come with retractable carpet spikes. I would think hard flooring would be a bigger issue."
battlestations,38fm9s,stray1ight,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:18:39 2015 UTC,"Hardwood floors definitely slide.  It's a real pain.  I've got a quick question about the stand.  Is there a way to mount the stick down a bit (as in a real car), or could it be easily modified/fabricate something to achieve that?"
battlestations,38fm9s,stray1ight,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:30:23 2015 UTC,"You can adjust the height and angle of the center pole, as it telescopes. You can also change the angle of the baseplate that the wheel and shifter are attached to. So to answer your question, yes you can change that up in a matter of seconds. No tools required."
battlestations,38fm9s,wrongel,3,Thu Jun 4 02:09:09 2015 UTC,"Pussy. I see you weren't man enough to get the Das 4 Ultimate.   Nice setup. Hows the wheel and pedal rig? I've been looking into one, but it looks like it would feel a bit unstable when whipping the wheel around."
battlestations,38fm9s,Everestark,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:31:38 2015 UTC,"I actually had a DasUltimate before I upgraded to the 4. At the wife's request I had to opt for the lettered keys and quieter switches. Heh. Edit: Thats a lie, the switches were at the request of my Team Speak friends ;)  As for the stand, I've yet to have it destabilize itself even with the FFS set to maximum."

The GF offered to pay 'any amount of money' for me to get a replacement for my CM Quickfire with MX Browns, and this is after I installed o-rings :(  Anyone else feel like the rebound is louder than the downstroke on these keys?"
battlestations,38fm9s,Syliss1,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:41:40 2015 UTC,"Hahah, I feel your pain. I've not noticed that about the up/down-stroke noises but I'll check that out and let you know."
battlestations,38fm9s,Syliss1,1 point,Thu Jun 4 15:14:57 2015 UTC,"Nice, thanks for the replies.  Damn my TS friends, Das 4 Ultimate and blues all day. Although, the browns seem very appealing. What switches are in your ultimate?"
battlestations,38fm9s,CerealOffender,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:55:01 2015 UTC,"Oh, I went with the MX Browns. I honestly dont miss the added noise as these offer plenty of auditory as well as tactile feedback. Plus it keeps others happy as they can no longer hear it over TS or in the other room(s).   Also, remember with that stand... its all steel so its already pretty hefty. Then you strap the pedal set to it which adds like another 10-15bs to the base. Its not super easy to get it to tip at that point."
battlestations,38fm9s,4lteredBeast,2,Thu Jun 4 00:56:46 2015 UTC,"The browns definitely do seem appealing. I had the pleasure of trying them out not too long ago, and I must say its nice. These 80db keystrokes are getting a bit old."
battlestations,38fm9s,henjebenje,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:58:21 2015 UTC,You can reduce the noisegate pretty easily in TS by the way :) I did the same thing and now my friends can't hear my MX blues

battlestations,38ix6f,leonffs,2,Thu Jun 4 16:29:58 2015 UTC,Not to be that guy but unless your head is at keyboard height you should raise those sonys up or at least angle them. This is assuming you're using them for monitoring or for hi fi
battlestations,38ix6f,leonffs,1 point,Thu Jun 4 21:49:22 2015 UTC,"Yes, I don't have mounts for them yet, might make some in the future. They're not for monitoring or Hi-fi though anyway, they are just some cheap speakers that were given to me."

battlestations,38kjcd,DMRG7326,2,Fri Jun 5 00:48:29 2015 UTC,I've heard that they're probably implementing a new naming scheme. GTX 1080 would be problematic when they're targeting 1440p and 4k

battlestations,38h6ej,meggerman,1 point,Thu Jun 4 04:55:04 2015 UTC,"The thing is you appreciate it more. Just having a loan to buy that stuff means so much less, because in most cases your not experienced enough to appreciate how crippling debt is over the long haul or if it was given (parents, scrounging), you lose out on the whole effort reward factor.  not hating on loans as such but PC battlestations are kind of fringe to most other things people have going on in their lives.  very nice btw  @zackfool :)"
battlestations,38h6ej,RaptorF22,1 point,Fri Jun 5 13:56:18 2015 UTC,"Back when I had to live in shitty little apartments, I went from having a pc to a laptop. It made more sense given the space. Since I had to buy the thing outright, I would usually use billmelater and get a 1200-1400 dollar laptop and make small payments for a while until it was paid off. Pretty simple stuff. I can't really fault people for using loans to build a machine, but since it comes in parts, it's really much easier to just piece it together slowly."

There's a switch allowing you to change the bass and vibration level. If you've ever tried Skullcrushers, the max level is like that. It's a lot of fun. It has a feature called Blast Source Identifier in which the corresponding  cup will actually vibrate in response to say, an explosion. It goes beyond your average gaming headphones with features that are actually fun.   A bit on the heavy side, but it's so cool looking you won't care. Very comfortable besides.

battlestations,387dht,_Jezza,3,Tue Jun 2 15:22:04 2015 UTC,Are you talking about other higher end i5's or including i7 and i7 extreme processors; because both the i7 and i7-extreme line up can be quite useful for heavily multi-threaded loads; plus to add on to that the 4690k has the quite big advantage of being multiplier unlocked.
battlestations,387dht,DigitalFruitcake,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:42:58 2015 UTC,"The other i5s. A heavily OC'd 4690K is better, sure, but is it worth the extra cost versus putting the money into a GPU when the i5 4440 or 4460 are almost as awesome for gaming and usually more than enough speed?"
battlestations,387dht,_Jezza,2,Wed Jun 3 11:37:03 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you are doing; if just gaming then yes, but there are loads that would benefit more from a better CPU than GPU."

I have a 55in in my living room, and a 130in project in my basement but now that i'm building something to specifically be a simulator, I like the idea of one focus monitor and two peripheral side views.

battlestations,388icv,vonsmor,2,Wed Jun 3 03:46:45 2015 UTC,"I had the DK1 and it was fun for a couple weeks but ended up hating it.  I think the poor resolution and lack of any support when it first launched turned me off.  The lens pretty much had to touch my eyeballs or else it looked like binoculars.  I hope the consumer version continues with the $300 price point and addresses all those issues, because I love the idea of it.  Lunar Flight was my shit, I highly recommend it if you are looking for something to do with your rift.  edit: yes I know it was a developer kit, and I shouldn't bitch about lack of support, but I bought it for fun and that's what turned me off about it.

First you've got EVERYTHING crammed into a corner, but it looks like you have some room to be creative in that corner.  That TV could be mounted on the wall and the two laptops could be moved so they fit below it.  Now, I'd recommend getting a decent stand for the Macbook Pro if you're planning on keeping it for awhile or use it regularly, since it brings the screen up to eye level and reduces neck strain.  PC wise, head on over to /r/buildapc and /r/buildapcsales in order to help get some decent parts.  I'm Ok at building PC's, but they're the pros.  Also, hit up /r/AskBattlestations.  The stuff under the desk could be organized and moved somewhere else (Ikea/Craigslist is your friend here), and that desk looks suspiciously like a corner desk that isn't in the corner, which removes some of the benefit of it being set up that way.

Try to take your picture during the day.  hide cables get a DSLR and a lens with a very short depth of field. Take pictures where the subject is sharp and the background is very blurry.

I have used three in portrait several times, and I don't know why, buy I get easily distracted that way. I think its because I can have two main documents open on the verticals (.PDF and writer, as an example) and keep less used stuff on the other monitors.

Of course, since i've just built a rig into its bigger brother the R5, i can attest that the R5 with no window is damn near dead silent. I can't tell it's on sometimes.   In short, if you want silence, this case is great - get the non-windowed version for sure. It's an upgrade in silence compared to just about everything else around."

battlestations,37zrvt,thenewvegas,2,Sun May 31 20:06:24 2015 UTC,"I'm am going to say no.

With both of my monitors set as flat and extended as possible, there is a small 1/2-1 inch gap between the bezels. A 28"" monitor would be too horizontally wide, in my opinion."

I like to have them angle towards me so that the furthest pixel on both monitors is not that far from my peripherals. Also, the 24"" monitor's physical height matches up perfectly with the 21:9. Another thing to note is the pixel density of a 1920X1080 monitor above 24"" inches (to me) seems too low and would look pixelated.  Hope this helps!"

It's still a blower design so exhausts all the heat out of the back, but the mod does mean the bottom fan has to be a 120MM opposed to the included 140MM fan.  GPU temp hits its temp limit (79c I think) but doesn't really seem to throttle, I assume that is the design of the GPU Boost function on the card as if you force a fan speed increase manually the temps do come down.  The biggest problem is you have to loose the dust filter and the bottom fan a few CM off the carpet with no filter does pull in a fair amount of dust."

You want your tweeters at ear level (or close to it and tilted towards your ears) because of how directional treble is, and you want your cabinets mechanically isolated from your desk.  This will help clean up the bass.  I would recommend IsoAcoustics ISO-L8R130's (what I currently use with my CEntrance MasterClass 2504's) as they provide excellent isolation, and you can really tweak them to get a good position and angle for your speakers.  If these are a bit out of your price range, you can try some cheap AudioEngine DS1's or DS2's (I think the 1's would be big enough, but I'm not positive)."

battlestations,37yio6,grtkbrandon,1 point,Sun May 31 20:23:14 2015 UTC,"I also have the AV40's and I love my bass too, these speakers do handle bass quite well for their size.  They wont be shaking walls or anything, but they do have a nice punch to them at higher volumes."
battlestations,37yio6,BluepantsMcgee,1 point,Sun May 31 18:48:21 2015 UTC,"I've got them, they are brilliant. Bass wise is just fine for the most part. If you're in to your sub bass music though there are better ones out there."

battlestations,37yio6,_professional_,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:52:31 2015 UTC,Mine get REALLY hot after being on for a while (not even just playing music). I don't think it affects the sound but it's probably an electricity hog.

battlestations,37yio6,aulusagerius,1 point,Sun May 31 20:39:55 2015 UTC,How do you like that logitec mouse? I've been wanting to get it for shits and gigs. Seems like one would have a lot of problems with clicking all the different buttons.
battlestations,37yio6,i4one,1 point,Sun May 31 16:06:13 2015 UTC,"Well, first of all I don't like the looks of these gaming mice. I had a Performance MX before this one but it was not suitable for gaming. This mouse is a lot lighter and smaller, but it's so much better for gaming! I have not pressed any buttons by accident, but I can see that totally happen when you have bigger hands. I really just got it for the superb sensor technology, which is really the best I've ever had."
battlestations,37yio6,divanguz,1 point,Sun May 31 16:13:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I went to best buy and tooled around with it for a little bit. Big hands are definitely an issue:/ I'm using the razor black window and death adder but Was thinking about making the switch to Logitech gear to see how they compare. Awesome setup by the way. Can't go wrong with the clean contemporary look."

battlestations,381peg,ImaEvilDoctor,2,Mon Jun 1 05:31:33 2015 UTC,"You could use a Cord Cover Kit like this from Amazon to cover your wire harness leading up to the wall mounted TV.  For your cables below the desk, you could try a cable corral to coil up the excess cables. You might be able to store the power bricks in it as well — would depend on how much clearance you have under your desk and whether or not you'd be opposed to mounting screws to the underside.   A wire tray might look better and this one looks like it can be installed to under your desk up against the backboard. It doesn't look like your power bricks would fit up there, but at least you could conceal the excess cable."

Especially with an over clocked 970 and a 4690K. I'd look to upgrading to at least 700 with that, but if 650 doesn't give you any problems then stay with it. I didn't think that it would actually run that much though."
