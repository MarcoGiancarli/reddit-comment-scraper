Triple checking that it was all <30 seconds, my hope is gone. I always hoped it was something secret with the gorgons.  Someone now needs to sound sample each gorgon dying.

raidsecrets,3e3dys,EdgePunk311,8,Tue Jul 21 17:26:33 2015 UTC,How are you suppose to finish the raid? Cause atheon sends 3 people in the final fight.  So instant wipe
raidsecrets,3e3dys,Currencyy,7,Tue Jul 21 17:34:04 2015 UTC,I believe a Sunsinger can kill themselves before timestream and then selfres.
raidsecrets,3e3dys,Renegade284,4,Tue Jul 21 17:36:32 2015 UTC,This is correct. Can you still use the trick like this guy solo'd the vault?
raidsecrets,3e3dys,SomeoneWorse,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:22:15 2015 UTC,Does he always teleport three people though? There are numerous videos on YouTube of people two-manning the Atheon fight: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=atheon+two+man
raidsecrets,3e3dys,Currencyy,2,Tue Jul 21 17:35:43 2015 UTC,Yes you can two man it by doing the warlock self Rez right before he teleports
raidsecrets,3e3dys,Currencyy,4,Tue Jul 21 17:36:56 2015 UTC,"If you can two man it, you should be able to three man it then, no? I mean couldn't you just do it without Time's Vengeance as well if need be?"
raidsecrets,3e3dys,remybach,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:38:11 2015 UTC,Yes but that would require one sunsinger. They would not make a chest possible that requires you to have a specific class. That's like putting a chest somewhere that a Titan can only reach by doing the death from above slam from a super high point.
raidsecrets,3e3dys,remybach,3,Tue Jul 21 17:40:51 2015 UTC,"But let's take that one step further -- isn't it theorized that Kabr, Pahanin, and Praedyth had full coverage of all the types of classes in the sense that there was a warlock, a titan, and a hunter? It's not out of the realm of possibility then that you may need a fireteam of three with each class covered.  If /u/Zikkah sees this, can you comment on the classes of the players you were with when you believe you located the chest in the Gorgon maze?   You are going a step further though /u/Currencyy -- Zikkah found the chest in the Gorgon maze with a three man fireteam. To complete the sixth chest trigger, you clearly don't need to beat Atheon yet as Zikkah didn't say anything about returning to the Maze before finding the chest after completing the Atheon encounter. We may be getting a step ahead of ourselves here in our analysis. I'm just trying to piece together things that may help us re-find the chest that Zikkah is convinced he saw."
raidsecrets,3e3dys,Currencyy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:46:25 2015 UTC,There were 2 warlocks and a hunter: http://destinyactivitydetails.com/705444486
raidsecrets,3e3dys,PunchUinDaMowf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:48:12 2015 UTC,"Presuming this is, in fact, the Zikkah game that we think he saw the chest in, then perhaps the class identity is irrelevant for the three man fireteam... it only came up in the thread in the context of the Atheon encounter, which isn't really the point of my post."
raidsecrets,3e3dys,bepr0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:53:48 2015 UTC,Fair enough... Just thought I'd point it out since it came up.  Fwiw: he's pretty sure it's the right game: https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/3b7b7n/slug/csk2836
raidsecrets,3e3dys,SSJ2-Gohan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:57:07 2015 UTC,So he found a chest with three people but you say you don't need to beat atheon. I find it silly to load the raid with three people to get a chest at the gorgons maze to just end it there.
raidsecrets,3e3dys,CherryDeth,3,Tue Jul 21 17:50:26 2015 UTC,"I think you're missing the point -- all I am trying to do is make a connection between the fact that when Zikkah found the chest, he had three people, and that when Kabr entered the vault, he had three people as well. That's all, nothing more, nothing less.  Besides, is it really that crazy to think that Bungie might use that as a triggering mechanic given some of the things that we know they've done in the past?"
raidsecrets,3e3dys,Wolf_Antarctic,2,Tue Jul 21 17:52:42 2015 UTC,I don't think so.  I think it's a genius way to make it hard to find.
raidsecrets,3e3dys,veryrelevantusername,0,Tue Jul 21 19:22:31 2015 UTC,"Hypothetically with 3 you could have at least one person at each portal to leave them open, once teleported one person would sprint to the open portal to stand on the outside, while other 2 dealt with oracles/relic, cleansing the third on their way out and then heading to the middle to pop Atheon."
raidsecrets,3e3dys,CherryDeth,3,Tue Jul 21 18:04:45 2015 UTC,"Nope, lost in time kills too quickly for someone to make it that distance"
raidsecrets,3e3dys,snapp3d,3,Tue Jul 21 19:03:00 2015 UTC,Nobody is quite sure as to whether Praedyth was friend or foe. There is never really any mention of his class or anything other than his name in the Grimoire if I remember correctly.
raidsecrets,3e3dys,wordofcrota,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:54:19 2015 UTC,"I agree, I haven't been able to find any information on Kabr's fireteam aside from the fact that Pahanin talked to him and ""witnessed"" his ""fall."" No where (that I can find) says who was in his fireteam or how many there were."
raidsecrets,3e3dys,7strikes,3,Tue Jul 21 19:50:10 2015 UTC,"Isn't that because the other members of Kabr's fireteam were wiped from existence? If they never existed, we wouldn't hear about them. Isn't that why Kabr says something to the effect of, ""I wasn't alone, but I was the only one there."""
raidsecrets,3e3dys,monk561,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:31:02 2015 UTC,Also if I'm not mistaken it sounds like he had made multiple trips to the vault.
raidsecrets,3e3dys,monk561,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:12:50 2015 UTC,"The way i read it , it seemed as tho there were 2 different raids on the VoG?"
raidsecrets,3e3dys,HylianTimelord,4,Tue Jul 21 21:44:31 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure pahanin wasnt part of kabrs fireteam, pahanin states that he was not kabrs friend, but knew and respected him as a good man. Also atheon would be impossible, sunsinger glitching doesnt count, its a glitch, also you cant keep the portals open and make a dash for it, they shut everytime he sends people through the timestream.  Edit:praedyth wasnt either i dont think, kabr had no fireteam members left, praedyth wasnt wiped from existence but caught in a vex portal, possibly succumbing to a paradox or his demise after. Kabr would still remember praedyth if they had met before.  Edit2:one more thing is pahanin states, ""that is all i can remember"". Seems fishy, and possibly implying something else could have happened but hes forgotten. Ive always figured pahanin followed kabrs fireteam into the vault and watched them from afar. If so itd probably fit this suggestion of ""that is all i can remember"", because he had forgotten them like kabr."
raidsecrets,3e3dys,Arjunks_,2,Tue Jul 21 20:20:28 2015 UTC,"We don't know how many were in Kabr's fireteam or who they were because they were erased from existence. Pahanin knew Kabr but didn't go in with him; we still know of his name and deeds, and he was eventually murdered by Dredgen Yor. Praedyth is a total unknown, but if he was indeed a teammate of Kabr's it's unusual that we know of him but not the others."
raidsecrets,3e3dys,Chroniverous,3,Tue Jul 21 22:38:53 2015 UTC,"I think that guy who believes he found a 6th chest believes he is correct so much to go out of his way to prove it, but I think he is mistaken. I do not think there is a 6th chest, especially in the gorgons maze, and especially one that triggers if you go through the whole thing with 3 people."
raidsecrets,3e3dys,rushingfox,2,Tue Jul 21 20:33:50 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your input. I'll continue to chase the dragon, I hope you don't mind. My gut says Zikkah found something and either he's a great troll or telling the truth. There is no middle ground."
raidsecrets,3e3dys,leek,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:48:43 2015 UTC,I agree with you and thats what I (poorly) tried to explain. I think he is telling the truth of his encounter. But I do believe he was turned around or something and opened one of the currently known ones
raidsecrets,3e3x0p,chmac84,9,Tue Jul 21 19:35:43 2015 UTC,"Okay so this is crazy i hope you have a video. Because over my shadow chasing over the past few months I can confirm hearing strange almost voice anomalies. I have turtle beaches the Px4s and i normally only wear my right side headphone though since it has the mic on that side. So i have returned two pair of them already for what i have been throwing off as interference, mostly because noone else hears it most of the time and because im normally alone when i hear it. I have 1 person who i play with regularly whos a IRL friend of mine who also heard it though i wasnt sure if i believed them sinve he would probably just say that and secretly think i was crazy. I normally start hearinging things 8 to 13 minutes into the walking ruins, and just when you think it doesnt exist it happens. It almost makes you ? your sanity and im glad you posted because I felt crazy trying to explain it even to my wife and good friend. 1 thing i can note about the ""ghost chatter"" is it seems entirely random and i cannot get it on video because it seems to play at very low volumes that i can only actually catch that it was a word after the word was ""whispered"". I have somewhat made out ""listen""(i thought it was ""glisten"") ""guardian"" and for the strangest reason ""edge"". Which is why I've been jumping off cliffs. Anyway when you said listen i imagined glisten."
raidsecrets,3e3x0p,blowindoe_doe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:17:34 2015 UTC,Exactly like you explained. About 8-10 minutes after being in the ruins and seeing the spire is forming and messing with the spire it happens and I keep questioning whether I'm crazy or it's a glitch or whatever. But both times I have gotten it to happen I was able to get the spire about halfway up and it will stay there. I try to make subtle movements to try and track the noises. Also it seems as though by following the noise it is what is causing the spire to form to a more fuller spire. Regardless of whatever I think that it is atleast worth investigating further. More so than most theories.
raidsecrets,3e3x0p,EdgePunk311,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:48:42 2015 UTC,I wonder if this has anything to do with this mechanic that I posted about earlier from Halo games: https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/3d0qeh/vog_two_mechanics_rarely_discussed/
raidsecrets,3e3x0p,blowindoe_doe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:12:52 2015 UTC,"Im honestly very glad you said something, best buy hates me and my turtle beach problem. Its strange, on all my videos i can't  hear it after its recorded. I'd be willing to bet that there is something going on in the background at a frequency we cannot normally hear. Like i said it almost always happens when im exploring solo and can only Almost make out words. So i cant confirm you heard ""listen"" or what because i can only make out somethings sometimes. Oddly enough im never really doing anything up untill i hear them, im either jumping of cliffs, watching shadows pass, and looking in cracks. And then i hear it, and i would guess my guardian looks like a beagle or dog being called looking around lost."

And you talk about the spire forming, are you keeping adds off of the plates with a team or by yourself, or does simply following the voices build the spire.    Most of us around here wear our tinfoil hats to block the voices, so forgive our reluctance to remove them.  Just need some reassurance that everything will be okay if we do.  Definitely intrigued!"
raidsecrets,3e3x0p,SavagePope51,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:12:21 2015 UTC,"Yea sorry, I'm typing on my phone which sucks for going into great detail but I'll give it a go. So both times I have encountered this the events have been the same. I start out by going to patrol on Venus. I make my way to the waking ruins and everything is normal. I'll go around killing ads usually for a patrol bounty. Then out of no where it's like a team started the vault of glass and it will say the spire is forming. But there is no raid team spawning in or anything. Then the vex have taken control of a sync plate blah blah blah... I'm sure we've all seen this nothing new. Well I load up my Truth with 8 rockets and go from left to middle to right sync plate killing the praetorians. Then I jump down to the spire and it will repeat. I'll lazily launch a few rockets at the praetorians and then after a bit I walk up to the spire which at this point is just a grid of white lines. I'll trudge slowly around the walls of the half-assed spire listening for noises. These noises are similar to the noises of like when you are being pulled through time in the Atheon fight. If I move to the left or right any the noise stops. So I follow these noises for a few minutes and the spire will start to take a little more shape. Almost like a huge scaffold or something. Then about every 10 seconds I hear the word ""listen"" pretty distinctly. The same with this as I move around the voice goes away. The first time this happened I got pulled away from the game because dad duties. The second this time I was kicked for inactivity because I was trying to figure out the whole creating a reddit user id, and creating my original post (dumb) lol. That's pretty much all I've got."

What I am proposing is :  What if 2 of the three who didn't get teleported run into the portal and help out on oracles.

I've been thinking for a while and it makes sense that the new upgrades we're being given in TTK will allow us to further explore the vault of glass. Whether it's messing with enemies or changing the raid entirely, it's not possible until TTK.  And in one of the trailers or ViDocs, they show a mission where you re-enter the VOG, this time it's filled with new enemies and taken. It shows a weird gorgon/hydra combo and oracles in the labyrinth. So it could be specifically for that mission, but also be used for the gorgons in the raid."

I don't know a whole lot about alchemy, but I do know that classically alchemists have tries to take existing materials and create an elixir of life to grant immortality.   Here's the stretch in my imagination.   The vex have mastered space and time and supposedly exist on multiple planes of existence simultaneously. It could be possible that they came upon this ability in a search of immortality and ultimate control of the universe. It almost makes sense to me that in his trials Kabr found a way to replicate the vex's ability to manipulate space and time and has achieved a form of immortality in the form of the Aegis. This could be a nod in that direction of the lore hinting at something larger. Although, the more I talk about it, the more I realise that it's probably unlikely that they used these symbols to hint at one specific instance...   Eh, oh well. Awesome find man. It's way more than I could have done."

Other embodiments of the Philosopher's Stone were the Elixir Vitae, the Grand Magisterium, and the Red Tincture, all regarded as universal medicines. The alchemical fascination with gold emerged from the idea that gold was the perfect metal. If one could understand the essence of this perfect metal (the theory went), the essence of all substances less perfect than gold could then be understood, which, accordingly, could lead to the creation of all substances, including gold. The Philosopher's Stone incorporated the promise that the perfection of gold could somehow be transferred to life's processes. The Philosopher's Stone was the agent by which base metals could be changed to gold and, by extrapolation, could lead to greater longevity.""  Just lurking and thought this might help o.O"

raidsecrets,3dw8fh,hatyn,8,Mon Jul 20 11:59:20 2015 UTC,"Right.  So, the first image you post is the fundamental breakdown of how alchemists saw the world: God above with the Natural world as a manifestation of God's being and will, shown in basic elements of Earth, Fire, Air, and Water, recombined in Spirit for man (identified as the microcosm in the image at the bottom), with spirit not being within the domains of vegetable and mineral.  What's interesting to notice is that the image from the end credits and the second image from your linked page is that they are NOT exact mirrors: the circle of Natura is missing from the Destiny chart; I think this implies that the Golden Age people believed they have overcome Nature and touched on the direct spark of the Divine via the Traveler.  The order of elements is also changed: Earth and Fire bracket Air and Water.  I'm not sure of the significance of that.  The symbols are a hell of a mix up, and they've been bugging me for a while too.  I've identified one of the symbols in the Bungie series (the one in the circle matching with 'mineral') as some sort of variation of Mercury.  Everything else is mish-mash to me.  If you're interested, the other series of images near the bottom of your linked page are Kabbalistic in nature, and represent the various emanations of God/YHVH and the aspects of divine nature and knowledge.

The 3 forming the equilateral triangle are vegetable, mineral, and on the bottom, ""microcosmos"" I know that I'm not translating it correctly, but it appears that's the equivalent of the ""animal"" element. In the DEC version it has rays emanating from that circle? Who knows. Not sure how much of what  just said was obvious, but it wasn't mentioned yet, so well, uh, there it is.  Edit: also, from the link, ""Omnia ab Uno"" is the inscription on Nicholas Cage's future tomb.

A) There is not geomantic figure for earth, geomantic was came about when geocentrism(earth center of universe) was accepted as truth. B) the geomantic figure being used for earth in these images doesn't match any other geomantics and actually has to many dots. It appears to be populus(moon) with two dots added in the center.

raidsecrets,3drako,Elikhi,3,Sat Jul 18 18:22:25 2015 UTC,"This is a good question.  First start with the Grimoire, familiarise yourself with the background descriptions and lore.  Second, familiarise yourself with the Vault.  Don't know about others but I've spend many quiet hours climbing walls, learning paths, finding nooks and crannies.  I'd say I'm as familiar with the Vault now as anywhere I know, and I don't regret a second of it.  Third, familiarise yourself with the game mechanics, doing a makes b happen, etc...  There may be a clue as to intent hidden away in something nobody has done before.  Fourth, start reading the Mythology surrounding the games lore.  It's a fascinating journey in itself getting to grips with civilisations origins, and building a library of references will help you better understand the wellspring of historical ideas Bungie have drawn from.  Fifth, explore the games imagery.  The Alpha Lupi image lately has become a source of renewed interest as an example.  Sixth, just explore ideas, and talk to others about them here.  This is a pretty friendly group who all know we are as crazy as each other :) so many great ideas have been explored already, draw upon the knowledge of others so you're not repeating ideas again."

I also recommend spending more time on this sub, there are several Redditors who hold valuable information regarding mechanics and areas.  Also, if you plan on uploading videos to share, consider getting an editing program. It's not necessary. But from a business perspective, if you wish to grow a channel, it's nicer to have some editing, however minimal.

As if I don't already have my brain turned to mush with so much I've seen on here in the short time I've become active.   On another note.....would this be a bad time to mention a new set of symbols I've discovered. Symbols I have yet to see anywhere else(I think I haven't seen them before). Anyways they're in the thinger-ma-bob that spins/twirls around and anaylyzes the traveler where the speaker is. On the outside of one of the rings. You barely catch a passing glimpse most of the time. But if you wait around long enough (preferably right underneath it) it'll stop spinning for a few seconds. I have a screen shot of it, just keep forgetting to upload it with everything else rattling around in my head."

I actually found more in The Grottos, but they only appear when Sardon is there (as in, you have to be playing the story mission ""Fist of Crota"" to see them. I haven't taken new screenshots, yet, but I will today. I also have a feeling of one more place to look for those..... (I'm aware these may be a dead end, but having them on record is still nice.)  Anyway, funny enough I went and checked out the Destiny credits soon after and low-and-behold I was fucking floored the entire time watching, staring at the damn glyphs you've presented for us here today. I was going to take screenshots of them, too, but had planned on researching it first. I guess you could say it comes full circle, someone had already done the work. ;)  Honestly, can't believe I forgot about seeing them in the trailers, too. I hadn't even thought to check there. Bravo. Shit, now I'm thinking about digging up advertisement material for the game. Perhaps they're hiding more in the posters and banners?  Really, really nice job so far. Let's keep it going! This is fun!  EDIT: Cutscenes. They've got to be in the cutscenes, especially the intro one showing the solar system while the Speaker explains the history!"

raidsecrets,3dpvx1,mancow533,2,Sat Jul 18 22:43:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't even remember why I was there to begin with(probably cashing in materials). I started looking at the hologram through the round viewer(?) that's on the speaker's desk. Next thing I know I'm jumping and crouching around the damn thing inspecting it....during which time a tin foil hat somehow got on my head...it was the weirdest thing because I swore I left mine in my storage locker.  But yeah! These are extremely suspect! However, I'm just starting to get to a mindset that a lot of stuff was just used for aesthetic purposes i.e. maps and just thrown in/on something. But what isn't, is just leftover stuff that didn't get used. Given how much is known to have been cut and/or changed in the last year of development by Bungie.   These do seem different and odd enough to come off as actual easter egg kind of stuff tho."

You reference the Gorgons and Perseus story, which is the most well known yes, but there are other points of reference which may be equally as important.  Gorgons appear in more mythologies than simply the story of Perseus, so far I've found them in:  Odysseus and his descent into the underworld. Theseus and his descent into the underworld. Dante and his descent into the underworld.  (as the theme goes, they appear to be an archetype of one of the gatekeepers of the underworld which have been inherited from other cultures) I've also directly linked Perseus and the Aegis to Ariadne (Perseus in his battle with Dionysus turned Ariadne to stone with Medusas head) and it is noted by author the huge similarities between the myth of Perseus and Dionysus (Osiris by any other name).  So Medusa and the Gorgons is also linked to the myth of the Labyrinth of Daedelus.  I've also linked the Gorgons to the birth of Pegasus."

Just bare in mind the games approaching a year old now, so if the puzzle (if there is one in the first place that is) was simple verbatim repetition of a myth, then likely it would have been done by now.  Bungie appear to have done something more subtle (if at all), and we need to read between the lines a little more to work out whats going on.  You guys have done some good work figuring things out.

raidsecrets,3dmc6b,Guardian423,2,Sat Jul 18 16:07:16 2015 UTC,"""Thanks to /u/aGenericName for discovering that if one Relic is outside of the Throne Room that the next phase of the Conflux defence will not begin and /u/realcoolioman for confirming it.""  When we ran the gorgon massacre a couple of days ago we pushed on to gatekeeper, we killed all 3 gatekeepers and took both relics out through the door in the present. The conflux in the centre still spawned in and we managed to defend it with no relics, this left the 2 guys outside at atheon cp and they never got teleported back in.   What are the requirements for preventing the middle conflux spawning in the first place? Do you only kill 1 gatekeeper in the portal?"
raidsecrets,3dmc6b,aGenericName,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:08:15 2015 UTC,"You misinterpreted it.  The second a past or future gatekeeper dies the center conflux spawns, every time.  We just found out that the trigger for starting the final phase is BOTH relics in the present,  but if you leave the area considered ""the present"" then it won't trigger the final phase of confluxes.  but the never ending wave of mino's still spawns in.  Notable side effect: If you ever get a relic stuck in one portal because you left the portal and re-enter it. the game won't ever trigger the final phase.  I imagine they used this so that they could have a relic help defend the middle plate to make their life super easy. not super useful   Edit: actually watched the video, apparently they took both of them out i guess they just werent aware you could do that until he read one of our posts about it"
raidsecrets,3dmc6b,aGenericName,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:18:54 2015 UTC,"I had no idea that both Relics could be ""outside"" of the Throne Room without the Final Conflux Phase beginning, until I saw realcooliman's video doing so and crediting you for the find/assumption.  And as you said, the second Relic wasn't to help defend the Conflux, it was to help bring it to ToK ;)"
raidsecrets,3dmc6b,Nyraa456,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:38:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for the clarification.
raidsecrets,3dmc6b,xMicro,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:33:42 2015 UTC,"I believe I explained in the video, but what happened was this:   I entered the Past Portal, retrieved the Relic and then exited the Throne Room. I waited up near the jumping puzzle landing.   Someone rotated to defend the Minotaur spawn while another opened the Future Portal.   The third person went into the Future Portal and took the Relic out.   When they exited, the Final Phase did not begin because I wasn't inside the Throne Room   They came out to me and we Climbed Out!     So the Centre Conflux always spawns, but it's the Final Phase that can be prevented by having one Relic outside before the second one is brought out."

raidsecrets,3do3mq,smokeg13,3,Fri Jul 17 21:16:40 2015 UTC,"0 teleports chest disappears when you enter the labyrinth.  Edit: to be clear, it disappears when one of your fireteam enters the gorgon's labyrinth."
raidsecrets,3do3mq,dogcow_,3,Fri Jul 17 21:47:11 2015 UTC,There are actually two detection mechanics. First the normal gaze with the known animation of the Gorgon. That is counted on the scoreboard. Second the alarm scream. This only happens if you are close to a Gorgon and this is the mechnic that closes the chest doors.  Those two mechanic usually only happen together but there are possibilities to only trigger one or the other mechanic and therefore have scoreboard detection = 1 with open chest doors or scoreboard detection = 0 with closed chest doors.   See here for proof:  https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/3cxrdk/voggorgon_labyrinth_chest_doors_closing_with_0/
raidsecrets,3do3mq,Cornholio83,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:19:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think we've come to a definitive answer to whether or not the chests in the Gorgon's Labyrinth play off the scoreboard. /u/DemolitionWolf discovered a few months ago that if you kill the Gorgons from a certain distance the chests will still be accessible, which makes the scoreboard theory void for this encounter.

raidsecrets,3dmdxl,Guardian423,2,Fri Jul 17 13:17:33 2015 UTC,"Ill give it a go.    Not that I've ever heard of.  There are some geyser like things throughout the maze, maybe it's related to those.  I'd have to check. I play with volume off usually. I haven't seen a post here about it.  Purple gorgon probably doesn't mean much, destiny has quite a few known lighting glitches it wouldn't surprise me I this was just a fluke.  Again I'd have to check it myself.  If it substantially changed colour it could be on purpose. But if its just a small change then its probably unintended. Just IMO. Zikkah doesn't even know where zikkah found it. His best guess is where the stationary gorgon on HM spawns.  The one on the right side of the maze. Somewhere around there.  Personally after reading his posts a few times I could interpret his path as being just about anywhere, it's not described with any certainty.  Getting a key after defeating the gorgons could be cool.  Something to use on the door when it locks. But for the meantime attaching one to a leash and trying to bring it over to atheon isn't gonna work out. Cool concept though.  Yes we did, we died immediately afterwards as expected. serfaboy just posted how to get the relic all the way out to atleast the trials of kabr.  Against a gorgon it does no helpfull damage and the cleanse does not save you. No it dissapears everytime."

Looks like we're getting somewhere but a word of caution, the Internet is full of half baked crap, so we need to get this pinned back to primary references and fact.  Third party comments are useless to us, we need solid authoritative sources.  The destiny soundtrack was originally called 'The Music of the Spheres' so that the sound design is tied to Pythagoras and his musical theory is undoubted.  We need to work out how this connection has influenced the design of the game.  The Enneagram, very good find, definately on the right path, but we need primary references.  There is a lot, reading around the websites that, to put it bluntly, is nonsensical, poorly constructed, ill considered, pseudo religious tosh.  Do not trust it.  We need the origins, sources, and skeptical minds, not people spouting 'theories' with little idea of what the word actually means."
