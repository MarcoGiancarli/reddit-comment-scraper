I still don't think that single player or PvE was a consideration for UBI, merely an afterthought at this point.

I know you just answered a whole bunch of questions, but I have a quick one that hadn't occurred to me until I watched your video - if you don't mind, I'll post it here:  You talked a bit about the cameras/surveillance system, and the tactical option/advantage of taking out the cameras as you move through the map. Obviously, the drones can be positioned differently and moved around, but is there any randomisation of the fixed cameras? Or, say there are 5 cameras in a map, but 10 possible positions they could occupy - so they would still need to be sought out, at least to some extent..?  Thanks!"
Rainbow6,3e458n,sonoblink,2,Wed Jul 22 00:15:36 2015 UTC,"That would be SO cool!  They did randomize the start positions of the drones at least so you can no longer tell where everyone is coming from before they spawn so at least that's good. The fixed cameras always stay in the same spot though, but your idea would be really cool!"

Plant spies and collect intel on enemies around the world. Manage funding budgets and public opinion from mission success/failures. UI would basically be a world map. I'd play the hell out of it.
Rainbow6,3e3wvw,Speciou5,2,Tue Jul 21 20:43:00 2015 UTC,"For me, I think the best option would be a smaller title; similar to how SWAT 2 or Breach & Clear works with focus on strategy, gear and such. Negotiation would of course always be an option as would lethal and not lethal takedowns. All with an top down view that gave you overall command and a lot more focus on how the different operators worked and your tactics; not your shooting."

Rainbow6,3e07uy,Pugnator48,4,Mon Jul 20 23:17:27 2015 UTC,There are so many possibilities in Siege and I love the tactics it brings with destruction + gadgets.  I'll try and do a few videos on this subject.
Rainbow6,3e07uy,Deosl,2,Tue Jul 21 08:38:43 2015 UTC,"One tactic that I have in mind is:   Surround the ""objective"" room from all possible locations, with:     [Team A]: 2 CTUs (distraction team)  [Team B]: 3 CTUs    Team A breaches first from one location, but doesn't do an entry. This distracts the defenders. Team B breaches simultaneously from another location (preferably opposite to the first breach location). One of them throws a flash-bang. One of the Team A members also throws a flash-bang immediately following Team B's flash-bang. Defenders are stunned! All teams enter the ""objective"" room and clear out the defenders!   This technique will work best when defenders are all present in the ""objective"" room."
Rainbow6,3e07uy,DL-Z_ftw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:02:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and all the defenders being in one place makes proper room entry essential."
Rainbow6,3e07uy,Its_Epi,2,Tue Jul 21 08:11:37 2015 UTC,Do you think that all defenders stacking in the same room is ideal for defense? Don't forget about making your own entry points!
Rainbow6,3e07uy,iceycat,2,Tue Jul 21 13:31:25 2015 UTC,"I think you never want to ALWAYS do the same thing, BUT sticking together is a pretty valid defensive choice. Splitting up seemed to be a good way to get picked off one at a time. Having someone roam is good though. A good formation might be to pair up 2 groups of people in two different areas and have the 5th man roam or ambush. You always want to watch each other's backs and be able to revive or help out a suppressed team mate if needed.  Just once though I think it would be funny as hell to completely barricade an objective area and then have EVERYONE displace to another floor. As soon as the objective contested notification pops up blow a nitro cell charge on the objective and then storm from their back side. Never had the guts to try it though."
Rainbow6,3e07uy,Djaquitchane,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:41:06 2015 UTC,Yeah some Operators (such as Pulse or Smoke for example) don't seem all too interesting when staying on top of the objective.
Rainbow6,3e07uy,tacomandood,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:34:11 2015 UTC,"I think the ideal defence would involve two operators working outside the objective, keeping a low profile and setting up flanks, and three operators inside the objective with clearly defined areas of responsibility.  I've never played the game, though -- these are some of the things I'd like to find out first when the beta starts. :)"
Rainbow6,3e07uy,electr1cpanda,2,Wed Jul 22 01:02:25 2015 UTC,"Well when breaching a room and clearing you usually want to take the path of least resistance. This is why you usually see a person posted on each side of the doorway or entry point. Once the room has been breached one will push from say the left side first and go straight right covering a sector on the right side of the room, while the next will then push from the right side of the doorway going the opposite way to cover a sector on the left side. The third and fourth people will follow behind covering more directly through the doorway. The important thing to remember is that people should only focus on their sectors as crossing sectors reduces efficiency and creates a blind spot in the room where someone could be hiding behind cover waiting to shoot."
Rainbow6,3e07uy,Deosl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:39:38 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I'm talking about, at least for the attackers.  I'm not sure what kind of tactics to employ on the defending side, however."

Rainbow6,3e07uy,Deosl,2,Tue Jul 21 19:20:28 2015 UTC,Exactly what I was looking for on my lunch break - thanks /u/Deosl!
Rainbow6,3e07uy,DL-Z_ftw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:42:04 2015 UTC,I wonder why the defenders seem to stick together around the objective when I would have thought a better strategy to throw off the attackers is to have a patrol of two to flank behind the attacker's initial entry point?
Rainbow6,3e07uy,Deosl,2,Tue Jul 21 10:19:27 2015 UTC,"You don't always know where the attackers are coming from. But yes, having 1 or 2 ""roamers"" is good to gain intel or take them out if they are not expecting it. It also depends if the attackers have found the objective or not, so many elements that plays in :)  When you are inside/near the objective you can fortify some great defensive positions. You have a great advantage over the attackers if you can cover enough angles/entry points.   Also if you go down and you have Doc on your team, he can get you up quickly. There are so many tactics for and against, not to mention the still unannounced operators :)  The best tactic is to have great communication and be flexible as anything can change during the round."
Rainbow6,3e07uy,DL-Z_ftw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:01:47 2015 UTC,"So many ways to get the job done, making every round play out in a unique way. That's what I love about this game!  Also, as you mentioned Doc... Did he seem overpowered to you at any point during the game?"
Rainbow6,3e07uy,punjistick,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:37:10 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, Doc is very powerful with 5 stim shots and the ability to revive himself. That's why we used him so he could get us up fast without being exposed. Maybe remove self revive and only have 2-3 stim shots."
Rainbow6,3e07uy,reddz95,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:57:57 2015 UTC,I hope that this feedback has been delivered! ;)
Rainbow6,3e07uy,punjistick,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:11:10 2015 UTC,"a thing I saw a lot of in the beta stream was this idea that everyone in the defending team needs to be locked into the same room, covering different angles.  this struck me as nothing but extremely foolish, and lead to an extremely quick wipe...there's access to the entire map for a reason, and Ts should be playing spots that offer them insight on CT movement as well as keep the assaulting team guessing, not just swamping one room around the hostage and hoping they can win gunfights (which they didn't)  just my .02, not fully on topic with breaching, but around the idea of how not to get breached so hard."
Rainbow6,3e07uy,Its_Epi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:47:06 2015 UTC,"Part of this I think is what I call early discipline. When a game is new I see a lot of closer knit gameplay before people start to branch out a bit and take more risks as they see it.   I think once people go a few rounds/weeks the discipline of back to back fighting will temper a bit and you'll start to see a lot of roaming. On the flip side, I think you'll see the attackers start to gel much more nicely in terms of breaching... if anything in the vids I see the defenders spread more and the attackers form up closer... I'm a huge fan of this."
Rainbow6,3e07uy,punjistick,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:53:14 2015 UTC,"yeah mostly just referencing the losing defending teams during the beta stream, they kept bunching up in the same room and getting stepped on haha"
Rainbow6,3e07uy,petracat09,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:22:08 2015 UTC,"I noticed the same thing. The maps are fairly sizable, and very fluid with the procedural destruction. It will be interesting seeing the sweet spots that people find in the maps to watch the enemy, as well as cover multiple lanes of approach. I'm excited about it!"
Rainbow6,3e07uy,punjistick,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:36:23 2015 UTC,"definitely, in a map where so much is destructible it's definitely all about playing angles and using the whole map to your advantage, bunching up won't cut it (at least when defending)"
Rainbow6,3e07uy,zynlen101,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:23:14 2015 UTC,The map analysis is going to be real - I'm curious if someone is already planning a wiki site or if the forums will have permanent threads for folks to share strategies on map overlays.   Perhaps I'll start a thread of my own and see what people are thinking... ;)
Rainbow6,3e07uy,petracat09,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:34:39 2015 UTC,"NJP/ruN standardized the callouts and such for GRP, maybe we'll take a crack at R6 as well! haha"
Rainbow6,3e07uy,punjistick,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:51:58 2015 UTC,"Defenders are likely to cover a door from the front. Thus, an attacker should prioritize taking out the immediate threat right in front of him, either by shooting the defender from the doorway through leaning or having the attackers breach from multiple entrypoints.  Of course this works best when all the defenders are in one spot. Attackers run the risk of being outflanked."
Rainbow6,3e0797,Djaquitchane,4,Mon Jul 20 23:12:34 2015 UTC,Are they still that noticeable? Playing last week it didn't bother me as it did in the alpha.
Rainbow6,3e0797,Deosl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:15:39 2015 UTC,"I personally didn't care much, I figured that once you're ""in the heat"" you only noticed them when you really focused on noticing them."
Rainbow6,3e0797,petracat09,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:06:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I didn't notice it while playing but watching it's like seeing contrails for bullets everywhere.   So while it may be a really good visual indication for players who may catch it out of the corner of the eye and immediately hone in on the source, for viewers it's noticeably odd."

But, when I'm playing or using the computer in general, I never notice it ever!""  Same goes for the bullet trails, I guess! :D"
Rainbow6,3e0797,geofurb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:49:27 2015 UTC,They're still quite noticeable in the E3 build.
Rainbow6,3e0797,punjistick,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:04:40 2015 UTC,"they didn't seem as noticeable in the beta stream, but I agree the trails should only be apparent after penetrating a surface (or even body, so maybe surrounding players can tell where the shots came from if they notice their teammate go down)."
Rainbow6,3e0797,torchedEARTH,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:48:36 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think the answer is to make them a lot fainter, that way it should just come down to changing colours rather than trying to program additional variables into every round to track what surface(s) it has passed through."
Rainbow6,3e0797,sniperwhg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:00:10 2015 UTC,"Good idea. If you've ever watched bullets go through dry wall like on YouTube, you'll see the particles fly out."

Rainbow6,3dz5l0,iceycat,5,Mon Jul 20 20:12:56 2015 UTC,Did....you even watch the live stream tournament from last week? It was the tactics and communication that stumped the CoD and CS GO pros and allowed the R6 casual vets to win. They tried playing the game like CoD and it didn't work. We played like old school and went undefeated and it was ALL about communication.
Rainbow6,3dz5l0,trineroks,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:11:29 2015 UTC,Stumped the CS GO pros   I don't think you realize just how much communication goes into CS GO.
Rainbow6,3dz5l0,iceycat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:29:10 2015 UTC,True I've barely played CS but the competitive pros of these games weren't communicating at all. Potter was the number one ranked female player in the world at CS and she kept lone wolfing it. Same for the guys that were used to CoD
Rainbow6,3dz5l0,trineroks,0,Tue Jul 21 12:49:26 2015 UTC,"I've... never heard of Potter to be honest.  When I think of the CS GO pro scene I think of players like Olofmeister, JW, Flusha, Pasha, Get_Right, KennyS, Hiko, etc. And there is a huge amount of coordination.   Maybe potter was lumped together with the CoD pros? Didn't feel too comfortable with talking to them? Who knows. But you are horribly mistaken if you're implying CS GO is a run and gun shooter akin to CoD."

Co-op was more fun for the multiplayer aspects to me and I have no interest in it for Siege.  What does this game offer me?

Rainbow6,3dx13l,Quwertzuiop96,4,Mon Jul 20 07:30:44 2015 UTC,"After you had the chance to play the game in its latest version what are your impressions concerning ""lethality""? Will veteran R6-player be happy with it? How does the weapon handling/recoil feel? Do you think the moving speed especially side-strafing speed is tweaked now?  Are there any plans about options to remove parts of the HUD (because to my it still seems a bit cluttered)? Additionally will there be an option to disable friendly-player-outlines?  Last question: Could you become friends with the Doc-Operator during the week? :D Personally I still don't like this magic stimpistol, primarily the possibility for Doc to revive himself.   Btw: Great job during the livestream, really enjoyed watching your team ""seizing the tactical advantage"" :D."
Rainbow6,3dx13l,LuckerNo1,2,Mon Jul 20 07:34:37 2015 UTC,"I can answer some of these since they played the same build that was at E3.  Lethality - I didn't feel it was on par with something like RvS, but it is not where players are bullet sponges either.  Overall the lethality is not a major concern for me.   Weapon Handling/Recoil - Feels pretty good.  Though the differences between weapons isn't very noticeable, at least compared to RvS.  Movement Speed - I like the pace they have it set at currently.  I didn't feel like sidestrafing was too fast.  The once issue is it seems like the 3rd person animations don't match the actual speed of your movements.  The animations seem faster than your are actually moving and make it feel like you are running in mud.  HUD - HUD elements can be turned off if you want and can be a server wide setting in custom matches.  The extent at which you can do this has not been discussed publicly so far."

Rainbow6,3duh40,Pugnator48,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:10:46 2015 UTC,I had an idea of a small flyable drone thats the same size as the ground drone but faster. It probabaly wouldn't be able to hover by itself so it would have to be landed somewhere but it would be pretty hard to hide.
Rainbow6,3duh40,geofurb,0,Sun Jul 19 17:18:19 2015 UTC,"That would be really cool! Like a special recon operator. A more recon-oriented, less combat-oriented Twitch."
Rainbow6,3duh40,idlehand,2,Mon Jul 20 00:19:12 2015 UTC,"I liked the heli being a part of the scouting at the beginning. Certain operators would be in the heli with binoculars or a scope checking to see where boards may be going up. It would be in the air every round, so if it were or weren't used as an insertion, the defenders wouldn't know. It would just fly overtop the house every time the round is beginning regardless if it were used as an insertion or not."
Rainbow6,3du1ke,tylerdurdin1,3,Sun Jul 19 13:43:34 2015 UTC,"Currently, the weapon selection is tied to the operator you choose. So, it's not possible to use all of the available primary weapons with a specific operator."
Rainbow6,3du1ke,DL-Z_ftw,2,Sun Jul 19 14:04:27 2015 UTC,"Also, the primary weapons and secondary weapons are also tied to CTUs, for example, you won't be able to mix a GSh-18 (which is on the Spetsnaz loadout) with the UMP-45 (which is on the FBI-SWAT Loadout) when choosing the GSG-9 Recruit."
Rainbow6,3du1ke,Djaquitchane,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:17:07 2015 UTC,"Isn't there a recruit operator that you can choose equipment for, including weapons?"
Rainbow6,3du1ke,trunglefever,2,Sun Jul 19 20:19:32 2015 UTC,"Yes but you have to choose one of the CTU teams (GIGN, FBI, etc.) as a base."
Rainbow6,3du1ke,tyhopkin,0,Mon Jul 20 05:12:43 2015 UTC,"In the E3 build (latest we were shown), it looks like it's still locked so you have 2-3 weapons to pick from per operator. Doesn't look like they're changing on that."
Rainbow6,3dvk8b,ScotOfTheDay,2,Sun Jul 19 21:58:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, usually e-sports only happen on one platform for games and the devs have already confirmed they built the game around PC, basing ourselves on that (on the fact that the release tournament will probably be on PC as well, same way the Road to Montreal was on PC) there are chances the console scene will not be as interesting as the PC scene.  Also, PC competitive players are longing for a new FPS since BF4 is boring now and CS:GO may not fit everyone (and BFH was sadly dead on release), so they may jump on R6S the same way everyone left the CoD ship when BF3 released... or may not. Time will tell."
Rainbow6,3dvk8b,Djaquitchane,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:33:43 2015 UTC,I think you will get more teams/clans playing this game than individuals. I have already got two teams ready to go for the game coming out. I also think that mlg and the likes will pick this game up and turn the competition side of it big.
Rainbow6,3dvk8b,sbatt016,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:06:12 2015 UTC,"The game will be the same on all formats. If you (understandably) don't want to take your chances with randoms, and you want to guarantee tactical play with communication, you will be able to find like-minded players through resources such as the official forums and this subreddit - whatever your platform of choice."
Rainbow6,3dvk8b,MADEWITHROBOTS,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:36:50 2015 UTC,Why not switch to pc?  Sure the upfront cost is more but the pros far out weigh the cons
Rainbow6,3dvk8b,hockeymaster55,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:01:31 2015 UTC,I've already looked into getting a gaming pc but the cost is way to far out of my price range.(A gaming pc that can run siege)
Rainbow6,3ds9lk,luke2269,4,Sat Jul 18 23:36:29 2015 UTC,"I have never seen Communication needed so much in a game before. Team Tacticool was in sync with one another. When I was watching the other team, I didn't really see any communication. I'm not the best with communication on the fly, but I will try my best to practice before the game comes out. ""He is on the stairs with the one building to your left kinda"" That is me when I talk. That is really the only thing that I suck at in games, communication."
Rainbow6,3ds9lk,ChernoAlpha_Mk1,2,Sat Jul 18 23:51:58 2015 UTC,"It's the DotA of FPS, man. Teamwork is golden."
Rainbow6,3ds9lk,geofurb,3,Sun Jul 19 05:12:23 2015 UTC,"Indeed! They have revolutionized the FPS genre by bringing in the ""operator system"" and this level of destruction. You have to be so much careful in choosing an operator.  It's so exciting when team-work is in play and you hear stuff like:   ""Do we have Sledge? Open up the wall here!"" ""They have reinforced it? Oh, we have lost Thermite!"" ""They are in the basement... OK, check the traps... Make sure we can get down!"""
Rainbow6,3ds9lk,DL-Z_ftw,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:06:54 2015 UTC,Yes!! It's phenomenal. Completely beats the previous min-max system's ass as far as tactical potential goes.
Rainbow6,3ds9lk,geofurb,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:26:17 2015 UTC,"The communication was on point the whole stream. Team reubinited was a clear example of poor communication. In fps a big part of communication is calling out locations, learning location/room names or unique indicators. Team reubinited would say ""on the stairs"" and another team member would say ""which ones"". Need more precise info then that."
Rainbow6,3ds9lk,ChernoAlpha_Mk1,2,Sun Jul 19 00:19:01 2015 UTC,I happy callouts will be beside the compass at the bottom of the screen. I wonder how many people are going to use it to their advantage. The first thing I'm going to do is learn all the callouts with some friends with each map.

Rainbow6,3ds9lk,DL-Z_ftw,2,Sun Jul 19 00:38:14 2015 UTC,"...Thought it watching the stream, Looks like The Lucarian didnt want to high five Deosl and left him hanging.  Deosl did play it cool.  Probably Luacarian was a bit surpsised with that round like everyone.  Best ""advertisment"" so far for r6 siege. Communication, suspense, action and a lot of fun."
Rainbow6,3ds9lk,Deosl,3,Sun Jul 19 15:21:16 2015 UTC,nothing made me happier than seeing a tactical approach trump the usual COD one man army attack. Was one of the best streams in a long time.

Compact Killer got like 7 kills in one match alone (don't remember his score board in the other 2 matches) xyber got some pivotal kills that maybe weren't as high but we're pretty important. Desol was a great team captain and no slouch himself in kills. I only had a handful of kills but I'm particularly proud of doing the rappel flank and blitzing Potter as well as a few other plays plus I coordinated most of the team Intel that helped others get some kills or at least avoid some deaths. Lucarian was awesome especially with that one quad kill, but it was really a team effort all around. You can't carry a team by yourself in this game, you have to be working together and communicating or else you don't stand a chance!"
Rainbow6,3dpp25,Simi510,3,Sat Jul 18 13:56:28 2015 UTC,"Compact killer had 8-0 the first match, he must be one of the most skilled player I've played with.

Rainbow6,3dpzvd,Korrak,8,Sat Jul 18 09:05:27 2015 UTC,"You have no idea how much they're listening to the community. Many of the devs are on the reddit or the forum like all the time following what we think about the game. Livinpink and Electr1cpanda's roles are to be Ubi devs that act as a bridge between the community and the developers. The Alpha, this whole last week, the Beta and the support post launch are all about the community. They changed things in the game because of the Alpha feedback,  there are things that will change as a result of our time giving them feedback this week as well.   I just want to pass along to you how seriously the dev team takes things from the community. They truly do value and hear the community's voice. That's not just what I think, I saw it with my own eyes and heard it when they talked about community feedback and concerns."
Rainbow6,3dpzvd,iceycat,4,Sat Jul 18 12:45:18 2015 UTC,I think they've done a stellar job with the community feedback. I don't think I've ever seen devs listen to the criticism and take on board the feedback as well as the Rainbow 6 team have done.

The RS Siege alpha, some months ago, felt exactly like a ""lets make some fast money""-shooter without any difficult parts (like CoD).  I really hope the devs will continue to make a good competetive shooter. What i saw in the twitch stream yesterday seems like the right way."
Rainbow6,3dpzvd,iceycat,3,Sat Jul 18 13:50:45 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't view the Alpha in that light. That was never meant as a representation of the final build. That was a sandbox put together with one purpose, letting the community give some feedback on some elements they wanted to allow us to try and test out. Based on that feedback they made those changes. What you were seeing was one of many ""draft"" builds."
Rainbow6,3dpzvd,t_n_x,4,Sat Jul 18 14:05:38 2015 UTC,"Yes exactly it was a real alpha version, never a big publisher let you play such a rough version of their AAA game, no texture, sound placeholder, limited gameplay, no post-processing  ...  but sadly, at the end, youtube coms and forums are full of ""lol downgrade"", ""lol bad graphics"", ""lol no tactic"", ""lol call of duty"", ""lol it's a beta, nothing will change"" ..."
Rainbow6,3dpzvd,geofurb,2,Sat Jul 18 17:10:00 2015 UTC,"i really liked that there was an alpha, because its damn important to let the community see the game way before release (especially in competetive shooters). See dota2 or csgo as a negative example. It sucked hard at released, but see what csgo is now.

Apparently Mute's Jammer doesn't affect the floor above it. Not cool but it's k since breaching from over is a lot of danger. Team Tacticool kicks ass, gg guys I expected no less <3 Noticed a whole bunch of accessories, including some kind of side grip, a green triangle laser sight, as well as a laser pointer, EOTech scope is in there too. It seems like you can mix and match scopes and the little thing inside the scope (triangle, dot and such) Seems like you can move drones after the drone phase The Flash grenade actually makes textures white for a moment, interesting approach Seems like they made the ""throwable items"" work a lot better with environment such as barricades and broken walls, that's a huge improvement (During Alpha, throwing grenades through anything was a Russian Roulette, crossing finger for it not to bounce back to you) Nerf Team Tacticool pls Catching out Attackers on their way to the the objective building is still to easy imo When enemies enter the ""Zone"" in the ""Secure zone"" mode, a message shows up saying ""objective is getting contested"" that's kinda bad. I think the messages that show up in the middle of the screen are too big/too attention catching, just my point of view but I wouldn't mind seeing them a bit smaller and/or discreet Seriously do something about Tacticool Drones appear to be bigger Andrew ""Super cool Beard"" Witts confirmed there won't be any Bolt Action Rifles, he also said there would be semi auto rifle, the 417 and another one... which we already know of ! The Dragunov SVU ! so there won't be any other semi auto rifle I guess.

Rainbow6,3dnfam,geofurb,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:55:34 2015 UTC,"They weren't brought in because they were pros, they were brought in because they love the game! That's what our community is about! ""Potter"" (team ReUbinited's captain) just won ESWC CS:GO, I believe."
Rainbow6,3dnfam,Redredred123,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:00:30 2015 UTC,"ESWC CS:GO   In the ""Womens"" league.. which no offense is like WNBA and gets crushed by any Top 10 ""All Gender"" CSGO team..  Also they should have brought in a PREMADE Tier 1 TEAM that's excited! That'll give them some feedback on how ""Pros"" will play. And I assume the Reddit Mods give them the fan perspective"
Rainbow6,3dnfam,geofurb,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:04:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not offended by sexism; I'm disappointed by it. ;)  Regardless, they brought in some dedicated community members who know the eSports world AND know Rainbow/Siege. Listening to what these guys had to say when we were talking to devs, they made the right call. If anything, I'm the one who had no credentials!"
Rainbow6,3dnfam,iceycat,2,Sat Jul 18 04:14:31 2015 UTC,"The perspective of an ""everyman"" player is plenty of credential and is super important."

Rainbow6,3dnfam,Redredred123,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:49:48 2015 UTC,"Sexist by definition is having a gender segregated league. This is paricularily the case when there are no physical/genetic/safety reasons for seperating the genders.  What I said is fact in terms of where they rank overall among genders. And how Potter played is a fact, watch the livestream and tell me I'm wrong. How many reinforcements during prep stage did she put up per game? Did she do the only accidental teamkill during prep stage or not? Did she whine about wanting mute then demand mute after a dif player took it? Did she try to fight against multiple shooter while solo 3 floors apart from her team, expose hersef and got killed/flanked? How many enemies she did spot and call out from the cams after she died?  Geofurb your fine, you repped the normal gamer. If they brought you in for Pro feedback, I'd probably be pissed at you too, it's not gender specific. They chose to stream Potter so I can only comment on her.   I hope they don't take their feedback as ""pro feedback"", they should get legit feedback from esports csgo teams, I'm sure one of the Top 10 is a fan.."
Rainbow6,3dnfam,geofurb,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:18:54 2015 UTC,"Athletics are segregated because of biology, eSports are segregated because of sociology; girls get a ton of flak in the gaming community, and it's shit. :/ Potter played like an FPS pro all week, but Rainbow is more than FPS. It's like a half-dota hybrid that requires tons of tactical thinking, and you could FEEL what was missing in our team when we played. Until I watched the stream and heard the TactiCool mics, I thought it'd take a ton more practice to get that, but it's more of a mindset.  Tl;dr It's totally tactical and soooooooo awesoooooome, but also give Potter and the other pros a break. We're all Rainbow fans first; what we're billed as is what people will recognize us as, not what Ubi picked us for."
Rainbow6,3dnfam,geofurb,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:32:08 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, you don't have to be Pele to know how Pele feels about soccer, and what parts of the game are important to Pele; you just have to be from that world. eSports is a culture."
Rainbow6,3dnfam,geofurb,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:42:26 2015 UTC,"Whoops! I should clarify, the 10 people competing were brought in primarily to give feedback on the game and try to make sure it's on the right track with regards to the gamers, so they can make it a title that people are loyal to. They want to support this game post-launch, which is really unusual for Ubi, but they're super dedicated to that concept, hence the brain trust."
Rainbow6,3dnfam,JonathanRL,6,Sat Jul 18 04:17:42 2015 UTC,I agree. Docs pistol should have ONE Charge.

Rainbow6,3dnfam,iceycat,3,Fri Jul 17 19:38:36 2015 UTC,Thanks!  It was awesome!
Rainbow6,3dnfam,kreios86,4,Fri Jul 17 20:16:18 2015 UTC,"So any word on open weapon selection or are they still keeping it locked down? Same goes for armor selection, it still being locked down? They are the main points for if I end up getting the game or not. If it isnt as customizable as they said it was than its a no go with me with a huge portion of the tactical elements removed from the game. Even with the live stream I'm not seeing as much Tactical Involvement as was with RvS and before."
Rainbow6,3dnfam,geofurb,3,Fri Jul 17 21:08:20 2015 UTC,A group of Raven Shield vets just TROUNCED 4x pro gamers and a random. That's about as tactical as it gets!!
Rainbow6,3dnfam,kreios86,5,Fri Jul 17 21:53:57 2015 UTC,"Yes on the one day lol. Im not saying it has NO tactical elements, just not as much as the previous titles."
Rainbow6,3dnfam,geofurb,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:24:25 2015 UTC,On the one day and all week. I was on that losing team. ;)
Rainbow6,3dnfam,geofurb,0,Sun Jul 19 19:23:06 2015 UTC,"I hear you. I felt the same way earlier. I'm of a different mind now. I think to really appreciate how deep it is, you have to learn a 5v5 ""hero"" game like League of Legends or DotA. (My experience was Heroes of Newerth.) There's a metagame that wasn't there, or wasn't nearly so developed, before operators. It's a game-changer."
Rainbow6,3dnfam,capedcrusader93,2,Sat Jul 18 01:57:25 2015 UTC,I can see where you are coming from. I think the issue is that fans of the Rainbow Six series weren't exactly expecting a game with MOBA elements. I can understand why a lot of long-time Rainbow Six fans would feel annoyed with the limitations that the operator system has.  The whole idea of having to race to pick a certain operator doesn't exactly sound fun to me. They really shouldn't have claimed that there would be a ton of customisation when there clearly isn't.
Rainbow6,3dnfam,petracat09,3,Sat Jul 18 12:57:14 2015 UTC,"The race to pick operators will have to be managed it's true. One of the reasons I'm looking forward to hearing more about is the match making and reporting system.   But as a long time League player, I can tell you that while there are people who just auto lock and don't talk, there's often more times where folks communicate in lobby, attempting to balance their team comp before locking in.   We just have to hope the devs will provide a system that allows us as a community to pull up the great communicating team mates and push down the autolock/troll teammates."
Rainbow6,3dnfam,capedcrusader93,3,Sat Jul 18 16:36:40 2015 UTC,"I really hope that players will realise that communication is key in this game.  The problem is that a lot of people who plan on playing this game might not have any experience with a MOBA. You have a background in LOL so the operator system probably doesn't seem too bad to you because you are used to that type of thing. However, the people I know who were looking forward to this game aren't MOBA players, and they were completely turned off once they found out about the operator system."
Rainbow6,3dnfam,petracat09,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:33:09 2015 UTC,"What do you think would help those players? Genuinely interested.   Would it help seeing more streams like Fri during Beta where we can see teamwork variety and issues? More YouTube videos of operator breakdown? Just plain old discussion from folks about pros and cons?   I agree communication will be huge though. I also play a lot of Ghost Recon Phantoms where having a team of all Recon or all Support will present a lot more problems than solutions. Frequently in lobby folks will say ""more <insert missing class>?"" - sometimes happens sometimes doesn't. It's just another example, but I can imagine there's others of class based shooters."
Rainbow6,3dnfam,capedcrusader93,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:23:42 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I'm not really sure what would help those players. Maybe an in depth breakdown of how the operators work.  Most of the people I know pretty much have their minds made up. Maybe when the devs finally release information about customisation they will change their mind."
Rainbow6,3dnfam,petracat09,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:48:23 2015 UTC,"Mmm, more in depth than what the team has been putting on youtube so far?  People who have turned off to it permanently are not likely to budge to be honest. We can only hope they check out some streams/videos and come try it out ""for the heck of it."" ;)  I'm looking forward to beta and all the in depth analysis work from folks. :)"
Rainbow6,3dnfam,geofurb,0,Tue Jul 21 17:30:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely understand you. I suggested a fix for the ""race to pick an operator"", whereby you have a 10 second grey-out of all operators you've already played in this match at the beginning of operator select, so everyone gets to play the Operator they want, but also if the whole  team wants one guy to keep playing Mute, he can. Hopefully it makes it into the game or first patch."
Rainbow6,3dnfam,capedcrusader93,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:37:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah they will definitely need to do something to make it fair to players.   Honestly, I'm just really disappointed in the lack of customisation. I just feel like the operator system restricts the player way too much."
Rainbow6,3dnfam,geofurb,0,Sat Jul 18 18:08:59 2015 UTC,"Nah, man. It's more meta game, not less. Think LoL."
Rainbow6,3dnfam,iceycat,3,Sat Jul 18 21:01:46 2015 UTC,"Still not a fan of the LoL comparison. Special ability, fine whatever but weapons and other loadouts should be open like they always have been. Just not a fan of being pigeon holed into a pre selection."
Rainbow6,3dnfam,capedcrusader93,4,Sat Jul 18 23:23:46 2015 UTC,"Completely agree with you. I'm fine with each operator having their own unique gadget, but I don't understand why they don't just have an open selection for weapons. At the very least, give the recruit a completely open selection."
Rainbow6,3dnfam,geofurb,-1,Sun Jul 19 03:18:46 2015 UTC,"Understood. But it's part of the vision, you got that right from the horse's mouth. Gotta move with it and look to see how best to make a great tactical experience out of that. (And c'mon, play some League of Legends, DotA 2, or Heroes of Newerth!)"
Rainbow6,3dnfam,geofurb,0,Sun Jul 19 04:44:23 2015 UTC,"It's crazy how much we see things the same as the rest of the community. Where we're at now is, ""We can't change the vision, but we can tweak it to best fulfill  the community's desire for a tactical, competitive game that makes you think like an early Rainbow Six game."""
Rainbow6,3dnfam,geofurb,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:39:04 2015 UTC,"I think it's a balance feature. This seems to draw a lot of inspiration from League of Legends, which stings a bit if you're used to min-max'ing."
Rainbow6,3dnfam,kreios86,3,Fri Jul 17 21:20:07 2015 UTC,"'Balance Feature' is a cop out. Seriously is as Min Maxing had little to do with FPS Balance. It was more about, alright whats the reset times on this spread, what 'random' set of spread does this gun have etc. The biggest portion of any of that which could even be a segway to Min Maxing was ROF vs DMG per round which would inherently set a DPS. There is zero reason, Zero, for there not to be an open weapon selection."
Rainbow6,3dnfam,brotrr,3,Fri Jul 17 21:24:25 2015 UTC,"Coming from Dota 2 and similar games and in turn being more tolerant of it, I think the operator system makes each operator unique and offers different playstyles at least. I think if we had full customization, players would eventually gravitate towards the ""best"" load outs and everyone would play fairly similarly."
Rainbow6,3dnfam,petracat09,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:33:59 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Having operators with specific load outs means you can play and tinker within some interesting limits that encourages creative thinking from time to time. Eventually we're going to get Ash Builds or Castle Builds from people who have crunched the calculations, and then someone will experiment or the devs will react and it'll go in a new direction. You'll have to really know an operator in and out."
Rainbow6,3dnfam,geofurb,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:45:32 2015 UTC,This isn't a classical FPS. Look at it more like LoL meets Raven Shield with crazy destruction and positional audio.
Rainbow6,3dnfam,geofurb,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:55:39 2015 UTC,"The best explanation I got is that ""Recruit"" class is a ""bridge"" from the FPS system you know to the Operator system."
Rainbow6,3dnfam,III2RUFFIII,3,Fri Jul 17 21:58:35 2015 UTC,Love to see pro teams get their asses handed to them...Way to go Team Tacticool!!!
Rainbow6,3dnfam,Djaquitchane,4,Fri Jul 17 18:43:15 2015 UTC,Best part of the match was    These guys are casuaaaals
Rainbow6,3dnfam,Redredred123,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:10:48 2015 UTC,"We're casual man! Lol. It's not our mad FPS shooting skills that came out on top, it was superior communication coordination and tactics. It was a TON of fun!   Tacticool killed it. But I don't think it was a ""Pro Team"", it was 5 random Popular Twitch COD players?"
Rainbow6,3dnfam,iceycat,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:59:52 2015 UTC,"No, this was not a pro ""team"" that always plays together, rather it was a team composed of pro and competitive ""players"" within their respective games. With the exception of Geofurb of course who was just one of us fellow redditors. Both teams had the identical exposure to the game. Both teams played simultaneously throughout the course of the week regardless of game type or mode, so there were no unfair advantages. Both teams also experienced some glitches, but I think they got maybe slightly more than we did. It just really came down to a different approach in play styles and coordination. I will tell you, the other team is by far the superior in raw shooting skills."
Rainbow6,3dnfam,torchedEARTH,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:28:45 2015 UTC,I guess with a R6 game raw shooting skills ain't enough though... :)

EDIT: Sorry to have to say this....but evidently TheLucarian doesn't have much experience with FPS games? Sights are never up, especially when there are threats nearby. Sees a teammate go down, runs over to revive him without first eliminating the threat, and gets killed."
Rainbow6,3dnfam,iceycat,4,Fri Jul 17 18:20:16 2015 UTC,"We're casual man! Lol. It's not our mad FPS shooting skills that came out on top, it was superior communication coordination and tactics. It was a TON of fun!"
Rainbow6,3dnfam,brotrr,2,Fri Jul 17 20:24:44 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm critical but it DID look like a lot of fun. Any chances you guys are going to write up on your impressions of the game? Very excited to hear what you guys thought about it.

Rainbow6,3dnfam,brotrr,2,Fri Jul 17 20:53:31 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I completely disagree. You NEVER put your sights down in real life in a CQB environment when you're in close contact with the enemy. Obviously it's a video-game so it's different, but the general principle applies. If you need to focus on such a big area that you need your sights down to be, as you say, ""situationally aware"", then you're in a bad spot and exposed to way too many angles of fire."
Rainbow6,3dnfam,geofurb,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:00:03 2015 UTC,"Disagree! I'm not god, you don't have to apologize for that! Personally, I thought this dynamic felt way better than the ""flat-perspective"" of other shooters. Though unrealistic, it felt solid in the game. (Maybe Lucarian can tell you better about the feel, since he kicked our asses!)"

Rainbow6,3dmpik,CookieDoughCooter,2,Sat Jul 18 03:20:05 2015 UTC,"Damage is actually pretty similar to alpha. Alpha was really deadly, you just didn't realize how many of your bullets missed. Recoil is higher now, and people move slower, which means precision is more important and people die faster. Bob-and-weave (strafe dancing) no longer lets you dodge bullets.  Check out the stream.

Rainbow6,3dnatl,tyhopkin,2,Sat Jul 18 03:25:11 2015 UTC,"Nice summary.  Lot of great questions.  Add in there the extent of customization. Is it Operator specific?  Meaning can only specific Operators attach, for an example, a red dot?"

Rainbow6,3dnatl,petracat09,2,Tue Jul 21 00:09:56 2015 UTC,Super NDA.
Rainbow6,3dnatl,Deosl,3,Fri Jul 17 22:09:17 2015 UTC,"Awww, seems a little rough to offer us the opportunity to ask questions and then not be able to answer them cus of NDA.  100% understandable, but bummed. :/"
Rainbow6,3dnatl,petracat09,2,Sat Jul 18 01:57:02 2015 UTC,"We can basically only confirm/elaborate stuff from the e3 build and what's been publicly seen.  I know it blows, but that's how things work. I was really not expecting them to be that transparent with us during our visit."
Rainbow6,3dnatl,geofurb,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:08:10 2015 UTC,I completely get it and it's wonderful how open the team was (although I expected nothing less after E3's experience with them!). I'm happy they brought you all up and I know you've all been tracking everyone's concerns here so you represented us all well in discussions. :)
Rainbow6,3dnatl,JonathanRL,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:56:06 2015 UTC,"NDA is tight, so I can't talk about anything I know... But I don't know about the defenders out of the area thing. I like that feature; flanking happens a TON inside the structure. Definitely check out the recording of the recent stream for that. It's so hardcore.   Barbed wire doesn't hurt either team, just makes noise and slows you down.  Strafe speed is reduced in the build you saw in the stream today. No more bob-and-weave!  The ""objective"" is there to focus and direct the action. It does a great job of it. Don't forget TDM Hostage!   Also, I literally just told a dev I like outlines. The dimmer E3 outlines are perfect.  Definitely spotted some sights and a laser today in the stream."
Rainbow6,3dnatl,geofurb,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:16:01 2015 UTC,Let us hope the Hostage can be moved in future modes.
Rainbow6,3dnatl,JonathanRL,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:33:03 2015 UTC,"I felt the same way earlier, but hearing devs talk about their internal tournaments, that's just gonna get your hostage in a corner, covered in barbed wire and surrounded by placeable shields."
Rainbow6,3dnatl,geofurb,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:35:52 2015 UTC,"That happened a lot in the Alpha where the Hostage could not be move. If the Hostage can be moved, at least there will an option.   I would also like to see the Hostage having a good AI, like the original trailer - maybe even attempting an escape if ungarded."
Rainbow6,3dnatl,JonathanRL,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:38:10 2015 UTC,"It's a lot to ask for hostage AI this close to release. And keep in mind, how well someone can block off the Hostage gets WAY, way worse if they can put him in a corner. I think when you see more of the PvP (what modes have you seen so far?), you're not gonna give moving the Hostage another thought."

Rainbow6,3dmr6w,capedcrusader93,6,Fri Jul 17 15:10:28 2015 UTC,"They said there will be some weapon customization, but did not implement into the Alpha or E3 builds.  To what extent, no one knows.  My worry is that it will be Operator specific (like everything else).  Meaning only certain Operators will be able to equip a red dot, others will only be able to use scopes, etc.  Same for other attachments as well.    I honestly don't see how they could claim that Siege will have more customization options than ever before in a R6 title.  If anything it is the least."
Rainbow6,3dmr6w,tyhopkin,3,Fri Jul 17 17:47:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm concerned about the weapon customisation being operator specific as well.  I don't understand how they can claim that either. Apart from weapons, it seems like we won't be able to customise operators at all, Which is the complete opposite of what was stated."
Rainbow6,3dmr6w,JohnnyTest91,3,Fri Jul 17 17:54:14 2015 UTC,"It's the one question I ask under every post and video the make (well, at least under some)  In a tactical shooter, customisation seems so important for me. I wished they'd do something like Warface has. Sort of ingame live customisation. Also I wished there would be deeper customisation like changing buttstocks affecting speed and mobility or frontgrips changing recoil etc. blabla. And character customisation would be so cool. Just be able to change anything and everything (gloves, boots, bliblablub, why not?)"
Rainbow6,3dmr6w,JonathanRL,3,Sat Jul 18 07:34:10 2015 UTC,"The blog post implied that character customization would be in the game, but so far we haven't seen any. I just want to know if it's in the game or not."
Rainbow6,3dmr6w,JonathanRL,3,Sat Jul 18 07:45:47 2015 UTC,"Still incoming. They have not shown it yet, nor has it been available to the players since they want people to play, not fiddle with the weapons.   But yes, I also wonder how they are going to beat Vegas 2 on that score. Me and Vegas 2 did not see eye to eye in a lot of things but the customization was a dream."
Rainbow6,3dmr6w,Deosl,3,Fri Jul 17 15:58:13 2015 UTC,"I liked the customisation a lot too. The blog post implies that we will be able to customise our own operator. I understand that they want people to play the game and not worry about fiddling around with other stuff, But I would really like the devs to provide some clarification. seeing as the game releases in just under 3 months, I don't think it's asking for too much."

(It was crazy to see how many people knew me and the mods from our reddit nicks.) They're anything but disinterested in what we've got to say, and they're totally receptive. They'd be posting all over the reddit if they felt like they could say stuff, but they could only ever give you half-answers, and that's kinda disappointing to them. Straight-up, they're great guys.  This HBS issue came up a lot. Hell, I brought it up a lot. We're all under NDA, so we can't tell you the result of any of those discussions, but this came up a lot. I mean, a lot. I wouldn't harass support about it; these guys know what's what. If it's getting fixed, it's getting fixed. If it isn't... they track stats, so it'll show up as a problem in beta, and they'll get on that. (And I mean they track stats. These guys know how to crunch their numbers.)"

Rainbow6,3dlag0,Leo-H-S,-1,Fri Jul 17 18:53:21 2015 UTC,"Lol, Evolve failed because it was a DLC shitfest that didn't allow for any balance.  I'm not sure what you're trying to prove here.

Rainbow6,3dlag0,Djaquitchane,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:08:52 2015 UTC,"Most of Evolve's Balance issues originated from the lack of communication between the Human players. Similarly, I found the CT side in this games alpha to be more of a challenge on offence imo. Will you get outstanding teams from time to time? Absolutely, but you're going to get a ton of idiots that either don't listen, troll, or suck. This is the same issue I have with GTA online' heist system. If one person decides to troll or be an idiot the rest of the team will fail. And you either have to leave and start all over again going through monotonous matchmaking or spend ages trying to complete a mission.  Rainbow Six is literally a commanding squad based game. This is a Rainbow Six with no commands and no squad mates besides online players at all. I could take their being no doors, but no issuing commands entirely? What atrocity is that?  As I said to another poster, we need people on the team that have played and respect Raven Shield's veracity. I just want a classic(But modernized) Rainbow Six Tactical Shooter. Not a CSGO wannabe. It's just more indication of the turn gaming is taking.  Well anyways, I got Fallout 4 even if this does tank."
Rainbow6,3dlag0,Leo-H-S,2,Fri Jul 17 19:05:35 2015 UTC,"Alas, No. There will be no friendly AI.   All I can hope for is that Ubisoft decides this will be their Multiplayer Shooter and then gets to work to do a Raven Shield-esque Game with the Patriots Storyline."
Rainbow6,3dlag0,JonathanRL,8,Fri Jul 17 06:45:35 2015 UTC,"Having no friendly AI is really disappointing. I  don't understand why they decided against it. I don't agree with forcing people to play online to get the full experience.  It seems like the campaign is going to be fairly lacklustre. The game releases in 3 months and we still haven't seen any footage of the campaign, which isn't exactly a great sign. It sucks for people like myself who aren't huge fans of PVP."

Rainbow6,3dikor,n0ra,7,Thu Jul 16 15:44:49 2015 UTC,"Few observations, concerns and questions from the devs regarding the PvP gameplay (we saw in the linked stream - starts at around 45 minutes) on Hereford Base:   So, no doors right? Every time a player passed the doorway, I thought wouldn't it had been great if there was a door there. I would have loved something like this (link) in this game and especially on this map! The ENEMY FOUND OUTSIDE notification when the enemy is outside the main ""siege"" building is logical. But when that notification showed up even when a defender moves an inch outside the covered area seems funny and unbalanced for the defenders. The defenders should atleast be allowed to move in and around the ""siege"" building to sneak up on the attackers. This can be done by having a threshold on the allowed area. How is this ""TDM"" game-mode any different from Hostage Rescue or Bomb Defusal mode? Isn't it like you either have to kill all the other players or defend/ take the objective area? The name ""TDM - Secure Area"" suggests that there will be other modes for TDM as well. So is it that way? Also, is the ""area"" to be secured randomly chosen by the game logic it-self? Why doesn't the ""magical"" barbed wires laid out by defenders hurt the defenders themselves? Nerfing down the movement/ running speed is a good step in making this game more tactical. Please also consider reducing the strafing speed (especially with ADS). Also, climbing on the stairs is still very fast. Don't mind, but the current kill-cam system looks a bit funny and stupid. First, it shows you getting shot down in an ever slow fashion, then it shows your killer (in an ever slow fashion, of course) and then the whole story plays back to you, how you got killed. I know that it's important for you to make the players aware how they got shot down, but what's the point of dragging the whole ""how-he-killed-me"" story, instead of just showing how he killed you.  The kill-cam is also a bit out of sync. Is this intentional or due to the game being in Alpha? The number of available spawn-locations for defenders seem to be somewhat limited. Will there be more options available in the final version? During the livestream (at around 68 minutes) a banner was shown, which says about the game ""Disponible Le 15.09.15"" (meaning Available on 15.09.15). What is that all about? Can a French friend clarify it, please?   I know the game is still under-development and a lot (or maybe not) will be changed in the final version. Also, the main reason to show this gameplay was to get feedback, right? So...  P.S. The map looks great, even with the toned down textures in this Alpha version. Also, I love how the lighting system works in this game when a player moves from outside to an inside location and vice-versa.  P.P.S. Smile... You are on camera! :D"
Rainbow6,3dikor,DL-Z_ftw,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:46:50 2015 UTC,"The barbed wires are fine this way I believe, the same way the mines in other games don't trigger on allies.  About the ""Disponible le 15.09.15"" I think they just plain screwed up and showed an obsolete image.  The spawn points are fine to me, there are only 3 ways to reach the building, the other options I can imagine would only make you spawn closer to the other points, which means you might as well just spawn on these other points."

Rainbow6,3deupa,twinspectregaming,3,Wed Jul 15 19:43:07 2015 UTC,Hello Epi! Question.  What do you like most about Siege at the moment?  And what class do you plan on playing as?  Glad to see you here!
Rainbow6,3deupa,Djaquitchane,3,Wed Jul 15 19:14:45 2015 UTC,"My favorite part about Siege is the destructible environment.  Setting up an amazing defense in the Airplane just to get completely destroyed with a breach above or behind you and having to react immediately is a lot of fun.  I can't wait to get into the Closed Beta with all of you and duke it out!  As far as which class I am going to be playing, the jury is still out.  With more Operators that have yet to be revealed, I don't want to commit to one too early.  I will say that my most played Operator in the Alpha was Ash.  I felt like the ranged breaching charge opened up a lot of different game play options for my team, which made it all the more enjoyable!"
Rainbow6,3deupa,punjistick,0,Wed Jul 15 19:42:40 2015 UTC,"of course you'll say that , but what about the Return to its roots part of the game ? is there ?   because watching and re-watching R6 siege gameplay it seems they are trying to emulate COD/BF and Counter Strike without knowing what Rainbow Six really is"

Rainbow6,3deupa,punjistick,5,Wed Jul 15 20:44:40 2015 UTC,"I played Ghost Recon Phantoms, a tactical third person shooter, for a solid two years before I got hired to work on it. My clan and I put together an undefeated CEVO and ESL run, so we played it a lot to say the least.  Other than that, in my free time I mostly play Arma 3. Breaking Point and Wasteland are my mods of choice.  On console I play Destiny, but that is a distant third."

Rainbow6,3d5rls,bleepblopbloop,3,Tue Jul 14 01:15:10 2015 UTC,"Fun fact: Most operators and military personnel wear the same camo at day than they do at night.  Why?  Because you are rarely in a pure dark environment, and the light that reflects off the ground and buildings around you reflects exactly the same off of the fabric of your ""daytime camo"" shirt.  In fact, you can become more visible by wearing pure black at night.    Black is typically only worn for its psychological affect, and if you aren't sure what the majority color could possibly be (meaning, any color) black is often the best choice which is why the M4 is painted black by default.  That's about the only time however, any other time, you wouldn't wear a ""night time camo"", there's no such thing. (besides a failed Desert Storm American camo, and they came to the same conclusion as the above.)  tl;dr- there's no such thing as night time camo."

Everytime I see some new gameplay I'm impressed by the lighting, especially when it lights up the smoke.   Will there be flashlights? It's something I haven't seen but it would look insane on the night time versions of maps.   I guess you could extend this question to weapon attachments in general. What will we be likely to see in terms of that or are they trying to keep it as minimal as Vegas?"

You can also see the interviews they did of other players as well and they too are positive towards Siege, though I can't imagine a company adding in negative impressions for that type of stuff.    Here is the thing though, when you are there the atmosphere is very energetic and people are very anxious to play a new game.  I always take those interviews with a grain of salt.  It is almost impossible to not have a positive vibe towards a game.  I'm not saying people in the videos are lying just at worst they are caught up in the moment.      As for being paid? No.  In fact all the devs that I got to talk to seemed to go out of their way or at least very careful trying to avoid putting any pressure on people about their opinions.  I also never got any leading questions fishing only for answers they wanted to hear.  All in all they were very professional.  Added  To directly answer your question if those people are telling the truth about Siege, IMO yes, they are.  I think Siege will be a fun game.  I worry about the longevity of the game the most, but we have not seen the entire scope of the game yet."

I also never got any leading questions fishing only for answers they wanted to hear. All in all they were very professional.   I 100% want to agree with /u/tyhopkin on the above as well as being caught in the moment of excitement. You've been dying to play the game, you meet other awesome people who want to play it, you get into match, you have a hell of a lot of fun and then you get to give feedback - the positive is outweighing the negative at that point and to be clear, there was and still is a lot of positive in my mind about this game.  The dev teams and marketing folks I came across were very professional, not at all leading, and were authentic when I voiced concerns. For example, I spoke to Xavier Marquis for a good while about my concerns with match making, trolls, and how they were going to prevent the game from becoming stale after a couple of months given the operator system even with the announcement of randomization of the maps/AI/objective spawn. Those of us there weren't pussyfooting around the issues we have. The first time I ate breakfast with /u/TheLucarian, he and I had a very back and forth about the operator system and our opinions about it. Ubichem was sitting with us discussing the issues and we were all weighing the pros and cons. We were encouraged to give our feedback in whole, not just the good parts.  It's just hard to film and put out to public those conversations. They're nuanced, involve background experiences that are different, and frankly, they're moments in time that don't translate well to a huge audience, particularly ones who are still discovering that there is a Rainbow game coming out. (I know, shocking, but I get them in my twitch chat all the time. XD Don't worry, I'm swift to show them the light.)  So yes, those videos are a hype thing on some levels, but know that there is depth and a lot of substance behind it at least for those I met and talked to. :)   Also, you get so many points /u/III2RUFFIII for using monkey balls. One of my favorite phrases during stream when I don't want to drop all the fbombs I'm holding back. XD"

Rainbow6,3d5cft,TheLucarian,4,Tue Jul 14 02:23:38 2015 UTC,"Remove friendly player outlines. This will make the fear of friendly fire even more of an issue and you will have to ID your targets or use team communication to know where your friends are. At least give you the chance to try gameplay without them and report back.   Select Fire. I said it before, I shall say it again. The military way of doing things is a double tap; that is two or three short shots in rapid succession. That is why some weapons have a burst setting. In Combat, the only real value of fully automatic fire is suppression as it is usually inaccurate. As such, the game needs a viable select fire system where fully automatic gives less accurate fire but more of it, burst (that is a middle ground for the weapons that have it) and single fire; slow - depending on how fast you click the mouse button - but accurate.   Magazines. Do not use a bullet counter, please. Make the reload itself worth something by having you remember how many bullets you have left instead of just spawning a magic and unrealistic number of magazine for every single bullet you have.   Operators from more countries: While this is the new Rainbow, it would be nice to see operators from other countries then the ones currently in the game. If they go for experience and ability, I doubt they would just search those five organisations. I for one welcome the return of Annika Lofqvist !"

Moreover, you'll have to make sure you're not a one trick pony and master several operators in fear of having your favorite one banned.  Remove : Overall free info in that same hypothetical ranked queue or ranked. I understand that visual aids are pretty useful in casual play, but if you play for real, you're going to communicate, you will even have to go check who you killed to tell your mates x or y operator died.

Rainbow6,3cxzpf,kreios86,8,Sat Jul 11 20:08:00 2015 UTC,"To be honest I thought it was a pronunciation error. Then I saywit in writing and I thought a translation error. Then I saw the lead devs say and I thought ""who's the moron that came up with this name?"" Seriously Ubisoft, whoever came up with the name Terrohunt needs to be slapped across the face. It sounds so ridiculous and stupid, and honestly it kinda seems like you are trying to simplify it to be easier to say- since you seem to generally think your fans are stupid. Long story short it sounds dumb and I'm onto ever going to call it by it's real name Terrorist Hunt."
Rainbow6,3cxzpf,Commando2352,5,Sat Jul 11 20:24:29 2015 UTC,"I may be wrong, but I don't think it's to do with political correctness at all (as some are suggesting). I think it's just marketing buzz word type nonsense, and agree that it sounds ridiculous."
Rainbow6,3cxzpf,MADEWITHROBOTS,2,Sat Jul 11 22:01:30 2015 UTC,"Ya I thought it was an pronounciation error as well till a french buddy and I started talking about it and said no as well, and what started my train of thought about it and me posting this.  As for hte PC line of thought, in all honesty its plausible. The world we are in today seems to always be walking on egg shells and it worries me to a point. It wouldnt suprise me at all that this is why they took that path with the marketing. I mean look at the crap they got for patriots and they ended up canning that; though they stated it was because of technical issues and not anything political which I still find shakey at best."
Rainbow6,3cxzpf,iceycat,6,Sat Jul 11 23:19:29 2015 UTC,"I too thought it was a pronunciation error at first. It is rather silly. For what? Six games in franchise history now? More? It's been called ""terrorist hunt"" I for one will continue to call it what it is. NOT ""Terro"" it's ""Terrorist""  Uh-oh, here comes the White Mask Terros..... Doesn't sound very menacing does it?  I think it's a nod to political correctness gone amok. We don't want to ""offend"" anyone or something. That would be my guess. I hope it's not something so silly and frankly weak, but that's the world we live in now. Anybody with controversy needs to be proceeded by trigger warnings and opinion disclaimers. Is this the reason? I don't know for certain, but why else change it when that's what it's been called in the Rainbow Six games for nearly 20 years and replace it with a word? name? term? ( I don't even know) that doesn't even make sense."
Rainbow6,3cxzpf,Djaquitchane,2,Sat Jul 11 21:24:45 2015 UTC,"Ya, I believe that's a part of why they went that way and I hope to God not. I know this little bit is trival to 'worry' about and it just makes me giggle some when I think about it versus what else they 'nerfed' for this game."
Rainbow6,3cxzpf,iceycat,2,Sat Jul 11 23:20:38 2015 UTC,"That may be a delicate subject, we're having problems with terrorists nowadays, all over the world and I'd understand that Ubisoft is a tad hesitant about throwing the word ""Terror(ist)"" around."

Guerillas NOT officially part of a nation's army that carry out clandestine attacks on unsuspecting civilian populations for the sake of making a point regarding their own personal or religious beliefs are in fact-----Terrorists.  Why would we worry about hurting the feelings of people who sneak attack civilian populations with undeclared guerrilla warfare? More importantly, why should we? Murder is wrong. Period. I don't really care about a murderer's feelings being hurt or offended."
Rainbow6,3cxzpf,MADEWITHROBOTS,2,Sat Jul 11 21:29:56 2015 UTC,"This, this and more this. Why should Ubisoft be afraid about hurting the feelings of some insurgents or guerrillas. They are bad people.

Rainbow6,3cxzpf,MADEWITHROBOTS,3,Sat Jul 11 23:21:59 2015 UTC,"It was the MoH reboot (the one before Warfighter) - one faction would have been called 'Taliban', but were renamed 'OpFor' (Opposing Forces) before the game came out."
Rainbow6,3cxzpf,Commando2352,2,Sat Jul 11 23:35:35 2015 UTC,That makes sense. They were naming it after an actually terrorist group. Not only could it had been politically sensitive but there could have been possible repercussions from the Taliban themselves. Not to mention OpFor is an actual term and is used by the military. So the change was good. The change from terrorist to terro doesn't make sense in a political aspect because terrorist groups know they are terrorists by definition. And the public knows that too. Ubisoft was never referring to a certain group with a name like Terrorist Hunt. UBISOFT: We neeeeeeeeed some word on this.

Rainbow6,3cxzpf,bleepblopbloop,2,Sun Jul 12 00:14:38 2015 UTC,"I can understand that. But it comes back to the same thing, why is the public to worked up about upsetting some terrorists that would probably kill them on a moments notice? And if the general outcry is a problem, why make it Terro? Why not insurgent or guerrilla hunt (that last one sounds funny lol)? Or how about TANGO. Tango Hunt. That doesn't sound like some marketing gimmick or mispronunciation, it sounds like something that makes sense."
Rainbow6,3cxzpf,soundlord,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:35:08 2015 UTC,Totally agreed. I do have to wonder if maybe Ubi is doing it just to make the name easier to say? I really think it might just be colloquial speak for no reason other than marketing. Do we have any reason to believe otherwise? They have been doing all they can to make this marketable to everyone. Even the COD kiddies who are going to want a snappy name for everything. Just a thought.
Rainbow6,3cxzpf,Phi03,2,Wed Jul 15 14:14:41 2015 UTC,Just another example of how UBISOFT  doesn't understand the brand they keep changing

Rainbow6,3cxzpf,Commando2352,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:56:50 2015 UTC,I honestly think that so many people are gonna call it terror hunt that there's gonna be a ninja edit within the first few weeks the game's out that changes it.

So whenever I say it, I think of vegetable hunting. facepalm  I want to imagine there's a good reason behind it, but I'm not sure on this one to be perfectly frank. I can't help but picture is that ""Terror"" was said over the phone in a meeting from a French speaking dev team to a USA marketing team and the USA team went, ""Oh, cool! Terro, neat!"" and then by the time the French team saw the mistake, it was too late.  Don't think though this one is gonna change given all the marketing behind it now and frankly, I'm still gonna go vegetable hunting on Sept 24th ;)"
Rainbow6,3cwhwt,DL-Z_ftw,3,Sat Jul 11 10:58:51 2015 UTC,"Excellent post. I think Pulse is a little more balanced now after range nerfs also I believe he IS now on a pulsing scan instead of constant real time. I'm okay with how he's been balanced now.  I worry a bit about Sledge. Think about it, he's equivalent to unlimited breaching charges. His ability is awesome, but he can go around and pound through everything as much as he likes. Maybe requiring multiple hits to knock holes in walls would be better like the first hit makes a gun shot sized hole, next hit is finally enough to make a hole the size that can be walked through. This would give enough time for defenders to possibly react to the breach between swings. It should still be one hit though for barricades as that's just planking, but walls should take more than a single pop.  I don't think nerfing Doc with one or two shots is as effective as allowing his ability to be used as much as he wants BUT making him have to have physical contact with the subject to do it. Give him very fast revives and maybe an extra +10 or+20 hit points returned on revival or something but he's got to be physically touching the person to do it. Also make him lightly armored so he can run quickly to heal people in need (maybe medium armor, but not the heavy he has now) Doc should be more exposed to danger as a result of needing to heal people. Besides ranged revivals are cartoonish and arcady.  I also am a bit concerned by Tachanka. That LMG turret can wreck a whole team if placed in a bottle neck and might make the defenders untouchable. I'll have to reserve judgement on him until I play with that one myself and see."
Rainbow6,3cwhwt,iceycat,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:20:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks man!  If Pulse indeed has a slow pulsing scan now, then he can be considered a bit balanced. Can you confirm?  Regarding Sledge, your idea is good. But I think that the sledgehammer being used up-close to a wall/ barricade exposes him to an attack from the defenders, if they spot him. That's unlike a breaching charge, where you move away from it after planting and you are quite safe.  Agree with you on Doc."
Rainbow6,3cwhwt,iceycat,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:36:44 2015 UTC,"I haven't actually had any hands on time with the game yet but if the animation is such that you must face the wall straight on and you're left standing there vulnerable for a second or two after the swing that would be balancing. From what I've seen though there is no recovery  needed after the swing and the weapon switch is more or less instant. I also don't know for sure but if you can hit the wall from an angle so you're not exposed that would be pretty powerful. I guess I'm not sure what stops Sledge from going around and knocking holes in every non reinforced wall as much as he likes all match long. Don't get me wrong, his concept is cool, I like it, but the gadget switch to weapon is instant I think and there's no swing recovery time, when paired with one hit man size wall breaches.... I'm just a bit concerned he could be abused"

Rainbow6,3ctedi,DL-Z_ftw,8,Fri Jul 10 16:58:18 2015 UTC,"I just think the recruit should be customizable. Choose a name for your recruit, a country of origin (maybe more than just the 5 units that are for the special operators) Choose an armor type with open weapon selection. Choose race/gender maybe hair color and then be able to SAVE the character to a permanent load out for fast selection of your recruit."
Rainbow6,3ctedi,iceycat,2,Fri Jul 10 17:10:34 2015 UTC,"Some nice suggestions there! Fully customizable recruit operators would indeed be cool to have.   Regarding armor type, there should be a trade-off between armor and speed of the character and that trade-off should be clearly noticeable."
Rainbow6,3ctedi,JonathanRL,2,Fri Jul 10 17:15:39 2015 UTC,I think the problem is that if they did this; we would never see any other Operators...
Rainbow6,3ctedi,iceycat,5,Fri Jul 10 18:04:46 2015 UTC,That's fine for those of us that aren't crazy about being limited to the operators. Of course the other solution is just to open up weapon and armor restrictions on ALL operators just leaving their special gadgets to be unique. Again my suggestions are mostly cosmetic. If being able to choose gender race and give yourself a name would be enough to make everybody abandon the operator system then maybe that means those customization features might mean a lot to some people.
Rainbow6,3ctedi,Pest_AWC,6,Fri Jul 10 18:32:23 2015 UTC,"If they did this, nobody would run a server with the lame pre-created Operators.  Honestly, like all previous R6 games, you should have been able to create your own complete character with access to all weapons/gadgets/armor from the beginning.  The entire ""Operators"" thing should just be in single player or co-op for those that want to be restricted to roll playing a premade character, and perhaps as a quick choice for multiplayer for those that don't want to customize a character from scratch.  Seriously, how long are casual gamers going to tolerate Siege Multiplayer when they have to compete against their own team mates in a speed race to click on the favorite Operator with the cool gadget that only they can use?  This is a huge step backwards in R6."
Rainbow6,3ctedi,Commando2352,2,Fri Jul 10 18:00:40 2015 UTC,"I really like the idea of Recruit only playlists.  Gives a more authentic Rainbow Six feel. Also, if Hardcore mode is to be added, it should be done as a server option. NOT a playlist. That way you could either have Hardcore mode with Operators and new gadgets or Hardcore with classic R6 customization. Also adding in certain non op gadgets might be a bit too much to ask for. But I do like the idea."
Rainbow6,3ctedi,mainaym,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:06:46 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, this would just make the operator wayyy OP. then all players would race to take the class. i honestly like the recruit being a last option to think about kind of thing. i think thats what the devs added it for anyway :p"
Rainbow6,3ctedi,iceycat,6,Fri Jul 10 17:41:41 2015 UTC,Well you can already choose their armor and weapons for the recruit. Race/gender/name/etc. is merely cosmetic. I think the special abilities/gadgets might have to be kept generic though. Honestly I would have rather seen a build your own operator than custom prebuilds in the first place.
Rainbow6,3ctedi,kreios86,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:47:25 2015 UTC,"When did they change the armor set up? Cause last it was announced that each country had a particular armor applied to its Recruit.

Rainbow6,3ctedi,iceycat,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:03:20 2015 UTC,"That's what I mean, that by choosing the home unit you can influence the choice of weapons or armor. So long as you don't care what the unit is you potentially can access whatever. Still, why bother with all that, it's a work around for just being open selection, so just make open selection flat out and who cares about the unit specific default."

Rainbow6,3cssq5,ExploTheOne,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:34:05 2015 UTC,"So first off tranquilizer guns have been around for a long time, the only difference between that and what doc uses is most likely it is a straight shot of adrenaline.  If you don't know what effect adrenaline straight up can have on a person, in a sense yeah they could jump right back up and into the fight.  It is obviously not a permanent solution to their issue, but it could allow them to rejoin the battle.  For those that are really pissed off about Doc as well as a ""down but not out"" phase to your health, just cut out the middle man.  What I mean is that the DBNO phase is not a guarantee and the Devs have stated that in the past.  Most of the time people will in fact just straight die.  If a person is downed you can shoot them and finish them off, anyway.  I really think that people are making a huge deal out of something that most likely will not play that big of a role in the gameplay. Remember headshots insta-kill and if you are playing against or with competitive gamers you will wind up dead, not crawling around on the floor.  I admit if Doc wasn't in the game I would be fine with that as well, but I really don't think he will cause that much of a problem.  If he does then they will likely adjust him for the communities sake."
Rainbow6,3cssq5,MRMYSTICIGR,12,Thu Jul 16 16:53:16 2015 UTC,"Considering the audience that Siege is targeting, I cannot imagine many players sticking with Siege Multiplayer for long due to the Operator system.  At some point, you are going to get tired of playing a mostly pre-made and pre-named character that you have to click on first to get.  They need to go back to the Multiplayer system used in all previous R6 games where you created your own character and could choose from all weapons/gadgets.  I want to play as ""Pest_AWC"" and not ""Twitch"".  Oh, and the Doc character is a complete joke and kills any immersion this game had left.  I'm bleeding out by a 7.62 mm bullet hole in my gut and a magic dart shot from across the room gets me all fixed up and back in battle???  Umm...no.  You jumped the shark with this one UBI."
Rainbow6,3cssq5,Pest_AWC,2,Fri Jul 10 17:50:44 2015 UTC,"R6 games where you created your own character and   AHAHAHAHAHAHA , keep dreaming my friend , they don't care about You and Me , they want to target the wrong audience by killing this game   Rainbow Six once knowed for the Father of Squad Based Tactical Shoooter now knowed as the clone of Cod/BF/CounterStrike"
Rainbow6,3cssq5,twinspectregaming,9,Sun Jul 12 15:53:53 2015 UTC,"Can a developer throw some light on Doc operator, regarding:   How have they ""balanced"" it? What is the maximum range of effectiveness and ammo (darts) for the stim pistol? From the trailer it seems like he has atleast two darts. How much health is restored after a revive and whether it is an insta-revive or does it take some time (like it is when one does a ""manual"" revive)? Can he revive him-self with it too? Do the attackers get a similar operator (or one that can ""counter"" it) as well?  Is this gadget even present in the Rainbow Six universe?   I'm asking this as many people will have these concerns regarding him and before all hell breaks loose, its better to address these issues on time.  BTW, the trailer was well-made! Also, the Consulate map looks awesome at day time."
Rainbow6,3cssq5,DL-Z_ftw,10,Fri Jul 10 15:11:41 2015 UTC,"Doc CAN revive himself. I don't like this particular operator. ""Ranged"" healing shouldn't even be on the table. That is such an arcade style mechanic. There are ways to properly balance a medic character and do it right, but NOT ranged medicine. It's silly, it breaks immersion, it belongs in a cartoon, it has the potential to disrupt balance as well. You just drop a guy and from your perspective he just gets right back up and shoots at you some more because he got shot in the butt with a magic medicine dart and you never even necessarily saw the guy that revived him. It's bull crap. My whole problem with Doc is that he's ranged. If he had to go up to the character and do it manually but got bonuses like faster revive time and bring them back with some extra hit points or something that would be fine. The WHOLE problem for me is that he can do it ranged. His gadget switch is fast, he never has to break position to do it, the shot takes less than a second and the operator is back up instantly. I'm sorry, but this needs to be tweaked. That's just my opinion though."
Rainbow6,3cssq5,iceycat,7,Fri Jul 10 16:27:47 2015 UTC,"Agree with you.  Faster and full health ""up-close"" revive would be better suited for this operator, rather than what we have currently."
Rainbow6,3cssq5,DL-Z_ftw,3,Fri Jul 10 16:46:19 2015 UTC,"Even if you kept the hypodermic needle gun but made it as a contact range like a hypo spray from star trek or something where you still have to actually TOUCH the target with it would be fine. Give it a faster revive time, sure, but make the medic go TO the patient!"
Rainbow6,3cssq5,iceycat,3,Fri Jul 10 16:54:40 2015 UTC,"Now, that's a better solution! It won't hurt the devs to reduce the effective range of this pistol to a minimal value."
Rainbow6,3cssq5,DL-Z_ftw,3,Fri Jul 10 17:04:55 2015 UTC,As long as minimal range is none

Montagne looks like the character for me. Love using shields in any shooter. Doc seems he could be balance issue for the game, so maybe 2 darts only. When are we going to see Spetznaz and GSG9? I'm positive that the Spetznaz has an operator with a sniper rifle. Wonder how he is going to fit into the game."
Rainbow6,3cssq5,ChernoAlpha_Mk1,2,Fri Jul 10 15:16:33 2015 UTC,"I'm glad there's another female operator besides Ash. That's cool. Not really any minorities here either. Okay, Castle is black, that's one. I guess one or two operators have some vaguely hispanic sounding last names but they don't really look like they are. No Asian representation? That's too bad though. Of course, you know what would solve that problem? Making a custom character. You should be able to customize recruit and make him a saveable loadout or something. Change his name, country of origin, armor and weapon loadout choose skin color and race/gender and then save that as your character. You should also be able to choose one special gadget to go with it, but I could be flexible on that point. The rest though would be good to have. These operators are cool to a degree, but you really should be able to make at least ONE of your own. The recruit option is still a tad bit too generic."
Rainbow6,3cssq5,iceycat,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:35:04 2015 UTC,"Not a bad Idea. You would maybe have to limit some gadgets that you could use. It could be a different gamemode compared to the one that they already have. Instead of having the operations that you already have, it could be like a training simulator for the recruits (just ideas.) I wonder if they are going to have a training course and firing range in the finally game."
Rainbow6,3cssq5,ChernoAlpha_Mk1,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:02:22 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see a training course and firing range as supplements to the game. You could even make the training course into a mini game of it's own where it would have dozens and dozens of challenges for shooting targets, breaching and assaulting objectives under a certain time limit, etc. This would all be in the training grounds and would be totally optional. but I always enjoyed a robust system of extra things to do like that."
Rainbow6,3cssq5,iceycat,2,Fri Jul 10 18:35:31 2015 UTC,"Be cool to see a training course just for walls. Have every different type of wall that is used in game. Area to test different caliber weapons, Dummies with (light, medium, heavy) armor be hide walls, and multiple walls be hide one another. Maybe even show how much damage you would inflict to the dummies that are stationary or moving be hide walls."

Rainbow6,3csjxr,sonoblink,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:59:57 2015 UTC,The Game and the Novel has very little in common. There used to be Polish Operators in the game so the question is not unvalid. Rainbow is a NATO Unit. Poland is a NATO Country. GROM Operators could very well be sent to Rainbow.   As for OPs initial argument:   As topic says. Those guys are rather popular.   Only in Poland.
Rainbow6,3csjxr,JonathanRL,-1,Fri Jul 10 15:02:55 2015 UTC,the R6 franchise moved away from the novels a long time ago...
Rainbow6,3cqmtm,The_100_dollar_man,9,Fri Jul 10 00:08:48 2015 UTC,"No.  It is exactly the opposite.  You are forced to pick from about 10 pre-named guys that have one special gadget already assigned to them (like Heartbeat Sensor, Sledge Hammer, Magic Health Needle Gun, etc) that is only available to that one Operative.  Only one person can pick each named Operative.  That Operative already has an assigned armor level of low, medium, or high.  At most, you can pick from a couple weapons and grenades, and choose whatever weapon skin you have unlocked.  Also, anyone can choose the Recruit class, and then you can pick from a couple weapons and other things, but none of the gadgets the named Operatives have.  So, if the Operative you like gets taken and you don't like what is left over, you can choose Recruit and make do until you learn to click faster to get the Operative you want.  It is like they went overboard to make sure it wasn't like Vegas.  I hated the non matching team uniforms, balls on custom faces, and pink camo of Vegas, but I didn't want them to take away all customization like they did and force us to use Operatives that are mostly pre-made without all weapons/gadgets to choose from."
Rainbow6,3cqmtm,Pest_AWC,7,Fri Jul 10 02:21:47 2015 UTC,"It was nice to setup each class the way you wanted and just hit which gear you needed for map or mode and not having to panic about someone choosing the operative you need ""not fun"""

Rainbow6,3cqmtm,Deosl,3,Fri Jul 10 08:58:30 2015 UTC,"I think you may want to clarify everything you are ""happy with"" because Siege has taken away practically ALL CUSTOMIZATION which includes the ability to choose from all weapons/gadgets like we could in all previous R6 games.  If you are just happy that we won't have non matching teams with some people wearing pink camo and having cartoon character custom faces, then that is one thing.  Your response makes it sound like you don't want the ability to create your own character with any weapon/gadgets/armor type that you want and like choosing from restrictive pre-made and pre-named Operatives.  I hope that is not the case."
Rainbow6,3cqmtm,Pest_AWC,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:24:58 2015 UTC,"I didn't expect the operator system to be as restrictive as it seems to be.

That just seems ridiculously restrictive."
Rainbow6,3cqmtm,capedcrusader93,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:49:27 2015 UTC,I think it's meant to generate a different kind of game play - you have to use what that operator has and limiting resources makes you flex differently. Not having the OP90 or what have you on each operator makes you innovate I think.

Rainbow6,3cp2w6,tyhopkin,5,Thu Jul 9 23:25:54 2015 UTC,"I don't believe they are completely out of place.  I actually like the concept but I think they did it wrong and put too much focus on where they came from (country and organization).  For me personally I wish they would have followed the ""Operator"" system from the SP parts of the original 3 games. You essentially had a list of Operators with each operator having specific skills.  You could kit them out however you wanted with respect to weapons, attachments, gadgets, armor, etc., but it made sense to equip the explosive experts to deal with explosives (plant/defuse), guys with high marksmanship and awareness to be on the point, etc.  With Siege you are essentially being forced into roles, which isn't a huge deal now.  It becomes a problem when people want to be creative in their tactics when they are tired of doing the same thing over and over, but can't because there is no opportunity to be creative with loadouts."
Rainbow6,3cp2w6,DL-Z_ftw,0,Thu Jul 9 20:53:01 2015 UTC,"There are more and more FPS games that take this ""unique character with his own loadout"" route because it makes for meaningful choices and creates risk (Dirty Bomb or Overwatch to name a couple). I like it."

Rainbow6,3codb1,PartyOnAlec,8,Thu Jul 9 14:00:31 2015 UTC,"My expectation was for a near-future game in which an elite force came up against a domestic terrorist group.  I expected somewhat tactical gameplay, slightly futuristic gadgets, and familiar US locations to fight through.  I expected to be able to customize my weapons, my gear, and a story that moved.  I'm unhappy it was cancelled because I think it explored concepts that are somewhat taboo.  Too many games have us killing Russians, or mercenaries, or militia from Unspecifiedistan.  I was excited to fight against a group that perhaps made me ask questions of myself, who had grounds to be angry and feel wronged, and who were Americans (I still acutely recall how I felt in Spec Ops: The Line, when I was first made to kill US soldiers).  I hope they do explore the universe in future R6 games.  I really do.  Bear in mind that Rainbow Six is based on a Tom Clancy novel - one that I loved and have read several times - and that a strong narrative element belongs in these games.  Am I excited to play Siege?  Sure.  But it doesn't seem much like a Rainbow Six experience to me, and that's what I'd prefer to have."
Rainbow6,3codb1,PartyOnAlec,6,Thu Jul 9 16:25:27 2015 UTC,"I was intrigued by the story and the concept of homegrown terrorism.    For me, not being a big guy on SP, but rather enjoying the MP part of R6, I'm very excited for Siege and I'm glad something positive came out of Patriots."
Rainbow6,3codb1,iceycat,2,Thu Jul 9 17:04:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can totally understand that.  For me, I get the most mileage out of a single-player or co-operative experience, and I especially enjoy AI teammates to whom you can issue orders.  It seems to me like a wasted opportunity that those things are either not the focus, or not included at all, in Siege.  I'm still interested to play it, but I'm not confident that it will scratch my Rainbow Six itch (which I've been scratching lately by playing through R6III and its expansions."
Rainbow6,3codb1,DL-Z_ftw,5,Thu Jul 9 17:45:55 2015 UTC,"Overall, I'm happy with what Siege looks like it could be as compared to Patriots. BUT it looked like Patriots would have had MUCH more focus on a campaign AND it would have had AI team mates to control. Something I wish Siege would have done."
Rainbow6,3codb1,TheLucarian,2,Thu Jul 9 16:06:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they were pushing the AI team mates hard in Patriots. Odd they just chucked it out for Siege."
Rainbow6,3codb1,bleepblopbloop,3,Thu Jul 9 17:04:48 2015 UTC,"Plus, it had working doors! :P"
Rainbow6,3codb1,geofurb,6,Thu Jul 9 19:33:52 2015 UTC,"worse than Vegas/Lockdown yes. no.   Sorry if my responses make me look like an asshat, but I despised the Patriots route for Rainbow Six.  Edit: But great write-up dude!  Edit2: Apparently they kept the logo from Patriots for Siege (last screenshot)... Eeewwww."
Rainbow6,3codb1,tyhopkin,6,Thu Jul 9 14:45:40 2015 UTC,"I'm just glad they went back to FPS only. If not, I would probably not be here today :< I can't say I was overly excited for Patriots with 3rd person cover and press ""X"" to save this puppy strapped with C4. But I am a tad curious as to how it would have been if David Sears would have completed the game.  Thanks! Yeah, it's bound to happen when they've spent 3 years on a project to reuse some of the assets in the next game."
Rainbow6,3codb1,JonathanRL,2,Thu Jul 9 17:02:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, although I was intrigued with the moral choices.  I wish they had spun it off and created a different Tom Clancy game besides rainbow six, possibly another Ghost Recon or even its own game.  The story and moral choices sounded really appealing, just not for an R6 game."
Rainbow6,3codb1,themerovengian,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:35:38 2015 UTC,"Looked like Vegas again. For some reason the footage that I saw reminded me of Psi-Ops, which is NOT a good thing for a R6 game. Siege has me really excited, and I'm thrilled Pats got cancelled; if it hadn't, it might have put the series down for good. Don't really care about singleplayer story."
Rainbow6,3codb1,Aj6627,5,Thu Jul 9 19:39:38 2015 UTC,My burning question about Patriots is why the top 3 or 4 guys got removed from the project.  Even after it was announced UBI said the game was still on track to be released.  Would have loved to have been a fly on the wall in that discussion. ;)
Rainbow6,3codb1,Aj6627,6,Thu Jul 9 17:30:20 2015 UTC,I'll try and get an interview 10 years after the event. So that would be in 2021 :p
Rainbow6,3codb1,sonoblink,3,Thu Jul 9 17:49:38 2015 UTC,"I would love the next game to have the Patriots Story and Moral Choices but Gameplaywise, I am fairly happy it was not released. I rather not see another ""Vegas"" Style Rainbow Game."

Rainbow6,3crfa8,FSX76,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:16:11 2015 UTC,"Don't sweat, there is a PS4 version, they haven't shown it since I guess Ubisoft are teaming up with Microsoft to promote their games.  You can try the Closed Beta on PS4 as well.  Resolutions I'm unsure, but it was reported that Siege will be 60 FPS on all concoles."
Rainbow6,3crfa8,Deosl,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:08:20 2015 UTC,"Ok, that explains the Vegas 1 and 2 announcement (in the context of the new X1 backwards compatibility) at E3. Although that didn't seem as the usual big 3rd party deals like CoD, Destiny and Battlefront for example. We'll have to wait and see I guess..."
Rainbow6,3crfa8,dytoxin,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:12:28 2015 UTC,Presumably 1080p on ps4 like most games. I'd be happy with something like 900p and 60fps but I'm betting they'll shoot for 30.

Rainbow6,3cpltn,bengy124,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:22:41 2015 UTC,I heard there is a way to get one from amazon by pre-ordering it then they send you the code then after you redeem it you just cancel the order and your credit card won't be charged since the product hasn't shipped yet.
Rainbow6,3cpltn,dytoxin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:55:27 2015 UTC,You should get one for preordering from participating stores. I preordered from amazon and saw they were running a thing about it. Haven't checked to see if I got the key yet.
Rainbow6,3cnn85,Deosl,10,Thu Jul 9 08:47:07 2015 UTC,"He says the operator system choice was made before E3 2014 but was hidden on purpose, he kinda compares operators to Moba champions picks, every choice is meaningful and can bring tension/regret He says White Masks' AI can do as much as the player can, if not more allowing for longer games, 20-25 minutes He says CTUs specialize in CQC, open environments are for military special forces. He compares the defenders as a problem that locked itself in a box, the only way to solve it is to open the box (kinda explains why stealth is not really an option)  He talks about a map on a residential farm, similar to the Waco siege (that's fresh news, I'd bet it takes place in Oregon too, cross that off the map list !) About destructibility, it scales largely over 70% on some maps, what holds is the fundamental structure of the building, CTUs wouldn't weaken a house they're about to enter, so they only use explosives that would destroy the ""decorative"" walls. He also says that they added ""line of sights"" from last E3, saying that you can break pieces of indestructible elements to still be able to see and shoot through  The game's mindset is ""give the game to the community and help them evolve it"", he himself prefers modded games than vanilla games (MOD SUPPORT ?! maybe not). The game will ship with a ""custom game"" menu that will help modify most things (similar to GRP's private matches) : game time, allowed guns, allowed operators etc. This custom game mode will be expanded post launch to allow for even more stuff such as one operator pick for 4 rounds, a tool to help players make the game their own Servers are zoned by region, the priority is that ""the netcode would be insane"", he is pushing most on the connectivity and the responsivness of the game, this will be as sure as the console 60FPS they promised The interviewer asks the big question here : is the DNA of the Rainbow 6 series conserved ? Will the destruction, the gadgets and all not ruin the legacy ? He answers by saying that destruction is part of CTUs' universe and that this universe is parted in two : one is the before (thought, preparation, what operator to pick, what equipment to use, where to spawn, where will I attack ?) and here lies the tactical dimension, he also mentions that most of their feedback is to pin point how tactical the game is. The other part is the action,  where you have to turn on autopilot and survive before all, that's the skill part of the game. About game modes, he said that instead of making the same game mode more complex he'd rather make different game modes that allow for different approaches  Solo mode will happen but they aren't communicating on it for the moment, he does say that he didn't want to put a campaign in the game because it doesn't allow for replayability and that replayability is what Xavier wanted to base the game off. Instead, solo will be challenges through missions, meaning you can play the same mission over and over without doing the same thing twice (I guess). (good to know : terrohunt can be entirely played solo and allow for the same unlocks)"

Rainbow6,3cnn85,JonathanRL,3,Thu Jul 9 11:28:53 2015 UTC,"Not that much new info, but he did comment a little about the custom games people can tweak:   Timer Weapon and Operator limits (bye HBS) You can be locked to your operator for the duration of the match (you can't change after 1 round etc.) (I think he wanted this, but it wasn't confirmed 100%)   Also a bit about maps:   All maps can be played in night and day, will only focused on closed environments. He did say something about snow/mountains, I reckon this is the map based on Chalet from Rogue Spear that will be set in Courchevel, France   Maybe I missed something, my french isn't 100%."

Rainbow6,3cnn85,JonathanRL,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:39:55 2015 UTC,why?
Rainbow6,3cnn85,TheLucarian,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:07:03 2015 UTC,It would make the choice of operator more meaningful; force the team to adopt tactics that suits the team they have instead of just switching out the operator to counter the enemy.
Rainbow6,3cnn85,Djaquitchane,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:17:45 2015 UTC,"Indeed, it makes your choice matter even more and adds to the dynamic of your team and the other team regarding what you can and can't counter. You have to coordinate your choices much more and if you've made the wrong choice, you have to adapt I guess.  I hope this feature makes it in and even in some competitive playlists for regular games."
Rainbow6,3cnn85,TheLucarian,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:34:32 2015 UTC,Why does it matter more? It matters for every round already. And winning rounds wins matches...
Rainbow6,3cnn85,Djaquitchane,2,Thu Jul 9 10:42:08 2015 UTC,"You don't know what the other team picks each round, if you do know though, you can prepare more advanced tactics and, the team you face will also do the same thing so you'll have to 1-up their tactics."
Rainbow6,3cnn85,TheLucarian,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:18:58 2015 UTC,"I don't get it, what are the advanced tactics you are thinking of? If I chose Thermite and I can't use my charges on the walls because of Mute's Jammers (and we didn't bring EMP guy) - what advanced tactic should I employ with my thermite charges? Maybe I am simplifying here, but I really don't get it - the only thing I see is lack of choice and dynamics and instead repetitive rounds."
Rainbow6,3cnn85,JonathanRL,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:25:51 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't really know. But I'd say it's in the mindgames, if you're forcing Mute to use his jammers on the walls (knowing it's a gamble because he can't cover that many walls) the same jammers can't block the drones.   So you can push on that to have your drones in a good position, it's all about making the enemy make choices based on what you could do, opening options."
Rainbow6,3cnn85,TheLucarian,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:51:15 2015 UTC,"Hm, I see your point, but for me it's like taking out a big dynamic of the game - and if you would be stuck with your choice of operators for the whole match, it would be absolutly necessary to have an open operator select phase, where the teams alternate between picking so they can react on the choice of the other team. Otherwise you might have lost the game right from the start."
Rainbow6,3cnn85,JonathanRL,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:40:57 2015 UTC,"I want it to be closed. That way, intelligence and recon will be even more valuable. A bit of tip-toing while you check out what your opponent got. Research into match history and the like.   Punishing with a requirement for Planning; that would make it have a real edge in E-sports!"
Rainbow6,3cnn85,TheLucarian,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:41:11 2015 UTC,"Teams would still have favourite compositions that you could reasearch into. And since you bring up esports; If a team chooses the wrong composition at the start of a match, they'll fight an uphill battle for the whole match against the team with the more ideal composition - and especially in a tournament/league on pro level, that's basically an auto-loss.  If it's the same every round, wouldn't it be simply much more boring? If you don't have the right tools to break into the defenses, your team relies solely on the gunplay to win. Also, a team might want to change their strat depending on if they are behind (risky agressive comp) or leading (safe, defensive), reacting to the enemies strat (emp vs jammers), stick with the strat that worked last round? Or surprise them, be unpredictable, etc and so on.  I don't see any value to fixed comps as of now. To the contrary, I want this thought process of choosing operators in every round - that's the fun isn't it?"
Rainbow6,3cnn85,brotrr,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:20:01 2015 UTC,"No, because then it will just be a matter of fixing your tactics with the switch of an operator. It would in my opinion at least devalue the system in E-sports and make it less unique against other FPS E-sports.  I suppose we have to wait and see what system will be preferred :)"
Rainbow6,3cnn85,JonathanRL,2,Thu Jul 9 14:39:10 2015 UTC,"It would in my opinion at least devalue the system in E-sports and make it less unique against other FPS E-sports.   Wait a minute... that is actually the only thing that is unique compared to other FPS!  Anyhow, we should try and setup a game during the beta where everyone sticks to the same operator and just try it. I think it's boring, maybe it isn't. Hope we get the chance to try it though."
Rainbow6,3cnn85,Harvey_Dole,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:04:18 2015 UTC,"Do you play Dota or LoL? If the teams had to stay with the same heroes for the entirety of their Bo3 or Bo5 rounds, it would be an absolute brain-numbing experience. I think the same thing applies here to operators."

Rainbow6,3cfuog,Deosl,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:18:47 2015 UTC,"Being R6 fan since 98 I never got into making my own plans, I always used the predefined plans. That said I'm a MP gamer and I find the planning phase quite lacking before entering a match in Siege. There's so many possibilities in trying to create tactics based on detailed blueprints.  The fact that we can't customise our weapons yet, adds to the emptiness after choosing your operator and spawn point. I would sit there for 30 seconds just waiting. We could use this time to draw stuff or add icons like you described on the map. This was a feature they had in Raven Shield, it wasn't widely used but it was available.  I guess we'll just talk about what we'll do on coms. I like to stick with a load out and try it over and over until I can assess it before tinkering further. Hence why I'm ready to go quickly. It would be nice to have more depth before actually stepping into the map."
Rainbow6,3cfuog,Djaquitchane,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:02:48 2015 UTC,My buddies and I used the multiplayer planning tools a lot. I loved that you could also pull up the planning map on the fly mid match and continue to use and interact with it. Raven Shield was a game though were you weren't being rushed so not sure if terrorist hunt in Siege would afford the same kinds of opportunities that Raven Shield did in that way.
Rainbow6,3cfuog,DL-Z_ftw,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:18:42 2015 UTC,"My prob with your system is that it's based on knowing where the hostage is, which means planning goes straight after drone, and that really isn't the best to me.   As you said, it would make the defenders wait but it would also give them a lot (maybe too much?) ""safe"" time for setting up their defenses.  So, while it can be cool with random players, in a premade team setting, you'd expect them to know eachother pretty well and to have a shotcaller that would give them precise vocal instructions based on their own habits. Maybe even have prepared strats that the shotcaller would simply name.  I feel like MP planning is all about reacting fast to what you just saw in drone phase and making the best of your randomly guessed spawn location"
Rainbow6,3cfuog,Djaquitchane,0,Tue Jul 7 18:00:05 2015 UTC,We should be able to disable the drone scouting phase in custom matches/ playlists. This would really add to the surprise and tactical gameplay and would further add to the importance of the planning phase.

I suppose they went farther down the destructible environment road and they hadn't implemented everything yet during the alpha."
Rainbow6,3cf677,Djaquitchane,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:49:38 2015 UTC,"There was a curious issue with the kitchen where you could break the wall between a shelf and the stove to shoot in at the dining room, but you couldn't reinforce it. I don't foresee them changing it so that you can break furniture in the future, but they might make walls in relevant parts similarly unbreakable so furniture isn't an issue for breaching action.  With regards to furniture used for cover, just because it doesn't get holes in it doesn't mean bullets won't go through it!"
Rainbow6,3cf677,geofurb,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:54:06 2015 UTC,I'd like to see furniture be destructible if possible. It's sort of a problem if walls cant be breached in certain places because there's bookshelves or something on the other side
Rainbow6,3cey4a,DL-Z_ftw,18,Tue Jul 7 11:33:28 2015 UTC,"I'm a CSGO player, and I in no way see this game killing CSGO, much less competing with it.  They aren't the same game from what I can tell and won't fulfill the same desires.  Looking beyond the developers saying ""it will be a tactical shooter, I promise"", R6S doesn't seem like it's going to be a realistic FPS sim.  Instead, it seems to be this weird hybrid of run and gun BF4 style play with 5v5 instead of an entire battlefield.  I get the producers are trying to say that it is going to be a competitive game, but with the current elements like your reticule turning red through smoke when they go over an enemy, seemingly no recoil, white outlines on teammates, and seeing through walls, there won't be a competitive scene as it seems like there won't be a skill gap.  CSGO on the other hand doesn't attempt to call itself realistic, and was designed and promoted as a competitive arcade style shooter.  There is a HUGE skill gap in CSGO, and most people will never, ever reach the higher, or even middle skill levels of the game.  Ranks are based purely on skill, and it's one of the few games where you can actually lose rank if you begin to play poorly.  Tweaks are made not based on realism, but instead based on gameplay balance to ensure competitiveness.  CSGO is one of the few games I've ever played where the goal isn't to just point and shoot and not care where you have to hit the enemy, but you actually have to aim directly at their head (I mean, you don't have to, but you'll never get beyond the lowest ranks if you don't try going for headshots every single time.), and then control a pretty difficult spray pattern in order to kill them.  It sounds easy, but it isn't, especially in a game where killing an opponent simply means that you had a 0.1% quicker reaction time.  I find myself training for competitive matches much more than actually playing in matches.  For all intents and purposes, it really is a sport, R6S will not be.  The first three R6's on the other hand were meant to be a simulation of RL tactical combat, and differ from both R6S and CSGO.  The 3 games developed a competitive scene because of the skill gap involved, but ultimately that wasn't the point of the games.  P.S.- With the current implementation of seeing through walls, red reticules, etc. of R6S, I feel that few CSGO players will be wanting to play this game.  I can see it appealing to COD or BF players, but imo, the game seems like there will be little skill involved compared to CSGO.  P.S.S.- Even though this video is a bit dated, this is why CSGO is so unique, feel free to compare this to what you've seen so far of R6S: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW-XS5W5AxA  P.S.S.S.- Wrong video, meant to post this one, but that one above is still good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1lK2CKKGzI&list=PLfwtcDG7LpxGeQUBNIQHTNsSBrjzi2jX0&index=2"

Rainbow6,3cey4a,Deosl,5,Wed Jul 8 16:51:51 2015 UTC,"Nothing can kill CS, nothing(yet)  They are different games, apart from the 5vs5, no respawn and guns. People compare stuff without even playing, just by seeing.  They are two different games, but Siege doesn't hide the fact that it wants CS players, or any other players for that matter to play Siege. That's not a negative thing, it's just a double edged sword when appealing to other communities, you risk alienating the original community.  We can go on about what features are different from each other, but CS is CS and no one in the near future will take over the FPS crown that CS has had for over a decade.   Siege is something new and it looks/feels pretty good with rappelling and procedural destruction with the R6 CQB.  PS! Don't forget CS wouldn't be around if it wasn't for Rainbow Six! ;)"

Rainbow6,3cey4a,missch4nandlerbong,4,Tue Jul 7 11:48:39 2015 UTC,"They are completely different games. Not comparable at all. This is a very slightly more tactical CoD, which puts it about a trillion miles away from what CS is.  This isn't a knock against R6: It's not trying to be CS, at all. The original R6s also weren't trying to be CS. That's the tragedy of this game, not that it's not like CS. It was never going to be anything like CS.   many people compare these two games   I guess many people have never played a single round of Counter-Strike, hard as that is to believe."
Rainbow6,3cey4a,bleepblopbloop,2,Tue Jul 7 22:26:15 2015 UTC,The original R6s also weren't trying to be CS.   Of course they weren't... CS wasn't out until several years later...

This means might as well not have the objective at all and just go for team DM.

Rainbow6,3cdmxl,Deosl,2,Tue Jul 7 05:21:08 2015 UTC,"I feel like we could still have maybe one more assault rifle. Maybe a Sig 552. It's a shame about the whole Colt licensing deal if that's still in play as I miss my good ole M4 and M16. yeah I know Hk 417 is similar, but still.  Another shotgun would be nice. Calling dibs on a SPAS-12! Another LMG too, maybe FN 249  For handguns why are the two staple handguns of Beretta M9 (92 FS) and Glock 17 missing from this game?  Good call on posting this list too!  So I guess no sniper rifles, huh? Unless they're saying the Dragunov is one, because it could be, in fact usually is.  Good selection. I hope there's a few more coming - but even if there weren't that's still pretty good selection."
Rainbow6,3cdmxl,iceycat,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:54:38 2015 UTC,Colt doesn't own the m4 trademark anymore. They failed to protect it and it's fallen into public domain.  M16 would be a military designation and I don't think they care or trademark their designations.   So both should be free to use.

Rainbow6,3cdmxl,thirsty904,2,Tue Jul 7 02:36:20 2015 UTC,The m45 MEU(SOC) is a 1911. It's been Marine Corps Force Recon's sidearm since the adoption of the Beretta m9.   No idea why they decided to add this particular 1911 though. I don't recall any of the Rainbow guys being former Marines. Nor would you find one outside the Marine Corps.
Rainbow6,3cdmxl,dytoxin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:37:47 2015 UTC,"Wasn't familiar with that name, I'm used to just seeing the obvious 1911 name lol. I've always been a fan of that and the mk23."
Rainbow6,3cdmxl,thirsty904,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:22:16 2015 UTC,USP 45 would make sense. The mk23 is a monstrosity of a pistol and pretty much a failure. The gun list doesn't make a whole lot of sense for what is essentially a Swat team.   Unfortunately I think the Tom Clancy games have more or less given up on realism though.

Rainbow6,3cdmxl,Commando2352,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:23:43 2015 UTC,If any squad gets to have the M14 it would very certainly be the SWAT but they are Heavily focused on CQC so I guess another time.

It wasn't even made in the U.S. it's a German manufactured weapon, made specifically for U.S. counter terror units. And Rainbow isn't military anyways, they don't even officially exist. And anyways, almost all of the other weapons are used by the unit that has them in game and in real life. The FBI SWAT does use the M1014 and the G36C and the UMP45 along with other things."

They spent too much time with creating these pre-made Operators that you are expected to identify when you see them and know what they are carrying, so it would not make sense to allow you to make them look different than the default look.  They also built in the amount of armor - light-medium-heavy, into each pre-defined Operator, so you are stuck with the level of the one you are forced... I mean choose... to play."

I do not believe there are any customization options for your operator.  Each operator is set in how they look which I am OK with.  Now we just have to convince the devs to make each team have a different color for their uniform.

That was life or death ^ _^  We would have late night games with pistol/sniper only or cz-61+silencer which was the most horrible pea shooter in the game and took a lot of hits to kill with in Raven Shield. Often playing until the early morning, we would go to the US servers to play and own people and just be trolls with c4, smoke and claymores.  I remember we experimented on how many we could line up and kill with the .50 cal sniper rifle or how far the ragdoll could fly when sitting on a c4.  You always had fun in games, be it silly people doing silly things or just having a laugh at funny situations in the game.

After all, it is a video game and should be fun.  Lot of pistols only nights, pistols + shotguns, sniper rifles only, gimmicky custom maps, some servers ran a santa hat mod during the holidays.  Custom maps would auto-download from the server when you joined, so jumping into those type of servers were seamless whenever you felt like something different.  There was really no persistent stat tracking so you could just play to have fun, do stupid stuff without having to worry about your KDR, XP, unlocks, none of that BS every game has now.     It is something that worries me about Siege in that there is a very structured way to play the game.  In 6 months after it comes out, you will be playing the exact same way as Day 1.  There will be nothing to break up the monotony.  Siege might very well be a fun game, but doing the same thing over and over gets old at some point no matter how fun."
Rainbow6,3c51aa,NotAValidName97,8,Sat Jul 4 21:18:51 2015 UTC,"Heartbeat sensor has been in the series since 1998. It feels a bit OP because you can switch from HBS to weapon /C4 quite fast...  Doors,  nothing much to say, doesn't fit the Siege game play  Ammo count,  I agree with you.    4  You can get a 1 shot kill with a headshot. Then again you have a operator that can give extra armour platings...  What do you think about the HUD and all the information it gives you for free? Like teammate outlines and treats indicators."

Rainbow6,3c51aa,iceycat,4,Sun Jul 5 20:47:08 2015 UTC,"I love all the attention the HB sensor has gotten and all the suggestions to get rid of it or nerf it.  Perhaps if any of these people played R6 Ravenshield they would know there is already a well tested method of balancing it and even allowing anyone and everyone to equip it if they want to.  With Ravenshield, it made noise equipping it, it took time to equip, it blocked much of your view while using, and it had a very limited range.  The other team could equip stationary plantable HB sensor jammers, take out a portable jammer, or place heartbeat pucks to fool it with false heartbeats.  Even though everyone could take one, due to the balancing it wasn't taken by very many.  Those that took it were pretty easily fooled by countermeasures."
Rainbow6,3c51aa,brotrr,2,Mon Jul 6 00:55:51 2015 UTC,"Right there with you. People say it's too over powered and wrecks the game even though it's been in the Rainbow games before.

Rainbow6,3c51aa,iceycat,3,Mon Jul 6 14:35:22 2015 UTC,"I don't like some of these new gadgets they've introduced, mostly the heartbeat sensor, everyone can agree this completely gamebreaking and needs to be removed only problem is they've built a character around it.    Having an operator built around the heartbeat sensor is exactly what makes it NOT a problem. They can continuously tweak the sensor or tweak the weapons that the operator has in order to balance it. Could you imagine if any operator could equip it?"

Rainbow6,3c05ux,WaffleHulk,4,Fri Jul 3 15:56:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about the XBOX version as I never played it, but the PC version imo was the climax of the genre.  I don't know if they changed anything around to be more friendly with controllers and what not, but Raven Shield was highly strategic and highly tactical.  It also had single player and planning.  The best."
Rainbow6,3c05ux,bleepblopbloop,3,Fri Jul 3 18:32:58 2015 UTC,Raven Shield on PC is the pinnacle is tactical shooting. Rainbow Six 3 on the Xbox is the beginning of its slide into more arcade sale tendencies.
Rainbow6,3c05ux,PartyOnAlec,2,Fri Jul 3 21:50:44 2015 UTC,"Nope.  I tried Black Arrow when I first got Xbox Live, and it was the first toe-in-the-water of the series for dropping the PC aspects of mission planning and slow gameplay.  They changed it just enough to 'console-ify' the game, and it's popularity drove sales, which eventually changed the direction of the entire franchise."
Rainbow6,3c05ux,wrel_,2,Fri Jul 3 20:16:32 2015 UTC,"The console version of Rainbow Six 3 is not really tactical. I had actually played that version first when I was younger, but after recently beating RS3 on PC, I decided to play through the console version again. You can take so many shots and not die, the levels are very very linear, no planning (no need), all the enemy placement is scripted, it is it's own game, not really like the PC version at all other than some assets and shooting mechanics.   I think it is a good linear game though, but it doesn't fall into what the roots of rainbow six are.  EDIT: But I will say, the multiplayer of the console version is more similar to the PC version than the single player is, but the levels are smaller and less open than the PC version's multiplayer levels."
Rainbow6,3c05ux,mk28,2,Fri Jul 3 21:46:34 2015 UTC,"On the Xbox versions(Rainbow Six 3 and Black Arrow) the true tactical side was online.  The campaign wasn't very tactical compared to the PC version, but online in both adversarial and coop it did shine."
Rainbow6,3bzr8r,Lazy_Jezus,7,Fri Jul 3 13:51:00 2015 UTC,"The more we are to criticize this game, the better are the chance of having an interesting final result.

Without these elements this game could be awesome."
Rainbow6,3bzr8r,Harvey_Dole,3,Fri Jul 3 16:25:36 2015 UTC,Agreed

Rainbow6,3bzr8r,Harvey_Dole,3,Mon Jul 6 21:06:15 2015 UTC,"criticize    English is obviously not my main language. By criticize I mean... evaluate or analyse. This is not the definition of the word?  It's obvious that those who look and analyzes every detail of this game have a strong interest towards this one.   Personally , I think this game is almost perfect. If there is less ""visual aids"", I could play to Siege for the next coming years. However , if the game remains as it is (with brainless feature), I will certainly switch for another game as soon as I will have a better option.  I want a game who ask reflection, judgement, thinking...Siege is almost all of this."
Rainbow6,3bzr8r,geofurb,2,Tue Jul 7 02:40:00 2015 UTC,"Criticize has a negative connotation in English; it means to point out the flaws of something when used in daily speech. It can also mean what you meant, but it's not frequently used that way. I'm sorry, I think I misunderstood you! You're absolutely right that we should try to help analyze the game and give outsider perspective.  tl;dr Don't mind me! You're doing great!"
Rainbow6,3bzr8r,bleepblopbloop,2,Tue Jul 7 03:56:39 2015 UTC,"This is precisely what I'm worried about and have been talking about... the current vision of Ubisoft is severing the desire of the original R6 players from wanting to buy the game, and the ""features"" it is adding while attempting to slap on a ""tactical shooter"" sticker to the genre (even though it appears that it isn't that at all) is going to prevent new players from coming in to purchase the game.  I'm really worried about Siege..."
Rainbow6,3bzr8r,t_n_x,2,Fri Jul 3 18:36:03 2015 UTC,"heartbeat sensor is limited to only one operator, has a very small radius and can be countered with EMP grenades, it's all about skills and knowledge, stop asking them to simplify the game. They will not remove Techies, buy wards !"
Rainbow6,3bzr8r,Deosl,4,Fri Jul 3 19:20:50 2015 UTC,"Hi and welcome! :)  Yes, there are some issues people have with the game (what game doesn't?) in its current state. Don't forget, everything we see is subject to change for better or worse.  They are actively listening to player feedback and take it under consideration when making decisions.   I understand your hesitation, but sit on the fence for now and see how it turns out in the Closed Beta if you can participate. Most of us have voiced our concerns on the issues you touch upon, and hopefully we'll see something concrete addressing those issues before launch.   Join in and share your thoughts on different subjects that get discussed!"
Rainbow6,3bzr8r,petracat09,3,Fri Jul 3 14:05:51 2015 UTC,Thanks and its good to see that Ubisoft kinda listens to what the community has to say about a game. I indeed saw a view videos where they talked about how much they looked at player feedback. but from all the posts that address the issues i stated above i had a feeling the community was not being heard.
Rainbow6,3bzr8r,Djaquitchane,2,Fri Jul 3 14:38:50 2015 UTC,"Believe me, they are listening. But they aren't just going to make a game by committee either. Yes there are problems, but remember this sub reddit is a really intense core of folks who are pouring over footage and giving line by line feedback. A great thing, but as a result there isn't a lot of positive getting posted even though I know the Rainbow 6 Siege booth at E3 and the Uplay lounge was most popular with cheering, excited players who were genuinely impressed and happy with the core mechanics.   Hype is a tricky thing to manage."
Rainbow6,3bzr8r,Djaquitchane,0,Mon Jul 6 10:05:47 2015 UTC,"The heartbeat sensor has a 10m range and is available to one single operator (read : it's not worth a thing anymore, besides, esports organizations can ban it).  The crosshairs are dynamic depending on how you move, not as easy to deal with as CSGO's ""make your own crosshair"" thing that's been going on. Also, watching E3 footage I noticed it didn't change color when you pointed it at enemies behind walls. Only when you had a direct line between your gun and the enemy.  As for the friendly player outline, it's not as crazy as it seems. Everyone keeps focused on it when it's just an easy way to deal with a lack of communication. Keep in mind pretty much every single map will be in CQC configuration, so it's pretty easy to get in the line of fire of your allies without them having time to communicate about it. Also, the outline fades away as they get towards the center of your crosshair, so TK isn't impossible.  Compare that to other games that allow for TK, most of them have pretty solid long range combat (CoD Hardcore, CS, RedOrchestra/RisingStorm, BF Hardcore...).  As someone who craves on CQC I'm hyped as hell for this game."
Rainbow6,3bzlxu,soundlord,4,Fri Jul 3 12:58:17 2015 UTC,What kind of support specific?   You have the following:   Operator that drops extra protection gear Operator that can revive people in DBNO state from distance with a dart gun Operator that can deploy a stationary LMG Operator that can set up reinforced barricades.   These are just the known Operators so far. There loads of Operators that will facilitate different playstyles!
Rainbow6,3bzlxu,Deosl,2,Fri Jul 3 13:30:12 2015 UTC,"Before people lose their shit over the revive gun, I believe it's only for people in DBNO state.  But yeah as you said, different operators have different roles, some have active roles in the defense (Castle's barricades are essential) some are more passive due to their gadgets being designed that way (Mute's jammers work in the shadows)."
Rainbow6,3bzlxu,Djaquitchane,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:45:49 2015 UTC,edited it so it won't confuse anyone! No Zombie operators here! ;)
Rainbow6,3bzlxu,Deosl,2,Fri Jul 3 13:48:54 2015 UTC,I mean an active type of support. The operator who revives from a distance sounds like my kind of thing.

I didn't play Siege that much (closed alpha) but beside of ressurection, i think a support player in a shooter mechanic should do this things (i play a lot of counterstrike go, where supportive players a existent as well):   Covering Check Corners Provide Cover BACKWARDS, for not getting flanked Flashing/Nading for teammates who will go in  Checking the Map/Environment. The aggressiv player is many times focused on his target. He can't check the map or other flanks as well. Supportive player communicate important information to the team"
Rainbow6,3bzqp3,Deosl,2,Fri Jul 3 13:45:48 2015 UTC,"That was a nice read. I really wished that you would of checked out the Xbox one version. Really want to know what the game looked like on Xbox. So from what you played, do you think that the game is on track to being a polished title?"
Rainbow6,3bzqp3,ChernoAlpha_Mk1,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:18:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks!   My limited skills with controls would not have given me any satisfaction! They are showing the Xbox version at Montreal Comic con this weekend. I'll make a note of it and check it out on xbox in the future.   From what I played it felt much more in line with the old R6 games I've come to love in regards to movement speed and gunplay. I played on LAN and it felt responsive and smooth when hitting your target. Jury is still out when the online architecture is in the wild, it wasn't that refined in the alpha. I did not encounter any major bugs from what I played, don't know how fresh the e3 build was. The graphics have been improved greatly. Eager to try a map in both night and then day to see if it really offers a different experience.   I'm still wary of the team outlines and threat indicators.... Wasn't too impressed with the new game mode, stand in a magical circle and capture it to win. Still feel the pre-game a bit lacking, I usually choose a operator and vote for a spawn point quick and just wait for 30 secs.   I hope they have a smooth launch and everything is solid from day 1. Hard to tell from a build designed for e3."

The difficulty will be “normal” and mode will be 5VE – Plant Bomb Mode. Each round duration will be 8-‐10 minutes or a round may be completed when the objective is achieved or the team is eliminated.   Eh, still cool though.

Rainbow6,3bv68x,Harvey_Dole,7,Thu Jul 2 18:24:43 2015 UTC,Think about it. The devs thought that this was a good solution. That's scary.
Rainbow6,3bv68x,bleepblopbloop,6,Fri Jul 3 04:14:32 2015 UTC,"that's what scares me.  Forget about Rainbow Six and changing the actual game from what it used to be, what scares me is that they are making a COD clone but labeling it as a ""tactical shooter"", when there is nothing about it that makes it competitive or a tactical shooter.  If you are going to slap a label on a game and call it ""Rainbow Six"" but change it from its roots and try to refresh the series, fine.  Whatever.  You are going to piss all the base off, but that's your choice and hopefully you'll get new fans.  However, it's a little worrying when you are trying to connect the base by saying ""this is going to be competitive and tactical"" when it isn't... seeing through walls, HUD outlines, and having your cursor change colors is not competitive, it's arcady.  I'm just worried that ultimately it's going to try to be two things at once, and is going to advertise that which it isn't going to be, and piss everyone off who bought it."
Rainbow6,3bv68x,Harvey_Dole,3,Fri Jul 3 04:55:19 2015 UTC,"I don't feel the COD vibe with siege.   But with their white arrows (indicator of the direction of a missed shot), the magical crosshair who detect enemy and teammate, the white outline, the bullet trails, the reload indicator... it makes COD ""search and destroy"" hardcore more nice than siege.. and Cod is not nice."
Rainbow6,3bv68x,bleepblopbloop,3,Fri Jul 3 16:17:35 2015 UTC,"that's what I meant, I didn't mean that it was a COD clone in the sense that it's regular army running around doing things, just the mechanics seem like they are CODish, or worse..."
Rainbow6,3bv68x,dytoxin,0,Fri Jul 3 17:13:19 2015 UTC,"I haven't gotten the COD vibe from it at all. It does seem a bit more focused on getting you in the action and making it action oriented rather than the super strategy tactical stuff that I think some people think of when they hear tactical, but that's just me.   I don't typically like games that use the one life system because it often turns out like CS where it's just a glorified one life tdm, but this one actually interests me. The idea of blowing through walls, using gadgets, stuff like that, it just seems a bit different. More tactical than say CS but not all action/twitchy like COD. If that makes sense. That's the vibe I've gotten from what they've shown so far.   Suggesting that you can't have competitive with arcade is inane though. Competitive does not mean not arcade. Competitive also does not mean hardcore. COD is (could be) competitive (without its overly aggressive lag comp) and it's arcade as hell. The two are not mutually exclusive at all."

Rainbow6,3bv68x,dytoxin,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:03:21 2015 UTC,"Welcome to every pc game ever with customizable options. Don't like one ruleset? Keep looking til you find one that does. One size fits all will never work, especially regarding more hardcore options. If anything a hardcore mode being implemented and a setting you can choose would be the best way to approach it since both camps are fine and with an option like that it doesn't just become a hardcore game that seems more fit as a tactical strategy game as opposed to a shooter with any emphasis on any sort of action."
Rainbow6,3bv68x,Harvey_Dole,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:11:25 2015 UTC,"If I play at Bf4, I select a Hardcore server and that's it. Playing on a server with strange rules, 400% tickets, more health, pistols only.. no thanks"
Rainbow6,3bv68x,dytoxin,2,Fri Jul 3 16:06:57 2015 UTC,"I would hope for a hardcore mode at least. Even COD has that going for it, whether you like it or not. I don't see why it can't be an option for people who want that more hardcore experience rather than changing the base game. It helps to have a unified mode like that so that you don't have to hunt for anything unless you want something very specific beyond a modifier flag as simple as that. I didn't like looking for a BF server and then find out one I can play on and join or about to join has 85 million tickets."
Rainbow6,3bv68x,bleepblopbloop,2,Fri Jul 3 16:57:10 2015 UTC,"that'll be good, are they going to have competitive MM like CSGO?  If so, hopefully they'll disable it completely for those servers."

Rainbow6,3bvia1,FlanjeUK,7,Thu Jul 2 14:30:26 2015 UTC,How about a Rainbow Six game? That'd be pretty sweet.
Rainbow6,3bvia1,bleepblopbloop,4,Thu Jul 2 18:23:06 2015 UTC,"I think this is what they call a leading question but I have to admit #3 as long as the ""the original 3 games"" referred to are Rainbow Six, Rogue Spear and Raven Shield.   Hell, I could even see them doing a remake / reboot style of game mixing scenarios from the novel with new ones as well as ""historical missions"" where you try out counterterrorist operations from the real world."
Rainbow6,3bvia1,JonathanRL,4,Thu Jul 2 14:34:09 2015 UTC,"A remake of Rainbow Six 1998, its the only way i could forgive them for what Siege is."
Rainbow6,3bvia1,Phi03,3,Thu Jul 2 14:34:57 2015 UTC,"As the CEO of Ubisoft said, they will continue to support this title for a long time as an online service. Expecting it to sell pretty well and have a lot of DLC down the road. It could be more than 3+ years until we hear about a new R6.  My heart says #3, but my brain says #1/2. I was just super stoked to see them return to FPS and employ some of the core elements of R6. I gave up completely on R6 when Vegas came out and wasn't optimistic with Patriots. It wasn't what I identified with R6 at all.  But with Siege it's at least closer to the core of what R6 is, rather than the Vegas series. I'm not thinking about the next R6, I'm excited for Siege, to be frank, from what I've played and seen at e3. It's not perfect, but it's closer than we've ever been since 2003 with Raven Shield."
Rainbow6,3bvia1,Deosl,3,Thu Jul 2 15:28:18 2015 UTC,"Personally I don't want to see Siege 2 or anything like it for several years.  Not that I don't want to see a continuation, but with what can be done with DLC and patches there is less need to blast out a tweaked and slightly modified game a little after the first releases.  I want a game I can sink my teeth into for a while and actually work to master it.  That was one thing that messed up Battlefield 4 for me was Hardline was advertised.  All that meant to me was more time would be spent on the spinoff then fixing and enhancing the game already release, that and it made it more like a madden.  I don't want COD style new game every year, I played the Socom franchise for 12 years, Socom confrontation alone for about 5 years.  I played Rouge Spear for 3 years.  I played Vegas 2 for 3 years.  I have played Battlefield 4 for over 1,600 hours.  Nothing turns me off of a franchise more then if they just pump out game after game.  Partly because I like to complete and 100% games that I play. At the same time that eventually I would like a Siege 2 way in the future, I really want them to come up with something for the core old school Rainbow players.  Siege fills the quota for new and refreshing to bring people in, that should satiate people for quite a while (those that like that style game), but the people that are Rainbow fans that are not into Siege I want them, and myself to have a game that really is a blast from the past."
Rainbow6,3bvia1,MRMYSTICIGR,2,Thu Jul 2 16:47:00 2015 UTC,"I hear ya, I want a game that I know will last and all the effort put into will pay off. I want that old school feeling when there's a community you play with and have a great time like in Rogue Spear and Raven Shield."
Rainbow6,3bvia1,Deosl,3,Thu Jul 2 16:59:56 2015 UTC,I just want to see how this one turns out and what's good and bad and then go from there. Why can't we just do that.
Rainbow6,3bvia1,dytoxin,2,Fri Jul 3 04:32:45 2015 UTC,"I do hope that they plan a new release candidate shortly after Siege launches so we don't have to wait another, what? 7 years? I can deal with a follow up game in a couple of years.  Should it be Siege 2 though? Well, I think it's too early to answer that question yet as much as we've seen we have to remember there's so much we haven't seen yet as well.  I think destruction should come back in whatever comes next as that seems like an amazing fit for CQB game play. I would like a little more emphasis on floor breaching, not just on premade ""trap doors"" in only a couple of predetermined spots though.  The operator system.... I would like a combination of Siege and Ravenshield. I like the distinction of the operators in Siege, the only thing that set them apart in RvS was the face pic on the team loadout screen. In game they all looked like clones. I would like stats back that can be leveled up again. Spend a lot of time shooting pistols? Your accuracy with them improves. Like to snipe? Your accuracy with sniper rifles improves. This is huge though - OPEN UP the weapon, armor and gadget selection like it used to be. If they refuse to open up gadget selection than at least open up weapon and armor selection.  Doors. You need doors in a CQB game. I went through the 5 stages of grief on doors in Siege. I'm finally at acceptance. I know there's not any point in saying ""put them in Siege"" anymore because it's not going to happen at this point. BUT whatever the next installment winds up being, whether that's Siege 2 or something different - it needs doors. Not just because doors are an essential component to room breaching and clearing but also because of the gameplay elements we're missing out on. We can't stack on doors anymore. We have no locks to pick anymore. We can't fluidly open or close anything. I think barricades and fortification mechanics were allowed to overrule doors. I think with enough planning and balancing that both could be made to co-exist in the same game if they really wanted to make it work. I have several ideas for how to properly balance both systems together (but I won't go into them right now)  We did get an acknowledgement that there will be at least some silencers in the game but I'm not convinced we'll have the option for as much stealth as we used to be able to have. Maybe I'm wrong. Regardless I want the next game to have the option to be able to stealth an entire mission if you wanted to and were good enough to pull it off by using the right tools.  I will also say it's too early to judge what campaign will be yet. please remember that games like Raven Shield were just a collection of individual missions with a few cut scenes in between some of them as well. I'm actually very glad they returned to individual international locations as one off missions instead of that weird Vegas/Mexico hybrid in the Vegas games. True, lack of AI team mates in campaign IS quite disappointing though."
Rainbow6,3bvia1,iceycat,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:09:16 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it would be a Rainbow Six game, but I want a realistic shooter that has no hud at all and no scoreboard when you pause in game.  If you want to know how many bullets you have then you need to pull the magazine out of your weapon and if you want to know how many grenades you have got left you need to look down at your belt.    No revives and when you get shot you get spun around or knocked down and your vision blurs if you push too hard afterwards.    I think you get what I am after.    That would be sweet."

Rainbow6,3br7b3,iceycat,3,Wed Jul 1 14:23:56 2015 UTC,"From what I gather in the Extract Hostage game mode you have to secure the hostage to a safe zone.  But I get your point, about ""winning"" the round even if there are swarms of enemies around you. But maybe it's about the greater good and disabling the bomb? :>  They have a Replayability Siege Generator if you missed it, which you can find here But from seeing multiple videos, the bombs were often placed at the same places, but it could not be fully implemented in the e3 build."
Rainbow6,3br7b3,Deosl,3,Wed Jul 1 15:18:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah the gameplay videos I saw the bomb was almost always in the corner office and in the basement break room. there needs to be like a good dozen or so possible locations to keep it feeling nice and random. I don't know much about asset protection but same there too, ditto for hostage location. The more random things are the higher the replay value and longevity becomes.  As far as disabling the bomb goes I get that an alarm goes off and swarms of enemy are alerted, but I'm annoyed that it turns into an automatic wave defense mode at that point. Like it should be possible to disable a bomb without that happening. Maybe something like if you get to a bomb without being detected (lethal silent takedowns are fine) then you can slowly disarm the bomb manually. Or maybe there's a minigame like hacking or lock picking was for Splinter Cell and if you fail the alarm goes off and you get the waves, but if you succeed then you don't. I don't know it just feels a tad bit forced to automatically go into wave defense mode each time you disarm a bomb."

Rainbow6,3br7b3,DL-Z_ftw,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:23:41 2015 UTC,They already have this feature in the hostage rescue mode.   You get extra points for extracting the hostage.
Rainbow6,3br7b3,III2RUFFIII,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:27:39 2015 UTC,I think his point was that every hostage rescue match turns into a team death match because it's easier to wipe the team out than extract the hostage.
Rainbow6,3br7b3,III2RUFFIII,2,Wed Jul 1 16:55:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, correct!  The attackers should have to extract the hostage out of the building, even after eliminating all the defenders, within the total time limit for a successful round."
Rainbow6,3br7b3,dytoxin,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:45:02 2015 UTC,"I can get behind that. Maybe the hostage could also have an explosive vest or something and when the last defender is killed a :30 countdown starts until the vest detonates or something?

I believe this Operator had a more advanced shield. Also you had a French Operator who is a medic that can revive himself and others from distance..... And a Russian Operator with a deployable LMG.

Rainbow6,3bmz7c,electr1cpanda,37,Tue Jun 30 14:59:43 2015 UTC,"For me,  going back to 1998 when everyone was shooting monsters and having loads of health, the original R6 introduced lethality. If you get hit, you die. I loved the devs t-shirt at e3, which was One Shot Kill.   Rainbow Six was lethal and brutal. It had loads of depth in order to master the gunplay and creating tactics for each non linear map.   Rainbow Six for me is, lethality, FPS, CQB, tactical, teamwork, community, competitive, no respawn, skills and the satisfaction of mastering a challenging game that doesn't hold your hand and treats you like a grown up."
Rainbow6,3bmz7c,Deosl,11,Tue Jun 30 15:15:03 2015 UTC,"I can't sum it up much better than Deosl.  I'll just add that what made R6 what it was for me was the degree of realism being between COD and the hardcore ARMA type sims in a First Person CQB environment.  There was no hand-holding, but it provided some situational awareness help like a minimap and full screen map to track only your team and original objective location, and just a few HUD elements that could be turned off individually, or server side for all.  Rainbow 6 did well at immersing you in Clancy's R6 universe.  It had all the little things to add depth and realism, like footprints in snow and when coming off wet surfaces.  You could do more realistic door/window opening/closing and use real breaching and building clearing tactics (you knew I would mention doors somewhere).  It also provided the map tools to add longevity and allow user-created content.  It provided clan tools like sending stats to your stats server where you could have your own clan web page with real time and historical stats to manipulate and display any way you wanted to with n4admin."
Rainbow6,3bmz7c,Pest_AWC,8,Tue Jun 30 19:59:15 2015 UTC,Yes exactly what Deosl said!
Rainbow6,3bmz7c,III2RUFFIII,2,Tue Jun 30 15:27:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, I find it hard to add anything else... he pretty much summed it up for me too.

Not especially distilled."

Rainbow6,3bmz7c,digitalevo7,-1,Wed Jul 1 01:09:41 2015 UTC,"Take out no respawn and that nearly describes Instagib Bombing Run in Unreal Tournament 2003. I think a big part of Rainbow Six compared to other games where you have to behave tactically is that in Rainbow you have to think further ahead, plan well before you act."
Rainbow6,3bmz7c,geofurb,15,Tue Jun 30 20:00:59 2015 UTC,"To me, Rainbow Six is about teamwork and replicating the absolute lethal nature of CQB. Games should be tense, about positioning, and with few but absolutely explosive encounters. In that sense I think RB:S does a good job, but doesn't work in terms of the actual gameplay. Players that plan and coordinate their attack/defend should trump improvising players relying on reflex, even if those reflexive players are better FPS gamers than the other player by far.  I think the general consensus is that right now, Siege does not treat their gamers like grown-ups. Look at the popularity of Dark Souls and Bloodborne...those games treat their gamers as competent players and are loved for doing that. Boss one-shots you? Well tough luck ya big baby, dodge it next time.  Meanwhile, the Siege devs give players crutch after crutch. Bullet trails and arrows that point directly towards where people are shooting from. Outlines for friendly players because apparently all of the players are mute. Ammo pool reloading instead of magazine reloading because we can't be trusted to manage our reloads properly. Crosshairs because players aren't competent enough and not willing to learn to keep their sights up around corners? What sort of operator shoots from the hip? I could go on but I hope I got my point across."
Rainbow6,3bmz7c,brotrr,7,Tue Jun 30 15:47:42 2015 UTC,"Amazingly stated and I'm glad electr1cpanda read it. Rainbow Six for me is just that, a lack of some of the modern day COD style crutches. Lethality and risk. Harsh lessons. Bloodborne nailed it, it knew where it came from and what it was trying to be. Look at those sales and awards... hell... even I bought the game and I've never ever played a Souls style game in my life...and I loved it and still trying to get through it.   Your team would do well to remember that, you're on the right track and some of your fixes are easy to make... just keep pushing to make them."
Rainbow6,3bmz7c,reddz95,11,Tue Jun 30 16:17:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I didn't want this to turn into a debate about Siege specifically, but more an overall reflection of the series and name itself. One thing I would like to point out is that hip fire isn't as viable as you might perceive (we've nerfed it pretty hard). EDIT: and have increased the time to ADS so you need to be more tactical about your movements."
Rainbow6,3bmz7c,brotrr,4,Tue Jun 30 16:10:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! I actually typed out the last two paragraphs about Siege before realizing this was a question about Rainbow Six in general, so I had to edit my post and add in the bit at the top, lol!"
Rainbow6,3bmz7c,Harvey_Dole,3,Tue Jun 30 16:49:43 2015 UTC,"Heh, no worries, I appreciate you adding your perspective! Rainbow Six means a lot to all of us and I thought this could be a cool discussion. The replies haven't disappointed."
Rainbow6,3bmz7c,iceycat,11,Tue Jun 30 17:58:41 2015 UTC,"A tactical experience that requires coordination, communication, judgment and thinking .  Therefore , items that encourage a brainless game annoys me.  When I 'm in doubt , the crosshair changes color to show me when to shoot.  The white arrows indicate  me which side I have to protect myself .  Bullet trails tell me the location of the enemy.  The white outline shows me where are my friends... even if they are behind my own rifles (http://imgur.com/uQf5PjJ). I fully understand that we need this feature , but it should not be always enabled.  The game tell me when I should reload...  Don't ge me wrong, I have a HUGE interest toward this game.  I would like to play this game for a few years and for this, the HUD must be less aggressive."
Rainbow6,3bmz7c,OGRfanboy,20,Tue Jun 30 15:32:53 2015 UTC,"I hope we all appreciate this question coming from a developer. By asking this he's voluntarily putting a target on his back in many ways. But the root of it is that they're really wanting to understand what we we're looking for and expecting. People can and will get all kinds of snarky about that. But take a moment and really think about this....he never had to ask this question, and yet he did. To me at least, that speaks volumes.  Now to answer the question. ""teamwork, tactics and tension"" is a part of the Rainbow formula, but you can find that in other games as well. I spent a lot of time playing RvS single player and using my AI team mates to complete missions and terrorist hunts. Does the team work that you mention still apply there? I spent most of my time playing that way. If it doesn't then that means I wasn't getting the Rainbow experience according to that mission statement and if it does how does that translate now that AI team mates are no longer part of the Siege? No, I think that was part of the equation, but that's too much of a Reader's Digest simplification to distill it down to.  Huge factors of what set Rainbow apart for me was things like slower pacing. I am not now, nor was I ever a twitch reaction based gamer. I didn't like Diablo, I liked Xcom. I didn't like Halo, I liked Rainbow Six or Swat 4. The time to think, and strategize both before a mission and clearing out a room and having time to stack on a door or prep a snake cam or whatever without waves of enemies rushing me and forcing me to just shoot, shoot, shoot all the time was what I liked most.   Besides the pacing there was the customization. You could level them up and load them out any way you wanted, change their camo, armor types, weapons and gadgets and play the way you wanted to play. Sure the operatives in RvS had things they were better at by skill but you could still load them out as you saw fit.   Rainbow to me will always be about CQB room clearing. Though with better performing engines now we shouldn't be afraid to throw things outside a little bit now and again. It should still stay at least 90% indoors CQB though, but the occasional outside elements would be okay. Airport from RvS was a good example of blending those interior and exterior elements together well.  Another Rainbow staple is the international operatives and the international missions. They go where needed. I felt the franchise REALLY suffered from that loss when Vegas came out.  Stealth. Not like Splinter Cell stealth. But the fact that you COULD take out an entire mission without ever being discovered if you wanted to with silenced weapons was great and a way that I often played. silenced MP5's and heart beat sensors! Good times...  Here's the biggest thing though. Rainbow Six was always the anti-CoD, the anti-Halo and to some degree even the anti-Battlefield. It was detailed. It was smart. It was clandestine. It was slightly geo-political. It was tense. It was methodical. It was immersive. It was slower paced. It was lethal and unforgiving. It was CQB. It was semi realistic. It was customizable. It was highly replayable. And it was damn fun."
Rainbow6,3bmz7c,tyhopkin,11,Tue Jun 30 17:25:59 2015 UTC,"Rainbow six was a ""slow"" methodical shooter that did not rely on drones, sprinting, medical packs to revive players. Once you get shot you are injured or dead. The early games were the pinnacle of all fps games. It was a game that set itself apart from all the other games.  Saddens me I will never see another true Tom Clancy game. If they would have just built up the audience and set itself from all the other twitch shooters, these games would have kept getting G.O.T.Y Candidates.  Can you imagine how great of a game RAINBOW SIX 3 HD or GHOST RECON 1 HD would be!!!  It would be the only AAA shooter on the market that was not 100% realistic or 100% arcade."
Rainbow6,3bmz7c,DL-Z_ftw,8,Tue Jun 30 16:46:42 2015 UTC,"I agree teamwork, tactics, and tension are pillars of R6, but that can be said for almost any shooter.  However, they are true to varying degrees of importance depending on the game but in general I would say those are the goals for any FPS/TPS dev.  More importantly and IMO a better question would be ""What made R6 different?""  Failure.  Very few shooters, almost non-existent now, take off the kid gloves, throw you to the wolves, and are unapologetic about kicking your ass.  Most gamers don't have any real world experience in doing CT type activities, so in order to be successful in the game you had to LEARN to play the game, as the tactics and methods were somewhat reality based.  There was no hand holding and nothing showing what you did wrong (other than being dead).  It was all the failures leading up to that perfectly executed mission that made it so gratifying and addictive.  It's like golf.  You can have crappy shots all day, but you hit that one perfect shot and it makes the whole day worth it and the reason you go back to play again.  When I first started playing R6, I had no idea what I was doing.  Most of my missions ended in catastrophe.  Over time that slowly began to change to a point that once I saw the mission intel I had a pretty good idea how to approach it, when to be aggressive or conservative, and how to avoid completely screwing up.  Once you got the basics and could complete a mission on a consistent basis, then you could experiment with different tactics.  R6 had 3 steps for me: Learning the game, becoming good at it, and mastering the game.  Steps 1 and 3 are almost non-existent anymore because the mechanics of games have become simplified, almost standardized in a sense."

Rainbow6,3bmz7c,kreios86,5,Tue Jun 30 21:12:50 2015 UTC,"Rainbow Six to me is tactical planning, before every mission we had the blueprint of the area the team was going to be deployed. I chosen my teams entry, plotted where they would wait for my order to breach the door. It was 1 bullet and you're dead.  It was about going in slow and steady, planning before entering a room, using optiwans before entering a room to see where the terrorist has the hostage, and then pressing a button for the ""Alpha go"" call for the breach and flashbangs. It was about going in quiet, sometimes setting up sniper for the ""Sights are hot"" to take out the guy who will detonate a bomb if he hears or sees you.  Rainbow Six was about high risks with great rewards. You died a lot, and that made you go back to the planning phase, to redo the plan, to have your supporting AI enter a different way route in order to be successful. This was Rainbow Six to me. If you want a real Rainbow Six game just follow the formula that Rainbow Six 1-3 had set."
Rainbow6,3bmz7c,Nogarda,7,Tue Jun 30 16:27:33 2015 UTC,"Rainbow Six To Me? It's the game that got me into competitive multiplayer games, the game that got me interested in books (now I read, Like a lot a book in my room, car, bathroom, kitchen, living room, etc all going at about the same time), the game that put me into my career path of Game Design. This game is more than just a game to me it was a Key that opened up doors to such amazing places and people. Besides that RB6 symbolizes that hard to reach middle zone between Simulations and Arcade games like Call of Duty and the such.  The Originals of the series didn't hold your hand that much. Before you even jumped into the real game you could sit for hours just tweaking each operator on your team your specific standards than plan out the entire mission. I had friends that never really played the missions they just let the other teams do all the work. IT was a place to go for some Counter Terrorism fun. The Multiplayer was just about the same, you know minus the planning sometimes, but I would sit in a private server for hours just tweaking my operators sometimes. I would log in one day be in a mood and be able to pick a weapon that assisted me in blowing off steam, or vice versa if I wanted it to be. The Older titles are still around today because the players were given enough rope to create their own servers, as some are still on today I've seen, and create our own content for us to enjoy. Rainbow Six is the corner stone of what gaming used to be to a lot of people."
Rainbow6,3bmz7c,splashz0ne,4,Tue Jun 30 17:21:20 2015 UTC,A single bullet kills you. Corners terrify you. Teamwork is an essential  requirement of success. These are the tenants I learned from playing Rainbow games from Rainbow Six 3 and backwards.  There was a trailer of a video which showed how it is still possible despite all these factors to fulfill the objective of rescuing a hostage within six minutes.
Rainbow6,3bmz7c,Majjixio,5,Tue Jun 30 18:20:13 2015 UTC,"Rainbow 6 would be:  A stealthy strategy shooter. For me, it's always been more of a strategy game than a shooter. Shooter games like COD and Battlefield are simply guns a'blazin. Strategy games like SCII or LOL have basically no shooting except for individual characters, and is actually commanding different or single units. Rainbow 6 has always been a mix of the two. Learn how to be quiet, then go in, kill the enemies, celebrate quietly, move on, so on so forth. It is, in all honesty, what every other game should aspire to be. It is much more realistic (i mean like, as much as it could get) than COD yet much more fast-paced than League."
Rainbow6,3bmz7c,n0ra,4,Tue Jun 30 17:31:04 2015 UTC,"I will like to echo what everyone else agrees with.  Also, Rainbow Six was always unique to me because each map was generally small, and set up with multiple spawn locations to create different types of scenarios, and mash the action into different choke points.  It was set apart from the run-n-gun, clear a room, then die getting shot in the back from a guy who spawned in the room you just finished clearing.  Achieving kills had value.  Once you killed a guy, he was no longer a threat for the rest of the round and now it's time to hunt for the others.  The more you kill the easier it gets (provided the last guy on the other team isn't Jack Reacher or some sort of war hero).  Be careful of your movements as you only have one life to spare, and use your ammo wisely as it is limited as well.  You never know when that last grenade might save the round.  The choke points R6, RS and RvS provide an additional competitive presence by seeing who is better at holding that choke point better than the other team.  I loved the weapon and equipment slots options, you can carry extra mags but it fills up an equipment slot, so fill your slots wisely.  Map Editing.  RvS and even Rogue Spear provided so much longevity to the series by supplying tools to create and share custom maps.  A lot of talent lives in the R6 community and it's a shame to not provide an outlet for awesome maps to be shared."
Rainbow6,3bmz7c,RealityKing4Hire,10,Tue Jun 30 19:51:20 2015 UTC,"Rainbow Six for me is, lethality, FPS, CQB, tactical, teamwork, community, competitive, no respawn, skills and the satisfaction of mastering a challenging game that doesn't hold your hand and treats you like a grown up.

It was a game about planning and thinking and knowing how to set up and execute every part as a team.  The older games were just difficult enough to require a certain level of competence to keep everyone alive while not being so hard as to render any situation impossible, with my only real complaint about them being that there was rarely a situation where I would need to improvise in a mission (or maybe it just means that I am a master planner).   Even if the games were to get more cartoony, as long as there was a necessity for planning and coordination it would still feel like a Rainbow Six game, whereas the Vegas series felt more like another cover based shooter."

Rainbow6,3bmz7c,ross84cr,3,Tue Jun 30 17:14:27 2015 UTC,"I can rant about this for hours and bore every hardcore R6 fan with it, so I'll try to be short. I've rent Rainbow Six in 99 after reading about it in a game magazine. I still remember my first reaction, WTF? I can't see the gun!!! But after playing it I knew R6 wasn't one of those action packed dumb fun shooters, no, here you need to apply tactics. It took a while but instead of starting a shooter game and just fire away for a few minutes until I was bored, a round of Rainbow Six was a true experience that required time, planning and involved a lot of tension. Rogue Spear was released around 2000 and I also rent that at the library (made a less legal copy of it, I was a young kid with no money to spent so ... sorry for that), with Rogue Spear you could look around corners which added a lot extra to the gameplay. The first level, the Met, is one I will never forget, I will never ever be bored playing it and I will never have more fun in a game level. To me Rainbow Six is not just a computer game like the others, but like a book :-) I also enjoy reading the missions, extra infos about characters, weapons, well everything is just so fine."
Rainbow6,3bmz7c,MRMYSTICIGR,3,Tue Jun 30 19:57:18 2015 UTC,"The heart of R6 for me has always been the single player campaign, planning and executing missions with precision, operating in that grey area between a SWAT team and a Military Unit, hitting GO-Codes to coordinate an assault from multiple directions. Each mission was a puzzle to be solved, not some mindless frag fest. When you have a single player like that, a good tactical multiplayer will naturally follow. When you try to start with the multiplayer, things are a bit more tricky. You get distracted by trees of balance, casual vs hardcore, etc and miss the forest of a realism based tactical shooter entirely."
Rainbow6,3bmz7c,mk28,3,Wed Jul 1 12:00:47 2015 UTC,"Dear Chase , this question is perfect, but with a bad timing. This question had to do to the community at the beginning of the development of the game. I read beautiful answers, but only 20% currently reflect the beta version of the game now. Rainbow Six for me was the creation of a community of players and friends, then came the game. The bond that has always united us was the feature so realistic Rainbow Six: check your six. With great regret I do not see these sensations in Siege . I do not want to be too melodramatic , but the Rainbow Six told by all of us is dying... We will expect the phoenix."
Rainbow6,3bmz7c,guyinthecap,3,Thu Jul 2 22:57:14 2015 UTC,"Rainbow6 to me is very similar to Socom in the sense the game is about growing up, and adhering to a learning curve.  At a community level Rainbow6 is about building friendships and concentrating on teamwork and doing your part.  Every person is integral in the success of a mission.  Lone wolfing leads to watching others play (Dead), as does not thinking before acting.  Establishing what your skills are and what you can bring to the team was considered common place conversation.  Bringing strangers together to function as a cohesive unit to achieve the victory.  Not to achieve 10 kills without dying, not to achieve all knife kills, not to achieve sitting in a corner padding your k/d camping a loss. Rainbow6 to me was a beacon of how a game should play.  One life per round creates such a demand for performance and being methodical.  I have spoken in Ted talks about how respawn is actually damaging the upcoming gaming generation.  It works as a buffer allowing people to make the same mistakes without consequence, is debilitates learning curve and increases the amount of time required to improve by excess.  This behavior may start and be enabled in game but it will eventually permeate the gamers social structures and life decisions.  Rainbow6 teaches you to own your mistakes and not take for granted what you are given for opportunity.  No one wants to sit there for 4 minutes watching your team play because you didn't think before you acted.  Also on a Siege note, the surveillance cameras that you can watch while dead and still communicate with your team used to be considered cheating.  Please consider removing it, if anything allow people to tweak their loadouts, or possibly even select a different operative (I am a little on the fence about this one), while they are dead and waiting.  Reminding people that actions have consequence was one of the great parts to Rainbow6. On a tactical shooter level Rainbow was the epitome of the definition.  Planning periods, gathering Intel, synchronized execution, establishing urgency while punishing haste or overzealousness all of these used to be what Rainbow 6 was about. These things are missing from shooters today.  Establishing value in player lives, thinking, communication, teamwork, and rewarding smart play not just twitch gamer reflexes.  These are what I would like to see in the future of Rainbow6, they are oldie but goodie attributes to a tactical shooter. Stop babysitting my game, if I want to not play as part of a team, and just run around the map, punish me for it.  If I can't figure out where bullets are coming from and I am terrible at clearing corners let me fail.  Please bring back the importance of development as a gamer, Rainbow6 was unapologetic, and relied on the individual to ascertain information, and come up with a solution.  If anything hit markers, player outlines, direction of fire indicators should be introductory tools and tips that get turned off after you pass a certain milestone. (Perhaps 20 match wins with a positive K/D?)  Ammo pools are another tool that prevent a gamer from suffering from the fact they reload after shooting 10 rounds all the time.  In the Socom days ammo management was important, as it was in Rainbow6.  Proper management could change the outcome in a gun battle, and show whom was a more proficient and tactical player.  Put some responsibility in the gamer like you used to, and make them live or die with the consequences.  There is a lot more that Rainbow6 represents for me but I think this is enough to digest on."
Rainbow6,3bmz7c,CrossBones3129,2,Fri Jul 3 07:08:17 2015 UTC,"Now I see the flaws in your way of thinking. Teamwork, tactics, and tension are merely the RESULTS that come from what the core of Rainbow Six is... Those aspects are not the core.. but the outcome of all the core elements working together. You really need to think about that.  The Core of Rainbow Six is more along the lines of semi-realism, freedom, open design on all fronts, realistic environments (not ""designed"" and artificially ""balanced"" levels with choke points, etc..), to encourage and require the use of realistic tactics and strategies. Many things you guys have done go against these concepts. Of course.. the game is what it is. Anyways, now that I see the core ideas you guys use for making this game, I can see where it all went wrong."

Rainbow6,3bmz7c,PLXGUE,2,Tue Jun 30 15:54:52 2015 UTC,"To me rainbow six is, team rainbow take on a threat to the world or some hostages, insert random tactical shooter mission here, and so on, me and a selected team(AI)chosen from a roster with different operators from different continents using customised gear chosen by me go and dispense freedom to evil mercenary or terrorists.  Also feel that shooting should feel powerful and deadly but also accurate but not pin point, short controlled bursts should be mandatory no matter the game mode.  I also feel a mag counted and magic ammo pool should be removed in favour off an individual magazine system, having for instance 5x mp5 magazines that have 30 rounds in each, using 15 from one mag and switching would result in that mag being forever at 15, I personally think this is would bring an extra layer of depth around ammo management.  On the point of ammo counter possibly could replace it with a system that tells you how heavy the weapon feels, eg, weapon feels heavy (full mag) this could pop up systematically or maybe by pressing a button or something. Pretty particular but these would make it unique and pretty stand out.  If magic ammo pool is kept in, at least limit the amount you begin with by default, maybe different characters different amounts of spare ammo?"

Nothing was scarier than lonewolfing 35 elite terrorists with limited ammo and a hearbeat sensor, choosing my attachments carefully.  I feel some of this was lost in the vegas series, as the AI not all being spawned on the map from the start - only about 5 at a time that you had to forcibly trigger by running around. I believe this was due to AI limitations which meant that they rushed you as soon as they spawned. I felt it rendered stealth gameplay useless as you were never risking alerting a map full of terrorists that you were there.  I loved Ravenshield and definitely want some of that gritty, tense feel back. The limping when you injured was awesome too, as was Pilot gameplay (A player was forced to only use a pistol while the rest of his team had to extract him to the other side of the map).

Rainbow6,3bmz7c,Flachpfeife,2,Wed Jul 1 01:08:54 2015 UTC,"I got into Rainbow during the Vegas series, and it's the only Rainbow that I have played.   With that being said: when I think of Rainbow Six, I think of stopping at every corner, and using the 3rd person view to scout out each corner. Popping out or blindfiring at opponents until each room is clear. Slowly moving throughout buildings, clearing one room at a time, and always thinking of when/where the enemy will flank me. Oh, and i never mentioned the low health/one hit deaths.  Another thing that I think of is the customizability. Choosing where you have and don't have armor, and even getting to choose the coloring. The customization is what made the game for me really. With the lack of customizing at that time, it really separated itself from other shooters and it led a bigger connection to the character I was using. To this day I refuse to play Vegas with Michael or Logan (preset story characters).  That is what 'True Rainbow' is to ME. I know I'm in the minority on this subreddit, and I'm not saying Siege needs to have 3rd person. This is just what comes to mind when I think of Rainbow Six."
Rainbow6,3bmz7c,SaintsIsMe,2,Wed Jul 1 13:29:43 2015 UTC,"It's a tactical shooter series with a counterterrorism theme. What's been special about Rainbow is that they emphasize thinking about your approach and planning your movement.  Rainbow's single/multiplayer wasn't special because of the shooting gameplay or movement, it's because you have to think about how you're going to accomplish your objective. A LOT of tactical shooters have hit the realism/gameplay compromise better than Rainbow Six series as far as shooting/moving gameplay.  I've been pretty vocal in the past about supporting America's Army 2's shooting and movement system, and I think that's the best in the genre. I still played Raven Shield (Athena Sword) though, because the cerebral element was so much better in Rainbow Six."

Rainbow6,3bmz7c,Deesing82,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:57:35 2015 UTC,"Teamwork, tactics, and tension can be present in just about any competitive multiplayer game. NBA 2k15 could easily be described that way without issue as could Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare. Distilling it down to that is like distilling basketball down to ""athleticism, teamwork, coaching"". That also happens to describe the majority of team oriented sports.  Instead, it seems more appropriate to look at what sets Rainbow Six apart from other shooters.  Focus on methodical and planned combat as opposed to twitch based reactions  More punishing gunplay - Meaning stronger recoil and a greater emphasis on aimed shoots even in firefights. Worth noting that this should include how the player moves as well(and movement ties into the methodical nature as well). Too floaty or speedy and the game suffers for it.  Lethality - Fewer bullets to kill, non-regenerative health, penalties for injury(lowered movement speed, worse ADS times, less stable ADS, etc...), and limited ability to help others who've been shot...one bullet to the head is death period  Reduced Gameyness - A more limited HUD, no seeing teammates through walls, no mini-map, no hitmarkers, and even settings without crosshairs, ammo counters, equipped items markers, etc... In this I would also include no ammo pools. Ammo should be on a per magazine basis. If I reload the removed magazine should either be back in my carrier with only 8 rounds left if that's how many it had when I took it out or it should be on the floor and gone from my inventory. I shouldn't have a magical pool of 200 rounds that magically place them back into my inventory.  So far from what I've seen and experienced the game simply isn't much in touch with what Rainbow Six has been in the past. I'm on the fence about buying it because of that. The hitmarkers, handling of DBNO, and the overpowered nature of the heartbeat sensor(seriously, make it a delayed pulse and only able to see 20 feet or so) are glaring examples. As are the seeming ability to fire on full auto constantly without penalty. There's also the seeing teammates through walls.  I'm hoping this game manages to find its way back to what made this series great. We've got enough twitch based arcade oriented shooters out there. I enjoy them. But I also enjoy punishing tactics based gameplay that forces me to be methodical in my play. That's what I think the ""true"" R6 is."

If they get behind cover just throw some nades they only take a split second to vomit out from your hands.  If you get behind someone, just use the CoD style 0.3 milisecond instaknife because everybody has a knife on a chain hanging from their necks which is accessible and the most viable option in CQC.  Remark: Get the best gaming PC available so you load up the map instantly so you have time to pick the operator you fancy the most. If you're slow you might get stuck with some operator whom playstyle you don't like. Or with the sadly, way too restricted recruit operator. If you're a console player well mate, it's a gamble.

Rainbow6,3bpaz0,Pest_AWC,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:24:41 2015 UTC,With the operators you have loads of different combinations as a team to attack or defend:  Attackers:   Thermite: He has two charges that can be set off at the same time. This will cause some confusion for the defender as to which hole to cover.  Sledge: Use his Hammer regardless of electronic interference on several surfaces and barbwires. You can also bash players :) Ash: Breach for a wall from distance without exposing teammates   Defenders:   Mute: disable the drones and charges with a well-placed jammer Pulse: HBS + Nitro cell is the way to go.   There's a lot more depth than this with other operators and unannounced operators. This just based on my regular tactics in the Closed Alpha.
Rainbow6,3bpaz0,Deosl,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:39:56 2015 UTC,"Exactly, the strategies come with the combination of the different operators. Take Mute and Castle on the defenders side: combine the fortified barricades of Castle with Mute's jammers - and the attackers have to really work their way into the objective site. If you don't have emp & thermite charges (and sync them up) you are forced to take the less advantageous entry way... or hammer your way through.

Rainbow6,3bpaz0,TLSN_Troyseph,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:36:13 2015 UTC,"I guess I am a little lost on exactly what the question is here.  Do you mean strategies to complete the task, or are you asking what kind of options do we think that their should be for creating a plan of attack or defense? Personally for me if you were able to use the mouse on pc and the touch pad on ps4 to actually draw arrows lines and other stuff on the map during the planning period that would be helpful.  Also maybe a few symbols to use as short hand for how you want to proceed.  Such as x marks, bomb symbol for where to breach, and other symbols.  This doesn't have to be super sophisticated just something to convey thoughts.  Maybe be able to turn on and off colors that represent the operatives to show you three are breaching here and the line and symbol has three colors, then a single color for where your roamer is going to wait until signaled.  Things like that are simple but truly prevent confusion and miscommunication.  Also if you could call up the map and there was a toggle between marked version, or default I would use the heck out of that. That thought led me to this thought, what if you could rename and put labels on a default map in order to personalize it for your clan/ teammates.  Then when you go to planning phase you have your custom map, like if you are in a party it is a toggle option.  This would add a level of depth for me and I am sure some of the other strategists.  We all know that the names we use for call outs is often different then the default names they may be given by the devs.  Such as for R6Vegas for us the various Casinos were called different things based on the symbols on the machines or like a statue in the room. As for answering your question of how I plan to attack or defend and set up my personnel well you will just have to meet me in game to find out.  I am sure there will be standard duos though based on people preferences, but I guarantee that it won't be the same operatives played by all. As for the operative system I think this is fine based on R6 devs making you play the game ""their way"", plus it saves countless hours (seriously ridiculous amounts of hours) balancing attachments and guns."
Rainbow6,3bnnor,iceycat,8,Tue Jun 30 17:53:55 2015 UTC,"Your best video yet!  Perfectly logical reason for having a casual and a HARDCORE mode for the game.  Individual Server-Side settings for each crutch is important, but I feel we need a standard ""Hardcore"" setting with most crutches removed in order for people to know what they are getting on a server.  What I've always asked for is for there to be 3 ways to show a server: Casual, Hardcore, and Custom.  Custom could have any combination of settings, while the others are specific but possibly you could change time of rounds or rounds in a match."
Rainbow6,3bnnor,Pest_AWC,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:25:20 2015 UTC,"There needs to be hardcore and custom. If crybabies want friendly wallhacks and hit markers they can choose a custom server, let hardcore be the default gamemode"

I too wish hardcore were the default and they could have their own custom easy mode if they really wanted it, but we're a minority. The casual crowd will always be bigger than the hardcore or veteran crowd. I just want our interests to be included rather than not get catered to at all."

Rainbow6,3bnnor,RealityKing4Hire,2,Tue Jun 30 18:13:19 2015 UTC,"Anybody know why the thumbnail for the video isn't showing up? Reddit keeps giving me an option to ""retry thumbnail"" and when I click yes it just keeps saying to check back in a few minutes. So frustrating!"
Rainbow6,3bnnor,Pest_AWC,2,Tue Jun 30 18:28:45 2015 UTC,"That was something that I really liked about Rainbow6 games I played, not only did it encourage communication but it just about demanded some level.  This isn't coming out at a time where multiplayer is new, the ps4 comes with a mic, and there are many after market mics that are really cheap and in just about anyone's price range.  There really is almost no excuse not to have a mic, unless it just broke.  There is already enough unwanted interactions in online gaming, so a game that pushes you to use teamwork and communicate or else you are at a severe disadvantage is welcome and needed as far as I am concerned.  I think that is also one of the best things about owning a server, you could toggle all the stuff to make it as real or as carebear casual as you want.  If this isn't an option in the future then two modes of play are required.  Heck at least two modes are required anyway.  Crutches are never a permanent solution, they aid you until you can walk again for the most part. I really appreciated the points you made about magical information, very well stated and hard to argue why you should know all of that information.  The bullet trails especially should be little to no visibility.  If anything only high velocity rounds should have it such as snipers.  Though if the player can equip a silencer to their sniper rifle it should also be greatly reduced.    Great video Iceycat."
Rainbow6,3bnnor,Harvey_Dole,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:09:56 2015 UTC,"It's not about not having a mic, it's about not using it. When I play with my core group in private chat all we do is call out tactics and coordination. When I play by myself online with random people in team chat NOBODY is talking except for typically some weird kid who does random singing while talking crap about how he's the ""shizzle"" and they just got ""pwned"" and yells at somebody in the background while burping into their mic. Seriously. When I'm in team chat and that happens, I usually just mute the channel.  But even when you have a good group going and I manage to get someone who talks tactics and we work well together, the other 3 or 4 people on the team don't say anything even though you can see they have their mics on due to the mic icon by their names or whatever. They just DON'T communicate.  When you play with random people, that's what you get. I play with my core group about 95% of the time when I play multiplayer so it's a non issue for me. If you're in a clan or something, likewise, you'll probably not experience that. But for everybody else, lack of communication is constant. That kind of thing makes it necessary to have some of these kinds of aids to fill in these gaps of team work.   As for bullet trails, I do admit that I would love to have them in if they were ONLY used when shooting through a wall to kind of give it that dust debris from penetration sort of effect. But just through open air?..... Nope. That's why I want a hardcore mode to turn some of those effects on or off to suite my playstyle. And not just on PC, consoles too.  Glad you liked the video though!"
Rainbow6,3bnnor,geofurb,2,Wed Jul 1 18:44:57 2015 UTC,As a R6 Veteran I know my opinion may be biased but I disagree. Rainbow Six used to be a hardcore tactical game. I wouldn't call it a simulator necessarily because it still had some unrealistic elements to keep the game fun over simulation but the heavy learning curve was a major part of what made R6 great. It made R6 stand out from the rest of the generic shooters out there. IMO they have lost that distinct element of uniqueness in recent games and I think with all of these crutches it is still lost on Siege.
Rainbow6,3bneac,brotrr,15,Tue Jun 30 16:47:10 2015 UTC,"Confirmed that hipfire is awful (heh), and that we've increased the time to ADS.

Rainbow6,3bneac,electr1cpanda,2,Tue Jun 30 21:05:02 2015 UTC,"That's for the reply, that's reassuring to hear! Any chance you could talk about having a magazine-style ammo system rather than individual bullets? I think that's a relatively small change that would make a lot of people happy, and it's not exactly a 'hardcore' change that would turn off the mainstream audience."
Rainbow6,3bneac,electr1cpanda,7,Tue Jun 30 22:03:23 2015 UTC,"That's actually something we touched on once in here months and months ago. It just wasn't a good player experience. Unless you're one of those people who's into deep military simulation games (disclaimer: I am totally one of those people), managing magazine loads is a distraction and can be confusing/frustrating.   And that's not meant to say we wanted to make it easy, just that the game design is focused on teamwork and collaboration, fortifying and breaching. After the Closed Alpha we reduced the ammo count to Raven Shield levels for the firearms, so there will still be some limited-ammo management involved."
Rainbow6,3bneac,Pest_AWC,2,Tue Jun 30 22:30:24 2015 UTC,"I am guessing that since it isn't an easy on/off switch like other unrealistic casual crutches, that we won't get a server side option to allow for realistic ammo management if we wish to play that way?"

Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare actually did this quite well, IMO. It's a nice hybrid between a pure pool system and the more hardcore magazine management models."
Rainbow6,3bneac,SoDel302,6,Wed Jul 1 03:21:32 2015 UTC,I really don't see doors being optional at all. I don't know how anyone can think that not having them is ok. It's definitely worth delaying the game for working doors. Otherwise I generally agree with the rest of your thoughts.
Rainbow6,3bneac,Pest_AWC,6,Tue Jun 30 18:09:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, without real and working doors the realism and immersion drop tremendously.  Do you think they spent time adding them to all the previous R6 games just as eye candy?  No!  They allow real attack/defend tactics, and increase tension and depth of strategies!"
Rainbow6,3bneac,SoDel302,2,Tue Jun 30 20:02:51 2015 UTC,"Can you articulate why you don't think doors are optional?  I see them as a nice to have, but I feel like if there are any doors, they're going to be blown up by breaching charges anyway just like walls are now. The whole sneaking up to doors bit doesn't fit the theme IMO. It's a siege and the defenders know that the attackers are coming, and are setting up appropriately."
Rainbow6,3bneac,Majjixio,5,Tue Jun 30 19:38:24 2015 UTC,"By not having doors you're removing ALL of the cool factor about blowing through the walls. Think about it this way. If you have doors, wouldn't you generally expect people to come through them? Nobody is going to walk through an open doorway when they're clearing a room in this game. They'll plant a charge and go through the wall. So what was a neat thing will now happen EVERY time. You've effectively turned walls into doors in some way, just without being able to close them, which is half the utility...  Not to mention, I don't know how many charges an operator carries, but having doors and a small number of charges, like 2 per life/round, would force you to use them very carefully. You wouldn't just go blowing through walls and doors for fun. This again would make it far more tactical and less arcade-ish. It would also mean doors become more important. Maybe you place one on the door and one on the wall. Blow them both simultaneously and come in just through the wall. That's taking advantage of the environment and playing on people's assumptions. Which is what makes R6 what it used to be in the first place. Blowing a hole in the wall and coming through with no other distraction is plain stupid. This is what everyone will do when there are no doors though."
Rainbow6,3bneac,SoDel302,4,Tue Jun 30 22:32:35 2015 UTC,"I almost feel like they are putting way too much emphasis on the barricade system.  I would like it if they went back to the way R6 and Rogue Spear had weapon/kit selection, and if you wanted to carry a barricade, it would take up a kit slot.  This way not everyone is using them and they would be less of a common option. (which would increase it's usefulness when it is actually used)"
Rainbow6,3bneac,Pest_AWC,3,Wed Jul 1 04:01:38 2015 UTC,Agreed. That would make you think and strategize. That's what I want in a game.
Rainbow6,3bneac,SoDel302,3,Wed Jul 1 14:09:45 2015 UTC,"Just like Vegas put too much emphasis on custom uniforms/faces and looking at yourself in 3rd person, Siege is putting way to much into the ""barricade"" gimmick they created.  It is now used way too much to be realistic, and they left out the more important door mechanics in order to easily implement this."
Rainbow6,3bneac,Pest_AWC,5,Wed Jul 1 14:12:34 2015 UTC,"Doesn't fit the theme? Have you played other R6 games? I wouldn't define the theme by this game.   Doors add a level of complexity and realism to the environment. It limits vision so you can't see everywhere. That means that you can use the doors as concealment while moving. It also would add sounds to the environment. If you hear a door open you're going to turn around and see what it is. If you see a door close then you know the enemies are in there, but maybe they don't know you know they're in there. It allows thousands of possible new play tactics.   Honestly I'd love to go on, but I really think that if you have to ask you'll not get it without playing a R6 game with doors."
Rainbow6,3bneac,SoDel302,5,Tue Jun 30 22:19:47 2015 UTC,Great points! Adding sounds to the environment is something I haven't thought of. Now I really want doors.
Rainbow6,3bneac,Harvey_Dole,4,Tue Jun 30 22:25:59 2015 UTC,Sounds like Siege would be a nice game mode within a complete R6 game then...but to leave off features that are realistic and a staple of the R6 franchise because it isn't as important with a limited set of game rules is a cop-out and cheap.
Rainbow6,3bneac,DL-Z_ftw,4,Tue Jun 30 20:04:52 2015 UTC,"The fact that they blamed it on server lag kinda shows that it was a cop out from the beginning. If your engine/server can't handle maybe a dozen or so doors in various states, you should get a new engine or a new server... Then again, I don't know a ton about that back end stuff. I do know enough to know that if you can't make working doors in a game with this budget, you're doing something wrong."
Rainbow6,3bneac,PeacefulBadass,4,Tue Jun 30 22:21:38 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, For the regular mode  -Outline teammate should not be always enable.  -The crosshair should not change color when your are in front of an enemy/teammate. (I prefer without crosshair, but this is not a big deal)  -The reload indicator should be remove (I would really enjoy a magazine pools)  -The white arrows should be totally remove.  -Like you said...Bullet trails should only show if the bullet penetrates an object or at least it should be reduce.  I will be more than happy with these change."
Rainbow6,3bneac,JonathanRL,5,Tue Jun 30 17:38:14 2015 UTC,"Good suggestions in general!   White arrows should be totally removed, as they have no place in a game like Rainbow Six As Harvey_Dole said: Team outlines should be disabled by default and preferably removed altogether"
Rainbow6,3bneac,geofurb,2,Tue Jun 30 17:52:27 2015 UTC,"White arrows, I still think that they're okay to have if they have a general location. When I'm playing airsoft, if I get shot at but they miss, I can still sort of estimate the general area that they're shooting from. Of course, Ubisoft could totally remove the arrows and make it for it with better 3D audio positioning and bullet impact effects Outlines I think have a place in the regular game. It's foolish to think that Ubisoft won't cater in some way to a more casual audience as they are a business that needs to make money, and the hardcore audience just simply isn't enough to justify all the money they've poured into the game. Of course, there absolutely needs to be a way to turn the outline off in a special hardcore mode."
Rainbow6,3bneac,MRMYSTICIGR,2,Tue Jun 30 19:41:42 2015 UTC,"I would say give the heartbeat operat really low penetration weapons.I know that in the trailer it showed him getting 2 dudes through the wall with a shotgun,but i think they should really tone down the penetration of his weapons.make him an an asset at delivering intel before a breach. Imo it puts emphasis on teamwork,and makes lone wolfing with him extremely difficult(considering everything is going to be barricaded)"

Notice our good pall Blitz on the right holding the MP5 MLI that was earlier mistaken for a golden MP5).  So yeah, the family is getting bigger by the day, I'd expect them to reveal the GSG-9 last, after the Spetsnaz and the GIGN that are soon to be under the spotlight.  I'm pretty sure there's more to be found but I don't think I could have found more, I'm pretty limited by what the Community team let out.  EDIT : Here's an image I made for https://rainbowsix.gamewave.fr/ that shows the (at the time) lesser known operators, I had spotted Doc from the Multiplayer trailer (upper right, bulldog icon) as well as the Spetsnaz dude that is on the left in the image above (the one with the 3 operators). I had also started speculating on the fact that the other unannounced Spetsnaz had the ability to carry two main weapons.

Rainbow6,3bnt5x,TheLucarian,5,Tue Jun 30 18:32:27 2015 UTC,"Good article. I noticed the comment though that normal was too easy and to get a challenge you had to go to Realistic. I experienced the same problem with Splinter Cell Conviction and Blacklist. Anything less than Realistic was just too easy and once you mastered that difficulty you had no where else to go. It got to the point that just to keep things interesting we'd sneak undetected to the end of a map before we started playing it ""backwards"" for a challenge or did other self imposed challenges like no shooting of lights and no reloads, or takedowns only, etc.   The article also said they hoped there would be more than just the 4 modes that would get changed up and made random for variety. I know they said some other aspects would be too, but I'd like to 2nd that sentiment as well. Throwing in some additional secondary objectives randomly or variable time remaining or variable enemy density, etc. would all be nice touches. And there just NEEDS to be an exfil process as well. Making it back out to the colored smoke on the street or on the roof for extraction was always half the fun. It shouldn't be a ""win"" if you all die right when the final defusal completes except for that one guy with 5 hit points left surrounded by suicide rushers. You should still have to make it out."

I think you're right though because the last couple of Splinter Cell games had that same difficulty setting as well. Normal was easy and easy was, just pointless. It seems like they're using the same difficulty structure here. I'd like to maybe see them shift all the difficulties up a notch if it's going to be just like Splinter Cell was, make Easy what is now Normal, Normal what is now Hard, etc. Got to the point where even Realistic was no longer much of a challenge on Splinter Cell once you got used to it after a while, hope the same things doesn't happen here. I know Realistic may be tough now, but after you've been playing it for 6 months, it might be pretty doable."

I'll just add, I don't think the single player campaign can be all that immersive or realistic, since every scenario will be a ""Siege"" with the defenders knowing R6 is coming.  The ""Siege"" idea should have been just one mode of the game, possibly used in 20-25% of the missions instead of being the entire game.  The idea that every mission R6 goes on is a ""Siege"" goes against everything in the books and previous games.

If people got the wrong impression at e3 about a key feature, they would have rectified it ages ago.   The game's main focus is PvP, it shows. However, it has some impressive elements in the COOP features from what I've played so far with the randomized objectives etc.   We don't know everything about the SP campaign and that's how it should be. You have to play it for yourself to experience the story. It's scenario based and you'll travel the globe like the old games. I prefer this rather than running through a corridor on the same location.  I agree that having no AI teammates is an odd choice, but I guess Siege is truly an experience best had with friends. You have to make tough decisions in game development, and this is one of them. Personally it doesn't affect me much, as I'm a PvP player.  But I can't help to think about how the enemy AI can breach and rappel, why can't you have AI teammates just follow you and do the same things? Could be it never lived up to their standards.  PS!

Rainbow6,3blohw,Deosl,6,Tue Jun 30 06:35:00 2015 UTC,"It won't be, and that's one of the reasons."
Rainbow6,3blohw,electr1cpanda,4,Tue Jun 30 14:24:13 2015 UTC,Cheers for confirming this!   I cringed when youtuber Angry Joe interviewed the devs last year and his highlight and concern of the R6 series was adding your face in the game.
Rainbow6,3blohw,Deosl,3,Tue Jun 30 14:47:03 2015 UTC,"Heh. Always a matter of opinion. I think I've pointed this out before, but I've gotten plenty of comments from fans who are upset that we took 3rd person cover out of the game, because ""it's what makes Rainbow Six what it is."" Kind of interesting."
Rainbow6,3blohw,electr1cpanda,3,Tue Jun 30 14:54:47 2015 UTC,Funny how changing the core elements of a game creates major conflicts within your own fan base.  Perhaps it was a bad idea to introduce 3rd person and casual elements into a series known for being 1st person and more realistic?
Rainbow6,3blohw,Pest_AWC,2,Tue Jun 30 14:59:57 2015 UTC,That's the beauty of R6 I guess. You have the old crowd and the new crowd who both like diffrent aspects of R6.  I'm in the old school crowd and I was happy you went back to FPS view. You'll never please everyone as you know :)

Rainbow6,3bonoc,SatanicBall,3,Tue Jun 30 22:10:42 2015 UTC,"THIS SUB IS FUNNY(PEOPLE SHOULD READ)! I like to see in that topic how op and others gave people more than all reasons in the world to hate Ubisoft about R6 destruction. They prove like 1+1=2, by the content and his comments that Ubisoft totaly killed this franchise spirit and what they need to do to recover some. Op is also a HATER anyone who read the thread and contents can see. I think he was trying to be polite and soft to appeal to people that is outside this hate box, to make'm understand WTF DID JUST UBISOFT DID. But by stating ""no hate"" in this sub all the hateful people(kids) didnt  even bothered to click and actualy read what is there.(there is some cool old articles about R6 destruction). Good topic whit good content. Bad thing brainless haters didn't noticed(shame on you)."

Rainbow6,3bonoc,r6soul,3,Wed Jul 1 13:36:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to stop the hate.  I HATE the fact that UBI refuses to continue a great franchise that sold well and had a definite identity for the first 3 games.  Now we are left with the term ""Rainbow Six"" meaning ""some random casual CQB FPS or TPS type game"".  The fan base is so cluttered now with opposite opinions due to the lame direction they went with Vegas having unrealistic third person cover, health regen, and non matching team uniforms.  Now we have ""Siege"" with its forced operator system instead of selecting from all weapons/gadgets, no working doors, and every round the defenders know R6 is coming instead of the stealth the series was known for.  They are going for a niche of a niche market that will tolerate this style of play.  Our only hope is for some lead developer to have the balls to put in a good case to actually create a true R6 game, with all of the depth, adherence to R6 books and original 3 games, and have the realism in that sweet spot between the casual and hardcore shooters that only R6 and the SWAT series were able to attain."

People should read this thread really. i'm NOT defending Ubisoft attitude in any way. I condemn their attitude as much as you do. Read and you'll see.  I want all them to see what happened to this loved game. But hate comments can make people stop reading(maybe thinking spam), specialy Ubisoft maybe.  We can talk about Ubisofts mistakes in a polite way. No need to spam hate in there.  I still have some hope, they can maybe delay the game and make some big changes.  We are in the same boat if you didn't noticed. We want R6 revived and upgraded.  I love this Franchise as much as you do.   I want Ubisofts attention by not offending.  I'm also trying to rescue our loved Franchise to its roots. Like you.  Just please read all that thread(my posts if you preffer) if you care.   I know, saying stop the hate wasn't the best way to get attention around here lol, my mistake.  watch out for friendly fire!

Rainbow6,3bk729,Broadbandito,8,Mon Jun 29 22:03:26 2015 UTC,"Completely agree.  I quit playing playing both BF3 and BF4 earlier than I would have like to because once the DLC starts rolling out, you either buy them to ""keep up"" or don't and the number of viable servers to play in dwindle each time DLC is released.    I get why DLC is necessary, but don't hold the community hostage with it when it comes to PvP."
Rainbow6,3bk729,tyhopkin,8,Mon Jun 29 23:06:34 2015 UTC,"I get why DLC is necessary   The thing is, it isn't."
Rainbow6,3bk729,PinguRambo,4,Tue Jun 30 01:33:12 2015 UTC,"Rainbow six was the first game I ever played with DLC. I loved Raven Shield so much on PC that I also bought the Xbox port so I could play co-op with friends and family. As soon as you put the game in on day one you could download the ""Garage"" map for free. I think they had two map packs that eventually came out. I think they were both free as well. Or if you paid it was like $1.99 or something at most. I think cosmetic stuff should be paid only because I agree that splintering the playlist if you didn't pay to play will potentially be a problem. A game like CoD can absorb that more easily with such a huge player population. I'm not sure how R6 would fair under the same model."
Rainbow6,3bk729,iceycat,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:51:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe necessary isn't the right word but it would make zero sense to not build upon a game already made.  Back in the day they were called expansion packs and I looked forward to them when the initial game was good.  Most of the blood, sweat, and tears goes into making the initial game.  Creating content for DLC is relatively straight forward and probably has a much better return on their investment (%) than the game itself."

Rainbow6,3bk729,sniperwhg,3,Tue Jun 30 00:12:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with OP, Call of Duty and Battlefront can get away with map packs because there will be a MASSIVE amount of people online, so you can splinter the gaming community over and over and still have a ton of players who just play vanilla.

Rainbow6,3blwef,JonathanRL,3,Tue Jun 30 07:35:46 2015 UTC,"Good write-up. I had the pleasure of playing Terrohunt with you at e3, but sadly one of our teammate was KIA.  Not being a big COOP player, I quite enjoyed it, because you have to communicate and work together to win. And the AI seemed challenging with them breaching the walls.  I only managed to play COOP two times, first time on normal and winning. The second time on the hardest difficulty and failing. It's quite a challenge on the hardest difficulty.  I can see myself playing COOP with friends trying different tactics until winning on the hardest difficulty. Or trying silly tactics like everyone using shields or pistol only. And with the random generator it will definitely keep me coming back for more."

Rainbow6,3blwef,jonowee,2,Tue Jun 30 08:06:11 2015 UTC,"Nice read.   It is clear that our foes are newly spawned enemies; this is not the other enemies of the house.   If I read this right, Vegas style spawning in of terrorists? Which messed up strategy and properly cleared areas."
Rainbow6,3blwef,Deosl,2,Tue Jun 30 12:57:47 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I've heard different. They aren't static in the map and won't always spawn in the same location. They are actively moving around the map, and if you got the hostage, they will actively move to the extraction zone and try and get you there.   I think they come in waves depending on what is going on. When you plant the defuser new enemies will spawn in and move into your location."
Rainbow6,3blwef,RealityKing4Hire,2,Tue Jun 30 13:04:52 2015 UTC,I would be willing to bet that if you move fast enough or are outside of the bomb area you can watch them spawn right in front of you or in a room you already cleared ala Vegas style.
Rainbow6,3blwef,jonowee,2,Tue Jun 30 13:53:52 2015 UTC,"Will wait for details and hopefully clarification from Ubisoft on this. I really dislike the idea of Vegas style spawning of tangos in terrohunt, for example fast rope in onto the roof by heli, the team clears the entire roof and top floor before proceeding to the bomb on the ground floor, I do not expect anything spawning in from the upper levels especially if I seal off the outside (preventing terrorists from reverse-rappelling into upper floors from the outside, when they also should not be able to get past the outer police cordon.) by posting players on opposing corners of the house."
Rainbow6,3blwef,Deosl,2,Tue Jun 30 14:34:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, wait for official confirmation. OP only played it once and myself twice.   I didn't play it in Vegas, but when playing terrohunt it didn't feel stale or static in regards to the AI. You always had to be aware because of the random generator that places the bombs on different locations."

Also, mind games with the barricades are fun, I often barricaded up empty rooms just to mess with the Attackers and they fell for it too often, a guy peaking into a room through a room with no idea what's inside is a really easy target.

But there is a no chance without delaying the game until next year, that Ubisoft will be able to fix the operators' uniforms that destroyed basic IFF because Ubisoft Montreal were creative enough to create 20 specialised classes, but lazy enough to not churn 115 models (20 operators, and 3 armour level recruits for each of the 5 CT units) when they creatively decided to mix and match origin CT formations, instead of operating under the unified Rainbow that would have only needed at about 23 models (20 specialised operators plus 3 recruit armour level models).  Also I'm curious about the maps, will I get to wear a bonnie hat and camo paint for jungle raids or snow gear for winter warfare?

Rainbow6,3bg43t,electr1cpanda,3,Mon Jun 29 15:17:55 2015 UTC,"Currently my most pressing questions revolve around the details of how the online stuff works.     Matchmaking/Party System/Server browser Dedicated servers - Can custom matches be ran on the UBI servers? Is there a hardcore mode or possibility of UBI to create some ""playlists"" that cater to the ""old school"" crowd? e.g modified settings that remove HUD elements? Is there a team survival game mode?  Team survival /= TDM. What function does XP play in the game? Anti-cheat, obviously not the details on how it works, but the process.  Is it active like PB, passive like VAC, or only when a player gets reported by other players?"

Rainbow6,3bg43t,RealityKing4Hire,2,Tue Jun 30 01:45:26 2015 UTC,I'm working on an E3 recap blog post covering everything that happened during the week. Should go up early next week.
Rainbow6,3bg43t,electr1cpanda,3,Mon Jun 29 15:13:25 2015 UTC,"Please have a section that outlines what's going to happen between now and release, even if it's just some announcements of announcements. I'm sure a lot of people already have a good idea what happened at E3 and want to know more about what's coming up next instead!"
Rainbow6,3bg43t,brotrr,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:54:49 2015 UTC,"That's just my opinion here, but people really need to lose the focus on extreme Realism and such that was ""felt"" in the older titles and understand that the series is evolving into a tactical and competitive shooter, implying there will be some arcadish features as well as some more hardcorish features.   I know I'm going to get downvoted to oblivion for saying this but bringing a series back to its roots doesn't mean making an exact copy of the first title, but rather recreating the feeling it gave at the time. And to me, older R6 titles were brining some innovation as well as a different way to play, not straight ultra hardcore realism."
Rainbow6,3bg43t,Djaquitchane,5,Sun Jun 28 23:12:35 2015 UTC,"Re-creating the feel R6 had with the first 3 games is not accomplished by Siege.  They did not evolve it, they devolved by removing planning, campaigns, team managment, and making it more arcade like.    I do not want a copy of any of the first 3 games, I want the continuation of the series after the first 3 games with that perfect blend between arcade COD style, and hardcore ARMA style that only R6 and SWAT managed to pull off well."
Rainbow6,3bg43t,Pest_AWC,5,Mon Jun 29 04:02:42 2015 UTC,"Exactly, there is plenty of room to improve on the first 3 games without changing the core gameplay completely. I wont dive into examples because at this point in time I don't think UBI cares."
Rainbow6,3bg43t,RealityKing4Hire,2,Mon Jun 29 05:32:17 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. The planning phase of Raven Shield made the game better because it made it a more cerebral, thought-out assault, and I think Siege captures that really well when you have a good team."
Rainbow6,3bgah9,Djaquitchane,2,Sun Jun 28 23:36:39 2015 UTC,"Ubisoft has never made a competitive game before IIRC, so my guess is no, none of these features will be in. I would genuinely be surprised if you could spectate games."
Rainbow6,3bgah9,brotrr,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:45:52 2015 UTC,"Well, they did edit Nadeo games that are all rather competitive (and had working spectator modes) but you're right, this is the first Ubisoft made competitive game that I know of (GRP excluded).  A spectator mode is one of the most demanded feature in competitive games, so they'd better make it right :D. But the game is still in development and I know devs enjoy coming around here and reading what we say so I hope they consider these suggestions seriously."
Rainbow6,3bgah9,kreios86,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:40:05 2015 UTC,What? ALl the other rainbows had huge Competitive followings. Vegas and Vegas 2 lasted longer on the MLG circuit than Gears and WoW and almost longer than Halo. It wasnt really untill MW3 or a little after that the MLG Finally said fuck it and put COD on the billets.
Rainbow6,3bgah9,EDstah,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:38:50 2015 UTC,I think he meant that no Ubisoft studio had made a Competitive game before.
Rainbow6,3bgah9,tyhopkin,1 point,Mon Jun 29 09:19:58 2015 UTC,"Yes and Vegas even had an MLG map and a special 2 disc version that had interviews/tips with pro players and that's long before, to my knowledge, that CoD even acknowledged a competitive scene.  It's because of that I was honestly surprised that when asked about competitive at E3 they said that had nothing planned."
Rainbow6,3bgah9,Deosl,2,Mon Jun 29 13:08:11 2015 UTC,"I highly doubt most, if any, of this will be in the game.  I know the focus of Siege is centered around 5v5 PvP, which is what most competitive FPSs use, but it just doesn't have that feel for a competitive type game.  I say that from my experience in the Alpha and at E3.  There are just too many non-competitive ""features"" within the game that competitive players will use and find exploits for (they always do).  Any FPS that I have played competitively remove a large chunk of ""features"" for this reason, via mods or server settings, neither of which look promising for Siege."
Rainbow6,3bgah9,jonowee,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:55:13 2015 UTC,"Good list of questions.   They have to provide a proper spectator system, but then again the devs have said their aim isn't a super duper pro e-sport game. That is up to the community to decide if the game is good enough in an e-sport environment.  Or it's just use twitch to stream :P"

This is not an accidental feature, someone had to come up with this mechanic, get it approved by supervisors, and build it into the game for point shooting crosshairs that shout ""I'm red now, you are on target even if you're not confident about it, shoot!""

Two of us were wounded and the third was low on ammo and down to his sidearm.  The game had an amazing tendency to play a quick 15 second dramatic music clip during certain moments of the mission and as we cleared room to room trying to escort the hostages out I could literally feel my heart racing. I still to this day remember that tense moment almost like a gamer form of PTSD. One of these players even typed ""sry"" as we passed the bodies of our friend's who had gone down trying to divert to our rally point to rescue us.  This was the golden era... it will never be repeated but I just wanted you to know what it meant to many of us, it was a special time..so when some of us get a bit defensive, it's coming from a good place... and a happy time. :) anyways cheers! and good gaming."

I was just mentioning the negative comments as a way of saying ""Many people (especially vets) may not pick this game up, because of the changes and the promises that were broken.""

I've played other games in leagues and ladders but nothing has came remotely close to the intensity of RvS.  COD4 and GR:AW 2 were the closest, but still pretty far from RvS.    One of the more memorable individual moments was a 5v5 match on Parade.  My team got rolled within the first 30 seconds, I was gimped and against all 5 of them.  Managed to kill 4 of them before I ran out of ammo so I had nothing but my pistol.  The last guy was also gimped and down to his pistol.  We played hide and seek in a building  for a little bit and it came down to the last 10 seconds so we both went on the offensive.  It reminded me of some action flick because being gimped and with only pistols neither one of us had any sort of accuracy.  He ultimately got me with just a couple seconds left on the clock.

My team weren't brilliant but we had quite a good climb in our ladder.  Anyway, I think I will always remember this game. We were playing on Garage, 5 vs 5, and it was the third and last map of our match. We were on a tie and it was the winning game for the whole night.  I don't remember precisely neither the map nor the tactics we were following but we were on a classic split of 2 groups (3 & 2 ops). I was with another team mate on the outside part of the map, the one with the truck and the two cars parked, near the road.  We had to make a breach on the door and regroup in the office to finish the hunt. We ran to the door from the outside, launched a frag for my team mate, and a smoke for me. We obviously had a warm welcome by two adversaries but not on the way we were expecting. One of the crazy fucker ran outside directly on the frag of my mate running and gunning with one of the only SMG allowing that in this game (MP5K-PDW). He was quickly taken down by the nad at the moment we were rushing for cover.  My team mate decided it was the opportunity to rush back into the smoke, hoping to take advantage of the surprise. Wrong. He came face to face with a guy and lost his duel. When I heard he was down I just went full retard and emptied my magazine in the smoke taking down the second fucker.  In the meantime, things went wrong on the workshop with the other group, they managed to take down one opponents but they were all killed in their way to the office.  So here I was, alone against two guys, on an open field (still on the parking outside) awaiting for a certain death. I decided with a lot of courage and bravery, to camp between the two cars with my FNC. The two other guys most probably know my position and will come to me. I wait, for minutes that appear like hours... Still bravely waiting... Until the moment I hear the door from the workshop opening, here they come. But not from the same side, they rushed me simultaneously from the two sides, one from the office, the other one from the truck. My ass cheeks were clapping in fear... And I shot, like I never shot before, two bullets on each side BOOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM. The two guys were dead before having the time to fire a single shot.  I won the game by camping like a coward :D  TL;DR: 4 bullets, two down. I'm da true MVP."

I know in Raven Shield on PC the multiplayer maps were different than the campaign maps. Maps like City Street Large, Warehouse, that snowy one, etc. were all exclusive to multiplayer and had nothing to do with the campaign mission maps. Wonder if this will be like that too?"
Rainbow6,3b357c,RealityKing4Hire,10,Thu Jun 25 16:14:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, I would love to see the outlines vanish or atleast minimize them further.  It will require more communication and increase the likelihood of friendly fire.   I highly doubt you'll see a map feature. Who pulls out a map in a CQB? From what I gathered speaking with the devs at e3 they weren't interested in maps"
Rainbow6,3b357c,Deosl,6,Thu Jun 25 16:59:59 2015 UTC,"I am not opposed to a minimap and a full size toggled map like Ravenshield had.  Since we weren't as rushed in those games there was plenty of time to check a map to make sure your team was in position and ready for an assault, or just to make sure you weren't going to hit your own team with a long frag throw."
Rainbow6,3b357c,Pest_AWC,10,Thu Jun 25 18:45:38 2015 UTC,Without the outlines the team is more likely to stay close to one another and you will be less likely to have lone wolves getting picked off.

Rainbow6,3b357c,PrecisionMode,4,Fri Jun 26 23:48:17 2015 UTC,"Personally, I don't think the game needs any form of team icons. Microphones are a thing that exists and typically FPS games rely heavily on them, especially games that are attempting to recreate a tactical combat experience. Taking away handy icons forces communication and coordination, which makes the experience much more immersive.  TL;DR KILL THEM WITH FIRE!!!"
Rainbow6,3b357c,Van_Tek,4,Thu Jun 25 17:41:19 2015 UTC,"I'm still torn about them. I don't like them for makin the game easier, I like them for streamlining communication and rapid decision making (none of: I'm right behind the wall. which wall? that next to the red room. bottom level? Nooooo top level! what, there are two red rooms? Gaaaa dude now I'm dead!"").  I could live with a compromise, like press a button to show outlines, show outlines on using the mic, show outlines while performing actions (gadgets, shooting, roping, dbno, etc...). I dunno, many ways to iterate on this, not an easy job for the game designers..."
Rainbow6,3b357c,TheLucarian,9,Fri Jun 26 08:24:18 2015 UTC,"As unrealistic as they are I personally believe they have a place in the game for pub matches.  Before you get out the torches and pitchforks, let me explain.  UBI is branding this is a ""tactical shooter"" reliant on team work.  The only way to have teamwork is communication.  Lets be honest communication in online games, particularly with strangers, is almost non-existent.  For lots of reasons people just don't like, want, or can't communicate in-game.  The next issue is even IF someone is willing and able to communicate, there is good chance they will actually suck at it.  Playing ""tactically"" is one thing, being able to be effective in verbally communicating necessary information is even harder.You take those two issues into account and you are left with a very small pool of players who can play the game as it is meant to be played.  IMO the outlines simulate the information that a team like R6 would be able to communicate to each other.  Maybe not to the level the outlines provide, but not far off.    Now when it comes to any sort of competitive play, then yes, those have no place and should be the first thing to go along with ANY hitmarkers and bullet tracers.   I think the biggest key here is allow players to have the choice and not just with local host games, but within the dedicated servers as well."
Rainbow6,3b357c,tyhopkin,3,Thu Jun 25 18:02:09 2015 UTC,"Insurgency player here, another game that's designed to be played tactically with a squad that works in unison. Can confirm that a lot of the time, people just don't bother to communicate unless someone steps up and volunteers to be the leader.  The matches where people DO take a leadership role are always the most fun and the most likely to succeed.  My opinion on the subject is that the white outlines are unnecessary and distracting. Insurgency uses small diamond icons that only appear if a player is close enough to your location and even that seems unnecessary when you've got a good team that communicates at least a little bit with each other.  I see your point that a lot of people won't communicate properly in-game, but I don't really think the white outlines address that issue very well. I feel like taking them away will probably force people to talk to each other and the ones who have no interest in doing so will eventually be culled from the game, leaving the rest of the players to enjoy an immersive tactical experience.  That's pretty much how it goes with Insurgency, anyways. Obviously there's still trolls and weirdos who just want to hop on the mic and cause trouble with racist and homophobic slurs, but that's pretty much just an internet thing and thus unavoidable. I don't understand how people get their jollies that way, but it takes all sorts to make a world."
Rainbow6,3b357c,Van_Tek,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:36:44 2015 UTC,"I feel like taking them away will probably force people to talk to each other   I don't see how you can come to that conclusion when other games don't have those white outlines, yet still rarely people communicate properly.  I play Insurgency as well and have for some time.  Yes a small diamond is present but that only gives you location.  The best part about the white outlines is that if you see a friendly's movement/animation you can get an idea of what he is doing, not just where.  You can see the animation of someone placing a breaching charge and subsequently moving away to detonate it, throwing a frag/flash, etc.  Then you have an idea of what he/she is doing without the need for everybody communicating properly.  In a 5v5 match each person is much more important than a game like Inusurgency, which can be up to 16v16, so knowing each players actions/movements are much more critical."
Rainbow6,3b357c,tyhopkin,4,Thu Jun 25 22:49:22 2015 UTC,"I get what you are saying but you would think if a player gets tired of losing every round they would start communicating with their team mates and if they don't, well then they deserve to lose the round. They should not have some noob crutch help them that ruins the game immersion for the majority of us that do communicate. After all this is a game that is supposed to be based on tactics and realism."
Rainbow6,3b357c,petracat09,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:06:39 2015 UTC,"There's an elite group of players here who find the outline horrid, but for some of us, it's really helpful, particularly when crap hits the fan so to speak. I think the outlines being optional is great for fitting both groups, but simply destroying a useful game element for the sake of realism and to keep ""noobs"" out will mean a lower player pool over time which means less people to play with. And as others have said, not everyone communicates. Truly. Even when playing with friends, you have folks just aren't good at communicating.   There's also the issue of speed. You only have so long. Rather than have 5 people trying to ensure everyone knows where they are around one another while getting shot at and shooting and moving and we just met and I don't know the map... You get my point? Give the essential data of where someone is in a pub match and you can focus communication on things like, ""blow this wall so I can move here and we can nail these guys,"" which is the fun part. ;)   Basically, build in tools for new or aspiring players and let exceptionally good and experienced players custom their experience to be more difficult.   The reality of that on the code side may however be more complex than we know."
Rainbow6,3b357c,Harvey_Dole,2,Thu Jun 25 19:41:17 2015 UTC,It does not have to be removed completely . The outline can be useful. We may have to push a button to make them appear for a few seconds .
Rainbow6,3b357c,Harvey_Dole,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:44:25 2015 UTC,The outlines can be useful when cooking a frag or placing a breaching charge but to have them up at all times is distracting and unnecessary.

Rainbow6,3b357c,K-Hour,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:15:34 2015 UTC,"majority of us that do communicate   I don't think you got what I was saying at all because the majority of players don't/can't community properly.  For me something like this will actually help reduce the frustration aspects of PvP games.  If I see someone on my team not playing as ""part of the team"" and doing something that isn't helpful I (or any experienced player) can either A) say something in hopes they change what it was they were doing/not doing or B) Change my tactics to account for it.  This can happen without the need for every single person on your team communicating effectively, which we both know WILL NOT HAPPEN in pub games.  I've played just about every online shooter under the sun since 1998 and this has and will always be the case.  Competitive matches are different and I addressed those in my original comment."

Rainbow6,3b357c,Van_Tek,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:06:35 2015 UTC,"Friendly fire is part of the experience. It's an effective teaching tool in and of itself. Either someone shoots/grenades you or you shoot/grenade them and then there's an apology and you move on and try to do better in the future. If it keeps happening, you communicate with them about the issue and if they're not a total douche (sometimes they are) they'll agree to be more careful. If they are a total douche and you're sick of their crap, you shoot them in the face until they die and have done with it."

Rainbow6,3b357c,electr1cpanda,3,Fri Jun 26 00:06:51 2015 UTC,"Unpopular opinion, but I like having some kind of teammate indicator in pub matches.  It doesn't have to be a full outline, but I believe in some kind of indicator that allows you to track your teammates.  Just like basically everyone else here, I am in favor of this game being challenging and conducive to thoughtful and careful play.  However, I do not like ""accidentally shooting teammates"" as part of the challenge.  Everyone is saying this feature will force people to communicate and be careful, but I disagree.  Some people (like those using this subreddit) will be careful.  But you will be at a disadvantage against the trigger happy morons who shoot first and apologize later if they downed a teammate.... just like the teammates who don't look at arm bands during airsoft (and fucking reflex shoot you point blank in the head when you surprise each other coming around a corner -_-) .  This is what I want to avoid: ""If I kill on sight, I might kill a teammate.  If I hesitate, I might get killed because the other guy doesn't pause to identify targets""  This has been my experience in airsoft and Red Orchestra.  I don't like it.  From what I saw in the alpha, the defenders looked exactly like the attackers.  So I don't even know how you would ID your targets.    That's my two cents.  Needing to identify targets before shooting them just makes it less fun for considerate players like me who want a responsive experience without needing to worry about identifying teammates and the advantages to be gained by not doing so.  It sounds fun in theory to have five people in full communication taking things nice and slow, but the fact that they make the attackers so rushed and the fact that this is going to be a mainstream game make this very unlikely.  Of course, I think people hosting custom matches should absolutely have the option to turn off outlines and any other kind of identification that they want.  edit: additionally, I agree with the other thread that said the outlines should not be in the ""realistic"" difficulty.  For private and PVE games, I'm totally cool with a lack of outlines or icons."

Appreciate you gathering the poll results but we're aware that it's the forum and subreddit community who are upset about them, so might not be the most scientific of results. Feedback from the general community during the Closed Alpha, and the regular playtests we do here, have not raised this as a critical issue.    But we haven't forgotten about it. This part of the community is important to us, and I can tell you that this issue is something the team is actively looking into. You'll have to hold tight until I can share further information."

Rainbow6,3b357c,electr1cpanda,6,Thu Jun 25 20:03:23 2015 UTC,"We gather feedback in a variety of ways. Obviously monitoring and engaging in conversations here, the things that get tweeted at us, what we read on Facebook, the forums, etc. Then there are surveys. We have regular playtests here at the studio. During the Closed Alpha almost the entire team was glued to Twitch, watching what the streamers had to say, what the fans were saying in chat, etc. It comes from many different sources, and it has to if it's going to be accurate. We spend a lot of time and energy on this.   When we see something that is common across the entire community, we act on it. For example, the hit markers. They were universally disliked, and we got rid of them http://rainbow6.ubi.com/siege/en-US/news/detail.aspx?c=tcm:152-202297-16&ct=tcm:148-76770-32 (among many other changes).

Rainbow6,3b357c,Naver36,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:21:21 2015 UTC,"Forums alone are not indicative of the general (possible) playerbase or any population. Forums, especially at this point, are likely only going to be for people seriously interested in the game (most likely hardcore people) and are going to have very adamant views about things and are not a very accurate representation of say a population of people on Twitch or other sources where people can just see gameplay and say what they like and don't like about the game.  Most people who are general populace are going to look at things like videos, not go out of their way to find forums and post about a game coming out in 5 months. That right there is flawed methodology to think that it is an accurate representation of the whole. I've been playing (and subsequently hooked) since Raven Shield. I don't share some of the opinions posted here because I am also looking at it from a general standpoint and not just a hardcore circle jerk.   For matters like this, the outlines are necessary at a base level (should be optional, add a hardcore mode or something that will remove them or something if you want that) because it streamlines communication. It keeps people in the game. That's what you want. You are only going to have a tiny population who wants to sit around discussing location and tactic at length, doing things like this really helps keep people in the game and that is incredibly vital to commercial success as well as extending the longevity of the game. Take away some of these streamlining features and you are going to really alienate the people who will play (and in turn stay playing) the game. I'd much rather spend 10 seconds saying what we're all doing or asking someone to flank than taking 30 just to explain and get sitreps before even possibly taking an action."

Another thing, apparently it's fact he is a R6 fanboy because he played the ""living life' out of Vegas and Vegas 2 but to me, a real fan of the R6 games would be a fan of the earlier games, when Rainbow 6 games were actually good.  Probably not the ideal footage to be promoting when you're still trying to convince people tactics are needed when he goes lone-wolf for a lot of the gameplay and at the end he emphasises that ""you can go lone gunner."""

Rainbow6,3b4kkj,MrCaboose96,2,Fri Jun 26 15:04:52 2015 UTC,"DUDE. Those are not hitmarkers. That is the weird large shotgun reticule, you said it yourself, he wasn't even shooting..."
Rainbow6,3b4kkj,RealityKing4Hire,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:34:03 2015 UTC,The hitmarkers are showing when the player gets shot. I give up. I'm obviously seeing something you guys are missing. I just hope they are gone by the time the BETA arrives.
Rainbow6,3b4kkj,TheLucarian,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:59:13 2015 UTC,Are you talking about the white arrows that indicate which direction bullets are coming from?
Rainbow6,3b4kkj,Harvey_Dole,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:26:36 2015 UTC,Yes there are white and red hitmarkers indicating the direction you are being hit from. UBI has stated several times that hitmarkers have been removed completely except to confirm kills. So why are we seeing directional hitmarkers still?
Rainbow6,3b28iz,Towelandthexmas,2,Thu Jun 25 11:24:36 2015 UTC,"On PVP, I would like a realistic mode (or even better, a regular mode) without teammate outline (At least, we should have to press a button to see/scan them), no white arrows ( those indicated the trajectory of near misses), no bullet trails, no killcam, Magazine pool system, no ammo counter and no reload indicator, no Grenade indicators... and maybe no crosshair  I have no problem with revives . They ask a good team game play , they are limited..."
Rainbow6,3b28iz,Harvey_Dole,2,Thu Jun 25 12:45:27 2015 UTC,"There should be a Realistic mode which it sounds like there is and there should be a hardcore setting you could play hardcore settings on easy, normal or realistic.   Hardcore settings would be removal of outlines, removal of incoming fire and grenade indicators, removal of kill cam (except match end) removal of excess HUD elements and removal of bullet tracers.  This would be a host enabled option so anyone playing in a hardcore lobby would be affected by the same settings.  That's what I would like to see if they insist on keeping these visual aids in. Or else do the reverse have that be the default and create a casual setting where all those features are turned back on. But I think they're going for the visual aids as the default unfortunately."
Rainbow6,3b28iz,iceycat,2,Thu Jun 25 14:00:57 2015 UTC,Great to hear that it's likely a option to turn it off. Even better if it's an option  to turn it off for all in game.   But all if this seems to be bouncing around 'private and 'custom.  A way to play like this with public is ultimately what we want to hear.
Rainbow6,3b28iz,electr1cpanda,4,Thu Jun 25 21:24:43 2015 UTC,You can turn those options off in your settings
Rainbow6,3b28iz,CrazyKy1e,6,Thu Jun 25 14:26:30 2015 UTC,"But that only applies to the player, so you're either at a disadvantage or you just have to deal with it. I don't see why they're in the game in the first place it doesn't seem like anyone wants them."
Rainbow6,3b28iz,djp912,3,Thu Jun 25 14:49:35 2015 UTC,""" I don't see why they're in the game in the first place it doesn't seem like anyone wants them.""  It's part of their ""vision"" you know along with magic healing bullets, a world where possession of door hinges have apparently been outlawed under penalty of death, and I'm going to go out on a limb and guess a SP that will involve going from one linear, scripted cinematic event to another...I'm actually glad they aren't including AI support characters now that I think about it as all they would do is serve to drive the player on the tightly scripted movie that I occasionally get to click a mouse button while watching.  I guess I expect those  player outlines were inspired by Left 4 Dead, which was popular as a multiplayer game.  So if I were Ubi and trying to shove the tactical shooter square peg with brand recognition that we happened to own the rights to into the potentially profitable FPS niche round hole of quasi competitive/casual console multiplayer market it would make sense to adopt them. With that in mind I have a suggestion.  It might be too late in development but if there was a sequence where we get to drive an MRAP/Bear or other armored vehicle, we should really be able to shoot a turtle shell out of the front of it at the enemy...I think it would be a big hit.  Tactics....Teamwork...Tension."

Rainbow6,3b28iz,djp912,3,Thu Jun 25 15:25:54 2015 UTC,"The central problem as I see it was that they conceived a few gimmicks (destruction/barricading/niche market then molded the core IP to work with the gimmick rather than figuring out how to make the gimmicks support the IP and if that wasn't possible removing the gimmick.

I imagine everyone in here is gonna down vote me for saying it, but for new players who aren't as die hard/dyed in the wool, the game some of y'all want sounds completely unaccessible for someone like me - especially knowing someone on voice com is going to scream at me for not doing something correctly even with the HUD, outlines, etc.   Just reminding y'all that you have an opportunity as a community to have a game that brings new players in and gives them the experience you've loved over the past decade and have them coming back for more. Eventually us aspiring CTUs will be just as gung-ho as you and throw all the HUD out the window, but for now, you can't expect everyone to play at the same level from day one and have them not go, ""welp, forget this, guess I'll settle for xyz basic shooter."""
Rainbow6,3b28iz,JamesBigglesworth,2,Thu Jun 25 19:53:33 2015 UTC,"What xyz basic shooter already has player outlines? I honestly can't think of any, and it seems to be a goofy feature to expect in any fps. I've only seen it in CS:GO in spectator mode.   I don't think most of us here are advocating no HUD, but player outlines in a game supposedly made for realism just doesn't fit. Remember the reveal trailer? Granted it was scripted, but ""hey I'm going in the living room, don't shoot"" is something real operatives have to deal with."
Rainbow6,3b28iz,petracat09,-1,Thu Jun 25 20:25:21 2015 UTC,"I was more referring to the overall concept that folks seem to want to strip everything out, just happens to start with the outlines. :)   To be clear, when you're close to a teammate, there isn't an outline. It's just if they're behind a wall, etc that they show. I see your point about the reveal trailer though - we don't see teammate outlines on those who are below when he's blowing the floor.  For me, I think the speed of underlying communication still makes them useful. Yes, real operatives have to deal with it, but in pub matches, you can't rely on everyone being on the same level. Especially with friendly fire and one shot kills, I don't want to have to hope that my teammates understood where I am - I want them to know and pay attention."
Rainbow6,3b28iz,Trujew,3,Thu Jun 25 20:53:07 2015 UTC,"Im sick of seeing this as if its some sort of real solution. How about server side setting to force them to be off for everybody? Doesnt make sense for me to turn mine off, if everyone else doesnt."

Rainbow6,3b0zza,JamesBigglesworth,6,Thu Jun 25 02:31:02 2015 UTC,"This would be cool, But I doubt they'll account for it. Lighting is probably not that dynamic from every source. If they did, that would be cool though."
Rainbow6,3b0zza,iceycat,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:02:20 2015 UTC,"They mentioned they have night/day cycles, and i assume the lights go on at night, or that they have some other dynamic lighting in place already.   I agree it's probably too late for this happening, but dynamic lighting and being able to shoot out the lights like in splinter cell games would be really cool way to boost the tactical gameplay."
Rainbow6,3b0zza,iceycat,2,Thu Jun 25 14:42:57 2015 UTC,"Lighting is usually ""baked"" in video games. This means that rather than calculating things like ""ray tracing"", ""ambient occlusion"" or ""global illumination"" on the fly they render all that information out once when they create the textures and then literally bake the way the light looks into the textures so that doesn't use up cpu resources to calculate that out each time the map loads. They would have a different bake solution for day maps versus night maps as well. We do know that there are some dynamic lights for sure, or at least did as you can see in some gameplay from last year the light in the living room swings around when a breaching charge is placed on the floor and goes off. The light swings around and so does the illumination. It's not uncommon to have a couple of dynamic lights like this while the rest are pre baked as this creates an illusion of dynamic lighting when in fact it's only partial, sometimes VERY partial.   A game like Splinter Cell has special lighting information and characteristics coded into the way the game engine handles things. Even Splinter Cell has some pre baked lighting - all those pesky lights that are ""unshootable"". Engine resources can only do so much before you tax the system though. I've got to assume that with the destruction system that there's probably not enough resources left over to calculate things like ray tracing, ambient occlusion and global illumination on the fly as well for most lights. We might see a couple of ""hero"" lights that might be dynamic here and there but not enough to function as a system for things like shooting out lights or taking them offline when an EMP hits.  Of course anything is possible, but I would be truly floored if they could optimize system resources to the point where it could handle all those layers of dynamics between destruction systems AND lighting systems and that's not counting the particle systems and the volumetric systems that are in play with all the smoke and dust and explosions, etc.   I'm not a game designer, but I know a little bit about a little bit of this kind of thing and I think it's quite unlikely. But I can't say it's impossible either I suppose..."

What is their current purpose? Disabling smoke traps? Why not just shoot them?   Really they're only good for disabling jammers directly behind a wall and that's it. It'd be cool if they disabled the lights, too."

Rainbow6,3b1qr7,Strikerrr0,2,Thu Jun 25 07:06:37 2015 UTC,Didn't BF4 go through a whole situation where the community wanted visual recoil to be removed?
Rainbow6,3b1qr7,brotrr,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:51:11 2015 UTC,"Different kind of shake. I'm talking about the screen shaking, not the gun animating so that it looks like it is recoiling, but the bullets are going somewhere else."
Rainbow6,3b1qr7,bleepblopbloop,0,Fri Jun 26 00:51:19 2015 UTC,"yes, because it is a different community.  CSGO is meant to be a competitive shooter so the community wanted there to be a larger skill gap with more skills than just being able to flick fire.  Also, combat takes place at a much closer range than BF4.    BF4 on the other hand takes place at long range and is meant to be more casual and arcade like (not that those are bad things).  Because of that, the recoil became a nuisance because the player base is looking to plug in, murder people, capture points, and move on.  That's just the type of game it is.   R6S on the other hand seems to be a casual FPS marketed to be a competitive shooter using the namesake of a realistic tactical shooter sim.  I think it's trying to be too many things at once..."
Rainbow6,3b1qr7,brotrr,4,Thu Jun 25 16:04:44 2015 UTC,"Well no, the issue in BF4 was that the camera shaking meant that the bullets weren't going where your sights were aiming. They eventually changed it so that the visual recoil was removed, and what you had left was the actual recoil of the gun. So if anything it became less casual and less arcadey.."
Rainbow6,3b1qr7,bleepblopbloop,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:28:54 2015 UTC,"oh really? I didn't get into BF4 until pretty late after its release, the above was just what I was told.  I didn't know about the camera shaking bit."
Rainbow6,3b1qr7,Djaquitchane,2,Thu Jun 25 17:46:34 2015 UTC,I think the devs already explained they don't want to have the camera bob and shake everywhere to make sure the center of the screen always at the center.  I'm not sure if I made myself clear.

After trying the actual alpha, and the fact that they release a ""beta"" 3 weeks before release, has sadly made me lost all hope for this game. This game will be like Evolve, possibly will have a playerbase the first couple of weeks, perhaps months.   One thing I don't get, if a company KNOWS it's game is good, how come they cant release a beta long before its actual release? Blizzard did it for World of warcraft, and sure that went down the drain, also look at games like Dota 2 or Heroes of the Storm.

Rainbow6,3ax9qv,jonowee,4,Thu Jun 25 10:38:12 2015 UTC,"To me this is just proof that this isnt a ""relaunch"". They dragged people in with a PERFECT e3 preview 2014. As they know the game wont be close to what we saw in that preview, they will never be able to have a beta cause it will never be as good as the expectations they got after that first video. So the people who try it, wont buy the game.   Sure they can have a preorder beta, but that's just cause most people wont hassle with canceling their preorder. I've said it before and ill say it again, I do hope I'm horribly wrong and after the launch people tell me how wrong I was.  And for the people that say ""But you can't remake an old game to the standards it had back then and expect it to work... etc"". I understand this, but the first video they posted made us (the people who played the old games), think that this was basically a high quality NEW version of the old superior game. And to say that this wasnt their plan when they speak about going back to the roots is just pure bullshit.

Rainbow6,3azilr,torchedEARTH,6,Wed Jun 24 19:27:19 2015 UTC,Seeing someone exactly follow a bullet trail back to its source and headshot the terrorist through smoke is BS.  I really hope they reduce the missile trails behind the bullets.

There is a bit in the video where it looks like the operator's shield should have stopped the bullets, yet the the trails keep going.  I can't find it now!    What I do like about this video though is that an operator gets downed before anyone manages to actually get into the building - which I hadn't seen before - and how aggressive the AI is in punishing the players when they make mistakes."

Rainbow6,3azkr2,pedroabreu39,22,Wed Jun 24 19:43:44 2015 UTC,"I am glad you liked it so much.  It's definitely good to hear positive comments and to know that there are fans for this type of game.  I'm up-voting you for that alone.  Unfortunately, most fans like myself of the original series want UBI to get the message that they need to quit slapping the R6 name on anything they choose because it is a shady way to get money from people that played the old games and have a certain expectation of an R6 title that Siege in no way meets.  Had they given this another name, the game would be judged on its own merits.  For me, frankly, if I want something casual with so many crutches I'll just go play COD or BF.  Those are franchises that tried to advance their games with each version, not drastically change the feel of the game to draw in other gamers.    Even if they made Siege more hardcore and put in working doors, the Operator system and unlocks are restrictions that I won't tolerate after 15 years of being able to choose from all weapons/gadgets and create my identity...and not play a pre-named character I have to rush to choose or be stuck with recruit or whatever is left.  Congrats on finding a game that you can't wait to play again.  I haven't experience that since Rogue Spear and Ravenshield were released.  To each his own. ;)"
Rainbow6,3azkr2,Pest_AWC,4,Wed Jun 24 19:56:52 2015 UTC,"Upvoted for the same reason, but I just can't get past the fact that there are no doors. I don't even know what to say other than if they don't put something as simple as working doors in the game, I'm not buying it.   I can stomach the operator system, it's an interesting manipulation of the game. Not my favorite but I'll give it a $60 shot I guess.   However, the simple fact that they're trying to appeal to every single consumer proves this game will be garbage."
Rainbow6,3azkr2,SoDel302,4,Thu Jun 25 01:00:31 2015 UTC,"my problem is that sure its fun, but its fun in a casual bf or cod way- when its billing itself as a small team tactical game. i wish it would play more realistic (recoil, no melee etc) because i dont myself ever buying it if its just a wannna-be cod"
Rainbow6,3azkr2,prtyflkjdie,3,Thu Jun 25 03:48:12 2015 UTC,"What I never understood is why they're trying to appeal to a casual audience now. I get they want to appeal to the widest range of players possible, but I mean... people LIKED what they saw in the original E3 trailer, people wanted that slow-moving tactical CT vs T gameplay that they saw, and they were excited for it. Why would you change it from that? That's what people wanted, that's why people were excited, there's no reason to show something like that to people if you plan on releasing an entirely different game to them."

Rainbow6,3azkr2,TheOven,7,Sat Jun 27 06:17:11 2015 UTC,"Ok, so you played the alpha but still found it tactical? because I found it to be anything but tactical and also found that the run-and-gunners did just fine by basically going Rambo.  The issue of the defenders also camping the windows and taking out half your team 5secs after the round started also showed that you needed no real tactical ability or using the heartbeat sensor right near a wall to reveal your enemies and spraying a heap of bullets to wipe them out.   It's great that you're happy with where this game is and who it's aimed at but for me, this was the one game that stood out from all the rest of the run-of-the-mill FPS'. But now it's exactly like the rest of them but looking like it's going to have less content than all the others, so it's quite an easy decision for me to forget this game and buy one of the 5 coming out.  I've said it before and I'll say it again, don't name and market me a game that really has absolutely nothing in common with previous games sharing the same title. Siege certainly would have sufficed in this instance and I would not have had the expectations and hopes that I did.  The alpha killed my hope for the game and everything we've learnt since then has done nothing to change how I feel."

They could have named it anything else and I would have said ""Hmm, that's an interesting take on the multiplayer FPS genre."" Instead of saying that it's a terrible excuse for a R6 game.  I still wouldn't have played it. I can't stand endless arcadey death matches over and over again, which is what most modern FPS games are including this one.  There are still communities playing and modding the old R6 games well over a decade later (in the case of Raven Shield.) This game will be forgotten in anywhere from 6 months to a year or so. At least until the $60 map pack ""sequel"" ""Seige 2: Electric Bugaloo"" comes out in Fall of 2017."
Rainbow6,3azkr2,Thergood,8,Wed Jun 24 20:48:18 2015 UTC,"Know what else is fun? Mario. Mario is loads of fun. Doesn't mean I want Rainbow Six to be a 2D platformer.  Kikewise, I don't want R6 to be a shooter in the same vein as Call of Duty. Those shooters have their place just as arena shooters and sci fi shooters have their place. But R6 should not be one of those games, not when it's already forged a compelling legacy."
Rainbow6,3azkr2,thehypotheticalnerd,7,Thu Jun 25 05:24:32 2015 UTC,"It's 2015. We've been fucked over so many times by game publishers promising everything we want and delivering none of it that it's pretty justified to be skeptical. The Alpha was horrible and this game simply isn't Rainbow Six. That's fine that you like it, but it's the same game as every other modern military shooter on the market today just copy/pasted because marketing thinks it's going to print money by making another casual shooter, slapping a well-known name on it, and pumping out DLC. Get real."
Rainbow6,3azkr2,Incursus,6,Wed Jun 24 22:24:24 2015 UTC,"Good for you if you find the game enjoyable, but I want to make something clear.   It's not so much the game that the veterans are annoyed by, but how Ubisoft toyed with them in the beginning about ""returning to the roots"" and claiming they wanted to make a ""hyper realistic tactical shooter"" but then reneging on almost everything that defines the tactical shooter genre. We haven't had a game like that since Sierra's SWAT 4, which came out in 2005. I hope you understand why the veterans are rather upset by this."
Rainbow6,3azkr2,trineroks,7,Wed Jun 24 20:17:03 2015 UTC,"For all the people who don't know what we're pissed at.  First of all, don't try to correct people if you don't even know why their angry. Nobody thinks the game is terrible in a playability stand point. It's the fact that it was branded as a tactical shooter. Returning to the roots. I mean, there's not even doors.  This post, is like you saying, that I should be happy with my new Coffee Grinder. Except my coffee grinder came in a microwave box. And I want a microwave. Not a coffee grinder. Then you come along and say ""actually that's one of the best coffee grinders in that price range and I've had a fantastic time with mine"". Great. Maybe the Coffee Grinder is fantastic. The issue is that I don't drink coffee not the content, the issue is the labelling for the supposed content."
Rainbow6,3azkr2,sniperwhg,-6,Wed Jun 24 21:27:26 2015 UTC,"I get the that it's not like the older R6, I mean it's not that realistic and everything is completely different,but you can't argue with me that it's not tactical, I mean the planning phase is not but the action phase is. And despite the no doors and other bad aspects, the game is still tactical, I've tried to run and gun in the alpha; IT DOESN'T WORK!!! And I'm happy for it, it's different from other shooter, you have to use your brains more than any other current FPS."
Rainbow6,3azkr2,SoDel302,6,Wed Jun 24 21:36:06 2015 UTC,"Don't say we can't argue with you. Not a good way to make friends and influence people.   It's simply NOT the tactical shooter that Rainbow games are supposed to be. Maybe it's not as run and gun friendly as a COD game, but that doesn't matter at all to those of us who want a real R6 game. That's not to say the game won't be fun or make money. Surely with this much marketing it will do reasonably well. However, the dev team has said that they are trying to make it as friendly all FPS players as they can. That right there should tell you that it won't do what Rainbow is supposed to do well. You can't be a jack of all trades and a master at the same time. It just doesn't work that way.   If the devs can't make a game that allows for a dozen doors to work at the same time, there's not much more that needs to be said."
Rainbow6,3azkr2,Phi03,3,Thu Jun 25 01:07:31 2015 UTC,if think this is a tactical shooter then you have no idea what a tactical shooter is. Go back and play the 1st Rainbow Six game in the series.   Then come back here and apologies.
Rainbow6,3azkr2,Phi03,4,Thu Jun 25 19:47:22 2015 UTC,"The problem here is that the book is like Lord of the rings but you get a Harry potter ripoff story instead pretending to be LORs sequel. The story is missing everything from the previous books and the author tells you he left them out because it didn't fit with his vision.   As a veterans of R6, these are items essential to the franchise. As most people have said, there would be no problem if this went by another name. But sticking the R6 name on this is just a complete insult to the name and to the fans. There are a few main issues that i have with this game in no particular order.   No squad AI. No tactical planning - I want to plan my entry before the mission to be able to control squad team members, tell them when to hold, stack a door, flashbang and enter, etc. Medic shooting bullets at team members to restore their health and magical abilities of the CT Operatives. No doors Weapon custimization and limited operative available. No single player campaign   If Ubi were able to fix these things i would be happy. But they won't happen. The game will still sell to the COD kids, im sure it will, but it won't be as successful as it could have being. And it basically runs the franchise into the ground.  Ubisoft should be ashamed of themselves to call this a Rainbow Six game."

So what's going on the rest of the time? This could be some sort of dev test mode for purposes of putting the trailer together or it could be possible to launch a custom server with less than 5 people per team.

I have been eagerly anticipating a new Rainbow Six game for years and was heartbroken when nothing came of Patriots, prolonging my struggle. I have lived and breathed this franchise since I played the original, so I was more than willing to drop obscene amount of money on a fun collectors edition....  But then they announced the Collectors Edition......  And now I am sitting here, confused as to how UBI can justify charging $200 for it. I understand UBI is not obligated to provide us with a Collectors Edition. But i really thought given how long a lot of us have been waiting for this game to come out, that maybe they thought the collectors edition should include something really cool for their loyal fans. I dont care how gimmicky they are, i would have gladly taken a drone, night vision goggles, statue, replica, etc over what they are offering.

Perhaps we could get a moderator to create a sticky thread of what has been confirmed to minimize repeat questions.  They experimented with defense moving the hostage, but it did lead to exploits where defenders would stick the hostage in an unbreachable corner behind a barricade and barbed wire and make it nearly impossible to get to by the offense.  the other exploit was just running the hostage around the map playing hide and seek.  I would suggest they find way to minimize the exploits because it adds much more depth to the game to even slightly move the hostage away from the preset points.  Ravenshield allowed anyone to slowly nudge the hostage.  Perhaps they could allow the hostage to be ""tagged"" from slightly farther away to allow offenders to get the hostage out from behind all that stuff."

It's a big part of what makes it different. If you throw in a respawn TDM then there's little difference between that and CoD or Battlefield.   To your other question, yes, SOME kind of attachment customization will be in play. We don't know what though. during a Q&A panel at E3 it was stated by the dev team that there will be attachments that are available and there will be a wide variety of sights, etc. They even go so far as to differentiate between the different Russian made sights that the spetsnaz would use versus the sights that other units would use. There's confirmed ACOG style sights and EOTECH style sights and I believe I even saw something resembling a squared off red dot sight in some gameplay footage from E3 as well. Silencers are also partially confirmed, there was a pistol shot through a window using a silencer, no word on if that applies to other weapons yet or not. No idea on other things like foregrips, extended mags, stocks, etc. just yet though."

Rainbow6,3auxsm,iceycat,12,Tue Jun 23 18:36:21 2015 UTC,"So if I understood, it goes like this:  Good:   No Health Regen   Bad:   Operators   Ugly:   Hitpoint system Revives No reduced movement speed when wounded The new ridiculous operator   edit: Seriously though, how can they say this a tactical shooter with a straight face when they implement a class that shoots health bullets. This is the spoiled cherry on top of the dirt cake."
Rainbow6,3auxsm,zouloum,3,Tue Jun 23 18:48:46 2015 UTC,"I can't watch the video because I'm at work...but is there really a magic health bullet operator now? Like, all the other things I could deal with, but a medic class with healing bullets would be an absolute deal breaker for me."
Rainbow6,3auxsm,brotrr,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:21:39 2015 UTC,"Apparently there's a ""juggernaut"" class that can shoot hypodermic darts to revive teammates from a distance. That's what the video claims."
Rainbow6,3auxsm,zouloum,4,Tue Jun 23 21:36:28 2015 UTC,"Well, good, bad and ugly is probably a bit subjective.  My personal list would be:   Good:  • No Health Regen  • Hitpoint system  Bad:  • No reduced movement or accuracy when wounded  • Magic medicine bullets  Ugly:  • Revives (just reduce this from multiple revives to only a single revive and it can go to the good column)  • Operators (open up complete weapon selection and tweak some of their ""abilities"" and this wouldn't be AS ugly)  That's my two cents anyway. Like I said, what things fall in what categories are probably going to be subjective. Some people might love the sound of Doc, other people might be annoyed that health doesn't regenerate like it did in Vegas, etc."
Rainbow6,3auxsm,III2RUFFIII,4,Tue Jun 23 18:57:49 2015 UTC,"Iceycat, I like your medic and heath scenarios..makes perfect sense. Next they'll be coming out with carrier pigeions that drop small fart bombs to insult your enemies...good grief"

Rainbow6,3auxsm,zouloum,2,Tue Jun 23 22:33:35 2015 UTC,How is the hitpoint system a good thing?
Rainbow6,3auxsm,Harvey_Dole,3,Tue Jun 23 19:00:50 2015 UTC,"Well, it's really neither good nor bad in and of itself. It's more akin to the health system of the original game in that bullet damage and location determined if you went down or not. Siege is doing more or less the same thing but you have an onscreen representation of what those numeric values are. It still takes 3 shots to drop you on average not including factors like Rook's vests, or heavy armors, etc. And 1 shot to the head is still insta death. So in that way it's far more similar to the original games as opposed to Vegas with regenerating health.   At the end of the day whether the health stats are displayed on screen as hit points or behind the scenes as in the original core games it's still functioning similarly as an end result. Just because you can see the values now doesn't mean it's that different. The only real difference was that it was usually 2 body hits to kill you, not 3, unless it was a very low caliber ammunition."
Rainbow6,3auxsm,CrazyKy1e,6,Tue Jun 23 19:11:59 2015 UTC,":( wth, that new operator is totally ridiculous.  I've no problems with 1 or 2 revives but it must include a certain degree of difficulty for the medic"
Rainbow6,3auxsm,JamesBigglesworth,5,Tue Jun 23 21:02:45 2015 UTC,"Doc sounds like a combination of two of my most hated features, operators, and revives. Personally, I'd like them to bring back the class system, gives everyone a roll to play but offers more customization. On the topic of the health system, I say get rid of revives and just have a medic class that can slowly patch up allies, but cap it so players can only be patched up to 75 health or something.  Excellent video by the way."
Rainbow6,3auxsm,Pest_AWC,3,Tue Jun 23 19:15:06 2015 UTC,"I just wish the devs would deliver on all the gameplay and visuals we saw in the original e3 2014 reveal that got me excited for the game in the first place. Stop with all the creative magical elements that absolutely nobody was asking for after they were blown away by said reveal.   It seems ever since then, the only news we've heard is a step backwards from where they were in 2014. Healing darts? Really? Did Tom Clancy sign off on this nonsense?   JUST GIVE US THE GAME THAT WON ALL THOSE E3 AWARDS FOR CRYING OUT LOUD."
Rainbow6,3auxsm,Pest_AWC,3,Wed Jun 24 01:58:29 2015 UTC,"Nice video, and while I agree with all of your complaints I don't agree with a solution being putting in a medic with different affects.  He just shouldn't be in an R6 game at all.  We also need GIMPING as soon as appropriate damage is sustained the first time, before he even reaches DBNO.  Don't wait for a revive to gimp the player, though if they have to keep this lame revive system in, the least they could do is gimp the revived player instead of him being the fully functional player he is now.  There better be a server side option to remove DOC and the entire DBNO affect.  It's just another immersion breaker."
Rainbow6,3auxsm,TheLucarian,2,Tue Jun 23 19:34:19 2015 UTC,"I would consider gimping to be part of the wounding effect which is WHY there would be slower movement speed. I should have been more specific.   I know you hate the operators Pest, while I share some of those concerns as well, it's obviously a core mechanic that's not going anywhere. They would have to rebalance ALL the game play they developed so far if they scrapped it now and start almost from scratch. Too much of the game mechanics are interwoven through them.  I think the best thing we can do now is accept that operators are here regardless of how we feel about them and try to voice our opinions on how we would like to see them tweaked or adjusted. We have to accept they just aren't going to be removed at this point, so let's work WITH them to make the game as good as possible."
Rainbow6,3auxsm,TheLucarian,2,Tue Jun 23 20:53:55 2015 UTC,I prefer to keep voicing my hatred for Operators.  I don't want there to be any confusion when they consider Siege 2 or some other future R6 game that it is a deal breaker for some of us to restrict weapon/gadget choice like that.
Rainbow6,3auxsm,SoDel302,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:39:27 2015 UTC,"Well, I'll definitely continue to lobby for opening up the weapon selection on the operators. That much we can agree on. Gadgets I could go either way on, I also wouldn't mind armor selection not being predefined as well. Medic is the perfect example, a medic should be able to be on the spot fast when needed and seconds matter, not some lumbering hulk that needs to have ranged medicine because he can't get there in time."
Rainbow6,3auxsm,SoDel302,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:50:46 2015 UTC,"I think the medic you proposed is way way stronger than a medic with normal but ranged revive. Double the revives (if it would be that way), +25% health, less gimping (if in), and faster revive, too? Every team would need that operator.  Let's talk revive from range. First, dbno is over as soon as the operator in dbno is hit again and dbno is never even happening if shot in the head in the first place. So the situation for the medic to be of use is limited already. Then, the medic needs line of sight - and before the enemy. He basically needs to be in the same room anyway, he can just do it from a few meters away. So the gadget is very situational, most of the time he could just walk over anyway - or there is no dbno. Still feeling it is too strong? Maybe as a compromise the dart gun, or whatever the device is, could stop the bleeding.  Anyway, I want to see the medic in action before bashing him already- but, I'm a little concerned with him, too, I give you that."
Rainbow6,3auxsm,nickwitucki,5,Tue Jun 23 21:16:20 2015 UTC,"I hear you man, I just can't agree that giving a ranged healing option is okay in any way, shape or form. I don't think my proposals create a character dependency any stronger than another as nothing he does results in kills or creating obstacles. Some people feel like Castle or Pulse are already ""must have"" defensive operators with Rook pulling up a close second, that guy with the deployable turret would also be able to wreck attackers all day. I don't think these abilities would be out of whack when compared to those.    While granted these abilities are stronger than the average revive, that's the point of being a medic. maybe it could be curtailed by having a medkit with a limited number of uses but it would still achieve these same effects? It's also further balanced out by the fact that the medic would have to go to the patient instead of being able to do it from range so there's more risk to the individual operator. I also proposed a light armor load out, while this makes him faster to get to the patients in time, it also makes him more vulnerable to being dropped as he does make the mad dash to get to the fallen soldier. I think it all balances out pretty well. Again, just my two cents of course.  At the end of the day though, I just cannot get behind the idea of ""ranged"" healing. Not only is it completely ridiculous and impossible it's also an easy button for revives with little to no risk to the operative. I think that makes it unbalanced as is."

Rainbow6,3auxsm,nickwitucki,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:42:54 2015 UTC,"The ranged based healing is a bit cheesy and unrealistic. I'm glad to hear that hits are punishing though. I have to admit that the health operator you proposed (with the exception of being lightly armored and giving a boost to post revive health) seems way more unbalanced than ""Doc.""   It would be really hard to give a medic class the ability to revive a teammate a second time. Mostly because the game would have to know if there's a medic on your team when someone goes down. Then what? The rest of the team can't revive the DBNO teammate who is still sitting up like he would normally be? That would be kinda clunky.   The hitpoint system is kind of neutral to me, it's just a visual display of where your health is at and honestly is better than the typical bar that would otherwise potentially clutter the HUD up more. It might be more realistic not to see it, but we've already established that hyper-realism isn't the aim here. As much as I liked Vegas, I think the lack of health regen is definitely better. I'm also definitely on board with the single revive. Any more than that and you might as well scrap any sort of realism. There should also be much lower stats for someone who has been downed and revived. Accuracy, agility, etc should all be lower.  Calling them ""health bullets"" seems overly inflammatory. Has anyone seen this dart gun thing? If not then I suggest we wait to see it in action. I have to admit I'm skeptical, but your assertion that this operator is shooting his teammate to revive is the same as the other team shooting to kill is a bit ridiculous. That makes it sound like Doc is just shooting different bullets out of his MP5 or something. I sure hope that's not the case. I imagine it being something like the auto-injector from CoD or Battlefield."

Design decision to why doors don't exist?  I know barriers are in the game so having doors would make them redundant but I think doors in past rainbow games have been such a huge mechanic, why remove them now? Operators - Most the time in the Alpha I didn't actually pick a pre-set operator, I wanted to pick the one's that had 'no ties' with the British, American flags ect. Are we able to equip any setup (weapons, gadget wise) with these or are we being limited for 'balancing' reasons?    Also I'd love to hear about select fire soon. I honestly really hope they add it in, especially with the added recoil since Alpha. To add, they really tried emphasizing on the fact that burst fire gives you more control so it only makes sense to have selected fire modes... please add it.

I wouldn't want to try and talk over the heli those first few moments when everybody is communicating about what is going to happen.  Time is already a premium.

Another way of dealing with it is just to have the helicopter model flying there at all times regardless if it's deploying a spawn point or not. Then it could still be used as an aerial surveillance point throughout the round like they showed previously and it's constant presence would never give away the spawn position. Besides the drones themselves give away the spawn position as they all roll in the same door, I mean you know if 5 drones come through the front door, then that's where the attackers spawn point was."

Rainbow6,3at182,KGB-dave,7,Tue Jun 23 10:36:26 2015 UTC,I have been a supporter even if some things were off but removing AI from probably the only game where AI Was so freaking important is just stupid IMO.   I have no idea what that vision in your mind was but it isnt a vision any R6 fan had in mind and you should have seen that. Not everyone wants to play this in co-op and planning the AI was one of the best things about the SP.   I would suggest that you try to postpone the game to reimplement things that you have remived for no reason but I think that is out of the question because of the fact that you really actually dont care about the core experience.   Its a shame really because I thought you were on the right track after E3
Rainbow6,3at182,haXona,4,Wed Jun 24 11:44:05 2015 UTC,"that's fucking horrible. So for the SP it is either Lone Wolf or Co-Op. Which means it's either horribly balanced for Co-Op (no team work required) or horrible balanced for Lone Wolf (either way too hard or they adjust HP and damage in a way that you just run and gun and don't need tactics). I hope they balanced it for Co-Op, because I don't see the Lone Wolf variant to be a pleasent experience. I would much prefer having a good SP campaign with AI teammates though."

Rainbow6,3at182,BuldozerX,6,Wed Jun 24 11:51:01 2015 UTC,"I wonder how many people who will buy this game, not knowing that it doesnt support team AI. They will probably read ""single player"" on the box, and being a Rainbow Six game, everyone will think that it offcourse supports AI."
Rainbow6,3at182,BuldozerX,3,Wed Jun 24 12:25:43 2015 UTC,Bingo!  That is exactly why they keep slapping the R6 name on whatever CQB they want to create.  The bean counters want to sucker in people with the expectations people have for R6.
Rainbow6,3at182,Pest_AWC,10,Wed Jun 24 13:56:16 2015 UTC,"If you want to see where this is headed on PC, just look at Battlefield Hardline. You can't just take away the biggest selling points of a series and then use the name as a marketing crutch to convince people to buy it. Funnily enough most people actually agree the game would've done better without the Battlefield name - as Siege probably would without Rainbow Six."
Rainbow6,3at182,My-Little-Throw-Away,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:54:57 2015 UTC,"...actually, I kind of wish it did have a different name that didn't include the R6 branding."
Rainbow6,3at182,wmurray003,5,Sat Jun 27 01:27:01 2015 UTC,"At its roots, Rainbow Six has always been about teamplay. In previous Rainbow Six games, AI teammates were designed in order to simulate this experience, but with Siege, we decided to focus on the online cooperative gameplay rather than having AI teammates. In addition, we wanted to focus on a core experience which could be played both in PvE and PvP. Managing AI teammates did not fit with this vision."
Rainbow6,3at182,themerovengian,4,Tue Jun 23 07:30:43 2015 UTC,Very sad.  Ordering your AI team was the best part.  Especially on the Xbox version where you could do it with your headset.
Rainbow6,3at182,justbuttsexing,3,Tue Jun 23 12:13:35 2015 UTC,Also the frustrating hilarity of perceived miscommunication and intent

Rainbow6,3at182,SoDel302,4,Wed Jun 24 13:43:09 2015 UTC,This is really sad. It's no longer really a tactical shooter in PVE mode if this is the case. It's just like any other FPS CO-OP mode.
Rainbow6,3at182,ross84cr,3,Tue Jun 23 13:25:14 2015 UTC,"omg... So the initial planning stage , feature story of all Rainbow Six has been eliminated?"
Rainbow6,3at182,torchedEARTH,5,Tue Jun 23 07:35:30 2015 UTC,"You know, had they not named it Rainbow Six and made it MP only I would not have had a single issue but even as far as the Vegas games were from the best R6 games they at least still shared some elements.  Siege though, it's like an entirely different game completely and I get that as times move on games need to adapt but removing so much in one hit is pretty poor form IMO."
Rainbow6,3at182,Phi03,2,Tue Jun 23 07:41:33 2015 UTC,"I think it would have helped the cause if they had said ""This time we want to try something radically different as there is a market out there that want tactical gameplay but with short rounds of high tension and bursts of action but within the world of Rainbow Six operatives and the equipment they use""."
Rainbow6,3at182,TheLucarian,2,Tue Jun 23 10:14:24 2015 UTC,"If this game had another name, i would of bought it. As it is now, im not fucking touching this game. Very sad at what Ubisoft have done to this Rainbow 6 game."

Rainbow6,3at182,TheLucarian,4,Tue Jun 23 09:20:50 2015 UTC,"Sure, but calling it ""going back to the roots"" is disingenuous."
Rainbow6,3at182,electr1cpanda,3,Tue Jun 23 17:08:33 2015 UTC,"It wasn't the wisest choice of words, I give you that, because apparently everyone interprets it a little different."
Rainbow6,3at182,CrazyKy1e,0,Tue Jun 23 19:02:51 2015 UTC,"It wasn't meant to be disingenuous, and I think the problem is in interpretation. Teamwork, tactics and tension is what we see to be the ""roots"" of Rainbow Six, and Siege is more in line with that than the most recent R6 titles (imo). Other people interpret roots based on individual features or game components, so it's easy to understand why they would be mad about that remark."
Rainbow6,3at182,electr1cpanda,3,Tue Jun 23 17:40:08 2015 UTC,"The problem with that is you could make a counter-strike knockoff with teamwork, tactics, and tension, and say you're going back to the ""roots"", theirs a lot more to the rainbow games than that."
Rainbow6,3at182,Pest_AWC,-4,Tue Jun 23 18:20:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, but that's not what we're trying to do. Your argument also applies to individual features or components. Just between us here in the subreddit, keep in mind that I hear plenty of feedback on other channels saying ""how could you take out the 3rd person cover system? that's what makes Rainbow Six unique!"" - an argument, I think, that wouldn't go over well here.   It's just a matter of perspective. But my point is that the original remark wasn't meant to be disingenuous. We are trying to make a unique game that earns its place among the other Rainbow Six titles."
Rainbow6,3at182,digitalevo7,10,Tue Jun 23 18:38:15 2015 UTC,"Well, since you bring it up...you can have ""teamwork, tactics, and tension"" in any game.  So, do those things in Siege have a strong similarity to the ""roots"" of R6, with Rogue Spear and Ravenshield being widely accepted as the best of the entire series?  I don't see that much of a similarity.  Those 3 things were heavily affected by planning phase with a map you could draw on, being able to visually identify your team by the uniform, proper door strategies, being gimped, having access to all weapons/gadgets for all players on offense and defense, and lack of magical crutches like bullet trails and white outlines.  After playing the Alpha, it doesn't feel anything like the roots.    Sorry..  I am sure Siege will be good at what it does since the programmers and artists appear to know their stuff...but Siege feels more like it could be a single and completely different unusual game mode of a complete R6 title instead of a standalone game.   Just too many things missing."
Rainbow6,3at182,BuldozerX,5,Tue Jun 23 19:09:38 2015 UTC,"I do not understand why AI could not be implemented on the co-op side. Why could there not be a squad that is partial AI and real players like the older games? If the whole squad is real players then AI wouldn't matter, but when you have a match you are playing online with one or two friends, can't the squad be substituted with AI?  This series is about a counter-terrorism unit. It has always been about pre-planning a mission, set way points, taking your time, giving orders, operating in stealth with suppressed fire, selecting fire rates, opening doors throwing a flash clearing a room and moving on. If the plan goes south, its about firepower. I don't see ANY of this in Siege (correct me if I am wrong). This goes against the foundation of Rainbow Six.  I don't know if any of the dev's have played the original Red Storm Rainbow Six games, but I would highly recommend it to get this series back on track. I fear for this title; if I want a run and gun counter-strike type game I can get that now. Where are the tactical shooter games out there?"
Rainbow6,3at182,SoDel302,3,Wed Jun 24 12:13:51 2015 UTC,"It doesnt earn its place among the other Rainbow Six titles. You just stole the name, thats it. Every other R6 games has been playable single player with AI team."
Rainbow6,3at182,Phi03,3,Wed Jun 24 12:06:14 2015 UTC,"I just can't believe that people think this is a good idea. AI teammates are what made the campaign playable. In any past R6 game I've played you needed the team to be able to fight through the single player. If you remove the AI team and still want to have a single player mode it's going to either be way too unrealistically easy (because you'll have to cut down the number of enemies), or way too hard for anyone to want to play (if you keep a realistic number of enemies with reasonable ""intelligence"").   If I wanted to play lone wolf I'd pick up a splinter cell game. Not Rainbow 6."
Rainbow6,3at182,kreios86,6,Wed Jun 24 15:02:28 2015 UTC,"So then bring in supporting AI, a 15-20 level campaign mode, and tactical planning before missions with weapon customization. Then you will have a game that earns a place among other Rainbow Six titles."
Rainbow6,3at182,PRJCTZ3R0,2,Tue Jun 23 19:18:10 2015 UTC,"You get the Bring back 3rd Person cover system from people with 0 experience with the 'Roots' of Rainbow Six. With what you just said here the entire 'Going Back to the Roots' is Disingenuous EP. I know im one of the more rough/gruff type of people here on the subreddit but as ive stated before in other places, You guys really need to knuckle down on the experience portion when it comes to focus groups. Some of them have been complete jokes.  That 'Perspective' word is a cop out and you know it just as well as I do. They use it in the military to keep you from actually thinking about stuff sometimes or to push you cause its the 'socially acceptable thing.' Let's just call it what it actually is, the 'Going back to Roots' is nothing but pure marketing."
Rainbow6,3at182,BuldozerX,3,Wed Jun 24 17:42:58 2015 UTC,"This just ultimately killed this game for me. I had major doubts since it's (way too shiny to be true) presentation at E3 14 and only got worse after the alpha.   I had a spark of hope for E3 15 that we'd maybe see some real Singleplayer action with a good campaign, but then again, we're speaking about Ubisoft here.   Can't say i'm dissapointed though, only one to blame am myself."
Rainbow6,3at182,CSKarasu,3,Tue Jun 23 15:25:39 2015 UTC,I just want to be able to enjoy single player without other people.
Rainbow6,3at182,BuldozerX,3,Wed Jun 24 11:54:35 2015 UTC,"Is this really a design decision? This is Rainbow Six known for its teamplay, the SP is supposed to introduce the MP, the SP even has teamplay in the form of co-op.  I don't know but to me it seems more likely that they couldn't get the AI to work rather than they wanted a solo or co-op experience."
Rainbow6,3at182,Insaniac02,3,Wed Jun 24 12:18:48 2015 UTC,"All I want to know, is this something that you are going to add later? ""Maybe"" doesn`t do it..."
Rainbow6,3at182,Pest_AWC,3,Wed Jun 24 17:46:19 2015 UTC,"I fully appreciate that the community developers here are essentially just doing their jobs and the majority of this stuff is way out of their hands but at this stage if the messaging and outcry from the larger R6 fan base is not getting back to senior management within Ubisoft about how extremely disappointed 90% of the community is with "" Their Vision of a new R6 Game"" then i just dont know anymore....  Its fair to say that you will never please everyone with things like this but when you are essentially shitting all over the expectations / needs of your long term fan base for this franchise then im really at a loss.  Is there some form of confusion going on here? Do the higher ups not see that we are all eagerly waiting and wanting to play and pay for a  proper next generation R6 game? madness. If you wanted to create a great R6 game you should have taken all the mechanics / featurea that have worked extremely well in the series and has been successful... take those and add it to all these new features you are building this game around. Dont tell me a team of 300 people with a combined yearly salary most likely well over a $10m and nobody made this observation?"
Rainbow6,3at182,wmurray003,9,Thu Jun 25 07:37:22 2015 UTC,"I guess their ""Vision"" of a game is one that can be made cheaper and quicker by leaving out major parts of what made Rainbow Six games good...like AI teammates, real planning phase, campaigns, working doors, and being able to choose from all weapons/gadgets instead of forced to use a pre-made ""Operative"" that even in Multiplayer has to be unlocked and clicked on before someone else takes him.  My vision shows my money staying in my wallet and saving it for companies that build on their previous games, instead of coming out with ""lite"" versions of them that are stripped of core features and changed to attract a different audience."
Rainbow6,3at182,GenericPCUser,0,Tue Jun 23 14:04:51 2015 UTC,Man AI teammates have never been a good thing on any tactical games. It's just not the same. I need real people.

They took out everything that was great about Rainbow 6, and made a bastardization of a game.   Tactical planning your AI for go codes, alpha, bravo, charlie, setting up your sniper for ""The sights are hot"", stacking AI to breach the door and do a tactical entry into a room was what made Rainbow 6 great.   They have killed the game. Congrats Ubisoft for your shit vision on what fans of the series want."

Rainbow6,3at182,BuldozerX,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:17:53 2015 UTC,"Sounds like their vision was to just cash in on the Rainbow 6 name and ignore the roots of the series.  I mean, sure, teamplay was an important part but the best thing about using AI was that the AI actually listened to you 100% of the time because you were the team lead but players definitely don't.  Have they ever even tried to casually play a tactics based shooter with other players?  It rarely works."
Rainbow6,3at182,BuldozerX,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:37:30 2015 UTC,Maybe they added some cool backstory? Team Rainbow has now recruitment Rambo and Arnold Swarzenegger.

Rainbow6,3at182,electr1cpanda,5,Mon Jun 29 05:28:42 2015 UTC,"And for those of you complaining about doors, about AI, about the planning phase... Do you ACTUALLY think they wont be adding this to the game whatsoever through patches?   Actually yes. Why should we believe that a patch is going to add content. A patch is supposed to be used for bug fixes, not for releasing unfinished content. Ubisoft also will never release content via patches. This isn't an early access game.  There will be a percentage of people buying the game on Day 1. Thats to be expected. And this is not about Dev cratering to our needs. This is about the developers making a sequel in an already established franchise that started in 1998. But  instead they have gutted everything that was great in that franchise and release a what is essentially only a multiplayer game. With no supporting Ai this means there is no campaign. There is only a lone wolf/terrohunt mode. With so much content gutted from the game it makes it seem Ubisoft have gone the easy route, and thrown together a game with no content or features but they will charge full AAA price for this. So its not about us asking the Dev to carter to us. This is us asking the dev not to fuck up the game. But they are hellbent on doing that. I want this game to succeed, i want to buy it. But with what they are doing, i won't be buying this game. And i think a lot of people will end up pirating the game. Which will cause Ubisoft to go mad on DRM again and wonder why isn't the game a success. And then we won't see another R6 game for a long time."

I get so frustrated in other games when they apply different rules to different modes.  Take CoD Advanced Warfare as an example. In public matches you can play anything and earn anything but if you go into a private match you can't earn and ranks, unlocks, or camos. You can't earn supply drops. Entire modes like Grapple mode, One Shot or Gun Game aren't even selectable as options either in private match. You wind up missing out on half the experience because they decided they want to try to force everybody into public matches for everything. PLEASE don't do that.  Not everybody even likes to play against people in the public playlists. If a group of 5 people wants to host a custom match that people can join they should have a completely identical experience from a game play perspective. If that same group of 5 players wants to make their match completely against AI bots they should also get the same game play experience.  Removing things like unlocks or rank progression is just silly because it penalizes players who don't like to play publicly. Public can be a really fun experience or it can be a really frustrating and crappy experience. So what if some people ""boost"", does it really matter all that much? If you're super worried about that I suppose you could always keep unlocks in private matches as a separate pool from public unlocks if you really wanted to. Either way, don't have a reduced gameplay experience for any players that prefer private matches please."
Rainbow6,3au16p,Livinpink,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:13:57 2015 UTC,Interesting perspective. Do you have any examples of games that do let you progress in custom matches? I personally can't think of any off the top of my head.
Rainbow6,3au16p,FlanjeUK,2,Fri Jun 26 20:22:16 2015 UTC,"Vegas 1&2 both allowed you to unlock everything in custom games, I never played a single ranked/matchmade game just custom games and got to ""Elite"" rank and unlocked every camo/weapon etc. The only difference was it didn't record any kill/death stats. I think if they unified the progression/rank unlock system the same way as the Vegas games did but added seperate custom/ranked stats it would be the perfect solution."
Rainbow6,3au16p,Djaquitchane,2,Fri Jun 26 23:02:29 2015 UTC,"Well, Ubisoft's Ghost Recon Phantoms kinda does."
Rainbow6,3au16p,iceycat,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:22:26 2015 UTC,"YES! Glad you asked. Call of Duty - Modern Warfare 2, also CoD Ghosts (partially)  The way they handled it in MW2 was that you could unlock EVERYTHING, challenges, ranks, gun camos, gear, all of it - BUT - it would be within the given mode. So if you were level 20 with half the challenges and a quarter of the camos unlocked in public matches you might have been only Level 7 with a third of the challenges and 5 camos unlocked in private match.   It kept the unlock pools separate depending on the game mode. This way if people ""cheated"" by shooting their friends who just stood still for them 50 times it didn't matter because no one outside of the private match mode would ever see it. For players who would get frustrated and get slaughtered in public matches by try hards it allowed them to unlock all the same stuff and have the full game experience of progressions unlocks and challenges that they would have never had a chance at when being continually dominated in public matches.   I don't know why CoD stopped doing that after MW2. CoD Ghosts allowed a partial example of this through the use of squad points. You could play in squads mode (which was an awesome concept BTW) and earn points to continue to rank up, earn new guns, perks and killstreaks and these would carry over in to your public match player as well. The only way you could earn weapon camos and custom sight reticules however was by playing public matches, but at least they allowed most of the unlocks to occur in a private game mode.  At the end of the day, how much does it matter if someone ""boosts"" to get a new paint job on their gun or something? So what. Now ask yourself the question, how much more does it matter if players are continually frustrated by your game because they aren't skilled enough to earn these things in competitive play and wind up hating the feature?   If you want to have things like clan division gear, patches, etc. that are earned by pure competitive skill, I guess that's fine. But just the normal things like attachments, levels, camos, etc. shouldn't leave someone feeling like they want to throw their controller against the wall because their K/D ratio sucks and they keep getting slaughtered and dominated.   I play with my dad, my friends and my brothers. My dad is 60 years old, it's family bonding and he has a lot of fun, but he's 60 years old, he's been playing Rainbow Six since it came out in 1998. My friends and I are in our 30's now. we aren't into playing with those over caffeinated 12 year olds who scream about how much they ""pwned you"" while they teabag you with that sprinting drop shot quick scope. Remember how many R6 vets there are here, we skew older. We're not interested in playing a scene like that. That's for Halo and CoD. We want to play with players of equal skill but we don't want to miss out on the full gameplay experience just because not all of us like to play in the competitive or ""fast"" lanes. Rainbow is supposed to be slower paced and many of us want to play it that way."

Rainbow6,3as9hd,bleepblopbloop,5,Tue Jun 23 19:46:07 2015 UTC,"SAS all have gas masks   Because no other CTU on is capable of using this advanced technology.  Checks out.   FBI have a special training in explosives (so I'd expect a special supply as well)    True, I forgot that the US hasn't signed the ""Non-Deadly Explosives Treaty"" yet, so it makes sense that they'd have the only explosives that could kill a man.  Checks out.   and so do GIGN with the revive ability.    I completely forgot the GIGN have special training in removing bullets and healing wounds instantaneously without hospitalization and can bring back CT's from the dead.  Checks out.   So far it checks out.   Sorry for my pessimism, but you've completely changed my mind.  Rainbow Six had always prided itself on complete tactical realism instead of arcade shoot em up bang bang with special abilities.  I guess Siege IS actually taking a step towards realism.    I mean, a CTU used to get shot in a mission and couldn't partake in the next mission sometimes depending on their injuries, or you sometimes couldn't use them at all because they'd be dead.  What kind of bullshit is that?  It's over 9000% more realistic that you can make someone come back to life on an op in the middle of a combat mission where terrorists are holding guns to a hostage's head or their finger is on the trigger to a bomb, and having French people being able to do that much more quickly is super accurate.  Checks out."
Rainbow6,3as9hd,spliffdecisions,-5,Tue Jun 23 20:51:12 2015 UTC,"Dude. Dude. Are you seriously trying to make sense here ? Ever heard of gameplay choices ?   I can't even talk about at you for this since you lost track of the fact that it's a game, an entertainment. Of course any CTU could get gas mask, but for the sake of gameplay, only SAS have them, and it's pretty iconic, if you check them on Google Images you almost instantly find pictures of soldiers with gas mask. Same goes with GIGN and the helmet with the bulletproof glass.  Also, revive only applies when an operator is in a DBNO state, means he sustained almost deadly injuries but still has a chance to be revived and stand up with half his health, so here I'd wager the better revive means he can stand back up with more hp or just gets revived faster.  But Dude. You really need to chill with searching for absolute realism, it's not a simulation it's a competitive shooter."
Rainbow6,3as9hd,jonowee,6,Tue Jun 23 21:06:10 2015 UTC,"Right, Rainbow Six was never a competitive shooter, it was a FPS tactical simulation.  You've hit the nail on the head without realizing it.    What set apart Rainbow Six from other FPS's when it first came out was how realistic it was.  People latched on to the first three games because they provided real tactical and immersive combat.  At the time of the first R6, there was Doom, Quake, and Duke Nukem, which were all fun games.  However, they weren't realistic.  R6 completely tore apart the gaming industry by attempting to be as real as possible, same with Rogue Spear and Raven Shield.  Then came the other games, and Ubi stopped being brave, and instead of innovating Rainbow Six, they instead started adding on features of other FPS's and slowly lost what made R6, R6.  As a result, sales went down and so did Metacritic and other reviews.  From what I've seen this game isn't Rainbow Six.  Yes, it's made by Ubi and has Rainbow Six slapped on the front, but it isn't what Red Storm Entertainment introduced into the world.  Instead of trying to innovate, Ubisoft has instead slapped on other arcade shooter aspects such as reviving taken from the BF series and added bullet trails.  The world doesn't need another competitive shooter like Counterstrike.  The world needs another Rainbow Six."

I can't even begin to imagine how hard it is as developers and community managers to deal with the things you all deal with on a regular basis when it comes to social media and backlash a lot of you receive at times. Especially in cases where those choices may not be up to you in regard to development. I am sure there are times you'd love to go through your screen and choke the person on the other end. I ALWAYS try to be very opened minded about games, especially those I am interested in. I understand that is somewhat contradictory to what I'm posing here, but I felt the need to speak up.

Rainbow6,3au3cy,tyhopkin,2,Tue Jun 23 20:59:57 2015 UTC,This game looks really great. But would it be possible to know why we can no longer move the hostage and why you added bullet trails and an indicator of the direction of a missed shot (white arrows)? This provides critical information (like hitmarkers).  Thank you.
Rainbow6,3au3cy,electr1cpanda,5,Tue Jun 23 17:50:26 2015 UTC,"I talked to one of the devs at the UPlay lounge about moving the hostage.  He didn't give me the whole story (it was loud and things were a bit hectic) but one of the reasons was because of the potential for players to essentially get the hostage ""stuck"" somewhere and couldn't be extracted.  With a map full of destruction I can see how this could be a problem.    Another reason he mentioned (I am summarizing) was the flow of the game.  You go from character selection > intel > planning > execution.  Given the limited time and if you are able to move the hostage steps 2 and 3 become a waste.  The game then becomes hide and seek.    If you think about it, in a real life hostage situation law enforcement would do everything they could to gather intel about the hostage, location, and terrorists, formulate a plan, then execute based on the intel.  Sure IRL the hostage can be moved and they have to adjust on the fly, but IRL there is no time limit."
Rainbow6,3au3cy,Pest_AWC,6,Tue Jun 23 18:23:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you sir. I just spoke with one of the game designers, Andrew Witts, to get some answers to your questions.   Moving the hostage - This is something we iterated on a lot. At first you could move the hostage anywhere and it came with a lot of problems. Defenders would put the hostage in an unbreakable corner and cover them in barbed wire and layers of deployable shields. So we changed it to where once attackers had freed the hostage, the defenders could move it (like you saw at E3). Turns out that this only happened about 0.1% of the time and the feature became kind of moot, so we cut it to focus on other things.   White indicators and bullet trails - They're visual aids meant to simulate the kind of information you'd have if you were there in person. That said, we've had some bugs recently with the size of the tracers and are working on tweaking their birth rate and opacity."
Rainbow6,3au3cy,electr1cpanda,7,Tue Jun 23 18:28:47 2015 UTC,"Ravenshield allowed anyone to very slowly move the hostage just by bumping into it.  While it didn't allow defenders to take a hostage far, it did make it so the hostage wasn't in a known exact spot all the time.  It had the drawback of the person trying to move the hostage was a sitting duck if an enemy saw him.  I know it's too late to implement now...but I assume it was talked about since you guys played the previous Rainbows...unless you just played Team Deathmatch.  As for bullet trails, they give way too much information when they can be seen from a 90 degree angle by team mates across the room.  There are many examples in the recent E3 videos where a player across the room saw a far off team mate being shot at, and knew exactly where to go to shoot the bad guy, even through smoke and walls, just based on the trajectory he saw.  Is there a way to minimize it to the point you really only see it coming right at you, kind of like a laser beam through dusty air?"

Rainbow6,3au3cy,iceycat,2,Thu Jun 25 16:46:47 2015 UTC,"Having only three possible hostage  spawning points on airplane map made it extremely easy to scout, and ruins the replayability of each map, which i know the devs were striving for with the destruction and gadgetry. There is no mystery about where the hostage is, which takes away some of the excitement and makes the game much less tense.   If the hostage could even be moved in general areas (make the movement box for the hostage 3 meters wide so they can't be put in any ridiculous corners, and no special gadgets could be placed that close to them, or snapped into preset ""dots"" around the map rather than 3 spots-even just moving the hostage to any location in the same room would be a vast improvement), it would increase the need for scouting, and make you think twice about blowing up that door or shooting through that wall blindly. It would make each map more fun to play over and over, and you could even trick the assaulters into breaching a heavily fortified room, while the hostage is hidden away in the attic all by himself because nobody ever checks that corner.   There are so many more possibilities available by just adding back this one simple feature. I was sad to see it dismissed."
Rainbow6,3au3cy,pojoman007,4,Wed Jun 24 03:00:26 2015 UTC,"I guess a couple of thoughts I have on this are:   Perfectly reasonable explanation as to why the hostage can't be moved. It does however make me want to lobby for a work around. for instance, allowing the defenders to place a marker on the map when choosing a spawn point and that's where the hostage spawns, when the map loads it would just ""snap"" the position to the closest valid spot so there's no glitching. This way the initial position could have much more variability to it? Are you saying that the defenders could move the hostage once the attackers freed it from the defenders in the Alpha? because I don't think anybody knew you could even do that which might account for why it was only done .1% of the time. Oh my gosh, PLEASE bring back the hostage lady from last year though. I REALLY hope the human shaped capture the flag guy that was in the Alpha was just a place holder. The lady had character, personality, it made you want to rescue her because you felt sorry for her and she seemed like a living, breathing person. The hostage guy from the Alpha was just....blehjk! Lastly, bullet trails, outlines, fire and grenade indicators, all that is a problem. If you feel strongly that players need that feedback then at least please give us a mode like realistic where we can turn that stuff off by default. or better yet make it the default mode and make an ""easy"" mode for those that feel they need them! lol (though I will say bullet trails as a result of plaster dust while firing through a wall as an effect would be cool - but I wouldn't cry if we got rid of them the rest of the time.)"
Rainbow6,3au3cy,Harvey_Dole,4,Tue Jun 23 21:28:19 2015 UTC,"The bullet trails really aren't necessary, these ""visual aids"" just add clutter to an already extremely hectic and cluttered game. The destruction engine should be enough of a visual aid.   Instead of adding more of these visual aids why don't you just improve other aspects like sound to give more information? All of the weapon sounds in the alpha were pretty underwhelming and the sound design as a whole could use a lot of work. If you improved those aspects you might not need the goofy bullet trails."
Rainbow6,3au3cy,kreios86,2,Wed Jun 24 06:07:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot. I perfectly understand for the hostage ;)  I'm fully agree with visual aids like those red arrow that indicated the feeling of the direction of your wound since it's hard to indicate it any other way.

Sorry, I had to, one day) the devs' first compromise to let the defenders move the hostage, is to force a double turn over of the objective?   Defender hold the hostage, attacker managed to claim the hostage Now defenders who already lost the hostage in the first place now have to force a second turn over to be able to move the hostage around.    So then with a 0.1% success rate of forcing a second turn, making one team screw up their ransom and the other team screw up their extract, you guys just decided to nuke defenders with zero option to ever move the hostage at any time?"

Rainbow6,3as112,gonapster,2,Tue Jun 23 02:04:32 2015 UTC,"Agree. Now that Bethesda has released the pip-boy with their collectors edition, adding 2 wheeled drone in this edition is not a bad idea."

Rainbow6,3apsbp,Phi03,2,Tue Jun 23 14:38:08 2015 UTC,Andrew's response at the Master Class didn't give me a lot of optimism that Siege will include it.
Rainbow6,3apsbp,tyhopkin,9,Mon Jun 22 23:19:52 2015 UTC,"To me, fire mode selector is a very important part of R6. In R6:Vegas, it was a very important tool. I played with friends a lot and I was the medium-long range guy and my weapon was almost exclusively on single fire. You get the best precision that way.   As for hit/kill markers, I think they already solved a huge problem by getting rid of the hit markers and just switching to kill markers. That being said, a realistic/hardcore mode without anything seems to be a very popular suggestion based on what I've read (also, doors. Why don't any buildings have doors?)"
Rainbow6,3apsbp,ThisIsntCheese_,3,Mon Jun 22 15:50:01 2015 UTC,"They couldn't figure out how to make doors work along with the barricades, so they cut them from the game...I would have cut the barricades, or spent more money and figured it out.  It's not like they needed money for a campaign mode.  A CQB game without working doors is like a race car sim with only automatic transmissions.  It kills the potential depth of the game, kills immersion, and is totally unrealistic."
Rainbow6,3apsbp,Pest_AWC,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:07:51 2015 UTC,I don't understand how they can possibly deliver a campaign without doors?

Rainbow6,3apsbp,SoDel302,5,Wed Jun 24 15:06:30 2015 UTC,this has been mentioned many times by us but they have failed to respond to us with a yes or no if it's happening. So far it has not been seen in alpha or any e3 demo. I am assuming it's a no based on their other game direction choices
Rainbow6,3apsbp,forzaitalia458,2,Mon Jun 22 15:25:11 2015 UTC,"Most likely, they always intended on including it but are holding out telling us and putting it in later so they can claim one last time that they did it due to ""listening to the fans"".  It's BS.  They've already contradicted themselves numerous times by saying on here ""Look, we listened to the fans and fixed hit markers, nerfed the HB sensor, and decreased bullet count"" and then in online interviews stated that they planned all of these things all along.  They aren't doing anything due to requests from the fans.  Period.  They are tweaking stuff based on observations from the Alpha regardless of what is said in here."
Rainbow6,3apsbp,Pest_AWC,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:13:29 2015 UTC,"They said in the Masterclass session that they are not yet finished with the development of the game and that they would keep us in the mystery about that topic for now. Also, they agree that auto fire is indeed hard to control and with the tweaked recoil burst firing is the way to go, meaning single-fire mode is a necessity. And as iceycat said, final game will most probably have the fire selector present in it."
Rainbow6,3ar6id,TheLucarian,3,Mon Jun 22 21:09:06 2015 UTC,"I guess I didn't realize it, but you are right in that you definitely knew when a Siege match was over.  The Division and For Honor were pretty quiet comparatively."
Rainbow6,3ar6id,tyhopkin,3,Mon Jun 22 23:17:04 2015 UTC,"Do you have any concerns about the game, and did you voice it to the devs? What were their responses?"
Rainbow6,3ar6id,brotrr,5,Mon Jun 22 21:20:15 2015 UTC,"I had concerns about a variety of things, all of which I spoke to the devs about.   1) Matchmaking, clans, and how we can provide feedback on teammates - with a multi-player game, I wanted to know how they planned to organize us all. I want a mature community to play in that focuses on game and plays with good sportsmanship.   Answer: They're working on revealing more soon! Not the answer I wanted, but I'll be patient. :)   2) Stagnating game play / Bad level balance - let's be real, we're all gonna try to find the optimal way to play on certain maps and after so many late nights grinding, we're going to say, ""Oh, this one again?"" I was worried that the inevitable player analysis would render things boring or that certain maps would just prove impossible to win on. With serious money on the table, I didn't want to feel tapped out within a month of play.   Answer: The way they've designed the 11 maps with randomization and the extremely sophisticated AI, I'm a lot less afraid now that I'll get stagnant gameplay. Plus, the devs are in it for the long haul. All of them are excited to see how we're going to rip it up on the maps and find new ways to challenge them to figure out new ways to puzzle us. I got the feeling that none of them wanted to abandon us.  3) Operator bias - I've played a lot of LoL. You have your OP champs, your flavors of the month, your ""constant rework cus no one understands"" champs. And everyone will find their operator. Someone will create a guide and everyone will suddenly want to play Ash/Smoke/Sledge. Someone is gonna throw a fit, and the match will be thrown because someone will call someone out for ""playing it wrong"" (hence my concern on 1).   Answer: Frankly, I don't think this is one that's fixable. The devs have created a variety of situations and operators, all with nuance (FBI = better explosives, etc). We're going to get more Operators as we start and as they deem. I can say they answered my concerns that they are committed to tweaks, will be monitoring, and don't forsee a major problem, but this is one of my outstanding concerns. Other players didn't seem concerned about this however so perhaps it's a non issue.   These three are my primaries, but I have more. Haha  TL:DR: I got questions. They had solid or soon to be announced answers. I'm confident they'll do well by us or at least, do the best they can in the time allowed.   Whew, bed time for Petra!"
Rainbow6,3ar6id,petracat09,3,Tue Jun 23 07:53:07 2015 UTC,"Other players didn't seem concerned about this however so perhaps it's a non issue.   The Operator system and the potential for balance issues between them has been voiced since the beginning, at least here.  Having such focused ""classes"", there is a real risk any number of Operators will simply not be used other than for novelty reasons.  If the Operators only restrictions were their special ability I don't think it would be much of an issue, but since weapons, armor, and attachments are all restricted within each Operator it becomes a very complicated balancing issue.  Nice to see you on here BTW!"
Rainbow6,3ar6id,tyhopkin,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:51:23 2015 UTC,"I'm being brave! Haha  Some folks at E3 didn't seem as concerned as me. Perhaps it was contextual however.   I do think it forces players to think about what they can use and how rather than just bum rushing the best gun, etc.   I want to like it because it creates team diversity, but I'm still worried.

There the game played very smooth and responsive, but it was a LAN connection which essentially means zero latency.  I noticed in the Alpha there were some latency/lag issues with hit detection and glitchyness with gadgets and that was with a sub-60 ping."
Rainbow6,3ar6id,Deosl,2,Mon Jun 22 23:14:06 2015 UTC,"Same here, when playing it on LAN it felt super smooth and responsive. I just hope it's good with a 30-100 ms ping playing online."
Rainbow6,3ar6id,forzaitalia458,2,Tue Jun 23 00:54:40 2015 UTC,"Yes i do. My main concern is the pricing model for the game (season pass, eeewww), but they couldn't talk about what it will include just yet and how they will monetize the game in the long run. Keep in mind though, I might have asked the wrong persons for this, I didn't ask everyone the same questions. I also asked about threat and grenade indicators, and the response is that they are still fine tuning this on feedback during beta and also long after release. Siege is a tough game though and you shouldn't feel totally clueless on why you died. Or at least that is how I understood it.  Overall I got enthusiastic and well reasoned responses, especially from Andrew Witts (game designer) - he knows his shit!"

You might just be a very open minded person, who knows, but I'd love to hear some of your complaints instead of a more or less 100% glowing review for a game that almost everyone has had a complaint about.  O and did I mention this that just surfaced. I want this game to be great, I really do. I was all into the hype with the E3 demo last year but the things the team has done give me less and less hope for it. You don't become successful by trying to be like everyone else.   The only reason games like Rainbow, Socom, and now Shenmue survived was because of their core followers. When you burn that core group like Socom devs have done, you inevitably kill any chance you have of that franchise continuing to be successful. If Ubi wants to be Evolve and just say hey we made our money so we're happy so be it, but if they want to make something really great they should focus more on the core of what made R6 successful.   As of now I feel confident saying this game will go the way of Evolve; it will have a strong early following but drop off extremely fast unless they do something to instill confidence in the community. They made some great steps with the changes they made after Alpha but not having AI is single player is a BIG step back. Multiplayer better be incredible!"

I was all into the hype with the E3 demo last year but the things the team has done give me less and less hope for it. You don't become successful by trying to be like everyone else.   I am not much of a singleplayer games player. I played all the Rainbow Six missions and I used the planning phase, but not to its full extent - I still wanted to play all the action parts myself. So I basically just used the planning to move my teams up to the room, then did the entry myself, then switched to the next team, and so on. Was it efficient? Yes. Was it fun? Not really. The missions I enjoyed the most were the stealth missions were you are on your own and can't be seen - no AI teammates involved. For me personally Rainbow Six was all about terrorist hunt (single and coop) and multiplayer pvp. I'm really sorry for everyone who hoped for a return of the planning phase and all that - but I would just play it once for completion. So for me personally I'm glad they focus their attention on terrohunt and pvp.   The only reason games like Rainbow, Socom, and now Shenmue survived was because of their core followers. When you burn that core group like Socom devs have done, you inevitably kill any chance you have of that franchise continuing to be successful. If Ubi wants to be Evolve and just say hey we made our money so we're happy so be it, but if they want to make something really great they should focus more on the core of what made R6 successful.   For me Siege is such a huge improvement over vegas 2 or what patriots would have been, that I see myself addressed as a core follower. I also accept that nowadays, with the budget that is involved (300+ people, 3 years development time) you can't just create a game only for fans of games that are 12 years and older (the games...). You have to create new Rainbow Six fans, too.   As of now I feel confident saying this game will go the way of Evolve; it will have a strong early following but drop off extremely fast unless they do something to instill confidence in the community. They made some great steps with the changes they made after Alpha but not having AI is single player is a BIG step back. Multiplayer better be incredible!   I have exactly the same concern as you - multiplayer better be incredible! I think Evolve's ultimate failure lies in it's assymetric gameplay, which is fun for some time, but doesn't incite the same will to improve as counterbalanced multiplayer can. That's why I focused my OP so much on the feelings I had - and others apparently had, too. Siege fuels this will to improve, to overcome the enemy team like I've never experienced it before. Let's hope this stays for months and years after release!"
Rainbow6,3ar6id,iceycat,4,Tue Jun 23 15:05:17 2015 UTC,"As I've said before, Siege sounds like it may be a great game.  It's just strayed too far to be a great Rainbow Six game.    No offense to the devs, I am sure they worked very hard and the product looks good.  It just would have been nice to include a real ""classic"" mode to make the game less casual and hit that sweet spot between casual and hardcore that the first 3 R6 games did, and no other game other than SWAT 4 has come close to since.  I don't want ""Ravenshield 2.0"".  I want the logical next game in the series after Ravenshield with improvements like side switching, rappelling, realistic destruction and realistic bullet penetration."
Rainbow6,3ar6id,DL-Z_ftw,2,Tue Jun 23 04:27:41 2015 UTC,"I personally think it is in a pretty sweet spot between hardcore and casual, but that spot is different for everyone I guess. And it is definetely the best Rainbow Six since Ravenshield... by far. So I'm happy, and you should be too - for all I know we could also be getting a Vegas 3 or Patriots - and I strongly assume: we both and many others here wouldn't even be talking about it here."
Rainbow6,3ar6id,DL-Z_ftw,1 point,Tue Jun 23 08:11:38 2015 UTC,"Ignoring for a minute the fact it has Rainbow Six in the title, do you think you would buy it on it's own merits?"
Rainbow6,3ar6id,Harvey_Dole,2,Tue Jun 23 21:28:47 2015 UTC,How was the varying armor classes?  Did heavies feel like bullet sponges or turtles? What did you think of the  new operators? Likes/dislikes about them?
Rainbow6,3ar6id,Harvey_Dole,1 point,Tue Jun 23 04:01:11 2015 UTC,"No, the armor didn't feel overpowered to me, time to kill is very low over all armor classes. But the shields are tough, if the shield bearer is crouched, he is very hard to hit.   The new operators, didn't have much time with them, the one with the placeable HMG is interesting, but you really have to find a good spot for it, since it rotates slowly (and makes a distinct noise too!). Then there is one with an explosive device (Fuze?) that drills through the wall and detonates on the other side, which is kinda boring in terrohunt, but might be very strong in pvp - he also has the ak12 and the pecheneg/pkm(?), which both seem very strong. There also was a medic style operator which I unfortunately didn't get the chance to try, but he seems to be very strong on paper, we'll have to wait and see on that one."

Rainbow6,3ar6id,DL-Z_ftw,2,Tue Jun 23 14:48:50 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! White arrows need to go, killcam needs to be at least skippable (because you want to go back asap and see what your team does!), bullet trails effect could be reduced visually to a more subtle effect.  I think the positional audio feedback is so good, they don't need the white arrows at all! They should be more confident on this and the players ability to assess the situation!"
Rainbow6,3ar6id,DL-Z_ftw,2,Tue Jun 23 15:12:47 2015 UTC,Do the devs (or someone) talked about these two features (arrow and bullet trails)? I'm afraid the casual players like this kind of visual informations. Is there seems to be an openness to change some features or it seem to be implement to stay?
Rainbow6,3ar6id,capedcrusader93,2,Tue Jun 23 17:19:52 2015 UTC,"I definetely got the impression that there is very much an openness to change stuff. They are playing around a lot with the systems, like the duration of the effects, ramp up time, etc. I'm pretty sure they are going to continue to fine tune this until they find the sweet spot. It might not be the one you or I would like it to be, but we'll see."
Rainbow6,3aunxg,MRMYSTICIGR,8,Tue Jun 23 17:27:00 2015 UTC,I'd rather see Rainbow Six die and remember the old times than have the lineage continue with garbage like the current game.

There has not been a single game that came close to taking the place of Socom.  I am just saying as long as the franchise lives there could be the chance for revival.  When they abandon it you are left with nothing but memories.  Maybe Siege doesn't do well, and they say hmmm lets start implementing some of the changes that the community was recommending through the patch system.  That was what happened with Confrontation, it took a while before it got better.  For me when I watched the first video of multiplayer gameplay over a year ago, the fact this had a Rainbow6 name on it had no bearing to my interest.  I liked the concept, and it was the first thing I have been excited for in years.  I am not saying I don't understand how people feel or a fan boy or troll or anything.  I know how people feel all too well because I went through all of this emotion for my favorite franchise.  What else do you play bleep?"

Tens of thousands of games are made by Indie developers for PC, almost none ever make it to console.  If there was one or two we might have a different future.  It makes me wonder had H-Hour made it to console with outstanding success would we be looking at a retrofitting of games, I guess we will never know."
Rainbow6,3aunxg,Incursus,3,Tue Jun 23 21:18:15 2015 UTC,Consoles are why the series is dead.
Rainbow6,3aunxg,trineroks,-3,Wed Jun 24 22:51:10 2015 UTC,"I disagree with that statement because there is an underlying resentment that is misguided.  I like analogies so here is one to digest.  Consoles are like leasing a car.  You don' t own the car, all the maintenance and work is taken care of by a plan with the dealership, and in the end (when the next gen comes out) your lease is kind of up.  Yeah you can extend it indefinitely, but as time goes by all of your friends will move on to newer models leaving you behind.  A PC is like a CarNut with either an antique or a supped up custom version of something new that you have to take care of your self or pay out the butt if you want a garage to.  You spend time rebuilding it, tinkering on it, and become part of a community that takes good care of their custom cars too.  Just to cover all bases using a website to spec out and build your pc instead of actually knowing everything about it, is like buying a muscle car on craigslist.  Hey guys look what I have, damn if I know what that knocking noise is or how to fix it, but isn't she a beaut.  Sorry I had to go there for a sec, it amused me. Anyway back to the real analogy of course the custom carnut feels pride and overzealous for their car, they know everything about it and how to make is awesome.  But having contempt for someone that leases a brand new car every couple of years is just silly, I can understand where the feelings come from don't get me wrong.  In the end consoles are not that different, they both get you where you want to go, and take less maintenance and cost to get there.  Also almost every game is made to be run on a PC first anyway, so ""dumbing it down"" for the limited buttons on controller or whatever the excuse is for why consoles ruin it, shouldn't affect the original conceptualization of the game."

The only thing that can get them to change would be for web site articles to stop pandering to UBI and have the balls to bring up the valid concerns we bring up in this REDDIT.

When you look at a lot of FPS on the market many have hardcore mode and our community has been pounding Ubisoft with that request..and I believe they will listen. it's the one thing that RB6 does well in the past games. In Black ops(easy now)it has Hardcore mode and that's all I've ever played. I don't think RB6 will let COD show it up...I believe RB6 Wants to remain the granddaddy of all tactical shooters. That's my story and I'm sticking too it!

With them leaving out so many key features like working doors, campaign, teammate AI, and proper planning phases it is obvious they don't have time to create and balance a ""Hardcore"" mode.  If we are lucky they will finally give in and create one on the Third and final patch of ""Siege 2"" like they did with the Vegas series...only that patch worked for just one round on PC and they NEVER fixed it.

Rainbow6,3ap8mz,BLToaster,2,Mon Jun 22 17:11:10 2015 UTC,"Hardcore is defined by what the community perceives as ""hardcore"". For example, Call of Duty hardcore may be ""hardcore"" for Call of Duty players, but it pales immensely in comparison to a game like Counter Strike. Remember what hardcore games used to be before more casual ""modern"" titles flooded the console FPS market.   Siege feels like a game that tried to implement a couple hardcore elements, then got so scared that they decided to make up for it by adding 3x revives, exaggerated smoke trails, x-ray silhouettes, 3D detection, instakill knife swipe, no gimping, where-am-I-being-targeted-from indicator, grenade warning indicator, etc.   Of course, lying about ""returning to the roots"" goes without saying. If Ubisoft would come straight with us and admit that they weren't actually planning on returning to form I wouldn't be as critical about this game."
Rainbow6,3ap8mz,torchedEARTH,0,Mon Jun 22 17:25:42 2015 UTC,"It's not a brilliant move - it's an obvious financially advantageous move which only shows they do not have the community's interests as their greatest concern. By making Siege a more casual experience it caters to that huge console community that PC FPS's continuously try to obtain.  IMO it is a futile effort. CoD, the biggest console community of them all is on PC but is practically non-existent in comparison to the leader CSGO. I believe for Ghosts PC sales only accounted for 3% of their total sales and Advanced Warfare has done even worse overall. So these companies see that there is still a barrier to be breached in order to bring these more casual players over to PC and they keep trying...which unfortunately only hurts the historic and supportive community.  Why not cater to both a lot of people ask? Because it divides up the community and in the long run that hurts it drastically. Being so ""feature-filled"" so that everyone can enjoy your game is not ideal. You need a niche and you need to own it. CoD does that for the casual/fast paced player, CSGO does it for those looking for a higher skill ceiling/competitive game. Siege is going for both and if they continue down this route (Which they will because it is too far along in development) then the game will not do well. It will have an initial burst as all big name new releases do and then fall to the way side shortly thereafter.  Had they gone for what their fans know and loved from games past they could have made a very successful product geared towards this current generation's technology. Instead we are getting another re-hashed shoot em up game trying to cater to all."
Rainbow6,3ap8mz,torchedEARTH,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:42:52 2015 UTC,"I do see a lot of your points and you make some very good ones..yes indeed, BUT, todays world is much different than what the ""glory days"" of Rainbow where once was. COD and the ADD kids have changed the landscape of getting to their core desires by hitting that animal instinct in all of us to shoot guns, kill quick and win. Also the companies are getting very profit driven because there are sooo many of them competing in the world that they have to get a share of the market to remain profitable. That's just a fact. Now if they can sway gamers from another market with something a bit different they will. It maybe watered down from our golden days of rainbow but I don't think we will see that again, we will just have to relive it in a hardcore mode. I still think the game will be great and I'm looking forward to it."

Moreover, if you're the kind of the guy who's more proficient with a specific weapon than with a specific Operator (because let's admit it : we'll all have mains and favorites) going for a recruit is best.  Lastly, Operators you know exactly what their loadout will look like, their choice is limited.

The TerroHunt map, Consulate, we saw in E3 took place in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. The PvP map in E3 was set in Hereford and goes by the name of Hereford Base.  More moreover, according to a hint given by JackFrags in his video, we can expects one of the maps to be set in a Cargo Ship and another one in a Mansion.  Nice post, though!"

Rainbow6,3alob1,Harvey_Dole,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:33:46 2015 UTC,I get that. I know the game will still be fun even if it's not perfect.

Rainbow6,3alob1,Van_Tek,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:01:02 2015 UTC,Siege may be a great game...it just isn't even a good R6 game.
Rainbow6,3alob1,forzaitalia458,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:16:58 2015 UTC,"So far I agree. Nothing that people are in a stink about has really been a huge enough issue for me that I think the game won't be fun because of it.  So there's no doors... Who gives a shit? I don't play multiplayer FPS games to run around opening and closing doors, I play them to shoot people and hopefully not get killed while doing it. I get where people are coming from, in that the idea of breaching doors and clearing rooms one at a time is pretty badass, but I also understand how difficult it would be for a server to remember the states of all the doors in a given level, whether they're open, closed, somewhat open, mostly closed, damaged, destroyed, fortified, locked, unlocked, etc etc.  So there's janky white outlines to show you where your team mates are... It's ugly and clunky, but whatever, little icons that are visible through walls are also unrealistic and ugly, so it's really just a choice between evils at this point.  The things that initially drew me to this game are still there, those being the little remote control cameras for scoping out the levels, the rappelling up/down the sides of buildings and leaping through windows, and the massive scale of environment destruction.  In fact, with the addition of TeroHunt, the game looks even MORE fun than it did when I first saw the initial gameplay trailer! (I personally hate PvP FPS games. I don't mind the additional challenge, I just can't stand dealing with trolls and hackers and people who think it's hilarious to keep spamming the voice chat the whole match with stupid crap.)  I also didn't play the other Rainbow 6 games, not since the first one, so it's probably easier for me to ignore the various things about this game that are pissing off all the die-hard fans of the series."
Rainbow6,3alob1,Van_Tek,2,Sun Jun 21 16:27:25 2015 UTC,"You wanted to play rainbow 6 because of the camera drone? I can't face palm hard enough.   And the solution to your outline or icons over the head, the clear solution here would be to have neither. Just make the team cammo different colours."
Rainbow6,3alob1,sonoblink,2,Sun Jun 21 19:38:31 2015 UTC,"I didn't want to play because of the drone, I just thought it was an awesome idea for a tactical shooter. I can't count the number of times during Insurgency matches where I wish I had a drone to send ahead and scout."
Rainbow6,3alob1,Harvey_Dole,0,Sun Jun 21 21:16:15 2015 UTC,Actually i think the RB6V overhead icon's look quite cool ;)
Rainbow6,3alob1,Van_Tek,2,Sun Jun 21 21:56:21 2015 UTC,"I personally hate PvP FPS games.    Well, according to Ubi, Siege is a game who totally focus on PVP. Even if they've add PVE, the game is build around the PVP."

Rainbow6,3amnvh,soundlord,3,Sun Jun 21 18:53:34 2015 UTC,"Alpha had a selection of about 10 different guns, but according to an interview at E3 2015 there's at least 30."
Rainbow6,3amnvh,guysullavin,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:54:18 2015 UTC,Thanks. But do you know how many there are per operator?
Rainbow6,3amnvh,guysullavin,2,Sun Jun 21 20:07:47 2015 UTC,I think it was roughly 2-3 primaries and 2 secondaries per operator.
Rainbow6,3amnvh,kreios86,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:17:32 2015 UTC,Ok thank you.
Rainbow6,3amnvh,Djaquitchane,3,Sun Jun 21 21:44:05 2015 UTC,You have 2 primaries and 2 secondaries an operator can choose. Not a selection nor customization at all. needs to change.
Rainbow6,3amnvh,kreios86,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:54:03 2015 UTC,"E3 gameplays have displayed Operator guns with different elements of customization (namely Ash's G36C, for example). So there will be more I believe."
Rainbow6,3amnvh,Djaquitchane,2,Mon Jun 22 04:14:12 2015 UTC,Yes sights and stuff. But you only have a choice of 2 primaries or two secondaries.
Rainbow6,3amnvh,kreios86,3,Mon Jun 22 04:17:55 2015 UTC,"Which I find good considering Operators have their own stats, models, gadgets, why not their own guns ? It only makes sense to me, especially since the guns they have available define their playstyles. Example : Castle has two very CQC oriented guns, combined with his gadget, he's pretty much entirely designed to stay in the objective room. Moreover, you've got Ash that has mid to long range weapons (gadget included) that still allow her to be somewhat efficient at CQC thanks to their high firerate. So you can play Ash pretty much everywhere, allrounder attacker."
Rainbow6,3amnvh,Djaquitchane,2,Mon Jun 22 04:24:07 2015 UTC,"Which would be fine in a Siege, alone game. Though Rb6 has always been about customizing your kit to fit YOUR playstyle. With the Operators and limited customization if someone grabs the Op that fits your play style than you are kinda of SOL And stuck grabbing something else. Yes it adds variation but again, Its all been about YOU as the operator not being pegion holed."
Rainbow6,3amnvh,kreios86,2,Mon Jun 22 04:41:17 2015 UTC,"I do find this to be a serious downside, but hey, shit happens. And if you don't get your operator you can still customize the recruit I believe (granted you can select what armor type you want, which I really hope they allow for)  Now in a competitive setting, you and your team would have agreed on picks so that wouldn't be a problem.  The thing that worries me most on this game is how Matchmaking will turn out to be. Will it take your most played operators into account in order to make sure you get your pick and not match you with people that also main this operator ? Time will tell :D"
Rainbow6,3amnvh,Djaquitchane,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:47:11 2015 UTC,"Nope each Recruit has a set Armor type as well as 3-4 I think if they bumped the number up, if not 2-3 Primary choices with 1-2 Secondary. For gadgets it was Placeable Shield, Barbwire, and I cant remember what else. I think frag and or flash/smoke was in there some where.  Depending on how they do the custom rooms will really be dependent on if this does anything competitive. It's one of the reason it took so long for COD to take off on the 'MLG Circuit' and others.  As for matchmaking it'll be as normal. There will be some sort of Algorithm set to give you a number or classification IE Skill level 1-10 and match you with people around that classification. There shouldn't be, keyword there shouldn't, unless they do like evolve any way to 'pick' your operator before hand. Would be nice but that would just seriously increase wait times. Time will tell how they decided to do it but going by trends it dont look that way. Match Making, another thing that should have NEVER been put in the game."
Rainbow6,3amnvh,kreios86,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:36:49 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah that's what I said, each Recruit has all the guns available for his CTU. Not ALL the guns."

Rainbow6,3amnvh,TheLucarian,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:56:41 2015 UTC,"Well, you know, you can choose any CTU in the recruit menu. So while you don't have access to all the combinations possible, you still virtually have access to all the guns from the Recruit Operator."

Rainbow6,3amnvh,TheLucarian,2,Mon Jun 22 07:59:21 2015 UTC,Customization of the operator. This 2 Primaries to choose from per operator is bogus.
Rainbow6,3amnvh,kreios86,1 point,Mon Jun 22 08:03:21 2015 UTC,Having fixed primaries for each operator is part of the fine balancing that's needed for competitive multiplayer.
Rainbow6,3amnvh,TheLucarian,2,Mon Jun 22 08:20:08 2015 UTC,"What!? No. Did you play/follow ANY of the competitive from before? Yes I know in Vegas 2 most people used the famas due to reset, accuracy times, and etc. Prior to that though a lot of the competitive edge was being able to adapt to the situation. Which meant changing up your kit, changing weapons, etc. This 'Fine Balancing' idea is a farce and you know it."
Rainbow6,3amnvh,kreios86,1 point,Mon Jun 22 16:57:05 2015 UTC,"What I mean is the balancing needed with the operator system in siege. Remember that every operator has a gadget that only they can use, therefore it is much more important to balance them out against each other. If you let every operator choose from all the weapons, it is much more likely to create unforseen imbalances. And that is a situation the developers must prevent, otherwise people will whine about the system all day long (not that this happens already, lol) - especially if someone picks the imba operator before them at the start of a round."
Rainbow6,3amnvh,TheLucarian,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:47:36 2015 UTC,People are going to whine about it period. The only way to 'Balance' the weapon side of it across the board would be to homogenize them and set them up as just different skins for the same weapon.  If not its going to be a rush for hte most accurate / recoil return rate gun which would turn it into the Famas from vegas again. There needs to be a give/take when choosing an operators weapon; which opening them up would allow. Adding stat based calculations to the recoil and accuracy rates isn't hard at all. Just did it a couple of weeks ago for a prototype for a class in about 3 hours. Worked great.
Rainbow6,3aljhb,DL-Z_ftw,10,Sun Jun 21 11:47:28 2015 UTC,There are revives!? Outlines!?!? What the hell have they done to the franchise???
Rainbow6,3aljhb,FrusTrick,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:12:09 2015 UTC,Outlines are a total BS that must be removed! Revives on the other hand must be tweaked in order to provide a more satisfying experience. Revives are there as the game has a 'one life' only policy.
Rainbow6,3aljhb,FrusTrick,7,Sun Jun 21 15:43:31 2015 UTC,"Revives are not viable. In a realistic setting, in case you get shot and are so badly damaged that you need medical attention in the first place then you are in no shape to fight on."
Rainbow6,3aljhb,FrusTrick,3,Sun Jun 21 17:54:40 2015 UTC,The 'realistic' mode (which I call the Classic Hard-Core mode) shouldn't have revives / a DBNO state. Lets force the devs to ship the game with one.
Rainbow6,3aljhb,FrusTrick,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:00:57 2015 UTC,"Having to decide to risk going into the open, where an enemy JUST killed your teammate, to rescue him versus not and staying is pretty fucking cool. The game is so lethal that people will start baiting the DBNO feature and kill anyone who tries to revive. Good players will double-tap.  Shooting someone in the knee and them crawling away, weaponless, I hardly see as being unrealistic."
Rainbow6,3aljhb,soundlord,5,Mon Jun 22 17:27:08 2015 UTC,in old RS6 titles (read: Rouge Spear) you were killed if you were shot. Want to talk about lethal? Try Rouge Spear.

Rainbow6,3aljhb,skyzefawlun,2,Sun Jun 21 15:39:13 2015 UTC,I think they're just mad because the new game isn't gonna be like the old R6 games.
Rainbow6,3aljhb,Mastaking,3,Sun Jun 21 16:39:32 2015 UTC,"True! The thing is that if I was a veteran of the series, I might have been mad the same way (just as the veterans are now) over the decisions made by the developers/ publishers. UBISOFT indeed lied when it told that R6:S is going back to the roots. UBISOFT should have been loyal to its old fans, none-the-less, but big AAA companies these days, sadly, give more weight-age to their income and appealing a large player-base!  The thing now to understand for everyone is that R6:S is a different game with a different theme overall with a little to nothing taken from the 'roots' of the series."
Rainbow6,3aljhb,skyzefawlun,8,Sun Jun 21 16:51:53 2015 UTC,You've never played a R6 game ever ? Did you even play the alpha if not you've some nerve saying anything xD
Rainbow6,3aljhb,Mastaking,5,Sun Jun 21 13:11:30 2015 UTC,"Neither did I play any of the previous R6 games nor did I get a chance to play the Alpha (seems like I do have the nerves to give my thoughts on the game in that case).  I will be playing the Beta, though, as I got invited to Alpha when there was only a day left till its ending.  My review is completely based on what I've seen so far in the videos.

Rainbow6,3aljhb,kreios86,3,Sun Jun 21 21:06:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah the ""People who haven't played this series since its conception have no right to an opinion"" circlejerk is pretty strong in this sub. I occasionally come into the sub to see if I can find something I couldn't find elsewhere within 10 minutes of searching. Every single time I see people acting in this manner, honestly, if I was the developer, I would immediately see them, think ""Wow. These so called Loyal Fans are just really a toxic community of circlejerkers that don't even deserve to get what they want anyway."" and move on to working on a game without feeling bound by trying to please two crowds at once. Because, frankly, if anyone that says they are ""loyal"" to this franchise truly approves of the way people in this sub are acting, they're kidding themselves. They're all toxic af."

Rainbow6,3al51x,TLSN_Troyseph,2,Sun Jun 21 16:27:29 2015 UTC,"It being a good game is honestly rather irrelevant. It's lost it's original community by going the Call of Duty/CS hybrid route and it won't interest either one of those communities. Counterstrike is a constantly growing monster, R6S won't gain any traction there. Black Ops 3 is coming out this year, and it's going to be the first good Call of Duty since 2012, so Siege isn't going to gain any support there either.   Siege has no audience to draw in."

Rainbow6,3al51x,kreios86,2,Mon Jun 22 07:37:14 2015 UTC,"I just don't see it happening. It is dropping classic Rainbow fans faster than the Vegas games did, and it doesn't have the quick pace and skillshot appeal of Counter-Strike. The last games were popular so I think it is going to have a decent sized community, but I don't see it being a serious competitive game."
Rainbow6,3al51x,Pest_AWC,2,Sun Jun 21 16:47:27 2015 UTC,"Nope.    It's too unrealistic and full of HUD CLUTTER.    It has a system where you ""unlock"" the Operatives, weapons, and gadgets instead of unlocks just being cosmetic like most requested.  The lack of working doors kills the chance for realistic strategies and kills the immersion.  Big missile trails behind every bullet is completely unrealistic and gives away info that you shouldn't know.  White outlines are unrealistic, immersion breaking, and give way to much info about your own team mates that you shouldn't magically know.  Sorry...I don't see it being adopted by clans.  Most clans don't want to invest time in a game that changes so drastically with every new release and upsets its core fans.  What will be next?  Respawns and Third Person?  Oh wait...they did that with Vegas."
Rainbow6,3al51x,brotrr,4,Sun Jun 21 07:54:42 2015 UTC,I wasn't aware realism was a requirement for a game to be competitive.
Rainbow6,3al51x,sonoblink,-1,Sun Jun 21 17:14:05 2015 UTC,Siege should be a fukin cool game that's for sure;)  Nothing wrong with respawns pest actually in team sharpshooter there always was that option anyways its nice to have a choice)
Rainbow6,3al51x,Djaquitchane,0,Sun Jun 21 09:24:57 2015 UTC,"BF is realistic as fuck, so are CoD and CS, everyone knows that. Right ? riiiiiiight ?   They all have houses full of doors, right ?   BF has lost most of its Esports crowd on PC with BFH, they're looking for a new game, which is understandable since BF4 has been out for nearly 3 years. Esports on CoD aren't pushed elsewhere than on Xbox, and people may want a game a tad more dynamic than CSGO. So I think chances are good, especially knowing it will release before Battlefront.  Now if working doors are what you really want, knowing that they will be shot through and destroyed sooner than anything else, I'm not sure what really appeals to you in a competitive FPS.  I do have to agree on the bullet trails, while cool looking they aren't necessary."
Rainbow6,3al51x,Quwertzuiop96,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:12:35 2015 UTC,"in my opinion RSS will be a really good competitive game. all these things about killcam and bullet trails may be giving much information to the enemy, but this means that it's getting more difficult and that's wat competitive games are all about. so you shot change your position after shooting or you will be spread to death. in my opinion this are all game mechanics with makes the game different to play and unique."
Rainbow6,3al51x,Harvey_Dole,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:17:16 2015 UTC,"If they continue to tweak the details... YES! For a good competitive game they must remove the white arrows and the bullet trails (these features give the exact position of the ennemies). Killcam give us also too much information but this is acceptable.   For a no respawn game, the game should not give us these informations.   This game seem really good in my opinion. Without white arrows, bullet trails, outline and killcam.. this game could be awesome"
Rainbow6,3aiur7,El_Cynic,15,Sat Jun 20 16:49:30 2015 UTC,I think the white arrows pointing directly at who's shooting at you is the bigger problem right now.
Rainbow6,3aiur7,brotrr,5,Sat Jun 20 17:35:36 2015 UTC,"It points at where you got shot from. But you're right, we should get either these or the bullet trails, not both, I really think the devs offer way too much free info to both teams."
Rainbow6,3aiur7,Djaquitchane,2,Sat Jun 20 19:29:44 2015 UTC,Bullet trails show you the position of the enemy even if they dont shoot at you. But yeah the white arrows should be remove too
Rainbow6,3aiur7,Harvey_Dole,4,Sat Jun 20 19:52:52 2015 UTC,I always thought the arrows were a way of indicating the feeling of the direction of your wound since it's hard to indicate it any other way

Rainbow6,3aiur7,Brunttus,2,Sat Jun 20 21:33:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it's a very clever mechanism for helping give you info you might  have in the real world, but I'd personally prefer audio cues supplant a lot of this HUD stuff."

Ask you to wear a suit that vibrates on spots that you get shot at? I swear some of the people in this sub are WAY too finicky.   Edit: Just realized that the arrows are different.

I saw lots of E3 footage where someone on the other side of the room saw a bullet train and moved into a position to kill the bad guy and killed him in a couple seconds...even if he couldn't see the bad guy through smoke or walls.  That is not realistic at all."
Rainbow6,3aiur7,Pest_AWC,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:39:30 2015 UTC,"Actually, if we're talking about realism, that most certainly is realistic.   Edit: To clarify, not the action taken (going straight into shooting him likely without cover), but being able to have a rough idea of where he was through the smoke based on the bullets. In a real life situation it would likely be hitting the wall behind you, where you could have an idea of the angle it was hitting the wall at just by looking at it, and have a rough idea of where to try to shoot through the smoke at."

Rainbow6,3aiur7,brotrr,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:35:04 2015 UTC,Bullet Trails are way too unrealistic and exploitable.  I see in the E3 videos where someone on the other side of a room sees bullet trails and knows exactly where an enemy was firing from and gets in position to take them out without even seeing them.  It's as bad a hack as the hit markers used to be.    They better allow it to be turned off server side if they choose to leave that cheat in the game.

Sorry...but none of those answers make me feel any better about the game.

Rainbow6,3ak0oo,missch4nandlerbong,2,Sun Jun 21 07:10:12 2015 UTC,"The Operators and their weapons/gadgets/attachments will be unlocks [...] I am really disappointed they chose to go with an unlock system that is not for cosmetics, but for everything   Which makes sense imo, especially if you start the game without a lot of knowledge, having access to all of the operators at the same time might be a little bit overwhelming. Also getting them introduced one by one will probably make you try them all and appreciate them even if they are not to your liking ""on paper"". And as far as the story line goes, you are tasked to recruit new operators to the unit. If you fear some operators might give an unfair advantage in pvp (which they shouldn't), you can unlock them in every game mode (single, coop, pvp).   Currently there are is only one bullet type and they won't comment on if more will be added in time for release (bullet type meaning FMJ or Hollow Point, I assume it is FMJ now)   I personally couldn't be arsed with bullet types and I think it's much more important to have the weapons all balanced. They could still introduce hollow point later on after release as a customization option.   They don't have Fire Select in now to allow single shot or 3 shot bursts, and they won't say yet if this will make it into the game.   No one is keeping you from firing in single shots or short bursts, it just takes a little more skill (and btw, it's absolutely necessary anyway, because the recoil is strong!). But I don't see a reason not to include fire select, too, except that it's a little bit more difficult to tap out single shots at automatic mode (but difficult is good, right?)."
Rainbow6,3ak0oo,ross84cr,3,Mon Jun 22 08:13:30 2015 UTC,"@TheLucarian... sorry but are you sure to know Rainbow Six or guns in general? The Fire Select is the base of any guns, in every tactical shooter is the first function to implement. Com'on no excuses!!!"
Rainbow6,3ak0oo,ross84cr,2,Mon Jun 22 09:59:24 2015 UTC,"I like to be able to quickly auto fire if someone surprises me in close quarters, if someone is far away I can still single shoot by tapping the mouse. The only game where I use single shot on automatics is in Arma, but that's because most engagments are 150m+.  I also want to play a game, not a simulator. For me it doesn't need to be there just because it's realistic. I also don't want guns to be jamming randomly, like others have suggested, just because it's realistic.

The fire selector is a feature that even the most arcade games have .

Rainbow6,3aipwv,n0ra,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:28:49 2015 UTC,What is magic pool system
Rainbow6,3aipwv,ChosunYin,4,Sat Jun 20 18:32:51 2015 UTC,"There are 4 types of ammo management system, and an example working with 90 total rounds,  and where applicable 3 total 30 round box magazines and firing 5 round bursts before reloading.   No reloads. Doom, Quake style. As long as you hold down the trigger, all 90 rounds will be fired. Ammo Pool. Too many shooters. You have a pool of total 90 bullet in 3 ""mags"" and 5 round bursts in this example, both gives you 18x [correction] 12x 30 round  magazines to insert (as the last 30 rounds give you no more spare mags for the game to refill from) but also only subtracts from your total pool what was fired instead of tracking individual magazines. Mag Pool. Most hardcore shooters. There are two interpretations of the mag pool system, the one I associate with is where you have 3 magazines that the game subtracts what you use from each magazine loaded. So with 5 round bursts then reloading, most of your magazines will lose rounds in this way 30-25-20-15-10-5 each time you reload as the game cycles your magazines to pick the fullest first. One of the magazines will lose 4 rounds after the first reload to get your gun to 30+1 loaded. Full mag reload. Battlefield Frostbite Hardcore, Rainbow Six: Siege alpha. This is the second interprétation of the mag pool system, so that firing 5 round burst then reloading, your player dumps the partially used magazine on the ground, and you get to reload 2 times in total with fresh 30 mags, before not allowing you to reload on the last mag."
Rainbow6,3aipwv,jonowee,5,Sat Jun 20 19:43:41 2015 UTC,"I'd like realistic reloading. If you reload a partial mag, you get a partial mag."

Combined with the fact that at no point do you know for sure how many rounds are left in your mag, it makes you really think about your ammo count."
Rainbow6,3aipwv,Van_Tek,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:38:19 2015 UTC,"I like the Mag Pool system in Insurgency, but it needs an adjustment with a vague status of reloaded magazines either with very simplified icons or text messages like the ACE mod for ArmA that say this magazines feels full, half empty, light.  My additional proposal for Siege if it included Gun Smith, is the ability to customised your magazines to translucent or windowed mags to give you live feedback of ammo status. Unfortunately the G36 and OP90 in the shown builds translucent mags are both uselessly opaque. The LMG shown still had rounds attached to the belt when they were reloading an empty gun, so embarrassed that the 2005 DirectX 8 Unreal Engine 2 game had accurately animated MG belts when Ubisoft Montreal can't/won't figure out how to do it in their own proprietary engine in 2015."
Rainbow6,3aipwv,jonowee,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:50:05 2015 UTC,"I agree with the Insurgency comment for sure, I always felt like at the very least there ought to be a keybind for pulling out the mag and looking to see if there's at least 1 bullet in there, but that combined with an audio clip where your dude says ""Hmm, feels a bit light..."" or something similar would be awesome!"
Rainbow6,3aipwv,Van_Tek,2,Mon Jun 22 19:54:06 2015 UTC,Where your bullets all come from a magical pool of bullets instead of reloading entire magazines.
Rainbow6,3aipwv,brotrr,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:50:15 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I understand this. Multiple times I ran out of bullets or had to reload (which was terrifying because there was someone coming through a window at me).
Rainbow6,3aipwv,petracat09,4,Sat Jun 20 19:17:23 2015 UTC,"Ammo pool - 31 bullets in your current mag, 180 bullets in your pool.  Spending say 10 bullets and then reloading will cause your mag count to go back up to 31 bullets and 170 bullets in your pool.  Magazine pool - classic tactical shooter ammo management (like the original Rainbow Six games). 1 magazine in your weapon (30 bullets), 6 in reserve (each with 30 bullets). Each magazine has its own ammo count and you cycle through them.  Spending 10 bullets and then reloading will cause you to store your 1st magazine (which has 19 bullets - remember that after firing 10 bullets your 11th bullet is chambered in the weapon) in your pouch and you'll cycle to your next magazine, which has 30 bullets. You can cycle back to your 19 bullet magazine. This system encourages you to be smarter about reloads and not reload after firing 5 bullets like you see in so many modern FPSes."
Rainbow6,3aipwv,trineroks,2,Sat Jun 20 19:23:15 2015 UTC,"With a magazine system, if you reload with bullets left in your magazine, you would lose all those bullets. With the magical ammo pool, those remaining bullets magically get recycled into your future reloads."
Rainbow6,3aipwv,brotrr,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:01:27 2015 UTC,"Since the ""ammo pool"" thing is just in coop I don't really mind it, it's pretty useful considering they lowered the ammo pool after the alpha and Coop is much more shooting than PvP, because you face more enemies.  I do think the ""ping"" tool isn't really welcome but I believe it could get useful in order to plan stuff with strangers without using voice comms. Not the best (a BF style commorose would be better) but it's okay.  As for the bullet trails, I'm not really for nor against it, it's not super good since it does create a lot of confusion but it's something you can use to your own advantage."

Rainbow6,3aj2tk,GenericPCUser,3,Sat Jun 20 19:44:28 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid of what the games state will be in when the game launches.  I think it will be full of bugs that will break the multiplayer. Watching some interviews from E3 2015, they said that were still looking into some things about adding it in or changing it, only being 4 months away from the release. Developers were asked if select fire will be in the game, the response was we are looking into it. what happens if this game fails, do we wait another 7 years until another one. I'm guessing this is going to be another game that is released were they fix it months after the game comes out. Sorry if I sound so negative toward Siege, I just want to see this game succeed and last for years. Coping games like Counter Strike, Battlefield, or even Call of Duty won't work. Trying to compete against other games that already do it better won't work. Being a mostly console player, I wouldn't have really any other option besides Call of Duty, Halo, Battlefield, or Battlefront."
Rainbow6,3aj2tk,ChernoAlpha_Mk1,3,Sat Jun 20 19:48:59 2015 UTC,"The reason I'm still hanging around here is to prod Ubisoft to make a more difficult game to stand out of the crowd of modern FPSs. My tone did change at E3 2015 from waiting patiently for news and changes, to interrogating why choices were made as they were. I still have my problems with the Red Storm Rainbow Six's, that why I want to push to improve on their gold standard.  My biggest gripe is that Ubisoft, unlike when Valve bought Counter Strike, Valve carried on iterative changes and great big engine overhauls, but always remembering what kept CS being CS, all the good, bad, ugly, and quirks. Instead of throwing the CS brand name around, they gave us L4D, Portal instead. Allowing the CS community to keep growing on its previous successes instead of trying to earn respect from a different crowd every time when Ubisoft rebrand a new project with the Rainbow Six name."

It's true, game studios can't afford to pay 300+ developers for three years to build a game that maybe 5000 oldschool fans want, you need to have financial success - and wouldn't you, as a developer, want your game to be successfull and played by many people? I personally (as an oldschool fan since 1998) like the mix they are going for and am very very much looking forward to the release. If I want a more realistic game, there is enough choice to be had, being it the old games or newer different titles (at least on PC)."
Rainbow6,3aj2tk,Pest_AWC,2,Sun Jun 21 19:02:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, there are a couple of other choices but the main ones for the same vein of game play either aren't out yet or the development has halted because of developer mistakes. As for wanting the game to be a success or not? It could be if they just made it a true RB6 game instead of one in title alone. Now if they dropped the rainbow title, which they wont, than Yes I wouldnt be complaining as much but if it spose to be rb6 than make it like the series. Yes evolve it some, dont devolve it like they are doing. Market trends are just that, a trend. They are not a defining line of what people would or wouldnt buy just an Idea. It kills me that people get all hyped up for a title (not just this) without actually looking into it. People buy the same vacuum over again than complain when they find out it was the same vacuum. As for 5000 oldschool fans, there are so much more. If they made it a true rb6 title you would see it on the MLG and other pro circuits so quickly it would be insane."

Run-and-gun shooters are still making money, but the appeal is dying out as more players want realism, strategy, thinking in shooter games. Rainbow Six has the perfect title to actually go back to its roots, not just pretend to. They are ruining a chance to revive the genre because they don't want to take a risk, but I believe it would be more successful if they really made a new Rainbow game. It is clear that fans want to kickstart indie projects like Squad and Takedown: Red Sabre, not new Call of Duty clones."

As the market sits right now Consoles are the prime factor and it is ruining the design aspect of gaming as it sits now. I do agree with you though that more people are wanting realism but as Designers we have to think about if we can get another job soon enough to make sure our families eat. We can choose to either tell the share holders 'Hey The idea isnt that great, we should really lean towards this' which goes against what they see market wise and end up fired because they want the market shares or make the game they want and screw over all the fans. Hard choices but until the buyers start actually being smart and stop buying the same vaccuuums over and over again that is how its going to work. Though i agree with you man."

When you're playing through single-player there are no supporting characters,"" Mitchell said. ""But you can play as a lone wolf, as well as play the game's whole story campaign. That said, it is more difficult.   And from the Ubi site...   These pre-set scenarios expose the player to the content and mechanics of the Siege and are specifically designed to be played solo as a Lone Wolf, but can also be played cooperatively with up to four friends.   So it's basically play with real people or on your own. As if leaving doors out wasn't bad enough."
Rainbow6,3ag85p,brotrr,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:05:18 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I feel like this game is clearly marketed as a multiplayer experience. This is like complaining that CS doesn't have a single-player campaign."

Rainbow6,3ag85p,trineroks,0,Fri Jun 19 22:38:48 2015 UTC,"Yet I still think it is a step in the right direction after the atrocious Lockdown and Vegas games. It isn't going to be as faithful as I'd like it to be to the realism of RS 1-3, but it is going to be better than the previous messes."
Rainbow6,3ag85p,holben,6,Sat Jun 20 18:13:14 2015 UTC,"I want to tally up the pros and cons from each game and see if Siege is indeed a ""step in the right direction"" from the Vegas series, as you claim. I will be comparing Siege to the first Vegas game:  The ""steps forward"":    Non regenerating health (+) Leaning (+) Removal of 3rd person cover (+) More plausible settings (less Hollywood-esque) (+)   The ""steps backward"":   White indicator pointing at enemies shooting at you (-) Removal of walk stance (-) Naturally wide crosshair (CoD style) discourages point shooting (-) CoD instakill knife swipe (-) Sprint CoD style (keep in mind, I'm comparing Siege to the first Vegas game) (-) No AI squad control in single player or terrorist hunt (-) Restricted loadouts to limited classes (-) White X-ray silhouettes (-) Removal of fire selectors on weapons (-) No doors (-)   The ""steps neutral"":   No attempt at realistic armor/bullet dynamics No fluid door opening (not in Siege because there are no doors!) No mission planning phase Vegas custom playermodels vs mishmash of Siege classes that look totally different from one another and have ridiculous ""badass"" names No gimping Ammo pool over magazine management   I'd say Siege is almost a step BACK from even Vegas, not a step forward. The only reason why I think people believe Siege is better than Vegas is because of how it looks - the more realistic settings (house, airplane, etc), realistic lighting, and its overall departure from the rather overblown Hollywood plot of Vegas has fooled players into thinking Siege is a step forward for Rainbow Six. When you look under the hood though you'll find that even Vegas shared more in common with the classics than Siege."

Or how many people are left. Oh and please get rid of the COD style revive mechanic!
Rainbow6,3af5p1,ScotOfTheDay,3,Fri Jun 19 21:31:17 2015 UTC,"While I'll agree there should be an option both individually and server side to disable some or all HUD elements, I will say that I like a couple things that make up for the situational awareness you would have in real life that a video game can only give you with a HUD element.  I don't mind things like stance indicator, health indicator (though I should be gimped if hurt!), and would even like a mini-map to show friendlies instead of those damn white outlines.  In real life you would have a better idea where your team is through more peripheral vision, real sounds, planning, and just knowing your team."
Rainbow6,3af5p1,Pest_AWC,-5,Sat Jun 20 15:22:03 2015 UTC,"This is a competitive game, not a realistic game, HUD elements are pretty useful in a Competitive setting, if you want realism over challenge I'd advise Arma or Ground Branch, Insurgency and such."

Where are my teammates?  HUD elements (like bullet trails, white arrow, teamate outline) can give you all these informations. Competitive don't mean realist but it don't mean brainless.

Rainbow6,3af5p1,jonowee,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:20:09 2015 UTC,"I don't mind the gun shaking around, as long as it accurately represents recoil effects and the weapon did not have additional spread applied on top of your ironsight or optic's zeroed point of aim.  The problem with BF4 launch and BF3 was visual recoil, where the animation of the gun bobbing was out of syncing of both where the gun was aimed and where the bullets spawned (the center of your screen-camera). Farther more, bullpups were usually lower rate of fire and had higher horizontal recoil that was animated into the visual recoil system because the optics are placed farther back on the gun and closer to the camera that because the gun bob pivots unrealistically on the tip of the barrel, the bullpups suffered more visual recoil. BF3 got away with it because their optics and irons were sharp, high contrast, unrealistic painted on optics reflex and holographic reticules, and the netcode was over forgiving for the shooter."
Rainbow6,3af5p1,Pest_AWC,5,Sat Jun 20 03:58:10 2015 UTC,"I believe the Devs already mentioned that we can turn off HUD elements on our system, and they are still deciding how much stuff, if any, can be forced off server-side for everyone."

The old Rainbow Six games health were pretty much three states; fighting fit, injured, dead.  Having ammo and health as automatically updating numbers, I don't if you do the same but I know I count the number of bullets it takes to kill someone, on the flip side I also count the number of bullets I can sponge up for my health number and assess the risk whether I can win the gun fight. Ammo counter alone, I pretty much figure out how deep and silly I can get away with taking on gun fights I would never risk in a proper hardcore game. Gamey, immersion breaking for a reality grounded series like Rainbow Six."
Rainbow6,3agn85,Verdant_Green,2,Sat Jun 20 00:18:00 2015 UTC,"Since the rest of us won't get to try it for a while, would you care to share your thoughts on the shield-using operatives? How effective is it? What are the advantages and disadvantages?"
Rainbow6,3agn85,Djaquitchane,3,Sat Jun 20 00:20:03 2015 UTC,"During the Closed Alpha, the shield was only available to the Attacking Recruit. So far I'm positive 3 Attacking operators will have access to the shield as a primary weapon, until we know more about the last GSG-9 guy, since all other 19 operators are known/have been seen. Out of those three attackers, 2 of them have their gadget merged with the shield (Montagne with the full head to toe shield, and the GSG-9 Operator I like to call ""Blitz"" that will be able to blind people in front of him by flashing lights on his shield, he can do it twice from what I gathered), the third one, Fuze, can be seen here without a shield so I believe his shield is an option, and the 4th Spetsnaz guy, a defender, can also be seen with a shield on this same image, so who knows ?  I got to use it, basically it worked around two stances, hipfire and aim down the sights. When in hipfire, your operator had the shield tilted to the left right horizontally, exposing part of your upper body, your head and part of your legs.   Aiming down the sights made you put the shield upright and hold your gun in front of the glass so that you could see the iron sights of your handgun through the glass. Your body was fully hidden from head to right under the knees, unless you were crouching, in which condition the shield would completely cover you, except for your right arm that is in front of the shield. Walking made the shield rise a little.   There isn't much to be said about it except that at moments you felt useless, and at other moments you were a key part of the fight. I would often place myself right in front of the door we were breaching for my allies to hide behind me and enter first, run in and put my back against a wall/corner, run up to enemies and make them try to circle around me or just stay outside the objective room and make myself a door for my teammates to rereat behind. Needless to say most of these attempts failed as communication was problematic during the Alpha.   I don't remember trying to melee attack with the shield as having a handgun made it pretty useless.   An interesting point was running out of ammo, to reload you had to use your second hand, putting you back into the hipfire stance, so shooting blindly turned out being a shitty idea most of the time.  I don't really remember much about movement with the shield, just that it made you way slower than your teammates, which makes sense, and even slower when aiming down the sights, and again, slower when crouching and aiming.  As far as protection goes, I'd say it was only effective in really secluded environments (corridors, doorways) and when you had the defenders pinned down on one place that they couldn't leave without exposing themselves. Entering rooms was dangerous because of the sides being free to shoot. I'd say entering rooms with the shield as a frontline would only be interesting if you know exactly where the defenders are.  If you have any more questions I'd love to answer them (haven't been to E3 though)."

Rainbow6,3agn85,geofurb,1 point,Sat Jun 20 16:32:11 2015 UTC,"The shield facilitated great gameplay in alpha, but it had balance issues. At the time of the alpha, I remember feeling very strongly that it didn't make the wearer vulnerable enough when they were moving with it or shooting from behind it, though I was very fond of the idea that it could cover their entire person when stationary and crouched. It was especially difficult to defeat as a defender, since you didn't have grenades. (Unless you saved your nitro cell to toss at them, I guess.)"
Rainbow6,3ade5v,tyhopkin,9,Fri Jun 19 05:11:07 2015 UTC,"From what I've seen in the official Ubisoft gameplay videos, everyone is playing super slow and tactical. However, it doesn't seem like you have to at all....everyone has super high ammo capacity, you don't die permanently unless you get shot while you're down, and movement seems fairly quick and smooth. Do you think it's just as effective to run and gun?"
Rainbow6,3ade5v,brotrr,3,Fri Jun 19 05:18:08 2015 UTC,"How was the Ubisoft Star Players lounge run? Was there a roundtable or sofa meeting with the Rainbow Six group?

Did you guys get provided internet access at the conference or at your accommodation; because you, AGR-S, Deosl, TheLucarian, and JonathanRL have been very quiet the past few days. Is there an extended edition of JonathanRL dancing?  Was there a playable demo of Ghost Recon: Wildlands? If yes, it feel more like fireteam-based Assassins Creed with guns, or open world GRAW?"

Even in the early R6 games with respect to PvP, usually the most effective teams were the ones who moved and attacked quickly, call it run and gun if you want.  If anything Siege requires a bit slower pace than any R6.  Though that has more to do with the gamemode as the attackers are approaching a defended area and not just a wide open map.   Oops, this was supposed to be a reply to brotrr's first comment."

Rainbow6,3abcbf,jonowee,2,Fri Jun 19 09:16:33 2015 UTC,"While I would be excited to have the answers to all the tough questions we have to understand they can't answer everything when we want them to. They may not be ready to talk about certain aspects of the game yet, they may be planning reveals at certain times,  etc. Also showing all their cards now would be a bad idea for a number of reasons.  They need to keep a steady flow of information between now and release to keep the excitement fresh, that's just good marketing 101. Also if they talk about everything now but much of what we don't yet know is subject to change, then they'd have to back peddle if they did change it. As consumers we may want to know everything about everything all at once but it's actually bad marketing and bad business to do it that way. Also I think we should remember they've been a heck of a lot more open than many other AAA title developers and I give them credit for that."

I personally felt the communication between the public and the devs has been severely hampered when you the community developers have to fish for answers from the dev team unlike the direct connection that is happening at Battlefield's CTE.  Will there be a (regular) AMA scheduled for the dev team? Community Corner came close, but it still being filtered both ways through the com devs, and that happened randomly when Ubisoft was ready to release something."

I was just wondering if that was typical for the amount of questions that were answered,  it only seemed like a handful. But for all I know maybe that's how Twitter Q&As always go with a 30 minute window. I'm not a heavy Twitter user, so I have no frame of reference. And as I said I'm sure there's a screening procedure as well because you guys aren't able to reveal everything that people want to know and I get that. No worries!

They either did not want to answer better, more detailed and researched questions; or they thought they were a bigger deal.   At minimal they did not plan this session out well, along with a lot of PR for Siege. As happened when I only found out about the March 2015 livestream 3 hours before the event from Deosl, not the community developers or the Rainbow Six website.  I only found out about this Twitter-only Q&A 10 minutes after it started, and wasted 5 minutes finding out the time zone difference and taking note that it was restricted to Twitter users only trying to figure out questions in 140 characters."

Rainbow6,3aa4kj,Pest_AWC,4,Fri Jun 19 04:43:54 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer that they worked on the audio occlusion quality until you could accurately hear where the bullets were coming from. The trails look really cool, but it'd be better if they just had that kind of effect on a bullet for a short distance after penetrating a wall; so you get kind of a trail of dust for a few feet."
Rainbow6,3aa4kj,geofurb,0,Thu Jun 18 15:58:11 2015 UTC,"When I played with all of us at E3, I definitely found the audio helped me locate where someone was shooting or even moving.

Rainbow6,3aa4kj,petracat09,0,Sat Jun 20 06:47:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks!! That's a huge relief. I realize the sounds from alpha were placeholders, but I hadn't considered that something like occlusion/positioning would be more useful than in alpha. Audio occlusion is a big pet peeve of mine with a lot of shooters.  Yeah, I think you're right. From the announced changes in response to community feedback from alpha, I think they're going to give this some attention. Personally, I'm hoping for some ""bullet whizzing"" sound effects to take their place, so that you can still figure out (roughly) the trajectory of shots, not just their source."

The breaking of walls, etc did give location info too like when we'd get shot through walls, windows, etc. Even better was being under or above a breach and hearing the sound difference because of the layers of structure between us. Also, hearing footsteps was nifty!"
Rainbow6,3aa4kj,petracat09,0,Sat Jun 20 07:17:43 2015 UTC,"If someone missed to the left or right of you though, there weren't any sound effects in for that yet? (You don't hear bullets whizzing by your head?)  I know it's sort of hard to judge and remember, but: Imagine you and a friend are standing on opposite sides of the wall. He fires his gun into the ceiling. From what you heard, is there a difference in the volume/character of that sound when the wall is healthy, has a hole in it, is full of holes, or has been breached? (Totally okay to say you can't remember/couldn't tell; I know there was so much to take in!!)"
Rainbow6,3aa4kj,geofurb,2,Sat Jun 20 08:00:34 2015 UTC,"In CQB, you will not hear bullets whizzing by before being drowned out by the sound of gun fire especially in enclosed spaces. In field combat, you can because the longer engagement distances allow more time for supersonic bullets to fly pass before the source gun shots are heard."

Rainbow6,3aa4kj,Krasnytova,3,Thu Jun 18 17:15:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, another silly and unneeded feature. Don't know if an enemy is looking at you, let us help you with white arrow threat markers as well.  We already have debris popping thorough shot walls, gun fire sounds, but why do you need vapour trails that are ridiculously persistent for half a second each and every bullet that give off amazing accurate information on the angle and direction of the shooter.  If you really want trails, give us tracers, make it an optional attachment for the user to see fit their uses and style. Typical load is 1 in 4 and last 3 in the mag are tracers, which more than enough for the default full auto in this game. Because they travel as fast as normal bullets, an inattentive player would have trouble identifying the source of shooting perpendicular to their vision just visually, they'll need to use their ears as well."

You didn't have to take into account bullet drop, wind, or guns jamming and you had minimal crutches like mini-maps to make up for a lack of situation awareness that a PC or Console just can't make up for any other way.  We didn't have any of the Hit Marker, magical ammo pools, quick throw grenades, restrictive Operator classes, lack of working doors, and white outlines garbage that we do now.

Rainbow6,3ac7hm,CookieDoughCooter,4,Fri Jun 19 00:04:40 2015 UTC,I don't know if you were at E3 or had a chance to play R6S but it definitely feels like an R6 game and not CoD. The game is intense and requires coordination and tactful play.
Rainbow6,3ac7hm,shreaderman,3,Fri Jun 19 02:37:23 2015 UTC,"I kept up with the beta and watched a few videos at E3 and it looked like the same problems persisted. Hit boxes, see through walls, guns sound like BB guns, last man standing, and fast twitch gameplay - just to name a few. Did they fix all of that?"
Rainbow6,3ac7hm,CookieDoughCooter,2,Fri Jun 19 02:53:27 2015 UTC,"I may be wrong but guns do sound like BB guns after you got ear damage from standing by gunshots in a secluded environment, which all these operators have. (That was my bullshit argument of the day, thanks for reading).  But yeah the game does open a lot of tactical possibilities, now you don't have to play with a strategy in mind, but success will largely follow the team that planned its rounds. The best example for this is from Alpha stats themselves.   Attacking often felt way too disorganized when Defending was basically just sticking by the hostage with your pals and waiting for shit to hit the fan, operators' gadgets also further pushed people into sitting on the objective (great design point btw).  Results pretty much speak for themselves, Attackers who were often just headless chicken not knowing what to do lost 61% of rounds, 61 is a huge number.  I also don't even envision the game without the sudden switches in gameplay pace, within a second you turn from carefully waiting for something to happen, following your plan, to having to find an immediate and viable response to whatever situation is happening, back to having to cool down and prepare for the next confrontation and make do with what you're left with.  Nothing CODish here, and I played CoD a hell of a lot.  Also, in a siege configuration I believe that seeing through walls is ensential, if Defenders have full monopoly over what can or cannot be seen, Attackers will have to act blindly and that sucks. Same goes for Attackers having to make sure they don't show themselves too much to the Defenders while setting up their Attack plan.  Many options and many solutions too, the Alpha was just hectic because the communication system was worse than bad, no one knew the maps/operators/guns/gameplay nearly enough to work together,  the game had serious problems concerning sudden crashes and random bugs, resulting in games having no continuity and hotjoiners being lost in games they had no context on and having to understand what the situation was. There were many many things that made this Alpha a not so good experience."
Rainbow6,3ac7hm,Djaquitchane,3,Fri Jun 19 03:17:58 2015 UTC,"I see your points, and perhaps it's more tactical than a CoD game of Headquarters, but I really don't think it's enough to say ""planning wins games, so it's tactical."" You can say that about virtually any shooter, from CS to CoD to Unreal Tournament; yet, only one of those three games is a ""tactical shooter.""  It sounds like all of the things I disliked are still in the game. I have to be candid and say the thing that disappoints me the most are the airsoft gun sounds. I understand the dumbing down of the gameplay, making it a twitch shooter, etc. but at least attempt to make it feel authentic! Bad Company 2 is the gold standard.   It sounds an awful lot like S&D in CoD. I know you said it doesn't feel like CoD, but I think it's fair to say S&D doesn't feel like traditional CoD, either."
Rainbow6,3ac7hm,CookieDoughCooter,2,Fri Jun 19 03:47:19 2015 UTC,"I didn't stop at ""planning wins games"", I explained all the pressure that pushes you to think more about what you do.   If anything, S&D is traditional CoD, instant confrontation, everyone knows where to find people and such. What I didn't emphasize is that there barely is any sense of synergy in CoD, everyone picks the gun they're most comfortable with and perhaps we get a couple snipers and that's it, that's all it takes, you've just got to make sure you can cover both short and long range action and you're set (at least that's how I remember my CoD days).  What I found really interesting in Rainbow 6, and that seemed to be really disappointing to most of the people in here is the Operator thingy. Each dude has his specs, his gadgets, his guns, and you have to puzzle this around to make things work out well. Teamwork is more than essential, you have to work with your teammates, you can go as a lone wolf but that's unreliable because your character, when by himself, is too flawed. And that's what spiked my interest, I love that, having to rely on your pals because the game doesn't allow for you to be all on yourself : it's not interesting going solo with Sledge because once you break the wall you have to switch back to your primary and by the time you've done that you kinda lost the element of surprise.

The R6 name has an identity crisis because unlike all of the competition, after the 3rd game in the series they keep changing the formula completely with R6.  I guess Rainbow 6 just means some random shooter in a CQB environment."
Rainbow6,3ac7hm,Pest_AWC,0,Fri Jun 19 04:52:33 2015 UTC,Your replies never cease to amaze me.  Some serious neck bearding going on over there.
Rainbow6,3ac7hm,thehypotheticalnerd,2,Fri Jun 19 14:45:19 2015 UTC,"Definitely not a neckbeardy thing. I am someone who constantly gets shit on because I think women should be represented more in games, because I think Anita Sarkeesian has some valid points regardless of how you feel about her stance or whatever, and because of similar shit. Go through my history. You will see me voicing my opinions on those matters and typically getting downvoted to oblivion. Hell, I won't be surprised if it happens to this comment.  But I am also upset when modern sequels to games I enjoy completely forget, abandon, or water down the mechanics of previous entries in favor of appealing to wider audience. I get wanting to get as many players as possible but to completely ignore the legacy is bullshit. Like, no doors, no squad commands, less tactical gunplay. What the fuck in this game seems like R6? I haven't even played the original R6 games and even I know this is stupid to call it R6. Same thing happened with the other Tom Clancy games. I'm more interested in getting the fan favorite R6s than Siege.  Yes, neckbeards often are overly critical and nitpick bullshit but asking for a sequel in a game series they love to retain the feel of the original games isn't really being all that overly critical and nitpicky. There are plenty they could have done to appeal to more people without necessarily abandoning everything. Maybe having revives for players who are ""killed"" but limiting how many revives you have. But that wouldn't have been nearly as big an issue if they had a planning scenario before entering a mission. a balance. This game has no planning stage, no doors (seriously?? No doors -- think about how stupid and illogical and unrealistic that is), no squad, no commands, nothing. Remind me how this is remotely like R6 aside from both having guns."
Rainbow6,3ac7hm,kreios86,0,Sat Jun 20 05:35:47 2015 UTC,"It's simple.  This is what we call re branding.  Once people on this sub realize that they will stop complaining. Or at least they should.  Is the new Jurassic park anything like the old ones? No.. yet it's breaking records. It doesn't even come close to following the old ideas.  I'm sorry the game isn't what ""you"" want but you don't get to decide that until you're a creative director or game director. Bitching does nothing. If you don't like the direction, don't buy it. Everyone needs to be a critic these days but barley anyone understands the decision making process."
Rainbow6,3ac7hm,kreios86,2,Sat Jun 20 12:08:13 2015 UTC,"Sorry mate, this isnt rebranding. GR -> GRAW -> GRFS -> GR:Wildlands. Rb6 -> Lock Down -> Vegas. THAT is re-branding. Saying you are 'Going back to the roots' and providing that with some new stuff thrown in isnt rebranding. It's Evolution. Sadly what we have with siege isnt Evolution; its business. The easy to to play and hand holding gaming is what people buy into now days. It isnt even because it's good its a social thing as well."
Rainbow6,3ac7hm,Pest_AWC,0,Sat Jun 20 23:41:10 2015 UTC,"You're literally taking one sentence and applying it to an entire experience. ""Going back to its roots"" can mean many different things, one being ""a thinking mans game"", which this is.   I had the opportunity to play it at E3 this year. The potential is immense. Your breakdown of GR and Rainbow means nothing. You're taking something that was last shipped about 5-6 years ago, something that was 3rd person with a cover system, and saying that a new iteration which is first person, with procedural destruction is not re-branding? That makes absolutely no sense..."
Rainbow6,3ac7hm,Pest_AWC,2,Sun Jun 21 00:06:40 2015 UTC,"I never said Vegas -> Siege. GR Was an example. Potential =/= longevity within the AAA market. Yes the devs want to support it for a long time but if the money doesn't come in there is no way to, business wise, push more money behind it unless they get someone that is willing to take that risk. So again, if the money doesnt come in there goes support.  As for a thinking mans game, compared to what Vegas? Cause Raven shield and prior takes more thought. As for third person it was only really during the cover system, so 'Going back to the Roots' pretty much means 'Hey were going back to what the series used to be.' Doesnt mean a complete remake obviously, but Siege isn't anywhere near the roots thus far. Patriots was more towards the roots with what little we saw from the little amount of Vert Slices that were shown. With how you responded, this could just be from lack of inflection and such due to text, it doesn't seem like you played Raven Shield or prior, and please correct me if I am wrong. Raven Shield and older -> Siege, not rebranding. Vegas -> Possibly, but the changes are minute."
Rainbow6,3ac7hm,iceycat,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:07:30 2015 UTC,"It's also called just slapping the R6 name on whatever FPS idea comes to some executives head.  If this was re-branding, well, shit, they re-branded with Lockdown and Vegas too.  After 3 successful games and a series of books that this series was originally based on, to ""re-brand"" without changing the ""Rainbow 6"" name is just stupid.  You've built a reputation and a fan base and didn't need to ""re-brand""."

Rainbow6,3aagrc,Djaquitchane,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:16:28 2015 UTC,"You've gotta understand, just because the mode is ""hostage rescue"" doesn't mean that getting the hostage out of the house has to be the most important goal. What they're trying to create here is solid attack vs defense gameplay, and the hostage facilitates that. The hostage pins the defenders to one room, so that they have to focus their efforts there. It still lets them use the rest of the house, but that room has to be their focus. The hostage also prevents the attackers from just fragging the hell out of that room until the defenders are all dead, because you've gotta worry about hurting that it.  .  TL;DR: The hostage shapes the attack vs defense gameplay. He's like a plot device that forces teams to work within some constraints."
Rainbow6,3aagrc,geofurb,3,Thu Jun 18 16:19:38 2015 UTC,"Good answer!  But I still think that even after killing all the defenders, the attackers must be forced to escort the hostage to a safe location, within the time-limit, for some extra/ bonus points that count towards the total score.  What you say about that? :)"
Rainbow6,3aagrc,III2RUFFIII,3,Thu Jun 18 16:43:37 2015 UTC,I think that is a great Idea...it gives closure to the round as well as create more tension to battle the clock to actually win. Great idea DL-Z_ftw Devs please pick up on this..it's not to late!
Rainbow6,3aagrc,forzaitalia458,3,Thu Jun 18 17:43:23 2015 UTC,"That would work. Really its hard to address players camping and as long as there is only one location, expect ppl to camp.  It's not like cs were players have to keep an eye on two locations. If they had another hostage, I think it would force more movement when there is a last guy or if last 2 guys stacked on one location. But maps are pretty small, don't think it can handle 2 locations."
Rainbow6,3aagrc,geofurb,2,Thu Jun 18 21:15:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe cut to the outside of the house and show rescue workers/medics streaming in to help out? Just something to show that the hostage was rescued, so you feel like that's what you got done, that's the idea, right?"

Hostages are never good as a game mechanic because people rarely care for the lives of pixelated people. The very purpose of a hostage is to deter an assault and yet that deterrent is null by the fact that the defenders can't actually do anything to them. Honestly, they should really brainstorm and come up with something better. Hell, even a bundle of cash being fought over by two highly tactical organizations makes more sense because the money would have inherent value to both sides and they would all want it to be in their possession unharmed."
Rainbow6,3a7q1o,iBen95111,10,Wed Jun 17 21:52:42 2015 UTC,check out this thread Ubi said that it is not to find bugs or issues but to stress test servers etc. Someone even asks if they will be releasing a broken game.

Rainbow6,3a7q1o,WhiteRenard,2,Wed Jun 17 22:20:15 2015 UTC,"Lately in game development, seems like QA's good enough that they don't really need a long beta to find new bugs and hammer them out. The beta period is helpful in finding stuff that doesn't break except in high-volume situations, or on untested hardware configurations. It gives them a chance to make sure that most things are running smoothly on release so everyone can play; it's much easier to patch games now that we've got automatic updaters like UPlay and Steam, so if they do find further problems, they can ship out a patch pretty painlessly. The old dynamic of doing a rigorous closed-beta test well in advance of launch to find the critical and common bugs is from an era when QA standards were a lot lower. You still see a title ship with major issues sometimes, but it's not nearly what it used to be. (Think back!) Unfortunately, a lot of times the issue is optimization; either there wasn't enough time for it in the development cycle, or they didn't test on the right hardware, and that's a ""non-critical"" issue that can drag out and ruin someone's game for quite a while."

That wouldn't work well with the attackers and defenders way of doing things and the barricade/scout phase.  They couldn't make doors work with it, so they probably didn't put much effort into TD either.  Frankly, TD sucks and ends up with people camping for no reason or running around at opposite ends of the map because there is no focal point.    The only reason TD was so popular on Ravenshield was because teams did not switch sides on the Objective game types so it wasn't fair in competitions.  If a match was 7 rounds, your team played all 7 on one side and didn't switch from attacker to defender like Siege does after each round.

Creating a split screen to do that would put even more stress on such a system as now it,s doubling the allocation. I doubt that it can be done.

RAM I can see, since you've gotta keep track of more geometry. If the game can run at 60 FPS in multiplayer on console, you figure it could manage 30 FPS split-screen, especially if it's CPU-bound, since you don't have to do the physics twice to render the game two players on the same box!

It was like being dead, as it should be.  The way they have it now with ""Last Stand"" feature that they took from COD, gives it more of an arcade-like play.  Can you honestly see this happening in a real gunfight?  Maybe helping the wounded get off the premises, that's about it.  Ammunition Resupply.  All this does is encourage players to haste-fully use their weapons, and it promotes spamming gunfire.  In the original Rainbow Six games, it sometimes came down to your last grenade, and it was up to you to use it wisely and tactfully.  There wasn't a ""resupply"" cushion.    The wire outline of your team mates that can be seen through walls just shouldn't be a feature in this game.  I understand it can be turned off but it's just a peeve of mine."

They cant just cater to hard core fans because they would be losing a large amount of money. With the ridiculous amount of money it takes to make a game these days, I cant blame them for catering to the masses."

Rainbow6,3a885q,ShadowgateKDA,6,Thu Jun 18 00:17:32 2015 UTC,It's a pretty standard rollout practice actually. They'll keep dropping bits and pieces between now and release to keep excitement fresh. It's silly to say there's not going to be a single player just because they talked about co-op. Do you think all that stuff with White Mask and Angela Basset is all for co-op? That's quite obviously all the campaign story elements. The devs have also officially stated many timed in multiple threads that there will be a single player campaign.
Rainbow6,3a885q,iceycat,2,Thu Jun 18 00:30:06 2015 UTC,They announced where you will play scenario based missions. I think it might be co-op as well. The white mask people starting attacking and six ask you to build up a brand new team to go against the white mask terrorist. I think that is the basic of the story.
Rainbow6,3a885q,ChernoAlpha_Mk1,5,Thu Jun 18 00:38:15 2015 UTC,I like a return to scenario based missions. In Vegas you had either the Las Vegas missions or the Mexican missions and there was that one off snow mission in the beginning of Vegas 2. I preferred the older way of doing missions were you got deployed all over the world as needed. Glad they're going back to that.

I went to the Ubisoft beta website as mentioned in the email and when I logged in, I clicked on the PSN button rather than username (email address) and password.  As this was already linked (from playing previous Ubisoft games) it accepted my user and a few minutes later I got an email saying thank you for your support etc. I will get another email closer to the date with instructions on how to get the Beta on PS4.    It may be that it is getting confused with your preferred platform.  I hadn't tried to register for the Beta before this pre-order from Amazon.

Have to agree with what someone else here said, though I hadn't consciously processed it; the ""summon wave"" mechanic when you plant a defuser is pretty out-of-place. It'd be much smoother if the enemy started their counterattack as soon as they realized you were breaking through the defenses at a bomb site. Less fanfare, more human-like reaction.

I was just reading that Fallout 4 will have mod support on the Xbox One where somehow PC mods will be functional for the Xbox One. This must have something to do with how Microsoft is putting Windows 10 as the OS on the One when it releases. I don't really understand how it will all work, but I AM thrilled with the possibility of what this means if true. Having mod support across not only PC, but also Xbox One for Siege would be amazing! If Bethesda can implement it, I hope Ubisoft can too."
Rainbow6,3a29ad,geofurb,2,Tue Jun 16 19:35:45 2015 UTC,The cross-platform modding capability was a huge play.

We've had trigger happy terrorists in Raven Shield when we get 'runners', these runners are especially eager on any mission involving securing goddamn laptops. Map design and objective placement has the biggest influence on whether the player could preempt runners with practical routes to cut them off before they harm the objective."

I honestly don't mind it, in fact I love it only for the fact that the FPS market has been so stale at least they always bring something new to the table regardless if you like it or not. Last thing we need is another franchise like COD that release the same game over and over again.  Team outlines i don't know what to say, that's some ghost recon bs that needs to go."
Rainbow6,3a15ap,forzaitalia458,4,Tue Jun 16 13:25:45 2015 UTC,"They have already said there won't be doors.  They also said the white outlines will stay but may be able to be a server side option to eliminate it.  The lack of doors is very frustrating.  They are trying to add in a new element but at the cost of removing a CQB staple for strategy that is also more realistic.  Without them, it breaks the immersion for me and reduces realistic strategies.  The worst deal breaker for me though is the Operatives.  I don't want to be forced to play some pre-made character that I don't want to play just because someone else clicked faster.  I want all weapons and gadgets available to everyone, like all previous R6 games.  You can't force people to play as a team just by restricting what they can do, and I think in the end that will cause the biggest drop in players."
Rainbow6,3a15ap,Pest_AWC,2,Tue Jun 16 13:37:57 2015 UTC,In regards to operators I think it works well in insurgency and hopefully will work here.   Insurgency limits certain classes to prevent a team of snipers.   I wish more games would do this.

Rainbow6,3a15ap,twinspectregaming,2,Wed Jun 17 15:00:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly can someone break down exactly what having doors adds to the game?  Would there be someone running around closing all the doors at start of game, and shutting them behind them after moving throughout the house?    On the other hand what does the barricade system add.  In a word decisions.  You have to decide what areas to spend time shoring up, and select what side of the barricade you are going to be on.  Granted to avoid wasting time during the planning phase I think it would be useful if you could clip thought the barricades as they are not yet in place but a transparent silhouette.  Just an idea.  I saw a bunch of people tear down barricades just to have to put them back up because they wanted to be on the other side.    As for messy destruction this is based on particle count, there are normally a few settings that you can do to adjust this at least on PC to reduce lag.  To be most tactical reduce particle count then you could ""see"" through it.  Also worst case if enough people think it is too much say so during the beta, things like that are not as difficult to adjust after development.    On the other side of things low visability works both ways.  It could be as much a hinder as a help.    I am really looking forward to this game release, even more so after the reveal of yesterday.  So I really don't see where you are coming from saying nothing has changed."
Rainbow6,3a15ap,MRMYSTICIGR,3,Tue Jun 16 17:28:04 2015 UTC,"What do doors add?  I'll try to break it down, but if you played any of the previous R6 games in Mulitplayer you should understand, especially Ravenshield.  Doors add realism and depth to the situations.    On offense you can crack, frag, and close the door.  You can choose to play stealthy and slow and partially open a door to peak inside without fully exposing yourself, or you can barge in quickly, or you can blow the door with a breaching charge.  You can use them as a distraction by opening one while the rest of your team barges through one at the opposite side.  In some CQB games like SWAT4 you can look under them with a camera.  On defense, you could watch them and let your team know when you see one open.  If there were no doors, then there is nothing to slow down a team from just running in from anywhere without warning.  You could set C4 out in a hallway and blow it when you start to see the nearby door open.    Bottom line though, it's friggin realistic and helps people be immersed in a game.  Otherwise, you're just playing an old Run N Gun Call Of Duty game.  That has never been what R6 was about."
Rainbow6,3a15ap,Pest_AWC,2,Tue Jun 16 21:17:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you for explaining the various ways that having doors can influence gameplay.  I can not argue that they make things more tactical and allow you to have quiet infiltration.    My only argument opposite would be that perhaps they recognize those points as well but given the namesake SIEGE they have a different idea.  I am not going to recite the definition of siege but in short one force attacks a heavily fortified opposing force.  There is little to no quiet infiltration in a siege.  The enemy expects retaliation based on their actions and so they prepare for it.    On their behalf they have still given the players some choices with the existing system.  You can poke a small hole with a bullet or a gun stock, or a larger hole with a hammer or a shotgun, or create a new door with explosives.  If they allow certain operators to have portable motion sensors or laser trip mines you will still get some booby trap scenarios.  On the argument doors cause lag that is a reality, one example is minecraft.  In vanilla there is not a whole lot of processing power needed to host a server, but if you put a bunch of doors opening and closing in rapid succession you would get lag.  Perhaps the lag is more in terms of late data reception, and not so much lag in the general definition of the word.  They could mean quite a few different things when they use the term lag, if they would like to clarify that would be great."

Rainbow6,3a15ap,ThatOneMxcnGuy,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:15:16 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with you. In swat4 we used to have two kind of doors (wood and metal ones). Some weapons could perforate through wood doors but not metal and some from both (like AK47). Now as a terrorist we used this advantage in some maps where many doors were present. Blocking the doors by body and shooting it through to kill the enemy (swat team for ex) behind it.

Rainbow6,3a15ap,twinspectregaming,1 point,Thu Jun 18 15:10:48 2015 UTC,are they listening? :\  they are making this game even more casual friendly than it was?
Rainbow6,3a15ap,TheLucarian,2,Tue Jun 16 19:59:34 2015 UTC,"It is hard as fuck. Wait till you play it, until then you have to take my word on it.  Edit: and yes, they are listening."

Rainbow6,3a15ap,TheLucarian,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:04:49 2015 UTC,"They are listening, but that doesn't mean they are fulfilling every wishlist everyone has. But they listen, and recoil and damage feels perfect imo."
Rainbow6,3a15ap,kreios86,-1,Fri Jun 19 10:12:49 2015 UTC,"Correction, they are listening as long as what we say line up with share/stake holders requirements."

Rainbow6,39zjil,electr1cpanda,7,Tue Jun 16 01:36:43 2015 UTC,Great news! Thanks for this! I see hit markers in the new videos. Can we expect this to be fixed in the Beta? Will you be removing player outlines?

Rainbow6,39yzzh,Khlilo98,3,Mon Jun 15 22:56:10 2015 UTC,"Looks a lot better than earlier gameplay. Granted just because they played smart, doesn't mean that playing dumb doesn't work. Also, the kickback is a lot better. Wish it was a tiny bit more, but I guess they have to find a balance between realistic and casual. Also towards the end, he gets shot and receives no damage at all which is a little concerning. Also wish there was no ""revive."" Maybe there's a hardcore mode though.  Overall, liking it a lot better. Just need to do some more things we've suggested. Those lines around allies are annoying."
Rainbow6,39yzzh,SteveEsquire,3,Tue Jun 16 01:33:07 2015 UTC,"My only complaint is that the AI seemed a little bit slow to react; it didn't keep cover from one side when it was fighting the other, didn't change tactics when it got flanked. (This is all about combat around the 3:27 mark and 3:40 mark.)  Recoil is the same as it was in alpha, I think, because they only increased recoil on the PC. They're playing with controllers, so you see the recoil working the way it's supposed to. I might be wrong here!  Very excited about how much more they've made this about teamwork than past terrohunt modes. Originally there was very little teamwork required, then you had to watch each other's back so they didn't flank you, now you finally have to work together to provide each other cover, suppressing fire, revives (if you're lucky!), breaching, etc!"
Rainbow6,39yzzh,geofurb,1 point,Tue Jun 16 02:00:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, definitely agree about the AI. They can still fix a lot, but it seems better than the stuff I'd seen up to today."
Rainbow6,39yzzh,SteveEsquire,2,Tue Jun 16 02:38:10 2015 UTC,"That said, I posted this in more detail elsewhere, it's a lot better than the Vegas 2 AI, and I think it's going to be much more challenging."
Rainbow6,39yzzh,geofurb,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:48:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed. In Vegas 2 you would walk up to a certain point, take out every ai from cover and done. Rinse and repeat w/ 3 buddies for max xp'age!"
Rainbow6,39yzzh,Jupiler08,3,Tue Jun 16 12:48:40 2015 UTC,"Well... In Vegas 2 I'd team up with one buddy, since I had no friends, and my brother wasn't a fan of it, get good cover, and fire off an unsuppressed shot or two. They'd come a few at a time, ready to get murdered. Then we'd move up a little bit more, repeat. There were 50 friggin' terrorists; as soon as they knew where you were, they should've tasked a bunch to wipe you out intelligently. If they only had an idea of where you were, they should've tasked a group or two to sweep your area and look for you, not just go up there, stand around, not see anything, and go back to waiting to get shot.  These guys seem to have made an intelligent counter-assault, which is awesome."
Rainbow6,39yzzh,geofurb,1 point,Tue Jun 16 17:46:09 2015 UTC,"I feel there is a reliance on numbers rather than amazing AI routines, however it still looks incredibly intense."
Rainbow6,39yzzh,torchedEARTH,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:54:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah; if I were the AI, I'd've tried to assault from hall and breach opposite windows simultaneously, then breach the wall by stairs and the windows opposite that, so you've always got the enemy from both sides, 180 degrees apart. Still, it's a coordinated assault, and we've seen very little of it. It's entirely possible there are other behaviors that didn't make it in time for the E3 demo, or that the AI behaves rather differently in other areas.  In the longer gameplay segment from Tuesday I was a little disappointed that the AI doesn't start sending groups sweeping for you when it hears gunshots; I feel like it would've been very cool to see the AI dictating the terms of engagement more assertively."
Rainbow6,39yzzh,geofurb,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:46:07 2015 UTC,"I have to say, this looks freaking awesome! Is it possible to just play 2 players against the AI? Both online and offline?"

This will start a countdown, and as you wait it out, waves of enemies will rush the area, breaching walls and windows and doing everything in their power to destroy your defuser and eliminate your team.""

Rainbow6,39yzky,Emanuel-Zorg,5,Mon Jun 15 22:53:00 2015 UTC,So.....whats the point of having a beta? Thats not nearly enough time to test before release. Does Ubi think they dont need any major testing? That would be increadibly arrogant if true.
Rainbow6,39yzky,gkconnor91,2,Mon Jun 15 23:43:31 2015 UTC,"Something to keep in mind is that this is a game we'll be supporting long after launch, which will include tweaks and updates to the game. Closed Beta isn't a ""last chance"" kind of deal. We'll be focused on testing things like matchmaking and server infrastructure during CB to ensure a smooth launch."
Rainbow6,39yzky,electr1cpanda,6,Mon Jun 15 23:55:29 2015 UTC,"so does this mean we'll have to ""test"" a buggy launch? Apologies for the hostility, but if there's anything we need it's yet another ubi game with yet another truckload of launch issues regarding a rushed... over-marketed product."
Rainbow6,39yzky,Gotohellcadz,10,Mon Jun 15 23:58:35 2015 UTC,"No, our QA team is there to stomp out bugs (and they're pretty good, the number of issues that came up in the Closed Alpha was minimal). The Closed Beta test will be to ensure that matchmaking and server stability is strong for launch, among other things.   I hear your concern. That's not the approach we're trying to take with this game."
Rainbow6,39yzky,electr1cpanda,3,Tue Jun 16 00:12:27 2015 UTC,Thanks for your responses. It's nice to at least have some contact rather than be completely in the dark.

Matchmaking, dedicated or player hosted, is utterly inferior."
Rainbow6,39yzky,mau5eum,3,Tue Jun 16 15:10:21 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Ubi has been getting a lot of bad rep for releasing buggy/half-made games.

Open/Closed Beta's now days are glorified Demos and this ones beta is going to greatly effect the sales. With the removal of doors for horrid reasons. Yes EP ive read them all even the one from Chris Lee which made me a sad panda. One of the things that needs to be changed but probably wont is the server issue. Match Making is a bad, BAD idea so is 'Private Lobbies.' We as paying players need to stop buying some of these games to get the point across."

Rainbow6,39yzky,mau5eum,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:45:18 2015 UTC,"Your history is irrelevant.  Early Access and Pre-orders, that's what the industry is these days.  Next to no major companies utilise testing services any more, which leaves us with a short closed/open ""stress testing"" so they can compile a list of issues to work on after release.  I can't remember the last time a major title was released that didn't require immediate updating to fix serious issues, issues that shouldn't have made it past testing, and some being present in subsequent releases.  Sloppy, that's what they've all become, because they know they'll be profitable."

Rainbow6,39z2uo,iceycat,0,Mon Jun 15 23:56:53 2015 UTC,"Very excited for this! Also excited about this AI strategy manager coordinating the enemies. The fact that Vegas 2 enemies didn't all work together was the biggest drawback in their terrorist hunt; they'd come at you a few at a time, sorta coordinate with each other, but you imagine a real enemy would get on the radio and organize a large counterassault, or start flipping over tables for cover and watching whatever direction they'd last seen you coming from... And Siege looks like it's going to deliver just that! Counterattack in the E3 demo looked like they were all working together exactly like that! (Didn't do them a lot of good, but I imagine it's a lot tougher than it looks.)"
Rainbow6,39z2uo,geofurb,5,Tue Jun 16 01:29:39 2015 UTC,"Genuinely happy that they created competent AI leagues ahead of other shooters, enemies that are not compartmentalised, are neither deaf and waiting for you to shoot them while they stand behind cover, nor hoard mode mindlessly running to your position.  Terrorist Hunt Classic though? Planning mode, real time map-based (Ghost Recon style) or line of sight commands of AI teammates? Also where are their Rainbow uniforms and patches? Fully customised loadouts, instead of AI version of multiplayer? Another thing, mod support? Because I still think your maps are too damn small."

Rainbow6,39k2k3,JonathanRL,6,Fri Jun 12 07:31:57 2015 UTC,"Not sure who downvoted you without commenting on why they disagree with you.  I'm stricter with regards with automatic fire, the problem with most video games even on the hardest setting, ammo is still a non-issue. Single fire all the way, leave the automatic fire for suppression and preferably to the automatic rifleman. I know it sounds counter-intuitive but especially in CQB the margin of error is so tight that should you get hit, you may clench down on the trigger in a stack, you could perforate your team mates, the hostages, IEDs. Ironically it's casual games like GTA and Saints Row that have trigger clenching mechanics."
Rainbow6,39k2k3,jonowee,2,Fri Jun 12 09:40:43 2015 UTC,"You have a huge point with ammo almost never being an issue anymore. I think Half Life 2  was the last time I had issues with ammo management and that was in Ravenholme - a place where it was intentional. Far Cry 3 also had good moments where ammo management was an issue but you only needed more animal hides to get out of that, and you made sure to get them as early as possible."
Rainbow6,39k2k3,jonowee,2,Fri Jun 12 09:45:16 2015 UTC,"The only game with smaller sized maps I have found to have an ammo shortage issue part of its game design is Insurgency. Because it has respawn waves, if you've done well and have survived for a long time, you will run out of ammo as you cannot resupply outfield and can only use what's left in the magazine of weapons picked up from dead bodies before they despawn. Your only hope is to have your teammates hold your position while you run off back from however deep in enemy territory to home base's buy zone. Also the inventory system let's you balance between weapons,  attachments, gadgets, body armour, and magazine slots.  ArmA, small groups either spawn in resupply crates or large clans have the logistics team to drive/fly/boat out resupply vehicles out to the field. ArmA has a full inventory management system so that you could just pick up the magazines off bodies or get given between alive players. Battlefield 2 and Project Reality allows you to swap your entire kit from a dead body, but they change the art on your character's third person model giving you a hybrid design of both factions' uniform.  But a big part of the games mentioned is conflicting factions normally run different ammunition types. 5.56, 7.62, 5.45, .50 on the same map makes the sound of the particular weapons used quite important for IFF, and discourages willy nilly picking up of enemy weapons and vehicles. Falklands maps are pretty interesting where both sides have FN FALs.   While we do have rifles versus sub machine guns in Rainbow Six: Siege, the sound mix in Siege so far has been  pretty lame to be honest. Siege currently also has no resupply or kit swapping functionality, combined with speed reloads dumping still usable mags. Ubisoft Montreal's solution is to flood the arena with butt loads of starting ammunition."
Rainbow6,39k2k3,GHOST-117,3,Sun Jun 14 19:49:06 2015 UTC,"yep that's one reason why its necessary, while another reason is that people like me only use single-fire mode, always, on all SMGs/Carbines/Rifles. This is a smaller sub-group of course, your point is true more generally for most people who like Tac-shooters"
Rainbow6,39k2k3,iceycat,2,Fri Jun 12 15:05:40 2015 UTC,Very effective demonstration of your point. What else needs to be said? There is absolutely no reason to not have selective fire weapons in this game.
Rainbow6,39k2k3,forzaitalia458,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:22:13 2015 UTC,only reason they might have: Devs are too lazy to balance the guns with multiple fire modes. looks like they running out of time if they want to release by nov
Rainbow6,39k2k3,iceycat,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:17:09 2015 UTC,You think so? i think they have they plenty of time to implement this. It's not like it requires new animation states or something. Sure someone would have to write the code for the functionality and code the changes to accuracy for the other fire mode plus make some kind of on screen graphic indicator or something to show what fire more you're in probably. I think that's not too hard to implement if they wanted to. There's a little more to it than that but i think there's plenty of time to do it if they wanted to.
Rainbow6,39k2k3,forzaitalia458,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:25:24 2015 UTC,"when i look at games like battlefield that are constantly tweaking and re-balancing their weapons long after the game launched, I'm under the impression that it's not as easy as you make it seem. even more so if they want unique recoil patterns.   tweaking these guns would require a good amount of testing. If you look at it in numbers perspective, let say there are 20 guns, meaning 20 gun profiles. adding single fire would make it 40 gun profiles, adding 3 round burst would mean 60 gun profiles (if all guns had 3 modes). That's a lot of stats to tweak and test to make sure it's balanced. Maybe I'm wrong though and it wouldn't be as complicated am I make it seem. Either ways I do hope they add it as it does add variety"
Rainbow6,39k2k3,iceycat,1 point,Mon Jun 15 15:37:19 2015 UTC,"A fair point. That may well be the case. I think in games like CoD AW it was just poor play testing that resulted in having to rework everything several times. When it comes to burst fire, not every gun has it though so I wouldn't say it would leap up to 60 variations as in your example, but I get what you mean."
Rainbow6,39k2k3,jonowee,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:04:32 2015 UTC,"Battlefield does not use fixed spray patterns like Counter Strike, there is a behaviour values range within which that the game randomly applies to spread and recoil.  In order to avoid a too long a comment as I should be sleeping now, I'll jump straight onto how BF4 fire modes affect gun behaviour. Only a few rare exceptions where the burst mode has increased cyclic rate, two off the top of my head are the AK-12 and AN-94. Next the first shot multiplier (FSM), which increases the base recoil values, only applies the longer you hold down the trigger. So single shot, manually cycled (bolt and pump action), and burst fire are not affected as full auto because the FSM is not applied by the game on the first trigger pull."
Rainbow6,39k2k3,sonoblink,0,Mon Jun 15 21:11:04 2015 UTC,"Bottom left corner ?? Yup it was a crytek game nothing to do with ubi^  The rest of your argument's out the window anyways i do agree,any self respecting tact shooter should have select fire;)"

Rainbow6,39jqld,JonathanRL,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:00:44 2015 UTC,"If it's Watchdogs 2, I really hope they make the tiny tweak that could have made you actually feel like a spy in the first one:  Watchdogs had a multiplayer mode where you could invade someone else's world. You'd appear as an ordinary NPC, and you wouldn't be revealed by some obscene game-y mechanism until you started hacking them.  So if you didn't want them to scan you and realize you're onto them, you had to walk and act like an ordinary person, try to blend in with the NPC crowd. Trying to blend in video games is nothing new, but trying to blend in a crowd of AIs to hide from a human player is something noteworthy. There's actual pressure, the person hunting you actually thinks intelligently, scans for abnormal behavior beyond the confines of some limited script.  Unfortunately, this was limited to one small facet of the game, and never really hit its true potential. If they make a Watchdogs 2, they could do far better by having players constantly walking through each other's worlds so that there are human spies to hide from or to look for everywhere. You'll actually feel like a spy the entire time, actually have to try to blend in and move around covertly. No more running through the street and treating the world like an obstacle course; you'd have to watch for the light to cross, move with crowds, drive legally... Until you were ready to make a move.

Notes for expansion on the above question:    Instead of starting a new IP rather than hamfisting something (the strict class system) that was never really the focus into the established Rainbow Six brand. Both Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six class system were based on operator experience points and ability skills to perform tasks and operate gadgets, rather than extremely limited weapons and gadgets.

Rainbow6,39c9as,JonathanRL,1 point,Sat Jun 13 05:44:33 2015 UTC,"I do like that question because it raises the points of Rainbow Six wanting to be its own franchise and yet court COD and BF players, who are happy buying (IMHO) the same game again and again.  And that game they are happy to keep buying isn't Rainbow Six."
Rainbow6,39c9as,torchedEARTH,0,Wed Jun 10 20:44:25 2015 UTC,"Why the formula/direction/strategy/identity of R6 is constantly changing    lolz, dude i'll save you the time and answer that right now: The original R6 games had a vision that wasn't geared solely towards the sales figures (it was ""art""), while CoD/BF never had any such hang-ups (they are ""products""). And like a lot of other stuff that started out as art, but gradually became a product, R6 had to change, while these other products you mentioned did not.   p.s. Disclaimer, I did not play CoD before (MW1)... it's possible the same thing happened to CoD as well... And for all I know BF has some similar legacy before I played it as well... but whatever, I'm not gonna let ""facts"" get in the way of a good argument!! lolz j/k, in that case the same thing would apply to CoD/BF's own respective legacies..."
Rainbow6,39c9as,GHOST-117,4,Thu Jun 11 18:59:48 2015 UTC,"I agree games now are much more of a commodity than art.  Whether or not that is true is irrelevant.  The end goal for each is making a good game that makes money.  How much money is the question.  I'll get to that below.  I have played COD and BF since the first ones.  Those games have definitely evolved, but that is expected and necessary.  However, the core gameplay has remained largely the same.  Those games weren't always the heavyweights they are now, but have built that ""following"" over the years by sticking to the core of the game. COD:MW is a perfect example of this.  Once COD went ""modern"" the game blew up, but the gameplay is almost identical to COD1&2 (never played COD3 as it was console only).  It was essentially repackaged as a modern day shooter and people ate that shit up (including me).  Sure they added stuff to the game and tweaked some things but the gameplay and mechanics were no different. This continues to the most recent CODs.  I can easily make the same argument for all the iterations of BF, from 1942 to Hardline.  Now compare that to Rainbow Six.  Aside from the first 3 versions which were similar and built upon the last, the last 3 (Lockdown, Vegas 1/2, and Siege) were each completely different from the previous and even more so from the first 3.  How can R6 continue to build a ""following"" like CoD and BF have over the years if there is no continuity between the games?  Now getting back to the beginning, more ""followers"" = more money.  How do you get more followers? By building upon the existing community (e.g CoD/BF) with each iteration, not starting over every time (R6)."

Rainbow6,39ajmt,Harvey_Dole,3,Fri Jun 12 13:24:40 2015 UTC,"Q: Why did they choose an engine that can't handle working doors without lag, and thus force them to be the first R6 game to not have WORKING DOORS in a CQB environment?  Q: Why does each new R6 game since Ravenshield have to go in a different direction than the first 3 R6 games instead of building on the playstyle and depth unique to the R6 (first 3 only) and SWAT series?  R6 was a TOP SELLING game and didn't ""need"" to change to try to steal fans from other games.  On the contrary, people played R6 along with those other games in order to have a different experience.  Q: Why do they never consider fan feedback until the core game is pretty much set in stone?  Examples: Lockdown - No fans asked for an arcadey experience, Vegas - No fans asked for 3rd person, Health Regen, and non-matching teammate uniforms.  Siege - Nobody asked for Pre-defined Operators in MP with restrictions on weapons/gadgets, teams that look alike so you can't visually tell Friend from Foe, white outlines of teammates seen through wall, lack of working doors, lack of in-game map, or simplifying guns to remove fire-select and realistic clip management.  Thanks Deosl!"
Rainbow6,39ajmt,Pest_AWC,6,Wed Jun 10 15:40:47 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'll answer your questions.    The answer we gave before was not solely based on lag. The decision to remove doors was an intentional design decision, not because our engine can't handle them. Doors are a pretty complex issue (See ""The Door Problem"" http://ubm.io/QUUb6C) and after a long and careful study, playtesting different options, we chose to not include them.    ""This pushes the players on the defending side to actively fortify their location, ultimately designing their own fortress. Having a more open starting location means that the defenders will have to carefully decide how they want to spend their preparation phase time, since time is what limits the amount of fortifications that can be erected before the attackers arrive.""   I'm not going to get into a discussion about business decisions because I was not in those meetings and it's not my place to comment, but let's be clear - more people played Vegas than first three games combined. Elements in Siege are more similar to the original titles than the Vegas series was, but you have to understand that the Rainbow Six fans are not just limited to those who played Raven Shield.  This isn't an open dev project. The amount of feedback we've taken and acted upon, and communicated about, is fairly unprecedented for a AAA publisher. Are we perfect? Absolutely not, but we are trying and will get better. Still, it's our game designer's job to dream up new and engaging things for you to play. Remember what Henry Ford said? ""“If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.”   Pest, I know you really wanted to see a Raven Shield remake but that is not what is happening with Siege. If you're interested in Siege, I think we've shown that we're willing to listen and work together. You can take advantage of that. Personally speaking, I think spending every day yelling about doors doesn't contribute anything to the community, and in fact it takes away from it.   Let's try to move forward in a constructive manner. Please let me know if there is anything else I can help answer, or anything I can do to help you feel better about everything."
Rainbow6,39ajmt,electr1cpanda,2,Thu Jun 11 14:07:40 2015 UTC,"@ Panda:   Remember what Henry Ford said? ""“If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.”   Whoa hold on..... a qualification is in order here. This quote (which I posted) applies with the caveat that: the product being developed is stretching the boundaries of possibilities, and therefore the average person will not be able to comprehend its utility. That is the condition that MUST be met for this quote to be applicable. It does not apply automatically, across the board.  In some areas, yes, the game designers of Siege are pushing those boundaries, but in others, they clearly are not. If, for example, they leave out ROF switch, include silhouettes etc. These won't be progressive steps forward, they'd be regressive steps backwards, and that quote would not apply. Even though doors are not a biggie for me, I fully understand Pest's concerns, I just have those same concerns about things like Recoil, Rate-of-Fire selector, silhouettes, weapon handling etc. It remains to be seen if the final product pushes boundaries or regresses into oblivion.   Also, even though I never agreed with Pest's ""sales"" argument in the first place, I also don't agree with your defense of Vegas's sales as a counter-argument (for the exact same reason). It should not matter what game sold well. Just because Vegas sold more then RvS, or RS sold more then a purple elephant or whatever DOES NOT DICTATE THE FUTURE. That is a logical fallacy to begin with and it also defies empirical rigor, there are way too many variables economists/financial analysts ignore when they make silly psudo-scientific projections like this.   And more importantly, such arguments are completely besides the point. Do you guys really think Alexander Graham Bell was comparing the net earnings of the post office when he invented the Telephone?! That's not how progress happens.... No wonder there is no actual creativity in corporations. All their ""innovation"" is born in the minds of people working at M.I.T (and other centers of actual innovation) DECADES before the corporations monetize their scientific work, and then sell it to the same people who paid for its development (with taxes). And by the way, this also applies to Henry Ford, he didn't invent sh*t, he just picked the right horse to back and monetized it efficiently. Most corporations these days don't even amount to that level of intelligence because they're too busy looking at historical sales figures to decide on future product lines... And then when their stupid ideas invariably fail, the worker bees get canned while the executives take a huge bonus and go buy an island or something as a reward for breaking the damn world economy...  .... Rant Over."
Rainbow6,39ajmt,GHOST-117,5,Thu Jun 11 17:13:46 2015 UTC,"This is why I usually do not comment on these things because there are many different angles to consider and I'm not going to get into a long argument. The points I made were simply meant to dispel two false statements:   That Raven Shield was the best selling game ever and that it's a bad business decision to try something new.  That development should be dictated by the demands of a few people.    At the end of the day I want this subreddit to grow, to become a healthy, constructive community where everyone has a voice and we have earnest debates and discussions. What I don't want it to be is a small corner where a few people come to be nasty because Siege isn't exactly what they personally wanted."
Rainbow6,39ajmt,electr1cpanda,3,Thu Jun 11 17:56:58 2015 UTC,"it's a bad business decision to try something new.   This also requires qualification, because as you know Panda, most of the decisions that are being criticized aren't ""new"" at all in FPS gaming... They've been present in more arcadey games for a long time. Not having a fire-selector, silhouettes, no doors etc. is nothing new. A lot of FPS games are built like this.  The people who are criticizing these things are doing so from a reference point of experience with them, not irrationally complaining about ""change"" in the rainbow legacy.  Think about this: most of the genuinely ""new"" stuff that Siege is introducing is actually well liked (case in point: wall entries.) The only criticism on this point here was not to over-do it.  p.s. I'm not trying to argue with you buddy (honestly, i like you too much lolz), plus I know you're hands are tied so it's not fair, since you're representing Ubi and sometimes won't be able to speak freely anyway. I'm just saying that a vast majority of the points of criticism on this forum have been valid and I hope the Devs continue to hear us out, and do what they can to keep the game in line with the spirit of R6."
Rainbow6,39ajmt,GHOST-117,0,Thu Jun 11 18:28:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the very detailed reply, but...   I never claimed Ravenshield was the best selling game ever.  It was a top seller at the time of release compared with other AAA titles like COD and BF.  Vegas did much better, but it did so 3.5 years later when sales of Xbox 360 and PS 3 were huge and Vegas cashed in on that new surge.  Unfortunately, we'll never know what could have been had UBI followed the R6 formula of the original 3 instead of going in a completely different direction with Vegas. A Few people?  The number of people wanting a game to fill the gap between arcade games like COD and BF and hardcore games isn't minor and has driven kickstarters that eventually can't compete against AAA budgets.  How can you justify taking R6 in a different direction each time instead of providing a similar level of depth and realism as the first 3 games?  COD and BF keep the level similar and still manage to innovate and draw in more and more players year after year and release after release.  It's a shame that its almost to the point now where the term ""Rainbow Six"" doesn't mean anything other than some type of CQB shooting game (can't even say CQB FPS since Vegas tossed in 3rd person).   You say you want the subreddit to grow, but after the Alpha when R6 fans learned the direction Siege was headed (and the fact that it even became MORE dumbed down since the E3 reveal) caused a lot of people to ignore this subreddit and look elsewhere.    I do appreciate the straight answer on the DOORS issue as the old answers dodged it.  It's a shame to trade something as realistic and as integral a part of CQB games for tossing up strategic barricades, but I get it that resources of programming have to be managed.  I just won't agree with the choice, especially after testing the Alpha game."
Rainbow6,39ajmt,Pest_AWC,5,Fri Jun 12 02:36:16 2015 UTC,"I hear you. Raven Shield was an awesome game. I'm pretty sure I spent 3x the amount of time planning out the operation than I did actually playing it. Your opinions aren't invalid and I think it's good to advocate for changes that keep Siege more in line with the heart of the franchise, like game pacing from the Closed Alpha, etc. But there does have to be some compromise.   I'm speaking personally here but we're not out to capitalize on the name, or steal players from other games. The dev team is full of Rainbow fans like you and me who just want to make a fun game that's different from other shooters out there, and gives you some of the same feelings you got from the old games. And we do care what you have to say, I hope we've shown some of that so far.  One interesting thing I noticed during the Closed Alpha was the overall reaction to the game was pretty positive, but you would come in the subreddit and it was like a bomb went off! If anyone said anything positive, they'd get yelled at and downvoted. From my perspective, that's a big reason why the growth of the subreddit stagnated and people ignored it - because it was kind of a hostile environment.   Lest this thread get any more off track (sorry Deosl!) I'll leave it here. Just wanted to provide some personal perspective and I'm sorry that you feel as frustrated as you do."

I apologize for any derailment with negative comments...other than adding in my jabs of lack of working doors... :)  My biggest reasons for being negative during Alpha, was it really did upset me that Siege actually got more casual than even the original E3 footage with addition of white outlines, lack of moving the hostage, shorter times, insta-throw nades, and what looked like faster less strategic play.  If I am going to be involved in a positive discussion on Siege Multiplayer, the only things I like are rappelling, one life, objective based instead of Team Deathmatch, teams switching sides after a round, multiple spawn choices, some destruction (but most is unrealistically over-done and inconsistent), planned changes made to weapon handling, planned changes to hitmarkers, planned changes to movement, and your interaction with us...So at least there is that?  :)"

Comparing the sales of Red Storm as an indie developer and then newly acquired Ubisoft subsidiary; contrasting to Vegas coming in an era with the marketing might of Ubisoft, the explosion of YouTube (even before the recent popularity of the Let's Play formula) that offered more insight for potential customers than staring at text and still images in reviews and user shared content, broadband and digital distribution platforms Steam and XBox Marketplace, Ubisoft budget allowing for multi platform development and sales."

It appears you run a large community meanwhile I run a small group. My small group would only utilize a server system (dedicated servers, private lobbies, rent-a-server) for competitive matches.   Third party websites and companies are used all throughout video games. The most popular shooters, Call of Duty and Counter Strike, both use third party resources to rank teams, record and hold tournaments.   It simply comes down to universally accommodating all types of players. Some things you would like on this game are things I may not use, and vice versa."

Rainbow6,39bhxd,forzaitalia458,1 point,Sat Jun 13 15:34:02 2015 UTC,"Considering that they are counting on a competitive scene and the fact the games are round based one lifers this screams competitive.  There should be an anticipation for clans to form and want to display their allegiance.  Vegas2 had a decent system for identifying clans.  As far as I remember membership was granted in game.  I see no reason to deviate from this.  I was in a highly competitive gamebattles clan during the Vegas2 hayday, the system was okay and sufficed.  However now in days with apps being available, as well as all of the tech now packed into gaming systems, being able to send a clan invite and set up a war without using a website shouldn't be a stretch.    I fear one of the issues is the experience gap for players now.  They never got to experience the fluid and helpful clan management systems that were used in the past for certain games.  Clans are where your competitive circuit lies.  No clan management tools and the opportunities for new organizations to flourish becomes limited.  Not to mention make managing a process of excessive steps and you will limit the number of people willing to take the time to organize things.   Honestly how hard is it to create global variables that would cause a specified action based on system environment and interface.  Invite to clan, show clan tag.  At a bare minimum these should be available.  It isn't like I am asking to be able to spray paint my clan emblem on a wall somewhere, or manage the clans budgetary spending.    Also just because people participating in this reddit don't see a need for clan management features doesn't mean the rest of the community planning to get this game doesn't.  Most of them probably feel that it should go without saying.  These are not new concepts at all.  Maybe the issue is nomenclature, for you guys what does clan management tools mean?"

Most of the the things you speak of are in CALL of DUTY : AW (and older titles) yet it still does not feel or play competitive, in the end it really just is a glorified party system.  Real clan management tools for me would mean being able to manage my clan, send invites, blah blah.. but also to be able to set up clan matches, match times, have ladders, maybe even have league divisions (kind of like how ea sports games have it, division 1 is the best, try to move up divisions, etc.) something to work for rather than just ohhhh clan tag, ohh clan stats"

Rainbow6,397e2j,Suvaius,1 point,Wed Jun 10 12:22:08 2015 UTC,"Wait, which MP modes did Iron Wrath add?"
Rainbow6,397e2j,Suvaius,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:12:12 2015 UTC,"I found a review from IGN with the details here   The Free Backup mode is basically just a deathmatch mode where each player can have up to three AI teammates fighting alongside them. The Limited Seats mode has the players running prisoners to a safe zone on the other side of the map; if even one is killed, the mission is over. The Virus mode requires one team to upload a disc at a certain terminal. If a player holds the disc too long before passing it off to another player, they'll become visible to all the enemy players on the map. Gas Alert is another interesting mode. Here each player gets a 30-second air supply that must be replenished at a number of terminals scattered across the map. By far the most interesting of the modes is Intruder. In this case, one team is tasked with destroying three terminals defended by the other team. Here's the twist: one member of the attacking team is dressed in the defending team's uniform (although with a different color helmet). This player is the Intruder and can demolish a terminal in a matter of seconds. Knocking the intruder out of the game becomes a high priority for the defenders.   Sadly Ubisoft has taken down the CD-key server for Iron Wrath, playing online will require some effort :< But I guess anyone hardly played it or Athena Sword online. People were content with RvS and it was still played heavily in 2005."
Rainbow6,393o9m,iceycat,6,Tue Jun 9 00:59:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think unlocks have a place in mutliplayer titles, even less if it's supposed to be played competitive (ranks, tournaments). I'm fine with earning XP if it's just for showing off your, well, experience. But it should be completely separated from the actual ranking system.  I strongly believe that a difficult and still fun game can be rewarding in itself and doesn't need unlocks to keep you playing."
Rainbow6,393o9m,TheLucarian,4,Tue Jun 9 08:24:48 2015 UTC,"I really have been wondering how the leveling system will work in Siege since the Alpha. I'm hoping it will go to weapon skins, outfit camos, and attachments. Also having a ranking system like CS:GO will be great as well. There is so much more that I need to know about the game to continue. Ubisoft needs to start putting out more information on Single-player, Co-op, and different game modes besides Rescue."

Rainbow6,393o9m,forzaitalia458,2,Tue Jun 9 04:12:04 2015 UTC,I must be the only one who doesn't care about single player. I would be happy to pay less for multiplayer only
Rainbow6,393o9m,ExploTheOne,5,Wed Jun 10 13:35:51 2015 UTC,"Really good video and it states one of my biggest concerns about Siege.  Replayability because of unlocks? Oh, god no. Maybe for an arcade shooter, but not for R6.    I don't want a leveling and unlock system it just doesn't fit into a tactical game like this. Take the CS series as an example, newbie friendly and exceptional competitive opportunities and most of this comes from the fact that it puts everyone on the same level by enabling all of the equipment by default. A competitive ranking system (for only show off and possible matchmaking) would be nice thing to have in Siege.    I like CS games but regardless, my main games are ArmA 3 and Insurgency and sadly they can't really fill in the empty space of a tactical CQB shooter. I would like to immediately experiment with the loadouts which would fit me the most. So please not so much restrictions, i maybe can close my eyes on some operator limited gadgets but i want to have every weapon available for all the operators. They're supposed to be the best of the best so they could handle any weapon.  But at this point sadly even CS:GO is more realistic and re-playable than R6:S, they even introduced that the teams have the same uniforms!!! Where as in Rainbow you can't tell apart friend or foe.  The only thing I liked about the Vegas games that they introduced a really good character customization system (Hell, I spent more time in the menus than in game) even tho it sucked that it had all kinds of retarded options as well (like pink camo and so on).  Since we already have this operator system, which I'm not really fond of so far because all they do is restrict the way i would like to play. Anyways despite this it would be nice if we could still customize each of the operators in the main menu, like weapon loadouts and gear (tac-vest, helmet etc.), with the restrictions of: As an attacker you can only have for eg. navy blue clothing paired with black gear and as a defender you can only set woodland camo clothing with olive drab gear."
Rainbow6,393o9m,geofurb,4,Tue Jun 9 03:37:43 2015 UTC,"I too miss the old way of loading out a character, having everything available all at once. I think having cosmetic unlocks is okay though. I'm not against weapon camos as long as they're realistic ones only, character gear and camos would be fine too, but it doesn't seem like we'll be able to change much of anything on the operators. It seems unlikely that exp. would go only toward rank and nothing else though, so it has to be something...and that's the question we're left with."

Lots of firsts for Siege...It will be the First R6 where you can't choose from all weapons and gadgets, the first without working doors, the first without an in-game map, and the first without gimping.  Great way to ""return to the roots"".  As far as leveling and unlocks...it has to be only cosmetic or something like a rank armpatch.  Affecting gameplay with unlocks and leveling is such a big no-no for any shooter trying to claim to be tactical that I don't even think the devs of this game are that idiotic...well...given what I mentioned above I guess I won't be surprised."

Rainbow6,38xpw7,El_Cynic,6,Sun Jun 7 19:04:29 2015 UTC,Comes down to how balanced it is and whether or not it fills a niche. Attempt to do what CS:GO has already done and folk will just play CS:GO.  Studio support never hurts.
Rainbow6,38xpw7,NoDebate,1 point,Mon Jun 8 01:18:40 2015 UTC,"In terms of weapons yeah some balance would be great, but don't break the bank on it.  In terms of maps there should be an obvious advantage for one side or the other.  Preferably would be having the ""kidnappers"" have the advantage.  Socom2 had a bunch of levels that were dreadful if you were on the wrong side, but that made a victory that much better.  Besides this is what competitive is built on.  In a war it goes:  Clan one picks map and side with advantage them.  Clan two picks map and side with advantage them. Then tiebreaker with no real advantage.    I also disagree with the CS:GO comment, I believe that only would hold true to PC gamers.  To tell you the truth console games have been waiting for something decent for a really long time, so even if they recreated CS:GO with some tweaks it would still do well.   Either way making sure it has a severe learning curve would be beneficial for all.  Then creating a system so those of similar skill play with others of similar skill.  This would alleviate as much need for hand holding."
Rainbow6,38xpw7,MRMYSTICIGR,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:19:33 2015 UTC,"I think he was referring to weapon/attachment balance, not team or map balance. As long as the games are symmetrical then it doesn't normally matter that often if a map is 1sided, but an overpowered weapon or unlock (especially one that not everyone can get) can ruin a game."
Rainbow6,38xpw7,SlayerOfCupcakes,4,Wed Jun 10 08:57:09 2015 UTC,"Wow, hard to predict imo. Sure, if Ubisoft pays for big tournaments, there will be teams competing.

UBI doesn't get a consistent dedicated R6 following because after the first 3 games they just slapped the R6 name on whatever new direction they wanted to go with the game.

Rainbow6,38xpw7,hapes,-1,Mon Jun 8 07:50:21 2015 UTC,"BF3 has been the best Battlefield game I've played. BF4 was released and had so many problems. They took 6 months to release private servers (so we couldn't even play competitively for a long time) and each patch they released had a game breaking bug.   Then DICE realized they f'd up and started the ""CTE"" which tested different patches, trying to find the best version. They released it for console 2 months ago which is a month after they released Battlefield Hardline. Hardline released their private servers before BF4 got their save all patch."

Rainbow6,38s4ul,twinspectregaming,2,Sat Jun 6 13:02:53 2015 UTC,"Season Pass info is almost never revealed in advance for any game as it's all subject to change. In a typical FPS game you can safely expect staggered releases of new maps, but what those maps will be, how many or how often or if there will be anything besides maps is usually not revealed in advance. That's what I don't like about the Season Pass model. Your being asked to give develooers a payday advance, but until you get it, you have no idea what you're paying for."
Rainbow6,38s4ul,iceycat,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:15:22 2015 UTC,"So, a season pass is not like a premium service, e.g. the one that Battlefield titles (3 & 4) offer?"
Rainbow6,38s4ul,iceycat,1 point,Sat Jun 6 19:29:52 2015 UTC,"A season pass is usually just a bundled collection of DLC that you pay for up front and is dispersed over time in installments. If each installment were purchases individually it would be more money than if you purchased the season pass at a discounted price. Example: Call of Duty has four map packs, each map pack is $15 and one is released every 2-3 months. If you buy the season pass first for $50 you'll save $10 as opposed to buying each map pack separately. This is how most season pass content works. I didn't play Battlefield 4 so I don't know if they did anything different with theirs."

Also the lack of 3rd party dedicated servers would make it a no go as well.    I don't think it would split the community as most of the community that would play the ""Classic"" mode probably won't be playing Siege in its current design anyways.  Having options to play different ways is always a good thing.  That alone doesn't split the community it only makes the community bigger.  What does split the community is mandatory DLC.  I quit playing BF4 because of this.  What I mean by mandatory DLC is that if a server was running even one map that was part of a DLC pack you could not join that server unless you owned the DLC even when it was set on a default map.  With each DLC released the number of viable servers dwindled.  You essentially had to buy every DLC pack just to have a decent set of servers to choose from.  In BF2 you could join any server regardless but if the server switched to a map from one of the expansions and you didn't own it would just kick you from the server.  You could play the vanilla maps in any server."

The problem with Siege's HB Sensor, is the devs threw out everything they already figured out back in Ravenshield with how to balance it and started from scratch.  With RvS, anyone could take false HB pucks, a stationary jammer, or a hand held jammer to counter it.  Even though everyone in RvS could take a HB Sensor, they didn't because it was well balanced and there were other things you would want to carry with equal importance.

It allows players to focus on the game and on the task at hand, rather then having to be extra careful not to shoot a teammate or adding the frustration of confusing an enemy with a teammate."

Rainbow6,38jtw5,iceycat,2,Thu Jun 4 20:33:34 2015 UTC,"I like that they kept the CTU vs CTU like all previous R6 games did for multiplayer, because both teams should be allowed to be equal in Multiplayer.  However, unlike every previous R6 game they now restrict Offense and Defense to choosing from just certain weapons and gadgets that the other side doesn't get.  This is one of the biggest failures in Siege and removed the depth you got from all of the options both sides had in previous R6 games.  Very bad...but then we are stuck stuck with this Operator system limiting the best weapons and gadgets to one player that clicks on their choice before anyone else grabs it...so things just went from bad to worse."

Rainbow6,38jj2o,iceycat,6,Thu Jun 4 17:16:58 2015 UTC,"Nice and well thought out...but it could have all been summarized as:  DO IT LIKE RAVENSHIELD AND QUIT TRYING TO RE-INVENT THE WHEEL FROM SCRATCH!!!  Sorry to yell, but the devs claimed to have played the previous R6 games but then dropped everything other than one life and small maps.  I know you pointed out a couple things about the Ravenshield HB Sensor, but to be complete:  HB Sensor in RvS took longer to come out/put back and restricted vision.  It could be countered by False HB Pucks, as well as a stationary jammer and portable hand held jammer you could take out at the expense of not holding your weapon.  I do not agree with your comments that it needs to restrict you from moving fast, since if it restricts vision you will just be bumping into walls.   I also do not agree with limiting counter measures to one person on the other team.  These types of restrictions are USELESS and I hate everything about the Operator restrictions and this is a perfect example why.  What is wrong with multiple people taking a jammer?  It just means they are at a disadvantage by not taking other items, but at the advantage of defeating the HB Sensor at multiple locations and not just where a single operative happens to be.  What is wrong with that???  All this Operative Limit does is remove the depth you had in all the previous R6 games where everyone could take anything they wanted.  AND NO, In previous R6 games we NEVER had everyone running around with one item just because you could.  WHY???  Because the items were BALANCED and didn't have to be artificially restricted to ONE PERSON due to lazy game balancing."
Rainbow6,38jj2o,Pest_AWC,6,Thu Jun 4 19:55:46 2015 UTC,"No worries Pest. You make a good point regarding the vision ans movement. I too wish operatives weren't locked to predefined loadouts, it's clearly something that is too core of a mechanic to what they're doing though and it isn't going to change. I'll keep lobbying for at least getting them to open up the weapons being predefined, but I think we're stuck with the gadgets being locked."

Thanks for fighting the good fight though.  I would love an open debate on these subjects with the Devs but I'm afraid most of them want what we want as well but can't speak against their boss.

Rainbow6,38jj2o,jonowee,1 point,Fri Jun 5 02:53:36 2015 UTC,"But Pest, Raven Shield did reinvent the wheel, for the better. The HBS was broken in Rogue Spear because like Siege the mini-map gave you instant wallhack IFF markers like the friendly outlines in Siege that now is in 3D space. Problem now is Ubisoft idea of ""fixing"" the HBS visual interface is to make it easier and easier to range and track targets. Besides nerfing its range, every iteration has been added visual elements to aid scaling the range with multiple pulse rings to now a fixed size blood core [facepalm].  http://i.imgur.com/OU8b9Ef.png  In Raven Shield:   Your peripheral vision was blocked by the HBS goggle. The screen was clouded with static noise, the detected pulses were also staticy pulses. The blending of the static balances out some of its effectiveness. The pulses are a single ring that needs better user attention to figure out the range because if you did not wait and focus on one target you would not know whether it was the start or the end of the pulse which helps confuse a rangefinding. The big plus is that there are no IFF or objective markers that x-ray through walls, floated constantly without the user centering them. The hostage may have the more panicked faster pulse rate, but all operators on both teams shared the same pulse rate and you still had to comms your teammates before you ND them.   I'm letting the Operator experiment slide for Siege, it might work, it might be improved for future RS games, or it might be scrapped in the future. As iceycat mentioned the HBS has no cooldown, cannot be actively jammed or tricked, or have 'health' that could be permanently disabled with consumables like the Thatcher's only 2 short range EMP grenades. The only other operator whose gadget is non-consumable is Sledge's breaching hammer that requires him to faceplant surfaces to break through them, while Pulse has a silent ranged tool."

Or everybody would have heavy armor and could only use the CZ submachine gun.  The damage was so low for that gun that body shots just made your guy flinch and the only way to kill someone was headshots.  Good times, but sadly those days are gone.    I wish more developers would see the value in having options like that.  Was that something I played a lot of? Nope.  Was it something that I played even a majority of the time? Nope.

I think by E3 what we'll see will be pretty close to final, so it'll be interesting to see."
Rainbow6,385avo,Dan_Biddle,5,Tue Jun 2 02:00:59 2015 UTC,I have a feeling unless they are going to delay the game to 2016 then the features that many are crying out to be added/removed will not be and this game will go down the fast paced with very little strategy route. Sure they'll have a demo on stage where everyone is playing as a team all tactical and stealthy but this is not how the game plays out in real life and the alpha showed this.
Rainbow6,385avo,Harvey_Dole,7,Tue Jun 2 11:09:51 2015 UTC,"We could not play with our friends in the alpha version. In the real version, if you and your friends play tactical and stealthy the game could be awesome."
Rainbow6,385avo,Pest_AWC,0,Tue Jun 2 14:24:45 2015 UTC,"To play tactically and stealthy we need teams to wear different uniforms, and working doors.    This game had a better shot if they ditched the Rainbow Six name since it won't appeal to the fans of the series that want a Rainbow Six experience.  The lack of working doors and distinct team uniforms is just the beginning...they need to get rid of the magical white outlines of team mates seen through walls, add fire select, add real magazine management instead of magical ammo pools, get rid of insta-grenade throwing, add gimping when hit, and get rid of the Operator system so that we can choose from all weapons and gadgets like in every past R6 game."
Rainbow6,385avo,BBLover18,3,Wed Jun 3 13:46:33 2015 UTC,"I think some of that will still come to be. I think doors are just not going to happen which is a real shame though. Operators are here to stay, but we might see some tweaking still. I'm going to continue to lobby for open weapon and armor selections as opposed to locked load outs, we'll see if there's any traction to be gained there over the next several months or not. Much of that other stuff is either probable or at least possible."

As a fan of the original 3 Rainbow Six games, Siege doesn't work for me because it is a dumbed down and unrealistic shooter.  If I want that, I'll go play COD.  Siege is missing working doors, fire-select, real magazine management, and gimping.  It has lots of HUD clutter with points awarded and magical white outlines of teammates and exaggerated destruction from bullets hitting walls.  If those things appeal to you, then by all means buy Siege."

Seriously, the small tweaks they are making, like Hit Markers, were ones they planned all along and they admit it in interviews.  They also admitted to having jacked up bullet count just to test stuff in Alpha.  We didn't make a difference.  They proved we don't make a difference by:   Keeping in the lame pre-set Operatives instead of allowing us back the control to pick from all weapons and gadgets like all previous R6 games. Not having WORKING DOORS in the game like all previous R6 games did and most other CQB games like even BF Hardline does. Not having GIMPING and instead not having any movement/accuracy penalty for being shot at all, other than death (and even that can be cheated with their version of Last Stand). Keeping the player count set at 5 VS 5 with single objectives instead of more depth of 8 VS 8 with two objectives like all previous R6 games. Simplifying guns to not having FIRE SELECT and simplifying CLIP MANAGEMENT to magical ammo pools instead of real clips. Not having an in-game map to plan on and also reference mid-game Not having teams with uniforms you can tell apart, and instead having magical white outlines of friendlies appearing through walls (formerly called a wall-hack in other games and people would get banned for doing it).   They have just been acting like they are listening and feeding us the BS about making a difference.  If they really cared what we thought, they would have asked questions MUCH earlier in the development process and not created a game with major flaws permanently embedded in its DNA that do not follow past Rainbow Six games, and definitely get farther away from the original 3 than anyone wanted.

A lot of your points are completely out there and have no place in this game. Decisions are taken for a reason, a high level reason. A reason you're completely in the dark about and have no understanding of. Something like adding doors to this game, when they have likely already tried it and measure the pros/cons, is something you will NEVER be privy to, in any game. Devs dont just say ""OH, yeah, fuck doors we dont need them"". Theres a process.  Please dont act like you know how to fix the game because from every point you made you're not fixing, you're adding features you think would be good ""for you"".

A lot of people don't seem to understand that. It's literally like fashion, it's cyclical. I would never expect them to try to replicate something that worked in the nineties for today's audience, it would flop. That's what's frustrating with all these posts. So many of you want a throw back but at what expense? The project flops to meet your standards? That's extremely selfish and naive. There are think tanks throughout the development process with players of all types to get generalized feedback. With every.single.project.ever."
Rainbow6,381i00,Phi03,5,Mon Jun 1 16:21:39 2015 UTC,"I could not disagree more that replicating something that worked in the 90's would flop.  The Socom community has been asking for this for many years.  I was really excited about R6 Siege, so I started reading the reddit and understanding what consensus was for people awaiting this game.  The last Rainbow I played was Vegas 2, however I used to play the original cpu Rainbow games as well.  I loved them and often kept going back to them.    Anyway what I found surprised me.  A lot of the concerns with the game mirrored discussions that I have read for years in Socom forums.  It seems that no matter what the things that made those games amazing has yet to be recaptured.  So for all of the diehard R6 players I feel your pain.  Back to my point that replicating actually would be successful, I would like you to look up the kickstarter for H-Hour.  It is a Socom spiritual successor, that since the main studios would not do it an indie studio was created to complete the task.  Under the direction of David Sears the original Creative Director of Socom1 and 2.  It was the most successful kickstarter project of its kind reaching stretch goal after stretch goal.  Currently this project is in early release for steam, console (ps4) will follow upon success on PC.  This game broke tons of records for kickstarter/ steam green light, and general support in such a short time.  The only reason that this game had issues getting out the door was that investors were weary to go all in.  Regardless of the thousands of people fully supporting and raising over $240,000.  There was a market for a real tactical shooter that is round based one life.    The good news is that Ubisoft is willing to take that chance, I know it won't be exactly what people are looking for, but with sufficient support games with that old school magic could be taken more seriously, and we could see more of them.  I just wish more studios understood that instead of trying to tap into Cod, or Battlefield money, there is a large basis of gamers not even currently on anyone's radar.  The old school tactical gamers that stopped playing and buying games after they were botched in attempts to be better for the casual gamer.  I actually have countless socom friends from back in the day that refuse to buy anything until it gives them some of that old feeling.  Games with strong learning curve should be encouraged anyway, because these soft core cookie cutter garbage games that encourage people to not value their decisions and cater to the impatient are actually damaging society.  Giving validation for mundane tasks is hugely responsible for the state of society and its inability to function without acknowledgment.    A real life example is a game like foosball.  Yeah anyone can play it but when you play someone that is years practiced and have honed their craft you have no chance.  That is honestly exactly how this game should be.  Then to make everyone still want to play it, utilize a player skill or clan skill matching system that allows you to play those within your skill level.  Instead of catering to the casual gamer to make them more successful overall, just make them play others like themselves.

Rainbow6,381i00,wrel_,-3,Mon Jun 1 17:21:47 2015 UTC,"I appreciate everything you're saying and it's nice to see a real fan and not some teenage rage head that raises a pitchfork for every little thing.   I get you, I'm from the old tactical game era as well. I did not pay a ton of the old rainbow six but I am definitely familiar and an extremely competitive, tactical player. This game has that, it does. The potential is there. I agree with certain things not being the exactly hardcore, the guns seem a little spammy, but the rest is a solid platform.   I compare the start this to LoL. Everyone got on that game and didn't know what the hell was going on. The game evolved. It patched frequently, which it looks like this game will do, and addressed major issues while growing.   If you have problems with doors not being in the game now and it is game breaking, fine. If that's where you want to focus your energy then I believe you're fighting an uphill battle. However if you think doors will never be there you're delusional.   Everything comes in time and anyone who labels developers as ""not listening"" to the fans, before it is even out, is a joke. Games are patched and fixed after they are released. Not before. People should be honored a billion dollar company even listens. In what other industry do you get this kind of back and forth with core members? Developers didnt care to listen to me or the public when I was a teenager. But not times and production methods have changed and people raise their pitchforks for every little thing instead of letting a game grow and evolve."

But here's the thing:  I want the series to grow because the developers found a new way to make a Rainbow Six game even better.  Everything I've seen so far show they haven't done that, and rather they let Rainbow Six become influenced by other games to create a weird bastardization of a game that neither party wants.  Problem is that games now are green-lighted based on prospective sales numbers.  Even 10 years ago, the gaming market wasn't the sales-driven monster is became sometimes around the PS3/X360 days.  Companies put money into games expecting a certain monetary return or they don't want to waste their time.  It's a sad state of affairs, but it's why we get annual sequels to games like Assassin's Creed or Call of Duty; because those games will sell enough units to make their investment worth it.  That's why devs takes a niche franchise and try and spice it up by adding things they think will attract the Call of Duty / Battlefield fans; to get them to say ""Hey I should check out this new game Rainbow Six Siege"" to drive sales.  But the problem when they do that is that they make a game that's 'too much like Call of Duty' to a Rainbow Six fan, and a game that's 'not Call of Duty enough' to a Call of Duty fan.  Both parties are disinterested in it because it's not what they want.  Look at Rainbow Six Lockdown, the first RS game released in a post-CoD world.  It's mediocre across the board, Clancy fans were annoyed with what it became, CoD fans mostly ignored the game, and it's regularly referred to as 'Rainbow Six Letdown' because of how it couldn't establish any sort of identity for itself.  That's the direction we can already see Siege headed in, and it's frustrating as a fan to watch it happen.  We're going to get yet another game that RS fans and CoD/BF fans won't like, won't sell well because people don't like it, and Ubi will look at sales numbers and say ""Seems no one likes Rainbow Six games, lets stop making them for another five years"" and we're right back to where we were before; turning to independent kickstart companies to make specific games for niche communities because Ubi can't make an internal sales pitch that a tactical shooter will make them $20 million and that's all the are in the industry for."

Rainbow6,37w7gq,forzaitalia458,7,Fri Jun 5 22:50:36 2015 UTC,"I want to point out that besides the custom options, dedicated servers allow games to live longer shelf life. There comes a point when the player base gets so low that the company doesn't see a purpose in keeping the servers running as it costs money. Dedicated servers allow the people to still keep the game alive and host their own server.   Just look at quake 2 and you can still find servers thanks to dedicated servers. And you can still have dedicated servers and implement and matchmaking system. Tf2 has matchmaking and server browser."
Rainbow6,37w7gq,missch4nandlerbong,2,Sun May 31 00:21:45 2015 UTC,This 100%. Being able to join a particular server and find the same group of people over time means that a community develops and grows. Games without dedicated servers just don't have a community and they die after a few years.
Rainbow6,37w7gq,mk28,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:14:52 2015 UTC,That makes sense. I wonder if it would be likely for player hosted servers to be enabled when the game goes out of business.
Rainbow6,37w7gq,vuduhx,5,Sun May 31 10:22:52 2015 UTC,"You're confusing what things are. You're talking about matchmaking vs server browser. The thing with wanting dedicated servers is to have them instead of P2P, it's about the hosting method, not the joining method. Dedicated servers are just factually better quality than using one of the players internet in the match.   People want to be able to have their own servers they pay for, where they set up the rules, that makes perfect sense for FPS games and server browsers are necessary for this type of game. It never needs to be matchmaking vs server browser, there can be both. In games like MOBA's, or games where a match has to gather all the players before it starts, matchmaking makes sense, but in games where you can join mid-match, server browsers are the best. And even though the ""competitive"" modes in this game are going to try to be the ""gather players before hand"" type of thing, it's a shooter, and so there should be unranked options where you're free to join or leave, etc."
Rainbow6,37w7gq,vuduhx,1 point,Sun May 31 00:56:04 2015 UTC,"I should have specified that I was talking about player hosted dedicated servers, since Ubisoft already confirmed, that the game will run on dedicated servers and not peer-to-peer. So rule customization is the big point for player hosted servers here?"
Rainbow6,37w7gq,tyhopkin,4,Sun May 31 10:22:03 2015 UTC,"It is largely about control. Tournaments, players, teams, etc all prefer control of their play environment. This is so very important in FPSes because ping and packet loss are massively more important than in MOBAs. Think about how annoying it is to lag in LoL or DOTA2 and how it can ruin a fight. Now picture that same lag where the game needs to transfer even more information and that lag can lose you the round in an instant.   The other major factor is that FPS tournaments and leagues do not get played the same way that a MOBA does. Different tournaments  might ban an OP item or operator. They might also change the round timer, round limit, or any number of other things that they would like. They might also develop and run a pro-mod that changes how the game plays.  The second set of things can technically be done without third-party hosted servers (except for a pro-mod), the first set cannot. There is no way to know with 100% certainty when lag will happen with a server, but with third-party servers, you can easily move to another server. With just Ubisoft servers, you are stuck."
Rainbow6,37w7gq,FlanjeUK,0,Sat May 30 23:35:56 2015 UTC,"So basically, if the official servers would be incredibly stable (which they will probably not be, but in theory), the first point would be irrelevant?"
Rainbow6,37w7gq,FlanjeUK,2,Sun May 31 10:24:25 2015 UTC,Yeah. Theoretically official servers can technically do anything third-party servers can including mod support but they never do. It requires a ton of developmental costs for little gain from the dev perspective but it is worth the cost and effort from the player/team/organizer perspective.
Rainbow6,37w7gq,RealityKing4Hire,4,Sun May 31 12:03:18 2015 UTC,Dedicated servers have nothing to do with matchmaking or a server browser. It is about having the best online experience. This is not possible without dedicated servers that players connect to.  However you can have matchmaking AND server browsers. Most PC FPS games support both.

Rainbow6,37yljn,mau5eum,2,Tue Jun 2 20:54:41 2015 UTC,"They haven't given us any info on anti-cheat so far. That's why there's not much to discuss.   I read the EULA on steam and it did indicate that the game will scan for third party programs/cheats.   http://store.steampowered.com//eula/359550_eula_1  The game will focus heavily on MP, if cheaters run rampant and no server admins, the game will die quickly. I'm sure they have something cooking."
Rainbow6,37yljn,Deosl,2,Sun May 31 14:39:16 2015 UTC,"They have 5 options:  1) FairFight - Which is a joke and probably wouldn't work for this type of game where there isn't a lot of repetitiveness during a round.   2) Their own in-house anti-cheat - Many devs have tried this it never works.  Personally I just think this is PR speak for we aren't really doing anything but we'll try to contain it the best we can after relelase.  3) VAC - highly unlikely as I don't know of any UBI games that has utilized VAC before and I also don't know of any non-SteamWorks games that supports VAC.  Just a little preemptive response, Steam /= Steamworks.  4) Punkbuster - Possible considering every R6 game since RvS has included it.  However, if they were to implement it for Siege it would be more or less useless and a waste of time.  Without proper 3rd party dedicated servers PsB doesn't do much.  I'll explain why.  PsB does not typically ban players to its Global Ban List.  It will if the hack that is detected is actually trying to mess with and interfere with PsB itself.  Otherwise it just flags a detected cheat and who the player is.  Whether or not he gets kicked or banned would be up to a server admin, but that player could easily just go into another server and play until PsB detects the hack.  The real power of PsB is the ability to ""stream"" PsB server logs to a place like PBBans.  This essentially allows for any server doing so to ""share"" banlists.  A place like PBBans also creates their own hack checks in addition to what Evenbalance does.  When ""streaming"" the updates are automated so the admin doesn't really have to do anything.  PsB was implemented very well for RvS because of the dedicated server abilities.  With Lockdown, Vegas, and Vegas 2 it was useless and a waste of time.  Also a proper implementation of PsB and dedicated servers allow for additional server admin possibilities.   5) Do nothing - Which is pretty similar to #2."

The net agreement was that the best way to control cheating is server moderation/administration, despite whatever anti-cheat program is available (Cheaters will find hacks to beat whatever program you have, this applies to all games.)   That's the way we controlled cheaters back in the day, take screenshots etc. and report them to your ladder leaders (or in the general case for siege, ubisoft admins etc.) So including observation tools built in would help a lot."

Rainbow6,37ugg8,JamesBigglesworth,1 point,Sun May 31 07:43:31 2015 UTC,"I'm a little worried after they said they're making aiming harder on pc compared to consoles (and the alpha) due to better accuracy with kb+m.   I'm a diehard controller fan, and always play my pc fps games with an xbox 360 controller. I know, i know, kb+m is better, and I'm a stubborn peasant for keeping my controller. But I genuinely enjoy playing fps better on controller, and I'm an adult and can do what i want, gosh darn it!   I'm wondering if there are any considerations for tweaking aiming for those of us who enjoy pc controllers, for example witcher 3 can detect when a controller is bring used and adjusts aiming settings, etc. based on input.   Anything like that in the works for R6|Siege?"
Rainbow6,37ugg8,forzaitalia458,2,Sun May 31 03:15:46 2015 UTC,"Aim is not going to be harder. The recoil will be, means you need to control your gun more. I guess recoil can mess your aim up, but making aim harder to me means them messing the way the game controls the input of the mouse"
Rainbow6,37ugg8,JamesBigglesworth,1 point,Sun May 31 13:38:49 2015 UTC,"That's a good distinction to make, and the recoil is what i was referring to. I definitely think aiming is harder with increased recoil, and recoil is a lot easier to handle on a mouse than it is a controller.   I don't want auto aim or anything like that turned on for those of us who use controllers, but if they increased recoil for the k&m people to compensate for easier handling with a mouse, they might consider making some type of equally compensatory mechanism for those using other popular input methods, so we don't suffer in recoil agony needlessly."

Rainbow6,37ui0y,sonoblink,1 point,Sat May 30 15:09:16 2015 UTC,What are the big gameplay differences between Raven Shield and Vegas 2?
Rainbow6,37ui0y,iceycat,2,Sat May 30 17:31:53 2015 UTC,"Speed of play was the biggest, you could go faster in Vegas, not necessarily due to movement speed but because your health was way more forgiving and the cover system allowed you to reel in suicide chargers. RvS was less fire giving, it was far more ""lethal"" so you had to take it slow and steady. It was all about strategy and tactics, Vegas was less so. RvS also had levels that were very sandbox, you could clear a map with LOTS of different paths, Vegas had pretty linear paths for level progression. Vegas had a cool rappelling mechanic that was new to the series as well as fast roping and helo insertions which were cool. By the time I finished Vegas though I swore if I never had to see even one more damn blinky slot machine for the rest of my life, then that would have been just fine with me. Seriously the whole casino theme is in like every single map in Vegas, it was SO annoying."
Rainbow6,37ui0y,sonoblink,-2,Sat May 30 17:50:47 2015 UTC,Vegas weapons were just as lethal as ravens the main difference vegas1/2 were designed for pvp rather than coop.
Rainbow6,37ui0y,iceycat,1 point,Sat May 30 18:18:01 2015 UTC,"Using the weapons against enemies, yes. The incoming fire was not as lethal though, you could take more hits. In RvS you were dead after 2 hits, maybe 3 if they were all limb strikes and if they get a head shot on you all it took was one. When Rainbow came to consoles they were far more forgiving on health."
Rainbow6,37ui0y,sonoblink,1 point,Sat May 30 21:18:15 2015 UTC,"Vegas2 pc 1 headshot=kill or depending on your weapon it was 3-5 body shots for the kill which is very similar to ravens,fuksake were splitting hairs on this one)  Console was an even more watered down version"

I'm not biased like a lot of the twats on here every game in a series is new,each dev team try's improve from one to another and adopt elements its an ever evolving new creation through the series this is the way of things but some don't get it anyways cheers & hav a nice day)"

My recommendation is to not only do single player but also go into multiplayer and do some coop terrorist hunt, even if you can't find anyone to play coop with you can still lsunch the multiplayer missions solo. There are many great multiplayer maps that you won't find in the single player campaign.  One of my favorites is Warehouse. Also modes like hostage rescue and bomb defusal in multiplayer against enemy bots is quite fun as well."

Rainbow6,37klf8,lrgame1983,4,Thu May 28 11:06:56 2015 UTC,"Maybe I ask what you liked about Lockdown? Didn't you feel it was a (major) step down from Raven Shield?

Grenade launchers No planning phase Class system 4 player coop Hero character (you die, game over) Corn rows (initially the operators didn't have helmets all. The community reacted heavily and they added helmets.)   ++++  I highly doubt you'll find anyone playing this online... Maybe some poor POW in North Korea being forced to play it.  Lockdown was released on consoles first, and later on PC. It's just a bad R6 title that was developed for consoles. It was a huge dissapointement after the great Raven Shield. This was when Ubisoft shifted all developement to consoles and PC became an afterthought.  Lockdown and Vegas 2 are the only R6 games I haven't completed the SP campaign..."
Rainbow6,37klf8,jonowee,1 point,Thu May 28 11:33:42 2015 UTC,"""Non-linear maps (basically a corridor shooter)"" <- yea ok I agree, I just installed it and blasted through the first couple of levels, the AI is VERY easy, I got hit once without paying any attention and without knowing the level layout so yes, level design and AI seem to lack. Also I agree it's a step down from RVS, RVSCC is still being played a lot at home on LAN parties. It's sort of a definitive multiplayer version of RVS without any cdkey protection/validation and or cd/dvd checks, combines all 3 RVS parts together in one large game, including all the weapons which is very nice! (if you like: http://www.techknow.me/forum/index.php?topic=9196.0) And I do not see Lockdown being that epic compared to RVS, you know what, I'll give the other levels a go tonight because I really want to give it a chance, you are right on a couple of points (far as I've seen) but it went pretty nice , I expected something way worse maybe. I haven't even played Vegas but do read good stuff about it! I've found out that I do not own Vegas 2 for pc where I have 5 versions legally/physical of part 1, I must have missed the sales or perhaps it didn't got a physical release, I buy Rainbow6 games even if I just see one change of the cover LOL. Which BTW brings me to Lockdown 1.02, I bought a re-re-release of Lockdown. That version, assuming it has the 1.01 patch on the disc, is actually 1.02! You know, Lockdown 1.02 has NO STARFORCE, and NO CDKEY checks, odd isn't it? I am not complaining LOL! I've read that checks are removed due problems with starforce on win7, makes sense. Also, you can NOT download v1.02 of Lockdown, just 1.01, now THAT's odd but you know probably why? v1.02 is a TEST build of the exe, well I'm lost what happened but I'm loving it all."

Whereas Raven Shield since we have server files, there are privately hosted servers still around.  I unlocked all the singleplayer levels by tweaking an .ini file and playing Lockdown roulette. Sure if I can't resupply or swap weapons and my AI teammates always use full auto, at least draw a scale legend on the not-a-planning map so I understand the size of the map without having to ghost through it. Because it was corridor A, corridor B shooter, and you only had one bloody fireteam, flanking options were near moot."

The Division looks like a visual/ engineering achievement, but I have reservations about its story and characters. From what's been shown thus far, it looks like the ""enemies"" are just stranded, desperate Americans' looking to survive a man-made crisis. That doesn't sit right with me! It looks like the typical ""your government must kill for the greater good"" kind of story, in the same vein of 28 Weeks Later, I Am Legend, etc. We'll have to see.  I think Ubisoft is positioning The Division to replace Ghost Recon as its frontline third-person shooter.

Rainbow6,37htwn,Strikerrr0,8,Wed May 27 19:12:07 2015 UTC,"We need a complete list of firearms (or at least what they're planning) so we can start giving feedback.... some of the gun choices in alpha were disappointing. e.g. Why was the 416 left out but the 417 included? That makes no sense. They ignored the best carbine in the world, but included an average DMR from the same HK series!  p.s. We also need confirmation regarding the fire-selector switch already! It's starting to scare me that they haven't confirmed this yet..."
Rainbow6,37htwn,GHOST-117,6,Wed May 27 20:16:42 2015 UTC,"416-C is coming. Checked with Andrew Witts, game designer with a focus on the firearms, and he said we wanted a DMR in the Closed Alpha to test out single fire, which is why the 417 was there.   We'll release a full weapons list as soon as we can, but just a heads up this isn't going to be an area where there will be a lot of room for feedback."
Rainbow6,37htwn,electr1cpanda,3,Thu May 28 15:48:49 2015 UTC,"Hmm, so the 417 was to test single-fire.... But what's the verdict then on Single-Fire Mode for Carbines/SMGs? Please confirm this as soon as possible."
Rainbow6,37htwn,GHOST-117,2,Thu May 28 15:58:24 2015 UTC,What /u/GHOST-117 said.  Will there be the ability to change ROF on weapons that are capable?
Rainbow6,37htwn,tyhopkin,4,Fri May 29 15:22:07 2015 UTC,"I think their main consultant was a GIGN guy and they use the 417 as a DMR. https://40.media.tumblr.com/38da1ad918823d58ba00a8793794dc3d/tumblr_nl2iiw8u1d1s9dq93o1_1280.jpg  https://36.media.tumblr.com/89d43ab9f793bf73a00e10c4dc42cd72/tumblr_nl2iiw8u1d1s9dq93o2_1280.jpg  I would still like to see the 416 or C8 as a carbine, but it appears than the Remington R4 is the AR-15 representative of the game. Probably a co-marketing deal that's been in place since Future Soldier. CoD MW3 and Ghosts did something similar."
Rainbow6,37htwn,GHOST-117,2,Wed May 27 20:58:11 2015 UTC,Ohh rite! now it makes sense (kinda)... But still they need to correct these choices.  ++ I'm still waiting on fire-selector-switch confirmation
Rainbow6,37htwn,tyhopkin,2,Wed May 27 21:02:55 2015 UTC,p.s. We also need confirmation regarding the fire-selector switch already! It's starting to scare me that they haven't confirmed this yet...   It may mean little but based on the key bindings from the alpha I don't think they plan to include it.  Usually the fire selector key is close to the WASD area by default and all the close buttons were used up.

Originally I wasn't going to post these here after making the initial announcement of the series as I didn't want to come across as spammy or inappropriate given my moderator status. However after having received the encouragement and support of the Rainbow Six reddit administrators to do so, I will.  Today's topical is interesting in that there are people who feel very passionately for as well as against the types of movement exploits that are talked about. Wherever you fall on the spectrum though, just remember good reddiquette and to respect opinions that you may not agree with. (reposted since the link was wrong originally)"

Rainbow6,37iw0k,geofurb,1 point,Fri Jun 5 15:29:23 2015 UTC,"There's no prone stance in Siege. Was one announced? Agreed that ""drop-shotting"" is a crummy mechanic. Making people go to crouch first isn't gonna fix things, it'd just get in the way. That said, I don't think prone is expected.  As far as bob and weave affecting accuracy, they're already cutting the side-to-side movement speed, and moving kills accuracy when shooting from the hip. Making moving shake the camera when ADS might be realistic, but I think it'd be a bit nauseating. The side-to-side movement reduction should hopefully keep bob and weave from providing such a big advantage, but it's not a total cure. I think that last bit you're just gonna have to leave in."
Rainbow6,37iw0k,geofurb,2,Thu May 28 01:27:17 2015 UTC,"I have to admit, I did not have access to the closed Alpha myself so I don;t have the benefit of first hand play. That said, I did however watch as many live streams and videos of the Alpha game play. I have seen many  instances of prone stance. I've watched drop shotting and strafe dancing so I know they're in there. I'll point you to this review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF6mCWs11Yk  Here's an example of strafe dance shooting with pretty much no penalty to accuracy and side to side movement at full speed at 26:08  He talks about strafing mechanics at 6:18, and 22:38 as well.  Drop shotting is mentioned specifically at 11:13  Throughout the video you can see operators get down on their bellies in the full prone position, though he doesn't show on screen any actual drop shotting in a firefight. Even though it's not on this video, I have seen drop shotting on others.  I do acknowledge that now they have changed movement speeds and slowed things down. That's good and we'll have to see how that all balances now. until we play the beta, we have really don't know. Hip fire accuracy was handled, but ADS seems to have little to no accuracy penalties while moving, even at full speeds. Again I don;t have the benefit of first hand play with the game yet, I'm merely compiling what I've seen and heard others say they experienced during their time with it."
Rainbow6,37iw0k,TheRealCochise,1 point,Thu May 28 03:32:57 2015 UTC,"The reduction to side-to-side speed was after alpha. It's a note they gave us when they announced removal of hitmarkers. It's been a month since alpha, so I must've forgotten about prone stance. If that's the case, yeah, definitely make it take a second to bring your sights up.  To give ADS penalty, you'd have to add a lot of head bob when the player walks with ADS; the game's input-driven, so your gun fires from where your view is pointed."

Rainbow6,37d45g,shaqamack,4,Tue May 26 19:22:01 2015 UTC,Each operator has a choice of two primaries and two secondaries from what I can tell. For each operator to only be able to choose between one of two weapons seems horribly limited to me. I hope they wind up reconsidering. As far as modifications there isn't any information at this time. The closed alpha only had iron sights with no attachments. Some post E3 gameplay examples from last summer seemed to show some weapon sights like the ACOG. No word if this was removed entirely or just unavailable for the alpha only.
Rainbow6,37d45g,iceycat,3,Tue May 26 20:15:50 2015 UTC,"Yea the customization was severely limited during the Alpha, but I am hoping it was a product of it being just an Alpha and not game design.    I'm actually pretty worried that we will not get fire selection (e.g. semi, burst, auto) based on the default key bindings."
Rainbow6,37d45g,tyhopkin,1 point,Tue May 26 22:33:57 2015 UTC,"I've noticed the trend in CoD and some other games is to lock you into a specific fire selection for a gun. In CoD Ghosts the ARX-160 was a fully automatic AR, in Advanced Warfare the ARX-160 was locked to a 3 round burst only. One thing that Ghosts did that wasn't too bad of a compromise was that SOME guns allowed you to take a fire selector modification to change between single shot, burst or automatic. This however took up one of the two attachment slots. Other CoD titles tended to keep you locked to whatever they pre selected for you as a fire selector. To my knowledge none of them allowed you to switch between semi auto and auto which is just wrong."
Rainbow6,37d45g,iceycat,2,Tue May 26 23:37:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, and it's depressing, actually. Correct me if I'm wrong, but even the most recent Ghost Recon, which had arguably the best weapon customization, didn't let you change fire rates in game. There were different ""trigger"" selections, which let you have single, auto, burst, but it was unchangeable once in game. In R6: Vegas, I constantly changed between single and auto, and even burst, to engage targets at different ranges. It's a very useful tool, tactically."
Rainbow6,37d45g,ThisIsntCheese_,1 point,Wed May 27 14:57:42 2015 UTC,"I think you were able to switch if you had the fire select attachment. This is were I fell of CoD, when stupid things like that started happening."
Rainbow6,37d45g,ChernoAlpha_Mk1,0,Wed May 27 02:51:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly I find it okay, that means that you'll know just by checking at the operator list what type of weapon you can encounter, and precisely which weapon. Means if you see Pulse is alive, he probably has an auto shotgun, so no need to get too personal with him. It allows for counter play, which is nice, especially when the game looks like it's so competitive-oriented."
Rainbow6,37d45g,Djaquitchane,4,Wed May 27 09:12:23 2015 UTC,Where is the excitement in that? That's almost like cheating in my books. The best part of playing fps is the element of surprise. Catching people off gaurd. Switching up and using a gun they didn't expect.

Rainbow6,37d45g,Djaquitchane,2,Wed May 27 16:15:56 2015 UTC,In past rainbow six games there is a selection on rate of fire and RoE instead of all the time spray and hopefully I panic kill him it teaches precision and weapon choices do add that element of the unknown but instead of everyone having the one M16 or AA12 they all should perform to different standards. I agree on sights we should be able to experiment with different ones not to the extent of Bf4 but  a few combos maybe a canted iron sight with an acog but still be able to stack attachments I know i like a foregrip with a laser and suppressor instead of being limited to a holo and fmj when your weapon clearly has more rail room
Rainbow6,37awee,Maximal113,7,Tue May 26 07:24:15 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see the interface cleaner and less feedback to the user in regards to confirmed kills and players left. If they remove that, then the whole scoring/XP notifications has to be removed.  Is it tense when you get the big text with 2 vs 1 sure, But it ruins the immersion. It would be much tenser if you didn't really know how many were left and your mates have to tell you or you check the scoreboard. Then again, a scoreboard is not immersive, but at least it's not in your face and clutters the screen.  But in the end, it's not that big of a deal for me. If the gameplay is lethal enough, then the interface can be somewhat ""handholding friendly"". Will have to re-asses when playing the beta."
Rainbow6,37awee,Deosl,3,Tue May 26 07:42:46 2015 UTC,"I actually don't mind the big text notification that much. Yes, it's less immersive, but it gives an arena like feeling, which I find interesting. If I had the choice I'd probably root for no hud infos at all, except objective markers, just like in Insurgency, but that won't happen.  Overall I hope they tone down the hud much more, even if it just means a smaller and clearer font so it doesn't take up as much screen real estate as it did in the alpha.  What really bugs me are the threat/hit indicators. I think sound and bullet tracers are enough and if you don't have your back covered, you should be screwed anyway..."

Rainbow6,37awee,III2RUFFIII,6,Tue May 26 10:25:09 2015 UTC,I don't want to see a scoreboard until the end of the round.  It gives too much away.  I would rather think there were enemies around when they wasn't as it would make for a more realistic experience.
Rainbow6,37awee,torchedEARTH,3,Tue May 26 11:57:46 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. Insurgency is, in my opinion, one of the best examples of a tactical shooter that really did it right. Anything Siege does that will make it have that same feel will be for the better."
Rainbow6,37awee,-manny_calavera-,2,Wed May 27 09:50:32 2015 UTC,"I think the remaining player popups do create a meaningful sense of tension that have a place in the game, but I think they have the highest impact to spectators and not players. Players already know how many teammates are alive and should know how many enemies are alive through sufficient communication. Removing them from the gameplay hud and having them only in a spectator mode (hopefully there is one) encourages team communication to have constant gameplay information while still providing that source of tension for spectators who do not have all of the gameplay context the players have."

Rainbow6,378mxp,III2RUFFIII,5,Mon May 25 19:46:00 2015 UTC,"There's no need to make the hostage more central, that's the point people keep missing.  The hostage's purpose is to motivate tactical gameplay. In the present scenario it anchors the defenders to a point, while giving them some room to move about. It also makes the attackers refrain from carelessly fragging the defenders' fortified room. The point of the hostage is to shape the attack & defense gameplay, not to star in it."
Rainbow6,378mxp,geofurb,1 point,Tue May 26 00:11:42 2015 UTC,"I am not a fan of this idea. I want to see more incentives to go for the hostage instead then forcing the issue. Limiting the ability to fortify yourself, encouraging people to move the hostage because else they are sitting ducks, more points for the team who rescues a hostage rather then just shoots the enemy team and the ability for an unguarded hostage to just run are some of the things I can think of to make the mode more interesting without resorting to what is basicly a respawn mode in anything but name."
Rainbow6,378mxp,JonathanRL,1 point,Mon May 25 20:15:46 2015 UTC,Return to Castle Wolfenstein had the best multiplayer I've ever played. Are you talking about hostage escort to another part of the map? As in RTCW you had to take the documents to a radio/gold to a truck.
Rainbow6,378mxp,TheScreamingMonkey,1 point,Mon May 25 23:18:42 2015 UTC,"Yes that's exactly what I'm talking about. Keep moving the hostage toward a given area or multiple areas until the attackers run out of revives. Say each team only gets 5 revives and once those revives are used no one on your team can be revived anymore and the opposing team wins because they escape with the hostage. You can have tactical team play but keep the hostage moving and keep your focus on him/her. Just don't go around trying to kill the attacking team but try to run from them and while the attacking team is trying to rescue the hostage the opposing team is trying to kidnap or extract the hostage to a waiting vehicle to be interrogated later. This way the time could be pushed to 10 min or what ever play the best and people could play in the game longer and not be out after 1 min or when they get killed. If their team can revive them(maybe each player can only be revived once) then they would still be in the game but once there revive(S) are used, there out and can only participate on the security cams. Hope this makes sense."

It's awesome, thank you & thanks everyone for participating in an active constructive discussion around these videos. It's good to get insight on what you all think about specific topics! :)"
Rainbow6,375k19,Livinpink,2,Mon May 25 19:21:14 2015 UTC,Thanks! The feedback and support from you and electr1cpanda has been great. The purpose of the videos is three fold. 1. To bring awareness of the game to people through other platforms such as YouTube and Facebook and redirect those people back to this subreddit to grow the community.  2. Have regular topicals to create discussion points in the community and share with you guys (the developers) what we think about a given topic. 3. It's just kind of fun to do!
Rainbow6,375k19,ltfuzzknuckles,3,Mon May 25 21:27:01 2015 UTC,Thank you for bringing up the point about putting away your LMG and suddenly moving faster. I hate that so much
Rainbow6,375k19,forzaitalia458,2,Mon May 25 09:12:33 2015 UTC,"It's like you put it into a magic ""bag of holding"" or something in some games. It just makes no sense why you would suddenly be less encumbered. I think it makes sense to ADS faster as that would be altered based on whatever weapon you're holding, but how fast you're actually moving is dependent on how much weight your hauling around and that's a constant. Not sure which way they'll wind up doing it in Siege."
Rainbow6,375k19,forzaitalia458,2,Mon May 25 16:01:06 2015 UTC,what other game does this besides counter strike?   I would argue maybe it is easier to move around with a LMG on your back vs holding it because you would have more leverage (back is stronger than your arms). But I have no facts to back that up lol
Rainbow6,375k19,TheScreamingMonkey,2,Mon May 25 16:27:52 2015 UTC,"Every Call of Duty game does this. I'm not 100% sure, but I think Battlefield does this too. ( I haven't played a BF game in a few years)"
Rainbow6,375k19,TheLucarian,2,Mon May 25 17:14:01 2015 UTC,"I just poped in advanced warfare in just to test it, and the speed increase is very minimal where you barely even realize it is going faster. not much of a problem. It is more of a problem in counter strike where it is a huge speed difference, but personally I like it."
Rainbow6,375k19,sonoblink,2,Mon May 25 17:33:24 2015 UTC,"I play heavy class whenever I play Exo Survival mode un Advanced Warfare. You really feel the class differences in that game mode. When the random uplink round comes up I can't do anything other than try to be a bullet sponge and a distraction for the light classes who can move fast enough to get the three scores before the time runs out. I don't necessarily have a problem with heavy armor and heavy weapon guys moving more slowly,  I just take issue with the instant mobility increase when you pull a pistol because it's not like your character dropped the LMG or whatever,  they're still carrying it, it's just assumed they let it dangle on a three point sling or something. So if you're slowed down by the weight then swapping to your sidearm while still carrying your primary shouldn't suddenly make you move faster or anything. At least that's how I see it."
Rainbow6,375k19,MapleApples,2,Mon May 25 21:16:08 2015 UTC,"I recall there being a trade off with heavy armor in rogue spear, I think it was speed and noise level whilst moving. I think it's a good idea, more options to tailor your loadout according to how you want to play that round."

Rainbow6,374hzx,Serg37TDS,5,Sun May 24 20:16:56 2015 UTC,Hi and welcome!    Why is it Rainbow vs Rainbow and not vs Terrorists? You will never play a terrorist in Rainbow Six Siege. You will always play as one of the CTU Operators. That’s what Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six games have always been and we’re faithful to the brand legacy. This was already the case in previous Rainbow Six games. There was no reason to change on Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege.   All the 20 operators will be Rainbow Six Operators and divided into attackers and defenders.
Rainbow6,374hzx,Deosl,1 point,Sun May 24 21:18:06 2015 UTC,"Fortunately, like all previous Rainbow Six games, the attackers and defenders are all Rainbow Six and nobody is forced to play a ""terrorist"".  Unfortunately, unlike all previous Rainbow Six games, the attackers and defenders not only have weapons and gadgets specific to the attackers or defenders that the other team can't use, but there are also gadgets limited to just a single pre-made and pre-named operative that only one person can choose on your team."

Rainbow6,370ki1,DUTCHSWATUNIT,4,Sun May 24 13:02:58 2015 UTC,"Hate dedicated servers?   I strongly disagree with you there and your reasoning is just because after a game is abanonded no one will play it? 12 years later you can still play Raven Shield on atleast 35 dedicated servers...  You can most likely host your own games in Siege without dedicated servers. But that sucks since the host will have an advantage.  What EA is doing is completly not in the same category. They are taking down servers for free-to-play games because they aren't popular anymore and are losing money keeping the servers online.    Ubisoft has kept the Raven Shield authentication server open for 12 years, players can host their own servers. Doubt they will take anything down after 2-3 years like you imply."

Rainbow6,370cjd,geofurb,1 point,Sat May 23 20:33:28 2015 UTC,Best kills would show who's the best of each operator/ weapon class.  Nothing that says best K/D here.   Or the one who uses the gadgets of the operator in the best manner possible.

Rainbow6,370cjd,geofurb,0,Sun May 24 10:29:16 2015 UTC,"Not really. Winning with a certain operator/gun doesn't show anything. It doesn't show that you ""pull"" your weight in your team. A win percentage is useless for weapons and operators.  Kill tracking with an operator/gun would actually  show the skills of a player.  P.S This is a clan thing, not for the ""casual"" players. If KD is going to destroy every chances of tactic in your clan, it might be time you leave your clan :)."
Rainbow6,370cjd,BBLover18,1 point,Sun May 24 20:54:14 2015 UTC,"If your win % is higher with that operator, then you're doing better with that operator; it's that simple. Win % isn't very telling of individual matches (duh), but when you look at a running average of many matches, it's the only stat that matters."

Rainbow6,36vs9i,Survivor22575,8,Fri May 22 14:47:52 2015 UTC,"Some things certainty seemed to change from that first game play didn't it? I'm holding out hope that the 10 hidden operator classes have a couple of snipers or marksmen hidden in their ranks. But who knows, things have changed. Remember how that sniper got taken out? The defender crept up on her and that's no longer a valid game play mechanic anymore because as soon as a defender leaves the interior space they are lit up on screen so they can no longer flank with stealth like they did in that video."
Rainbow6,36vs9i,iceycat,3,Fri May 22 15:09:28 2015 UTC,"The hostage building (House/Plane) is ""surrounded"", so defenders exiting the structure are given red outlines for the attackers to target them. There's no auditory alert though, so it's still possible to flank attackers by going outside the building to great effect, especially with the heartbeat sensor. All subject to change, of course. It's a way to keep the playing field more level (defenders still won something like 70% of the matches per the infographic) without explicitly forbidding defenders from exiting the structure (think Battlefield's killing you or old games' invisible walls)."
Rainbow6,36vs9i,geofurb,0,Fri May 22 19:27:48 2015 UTC,The defenders won by just camping most of the time which sadly turned a lot of people off the game
Rainbow6,36vs9i,sonoblink,7,Sat May 23 00:00:34 2015 UTC,"Alright, ""camping"" was dumb and frustrating way back when, when deathmatch/TDM was the only way to play. In a TACTICAL SHOOTER, ""camping"" is just playing smart. They're the defenders; ""camping"" is an effective defense tactic. That's why people have always tried to be the ones defending since ancient times when you'd have skirmishers throw javelins at the enemy's lines to try to provoke them into an attack."
Rainbow6,36vs9i,geofurb,-7,Sat May 23 06:55:31 2015 UTC,Lol  Well for me camping is a no no i will always try other ways to promote open gameplay and keep the flow of the game moving and fun with the will to win anyways everyone to there own^  PS  I'm not a fukin hunter gatherer from the flintstones i'm a pc gamer xD

I could kill the commentary audio but the video was another matter. It was distracting hearing me talk on the voice over but seeing a talking head in the lower right corner whose lips were saying something else entirely,  so I had to cover it up. Until someone else grants me permission to use other video I'll be stuck with that issue. Thanks for the comment though. I want to try so hard to keep thing positive,  even while I'm constructively criticizing. You can totally be fair and balance while talking about things that bother you. I just don't want anyone to think that because I'm being positive I'm not bothered by some things.

We'll just have to see how it plays out in other game modes where there are no objectives. Maybe we can use customizable characters with no limits in other modes or unranked modes.  How will some of the defensive operators contribute in SP? I don't see any use of bringing Castle with his reinforced barricades :l
Rainbow6,36tz2l,Deosl,2,Fri May 22 07:58:54 2015 UTC,Hope your right deosl!
Rainbow6,36tz2l,sonoblink,2,Fri May 22 10:48:35 2015 UTC,"I doubt they will even have a game without objectives.  They seem very focused on quick rounds with action focused to a small area.  Hence the use of only ONE hostage instead of TWO, which would have added a lot more depth and possible tactics had they gone with two like previous R6 games.  I also doubt they could create a way to have anything but Operatives at this point.  The character models appear static and it doesn't look like you could swap out gear and have the character model change to show different gear."
Rainbow6,36tz2l,lone_turkey,1 point,Fri May 22 14:44:33 2015 UTC,"Barricades may help depending on the objective, you could have a slow to achieve static objective and barracading yourselves in might help buy time.... I assume sp is not just hostage rescue with AI."
Rainbow6,36tz2l,Quwertzuiop96,4,Sat May 23 16:44:19 2015 UTC,"I think they want to step more into the competitive scene instead of remaining to the series with this Title (I unfortunately never played a R6Game before, therefore I have no problem with it). and as in many other MOBAs or e-sports titles you play only from round to round. Therefore, it makes absolutely no sense to have individual characters. New game new luck. Besides this would a LVL system or upgrade system outside the round disqualifying the game from e-sports. and also only half of all characters was available in the alpha. at twice the characters, I think you easily can make it to repeatedly pick the same character. nevertheless you need to end up with knowing all characters and be able to play them anyway. I could imagine in the single player / coop campaign individual character customization is eventuel possible because it does not make sense here to play with predefined characters."
Rainbow6,36tz2l,forzaitalia458,3,Fri May 22 06:58:38 2015 UTC,"Hate to be a Debbie downer, but they probably already printing the art of siege strategy guide with the art assets finalized. So I don't think you will see much changes even with just bringing back the e3 models."
Rainbow6,36tz2l,BBLover18,3,Fri May 22 02:59:55 2015 UTC,"I'm amazed that I'm agreeing with you for once, tis' a day to celebrate. We should be able to customize our character, if you put something else than the chosen outfits for the operator, you need to have the sign of your operator on your back and chest piece.  I still think that the terrorists should have their own criminal skins (No top quality gear like Rainbow)."
Rainbow6,36tz2l,-eXnihilo,3,Fri May 22 03:49:56 2015 UTC,"To me, it seems that the primary reason to do a system like this would be DLC/exclusive operators (classes).  Instead of exclusive maps that may divide the community, have exclusive/premium characters that are ""balanced"" and can play along with the non-DLC players."
Rainbow6,36tz2l,CSKarasu,7,Fri May 22 17:43:02 2015 UTC,Ugh...that makes me hate Operatives even more.  I'm a big R6 fan but if this is why they are doing it then I hope the game fails miserably.
Rainbow6,36tz2l,TheLucarian,2,Fri May 22 18:43:18 2015 UTC,"Class based multiplayer is huge right now. Blizzards Overwatch, CoD, and Battlefront are the big guns this year and they each have an element of premade characters.   Not saying it's better but class based multiplayer brings a different element to strategy 'Team A are running with X, Y, Z how can we counter it?' And this kind of strategic class and team synergy games will continue to grow in popularity."
Rainbow6,36tz2l,TheLucarian,6,Fri May 22 14:09:06 2015 UTC,"I'm confused.  Which team in those games you mentioned knows what class the other team is bringing?  So one team knows and can change tactics based on that and the other can't?  If they both can, then we are back to nobody really knowing what the other team is bringing.  Regardless, I find it pretty unrealistic, especially if defenders know what the offense is bringing.  Perhaps offense did some recon to see what they are up against, but this could also be accomplished by physically seeing what the operator has, so you can also accomplish that with custom operatives where players choose from all weapons/gadgets and also choose the amount and type of armor they wear."
Rainbow6,36tz2l,chemx32,2,Fri May 22 15:50:47 2015 UTC,"I like the operator system, and I think the pros outweigh the cons heavily: a) I know from seeing my opponent what they are capable of, equipment wise. b) same thing for watching others play. c) not everyone is running around with the same boring equipment or the same tacticool beanie hat. d) Team balance and diversity. e) and last but not least, it's something new and refreshing.  The only two things con to me are a) not being able to reliably pick the same gadget every round, but that is something I really need to play longer to being able to form a proper position on. During the alpha I had no problem with it since I wanted to try all the operators anyway and I found everyone to be of some use. It's not league of Legends style character system where playing a character you haven't played much puts you at a huge disadvantage. And b) not being able to roleplay your character and that is something I personally don't need in tactical shooters at all. I don't care how I look to others, the only thing I care for is being able to easily recognize my friends and also enemies from friendlies.  I think I could go on forever on this topic, just like you, but it's set in stone anyway and I'm sure it's one of the reasons siege will stick out compared to other shooters - and you need that to be successful - and I want siege to be successful. So, thumbs up to the operator system from me."
Rainbow6,36tz2l,TheLucarian,6,Fri May 22 08:49:24 2015 UTC,"""New and Refreshing"" is a great thing for a new Intellectual Property that is starting out to compete with established IP's, but is usually the Kiss Of Death when that phrase is used on an established IP.  In the case of Siege, it is essentially ""jumping the shark"" with the Rainbow Six brand I am afraid.  As far as Roleplaying, I am not sure what definition you are using.  You are being forced to ""roleplay"" the pre-made operative you choose in Siege, instead of ""roleplaying"" yourself.  When I play against another clan, I usually know by the person's in-game name that they created for themselves what weapons/gadgets they tend to use and what playstyle they have, and that is what I enjoy countering.  In the Alpha, I never found myself or saw others changing the way they played based on what pre-made character was chosen this round by someone on the other team.  You don't even know that until it is too late and they can pick another pre-made character the next round.  As a fan of the original 3 games of the R6 series, I definately DO NOT ""need"" Siege to be successful.  It doesn't represent the type of game my R6 clan enjoys, and they either need to go back to the type of game they created with the first 3, or let it die off and start a new IP.  They have now created 3 completely different types of games with Lockdown, Vegas, and Siege and I doubt they are done F'ing up the Rainbow Six IP with Siege.  Who knows what crazy direction is next."
Rainbow6,36tz2l,Jcb245,2,Fri May 22 14:40:15 2015 UTC,"You know, people criticize Activision all the time for not innovating the call of duty franchise and yet if ubisoft tries to innovate, you hate on them. I for one am just so so glad that we are not getting a Vegas 3 or that abomination that would've been patriots. Would I enjoy Ravenshield 2015? Hell yes! But I'm going to enjoy siege too and it makes me happy that we are going to finally get a promising Rainbow Six game again."

Rainbow6,36sfd9,RealityKing4Hire,4,Thu May 21 19:19:32 2015 UTC,"I don't think we'll be getting any major reveals prior to E3. There might be another basic Community Corner video (maybe) But even if there is I wouldn't expect anything earth shattering from as far as new reveals go. We'll get some more of those Operator profiles as the weeks go on, etc. The biggest we MIGHT get prior to E3 is if Ubisoft decides to share a change log 2.0 based on further Alpha feedback, but who knows on that one.  I can't imagine they would give anything major away at this point as I'm sure they want E3 to make a big impact. Expect some potentially major reveals then. That's when the hype train will probably really start picking up steam. They'll give a little bit in pieces between then and launch with some major reveals in the final weeks. That's pretty much game marketing 101 based on what most other major game releases seem to do.  As far as Season Pass content goes, developers never share that info up front. It's a blind purchase. A developer might give you some info that's super generic like ""new maps and modes"" But you don't actually know what you're getting until the next piece of DLC is almost out. That stuff may already be all outlined internally but they can change what they're doing with it content wise and if they committed to something a year in advance they're kind of locked into the decision. Personally speaking, I hate the concept of Season Pass for the very reason that you're being asked to essentially buy the game a 2nd time cost wise and yet you have little to no idea what you're getting in exchange. I'm not a fan of the buisness model. It's like giving the publishers a pay day advance loan for work you won't see for months or more. Preorder is kind of like that too, which I'm also not a fan of but these are the new trends in game marketing and sales whether we like them or not."

Rainbow6,36oopv,WarPwny,6,Wed May 20 22:38:32 2015 UTC,"The device as a concept is fine. It was in the books and most of the older games. The way they've balanced it in Seige has some issues. An easy way to fix it is make it not real time but slow it down to a pulse every three seconds (seems like they kind of did this, no longer real time but the pulses are so fast it might as well be) also the range nerf is good at about 10m now. Finally they should obscure the peripheral vision, implement what Alien Isolation did sort of, when you're looking at device edges could be all blurry rendering your peripheral vision usless making you more vulnerable.  Also perhaps introduce a slight noise grain to the blue screen so it's slightly staticy. These things should help it be well balanced.   Also a better countermeasure than EMP grenades. Pulse can use his device as long as he wants as much as he wants but the countermeasure is thrown and then done and it's over. Something better needs to be thought of there in my opinion."
Rainbow6,36oopv,iceycat,1 point,Wed May 20 23:25:38 2015 UTC,I'm sure they're planning on implementing some sort of battery life into the heartbeat sensor's use.
Rainbow6,36oopv,TheRealCochise,6,Thu May 28 02:06:15 2015 UTC,"Remove the visual component, make it beep faster when the signal is closer. Hold it out in front of you like a wand, make the beeping audible to everyone so teammates can use it to coordinate and very nearby enemies can hear you using it.  Reducing the HBS range from 15m to 10m doesn't make much of a difference, because it's most important when you're closest to the enemy!"
Rainbow6,36oopv,geofurb,1 point,Thu May 21 06:10:34 2015 UTC,"That's also a great suggestion, a little bit more like the R6-1 and 2 hbs versions."
Rainbow6,36oopv,TheLucarian,5,Thu May 21 09:56:02 2015 UTC,"They should nerf it back to what we had in Ravenshield where it takes time to take out and put away, obscures more vision, and has more things to counter it.  RvS you could use stationary jammer, portable jammer, or throw out false heartbeat pucks to counter it.  I don't know why they keep throwing out the things that worked well in past games and insist on changing so much.   Yeah...instead of working doors, lets just force defenders to build walls where doors should be...that's a great idea! (NOT)"
Rainbow6,36oopv,Pest_AWC,1 point,Thu May 21 04:05:11 2015 UTC,"I miss the idea of working doors in games also. I'll really be excited to see something like that come back with say breach charges for each team to counteract campers.

Rainbow6,36oopv,TheRealCochise,2,Thu May 28 02:09:04 2015 UTC,"I don't like using gadgets like that. I think everyone should be forced to use their ears or instincts. But that's just me.

Rainbow6,36oopv,forzaitalia458,2,Thu May 21 00:18:50 2015 UTC,Forgive my ignorance but are heartbeat senors real? I mean can this technology by deployed like it is in RB6?
Rainbow6,36oopv,Deosl,3,Thu May 21 03:34:51 2015 UTC,"Yes and no.   Yes: It exists in some form, but it's not mobile like in the games. Here's an example where it was used in Nepal after the earthquake.  If NASA has a prototype of it in 2015, I doubt anyone had that in 1998.  No: When Tom Clancy was writing Rainbow Six, Red Storm were also developing the game at the same time. Tom Clancy was presented a concept ""prototype"" of the HBS by a company that promised a bit too much.  Read more about it here where the devs answer some questions."
Rainbow6,36oopv,geofurb,1 point,Thu May 21 05:57:50 2015 UTC,"I did some research on the FINDER system, and it's not quite like the HBS.

There's a ton of filtering done, and it won't penetrate metal. (It's near cell phone frequency, but much more sensitive.)  Very cool system for real-life, not the hoax device the book's HBS described. (The book's heartbeat sensor was the LifeGuard by DKL; a hoax that was the modern equivalent of a divining rod.)"

Rainbow6,36oopv,Monsterlvr123,2,Thu May 21 09:00:39 2015 UTC,IMO I hate it and want it completely gone
Rainbow6,36oopv,Deosl,2,Thu May 21 15:00:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I noticed this quite late in the alpha. I think it's rather silly that attackers can pull out infinite drones. It should be limited to the one you get at the start.   It's basicaly respawning and it has hardly any consequences if your drones dies. Devs are banging on no respawn for your player which is great, but why doesn't this apply for the drones as well?"
Rainbow6,36oopv,iceycat,1 point,Thu May 21 15:56:21 2015 UTC,A fair point. Though drones can and usually are destroyed at the start of the round. I think mid round drone surveillance was kind of under utilized once the round began.

Rainbow6,36igqo,bobbytones,18,Tue May 19 17:04:46 2015 UTC,I believe that rainbow 6 should return to the basics of what made oldbow on xbox a great game   I'd rather we return to the roots of the original PC Rainbow Six trilogy.

Rainbow6,36igqo,RealityKing4Hire,1 point,Tue May 19 17:51:07 2015 UTC,Black Arrow was a port of the Athena Sword expansion pack (more or less) from Raven Shield. As such it still fits in with the original core games (minus the fact that it handled health differently and lost the planning phase)
Rainbow6,36igqo,iceycat,1 point,Tue May 19 18:13:30 2015 UTC,Yes and I think this what what OP means by oldbow on xbox. So him and trineroks are basically suggesting the same thing.
Rainbow6,36igqo,RealityKing4Hire,2,Tue May 19 18:28:37 2015 UTC,I totally get what he is saying though. The first rainbow game I ever picked up was the one that came out on the xbox. It brought me into a whole new world especially with a little know thing that was hitting the market at the time called xbox live.  I have judged every Rainbow game I have ever played by the standard or this first one. When I hear the words garage or hanger I get so starry eyed thinking off all the great times I had on those maps.  Oh the feels of that first time you threw a grenade at the base of the door going into the garage and killed a guy behind it was priceless.
Rainbow6,36igqo,blackop,1 point,Tue May 19 19:21:28 2015 UTC,"Such good times. I loved ""Parade"" going through that map on terrorist hunt co-op with a friend. Get to the marketplace and toss a WP grenade through the overlooking window to hear the bad guy BBQ! Even on the Xbox they randomized enemy placement to a certain degree so that you weren't sure where an enemy would be. You know probable locations but nothing for certain. Throwing that grenade at that one window for instance would only net a kill about a third or so of the time."
Rainbow6,36igqo,iceycat,-1,Tue May 19 21:14:46 2015 UTC,"You need to change the formula from the old games; Raven Shield didn't even have ironsights for chrissake, that was modded in. Change has to happen, and it's troubling, but it ultimately gets us a richer tactical shooter."
Rainbow6,36igqo,geofurb,3,Wed May 20 00:46:50 2015 UTC,"Raven Shield did have something that emulated iron sights (when you click shift, it zooms in your aim for more precise shots). The only thing missing was its graphical representation (your view switching to iron sights)."

Rainbow6,36igqo,paolorey,2,Wed May 20 03:00:39 2015 UTC,"Hey, be nice to me! :) And the devs! They say they're big fans of the early titles (as am I!), but a lot changes in 12 years. Comparing Siege to Raven Shield is like comparing Raven Shield to Wolfenstein 3D.  The genre's evolved so much that you can't just copy the gameplay anymore; things are fundamentally different. Take inspiration, try to evoke the same feelings and thoughts as the previous title, but you have to innovate a lot.  Unfortunately for Rainbow Six, the tactical shooter genre kinda fell into two extremes, one focusing too heavily on realism, the other on engagement/mainstream consumption, which turned most modern tactical shooters into cumbersome simulations and the rest into Call of Duty 4, iterating on that formula ad nauseam. (Call of Duty 4 would have been called a tactical shooter in 2003. How fucked up is that? Nascent genre.)  Keep in mind the mainstream shooter in 2003 was Unreal Tounament, so the entire FPS genre has shifted strongly towards the gameplay of tactical shooters at the time, it just hasn't captured the essence of those old games. They made knockoffs of the gameplay, tweaked to fit the mainstream consumer, and ignored tactics. Rainbow Six did that, too. (Sorry, Vegas devs.)  Siege isn't like the last few Rainbow Six titles. It's not like Raven Shield either; it's fundamentally different, but it's the first Rainbow Six title since Raven Shield that looks like it's going to give you that tactical, thinking experience. That's what they're taking us back to. No more playing dress-up, grinding gear, hitmarkers, or any of the modern mistakes; they're making this a thinking game again. It's back to the basics."

A lot of early hype that will sell, but fall just as fast. So far all the hype is based on one mode that has A LOT of potential but beyond that I'm not sure. I want it to be good but I'm becoming less and less optimistic as times goes on."
Rainbow6,36f5b8,paolorey,2,Tue May 19 16:32:32 2015 UTC,"Why do you think that? It's kind of par for the course for a developer to keep their cards close until they get closer to release. Don't forget we also have confirmed single player and terrorist hunt modes as well, not to mention other modes they haven't talked about yet. If they keep just standard R6 modes in play like bomb defusal for mp as well as co-op and make hostage rescue a co-op mode as well plus add in a TDM for adversarial we'll be making good head way. If they bring even more stuff to the table so much the better. I think they'll have plenty of modes to offer. Like you, I wish I knew what they would all be, but we'll have to wait and see as we get closer to launch aa typically they save those details to continue to keep the excitement fresh all the way up to release."
Rainbow6,36f5b8,IHaveNoFiya,3,Tue May 19 19:58:18 2015 UTC,"It's Ubisoft. Their track record isn't that good as of late.  Alpha wasn't that popular. (Even though they ""appeared"" to fix a lot of issues). Hopefully the BETA shows this. It feels a lot like Evolve to me. A lot of hype for one main mode and the others are kinds of filler/not really mentioned and in the end that's exactly what they were. All very similar to Evolve. Yes people still play it but the hype died off almost immediately.    Don't take this as me looking for a reason to hate on the game. I bought a PS4 for Evolve, R6, and The Division because I was so hyped. I was disappointed when I ended up passing on Evolve, but it just wasn't the game I thought it was going to be. I know that nothing will come close to what we saw for R6 during E3 as it was scripted, and no matter what I will be around until the moment it releases at which point I can make a clear judgement.

The readers are PC gamers and most likely remember/love R6 since the 1998-2003 versions and the SWAT games.   Hence, they are wary of a new R6 after Lockdown and Vegas series. Like most of us, we love R6 and would love to see them return to the roots. Some would say we are just a vocal minority based on focus group marketing etc.  But what exactly are they not listening about? They took a lot of the communities feedback and made some tweaks/changes. With release in a couple of months, there's limited time to change and test ""everything""."

Not going to say they arent listening but they arent really listening well thus far. STill holding out hope though.

There are a couple missions where I would also set up a long rifleman just like in the books.
Rainbow6,368ib7,PeteRaw,4,Sun May 17 05:18:31 2015 UTC,"Same here. I was so sad when they removed this feature. I got so good in the original, I could finish every map with just planning."

Rainbow6,368ib7,trineroks,3,Sun May 17 07:06:03 2015 UTC,I always used the planning phase. If you find yourself lost over the planning tools then you can refer to my post here.
Rainbow6,368ib7,mousetrapreplica,3,Sun May 17 13:27:08 2015 UTC,i play alot of raven shield to this day. i can't even imagine playing through this game without the planning phase. its easily the best part of the game.  the go codes (alpha bravo etc) also make room clearing alot more fluid. you can have the plan set up to take down a whole building in a matter of seconds with the proper plan laid out. one mission in particular stands out in my mind where you have to deactivate several nerve gas canisters in a meat packing plant. without multiple squads to tackle the objectives at the same time that mission is quite literally unwinnable as the terrorists will immediately release the gas once alerted
Rainbow6,368ib7,raw11j,3,Sun May 17 06:47:42 2015 UTC,The planning phase was the best part of the game.  The old games relied on good planning if you wanted to complete the game without losing any Rainbow operatives.

I do wish FPS would fix the compartmentalised enemies, so going loud will send some to investigate (not rush in) from a farther point of the map.  My tactics were either to clamp down from opposite insertion points, or pincer and clear compartment by compartment from one spawn point with two fire teams. Always planning in overlapping routes for all teams to make sure Rainbow does a complete sweep whether or not I lose teams. If the mission allows hit and run of objectives, I'll try for them because it is harder.  After playing as a human, I spent many more hours planning for perfect missions in Observer mode. I do wish they add Ghost Recon or Door Kickers style map based live rerouting. The line of sight action waypoint setting from Raven Shield and onwards were quite limiting, and more or less only allowing frontal assaults and one side flanks of the room in front of you. Luckily Lockdown onwards fixed the standing in the middle of the doorway problem."
Rainbow6,368ib7,TheLucarian,1 point,Thu May 21 01:50:55 2015 UTC,"I never used the planning phase in campaign. I would leap frog between taking control of red, green and gold teams. I'd deploy each team to a different insertion point, clear out the immediate area, swap to the next team and do the same. Each time advancing to the next major cover point and holding while I moved the next team up and so on.   Now in multiplayer I loved being able to draw on the map or drop quick icons as a way of communicating strategy in PvE co-op modes.  It made things easier to say who goes through what door and what route to take to get there."
Rainbow6,368ib7,mousetrapreplica,3,Sun May 17 17:25:40 2015 UTC,"Wow, that must have taken you ages to finish a mission!

Rainbow6,368ib7,iceycat,1 point,Sun May 17 06:21:51 2015 UTC,i think the way you describe sounds alot more tedious and slow. once you play the game for a bit the planning phase can cut the actual mission time down significantly

Rainbow6,36bdxb,trineroks,5,Mon May 18 01:02:53 2015 UTC,It would be nice to choose between day and night for the missions. Forcing players to use night vision gadgets would make the round completely different.

Rainbow6,36bdxb,Maximal113,0,Mon May 18 06:25:11 2015 UTC,"The engine is capable of a running day-night cycle, it was active in Assassin's Creed: Black Flag, but removed from AC: Unity because Ubisoft be Ubisoft. Will it work on multiplier? Not with 3 minute rounds and not for maps built around that 3 minute limit.  But singleplayer and co-op can have a large multi floor building or the cruise ship in Door Kickers, where the change in lighting conditions can push Rainbow to compete certain task before the light changes, or hold off and wait for the light to change to work in their advantage. A building cut off from the electrical grid at dawn, Rainbow need to move their arse to maintain the advantage of night vision in the cover of darkness. Or at sunset, where the low sun will blind building occupants but approaching the building too early in bright daylight or too late in the low light shadows will lose Rainbow some degree of surprise.  But, big but, that is if Rainbow Six returns to sandbox maps. Not the linear, scripted levels that have taken over since Lockdown and in Ghost Recon: Future Soldier; or the position scripted events and drip fed waypoints within open maps of GRAW."
Rainbow6,36bdxb,jonowee,2,Mon May 18 12:51:09 2015 UTC,Iceycat said it better than I imagined...it would be so cool. Just to bring out the dynamic lighting and produce such immersive environments....that is what we saw with the E3 2014 unveil...that's what made that map so amazing(besides the destruction) was the night time eeriness. Thanks iceycat for your reply. Hope the devs read this!
Rainbow6,36bdxb,iceycat,1 point,Mon May 18 23:14:01 2015 UTC,"An interesting point - if the game engine supports a day/night dynamic render engine as per your AC example, how cool would it be to be able to choose your own time of day on any given match at launch? Could be a server side setting for private matches or a random setting for public matches. When the darkness threshold is crossed illuminated elements automatically turn on so that when the round loads you can still see in the ways the level designers intended you to. I haven't seen any indication of a thermal or night vision system so I'm thinking that would be achieved by all practical lighting. That would give a lot of variation to the maps. Sunrise sunset, harsh daylight and dark night with subtle variations in between. As a 3D modeler, I've had great fun using a physical based rendering sysyem to illuminate my scenes by punching in different times of day when rendering. If the game engine already supports it anyway, you have to admit that would be kind of cool."

Rainbow6,365juw,Speciou5,2,Sun May 17 01:02:53 2015 UTC,"Class and faction models (3D Environment)  While I prefer an open build-your-own-operator system, I have less objections than some people to the class-gadget experiment in Siege. Like Rainbow Six itself as an experiment into tactical shooters, I am welcome to trying new features as long as they have been well thought out and balanced, and contribute to positively to the overall game.   Siege alpha 0.10   http://i.imgur.com/096kG9y.png  Currently Ubisoft’s choice to allow units from the same special forces unit to be on both attacking and defending teams in the same game has create a multitude of IFF (identification friend or foe) problems, the most basic of which is that a player cannot identify which team another player is on simply from the uniform they are wearing. “Was the gas mask wearing SAS character that just ran past this doorway the enemy or my teammate?” To compensate for this flawed design choice, Ubisoft have chosen to add friendly HUD markers visible at all times. This new design choice add more intrusive friendly markers itself creates a new snowball of gameplay problems, the most blatant of which is the breaking of the HBS (heartbeat sensor) back to the old original Rainbow Six and Rogue Spear days when Raven Shield had fixed the great design flaw-crutch of the HBS.  But I digressed too deep into talking about the HUD that I will go into more detail into a future update about HUDs. While the best fix for gameplay is to create a total of 105 character versions on top of the current 21 classes. 20 operator class, plus 1 recruit versions of artwork for each of the 5 current factions of SAS, GIGN, GSG 9, Spetsnaz, and FBI. That way even if we don’t go back to the T vs. CT artwork of the E3 2014 build, these 105 character models will allow for unified uniforms for Green Team vs. Red Team (Blufor vs. Opfor). Even now I am hesitant to call the USA faction the FBI as besides dark eyewear, gas mask pouch and ALICE eyelets there is inconsistent art work where Ash being the only one with FBI markings, Pulse and Thermite have US flags, while Castle has neither; come on Ubisoft, get it together.   ROSSVEC 0.1   http://i.imgur.com/X1xcWF2.png   As for ROSSVEC 0.1, and not have Ubisoft have to create 80 all new versions of character skins, art work and lore; I propose a compromised solution by shuffling the character models while maintaining the current 21 operator classes and keeping some of the pre-existing artwork and animations that have been worked on. SF factions will be set for attacking or defending teams, providing consistent IFF states. But unfortunately Siege only has planned 5 factions which cannot easily be split 1 for 1 on each side, so instead of adding 80 new characters, Ubisoft would only have to add 5 new characters by adding a new SF unit to give 3 factions per team. Currently in ROSSVEC 0.1, it’s set as European forces vs The World.  While the HUD artwork for ROSSVEC 0.1 is more or less done, I need to edit together the artwork for the HUD analysis of Raven Shield, Siege alpha 0.10, Siege E3 July 2014 to contrast and compare ROSSVEC with them to build my case for a better HUD system. For now a teaser of the ROSSVEC HUD, take note not all elements shown are shown permanently in a live game.  http://i.imgur.com/dR9YWrV.png  http://i.imgur.com/Fn6LXVP.png"

The trauma.  Like the mods (which I don't want to become one or brown nose to), I'm not here to dump hate on the game as much I hate many aspects of the current build. I am here to identify problems standalone or in combination with other innocent mechanics that now become problems. Then more importantly come up with solutions that are either best case scenarios, or compromised solution that could work within a 3 and 6 month development windows on top of a two month pre-release game polishing buffer.  The issue that worries me now is I am more patient than Ubisoft to fix the game before release, that once the other much stronger AAA franchises release in November will knock out the momentum for Siege build up a loyal enough community with a game that is not brave enough to offer a strong and differing game experience."

At the moment, it is way too hard to tell who is who. Every operator has completely different uniforms. I personally thought the operator artwork from the e3 build looked great and would rather they have stuck with it. It's a little weird that they have it on the box art, but it's not actually in the game. Guess we will just have to wait and see."
Rainbow6,365juw,sniperwhg,1 point,Sat May 16 11:01:06 2015 UTC,"Ammunition capacity and sustained fire (Gameplay Design)  Sustained Fire Spreadsheet:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PqjJVpkwDtTMxzPOmeIEj4alaZWnQW1TaqkpiQHttGc/edit?usp=sharing  I created this just after the pre-alpha livestream event, but I am not sure where to place it in my feedback thread, it’s not exactly connected with ROSSVEC but is still an important part of the game that needs addressing. I am writing this out tonight without too much thought on it since early April, but it still stands that there is still still much ammunition on the field for a 5v5 CQB game.  At minimum, I’d like to see the public to play test the values of the July 2014 build of 2+1 30 round primary magazines and 75 pistol rounds. But I personally would like it taken down farther with sidearms down to sub-50, so that a 15 round M9 with carry 2+1 pistol magazines instead with 4+1 with a 75 round cap. So total round pools will be reduced from 165 to 135.  Weapon and Gadget Pickup (Gameplay Design)  Comparing the different games for sustained fire, we find that Battlefield 4’s Defuse has the least ammo available for the 4 minute rounds, while Counter Strike has the most for its 2 minute rounds. Both games feature weapon and gadget pickup capabilities from fallen comrades, while BF4 has the possibility of outfield ammo resupply with the Support class even if though that class overall is not as competitive as the Recon in the game mode.  There are three modes of pick up I’d like to see play tested with the public during a long term beta periods (months long please):   Gadget swap only Weapon equipped swap only Full kit swap   Full kit swap I really do not like, with weapon only swap being a close second to options I do not like. If it is too streamlined with too easy ammunition swap is both immersion breaking in a CQB operation and problematic for me to come up with a sensible control format even on PC with keyboard and mouse if I were to force players to pick up magazines.  What I do like about gadget only swapping is it allows players to weigh up whether they should swap out their own unique gadget for your dead teammate’s gadget to continue the mission. Also it influences how the team will move, do they move together and stack up so that should the need arise, they can pick up gadgets quickly. Or if they are spread out around the map, is it worth the time and risk to travel a medium or long distance to pick up that gadget to continue the mission or make do with their own gadgets. With gadget swapping only, the player still has to exercise disciplined marksmanship."

All 3 are stand-up guys who've contributed very positively and are dedicated. What's most important is that they tend to support everything they say with rational arguments. So I don't know what your problem is... but I suspect it's probably the following:   I just wanted my feelings known.   Don't confuse this forum with your girlfriend.... That's not how this works.

Rainbow6,363o3p,ubichem,4,Fri May 15 21:06:03 2015 UTC,"Allow me to clarify that a bit for you. Our operators hail from various CTUs around the globe. The closest of which is our FBI/SWAT, of which the real world equivalent is the FBI HRT (or Hostage Rescue Team), which is a paramilitary force within the FBI--specifically trained for hostage rescue and extraction.  These aren't local police departments, but organizations like the FBI, SAS, and others. These CTUs are trained specifically to deal with major terrorist threats.  So, you can rest assured that you're not going to be playing as cops, but CTU operatives with years of specialized training.   This is not to downplay the importance of domestic police SWAT units. Many ex-SEALs, Rangers, and others now serve on SWAT and tactical response units across many of America's cities. These individuals make a great sacrifice and are highly trained in their fields, and it would be a disservice to downplay their expertise simply because they don't bear the shoulder patch of a particular unit (or don't anymore, as the case might well be).  I hope that helps. Cheers!"

Rainbow6,3602fh,Deosl,3,Fri May 15 05:50:00 2015 UTC,"Obviously, they try to make the game playable without communications. This is not a bad thing but the the outline silhouette is absolutely awfull.  If they absolutely want to integrate this HUD... They should use a simple white dot (and maybe adding a small number that indicates the distance in meters). I don't see why it wouldn't work. It gives the same information while being visually less distracting."
Rainbow6,3602fh,PrecisionMode,5,Fri May 15 13:53:00 2015 UTC,"It is confirmed that we will be able to toggle them off, which will maybe become very popular, or mandatory in competitive play. They give you a lot of information about your teammates that lets you coordinate your attack (it's wallhack for team!), and without the hitmarkers, I fear the tactical gameplay would be compromised somewhat.  I'm reserving judgment until beta on this issue. Based on beta feedback, they may remove the markers.  Remember that knowing position is very important in all tactical games. Some games, like America's Army had the ability to press a key (""U"") to ""Report In"" and you would teamchat your general zone on the map as if radio-ing in. (There was no VOIP.) Other games (and later versions of America's Army) used a mini-map that showed teammates. Personally, I would greatly prefer that players had to press a button to temporarily flash an outline for their teammates to see, but I think they're running out of buttons on console as it is."
Rainbow6,3602fh,geofurb,4,Fri May 15 00:20:44 2015 UTC,"Don't flash an outline - instead do what CS does and name specific sections off on a map. Then when you press ""Report in"" it would generate an automated response along the lines of   ""trineroks: Reporting in @ Living Room""  With ""Living Room"" being replaced by whatever section of the map you're in."
Rainbow6,3602fh,trineroks,3,Fri May 15 06:27:30 2015 UTC,"That's what I would prefer too, it's a nice compromise between completely on or off. And maybe flash automatically for a short time while performing an action like barricading or placing a breaching charge."

Siege is supposed to iterate on classic tactical shooter gameplay (because Ubisoft promised a return to form), but what's given now still merely looks like a modification to the arcade shooter genre. The only difference being characters move a bit slower overall, recoil bumped up, and hitmarkers almost gone. In addition, we still have weird crutches like teammate silhouettes, on screen objective markers, near miss/threat indicators, grenade indicators, and the like. And besides these crutches there still exists features like the OHK instakill knife and descriptive killcams. A great number of tactical shooter innovations/features (fluid doors, gimping, point shooting, weapon lowering, magazine management [and with it, speed vs retention reloading], walking, fire selectors, realistic bullet and penetration dynamics, etc) that have been developed over the past years by games like the original Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon, and SWAT games are totally nonexistent."

This would be the ingredient that would take this game from being merely fun to play with to the kind of game that people will replay for years after release. I used to mod and create maps for Ravenshield and it was a blast. I loved taking the maps from the game and modifying them in interesting ways. How much more replayable would the game be if you change elements on existing maps or make and download whole new ones. The important thing is to make the map editor available on console as well.

This put the longevity of the game through the roof for me."
Rainbow6,3608ia,d0kefish,2,Fri May 15 12:10:33 2015 UTC,"Why would they? To make a better game. I understand the point about DLC but people are going to buy DLC because it's premium quality and will show up on official game mode play list rotations. Let's face it, as fun as a map editor is, rare indeed are the user created maps that rival developer made maps in terms of quality and polish. The strength of user made maps is that they might be vastly more simple with far less polish, but they are fun. If your game is fun people will want to invest in it. At least I would. It's the user made map and modding community that has kept people playing Raven Shield for many years after release."
Rainbow6,35yqev,wyomingincident,1 point,Thu May 14 17:04:58 2015 UTC,The multiplayer is operator vs operator. Each operator is unique and has their own special skill.

So that probably means Siege will ship no matter what, so it doesn't get released after CoD. That's always a recipe for a good, bug-free game."
Rainbow6,35yji1,Brethon,4,Thu May 14 22:21:18 2015 UTC,Know we need a beta release date ha
Rainbow6,35yji1,bojanglez34,1 point,Thu May 14 16:48:56 2015 UTC,I'm guessing the beta dates will be announced at E3.
Rainbow6,35yji1,tyhopkin,7,Thu May 14 17:48:10 2015 UTC,I am actually sad that they set an exact date.  That means they will be rushed and are limiting the changes to the game to just the simple ones they mentioned.    This being the first R6 game not to have WORKING DOORS like even BF Hardline does is rather embarrassing and leaves out a lot of depth from potential strategies and also kills realism.
Rainbow6,35yji1,Pest_AWC,1 point,Thu May 14 17:08:27 2015 UTC,Hey less door opening and closing animation and sound means more time spent on other changes we want made right ?   :-D

Rainbow6,35yji1,kreios86,3,Thu May 14 19:58:48 2015 UTC,There is also Star Wars battlefront in November.  They need people to spend money with them in October before they get distracted.

I'm curious what they are and what they can do. I'm guessing they hadn't been revealed yet because their abilities may reveal something about other game modes or features they haven't brought up yet.

You'll just have to shoot people yourself. ;) Auto-fire, unfortunately, seems to be a feature on most of the guns they are including (taken from real counter-terrorist forces' arsenals!), so those guns will have auto-fire in the game, just as in real life. This is maybe one realism feature that I would gladly sacrifice; I would much prefer that most weapons were burst-fire."

Rainbow6,35y06d,pkkp30,6,Thu May 14 13:35:39 2015 UTC,"Did you read the blog post on closed alpha feedback?  In previous R6 games, it wasn't OP because:   You had to switch from your main gun to the HBS It took some time and made a noticeable noise for other players You couldn't differ from friend or foe based on heart beats There was no distance indicator Maps were larger, shorter range on HBS Handheld and stationary Jammers HBS pucks that gives out false heart beats   In Siege it's ""OP"" because:   Fast switch between weapon and HBS Doesn't obstruct the players view Gives you distance indication You can easily tell friend from foe based on friendly outlines    Suggestions:   Make it less effective on re-inforced walls Limit the usage time (charge up or something) Make a noise ? Or enough for the player using it so he/she can't hear much around the enviourments (but then again, just put it to silent :P)   In the older games you could counter the HBS with false HBS pucks, here you have to jam them with emp nades.  I'll have to try the HBS again after the tweaks they've made to comment further if the changes are effective enough."
Rainbow6,35y06d,Deosl,6,Thu May 14 13:47:36 2015 UTC,"It also wasn't OP in Ravenshield because you had both the option of the stationary jammer, and a hand held one, as well as False-Heartbeat Pucks to trick those using the HBS.

Rainbow6,35y06d,Monsterlvr123,1 point,Thu May 14 19:02:16 2015 UTC,"As the developers keep pointing out, the heartbeat sensors were in previous R6 games and the book. That said it does seem OP in it's current iteration. They kept trying to solve it by reducing the range in several increments. While that's a little bit of the problem, the greater issue as compared to previous R6 games is that you are highly mobile while using it and it sends you updates in real time. The other R6 games made it so you really couldn't walk around while using it as you couldn't see your environment too well and that the heart beats where ""pinged"" with a pulse every 2-3 seconds or so. This gave you a direction, but not a super accurate fix on their location. Only a heading, really. In this one the feed is in constant real time so you can pin down exactly where they are at all times. Also with having the screen of the HBS monitor semi transparent you can still run around your environment and track the targets, dodge incoming fire, etc.  In their update blog yesterday they said Pulse didn't seem to have an unfair advantage in kills or wins when compared to other characters kill stats. The flaw in that position is that Pulse's advantage isn't an offensive one in and of itself so it's not necessarily going to give him more kills, in fact he may get less because he's using it. The advantage goes to the defending team as a whole and as a unit the other members get more kills. I don't know if this is correlative or not but according to their stats defenders beat attackers by a significant and consistent margin on average. I'm sure there are other factors than just the HBS that go into that of course, but I would wager it's no small factor either."

Rainbow6,35v2h1,trineroks,1 point,Thu May 14 01:16:22 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree with you 100%. I'm So glad they took time to actually let fans know they are listening to us and are going to fix things. I wish we could get a specific date for the beta though.
Rainbow6,35v2h1,guaponese,1 point,Thu May 14 01:16:12 2015 UTC,This is good news indeed. I still wish we had doors but I may be picking this title up now (but first I'll need an xbox one to play it on!)
Rainbow6,35u9ut,ShadowgateKDA,5,Wed May 13 15:47:13 2015 UTC,"I am very much behind this post. I will be buying this on Xbox One. I have no problem with PC, it's just that my core online gaming group which is comprised of real life friends and family don't have gaming PCs, but they do all have Xbox Ones so that's how we'll all play this. (As long as it becomes a little less Call of Battlefield than it is at the moment) I hate the idea that console players want everything dumbed down and easy. Nope, I want depth and challenge. I hate the other misconception that console players are impatient and prefer fast paced gameplay and get bored with anything that moves too slowly. Also NOPE. I'm sick of being spoon fed shallow, easy games populated by caffinated kangaroo gameplay mechanics that require twitch reflexes to survive. But that's what we're given on consoles. It sells, not because that's all console gamers want, but because of a LACK OF OPTIONS! Stop spoon feeding us the same ole drivel. (Speaking to game developers as a whole, not necessarily Ubisoft's team working on Seige ((though if you do, then you too!))"
Rainbow6,35u9ut,iceycat,3,Wed May 13 16:24:06 2015 UTC,I completely agree with you on the console player misconceptions. I will be buying the game on PS4.

Rainbow6,35td8j,Deosl,3,Wed May 13 10:36:24 2015 UTC,Hearing about the Alpha feedback would be pretty significant though. I think that info should be released prior to E3 so it doesn't clash with those news updates or drain the hype from them if released after. Just my opinion though.

Rainbow6,35rylq,thehypotheticalnerd,6,Wed May 13 00:37:01 2015 UTC,"I like character customization too. My main focus is on having a good, highly replayable PvE co-op experience that is tactical and fun first and foremost. Even more than uniform customization though, Id like to see gun customization. Something like what Ubisoft did with the amazing ""gunsmith system"" from the last Ghost Recon game would be perfect. I'm personally not a fan of pink and purple uniform camos but if someone else's day is really made by it, whatever. What would be cool to bring back from Vegas though was that option to combine any camo pattern wirh any color scheme to make your own custom camo. That was cool. Again I wouldn't mind if they kept it to certain color combos only, but that's just me."
Rainbow6,35rylq,iceycat,3,Wed May 13 01:58:09 2015 UTC,"Oh for sure, I agree. I want a fun tactical shooter to play TH in with my friend. We love the Vegas TH but there are things we both wish were better (e.g. the enemies spawning rather than already being on the map is a major issue for us as is the fact that they're basically a hive mind and just know where you are practically at all times. It's frustrating.)  My hope is they combine the Enemy Density options of the Vegas games with the environment destruction they showed in the E3 multiplayer demo, and smarter and more realistic AI -- enemies who will lose you and stuff. I also want them to not know you're there until you get into a shootout or use an explosive or whatever. I want to be able to sneak down a hall, look under a door, note the enemy positions, place a charge on a wall and detonate it to kill one or two enemies as my partner opens a door and lays down fire on the remaining guys -- can't do that in the Vegas games as the enemies come to you because again, they just magically know you're there.  And I also hope TH gives us different objectives. Imagine if you could select one or more objectives to customize the mission further:   [x] Kill every terrorist [  ] Disarm bomb(s) [  ] Rescue hostages [  ] Hack computers/gain Intel Enemy Density: Low, Standard, High Time Limit: On/Off Respawn: Off, On, Infinite, Revive Only Enemy Types: All, Shielded Only, Shotguns Only, Automatic Only, Shielded Excluded, Shotguns Excluded, Automatic Excluded"

Who has actually come forward as liking this game? Because I've only seen overwhelming pessimism about it and people complaining about the problems they have with the game. If Ubisoft wants this game to be successful, they need to actually listen to the community rather than use the alpha as a rubber stamp for ""we released it, so they must like it""."
Rainbow6,35qme0,Ramgolf12,-2,Wed May 13 06:20:05 2015 UTC,Because the feedback you've encountered is anecdotal and limited to this subreddit. I imagine they are drawing from the post alpha surveys which were more positive.

Rainbow6,35qme0,ShadowgateKDA,0,Tue May 12 20:22:08 2015 UTC,"Future soldier had a lot more problems than a generic mp that led to its quick flop. I personally couldn't get behind the controls. Sprinting felt like you were on a motorcycle with the handling. That's a deal breaker for me. Fluidity and good 1:1 input is the core to any good shooter in my opinion.   Don't get me wrong, though. I would love for this game to steer clear of ""reminding us"" all of other modern shooters already out. But honestly I felt in alpha the core idea of the game was a refreshing change from what's currently available, even if it's not a picture perfect version of r6 that the diehard r6 community wants."
Rainbow6,35qme0,punjistick,5,Tue May 12 20:44:24 2015 UTC,Play cod SnD or BF Hardline Rescue  mode if you like the alpha.It is not a R6 game or feel.

Rainbow6,35qme0,punjistick,6,Tue May 12 21:23:43 2015 UTC,"That's unfortunate, because it means they'll keep beating this dead horse instead of finally coming out with a new Rainbow Six game that is based on the original first 3 R6 games.

Then we'll have the long awaited Beta/Demo and this IMO will seal the deal for this game, and I'm gonna say it here so I can bring it back up.....this game won't break 3 million"
Rainbow6,35qme0,DWAY22,5,Wed May 13 05:21:29 2015 UTC,"If they truly have a heavy emphasis on replayability that could be true. People are still playing Raven Shield to this day. What kept the older R6 games so replayable for me was the randomness of PvE modes. You could play the same map over and over and the terrorists were never in exactly the same spots. You never knew where you were going to find them. It didnt get stale. Now that's Raven Shield I'm talking about, in Vegas they had the three terrorist spawn wave trigger system which completely broke this aspect of replayability for me as there were never more than 3 tangos on the terrorist hunt map at a time and then when the next three were triggered after the death of the first three they would spawn in somewhere behind you in an area you had already cleared. That was LAME. Hopefully Seige does it better.  I also hope Seige doesn't make PvE modes where the bots mimic online players like CoD bots do in private match. I would much rather they mimic real soldiers who patrol or stand guard etc. As opposed to online player bots who run around and rush and spray gunfire while strafe dancing, etc.  If they do it right it could be VERY replayable. It's all about how much randomness they put in. Random terrorist start positions, random patrol routes, random encounters (in Raven Shield they occasionally surrendered or would occasionally throw grenades or occasionally have AP or JHP ammo or BP vests, etc.) Random objectives and random objective locations would also add A LOT to replayability as well. The more ways they find to inject random variation into gameplay the more it won't feel like you're playing the same map or mode over and over.  Imagine playing a PvE mode of Bomb Defusal with a random timer on the bomb where it was usually 3 minutes, but every once in a while it was 4 or 2. You'd really feel the pressure on those rush rounds and you'd really be able to take your time on the longer ones and strategize more. Imagine playing a mode with objectives that changed or moved. One time you play a mode and you have to sneak in and bug the phone in the office without triggering an alarm before your first kill. Next time there's trip lasers guarding the office. Next time the phone target isn't the office, it's the bedroom. Next time your objective isn't to bug a phone it's to hack a computer and one time it's a desktop computer in the reception area and next time it's the laptop on the 3rd floor suite,  etc. Nothing about the map actually changes but where you go to fullfill an objective and what that objective is could be random everytime. This requires little to no modification on the map designer's part. Just make 6-10 such variations for any given map using assets that are already present in the map. All assets are dormant except for the randomly selected one (s). Now mix in random enemy placement and patrol routes. You would truly never play the same game twice!"
Rainbow6,35qme0,iceycat,5,Tue May 12 18:48:54 2015 UTC,"I have a bad feeling that UBI is just pushing Siege for this years release to keep those shareholders happy and to ensure cash flow for the company. They've delayed ""The Division"" and also got a third studio to work on it. It's pretty clear that ""The Division"" is their big hit of a game that they are pooling resources into, whereas Rainbow Six is probably going to be another ""generic FPS"" where even the game with such a fantastic concept will have playability for a few months then popularity will taper off due to lack of content/support. It will still generate X amount of cash because FPS games are the most popular amongst the general. Dissappointing to see but then again i'm excited as all hell for ""The Division"" and understand there's a finite amount of resources to go around the company. Sorry tactical shooter fans, but if I were you i'd save the stress and stick to Insurgency for the next year."
Rainbow6,35qme0,JIMMAAH,2,Wed May 13 01:08:30 2015 UTC,I would say a game like the division would need to pool in way more resources than a game like siege. To create a big open world like that.. just saying

Rainbow6,35qme0,Randomerpro,6,Fri May 15 03:54:02 2015 UTC,"Replayability?  This game doesn't have what it takes to garner a following.  Being forced to play certain Operatives will ruin it for new players that want to play a weapon and gadget over and over to learn it.  The reduced player count from 8 VS 8 down to 5 VS 5 and having only one objective instead of 2 gives the game a lot less depth than previous R6 titles.  There is also no way they will release mod and map tools for this game, which, in addition to not having the problems mentioned above, is what kept Ravenshield replayable for many many years.  Nope..sorry...bargain bin title within 2 months.  It appeals to a NICHE of the COD crowd that wants to play on smaller maps and be limited to 5 VS 5 CQB...and can tolerate not making their own loadout from all available guns and gadgets."
Rainbow6,35qme0,Pest_AWC,4,Tue May 12 19:11:26 2015 UTC,"While you bring up some good points, try to remember we've seen exactly one PvP mode so far. We don't know what the other PvP modes will be, we don't know what the co-op PvE modes will be and we don't yet know what the campaign will be. We also don't know what changes they're making to the game based on Alpha feedback. Granted the fact that they called it positive feedback has me worried,  but there's also a lot of unknowns here too. Like you, I'm worried but I wouldn't go so far as to say ""abandon all hope"" either."
Rainbow6,35qme0,iceycat,4,Tue May 12 19:46:46 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter what we see, since they are going down this path.  They won't have more complex modes with 2 objectives, or they would  have done it that way with Hostage.  They can't set up a server with both complex 8 VS 8 multi-objectives and 5 VS 5 single objectives.  You would have to kick players when the rotation gets to the smaller game type.  Even if they fix some things, they won't abandon this lame Operatives thing that they have put so much work into.  They use it to justify over-powered gadgets because there can only be one per team.  Then they claim it will promote players to play as a team. It won't do that, so the entire concept was flawed from the beginning."
Rainbow6,35qme0,Pest_AWC,3,Tue May 12 20:27:57 2015 UTC,I do agree more freedom of selection would be better but I'm not sure I truly feel it's that negative of a impact. I think if there is just more selection of weapons allowed the locked devices wouldn't be that awful.
Rainbow6,35qme0,punjistick,1 point,Tue May 12 20:38:40 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with this as long as the gadgets are all well balanced. If any are too OP in relation to the others that will be an issue. Right now it seems like Castle and Pulse have OP gear as compared to others on the defensive side. At least for attackers between breaching charges, grenade launchers, thermite and grenades you have a good variety of fairly evenly powered gadgets that sort of accomplish the same thing in various ways. Also it will be interesting to see how the as yet to be revealed 10 additional operators change things."
Rainbow6,35qme0,iceycat,1 point,Tue May 12 21:27:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but I'm sure it wouldn't take much feedback or data collecting to find out if there is a gadget EVERYONE always wants, which would probably implicate a tweak needed (like you said).   They may never ditch the operator locks, but there's no reason we might not see closer device balance and more weapon variety per class.   Even grp, for example, has been ""crossing"" classes with their weapons. Allowing one class to pick up the weapon role of another one."

R6 Seige has only one hostage but more places you can put it. That seems better than CoD S&D from your example.  Or am I missing something?

Rainbow6,35qme0,iceycat,1 point,Wed May 13 21:26:29 2015 UTC,"Only one bomb, but like CS:GO having two places you can plant it means the defender has to protect two places simultaneously. So you have to place two guys on each site, one in the middle, attackers can fake an attack on one bombsite to draw the lurking defender before striking the weakened defenses of the other site, etc.  With only one place to attack/defend in Siege you lose a huge element of that teamplay - combined with the defenders having very limited flanking options (can't go outside) it makes a very static and straight-forward push into each other."

The two most popular systems are just levelling up (which I think is R6Ss current system) and skill based levelling. Outside of CoD nobody cares about an arbitrary levelling system and  even within CoD they only care because they want to hit the level cap, everything in between is meaningless and it's just a time sink. Skill based levelling I believe it would draw more people in to continue playing because as humans we want status.   Maps. Maybe it's just me but I see some of these maps getting really repetitive and teams going through the motions each time.   Psychological hooks. Many new games use addictive methods to keep players playing like a slot machine. R6S has none of that. Maybe if it had a slot machine to unlock specific camos then there'd be some incentive."

Rainbow6,35q6zo,sniperwhg,8,Tue May 12 17:09:06 2015 UTC,"What ""Community"" are they talking about?  Were they polling the COD Community?  I am sure they received lots of positive feedback from the free Alpha for those that got in it.  Everyone loves a free Run N Gun game.  The problem will be the expectations of fans of the R6 series won't be met, and those are the ones that actually BUY the game.  The COD fans will ignore R6 and get the next COD game."

Rainbow6,35q6zo,RealityKing4Hire,2,Tue May 12 18:33:38 2015 UTC,"...and you think they can make these changes in what, 4 or 5 months?"
Rainbow6,35q6zo,dinger0375,1 point,Wed May 13 14:30:27 2015 UTC,Why not? How much time does it take to remove hitmarkers or tweak movement speeds or accuracy and recoil values which are procedural? There's mostly a lot of little tweaks like this. As much as I would love doors I'm not expecting those in that time frame as much as I would like them. Also remember they've been working on these changes for weeks already now so who knows how much progress has been made and which things are actually going to be changed versus which are not. Am I naive enough to think that all the changes I want will be taken care of?  No. But I do hold hope that an average of the most common issues the majority of people have will be. Also remember there were things going into the Alpha that they said they were working on before the first day of the Alpha. They told us they knew the hearbeat sensor needed to be tweaked before we even played it. They said they knew they were not putting in ammo count and handling the way it would be in the final game but they did it that way just for the Alpha with some specific data mining in mind. So some of our concerns were being worked on before the Alpha even started.
Rainbow6,35q6zo,RealityKing4Hire,3,Wed May 13 15:29:48 2015 UTC,They also said they were going back to the roots of R6 and we got a run n gun arcade mashup so pardon me if I don't believe them. At least with Vegas they admitted they wanted to create a game like the TV show 24.

The whole reason the game blew up at E3 was because Ubi showed a slow paced tactical FPS for us to get out hands on, and now they changed it into Call of Duty. Why would we want something when we were hyped up for something else? If it continues down its current path, I won't buy this game.

Rainbow6,35je23,autowikibot,7,Mon May 11 05:58:47 2015 UTC,I agree the Alpha was not what I was looking for in a Rainbow Six game. My hope is that they have made some changes based on the feedback they have gotten.
Rainbow6,35je23,tyhopkin,8,Mon May 11 02:23:09 2015 UTC,"Back to it's roots is sort of a generic statement that is hard to pin down. That means different things to different people. Where my disappointment comes in is two fold. Aspect one is the movement mechanics. Things like strafe dance shooting and drop shotting plus an overall movement speed which is simply too fast for a R6 game. The second aspect is how much the game deviated from it's own E3 presentation. So many things were either stripped down or changed entirely. The hostage went from being a living, breathing character you cared about to a human shaped flag for capturing. You can't move said hostage anymore either. The sniper overwatch is missing entirely from the demo. The defenders were able to go outside to hunt the sniper down without being automatically lit up for the attackers to see when they took out said sniper. Rappelling insertion from helo was removed on the house map. Helo surveillance was removed as well. Graphics are nowhere near as good as it looked in E3, lighting/weather/dynamic environment are all simplified as compared to the E3 demo. Movement speed is faster than the demo showed. As well as the addition of hand holding aids like hit markers, grenade and fire indicators and magical xray team outlines.  The fact that they deviated so much from even their own initial presentation is what I'm disappointed in. Yes, it's an Alpha right now,  I get that. I also hear people say that you can't expect an E3 demo to be representative of the final product. Why not? If you show people the game you're making and then you strip that game down, you're now offering a different game than the one you got people excited about in the first place. Maybe that's just me though.  If it really was an Alpha thing and the final product does wind up being pretty much what the E3 demo was, I'll eat my words happily. Hopefully the willingness to listen they have brings the game mechanics back in line with the pacing we saw then. And hopefully the other elements were just not there yet due to Alpha issues. We'll see..."

Rainbow6,35kw30,Deosl,3,Mon May 11 10:23:35 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that almost every person on here that has the point of view that you're attempting to lampoon back up their positions with detailed explanation on why they feel that way. They support their arguments with fact or example when relevant and give explanation of their feelings when it's just a matter of opinion. The vets of R6 tend to skew a little older than the CoD player's perspective you seem to be representing. Since they are older in general they tend to think things through a little more clearly and are able to make more intelligent and detailed statements. I see almost no one who criticizes the game for having CoD like gameplay mechanics writting in Lolz Sk8tR talk or whatever that impression is supposed to be.  In fact it's the smaller group that seems to have the counter position that the CoD mechanics are great that seems to have a harder time making a good case for their position. Most of it seems filled with statements that point out how the popular opinion on the subreddit is wrong or stupid but don't really substantiate why. The arguments seem to devolve into name calling and insults such as stating that people are being ""whiney a$$ b!@$es"" etc. The most vocal veterans and/or active subreddit community members who share this common position don't tend to stoop to that belittling level.  That's why these kinds of things get down voted. I respect differences of opinion,  but when people reduce it to name calling, insults, mud slinging and sarcastic lampooning I have no respect for that. We're trying to have a decent community in this subreddit where we share our thoughts on Seige both good and bad. The minute people get insulting though is the minute you lose respect. So yes, this community WILL downvote this kind of thing every time it rears it's head."
Rainbow6,35kw30,iceycat,2,Mon May 11 15:46:01 2015 UTC,Well said.
Rainbow6,35kw30,Brethon,-2,Mon May 11 16:58:05 2015 UTC,"Laughable, I've lurked this subreddit for a long while and what you're saying just doesn't ring true. Some people do back up their arguments, but it's usually with bias about why the shooter must return to its roots. There is absolutely no consideration that millions went into this and that a hardcore shooter doesn't have a snowballs chance in hell in the current multi-platform market. I'd also challenge your assertion that people here think more clearly, if they did they'd see there is zero chance this project is going to go back to the good old days of Ravenshield, not to mention half the people on this subreddit seem to have trouble reading and writing: The sheer amount of spelling errors in almost every post here is frankly shocking, the likes of which I have never seen on any modern CoD forum, like Denkirson or even gamefaqs.   The case for a more casual R6 is very simple to make iceycat, and the case is that the game will make money. That's it. As mentioned above there are millions riding on this, after licensing, distribution and other costs they will also have to pay millions in development costs. And even after all that they may not break even. You may not like it but safe bet games like R6Seige make money, they make money because they are familiar to different kinds of players.   Also please refrain from trying to take the moral high ground, every dissenting view on this subreddit is downvoted into the dust by the salty veterans here, that's why they don't need to challenge anything, because they are destroying all discussion on this subreddit. The vast majority of posts of people disagreeing or from people who are excited for the game are polite and they still get downvoted. So get some sense of perspective and realise the veterans on this board aren't the knights templar, they are more like the witch hunters of the spanish inquisition."
Rainbow6,35kw30,iceycat,3,Mon May 11 16:15:22 2015 UTC,"No one is expecting Raven Shield 2 per se, but Ubisoft is the one that said they were taking Rainbow Six back to it's roots. That was their words. So what were the last couple of games that you would need to go back to the roots from? Vegas and Lockdown. What difference was there between those games and the core games that came before those? An attempt to mainstream and open accessability for a wider audience. So when we see these things pop up like hit markers, etc. We say, hey wait a minute, that doesn't look like going back to Rainbow's roots. That looks like a step in the opposite direction. But that comes down to a matter of opinion. Maybe I don't like hitmarkers and you do. Maybe I don't like being able to do sprinting drop shots and strafe dance ice skate shooting, but you think that's awesome. That's fine. You however are saying if people were thinking clearly they would ALL see there's zero chance of the game succeding unless it's done the way they're doing it. Okay. That's your opinion. I feel it's over generalized and way too black and white. But I guess that's MY opinion.  As far as spelling errors go, so what? I get that proper use of grammar and spelling conveys a better argument and makes a person sound more intelligent. Truly I get that. However if someone misspelled something it doesn't mean that they don't still have a valid point. I misspell things all the time. You know why? It's not because I'm unintelligent or lazy, it's because I can't type on a computer since my work I.T. department has blocked access to reddit so I have to type everything on a 2.5"" cell phone screen with my pinkie finger. Doing that, spelling mistakes WILL be made. I catch as many as I can but they still get by. My points are still relevant none the less.  As far as taking the moral high ground...well I don't find it that hard to do when people are calling other people names or making fun of them because I don't do that. Witch hunter? Mmm no, perhaps Paladin since I stand up to bullies whenever I find them."

Perhaps also counter hack enemy surveillance and replace it with an endless video loop or something cool like that!

Rainbow6,35em92,n0ra,2,Sat May 9 16:56:07 2015 UTC,"Ah, guess I misunderstood that. I hope the reason we haven't seen the other 10 specialists yet is because they have abilities like this but they haven't revealed them yet because the abilities would reveal game play mechanics or modes they weren't ready to talk about yet. For instance a demolitions expert with a bomb defusal kit or something. It was mentioned somewhere that sniper/marksmen where part of the yet to be revealed specialists as well, I forget where that come from. I think it was quasi leaked or maybe just hinted at or something."

Then scrap what they've done and start again with the correct direction and use an engine that can handle the options needed...like working doors.  It's pretty easy.  Expensive and time consuming, but easy.  It's better than coming out with yet another R6 game that has chosen a completely different direction with the series to add to Lockdown, and Vegas' crazy directions."

Rainbow6,35elb8,ayylmao358w38,12,Sat May 9 16:18:58 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of other fun games but like siege  they do not give us the feeling that only rainbow has given us over the years.If I just want fun I will just play cod they have more features, maps,bigger community.  I will only buy rainbow if they remove running  and give us other modes that don't have classes. I want a tactical  experience  not fun."
Rainbow6,35elb8,ShadowgateKDA,2,Sat May 9 16:43:45 2015 UTC,"I hear you, but I think that tactical and fun go hand in hand, they're not mutually exclusive for me. I think that's the spirit of what you're getting at though. The game definitely needs a slower pacing. Between some of the movement mechanics and that silly 3:00 timer it forces faster game play than we would otherwise get in a R6 title."

Rainbow6,35elb8,ShadowgateKDA,17,Sat May 9 17:18:48 2015 UTC,Veterans (and I myself) dislike Siege because Ubisoft claimed it'd return to the roots.   EDIT: Also this account was made 2 minutes ago for the sole purpose of posting this?
Rainbow6,35elb8,trineroks,-13,Sat May 9 16:20:35 2015 UTC,Why does a new game in a franchise have to be exactly like the old game?
Rainbow6,35elb8,Deosl,14,Sat May 9 16:29:10 2015 UTC,I don't think anyone expect it to be a remake or HD remasters.   But at least carry on the core values that made the game unique and stand out from the rest.
Rainbow6,35elb8,geofurb,1 point,Sat May 9 16:31:50 2015 UTC,"What are the core values? This one is a thinking game. It takes brains. A lot of the shit you see in alpha is because literally everyone playing was a noob, so they just went around shooting each other. There were very strategic players out there, but they were few and far between. They won all the goddamn time, though."
Rainbow6,35elb8,Brethon,2,Mon May 11 00:16:13 2015 UTC,"I disagree. When I played it was the run-n-guners that would consistently win over anyone that tried to slow the game down.  Core values are all the things people are clamoring for:   Slower movement mechanics Lethal weapons with recoil No on-screen prompts/info (hit markers, damage indicator...) Doors and the myriad of options they bring Complete kit selection freedom All the other things that have been listed 100 times..."
Rainbow6,35elb8,geofurb,1 point,Mon May 11 17:02:21 2015 UTC,"Movement speed is comparable to the originals, those people are just goofs. Increased lethality and recoil are definitely big asks for realism. On-screen info like hitmarkers are also a big issue for realism. Doors suck in all video games, I don't know why anyone wants them; the barricades are a better mechanic. Complete kit selection freedom is available for the Recruit class; it's a class-system where you have specialized roles: think America's Army 2 (AA:O).  I agree that a lot of this stuff would increase realism and make it a much slower, more thoughtful game... That said, the thinkers already win. My experience was just that in alpha everyone was a noob, so when nobody has the brains to coordinate, the run-n-gunners wreck the other nooblets. Smart teams won, man, I promise you that.  All of the above notwithstanding, I'd still like a Realism mode, and I'd like whatever else to be labeled ""Action"" or whatever, not ""Normal"" or ""Default"". Let people choose for themselves which one is the regular mode."
Rainbow6,35elb8,trineroks,9,Tue May 12 00:49:07 2015 UTC,"Does it have to be exactly like the older titles? No. And I hope not because there were still some things that the old games were lacking (like competent AI, for example).   What I wanted personally was a tactical shooter. Not another watered down military shooter that we get multitudes of each year.   You're acting like it's somehow impossible to iterate on realistic and slow paced tactical gameplay set forth by the original trilogy."
Rainbow6,35elb8,chowdig,4,Sat May 9 16:34:55 2015 UTC,"Why does a new game in a franchise have to be exactly like the old game?   It doesn't. But when the developers claim to ""return to the roots"" of the series, you kind of of expect it to, you know, return to the roots of the series..."
Rainbow6,35elb8,iceycat,6,Sat May 9 23:53:25 2015 UTC,"Seige is good. And fun. But it is not quite a Rainbow Six game yet. It just moves way too fast and there's too many hand holding aids like hit markers grenade and fire indicators, X-ray outlines, etc. don't even get me started on strafe dance firing mechanics and drop shotting Bologna either. And doors, oi. Now, that said, this COULD become an excellent Rainbow Six title if they resolved most or all of these things. I do honestly believe Seige has the potential to become something truly great, not just the ""alright"" that it was in Alpha. We've all shared our concerns, most of us in a constructive way, now we need to see what they do with that feedback."
Rainbow6,35elb8,JonathanRL,5,Sat May 9 17:04:50 2015 UTC,"Rainbow Six: Vegas was different then the original Rainbow Six Games. Rainbow Six: Lockdown was different then the original Rainbow Six games. The series has had its twists and turns, not all in the original spirit. But these games have been honest that they strive away from the original formula.   Ubisoft has said time and time again that they are returning to the roots. Siege may be a good game - I was over the fence on that in Alpha - but as it stands it is clear that they are not going the path many old hands with the franchise have hoped. Some of us do not mind another spinoff title, but we do mind getting the truth about the game we are interested in - not something soothing that sounds more like what we want to hear."
Rainbow6,35elb8,nickwitucki,3,Sat May 9 16:41:50 2015 UTC,it's another generic COD type shooter. Might be decent enough but does not have same realistic elements of earlier titles. Right now it looks like SWAT 4 is the best successor well get to RvS. . . Yet.

I don't blame people however some of the hate goes a little far but for the most part fans are just let down. If ubisoft would have been upfront about the game and shown us what they planed on doing with the game fans wouldn't be so hurt. I might end up getting this game but not really for multiplayer. I most enjoyed terrorist hunt, with a friend, in every rainbow game.   edit: also esports for this game just isn't going to happen. This was also a let down, I was looking forward to a rainbow six game becoming an esport."

Rainbow6,35elb8,gsr1550,3,Sun May 10 09:08:25 2015 UTC,"For any esport you need dedicated fans that are willing to put in hundreds if not thousands of hours into this game. The target market that the multiplayer is aiming for is the casual gamer who usually has or wants to only play a few hours a week. I just don't see there being a big enough fan base for this game. If the game was aimed at the call of duty crowed it won't gain there attention long enough for the game to get competitive with a new cod rolling out every year. Also, I should clarify, when I say esport I don't mean like a couple LANs or a local tournament I mean something on the same level as dota 2 or csgo or LOL.   Edit: This could change but the game doesn't have much of a learning curve. Most of the big name esport games have a pretty decent learning curve."

For example:   Draft picking/one time picking/banning operators during a competitive best of series. Marking enemies or such for more planned take downs In game timers, e.g. breach in 3..2..1.., to ease up voice comm and encourage it in pub play   I also see a lot of potential in their class system and their drone/quick rounds system."

However if it's cosmetic stuff like camo skins or uniform/clothing etc. that would be fine. But I would be against better equipment that actually affects gameplay being locked behind levels. Also the levels should be spread out nice and far, especially in later levels in CoD AW I hit the level cap of 50 in 3 weeks, that game made leveling up WAY too fast and easy."
Rainbow6,35ciog,TheLucarian,2,Mon May 11 09:12:35 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming it's for ranking and matchmaking. I don't think it's for unlocks, the weapons seem to be limited by operator only and there was no interface for weapon attachments etc."

Rainbow6,35ciog,Pest_AWC,1 point,Sat May 9 03:29:09 2015 UTC,"Game balance, the best vehicle killing soldier should not get the (2nd)-best infantry killing weapons. Unfortunately EA's hardon for ""streamlining"" created many problems, the one applicable here is giving engineers carbines. It was bad enough in BF3, still bad in BF4.   I might have started with Battlefield with Bad Company 2, but still think BF2 is the best Battlefield has been. In BF2, AT and Engineers got shotguns and SMGs for close protection of the vehicles, no lonewolfing is encouraged when you needed rifles and ARs to move as a squad."
Rainbow6,35aytn,leteezer,22,Fri May 8 16:20:16 2015 UTC,"After having watched the live stream, I've come to the conclusion that this iteration of R6 is about as casual and CoD/CS like as it's going to get. The mechanics are the epitome hand holding. It makes the game very easy to play and therefore, intellectually unsatisfying. It is obvious at this point what market share this title is aimed at. Before everyone jumps on me and yells; ""It's not casual!"" Let's recap the stream we saw. Why equip a grenade in your hand and risk getting shoot in the process, if you can just push a ""quick throw"" grenade button? Why use iron sights and aim down them, if you have a big cross-hair and a arcade center screen firing mechanic when you can just spray and pray? Why conserve ammo and watch your fire, if you have a magazine ammo system telling you to reload? Why use your eyes and ears to see/hear where you being shoot at, if a arrow shows you the direction of the bad guy? Why use your eyes to confirm a kill, if you have a big pop-up to show you that you got a headshot, 100 points, +XP, a ribbon, two medals and 500 +XP for just being awesome. Moreover though, the issues below that certainly lead to the aforementioned conclusion. 3D HUD icons floating everywhere Skull/kill icons Giant cluttered HUD Floating points and +XP pop-ups Giant crosshair Vapor trails for rounds/bullets A kill feed Big hitmarkers Friendlies highlighted through walls Grenade icons A quick grenade system Stance position icon Hit indicators A reload warning icon Ammo pool system Super fast ADS And many, many more. That's about as casual as it gets to be perfectly honest. All of the previous Ubi commentary about realism and the tactical aspects, well, that was nothing but their typical PR whitewash."

They sound great for Single Player to show the different members of the team you can play or control.  I want to play ""Pest_AWC"" and not ""Mute"" and have access to any weapon and gadget in the game...you know...like every past Rainbow Six title.  Don't start the ""But this is better because it forces people to play as a team and each with a different needed gadget"" crap.  It didn't in the Alpha.  Not once.  Forced operatives do NOT ""force"" anyone that doesn't want to play as a team to play as one.  Those who do play as a team are going to do it even in a system where you can choose any weapon or gadget.  It only pisses off players that want to play a certain gadget and can't get it because they didn't click fast enough, or do get it and are restricted to a weapon they don't like.  Players can also choose the ""recruit"" class, and then they don't bring any of the so called ""needed"" gadgets to help the team.  So no, it does not help to force Operatives on people.  As a new player especially, I want to try the same gadgets and weapons multiple times in a row.  You can't do that in Siege.  Even offense and defense are restricted to just certain ones, so you have to completely play a different character every friggin round with the Operative system.  F it...give us back the freedom in Multiplayer to have our OWN name, our OWN armor/headgear selection, the gadgets we want to play from ALL gadgets in the game, and the weapon we want to use from every weapon in the game.

Rainbow6,34y42k,Pest_AWC,21,Tue May 5 15:00:43 2015 UTC,"Most gamers don't want a pre-named pre-defined look and load out. They want Their Name, Their Look, Their Favorite weapon appropriate for the job, and Their favorite Gadget. This isn't an arcade game where you put in a quarter and have to pick a pre-defined character to play quickly. This is a PC or Console Game where you want to create YOUR character.   I completely agree with you. I definitely think they are making a mistake by not letting us create our own character."
Rainbow6,34y42k,capedcrusader93,8,Tue May 5 16:35:22 2015 UTC,Well here's just an outside view for perspective: My brother was/is interested in this game and I sent him some notes from the early gameplay leaks. The one thing he pointed out was the lack of character customization. That made him a lot less excited but he's still optimistic. Still brings it up whenever the game is mentioned though.
Rainbow6,34y42k,SteveEsquire,18,Wed May 6 13:40:11 2015 UTC,"Yup, correct on all accounts. God forbid the day when the kid who hasn't played yet is supposed to play an important operator specific role- and then your team loses. Why couldn't the system of custo from Vegas have been kept?"
Rainbow6,34y42k,djdumpster,11,Tue May 5 15:48:20 2015 UTC,"I agree entirely. They want to force team play but as you have said it could end up having the complete opposite effect, especially when a large number of console players won't use mics to communicate."
Rainbow6,34y42k,Dan_Biddle,11,Tue May 5 15:30:34 2015 UTC,"Someone please show me a successful game with pre-defined characters and strict limits of one of each gadget per team?   Project Reality   Allows ZERO player customization besides your username. No patches, kits, outfits, paint jobs, or hats. Strict and limited classes with exclusive equipment, even going so far as to block certain classes when there's not enough people in a squad. You wanted an LMG or shotgun? Too bad, you only have four other grunts with you. Stick to standard-issue rifles and medics until you can organize or join a proper squad. Don't want to join a squad? Standard rifle ONLY and you might get banned on some servers. Limited equipment for the ENTIRE 50-MAN TEAM. You wanted to play an elite lone-wolf sniper and go around super-scoping all the grunts? Too bad, there's only three of those kits issued for the entire team and they take almost half the hour-long round to refresh. Not to mention you must have a squad lead and spotter with you first anyway. First-come-first-serve heavy asset rules on most servers. A few seconds too late creating a tank or CAS squad? Too bad, only the guys who joined that squad get to drive the big toys or fly the choppers, usually for the whole round.   Sound awful? And yet it's the most enjoyable strategic/tactical shooter game I've ever played, and hundreds of people agree with me. Sure, it's not thousands or millions, but the spiritual successor Squad is in rapid development and poised to take the tactical gaming world by storm before too long, and it's built on all those same principles."
Rainbow6,34y42k,caligari87,2,Tue May 5 23:13:03 2015 UTC,"HEY! In Project Reality you have around 20 pre-defined loadouts which differ per team. An there are like 10 different forces represented, also it's a realistic military FPS not a CTU closed quarters FPS.  Let's not compare it to the current situation we are cursed with."
Rainbow6,34y42k,ExploTheOne,2,Wed May 6 22:54:52 2015 UTC,"Sounds interesting, but definitely not my cup of tea.  Good example though.  I like the original balance of realism and fun that was struck with the original 3 Rainbow Six games.  Of course, your example helps prove my point.  If the only people that will tolerate the realistic and strict limitations on what you can equip are the hardcore realism fan players that like Project Reality, then those type players will have nothing to do with Siege and all of its COD style magical player crutches.  I don't think UBI thought this through very well.  Who is their target?"
Rainbow6,34y42k,RealityKing4Hire,2,Wed May 6 05:07:09 2015 UTC,"It's worth mentioning that Project Reality is a mod, not a game, and I seriously doubt UBI will give the modders the ability to create these types of mods."
Rainbow6,34y42k,iceycat,8,Wed May 6 15:55:42 2015 UTC,"Completely agreed. Now in fairness,  we don't know what the other 5 yet to be revealed operators per team will be, but I don't see that changing much of what the core problem is. Weapons and gadgets have certain ""personalities"" and compliment a given players game play in different ways. Example, my Dad is part of my gaming group online. He swears he can shoot best with the L85, it's ROF, recoil, and other characteristics fall in line for his style of play. This was in previous R6 games mind you, so who knows how different the gun will handle in Seige. Even playing other games that don't have an L85, he's always looking for the one that is the most like it. So Seige has one character that can choose the L85 (I forget which one) but if he's not fast enough to pick it before anyone else, he'll get irritated. I don't know what the special gadget is for the character that has it as an option, but whatever it is he better darn well like it because that's his only option. Now he could go recruit but the special ability there is faster reviving time, not a gadget. Lame. So he loses out on a special ability if he wants this specific gun he loves so much OR he gets locked into a specific gadget whether it compliments his playstyle or not. My dad is 57, his FPS reaction speed is half mine, he prefers to play in ways that keep him in the back of the group because rushing and spray and pray isn't his thing. He'll happily stick on a breaching charge and blow the wall to let others go through but he won't be the tip of the spear as he prefers to support. You could argue reviving people is support but you're left vulnerable to do it and it isn't as fun as using powerful gadgets. After not getting his load out a time or two he'd look for a different room. If it kept happening in other rooms he'd just quit.   Once you develop a rythm with certain weapons or gadgets that fit the way you prefer to play, you don't want that taken away from you. I can completely understand that. I feel the same way."
Rainbow6,34y42k,punjistick,6,Tue May 5 19:54:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly, and great points with a real example!  I am the same way as your dad.  I used to play nothing but the M14 and wish it were in Siege.  People made fun of me because I would even take it on small maps with tight areas where everyone else was spraying with a Mac11.  It didn't matter though, I knew how to control the M14 and could use it in any situation just fine."
Rainbow6,34y42k,punjistick,8,Wed May 6 04:56:48 2015 UTC,"As someone who hugely values the potential for team play on this game, I couldn't agree more with the OP.   Players will play as a team if that's what they want, and plenty will (and plenty won't, too). No amount of forced class restrictions will make this team play ""better"". That basically comes down to attitude from the players, and how well the team actually works together.  Players should--At the very least--have access to whatever weapons they want, even if there are certain restrictions on the gear (don't need a game of everyone running heart beat sensors, for example)."
Rainbow6,34y42k,Deosl,7,Tue May 5 21:23:12 2015 UTC,"You never had everyone running around with Heartbeat Sensors in Ravenshield, and it was available to all.  Usually one or two would take it.  If the don't overpower it like it is, and give it some drawbacks like longer time to equip/put down and block your vision, as well as allow access to more countermeasures like a portable and/or placed jammer, then everyone taking it won't be an issue.    That is a valuable inventory slot it uses up."
Rainbow6,34y42k,capedcrusader93,1 point,Wed May 6 04:39:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed there could certainly be balance implemented to ""deter"" all players from taking the same things. I guess I mean a good step in the right direction might at least be letting players pick whatever weapons they want, and slowly work on device balance. The weapons all perform very similar as it is, so why not allow players to use what they prefer. This hardly impacts gameplay."

Rainbow6,34y42k,TheLucarian,7,Wed May 6 19:43:11 2015 UTC,"I disagree with your point about RO2. At it's heart, RO2 is trying to be as close to a WWII simulation as possible while still being a game. You didn't get to choose whether you got a Garand or a BAR back then, you were assigned them. Offense in that game would be impossible if everyone on defense could choose to pick up MG42s."
Rainbow6,34y42k,LuciusNexx,-4,Tue May 5 19:50:14 2015 UTC,"My point about RO2 was that it failed to gather enough fans because of that system.  I was one of the ones that left because I didn't like playing with a lame gun while someone else had a much better one.    Striving for realism is fine until it takes away too much of the fun.  In Ravenshield, the Devs specifically said they left out things like Bullet Drop because too many players thought the net code was bad when they aimed and missed.  They had to draw the line on that one to keep from losing too many players."
Rainbow6,34y42k,shastaXII,5,Wed May 6 04:42:52 2015 UTC,"At first I kind of liked the idea, but now that I have heard what you have to say I think I have changed my mind. League of Legends has lots of problems, one of which is role calling and toxic behavior associated with ""I didn't get mid so now I am going to feed."" I can see this happening in siege as well. ""I didn't get the sniper so guess what, you are all now 4v5. Hope you enjoy losing."""
Rainbow6,34y42k,StrelokMarkedOne,2,Tue May 5 20:26:36 2015 UTC,"But then again, a league match can get up to 40+ minutes, with a downtime of 10+ minutes between games. In Siege a round is max 3min and after that you can choose again. Also champions in league are worlds apart and you just have to specialise in a few to be good. In Siege the difference is minimal compared."

Rainbow6,34y42k,forzaitalia458,3,Wed May 6 07:51:58 2015 UTC,"Ro2 is one of the only online FPS games that actually makes team-work common with randoms.  You're absolutely delusional and have never played the game. The game simulates WWII and roles. Rifleman are always in supply and specialized roles serve specialized purposes that are important to their role, so people take it more seriously. Comms is used heavily and commander/squad leader communication is extremely active. No other game that is a FPS can come close to the level of teamwork and communication on a random scale that Ro2 brings.  Utter ignorance."

When they finally got it stable, most of us quit playing because it's ultra-realistic gameplay with bullet drop and spin coupled with only a couple people getting the much better weapons killed the game for us.  The quick drop in player count after those first two months shows exactly what will happen with Siege.  I am glad you love it and that type of game, congrats on being in the minority of those that played RO2 that stuck with it."

Rainbow6,34y42k,TheLucarian,2,Tue May 5 20:47:07 2015 UTC,"Battlefield didn't limit classes.  Sure it limited the weapons and gadgets within the classes, but the classes themselves were not limited.    Insurgency does, but there is a lot of crossover between the classes with respect to weapons and gadgets.  I can pick 10 different classes and still be able to create the same loadout."
Rainbow6,34y42k,TheLucarian,1 point,Tue May 5 21:11:52 2015 UTC,You are right. These were just the first examples that came to my mind that limit choice in some form.
Rainbow6,34y42k,ExploTheOne,2,Tue May 5 21:30:02 2015 UTC,None of them are that limited compared to siege's current state.
Rainbow6,34y42k,CSKarasu,4,Wed May 6 23:02:52 2015 UTC,"while I agree with what you said for the most part (especially about character customization and guns), you can't deny 5 people running around with hammers or 5 ppl with thermal breach, or 5 ppl with heartbeat sensors would be pretty retarded. thermal breach alone, why would people need to barricade the walls up if everyone had thermal breach, people would just stop doing it making it a waste of code.   with that being said. i don't see why we can't make our own character then just select the gadget we want at the beginning of the round. of course people will still rush but at least you will have your custom guy/gun you want (although I didn't mind being forced to use a shotgun sometime, as it changed gameplay up a bit. the autos on the other hand all felt the same to me)"
Rainbow6,34y42k,geofurb,4,Tue May 5 21:01:42 2015 UTC,"But the only reason people would run around all with the same thing is if it was over-powered.  They just need to balance things better if they will drop the Operator system and limits.  Every previous R6 game allowed you to choose from everything and there wasn't a problem.  If a team is all taking the same thing, then that's their fault when they lose and they better adapt next round."
Rainbow6,34y42k,NotAValidName97,3,Wed May 6 05:01:55 2015 UTC,"But the only reason people would run around all with the same thing is if it was over-powered.   That's not the point, balance is a necessity in any system. The siege gamemode is very very reliant on the tools that the operators bring to the fight, if you don't have a variety of tools you might have lost the fight before it's begun. (Examples: no emp to disable the jammers, so you can't use the breaching charges - or even worse: no one brought breaching charges, duh. 4 of 5 brought the armor gadget because they wanted the extra armor, now your team lost 3 valuable gadgets for the fight. Etc...)   If a team is all taking the same thing, then that's their fault when they lose and they better adapt next round.   But don't you see it, that's part of the appeal of the operator system: If you play with a bunch of randoms, the game enforces that your team will have at least some utility (edit: and no redundancy) in the fight so you are not completely out of options against the other team. If you play with a premade team, everyone get's to play the operator he wants to anyway."
Rainbow6,34y42k,sonoblink,3,Wed May 6 08:15:48 2015 UTC,"The game can try to artificially force this all it wants but it doesn't work.  I played through the entire ALPHA period, and you still end up with nobody having the right tool because either the person that took it died, didn't know how to use it since it was forced on them, or they weren't where they needed to be to help.    When anyone can take a tool, you have a greater chance of having the important tools and those that take them know how to use them.  I just don't get how suddenly ever past Rainbow Six game was wrong, and they've suddenly had this amazing revelation that they can force teamwork."
Rainbow6,34y42k,NotAValidName97,0,Wed May 6 13:30:26 2015 UTC,"[...] it doesn't work [...] nobody having the right tool because either the person that took it died, didn't know how to use it since it was forced on them, or they weren't where they needed to be to help.    Now you are really fishing for arguments here. This system is not supposed to guarantee success for your team, but that you have a set of tools to work with. What you are arguing with could just as well happen with a free choice system.    When anyone can take a tool, you have a greater chance of having the important tools   That's just not true and it feels like talking to a stone wall, so I will only cite forzaitalia458 who replied to you two comments above: you can't deny 5 people running around with hammers or 5 ppl with thermal breach, or 5 ppl with heartbeat sensors would be pretty retarded.  Also you are saying:   [...] didn't know how to use it since it was forced on them   It was a one week alpha, what did you expect everyone to be experts within two hours? Play this game for a few days and you will certainly know all the stuff. It's not magic we are wielding here, emp grenades, breaching charges, gas grenades etc.. it's all pretty self-explanatory.   I just don't get how suddenly ever past Rainbow Six game was wrong, and they've suddenly had this amazing revelation that they can force teamwork.   No one is saying this?!

The fact that most of the examples of other games using forced Operatives are hardcore, or completely different genre of games makes me wonder why people think it will work for FPS players that like the sweet spot R6 has between casual and hardcore.    I've polled my old R6 clan and they have no use for Operatives, but hey, maybe enough hardcore fans will love it to make UBI money as long as those hardcore fans can put up with the COD style elements.  I just don't get who UBI is targeting with this.  At least they are consistently upsetting someone.  Last time with Vegas it was those that hated a more casual game with magical 3rd person cover view, random colored team mates, and health regen...like most fans of the original 3 games couldn't stand..."
Rainbow6,34y42k,TotesMessenger,1 point,Fri May 8 21:18:08 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with you, while I am extremely hyped for this game there are a few things wrong with your argument. While I would love to customize my loadout and how my character looks, the custom loadout is where the problem lies. If everyone in game got to choose what they will carry into battle this can set teams wildly apart. An example would be on the rainbow team, no one wants to play as the breacher because everyone wants to play an assault role, now you've just lost a a tactical advantage since your enemy can easily predict where you will come from and easily defend these positions. Yes everyone wants to play their own style but this game is focused on teamwork thus the roles should be fixed with little differences in each loadout. The problem is many of the players that come to this game will be from thr fps genre, thus a lot of cod players that don't understand tactical gameplay (not all but most, I don't want some bitching 12 yr old screaming in my ear that I'm a noob in this game because he got killed and is claiming I didn't assist him) so there's a distinct offset of players already, most people will come to this game expect fast paced action and in reality its supposed to be a tactical slow paced shooter. They honestly have this game going in the right direction with the operator system because it forces a player to assume a role to help their team and if they don't well expect to lose a lot."
Rainbow6,34y42k,Prais,3,Wed May 6 12:56:47 2015 UTC,"If nobody wants to play a Breacher, then this new forced Operator approach doesn't change that one bit.

It is rare that I saw team games where someone didn't take something that was needed...and if people hate the breacher class, then they need to tweek the game to not need it as much."

There weren't 100 snipers running around on the battlefield, they were few and far between. The majority of every infantry force in WWII was a standard rifleman, and that's how it is in RO2. In a standard German infantry unit, as far as I know, the only person carrying anything other than a K98 or G98 was the NCO who was carrying an MP40.

Ok, so what does that have to do with Siege which is targeting COD fans, or, if we can get them to, could someday target R6 fans that preferred the balance between realism and fun like the first 3 R6 game had."

They did it with RO1, and there was no reason not to do it with 2. Verdun is doing it, as well. WWII Online: Battleground Europe also did it in a rather interesting way. Not to mention Project Reality as well as the upcoming Squad, although there are a TON of classes to choose from, they are limited, and sometimes they aren't available to certain factions, as well as the fact that when someone dies with that kit they aren't getting it back anytime soon; there's a long timer until they can get that kit again."

Rainbow6,34y05e,Djaquitchane,6,Wed May 6 08:36:18 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the whole point of this whole operator thing is to set a background for a pro scene and an easy way for newcomers to follow it. Basically, it creates a ""pick and counterpick"" environment and it also gives easy terms for shoutcasters to spit out fast (saying Twitch is a heck of a lot faster than saying the attacker with the little zapper drone, same goes for Smoke and defender with remote controlled gas traps or even Mute and defender with settable jamming devices) as well as for players to communicate about with eachother. Since every Operator has his particular set of items and guns, if you hear a teammate tell you that say ... Pulse isn't with the other defenders, you'll know that a guy with potientially an automatic shotgun and C4 is roaming around the place at an unknown location is able to tell his teammates your whereabouts.  So, basing myself from this, and knowing all the things this allows for, I'm fine with the Operator system, although I agree that the names could/should be different but they're pretty transparent so for a dude totally out of context that stumbles upon a pro league stream (if there happens to be a pro league) he's not that lost with who does what. And if he comes stumbles again on that same stream a few weeks later, he'll easily remember that Castle = fortified defensive place = dude with the heavy defences, Slegde = sledgehammer = Dude with the sledgehammer that blows through walls, Mute = forced silence = dude with the jammers."

Rainbow6,34xzao,Pest_AWC,13,Tue May 5 14:21:06 2015 UTC,The biggest problem is hostage rescue is just kill the other team. I find it hard to believe the other team can grab the hostage and escape without wiping out the other team. The levels are extraordinarily small and it's far too impossible to hide for long periods of time.  I feel they've just developed the modes in a hurry and didn't think any of them really through that well. It'll turn into a 'control this doorway' style of play.
Rainbow6,34xzao,haynick31,2,Tue May 5 14:27:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  It turns into just ""kill the other team"" because there is only one single point of interest, the single hostage.  If you had 2, you would not only have fights at those two locations, you would have fights break out between the two locations as players try to go back and forth.  8 VS 8 becomes possible and wouldn't seem crowded.    They need to also turn off the auto-detection of defenders that leave the building, to allow flanking and greater use of the entire map."
Rainbow6,34xzao,haynick31,3,Tue May 5 15:08:57 2015 UTC,I honestly thought they could leave the house after the 'preparation' stage. That's ridiculous.  Essentially it just makes it easier for the other team to know exactly where you are. So depressing.
Rainbow6,34xzao,tyhopkin,1 point,Tue May 5 15:22:45 2015 UTC,"I think ""just kill the other team"" is a legitimate tactic and having a 2nd objective, rescue the hostage in this case, helps to keep the game moving.  However, the problem is that both objectives should have an equal opportunity to be completed.  Currently, rescuing the hostage does not make sense but this is because the maps are tiny and defenders are forced to stay in a little box."
Rainbow6,34xzao,nickwitucki,5,Tue May 5 21:19:53 2015 UTC,"I've played CS a little and while it allows for high level and depth of play, I always thought R6 siege should have been closer to SWAT 4 than it (SWAT 4 VIP games were some of my fondest FPS experiences).

Rainbow6,34xzao,turtsmcgurts,2,Tue May 5 20:44:04 2015 UTC,"they only showcased one game mode, so who's to say they won't add a game mode with higher player counts? i wouldn't count it out even though they defended the 5vs5 model. most FPS have done this (ground war in COD for example). and Counter Strike is only 5vs5 in competitive. they have 10vs10 casual, go play that and you will quickly see why 5vs5 is better for competitive play. It's a damn cluster fuck with less meaningful moments (like 3vs1 scenarios, where the one guy take out all 3 guys to win the round). So I don't see how they are copying counterstike since I don't see a 10vs10 option or arms race or team deathmatch (yet)."

Of course the rest of my argument is just plain logical on the differences between 1 or 2 objective points and how it affects play...but you can ignore it.  I doubt you have anything constructive to add to that conversation.  Edit: I did just watch some youtube strafing tutorials for CS...I see where they have to stop for a blink of an eye to fire, so I must have missed that part when I played the game and people just appeared to be still moving."

I wouldn't consider it fast or slow, but defiantly slower than the mainstream FPS. CS competitive did it right, it would be good if they copied some aspects from them."

Hopefully they're able to sift through all of the over emotional bullshit and skepticism and actually recover some decent feedback, of which there is plenty.   Until that happens there really isn't anything to talk about except what is already known about the game, particularly from the people who played the Alpha.  As you can tell there's a lot that people didn't like.  While I agree it is not a CoD/BF/CS clone, but it's much more similar to those games than it is to R6 1, 2, or 3.  If we wanted a comparable game to CoD/BF/CS, we would just go play those instead of waiting for Siege?  But to answer your question, no i have not written this game off.  I am cautiously optimistic."
Rainbow6,34zwrb,tyhopkin,5,Tue May 5 23:18:23 2015 UTC,"Cautiously optimistic is a perfect phrase for it. That's where I'm at as well.   I always enjoyed the previous r6 games, but I'm also very open to ""new"" and changes. I personally don't have a huge issue with a game that carries some hybrid mix of cs mechanics, r6 aspects and game modes, and bf destructible environments--which seems to be sort of the balance the alpha felt like.   Apart from the expected alpha bugs, of which there were plenty, I was pretty pleased with the gameplay. The recoil was the only thing that really struck me as offensively low and ""cod-like"". Otherwise the movement and everything was slower even than cs, but the pace of the games are fast and deadly. I still felt plenty of appeal as an r6 fan, but some of the accustomed ""comforts"" of the more modern shooters.   Csgo did a great job creating a ""new"" game from cs1.6 but still appealing to the cs crowd. Agreed, r6siege feels significantly more different from previous r6 games, but I don't necessarily think this has to automatically default to being a bad thing."
Rainbow6,34zwrb,trineroks,2,Tue May 5 23:26:50 2015 UTC,"Why do you think CS GO appealed to the CS crowd? The core gameplay's stayed more or less consistent throughout all of its titles.

If they did, they never would have gone in this direction with Siege since none of the talk in their own forums wanted anything like Siege.  After the big Lockdown failure, they created a special forum made up of just the top contributors, representatives of R6 clans, and fan web site admins.  They ignored absolutely everything they said and went the opposite direction by creating Vegas with it magical 3rd person views, health regen, aim assist, and multi-colored non matching uniforms that made it so you couldn't tell who was on your team.   You'll have to excuse me if I don't believe they will listen now, because this is still UBI Montreal leadership in play here."

They could just not use the Rainbow Six name on it, and there would be no expectations.  Vegas may have been a great game to those that like a less realistic game with 3rd person views and that other stuff...great...but it had nothing to do with the Rainbow Six line of games or books.

Rainbow6,34zwrb,RealityKing4Hire,1 point,Sat May 9 03:43:16 2015 UTC,"But yeah bro, not a console gamer. In fact, I loathe the console experience and what it has done for the fps genre.   I'm also just not a die hard r6 fan either, so I guess that leaves me more objective than many. I'm just in search of a quality shooter. I can make a list about plenty good among plenty of shooters, but likewise there is enough I don't like about many of them to where I haven't found that one game to just swear by (like back in the days of cs1.6).  I think this game has great potential. Maybe not to be the perfect raven shield 2015 version, but to be a great, fun, new team-based game without the flingy sprinty feel of cod/bfh.   If you notice, I've made many a csgo reference....that would fairly well indicate what platform I prefer. (not sure who actually likes csgo on console)"
Rainbow6,34zwrb,sonoblink,1 point,Sat May 9 03:54:06 2015 UTC,"I wasn't trying to start another console vs PC war so I apologize for the confusion. I just don't understand how you can say the Vegas games were awesome on PC. Hell you can't even play Vegas 1 online anymore, and 2 has so many gamebreaking bugs it's not worth 5 minutes (the gun loop bug and broken hardcore mode come to mind). You couldn't even host a dedicated server until a few members of the community (myself included) created the .bat files that allowed you to have a standalone server. The very next day UBI releases a patch with a  huge announcement for dedicated servers like they did all the work and never gave the community credit for anything."

You could aim your crosshair just outside of your targets head and still score headshots all day. Health regen and standing on a medpack are 2 different things. Who gives a fuck about pink camos?

You actually liked your team looking like a bunch of multi-colored (and sometimes pink) mercenaries instead of wearing a uniform that matched the rest of your team?

Rainbow6,34zwrb,ferpo_the_great,2,Thu May 7 07:11:01 2015 UTC,"I think very few people have actually ""written this game off"" What you are seeing is people who love Rainbow Six, but are VERY worried about go with the mainstream flow mechanics like hit markers, magical xray outlines , poor weapon balancing, fast movement mechanics like strafe dancing and sprinting drop shotting, etc. If these things don't change we're collectively worried about our beloved franchise turning into the next Call of Duty lite. I'm excited about what this game ""could"" be. But also understand that it's a lit different than what it ""was"", even from the E3 demo. Where it is now is not quite where we want it to be, we know it's Alpha, we're nit talking about polish and bells and whistles.  We're talking about core mechanics like moving, shoiting, hud, environmental interaction, etc. Do I love what this game could be? Yes. Am I happy with the direction it was in the Alpha? Nope. If it's our voices complaining about these issues that get them to move it more in the direction that most seem to want it to be, then complain away. Influence the change you want. Don't complain just for the sake of complaing, but do it respecfully and constructively. Be the squeaky wheel that gets the grease. Otherwise if the game comes and you don't like it, but didn't speak up when they asked your opinions and feedback,  then you haven't got a leg to stand on."

Rainbow6,34zwrb,sonoblink,1 point,Fri May 8 16:35:10 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of us who are still optimistic about it to a point. Right now, it -IS- a COD Clone more-so than a CS:GO. The Game play and speed in CS:GO is actually slower than both COD and Siege (At the moment). There are a good amount of us who aren't upset that the game is different than the older series but we have been blatantly lied to thus far with the 'Going Back to the Roots.'  There is nothing in Siege right now besides the Name and the hap-hazard load out system that is 'Back to the Roots.' As it sits right now the only 'Roots' we will see are on specially customized servers that might not even be apart of matchmaking which means finding groups on reddit or with your friends will be the only way to play this game the way it was announced.   Some are wanting a updated Rb6 1/2/3 and very very few are wanting a new Vegas (Dear god no, I enjoyed it but it wasn't the best), than there are those of us who want a NEW game that is BASED and PLAYS like its Roots. Look at CSGO Again each game held the same playstyle but was different. Unlike COD Where the most things that changed were the super jumps and boosting movements. Everything else has pretty much been the same with a few different tweaks in the COD. Don't believe me Track down the Leaked IW3/4/5 builds that have hit the internet. Every single one of them were copy pastes with barely any changes to the modality which in part is fine but come on, its been the same game since MW2 just about.  So yes, a good amount of us are waiting to see how the polish is, as well as what the Dev teams do based on our feedback. Yet again this -is- Ubisoft. They have a track record of bringing people in to discuss and get views/ideas on where to take a game and it gets completely ignored (ALA Vegas and GRFS) so some of us are skeptical on how it is going to be. Do we complain? Yes. Is it always constructive? No, after a while of screaming at a wall you get kind of tired of it yeah. Saying that this isnt an Arcade clone thus far is foolish to say. It shows lack of depth in understanding and versatility of being able to critically view it as what it is. I am probably the biggest R6 fanboy here and its scaring me what the game is right now. I was sorely burned by GRFS and Phantoms so I am worried about my Favorite shooter series of all time getting thrown into the same heap as Ghost Recon all because its not done by Activision or says Call of Duty in the name. THAT Is what Share/Stakeholders are looking for a COD Game that can over turn or even take a wiff of the sales that COD Does which have been declining the past couple of years. So instead of taking the chance from the get go with a Legitimate R6 title we got the Alpha for Siege which was completly different than advertised. Also, dont go 'But it was alpha!' I am not talking about bugs. The Alpha that was released is a show off to see where the game is thus far. Take a look at marketing to see where the game is going. Operators, No Doors, Very VERY limited weapon choices (Look at the Operator Releases/Graphics for proof). lack of customization, and a shitty recruit class. THAT Is the game thus far. Very VERY Far from the roots of R6."

It became pretty apparent (to me at least) from all the footage so far that despite their claims they're departing the Rainbow Six franchise. They're upscaling and modernising for a larger market, trying to appeal to the mainstream FPSer and the Counter Strike fans. Heavy focus on PvP and competitive play to mirror competitive gaming and appeal to streamers and tournament fans. Why else would there be no mention of Terrorist Hunt at this point? It's clearly one of the most enjoyable and most replayed aspects of the game.  And as for doors... what is Rainbow Six without doors?

I'm seriously hoping there will be openable doors in PvE co-op modes and single player. There's just no reason not to. Maybe it's like the newest CoD where half the exo suite abilities didn't translate over to multiplayer and a lot of features were stripped down from campaign or something?  I don't know. We can only hope that doors will be present in other facets of the game. Until they show us more though, it's all just speculative."

Rainbow6,34r8o3,CSKarasu,4,Sun May 3 22:59:53 2015 UTC,"because they are bad game developers and don't understand the gameplay implications of having doors, door breaching shotguns, optical cameras, door breaching charges, dynamic breach and entry ai mechanics, and things of that nature. instead we got barricades r us, wall charges mart, walls that collapse after being shot by an mp5 a few times, and watered down michael bay gameplay to cater to ""a broader audience"" aka the death knell of originality and intelligent game design."

Rainbow6,34qd3e,Colinski282,1 point,Mon May 4 11:33:03 2015 UTC,It's an indication that Siege is not true to the R6 name which left people wanting a game true to its spirit.  It's Ubisoft's fault for making this Frankenstein crap of a game and calling it R6.  Now the disgruntled fans are sharing games they hope would be a true spiritual successor because they have lost hope in this game.

I came here for a specific reason. there of tons of gaming sites and their own subreddit for them to talk about it all they want, and in many forums those posts would be redirected to the right sub-forum where they belong. would you guys be ok with me posting about the black ops 3 teaser? saying how I rather play COD than SIEGE. what benefit would that be to development of seige?"
Rainbow6,34qd3e,iceycat,4,Sun May 3 20:24:09 2015 UTC,"Then what would you say regarding the development of Seige? We've all been speaking our peace on that topic up to,  during and since the Alpha. We're in a waiting game now to see what new infi they'll give us next or if they'll talk about feedback results, etc. We've kind of all said what there is to say regarding things like hitmarkers and movement mechanics and gun handling, etc. It's a slow time right now.

You should have complete control over the load out and look in MP and Co-op and not have to play some mostly pre-built character that you don't want to play but were forced to because you didn't pick what you wanted first.  That entire rush to pick if there is someone else that likes the same character you do sucks, and sours the MP experience to the point of leaving if you get on a team with people that prefer your favorite.  I saw this a lot later in the ALPHA once people had a favorite."
Rainbow6,34ewrr,Pest_AWC,5,Thu Apr 30 18:14:05 2015 UTC,I'm really disappointed that we aren't going to be able to customise our own character. I was hoping we would be able to create an operator and customise their load out as well as their tactical clothing.

Rainbow6,34ewrr,Pest_AWC,7,Thu Apr 30 18:44:15 2015 UTC,"That is eventually what I did because of the frustration of fighting for the specific operator I wanted.  The problem is, if one of those specific operators has a gadget I prefer to play with, I can't.  It was especially annoying as a new player, when I wanted to choose a specific one over and over to really learn the gadget's pluses and minuses.  You get forced to another operator or the generic if nothing is left that you want."
Rainbow6,34ewrr,TheLucarian,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:47:18 2015 UTC,"Remember, this is a team game, you are supposed to communicate with your team about the tactics you are going to use next round, meaning also who pics which operator. And there are going to be 10 to choose from on release, if you still insist on playing that one operator every time, well yes, you might have to play reserve sometimes.   I personally didn't experience any ""fighting"" over specific operators in the alpha though, but then again,  everyone was a little clueless ;)"
Rainbow6,34ewrr,ExploTheOne,5,Thu Apr 30 22:23:30 2015 UTC,"You can't always evade fighting, there will always be players who just rush an operative who has something OP.  I want to use a loadout and abilities which i prefer the most, and not to be limited at all."
Rainbow6,34ewrr,TheLucarian,-1,Thu Apr 30 22:48:14 2015 UTC,"Look, out of all the issues with the game, I see this as the least useful to discuss at length, because a) I think you are a sissy if you whine about this (sorry) and b) it's a core mechanic of the game which won't be changed. It might be more fruitful to join Pest in his door crusade ;)  Also I'm pretty sure if one operator is clearly OP, they are going to balance him, just like they did with Pulse (you may argue not enough, but that's another story). I played the alpha and no operator stood out from all the others, and therefore everyone had enough time to choose."

Rainbow6,34ewrr,TheLucarian,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:41:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah well, I personally would suggest to concentrate on few but important issues at this point in time in the development of the game, instead of hammering on every tiny detail.

Seriously though I think doors are a worthy issue. The operator class thing isn't too big of a deal for me personally as I don't play with randoms, I only play with real life friends and family so sorting out who picks what will be a non issue for us as we coordinate well together. I do realize many people do play with randoms though so it may be a bigger issue to them."
Rainbow6,34ewrr,Pest_AWC,2,Fri May 1 00:20:46 2015 UTC,"This is exactly the biggest reason it will be an issue that impacts the game for the majority.  While I have a small group I play with and could possibly control what I get to chose, I also play regular public matches and am less likely to play those in a class I don't need or want to play.

Rainbow6,34ewrr,Livinpink,3,Thu Apr 30 18:36:22 2015 UTC,"Noice to see all the detail you guys have put while designing the operators! Was extremely exciting to read through the article, especially the nerdy details like, ""... generating a split second surge of 12500 volts per meter in nearby electronic devices ..."". Good job!  A quick question (if you are allowed to answer): Why is that it is operators vs operators, rather than operators vs terrorists / bad-guys?  P.S.: Another quick off-topic question: Will there be day and night versions of the same map in R6:S?  P.P.S: Please make it a true R6 game by listening to the veterans of the community! :)"
Rainbow6,34ewrr,Strikerrr0,5,Thu Apr 30 16:32:28 2015 UTC,"Glad you enjoy the article & Operators!  CTU vs CTU was already the case in previous Rainbow Six games. You never got to play a terrorist in Rainbow Six. It's how it has always been and there was no reason to change this for Rainbow Six Siege.

Rainbow6,34ewrr,Pest_AWC,6,Thu Apr 30 16:55:28 2015 UTC,"But in the past, the teams at least had different camo to differentiate them. It was a bit confusing in the alpha when everyone was wearing black tactical gear. Maybe have one team in black and the other in multicam or something"

My only hope is for a few server side options but that won't be enough to get my old R6 clan to get the game.  Maybe on the next iteration of Rainbow Six you will have a Lead Developer with the balls to truly take Rainbow Six back to the roots of the first 3 R6 games and not pick yet another new direction the fans don't want.

Rainbow6,34ewrr,Deosl,5,Thu Apr 30 17:15:03 2015 UTC,"With regards to the EMP grenade, you'd probably do better to suggest it's powered by next-gen supercapacitors (graphene, silicene, whatever the 2D-Ge material is called) than localized ""fission reaction"". The critical mass for Uranium and Plutonium are both way too big for a tiny little grenade, and you'd get an explosion in addition to whatever EMP, since you'd need to set it off all at once.  If we guess that ""localized fission"" means some sci-fi mechanism for channeling the neutrons from decays in a certain direction, you'd be able to circumvent that, but you're still getting mostly heat out of it. You could turn that into an EMP by making a small explosion to propel a bar magnet through a solenoid at high speed, but even then you're gonna get way more heat than you want.  Plus, don't supercapacitors sound way cooler? An array of supercapacitors discharging into a solenoid would be a far more realistic fiction for your EMP grenades.  Once that's set, the most unrealistic part is the metal case! You'd want a good dielectric so as to avoid attenuating the magnetic field coming out of the solenoid. Plastic might not look very cool, but if you make it glass, you could pretend it creates a very sci-fi blue flash when it goes off. (In reality, it won't; you're not going to radiate in the Terahertz range.)  This is totally unimportant, just thought I'd share cool physics with people since it's exam season and it's consuming my life, so why not yours?"
Rainbow6,34ewrr,Deosl,0,Thu Apr 30 23:17:23 2015 UTC,"(But really, focus on the game, ignore my little science rant.)"
Rainbow6,34ewrr,paolorey,2,Thu Apr 30 23:24:19 2015 UTC,I feel like this character seems a little weaker as compared to others like Sledge and Castle. Thrown grenades can bounce off target or have other strange things happen. (Like bouncing off a team mate just as they run in front of your throw) In addition to this you never really know if anything is actually in range of your blast or not so it can be a gamble on how effective it's going to be or if it will even be effective at all. Maybe he could have one EMP grenade and one EMP charge that could be placed similar to the jammer unit which would be slightly slower to deploy but have a larger blast radius or something?
Rainbow6,34fkog,Harvey_Dole,7,Thu Apr 30 18:57:45 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't think anything in the Alpha is final.  That said, you do bring up a good point. I don't really like the idea of weapon melees knocking holes in walls. Go take an MP5 or M4 or something and see how many shoulder stock strikes it would take you to knock a hole clear through the wall to be big enough to see and shoot through. I'm not saying it can't be done or anything,  but it sure wouldn't be practical.   Movement on the whole is the bigger issue though, strafe dancing side to side while shooting and still maintaining accuracy is a problem,  as is spriting into a drop shot. Strafe dancing and drop shotting movement mechanics need to be altered in such a way as to make these cheap loophole tactics impossible. They aren't realistic and they're cheap and dirty.  Sprinting needs to be nerfed as well. Maybe limited duration couple of seconds after stopping for accuracy to ressetle, no ADS while doing it and horrible accuracy if you try to fire while sprinting along with moderate to heavy screen sway. All this Call of Duty movement and shooting mechanics have got to be reigned in here and toned WAY down. Or preferably removed completely. Thank goodness there's no jumping or anything!"

Rainbow6,34enqk,shadow2k1,4,Thu Apr 30 15:00:39 2015 UTC,Only 5v5 for now. But 5v5 seems perfect in my opinion. It allow some slower combats and it allows to 2 or 3 players who are well organized to make a big difference in a round. Even if the rest of your team sucks.
Rainbow6,34enqk,Harvey_Dole,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:24:42 2015 UTC,"I can appreciate 5 VS 5 being optimum, but we really need 8 VS 8 for public play.

Just need to be able to utilize them before the spawn vote, though Deosl informed me you could re-vote after.  That part was never apparent to me.  Maybe break it into two votes, the first being drone spawn location or even better each player chooses where his/her drone spawns and then a 2nd vote for the spawn point(s) after the reconnaissance part is complete.  Also would much rather have two spawn points for the attackers.    Also what are those swinging things with the knobs on them? ;)"
Rainbow6,34atd5,tyhopkin,2,Wed Apr 29 18:34:46 2015 UTC,"I wish that you didn't have an infinate amount of drones when playing.

They have made a plan and they will stick to it no matter what even if it means the death of the franchise. Ghost Recon died with Future Soldier.

They don't really care, they will just create a new game with super graphic and average gameplay, take the cash and create another. Lost all hope in Ubisoft and it was my favorite compagny.

I would also like to see the implementation of the stick too, I don't see why this shouldn't be in the game, especially since one of the main maps is a house. I think a ""launch"" option for the drone would be neat too, like throwing a grenade, to be able to throw a drone through a window on the second floor or something. I guess it's kinda redundant for the game though since they can just run up stairs but meh, I like more mechanics."

Rainbow6,34atd5,Jonesy777,1 point,Thu Apr 30 13:38:39 2015 UTC,"Pre-round drones ruin the game, and MP playability needs priority, not realism.  Pre-round drones eliminate any point to finding a hostage. Everyone knows where the hostage is, knows that no enemies are inside certain areas and they CoD rush to hostage and a 5m radius fight breaks out. Cool.  This game will never be tactical and non-CoD if you allow players to scope out everything in advance. It ruins any element of surprise.  Give attackers a google earth like map view to vote and plan a route instead.  If you have to, let only ONE person have a drone. This current set up ruins the game. Many won't be getting it if it stays like this."

I doubt we'll see more operators from other countries. Just because the game is developed in Canada doesn't mean they have to include Canada. I'm sure they'll base a map in Canada or something :)"

Rainbow6,348hkv,adeipho,0,Wed Apr 29 14:12:55 2015 UTC,The alpha was a generic action shooter that wasn't as good as the dozen other games in that segment you could buy. What made Rainbow Rainbow was completely stripped out.  How good it is at release is of course still an open question. Wait for it to come out so you can read reviews and see what promises they keep.
Rainbow6,348hkv,FatalHydra,2,Wed Apr 29 15:55:47 2015 UTC,alpha was a barebones test of the game engine and net code.
Rainbow6,348hkv,RealityKing4Hire,-1,Tue May 5 08:29:49 2015 UTC,Yes.
Rainbow6,348hkv,FatalHydra,2,Wed Apr 29 03:27:09 2015 UTC,No. The TOS says you will be charged full price for the game the day the BETA is released.

Rainbow6,348hkv,tyhopkin,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:12:21 2015 UTC,"the part in the quotations was actually added just before alpha closed.

So blame the people who postd these exact same threads in the past"

Rainbow6,348hkv,tyhopkin,1 point,Wed Apr 29 23:00:28 2015 UTC,Where do u think the code Amazon gives u come from? Ubisoft. Amazon would be bound by the T0S of Ubisoft for distributing their game. Meaning if Amazon doesn't get paid then the code is useless. It still worth a shot though for people who want to try to skirt a payment. At worst the code wont work and at best it wil. Just dont get your hopes up.

Digital I believe it should automatically be on your Uplay account, physical should give you a code sooner or later.  2, Ubisoft has uplay, which tries to be Steam, so unless you preordered it on Steam, you can say goodbye to it, to ever officially be in your steam library."

But I gotta ask: while you could play a run-and-gun game tactically, why would you want to? Why not instead play a game that's more geared towards realistic mechanics in the first place if you want to play tactically? (And there are alternatives) Plus there's the crowd/community factor... It's not much fun if you're the only one playing tactically.  Think about it, if Siege doesn't go ""back to roots"", then there's no point to playing it. There's other games out there (and more coming out eventually) that have realistic mechanics that I can play tactically...   Anywayz... let's see if ubisoft can pull a rabbit out of their hat by Beta... I'm still hoping for the best, but that hope meter is down to like 10% (runnin on fumes right now lolz)"
Rainbow6,3422c6,GHOST-117,3,Mon Apr 27 22:21:04 2015 UTC,"Well, there are alternatives on PC, on consoles there really aren't any co-op tactical military FPS games right now. Things like Cod and Battlefield and Halo don't count, they're too arcadey. Hard being the only one of your close friends and family with a decent gaming PC, if I want to do anything co-op with them it's got to be on console. Which should be fine, there should be no reason more games like Arma, Insurgency, etc shouldn't be available on consoles too, but developers seem to think mature, thinking man's games are only for the PC crowd and when they do release a game on console the version is either dumbed down, or all versions are dumbed down in the first place with consoles in mind. There's no reason that should be the case, and yet it so often is :("

I got one of my console friends to finally try Insurgency and he immediately admitted that it was better then any console FPS he's ever played in his life. Just think, these people never even played the original R6 games... And forget about FPS's, what about all the strategy and simulation games they just have NO IDEA about... sigh... sad state of affairs man...  But whatever, there's much bigger problems in the world rite now then worrying about the world's gaming acumen lolz... but i can't help but think that this (trivial) problem is linked in some macro sense to the larger problems...

I care VERY much about PvE co-op multiplayer. I sure hope they don't go the whole ""mimicking real people - bots"" and decide to call that co-op terrorist hunt or something. I hate those kind of bots from Call of Duty that just mimick online players instead of bots that emulate real people doing real things like walking patrols and standing around talking, etc. Single player is very important though, I'm afraid it will just be sort of an afterthought with how much emphasis is being placed on adversarial multiplayer. It would be nice if in addition to co-op terrorist hunt, hostage rescue, bomb defusal or anything else they put in if you could ALSO play the single player campaign missions cooperatively as well. I'm also really hoping for doors in single player, I SORT OF get it in adversarial, (it's still stupid not to, though). I also wonder how the class system will play out in single player. Furthermore I hope single player doesn't devolve into the Seige/Fortification concept where every level in the campaign is essentially a ""map"" to be seiged, with perhaps the odd cutscene in between maps. I hope it has way more depth than that."

Tom Clancy games were best when they laid out all the objectives at the start of level and left the player to go figure out the battle plan. The linear waypoint hunting gameplay that has taken over both Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six series is so brain numbing that is not helped by the devs trying to cover up stale gameplay by spicing up with scripted events."

They were not a cinematic-esque scripted set of events that dictated almost every decision, route, and action the player made like in Lockdown and the Vegas series.    Here I agree! There were some scripted events, but it wasn't drama around every corner.  Look, before we head into an internet fight, I think we are somewhat on a same page. We certainly don't need another dramatic scripted tunnel shooter, but in my opinion there should be an overarching story line that connects the missions. Otherwise, why bother with a singleplayer campaign at all. Then they can just fill the maps with tangos and we basically have terrorist hunt."
Rainbow6,33y4en,TheLucarian,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:04:19 2015 UTC,"Maybe lose (although loose is the correct word) wasn't the right description and maybe ""simple points"" would be a better descriptor.  I did say there were connected, to what level is up to interpretation, but again the ""storyline"" was secondary to the SP experience and rather simple compared to modern day shooters.  It was about planning and completing a mission hopefully without losing a teammate.  There was no need for elaborate cut scenes or dialogue sequences.  The SP ""stories"" in the first 3 R6 games was very simple and to the point and the most fun I have ever had playing a SP portion of any game, although the stories themselves had very little to do with that.  Gameplay >>> Storytelling when it comes to an FPS.  My point is I would rather them not waste resources developing some elaborate story and all the filler material that comes with it, but instead focus on the gameplay."

Respawn tried some matchmaking fixes and finally private matches within the handful of months after launch then never revisited it.  The matchmaking system at launch was a joke at launch even when it had a much larger pool of players to pick from, it still unbalances teams with obliviously highly ranked and worse still prestiged teams against teams mostly made of Bambies.  Then to make problems worse, there was no offline singleplayer mode to allow new players to learn the mechanics of the game and practice offline before throwing them into the deep of adversarial small player count matches. Then again add in Burn Card perk collections to boost more experienced players."
Rainbow6,33sw8u,TheLucarian,-1,Sat Apr 25 10:40:14 2015 UTC,"Oh.  I'm so used to just pick another server if it's not fun, that this didn't really occur to me."
Rainbow6,33sw8u,jonowee,1 point,Sat Apr 25 13:03:44 2015 UTC,"The matchmaking system for the Siege alpha wasn't really matchmaking, it was first come, first serve to fill server slots. There better be an actual matchmaking algorithm for the beta and launch, and a server browser. Without a server browser, means no custom servers for harder rules or modded servers for shits and giggles.  I'm not sure how long I can keep playing a game with only matchmaking and no server browser. Isn't COD in 2015 still matchmaking only? Or did they fix that at least for the PC version of COD:AW?"
Rainbow6,33sw8u,TheLucarian,1 point,Sun Apr 26 00:57:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe some rudimentary ping based matchmaking.   Honestly, I don't think we are going to get a server browser anymore. The CoD comparison is repeated way to often, but I think regarding the overall focus of the game, it's true. CoD is just extremely popular on consoles and that is a market that ubisoft hasn't tapped into yet. And no, afaik Cod:AW is still matchmaking only, and unfortunately this is not going to change, because 95% of their sales are on consoles. And this is why we are going to get matchmaking only in siege, with maybe some private p2p hosting with custom settings. I would be more than happy if they prove me wrong, but I'm sure, at that point of development, if they'd plan on adding a server browser and private hosted dedicated servers they would have told us already."

But the AI will check their six from time to time Yes, they suffer the following:    Killed In Action = Dead, not available Incapacitated = Injured, but will return after a few missions Slightly wounded = gimped? (Not 100% sure)   3 Should be possible to give everyone a hold command and give 1 squad go  4 Should be possible?"
Rainbow6,33ra4o,Deosl,3,Fri Apr 24 22:04:56 2015 UTC,"1) You cannot set the direction you men face yourself. The direction they face depend on the number of men per team:  1 man will walk forward and periodically check his rear.  2 men has one man facing forward and another facing the rear.  3 men has one man facing forward, another facing the rear, and the middle man leaning over the point man's shoulder facing forward.  4 men has similar configuration as the 3 man squad.  2) Incapacitated means the operator is not available for the next 2 missions. Slightly wounded means you can select them for the next mission, but they'll stay at Half Life and stay gimped. They fully recover after 1 mission.  3) There is a hold all teams command. I forget the actual key, but it exists. I've used it on occasion in hostage rescue missions.  I should also bring up that you can perform coordinated moves on the fly without using the go-codes in the mission planning phase by utilizing the ""Zulu"" go-code. Tell your teams to stack up on a door, flash and bang  (or whatever) on Zulu, then give the Zulu keyword (I think it's the ""."" key).  4) You can definitely save loadouts for future missions. I think they're saved by default."

Rainbow6,33ra4o,tyhopkin,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:10:56 2015 UTC,If I remember correctly you hold the LMB when playing a way point and rotate it using the mouse. It should show a firing arc for the direction.
Rainbow6,33ra4o,trineroks,1 point,Fri Apr 24 22:36:27 2015 UTC,"That doesn't actually change look direction though. It's really only a tool to help you see the environment around that waypoint.   Try it out. Turn the camera around a waypoint, select another waypoint, and go back to the previous waypoint. It'll just reset back to the default camera positioning."
Rainbow6,33ra4o,jonowee,1 point,Fri Apr 24 23:16:51 2015 UTC,"trineroks covered almost everything so I'll just add little tidbits.  1) Yes and no. There is no direct way to orient NPCs to strafe or point their weapon on the move. They are very tunnel-visioned on their next waypoint; so you can either serpentine the path or you can use a truck load of Go codes and set the next waypoint to the direction you want them to face. Another variation on the Go codes workaround is using Sniper waypoints that let you set the person with the heaviest gun (sniper>battle rifle>(MMG>LMG>(I don't run MGs enough to remember how tier with rifles)assault rifle and carbine>SMG>pistol) face a direction independent of the the next waypoint that the rest of the fireteam will be facing, the marksman or pointman (depending on the guns in the fireteam) will fire in single fire or try to singleshot MGs  3)   H will halt and resume all teams. R  will allow you to halt or resume the fireteam you are currently playing with independent of the rest of the teams. You as Red cannot control the other teams Green or Gold like you can with Ghost Recon. T is your sniper waypoint ROE control for all teams.   4) Loadouts are saved together with mission plans per map or level. So if you want to save different loadouts for the same plan, or different plans for the same loadout, you'll need individual saves for each change in loadout or mission plan on each map. Enjoy the 20(?) character limit for save names. I think the core of your question is whether you can transfer loadouts presets between maps, not in this game."

Rainbow6,33pni8,TheFireMarshal,6,Sat Apr 25 00:10:59 2015 UTC,"okay, first: FBI has SWAT teams, and the HRT. FBI SWAT teams are stationed at each field officer. FBI HRT is brought out for certain situations only.  FBI SWAT and HRT do counter terror operations while SWAT does strictly search warrants for the PD.  SWAT is for barricaded subjects, high risk warrants, etc.  FBI SWAT is for even high risk warrants / active shooter situations / counter terrorism operations / plane hijackings I.E Boston Bombing FBI SWAT would be out and about along with the PDs SWAT.  FBI HRT is for counter terrorism hostage rescue - they do international work now too I think."
Rainbow6,33pni8,Sterling__Archer_,9,Sat Apr 25 00:42:29 2015 UTC,SWAT doesn't use hitmarkers :)
Rainbow6,33pni8,1Bravo,3,Fri Apr 24 15:53:37 2015 UTC,"Probably because FBI HRT is a little more ""elite"" than the SWAT team or High Risk Warrant Service of some random city's police department or sheriff's department or whatever."

Rainbow6,33pni8,Whiplash9212,1 point,Fri Apr 24 14:19:39 2015 UTC,"My guess would be that they did this to generalize where the operators come from. For example, the SAS represent the whole of the UK, GIGN Represents France, and FBI represents all of USA as opposed to specific state/city police departments."
Rainbow6,33pni8,Ah0te,3,Fri Apr 24 14:21:15 2015 UTC,"No it's because each of those work counter terror/hostage rescue mission for their country on their soil.  GIGN does CT / HR for france, SAS does it for UK, FBI SWAT / HRT do it for US."

Rainbow6,33pni8,Ah0te,1 point,Sat Apr 25 14:50:45 2015 UTC,The question is  - why no SEALS?
Rainbow6,33pni8,7unguska,2,Sat Apr 25 17:19:31 2015 UTC,Navy SEALs are a part of the US military and like the Green Berets or any other JSOC unit they have no authority to conduct operations on American soil. the FBI is a federal police department that does have authority to do CT and HR operations in the US. It's a similar reason for why the CIA conducts almost exclusively foreign operations and the FBI runs domestic CT ops

Rainbow6,33p56n,hoverfish92,4,Fri Apr 24 10:40:43 2015 UTC,"On the official Siege Alpha forum, Livinpink detailed a post that said they were going to focus on making custom playlists that would allow hitmarkers, HUD elements, and player outlines to be disabled, thus allowing a pseudo-hardcore mode. This answered two questions simultaneously and effectively:   Hitmarkers and player outlines CAN BE DISABLED. There will be no player hosted servers, only playlists that can be modified by a session host.   They're not exactly the answers I wanted, but the writing is on the wall. Every single hitmarker post that popped up on the forum, I tried to link to that thread because it was a concrete answer, but the community clearly doesn't want to accept it as such.  EDIT: Here's the snippet:  Will there be a more hardcore way to play the game? New settings and modes will be elaborated on as we approach the Beta later this year. Simon Larouche, game director, says: ‘We already embraced a more realistic approach in our game mechanics. By default, we don’t have aim assist, nor health regen and friendly fire is ON.’ For those interested in disabling HUD elements, it will eventually be possible to disable them locally for yourself (no matter which mode you are playing) through the options. It is in our current plans to also allow custom session hosts to disable HUD elements for everyone participating in the match. This includes hit markers and teammate highlights. Simon added that depending of the community’s needs, feedback and desires, new playlists could eventually be made available in order to create new experiences.

I understand from a technical standpoint this is easier said than done when programming, but it may be a solution to consider.""    It's not exactly what a lot of us want, but if we had no choice I could deal with this."
Rainbow6,33p56n,IHaveNoFiya,3,Fri Apr 24 13:52:07 2015 UTC,"There was no health regen in the closed alpha. Once you took damage, there was no way to get it back. When you entered DBNO (incapacitated on the ground) You can crawl or hold your wound to stay alive, but if you're brought up by a teammate, your health will still be greatly depleted. So it's a second chance, but not a fresh one."

It was a minuscule amount. Besides, in my experience, you needed a very specific set of events to happen in order to reach dbno, which didn't happen very often for me. Besides, when you're down, you're completely helpless; all it took was a couple extra bullets at the guy on the ground and you'd be dead for the round."

If they are going to divide the community anyway, that best way would be to have a ""hardcore"" mode, with most or all magical crutches turned off, and have this mode well tested for balance.  I would also want completely custom servers, but at least this way the majority would be playing either casual or hardcore."

Rainbow6,33qq7h,adeipho,7,Fri Apr 24 18:57:13 2015 UTC,"old school r6's limitations were from its age. The ai was literally brain dead and required the player to setup their pathway, how they aimed etc etc all pre-play. Ravenshield fixed some of this by making it more dynamic with you being able to order your team on the fly in-game. The fact that ravenshield had a brilliant leaning mechanic, full door movement and damn good gunplay far outweigh any of its issues. You forget that the devs promised us an r6 game being based and built off what ravenshield setup. And if they can't meet the hardcore expectations the least they can do is give us something original and unique (like all old school r6's) instead of this cod wannabe garbage we're currently complaining about."
Rainbow6,33qq7h,Gotohellcadz,6,Fri Apr 24 19:26:44 2015 UTC,"I remember the fault of Ravenshield...It didn't switch sides on objectives so you were always defending or attacking for the entire match.  It looks like Siege fixed that, but left out all of the good stuff from Ravenshield.  No sense in repeating that list.  It's in every huge complaint list about Siege."
Rainbow6,33qq7h,Pest_AWC,3,Fri Apr 24 19:57:23 2015 UTC,"I am not just remembering the good parts, however all I want is a newer version of the previous game and all the bad shit like the AI fixed. From what i've seen so far Siege is a step back from the tactical shooter genre. So that's why I will keep suggesting the good parts from the old games."
Rainbow6,33qq7h,happytumor,5,Fri Apr 24 20:59:41 2015 UTC,"Oh no, no, no. I don't look at the first three Rainbow Six games through rose-tinted glasses, there were plenty of problems both technical limitations of the era and being the pioneering game in the genre that the devs had to figure out new systems to evolve with. But what you could see was an active  effort in the game design choices that forced tactical play, and ignore so called ""modern features"" that were around the time.  There is difference between modern features and stupid features, that alone or in combination with other features that break the game."
Rainbow6,33qq7h,jonowee,-7,Fri Apr 24 22:18:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the majority of people with complaints are looking through those rose-tinted glasses, that is the objective of my post to get them to remove them."
Rainbow6,33qq7h,Tango167,2,Fri Apr 24 22:49:19 2015 UTC,Sure there were some flaws in our games. But those flaws are not going to be addressed by stripping the very fundamentals of what made us love the originals.  Anyone buying or supporting this kind of garbage from letdown till now is uneducated about what a good tactical shooter should look like. Probably because they play exclusively on a console.  For the record I have Rogue spear and ravenshield still installed and played them as recently as last week. No rose tinted glasses here pal. This game is shaping up to be another heaping pile of junk.

I'm not basing this opinion solely on the alpha but rather the marketing ploy of returning to the roots of rainbow six, then taking this angle instead, as well as the past titles since ravenshield. Believe me after letdown and the Vegas games. I wouldn't be here for round 3.  I'm still here hoping to read that they have taken our comments to heart and are scrapping this game."

Rainbow6,33qq7h,RealityKing4Hire,3,Sat Apr 25 00:19:02 2015 UTC,"There are some interesting gameplay concepts in Siege for the one mode and two maps we've seen so far. But looking through Siege as its own standalone game, there is currently a mountain of features and mechanics tacked on that compound on each other to create a broken game environment.  Ubisoft Montreal seem committed to the pre-COD 2015 launch, with PR moves like the Operators video series. It's neither Blufor vs Opfor or Green team vs Red team, nor is it CT vs T like the E3 2014 build; but we get a quagmire of different CT units mixed in on both the same team and having the same CT units on both teams.  What a mess, do you believe Ubisoft will bin their existing art assets before E3 2015 that they are happy to parade out in pre-order advertising, because of this stupid design choice creates a game environment that looking at a player's faction will not tell you whether they are on your team or not, now you need to clutter up your HUD with very blatant IFF markers. For example the SAS characters, we have Sledge and Thatcher on the attacking team and Smoke and Mute on the defending team, gj Ubisoft gj :s . So it's 21 operators (25 if including 5 recruit versions), instead of 5 faction variants of 21 classes, yes that's right 105 character versions needed for unified teams because someone wanted to be creative, but not hardworking enough to create 105 characters.  And this is just one example, I have more in the feedback thread I'm slowly working on. ""Slowly"" because I see little commitment to the alpha-beta process from Ubisoft, that BF4 CTE quality community feedback and developer continuous revisions while not perfect, can achieve."

Personally I would have thought that would be a more positive setup for competitive play (you could also try out the csgo method and have a casual playlist in which these options are on). I just think that without it will disproportionately push players away from the tenser, more exciting play this game is so close to reaching."

Rainbow6,33m37m,thepasttenseofdraw,3,Fri Apr 24 02:49:37 2015 UTC,"Devgru and Delta are CT units primarily, that R6 would recruit from (along with the SAS and GIGN). And boundary restrictions wouldn't apply as R6 is an international unit. It makes no sense for their operators to be left out and the FBI making it in to an international tier 1 CT unit.   p.s. CIA's SOG/SAD shouldnt be included either, that's a different stream altogether. Yes they recruit from DEVGRU/Delta but their focus and training beyond that point is focused on recon/HUMINT/infiltration/sabotage etc. (based on the intel publicly available.)"
Rainbow6,33m37m,Sterling__Archer_,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:57:59 2015 UTC,SS depending on where it takes place.   So if the president is held hostage?..  The Secret Service is not a CT or HRT team and are not used that way.
Rainbow6,33m37m,thepasttenseofdraw,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:44:22 2015 UTC,What? What do you think their counter assault team is for? They would work with the FBI HRT. Since they're near the president 24/7 they would be the first response then FBI HRT would come in if needed..
Rainbow6,33m37m,Sterling__Archer_,1 point,Fri Apr 24 12:02:30 2015 UTC,"Well now it's clear you have no idea what you're talking about.  The CAT is specifically for protecting the President.  They do not conduct counter-terrorism operations outside of the president being engaged by terrorists.  They are not a hostage rescue team, at all.   The role of the CAT team is clear: If the White House or the motorcade comes under an attack, CAT agents are the ones who will “lay down an unbelievable amount of suppressive fire,” said one former agent who did not serve in the CAT unit.  While CAT agents are classified as “special forces,” they are not swooping in to snatch the president from danger; rather, they are charged with engaging the enemy fire and providing time for POTUS to get away in ""the Beast,""   Why insist on looking even more uninformed.  Just give up, its clear you are talking out of your ass.  Edit: Apparently the facetious nature of my original statement went right over your head."
Rainbow6,33m37m,thepasttenseofdraw,1 point,Fri Apr 24 14:08:43 2015 UTC,"The fuck? I said depending on the location. To even get to the president CAT will be involved. Don't be such an elitist douche. I said CAT and FBI would be working together which they would. I said cat would be first response because they would. Cat is a CT team because they're defending the motorcade and the White House from attack. If someone goes to them then they will be involved. If it goes to shit then it's going to be a combination of every agency trying to make a plan to rescue the president.   Since you're insisting on being a dick don't even bother replying, I ain't gonna read it."
Rainbow6,33m37m,sonoblink,1 point,Fri Apr 24 14:42:53 2015 UTC,"Good since you clearly can't read anyway.  You said ""SS depending on location"", which is poorly explained at best.  CAT does not conduct hostage rescue or what is considered CT operations and they never have.  Political assassination attempts are not directly considered terrorism, and an assault on the White house or motorcade would only be considered terrorism under certain circumstances.  You want to create this minute situation in which a part of the SS might be involved and call them a CT/HRT team, which lessens how wrong your initial statement was, but you may be the only person I've ever met who considers the SS to be a CT unit."

Rainbow6,33kfvs,Kate_UTL,12,Thu Apr 23 17:09:06 2015 UTC,Guys lets be real. They would have to overhaul the entire game. Not happening. This game is nothing like the early RB6s.
Rainbow6,33kfvs,Deosl,8,Thu Apr 23 06:38:51 2015 UTC,"We can all agree that Ubisoft will never make a ""niche shooter"" like the old games. Ubisoft has outgrown the ""niche market"" and have brought the whole Tom Clancy series from being a ""niche"" to becoming streamlined for the mass market.   The only time they managed to excel in recreating the R6 experience was in 2003 with Raven Shield. That's because the devs looked at the old games and had a huge amount of respect for what Redstorm managed to create.  The jury is still out on Siege, who knows still early days."
Rainbow6,33kfvs,Pest_AWC,6,Thu Apr 23 06:54:12 2015 UTC,"I am still confused what the definition is of ""niche"".  Supposedly, it is a ""a specialized market"".  Doesn't every game fill a ""niche"" then?  Every realistic racing game like NASCAR, and every unrealistic one like Mario Kart is serving a ""niche"".  No game can serve everyone.  Even Tetris, while it can be played by anyone, still only served those that liked the ""niche"" of puzzle games.  Since Ravenshield sold 2 million copies in its first 4 months, it had the same or better volume sold than casual shooters, so if it is a ""niche"", it is one that can do as well as COD or BF if done well.  They did not have to dumb down Rainbow Six for people that like unrealistic shooters that hand-hold the player and also ruin the much higher feeling of accomplishment you get from winning with team-work, and a slower pace with proper planning.  They have destroyed everything that made R6 a unique experience that could have sold as well as COD, and instead turned R6 into a clone of the COD experience."

I did love how you could change the number of terrorists in a map to suit your needs.  Though I think the unmodded maximum was 40. I hope they bring this feature back so that when you feel like you've really mastered terrorist hunt (or PvE Hostage Rescue or Bomb Defusal) you can increase the enemy density to give yourself further challenge. This needs to be a console custom server feature too, not just PC. I loved doing that in RvS!"
Rainbow6,33migc,iceycat,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:43:17 2015 UTC,A map editor would do way better than just being able to adjust the density. Periodically put the top PC maps up as free DLC for consoles and you've got some real longevity.
Rainbow6,33migc,geofurb,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:46:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with you completely,  though I don't see them doing that. No reason you couldn't have an independent editor for the console too. Ubisoft ships a multi player map editor with most of the Far Cry gamed, it's not like there isn't a precedent for it. I do like the option of PC top maps being mafe available on console as well but I have no idea how they would make the cross platform thing work.

Rainbow6,33migc,iceycat,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:04:33 2015 UTC,"Ubi collecting community maps and patching them as DLC would be easier than implementing a console version of a map editor. I'm not looking for something FarCry4-level of easy-to-use, I'm looking for literally anything that will run and make working maps, be it buggy, arcane, or whatever.  Doesn't have to be pretty or stable, just has to make maps.  On consoles distribution is hard, so unless they're going to invest in map-sharing infrastructure, it's easiest for them to just pull some community-made maps that have proven their popularity on PC and stick them on consoles every quarter or so as free DLC."

Rainbow6,33jx9p,Deosl,-2,Thu Apr 23 13:21:31 2015 UTC,In Rainbow 6 Patriots.  EDIT : Never.
Rainbow6,33jx9p,Nostrums,5,Thu Apr 23 03:47:45 2015 UTC,"Uhm, How was Patriots back to the roots?  Based on the concept trailer it was a 3rd person cover shooter with more press X to salute John Clark, RIP."
Rainbow6,33jx9p,happytumor,-1,Thu Apr 23 11:35:30 2015 UTC,I'll edit it to never if that pleases you. I was thinking that saying patriots would give a little tiny bit of hope. Apparently not.
Rainbow6,33jx9p,ROTMGLilwern,2,Thu Apr 23 12:03:34 2015 UTC,"Made me chuckle. I never watched the Patriots trailer so I don't even know how it looked like.  There's still hope, maybe it'll be bad, but I believe in Ubisoft not wanting to lose money.  Believe."
Rainbow6,33jx9p,GV22,3,Thu Apr 23 13:26:17 2015 UTC,Why would you need a sniper for a close quarters combat game...?
Rainbow6,33jx9p,GV22,3,Thu Apr 23 18:25:11 2015 UTC,In older games you would be able to deploy a sniper team and they would be able watch a window. Also I believe in the E3 trailer the first person on the Counter Terrorist side would take control of a sniper.
Rainbow6,33jx9p,GV22,0,Fri Apr 24 06:19:47 2015 UTC,Thanks for explaining. Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one doing such a thing on this sub.

Rainbow6,33hwon,Deosl,4,Wed Apr 22 17:35:00 2015 UTC,"Found this today, but it's from the 1st of April, just use google translate. Nothing too new, but you get some insight from the creative director.  He mentions a factory, possibly a new map. Also some tidbits about Patriots."
Rainbow6,33hwon,n0ra,3,Wed Apr 22 17:36:29 2015 UTC,"Concerning maps, Xavier says clearly that we shall always be in familiar environments which will favor close combats.  Certain players who ask themselves the question why in multiplayer the fights are only of the CT vs CT, Xavier answers that it is a question of putting never in the hands of the player a character who would come from a terrorist event or who would convey an ideology. Besides adding that the CT vs CT exists since the first game in multiplayer and that it is the historic line of Rainbow Six."
Rainbow6,33hwon,Sterling__Archer_,3,Wed Apr 22 19:00:47 2015 UTC,I wonder why they made their cinematic trailer have terrorist looking people then
Rainbow6,33hwon,RealityKing4Hire,2,Wed Apr 22 21:57:15 2015 UTC,...tangos that could move the hostage.
Rainbow6,33hwon,Pest_AWC,6,Thu Apr 23 01:02:33 2015 UTC,"Besides adding that the CT vs CT exists since the first game in multiplayer and that it is the historic line of Rainbow Six   LOL, so were working doors, in-game maps, no hit markers, no magical through-the-wall outlines of your team-mates, no ammo pools, matching team uniforms (other than Vegas), and gimping, but that didn't stop them from completely trashing those aspects of a successful franchise."
Rainbow6,33hwon,Pest_AWC,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:20:28 2015 UTC,"They try to justify the use of WHITE OUTLINES around friendly players in this interview.  He compares it with World Of Tanks and says that those outlines make up for any lack of real communication or planning with your team because you can see what they are doing and react accordingly to it.  What a bunch of BS!  They are purposefully making this game for the opposite of the people that enjoy Rainbow Six for what it used to be, back when it required real communication and planning.  F this!  They have taken this beyond even how casual and unrealistic COD is!"
Rainbow6,33hwon,FaTaL_TeRRoR_Qc,3,Wed Apr 22 20:38:49 2015 UTC,"He doesn't even talk about old Rainbow Six influencing Siege : this guy should not be Creative Director. OMG, Siege isn't gonna change with him, that suck!!  How can you go back to the roots  *IF YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE ROOTS ARE** ?!?!?!?!?!?!"
Rainbow6,33jje4,tomhanni,4,Thu Apr 23 00:56:15 2015 UTC,"I'm going to assume you started playing rainbow games on the consoles. Those things while ok, are not really what the rainbow series is about."
Rainbow6,33jje4,MasterBetti,1 point,Thu Apr 23 01:49:02 2015 UTC,"MasterBetti speaks the truth. The absolute best ""authentic tactical realistic fps/tps"" was the original R6 & RS games, as well it was the most respectful online community ever in existence. MSN Zone was the place to be playing the real Rainbow Six games from 1998 to 2003."
Rainbow6,33jje4,CyberCam,1 point,Thu Apr 23 02:19:13 2015 UTC,Msn gaming zone!!!!!!   Yea it really bugs me that people think Vegas is the best shit ever. It's a good series but it's not rainbow. It's a cover based shooter.
Rainbow6,33jje4,MasterBetti,0,Thu Apr 23 03:20:21 2015 UTC,"Ehh... Uh... Rogue Spear and Raven Shield didn't have ADS without mods ffs. America's Army 2 was a phenomenal tac shooter, objective-based, team-based, gimping, bleed-out... They kinda killed it in AA3 when they just threw special forces at everyone, no more M16, everyone's firing full auto with ACOG instead of 3-round bursts on ironsights. Really, really changed the feel.  But yeah, Rogue Spear and Raven Shield STARTED the genre, but they epitomized it. Probably most prolific for their singleplayer, not the multiplayer, which is where real tactical play comes in. Anybody can beat singleplayer; it's made to be beaten."
Rainbow6,33jje4,geofurb,-2,Thu Apr 23 05:53:56 2015 UTC,"I'd just like to say that PC users don't have ownership over the series. Vegas and Vegas 2 were AMAZING games hands down, and refusing to recognize that because you think Ubi somehow owes you consistency is just sad.   Enjoy each game for what their worth, and if you don't like it then don't buy it. Isn't capitalism wonderful like that?"
Rainbow6,33jje4,AvatarTHW,10,Thu Apr 23 05:58:46 2015 UTC,They just weren't rainbow games. I had a blast playing them but I'd be lying if I didn't wish the Vegas were just spin offs of urban ghost recons. I wanted a rogue spear sequel. I really don't wanna come off douchey but Vegas brought a whole new generation of gamers to Tom Clancy titles. And most of them think they are veterans of rainbow games cause they started on original Xbox. It's the same vibe I get when people call bad company2- battlefield 2.
Rainbow6,33jje4,MasterBetti,3,Thu Apr 23 06:36:04 2015 UTC,"The Vegas games were great on the console, the cover mode felt better with a controller. But the Vegas games sucked horribly on PC and the console gamers never got to experience the thrill of the original PC games. I blame UBI for creating this divide in the community, partly because they totally changed the formula of R6 and partly because they screwed over the PC community by porting the game to PC with a million bugs and abandoning it after it flopped."
Rainbow6,33jje4,RealityKing4Hire,-2,Thu Apr 23 18:36:31 2015 UTC,"But that's how business works and you can't fault them for that. Again, this is just PC users being pissed that they're not getting what they want. I'll tell you what, even if Siege is just a modern Vegas 2, I'll be happy because Vegas was badass plain and simple. If you really long for the old games, then go play them. But don't shit on Ubi for adjusting to what the market wants; that's called smart business."
Rainbow6,33jje4,AvatarTHW,2,Thu Apr 23 22:57:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah I loved the pink camo and health regen it was so tactical /s. Look, I wouldn't even be here if UBI had not claimed to be bringing the series back to its roots and I think a lot of others wouldn't be here either so don't blame us, blame UBI for spreading more PR bullshit."
Rainbow6,33jje4,RealityKing4Hire,-2,Thu Apr 23 23:00:12 2015 UTC,"If you don't like pink camo, don't wear it. Health regen: it's a fucking game you dumbass. Leaving the real life shit at the door is kinda of a given  Quit being pissed that you got duped by a marketing ploy and either find a different game, or shut up and wait for siege."

Rainbow6,33jje4,AvatarTHW,2,Sun Apr 26 00:22:05 2015 UTC,"Depends on ""many Rainbow games"".   Did you play them on console or PC?  Because I will tell you that Rainbow Six games before Lockdown were essentially 2 different games on console and PC."
Rainbow6,33jje4,trineroks,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:31:03 2015 UTC,"I don't even consider Vegas to be Rainbow Six, but even then, it's better than Siege by quite a bit."

Rainbow6,33fooc,Sterling__Archer_,14,Wed Apr 22 03:29:22 2015 UTC,UBI wants to see feedback in numbers so I think it's kinda nice to see the sub flooded with the same suggestions over and over. Maybe it will drive home the point that we want a real R6 game and not another COD clone if they see enough posts about it.   Remove Hitmarkers Remove Player Outlines Remove HBS Remove Killcams Remove HUD Add More Recoil Add More Damage Add Servers Add More Round Time Add Doors
Rainbow6,33fooc,RealityKing4Hire,3,Wed Apr 22 04:17:52 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything except the removal of HUD. I do enjoy seeing my ammo but that's really it. Maybe replace that suggestion with the suggestion to have less ammo, as 6 or 7 mags per round is a little ridiculous.."
Rainbow6,33fooc,ROTMGLilwern,8,Wed Apr 22 23:19:40 2015 UTC,"It still doesn't need to be on the screen at all times. For example: PRESS 'R' to Reload, HOLD 'R' to Check Ammo"
Rainbow6,33fooc,RealityKing4Hire,5,Thu Apr 23 00:45:03 2015 UTC,I see what you mean. I like the 'Hold R to check ammo' thing.
Rainbow6,33fooc,ROTMGLilwern,1 point,Thu Apr 23 01:21:39 2015 UTC,"It's really easy to fit a lot of ammo onto plate carriers. Not sure about exact numbers for SWAT and such but I know Infantry tend to carry 300-400 rounds during patrol, and 600-700 if they knew shit had a greater to almost 100% of hitting the fan."
Rainbow6,33fooc,Deosl,6,Thu Apr 23 02:27:39 2015 UTC,"The mods here have never stickied a post before, not even FAQ or important info...o_O"
Rainbow6,33fooc,DeckardPain,6,Wed Apr 22 13:30:29 2015 UTC,"How about someone just makes a huge fucking Google Form that feeds into a Google Sheet with numbers counting how many people said what. Make the form with only checkboxes, nothing else. No fucking text boxes where people will dump their rage into them, because that would get ridiculous and defeat the numbers goal here.  Lots of checkboxes. I mean lots. Cater to everybody's possible bitch and complaint. No limitations on how many options you can choose.  Be realistic with your feedback if you want the game to succeed and be improved. If everyone just checked every box and hit send then our entire set of data would be worthless.  Then again they already sent out a feedback survey, so maybe this is actually not necessary?"
Rainbow6,33fooc,d0kefish,1 point,Wed Apr 22 06:32:32 2015 UTC,"The only ""real"" sollution to me seems like a very well made hardcore or realism mode.   The game is made to make money, not to please the fans. This is facts. I do not see why they cant keep fuctions like hitmarkers etc, aslong as there is a mode where it all shuts off.   Has there been anything said about the possibility to make mods for R6S?"
Rainbow6,33fooc,smiith357,-1,Thu Apr 23 11:09:03 2015 UTC,the hole game is lost....
Rainbow6,33fooc,jonowee,0,Wed Apr 22 09:00:48 2015 UTC,"Umm no.  Any feedback thread worth its salt will go beyond ""I like this, I don't like this, poo poo remove it."".  Each individual bring their own experiences and can offer a range of solutions to remedy problems or improve upon existing good ideas in the alpha. They can go into detail how it fits the Rainbow Six lineage, how solutions will work together with current alpha systems or with new user offered ideas."
Rainbow6,33j81m,Nimoy42,6,Wed Apr 22 23:20:20 2015 UTC,I am waiting for the beta to see if they actually change anything the community has requested over and over again.
Rainbow6,33j81m,RealityKing4Hire,6,Thu Apr 23 00:47:38 2015 UTC,Thank you for that. You won't have to wait until the Closed Beta because we'll be showing you the changes before then. This will happen in the coming weeks. Hang tight.

Rainbow6,33j81m,wow_obnoxious,3,Fri Apr 24 14:11:46 2015 UTC,Same here. Not waiting until the result of all the critics about the alpha would be absurd. In my opinion.
Rainbow6,33j81m,Harvey_Dole,2,Thu Apr 23 01:45:15 2015 UTC,I will take a look at the beta when its out but if they have to make all those changes we are looking at mid 2016 until its out. I just see too much call of duty in the game.
Rainbow6,33j81m,TheLucarian,3,Thu Apr 23 01:58:46 2015 UTC,"I just see too much call of duty in the game.  I preordered Star Wars Battlefront.    LOL. seriously? lol.  Edit: Ok just to lighten up the tone a bit: Battlefront will probably be cool, but don't expect anything hardcore tactical out of it, you are going to be dissapointed. And just another tip: don't preorder, you haven't even seen gameplay footage of it, dude..."
Rainbow6,33j81m,Harvey_Dole,1 point,Thu Apr 23 08:32:52 2015 UTC,I don't expect any tactical play that's why I went science fiction route.
Rainbow6,33j81m,Incursus,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:41:02 2015 UTC,"Siege may look like COD but Siege will be 100 time more tactical than Battlefront.  Siege is much more slower than COD, add recoil, remove some HUD elements, reduce health  and fix some gadgets and... you have a decent game. All this things can be easily fix after the alpha.  I'm agree, Battlefront look pretty awesome but this is not the same kind of game."

Rainbow6,33coqi,sniperwhg,15,Tue Apr 21 15:12:45 2015 UTC,SWAT 3 had working doors in 1999.
Rainbow6,33coqi,RealityKing4Hire,14,Tue Apr 21 16:12:54 2015 UTC,Oh yeah? Real life had working doors since they existed
Rainbow6,33coqi,sniperwhg,4,Tue Apr 21 17:10:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I hear that the difficulty curve in RealLife is incredibly high"
Rainbow6,33coqi,Fortune188,1 point,Wed Apr 22 08:07:02 2015 UTC,LOL!!!!
Rainbow6,33coqi,iceycat,14,Tue Apr 21 20:06:23 2015 UTC,"I never bought the ""doors cause lag issues"" argument they gave in their FAQ. If a half dozen doors screw with your netcode that badly, then you have some major code optimization to do. The other argument they gave that it doesn't work well with the barricade system is also silly. Make barricades context sensitive. If an open doorway you get barricades as they are now, if it's on a door a reinforcement bar goes across it, locking the door and turning it into a wooden barricade with a different skin. It's a solvable problem.   I believe the REAL reason we don't have doors is the round timer. Doors slow things down. It makes people more cautious and creates opportunities for offense and defense to alter sightlines but still be able to open and close off rooms. Offense would develop more of a room by room clearing technique since you would never know if there was somebody behind one that would ambush you if you ignored it. Defense would have it's own caution when it vame to doors as well. Do you leave them open or closed for the ones you don't reinforce? You're not just opening and closing doors, but sightlines and bottlenecks too. Right now you can tell where defense and hostage is based on the placement of barricades blocking your way. Doors would add an extra dimension to that. The bottom line is it would slow things down a bit.  They don't want that. They have arrived at the magic 3:00 round timer so nobody waiting gets ADHD and rage quits because they had to wait an extra minute or two. Their philosophy is to have as liquid of a flow as possible. Short round timer, sprinting, hit markers, grenade, hit and fire indicators, team xray outlines.... they all speed up the flow of the game so no one is kept waiting. Even when they are waiting they are given something to do to while away the time. THAT is why we don't have doors! It interrupts their predetermined optimal ""flow"". Can't have anybody waiting around too long if they die, it's the ADHD generation now. They think we couldn't handle patience,  ergo, no doors. At least, that's my theory anyway."
Rainbow6,33coqi,iceycat,6,Tue Apr 21 14:29:15 2015 UTC,"It's either your theory, or they chose an internal game engine that wasn't built with door technology and they can't figure out how to implement it within budget...but I like your theory.  Being rushed the entire time and the low penalty for death doesn't make it feel like an R6 game at all to me.  They shouldn't have used the R6 name at all and just made it under a new franchise, like ""Tom Clancy's Rush Monkeys"" or something."
Rainbow6,33coqi,CyberCam,5,Tue Apr 21 16:47:40 2015 UTC,"We'll see. If my theory is correct, there will be doors in single player and possibly/probably co-op as well because round time doesn't matter there. Or at least it shouldn't. If there are no doors even on single player campaign though,  that will just be ridiculous. (Like more than it already is)"
Rainbow6,33coqi,sonoblink,1 point,Tue Apr 21 16:54:43 2015 UTC,"""Tom Clancy's Rush Monkeys"" LMAO! That's PRICELESS but so true!"
Rainbow6,33coqi,CyberCam,-3,Tue Apr 21 19:57:17 2015 UTC,"How about ""Tom Clanys Slow Bastards"" or something;)"
Rainbow6,33coqi,sonoblink,6,Tue Apr 21 20:11:05 2015 UTC,"Well... If you look at the first 3 TC R6 games, you would see that the movement speed, even the sprint speed, was perfect and REALISTIC! You know the speed at which real operatives would move at. That's what the Tom Clancy brand was known for... ""Authentic, Tactical, Realism"", at least that's what it use to be known for!"
Rainbow6,33coqi,tyhopkin,2,Tue Apr 21 22:59:51 2015 UTC,"They still rage quit anyway or so it seemed in the alpha)  I always loved being able to breach & flash or pvp just c4ing doors or enemy opening a door and giving away there position it did really add to the game.  Still we can live without them its not the end off the fuking world the ADS is more of a problem,anyways we're getting a new RB6 game for me that comes first with or without doors!"
Rainbow6,33coqi,iceycat,1 point,Tue Apr 21 14:45:43 2015 UTC,How do doors slow things down any more than the wooden barricades?  It's much easier to open a door than it is to place a breaching charge on a wooden barricade.  My guess is doors weren't implemented because of getting them to work properly with the procedural destruction.
Rainbow6,33coqi,tyhopkin,3,Tue Apr 21 19:28:56 2015 UTC,"If every interior room that made sense had a door plus doors on all exterior doorways those would all block sight lines regardless if they were barricaded or not. Then you add baricades on to of it for open doorways some doors could be reinforced making them like barricades but you wouldn't know till you tried to open one. That woyld definitely slow things down. Right now anything that's not barricaded is just wide open, you know instantly if there's anyone there or not for the most part. What if you actually had to open each door and look inside? You can't just sprint past an opening and glance, now you have to actually enter. You probably don't want to just ignore the closed doirs entirely either because they could ambush you from behind if you didn't clear it. How does that not slow things down?   I'll grant you procedural destruction could be part of it, but the Devs didn't give that reason in their FAQ and that would have been an easy one to give. Furthermore if you treat a door much like a barricade with a different skin, it should integrate into the procedural destruction system ok. The only variable is being on hinges to open and close but maybe once it's been reinforced you can change it's properties so that it can no longer swing open and becomes a fixed object. I know about 3D modeling,  procedural geometry destruction systems like RayFire do this all the time. You just enable a dead state that is triggered by a destructive trigger (bullets, explosives, etc) until that time the 3D model is in a proxy dormant state. I assume this is exactly what is happening with their existing walls and barricades already."
Rainbow6,33coqi,iceycat,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:05:41 2015 UTC,"Still don't see it.  Any place you would normally have a door you can place a wooden barricade in the game.  Take RvS for example and replace the doors with wooden barricades.  It's much faster and quieter to open a door than it is to place a breaching charge and blow the hell out of it.  If it's locked then yea breach it with something or pick it, but there isn't a chance in hell that would make it into the game."
Rainbow6,33coqi,tyhopkin,3,Tue Apr 21 20:16:00 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's faster and quieter to deal with a door than a barricade. If that door isn't reinforced or something by the defenders which you would then have to treat as a barricade if they had. But while that's true for a given door,  now prepopulate the level with 8-12 of them. For defenders they close off sightlines for free without even placing a barricade or reinforcement. As an attacker you're running into doors AND barricades to deal with. And I don't see how you can't see how that adds time. If there were no time limit on the round it wouldn't matter. If the time was even bumped up to 5 minutes it may not matter AS much. But at three minutes half the time you're forced to rush because your time is out. Half the gameplay video out there of the Alpha shows this happening. :30 left on the click and people rush and make stupid plays because when the time runs out they'll lose if the hostage isn't secured. Adding in doirs will slow the play down enough that 3 minutes will not work.  Five minutes might. MAYBE.  You mentioned RvS in your example. How many RvS hostage rescue rounds did you clear in 3 minutes consistently? Im guessing not many unless it was run and gun. Clearing rooms just takes a bit more time. Yeah, doors are easy to open, but they HAVE to be opened to check and make sure nobody is going to pop out behind you and murder you from the rear. With no doors everything not barricaded is just open empty space and easy to see simply be glancing as you run by it that it's empty. Doors remove that, they might be fast and easy, but you still have to CHECK. And those aren't even the ones that actually ARE barricaded that you also have to deal with.  If you still can't see that then I guess I can't help you. It would not work with 3 minutes as a limit. Now,  I think it should be 5 anyway in which case it would probably be fine."
Rainbow6,33coqi,Wejurt,2,Tue Apr 21 20:51:46 2015 UTC,"I guess I should have been more clear, I assumed barricading doorways wouldn't exist if doors existed.  However if they limited the number of wooden barricades defenders can ""carry"" to 2 instead of unlimited and increase the round timer a bit would solve that problem."

Rainbow6,33coqi,ItzWolfeh,-2,Tue Apr 21 16:22:16 2015 UTC,"I mean, they could make something amazing out of this game like a mix of BF COD and CS. And i think that if they listen to our feedback and change the game, it would be a hell of a fun game to play and watch. Please dont judge the game before the launch, what we have seen now was the very first preview of the full game"
Rainbow6,33coqi,leteezer,6,Tue Apr 21 23:07:16 2015 UTC,"How about a mix of Rainbow Six, Rogue Spear, and Ravenshield?  F BF, COD, and CS!!!  No game ever succeeds by alienating its fans and trying to copy another game!!!"

Rainbow6,33coqi,Harvey_Dole,7,Tue Apr 21 20:31:09 2015 UTC,I think this game is beyond the point of no return
Rainbow6,33coqi,Dvsilverwing,3,Tue Apr 21 20:53:58 2015 UTC,"Yep... this kind of interactions are available since bf4.  You can not control the speed or anything. It's very basic but bf has doors.  Hardline is still devoid of interest . Super fast, hitmarkers even in hardcore mode, infinite health, etc"
Rainbow6,33coqi,Harvey_Dole,2,Tue Apr 21 21:24:44 2015 UTC,"Hate to tell you, but you're wrong there. In hardcore mode, by default, there are no hitmarkers and health does not regenerate. Servers can turn those options on, but the server is no longer listed as hardcore by the server browser and is then listed as ""custom"". Whether or not they have ""hardcore"" in the server name is irrelevant."
Rainbow6,33coqi,thewoogier,1 point,Tue Apr 21 13:49:04 2015 UTC,"Good news for the hitmarkers. At the beginning the hitmarkers was present in their hardcode mode. No?  By ""infinite health"" I just mean that health is at 100% instead of 60%. Maybe they fixed that too?"
Rainbow6,33coqi,Randomerpro,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:06:01 2015 UTC,"100% in hardcore was, as far as I know, unintended. They are changing it to 60% in the next patch or the one after."

Fast cars, bank robbers armed with bazooka and helicopter in a ghost town.... (except the rescue mode who seems very good.) BUT I'm really glad that BF keeps the hardcore mode like in BF4 .

Guys looks the same = Alpha, or maybe not. Deal with it and its unrealism.  Ammo pools (Annoys me, because the devs already stated they gave a  lot of ammo only for the alpha to test what would be a good ammo count).  White outlines : Hope we get a setting to change it if they keep it.  Insta-frags : Do you want a simulation or a tactical game?   Hit markers : Hope we get a setting to change it if they keep it."
Rainbow6,33coqi,trineroks,-4,Wed Apr 22 19:43:59 2015 UTC,"I think doors would make the rounds longer. With doors the defenders would be able to see when enemies come out, and with the hearth beat sensor they would be able to see where the enemies are it would`nt be fair."
Rainbow6,33coqi,geofurb,2,Wed Apr 22 10:02:22 2015 UTC,It wouldn't be fair?  You mean how it isn't fair in reality as well as every past Rainbow Six game including the recent unrealistic arcade style ones?  Now you can even do it in BF Hardline!  a BF game with working doors of all things!
Rainbow6,33coqi,Tango167,-1,Tue Apr 21 14:39:48 2015 UTC,"There are no doors in CS COD, coincidence?"
Rainbow6,33coqi,geofurb,4,Tue Apr 21 20:12:02 2015 UTC,"Uh... lots of doors in CS, dude."
Rainbow6,33coqi,Tango167,3,Wed Apr 22 04:05:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know what ""CS"" you've played, but every one of them features doors."
Rainbow6,33coqi,geofurb,-5,Wed Apr 22 06:57:37 2015 UTC,"Video game doors suck. Literally every game. Every door. They don't work like real doors. They either clip through people, or someone stands there and blocks it merely by being there, or two players keep mashing the use button from opposite sides of the door to make it twitch helplessly in place.  You want to be able to turn the handle and step back with the door towards you, kick it down, kick it in, push/pull it open and let go, or open it into someone hard and give them a shove? Sure, that's a kind of door that I'd be interested in having. It'd make the controls awkward as hell though, and I've never seen anyone do a door like that. If by doors you mean a magical mechanical object that rotates about its axis without any kind of physics, no, that's not something I'm interested in.  For chrissake, the barricades do the job of doors. Stop getting hung up on silly shit, guys. Let's focus on the real issues! Map editor, realism mode, dedicated servers!"
Rainbow6,33coqi,Tango167,2,Wed Apr 22 08:33:06 2015 UTC,"Doors aren't silly, at all. Not having them is.  Have you ever played raven-shield? Sit on a wooden door, they are bullet permeable, you'd get shredded. Sit on a metal door, depending on caliber of weapon, you could still get shot through it. Or a couple well placed grenades and the door was gone. Let's not forget breaching charges, and opening it just a hair to toss in a flash. No need to kick in a door, or shove it."
Rainbow6,33coqi,geofurb,-1,Wed Apr 22 06:15:55 2015 UTC,"Open a door that should open into someone else. Open a door while someone on the other side is trying to open the door. Open a door halfway and shoot through it (the door, not the doorway). Videogame doors suck."

Rainbow6,33gza4,electr1cpanda,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:49:40 2015 UTC,I pre ordered for PC and the game is already showing up in my list of games. I just didn't receive the email with the beta key.
Rainbow6,33gza4,electr1cpanda,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:29:46 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the confusion. On PC, you won't need a key. Once the Closed Beta starts you just boot up the Uplay client and it will be ready to download!"
Rainbow6,33gza4,Deosl,1 point,Wed Apr 22 18:54:59 2015 UTC,Thank you for the answer! Really happy that Ubisoft is responsive.
Rainbow6,33gza4,Sterling__Archer_,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:35:54 2015 UTC,Contact Ubisoft support.  It could be that you don't need a key since they've already registered the game on your account.
Rainbow6,33gyyv,AlexPournaras,5,Wed Apr 22 13:16:45 2015 UTC,You can participate on Closed Beta ONLY if you pre-order the game.   Wrong. You can sign up for a beta waiting list without pre-ordering.  Also hard to read your preview if you aren't Greek :)
Rainbow6,33gyyv,Deosl,-4,Wed Apr 22 13:26:38 2015 UTC,"They want pick you. They already made it free on Closed Alpha. You have to pay if you want a key for the Beta testing. Although, I am Greek."

Rainbow6,33bbjb,Randomerpro,3,Tue Apr 21 03:53:18 2015 UTC,"I agree, we should be able to lean anytime we want to, not just while ADS.  I hope they just hadn't finished implementing that yet, and that it isn't yet another unrealistic aspect of Siege to appeal to those that want a COD experience instead of a R6 experience."
Rainbow6,33bbjb,Pest_AWC,2,Tue Apr 21 13:15:14 2015 UTC,Mechanical and as you say a bit weird for RB6 ;)  I think it was the live stream last summer they said if you've played previous RB6 games you would be better than for instance a new player to the franchise because of the experience picked up playing over the years. Well as it is i would say if your a COD player you probably would have the advantage with this ADS system not the previous rainbow players...
Rainbow6,33bbjb,sonoblink,2,Tue Apr 21 08:20:09 2015 UTC,Absolutely needs to be added to the game. Anyone who ever played Raven Shield and understood peeking would surely agree.
Rainbow6,33bbjb,JackWallabee,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:08:46 2015 UTC,That would be a nice option but it wouldn't bother me if they decide to keep it like that. This game has bigger problems than that.

Rainbow6,338jtd,DL-Z_ftw,5,Mon Apr 20 14:47:38 2015 UTC,Listen to the veterans and this game will rock! I'm pretty sure you guys will implement the suggested changes being discussed in this sub-reddit!
Rainbow6,338jtd,steviebwoy,4,Mon Apr 20 19:06:20 2015 UTC,"Please just remember the origins of the game. Don't sell out to the CoD crowd. We want a slow-paced, thoughtful, tactical shooter that is as punishing as it is rewarding."
Rainbow6,338jtd,iceycat,2,Mon Apr 20 16:33:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Listen to your fan base! We will whole heartedly endorse a product that meets our expectations. Just speaking for myself personally I play in a regular group with three family members and four real world friends. We play online EVERY Saturday. If you convince me this game is worth it, you won't have sold one copy, you'll have sold EIGHT copies. Most of my group is intrigued about this game but interested started to wane when they saw hit markers and sprinting and xray outlines and strafe dance shooting and drop shotting. They all felt like that was too close to CoD. I agree. I managed to convince them that you guys are listening,  and actively looking for feedback to shape the game going forward. They're not active on forums or subreddits or anything, only I am. You won't hear their voices, only mine. But you will hear the cash register if you manage to convince me/us that you listened to us and gave us the game we wanted. If you dismiss your fanbase, your fanbase will dismiss you too. If you pander to the Cod and Battlefield players, you'll lose out to the hype of the next entry in their million installment series. Rainbow competes by being something different than those games are, not by stealing half of what makes those games the antithesis of Rainbow and masing it into the franchise.  That's not modernizing, that's just selling out. Remember your fanbasr. If what you've made is great you'll pull in the dollars and attract new people because you're the breath of fresh air in a stagnant market offering something new and different."
Rainbow6,338jtd,iceycat,2,Mon Apr 20 19:36:25 2015 UTC,"I'm sure it's going to take some time to comb through all that data. There's surveys and extended surveys, there's all the feedback on the forum and subreddit, there's at least sone YouTube videos that do reviews on the Alpha rather than just gameplay. I'm not sure what if any feedback they might be able to compile from other services such as Twitch, etc. Once they get it all compiled then they really have to analyze it and find out what it all boils down to. Then they'll have intetnal meetings about it, lots of back and forth discussion and finally they'll make their decisions on what to change or tweak. They'll probably do some testing first before they commit to a change, no sense telling us they're going to change something only to find out it's a gamebreaker when they try it after the fact. I'd say we're looking at a few weeks at least. Take my guesstimate for whatever you think it's worth. What it will not be though is within the next few days. That, I am sure of."
Rainbow6,338jtd,PrecisionMode,2,Mon Apr 20 15:37:47 2015 UTC,It will be a long wait for me ;)  I really hope UBI will listen us
Rainbow6,338jtd,Pest_AWC,1 point,Mon Apr 20 18:35:59 2015 UTC,"Regardless of any surveys or feedback, there is a fundamental business flaw with such drastic and never ending changes to the Rainbow Six Franchise (and Ghost Recon too).  You can't just keep slapping the name on whatever COD, 3rd person, or arcade shooter idea someone at UBI comes up with.  You need to start new franchises for that like you did with Tom Clancy's Division, Splinter Cell, Hawx, etc.  Quit ruining both the Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon series by making unrealistic changes that appeal to a completely difference audience.  I know you won't...but thanks for listening.  Someday, a major web or print news organization will have the balls to call UBI out on this...or maybe they won't..."
Rainbow6,338jtd,Randomerpro,0,Mon Apr 20 18:26:18 2015 UTC,"thanks for listening   Implying that they're listening to you.  Why would a major web or print news organization call out Ubisoft because of your opinon? Have you ever heard of sequels that aren't directly the sequel from the last game/book? That's pretty much what Siege is.  Also, I find it quite funny how you completely rant about the game, then say thanks for listening and then proceed to say that Someday a major web or print news organization will have the balls to call UBI out on this...or maybe they won't .  Alright, your post isn't laugh-worthy anymore,  Ta-ta."
Rainbow6,338jtd,Pest_AWC,-2,Wed Apr 22 10:16:13 2015 UTC,"Have you ever heard of sequels that aren't directly the sequel from the last game/book? That's pretty much what Siege is.   Not directly a sequel?  It's a completely different type of game!  So what you are saying, is it is completely fine for the next COD game to come out and called COD, but be a hardcore realistic shooter with bullet drop, wind, gun jams, and no artificial crutches?  Their fan base would go ape-shit!  Franchises like COD are used to the next game being slightly different but being the same amount of realism/unrealistic ratio with the same style of play.  I guess as long as UBI keeps radically changing R6 games on every release, at some point the R6 name should mean ""Random type of gun game not conforming to any previous R6 titles""."

Rainbow6,338jtd,Randomerpro,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:54:17 2015 UTC,How is it a completely different type of game? Because it doesn't have doors like BF:H ?  You came to the conclusion that it was a completely different type of game from the closed alpha? Or do you have magical powers to see the future?  Ubisoft would have never given an alpha or beta if they only wanted money on the short run. Wait until the beta before ranting like a mad redneck towards his wife when she illegally got outside without hearing her husband screaming for his 80th beer.
Rainbow6,338jtd,Pest_AWC,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:14:36 2015 UTC,"How is it a completely different type of game?   Umm...let's see, from the closed Alpha and everything they have told us...rounds are half as long, planning on a map and an in-game map are gone, they've added the magical ability to see hit markers, white outlines around your team, teams no longer wear distinct uniforms to tell the teams apart, reduced player count from max of 16 to 10, insta-throw grenades, ammo pools instead of managing clips, RELOAD messages, cluttered HUD of every type message possible, no gimping, that last stand thing, and we now have to pick from limited classes instead of choosing our own kit with everything available.    It's way more than just the lack of doors.    I would pretty much say it's the anti-R6 game, otherwise known as COD reduced to 5 VS 5 without respawns."
Rainbow6,3381aq,Flachpfeife,9,Mon Apr 20 11:27:48 2015 UTC,"I made a thread about this here as you saw.  The devs have seen the thread and will respond once they can. They understand our concerns and we have voiced it clearly I believe.   We shouldn't doom the game just yet, don't forget there's still time and they know for an MP focused title that online is very important.  The most important thing is that they are reading what we say and will give us info on that subject when it's ready.   Also let's not all jump to conclusions, it's great that they give us info about stuff which is not finalized yet. But if we don't approach it in a constructive manner, they won't give us such info and continue to be transparent if we can't handle ""Work In Progress"" info.

Rainbow6,3381aq,sonoblink,2,Mon Apr 20 12:19:48 2015 UTC,You can host your own games in COD MW2 and beyond but most are invite only. The only console game that has had a decent Server set up was BF3 where you could rent servers and Vegas 1/2 and the Vegas servers are pushing it.
Rainbow6,3381aq,kreios86,2,Mon Apr 20 19:35:29 2015 UTC,"I apologize for this. We had some content planned around this that for various reasons did not make it out. I think overall maybe it was too soon to get into the online service stuff.  That said, we will be treating this as a game as a service. This game will not just be abandoned after launch, there's a lot of cool stuff coming, and we need to support that with a strong live service.   We'll regroup on this topic later, I promise."
Rainbow6,3381aq,electr1cpanda,1 point,Thu Apr 23 15:23:18 2015 UTC,"I think what worries people is that it was confirmed, or at least stated by a UBI employee, on the official forums that there would be no 3rd party dedicated servers, only P2P.  Similar to Vegas and Vegas 2, the question of dedicated servers came up early on as well and UBI never addressed it until release.  It a fresh reminder of past games on PC that also went similar routes and those games didn't last long, Vegas and Vegas 2 included.They were essentially just distractions until the next shooter came out.  Please don't make that same mistake with Siege."

Rainbow6,332p58,geofurb,20,Sat Apr 18 23:14:14 2015 UTC,"What I want to see in realism mode (default base gameplay):   No teammate silhouettes or names seen through walls No hitmarkers No text screaming ""HOSTAGE FOUND"" when hostage is found No killcam - just point the camera in the direction of where you were killed from No white arrow indicator pointing to enemies who can see/aim at you (this is not merely a near miss indicator - it actually points to enemies who are aiming at you) No objective indicator (let players communicate on where the hostage was found) No glowing grenade indicator Remove Call of Duty instakill knife Dead teammates can only spectate through their teammates' first person viewpoints, Counter Strike style. Introduce a tighter natural crosshair for point shooting instead of being forced to fire through ADS (even Vegas allowed you to fire from the shoulder instead of forcing you to ADS) Overall movement speed toned down a bit and strafe speeds reduced - replace sprint with a slower walking speed that maintains accuracy (crosshairs stay tight) Allow leaning without ADS Allow slow turning to not penalize accuracy - only punish accuracy if the player turns fast Make entering ADS take a lot longer (maybe 2 seconds to enter and exit it) Punishing recoil. Make it so that even in ADS recoil is hard to control Instead of the 100 HP system, have a body icon that will highlight injured locations in red (SWAT 4 style). 1 shot to head, 2 shots to chest, 3 shots to limb to take out an enemy. Magazine system over ammo pool system Gimping in relation to location damage DBNO, although I would like to see removed, should be a 1 time deal, with the revived player suffering both gimping effects (slower speed and worse accuracy) and able to die in 1 shot. 1 shot to the head or 2 shots to the chest should not activate DBNO (although something like 1 shot chest 2 shots limb would activate DBNO) Doors No class based gameplay - allow team members to pick whatever equipment they want but with limited amounts of certain equipment (riot shield, wall/floor breaching charge, etc) Make at least the entry team look uniform (currently they look like a mishmash of special forces in some weird mercenary group) Fire selector on all weapons - allow players to switch from auto/burst/semi-auto Reintroduce weapon lowering when walking up to a wall - this was present in the reveal, why was it removed?"
Rainbow6,332p58,trineroks,3,Sun Apr 19 00:04:05 2015 UTC,No white arrow indicator pointing to enemies who can see/aim at you (this is not merely a near miss indicator - it actually points to enemies who are aiming at you)   This feature is not in this game ??? WTF :/
Rainbow6,332p58,Harvey_Dole,2,Sun Apr 19 03:16:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, those were all near-misses. Bullets are just a little quiet in alpha. There's no indicator that someone's aiming at you."

Rainbow6,332p58,iceycat,2,Sun Apr 19 04:15:08 2015 UTC,"Well, THIS, so long as it the default game mode. I still don't want a ""special"" hardcore playlist just to get these features and then have to deal with a fraction of the players to play against because the other 85% are playing in ""standard"" mode with all the arcade options fully enabled..."
Rainbow6,332p58,trineroks,0,Sun Apr 19 18:57:55 2015 UTC,"Wait, you want the characters to move slower? I thought this was good enough speed by R6 standards, just much smoother.  Edit: You can already pick whatever you want with limited amounts of secondary gear (but more than regular operators) if you choose the Recruit class. Also, I think weapon-lowering was removed because it got awkward with CQB. Don't know what they're going to do about that in the long run; clipping became a problem."
Rainbow6,332p58,Harvey_Dole,3,Sun Apr 19 00:16:32 2015 UTC,"You're probably right about forward movement speed - my biggest gripe is with the current strafe speed.  But even so, there should be an option to walk which will maintain accuracy.   That's exactly why there's such thing as weapon lowering - a longer weapon like a rifle isn't suited for CQB. You'd have players making decisions on what weapon they want to take depending on the situation as well (you'd see a predominant use of SMGs/carbines in close quarters maps such as the house and plane because their smaller size comes with ease of use... just like real life)."
Rainbow6,332p58,Harvey_Dole,1 point,Sun Apr 19 00:38:30 2015 UTC,"I agree that the wander-back-and-forth battles are irritating, but I think you won't even notice people trying that when the health gets America's Army level low. Clipped by a few bullets as you change direction to strafe back the other way and you're out.  Yeah, I'm completely with you there. There's a few things in their design goals that you have to keep in mind though, and one of them is input-driven gameplay. It should do what you tell it to do as much as possible. It's not nearly as realistic as animation-driven gameplay, but it's why the movement and controls in the demo felt so smooth. They're going to have to reconcile that with CQB problems for longer guns and clipping somehow. We'll see. Agreed that lowering guns would be an element of realism, and I hope that's what winds up happening (would help to balance, too)."
Rainbow6,332p58,ROTMGLilwern,6,Sun Apr 19 00:45:35 2015 UTC,Not for a realistic mode but for the whole game I would like :  • No Hitmarkers  • No teammate silhouettes (nothing OR a simple dot)  • No killcams (ok for the last kill)  • No crosshair (or reduce the size)  • Possibility to counter the knife attack and it should be a animation not a instakill.  • More recoil  • lose ammo when you reload while your clip is not empty  • Possibility to move the hostage  • Lower health
Rainbow6,332p58,trineroks,0,Sun Apr 19 03:13:37 2015 UTC,"You don't want any other realism features?  Moving the hostage is feasible with the current gameplay, but you'd need two restrictions:   Breaching charges DBNO so the attackers don't accidentally murder the hostage when breaching. Hostage is slow/frustrating to shove around for the defenders and the defenders cannot move the hostage between rooms."

I don't expect a remake, but something with the spirit/spine of what made r6 stand out and shine.  Btw, siege is using the anvilNext engine from the Assassins Creed games. Snowdrop is for the Division."

Rainbow6,32yexx,geofurb,-6,Fri Apr 17 19:40:01 2015 UTC,"Alpha looks waaay closer to classic Rainbow Six than the E3 demo. E3 demo looked like a cover-shooter dumbed-down for consoles with an impressive destruction system. Alpha is a deep, tactical game that just has a ways to go with balance and tweaking.  If you read the gameplay FAQs on the Ubi forum, they explain that they're going to let you take out any HUD elements you want, including hitmarkers and x-ray outlines. They also confirm that the heartbeat monitor is going to get a big nerf. These are guys who really love tac shooters, and I think they're sneaking as far as they're allowed in that direction. Be patient, and try to understand what's going on in dev-land."

If people want to play a COD style game, they will play COD.  Don't go down the failed path of trying to be a slightly different version of COD.  Be Rainbow Six!  10 years ago, my clan used to play BF1942, R6 Ravenshield, and IL2.  We had no desire to play any rip off's of those games, or games similar to them.

Big whigs and corporate high ups are risk adverse. That is what is taught in business schools. Message to these people: the creation of the blockbuster RS/RvS tactical shooters was what gave Rainbow Six its birthright. So going back to your roots is, in fact, not so risk adverse after all. There are LOTS of people sitting on the sidelines right now waiting for the return of the messiah."
Rainbow6,32yexx,Christophicus,1 point,Fri Apr 17 23:09:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed. My classmate at UCLA was a legal assistant at a West LA Law firm when we both attending College. She said that she met Bobby Kotick a few times when Kotick was meeting with some of the law partners ( might have been around the time IW creators were leaving or maybe the Vivendi/Activision merger, I forget ). Anyways, she stated the guy was a complete a-hole the few short encounters that she had with him. Most of the big corporation execs are really suits who have no interest in games/gaming. They also will except the status quo with failing business models because they're fine with taking the millions in salary and bonuses a year even if it results in the eventual death of corporation ( Blockbuster ).   Personally, I feel that because they lack passion for the very industry they are getting rich from, they don't understand the community and the hidden potential of all the people on the sideline as you stated.   At this point, I truly believe that modest success with our minority of gamers can really transcend severe disappointment with the majority."

Also, I'd give up trying to argue for Steam vs UPlay integration. No way the grunt level game designer devs are going to have any say in that (likely decided by marketing execs way above them, with judgement made on sales numbers/adoption rates/etc.).  One thing that might make this much more tactical is the ability to mark enemies for x amount of seconds, like Farcry, something another Ubisoft game has done well."
Rainbow6,32yexx,Pest_AWC,1 point,Sat Apr 18 01:08:42 2015 UTC,"Fact of the matter is that more people will enjoy a modern take on a FPS that's closer to CoD than R61. Given that devs in big teams have to make a ton of compromises with each others visions, rather than getting to see their own fully recognized; many simply aim for a game brings the maximum amount of joy to the maximum amount of players it can. If you take a step back for a moment and just think about that notion for a second...maximizing the overall amount of joy a game creates...then you can see how rationalising catering to a wider audience becomes a tad more acceptable.   The market in its current state has proven slower, more tactical/realistic titles aren't in the same kind of demand as faster run & gun titles. Ubisoft has seen this themselves with their own game recently. Ghost Recon Online/Phantoms...for the longest time they stuck to their guns and kept it a slower paced, more tactical/coordinated affair. However they ramped up the speed and transitions between animations (making it more run and gun), and player numbers picked up considerably...and guess what...player numbers rose quite a bit. Again, the change brought more joy to larger numbers of players...in the grand scheme of things, that's the logical thing to do.   Purposefully spending a great deal of time/money on significantly smaller subsets of a playerbase is always going to be the realm of indie/smaller devs. Large publishers aren't going to do this. It doesn't make sense for them.  RS:S isn't going to receive any significant ways to the way it plays at this stage, it's far too close to release. Maybe they'll do something similar to BF and try and try to make some token changes for the hardcore fans via the big DLC packs...but those are usually planned out months, if not years, in advance."
Rainbow6,32yexx,TheLucarian,1 point,Sat Apr 18 05:32:39 2015 UTC,Should clarify that I'm playing devil's advocate here. I'd love to see them create a game that's quite a bit more hardcore than it looks like Siege will be...but that's quite unlikely.
Rainbow6,32yexx,OUTFOXEM,1 point,Sat Apr 18 05:45:57 2015 UTC,"Further to this point...since you call out EA's mistake's above, you've also got to look at their successes. The Battlefield franchise undoubtedly skewed more toward CoD with the Bad Company games and BF3. BC1,2 and BF3 saw massive growth and success for the franchise...with BF3 being critically acclaimed and all but the most hardcore of original BF fans enjoying BF3 (you'll never get everyone to convert). BF4 was too samey...and plagued by even more technical issues that BF3 on launch, curse of the annual title on a studio that had split to work on more titles than it was used to.   Nonetheless, the vast majority of gamers...including the majority of oldschool Battlefield fans, will tell you that while BF3 was less unique & pointedly appealed to a broader player base; it was still an utterly fantastic game, and a hell of a lot of fun to play.   Not all of EA's moves were mistakes...some of the very skews toward centre that you're decrying helped make the BF game both more popular and immensely enjoyed by even core BF gamers."

There were plenty of casual and unrealistic FPS games out when Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield came out, and it topped the charts with over 2 million units sold in the first 4 months.  That was huge back in 2003-2004.  There is no evidence that people would not enjoy a more realistic experience where you get a greater reward from success because it was done more realistically with less magical crutches, and because the punishment for failure was greater.  Same with Ghost Recon.  On that one they didn't wait 3 games, they killed the realism and risk/reward after the first release and it went downhill ever since."

I couldn't find a concrete source as everything seems to be about the alpha at the moment.  Regarding Terrorist Hunt; my personal experience is from console gaming on the 360 though I understand that PC is where the majority of folk on this sub are hailing from. That's personally why I referred to Vegas as I haven't had a gaming-capable PC until very recently.   Also, I think it being split-screen on consoles really helped the game attract a market of new players that could play on the sofa with their friends. I don't think this was available until Vegas came around (though I may well be wrong?). I think for a lot of people therefore, Vegas was the first time they came into contact with Terrorist Hunt.  Do you know if split-screen has been confirmed too, out of interest?"

Now that consoles are so much more powerful than that there is no excuse to remove ANY features for a console release. As a console gamer I say make the best, most hardcore, high depth, highly tactical R6 possible for the PC first and foremost and then when you do the console versions CHANGE NOTHING! Console gamers don't need or want their hands held and have things dumbed down. It's what developers keep giving us on consoles even though we're not asking for it!"

Rainbow6,32wofj,iceycat,2,Fri Apr 17 17:57:08 2015 UTC,"I don't enjoy playing on a keyboard and mouse on a monitor one third the size of my TV at a desk. I'll take a controller wirh my 60"" and the comfy couch anyday. There's all the counter arguments, I know.... you can play with a controller on PC too, yeah but half the games I play don't seem to support controllers so I still can't make use of it. But you can hook your PC into those new TVs now, true but Id need to buy a new graphics card for an HDMI output and Id have to run 20' of cable to get it all the way to my TV. They make gaming chairs you know...yep so is my couch, I don't have to buy anything special to sit in comfort. Also whenever I play with friends on PC there's always issues on one end or the other. One of us has a firewall problem or some anti virus feature we can't find to disable, one of our games keeps crashing, the networks protocols aren't playing nice with each other, we can get in the game fine but voice chat application isn't working right. Let's bypass the network with Himachi, yeah that worked, but next time it doesn't. Ugh. I just want to turn it on and play. On PC it seems like either my computer or connection is not cooperating or else the person I'm trying to play with is having issues on their end. Plus I know about 8 family and friends I play with regularly on Xbox Live but out of those only 2 ever play games on a PC and neither of them have a proper gaming PC or play games on it very frequently. Turning on your Xbox and playing with friends with no problems and total comfort is just WAY easier. I don't mind playing single player only games like Skyrim or something on PC, but anything multiplayer, console is just so much easier as it just plain works without any hassle."

But don't you see that you are asking for it? I don't want to look elitist, but asking for easy and comfy then that is what you get.  I think the only way to show 'them' that you want to play more complex/difficult games is by buying the complex/difficult games. Even if it means playing on PC. It's definitely not as difficult as it used to be ;) And there are awesome, difficult, tactical games like Arma (+mods), insurgency, red orchestra, and soon games like ground branch and squad. Think about it! Because it just ain't happen on consoles."
Rainbow6,32wofj,iceycat,1 point,Sun Apr 19 06:03:24 2015 UTC,"Your argument makes no sense. You reply with specific portions of my text that aren't in the same context as each other. You took me taking about how console gamers don't want our hands held and have things dumbed down for us where I was clearly talking about  the ""kind of gameplay"" console gamers get handed to them and then include a portion of my text where I mention playing with friends on Xbox is just easier as though on one hand I'm saying I dont want easy and on the other I'm saying I do. My comments on playing on Xbox just ""being easier"" had nothing to do with the easy game play mechanics consoles get, but I dont want, that was taken from where I was speaking about the difficulty my friends and I had about our respective computers joining each other successfully without networking issues making it a frustrating experience and how that often happened to us on PC when we tried, so turning on your Xbox and just playing was easier because it just worked. Maybe the couple of friends I play with have bad internet connections or they have poor understanding of how to setup their computers properly, I don't know since I'm not sitting in front of their computers. All I do know is that whenever we tried we could only successfully play together about half the time and the other half of the time there were networking issues preventing us either from playing or communicating. That doesn't happen on Xbox, it just works.  By selectively editing those two entirely separate references with different contexts to the word ""easy"" you then created a position to argue from which was different than that which I stated. That's called selective editing.  Furthermore I disagree that the only way to show support for these kinds of games is to buy complex or difficult games on the PC. I think that will only further the industry belief that those kind of games only have an audience on the PC so keep giving console games arcade experiences instead. I think the opposite holds true so that when a game comes along that most people would think a console gamer wouldn't get into that gets console release anyway to buy it and show them that there in fact IS interest outside of ONLY the PC market for those games. Games like State of Decay and Xcom on the 360 smashed sales projections because initial sales targets were not anticipated to be very high due to the fact that console gamers aren't into ""slow"" and ""thinking man's games"" yet on release they absolutely destroyed sales projections on consoles. To such a significant degree that these games both saw DLC and expansion re-releases due to their popularity. There will always be games that are exclusive to platform, there are PS4 games I'll never get to play because I'm not shelling out several hundred more dollars for another console and there are PC exclusives that I could pick up but probably won't because I can't enjoy the multiplayer with my specific friends and family because they either don't play PC games or we have such bad issues establishing stable connections half the time that it's just not worth it. Maybe you like playing with random people on the Internet, but my friends and family and I are all about playing with each other as opposed to randoms. If it works one way for all of us but not the other, we're going to stick with the way that works most easily and reliably.   In the meantime do I wish I could play amazing games like Arma or Rust or something with my friends and family? Of course, but I'm not going to be able to convince 3/4 of them to go out and buy better computers so they can, nor am I going to change their minds about preferring console VS PC, and even if I did, playing multiplayer with them is sort of a mute point if we can't all reliably get into the same server without connectivity issues.  I'll support future development of complex and difficult console games buy purchasing these games as they are released on console as will my friends. When 8 of us get behind a console game on release that's more effective toward future releases of those types of play than me buying only one copy of a PC game to play with random people because the other 7 people in my group can't or won't do it on PC"

I'm on your side, I didn't quote those specific parts to make you look bad, I chose them to show the interpretation that publishers make. I didn't cut them or anything, it's still clear what you meant.   I know that taste for certain games has nothing to do with choice of platform to game on. Look at dark souls, hard as hell, sells good. I wish ubisoft would see the potential as well. But they don't. They think what I quoted you on: people that buy consoles want accessible gaming, so they think they want accessible games, too.  I didn't want to start a pc vs consoles discussion with you, I genuinely wanted to know why a fan of difficult and tactical games chooses to play on a platform that is lacking said games.

Rainbow6,32wofj,DarkSynopsis,3,Sun Apr 19 21:26:08 2015 UTC,Nope it was in R6 3 and Black Arrow original Xbox consoles as well. Dont remember if Lockdown had it or not as I never bothered picking that garbage up after playing it at a friend's house.  Vegas Terrorist Hubt was AWFUL.  You only encountered terrorists in groups of three and the rest of the map was empty. Then when you kilked that third terrorist the next three would spawn into the map. Almost always in an area you had already cleared or even teleporting in behind you. So dumb. It was all a work around because they couldn't figure out how NOT to have all the bots rush you all at once if you were discivered or went loud so the three spawn wave system was implemented due to poor coding in the bot behavior.  Vegas T hunts were the worst.

This game is so different than CoD. I need more information as in where everyone is in the map among other things."" and they were like ""oh sure"". Rest everyone know what happened."
Rainbow6,32v5ju,gonapster,2,Fri Apr 17 17:30:17 2015 UTC,"I hope you realize most, if not all, of the features present in run and gun games were showcased in the reveal.  I agree with you that the reveal looks a heck of a lot nicer than what was presented in the Alpha. But I sometimes feel like I've been the only one critical of the game since reveal.  It's showcased stuff like:   Hitmarkers No recoil on guns Low lethality (long TTK) Revives Sprint Fast snap to laser accurate ADS + spraying everywhere No point shooting (naturally wide crosshairs, forced to use ADS to shoot) Teammate names through walls Ammo pool over magazine system No gimping   Although regular walk speeds were a bit slower, the only reason why the reveal looked slow paced and tactical was because it was choreographed. You have to realize that the potential to become run and gun has existed since the reveal.  But there is one thing... notice how in the reveal when the team enters the bathroom and the player walks up to the wall to look through the bullet holes, his weapon is lowered. It seems like in the reveal, weapon length mattered and if you walked too close to a wall with a weapon it would automatically lower.  What happened to this feature?"
Rainbow6,32v5ju,trineroks,3,Fri Apr 17 06:42:58 2015 UTC,"This is not perfect at all but except those silly hitmarkers. This video is way better than the alpha.   The name of your teamate  VS a huge white outline. I'm in.  Possibility to sprint but if the slow mouvements are more effective... I'm in. Run fast and die fast, I'm totally ok with that."
Rainbow6,32v5ju,Harvey_Dole,1 point,Fri Apr 17 13:53:29 2015 UTC,"Teammate names through walls effectively does a similar job as teammate silhouettes - just you're not given as much information as you would a silhouette. You could still magically see right from your screen if your teammate is in the room next to you or not.   Run fast die fast? TTK has been low since reveal. You saw fast snap to ADS, no recoil, and sprinting. The mechanics shown in the reveal allow a player to easily sprint into a room, snap around to an enemy while spraying, spray -> ADS -> strafe and spray.   Slow movement in previous Rainbow games (even Vegas!!) was beneficial because it kept your crosshairs accurate. The naturally wide crosshairs negate that and forces you to use ADS, which makes the slow movement in Siege rather useless."
Rainbow6,32v5ju,trineroks,0,Fri Apr 17 21:07:47 2015 UTC,"Thats what happens when you market a game. It was probably an internal test build that we will (hopefully) see later or it was a test build that was viewed unfavorably by Focus testers after E3 and got changed to what we played in alpha. Which happens alot, if so than the people in charge of focus testing should -not- accept players that mainly play CS:GO or any COD Game."

The hype was so high after this even though most of us knew it was all scripted. We expected the slow tactical gameplay because that was the way they scripted this. Yes there are some features in this that were not in the alpha but they did not flat out lie.   That all being said, we just played an Alpha guys. If they changed features they most probably did it for what they thought was in the best interest of the players and their pockets (can't blame them). That doesn't mean they can't change the features back, especially if the alpha players don't like the game in it's current state and want a more E3 feel. If they don't change and we still hate it, we move on and wait for the next game. Siege was not the end all be all of tactical shooters. There will be newer and better games that come out.   Side note: I definitely think they should make all maps night time. Maybe it's just me but there is something about the night that makes this clip seem more intense versus the daytime House map we saw in the Alpha."

Everything is a calculated business decision to maximize profit first and make a good game second. The devs don't really get much of a say in the direction of the game, they just code it to the requirements of the marketing team.

Rainbow6,32v2fs,Pest_AWC,8,Sun Apr 26 17:04:50 2015 UTC,Ubisoft doesn't exactly listen to the consumers for any other game since a few years ago. I don't think we can really change it. They spend the most money on marketing before the alpha even comes out then they give up. We can't do anything. Call of Duty is easy to copy off of and make so that's what they do. It's no one's fault in the subreddit. It's their own.

Rainbow6,32v2fs,onyxrecon008,2,Fri Apr 17 04:47:08 2015 UTC,"Do you really expect them to completely change their game again? Remember it was originally supposed to be R6: Patriots. Now Ubi has opted to go for the COD style of gamplay and attract the hordes of fans that play that on consoles.  We will end up with a ""hardcore"" mode with some of the features we have complained about disabled and that is about it. Consoles are going to be the money-maker here for Ubi as the COD fan base thrives on them.  Don't get your hopes up."
Rainbow6,32v2fs,BLToaster,3,Fri Apr 17 03:19:56 2015 UTC,There were plenty of XBOX players of Rainbow Six 3 that enjoyed a more hardcore experience.  UBI doesn't realize it could make more money by sticking to its roots and giving PC and Console players a different type of game than COD and BF.
Rainbow6,32v2fs,Pest_AWC,1 point,Fri Apr 17 12:50:04 2015 UTC,I believe there is definitely money to be made. But more money? That is a big stretch. The tactical shooter audience nowadays is nowhere near the size of the fast-paced COD like audience.
Rainbow6,32v2fs,BLToaster,3,Fri Apr 17 12:56:58 2015 UTC,"Only because there are no options out there on consoles. Console players have surprised again and again on wanting something difficult.  I hear Bloodborne is insanely difficult and yet it's super popular right now (I don't have a PS4 myself) or take a game like State of Decay that's being rereleased on Xbox One in a few weeks, that game was a run away hit that blew sales expectations out the window. It was predicted to not do well on Xbox 360 because it was judged to be too slow paced, unnecessarily complicated and unappealing to most gamers using Xbox Live Arcade. Not only was all of that not true, but it did so well that they released multiple expansions for it and are now releasing it in in full 1080p on Xbox One with all expansion content BECAUSE it defied expectations.   Neither of these games are FPS of course,  but their successes seem to fly in the face of the idea that console gamers like things dumb, fast and easy. The heck we do! But that's the overwhelming majority of what they keep force feeding us. We DO want hardcore games, we DO want depth and complexity. We DO want cerebral, slower paced thinking games as opposed to fast paced twitch reaction game play.  They just need to start actually GIVING it to us!"

Rainbow6,32v2fs,Harvey_Dole,3,Fri Apr 17 15:58:06 2015 UTC,"The things that they need to change will need to make the game play completely different than it currently does - in my mind that is a complete overhaul.  Comparing it to BF & CoD isn't really viable for what we are going for because it is not a similar type of shooter. Even CS for that matter does not have the technical aspect that R6 games SHOULD have. The competitive aspect of CS will never be topped in a shooter game, that much is clear but that is not the type of game R6 should be going for.   CoD & BF - Low skill ceiling, fast paced, average competitive community CS - High skill ceiling, average/strategical pace, elite competitive community R6 - High skill ceiling, slow/tactical pace, competitive appeal TBD   This is my breakdown of the games and the types of fans they appeal to. All have their own niches. Since CS is on PC only - it doesn't go for the fast paced gameplay that is so popular on consoles. R6 is on both, and there is more money to be made than lost by making it cater to the console community in their opinion."

Rainbow6,32v2fs,imasssssssssssssnake,2,Fri Apr 17 09:36:52 2015 UTC,No serious CS player would bother with this game. The skill ceiling is extremely low. CoD kids probably won't even bother.

Rainbow6,32swbf,Pest_AWC,4,Fri Apr 17 06:17:47 2015 UTC,Nice summary and suggestions DEOSL!  I agree 100%.  I think they will fall well short of expectations for an R6 game that is going after a small niche of casual COD players that want 5 VS 5 CQB on small maps with no respawn.  They need to continue the franchise where R6 3:Ravenshield left off and add the rappelling and some of the destruction elements of Siege.

Rainbow6,32t7tb,Pest_AWC,7,Thu Apr 16 15:00:50 2015 UTC,Tons of my friends are hyped up for siege and they've never played a rainbow six game before. Just because they play cod doesn't mean I would call them cod players. They're fans of FPSs and this one looks pretty cool. Most people don't pick only one game to play
Rainbow6,32t7tb,GV22,2,Thu Apr 16 21:13:53 2015 UTC,"It's true, many don't pick one, but a high percentage tend to pick the best of each type of game they want to play.  My clan used to play the unrealistic but fun BF1942 on one night, the more realistic Ravenshield the next night, and then ultra-realistic IL2 flight sim the next night.  The thing is, we didn't care to add the second best of a type of game to our collection.  If we wanted to play a BF1942 style of game, we would play BF1942.  I also tend to stick with games that have a history of sticking to their roots and being improved on each version.  UBI F'd that up when it went the arcade console port route with Lockdown, followed by a completely different direction with 3rd person magical cover view Vegas without prone or lean (but at least had working doors) and now they are going the completely casual COD route.  What's next???!?!?!!!"
Rainbow6,32t7tb,merrickx,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:31:56 2015 UTC,"Ubi really only needs initial sales, or to get a certain quarterly profit. Doesn't really matter to make something people will want to play beyond their impulse, big-publisher buys."
Rainbow6,32t7tb,JonathanRL,2,Fri Apr 17 08:38:48 2015 UTC,Why didn't UBI just remove the R6 name from the game and start up a new casual franchise   Not too late for this one at least...
Rainbow6,32t7tb,iceycat,2,Fri Apr 17 05:53:06 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day for Ubisoft it's all about the number of units sold and tapping into larger pools of players will do that. To you and I, it's not about the number of units sold, it's about the quality of the experience we're buying. Ideally those points should converge.  I think they are right to go after mainstream gaming and get those dollars in order to be successful. HOWEVER, I think they could achieve that by saying ""Look at how different this is compared to the same stuff you mainstream gamers are playing over and OVER again!""  Think if they capitalized on what makes R6 DIFFERENT than CoD and Battlefield they would have more success than trying to adopt most of their game play. People would try it and it would be a breath of fresh air. As it is now the destruction mechanic is cool but the game as a whole isn't unique enough compared to other shooters to stand out for very long once the destruction gimmick wears off."
Rainbow6,32t7tb,cmai3000,6,Thu Apr 16 16:11:50 2015 UTC,"This really highlights the stupidity of the game industry IMO.  They think the reason for the success of CoD is because it has reached the mainstream so, to compete they too have to reach the mainstream.  BUT, the success of CoD rests in the fact that when it came out it was truly unique, truly amazing, and beat everything else out on merit alone, it was a fucking great game.  It didn't compete with the mainstream games at the time, it redefined the genre.  They bastardized it over time, but its success should not give credit to the mainstream bastardized versions but rather the original that people actually fell in love with.  Exact same thing for BF.  No FPS game will EVER reach the success of CoD/BF/Halo/CS unless the first iteration of the game is truly a product that can be loved by its players.  The originals were loved by the community, as was Ravenshield.  They have taken out almost everything that made people love those games and replaced it with what is mainstream popular now.  It goes beyond a game development failure, it is a vision failure and one that has plagued Ubisoft for a long time.  I would be curious to know how long, if at all, Ubi devs and game designers spent re-playing the old games.  If they weren't having internal multiplayer matches on all previous rb6 games throughout the development of the game I am not surprised by sieges failure. They would have realized a 5v5 in the original Rogue Spear is way more fun then what they were developing. They should ask Valve if changing the core gameplay mechanics of old loved games is a good idea, they seem to be the only ones that understand that it is never a good idea."
Rainbow6,32t7tb,Harvey_Dole,4,Thu Apr 16 16:37:50 2015 UTC,"Exactly!  Well stated.  Ravenshield sold around 2 million copies of the game in just a few months at a time when that many was unheard of.  COD at the time barely broke a million.  Had UBI continued to develop R6 and kept the same amount of realism, planning, and tactics, it could have its own mega releases right now and others would try to copy it.  R6 was NEVER a niche market like some incorrectly try to make us think."
Rainbow6,32t7tb,iceycat,1 point,Thu Apr 16 18:30:47 2015 UTC,"But my question is HOW can UBI even tap into the COD fans and sell to them when they use the R6 name?  Every COD fan knows R6 means more realism than COD, so how will UBI show them that they tossed realism out the window on an R6 game to attact them?"
Rainbow6,32t7tb,gsr1550,4,Thu Apr 16 16:16:55 2015 UTC,Maybe many teens don't really know about R6? They see a run and gun game with a destruction feature. It's a no brainer. They will buy it for christmas and switch for the next COD.  The only way to make a profitable game is to sell a lot of units or produce a bunch of DLC.   The majority of players moaned against the DLC . It remains only one option. Sell a maximum of units.
Rainbow6,32t7tb,gamb10r,1 point,Thu Apr 16 16:48:20 2015 UTC,"Cod ""tends"" to skew younger. I think most CoD players don't know much about R6, or if they do, their only frame of reference was Vegas or Vegas 2. Of course some like myself have played both games and have gone back over a dozen years of R6 history and know EXACTLY what we're missing. Plenty of CoD players aren't even old enough to remember those games."

Rainbow6,32r514,Pr0ph3cyX,9,Thu Apr 16 02:45:52 2015 UTC,"I agree Siege needs a complete overhaul to be more like the original 3 R6 games in having more realism and less artificial crutches.  I don't agree that COD players will be attracted to this game even though it is a copy of it.  COD players will play COD and not a niche of COD that wants small 5 VS 5 CQB combat on small maps with no respawn.  Not many COD players will buy it other than a few that buy all the clones.  I don't agree that Siege isn't tactical.  It is tactical in the same way Unreal, Quake, and COD are tactical.  A game can be quite tactical without being the least bit realistic with its tactics.  Personally, i want tactical and a certain amount of realism like the first 3 R6 games, and won't buy Siege."
Rainbow6,32r514,Pest_AWC,5,Thu Apr 16 13:57:54 2015 UTC,"First off, don't be a dick. You're talking to human beings who care about what they're doing. They're a Montreal studio, and I'm guessing whoever put the survey together spoke English as a second language. It's goddamn hard to learn another language, so try to forgive a few typos that didn't significantly impact your understanding.  Personally, I think this is one of the more thoughtful tactical shooters I've ever played, and has strategic depth beyond what most people realize. My personal theory doesn't speak very highly of those people's intelligence, but I can understand why they'd fail to recognize Siege as a proper tactical shooter when it's such a departure from the classical formula.  So here's a quick list of things to think about:   A tactical shooter means an FPS focused on tactics and strategy. Whether it's a realistic simulation is a different question. I think a lot of Rainbow Six fans wanted more elements of simulation in Siege, and were disappointed that they didn't get them. (I agree; I had been hoping for more simulation.) What you see as gimmicks likely have depth you haven't even considered. I haven't seen much that you could take out without detracting from the tactical depth. Gun balance is a WIP; this is an alpha! It's perfect that you're giving feedback about this, but you should try to be more patient and constructive. (Though I have to say, I couldn't hit shit from more than 5 feet away on full auto without ADS, if they had cover. If they didn't have cover, they deserve to get shot up, spray-and-pray or not. It's a tactical shooter, after all; you can't get away with that crap.) The fact that the game is only slated for next-gen consoles suggests to me that the graphics are likely to improve (Though that's not much of an issue for me, so you might want to check if there's something more concrete from the devs) Really try to think about the tactics and gameplay. Lots of people complain that most hostage rescues end with one team or the other dead, but the gameplay that gets them there is far from a team deathmatch. The hostage anchors the defenders to a single spot, while letting them roam about a wider area if they're capable of keeping that one place safe. Its main job is to force players to be tactical in their combat, and it accomplishes that brilliantly.   Think outside the box! Approach it as a novel experience and decide if you like what it is without deciding what it was supposed to be. This is probably one of the most thought-intensive tactical shooters to date.  Rainbow Six invented the tactical shooter; people have copied it and ripped it off for a decade, and now Rainbow Six is taking it somewhere new. It draws from modern elements and readily discards realism in a few places, but refuses to compromise when it comes to tactics. It's different, and that's scary... but I promise, it's way, waaay deep.  ... And before you cry, it was this or Patriots. So, there's that."

Let me explain. I am an Assassin's Creed fan and I know at the end of each year they have this survey for the next game randomly sent to people who bought AC that year. The the game next year does reflect the results of the survey.  The problem with that is, these surveys are the reflection of the opinions of gaming community not the fans. [And thus AC is deviating from what the ""real fans"" want].  So as I said, they can be going entirely with the survey but yet not making the game ""we"" want"

I don't think mananlak is being a dick I just think the devs aren't listening to reason/criticism. I seriously think they need to rethink this whole game. I can see this game going the way of evolve, people bought into the hype and now hardly anyone plays that game, the people playing CSGO and COD will not switch for this game."

I was greatly disappointed by BF destruction (Bad Company 2 & BF4 were the BFs I played with destruction, both disappointing titles). R6:Siege's destruction reminds me more of a cat-and-mouse gunfight in a Hollywood thriller. Very Bourne Identity type effect on gameplay. It's all about the tiny bullet holes."
Rainbow6,32r514,geofurb,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:33:58 2015 UTC,"You're right, I was being a dick. I was ranting at the time, and I didn't take the origin of the studio into consideration, so my apologies (despite the fact that you would think Ubi has a English-speaking department of some sort to write the survey, but w/e.)  I do think this obviously has more depth than CoD, purely for the destruction and rappelling system. And I understand that more tweaks will be made, especially balancing of the guns.  But the chances that they will COMPLETELY change the way gun play works seems slim to me, especially with a few months until release. I must've used different guns than you, because I got a very CoD feel, and spraying someone down was pathetically easy, it comes down to who reflex shoots first.   This said, every gun that fires on full auto feels the exact same.  I do enjoy the hostage setup, but I would like some more open and slightly more long ranged operators/maps  in the future.  Lots of balancing to be had, but that is understandable.  We don't really want R6 to go too modern though, Vegas Two was accused of being modern, and allowed fire rate, suppressors, and all sorts of other deep decisions made in-game. Siege is dumbing down gun play to a whole different level.  Rounds should be longer to encourage more wandering, and I do agree with how tactically sound the hostage based game play is.  Wherein lies the real problem. Despite having destruction, and hostages, and so much else that separates it from the crowd, it doesn't FEEL different. More focus on rappelling and destruction, maybe making a few more levels destructible could help.  There was a lot more for me to say, but I'm to lazy to post it now. However, I want to be an active member of the process as clearly some improvement is needed.  Thank God it's not Patriots."
Rainbow6,32r514,geofurb,1 point,Fri Apr 17 21:11:00 2015 UTC,"The winner of an engagement being whomever reflex shoots first is a staple of tactical shooters. Look at any of the classics; people go down if they're in sight for more than an instant. Even in no-crosshair games like America's Army with burst-fire weapons, you're going down if someone sees you at close range, even without sights. The games that didn't work like this were the ones where bunnyhopping worked or where you had unrealistic weapons like Unreal Tournament.  I agree that the guns feel the same, which was kind of a bummer because in Behind the Wall they explained how they tried to give them each a unique feel. I think if they ramp up the recoil when ADS and give a more detailed explanation of the strengths/weaknesses of the weapons beyond ""high-caliber assault rifle"", we'll start to see the differences. I'd reeaally like a selection of burst-fire weapons. (Though I doubt they'll give us selective fire; keybinds are already getting tight on consoles.)  Definitely agreed that more open and long-ranged operators/maps would be good. This is why I'm hoping for a map editor. I think the gameplay is so deep that it's going to be hard for Ubi to explore every avenue by themselves; it's easier to let the PC community handle that, then redistribute the community's favorite maps as free console DLC.  I agree that R6V's radial menu let you do some things that probably should've been left as tactical decisions from the get-go, but that was really more of a third-person action game with low health than a tactical shooter. R6S might have simplified the gunplay, but they're taking it back to its roots.  Going back to Raven Shield, just high capacity mags and suppressors would be enough customization for weapons. Problem is, players like that feeling of accomplishment they get from grinding for new unlocks, and mistake it for added value to the game itself. Less is more.  Longer rounds would work best with lower health, since that encourages players to act more carefully. Removing the outlines would also slow things down a lot, since you'd have to coordinate actions verbally rather than glancing through the wall to see if people are in position. I'm not sure what the best route to go for tactical play is with the outlines. For realism or ease-of-use it's easy... For tactical play? Tough call.  As far as more wandering goes, I'm not partial to that. Instead of adding wandering time, add some pre-planning time so people know where to go, where to be. Go in as a team with a plan; the wandering is something I see as CoD-ish, where you're more looking to kill people than to accomplish an objective.  As far as the feel goes, it might handle smoothly like CoD, but the best way to play is very different. You'll get a lot of not-so-brights just going and trying to rack up as many kills as possible. (I had teammates who would complain about not getting any kills at the end of a round.) . . . That's a bad thing. That's people using poor strategies because their CoD instincts kick in. In 3-minute matches with an objective, that's a really, really bad plan.  And yeah, thank the gods it's not Patriots. Hopefully it's the first in a line of modern tac shooters that bring the thinking back into the FPS genre, or at least this particular subgenre."

Rainbow6,32r514,CookieDoughCooter,0,Thu Apr 16 10:06:36 2015 UTC,"I just meant it looked cool compared to Siege. I enjoyed the Vegas series for what it was, but it lacked so many classic R6 features."

Rainbow6,32r514,geofurb,0,Fri Apr 17 04:23:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I'd definitely take Siege over Patriots. I'd take the Siege alpha over the R6V games. And don't get me wrong, I liked R6V, I liked how fast you went down, I loved terrorist hunt, I loved jumping in horror as I heard a footstep two feet behind me just in time to see the man who murdered me, I loved the way they did gear/grenades/weapons customization... But it's a different game. I think it wasn't as much of a thinking game. You had to be very careful, but what you were supposed to do in any given situation wasn't as complicated as it is in Siege. You just had to figure out how to get to different pieces of cover and watch your back. And it was that same thinking all day, nothing more complicated/dynamic.  I think that was true about the earlier Rainbow Six games, too. They had more complicated controls and more punishing gameplay, but the thinking wasn't as complicated, even if you wound up being more careful. They were definitely more thrilling for the most part, but I think Siege is really a game for smart people made by some really, really smart people. I don't think it's getting proper credit for that. Run-&-gun instincts seem to take over for a lot of people when the punishment isn't as directly linked to the mistake. (Was that thought clear just there?)  I think we're going to get a realism mode, and when you pull the HUD elements off (which we know we'll be able to do) like outlines and hitmarkers, that's going to be really, really suspenseful, exciting gameplay. It might have less of a feel-good fun factor, but I think the patient types who liked the original Rainbow games will be really into it."
Rainbow6,32r514,CookieDoughCooter,1 point,Fri Apr 17 05:27:33 2015 UTC,"My beef with Siege is that I can't imagine that the Realism mode will be default. That means a very small community.   I feel like with the very thorough planning in the old games, down to the direction your team faced when proceeding, made it a thinking game. I guess I'm referencing the single player instead of multiplayer, though."
Rainbow6,32r514,geofurb,1 point,Fri Apr 17 12:18:33 2015 UTC,"It certainly won't be. Small community beats no community, but you might be surprised. Look what Red Orchestra did with its hardcore mode; huge numbers of players. Look at all the people complaining on the forums and in reddit. Some guy's complaining that 90% of the feedback is criticism... That means big community. Either there's a big demand and there's a healthy-sized community, or there's little demand and it's really not worth their time. I'm hoping it's the former.  Yeah. I'm betting Siege's singleplayer will have that same charm to it, though. More on that later, I guess. Personally, I'm all about multiplayer: singleplayer levels people made to be beaten, multiplayer games people're trying their damndest to make it impossible for you to win. Sounds more fun than beating something everyone's supposed to be able to."

If a company expects me to take them serious and they intend on gaining money from English speakers, than they need to show the professionalism of a multi-million dollar company and use proper English, or don't use English at all.

And these guys have some freedom to try different things if it fits what the boys upstairs were asking for, but saying, ""I'm a hardcore Rainbow Six fan and I hate this and I won't buy it"" helps no one. To make those changes, they need mainstream gamers that want more tactical elements, not the tiny little niche of the tacticalest of tactical gamers. What Rainbow Six veterans can do is to help them balance the gameplay, show them how actual non-dev players play it, point out the things that could trip players up, and reassure them that it's a very approachable product. Failing to appreciate its tactical depth doesn't do that. Saying it's not what you wanted to play doesn't do that."

I can agree that player health can probably be lowered like Insurgency, however not everything needs to be like that game. The hip fire comment isn't much of an issue when most encounters in the Alpha are CQB. If you hip fire in CQB in real life, you're likely to be quite accurate as long as you are pointing the right way. ""Tears are literally streaming down my face.""

Rainbow6,32r514,iTzSALUST,1 point,Thu Apr 16 10:21:55 2015 UTC,"But what are the odds that CoD players will stick around? Titanfall tried to attract this demographic too, but in the long run, it didn't work out, not just because it didn't have enough depth (hopefully Siege will avoid that too), but also because the community, mostly people from CoD, moved on as soon as AW came out.  Making this completely like Insurgency is a ridiculous proposition, I am only trying to say that several features and mechanics INS has would fit perfectly into Siege. Can you really argue that in-game call outs and better gun play would hurt the game?  I DID have fun in the alpha, but this is only a glimmer of what a true Rainbow Six experience, and these are some features to make it feel better.  Ubi definitely needs to understand that some people may not be able to use voice coms, and that can be fixed with a radial menu."

BF4 was out for almost a year before they introduced the CTE, which is essentially a beta to test stuff out in before they release it in a patch to the vanilla version.  Why after being out for a year was the decision to release a beta for balance?  They are still tweaking weapons, suppression, movement, where the bullets spawn from when leaving the gun models, dying behind cover, netcode etc, etc.      So while I agree that Alpha is Alpha, it will be near impossible to get this version of Siege changed enough in 6 months to make it a game I would pay for.  Come to think of it, I don't think I would even play it if it was Free to play in this state."
Rainbow6,32pucw,Pest_AWC,6,Thu Apr 16 14:52:22 2015 UTC,"So much truth. Sad thing is, it's mostly easy fixes. Removing hit markers, slowing speed down,  removing xray outlines, slowing down strafe speed and adjusting it's accuracy rating,  removing sprint, remove kill cam, adding a delay to stance changes to prevent drop shots, removing firing and grenade directional indicators. Tweaking class and weapon loadouts to not be so limited, tweaks to DBNO. A few adjustments like barb wire affecting both teams equally, etc. And you've kind of got the game we're looking for. It's mostly the removal of some mechanics or simply the adjustments of others. Nothing like reinventing the wheel or anything. There is so much potential if only that stuff would get implemented."
Rainbow6,32pucw,iceycat,5,Wed Apr 15 21:07:56 2015 UTC,"It's way more involved then that, since they shaped this game from the beginning to be casual COD style.  They need to add working door technology and redo all the maps to make use of that.  They need to scrap the class system and re-balance the game for everyone choosing their own kits.  They need to recreate the operators to look like teams with similar uniforms that are completely different than the other team.  They need to add real overhead planning maps that can be pulled up in game...Your list is just a start."
Rainbow6,32pucw,Pest_AWC,1 point,Thu Apr 16 14:09:06 2015 UTC,"But that's all tweaks and rebalancing too. I can model a door and rig the hinges in 3ds Max in 10 minutes. Another 10-20 to texture it. 5 minutes to export it out to Unreal Editor (or whatever they're using) now I have to admit I'm a modeller, not a coder so I don't know how long it would take to write the code for a working door system and insert it, but it can't be THAT bad.  If they reskinned the models on the opfor that would take a bit more, but if they just made the colors different for the other team that's only a few hours worth of work in Photoshop to get you some new texture colors. Team one is blue and team two is tan or olive drab. Shouldn't be too hard.  Now coding a drawable map system for planning phase is almist purely coding and more complicated than coding a door at that. I have no idea how ling that would take.  I don't hate classes, but I would like them to allow us to pick any guns we wanted for them at least. That doesn't sound too hard to code, though scrapping the entire class system would be a much bigger coding issue.  We'll never get 100% of what we're looking for of course,  but the point remains,  they can get pretty close, FAIRLY easily by just modifying what's already there. Bonus points to them for anything that's a MAJOR redesign outside of tweaking already existing infrastructure."

It open up so many questions and situations that need to be addressed it is a huge undertaking if the engine doesn't already do all that.  Collisions, interacting with it, open in or out, what if 2 people try to control at the same time, net code to transfer the doors state instantly to everyone...etc..

I read the article you're talking about a long time ago, it was more about game design, not the technical aspect. Like which doors are openable, do the doors you can't open not have a handle? Etc... There's no excuse to not have doors, no matter what anyone says.

It seems as though they had them in and found issues from the developer FAQ a few weeks ago. They said it caused issues with the barricade system and created lag issues. That's gotta be workable!

Have the brains to shoot the damn things. It's a tactical shooter, knucklehead.)  As far as the Rainbow Six series goes, this is at least on-par with the tactical depth of multiplayer in other titles. The feel is different, the tactical depth is the same. It's less simulation, and that's what bothers people."

Whatevet was drawn on the map was visible to all teammates who looked at their map as well. Having the host turn off certain game play features isn't super useful because out if 10 people, only one guy is in control of that option and it will be left on all the time since it's ""standard"" I also don't want R6 to be ""on par"" with other shooters.

To the player thats using it I suppose that's true, but the developers shouldn't allow those mechanics in the first place.  Strafe dance shooting. Sprinting drop shots. Circling while repeatedly crouch/stand/crouch/standing and firing.  Quickscoping, no scoping and black scoping. These are all movement and engagement exploits that allow cheap tactics and give advantages to players that pull them off and yet have little to no grounding in reality for how people should actually be able to engage in gun play. Just because the devs allow such poor mechanics to be present in today's games doesn't mean they should be and it SURE doesn't mean we want them in a R6 game."

Doesn't have to be easy to do to be an exploit, it just has to be something you shouldn't be able to do. Just because game developers do a crappy job with programming these kinds of mechanics and they exist also doesn't make them any less of an exploit. Things like jumping while quick scoping or strafe dancing like you're on ice skates while shooting are all exploits because they shouldn't be possible in the first place. Doesn't matter if they're hard to do or not."

Whether the literal dictionary definition doesn't agree is irrelevant as it's up to gamers as a whole to decide what lexicon is used, for example arcade shooters also bring a different image to mind and the definition is rather different for that too."
Rainbow6,32t6nc,CSKarasu,3,Thu Apr 16 20:05:05 2015 UTC,"tactics can be defined by anyone to mean anything.  to me, tactics are gaining an advantage over the other team by using movement and communication as 95% of the tactical element with the other 5% elements provided by the gadgets to trap the enemy and allow a team member or members to move in for the kill.  do all FPS games provide these gadgets... yes. too many gadgets to be honest.  with this game, and the limited time i played the alpha, the tactical element is 90% gadgets... in the classic R6 games.. (rogue spear/ ravenshield and even the original R6) the tactical elements were flashbangs, HBS and frags along with area designations for identification purposes each team made up to know where your teammates/enemies are.  this game removed the 95% human element tactic by throwing in high tech gadgets and other features that will likely cause the game to not do well, kill cam and team player outline, etc.  the ""player"" tactics are, what i think, is what most of the real gamers want. they dont want the baracades and shields and robots and all the other fancy shit. they want the human tactical element back."
Rainbow6,32t6nc,shadow2k1,-1,Thu Apr 16 17:54:28 2015 UTC,"Then people need to say that, and not just say ""Siege isn't tactical"", because the devs immediately stop reading at that point, knowing that this person is full of shit and doesn't know what ""tactical"" even means."
Rainbow6,32t6nc,trineroks,3,Thu Apr 16 19:01:12 2015 UTC,"So you're saying Team Fortress 2 is a tactical shooter. Or that Battlefield is a tactical shooter. Or that Quake online is a tactical shooter.  Then let me ask, why is there a specific subgenre of FPS games called ""tactical shooters""? Your generalization makes no sense.   If we're going to be so literal about things, I could call Call of Duty a real time strategy game. Why? Because Call of Duty increments in real time, not turn based, and utilizes at least some forms of strategy.   Strategy video game is a video game genre that emphasizes skillful thinking and planning to achieve victory   Me sprinting and climbing up a ladder, timing the respawn of the enemy team, and then conducting a 360 noscope off the ladder for the finishing kill requires planning and thinking.  There is a reason why we have genres, you know. There may be some tactics you can utilize in Siege (but then again, what FPS game does not allow at least some form of tactics?), but what we've been shown with Siege is NOT a tactical shooter."
Rainbow6,32t6nc,forzaitalia458,2,Fri Apr 17 02:50:17 2015 UTC,"Team Fortress 2 can be played Tactically, but definately there aren't as many tactics available as there are in Siege or other R6 games.  My point was not to say all games are equal in tactics and therefore all get to call themselves tactical shooters.  My point is that Siege has plenty of ways to play tactically even if they are not realistic, and if we keep posting rants that start with ""Siege is not tactical"", then that is incorrect and the Dev's won't read your post or take anything else you say to heart because you started with a BS comment."
Rainbow6,32t6nc,geofurb,3,Fri Apr 17 13:11:09 2015 UTC,"Tactical shooter From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  A tactical shooter is a subgenre of shooter game that includes both first-person shooters and third-person shooters. These games simulate realistic combat, thus making tactics and caution more important than quick reflexes in other action games.   -  i think this pretty much sums up what I want to say, siege is a reflex shooter"
Rainbow6,32t6nc,reddz95,0,Thu Apr 16 15:45:08 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but wikipedia content is created by anyone that wants to contribute, and this is highly influenced by what one IGN writer wrote.  I tend to take my definitions for words from the real dictionary. If you want to say realistic tactics, that is one thing, but to say tactics automatically means realistic tactics is not correct and UBI devs will continue to ignore us for just saying Siege is not tactical.   EDIT - The WIKIPEDIA PAGE IS BULLSHIT!  I just went to the links it references as justification for defining tactical and they are all just random articles about FPS games.  Even the IGN one doesn't DEFINE tactical to mean realistic.  That's the most bogus Wikipedia article since the ones Stephen Cobert had his audience update falsely.  Siege may be a much more a reflex shooter, but I stand by my comment that we need to quit with the incorrect rants saying Siege is not tactical, when even Mario Kart can be called ""tactical"" by the true definition."

They demonstrated in the first Alpha footage played by the UBI Devs that the game can be played tactically by people that communicate and know everything about the class system.  When I played Alpha, very few communicated well and even less understood what all the classes did and how to counter things.  People did not play the Alpha tactically much at all, though they could have.

Rainbow6,32qwut,Goracyi,5,Thu Apr 16 03:58:45 2015 UTC,"Highly disagree, the community is huge and the reason why you don't see many of them is because there are no games that cater to them since games like COD have taken over the gaming community.   But I will agree with you that Ubisoft will probably be more interested in the casual gamers that play games like COD since they would get more money but in the end their game will die out faster.   Casual gamers would buy it and probably be done with it less than a month while if you catered to experienced tactical gamers they will stick to your game longer and be more dedicated to the series in which they wouldn't mind shelling out money for DLC in the long run, in which possible could see their games involved in Esports.   In the end it comes down to money, it always does."
Rainbow6,32qwut,GV22,2,Thu Apr 16 02:28:22 2015 UTC,"I think the people who like arcade shooters will buy this game if it was arcade or tactical and the chances are they will only play it until the next arcade shooter is released anyway.  So Ubisoft might as well make the tactical shooter, get the money from the arcade shooter fans, and still retain their credibility for having made the better game.    Other games companies are taking chances by making difficult games and the sells back up their decisions.  (e.g. Bloodborne).    As you say, it comes down to money.  This game won't be COD or BF enough to retain the fan base they think they will court with the arcade elements.    It is very frustrating.  I think a small independent could make a decent tactical shooter for the next gen consoles and clean up.  It wouldn't have to be that clever.  Just make a shooter and remove the entire hud.  That in itself would make it different enough."

That is actually a really good point. A good bit of casuals will still buy the newest shooter just to say they have it, but it's very true they will move on once the new arcade shooter comes out; therefore, make your tactical game that will capture a few casual for a while. Once that time passes the casuals will move on but the hardcore will remain.  I think these companies are crazy to think they are going to take people away from CoD and BF."

There weren't enough questions dealing with the lack of realism and places to specifically hate the hitmarkers, outlines, and lack of doors.

Rainbow6,32noiu,trueleadr,8,Wed Apr 15 07:16:01 2015 UTC,"It's guaranteed beta access, but no where does it say it's the ONLY way into the beta. Plus charging you at the start of the beta is better then just about every other game, especially on steam, that just charges you on the spot when you pre-order."
Rainbow6,32noiu,Pest_AWC,10,Wed Apr 15 10:45:02 2015 UTC,"Never...ever...buy an UBI game in advance.  They have the shortest cycle of post-game support of all AAA publishers to try and save a few bucks.  Yes, I am sure they are trying to sucker the full price of the game out of people with the incentive to get the game early in Beta.  Wait a few months, and it will be in the $5 bargain bin like Vegas 2 was.  I think the fans of the original series are tired of being ignored on every new direction UBI tries to take R6.  The least they could have done was promised some type of HARDCORE or CLASSIC mode from the start, but no...they just want to get the NICHE of COD players that want small 5 VS 5 CQB games without respawn."
Rainbow6,32noiu,Derspy700,2,Wed Apr 15 13:37:38 2015 UTC,That's why we have Amazon...
Rainbow6,32noiu,CSKarasu,4,Wed Apr 15 14:52:40 2015 UTC,"There is nothing wrong with this.   Search the subreddit and you will see posts about cancelling preorders to get guaranteed beta access. This just addresses that problem.   The beta is a bonus of the transaction but it is still part of it. You're receiving part of what is promised to you when you accepted their terms, why shouldn't you pay for it? Because they're a big company? Because other companies don't charge you for the bonus and let you cancel if you want? They're not obliged to do anything like that."
Rainbow6,32noiu,tyhopkin,2,Wed Apr 15 14:15:30 2015 UTC,"Again I am not complaining that you have to pay for the game to get into the beta. I am merely pointing out that they will upgrade your Pre order to a full purchase when you get beta access. I only posted this as a warning to the many others who like myself think this game is going to be a tragic ending for this legendary franchise. They will not get my money for a cod clone. I would possibly play the beta if it was free but only because I have played rainbow six since I myself was about six, thus I can't help but but harbor some hope that they will come to their senses."
Rainbow6,32noiu,tyhopkin,1 point,Wed Apr 15 17:07:55 2015 UTC,"This doesn't change anything. You preorder it, get the code, register it and then cancel the preorder. This is what people have been doing. You can still do this on Uplay. You just can't do it once the beta starts which probably isn't going to happen until closer to the fall release. So I don't see how this addresses anything."
Rainbow6,32noiu,mixlunar,1 point,Wed Apr 15 22:10:01 2015 UTC,Search the subreddit and you will see posts about cancelling preorders to get guaranteed beta access. This just addresses that problem.   And why is that a problem?
Rainbow6,32noiu,EDstah,0,Wed Apr 15 15:30:00 2015 UTC,Don't be a douche. It was a bonus for people who preorder. If you buy then cancel just to get beta access you're an asshole.

Rainbow6,32noiu,Colinski282,1 point,Wed Apr 15 14:05:07 2015 UTC,This seems fair to me. If Ubi is guaranteeing your access into beta by pre-ordering the game they need the same guarantee from you that you wont cancel your pre-order.

I wasn't impressed with the Closed Alpha but i wanted to give them a chance even after not having too much fun playing the game... but as i was saying i wanted to give them a chance to change the problems. After the Alpha they realised that ppl actually wanted a Tactical Shooter... who knew?  YO UBISOFT Beta = Demo  you know what Demostrative wersion means ? A Closed Alpha with no innovations isn't demo... beta is not freaking Buying offer. I actually will us that stupid thing... OMG.. see what you did Ubi i used OMG like a fu..ing retard.... JESES!!
Rainbow6,32noiu,KX321,8,Wed Apr 15 08:44:03 2015 UTC,"The fuck ? a Beta isn't a demo. It's a test build, to test things. The point of Beta/Alpha accesses aren't to try the game and see if you'd buy it, it's to help them collect data and give as much feedback as possible."
Rainbow6,32noiu,Deosl,2,Wed Apr 15 10:23:19 2015 UTC,"You're right about what a beta should be. But this is far from it, when it's guaranteed for anyone who pre-orders they're just using it as an incentive for people to buy the game. If these people are charged for the full game when the beta starts, why would Ubisoft care about their feedback. They already have their money."
Rainbow6,32noiu,Goracyi,-1,Wed Apr 15 11:11:59 2015 UTC,"That's what the PR department wants you to think ;)  Most games these days are guilty of this. When was the last time you saw a demo for a game? ""Beta"" are todays demos, because they can pull the ""beta"" card and say, this isn't the final build to any major issues.   But yeah, early alpha is just a taste of the current state, things can change for the better or worse. It never represents the final product."
Rainbow6,32noiu,Deosl,1 point,Wed Apr 15 11:00:10 2015 UTC,Exaclly my point. Before 2005 we had Demos (i think) but then... pay to play a Beta.

Yes, please do go on and list games with proper demos. You failed on the first one, can you fail more? ;)  Demo is short for demonstration. A demonstration of what you can expect in the final product. It should be available at any time, how many games offer this today?

Rainbow6,32noiu,Deosl,2,Wed Apr 15 12:38:41 2015 UTC,"I was only pointing out that your pre-order turned into a full charge to get into the beta. Anyone who has been a long term fan of this franchise would never even consider buying this game to get into that beta after playing the alpha. I have played early versions of games before, and even in their beginnings they usually at least have the core concepts of the game already established. The direction that this rainbow is already headed is towards the development of silly gadgets and gimmicky game features. At this point one thing and one thing only should be the developers focus. The shooting mechanics and the guns. That is what rainbow is about.  Yes you have tools to assist you in specific situations, but you breach a door so you can SHOOT the enemy.  You flashbang a room so you can SHOOT the blinded guys inside. You want to make a good tactical shooter? Get the shooter part right and then work on the tactical part ubisoft."
Rainbow6,32noiu,Flachpfeife,-2,Wed Apr 15 12:17:24 2015 UTC,"so i have to buy the game to be able to play the beta and see if they fixed the fucked up alpha??  nice move, you ********"
Rainbow6,32pq1i,leteezer,1 point,Wed Apr 15 18:44:13 2015 UTC,"""If the attacking team has no indication of where the hostage is, they will be forced to clear each room one by one as a team.""  No, they would just look for the first barricade in general and know instantly where the hostage is as all the maps only have a few locations to spawn. Even if you could move them to unorthodox spots barricades would be near by and map familiarity would negate anything special 99% of the time.  Granted I would just put the hostage in front of barricades fire one bullet through and watch as the enemy eliminates the hostage.  Currently though people are punished harder for running through to ""What they deem safe"" by experienced players as you can just walk to an area outside of barricades and watch as the enemies run to ""Where they deem is safe to run to"" and instantly get shot in back.  Wildcards sound like a fun  addition though."
Rainbow6,32pq1i,Reapter,1 point,Fri Apr 17 19:35:12 2015 UTC,"But you need to understand, in the trailer the defenders could move the hostage, now they can't. When you could move the hostage, you'd have no idea where they were. If Ubisoft could just stick to their original idea that got people hyped in the first place, they wouldn't be having a problem with their fan base, would they?"
Rainbow6,32pq1i,ROTMGLilwern,0,Sat Apr 18 19:48:43 2015 UTC,"Those wlidcard ideas are pretty cool. That would be amazing actually. I would also support these kinds of game play changers if they popped up completely randomly even if there wasn't a voting system. I think the drones are okay but I would prefer if they didn't mark the hostage position or inform the defenders the hostage was spotted. I would also prefer if once the attackers got their hands on the hostages the defenders weren't notified either. All of this should be communicated and known via team work. I've watched defenders leave hostage unattended and create fire zones while leaving other areas undefended because they know all they have to do is run back in the room behind them once the attacker's escort notification alerts them that they are now in that room. That is magical knowledge, just like xray outlines and hit markers through walls and into darkness."

Rainbow6,32pd82,GV22,3,Thu Apr 16 13:31:07 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are right. Or if you could move your ""hostage"" like they showed IN THE FUC.... TRAILER!!!! But i digress."
Rainbow6,32pd82,Goracyi,2,Fri Apr 17 13:24:46 2015 UTC,"The fact that they removed the option for the defenders to move the hostage or use him/her as a shield really ruins a lot of cool intense moments in that gamemode. Also, and I'll take this to my grave, THE HEARBEAT SENSOR RUINS ALL GAMEMODES. IT RUINS THE WHOLE GAME. IT (insert average rant on this subreddit here.)"
Rainbow6,32pd82,ROTMGLilwern,2,Mon Apr 20 00:59:09 2015 UTC,"I especially like points 4,5 and 8. As far as 9 goes, there is no health regen, but for reviving players I'd like to see them come back with only 10% of their HP plus have a gimpy walk and no longer be able to move quickly.  On point 4, I agree, hostages should be movable by defenders. I like your idea of ""unknown overtime"" that's kind of cool. I could see pris and cons for it. Overall though I'd like to see 5 minute rounds, not 3.  Regarding point 5, split spawns would be great. Maybe make it so there can only be up to 2 split spawns so you don't get anything crazy like one man at 5 seperate points or something though. But I agree they should allow multiple entry angles. Especially considering you can sort if tell where attackers are coming from when the drones all roll in from the same direction.   On point 8, not only does sprint need to be taken out, but movement speed overall needs to be slowed down. Make it so players can't exploit movement mechanics like strafe dance shooting and drop shotting, etc."
Rainbow6,32pd82,iceycat,0,Wed Apr 15 18:06:58 2015 UTC,"Yea mostly i agree but lets say some stuff...  3. NO!! the heartbeat sensor is a classic for R6 so they can modify it like use only 2 times in a match but don't remove it comepletly. They made nice change insted of hearths you see hearth beat that is not exaclly wher the person is.  6. Well it will be missused by players the one plant before detonation is good.  9. Injure state should stay definitly if your oponent didnt hit you in the head or hearth then you should be able to get back up. Yea health regen should be out but not injure state.

The Vegas entries can at least be said to have been the most successful of the post Lockdown entries, but even these had plenty of ""arcade like"" features designed to dumb down gameplay. Seige seems to want to honor some of the roots in SOME ways while overtly mainstreaming and channeling other games such as Call of Duty and Battlefield in other ways. What you're left with is a Frankenstein mish mash of game play mechanics. People that hate Call of Duty type gameplay will hate that half of the gameplay mechanics. People that love CoD mechanics will be annoyed by the more hardcore aspects of the game. This game is half fast and half slow. It's half tactical and half spray and pray. Ubisoft needs to decide what kind of game it's making here.  You cannot please 100% of the market and this concept of casting the widest net possible is highly annoying. The CoD people are going to be frustrated with no respawns, no health regen, planning and prep phases, HAVING to communicate,  etc. Because those are not elements of CoD style play, yet you're giving them base CoD mechanics like hit markers, fast sprinting, kill cams, wall banging with hit markers or hbs, strafe dance shooting, drop shotting, tons of ammo and fast action and fast movement with short forced round time limits. THOSE mechanics are annoying the hardcore crowd and the Rainbow Six fanbase. (And WHY do you want to annoy THEM?????)"
Rainbow6,32owf9,MarkcusD,2,Wed Apr 15 15:54:12 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with that. Like you said they are trying to cast a faint ""net"" to draw the interest from all the markets but what was happened as it has just become irritating. Luckily its alpha so they can make some changes. Another thing is whether the game will keep a player base. Look at CS:GO the player base is increasing regularly and is growing in size. They also have tournaments. Rainbox Six Siege if kept with all the same features could not have a tournament."

Also that you like the gunplay is... interesting to hear, i find it lacking any punch to it whatsoever and lacking originality and recoil ;).  This is not a rainbow six game though and lacks alot of tactical depth. Not taking away any of your fun in that regard but just saying as i stopped being the target audience obviously a couple years ago."
Rainbow6,32p3y6,Lancezh,1 point,Wed Apr 15 18:14:18 2015 UTC,"In relation to CoD as of late which is mostly what I've played in, it's seems to have much more room of tactical play than CoD. I never played the original Raven shield or Rogue spear so I can't comment on those and from what I heard, were really more tactical. I guess I just like being able to do things such as breaching, making my own paths or wall gaps etc as opposed to just running around a map without any regard to the map infrastructure.  Maybe it will get better or tweaked for Beta and will get you back into it :P"
Rainbow6,32p3y6,Lancezh,3,Wed Apr 15 18:57:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's obvious you come from CoD and also that you never played the originals. If they wouldn't slap the name Rainbow 6 on it i wouldn't have a problem. It has also nothing to do with not caring about map infrastructure, a tactical shooter is not defined by how many walls you can or can't break. It's just way to gimmicky, and you're clearly going for killstreaks and stuff..."
Rainbow6,32p3y6,Lancezh,1 point,Wed Apr 15 20:55:27 2015 UTC,"Killstreaks? Did you play the alpha? There are no Killstreaks. You have to kill to win the game, not sure what you were expecting. Winning rounds by the taking the most footage of them through a drone camera? This is not much like CoD, you don't win rounds by running anywhere you want to go. Instead, not moving much or backtracking through intel wins out over random movement with no regard to the elements or ""gimmicks"" of the walls being punched out.    I'm not saying the game is the epitome of ""tactical"". All I was saying is that it feels much more tactical than the recent CoD games."

Rainbow6,32lmjd,KriHal,1 point,Tue Apr 14 19:50:20 2015 UTC,"The developers said pre Alpha release that they will not have that much ammo in game's final version, but they wanted to give way more than needed to see what people did with it. They will compile data on how many rounds were used to actually kill people in matches and recalculate total reserve ammo from there. It's intentionally too much for Alpha purposes.   Out of all your points I think the biggest one is doors. I don't know how you can have a CQB breach and clear FPS without them. The door is the single most important element when breaching a room, yet they don't even have doors?!? I get barricades,  really I do. You could still have some open doorways for barricades while mixing in at least SOME physical doors.  Especially exterior entry points. Doors that you try to place a barricade on would just get reinforced instead and the door would become a fixed barricade of sorts much like the other barricades. Non reinforced doors could still open and close like normal. No reason not to implement this. At least not any reason that can't be solved."
Rainbow6,32lmjd,iceycat,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:19:08 2015 UTC,"One other thing I think I'll miss this the gimping of players, where a wounded player hobbles around instead of moving and shooting at full potential.  Agree with most of the rest, except that I think instead of playing terrorists the other team could be some forgien antagonist (maybe a Russian or Chinese team)."
Rainbow6,32lmjd,nickwitucki,-1,Tue Apr 14 23:29:12 2015 UTC,They are still Terrorists. You need to look up the definition of Terrorists.
Rainbow6,32lmjd,imasssssssssssssnake,1 point,Wed Apr 15 06:37:19 2015 UTC,"One thing I'd like to point out on the ammo: If you watch the gameplay footage from before the Alpha, you'll see that they don't have much ammo. I'm assuming they padded on more ammo for the alpha to avoid an awkward no-ammo moment.  A related fellow-gamer warning, try to avoid the ""realism"" slippery slope. Justify your opinions related to gameplay from a gamer's perspective."
Rainbow6,32lmjd,scroll_tro0l,7,Tue Apr 14 21:01:52 2015 UTC,"You do not avoid the ""realism slippery slope"", especially in a Rainbow Six game, and EVEN MORE especially when Ubisoft promised a return to the roots.   Rainbow Six differentiated itself from the likes of Quake and Doom back in the day because it offered highly realistic and slow paced gameplay. The old titles straddled simulator territory while not outright being one.   I agree with many of the points OP has highlighted here: Movement is too fast, recoil is nonexistent in ADS, no doors, different looking characters that make your team look like a team of mercenaries rather than an organized counter terror team, etc.   In addition to my personal gripes: Hitmarkers, teammate silhouettes, infinite revives, weak bullets, Call of Duty instakill knife, sprinting, quick stance change, white indicator arrow pointing to enemies who can see you, no point shooting (you are forced to use ADS to fire off any accurate shots), laser pinpoint accurate ADS, extremely fast snap to ADS, no fatigue system, no gimping (movement/accuracy penalty depending on limb hit), ammo pool over magazine system, etc."
Rainbow6,32lmjd,trineroks,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:15:56 2015 UTC,I agree with all of this. I mean maybe they can keep the knives/grenades but make us equip them and have knife animations similar to BF?
Rainbow6,32l2m2,Harvey_Dole,4,Tue Apr 14 17:27:57 2015 UTC,Thanks!! So we do not know if it's only deactivated for the alpha version ? That would be very weird if they decide to completely remove that.
Rainbow6,32l2m2,iamda5h,3,Tue Apr 14 17:51:20 2015 UTC,"I really hope they bring this back into the game. Also, hostage reactions would be a great feature to increase immersion, like they had in the gameplay trailer."
Rainbow6,32l2m2,iceycat,3,Tue Apr 14 18:21:28 2015 UTC,"I'm SO disappointed in the change from the hostage in the E3 demo to the one they had in the Alpha!!!!!! The one in the E3 game play had emotion and personality. You could feel the fear, panic and desperation that character had. You WANTED to go rescue the hostage because you could empathize with the character. And YES,  it WAS a character, not a human shaped flag to be captured like it is now.  I REALLY hope this was an Alpha thing and that the final game hostages will be more like what we saw at E3!!!!"
Rainbow6,32l2m2,iamda5h,2,Tue Apr 14 21:07:47 2015 UTC,"me too! There are so many possibilities with the hostages. They could say things, point at things as you escort them..."
Rainbow6,32l2m2,Pest_AWC,3,Tue Apr 14 21:42:16 2015 UTC,"You could even slowly nudge the hostage around back in Ravenshield, but they took that away with the Siege Alpha.  I hope they put it back too.  Make a defender have a choice to waste his re-enforce walls time by slowly moving the hostage instead, or slowly move it after the drones find it, so it isn't EXACTLY where they think it will be.  Oh, and only show the location where the hostage was last confirmed...do NOT let offense magically know where it is moving to."
Rainbow6,32l2m2,Dan_Biddle,2,Tue Apr 14 18:57:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah exactly.. It was THE thing that made the hostage interesting . If the hostage is not moving, it's essentially the same concept as a bomb desactivation in the other games."
Rainbow6,32l2m2,Deosl,3,Tue Apr 14 19:02:18 2015 UTC,"I think that it should be put in. Also if defenders move the hostage after drones find them and the move is not spotted by the attackers, then the diamond that shows where the hostage is, should stay where they last confirmed they were."
Rainbow6,32l2m2,chemx32,2,Tue Apr 14 20:34:23 2015 UTC,Sadly this feature was removed in the closed alpha.

Rainbow6,32lw8a,trineroks,8,Tue Apr 14 21:04:54 2015 UTC,"Although I am on board with you here, I can't help but feel that Ubisoft will not do much to really bring this game to its roots. Just look at what they created before we gave our feedback. They literally created a COD game with a retarded rainbow 6 twist to it. I am afraid that they are not willing to drastically change the game around to truly be in line with its roots simply because it's easier to make a game like COD that appeases that type of gamer."
Rainbow6,32lw8a,GimiZigi,7,Tue Apr 14 21:14:18 2015 UTC,"this. i mean, they called vegas a TACTICAL shooter. i broke a headset on a wall on release day when i played the first match"

Rainbow6,32lw8a,CombustibLemons,7,Tue Apr 14 21:22:19 2015 UTC,"I agree that there is a ton of work to turn Siege into a tactical shooter (because as it stands right now, it most definitely is not one). But I don't think going around saying the game is dead would help the cause.   I have a lot of doubts because it's Ubisoft, but the best we can do at the moment is continue voicing constructive criticism. Once we get the beta we will know 100% for sure if the devs were serious about making a tactical shooter or not."
Rainbow6,32lw8a,trineroks,3,Tue Apr 14 21:29:10 2015 UTC,"Add Vegas 2, I was a big fan."
Rainbow6,32lw8a,Pest_AWC,2,Wed Apr 15 02:32:01 2015 UTC,"Upvoting you because you've been downvoted, but tbh Vegas probably has less than half the depth of the old Rainbow Six games.  I started out with Vegas 2 on the PS3 as well then tried out Raven Shield on Steam years later, and trust me; the Vegas series is not as tense or cerebral as the older series. The only real thing I loved about Vegas was the squad AI and command interface, which allowed you to make decisions quickly and seamlessly."
Rainbow6,32lw8a,CombustibLemons,2,Wed Apr 15 07:45:43 2015 UTC,"Nothing about Vegas 1 or 2 and its magical 3rd person cover view with non matching multicolor teams, no lean or prone, and health regen had anything to do with the Rainbow Six books and realistic feel of the original 3 games...other than it had working doors (but not fluid/partial like Ravenshield)."

Rainbow6,32ndjc,youkidswantcandy,2,Wed Apr 15 04:16:19 2015 UTC,"So many frustrating moments in the alpha or maybe I am just overreacting because I was so annoyed at how poor I found the gameplay.  You had people barricading entries and exits immediately, not allowing people to go out and barricade other areas, place jammers or barbwire and others barricading while the rest of the team were actually out reinforcing. So you spent half of the time pulling down and replacing barricades.  You had others who wouldn't do anything apart from camp themselves in a corner from the very first second and either didn't care about anything other than getting the most kills or were too lazy to actually research how to use gadgets.  There were several teammates within metres of you who couldn't spare 5secs to revive you or barricade that open doorway they just ran straight through but they were happy to unleash a couple of nades in your general direction without hesitation despite you being lit-up like a Xmas tree with your big white outline.  Overall, the alpha was just a really disappointing and infuriating experience.  /rant."
Rainbow6,32ndjc,Jonesy777,1 point,Wed Apr 15 08:55:02 2015 UTC,"True that mate, but the experience was much better when I managed to play with friends and people who knew how the game worked and communicated actively.   I expect the experience will be much better with friends and you co-ordinate your tactics instead of everyone doing their own thing and just camping for 3 minutes.   When the game relies heavely on teamwork and using each class correctly, it sucks when none of these are experienced in the game.  The press/influencers had a whopping 1 hour of explaining from the devs before playing, they really need to communicate the class roles better in the game loadout menu."
Rainbow6,32ndjc,Deosl,1 point,Wed Apr 15 10:04:09 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I agree, I actually enjoyed it when I managed to squad up with players with mics who actually bothered communicating and playing as tactical as we could given what we had.  There should definitely have been a tutorial or training option within the alpha to better help people understand where, when and how to use gadgets. I did notice there was a guide on the alpha feedback forums but that wasn't sufficient.  Unfortunately even when you were trying to help and guide people and offer advice they didn't really care, just abusing you saying ""it's just an alpha, STFU""."

Rainbow6,32lcgn,iamda5h,9,Tue Apr 14 18:37:35 2015 UTC,"I don't like the idea of seperate modes because you fracture the community even further when it comes to matchmaking. Check out CoD or Battlefield's hardcore play lists.  According to the on screen population stats when compared to standard TDM there is something like a 30:1 disparity in available players between the modes. So when you play hardcore modes you have WAY less people to match up against. Hardcore mode should just be the way the game is played. No hit markers or friendly magic xray outlines, slower movement speeds and fix the loopholes that allow people to strafe dance shoot and drop shot (team colors should be a thing though blue/tan or something) Everyone will play on whatever the standard mode is. Keep on mind all they've shown so far is a hostage rescue mode, there will be other modes than that already. No need to splinter thimgs further."

Rainbow6,32lcgn,Pest_AWC,1 point,Tue Apr 14 19:32:50 2015 UTC,"That would be nice. I suggested this because it seems like they are trying to make the game appeal to a larger audience, and multiple game modes could help with that."

Rainbow6,32lcgn,GetOffMyLawnKid,2,Tue Apr 14 19:07:20 2015 UTC,"It has been touched on slightly in an article I read.   It is in our current plans to also allow custom session hosts to disable HUD elements for everyone participating in the match. This includes hit markers and teammate highlights.   And the following comment basically sums up exactly what direction this game is going in...   It’s important to us that players of all skill levels feel like their shot matters. The Hit Marker is an obvious feedback to help you understand if you hit your target or not. Yes, our most avid fan probably learned to play back when Hit Markers, Aim Assist (that we won’t have in Rainbow Six Siege), etc. didn’t exist. But today, its features that we need to think about.   No 3rd party run servers will be a killer there though as Ubi will still have overall control of those servers. So basically it's Ubi's way or no way."

I always play in hardcore mode.  Siege looked really promising with a more realistic and tactical approach.  But, from what I saw the alpha is really far from being different. I prefer the hardcore mode of BF4 rather than playing with hitmarkers, crosshair, regen… (WE dont have this shit in BF4… Even the knife attack is more realistic.  You can easily counter them).  I'm not a fan of games like Arma but Siege is really far from attractive with its super fast gameplay. I hope UBI will change this… The footage at the E3 was way better."

Rainbow6,32hbzh,DGL_Link,3,Mon Apr 13 20:38:22 2015 UTC,"I like the drones, but maybe just have one guy have them as his special ability or whatever and they would be used at the start of the round. Then planning phase would be just like you say. Drawing on the map is SO useful. Also dropping on some quick icons ala Ravenshield would be good too. Have like a breach icon or a rappel icon or whatever so you don't always have to draw. Finally allow split spawns so everyone doesn't always spawn at the same spot that way attackers can flank or distract as needed to allow other members to move in maybe all 5 going to different spots is a bit much, but allow to split between maybe 2 spawns or something."
Rainbow6,32hbzh,iceycat,2,Mon Apr 13 21:19:15 2015 UTC,"2 Spawns for offense would be great, but so would 8 man teams to split the team into 4 man squads.

Rainbow6,32hbzh,MarkcusD,3,Tue Apr 14 02:07:38 2015 UTC,Make the round 1 min longer and get rid of the drones all together. I preferred the rnds when we had to search for the hostage.
Rainbow6,32hbzh,Jonesy777,2,Mon Apr 13 23:18:16 2015 UTC,"+1  The drones seems absolutely futile for two reasons:   The defenders get a good idea of where the attackers are spawning based on where the drones enter the house or plane which in-turn encourages spawn killing; & as you mentioned, you can generally guess where the hostage is 99% of the time based on where the barricades, barbwire and defenders are located without needing to get a drone near the hostage."
Rainbow6,32hbzh,Speciou5,2,Tue Apr 14 01:16:00 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind more planning, but the drones as a concept work. They let the CTs do stuff while the Ts are building. It also varies the game and can add counter-play/interesting situations if things deviate from the norm (e.g. Drones can't spot hostage, Ts mislead drones by fake reinforcing another spawn).  They can probably be improved, but I don't think removing them is necessary. The game would get much more stale if hostage was just instantly identified."
Rainbow6,32hbzh,duckandweave,2,Tue Apr 14 03:22:42 2015 UTC,"you know you can access the drones in game after the initial search right? found it really helpful for scouting the corners and rooms, so you know where to creach etc. kind of like the old snake cameras."

Rainbow6,32hbzh,sonoblink,1 point,Tue Apr 14 01:49:05 2015 UTC,Exactly pest also after the hostage is found the bloody timer still counts down ^ As you say 1 player only with the drone and the other guys could even scout out the perimeter or something. What about a practice range or gunsmith like GR you could get lost for a minute or 2 there easy)
Rainbow6,32hbzh,AlchemeticZ,1 point,Tue Apr 14 05:59:29 2015 UTC,"What if the attackers got outside cameras instead of the drones?  They could see which windows are getting boarded first,  which the defenders could use to trick the attackers.  The defenders would be encouraged to branch out and falsely fortify other rooms to trick the attackers.  Not sure if it would be too one sided towards the attackers,  but that might be solvable with a longer round time."
Rainbow6,32hbzh,katanapuffin,1 point,Tue Apr 14 06:52:57 2015 UTC,The drones gives the attacker's spawn at the defensor (sorry for my bad english) Delete the drones from the game
Rainbow6,32hbzh,scroll_tro0l,1 point,Tue Apr 14 09:46:19 2015 UTC,"Replies seem, mostly, unanimous with OP; I'm not playing devil's advocate, I honestly disagree.  I've had matches where the team got the hostage location down to two locations and ended up losing because we had to split up and lost people/time because of this.  However, more than the attackers, the defense team gets more out of these drones when the assault team uses them properly. As mentioned by @AlchemeticZ I've put up barricades in the wrong places before to confuse assault teams that have not found the hostage. This makes the defense team balance running around the house putting up barricades and looking (or dedicating a player) to drone-hunt so the strategy works.  Also, as mentioned by several other people, the drones have uses during the combat period as well. Once the game is well off assume that teams will no longer all be camping at the exact VIP location; they'll be spread out within the map looking to drop assault members who are tunnel-visioned to the VIP location.  Lastly, even if you disagree with all of these features, what are you losing? I don't recall the exact length of the drone period but I believe it's either a minute or less than a minute. Are you honestly bored from just a few seconds of driving the drone? If so, and I'm not being a fan boy here, the devs won't be able to help you with that."

Rainbow6,32g39j,DL-Z_ftw,8,Mon Apr 13 18:44:43 2015 UTC,"Can’t Ignore the Good:  Graphics: Some people are complaining, but they look fine to me. The smoke effects are good, and linger as appropriate. There’s not too much flashy stuff going on that makes it unnecessarily hard to spot enemies. Besides, it wouldn’t be a Rainbow game if the graphics weren’t a couple years behind the cutting edge ;)   Gadgets: They’re slightly off-beat for an R6 game, but add more than they detract for sure. The wire slows down the CT to help create a defensive choke point if used smartly, and the placed shield can disrupt a CTs path just enough or provide dynamic cover to make it more interesting. Gas grenades aren’t working for me but look good in videos. Barbed wire should affect both side’s players equally, however.  Drones: This is the sort of thing needed when people talk about a new Rainbow game. It fits thematically, doesn’t seem overpowered, and the ability to resume control over it means there’s value in the Ts disabling them. If a CT plays it right, that drone is a lot of use mid-round – or it is unless the T sprints around the map firing full-auto… I like that the Ts have a counter to it, but right now it is load-time biased; I’m on a slower machine and usually spawn last which means if I’m T the drones are already past where I want to put the jammer and if I’m CT usually the jammer is down before I’m inside the building.  Format: I really like the switching after each round. In CS:GO if teams play a lopsided map it can be demoralizing to start the second half down 12-3. Switching every rounds is a good way to avoid that steamrolling effect.  Pick-up and play: I have very limited time to play games; the fluidity with which I was able to fire up the game and get in a match even in Alpha was very nice. Obviously more robust party and matchmaking systems are needed, but I think it’s a good strong foundation.  Build quality: This is an Alpha that plays like a Beta. You can tell that this will have AAA polish on it when it ships (or it SHOULD unless they screw up hard).  Crawling: While nobody in the world with half a brain would lay down in a CQB environment, I do like the seated/scooting animation they have for when you’re backing up. It looks way better when you’re up against a wall than you normally see in a game.  Overall concept: I feel like the developers do know what a Rainbow game is. It doesn’t immediately look like they do, but it feels like they’re trying to get a Rainbow game made while someone is yelling FPS-standard design protocols at them. If we the community can speak loud enough (and praise the gaming lords we’ve been given these opportunities for feedback) I think the devs might be allowed to make the game they want, and I think that’s a game that a lot of series fans will enjoy. Just hope that someone making decisions is actually listening."
Rainbow6,32g39j,AlexandreLauz,3,Mon Apr 13 14:49:28 2015 UTC,Gooooood Feedback
Rainbow6,32g39j,Incursus,3,Tue Apr 14 03:07:50 2015 UTC,I get worked up a bit when discussing this game because it's one of my favorite franchises and Rogue Spear was the first major obsession in online gaming. Thanks for your level-headed and very valid critique of the game. I truly feel that if the changes you mentioned were worked into the game that this release will be significantly better than what we're seeing now.
Rainbow6,32g39j,Harvey_Dole,2,Mon Apr 13 16:55:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the kind words, this is definitely a topic close to my heart as well."
Rainbow6,32g39j,trineroks,3,Mon Apr 13 17:29:50 2015 UTC,Good feedback
Rainbow6,32g39j,Eliteops143,4,Mon Apr 13 16:26:43 2015 UTC,Thanks! Least I could do as a fan.
Rainbow6,32g39j,Pest_AWC,3,Mon Apr 13 16:36:11 2015 UTC,"Well, the Alpha's over so all we can do now is wait and see.   I can't say I have a whole lot of faith in Ubisoft, but I won't chalk this up as a lost cause just yet."
Rainbow6,32g39j,AlexandreLauz,3,Mon Apr 13 22:37:52 2015 UTC,"Perfect! I was about to write a lengthy review when I came across this one instead.   I agree with many of the things you said, and I do want to emphasize certain points you mentioned which, to me, are deal-breakers when considering buying this game:   Heartbeat sensor – nerf it by reducing the range or remove it entirely Recoil – add it Hit-markers - get rid of them, period Threat-indicators - get rid of them; there should be no need for them/fix the audio so you can tell without-a-doubt where people are shooting from   Reduce strafing speed while aiming-down-the-sights    I played the Alpha extensively and thought it was very fun. I liked working together with my team and using the proper gadgets to counter the enemy's tactics (placed a jammer behind a reinforced wall, huh? How about an emp and thermite breach combo? or a grenade launcher from a distance?; Enemy camped behind a shield? Use a drone to sneak up on them and piss them off; Reinforced a door with bullet-proof barricades? Good, it'll cover my approach as we simultaneously breach the door and the wall, etc.). However, I find the heartbeat sensor just ruins the game for me. If our entire team is camping in a room, part of the excitement is not knowing where the enemy is coming from. Once someone pulls out a heartbeat sensor, that excitement devolves into plain camping.... and it becomes very unlikely that we'll lose unless we seriously f**k up. In other words, it skews the risk/reward ratio towards reward-without-risk... which is far less exciting.  The rest of my complaints fall in-line with other common complaints; hit-markers give the shooter way-too-much intel, threat indicators are just dumb UI clutter, and strafing speed is just ridiculous. I've seen people fly past doorways while strafing and I kept thinking it was lag. It just seems unrealistic and reminds me of crouch-dancing in the old rainbow six games."
Rainbow6,32g39j,Flachpfeife,7,Tue Apr 14 03:36:05 2015 UTC,"I agree.  This sounds like most of these in-depth reviews are asking for the same things to be added/removed.  I doubt we will see much change though...I keep hoping our comments will at least shape the next R6, but that has not been the case either.  They ignore everything and start from scratch and by the time we comment the next crazy design is already set in stone like Siege is."
Rainbow6,32g39j,Dang3rouspeach,6,Mon Apr 13 16:30:02 2015 UTC,All we can do is make noise and cross our fingers.

Honestly I think one of the biggest changes they could make would be to add a planning period after the scouting and building period where teams could draw shit on maps that sorta thing"
Rainbow6,32g2e0,WubSt3p,5,Mon Apr 13 17:28:46 2015 UTC,And the realism.  You could get immersed in the older Rainbow Six games because they felt so real and so lethal. You couldn't crazily sprint around the place. You had to take short precise shots instead of aiming down the sights for laser pinpoint accuracy while spraying a hail of bullets. You'd see players leaning around corners since it was the most effective method of peeking. You saw players being a lot more cautious with their playstyle because of the high lethality and lack of revives. You had to rely on your eyes and ears for your surroundings and actively communicate with your teammates on positioning and status. And the slow pacing just built up the tension for that one unexpected firefight.
Rainbow6,32g2e0,trineroks,14,Mon Apr 13 18:28:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks Panda, let's see if UBI can make the hard decision to delay the game and put the time needed for the changes and additions requested.  Otherwise, this will just be another completely different direction you have taken with the R6 franchise and it will muddy the waters even further."
Rainbow6,32g2e0,Pest_AWC,-2,Mon Apr 13 22:52:29 2015 UTC,"Lol it's Ubi, you think they will risk their larger profit margin to satisfy the RS fans?

They know their target demographic, the CoD community will lap this up any way."
Rainbow6,32g2e0,ItzWolfeh,3,Mon Apr 13 16:33:35 2015 UTC,"I beg to differ.  I love unrealistic stuff as well as hardcore, but if I want to play COD I'll play COD and not some watered down 5 VS 5 CQB no respawn version of COD.  They may not have understood the direction they took with this game would not only alienate it's own fanbase, but only target a NICHE of the casual fans they were hoping for."
Rainbow6,32g2e0,Pest_AWC,5,Mon Apr 13 21:24:39 2015 UTC,"I won't lie, I am very keen to see just what changes come from all that feedback considering a lot of it was centred around a few things specifically outside of all the expected alpha bugs of course. Without some drastic changes I am afraid I'll be sitting this one out so hopefully Ubi can pull a rabbit out of a hat and surprise me.

Do not let it become a shooter anonymous, but work to make it a original title! This winter will come  AAA FPS , as battlefront and the odious CoD, so R6 might have a good chance to carve out its space. At the moment the game has its own core but is full of defects that revolve around. From italians fans we request: - reduce the speed of movements and strafing -add doors -improve the netcode -add more destruction on the maps   (in this alpha after 1 hour of gameplay I understood the point where it was possible to blow up the walls) this forced the gameplay and and it does become more scripted. -the drones at the start ruins the game because i understood from where the attackers come and where the defenders build their defense...this is a spoiler for the game! xD -Improve the sound of weapons and footsteps overall -LESS HUD, like the allies border (this is one of most important points) I think these are the main points from which you should take a cue and improve the game.

If your doing point working the perimeter you don't have much time to identify players  like you do covering & protecting the hosage. The white outline works at some distance but not so good up close.  The icons could also do with some work!

After this, i changed my gamestyle and played very tactical with my team, using flashbangs and other tactics. I liked the alpha and i hope we can test the beta soon, because i really love how they evolve the game. It is faster, but i am sure, they will add some server side options you can use later in the game, like disable crosshair and on.  I totaly agree with the silencer, but it should only be available for the Police. A minimap is overrated, it also would totaly destroy the game experience and surprise moment, because everyone can see on the minimap, who is dead and on.

Dedicated servers is a must if they want to live a long shelf life. and I hate being locked from using certain guns with certain operators"
Rainbow6,32gtko,forzaitalia458,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:45:58 2015 UTC,"First and foremost, I'd like to see a map editor, even if it's buggy, unstable, limited, and difficult to use. With a map editor, we'd all still be playing new Terrorist Hunts in R6V2. If the devs collected the best community maps every so often and offered them as free DLC for consoles, everyone walks away happy, and there's constant new content at no cost to the devs after the initial investment of getting community mapping tools out.  I'd like to see DLCs add new game modes such as Terrorist Hunt, Pilot, Kamikaze, or symmetric competing objectives such as recovering a few contested items (choose from the full pool of operators!). You Raven Shield/R6V2 fans know what I'm talking about.  I'd actually be okay with them selling operators if it means important content like maps, game modes, and bug fixes are provided free-of-charge. (Or if there's a map editor! In that case, Ubi selling operators with new gadgets/abilities is basically selling new features you can use for your maps. It'd be awesome.)"
Rainbow6,32f563,Deosl,7,Mon Apr 13 07:55:21 2015 UTC,"I am not a supporter of petitions launched for everything and anything, but regarding this subject I want to say that it is required.  The words of Ubisoft on this subject are not justified. It's time to bang our fists on the table. Now it is time to understand that we are sick of this kind of decisions that do not hold the road.  Deosl very well said it, how in 2015 for a game like Siege, which wants a competitive multiplayer game, it does not give the opportunity to the players / clans rent their own server?  Raven Shield offered this opportunity and we were in 2003.  (sorry for my english)."
Rainbow6,32f563,n0ra,5,Mon Apr 13 10:15:24 2015 UTC,"Player-run servers are a major part of CS's long success as a competitive shooter. You can have the matchmaking alongside player-run servers. There is no reason to limit one for the other. Scrims, leagues, and tournaments really can't happen if they have to rely on local hosting or your matchmaking.  I desperately want this game to do well and be the shooter I play, but without competitive play the longevity of the game just goes away. Esports can be a sales driver long after release if you make a good competitive game. Take CS:GO for example, it has 450k players playing right now, only 200k less than DOTA2, being the second biggest game on steam by a mile. TF2, the 3rd most popular, has 60k. Why you might ask? Esports. People are inspired by pro play and want to play more and get better. CS:GO is still #2 in Top Sellers after all of this time because of it.   Intentionally crippling your game by not having player-run servers makes me feel like you want the game to die off after the initial sales so you can stop supporting it like so many other games in the past. This isn't what your players want. This certainly isn't what I want. I want the game to last for years and grow a competitive scene so I have a reason to play it for more than a few months. Competitive play constantly raises the bar for average play and forces everyone to rise with it."

Its competitiveness. I feel like the issue of developers not providing tools for clans/teams to compete has become way to prevalent. Idk why this is, but I remember constantly running into it on PS3 countless times when I was looking for the next shooter to play with my team. More recently Destiny had this issue, which is even more mind boogling since they freaking made Halo.  Developers in the shooter space or even any team-based game need to understand this: Long after the casual observer buys the game because its new or looked cool, they shortly proceed to shelve it or trade it in. The players who last typically tend to be the competitive players, who play with a team and keep the game going long after its release. Competitive play adds to the replay value tremendously. I really wish developers understood this."

The only counter-argument in favor of HBS is that if you ensure that your own team is working together, flashing and clearing every room, then the HBS isn't a big problem... Maybe that's the purpose, to make it harder for the Assaulters to win without working as a team... IF so, then sure, leave it in...

Rainbow6,32f097,WubSt3p,3,Mon Apr 13 13:58:45 2015 UTC,"EXCELLENT review. I tried looking for something I disagreed with and couldn't find it. A gew things I would add to it though are: a mandatory removal of movement exploits. Things like strafe dance shooting and drop shotting shouldn't be possible.  Slow strafe speed WAY down and make accuracy suck while doing so, also make a delay for stance switching and make it so you can't switch stances while running. Drop shotting and strafe dancing are cheap and unrealistic movement exploits.   Really glad you mentioned fire selector switch and weapon attachments. These are a must, we need to control our rates of fire, right now everything is sprau and pray. Also with everything iron sights that gets a little old too, red dots, etc. Would be good add ons. I also can't agree enough how important it is to be able to choose your weapon. I love playing with M4 style weapons but if I don't pick my guy fast enough I'll lose it, worse, what if the ability of one guy is what works best for my play style, but that character only has weapons that I don't like? Not cool. I don't mind locked abilities but we should be able to pick the weapons.  Also Doors. What else can you say on that? You were spot on in everything you said."

I'm often in a skype call with friends and dammit I want to be able to talk to my friends without confusing my in game team with mindless banter.  I like the wood barriers situationally, but I think doors absolutely should be a thing if the situation warrents (i.e. the house level)  I'm okay with killcams, but dead players should not be able to communicate with live ones.  No ghosting pls  The big thing I'm feeling unsure about is how lethal the guns should be.  If black ops taught us anything, high lethality is not always good.  If everything is a 1 or 2 shot kill then the highest firerate or highest hip-fire accuracy has a severe advantage over guns.  This could be perhaps countered by other things like penetration capabilities and such.  The last thing I'm wondering is why do we get so much ammo?  I would honestly love to see like a 2 clip limit, I can't say I'm an expert on the matter but I doubt in a siege type operation like some of these maps entail operators go in with 250 bullets and just spray everything."

Rainbow6,32eusg,PinguRambo,2,Mon Apr 13 11:26:30 2015 UTC,"Seems fair then, although I don't see it affecting things as much if the maps are similar. Like I'd see the advantages between and FMJ and a Hollow for example, but this is just the round changing, not the magazine itself."
Rainbow6,32eusg,PinguRambo,1 point,Mon Apr 13 12:54:54 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  I don't know if you've played to Raven shield, but it was one of the two equipment you were allowed to take with you. Having a big fat charger was a game changer while defending a position..."
Rainbow6,32eusg,PinguRambo,2,Mon Apr 13 12:59:31 2015 UTC,"I haven't, but in this concept, if the difference was only the size, I don't see why everyone didn't just pick up the larger one. I see only 2 ways of implementing this concept:    Make the reload time longer for the bigger magazine. Have a point system, where you can for example chose only 3 attachments for your gun, this counting as one of these attachments. (I'm heavily against this idea) I just thought of a last one, add fatigue into the game, and make the person using a larger magazine (obviously heavier) tired faster."
Rainbow6,32eusg,GetOffMyLawnKid,1 point,Mon Apr 13 13:06:38 2015 UTC,"It was a combination of the three.  It was longer to reload, we only had 2 customization option for balance reason and we were tired quicker with bigger magazines. Impacting moving speed and, most importantly, aiming stability.  I mentioned the stamina a couple of times in my own Siege review"
Rainbow6,32eusg,Brethon,1 point,Mon Apr 13 13:32:07 2015 UTC,let both teams stay in lobby and plan...   Please no on this. I played tons of R63 and remember clans just sitting in lobbies chatting endlessly. I prefer just starting the game and playing.    If you do have teams that wish to coordinate let them do it on their own time.  Or do it on the fly.
Rainbow6,32eusg,Livinpink,2,Mon Apr 13 13:56:10 2015 UTC,"I was talking maybe a minute with both teams having voice chat between them, not more than a minute tho."
Rainbow6,32ghqw,Jumbify,2,Mon Apr 13 16:38:34 2015 UTC,"I feel like defending Master Bedroom was way too easy if you had a competent castle player,  board the window and both doors. Fortify kids bedroom walls that connect to it.  And really the solution is very simple, there is a window that for some reason can't be broken. Allow more entry points to it. Maybe add a new window to that corner everyone hides in. (The one close to the bathroom)"
Rainbow6,32ghqw,Arvenor,2,Mon Apr 13 16:48:08 2015 UTC,"For map balance allow split spawns. No reason three people can't start in one section and two others spawn in another or whatever combination you want. This would allow flanking and diversionary tactics. Once you see the drones all roll in you know exactly where they're coming from right now.  Also not having such limitations on where you breach floors and ceilings. Would open up mote dynamic options. Some extetior breaches would be good too. The garage doors are a good example of this, but more could be done. Especially top of plane or rooftop breaches.  Having unbreakable windows is a sin, that's a freebie for defenders.   In the E3 demo defenders were seen moving the hostage as a tactic. That should still be a thing you can do as well.  We've seen the house in both day and night flavors, having that option for each map would be good for variety as well. You would shift the balance for attackets approaching the syructure on night missions and you could have rooms with no lights for balance shifts in favor of defense to compensate."

Rainbow6,32ezet,WubSt3p,1 point,Mon Apr 13 18:30:47 2015 UTC,"This is not a true statement. Of course a test build is going to have bugs but this is free QA, thousands of people playing your game will find many more bugs than a testing team of 10 or 20 people. That is game development 101, alpha/betas are for finding bugs AND gameplay issues. As it stands, its hard to comment on gameplay because of the baseline issues present."
Rainbow6,32ezet,natethegr3at,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:02:53 2015 UTC,"Maybe I shouldn't have been so polarized on the issue, fixing bugs is always a goal but at this point there is still a lot up in the air to change, so many bugs that are currently in the game might not even be relevant if a feature gets removed or changed.  Bug fixing is great yes, but primarily the focus is on other things, then it would shift more to bug fixing in the beta stages."

Rainbow6,32e4pe,RealityKing4Hire,2,Mon Apr 13 02:54:02 2015 UTC,I created a thread on hacks about a week ago but the devs did not respond. I hope they give us a votekick option at least. Full admin abilities would be even better.
Rainbow6,32fk4p,Plueschkuecken,1 point,Mon Apr 13 11:46:09 2015 UTC,"Hello! Yes it is possible to move the hostage. At the begining of every round, during the planning phase, you can vote with your team to select the hostage's location amongst a couple options. In the House map, you have 4 defenders' objective locations : master bedroom, workshop, dining room and laundry room. On the Plane, you have 4 as well : meeting room, bedroom, journalist seating and cargo.  We are aware that the voice chat was not optimal for the Closed Alpha. Thank you for your feedback."
Rainbow6,32fk4p,Livinpink,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:56:55 2015 UTC,I know the vote system. I voted for the laundry spot and no one else voted but the hostage was still at the same position.

Rainbow6,32fj6y,PinguRambo,3,Mon Apr 13 11:33:29 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about sounding repetitive with yet another feedback review. We need as many as we can get if we want to shape the game to one we will love. The vast OVERWHELMING majority of feedback talks about the need to remove hit markers, make guns handle more realistically,  slow down movement speed and get rid of teammate xray outlines.  Doors also come up a lot as does being able to put any weapon on any loadout. There's other common points too, like removing movement exploits like strafe dance shooting and rapid drop shotting, etc.  The point is, we're all kind of saying the same thing, and that's good. Hopefully these changes will make it in game (most are actually easy tweaks or removals) Our collective voices can give us the amazing game we know this can be if the devs listen and implement. I hope that's the case bevause for some reason game development typically seems like one of the only buisnesses who don't lisyen to their customers,  at least not typically. Hope this time is different!"
Rainbow6,32fj6y,iceycat,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:00:53 2015 UTC,"This is exactly why I decided to put yet another one, thank you for the support! I just hope Ubi will listen :)  I haven't checked the forum in a week now, but I wonder if it's the same thing over there. Same thing with console gamers who are, generally, less active on forums.  My most important point was about stamina, I think it would fix a lot of things (movement + aiming stability + layout)."
Rainbow6,32fj6y,iceycat,2,Mon Apr 13 14:04:45 2015 UTC,"Ironically stamina was my only point of divergence with you. I'd rather see sprint removed entirely and just have fast walk/slow walk like older R6 games had. This game just moves too fast. That said I respect your opinion and rather see stamina sprint then having it left as it is (but I'd still like it gone entirely)  Also I'm a console gamer and try to be as active on here as possible. I want all the strenghts of PC style game on my console. I'm not a Halo kiddie. I've been playing R6 for about 12 years now. I prefer the comfort of gaming on my couch in front of a 60"" tv, plus all the people I would play with would be playing on console too. That said,  as console gamers we want nothing dumbed down or streamlined. We want a hardcore CQB simulator,  not ""Call of Battlefield Six"""
Rainbow6,32fj6y,iceycat,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:13:24 2015 UTC,"fast walk/slow walk like older R6 games had   Well I don't know what you are referring to by stamina then, because it was pretty much my idea:  - Want to move faster? Run but suffer the consequence while recovering   - Want a heavier loadout? Don't expect to run out and shoot everything.  Now you are speaking of it, maybe I mix-up Ghost recon and raven shield on this..."
Rainbow6,32fj6y,iamda5h,2,Mon Apr 13 14:23:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I was picturing some kind of depleting and regenerating little white stamina meter in the HUD when you described it. Maybe that's not what you meant. In older R6 games slow walk spread the crosshairs out a bit, fast walk spread them way out. The only way to ensure a rock steady shot with full accuracy was to either stop and fire or crouch or prone and fire. The movement animation for stance changes took a second or two so you couldn't do dumb stuff like drop shot. Also the cross hair change was based around movement accelration so when you stopped there was a second to wait while your cross hairs tightened back up again, it wasn't instantaneous."
Rainbow6,32fj6y,Livinpink,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:44:01 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I was picturing some kind of depleting and regenerating little white stamina meter in the HUD when you described it. Maybe that's not what you meant.   Not at all, I hate heavy loaded HUD in FPS, we are not playing mechas, it's actually really closer to what the original R6 proposed (and Ghost Recon for what it worth).  I want pretty much the same system as in the old ones, maybe with some tweaks to include the sprint but it sounds way more appealing to me."
Rainbow6,32fj6y,Livinpink,2,Mon Apr 13 14:46:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with almost everything you've mentioned, and I've experienced all of those bugs. I saw font issues throughout the settings. However, at this time I'm not really against the kill cams. It gives you a little insight into where the other team positions and what they're doing, which I found to be useful with large defensive advantage. I also found the lean toggled to be really useful, but maybe this could be an option in the setting, allowing everyone to set their preference.. Same goes for the quick action gear."
Rainbow6,32fj6y,Livinpink,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:53:37 2015 UTC,Hm I'm not really for the killcam as it gives too much information to the losing team.   For the toggle I agree it should be an option :)

Rainbow6,32c1nc,iceycat,6,Sun Apr 12 20:01:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for listening!  I typed this early this morning on my phone so it's a bit jumbled but I wanted to remember to touch on everything that was on my mind.  Mostly doors, better or more characters, the ability for more operatives to use more of the weapons and finally a bit more difficulty killing your enemies.  Health levels are fine.  Gunplay should take more skill though."
Rainbow6,32c1nc,TheLucarian,3,Sun Apr 12 20:19:23 2015 UTC,"The removal of hit markers and weapon balancing issues like recoil are all easy fixes. I would implore Ubi not to solve this problem simply be creating a hardcore mode as that would just fracture the matchmaking playlists, just remove the hit markers and balance the weapon handling for everyone.   The only change I really want that I fear is too major is the implementation of doors. In their FAQ they stated that doors create a problem with the barricade system and cause lag issues online. I think these are both very solvable problems if they really wanted to. The question is do they really want to? I worry they think that doors slow people down and cause them to play more cautiously and they would run out of time. They have already stated they feel the time on the round duration is right where it needs to be to strike a good balance for those playing, and those who have died and are waiting. I think THAT is the reason we don't have doors. You could make it so barricades would work on non door openings as is and would just become context sensitive to a door and reinforce it, essentially turning it into a barricade anyway. Non reinforced doors would still open/close normally. Or you could make it so at least the exterior doors had actual doors on them but leave the interiors just as open doorways (not as ideal, but better than nothing) Lag issues can totally be handled. If putting a half dozen doors in your map breaks the netcode to the point where lag is an issue, then you seriously need to optimize your code anyway. Also the time. We are not going to rage quit if we wait 5 minutes instead of 3. Or if time was removed completely. Especially if players are given an over watch role beyond monitoring cameras. Allow them to become a sniper maybe like the E3 demo had. Say it's a position the player can't  actually move from, only pan the scope around a limited field of view, if a lucky shot through a window presents itself they could still take it. No one would be bored waiting the extra two minutes to then.  Combine doors with slower movement speed, no hit markers and X-ray outlines, make guns feel correct, and make it so you can't exploit movement by strafe dance firing and drop shotting. Do THAT and this game will be FANTASTIC! This game has SO much potential! I can see the diamond it could become (provided PvE co-op and single player modes are also really good) so close guys, just bring it home for the win!"
Rainbow6,32c1nc,Pest_AWC,3,Sun Apr 12 20:22:03 2015 UTC,"I can only agree that every operator needs more weapons to chose from, it feels extremely limited and unnecessary so. Also, yes, no true rainbow feeling, they need to get back and read up on the lore or give us a very good explanation for those mixed uniforms and police backgrounds."
Rainbow6,32c1nc,CookieDoughCooter,2,Sun Apr 12 21:10:32 2015 UTC,"I agree completely with 11War on all points.  Of course, there are many more issues that need addressing but I'm not listing all those again.  There are plenty of threads out there already."
Rainbow6,32c1nc,JJRage,2,Mon Apr 13 01:45:56 2015 UTC,This is the best feedback I've seen yet. Forget the fact it's not a good R6 game - it's just solid feedback on making it a better game period.
Rainbow6,32c1nc,Pest_AWC,2,Mon Apr 13 04:26:49 2015 UTC,"Glad to see some more positive-sounding feedback. My short time looking at this sub today as been disheartening. Despite people claiming the game is doomed to fail (at least in the eyes of hardcore R6 fans), I truly believe that most of the flaws you describe can be addressed before release. There seem to be a lot of armchair developers here assuming that the product being shown is the product we're gonna get at retail. Player feedback is the reason these type of tests exist.   Whether or not that feedback is taken to heart, that's another story. But judging from the feedback I've read here, I'm not sure people are going to be happy regardless."
Rainbow6,32c1nc,JJRage,0,Sun Apr 12 18:45:10 2015 UTC,"You must not have been a part of many Alpha releases.  Once it hits Alpha after over 2 years being made, the core of the game is set in stone.  At most, we'll get some tweaks here and there and maybe some server side settings to turn off a few things."
Rainbow6,32c1nc,Pest_AWC,3,Mon Apr 13 01:44:42 2015 UTC,"I can assure you I've taken part in many alpha tests for all sorts of genres. Most of OP's feedback can be changed with tuning and balance, others with minor art changes.  Some of the other deeper mechanics, sure, those might not change. But that goes to my other point, that many of the game's harsher critics will not be satisfied regardless. I don't mean that as a slight, it's just a fact. Those old school R6 games served a very niche market, one Ubisoft may not be willing to cater to fully."
Rainbow6,32c1nc,JJRage,1 point,Mon Apr 13 02:47:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly how is it a NICHE MARKET when Ravenshield was a top seller of its time and beating out other AAA titles like BF and COD?  The first 3 R6 games cater to people that enjoy CQB combat with an amount of realism somewhere between COD and ARMA.  It isn't a NICHE, it is a complete community that numbered as high or higher than other AAA titles.  Most fans of R6 also equally enjoy other styles of games like COD and ARMA.  The thing is, when we want to play COD, we will play COD.  When we want to play more realistic where the unforgiving nature of R6 gave you a bigger high on a victory because it was well earned, then we played R6 (back then).  If you want to see a NICHE MARKET, how about Siege catering to the NICHE of COD fans that want to play a 5 VS 5 CQB with no respawns?  Now THAT is a NICHE MARKET.  Why does everyone find it OK that UBI keeps going in completely different directions with ever R6 release while other AAA titles keep their style of play and build on it?"

Also I'd love to see some sales numbers to backup these claims that it outsold other AAA games ""like BF and CoD"". BF 1942 came out around the same time, I find it hard to believe Raven Shield outsold it."

Rainbow6,32c25u,1Bravo,2,Sun Apr 12 16:07:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, large map variety will go a long way. We've seen the house at night during the rain in the E3 demo, and the house on a sunny day during alpha, I sincerely hope BOTH versions make it into final game. In fact having 10 maps with each map having a day/night option would make it feel like double the maps even though all that's technically changing is lighting conditions. Could make some good use for NVG gear or FLIR or something. Would also like to see some more dynamic things like the helo insertion via fast rope from the E3 demo as well as how wing was blowing things around and spotlights shining around house and through windows as they moved around.   100% agree on SLOWING this game down. Remove sprinting, just fast walking/slow walking. Make exploits like strafe dance shooting and drop shotting impossible as those should NOT be valid combat tactics. Remove hit markers, replace with audio indicators maybe (cry of pain?) Nerf heart beat sensor. And doors, om my gosh, DOORS! Not buying the Dev FAQ that said they caused lag issues, that's a solvable problem guys! At least have exterior doors to breach into a building if nothing else, I'd prefer interior room doors to, but you have to have SOME doors. Defenders can reinforce them, essentially locking them and making them have to be breached just like a barricade.  Also teams need to be wearing different color clothes to tell people apart and then get rid of that distracting goofy see through walls X-ray vision for teammates."

I agree, that this game is not without its flaws, and it does need some work. but at the same time, I feel this game isn't nearly as bad as this sub is portraying it to be, and it makes me wonder how many of them have actually played it.  to your points, I cant stress enough the need for variety and a solid selection of maps as well as a good amount of player/weapon customization. both these features/additions will be extremely key in the longevity and success of this game."

Rainbow6,32c31b,iceycat,10,Sun Apr 12 17:23:52 2015 UTC,"I 100% disagree with a system to buy new weapons. I think it's way too gimicky and really doesn't have a place in the game. However, your point about game speed, to me, is the most important point you brought up. Movement speed is way too fast. It makes for half of engagements to turn into who can strafe left to right and back faster and spray better. In my personal and in no way expert opinion, movement needs to be lowered significantly to a tactical walk pace. Sprint can remain but make it more of a jog/light run. To compensate, match times would need to be longer. On top of that, change some of the gun characteristics (more recoil and damage) and you've got yourselves a customer."
Rainbow6,32c31b,forzaitalia458,2,Sun Apr 12 16:51:12 2015 UTC,The buy system is just how I prefer it but nothing big that people should look into(added it in main post)   Good points about movement speed. I'd like that when aiming the movement speed should be extremely slow. Then you need to rely on Q-E instead of A-D.
Rainbow6,32bvln,Nyhlis,10,Sun Apr 12 13:19:40 2015 UTC,I don't like Operator vs operator either. Especially how it's FBI/GIGN/SAS vs FBI/SAS/GIGN. I mean like that would never happen... It's immersion breaking and a tad annoying.  Siege needs to be a Cops/robbers type of game because that's the only thing that makes sense. Or T and CT. You need to have clearly defined good and bad guys that look different.   my .02
Rainbow6,32bvln,Sterling__Archer_,9,Sun Apr 12 16:26:34 2015 UTC,I agree with you. The operator system prevents players from playing how they would like to. I was really hoping that there would be a lot of customisation in the game. I wanted to be able to customise my loadout and my player model. Customisation allows for much more tactical gameplay.
Rainbow6,32bvln,capedcrusader93,7,Sun Apr 12 16:02:58 2015 UTC,"I have to agree, it takes the choice away from the player. How is the player going to get better at any class if they only get the class a small percentage  of the time? Why not let the player choose what skills they like? I had no idea what made the classes they have now so different anyway.  Once they used all their gear they became the same as everyone else."
Rainbow6,32bvln,digita1hound,8,Sun Apr 12 16:43:37 2015 UTC,There should be 2 classes in the game. 1 for CT and 1 for T.  You can customize the looks and loadout on each character in the menu or in the waiting phase.
Rainbow6,32bvln,McKvack11,13,Sun Apr 12 17:35:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I hate the idea of classes in this game. Completely ruins tactical flexibility. I'd much rather have each player get a bunch of ""slots"" of equipment to fill for their avatar and each team can tailor their choices to their playstyle."
Rainbow6,32bvln,RC_5213,4,Sun Apr 12 15:08:54 2015 UTC,"We don't need classes at all.  I hate not being able to play exactly what I want.  It is especially hard on new players who want to take a certain load out multiple times in a row to learn it.  They've gone too far with this game trying to artificially force team play by limiting player choices.  If my team wants to take all snipers in a CQB map and get killed, then let us."
Rainbow6,32bvln,Pest_AWC,6,Mon Apr 13 01:56:50 2015 UTC,"I dont like it - I really liked the E3 models and would much rather have a Cops Vs Robbers type model. remember, Rainbow didnt create this CT Vs CT image, I know Medal of Honor Warfighter did the same thing and that worked for me, but this, for Rainbow doesn't really cut it for me"
Rainbow6,32bvln,TheJoker182,2,Sun Apr 12 13:26:13 2015 UTC,You do know that CT vs CT has been in the classic R6 games?

Rainbow6,32bvln,TheLucarian,2,Sun Apr 12 21:20:52 2015 UTC,"I think the reason behind operators is the same reason you pick heroes in a MOBA game. They even mentioned it in one of their behind the scenes videos. Is it unrealistic? yes, does it limit versatility? yep, but forces teamwork between teammates which i think is OK. A suggestion would be to make a library of 50 operators we could choose from. Or create an operator but be penalised due to customization? you should be able to pick up other players gear as well"
Rainbow6,32bvln,JIMMAAH,2,Mon Apr 13 00:30:00 2015 UTC,"I will stand by the operator system over having everyone being able to select what they want all the time. This means you have to use everyone to their full potential in the team play. If you're the guy the flashbangs, you should follow the guy with the hammer or the exotherm charges to add an extra advantage to breaching. On the otherside you have an entire team of reinforced barricades and they can almost completely solidify a room while the attacking team decided they want 5 guys with flashbangs, this is an extreme and unlikely situation, but being able to freely pick whatever kit you want creates an imbalance that really diminishes teamplay.  To draw comparison, look how Call of Duty allows everyone to build whatever they want. Everyone is a lone gun playing around solo strategies and the kit that works well with that. Siege in its current form encourages the team to stick together, and creates synergy between abilities and kits by giving certain people certain things.  Now, I would be all for customization of character models or selection of preferred CT unit etc."
Rainbow6,32bvln,guitars4zombies,2,Mon Apr 13 00:32:47 2015 UTC,"Start by ditching all of the sci-fi stuff immediately. When did every game need an EMP grenade? Ditch all law enforcement identities. Rainbow is not and has never been LE. It's a military unit. Move to a create-a-class system, but restrict certain pieces of equipment like ballistic shields. Focus gadgets on surveillance and tactical equipment like optical wands, silent wall drills, door wedges and the like. Lengthen the rounds to accommodate for this playstyle change.   The SWAT shooter series would be a great place to start on the equipment side, ironically. For me, half of a round would be about getting in position and getting eyes inside a room, and half about shooting."
Rainbow6,32bvln,DigTw0Grav3s,2,Mon Apr 13 04:09:55 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm really not a fan of the operator system whatsoever. I just want to be able to customise my loadout and the look of my character so that I can play exactly the way that I want to. The operator system highly limits tactical gameplay.  I also can't stand the CTU vs CTU thing that they have going on. It's completely immersion breaking for me. Is it that hard to have different player models for the Counter Terrorists and Terrorists?
Rainbow6,32bvln,Sweet_Blasphemy,3,Mon Apr 13 05:55:50 2015 UTC,"from what i saw in a lot of streams, i like the operatorsystem. i cant imagine its fun playing against a team with five riotshields, five zappdrones or worse five heartbeatsensors, even sniper and shotgun. the heartbeatsensor doesnt seen that bad if change a bit, because only one defender can us it an have to communicate what he sees.  it would break the game, everyone sitting in a corner and trying to zapp with the drone or running around and trying to ""noobtube-charge"" someone.  this is probably the only thing whats ""tactical"" right now. the team have to choose the right setup to work with each other even more when there are 10 operator on every side to choose from. when good balanced there is no rambo class, where one guy can emp, charge flash frag and shoot his assault rifle at the same time."
Rainbow6,32bvln,jim_cool,2,Sun Apr 12 18:21:45 2015 UTC,"That's what I was thinking too. I mean it sucks when someone snaps up your favorite class, but from a balance perspective I think it works."
Rainbow6,32bvln,Brunttus,1 point,Mon Apr 13 00:50:08 2015 UTC,"It's there to limit the versatility of each individual (no 5-person hammer team) and encourage teamwork, but the problem I've found is that it's incredibly punishing when the only person capable of holding the flashbangs dies right away. You completely lose out on the utility of that kit and there's no way to pick up their gear."
Rainbow6,32bvln,nomoneypenny,1 point,Sun Apr 12 22:36:05 2015 UTC,I think having the classes balance the special abilities and promotes you to work together more to coordinate. 5 hammers or 5 heartbeat sensors wouldnt be good. I just dont like being locked with what gun I choose

They are the only games I find myself going back to play. The tactical elements are what make this game amazing. I am just hoping they incorporate Terrorist Hunt into Siege because that was one of the greatest things to just play with a group of friends. I liked the alpha and hope they make some slight modifications to running speed, hit damage, and a few other minor things but overall I'm looking forward to giving Ubisoft my money on this one! My only request is not to get screwed over by DLC. Too many companies taking advantage of this practice"
Rainbow6,32ecr5,staindrego,0,Mon Apr 13 15:11:32 2015 UTC,"deal with it?  It's their game to make, not yours to demand.  If you don't like it, don't play it.  I love the game, I've played R6 in the past, I've played Counter-strike for most of my life, and I can say the game is fun, refreshing, and melds both together quite nicely.  I have asked every single game I play, for the past 50 games I have played, all 5 players on my team, and I have only got one person who says they did not like it.  Everyone else has said how fun and refreshing it is.   You might not like it, but you are a minority.  Hell this subreddit is a minority of the actual whole, being built only on those who have complaints (otherwise you would be in the game playing).  So, if you're going to be so closed minded, so reddit army mentality, that's cool, but don't expect a response from R6, and I honestly am happy that they won't take what you say into consideration."
Rainbow6,32ecr5,jwong63,3,Mon Apr 13 02:41:46 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I find it very hard to believe that you have asked and got a response from all 200 people you say you have because:  a) mics rarely work; & b) the majority of people who are using a mic hardly talk anyway.  But otoh I can also say stuff, like every single person I have played the alpha with over 20hrs or so have said they despise the game and that's coming from people who are R6 vets and want a slow, methodical and tactical shooter which is quite prevalent by the amount of people posting negatives compared to positives for the game.     Secondly, people are free to constructively criticise the game if they like and your ignorance and disrespect is doing you no favours with comments like....   and I honestly am happy that they won't take what you say into consideration."

Rainbow6,32dfkx,Riddick51PB,1 point,Sun Apr 12 23:14:15 2015 UTC,Well I just hate how fast paced the game is right now. The old rainbow six games were a lot slower paced and you could think about what you were doing. Now it's just ohh snap time is running out we gotta run in and mow everybody down. Nobody even goes for the hostage because you might as well just kill other players since time is so short
Rainbow6,32dfkx,Riddick51PB,1 point,Mon Apr 13 01:41:16 2015 UTC,"i think i have to agree with you on the hostage.  further, i think R6 should require the hostage to be rescued to the safe zone within the alotted time.  even if they have to increase the round timer."
Rainbow6,32dfkx,DuckterQuackWebMD,1 point,Mon Apr 13 01:45:15 2015 UTC,Well from what I've seen is the game just turns into a camp fest since it's a 3 minute timer you know? Also the heartbeat sensor has to go. That is such an unrealistic piece of trash gadget. I think it should be replaced with sensors that can be placed on walls so if people move past them there is an alarm and you can pull up a map of where it was tripped. However that's probably not going to be implemented since the game is so close to launch. But having real time monitoring of players positions is such a racket lol. If they keep heartbeat sensors in the game I think you should be able to emp and either disable it for the rest of the round or a at least a good 2 mins or something. Because that gadget was so overpowered on plane where you have like a north and south entrance it's too easy to anticipate the attackers entrance. I think you should be able to have an operator setup a jammer of their own that can counter the enemies gadgets while it's either up or for a good amount of time. There are a lot of ways the game could be balanced out. Or maybe if we are lucky way better operators will be released and nobody will even use pulse lol. That would be the dream :)

Rainbow6,32box1,Jonesy777,5,Sun Apr 12 18:00:32 2015 UTC,"Well slapping Tom Clancy's name on it should at least give us some type of realism but here in Siege we get zilch, this is even worse than the Vegas games and that's saying something.  And maybe not for you but realistic games can certainly be fun, I've had some of my most enjoyable gaming experiences playing realistic and simulation shooters."
Rainbow6,32box1,Jumbify,-5,Sun Apr 12 15:15:12 2015 UTC,"That is certainly a very niche thing to enjoy ""realism"" (aka more tedious, involved experience). There is a reason the ""normal"" arma game modes are barely played compared to stuff like Atlis Life."

Casual players will be much more likely to stick with the trusted games known and enjoyed by them.  Games that evolved over time but kept the core game style intact, like COD and BF.  UBI has proven in every game since Lockdown that it will abandon any fans and slap the R6 name on anything FPS (or Third Person Shooter) related.  If Siege does get fans, they will be left in the dust for the next R6 game.  Since we've already lost working doors, we'll probably lose bullets soon."
Rainbow6,32bvwh,CapControl,2,Mon Apr 13 02:22:51 2015 UTC,"I played the alpha for about 5 hours now. The basics of the game are going to stay, and the basics..are directed towards mainstream and casual crowd.   Sadly, I hear a lot of positive feedback from the mainstream crowd. And only negative from the fans, so we are outnumbered. I don't think this game is going anywhere. I've seen it all in the alpha.   I'm not going to sum up whats bad about the game so far, that's been done enough. I just know I'm not looking forward to the game anymore."
Rainbow6,32bvwh,RealityKing4Hire,0,Sun Apr 12 15:27:25 2015 UTC,There were no hitmarkers or player outlines in the E3 hype video so I don't understand why they would make such drastic changes. What we saw at E3 looked amazing other than the shitty recoil which they said was just a temporary thing.
Rainbow6,32bvwh,trineroks,1 point,Sun Apr 12 16:51:16 2015 UTC,"There were hitmarkers in the E3 reveal.   To be fair, a lot of the core mechanics from the E3 reveal carried over to the Alpha product (sprinting, fast snap to ADS, naturally wide hitmarker that forces you to ADS when shooting at enemies, no recoil, fast strafing, revives, objective marker, etc). The only reason why it looked slow paced and tactical was because it was essentially a vertical slice. A lot of the core gameplay since the reveal had potential to become run and gun.   There were some things in the reveal that I WISH stayed, though:   Overall slower forward movement. This should've been the walking speed, with current Alpha's normal speed being the normal speed.  Weapons would collide with the wall and be lowered if the player got too close to it No teammate silhouette"

Rainbow6,32blnj,ItzWolfeh,4,Sun Apr 12 11:08:38 2015 UTC,"that's a definite improvement over the way it currently plays out i.e. TDM with a person sitting in the middle of the firefight.  I've though another interesting idea might be reverse the roles. Have the team inside the building/house/plane have to escort the hostage to a safe zone, and have the team outside try stop them and intercept the hostage (different to say RvS's pilot mode where you just shot the guy). Would mean both teams are actually invested in the objective and the wellbeing of the group, you can't just spray the walls if you might hit the moving hostage, and it would avoid just TDM style shootouts."
Rainbow6,32blnj,greylong,1 point,Sun Apr 12 14:34:37 2015 UTC,interesting
Rainbow6,32blnj,th_pion,1 point,Sun Apr 12 11:00:39 2015 UTC,"Like the idea, except that defending players shouldn't win the game for killing the hostage even when it is trying to move out: They should just have to ""intimidate it"" in order to make it go back where it came from again or move it to another room. Once this has happened it can't happen again during the round, so attackers have one shot at it, and defenders one shot at intimidatign back the hostage.   Also, when hostage is directed to move out by attackers it should do so slowly. Best would be if a dead attacker gets the role of ""hostage guider"" - he/she makes up a plan in another map view, then tells a team mate to go within range of the hostage to tell the hostage to follow the route he/he set, where the guide would have mapped out certain points for the hostage i.e. step 1 -go there, step 2 go there et.c. That same path can be communicated to rest of attackers to insure the extraction."
Rainbow6,32blnj,collectivebliss,1 point,Sun Apr 12 12:34:17 2015 UTC,"Your last idea is great, but your first is not.. Then the defenders can just tell him to stay the second the attackers tell him to run, and nothing will happen. I would like it to be so the attackers can make the hostage run to them, so they can pick her/him up as they normally do."
Rainbow6,32blnj,EDstah,1 point,Sun Apr 12 12:42:34 2015 UTC,"Overall I like the idea, but personally I like Collective's first idea better. I get your point that if it becomes a ""COME"", ""no STAY"" scenario it would pretty much defeat the purpose. However from what Ive seen people aren't baby sitting the hostage, they are mostly reacting to what the rescuers are doing.  If this was implemented as a sneak rescue it could add more tactics because someone would have to keep a close eye on the hostage and if he does have to stop to re-secure the hostage that leaves the defenders a bit more vulnerable.  I feel it's kinda cheap to just get close enough and basically have the hostage rescue themselves. Also, IMO there should never be a scenario where a team wins by killing the hostage."
Rainbow6,32blnj,Gamers_Alibi,1 point,Sun Apr 12 14:32:23 2015 UTC,I can see that working in the house map in the bedroom while everyone else is distracted you can rappel down tell the hostage to come and escort him/her out
Rainbow6,32crz7,CSKarasu,2,Sun Apr 12 18:24:54 2015 UTC,"Exactly what i was thinking pretty much.

I hope they learn from them."
Rainbow6,32crz7,Andreicv,0,Sun Apr 12 18:35:08 2015 UTC,in reference to point one. I would like a normal mode with no hitmarkers and a baby casual mode that has hitmarkers for the cod players

Rainbow6,32c1vk,Jonesy777,2,Sun Apr 12 14:46:52 2015 UTC,"aye point taken :) I think a big issue is that people are playing it like CoD, If you had a good team with good communication I think it could be a completley different game but unfortunatley 9/10 people wont play it that way."
Rainbow6,32c1vk,Jonesy777,2,Sun Apr 12 23:07:20 2015 UTC,"The problem is that it actually gives people the option to play that way and in some instances forces them to play like that due to the extremely short round times and the effectiveness of strafing and just unloading rounds at will.  It is possible to play tactically but at the same time if you play it slow and methodically the enemy could just as easily pull out the heartbeat sensor and spray a whole clip through that wall and take out a couple of players easily.  The premise of the game is right but the gadgets, style and implementation are way off and ruin it for me, personally."

Rainbow6,32cjvu,KingBarracuda,2,Sun Apr 12 18:40:43 2015 UTC,I could care less if in multiplayer matches one team looks like a terrorist group.  What I want is for the teams to look radically different from each other so we don't need magical outlines to tell who is on our team.  Ravenshield usually had one team in something like a solid blue while the other team had tan with camo patterns.  It was easy to tell them apart.  On snow maps one team had solid white and the other had white with camo patterns.

Rainbow6,32aocn,gsr1550,7,Sun Apr 12 03:10:15 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed the very first couple hours after the alpha started, because everyone was new to the game and on equal footing.  As soon as people got used to the game though, the game had such an unrealistic style and feeling of being forced to do things that it did get boring and start to feel like a COD expansion pack that reduced COD to 5 VS 5 with CQB maps to appeal to a niche of COD players.  I don't like losing a round because someone spammed a wall until they got an X and then could finish me off.  I don't like being forced to play a particular class because the class I've wanted to work on was taken.  I don't like the short rounds forcing teams to do stupid run n gun as the timer gets close to expiring.  I've enjoyed COD and BF games as well as R6, and I just think it would be pretty rare for me to want to play this niche of a COD game instead of COD.  As far as R6, it is nothing like it, so it doesn't fill my need to play a semi-realistic shooter at all.  For those that really enjoy Siege enough to not only play it a lot but promote it to their friends, don't get used to UBI coming out with a game you enjoy.  They've proven the next R6 will be a completely different experience again.  They haven't listened to what fans want in 10 years."

Rainbow6,32aocn,Deagletime,2,Sun Apr 12 05:11:27 2015 UTC,"It isn't a bad game for the type of game it actually is, it's pretty enjoyable. It just doesn't match the description of what we were told we were getting so people went in with high hopes and expectations and we were left disappointed."
Rainbow6,32aocn,Jonesy777,2,Sun Apr 12 03:03:23 2015 UTC,"Even if it's not the game we want, it is not enjoyable in its current state. After 3 rounds I usually have no reason to waste my time anmore with this game. I know many things are alpha problems but you can see where this game is going."
Rainbow6,32aocn,BattlefieldBro,3,Sun Apr 12 04:02:08 2015 UTC,"I agree but played in very short bursts I did have some fun while playing although most of the time I just felt frustrated and I also agree on the direction of the game which is why I said it's not what we were told we were getting.  Let's face it, unless you've never experienced the older R6 games or prefer a fast paced CQC shooter you probably have no idea what you're missing considering a lot of the people I've seen enjoy this game have admitted to not playing anything before the Vegas games.  A couple of standout frustrations for me are:   We now have defenders who think it's a great idea to take out half of your team within 5 secs as they run to the house/plane because they've camped themselves somewhere extremely unexpected and knocked a hole in a random wall; & the hostage is a complete afterthought in this game as it's basically a 5v5 TDM. I could count the number of times on one hand of occasions the hostage has actually been rescued."
Rainbow6,32aocn,Jonesy777,1 point,Sun Apr 12 04:23:20 2015 UTC,"Its got great potential...

Matchmaking with random assholes and friendly fire = too many team kills and no tactics we need our own servers for siege to properly work.These randoms just leave after they die 5v5 turns into 5v4 and so on,overlooking everything else matchmaking will more likely kill the game"

Rainbow6,32aocn,aceattorneymvp,-2,Sun Apr 12 07:04:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the game is great so far, other than minor annoyances... which is pretty standard for an alpha (lack of party system, voice chat always on.)  I don't see why people are hating on it for being ""too CoD"" because while it has some similarities (lack of recoil), the differences kind of... make it a different experience. The most striking is the emphasis on teamwork and communication; if you don't stick together, and you're not on voice chat, you're going to have a bad time. Running and gunning on your own like you would in CoD will just get you killed.  I'd be happy if they took out hitmarkers though."
Rainbow6,32aocn,Ra-the-Sun-God,5,Sun Apr 12 03:06:24 2015 UTC,"And that is why running and gunning works right now, right?  The amount of coordination in this game boils down to:  People sprinting off in different directions  Full auto spray gunfire everywhere  ""Dude there's a guy with a shield on the stairs""  More full auto spray gunfire, strafe dueling, and even dropshotting going on.  ""Can someone revive me""  Some dude sprints to your X-ray silhouette and picks you up  More full auto spray gunfire, strafe dueling, and explosions. Some dude chortles into the mic because he sprinted outside the house and sprayed 2 entry team members rappelling down the side of the wall  The level of communication needed to be successful in this game compared to say the old Rainbow Six games, SWAT 4, Due Process, Project Reality, etc is so ridiculously minimal. If you come from a background like Battlefield, Call of Duty, or similar shooters then yeah, there is slightly more communication going on here than in those games. In the end, the game design and the numerous crutches Siege offers make coordination and most communication redundant and optional."
Rainbow6,32aocn,trineroks,2,Sun Apr 12 03:31:20 2015 UTC,"Running and gunning has not worked for me. If I try that, I run up near a well-covered enemy who proceeds to kill me almost instantly. Certainly no dropshotting. Maybe I'm just bad?  Yeah, you can certainly do well without a huge amount of coordination... but really only if the other team is also not coordinated well. The match I played about an hour ago was pretty great, in my opinion -- both teams had strong teamwork, but we won in the end. This was partly because of a great round we had while attacking - after killing a couple of their team defending from outside the room the hostage was in, we breached in from two different points, threw a flashbang in and quickly killed the rest of the enemies.  I'm not a stranger to older (and current) tactical games. I'm more a fan of SWAT 4 (and 3 before that, lol) and Project Reality (and Insurgency, if that counts). I'm loving Siege for basically the same reasons as the others. I guess people are just going to have different opinions? I'm seeing that opinions are polarized. Guess I'm on the unpopular side this time.  There's a smaller requirement for good communication compared to those games, though. Public games are probably going to have even less. I'll personally just play with my usual group of friends (that is, once parties work...)  Thanks for reading my minor wall of text."
Rainbow6,32aocn,Ra-the-Sun-God,-1,Sun Apr 12 04:00:57 2015 UTC,"Did you only play one round or something? Iv'e been on plenty of teams that were communicating well and moving together. If you don't do that you will die, the game punishes running around."
Rainbow6,32aocn,bandit145,0,Sun Apr 12 03:34:15 2015 UTC,"Nah, man. You're not the only one.  The main complaint I see people making is it's a video game. Because of this people tend to do ""unrealistic"" things such as spraying at high traffic areas, camping random doorways or throwing an explosive on a wall for someone to walk by. Also it being ""too fast paced"" without understanding this is a multiplayer shooter. No one wants to sit inside of a planning phase for 20minutes because one player wants to meticulously plan an assault for something that'l end in <5 minutes or negotiate release of hostages.  TL:DR Its multiplayer element is too much for certain people who think the same rules of old singleplayer games would be exactly the same in this situation. Also, as for reference I have played the original titles, I just don't expect diamonds from a company known for mediocre titles.  Edit:I will agree however that shit like the guns being floaty and hitmarkers should go, I'm fine with spraying through walls but the game letting you know when you're hitting someone is just bullshit."

Rainbow6,32aocn,bandit145,3,Sun Apr 12 02:56:58 2015 UTC,can you move the hostage? you could in the E3 trailer.
Rainbow6,32aocn,ZEPPIX,-5,Sun Apr 12 03:17:36 2015 UTC,"The major game play aspects have not changed, sorry to say but moving the hostage is a very minor thing and probably didn't work very well in their internal testing."

Rainbow6,32aocn,BattlefieldBro,-1,Sun Apr 12 04:01:04 2015 UTC,"Alright, lets go through this and take a look at why they removed both the sniper and the hostage moving for the defenders.  Sniper - The sniper re-spawn point was probably removed because of how blatantly over powered it was, you kill someone, they re-spawn and start sniping your team out. Sound fun?  Defenders moving hostage - This was probably removed because it was too easy to use the hostage as a meat shield and make it near impossible for the attackers to breach without killing him.   The core gameplay is the exact same as was shown on the E3 trailer. Edit: Grammar"
Rainbow6,32aocn,bandit145,1 point,Sun Apr 12 04:17:30 2015 UTC,I agree about the core gameplay. Minus redicoulus gadgets like heartbeat sensors. But the pacing and the movement is not the same. Nobody thinks about his actions because its easier to strife around while shooting at a wall. You'll never see gameplay like the E3 presentations with these mechanics.
Rainbow6,32aocn,BattlefieldBro,0,Sun Apr 12 12:26:50 2015 UTC,"You are right, the core gameplay hasn't changed that much from the E3 trailer and I've been one of the few who have been critical of the game since its reveal (when you showcase fast snap to ADS, almost no recoil, sprinting, hitmarkers, revives, fast strafing with no accuracy penalty when ADS, and the like, you should know how regular players would exploit those mechanics). I've been worried since the beginning. The only reason why that reveal looked slow paced and tactical was because it was a choreographed vertical slice.  That being said however, notice how in the E3 Reveal:   Movement overall was slower No teammate silhouettes Weapon length mattered, as you can see at one point when the player walked too close to the wall the weapon went down The hostage could be moved and used as a dynamic human shield The Call of Duty instakill knife mechanic either wasn't there or was just not shown   But other than these differences, yes - most of the core gameplay seems to not have changed since the reveal. And this is still a huge problem."
Rainbow6,32aocn,trineroks,1 point,Sun Apr 12 04:51:21 2015 UTC,"First off, don't confuse tactical with realism, a game can be tactical and not realistic. It was pretty clear from the E3 trailer that it was going to be a Rainbow Six spin off game and if you don't like it then don't play it.  All the minor things you mention are just number tweaks and they do not make or break a game for most people (I would buy it either way). I explained why the movable hostage is a terrible idea it would make things super frustrating for the attackers.  I have never seen anyone knife someone in Siege, you simply can't get close enough to use it."
Rainbow6,32aocn,bandit145,1 point,Sun Apr 12 05:35:00 2015 UTC,"First of all, please acquaint yourself with the genre of tactical shooter:   A tactical shooter is a subgenre of shooter game that includes both first-person shooters and third-person shooters. These games typically simulate realistic combat, thus making tactics and caution more important than quick reflexes in other action games.   You know what else could be considered ""tactical""? Team Fortress 2. You will get seriously wrecked by an organized team. Is it a tactical shooter? No.  Do you even realize that the original Rainbow Six series straddled simulation territory to provide an extremely realistic experience? Did you know Rainbow Six used to be rooted in intense realism that promoted realistic tactical play? Did you know Ubisoft specifically promised a return to the roots?   I have never seen anyone knife someone in Siege.   You obviously have not played it enough and haven't seen the Ubisoft dev stream, which showcases this."
Rainbow6,32aocn,trineroks,-1,Sun Apr 12 05:54:40 2015 UTC,"""realistic combat"" so you think CSGO is realistic then?   You obviously have not played it enough    After 6 hours I can tell you I have seen zero knife kills nor have I been close enough or in a situation to use knives.  Ubisoft did say that they would return to the roots but that still doesn't make this a bad game or a bad entry to the series. If you don't like it go play Insurgency."
Rainbow6,32aocn,bandit145,2,Sun Apr 12 06:05:34 2015 UTC,"Wait.  You think CS GO is a tactical shooter.  This is hilarious.  If you don't like a realistic true to the roots Rainbow Six, go play Battlefield Hardline. And Counter Strike at this point seems a lot more realistic than what Siege is offering."
Rainbow6,32aocn,trineroks,1 point,Sun Apr 12 06:09:11 2015 UTC,"No thanks, I prefer Arma, Insurgency, SWAT 4, Red Orchestra 2, and CSGO.  Also the CSGO wikipedia entry says ""Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is an online tactical first-person shooter ""  On top of that the Dictionary definition of tactical is "" relating to, or constituting actions carefully planned to gain a specific military end""  Realistic means ""representing familiar things in a way that is accurate or true to life.""  Edit: As you can see tactical and realistic are completely different things. If you can't see that I pity you.  Edit 2: The downvote button is not a disagree button, apparently no one here understands this."
Rainbow6,32aocn,bandit145,2,Sun Apr 12 06:23:10 2015 UTC,"Please do not believe everything wikipedia says. As seen on the steam CS:GO store page:  ""Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) will expand upon the team-based action gameplay that it pioneered when it was launched 14 years ago.""  CS:GO is not a tactical shooter, but a team-based action shooter. In any case that is what its own dev claims."

I came from playing RVS, and rouge spear, I never find Vegas to be good, MP nor SP, and I never understand why people thinks Patriots might be good(seriously? what they show with that stupid E3 video is a sick joke), having see what they have so far makes me happy that they did not go to the same error of Vagas(or even Patriots, but who knows?)  With that said, there is problems that makes it not RVS/RS good, mainly the gun mechanic, the loadout planning and the scale of operation."

Rainbow6,327yee,Brethon,7,Sat Apr 11 19:07:30 2015 UTC,"Honestly I was hesitant in watching this. When I hear strong language angry rant I think nothing good is going to come of it. I still could leave the language behind, but your points all are spot on. I'm passionate about this game too. I want so bad for that ""thinking man's tactical shooter"" to return. As a console player I'm so tired of being force fed dumbed down garbage because all developers seem to think console games need to be easier (they don't) and simplified (also NOT) and that only PC games need to have depth and realism (also, very, very not true). This game IS too fast in movement. Strafe dancing and drop shotting shouldn't even be possible and yet they have become modern FPS staples. Who really wants that crap? Will the as yet to be revealed snipers be able to quick scope as well? Probably. Sprinting also has no place in this game. I'm sure all this fast movement is in here to 1.) appeal to CoD style game play and 2.) make it so players can move fast enough to conclude the round by the end of the 3:00 timer. Of course that exists because they think we don't have sufficient attention spans to wait more than 120 seconds to get back in the game or else they think we'd rage quit or something. At least gives us 5:00, or no timer at all or something, then could slow down movement speed to appropriate levels and this game would be about tactics and communication instead of lone wolfing, strafe dancing and spray and pray. And hit markers just need to go away. Not just disable in your options, what good is it to turn them off for you, it's people using them AGAINST you that is the problem. A hardcore mode isn't the solution to these problems either as you'll fragment the playlists. Just make the game right in the first place. There are lots of other issues too.... Cough, DOORS, cough. But I digress."

Rainbow6,327yee,asdfpanda,2,Sat Apr 11 14:54:15 2015 UTC,"You do provide an interesting perspective on hip firing, or point shooting. However, cof is present in games as a mechanic to encourage burst firing instead of full auto.  Subbed though."
Rainbow6,327yee,anonimousplayer,3,Sat Apr 11 16:29:27 2015 UTC,"Some games actually do this right, but most games don't allow the crosshairs to close back up quickly enough after a small burst to be viable to use vs. simply aiming down sights.  As I mentioned in the video, Arma 3 does this near perfectly, as well as an indie game called Interstellar Marines and Insurgency. Instead of having artificial spread, the bullets actually generate from the barrel. So when your walking around, the muzzle naturally moves as well, altering the rounds trajectory.  So the spread pattern you see on the wall is literally where the muzzle was pointed the moment the round exited the barrel, just like in real life. This also makes semi-automatic fire, the more effective and efficient option; shot placement actually matters."
Rainbow6,327yee,GHOST-117,2,Sat Apr 11 21:58:12 2015 UTC,What is even the point of using the hostage as a shield (If they are going to add it).  They can just shoot you and revive the hostage...
Rainbow6,327yee,CornerMirror,3,Sat Apr 11 16:32:25 2015 UTC,That brings up the other issue I didn't mention in the video. Reviving. Gimping isn't a thing either. I wish it went more the route of SWAT 4 with it's health/wound system.

Rainbow6,327yee,CookieDoughCooter,2,Sat Apr 11 19:56:55 2015 UTC,"I agree with pretty much everything you said. I do think Siege has qualities however and the issues we all have with it are all easy fixes (except for doors maybe, which would prob require a more intensive rework). So, maybe there's still a little hope to be had. One thing that does not sit well with me at all is the fact that Ubi had no shame about pulling the same shit twice, even after all the backlash behind watchdogs' E3 trailer. So, hear all the complaints and do it all over again? That's hard to swallow.   One thing though: you should not have mentionned wanting to punch a dev in the face in a video that you're linking there for them to see. I know you're just talking but how are they supposed to feel about that? Best thing would be to edit that out, in my opinion. Cheers."
Rainbow6,327yee,BattlefieldBro,2,Sat Apr 11 23:21:19 2015 UTC,"Well I specifically said slap, not punch. To me that's less hostile and more along the lines of the comical slap to straighten somebody out; specifically the person in charge of the design decisions. However, being mixed in with the rant could give a more aggressive impression. Unfortunately at this point it's to late to edit out."

Rainbow6,327yee,longttran,2,Sat Apr 11 23:42:23 2015 UTC,"Let's all put on our thinking caps.   Many of these decisions were done to simplify the game and make it more accessible to the general shooter fan. That's obviously not what we want, but I think everyone here is smart enough to realize that we're a niche audience.   This game is going to be a slower paced version of S&D in CoD. I can see the setting up of barricades getting repetitive, the waiting for terrorists to come being tedious, etc. I like to think some changes have been made because of that. I see the novelty wearing off very quickly. For instance, the guy in the video said there shouldn't be outlines in a tactical shooter because you should be using teamwork... But we all know most people just pub it up.   What I really don't get is why the E3 demo was so different. Presumably it was done solely to drum up hype, which I understand - but it's backfiring because the game is totally different.   Splinter Cell is the next series to become butchered. Blacklist sold poorly, likely because the multiplayer was so hardcore. I imagine SvM will be very far from its roots, with Classic mode totally neglected and imbalanced."

Responsive shooting. You mean recoil, ballistics, or something? A vague term is a vague term. Overall, weapon feedback, yes, is a detrimental part to one's enjoyment running around, gunning, making tactical decisions, etc. Mouse controls - easily fixable. Perhaps horizontal and vertical axis scrolls are too sensitive.   I think the biggest issue is fast-paced mechanics. Strafing, etc. It's an issue in the philosophy in the gameplay and can be fixed easily, if needed.  Let's expect things like lack movement inertia, etc. will be addressed in time. The sooner, the better.  UI elements like ""location indicator (garage, exterior, etc.)"", heartbeat sensor, white-wrapped teammates visible through the walls, etc. are for some other audience, not R6's.  Finally, yes - sprinting must be removed. Slow-pace, in fact, creates tension much better than fast-pace."

I hope you didn't learn this in school. Business 101 says you project sales before the product/service is in development. It's backwards to worry about sales after you've already spent money developing, because if you find out you can't possibly make your money back than you're screwed. Sales projections are part of your business plan. Each game is a new product you need a plan for.    their priority should be to satisfy as many potential costumers as they can   This is kind of contradictory. Your potential customers are the same people that will be generating your sales, but you said they shouldn't worry about sales. No one is going to worry about a person who will not potentially buy their product, they are not customers. So in worrying about customers you are worrying about sales.  Here's some reading. http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/77674 https://www.sba.gov/blogs/4-practical-ways-forecast-new-product  You also have to give a large company reason to care about their customers. If people continue to purchase their broken games, DLC, uninspired releases, than why should they change? If selling a dream makes them rich why change?

Rainbow6,32adwl,CyberCam,2,Sun Apr 12 17:01:55 2015 UTC,"Agree with everything stated.   The more the game playes like a non-tactical shooter (CoD, BF et.c.) the less likely it is it will get a following or succeed in the longer run.   Personally I'm hoping for it to become a hardcore/""realistic"" FPS akin to ""Insurgecy"". As the author puts it, there isn't a single modern nice looking take on the tactical shooter currently.  This could become it. Or it can be just another game aiming for the masses."
Rainbow6,32awvy,Electrospeed_X,4,Sun Apr 12 04:14:21 2015 UTC,"You know it's nasty irony when Counter Strike is considered more realistic than Rainbow Six nowadays. But I really do believe that at this point even Counter Strike seems more realistic than Siege.  I really love the economy system in CS, because it really pressures you to stay alive (lest you have to rebuy your gear for the next round) and has you communicating with your team on what you'll be carrying for the next round.   I too am not a big fan of player classes - especially in a game that's supposed to be a realistic tactical shooter - that have different abilities, have ridiculous names (Thatcher, Twitch, Sledge), and look so different from eachother that you'd think you're in a ragtag mercenaries group.  I think all players (at least for the entry team) must have the same uniform and equipment, with limited pieces of certain other equipment (like riot shield, wall/floor charges, etc) so that players would have to deliberate among one another on who should take them."
Rainbow6,32awvy,trineroks,0,Sun Apr 12 04:44:59 2015 UTC,"So.... the gun play in CS is realistic? The game is realistic? I believe in another thread I pointed out that CS is a tactical shooter not a realistic shooter. Insurgency is a pretty good realistic shooter, CS is not.  Also, all the operators are decked out in their special force's gear, they hardly look rag tag. Maybe like... I don't know.... A multinational task force?"
Rainbow6,32awvy,bandit145,1 point,Sun Apr 12 11:06:03 2015 UTC,"Did I ever say Counter Strike is realistic? I said Counter Strike seems more realistic than Siege does.  Gunplay? You don't see any strafe dancing in Counter Strike. Accuracy is so heavily penalized when strafing or on the move in CS that you pretty much always see players standing still or crouching when taking shots.  Lack of unrealistic laser-accurate ADS and punishing recoil makes it so that players are forced to take shorter shots (usually semi-auto or small burst shots) against enemies.  No teammate X-ray silhouettes, no hitmarkers, no infinite revives, no white arrow pointing to enemies who can see you, nothing screaming ""HOSTAGE FOUND"" when CTs get to the hostages, no on-death killcam, standardized outfits, etc. Yes, it feels a lot more realistic than Siege does.  As for the uniforms, you obviously don't know much about Rainbow. Rainbow is a blacker than black counter terror group that recruits from various nations' special forces. When they conduct an op they disguise themselves using local police uniforms. Which, last time I checked, is standardized.  This is not some weird joint op between GIGN/FBI/SAS, and EVEN within these groups, the gear is standardized. But when you've got a team that consists of:   A chick with sunglasses and an FBI cap A dude with heavy armor with the GIGN's helmet/face shield A dude wearing a standard helmet, goggles, a balaclava, and rolled up sleeves A dude without a helmet wearing a gas mask A dude wearing a different gas mask with white tape across the front   And so on and so forth, it hardly gives the impression of the team being ""organized"". Seems more like:  ""We'll just pick this one FBI officer, this one GIGN officer, this SAS operator, this Spetsnaz operator, and this GSG-9 officer and throw them in this house/plane.""  But I really wouldn't mind sacrificing this element of immersion if the rest of the game didn't feel and play so arcade-y."

Rainbow6,328hcw,puddpuddpudd,13,Sat Apr 11 15:00:58 2015 UTC,"There were some elements from the original E3 trailer that made the game look promising but were completely taken out. Like the sniper positions when you died. Obviously the video was staged to make it look more tactical than it really was but that's the biggest problem. They just did a 180 themselves and said fuck you to all the tactical fans and just made another generic shooter.   The thing is, they can actually encourage tactical behavior naturally by implementing the right mechanics, for example; high recoil, no sprinting, limited ammo. Pretty much everything that was in an classic Rainbow game.   This game IS NOT Rainbow, it's taken everything from a modern, generic FPS and slapped Rainbow onto the box. Veterans of the old games won't buy this. Black Ops 3 was announced this week and honestly, that will kill this game. There's nothing unique about this game at all. The mechanics are simple, dull and require no skill cap. Go play Ravenshield and tell me how long it takes you to learn how to shoot because you actually can't spray in that game, at all. There's not even shooting options in this game. I can't burst fire, I can only spray.   Ubisoft have a hell of a decision to make for this game if they want it to be even the slightest bit successful because in it's current state, and I bet a lot of other people are going to do this, will tell their friends NOT to buy this game. Hell, look at the majority of this forum. I've never seen a new AAA title get so much backlash from the community in its ALPHA state. Makes me wonder what Patriots was like before they scrapped it because I bet it was better than Siege."
Rainbow6,328hcw,Gookywun,1 point,Sat Apr 11 17:23:43 2015 UTC,First point wrong it wasn't a sniper when you died he was one of the five sitting at the back. Probably still not present but anyway. Secondly tactical shooters in the sense you're talking about exist and are niche. This is more along the lines of Csgo and Vegas than raven shield because no one but us wanted a mother raven shield but plenty of people want a competitive shooter like csgo which this hits exceptionally well.
Rainbow6,328hcw,lightmight,4,Sat Apr 11 17:28:24 2015 UTC,"So because games like CSGO are around, developers shouldn't make another tactical shooter? I don't really get the point you're trying to make. Even with CSGO still around, it's nowhere near in the same tactical sense that Rainbow was. CSGO is a twitch shooter that rewards you for being incredibly accurate and is actually, IMO, pretty fast paced. Any FPS game in general rewards you for being accurate of course, but Rainbow rewarded players for controlling their gun at the same time because of the recoil which honstly, isn't seen in any other game to date, maybe a selected indie titles.   Ubisoft advertise this game as tactical. Which it isn't. It doesn't have the same tactical mechanics that it was well known for. Its a cut and copy of a modern fps game,  completely cutting itself from its root. They should rename this game in all honestly, and hope to get more sales by NOT advertising it as a Rainbow game."

Rainbow6,328hcw,Differlot,2,Sat Apr 11 20:18:36 2015 UTC,"You're pretty much implying it.  I still don't get what point you're making.  It's a niche market because we haven't had a true tactical shooter for god knows how many years. We don't honestly know if the genre is still favored but from the reactions of the subreddit and Rainbow Six forums, the community obviously want that experience. CSGO isn't that experience that people want. I haven't come across a game in the last 5 years that really comes close, maybe Red Sabre? Take a risk and make something new, or in this case, revive an old fps genre."
Rainbow6,328hcw,Gookywun,-2,Sat Apr 11 20:24:33 2015 UTC,"What im saying is that siege is ubisoft's CSGO. It's not supposed to be its ravenshield.

Rainbow6,328hcw,Brethon,0,Sun Apr 12 03:34:06 2015 UTC,"So because games like CSGO are around, developers shouldn't make another tactical shooter?   They want to eat Valve's lunch. It's easier to get a project greenlit when your proposal says ""these guys have the lion's share and we can take some of their playerbase when we make a similar game"" than if you come up with a novel idea.    CSGO is a twitch shooter that rewards you for being incredibly accurate and is actually, IMO, pretty fast paced.   I have to disagree with this point. I had the same misconception about CS (from playing 20-player de_dust games back in high school) until my friends got me into CS:GO's 5v5 matchmaking mode. The game is 100% about tactics both as a team (how many player to commit and where, when to rotate to the other half of the map, how to coordinate an entry with flashes/smokes) and individually (run vulnerable w/ knife, or walk stealthily with rifle; peek a corner to trade risk for information). Here's a recording of me playing where it all comes together.  While fighting 1v1 can often feel like it comes down to whoever has the best twitch reflexes, a large part of playing CS:GO is ensuring that you're never engaging in a fair fight. You always want to have the numbers advantage, be flanking, have areas smoked off / flashed, etc.   Rainbow rewarded players for controlling their gun at the same time because of the recoil which honstly, isn't seen in any other game to date   This is actually one of the least newbie-friendly features that CS has. Rifle spray patterns form a predictable but zig-zag shape, and there's a muscle memory component to compensating so that your bullets land on target."
Rainbow6,328hcw,nomoneypenny,0,Sat Apr 11 21:31:38 2015 UTC,No I'm saying they should and have made a game like csgo not like raven shield. Tactical shooters like this community seem to want are slow methodical room clearing affairs with planning for simultaneous breaches set in stone at the beginning of the round on a map compared to based on on the fly understanding of enemy placement and objective location (map in raven shield vs csgo planning with a 5 man premade). The recoil I agree needs fixing but most of the stuff that people say is gamebreaking is further from csgo and closer to ravenshield and in my view not suitable for a competitive shooter. I also disagree that its not tactical even in its current state. Yes you can play poorly running and gunning and you will get your arse handed to you if the enemy team is at all coordinated. Note not competent but coordinated. You run round a corner and the guy who's encouraged to stay still will shoot you in the face. You link up with sledge while tossing flashbangs into the newly created hole and you have a chance of surviving. Its by no means perfect but describing it as the worst thing ever because its not like a game from ten years ago in every sense is not an appropriate comparison. In terms of rainbow its closer to vegas than raven shield which remains a rainbow game fitting in with the books if not with the original games which I'm quite fine with personally.
Rainbow6,328hcw,lightmight,1 point,Sat Apr 11 21:35:56 2015 UTC,"This game is way more tactical than you make it sound, the possibilities are pretty exciting. Working as a team, in a competitive setting. When no actual teamplay is involved, it does loose ""tacticality"" (?), but isn't that the case with any tactical game ? Judging how tactical this game is from a Matchmaking mode with the shittiest VoiP and players that barely have any knowledge of the game is really low."

Take a risk and make something new, or in this case, revive an old fps genre.   That's a part of the problem with a lot of the people claiming there is none. So far I have seen plenty of matches where people do triples breaches etc... Heck if you grab a riot shield your team generally seems to actually sit behind you for cover. One of the matches I saw a duo using camera to guide to enemy locations on VOIP and shooting any jammers they spot. Pubs may not always do it, but grab a friend and think up some stuff or use mics?  Personally I save my camera let teammates find hostage and breach any reinforced walls on a lot of maps."
Rainbow6,328hcw,Reapter,-1,Sat Apr 11 22:09:39 2015 UTC,"I believe they have the right elements implemented in place but it just doesn't fit together that well? I feel like this is hugely determined by the 3 minute, short rounds. Honestly, I feel rushed a lot of time and don't get enough time to really use my drone for scouting, flank areas or pace myself. It just feels very, get in, find the hostage room and try to find the quickest way to get the hostage out (which is very rarely) or just kill off the enemy team.   It's got potential, I absolutely agree, they just need to tweak areas to one side, being either slow and tactical or just fast paced. Do I see an in between? I think that's kinda what we have at the moment."
Rainbow6,328hcw,Gookywun,1 point,Sat Apr 11 21:02:31 2015 UTC,"I enjoy the fact that it's fast paced, it would get too easy for either the attacking or the defending side if max time got longer.   Also, what's important to note is that, again in a competitive setting, everyone would know what they have to do since you'd plan this ahead and make sure you have backup plans. What i'm going to say is to be applied on matches with solid teamwork and communication, if not trust-worthy teammates.  What I mean is defenders have to make a solid defence plan and set it up as fast as possible since you could see attackers around the hostage as soon as 02:40, with that in mind everything must be planned and well thought. There is room for improvisation but that should rely on pre established strategies.  Same goes for attack, defenders expect you around the hostage at 02:40, so you've got 2 and a half minutes to wrap your mind around what the defence is doing and use the best counter strategy you've got in head knowing that once the actual assault is launched, it's a point past which you can't go back. Concerning using the cameras/drones and all that, you've got 5 guys that can all do that, everyone can do different things at the same time and gather the intel they've got, let alone using each operator's specific gadget.  Speaking, Operator Picks and synergy seem like a huge part of the planning, sadly we can't experience it because we only have access to half the Operators. I'm already starting to feel more comfortable with a couple of them, they could easily be considered my main operators. That would mean both sides would have to plan what they'd do basing themselves on what they expect the other team to pick ! Right now we pretty much expect every Operator to be present (sometimes there can be a couple recruits but rarely more), so it feels tame, but I really believe pick phase would be crucial during e-sporty matches.  The more I talk about it, the more I feel like the whole game is build around advanced teamplay, and that very much feels like Rainbow 6 to me. Whether the gameplay is similar or not.  That's my opinion on the subject, and mainly why I can't disagree more with all those ""hardcore"" fans that apparently want to play R6 in a casual way more than in a truly tactical way. Casually playing, this R6 does feel shitty."
Rainbow6,328hcw,Djaquitchane,-1,Sat Apr 11 21:22:19 2015 UTC,"When you actually compare the moment-to-moment gameplay of Black Ops 3 with that of R6: Siege, you realize that R6: Siege isn't just ""another shooter"". It does things differently. Enforcing a ""one-life"" policy would be unthinkable in a game like Black Ops 3. However, there are areas where it's closer to those games. I agree that the weapon handling is way too ""easy"" and ""spray"":y. They can tweak these things though. I also hope they improve the netcode cause it's not really ""there"" in terms of responsiveness."
Rainbow6,328hcw,Gookywun,4,Sat Apr 11 18:54:15 2015 UTC,"The one life per round feature is definitely something I encourage, but I don't think its enough to differentiate itself from another title such as CoD. It doesn't help when the game also encourages similar run and gun mechanics, in my opinion.   They will tweak certain things, as we expect. The real question is if it's enough? I'd hate this game to just be for nothing but I can't help it with the way it is presented in Alpha.  To add to this. I don't think having lots of shorts rounds helps this. 3 minute rounds are way too short and ruin the sense of being tactical at all. It makes you feel rushed. You just don't get enough time to utilize all the different mechanics they implemented into the game. This also, can be tweaked I hope."
Rainbow6,328hcw,asdfpanda,4,Sat Apr 11 19:18:48 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. People should give feedback and be patient. If the end product is good, buy it. If it isn't, don't. The ""end times are near"" mentality of this sub is, at times, ridiculous."

If they want to make a completely different game than what is expected in a Rainbow Six game, then they should start another franchise.  They are just muddying up an already muddied title hoping to sucker in old fans and new ones, and then they'll drop the Siege formula on the next game and try to sucker everyone again.  Rainbow was originally about situations and tactics that could use many real life tactics to accomplish a task.  Siege is all about unrealistic things with unrealistic counter things.  If I wanted COD I would play COD and not an R6 title.  Come on, can you really look at magical white outlined players, a complete lack of working doors in a CQB (first time ever for R6!), magical barbed wire that only affects the other team, magical hit markers, no gimping, getting restored to 50% health after being almost dead, and all of the other unrealistic elements of this game and still think it has anything to do with Rainbow Six??!?!?!  If COD or BF changed their game this much they would be ridiculed into oblivion and laughed at by all.  It's a very stupid thing to upset your core fans and radically change a game for no reason.

They don't need to ""reboot"" the series.  They need to go back to Ravenshield and continue the highly successful series where it left off before they just slapped the R6 title on anything shooter related that they wanted to.  Contrary to what some post, the original 3 games were in no way a NICHE and beat out other AAA titles at that time.  There is a huge market for the type of realism the original R6 games had, being somewhere between COD and ARMA.  I've played dozens of hours of Siege Alpha to try to like it, and I just can't.  My clan and I enjoyed BF1942, Ravenshield, and IL2 flight sim all at the same time on different nights.  We like other types of games and were never just R6, but we play the best of the type of game we like, and Siege doesn't fill that role in any way.  There are better casual shooters out there."
Rainbow6,3287sb,Pest_AWC,1 point,Sat Apr 11 19:58:20 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with the ""huge market between CoD and Arma"" and that's exactly what I'm hoping for. And while it'd be nice to have the franchise go back to its roots, I'm also open to new gameplay mechanics too. I'm not saying I'm for anything, but I appreciate what they're trying to do. At the moment, it's too far to the CoD side, but if they add in some Arma gameplay then I think they could have an awesome game here. While I'd love an old classic R6 style game (of course), I also think that this game mode they're showcasing would be a ton of fun if done correctly. I cannot say for sure what Ubi will do and what they will change, but I'm still hopeful that they will make the changes we want. Again, they're still trying to sell a product, and if many people want it changed, there's actually a decent chance it will change. However, as I mentioned in the post, being rude is not going to help anything. Yes it can be frustrating to see devs not listen, but let's give them a chance to see if they do. If they don't, then I totally understand the harsh posts. But jumping the gun and bashing the alpha is just going to cause a mess and won't get anything done. So my main goal with this is to just keep the feedback coming and back up your concerns with facts. Saying ""This game is crap"" isn't going to give Ubi anything to go by and is simply immature. I'm nervous about it, but let's at least give them a shot to make the changes before going completely nuts. A lot of gamers have been screwed by AAA devs and are a little on edge, I get it. But we can't just assume Ubi will not listen to us until after the alpha. Hopefully we will get a good game, and I hope to play it with other people on here. As for now, just keep the constructive criticism going and keep talking about ideas to help. It has a much better chance of helping us get the game we want than bashing does. I know we all have common interests, and I'd hate for us trying to help Ubi get drowned out by random hate posts. We just have to keep up the feedback and support our concerns. It's our best chance to help ourselves and Ubi get a great game on the shelves. Hope this all makes sense! Best regards and let's hope we get a fun game at the end of all this :)."

They never listened to the old fans on ghost recon just compare graw too that future soldier shit they brought out.. Tell me one time ubisoft actually listened to there fans on any franchise and implemented changes based on fans  feedback...  Alpha betea gameplay will always change not based on feed back based on q&a testing.  Common knowledge changes.."
Rainbow6,3287sb,th3angrylego,1 point,Sat Apr 11 13:43:59 2015 UTC,"Well again, I think the massive push to make the game harder/more realistic is enough to make the changes happen. They're still trying to sell a game, and if there are not enough people willing to buy the game, then I think they might be ""forced"" to make them. Yes, nearly every video game franchise has been ""dumbed down"" for casuals to increase sales, but I think when even the casuals are saying ""This is just another version of the game I like to play (CoD),"" I think there's going to be a pretty big problem. As many are saying, the game is trying to appeal to too many people and instead of everyone being on-board, no one is. Casuals aren't interested because it's not CoD, and hardcore gamers aren't interested because it's too casual. I think even the casuals are looking for something else to play (CoD  sales are slowly decreasing year after year) and I think a AAA tactical shooter could be unique enough to pull in a lot of interest. Especially if Esports picks the game up and has some tournaments. A lot of people are saying that if anything, it should take notes from CS:GO. I think if they do, it might be able to get a pretty large audience. Both casuals and hardcore gamers praise CS:GO. To have a next-gen ""successor"" would be a genius idea, especially since console gamers have probably always wanted to try it out. That's why I'm saying if Ubi goes all out and really focuses on Siege, it will be an excellent game. It'd be a cool main gamemode and a game with little to no competition. It has a lot of potential, all they need to do is take the feedback seriously. All we can do is hope and keep posting feedback. But talking trash on the game like I mentioned above isn't going to help anything. But if the changes don't make it into the game, then it won't sell and we'll just move on. But at least we can say we tried to help. Either way it'll be a good lesson to all devs that fan feedback is extremely important.  I think 343 now sees the important of fan-feedback with Halo. Halo 4 was a mix of too many things and now they've finally found a balance between new/refreshing gameplay and old gameplay that made it what it is today. I keep saying, they've had something like 4 surveys in 3-4 months with more to come. That's how making a game should be done. An alpha/beta nearly a year before release and tons of surveys and feedback to find the best balance. Halo 5's beta was one of the most fun things I've played in a few years. Yeah there were some balancing issues and such, but it felt exactly what it should've: classic but new. I can always go back to the old games if I want the old gameplay, just like I can for R6. I want something new though, that mixes old and new mechanics for the better. At the moment, Siege hasn't done this. They've only created an identity crisis like Jackfrags mentioned."

Tell me one time ubisoft actually listened to there fans on any franchise   They don't, but so doesn't other 90%(or more) of the gaming industry. You can't blame them, a game has to sell. BUT I can bet there are a lot of devs who share they same sentiments as fans and I possibly they are also fighting with higher authority about the same.   Why should they fight for a community, where most don't know about gave development, and yet calls the developers ""noob devs"".   Criticize all you want as long as its constructive. As OP said   If the changes aren't made before the release, then simply don't buy it.   The community is complaining a lot about ""COD kids"" and sometimes it feels ironic seeing them act as ""kids"" here"

Rainbow6,3287sb,briandigital,2,Sun Apr 12 03:10:33 2015 UTC,"""but we're still a small portion of potential buyers"" sorry , but are you a shareholder or a gamer ? , because in my Universe the gamer cares more about the game , without giving 2 s*** about company's profit , the problem with today gaming is that gamers care more about company making a profit instead of the game   i was attacking Ubisoft because R6Siege clearly is not Rainbow Six , they promised us a return to its roots and siege is not a return to its roots , they treat us like idiots with all the ""Return to the R6 roots"" , i hope you get what i'm trying to say (it is not a personal attack)"
Rainbow6,3287sb,briandigital,1 point,Sat Apr 11 22:37:48 2015 UTC,"I see what you're getting at, I'm simply taking a ""devil's advocate"" approach and looking at both sides. While I'm completely with you and want it to go back to its roots, we also have to look at it realistically as well. As I said, AAA games are expensive to make, which is why devs usually try to get more potential buyers. While I wish it wasn't that way, it's simple business. Of course I care about the game, but I'm also giving some insight of why we might not fully get what we want. In a perfect world, we'd all get perfect games made just for us, but at the end of the day Ubi still needs to make money. And while I'm not staying awake at night praying that the Ubi executives can buy Lambos, I'm simply letting people know that there's many things they have to consider and can't just rely on a few dedicated fans (even though it'd be nice haha). So yes, I do want the game to sell because I want more R6 games, but at the same time I also want the game to be good so I can have fun. So same as you said, I hope you also get why I'm looking at both sides. -And I totally understand your comments and concerns :) -"
Rainbow6,3287sb,briandigital,0,Sun Apr 12 02:40:31 2015 UTC,"i understand what are you saying , but i learned that publishers are treating us ""the Gamers"" like idiots only to please their shareholders  and i don't believe all the games are more expensive to make , when Indies with less money can make a better job than a Triple A publisher , look at Insurgency for example this game has more quality than ACUnity (which it was a Mess) , i don't believe that they invest money on Making the game , they're investing money on Marketing , believe me they are not investing their money on making a better product , we can have buyers only with advertisement , so why wasting our money on making a game that actually work ? (i was playing Ubisoft mentality lol) , the older Rainbow Six showed the world that change means success , and today change means failing , today's success is copying other games ffs , i know for sure that COD players will still buy cod , so the ones that will have an arcade game is us (the rainbow six players) , wich we have been here saying we want a return to the R6 roots like they promised us"
Rainbow6,3287sb,Valtheim_,1 point,Sun Apr 12 14:42:55 2015 UTC,"I can't argue with anything you said except your statements on Indie games. Games like Limbo, Insurgency, Bastion, etc. all have very positive receptions, but only a handful of people made them. For example, Bastion's OST is one of the most popular/well received OST's in any medium. I've it mentioned whenever ""OST"" is brought up on the internet. Despite all that, the soundtrack was recorded in a closet. They also each have a very small number of employees. On top of all that, AC Unity, while bugged, had one of the most beautiful settings praised even in scathing reviews, while something like Insurgency has barely any focus on realistic graphics and even relies on custom made maps from fans. Truth is, if Ubi put out Unity and it looked exactly what AC2 did, it would be criticized by nearly everyone, even if the gameplay was solid. Of course, as you said, a large portion of money goes into marketing, which isn't the best way to do things anymore. If I was making a game, I'd hand out copies to people like Angry Joe, Rooster Teeth/Achievement Hunter, Pewdiepie, etc. that have enormous audiences. Right now, Indie devs are selling tons and AAA devs are going slightly downhill because of what you said, they're focusing on making a quick buck. But if the game sucks, then you're going to lose future sales. And AAA devs usually rely on sequels to get by, while Indie devs can make millions (split between only 5-20 people) and be set for life. As I've mentioned in other posts on this subreddit, R6 Siege is a very important game and will be a bit of a sample of what will come in future years. This generation of consoles will be a very important one since Indie games and downloadable sales are taking off. The entire gaming market was changed by CoD's sales, and now that they're starting to dip (slowly) it's going to be interesting to watch what happens."
Rainbow6,3287sb,briandigital,0,Sun Apr 12 15:12:40 2015 UTC,"there's no reason puttin over 100 people on making a game , for me small teams = better communication , big team = sometimes can make confusion"
Rainbow6,3287sb,briandigital,2,Sun Apr 12 15:26:19 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. Not really why AAA devs still have such big teams to be completely honest. I hate to see layoffs at any company, but if they wanted to avoid them, they should split the people up and get even more games out. When Indie devs are making better games than the AAA devs (Cities: Skylines) it's pretty evident that AAA devs are doing quite a bit wrong. Seems like the smart thing to do is to get a group of passionate people together to make a game. Check out the Witcher 3 for example. Hell, the Witcher 2 was so good that they didn't even need to worry about people pirating the game. It was so good that the pirates were actually buying the game because they felt like they needed to support the people that made it. That's pretty unbelievable. I know they're not extremely small like some Indie devs, but from what I've gathered they're still a pretty small team (like the guys/gals that make the Metro games). It's funny because both of those games can make my computer lag from the sheer detail put into the textures and physics."

If you just call it Rainbow Six: (insert new name here) then fans of the original will expect it to be like Rogue Spear and Ravenshield, fans of Lockdown (were there any?) will expect an easy arcade shooter, fans of Vegas will expect magical 3rd person views, health regen, aim assist, and pink camo, and fans of Siege will expect COD on small 5 VS 5 maps with no doors.

Rainbow6,3281pl,lowflyingmeat,2,Sat Apr 11 16:04:30 2015 UTC,If they would bring back the original rainbow members that alone would make the game a lot more interesting to me.  No more SWAT and FBI members in my military shooter please.  Add a few doors and some improved recoil physics and we've got ourselves a game.

Rainbow6,3281pl,Pest_AWC,3,Sat Apr 11 13:04:43 2015 UTC,"It can make the game more interesting. The whole thing about RAINBOW as an organisation was how it worked. No more than a hundred people in the US Government knew it existed. And when they did go to work, they would adopt the local law enforcement's uniform to disguise their presence.   The problem with Siege is not only do they not do that, they are seen wearing FBI, SAS and GIGN uniforms. This points to the fact they are not even RAINBOW at all. Which in the end makes this game (until we see the Singleplayer) feel like it had the Rainbow title slapped on.  The aesthetics of characters is important also. Being a Paramilitary FPS with a serious tone of the series makes having a golden gun camo just seems really out of place. Especially in a Tom Clancy brand game."

The Defenders have to make the choice of fortifying choke points or fortifying the hostage; as well as choosing whether to barricade, or to hunt drones.

Maybe you can move around flying drones that can only view the map from the exterior?

Should allow the 30s to be useful to both sides, but not be ridiculous. I also hope for some kind of matchmaking system akin to the one in CS:GO, so we don't get super good players fighting against newbies, and vice versa"

Rainbow6,3261eg,donrocks123,6,Fri Apr 10 23:30:22 2015 UTC,"Yep, if they really wanted to make a new R6, they totally missed the point. Either they didn't think it would be a good idea to have the input of an actual fan of the original games during development, or using the name and making the claims of going back to roots was just a marketing tactic.   Considering the current overabundance of COD clones I can't help but think this game will flop pretty quickly. I'm really disappointed, but I guess there are a few decent tactical shooters on the market so it's not like there's nothing that comes close."

Tbh I even would have been happier with vegas 3 than what we have so far.   The game we have just lacks any depth that could keep it interesting for very long. But realistically it's too late in the day for them to change too much so we may as well just suck it up and wait for the next major R6 release and hope it is more TACTICAL and TEAM oriented without the COD gen 'features'"

What they lost was the point of all red storm games, to develop something realistic even if it meant it being to complex or too ambitious.  Rouge spear was full of game breaking glitches and tons of bugs, damage in pop seemed very random (guys taking 1 to the foot and dies when another took 5 to the chest and lives).  But it also tons of huuuuggee detailed maps, every gun I could imagine, tons of camo, tons of gadgets, a huge movie caliber campaign, an insanely good soundtrack, and it was unique.  I know not many would agre with me but taking away third person view killed the franchise for me.  Yes it was campy, but no one is ever going to expiernce of a best of three map on train taking 2 hours because it kept going to 1v1 and time ran out on the round.  That makes me sad.  They made the game like everything else and it lost its magic.  I will always seriously love rouge spear multiplayer and everyone who ever played it."

There's realistic equipment, a detailed planning phase, multiple breaching tools, and brutally lethal gunplay that forces you to play carefully or suffer the consequences.    The game plays out in furious bursts of door kicking and room clearing, and the winning team knows they earned their victory through pure skill.  That's what we'd like to see from Siege.  No modern shooter cliches like hitmarkers and last stand and wallhack HUD.  Just pure tactical gameplay."

Yes I realise they usually place their arm around the shield and shoot from in front but when actually using it and watching killcams of when you have died from a Recruit it looks they are holding the shield in front of them but placing the gun and firing from behind the shield.  This means they can inflict damage on you but you do very little damage to them. It also doesn't help that a few times I've used the Recruit I haven't been able to reload my pistol.   We've played some awesome team games, when people actually bother to communicate where someone breaches while the Recruit leads the way with the others backing him up and you can easily demolish the enemy if you play it right.  In all honesty, playing this game tactically with a group who play the same way is the only reason I'm still playing the alpha because this run-and-gun shit is getting on my nerves."

I know that some this week have questioned our relative silence, and aren't satisfied with the ""we are listening"" response but indeed, that's exactly what we're doing right now. We're just listening. To this subreddit, to the forums, to the YouTubers and streamers, to the player data we're getting from the game, to surveys that will be sent out to participants, etc.  It's a lot to review, and we want to be very sure of our decisions. Next week once the Closed Alpha is over we will be putting it all together and figuring out what the big picture is. Once we've done that, we'll make decisions based upon the overall feedback.  The communication back to you may not happen right away, because there are plenty of internal debates to be had, but once we have something in place we will be responding to the main topics of feedback individually. The philosophy that we are trying to establish here is that if we decide not to act on a point of feedback, we will at least try to communicate why we made that decision. This is a new approach for us at Ubisoft and we're learning as we go, but that's what we aim for and I appreciate your patience.  Thank you for all of the great feedback this week and your thoughtful and thorough analysis. It means a lot to us."

It doesn't matter if they are fans of the original 3 R6 games, it only matters that they are the ones going out of their way to show interest and participate.     You can assume that the COD fans UBI is aiming for aren't the least bit interested in following this subreddit or buying the game, since it would only entertain the NICHE of COD fans that prefer small 5 VS 5 no respawn games.  Trust me, that's about as small of a NICHE market as you could try for, and may not even exist.

You can't really blame them. Lockdown was the beginning of an era where Ubisoft would prioritize the console market, thus really gutting out a lot of the depth in the series in order to appeal to a more casual audience (not to mention simplifying or removing things because of controller restrictions).  No doubt many long time fans got excited when Ubisoft promised a return to form with Siege. Of course they'd be disappointed in its current state."

Rainbow6,3261zx,JackWallabee,3,Sat Apr 11 15:34:36 2015 UTC,"Believe it or not my first R6 was Vegas 2 on the PS3. Then many years later, once Rainbow Six 3 Gold Edition came out on Steam (the original Raven Shield + expansions) I bought it.   You really need to try it out, because the experience it delivers is so unique and different from any modern shooter. If you've ever played the classic Splinter Cell titles (1-3) it shares a similar tension. The game was hard and unforgiving. It was a rich game with a lot of depth. It's the kind of experience I'd love other people to experience, but with modern day technology.   Although Raven Shield looks dated and has rather clunky AI (it's 12 years old, after all), I really wish Siege would capture the spirit of that game.   Back in the day, development was prioritized around the PC. Rainbow Six 1, Rogue Spear, and Raven Shield were built with the PC in mind and all the complexities of the keyboard. There were also console ports to PS1/PS2 and Xbox, where the games were simplified a bit, some features removed, and singleplayer campaign reworked to provide smoother play on the consoles. So you had the PC versions, which had all the features, and the console versions, which were slightly remade for pick-up-and-play.  Now Ubi is trying to go the other way, consoles to PC. And since the PC games are direct ports of the console games, we're stuck with their limitations and their tastes. See where the frustration comes from?  If you don't mind outdated graphics, sometimes-derpy AI, or slow/cautious/methodical play, I urge you to try out Raven Shield on Steam."

It was fun for a few moments, but it lacked so much and was completely different than Raven Shield. Why you'd want to turn Rainbow Six into COD is beyond me. Ubi should clearly make a separate game for consoles."

Look at Bloodborne for the PS4 - that isn't dumbed down and we are loving that.  I know it's not an fps but my point is it's hard and only appeals to people who want a real challenge.  I think Ubisoft should capitalise on the fact that the console is starved for a true Rainbow Six experience.  I'd play their game without any HUD markers at all.

You just compare out of class weapons to try and throw off someone that hasn't played hardline. The only two you can fairly compare would be the M416 and M16.

Rainbow6,324vsd,Breitschwert,3,Sat Apr 11 02:11:45 2015 UTC,"I've played both, and I don't really see how you can draw this conclusion.  That's like saying Unreal Tournament and Battlefield are the same thing because they're both shooters, in first person, and are not really realistic.  Hardline utilizes the Battlefield engine, which specializes in open maps with multiple pathways between buildings or terrain, and some neat projectile physics.  Siege specializes in closed maps with multiple pathways because you can breach walls and specialized tactical gear.  All shooters have an element of twitch to them now.  Being a twitch shooter will help in EVERY game, even Insurgency and ARMA.  Not saying that it's more important than strategy and tactics, but it's a skill and you need it.  I find it hard to consider this a ""twitch shooter"" game because to me, twitch shooter games specialize in rapid death + respawn.  You don't worry about dying because you'll be back, the only downside to death is your K/D looks bad.  In R6S, dying means your team is at a significant disadvantage.  Thus, you can't just plan on dying, because killing 3 and dying is still worse than killing none but being alive long enough to suppress the enemy.  R6S, at its core, still puts a tactical team at an advantage.  You can't tell me that a team of 5 people randomly running around is going to be more successful than a team of 5 who coordinate a good defensive or offensive plan.  This game could just use a few tweaks, additional objectives (I suggested in another thread that the hostage-taking team could get more points by moving the hostage and themselves to an ""escape"" point that is randomly selected, to give them an alternative to camping), and gameplay analysis.  I think the biggest problem is that it's called Rainbow 6, which brings up a lot of nostalgic memories.  I love nostalgia, that's why I watch Cinemassacre religiously, but I accept that old school shooters just don't fly with today's gaming audience.  That's why I'm actually happy with R6S, because it's at least introducing SOME tactical components, which might help transition today's young gamers to cerebral, thinking-man's shooters in the future.  For me, it might not be R6 like I remember, but it's baby steps towards a better industry."
Rainbow6,324vsd,Brethon,3,Sat Apr 11 00:49:46 2015 UTC,"I had the chance to play the game now too. Gave up after 4 rounds, the foundation of the game something that could be shaped into a great game, but the current gameplay shows you what people they want to attract.  What a shame. Maybe terrorist hunt/coop is better and maybe they improve it enough during the alpha. But yea, the current PvP is way too fast and killcams coupled with lots of not connecting shots is too annoying for me. :("
Rainbow6,324vsd,Breitschwert,12,Fri Apr 10 17:03:43 2015 UTC,"Please don't give up so quick. I absolutely despise the direction Siege is going in right now, but take the time to play it and voice your opinion in the Alpha feedback. Maybe it's a waste of breathe, but just maybe it will help us get a game we actually want.  If everyone says silent there's 100% chance we won't get the game we want."
Rainbow6,324vsd,Brethon,2,Fri Apr 10 17:44:43 2015 UTC,"I mean I gave up on playing. I can still give feedback without playing, but the difference in gameplay would be so huge, that I do not think that it will happen. They obviously want to cater to the current popular market and not make a realistic shooter. But yes, I will give comments on that. I will however not continue to play it, unfortunately, as it is totally opposite of what I want.  Not playing is also a metric, I guess. :/"
Rainbow6,324vsd,Breitschwert,3,Fri Apr 10 18:19:55 2015 UTC,"Cool dude. I have to admit, I don't actually look forward to playing more of it. I will keep using all my gaming time for it until the Alpha closes - partly so I can have full understanding of how it is now, and also in-case they look at in-game time when weighing feedback. But it's not really fun :-/  I agree, ""it sucked so much I didn't want to play it"" should serve as some sort of warning/feedback for them."
Rainbow6,324vsd,Brethon,2,Fri Apr 10 18:34:32 2015 UTC,"I might play it more on the weekend. Always good to get gameplay in to make comments on in-game issues. I probably won't be able to talk a lot about what little details I find wrong.  But for example the simple fact how big the hitmarkers are (not that I want those), screams console game...so you can see them easily on a TV. :(  And recoil would force you to have to re-aim, so they removed it. Because that is hard with controllers."
Rainbow6,324vsd,trineroks,2,Fri Apr 10 18:46:27 2015 UTC,"Sad truth. I read that BF4, for example, doesn't get to have stronger recoil on the PC because it would be too much for console players and the devs didn't want to have two separate games to work on :-/  Also, the load-out menu: how has nobody mentioned that? It SCREAMS ""console"" at the top of its lungs. So much for PC as the primary platform."

Would it be so hard to go the route of the older Rainbow Six games and offer a deep, realistic, hardcore tactical Rainbow Six shooter on the PC with a simplified version for the console? All the old Rainbow Six titles did this.  I really feel like a lot of the dumbed down experience is because Ubisoft is trying to prioritize the console market first, PC second.

Rainbow6,324vsd,aceattorneymvp,2,Fri Apr 10 20:28:28 2015 UTC,"I'm going to go ahead and say you're wrong with Hardline. The game is fun, I've put about 120 hours into it so far, and the Rescue mode is surprisingly good and a change of pace. The difference is that Hardline's Rescue mode is exactly that; it's a change of pace, the game has a lot of other unique and different game modes to play. With Rainbow Six: Siege you can expect that the other game modes will feel very similar to this one.  Also, all shooters rely on twitch skills to an extent, and Battlefield is, believe it or not, one of the ones that do so less. Even though Hardline's TTK is shorter than that of Battlefield 4's, it's still longer than games such as CS or CoD.  Angry Joe is an okay guy, but it's important to realize he's not somebody who spends hundreds of hours on a single game. He plays the game for 50 hours or so, makes a review on it, and makes money, that's his job. Look at the reviews given to Hardline by channels that almost exclusively do Battlefield content, a lot of the veterans of the series (myself included, I own every Battlefield game and expansion/DLC except 2142's single expansion) were surprised when they enjoyed the game, while a lot of people who are ""casuals"" of the series didn't enjoy it as much. That being said, Joe was pretty excited for Rainbow Six: Siege, so I'm interested to see what he has to say about the changes we've seen from the E3 reveal to the actual game, because there are a lot of them."
Rainbow6,324vsd,iceycat,3,Fri Apr 10 17:02:23 2015 UTC,So how exactly are they not almost the exact same thing aside from maps and characters?
Rainbow6,324vsd,SnoopyTRB,0,Fri Apr 10 17:41:46 2015 UTC,Thank you - a good community and group of gamers can make Siege really fun and tactical. What we see in the alpha are a bunch of randoms learning the game. That isn't a solid enough of an indication that the game lacks any tactics.
Rainbow6,324vsd,Shensmobile,5,Fri Apr 10 17:22:31 2015 UTC,"It doesn't lack tactics.... It lacks realistic damage, recoil, uniforms, and it rewards running and gunning, strafe dancing, and shooting blindly through walls. You can use tactics.. You just don't need too.. That's the problem.   If people can run and gun then this game will not be what the old rainbow six fans want."

Rainbow6,324vsd,Jwolf1995,-1,Fri Apr 10 19:08:39 2015 UTC,"It's just not realistic. As most games. You should only be able to survive multiple rounds with 0 negative effect to the stomach/chest, below the ribcage on your sides to your hips, and your back. If you get hit in the arms or feet it shouldn't kill you unless you bleed out, but it should disable you."

Once everyone gets on the same page and we plan to breach and use grenades together, we level the playing field.  I don't feel like running and gunning has ever worked for me, or anybody I've watched.  Can you show me footage where a run and gun team is able to beat a team that actually shores up their offensive/defensive plan?"
Rainbow6,324vsd,megafallout3fan,2,Sat Apr 11 00:57:57 2015 UTC,Shooting through walls fishing for markers isn't tactical and is very much effective.

Rainbow6,32419h,Aware_building,2,Sat Apr 11 00:02:13 2015 UTC,/u/iceycat asked this question on another thread and you can read my response here: http://www.reddit.com/r/Rainbow6/comments/3261zx/dev_feedback_to_our_feedback/
Rainbow6,32419h,electr1cpanda,4,Sat Apr 11 00:14:11 2015 UTC,"It's funny that even R6 Ravenshield had the ability to move the hostage.  It was a slow process, but you could bump into him and keep making him move in a particular direction.  The map (we need one on Siege!) showed the original location, so the map was essentially recent intel that would be slightly off if the defenders slowly pushed the hostage out of their before the attackers arrived.  Unfortunately, most clans never played the objective games on Ravenshield since there was no side switching after a round.  If there were 6 rounds in a match, you played them all as offense or all as defense.  This made for unbalanced competitions."
Rainbow6,32419h,Pest_AWC,3,Fri Apr 10 13:50:12 2015 UTC,"Yep, i understand its early. But they really have to change things around a lot.  People should remember where the hostage is. Not any markers. Too much ammo, everyone just sprays. Rounds are too quick indeed. i thought it would be more tactical, possibly with friends, but when someone learns the hostage position, they go straight for it, blows the walls and runs in."
Rainbow6,32419h,Suvaius,3,Fri Apr 10 15:49:37 2015 UTC,"Good points, it's hugely overlapping with what many of us here tried to convey to the devs, but much better worded. Thanks."

Rainbow6,32419h,ross84cr,2,Fri Apr 10 12:19:02 2015 UTC,Honestly it feels like Team Deathmatch but with 1 life. The hostage doesn't matter. The game is too fast paced and insane for the six team to ever extract the hostage. There is so much shooting through walls and nonsense going on that it just won't be possible. The hostage isn't the objective of the game. The objective is to wipe out the other team.
Rainbow6,32419h,RayzTheRoof,2,Fri Apr 10 23:30:27 2015 UTC,You should really post this on the forums btw. I assume it is more likely the devs will see and acknowledge it there.

Rainbow6,32419h,venom1987,1 point,Fri Apr 10 23:21:37 2015 UTC,"The round clock is strange. Three minutes is more than enough for Team Raven to take their time, execute more than one breach, and mop up the defenders if they know where the hostage is. I've played rounds on Plane where nobody found the hostage and we had to move much more deliberately; on those rounds, time is actually a factor and added to the sense of urgency in the match.  In general, I feel that the round time hardly matters-- not only because it's so plentiful, but also because Team Rogue doesn't have many tools to delay the attackers. In Counter-Strike, rounds are two minutes long (+60 seconds when a hostage is being extracted) and a well-placed smoke grenade or two can knock 10-15 crucial seconds off the rescuers' movements.  Time pressure is always on your mind, so many decisions are weighed against each other while considering the costs in risk, resources, and time. This is not the case in the Siege alpha so far.  I also expect that as the game gets played more, people will become better at attacking. They'll scout more efficiently with drones and have a plan ready by the time the round starts, so round time will be even less of a concern for Raven."

I feel like they help to create the issues we see in AAA gaming today, like companies releasing a poor quality product, not delivering on promises, or sometimes borderline false advertising. When you pre-order, you are sort of saying that you are so confident in this game being good, that you are willing to buy it on day one with no thought put into it. This makes publishers rush the devs to push out titles so they can get the pre-order money and then work on the next game for next year so they can do it all over again."

Rainbow6,325lao,mau5eum,4,Fri Apr 10 19:42:34 2015 UTC,It is good that there is no third person view in Siege!
Rainbow6,325lao,nickwitucki,2,Fri Apr 10 22:19:40 2015 UTC,"For me it wasnt the speed of the game that was the problem. It was primarily the gunplay, and the arcadey features (killcam, teammates all visible, infinite reviving, etc).  Ubisoft seems to be trying to make the game appeal to a wider audience, but I dont think they realize how futile that will be. All it will serve to do is alienate their core audience."
Rainbow6,325lao,Maverick_8160,2,Fri Apr 10 21:01:36 2015 UTC,Look at that sexy recoil!
Rainbow6,325lao,Brethon,-2,Fri Apr 10 21:08:42 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on the killcam, outlines and revives, but I'm sick of people saying the movement is too fast and not true to the Rainbow Six series."
Rainbow6,325lao,loyaltrekie,4,Fri Apr 10 21:08:27 2015 UTC,"You are aware there is more to movement then just character speed correct? You have to talk about map design, map size, gameplay deterrents, penalties to movement, etc."
Rainbow6,325lao,Harvey_Dole,1 point,Fri Apr 10 21:24:59 2015 UTC,I'm responding to what they said.
Rainbow6,325lao,trineroks,2,Fri Apr 10 21:44:12 2015 UTC,The speed is not even an issue. If fast movements are more effective than the slow movements... then it becomes a real problem.  Run fast and die quickly is logical and realistic.
Rainbow6,325lao,trineroks,3,Fri Apr 10 21:09:06 2015 UTC,"https://youtu.be/d5at3w55jBo?t=8m25s  Notice the gunplay in this game. Notice how since players are so fragile and there's a lack of sprinting, they're forced to stay at a distance when firing back at enemies. Notice how the players are standing still or leaning when shooting, none of that stupid strafe-spray from hip-go to ADS-spray-kill. And notice how because of the recoil they're using semi-auto/burst shots.  I realize this is far from a perfect example, but Siege doesn't even begin to feel remotely close to something like this.  And here's some adversarial from Raven Shield  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxmsTC2T4IQ  Similar playstyles from SWAT 4, movement restriction + fragility + high recoil places more emphasis on staying at a distance, leaning from cover, and taking shorter and more accurate shots, as well as standing still instead of doing those funny strafe dances while ADS."
Rainbow6,325lao,trineroks,1 point,Fri Apr 10 21:18:45 2015 UTC,"You do realize both SWAT 4 and Rainbow Six HAVE running (similar speed to normal speed in Siege)? They're toggled by Shift and right click respectively.  The only problem is that players are so fragile, and there was no thing as ADS so after you ran you were extremely vulnerable for a while. Now that I think about it, I think tight ADS contributes to the problem as well.  In SWAT 4 and Raven Shield, if you ran your aiming reticle grew huge. It would then take about 2 or 3 seconds to cool down to the normal aiming reticle. ADS pretty much negates this, and with Siege's arcadey instant-snap-to-ADS, it totally negates the need to wait for your aiming reticle to cool down back to normal. It guarantees instant pinpoint accuracy.  These two games also had it so that you had to turn slowly (and it had to be slow) if you wanted to maintain accuracy. If you turned around a little too fast, your reticle would grow wider. ADS guarantees pinpoint accuracy while also currently giving the player liberty in fast turning speeds.  So in the old games, you had something like this:  You'd run into a room. There's a guy sitting right behind the doorway. The guy opens fire on you. Your aiming reticle is still wide since you ran and you need about 3 seconds for it to be level. In addition, you try to snap your attention to the guy behind the doorway and that turning speed keeps the reticle spread out. The guy behind the doorway kills you easily, since you take 2 - 3 shots to die, and the accuracy penalty was punishing for running and trying to turn around quickly.  Now you have this:  You'd run into a room. There's a guy sitting right behind the doorway. The guy opens fire on you. You snap your attention to him and immediately go into ADS and open fire (while strafing too, since fast strafe with no accuracy debuff when in ADS). Bam, pinpoint accuracy."
Rainbow6,325lao,nickwitucki,1 point,Fri Apr 10 22:49:08 2015 UTC,"Um.  Did you read my reply at all? I disproved your point when you said   you shouldn't be forced to not run in   Because the games have run speeds, but they're highly punished."
Rainbow6,325lao,trineroks,1 point,Sat Apr 11 00:42:28 2015 UTC,"For me SWAT 4 felt like a good successor to RvS, keeping what was good, eliminating what was bad and adding some improvements of its own (though I could have done without the OP non-lethals. Yes that sounds like an oxymoron, but if you played SWAT 4, you'll know what I mean!)."
Rainbow6,325lao,Tango167,1 point,Sat Apr 11 01:01:12 2015 UTC,Lethal runs are so difficult. Especially in the later missions; I had to tone down the difficulty from Elite to Hard.  With non-lethals you can pretty much go about pepper spraying and tasing suspects to submission. With lethals you're bound to lose points for killing suspects.

One would argue that that is HIGHLY subjective to each player, however, the current CORE R6 base is in favor of high-realism high-tactical.  On the class system:  I think it should be more or less limited not by character but by country. You won't see FBI SWAT using a Famas (which they've already done) and have specific ROLES.  Say a list I made off the top of my head:  Role 1: Point man  Pistol/shield combo or assault rifle  flash bangs/smoke nades  Role 2: Breacher  Assault rifle or SMG  Pistol  C4 breaching charges (or whatever this game calls them..)  flash gernades  Role 3-5: Riflemen  Assault rifle or SMG  Pistol  Flash/smoke   Possible Role: DMR/Overwatch  Sniper rifle / DMR rifle (long barrel semi auto AR)-- like the current 417 DMR in the game.  Pistol  no grenades or breaching charges  That's just a rough rundown but thats how I think it should be.

The most pressing matter right now is getting the core gameplay feel to be dramatically changed to play out a lot more like a traditional Rainbow Six game.   Once slow, methodical, and realistic play has been reintroduced, would it really hurt to have some weapon skin customization? I mean yeah, it might break immersion for some players, but it wouldn't actually affect any game mechanics. And besides, it's not so much of an eyesore like the customizable Vegas characters.  Take note of Counter Strike Global Offensive, which manages to keep the core gameplay intact while introducing customizable weapons so that players can show off a bit of creativity.  Maybe there could be an option to toggle off customized weapon skins clientside so that all weapons will show up with their stock skins."

I'm afraid that you're probably right. I certainly don't blame any of the hard working devs because they are just doing their jobs. Unfortunately, their job is to make a game that will make the most money as possible, just like any other business. They basically have a money making formula now when it comes to shooters and they have to stick to it. The only reason Rainbow Six was so different in the past is because they didn't know what the formula was yet.   The funny thing is that the type of people who subscribe to this subreddit, a Rainbow Six specific forum, are not in the game's target audience. I'm sure there is some overlap but for the most part the people here are looking for the old niche, tactical shooter that Rainbow Six was. Their target audience probably doesn't even read about video games in their spare time. Their target audience is of the ""casual"" type (I generally dislike the hardcore/casual labels) who will buy the game at Walmart and just play it and that's it.   That's why you see so much complaining here. The people who got excited about a new Rainbow Six early and wanted to be involved before the release are actually looking for something else. I'm sure a lot of the technical feedback is very useful for the devs but a lot of the feedback here about the design of the game won't help them much. They are trying to make a different game than what us old R6 fans want."

Anyway, my point is the more publicity of how bad the game is the less ppl wanna pay for a game like this, the less ppl buy, the less money made, the less they make the more they start asking ""maybe we shouldve paid more attention to the community..."" oppinions whether good or bad is still an opinion and right now thats what they want to hear.

I like the destruction and what little planning we can do, but IMO the hitmarkers and other shit that has been repeated a thousand times now has to go if they want this game to do well with R6 fans and it's not going to happen because, let's be honest, UBI hasn't given a shit about PC gaming and especially PC R6 gamers for years. This game is all about console sales and MLG exposure just like the Vegas games. Both are still seriously broken on PC. I bet most of you don't even know about the R6 council that was formed, some of R6 top gamers and modders picked by UBI, to draft the ultimate R6 game. UBI ignored everything. So if you think they will change anything here don't kid yourself."

It's a tough place to be because I'm sure the tactical shooter market is far smaller than the likes of CoD and Battlefield thus making it much more difficult to really turn a profit.  Its a shame because I absolutely loved the Rainbow Six games and then they started putting out stuff like Lockdown and Vegas (though still fun, not the same style as the originals) and you could see the change. It's unfortunate, really, but I doubt we'll see any major modifications to the game like you said. I'm really hoping, as there seem to be a few people from Ubi on here but who knows what their involvement is with actual development. Could just be PR/Media relations guys."

Why would any group of FPS fans EVER invest time in R6 when UBI has proven they will crap all over whatever fans it creates by going in a different direction next time?  I would love someone from UBI to come in here and explain what business sense it made to quit using the R6 formula from the first 3 games when they were as successful and sometimes more successful than COD and BF games.  R6 was NOT a niche game.  It had its own following that liked the balance of realism and fun that was just as large as those following other types of games.  What UBI is doing is like a popular NASCAR simulator changing to Mario Kart style gameplay to try to pull in a few Mario Kart fans.  Sure, you'll pull in a FEW with money to burn that want a second Mario Kart game, but you will lose ALL of your original fan base."

Rainbow6,323qbq,Brethon,4,Fri Apr 10 16:52:16 2015 UTC,"lol. 0 idea what you're saying, probably didn't put in the effort, or plays at an average level either. Tactics are required in CS to win, and there's a lot of hidden depth in the game, even regarding gunplay. It might be a little ""twitch"" but there's a lot of huge depth you need to understand to properly react to enemies and kill them. There's a reason why it's the most competitive shooter and how BF and CoD doesn't even come close."
Rainbow6,323qbq,Txontirea,3,Fri Apr 10 17:33:14 2015 UTC,"You're a fucking idiot. Why don't you entire subreddit get off your high horse (Especially considering I wasn't being condescending at all, I was the one being looked down upon for being a CS player). There are tons of tactics you have to use to win in CS, especially in the high ranks and pro-scene. You literally have no idea what you're talking about."

I don't know about you, but it seems a majority of people here respect CS for its own merits, myself included. It may not be as realistic as the older Rainbow Six games, but there's no doubt that CS has a rather steep learning curve and even promotes sticking with the team, even in lower level games.   Counter Strike sacrifices some realism for the sake of more competitive play, while Rainbow Six (at least the older ones) straddled the line of simulation for more realistic play. Both do (or did, in the case of Rainbow) what they do really well."

Rainbow6,323qbq,Cognittie,2,Fri Apr 10 17:13:21 2015 UTC,You obviously don't.
Rainbow6,323qbq,aceattorneymvp,0,Fri Apr 10 17:24:24 2015 UTC,The whole concept of Counterstrike back in the 90's was to be a faster paced version of Rainbow Six with less skill and tactics required to win because people felt R6 was too much of a simulation at the time for competitive gaming. I'm guessing you were both too young to remember but you can ask any of the veterans that were around at the time and they will confirm.
Rainbow6,323qbq,RealityKing4Hire,3,Fri Apr 10 17:32:41 2015 UTC,I played both when they were new. CS is still very tactical. It's simply a different game than R6 with a competitive focus.
Rainbow6,323qbq,aceattorneymvp,-3,Fri Apr 10 17:34:43 2015 UTC,"You people keep acting like you're the Elitest Elite in FPS gaming. Crazy.  Making a super hardcore, not casual player friendly game doesn't instantly mean it's a tactical game. I'm not sure what's not to be understood. Rainbow 6 games have always brought a crapload of possibilities, you could play the same action in many ways and be successful, and having played the alpha (unlike you apparently) all I see are possibilities, craploads of them, and guess what ? You have to plan ahead to make those probable outcomes happen, in a team configuration, with observation and communication.   So I'd say even though the gameplay has changed, R6 is still R6.  Edit : I'm fine with the downvotes, the hate train on this subreddit is way too overwhelming, anyone bringing a different point of view from ""YO UBI U SUX DIS GAME SUX U KILLED RNABWO SIX"" gets shit on."
Rainbow6,323qbq,RealityKing4Hire,3,Fri Apr 10 12:59:05 2015 UTC,"Hello Djaquitchane, I have the alpha but are out to work and I can play the weekend. I talked to many lucky players, I read almost all the feedback present on Reddit and I saw, in my free time, hours and hours of gameplay on Twitch.   I don't know what your background in games, but I play online until the first LAN Quake. When he came out Rainbow Six in 1998 it was love at first sight. No jump as Counter Strike, no energy level as Unreal Tournament, as beautiful as Swat4 with real situations and planning. Just the gameplay of Rainbow Six Siege is no longer the first Rainbow Six. He says anyone who is playing R6 for the first time to those who expect this alpha as Christmas. Try to replay the first or Rainbow Six Raven Shield, test and then tell me if you have the impression of playing in a Rainbow Six.

Rainbow6,323qbq,aceattorneymvp,0,Fri Apr 10 13:38:08 2015 UTC,You can't expect games in 2015 to feel like 1998 games. That's not logical.
Rainbow6,323qbq,RealityKing4Hire,1 point,Fri Apr 10 13:42:45 2015 UTC,Rainbow Six in 1998 give a hard time to play just come out! Precisely for this reason that there are all these discussions. Ubisoft should take the work of the Red Storm to stop Raven Shield and retrofitted with engines of today's games. This was logical!
Rainbow6,323qbq,Brethon,2,Fri Apr 10 13:51:46 2015 UTC,"What I'm saying is that standards have changed, a game needs to bring more money than it costs and games cost more and more which means it requires a bigger ""buyer base"". Again, this game can't feel like the earlier Rainbow 6s because current FPS players except a certain amount of things to be present for them to buy and enjoy the game."
Rainbow6,323qbq,Brethon,1 point,Fri Apr 10 13:58:07 2015 UTC,"Do you remember the presentation of Rainbow Six Siege of E3 2014? That video had put all agree. Old and new players had a miracle, but if you analyze well the video, half of the scenes are fake because they are rendered. But that action was from Rainbow Six, the logic, the movements, the speed of action was perfect! I understand the rules of marketing, understand the younger generation and the type of games that work, but why ruin a franchise with a community still active?

The game as it is now is fun and an ok overall shooter, but really lacks in the tactical department. This game is mostly potential right now to me; if they improve the tactical feel and hardcore-ness of it, it will be a great game, if they don't it will still be an ok game you can still have some fun with, if they muck up TH as much as the tactical-ness of multiplayer (it better have some split screen+LAN for consoles) then this game is a bad flop to me.

Rainbow6,3244a7,asdfpanda,1 point,Sun Apr 12 19:51:38 2015 UTC,"The TTK is fine. Right now, the ttk rewards accuracy, as headshots are the name of the game. Tracking aim, as well as twitch accuracy is rewarded. Additionally, a lower ttk does not fit well with the mechanic of being able to shoot through walls.   Why does the ttk, as it is right now, facilitate non-tactical gameplay?"
Rainbow6,3244a7,asdfpanda,1 point,Sat Apr 11 01:36:00 2015 UTC,Because in real life if you get shot once or twice you are fucked pretty much. Not saying you wont survive but there are so many places you could get shot and die that its kind of hard to survive. For example in ARMA or even counter strike 2 or 3 shots to like anywhere on the body and you are dead. Of course it depends on the weapon and the range but seeing how in Rainbow Six Siege its mostly close quarters combat pretty much all the guns should kill with with about 2 or 3 hits.  And the wall thing its obvious that it could take longer to kill and more shots but chances are it would only be an extra bullet or two.
Rainbow6,3244a7,asdfpanda,1 point,Sat Apr 11 14:44:06 2015 UTC,"""Realistic, therefore is gud"" is not an argument anybody should be willing to accept for a comically short ttk. Getting killed in 2 or 3 shots drastically decreases the skill gap and skill cap at the same time. Any strategy involved in finding cover or returning fire is negated, as you are automatically instagibbed for merely being seen. Such a violently short ttk will only lead to frustration. Any skill involved in aiming for headshots is also mitigated, as the benefit is not worth it over body shots.  Wall banging is not a mechanism that will function fairly with low ttks, even if it is a couple more bullets longer. If one has the inhuman reaction time to break line of sight after being shot, they will simply be killed through a wall.  A lower time to kill is not the answer."
Rainbow6,3244a7,asdfpanda,1 point,Sat Apr 11 15:35:00 2015 UTC,But it is. If it takes less to kill someone it is better. Then make the rounds last longer and give people more time to set up. Boom its more tactical. If you dont want to be killed through a wall then just get a shield there or something. In real life if you broke line of sight and run behind a wall chances are if it was a decently thin wall you would be killed through it no matter what.
Rainbow6,3244a7,asdfpanda,1 point,Sat Apr 11 16:33:55 2015 UTC,"You state that in real life, if you were to break line of sight and run behind a wall you would be killed no matter what. Problem is, that is not fun. You're being punished for making the tactical decision of breaking los after having the reactionary capability to recognize that you're taking fire, and make a decision.  I've already stated that low ttks do not reward headshots enough, makes gunplay bland due to instagibbing, exacerbates the effectiveness of the wall bang mechanic. It also removes many decision making elements from the game.  More set-up time is helpful. It doesn't solve all the issues listed above, however."

Ravenshield commonly ran with a dark solid blue on one team and tan camo on the other. Allow defense to move the hostage slowly around Add a map that you can pull up with friendly locations and waypoints add fluid stance so we can see through holes in the wall at the correct height Allow us to set up our own load out with everything available and have presets we make ourselves.  I hate when I can't play what I want because someone else clicked faster. Barbed wire should affect defenders same as attackers Defenders should be able to go outside without being magically visible to the other team Get rid of kill cam or at least delay it until end of round so you can't communicate where enemy was   There is more but lets start there..."

(also jammers are retarded.)   If a Tango wanders too far AI snipers take him out. Afterall it's a besieged area encircled by eg. police. Please just give us fully customizeable loadouts, and character customization (limited colors and gear according to team).

That's my rationale anyways."
Rainbow6,321gup,ToKeYMonsTeR,4,Thu Apr 9 23:11:09 2015 UTC,"I mean, if anything you'd have snipers covering the area. Any terrorist who leaves the house should be killed off after a few seconds."

They are too far into development to change the core of the game, they'd have to scrap it all and restart like they did with patriots. That would be a good idea to scrap it all, but I doubt they're willing to do that a second time. They have no interest in going back to the roots. These devs are too into their ""competitive"" design of the game. All they've created is a fundamentally broken casual experience. The barricades, barbed wire, shield stand things.... all of that just needs to be removed completely. Remove all of the blatantly obvious features they created to force artificial competition and forced teamplay and forced wannabe ""tactics"". These devs can't see past their own flawed ideas. When people are creating something it is important that they focus on their goal and keep at it, but not when it's something that already has an identity. What this should be is a new IP. The best we can hope for is that they remove the rainbow six name and just call it something like ""Siege: Operators"" or something."
Rainbow6,321gup,h4kkz,3,Fri Apr 10 05:37:41 2015 UTC,"Sadly I have to agree with you. I wouldn't be so disappointed if they just stopped tarnishing the Rainbow Six name with all this crap.

Which is the foundation of what we might play with the finish game, yet the foundation is not right (and that's not a good sign).   Which means that all this feedback we are giving is or might be falling on clogged ears...  Never the less, make the matches longer in time or slow down the clock so matches don't end so fast because R6 is not a particularly fast paced game, unless you're talking about when you engage in combat which should be the case. Also get rid of the ability to see you're team through walls magically for no reason, its distracting as fuck and not needed an feels like a handicap. Bottom line I don't want to play a R6 inspired CSGO match. I want to play R6 not another FPS shooter."

I will go on a limb and say the gunsounds will be adjusted from the tinny sound to something more 'umph' and that is a easy fix to do. Maybe it was done for the alpha to concentrate on mechanics and code.  I honestly hope the Devteam and CMs look at what we are asking for and give feedback to us (which they usually do)"

Rainbow6,321gup,loyaltrekie,1 point,Fri Apr 10 12:29:39 2015 UTC,I'm agree with your list except about the sprinting.  The sprinting option is not even an issue. It's realistic. BUT If fast movements are more effective than the slow movements... then it becomes a real problem.  Run fast and die quickly is logical and realistic.  You should be able to run but it should be unlogical to use it.Except for some occasion.

Most people don't pickup on this and just barricade all the windows.   Some may say it's spawn killing, but I don't think so.

I would like to see more cover coming up to the house and more random drone popping that is independent of entry point.  It just begs the question, is 3 minutes truly enough now? I know a lot of people don't think so but even more so now. If I were to have a scrim I would have at least 2-3 people try to kill them at the spawn. If you're sitting there right off the start being dumped on you can't really move around so 3 minutes isn't going to be enough time.  For the plane map, I am baffled by this, it's so hard to get out of spawn on the plane map. I also really wish you could rappel from the top of the plane down so you could shoot through the windows."

Don't give it to the public because if it's shit (which currently it is) will drive people away. Thanks for giving us a game to test where it's barely playable in both network and gameplay sense.

Rainbow6,322b6n,GTKnight,1 point,Fri Apr 10 06:51:10 2015 UTC,"Alphas and betas are a joke now - and similar to what you said - a PR hype engine.   They are not going to change anything other than some weapon damages, health totals, etc. - it will only be little things like that. There will be no complete overall, even if they see thousands of gamers complaining about the direction they are taking.  If any of you were in the Evolve Alpha - how much changed afterword? Nerf the Kraken, nerf this gun, hunters jump a little higher, etc. They didn't fix the matchmaking, they didn't revamp the DLC/Monsters/Hunter packs. All that shit is set in stone. The only changes we will see are tweaks. It was all marketing and it backfired - hard. So will this alpha.  I would love to see them back up and say 'Wait a minute - this is not what people want."" and delay the game a few months (or even a year) to make it worth while. However, the best we can hope for is a quality 'hardcore mode'. But I truly believe this will just be slapped on and half-assed."

Rainbow6,322b6n,nor3g,1 point,Fri Apr 10 00:41:55 2015 UTC,dont you think it's extremely unlikely they'll do any major changes? iirc the general idea of gameplay gets decided before alpha (proof of concept).
Rainbow6,322b6n,trineroks,5,Fri Apr 10 15:57:57 2015 UTC,"The classic Rainbow Six titles (first 3) tread the line of realism while not outright going into simulator territory. And like OP stated, more emphasis on realism forces more emphasis on tactical play.  Arma is an extreme example of this.  Yes, if you played with pubbies in the old Rainbow Six games they sometimes would still go off on their own with no coordination. You can't 100% force random people to play together as an organized team. But the old Rainbow Six games made that kind of solo playstyle all the more harder to pull off.  The problem arises when you introduce and empower the player with all these unrealistic crutches."
Rainbow6,322b6n,bnelson1,7,Fri Apr 10 04:11:24 2015 UTC,"'more tactical' and 'more realistic' go hand in hand for the most part. this game is neither.  a run and gun, laser-beam accurate shooter is about as far from tactical and/or realism as you can get."
Rainbow6,322b6n,time4mzl,1 point,Fri Apr 10 06:46:17 2015 UTC,"Gave it another go tonight and after spending more time in loading screens than playing I think I am done for the alpha. Only way to exit the game that works for me is alt-f4, then I have to go kill the process as the music is still playing.    The game may play more smoothly if all team members using comms are actually talking about the match and not what they are watching on Netflix.  So you get your group of friends together and spend 3 minutes playing the game alternated with 5 minutes of load screen.  Even getting that load time down to <1 minute you still have to deal with 3 minute matches.   I'll give a beta a go but it would have to be drastically different to get me to actually buy this game at launch."

They should of at least given us a single player 'playroom' - just throw you in the map to shoot stuff.  I had the same thing happen when I tried to exit the game. I had to end the process and could hear the music still.  I will give it another go today but in all honesty - the alpha turned me off. This will be yet another Ubisoft disaster.

Rainbow6,322b6n,Incursus,0,Fri Apr 10 16:53:42 2015 UTC,here here I agree!
Rainbow6,322b6n,Fyrebat,-8,Fri Apr 10 02:11:35 2015 UTC,"I don't understand, what's your issue with the game? I find it to lean quite a lot to the realistic, tactical side other than the unlimited wooden barricades, hitmarkers, and kill feed. You can shoot through walls, and even ceilings/floors to expose your enemy/work around their defenses.  Running and gunning doesn't work as defenders have barricades to stop that, and pre-aim to mow you down. Attackers can't be run and gunned from defenders either, as they usually are also aiming at possible contact points.  How about damage then? You see those death recaps? A headshot is an instant kill (120 dmg), shotgun close range to the chest/head? dead. Then what about SMGs? Their accuracy is lacking, and their individual bullets are weak and are stopped by armor as well. There's nothing unrealistic about this, other than the hitmarkers and kill confirmations.  You're just basing your opinion on an Alpha build, with no factual evidence to back it up.  Also, most of the problems related to gunfights are netcode anyway, but the actual base values are realistic, although it goes to the casual side. Heck, even in ArmA 3 it takes around 3 to 4 bullets (that are 6.5mm) to the chest of a soldier wearing a plate carrier to really kill him, and that game is a SIMULATOR. The illusion of taking 20 bullets to kill someone or whatever is because some of them missed, due to player error or because of netcode. Too much ammo? Really? That's actually how much ammo people carry in operations in the real world. In fact, your plate carrier has like what? 5-6 magazine pouches? Why would you leave 2-3 empty? There is no aspect of this game that is considered ""not tactical"", other than easily patched out things like hitmarker and showing that person x killed person y. Maybe the outlines as well.  The only complaint I have about this game is the netcode, world models sticking through objects, and the fact that the operators have no coherent style, despite the banner being a team of Rainbow 6 in dark blue, GIGN style uniform, vs a team of (what is it? Terrorists?) in tan, with a mercenary look to them, but still uniformed up to fight in a war zone. Therefore, to really remove that x-ray (that is pretty casual), they need to make the uniform of the teams coherent, and the color clearly showing their allegiance (rogue spear tan, raven shield dark blue)  tl;dr if you state an opinion, back it up with evidence which supports your opinion, otherwise you look like an idiot.  Edit: Forgot to mention unlimited revive as long as doesn't take fatal damage is also pretty unrealistic, should be 50 * percentage of blood left, and 1 revive max. That I would think would make it still pretty cool, and also making sure you confirm your kills or else they might come back and kill you, but also limiting the whole revive, die, revive, die sort of thing if the enemies can't finish you off. Would like to see drag too."
Rainbow6,322b6n,Fyrebat,4,Fri Apr 10 05:58:11 2015 UTC,"Running and gunning doesn't work   hahaha  oh wait you're serious let me laugh harder..  HAHAHAHAHAH  No but really, running and gunning absolutely wrecks right now. running through a chokepoint is stupid, yes.. but outside of a choke point running and gunning wins every time. Espicially if you're strafing like a crack addict.   How about damage then? You see those death recaps? A headshot is an instant kill (120 dmg), shotgun close range to the chest/head? dead. Then what about SMGs? Their accuracy is lacking, and their individual bullets are weak and are stopped by armor as well. There's nothing unrealistic about this, other than the hitmarkers and kill confirmations.   Uhh well considering that these guns are like pinpoint accurate when ADS that's not realistic at all.. Most of the problem is the shitty netcode and hit detection though, i will agree with that.   There is no aspect of this game that is considered ""not tactical"", other than easily patched out things like hitmarker and showing that person x killed person y. Maybe the outlines as well.   HAHAHAHAHA dude tell me 1 person that can sprint and strafe THAT FUCKING FAST and hold THAT MUCH ACCURACY and i'll literally let you buttfuck me with a M16.  I say that because I know you can't..    You're just basing your opinion on an Alpha build, with no factual evidence to back it up.   Dude.. as someone that's been shooting for 16 years I know how guns work. I've shot basically every caliber that I can legally get my hands on, and full auto multiple times (as a rental.) It's pretty far from it. Good luck being that accurate with a gun on full auto, even if it is 9mm.. New rifles (like the SID .300WM or the Vector) are able to do that- vector because of how the bolt is designed to go down and back instead of just back, this taking away some vertical recoil.. but those aren't in this game. Unless your gun is on a bipod or resting on something it's not going to shoot that accurately.   As i've  also posted.. this game is FAR from realistic in the uniform department as well....   there is LOTS to this game that is just NOT right at all. Not tactical. Having a hit to literally ANYWHERE but where the plates are in a plate carrier (stomach  and a little chest, the soft part of your sides below your ribs on some, and your back) should disable that part of the body because let's face it you're not going to be using your arm too well after you took a round to it. 4-5 rounds in any of those places killing you is fine. since that's what Level IV plates can protect.. however it's 4-5 rounds ANYWHERE. That's not really how it works."

As for Operators, imho, we need way more variation within those classes, like a deck system. Also, no one should be stuck with a class/gun that they don't want.  I'll add something mentioned on the Alpha Testers forum that needs attention: The voting for Entry Points should take place AFTER the recon/drones stage, otherwise what's the point of the recon if you've already committed to an entry point?"

However they really need to do something to differentiate the two sides, namely uniform colors.  At least that is how it was done in previous R6 games.    As an R6 game I am not completely sold on it.  I can see there is some potential and depending on what happens with the feedback from now until release will say a lot.  I want to give it another day or two of playing before putting together all of my feedback."
Rainbow6,321ayw,tyhopkin,1 point,Thu Apr 9 21:04:38 2015 UTC,"The problem I have with Blue vs Blue in this game is unique to Siege specifically:   In theory I have no problem with BvB, but it seems COMPLETELY unbelievable that it would happen in this game's setting.

Keep elements of the tactical shooter intact (think 1/Rogue Spear/Raven Shield/SWAT 3/SWAT 4) but build on top of that.  But I keep having this nagging feeling that Ubisoft just wants to try and grab the console FPS market by keeping Siege extremely arcade-y with a few tactical gimmicks (non-regenerating health, rappelling, and police theme).  What a day we live in, when there's people who actually believe non-regenerating health is hardcore nowadays."

I think players have a little too much health and/or damage needs a buff - especially shotgun.  I suppose they could make this more tactical with a hardcore mode, which I'm sure they would."

Rainbow6,320iuh,Gamers_Alibi,11,Thu Apr 9 16:33:13 2015 UTC,"Doors are great because you can quietly open and close them.  There is no way to stay silent while bashing or blowing up a barricade.  You could also partially and fluidly open and close them in Ravenshield, making for some great crack door - frag - close door incidents.  Of course, since they want you making lots of noise to speed up this Run N Gun game, they won't let us have doors back anytime soon."
Rainbow6,320iuh,Pest_AWC,3,Thu Apr 9 18:21:10 2015 UTC,"you got it Pest! They are too in love with their barricade system. It's like criticizing a child's drawing for going outside the lines, they don't want to hear it. It's theirs and they made it and if you don't like our barricade system better than doors, too bad. Also it would mean players would maybe play a little more cautiously and we can't have that because we have to keep you racing the clock so that guy who got killed 90 seconds in only has to wait another 90 seconds to play again because they think we all have the attention spans of a 4th grader. I'm not buying that ""causes lag"" excuse either, then you need to do some serious code optimization if a half dozen doors make your game too laggy!"
Rainbow6,320iuh,iceycat,2,Thu Apr 9 21:57:56 2015 UTC,Vegas had a similar problem with going overboard with its horrible magical 3rd person cheat view.  They were so proud of it and the character customization that they didn't care that the teams no longer looked like teams and Rainbow suddenly became a rag tag gang of randomly colored mercenaries.  Now we have Siege being so proud of barricades they mistakenly think it's better to leave out working doors.  I'm betting the next game they slap R6 on will have magical teleporters they are proud of.
Rainbow6,320iuh,Pest_AWC,6,Fri Apr 10 02:15:05 2015 UTC,I feel like doors would work a lot better because right now people are just tearing down each others barricades and building it back up. Defenders should be able to lock and reinforce a door to keep in line with the whole barricading gameplay.
Rainbow6,320iuh,Strikerrr0,5,Thu Apr 9 19:25:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, giving defenders the ability to unlock and lock doors would be nice. Then attackers can try to open, then breach if locked. Better than the annoying tear down of your own barricades."
Rainbow6,320iuh,idlehand,5,Thu Apr 9 21:08:09 2015 UTC,"Why not barricade behind a door? Secret re-enforcement.   If you were holed up in the hostage room you could open the door, peek outside, then close the door - right now if you want to look outside you have to break the barricade and now CTs can see into the hostage room.  CTs could close doors behind them as they went, keep themselves slightly safer from being flanked.  CT could stack both sides of the door before entry - can't do that now unless the T barricaded it for you.  Having to go through doors would make every room a potential fatal entry, it would help slow the game down and force good tactical thinking."
Rainbow6,320iuh,Brethon,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:34:07 2015 UTC,"Having to go through doors would make every room a potential fatal entry   Knowing where the hostage is would eliminate the need to open certain doors, the rest could be breached or avoided by going through a window or breaching an exterior wall."
Rainbow6,320iuh,mau5eum,2,Thu Apr 9 18:51:10 2015 UTC,"Unless a sneaky terrorist is hiding in the room, waiting for you to go past and comes out behind you. That's part of why having them makes every decision more important - go straight for hostage and possibly leave bad guys behind you, or go methodical and check every corner?  Also, do exterior walls breach for you? They don't for anyone I've seen play. I'll try tonight when I get to play, but I haven't seen it work yet."
Rainbow6,320iuh,Brethon,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:55:38 2015 UTC,"Unless a sneaky terrorist is hiding in the room, waiting for you to go past and comes out behind you. That's part of why having them makes every decision more important - go straight for hostage and possibly leave bad guys behind you   That's already happening without doors.  I'm fine with them adding doors, I just don't see the point due to breaching, destruction and fortification.  If you fortify a door the attackers will either destroy it by shooting it, breach it or breach a wall instead."
Rainbow6,320iuh,mau5eum,4,Thu Apr 9 19:03:11 2015 UTC,"If doors are implemented, they should get locked if they are shut during the fortification stage. That way when you attempt to open it, you'd then need to breach it if it's locked. Would add a cool aspect of the team not needing to waste a barricade on it."
Rainbow6,320iuh,idlehand,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:55:36 2015 UTC,"Or they should be just randomly open/closed. And all the entrances are locked by default, which could get additional reinforcements + implementing (maybe?) a lockpick and a snake cam for all of this."
Rainbow6,320iuh,ExploTheOne,1 point,Thu Apr 9 22:30:39 2015 UTC,"I think lockpicking would be too slow and dangerous, but could work. I like the idea of random open/close upon level load. As soon as defenders shut the open doors, they default to locked."
Rainbow6,320iuh,idlehand,1 point,Thu Apr 9 22:40:03 2015 UTC,Why pick a lock when you can use a breaching charge.
Rainbow6,320iuh,mau5eum,1 point,Thu Apr 9 22:55:08 2015 UTC,"I like that idea.  Maybe give the defenders an operative that can jam a limited number of door locks.  Having said that, I image Ubisoft would take the existing fortification process and apply it to closed doors."
Rainbow6,320iuh,mau5eum,2,Thu Apr 9 19:25:47 2015 UTC,"While I understand they want to encourage defenders to build defenses rather than relying on a closed room to pack into, that just seems like a failure in design and a quick workaround rather than a solution people want."
Rainbow6,320iuh,trineroks,2,Thu Apr 9 22:41:45 2015 UTC,"Doors would make for better tactical play. In addition to this...  Currently players are just planting and blowing up breaching charges like maniacs. The number of wall/floor charges should be extremely limited, like 2 for the entire team in each round. Instead, reintroduce and have more door breaching charges (explosive charges that can only work on doors). That would give players interesting options - move through the door, or use 1 of their 2 wall/floor charges to make another opening."
Rainbow6,320iuh,mau5eum,2,Thu Apr 9 23:49:46 2015 UTC,"Being able to breach walls and floors makes doors irrelevant to an attacker, and being able to bust holes in walls makes them irrelevant to defenders.  I loved the way doors worked in previous Rainbow Six titles, regardless of the issues associated with them, but fortification, breaching and destruction makes them redundant."
Rainbow6,320iuh,mau5eum,3,Thu Apr 9 16:41:38 2015 UTC,So we should actually limit the amount of breaches and defenders we can put up
Rainbow6,320iuh,mau5eum,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:46:48 2015 UTC,"Well breaches are already, somewhat, limited, though I think the number carried could be lowered by one.  As for fortifications, only the wooden type is unlimited, and it's restricted to windows and doorways."
Rainbow6,320iuh,mau5eum,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:53:28 2015 UTC,Still think if wooden ones were limited it would make it better because the defender would have to decide which ones would need more defending
Rainbow6,320iuh,xSnakeDoctor,0,Thu Apr 9 17:15:42 2015 UTC,Limiting the wooden fortification would mean that decision was made for them.
Rainbow6,322cww,Gamers_Alibi,1 point,Fri Apr 10 00:42:14 2015 UTC,"Sledgehammer is useful, as the defenders can see you through your feet, if you're planting a breach charge, it also removes the huge setup from planting a charge, and the large explosion noise that follows a breach charge. Shooting down barricades just give away your position, something you usually don't want to do (also castle ones take A LOT of bullets to break down), with sledgehammer, press 4 and you instantly take down that barricade without giving much time for the enemy to react, taking them by surprise with your teammates. Also did I mention that they work, even if jammers are on the otherside of the wall? Albeit, the huge explosion surprise and the larger hole in the wall is not there, but instead you got a quieter surprise that works despite jammers being deployed (which is always laid where walls are not reinforced, or next to castle barricades)"
Rainbow6,322cww,siegewolf,1 point,Fri Apr 10 03:11:47 2015 UTC,I understand its use full not saying the sledgehammer isn't useful but with the way the current playstyle is it really does defile its purpose

You have a better chance of winning if you're playing tactical in Insurgency.   Everyone just rush the points   They rush the points at the start in order to gain map control. After that it's not the case unless they're cod players.   half the round is you running to the point   That's because you're dying a lot.

If the number of charges is too limited, it makes defending too easy and tilts the balance.  I'm not at all saying that you are wrong, but rather that I wonder if this is a symptom of Alpha access and people not really having had enough time to learn the map and how to best use their devices, yet.

While Siege has some fun moments for me, it's trying too hard to be too many different games and overall I don't get as much enjoyment as I would if I just played COD, or BF, or R6.  So this game may do ok for awhile, but it just doesn't have its own identity to keep players happy for long."
Rainbow6,322mwb,Pest_AWC,1 point,Fri Apr 10 02:20:41 2015 UTC,"Overall, very solid game, enjoyable to play, fun to come up with new tricks, massive replayability. However, hindered tremendously by the glaring netcode problems and lack of vertical destruction, and no fullscale horizontal destruction (objects behind a wall prevent it from blowing it up... really? Why not just allow the object to be destroyed as well?)  Destruction is in a good place, but more areas need to be able to be destroyed fully (specifically vertically), and walls with objects behind them should also be able to be destroyed by allowing that object to be fractured as well, and even if it can't, still allow it as it still improves immersion, and doesn't completely make you feel like the charge was useless when nothing happened.  Damage values and ammo are fine, although it's ""a lot of ammo"", it's quite realistic, and damage values are quite fine as well. (1 headshot is a kill, full buckshot or 2 is a guaranteed kill, 3 to 5 shots with a SMG is a down, 4 rifle shots is a down/kill)  Overall game mechanics and design are well thought out and fun. Defenders are not completely helpless in areas that do not enable them to barricade, while they are also at the same time not invulnerable in areas where they can barricade and fortify.  Attackers are able to overcome the obstacles defenders put with teamwork and their own counters (EMP counters Jammer, Sledgehammer counters jammer for normal walls, as well as castle barricades, Exothermic counters Reinforced Wall), while they are not completely overwhelming (teamwork required to breach a reinforced wall with a jammer, and also the requirement that the EMP and exothermic guy are alive). Shields aren't completely broken as they are countered by explosives and does not cover the entire body.  Sprinting is in a nice place, enabling you to move around the map faster, but also impractical in a firefight.  Movement is overall at a good place for crouching and standing, however crawling right now is a bit too fast.  The issues I find are really just: Hitmarkers - Spray and pray is really dumb...  Kill Feed - Kill confirm visually, not game telling you it is now x vs y, removes tension, enables zerg rush strategy when attackers are 3 vs 1, removes a lot of tactical play when that unknown factor is gone.  Destruction is mediocore (in terms of how much there is) - Not enough true vertical destruction (holes you can make in the floor are outlined with a square), horizontal destruction could be increased by allowing walls with objects behind to be also destroyed, with the objects behind that destroyed too.  Visually incoherent - My team is made up of SAS, GIGN, SWAT all with their own uniforms and colors, the heck? Enemy team is also wearing the same uniforms, hard to tell visually if teammate or not unless I see their name above their head, or red text  Looking at enemies reveal their name to you - I look at hole through wall, see red text, unload mag, killmarkers, now 5vs4, amazing. I didn't even notice them until I saw that name.  X-ray vision of teammates - Removes so much tension and communication, now I know if that guy running around the corner is a teammate or not, and he doesn't need to speak to know that im his teammate too!  Netcode - Need I say more?  Model clipping - World models clip through objects, really removes that tension and stealth when your enemy can see you through that shield/barricade as well as rendering it useless since your legs stick through and you get executed."

Rainbow6,31yp0i,Unn4,2,Thu Apr 9 04:41:24 2015 UTC,I would like to see this implementation: it worked well in SWAT 4 and feels like it would definitely blend into the elements in Siege.
Rainbow6,31yp0i,Stab_City,1 point,Thu Apr 9 06:19:43 2015 UTC,"I actually disagree with this assertion. I found that the POV cameras were beyond useless in SWAT 4. They limited your vision-- or more importantly, jockeyed for your attention-- and regardless were too small to help you notice something that your teammate wouldn't have seen anyways.  They also sucked at communicating where other players were standing; it simply took too long to gather enough visual cues to get an idea of where they were in relation to you.  To summarize: they were slow at conveying information and bad at locating your allies in a game that is both fast paced and has lethal consequences for friendly fire..."
Rainbow6,31yp0i,nomoneypenny,2,Thu Apr 9 07:46:23 2015 UTC,The purpose of tactical shooter is not making it for player too easy. You have to adapt and have some doubt when you shoot. With xray it becomes so easy that you can always preshoot everywhere except your mates...

Rainbow6,31yp0i,zirocasteri,2,Thu Apr 9 09:20:08 2015 UTC,This is a very good idea. I too think this would work great for Siege too. Very good thinking!
Rainbow6,31yp0i,trineroks,2,Thu Apr 9 07:23:53 2015 UTC,"The only issue I see with this would be...  How would you toggle through teammate cams? In SWAT 4 you had 2 members per fireteam, and you could toggle between the two using Insert (Red team) and Home (Blue team).  Maybe they could reintroduce the fullscreen map that left you vulnerable as you were reading it, but shows real time positioning of teammates on a 2D map."

Rainbow6,3210ke,steveyohmey,1 point,Thu Apr 9 18:38:23 2015 UTC,It has to do with balance. I think if everything could be blown up it would be unbalanced for the defenders. The reason I think this is because in the E3 demo all the windows in the kids room could be breached. But in the alpha only 3 are. The other once are blocked  (this could be just for alpha)
Rainbow6,3210ke,ZEPPIX,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:00:19 2015 UTC,"I think if they wanted, they could do it, but they limit it on purpose to make sure the game is balanced.  If everything could be blown up, i don't think it would be that much more fun, it would probably lead to frustration, when you realise you have then nowhere to hide. and it's going to become a demolition game, not rainbow six. It also makes the whole thing more realistic, you have to take into account the materials/type of wall. You maybe don't know, but a LOT of though goes into level design."
Rainbow6,3210ke,sierra8,2,Thu Apr 9 19:02:40 2015 UTC,"But I would like them to get rid of the ""floor traps"" , with the big framing, something more intuitive and less of a ""BREACH HERE"" sign perhaps."

Rainbow6,3210ke,ZEPPIX,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:21:05 2015 UTC,definitely!
Rainbow6,3210ke,sierra8,1 point,Thu Apr 9 19:22:14 2015 UTC,"I think it could be balanced in other ways maybe... give the defenders more reinforcement materials? Give the attackers less c4? it would require the team to think more tactically about which walls they do blow up, rather than resorting to the only walls they CAN blow up...  In response to the materials point you made - thats all cool, but it should be obvious which ones are too strong to blow, and when they do get blown, SOME damage should be present, like a crater, or big black explosion mark or whatever.  1 wall that gets me in the alpha is the one with the TV on the plane. Every time i play I just think... ""well no worries thats the indestructible TV wall, il just barricade the other walls"".   I just think its more an illusion of freedom that doesn't measure up to its theory, as it is now. As soon as the players wise up to the ""good walls"" and the ""bad walls"" then it will become a case of running the optimum routine - block wall A, B and C, defend wall D. kind of vibe.... the freedom is just... really thin. Hence my point ""why shouldnt i just go play CS:GO?""   If the developers want a situation like CS i.e. players coining typical plays (thinking of dust 2 tactics here) and they want the players to master a set of 4 / 5 tactics, then I guess keep it as it is. But I was hoping for much more freedom based gameplay, where each game would have a drastically different set up and execution.   Hope this makes sense.... sorry if Im wishing too much :D"

Rainbow6,31xjbn,Sterling__Archer_,7,Thu Apr 9 01:05:57 2015 UTC,"I'd also like to point out that Dieter Weber is from GSG-9.   But there hasn't been any information released on Siege singleplayer yet, and you can somewhat justify the GIGN/GSG-9/FBI SWAT CTUs (since Rainbow members disguise as local law enforcement), but it makes no sense when you have a mish mash of GIGN/GSG-9/FBI SWAT in one map. It also doesn't help that each class has a distinct playermodel that really throws away the feel of an organized counter terror team and instead brings in a mercenaries type feel.   CTUs should be restricted to a map. The house mission takes place in the US? Have all Rainbow members be forced to use the FBI SWAT CTU. The plane mission takes place in France? Have all Rainbow members be forced to use the GIGN CTUs.   But I really feel there are a lot more pressing matters at hand, namely the gameplay not looking and feeling like a classic Rainbow Six game."
Rainbow6,31xjbn,GHOST-117,5,Wed Apr 8 23:26:38 2015 UTC,"I think all player models need to be updated to what they would ACTUALLY look like.  (come on, FBI SWAT and GSG-9 look just like a MARSOC operator, or Green beret, or SEAL in their plate carrier and BDUs.)   Even make the BDUs/Carriers black/blue. That would be okay. But PLEASE DEAR GOD use the IBH helmets for SWAT/GSG-9. (GIGN still uses the weird ass helmets with the huge face shield.) But make them all more uniform in their uniforms (heh.)  Make the Hostage takers visibly different as well.. Make them look like they're people that took hostages.. Like the people from the North Hollywood Shootout. Ski masks, with crudeish body armor (shit even give them modern armor, just give them like a skimask type deal.)  FBI//GIGN/SAS. vs FBI/GIGN/SAS.. I feel like it's just a clusterfuck of people thrown against eachother.  Also.. SAS is the brittish special forces.. if we were doing that it should be SEALs for the states, and idk about France..  I'm also really surprised that there isn't Russia's FSB Alpha Group on here either."

Rainbow6,31xjbn,capedcrusader93,1 point,Thu Apr 9 21:03:47 2015 UTC,"That's a good point, but it's hard to directly compare units from different countries.  GSG-9 is technically German law enforcement, but it's fairly unique in terms of stature and fame as far as law enforcement agencies go.  I think that a better comparison might be a CIA SAD/SOG team or military counter terrorism/intelligence forces like US Army ISA or Delta.  It's not a coincidence that Dieter is operating alongside former Army Rangers, paratroopers and a Navy SEAL."
Rainbow6,31xjbn,nomoneypenny,2,Thu Apr 9 21:03:01 2015 UTC,"I do agree with you that it is kind of missing the point of ""Rainbow"" if it's going to just go with a law enforcement vs outlaws.  I wonder though if this isn't just what they put together for the alpha."

Rainbow6,31xei0,Sacriel,5,Wed Apr 8 22:18:58 2015 UTC,"I hope this stuff gets fixed. Lots of people are saying 'its just the recap that is out of sync'. In this video you can clearly see my character 2 meters below the bullets, looking up at them and I die to them anyway.  I really enjoy the style of the game, it's a great concept and I really want it to do well. I hope we get some kind of official feedback on the crazy desync lots of player are seeing."
Rainbow6,31xei0,electr1cpanda,9,Wed Apr 8 22:20:13 2015 UTC,"We are investigating what happened here because indeed there is some strange behavior, like getting killed 3 seconds after it actually happened. However, the killcam on that video is also inaccurate. Only your enemy's position is correct in the replay.  Overall, the majority of these issues are due to the killcam problem (kill cam showing inaccurate replays), creating the perception of bad netcode. That's not to say we are dismissing all reports, we are aggressively looking into them, but it's worth noting.   This is what Closed Alpha is all about. This is a very early work in progress and having everyone in there playing is helping us identify and start working on these problems. Really appreciate your reports, and being involved here in the community."
Rainbow6,31xei0,electr1cpanda,7,Wed Apr 8 23:36:45 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you are investigating.  Right now I'm itching to play because I love the concept, I love the feature, I love most things about this game but the underlying net issues render the game unplayable for me and my viewer base.  It seems/feels like the server is recieving data from the clients are parsing it in very strange ways, it's like what I do, is sent to other clients 2 seconds later, and they basically see a version of me from the past. If you look in the video, that guy is clearly firing an entire mag into an emtpy window, I have no doubt I was clearly visible on his screen.  I think the problem lies somewhere in the way the server sends/receives player coordinates, they are definitely out of sync with aiming/firing status updates. I have several examples of where I die before someone even turns a corner, and on my death cam, they are pre-firing before they turn the corner, as if my client has a delayed version of their position, but an up to date version of their aiming/firing status or vice versa.  This seems to be what leads to the odd deathcams, player position is 2 seconds behind playing aiming angles/firing status etc, so they seem to be shooting in the ""wrong place"" but if they were 1 meter to the side their aiming would be spot on, the co-ords are out of sync.  This also explains why people often appear to face one direction, moving away from you and then in literally 1 frame they have done a 180 degree turn and are shooting you, you die before they even face you) - aiming angle and player coords are desynced so people face the wrong way or move the wrong way making it impossible to react to what you see."
Rainbow6,31xei0,Txontirea,4,Thu Apr 9 01:30:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the additional info. I don't have anything more to share at this point but the online team is reviewing your footage and what you're experiencing (and related issues for other players).   With an online PvP focus, it's obviously critical that we are tight in these areas by launch, which is what the Closed Alpha helps us do. Thanks for your playing a role in that, and your patience while streaming. With all the streams up it's easy to forget that this is still an early WIP and this week is all about testing and breaking everything we can."

Rainbow6,31xei0,Txontirea,3,Wed Apr 8 22:46:50 2015 UTC,"I've not had any non-issue with massive desync etc. yet. Don't know how many times I've been killed from a window without being able to see the guy that kills me. Sometimes, I'll see their player model twitch into view for about a half second and disappear, and I might be dead 5 seconds later without ever having seen them peek out again."
Rainbow6,31xei0,electr1cpanda,1 point,Wed Apr 8 22:57:33 2015 UTC,Yep same here also did you notice many players looking like they were skiing in the replays? Nothing new just saying)

I can't even take a moment to really wrap my head around the game, dig into the features and try to evaluate the current product for feedback purposes, because the damn netcode is making me want to kick something cute and fluffy.  How can it be so bad with such small maps and low amount of players?"
Rainbow6,31xei0,electr1cpanda,0,Wed Apr 8 23:00:35 2015 UTC,Probably because they've been exclusively testing it in-house on LAN. :/

Screw drop shotting and strafe dancing, those should not be viable tactics, accuracy should go to crap when strafing back and forth and movement should be slower too.

Rainbow6,31wzop,GHOST-117,3,Thu Apr 9 01:42:12 2015 UTC,"I haven't found any button that selects fire rate yet.  There is (right now) one semi-automatic rifle:  417 DMR - I think it's for the french operators.  It's absolutely useless.. unless you try to DMR. They've done an .. alright job at having a DMR role so far. on the house map at least. There are places where you can climb up outside but they're pretty limited in view. (1-2 windows max.)  Also, semi auto is just raped by the current style. Run n gun spray and pray is what wins right now. Spray and pray is SO strong. You can spray through walls and get kills.. it's really annoying."
Rainbow6,31wzop,GHOST-117,2,Thu Apr 9 02:03:33 2015 UTC,"I've played the Plane map and i agree, semi-auto wouldn't fare well with the current mechanics... My suggestion to the Devs (same as a bunch of others here and the Alpha testers forum:) use the gun mechanics of Insurgency as a benchmark (and also add singlefire option for each gun plzz)."
Rainbow6,31wzop,nomoneypenny,1 point,Thu Apr 9 11:09:54 2015 UTC,"Pistols and SMGs that fire the same calibre ammunition hit for different damage in video games to give them distinct roles. It's a bad idea to design a rule set where one piece of equipment is completely superseded by another one, because that leads to the degenerate case where the lesser equipment is never used. Ideally, a game should be about making a series of interesting choices.  That's why many games have pistols that do more damage per shot than automatic SMGs, or are inexplicably more accurate while moving. Other ways to balance include:   Faster movement speed compared to other weapons Capability to add a silencer Unique ability to score bonus damage (e.g. with a headshot) Plentiful or unlimited reserve ammunition Reduced cost compared to alternatives, if your game has a money management mechanic   The only thing that people universally expect from pistols in games is that they be semi-automatic and require more frequent reloads."
Rainbow6,31wzop,spacecowboyj,1 point,Thu Apr 9 01:47:27 2015 UTC,"Ah, that is very true. For a moment there I thought less about balance and more about realism. As someone that's been shooting for 17 years it's weird to see pistols always having lower damage as their fully auto caliber counterparts."
Rainbow6,31wzop,Carreau13,1 point,Thu Apr 9 02:04:09 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with you on the movement part.  It is way too fast to be tactical.  I've had several instances where I or a teammate were ""downed"" as opposed to straight up killed, and most everyone was moving too fast to even notice it.    My thoughts on the sprinting is this: if it's going to be an option to do in the game, it needs to come with a pretty hefty penalty for it.  What I would like to see happen since (let's not fool ourselves here) it's going to be a mechanic is that you sling your weapon, and you undertake some sort of heavy breathing animation for a duration which severely hurts your aim."

Rainbow6,31zvko,-Olek,-3,Thu Apr 9 15:30:21 2015 UTC,Absolutely 100%. But then you should not play a 5v5 game. It's not nice to the people on your teammates when you're just dead weight. A casual game like cod of Bf would be better since it doesn't matter who wins or looses. There you can just do what you want. So that's perfect. :)

Rainbow6,31zvko,-Olek,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:28:26 2015 UTC,"So what ? Every player should play with a microphone, using Teamspeak or Mumble, using a Razer mouse, a Speedlink keyboard, with a not-wireless-headphone-because-otherwise-theres-audio-lag, just because... the team needs it ?  I play with keyboard + mouse. I'd never play a FPS with a gamepad. But if anyone wants to play that way, I don't care. I just play for fun. Sure, the teamplay would suffer a little bit, but seriously, how important is that on a public server anyway (will there be private servers ? That's an other problem). In the worst case, the guy would probably get kicked. If he really unbalances the game. But if he wanna play that way, let him play that way."

I won't say more (since english is not my native language, I don't wanna take the risk to misinterpret the meaning or even the ""tone"" of what you're saying next), I'll just say : some people with KBM still suck and that can hurt the team. So what ? Really, what's the problem with that ? They'll probably play more, learn, improve themselves, and if they use to play with a gamepad, they'll maybe try the KBM. Or not, they'll still suck.

Rainbow6,31zq1w,Arvenor,3,Thu Apr 9 14:36:04 2015 UTC,"Those quotes are out of context. He said there wouldn't be massive changes, meaning things that would take significant amounts of development time.  Don't expect the procedural destruction to be overhauled or a new lighting system to be implemented. Adjusting things within the gameplay? Much more reasonable to assume they can be changed.  I've seen that quote misrepresented to mean that there will be no real change, and I find that kind of pessimistic interpretation somewhat disheartening.  Our biggest concern right now is refining the feedback we're getting from players into clear, actionable items that will help to shape the game into the best possible experience that it can be."
Rainbow6,31zq1w,ubichem,2,Thu Apr 9 15:19:03 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't trust anything that's not confirmed by the development team.

Rainbow6,31zpe2,JJtG,1 point,Thu Apr 9 12:37:59 2015 UTC,"I quite enjoy checking my stats between rounds personally. Also like switching roles, if we're playing a 9 round match, I think I'd grow tired of 1 role."
Rainbow6,31zpe2,duckandweave,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:24:13 2015 UTC,Well the main complaint is that this screen is completely separated from the actual game. Stats and class changes could be shown as an overlay that does not completely take you out of the game.
Rainbow6,31zpe2,forzaitalia458,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:32:15 2015 UTC,yea i would be pissed being stuck in the same role the whole map. variety is the spice of life.
Rainbow6,31zpe2,forzaitalia458,1 point,Thu Apr 9 14:46:52 2015 UTC,"while i don't like going to the lobby necessarily either, because it does slow it down. HOWEVER, this is a big however, I believe its more of a technical issue. every round the map is getting destroyed. hence the need to reload the map every round. so i would think it's impossible to take away the lobby between rounds."

Rainbow6,31xo9x,Batt1ecat,3,Wed Apr 8 23:33:05 2015 UTC,"I had to share this highlight from my stream yesterday with you guys, I know this game has quite a few issues and is far from finished but I cannot help but see the potential this game has after this round!"
Rainbow6,31xo9x,Txontirea,6,Wed Apr 8 23:34:00 2015 UTC,"Again, it's not a hostage rescue (Extraction), it was you eliminating the entire team around the hostage.  I wish the hostage was more important, right now it just feels like a marker for the firefight which decides the round."
Rainbow6,31xo9x,Txontirea,2,Thu Apr 9 00:05:09 2015 UTC,"I can see your point, I wish they could use the hostage as a human shield honestly....the game has a lot of potential though!"
Rainbow6,31xo9x,Shensmobile,1 point,Thu Apr 9 00:15:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what the solution is to the hostage being useless in every way except as cover for the Ts. I've played the game for like 10 hours now, and still havent gotten one round won or lost from an extraction."
Rainbow6,31xo9x,IHaveNoFiya,1 point,Thu Apr 9 00:20:39 2015 UTC,"Here's an idea.   Terrorists can either move the hostage to an ""escape"" zone, or they can defend the hostage to prevent extraction. If they win via eliminating the entire other team, then they get 1 point. If they make it to the escape, they get 1 point per player that also makes it to the escape zone. Escape zone is randomly chosen based on the selected starting location.  Counter terrorists have to rescue the hostage. Hostage rescue is worth the same number of points as terrorists that have been eliminated, eliminating the other team is only worth 1.  Just an idea that ran through my head."
Rainbow6,31xo9x,Txontirea,1 point,Thu Apr 9 06:56:08 2015 UTC,I remember them moving the hostage in the E3 footage. Maybe it's a future update they plan to add.
Rainbow6,31xo9x,IHaveNoFiya,2,Thu Apr 9 15:07:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just me but think of any real life situation, how often would hostages really be saved without having to first take out the opposition? I get your point I really do, but I think people are ignoring the obvious here. Yea it's movies, real life, this is a game blah blah blah, but how often would a hostage, especially a single hostage really be saved without the opposition needing to be taken out first?   In almost any situation the hostage would be used as a human shield for the enemies. The enemies will most likely be around the hostage to ensure they are not taken; therefore, removing their only leverage. That all being said if they wanted to make the hostage a more viable option I think having two hostages in two separate locations would solve this issue. Hardline's rescue mode has two hostages in two locations and I've seen a lot of extractions while playing."
Rainbow6,31xo9x,Txontirea,2,Thu Apr 9 00:48:45 2015 UTC,"Sorry to use the thing you already listed, but this is a game. The hostage is the objective, and when they showed this at E3, alot of the tension and tactics were entirely based around the hostage. That was a lot of the draw for me and other players. If you look at how the game is played now, it's just about breaching the room the hostage is in, and killing the Terrorists in a 5x5 box. Just nowhere near as fun as what was originally shown."
Rainbow6,31xo9x,IHaveNoFiya,1 point,Thu Apr 9 00:53:36 2015 UTC,Like I said I get it. I think a lot of us got way too hyped because of the scripted E3 gameplay we saw which was absolutely amazing. Don't know if you saw my addition before replying but Hardline does two hostages in their Rescue mode and I have seen quite a few extractions. I think that would be an easy fix.
Rainbow6,31xo9x,iceycat,2,Thu Apr 9 00:55:31 2015 UTC,"I dunno, with the map size and the CQB focus that Siege is clearly entirely designed around, Im not sure it would fit. But it would do what we're intending, forcing the terrorists to spread out to protect the objectives. (This is, of course, if you're talking like the hostage mode works in CS, where if one is extracted, CT's win)"
Rainbow6,31xo9x,ClassyAnarchy,1 point,Thu Apr 9 01:01:13 2015 UTC,Yea that's how it works in Hardline. Kind of doesn't make sense because you leave one hostage behind lol but yea it's only one for extraction to win.
Rainbow6,31xo9x,Txontirea,1 point,Thu Apr 9 01:02:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed, that E3 hostage was amazing, that needs to come back into play here! Okay, it's the Alpha, fine, now bring back the original hostage dynamics you showed. Even if that was only a proof of concept, make it a reality."
Rainbow6,31xo9x,nomoneypenny,1 point,Thu Apr 9 01:26:49 2015 UTC,"Well technically you're still rescuing the hostage, but I agree that the hostage should be more important."
Rainbow6,31xo9x,Txontirea,1 point,Thu Apr 9 00:21:51 2015 UTC,"Fine, if you want to be technical about it. You know what I mean."
Rainbow6,31xo9x,i_am_BigBoss,1 point,Thu Apr 9 00:23:06 2015 UTC,"This is emergent behaviour in response to the design of the game right now.  If there is only one objective and the attackers must capture it, then the strongest play is to deploy everyone defensively around it. And if that's the case, then the attackers' strongest counter-play is to kill the enemy team one at a time instead of exposing yourself by going for the objective.  Do what Counter-Strike does: two hostages, and the CTs only have to rescue one of them. This forces both teams to either divide their attention or put all of their eggs in one basket.  You get situations where proper communication means you can feign towards one hostage to force a response, then have one teammate sneak behind and extract the other (now-undefended) objective."
Rainbow6,31xo9x,DecodedDragon,1 point,Thu Apr 9 01:28:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, exactly my point. It's the most effective manner of defending the objective, so the objective is nullified due to everyone being killed in the firefight. I had a discussion with someone else below about wondering whether adding a second hostage might negatively effect the map design, and overall design of the game. Something only Ubi can test, really, but it definitely does fix the 'problem' we're encountering currently."
Rainbow6,31xo9x,DecodedDragon,2,Thu Apr 9 01:56:14 2015 UTC,Extracting the hostage should be worth 2 pts and eliminating the enemy team would obviously be 1

Rainbow6,31yfbq,i_am_BigBoss,10,Thu Apr 9 03:12:28 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't that the attackers don't have a reason to extract the hostage, it is that the defenders have no reason to stray away from it. You can't extract the hostage if the entire enemy team is sitting a few meters away from it."
Rainbow6,31yfbq,Labyrinth666,3,Thu Apr 9 04:00:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah you've hit the nail on the head, I think this game type requires other sub objectives to make it more interesting and less of a Deathmatch."
Rainbow6,31yfbq,abienz,1 point,Thu Apr 9 06:47:41 2015 UTC,Right now it's exactly like a paintball (speedball) match. 95% of the time it is played until everyone on the other team is eliminated and then they grab the flag and get the points. It is just an inconvenience to have to hold it and keep playing while the other team still has players.
Rainbow6,31yfbq,abienz,4,Thu Apr 9 10:16:01 2015 UTC,That would break it.  Can you think of any real hostage situation where the Offensive team (SWAT) didn't go in to clear the Defensive team (Criminals) before they even thought about removing the hostages.  In real scenarios it would be extremely dangerous to even un-cuff the hostage until the whole area has been secured.
Rainbow6,31yfbq,siegewolf,1 point,Thu Apr 9 15:01:42 2015 UTC,Capturing the hostage should allow you to either remove an entire room from the map or remove an entrance. I think that would be cool.
Rainbow6,31yfbq,ZEPPIX,1 point,Thu Apr 9 10:19:40 2015 UTC,not a bad idea.
Rainbow6,31yfbq,Labyrinth666,-2,Thu Apr 9 14:57:47 2015 UTC,Sure but it would promote playing the objective even more and youd see less lone wolf players. Strategy would be a must in crunch time when you gotta make up some points.
Rainbow6,31yfbq,MotherLuigi,3,Thu Apr 9 03:20:00 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand what I said; if the defenders are sitting around the hostage you must kill them. How are you going to extract the hostage with their whole team standing in your way? Ask them nicely to not shoot you so you can get two points instead of one? Are you going to leave one guy alive in the room with the hostage and hope he doesn't kill everyone while you're moving the hostage out? No, you are going to kill everyone along the way because that's the only possible way to play on the attacking side. Also, reply to a post, don't create a new one every time."
Rainbow6,31yfbq,Drift_Pig,2,Thu Apr 9 04:11:07 2015 UTC,"I agree with you,wouldnt like you are saying,wouldnt this just cause the attackers not to kill off the other team just so they can extract"
Rainbow6,31yfbq,LEKrensta,-8,Thu Apr 9 04:33:08 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. Could infiltrate behind the enemy while they are focused ahead of them at the majority of your squad.
Rainbow6,31uzqb,MarkMarke,22,Wed Apr 8 11:02:10 2015 UTC,"Watching videos, it looks as if player movement is waaay too fast. That’s the first thing that struck me. Sprinting obviously sped things up more, which seemed weird for such close-quarters environments.."
Rainbow6,31uzqb,preygrowl,7,Wed Apr 8 11:20:39 2015 UTC,"Yes. The maps are too small for a fast-paced way of playing, which leads to a lot of deaths by people often strafing in and out of doorways."
Rainbow6,31uzqb,MAD_JIHAD,3,Wed Apr 8 15:10:47 2015 UTC,"Doors don't exist in the siege universe, they are simply ways, not doorways."
Rainbow6,31uzqb,Pest_AWC,12,Wed Apr 8 20:28:50 2015 UTC,"Wow!  You are spot on with every comment and suggestion!  My old R6 clan has been watching me play and they also agree completely.  Some of them like games like COD and CS but wouldn't pay to play Siege in the current direction it is going.  Siege tries too hard to be every man's shooter and doesn't please anyone for long.  If they don't use your suggestions and make this game more hardcore, then they better at least come up with a tested hardcore mode to appeal to strategic R6 FPS players.  I know they say some options can be set server side, but without a standard Hardcore Mode the old R6 fans will be scattered all about with different options on different servers and it will lead to a short lived game.  They should offer server side options for everything in some type of CUSTOM server list, but they also need a standard HARDCORE flag on a server if they follow a pre-determined balanced hardcore list of settings."
Rainbow6,31uzqb,JackWallabee,9,Wed Apr 8 14:08:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think any sort of hardcore mode will do R6 justice if the normal mode resembles any part of the current alpha. This game was created, from the ground up, to be everything no one asked for."
Rainbow6,31uzqb,RealityKing4Hire,5,Wed Apr 8 14:24:55 2015 UTC,"Agree with you both. This is Ubi ditching true RS fans to stay in trend with the current shooter genre, but they are failing to do that as the whole foundation of RS is incompatible with CoD, BF, CSGO and such. If they would change the direction of the game, they would have a more wide range of content at their disposal because some great ideas are avoided because of the way the game currently plays. What if actual tear gas hand grenades were added with gas mask available to players? Would that work in this current state? Look at shields, most of players don't stick with their teammates, they just rush in and neutralize enemies gunning them down. See a shield, throw a EMP grenade because it's the only thing you have for your class. Everything is connected here and a big domino effect is present. The earlier stages of this game were much more appealing and actually looked like they were going somewhere."
Rainbow6,31uzqb,cfisher2833,5,Wed Apr 8 15:49:10 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what audience they are trying to get here because my son who also plays COD still prefers Raven Shield over this.
Rainbow6,31uzqb,random63,1 point,Wed Apr 8 21:51:18 2015 UTC,"Me too.  They are forcing quite a improper mix of various games here and it doesn't work at all, and at the same time they don't want to ditch it. Yes, it's an alpha... but the game looked like it was going somewhere in the earlier builds, so ""alpha"" is no excuse for this. Both R6 and CoD,BF audiences, I mean, even new players to the franchise will be dissatisfied with Siege. If not now, then after some time playing the game.  Worst case scenario would be polishing the core of the game we have seen and played in Alpha, adding other features and shipping it.  This Alpha test is just a preview of the game. It's too short and reduced in terms of functions and content for us to test and provide feedback, if they would give us more time, update the alpha version now and/or regularly so we could see our feedback applied, open up the game in terms of core gameplay functions and content, that would be great. This ""alpha test"" given is nothing, would be better for Ubi to testdrive it closed and out of our reach than for us to just see a ""preview"" of the game with them being very selective of our feedback."
Rainbow6,31uzqb,Brethon,1 point,Wed Apr 8 22:21:29 2015 UTC,"my son who also plays COD still prefers Raven Shield over this.   I really can't stand that modern game developers, publishers, and even fans promote this idiotic view that the tactical FPS genre is this highly niche genre that the mainstream despises with a passion. Most of them have never even fucking played a game like Ravenshield or Swat 4! I once might have agreed with this sentiment, until I showed my young nephew (who primarily plays Minecraft) Swat 4; yeah, he wasn't that great at it at first, but he learned and he grew to really like the game. I can see people being turned off my Arma levels of realism and complexity, but Swat 4 or Ravenshield style? Dafuq!? Rainbow Six put Ubisoft on the map--there's obviously an audience for these games!"
Rainbow6,31uzqb,cfisher2833,11,Thu Apr 9 04:22:13 2015 UTC,"This sums it up what botters the most. There are enough fast paced shooters on the market. But if I want something slow I have to go back to Insurgency again..  That said, I disagree with the modding solution. Ubi shouldn't get away with a Casual mode that they will sell for 60$. Sure modding should be supported and dedicated servers a must. But If they don't fix the real issues or bring out a hardcore (true R6) mode themselves I won't be buying it untill a massive steam sale happens."
Rainbow6,31uzqb,iceycat,4,Wed Apr 8 12:01:21 2015 UTC,A good developer-player relationship changes everything.
Rainbow6,31uzqb,iceycat,6,Wed Apr 8 15:18:45 2015 UTC,"Too bad this is Ubisoft, that did everything in their power to block anyone from modding Raven Shield."
Rainbow6,31uzqb,Bluffhyperburn,2,Wed Apr 8 18:51:57 2015 UTC,"Ah! I was wondering why I couldn't find many Ravenshield mods. I naturally assumed that a PC game as old and respected as Ravenshield would have a ton of them, but nope--just one or two, and they weren't that great."
Rainbow6,31uzqb,JackWallabee,3,Thu Apr 9 04:25:44 2015 UTC,Also modding does nothing for us console gamers. The right solution needs to be to make the game right the first time.
Rainbow6,31uzqb,iceycat,9,Wed Apr 8 16:42:14 2015 UTC,"Great points, agree with you on pretty much everything.  I wouldn't go higher than 5v5 though. Movement speed is a huge problem,  it needs to be slowed WAY down. I've seen people strafe dance like crazy so you can't hit them, that needs to be changed so you can't exploit that. A sidestep mechanism or a significantly slower strafe speed are possible solutions as is throwing aim to crap while moving to cut down on all this fast movement spray and pray. Core R6 games always made your accuracy penalties for movement pretty high. Now you can do exploits like crouch/stand/crouch/stand while shooting or strafe left/right/left/right while shooting, etc. These kinds of loophole movement and shooting exploits need to be fixed."
Rainbow6,31uzqb,iceycat,-6,Wed Apr 8 12:11:47 2015 UTC,I totally disagree with you. Slowing down the movement would only make the game play really passive and slow in this fast paced game.
Rainbow6,31uzqb,Sethos88,5,Wed Apr 8 14:14:41 2015 UTC,"Obviously, it depends on the extent to which it's slowed down. If it's slowed down to Raven Shield levels, I don't think anyone's complaining. There needs to be a better balance, that's for sure."
Rainbow6,31uzqb,iceycat,7,Wed Apr 8 16:35:24 2015 UTC,"Lol! Exactly! R6 has NEVER been a fast paced game! R6 has always been about planning and execution. Methodical movement with intention and cunning. NOT rushing, strafe dance spraying, wall banging hit markers and twitch reflexes. That is CoD, R6 has always been the thinking man's FPS, it's what has always set it apart from everything else out there."
Rainbow6,31uzqb,thetom1337,6,Wed Apr 8 16:40:26 2015 UTC,"Hence the problem. New features and mechanics that evolve with time are one thing, but these CoD mechanics are just ripped off from another game. This isn't innovation, it's hopping on the bandwagon."
Rainbow6,31uzqb,Pest_AWC,6,Wed Apr 8 18:30:31 2015 UTC,"My biggest fear is their attempt to grab the wider audience, alienate the core Rainbow Six players and then in 4-6 months lose this 'wide audience' because they get bored and return to their stable games. So instead of focusing on a smaller backbone community, they opt for the fleeting and unreliable 'wide casual audience'.   Because the game right now, has a long way to go to appeal to us ye ole' Rainbow Six players, yet it seems like a weird frankenmess of ideas which I doubt will get their new target demographic riled up.   'Solving' all this by merely implementing a hardcore sort-of mode will have an opposite desired effect. It will just fragment the game, fragment the community and create two communities in one, which has never really helped any game as far as I'm aware.  This title needs to find its identity and fast, because right now, it tries to appeal too broad whilst riding on the Rainbow Six name, yet doesn't live up to it at all.   EDIT: Wording."
Rainbow6,31uzqb,ExploTheOne,3,Wed Apr 8 19:17:40 2015 UTC,"I agree completely, it's not just our fear, it's a solid fact at the moment and it is even seen in the Alpha. And even if they add a Hardcore Mode it would still require a lot of fine tuning to make it a true Hardcore mode.  It may seem to newcomers as a fun game, but it will wear off pretty soon if they don't make big changes to the core gameplay mechanics or better said - make it a game, not a mashup."
Rainbow6,31uzqb,cfisher2833,3,Wed Apr 8 23:27:07 2015 UTC,"Hardly anybody plays hardcore modes on CoD and Battlefield. The stats are like a 30:1 ratio, sometimes more. There shouldn't be a hardcore mode for R6, there should just be R6. No hit markers, realistic recoil, slower movement speed, no sprinting, high weapon damage, no X-ray outlines, heavy accuracy penalty for moving while shooting and stance change delays to prevent crap like drop shotting. Hardcore mode should just be the normal way the game is played. fPS gamers are too used to being spoon fed ability so that it becomes more about reaction speed and less about the tactics and planning that R6 was always about in the first place."
Rainbow6,31uzqb,Shadow_Dog,2,Wed Apr 8 23:53:17 2015 UTC,"Now, if only UBI would listen to true hardcore fans that have always been there for RS instead of shaping the game to attract a lot of new players from CoD, BF, other generic shooters and even players that don't know what RS is actually."
Rainbow6,31uzqb,Strykaar,3,Thu Apr 9 01:22:09 2015 UTC,"I'll get this out of the way first: why they decided that the US classes working alongside SAS, GIGN etc. Should be the FBI rather than, say, US Army Delta, is beyond me.  That being said, what's bothering me most about how this is shaping up is that SOCOM did a great hostage rescue mode years ago on the PS2.  I just miss that game."
Rainbow6,31uzqb,JamesBigglesworth,3,Thu Apr 9 01:29:39 2015 UTC,"Im not really familiar with the rainbowsix franchise but i was looking foward to trying out a new fps( i'm more of a cs guy). What bothered me the most watching streams was the incredibly high amount of downtime, the loadouts/prep time between rounds would turn me off from the game. Is it something you guys are fine with? Play 2 mins wait 2 mins repeat?"
Rainbow6,31uzqb,spacecowboyj,10,Wed Apr 8 18:15:33 2015 UTC,"Part of the fun of R6 is in planning and choosing what you take with you to accomplish the job.  I do find the class system annoying, especially starting as a new payer.  I would much prefer setting up my own unrestricted load outs to choose from so that if I want to play a certain way 5 rounds in a row, I can.  I don't like being forced into classes I don't want to play."
Rainbow6,31uzqb,TronikBob,4,Wed Apr 8 14:03:02 2015 UTC,"Exactly! One of the good thing Vegas implemented is the character and new loadout customization. There should be some limited customization for your characters but restricted to the theme of rainbow like you cant change colors, but only the gear you wear, and the ability to create your own loadouts not retarded classes. And maybe a Ghost Recon Gunsmith style weapon customization as well."
Rainbow6,31uzqb,preygrowl,3,Wed Apr 8 14:13:54 2015 UTC,"I love losing myself in the vast amounts of guns and gear in RS3. It isn't a fixed class system, and it works perfectly with the planning system as it is not linear. The whole thing looks forced in Siege, almost resembles Dirty Bomb (f2p fast-paced shooter on Steam from SplashDamage) in a way because they bring a lot of classes with one gadget or so, pistol and primary but there is no major difference between them. I mean, that can be fixed and put in the right place, but who knows will Ubi fully fledge that Class Model. I also can't stand seeing Terrorist Hunt with a predefined class."
Rainbow6,31uzqb,Pest_AWC,2,Wed Apr 8 15:37:06 2015 UTC,"Depends. I purposely avoid game mods like Strike in Insurgency (which you should check out if you haven't--such an amazing game), because it's a last man standing mode that will have you waiting 5 or 10 minutes for the next match. However, some modes like Push (like BF's rush) or firefight (conquest), the respawn mechanic is partially tied in to your team's performance and I like that--example: in firefight mode in Insurgency, if you're dead, you only respawn once your team has captured one of the points. Works well most of the time unless your team is utter shit, in which case the enemy usually wins in less than 5mins anyway."
Rainbow6,31uzqb,Mtpleasantaint,3,Wed Apr 8 15:26:52 2015 UTC,Where is raw input in this game? Come on man.
Rainbow6,31uzqb,Kaladinar,3,Thu Apr 9 04:30:00 2015 UTC,"Modding ? Ded Servers ? Never gonna happen.  You heard about useless DLC / seasonpass ? Dude they are going to milk the rainbow six cow with as many DLCs as possible.  First DLC will be the ""Doors DLC, only 9,99$ and season pass includes custom doors""."
Rainbow6,31uzqb,random63,2,Thu Apr 9 00:00:24 2015 UTC,"I think the enemy's operator classes should be blocked by default, and only show up in your hud what class they are if you spot them. That way you could potentially hide a player whose ability you don't want the other team to know you have and surprise them with it, as well as give the infiltrating team another thing to search for rather than just hunting for the hostage during planning phase."
Rainbow6,31uzqb,RealityKing4Hire,2,Thu Apr 9 01:10:17 2015 UTC,"What I really hope Ubisoft comes to realize is that in making a game closer to the older R6 games, making it slow and tactical and methodical, they're going to not only greatly please the R6 veteran crowd, but reach (I believe, at least) a wider demographic as well.    The market right now is flooded with fast paced, run-'n'-gun shooters and I feel people are looking for an escape from that.  You're not going to beat CoD by copying the formula and then trying to add bells and whistles to set yourself apart.    So the question I ask is, ""Do you want to waste all the man hours, resources, and potential to have a 6-12 month life span game that loses all interest after that time is up?""      TL;DR: return to the roots to create a refreshing experience in the current FPS climate."

Rainbow6,31vkgw,Kalapea91,5,Wed Apr 8 17:20:03 2015 UTC,"It is sad that they can't just realize that a game with the minimalism of classic R6/RS but the vast variety (tons of guns/modes/maps..like TONS of maps, has any multiplayer game even come close?) with the polish, gun mechanics and team aspects of Ravenshield is what everyone wants and has wanted since RedStorm.   Also it sucks that Ubisoft has failed to ever realize what made r6 games popular and great was the community making maps, tournaments, mods, ladders.  Why is Zone.com and MPlayer still the pinnacle (>10 years old) of multiplayer interfaces?  Steam is getting there but still miles behind.  I swear Ubisoft is always confused why these games don't last past the first week of hype:  horrible console inspired interfaces.  Ravenshield and Ghostrecon were great games, but if they were on Zone.com instead of the shitty Ubisoft interface they tried to make work they probably would of been two of the most played games at the time."
Rainbow6,31vkgw,cmai3000,5,Wed Apr 8 17:21:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but I'd add ""increase recoil"" to the list"

Rainbow6,31vkgw,random63,3,Wed Apr 8 21:02:50 2015 UTC,"I've played it and agree with most of the suggestions.  The problem with the ammo is that bullets have no impact atm. So everyone shoots full auto and thus 200 rounds aren needed. I would prefer 4/5 mags (30 rounds) and have each shot be a threat. Right now a single shot doesn't even force me into cover.  I disagree with the revive you mentioned. I wish to keep it in place (one revive each). Maybe in team matches I would have to rethink this, but atm it's a good risk/reward to lure out a party member.  All other points are valid remarks"
Rainbow6,31vkgw,random63,2,Wed Apr 8 16:05:00 2015 UTC,"When I think revive all I can think is CoD4 last stand perk, haha. I guess one is fine but I'd wanna be able to drag my teammate."
Rainbow6,31vkgw,R63_Veteran,2,Wed Apr 8 16:19:09 2015 UTC,When you are down you have 2 options. Crawl away or hold the bleeding. So dragging wouldn't make much sense.  Maybe a class that has X number of revives as a special ability.
Rainbow6,31vkgw,Aware_building,4,Wed Apr 8 16:26:16 2015 UTC,I hate that outline around players and I don't like gadgets like the heart monitor.  COD has the casual market secured.

Rainbow6,31vkgw,cmai3000,0,Wed Apr 8 16:07:07 2015 UTC,Same can be said for everyone in here wanting Ubisoft to change everything they don't like without even considering that a majority might enjoy what the game feels like at the moment.
Rainbow6,31vkgw,CookieDoughCooter,7,Wed Apr 8 17:16:10 2015 UTC,"Yep. Unfortunately it seems like they're happy with these gameplay elements, and making these changes now almost makes it a completely different game anyway.

To bad Ubisoft can't realize this with R6/RS.  How amazing would it be to play the original campaigns with updated graphics/sounds/destruction?  All I want to do is play some 1v1 bunkers with a winchester.  I doubt many Ubi devs would even understand that sentence, and that is why the greatness of the original games will always be lost."
Rainbow6,31vkgw,CGrizzy6,1 point,Wed Apr 8 14:58:16 2015 UTC,"I'll never forget playing Rainbow Six Vegas 1 on PS3 with the community dev. He hosted a ""play with the community dev"" event right before Vegas 2 came out. The game was abysmal on PS3 but I could see all of the potential, so I had to play and find out if Vegas 2 would be better.   About 20 mins in, the guy got so frustrated he started venting! He'd start asking ""What? Why isn't it doing [insert flaw community has pointed out for months]?"" And I'd say ""We've been posting these issues to the forums for months... Will Vegas 2 have these issues?"" He'd beat around the bush and give a non answer. The one thing that pissed me off was that the whole time he kept talking about how much better it was on 360, he only played it on 360, the 360 didn't have these problems.. I paid the same for the PS3 version, it needs to be just as good! I didn't really press the issue because I respected the hell out of him for doing that event. Very few community devs do that. Thankfully, Vegas 2 was tons better on PS3.   For people that didn't have to play Vegas in PS3, problems included: Horrid frame rate, problems joining, absurd loading times, mic issues, sound problems, and more... but it was one of the only shooters on PS3 at the time so some people played it."

Rainbow6,31vkgw,xnatehatex,1 point,Thu Apr 9 03:18:09 2015 UTC,"After watching beta play on Twitch, I really wish they would have kept the cover system that they had in Vegas. Going into third person while posted up on a wall and battling it out against enemies while bullets filed past your face was pretty intense. Rainbow Six Vegas was my favorite Rainbow Six franchise. Keeping that cover system over the lean out system, in my opinion, would have been better. It was unique and I haven't seen a game mimic that since Vegas."
Rainbow6,31vkgw,M3X1,-2,Wed Apr 8 21:24:32 2015 UTC,"These posts are ridiculous. You haven't even played the game and have no actual tangible idea of how the game feels.   On top of that you pretend these changes are simple common sense, when you really have no idea what most of their impacts will be. The biggest is the ammo. 3 mags, seriously? This game's destruction engine is so expensive it would make zero sense to restrict your wall banging capabilities like that.  I agree on making the movement slower but people in this sub pretend they know exactly how I w to fix this game by changing it to fit their desires, which is rarely actually a good way to balance games."

This game is more a competitor to Counter-Strike.  Drastic changes to the base gameplay are unlikely to happen at this stage of development unless they shelve the project and come back to it after revisiting the drawing board.
Rainbow6,31wh1u,nomoneypenny,1 point,Thu Apr 9 01:35:33 2015 UTC,"Although developers probably don't want to hear it, no FPS will ever match Counter-Strike in the competitive market, they really won't. It is a game that has basically been built from the ground up to be a small-scale competitive FPS. Unless a new Quake or UT game comes out that brings back the play style of the original 3 Quakes or UT99/UT2k4, CSGO will remain the pinnacle of competitive FPS gaming on the PC for quite awhile."

Rainbow6,31t2z3,random63,4,Wed Apr 8 11:50:53 2015 UTC,"obligatory clip/magazine comment  In seriousness though, Insurgency handles magazine ammunition well. It's essentially a ""tactical reload,"" wherein a fresh magazine goes in, but the previous mag, while not yet entirely depleted, is retained instead of disposed of.  This sort of realistic, or authentic ammo consumption will not accommodate the game's current pace with regard to overall speed, accuracy, and how many hits it takes to knock people down. Damage models, and other such things, would have to be altered quite a bit."

I know we dont want spray and pray but with friendly fire on if they remove the team outlines then this will drop the spraying as you would have to be very careful you did not take out a friendly (or hostage) whilst still encouraging that sort of gameplay, and as this is called Seige I assume that is a key mechanic they wish to persue."
Rainbow6,31t2z3,DocTavia,2,Wed Apr 8 10:23:13 2015 UTC,With low ammo the engine's destruction features would be less notable.
Rainbow6,31t2z3,TTUVAPOR,3,Wed Apr 8 12:37:37 2015 UTC,"Being brutally honest here, I was so excited to jump into the alpha last night when I got off work and installed it. First thing I did was fire off multiple clips of my gun and I thought...wtf? Not trying to be rude here but the gunplay in this game right now is not what I was expecting at all. It's most certainly not like what was shown in the official Siege trailers.   Furthermore, the dev corner video on recoil seems to be completely absent from the alpha. Where is the recoil? It's barely there.  If this is the direction they want Siege to be with the gunplay...I can't help it but say no thanks. I'll stick with Insurgency knowing the gun play is spot-on semi-realistic and challenging.  I agree, Siege's guns need to act as close as possible to Insurgency."

Rainbow6,31t2z3,Frigid319,2,Wed Apr 8 12:12:53 2015 UTC,"I also agree totally. Less rounds, and less bullets to take an enemy down. When the bullet hit count is more realistic (a human can only take a few rounds, depending on hit location before they go down) it gives it a more visceral feeling. Please Ubisoft, not a huge change, it doesn't have to be two rounds before an enemy drops, but a slight tweak to lower ammo numbers and hit points would be a major improvement, in my humble opinion."
Rainbow6,31t2z3,TTUVAPOR,1 point,Wed Apr 8 14:47:03 2015 UTC,"This is what I was expecting Siege to be like, except on a much smaller scale, closer quarters, tight spaces, slower methodical planning/approaching an area, etc.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9buFtqC-9c  That's Insurgency. It's not far off from what I would label a tactical military sim/arcade game. It's a brutal war game, you have to think about where you move all the time because of the chance of being shot by the enemy that you do not always see.  I was thinking Siege was going to be similar to this. I was mistaken :("
Rainbow6,31t2z3,TTUVAPOR,2,Wed Apr 8 16:46:05 2015 UTC,"As I read more and more people's impressions, I'm having a tough time understanding what this game wants to be. Does it want to be a super lethal tactical game or does it want to be a generic COD-clone? When I say COD-clone, I'm talking purely about the gunplay of the game. It's very point and shoot, not much need for actually aiming your shot and managing your shots being fired."

Rainbow6,31t2z3,spicysalmon69,2,Wed Apr 8 11:57:17 2015 UTC,"The type of action that you carry out directly influences the amount of ammo you're going to carry. On contact patrols and other patrols where we knew we were likely to take contact, we stocked up on as much as we could carry. Now I've never broken a siege or done a hostage rescue but we have been tasked with clearing operations quite a few times and I'll say from experience that 6-8 mags is the right amount. It doesn't hinder your movement anymore than your plate carrier already does. I can't speak for SWAT but I would imagine that their ttp's aren't that dissimilar from ours (The biggest difference being that their mission is the preservation of life vs ours which is the taking of.)"

There will be changes based on feedback and whatnot, but so far the HB sensors, hit markers and doors (or lack there of) are a big thing most people are not happy with. Other feedback has been the wpns sound 'tin-like' and there is no PTT feature on the comms. Other than those, Id say this is going to be good. I suspect 2 more maps soon; Maybe make some options turn on and off in the lobby for the host, but otherwise, it looks great!   Wpns need to do more damage to reduce the ammo count, esp shotguns.  As for 200 rnds, that is what most HRT teams are taking: 4-6 magazines of 25-30 rnds. For game balance, I would agree to going to 150 or 120."

I don't get why people are so in love with it. It feels good, I'll give you that, and managing to point shoot a target feels rewarding, but not knowing where my weapon is pointed because it wiggles around in my shoulder... no.

I love how you magically toss out a rope and you're scaling up the building, but even more egregious is the fact that you can ascend or descend while having BOTH hands on your primary weapon!!! Who needs hands to climb a rope? Not this guy! I also wish you had talked about the lack of actual real world doors in a game that's all about CQB room clearing. They're obviously too in love with their barricade system to alter it. The Dev FAQ that stated doors caused lag issues has to be the WORST excuse I have ever heard."

Prior to Vegas there was never a cover system in any previous R6 game. The problem most of us R6ers from pre Vegas games had was that a 3rd person cover sysyem allowed you to have magical sightlines that were impossible for you to have while in first person. I wouldn't be against ""trying"" (and scrapping if it didn't work well) some kind of first person cover system but not the magically clairvoyant 3rd person perspective cover system that the Vegas games had. That goes in the magical box along with hitmarkers and xray outlines."
Rainbow6,31wxoa,iceycat,1 point,Wed Apr 8 21:10:13 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but on this note, all I'm really looking for is clarification that I'm behind the cover that I think I'm behind. rather than my head or my characters butt sticking out for the easy kill. With a cover system you visually see your character in the cover and know you're behind / not visible as intended. that's all I'm looking for i suppose."
Rainbow6,31wxoa,MarkMarke,1 point,Wed Apr 8 21:22:25 2015 UTC,"I agree on all points and as for the cover system, they could add an simple one where with a press of a key you would hunker down, lower your head and stick to an object. It would also make lean more efficient in a way. It is actually possible to do that for Siege, but it's up to Ubi to decide whether or not they are going to implement it. The RS:Vegas cover system had some loopholes such as blind firing and a clear image of what is ahead and I think it wouldn't be fit for Siege."

The cover system in Vegas simply made people spray from behind cover all day and didn't promote tactics at all.  Now I'm not hating on Vegas, I liked the games, but they simply weren't real R6 that people loved and remember. I think Siege is trying to be another bastard stepchild as well, which is fine, I guess, but you can't really call either a tactical shooter.

Even though I don't have any of my VM's running I still disabled them and was good to go.   Like you I created a DMZ, port range forwarded etc. None of which made a difference.  This game must have some very odd routing as these adapters should have nothing to do with it (especially considering the VM's were not on).  Either way thanks for the heads up!"

Rainbow6,31yg8u,megafallout3fan,6,Thu Apr 9 03:19:56 2015 UTC,"I like how you put ""fans"" in quotes.   Rainbow Six used to be an FPS series that was built with realistic, slow, and methodical play in mind. It attracted a following based on this.   Then once Ubisoft acquired the Rainbow Six named and pushed out Raven Shield, the higher ups decided to try out the console market. Lockdown and the Vegas series were built with console in mind first, PC second.   As a result of this change in focus Rainbow Six has dramatically changed from a realistic and cerebral tactical shooter to an action shooter. Ubisoft, in trying to make the Rainbow Six title accessible to the casual console audience, stripped all the challenging aspects of the game and added in crutches to make the game extremely easy to just pick up and play.   And the fans have the right to be disappointed, if anything because Ubisoft has specifically stated that this game would be ""returning to its old roots."" It's a huge slap to the face.   The sad thing is, since Ubisoft wants to keep targeting the console audience, the original direction of the series has since then been hijacked in order to provide an accessible and non-challenging shooter.   I was introduced to Rainbow Six with Vegas 2 and Vegas 1 on my PS3. I then tried out Raven Shield on the PC. The difference between Vegas and Raven Shield is night and day. The Rainbow Six series started out as an extremely tense and realistic shooter, requiring you to exercise caution and advance slowly through the map. It reminded me of the tension of the first Splinter Cell titles. It really stood out in the FPS genre because it offered such an extremely different experience.   But the direction Siege is going is nothing more than Call of Duty's S&D mode with non-regenerating health, Battlefield destruction, and CS:GO's UI. And if I want to play a fast paced action shooter like this I have plenty of other alternatives."
Rainbow6,31yg8u,trineroks,0,Thu Apr 9 05:39:25 2015 UTC,What do you expect? Ubisoft is a triple A company. I can tell you right now that the fan base for the classic games is not big enough to have this sell well especially since there is probably no fan base on the consoles. They mix up casual and tactical and I think it works out good.

The revives are a little annoying but it's not game breaking.  I have not played the game enough to comment on the recoil and damage that well, the preset classes is fun, and will maybe be changed in actual release, the matchmaking for now is in place probably because they haven't got to it.  Doors is for some reason a MASSIVE issue for players and I'm not sure why, they are kind of annoying but for some reason they take it too seriously.  I have yet to knife or be knifed so not sure how that works, not sure what is wrong with killcams that much, and the built in wall hack should have a use limit but it's fine other wise.

Rainbow6,31wvu4,trineroks,1 point,Wed Apr 8 20:16:14 2015 UTC,"In terms of core FPS elements, the biggest gripes with Vegas 1 were:   Regenerating health Revives 3rd person cover system that allowed you to exploit 3rd person mechanics Gunplay is still too tight (you really need to try out the original Rainbow Six games to understand how much those games punish you in recoil) ""Smooth"" movement feel with fast strafing Infinite ammo pistols Customization which gave the feel that Team Rainbow is a pack of mercenaries instead of a highly organized international counter-terror team   If these were removed, lethality of weapons reintroduced, leaning reintroduced, and locational damage effects reintroduced, I have no doubt that its core gameplay would feel more like the originals than Siege. Vegas 1 at least had no sprinting, magical teammate X-ray vision, instant knife button, hitmarkers, where-did-the-enemy-see-me-from detection ring, and still had doors (even if they removed smooth door opening).  Some of the complaints also stem from the singleplayer portion (originally omitted them since I wanted to compare it to Siege, which has only shown us multiplayer thus far):   No longer in control of the mission - instead of managing 3 or 4 teams, you're a leader of a 3 man Rambo team (Rambo since regenerating health and invincible AI teammates who can be revived anytime). The planning phase that had evolved since the first Rainbow Six was all but scrapped. Cannot customize AI teammate loadouts   TL;DR: Talking in terms of core FPS play, a Rainbow Six Vegas 1 with the following changes:   No regenerating health No revives No 3rd person cover system Leaning A lot slower strafing speed More punishing recoil Limited ammo on pistols More damaging weapons   Would be a lot closer to how the original Rainbow Six games played than what we see in Siege."

Rainbow6,31s0du,Livinpink,75,Tue Apr 7 18:36:43 2015 UTC,"I'm editing this as I find more things   Breach charges/Thermite are completely unintuitive:    Sometimes charges/thermite work exactly how you expect them to, and sometimes they don't. For example on House, rappelling up the side, you're unable to blow any of the outside walls out, but you're still allowed to place and waste a charge? Some walls take two charges to blow through, etc, etc. I'm fine with not being able to destroy some walls, but IMO you shouldn't be able to place a charge if that is indestructible.    Run and gun play is far too strong, no fatigue system linked to gunsway/inaccuracy. Strafing battles entirely dominate this game. Two players meet, it's not a question of aim or positioning, it's who strafes left and right, crouching and uncrouching and spraying their SMG the best. Needs to stop. Greatly reduce the speed of strafing, to promote more cautious play utilizing strafing and leaning to clear areas. This also fixes the terrible strafe dueling going on currently. Credit /u/trineroks I also propose a slight inaccuracy to shooting whilst moving, though. Netcode is abysmal, frequently being killed by players clearly not there, killcam showing people shooting air and me dying 20 feet away.  Not many players seem to be aware that armor is placed by Rook for them to use/that armor is even a thing. Requires more direction on the HUD. Hitmarkers through walls/smoke/everything. Desperately needs to be removed. The Enemy Detection arrow Ubisoft seem to love to include in every single game they release, has to be removed. This has absolutely no place being in a competitve multiplayer shooter, what are you thinking? Overall lethality needs upping tremendously. Everyone seems to take way too many bullets before going down. I dislike the ability to revive critically wounded teammates, but if you want to keep that in, whatever. Personally, if you're going to keep this in, allow it to only happen once. Heartbeat sensor You have to redesign the Terrorist's look. They can't look identical to the CTs, it's ridiculous. Where did those assets go from the original reveal? Unlimited barricades, really? As an addendum to this, can we please have some functional doors? I think showing both the defensive and offensive teams where they can blow holes in the floor with outlines(As apparently now we can't do it anywhere like the demo showed) is really dumb. It makes it useless. Especially when there's only one drop into a room and everyone can just position around it and stare at it.  Barbed wire affecting only attackers reduces the amount of communication and planning the Terrorists will have to do, whilst being 100% effective. Too many Operators have the portable cover, and on Plane, it makes the map bascially impossible for CTs when placed effectively. Possibly add a ""kick down"" for the CTs when they're able to get close to it? No smoke grenades?  Sitting behind the hostage at all times is insanely strong. This is due to the fact that the hostage is killable, and, if wounded by the CT's trying to kill you, forces them to run in to perform first aid. I dont think making the hostage a non-element is a good idea, but at present I really dont have a good solution for this. Doesn't select NVIDIA cards automatically if you also have integrated graphics. Zero recoil on weapons, shotguns are unbelievably weak. You should be able to lean without your iron sights raised. Small thing, but can we have a toggle ADS option? Holding it down is very uncomfortable for prolonged periods of time. Leaning is far too quick, giving players basically unpunishable prefiring ability by peeking quickly to see where an enemy is and then immediately going back, only to repeek barely a second later firing already.  No push to talk/text box. Killcam in the middle of rounds prevents players from playing in a spot past one kill, if the other team are communicating as they should be.  XRAY on teammates current position is overpowered and prevents all friendly fire in firefights. It nullifies communication between teammates when clearing areas of the map. I would, however, like XRAY on breaching charges that I myself have placed. Short round time. Drones are still absurd past the planning phase. Even more absurd that dead CT players are able to control the drones, get free information by looking through cameras and are able to report this to their alive teammates. Spectate teammates only, (FOR BOTH SIDES) please. Updated, Mute's scramblers, when placed well, freeze drones dead.  Mute's Jammers don't give any feedback to the player other than they're active. The only way a defensive player can get an idea of the radius of the scrambling field, or even what it does, is by playing the attacking side and running into one with a drone. I don't like that the terrorists are able to access security cameras that the CT's can do nothing about and report their movements. There is way too much ghosting in this game, and there's not nearly enough reliance on clearing the map systematically through communication and teamwork. This is likely down to the short round time making you feel like you have to add these systems.   Overall it feels like a bunch of things have been carried over from other modern shooters with little to no thought about whether they should be in this game or not. You guys really need to take a long hard think about what you want this game to be, hardcore and tactical, or easy to pick up and play for 20 minutes like CoD and BF (Nowadays). This hybrid thing we have going right now is just bad for both.   I just want to remind you guys of what we were shown as a vertical slice. Even though all of that is pre-rendered, fake and completely directed, do you ever think the game with it's current direction stands a chance of being even close to that? I dont, so far. :("
Rainbow6,31s0du,Txontirea,7,Tue Apr 7 19:34:43 2015 UTC,"I'd also like to elaborate on your comments about strafing. Yes, there's plenty of CQB strafe dueling going on thanks to reduced lethality of weapons and fast strafe speeds with low accuracy penalties. However, fast strafe speeds also promote things such as dipping in and out of doorways to look at what's on the other side. It makes leaning totally redundant.  I think, instead of your proposed solutions to the strafe problem, Ubisoft ought to look back at older tactical shooters (Rogue Spear, Raven Shield, SWAT 3/4) and heavily tone down strafe speeds. This would promote actually using leaning to look around corners and doorways. It would also fix the issue of strafe dueling.  In addition to reducing strafing speed, leaning must be accessible in a non-ADS state, kinda like how all the tactical shooters used to do in the past. It's honestly a little cumbersome to have the iron sights in your face when all you want to do is peek around a corner.  Players should be using leaning and slow strafing in conjunction to move around corners and doorways cautiously."
Rainbow6,31s0du,trineroks,7,Wed Apr 8 01:40:17 2015 UTC,"Added to post, as I like your solution more overall. Still, I think a slight amount of inaccuracy whilst moving and shooting would help with how players entered rooms. (Currently a lot of running into rooms and spraying.)"
Rainbow6,31s0du,Txontirea,7,Wed Apr 8 01:47:19 2015 UTC,"Thanks man. Also agree that there should be a bit of an accuracy nerf.  Another thing that really contributes to the run and gun playstyle is sprinting. I don't know what you think of sprinting, but this mechanic really promotes the type of one-man flanking gameplay you tend to see in CoD/BF titles.  What Siege should do is take the Counter Strike/classic tactical FPS ideas for movement - keep regular movement speed but introduce a slow walking stance that keeps your aim steady. And totally eliminate sprinting from the game.  And sprinting really doesn't make sense in a game like this - at least games like Battlefield, Red Orchestra 2, etc take place in large open battlefields and have a justification for sprinting. Sprinting in a close quarters counter-terror tactical shooter is ridiculous.  EDIT: And that stupid enemy detection indicator seriously has to go. Why does the game offer a sixth sense crutch for players who don't bother to check their surroundings? Instead you have these white arrows indicating in what direction the enemy saw you from."
Rainbow6,31s0du,trineroks,2,Wed Apr 8 05:11:21 2015 UTC,"I think he was talking about when your on plane, for example, and a guy at the end of the hallway can just run left and right strafing at full speed with pin point accuracy while looking down sites and totally destroy people trying to lean and be tactical."
Rainbow6,31s0du,Carreau13,3,Wed Apr 8 10:46:20 2015 UTC,"Aiming down sights is also somewhat of an issue because it actually guarantees pinpoint accuracy. You do have a point. When you're strafing while aiming down sights, you don't suffer from accuracy debuffs.   Hence slower strafe speeds and an aim debuff. Maybe if you strafe while aiming down sights the weapon sways around to throw off pin point accuracy."
Rainbow6,31s0du,trineroks,6,Wed Apr 8 10:58:49 2015 UTC,"I think Ubisoft will take this opportunity to filter out the features that they weren't sure of, whether they should be in the game or not based on community feedback."
Rainbow6,31s0du,gonapster,11,Wed Apr 8 01:31:17 2015 UTC,"We can only hope, as the direction of the game at this moment leaves a lot to be desired for all of us Rainbow Six fans who thought this might be a return to form."
Rainbow6,31s0du,Txontirea,2,Wed Apr 8 01:34:20 2015 UTC,"I'm really hoping they do a great job listening. As I've mentioned before, 343 has done an amazing job asking fans about the Halo 5 beta (literally 3 whole surveys since the beta ended only 3 months ago). I hope they go the same route. I keep saying ""Easy but important changes can make this game a blast to play."" The only change that would be difficult is changing the recoil for the guns. That would most likely be a pretty big task (but hopefully I'm wrong)."
Rainbow6,31s0du,SteveEsquire,3,Wed Apr 8 02:15:05 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I didn't get access so take this with a grain of salt, but I agree with everything you've said from what I've seen. Main problem, the recoil. It needs to be much more like previous titles/ARMA-esque rather than BF/CoD. I was worried about hitmarkers and killcam at first, but now I'm most worried about the actual shooting. I thought it'd be changed from the original demo/trailer they showed, but it still appears to be extremely weak and arcade-like."
Rainbow6,31s0du,SteveEsquire,2,Wed Apr 8 01:34:27 2015 UTC,I like a lot of these. But One of the classes has a smoke grenade I just don't remember which. I like the shorter rounds and leaning. Leaning just seems kinda pointless when you can sprint strafe everywhere.
Rainbow6,31s0du,Carreau13,2,Wed Apr 8 10:45:01 2015 UTC,"From the little I've played so far, this game is far too easy (probably because of zero recoil)... I ended up with 4 or 3 K/D, which should NOT happen the first time you play any FPS game. Recoil really is almost non-existent, and I can't even switch to single-fire on carbines and SMGs (that might have been left out for the Alpha, at least I hope so).... As I play more I'll know more though...."
Rainbow6,31s0du,GHOST-117,1 point,Wed Apr 8 11:17:33 2015 UTC,My only argument to wire affecting teammates is that I think it could really affect the gameplay. What if a terrorist needs to get through a choke point during the map but it was blocked during the planning phase because cops often come that way. That would be my only defense for barbed wire not affecting teammates.   Beyond that one point I agree with everything else.
Rainbow6,31s0du,IHaveNoFiya,-2,Wed Apr 8 00:10:32 2015 UTC,"Not disagreeing with you, but you bring up what I would think are obvious points to a FPS player on PC...yet a guy like JackFrags didn't really go into the detail you have...I wonder why? Makes me wonder if the alpha we're playing now is different from what he played?  He said there was recoil/lift, but it was easily manageable in a few mins of playing...you're saying there's none at all."

Rainbow6,31s0du,DennyKovacs,14,Tue Apr 7 23:44:35 2015 UTC,"It's definitely a cool little game but I feel like you guys lost your way a bit. I didn't expect it to actually turn out like the E3 footage but it definitely has swayed in tone from the slow-paced-into-explosive-action hostage situation SWAT vs Robbers/Crooks game  you introduced to us. Now its just ""two teams of generic operators fight over a house/plane and theres a hostage who sits there last man standing wins"".   Here's my feedback, I of course left out things that are obviously due to game being in Alpha stage (IE no party system, net code glitches etc etc)   Spray and pray is way too effective. Player models are pretty much the same on both teams, there's a guy on Rogue with GIGN patches on his vest/shoulder pads, and theres a guy with the same thing on Raven. Only different is the guy on Rogue has different headgear and the GIGN patch on his chest has duct tape on it. It's gotten me killed dozens of times. This needs to be addressed. Where did the cool Robbers vs SWAT dynamic go from all of the art and the E3 trailer? Would be way easier to IFF. Rounds are too fast paced for many of the gadgets to come into play much, set up time needs to be increased. Player strafe movement needs to be nerfed hard. Sprinting needs a nerf as well, the sound penalty is good but you still shouldnt be able to sprint for that long or fast. Weapons:Weapon damage needs to be way buffed, but in contrast weapon accuracy needs a nerf along with the addition of sway and more movement penalties. This, in addition to an ammo count reduction and a MAGAZINE BASED AMMO POOL would result in more well thought-out, tactical, and satisfying firefights.  Remove the crosshair please.  I don't like the class/character system at all. I get you guys were trying to make it kinda sorta like RS3 with the different characters from different countries but I also feel this weird TF2 vibe from it. I feel like the game would be better served with an in-depth character customizer IE you can pick gender, nationality, background, your Rainbow/Bad Guys appearance, and then just do loadouts. The actual hostage is all but useless really. I've played since the game opened at like 12:30ish and I havent seen anyone actually interact with the hostage, it always just boils down to team elimination. Really kinda ruins it for me IMO.    Thanks for reading guys."

You would never just blindly rush a corner or enter a room without a proper plan of attack.   It seems like it takes FAR too many bullets to kill someone, since when was R6 Call of Duty? I dont care if there is a hardcore mode, this game needs to be tweaked so that people fear bullets and make smart decisions instead of blindly turning corners and rushing the map.  UBI, once upon a time, you were my dev of choice! Please don't let me down with Seige! I don't want COD, I dont want CS, and I dont want BF. I want the tactical shooter i grew up playing that stood out among the rest. Bring back the one/two shot kills and bring this game back to its tactical and patient gameplay roots!!!"
Rainbow6,31s0du,EmeraldWill,8,Tue Apr 7 20:53:35 2015 UTC,I agree here... i stopped playing the alpha this afternoon after a very short time on the game because every game i played the enemy team is just blindly running into rooms spraying and you will eventually die. This makes the game time very short and not worth playing imo
Rainbow6,31s0du,CanadianBacon10,-3,Tue Apr 7 21:18:32 2015 UTC,"Its really just because of lack of communication. People are still discovering the game, it's hard to make a plan without knowing the map"
Rainbow6,31s0du,notimeforname,3,Wed Apr 8 03:30:14 2015 UTC,even when the game comes closer to release or even when its released i see this issue still standing in pugs...i can only see a better game play experience in this if its a private game with people who want to play tactically (or even hosting your own servers like RBSV games where you can ban stuff). other than that with other game experience in shooters i believe the pugs will just be a run and gun COD style game
Rainbow6,31s0du,CanadianBacon10,0,Wed Apr 8 05:04:31 2015 UTC,"keyword: pugs, don't expect the same gameplay when players become accustomed to game map/mechanics and higher tier play shows. It's the same with every shooter that comes out. Starts off as run and gun then eventually slows down and becomes more tactical when you look at higher tier play."
Rainbow6,31s0du,TuneHD,7,Wed Apr 8 09:54:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah there is far to much Run and Gun right now among other out of place items in the game right now. Like why does the robot have a Tazer? that's so odd to me. Because it having the spotter ability is fine but the Tazer is unnecessary and gimmicky. Also don't get me started on the EMP and heart beat monitor crap.   Plus to me it does not FEEL like Rainbow Six right now (like others have mentioned, its a mixture of other fps games and not like the Series it needs to be like. With the added bonus of some modern improvements) and it does not FEEL tactical most notably movement and gun play wise. Everything is clunky but I'm sure that its do in part to it being in alpha still.  But then what is up with the amount of gadgets? reduce that stuff.. there are far to many and this is not COD. Also this is not Ghost Recon which is a different side of the R6 family, which allows for that type of game play more.    BUT DON'T MIX THE TWO!  Another issue with this game as it is. I don't fear for my life nor my teammates really at all to be frank there is no tension. Its just another round to me and people just do their own thing for the most part. Especially with the advent of some the mindless cod like rambo bs going on. Barely any one is really thinking things through especially on the Counter Terrorist side for good portions of the matches i played, shit i saw people on stream after i was done playing on the Terrorist side running outside to get kills like wat? (The marked timer does nothing to prevent this).... also the matches are far to short.   Meaning these matches should be lasting 4 to 6 minutes tops  with a slower tick rate clock. (This is not CSGO) Because if this was real life depending on the opponent, situation and the terrorist themselves these engagements would last a little longer then they are right now in the game and different attack patterns would be used mid fight if things did not work out. But instead of that intuitive game play...what we got right now is most players just with the mindset of kill,kill,kill,kill. No real reason to recuse the hostage like in the E3 Game play demo seem to promote so much. Nope just kill all the hostage takers and yeah!! we win and now repeat.  P.S Where is the sweet crisp sound design? where is the boom and crackle of the shotgun or the nasty high pitched rattle of a smg? it all sounds very tame and muddled compared to past titles in the series and to be blunt compared to current FPS shooters even."

Barbed-wire doesn't hurt team Netcode issues (Or I just suck idk) Unlimited Revives OP and need some penalty Strafing is too fast and has no accuracy penalty.  Suggestions: Delayed kill feed More incentive to not camp next to hostage Longer rounds Less ammo More team communication options Map voting or set rotation (I've played Plane 90x more than house)     Likes: Class selection system Destructibility    Verdict:  Call of Rainbow: Modern Siege  *I'm not trying to be a dick but many of us have been waiting for another Rainbow game because we're tired of the CoD clone BS.

Surprisingly, it is a fun and addictive game though it doesn't have the R6 feel mostly due to your list.  It doesn't appeal to the part of me that likes casual COD either though.  It's going to have trouble finding an audience I'm afraid.  I'll post a more in depth list of likes, dislikes, and suggestions in a few days.  For now though, I will add to your list:  Dislike:   Short Rounds.  Class system.  Especially as a new player, I would like to play the same class multiple times in a row to learn it (and possibly to enjoy the game later when I find a favorite).  It would be better to have the standard classes I create and save myself that I can use anytime.  Penalty for going outside if a defender.  Barbed Wire affecting only attackers  Lack of an in-game map.  Lack of single shot selection on guns and large cal weapons (They may be there and I didn't get to them yet).  Lack of WORKING DOORS  Like:   Rappelling System.  It is pretty cool and useful once you get the hang of it (pun intended)."

It's not realistic at all.   While we shouldn't be able to sprint while shooting, It is realistic to be able to shoot a weapon while running (it's a terrible idea as a tactical operator of any type of force), but we should be arguing if it fits in the game or not, which it doesn't."

Rainbow6,31s0du,siegewolf,24,Wed Apr 8 12:03:13 2015 UTC,"So I keep coming back to Siege, hoping the game would prove me wrong and show a ""return to its roots"".  Unless there's some radical changes in this Alpha, I'm not seeing it.   Players are dipping in and out of doorways using strafe keys. No one is actually taking the time to position themselves near a wall and lean into the doorway. Why? Because strafing is fast enough that it gets the job done. Slow down strafing in order to emphasize leaning. On top of that, I'm seeing a lot of players do the following - sprint into a room, spray full auto at an enemy while strafing right and left, continue sprinting. Where else have I seen this kind of play before...? Sprinting has no place in an indoor tactical shooter (also goes back to my point about nerfing strafe). Gunplay is - like I said before - extremely tight and incurs almost minimal penalty for blasting full auto. Hitmarkers should be removed and replaced with a visual cue (maybe the victim winces in pain when shot) The white silhouettes need to go away. I outline why here. Locational damage (arm = reduced accuracy, leg = reduced movement). Players are not nearly fragile enough and as a result some rather mindnumbingly risky plays are allowed to happen. I've seen players sprint blindly into a room, get shot at from the side, and then sprint around the room into cover. If weapon damage was scaled up (and I mean a major damage buff for most weapons), locational damage re-introduced, and sprinting/fast strafing are removed, players will have no choice but to actually be careful of what they're getting into. Maybe they'll try leaning into a room to see what's in there first? Remove the Call of Duty insta-knife button Remove killcams which divulge enemy position information Add in doors (for an indoor counter terror game, I'm surprised this has to even be a suggestion).  Nerf revives. I would love to see this system gone entirely... but if you're going to keep it in, give the player reduced accuracy and reduced movement, with a second downing meaning death. Revives with no physical repercussions further promotes unnecessarily risky gameplay. Revives should only happen once, with a revived player suffering severe accuracy and movement penalties. Or remove it outright. As for leaning, allow players to lean without aiming down the sights. Let players peek into rooms without having the iron sights taking up their view.   Because of all these little things, the concept of ""teamwork"" has changed extremely. Before it used to be that you HAD to stick as a team, or at least with a teammate, because you couldn't one-man-army the game. The extreme fragility of players, limited movement, and punishing recoil really required people to work together, since individually they could get quickly eliminated. You also had to constantly keep tabs of where your teammates were via communication and announce you were entering a same room as them, lest they get jumpy and fire at you thinking you're an enemy.  The tension is all but gone. When you're allowed to sprint through the map, strafe in and out of doorways with the strafe keys, know the position of your allies at all times, and heavily reduce the lethality of weapons in the game, there is really no tension in the game.  What I'm seeing in Siege is a lot of this ""individual mentality"". There is some coordination in the sense that players are telling each other what they're doing, but Siege removed a lot of the lethality of the older Rainbow Six titles and added in design decisions that empower the individual a lot. Almost no one is moving with a teammate. More often than not this is what I'm seeing:  Player 1 rappels and enters the bedroom.  Player 2 will check around the garage.  Player 3 will plant a wall charge next to the kitchen.  Player 4 has a shield and Player 5 will follow him up the stairs (probably the only semblance of squad based teamwork I've seen so far).  Player 3 went down? Well no worries, since Player 2 can sprint around to his position (X-ray vision of a downed teammate helps), revive him, and sprint back to what he was doing.  Of course, it goes without saying that all this is done with players sprinting around, spraying, missing, zooming in while spraying, killing. Sprint into a room, find an enemy, spray at him while strafing left to right, continue sprinting once the enemy's down. Run into an enemy, hit the knife button, knife swings and instakills the guy you ran into."

Players are way too durable. Three bullets should kill under any circumstances. Hitmarkers have to go. Not through the wall - entirely. Class system seems cartoony and poorly thought out. Drones aren't well integrated into the gameplay loop. Play hotwheels for thirty seconds before the shooting starts. Gadgets have poor feedback. Jammer has no way to visualize effect radius, charges can be placed on surfaces that can't be destroyed. Barricading is less about strategic decisions, and more about getting them up as quickly as possible. Getting barricaded in a room with a teammate sucks. Hostage should be relocatable by defenders; make it like hostage rescue, but you can't have a weapon out, and you have to slowly set them down."

Rainbow6,31s0du,Harvey_Dole,6,Wed Apr 8 01:06:15 2015 UTC,"I posted this in another thread, but I think it will do more justice here...  What I would like to see: 1.) Slower strafing and back peddling speeds. This makes leaning very important. Strafing back and forth like Doom 2 is highly unrealistic. Adding a sidestep animation and slowing things down a bit would add more realism. Remember, these guys are wearing body armor and carrying lots of equipment. 2.) Damage effects. Basically when you are wounded, you shouldn't be able to return fire. You should still be able to move, but it should take 1 second to be able to aim your weapon again. This makes you have to duck and hide after taking a wound. 3.) When you are wounded your accuracy should be reduced to around 60% and your speed slightly reduced (limp mode). Once you are wounded, you could heal with (bandages) which will take a few seconds to use and would allow you to gain about 90% of your accuracy back. 4.) Doors. A system like RS where you can open a door all the way or just a crack. You always have the option of busting the door down, but opening the door slightly and chucking a grenade in a room is a good strategy."

They may eventually come to  a room where the hostage is secured with the rest of defenders. There they can time their breach and kill defenders/evac hostage.  I feel that with time the COD players may get owned when teams start moving as a unit and slowing down their pace on their own. This will differentiate the pros from the noobs.  As for game mechanics... everyone knows what needs to be changed."
Rainbow6,31s0du,leteezer,3,Wed Apr 8 05:57:46 2015 UTC,Suggestion: Bigger penalty for team/hostage killing when no enemy is near. Suggestion: Loadout saving Suggestion: Weapon Attachements Suggestion: Add the options menu in the Escape Menu (More organized) Suggestion: Moving hostage around as defender Match pace feels too fast (Maybe people just rushing?) Not very intuitive which walls & floors can be blown up and which can not. Bug:  Breach charges destroying the shield below it even though the explosive doesn't damage the floor. The destruction & barricade system is mostly awesome (See above)
Rainbow6,31s0du,Facerafter,3,Tue Apr 7 21:21:35 2015 UTC,"Hitboxes or Killcams are borked. Half the time I get killed the person who killed me isn't even aiming at me.   There needs to be some sort of hardcore mode where you can't observe teammates and help them.   Shotguns have too much recoil. Other guns have not enough recoil.   There really needs to be a grouping system for a game that relies so heavily on teamplay (I know it is alpha, but still).   Also having to manually select my nvidia card was a pain in the donger."
Rainbow6,31s0du,snifi,3,Tue Apr 7 21:36:55 2015 UTC,"I didn't get into the alpha so I have been watching twitch streams all day. Here are some of my observations:   Most people have already said it and I'll reinforce it, its very Run n Gun. Everyone is exploiting it because it doesn't require any specific skill. I have actually heard people saying ""I am just gonna run into the room and spray"". Not sure why there is a jump cooldown on drones? Hit markers through wall is a very cheap technique in my opinion and must be removed. 3min round is way toooo short. I haven't seen anyone doing any kind of proper planning before the action phase only because there is no time to analyze the situation after you have discovered enemy and hostage locations via drones. The hostage holds absolutely no importance in the game. It could be replaced by a random piece of artifact or a pile of money or even a cat and nothing will change. If the game mode is about rescuing hostage, THE HOSTAGE MUST BE RESCUED to the extraction location. No reviving teammates please. Players must fear for their lives. Most of the broadcasts that I have watched today, I hardly saw anyone having any fear of dying. Most people were simply running into the room and hoping that they will get lucky by spraying bullets around and able to kill the opponents. I hardly see anyone using rappelling. Not sure if this is good thing or a bad thing.   On the plus side, I think the game is really great!! You, Ubisoft have got something that could be a revolution. We have done our part, now its your turn. Its up to you now how you want this game to be. You can either completely/partially listen to our feedbacks or ignore it or whatever. No matter what you decide to do, I will be eagerly waiting here for its final release hoping I will get to play the game I am expecting it to be. I hope you don't disappoint me and several other gamers here."
Rainbow6,31s0du,gonapster,3,Tue Apr 7 20:43:59 2015 UTC,"Alright here's what I think. Some of these may already be posted but anyways.   Push to talk is needed. The outline is not needed, these get in the way a lot of the time. Hitmarkers need to be removed, they take away some of the realism that could be saved, also makes it easy to figure out where to shoot. Doors would add a lot of detail and fun to the game, Intruder has a good system for their doors. The HUD feels really clunky and large. Round Downtime: Between the loading and the scoreboard between rounds, it takes way to long to get to the next round, remove the game ending scoreboard, if players want to check it, most would do so during setup or when they're dead.   I'll add more as I keep playing through the alpha."
Rainbow6,31s0du,JakeDawn,3,Tue Apr 7 22:47:22 2015 UTC,"Matchmaking needs to go, it's a horrible system and inferior to dedicated servers in every way.  Without dedicated servers this game will be nothing more than a speed bump on the way to something better."

Rainbow6,31s0du,Giorgos78,3,Wed Apr 8 04:12:57 2015 UTC,"So I’ve put quite a number of hours into the game and have developed some ideas about some of the game play concepts that I find lacking. I won’t waste too much time in this description but I’d first like to say that I don’t think that this game will get anywhere close to the emulation of game play from the the earlier entries in the Rainbow Six franchise. However, I do think there are changes that can be made to make it a more authentic experience and closer to the original franchise without sacrificing too much of Ubisofts vision of the game. I’m not exactly a Rainbow Six veteran but have fond memories of the original series and have extensive experience in other first person shooters both competitively and casually.   Recoil & Ammo   The first issue when coming to RB6:S is the concept of recoil and firing rate. The current version of the game really lacks any sort of recoil in majority of the weapons. It seriously is pretty much non-existent except for the DMR. The DMR somehow also has more recoil in repeated single shot than all of the automatic guns in the game. This is problematic for two main reasons. The first is that it damages the skill cap necessary to help prolong a healthy skill cap in first person shooters. Anyone who picks up the game will be able to control the recoil with absolute ease thus limiting some of the learning curve of the game. For a game that seems to be pushing itself as a competitive shooter there must be more skill involved in using the weapons. The second is that due to the low nature recoil of the game mixed with too much ammo; it allows players to senselessly spam doors, walls, floors and more without punishment or any sort of recovery time. This means that players can actively switch target to target without any sort of compensation or penalty for their automatic fire.  The ammo issue is simple. Too much ammo allows for too much spamming and doesn’t allow the player to make conscious decisions on if they should conserve or keep shooting. Currently players have enough ammo to pretty much shoot non-stop throughout the round and still have some in reserve. This is bad for people who try to aim their shots and again encourages players to just shoot at everything that moves.   Hitmarkers & Visibility/Models   Hitmarkers are my least favorite game play addition to modern shooters within the last decade (well except maybe killstreaks). Hitmarkers completely destroy immersion, tension and honestly have no place in a shooter like RB6:S. Game play wise hitmarkers allow stupidly easy identification for assessing whether or not you hit your target. For a series that considers itself a tactical shooter this is a no-no. Spamming through walls or smoke and effortlessly killing people due to hitmarkers removes tension and dumb down gameplay for the lowest common denominator. Really they aren’t even necessary considering the game has adopted a CS like kill feed anyway so it’s pretty clear when the enemy has been killed. If you think that people from other modern shooters are going to not buy RB6:S because of a lack of hitmarkers Ubisoft are severely mistaken. I’d rather see hitmarkers replaced with other feedback such as audio cues and possibly more visceral blood splatter.  The second issue in this category is the visibility. The first issue is that there is way too much clutter on the screen and the game lacks any ability to scale the HUD down. There is a lot of redundant features when it comes to the HUD. For example, I don’t need a visual indicator of who’s alive, huge bold letters on my screen of how many people are left, and also a kill feed that tells me who died. These all practically do the same thing and people aren’t so dumb that they can’t figure out most of these things mid-game. There is also the issue of the white blinding borders of nearby teammates which is also another addition to the game which is both unnecessary on the HUD and ruins immersion. If anything the small square border above teammates heads is simply enough to figure out where your teammates are. Although, personally I’d rather there be no visual indicator of where teammates are. It reduces communication and doesn’t promote good team play. The models currently used for both teams are also one of my huge gripes when it comes to visibility. Both teams practically look exactly the same and this can cause a lot of confusion as to who I’m supposed to shoot. There should be clear cut themes of how enemies should look. What happened to the terrorist like figures wearing balaclavas that were clearly identifiable from the E3 trailer? Who and why made the decision that clearly identified teams were a bad idea?    Movement Speed & Health   To put it in simple terms, the movement speed in RB6:S is currently way too fast. Everyone is wearing huge amounts of kevlar and nearly 300 rounds of ammo yet run around like the worlds best 100m sprinters. I feel like I’m watching bees on cocaine zoom throughout the map. The sprint mechanic is problematic for a number of reasons. The first being that it promotes run and gun game play that lacks the charm of games like RB6. Mixed in with the health issue it currently allows you to run into a hail of gunfire and escape death by blindly spraying a non-recoil SMG into the enemy who was tactically holding a corner. The second being that it basically reduces peeking into a pointless mechanic. Why peek around a corner when you can ADAD spam safely and cause your target to miss their shots. Movement overall needs to be slowed to a more tactical pace but especially when aiming. During ADS players should be heavily slowed down giving them increased accuracy but heavily reduced movement speed.  The current fast movement speed encourages game play that is opposite to the core of RB6 games and honestly doesn’t seem to fit in with the concept game play of the original RB6:S trailers.  If you couldn’t tell by the previous paragraph. Health is a big problem within RB6:S. It takes a ridiculous amount of bullets to kill someone when you do not hit them in the head. I’m not sure if it’s an issue with the netcode or the damage of weapons but I’ve easily seen players absorb 6-10 bullets to near half magazines of ammo. Aiming for headshots should be encouraged but there is no reason that a few body shots shouldn’t take out an enemy.    The Planning Phase & Round Timers   The planning phase isn’t much of a planning phase, and the current maps don’t really make much sense in the context of the game. For example, here are screenshots of the current planning map phases. Plane and House Screenshots Why are the prime focuses of the map (the house/plane) so small and so hard to discern important details? The actual game play zone should easily take up 70-80% of the zoomed map space in order to better plan entry areas and where defenders should set up. Another issue on these maps is the inability to draw or make any sort of plan at all where people should go. Some sort of in game pings or the ability to draw on the map would help alleviate some of the boring dead time during the planning phase. One other issue in the planning phase that I feel doesn’t make much sense is the inability for the Blue/CT team to individually pick insertion zones. It often feels like that everyone spawns in the same area and then is forced to run around the target structure to get where they wanted to go anyway. The current favorite seems to be just to pick the most neutral/central area to accomplish this. The current round timers feel a bit too short and force the attackers to work much too quickly to retrieve the hostage. The unlimited barricading in the hands of competent defenders makes it impossible to get through all the doors in-time without getting turned into swiss cheese by a rain of P90 spray.    General Game play Issues/Criticisms (Many of these things are likely to change)   No Push-to-talk key. This one is pretty self-explanatory. A PC game must have a Push-to-talk feature. I’m sure this one is coming but it’s driving me crazy hearing John Smith talk to his entire family, blast music through his speakers, and nom on some doritos over his mic.  The sound of guns seems a little underwhelming. They lack throatiness and boom factor that should be expected in such CQC.  It seems difficult to tell what exactly can be shot through and also what can be breached. The only texture that seems to be universal is the wooden walls, but to my surprise many walls and floors have been destroyable but there isn’t much clear indication that they could be. The heartbeat sensor should honestly be removed. It is incredibly overpowered in it’s current state and I doubt there is any way that it can be balanced properly. From a pure proof of concept the heartbeat sensor is basically a wallhack. This doesn’t really fit in with the ideas of cameras and drones since those require communication between teammates and can be countered. The only thing I can think of is that it could show where people are perhaps every 15-20 seconds instead of the live-update feed that it currently provides.  The shotguns feel under powered compared to the other weapons. I think they should be fairly strong and kill fast but be limited to 1-2 per team. In their current state it feels like they are useless beyond a few feet and that an automatic weapon is better in almost every way.  Load times sometimes feel like they take an eternity.   I think this game has lots of potential and I’m having a lot of fun playing it but there are some core concepts that need to be ironed out for this game to have a strong community and long-term success. Sorry if this comes off as a bit long winded, it took me awhile to collect all my thoughts and hammer out a detailed dialogue. I will likely be adding and editing more to this list as things come up."
Rainbow6,31s0du,Lekcian,6,Wed Apr 8 05:17:51 2015 UTC,"So far, it seems like the gameplay is way to fast for the gadets. To set up remote gass doesn't seem worthwhile, to setup to take a room just takes too long from the times. Since the gameplay seems so suited for run and gun, flashbangs seems very underpowered. The fact that you can see people below/through barricades is just OP for campers, with both that and the deployable shield. Then there is the headbeat monitor, just remove it. It was nefred from the pre-alpha, but is still sooo OP. SMGs and shotguns seems like the way to go, but maybe shotgun damage is a bit low. The DMR just seems useless as everything is on such a short range. I also think they should remove the abillity to prone, as I feel the best strategy for terrorist is just to stack in one room and looking through barricades."

Rainbow6,31s0du,UZI4Y0U,2,Tue Apr 7 20:18:46 2015 UTC,"My feedback is based off what I have seen from the streams.   I feel like the flashbangs are too underpowered. Flashbangs should have a big part in the game and should be regularly used to try and gain a tactical advantage. Maybe the AOE could be increased. Maybe one of the operators unique gadgets could be a flashbang that goes off multiple times when thrown. In the planning phase, the attackers should select their spawn point after they have scouted with their drones. It makes more sense to gather intel first, then select the most appropriate insertion point.   Overall, I think the game looks really fun. Teamwork is definitely going to be a big factor in the final release. However, some things need to be adjusted to promote the use of tactics over run and gun."
Rainbow6,31s0du,capedcrusader93,2,Wed Apr 8 00:10:48 2015 UTC,Yep... just got done playing the alpha for an hour so. I was expecting and hoping for SWAT 4 with massive improvements but am in shock at how horrible this game was. It was like bf4 and cod had a baby on a CQB only game. I have yet to experience moments of such intensity that I experienced in my time playing SWAT 4 from any modern FPS. I was super excited for this one... and feel super let down probably will not be buying RS6 Siege unless it changes drastically. Also it hurts to call this game part of the RS Series.
Rainbow6,31s0du,kithuni,2,Wed Apr 8 03:31:38 2015 UTC,"There are other issues and bugs I've come across, but these to me felt the most important to address.  What I like:   Game type. I love hostage rescue/VIP type scenarios and this game is well suited for it. Destructible environment/breaching charges. This is such a no-brainer, not sure why more games don't do this. Respects the player's time with quick rounds, but not just a total deathmatch. Ease of use of your gadgets, fortifications, etc. The overall concept of the game is very intriguing. You guys are on the right path in this regard.   What I don't like:   Player movement feels ""floaty"" or ""skatey"". I don't feel particularly precise when trying to round corners carefully. I want there to be a bit more weight and precision behind my steps. Even the speed feels a bit off. The animations suggest to me that I should be moving faster than I am, though to be honest I would prefer a little bit slower and deliberate movement when trying to position myself for a room clearing situation. If this means adding some more time on the clock during rounds, I'm okay with this. Weapon feedback is unsatisfying. This is a combination of a few things: weapon firing sounds are very thin and quiet (for all weapons currently), recoil is almost non-existent, and the lack of lethality of the assault rifles feels off. In addition to this, mousing a weapon around feels a little too ""static/stiff"" for lack of a better word. There's little to no sway or fluidity to weapon movement. Player model representations appear or feel to be inaccurate representations of where a player is actually positioned according to the server. This makes itself especially apparent in spectator and killcam modes, but even in normal play I feel like players can start glitching around, or I'm not hitting what I'm seeing. Everything kind of feels a half second behind where it should be, or models aren't facing quite how they should. I don't like being allowed to place breaching charges in places that are indestructible. In full honesty, I'd like them to be able to be placed anywhere and destroy everything, but I'm realistic in my expectations of what can and can't be done at this point in the game.   Some stuff where I know it will be likely to see post-alpha, but just for good measure:   Stance buttons that can be either ""press-and-hold"" or ""toggle-able"". This goes for aiming as well. Push-to-talk / player mute options / microphone test options Server browser / player party options   Overall Opinion  I enjoyed imagining the possibilities of this game once more team/party oriented features are implemented. I really do like the overarching concept and theme of the primary game-mode at the moment. However, I found the destructible parts of the map to be un-intuitive and the core ""feel"" of both the movement and firing mechanics felt very lackluster and unsatisfying. I fully understand some of these issues are purely due to the stage that the game is in, but these are by far the most important things to address before launch imo. Feeling clunky and disconnected from your character in an FPS is a deal-breaker, on top of snappy but static animations, confusing weapon spray patterns, and generally not feeling any excitement when pulling the trigger."
Rainbow6,31s0du,Thronewolf,2,Wed Apr 8 01:20:39 2015 UTC,"There are too much hud helps...remove borders for allies and hit markers ... Gameplay is not much original, it seem like call of juarez: add more recoil for weapons and reduce movements speed for players, specially in ADS"
Rainbow6,31s0du,katanapuffin,2,Wed Apr 8 02:24:27 2015 UTC,"After a few hours of playing and a few more hours of crashes I have formed a pretty consistent opinion of the alpha...   Run-and-gunning wins everytime over tactical play as there is no fatigue or affect on accuracy; strafing is ridiculously fast and that is basically what wins gun-fights combined with spraying bullets through random walls; The netcode is horrendous, watching killcams shows the enemy spraying bullets 20ft from where I am with them crouched behind a wall; Hitmarkers showing up when shooting at or through anything; Round times are way too short for the way people are playing the game; the leaning mechanic happens far too swiftly with people able to lean back-and-forth continuously while spraying bullets in the general direction of the enemy; the terrorists and the CT's look exactly the same; the xray outline of players is distracting as hell and removes almost all instances of friendly-fire; unlimited revives for downed players; all the weapons seem under-powered, especially the shotty's;  absolutely no recoil on any weapon; & the heartbeat sensor is still way OP and needs to be removed or at least nerfed significantly.   Basically I feel like this game is nothing like what we were shown at E3. This has a CoD feel in a CQC setting and I honestly don't like it. It is a bunch of copy and pastes from other franchises making it a hybrid FPS without having it's own real identity and that for me ruins it.   It's fun and it's fast paced so in that regard it's quite good for just a pick-up and play but as someone wanting something remotely close to the earlier R6's this is not the game for me currently, this is even further from the Tom Clancy name than Vegas and Vegas 2 and it virtually requires no tactical thought at all."
Rainbow6,31s0du,Jonesy777,2,Wed Apr 8 05:16:33 2015 UTC,"I managed to play for about an hour or two yesterday evening. While I didn't use the equipment much, I focused more on the shooting and general player movement in the game. So my feedback for now is going to be directed purely at the guns, shooting mechanics, player movement, speed of gunplay, etc.  Gun Mechanics First thing I did was hold down the firing button and unloaded full clips over and over watching the muzzle climb without any recoil compensation on my part...the lift is very minimal...much less than what was shown in the Ubisoft Siege Dev Corner on Recoil. This needs to be determined whether you want the game to be hard or easy. Allowing players to spray with very little penalty at all is just going to eliminate the skill requirement in shooting. In otherwords, do you want shooting to be a main focal point in this game or not? If so, I suggest looking at Insurgency's gun mechanics, they're spot on in my opinion. They punish full-auto sprayers (unless they're super close range) and encourage semi-auto firing or bursting a full-auto.   I didn't see any fire mode selectors on the guns...so everything besides shotguns and pistols is full-auto. It was not difficult at all to manage the recoil...pretty much doesn't exist.   In my opinion, after three rounds have been fired on full auto, my gun should be lifting big time, whether that's realism or not, I don't care, I'm more about creating game balance and a skillful environment.   Player Movement First off, sprinting in this game is actually slow in my opinion...the difference between sprinting and walking is so subtle...it's as if the sprinting is just trying to give you a form of immersion...it barely adds any sense of speed. There needs to be a walking button, so that you can actually walk very slowly, or the base speed needs to be lowered more to create a difference between sprinting and walking.  Those are my thoughts so far. Like I said, I purely was trying to get a feel for what the shooting in this game would be like, and so far I don't think it's all that great honestly. If I had to compare the shooting to another game...I'd have to say it's a cross between Call of Duty and Battlefield, there's hardly any recoil whatsoever. The guns don't have any feeling or weight to them."
Rainbow6,31s0du,TTUVAPOR,1 point,Wed Apr 8 05:21:17 2015 UTC,"I thought the gun mechanics were good,subtly different but familiar enough that other players could pick up and play,remember 1 headshot equals 1 kill so its not like any other of those games apart from insurgency with the oneshot kill."
Rainbow6,31s0du,sonoblink,2,Wed Apr 8 09:58:05 2015 UTC,"It's far too much like Call of Duty for my tastes. I was living the look and feel of Patriots when they showed it years ago, but from what I've played, it's devolved into a more run-and-gun twitch shooter. If there is a hardcore mode that removes the hit markers and the seeing friends through walls, I'm all for it. But right now, it's simply 5v5, one life, last man standing, with a hostage in the middle. I want tactics, not twitch shooting.   I'll update more later."
Rainbow6,31s0du,The_Puppetmaster,0,Wed Apr 8 12:44:09 2015 UTC,"What sets every shooter apart is its own unique gun mechanics siege feels like a new RB6 even at this stage (no auto reload plz).I know where your coming from with the hostage scenario tho,hit markers are not that bad maybe could do toned down a little,it does cheapen the look of the game as is. I always prefered custom loadouts with my fav weapon and gear that suited the map,mode and my playstyle choosing gear between rounds is a waste of time which could be better spent playing or deciding tactics with the team maybe?"
Rainbow6,31s0du,sonoblink,4,Wed Apr 8 15:18:46 2015 UTC,"Having played for about 4h now I can agree with most people here. The pacing of the rounds feels too fast and stressed. My guess would be that the very short 3min timer forces that a little too much. But chances are as soon as the players know the maps better they will be able to work out a good plan in advance and don't have to improvise all the time because a breech charge didn't work as intended.  Little summary:   Round paced too fast Guns are a little too weak (shotguns a lot!) Hearthbeat sensor op Stacking defenders in one room op Hitmarkers are always seen and that's not a good thing Breech charges ain't coherent   Maybe only bugs, but if intended worth noticing: * Killcam makes it seem like bad netcode (netcode feels fine when playing though)   Running matches don't get refilled with players if someone leaves Plane hull and windows are bulletproof.    Suggestions:   Notify the guy with the armor pack to deploy it Buff shotguns Let us save our class settings Weapon attachments A loading screen similar to LoL or Payday so people don't confuse bad game optimization with people trying to run it on   a solar powered potato in their basement Putting up proper defense is pain in the ass. And First selecting where to start as police and then randomly deploy your drones doesn't make any sense at all. Suggestion: First the police only selects where to place their drones then they deploy them at the warm-up phase and after the same time (30-40s) they get thrown back into the voting screen to select a spawn point while the terrorists can finish their defense. To balance barricade spamming just limit their amount (maybe to a at the same time) Add working doors Push to fucking talk. I had one match with a Frenchmen who decided to tell us his life story. Not cool Options menu should not scroll. If the outer right tabs are selected you can't get directly back to the first. There is no close button. Your game is good but that good?   Conclusion: Veeeery close to awesome, keep up the good work!"
Rainbow6,31s0du,Bermos,2,Thu Apr 9 05:35:52 2015 UTC,"Played around 3 hours, here is my feedback so far:  general:   we need push to talk and mute buttons for players.  I would love to increase the FOV, it feels claustrophobic to me right now. textures look super low res (gtx 970), but I didn't spend much time in the options menu. had some graphical problems (e.g. the gas grenades effect was invisible [intended?]) option to toggle or hold aim needed proper leave match and game functionality  start into full-screen option option to remove onscreen helpers (press button X to do Y) leave drones/cameras with all player actions (e.g. click MB, 1, 2, F, etc.) more consistent usage of gadgets (sometimes it's press and click, sometimes hold button)  when dead: switch between players with mouse buttons, a and d is really weird (needs getting used to) netcode improvements needed, a lot of inconsistencies between my experience of the situation and what the kill cam shows. remember class specific loadout    gameplay:   the hostage needs a solid hitbox so the drones can't hide beneath  the hostage should go prone when the action goes down, it's way to easy to cover behind the hostage    Definitely need to play more to give more gameplay feedback. So far it's fun, intense and addictive! It's clear that everyone is still learning while playing, I wonder how intense and fun it is in the long-term.   By the way, whoever says this isn't tactical, hasn't played this enough or alone. I've been stomped by some pretty awesome group plays already. We were defending in the living room,  all windows barricaded and the attention was mainly towards the lobby. Suddenly the big window gets blown out and we receive sniper fire from that free standing elevator thing, two defenders down. Then flash bangs and whatnot and in they storm through the window. The round was over in 10 seconds. It was awesome!!"

I don't demand this game to be a RS(roughspear) because it wouldn't go wide on consoles, but at least you could have given us a R6 Vegas game instead of this CoD, fast passed, lonewolf, heartbeatsensor, stress timer thingy game having a Rainbow Six name.   First off, you are out after a ""Tactical game"" heartbeat sensor have to go asap. I know that you want a ""realistic"" feeling but if so a DOOR is better and give the guy with heartbeat sensor a thing to peek under it, LIKE RAINBOW 6 VEGAS.   Also, if you now plan on having that CoD cloned heartbeat sensor at least make ALL the walls and ALL the roof tiles breakable because otherwise you just have to put up a shield, sit in a corner with your team behind your little wall in a corner that is heavy fortified or not even breacheble and camp the round out with a little heartbeat sensor. FUN? NO , sadly to say ****it ? YES .  Compare it to this: You have one guy guarding the hostages, the other guy peak under the door when he see the whole team coming down the corridor. They blow the wall to the next room and drag the hostages through while at the same time smoking the room that the guy peeked out from. They cops break through the door.... MORE FUN.. And MORE LIKE R6 that face it, A LOT of rainbow 6 fans LOVED.   I can continue. If you now want the wall breaches (that I do think is rely awesome and OK) at least make it synchronized, Lets say you put one up on the wall and you can decide if you want a timer on 3 seconds to start so you can blow it at the same time. You want tactics? That will make this game EXPLODE in tactics! Blow two wholes into a room at the same time, exploding two windows at the same time while team go in below.  Let us split up the team in the beginning, Start in two different places. You talk about how ""scary"" it is in the start of a round and how realistic it sounds. Well guess what, swat teams usually DON'T attack all together, often they attack in TWO TEAMS, so if you want anything more scary then the thing you got... Let us SPLIT UP the team. Then you will have a scary moment hearing the cellar breach, people coming up the stairs when suddenly you see something outside the window repelling down and the little ""thing"" peaking in to the room.(Instead of that f in heartbeat sensor) Rly people, be real here, who was stupid enough to come up with that shit hahaha. Worst thing ever in a game and you decide to have it in R6... I just shake my head and continue  In the menu in the beginning, make it a drawble little map (For PC) players so if you are fast you can draw up a little tactic on the map, For console players it could be as easy as placing down X Y and so on or the counter thing on Ps4 on the map in a different order where the letters correspond 1. Move there. 2.attack  and so on.   TIMER have to go or be pushed up to 10 minutes and question to the devs. Will there be bigger maps? Like indoor hangars or something like that? Or will everything be small and tiny ala nuke map in cod?  What I try to say is, make it like R6 map, BIGGER then these but still have a top.cellar, middle with maybe a floor in the ""Big room"". That is all I could come up with after playing I don't know how much of this alpha and R6 Vegas and i can continute 4 ever and ever ... but i leave the rest up to the other people that writing here also but everything i read that they think need to be fixed i cant agree more on,,, hahaha hitmarkers .. agree on that one 110% ppl :)  Also, I am glad to see that Coop and SP will arrive at a later date. So once again, PLEASE DEVS at least think some of these things over because this is on PAPER tactical, in real mp lobby's where 60% wont use mic or can't or don't have or what ever it will end in lonewolf ala cod style. And PLEASE for the sake of GOD  Take away the 30 sec then you are seen by enemy team if you go OUTSIDE, what the HELL are you thinking? You have to fix this sh*t up ppl because right now, R6 patriots looked way more fun."
Rainbow6,31s0du,YangUnchained,2,Thu Apr 9 06:04:31 2015 UTC,"Here is my feedback, to be edited as I go along  I just got into the Alpha last night, thanks completely to Electr1cpanda.  So I'll give some preliminary thoughts and feedback, and add to it as I go.  Performance   Optimization is clearly unfinished, so I won't comment negatively on it Support for 21:9 Resolutions and an FOV slider is coming? Push to talk needs to be implemented Stability and loading times MUST be improved   Controls   Lean should not be dependant on Aiming down the sights in my opinion. An operator would be able to peek around a corner with the weapon in low-ready Aim down sights toggle would be fantastic The gadget controls are kind of complicated (I'm finding it hard to figure out when and where I can place a jammer as mute, for example) THANK GOD Prone is a thing, I hate games that don't have it. (Cough BF3)   Gameplay  Obviously, this is where it counts the most   Round timer needs to be slightly longer, or have the option to adjust it or remove it entirely. This will promote tactical gameplay Killcams, I am not directly opposed to, but like some other games, they don't show a completely accurate representation of what should have happened. This is probably a server side issue that affects the game and hit registration as a whole. Could be improved? You can see people's equipment through walls, which obviously needs to be adjusted somehow Hit markers need to be optional for the casual crowd, but turned off by default (imo) The character movement feels too... slide-y, not to mention the ridiculous drone controls lol The hostage plays a minimal role at the moment. Every game might as well be team deathmatch around a specific room. There should be, imo, a hardcore mode (or server options) that would disable the time limit, disable hitmarkers, and force all players to play as recruit to balance every player. There are no Terrorists (OPFOR)? Is this a permanent design decision like in Medal of Honor: Warfighter? Or is it just something that exists in the Alpha only? I find Ash's concept ridiculous. Not the fact that she's a woman, the fact that a woman is a class. We have a class named Sledge that uses a hammer, a class named Mute that jams communications, and a class of character named Ash who's actual name is presumably Ash; forget grenadier or demolitions lol.  Edit: I just figured out that they're all specific characters (not 'classes' per se), and that their class names are actually their nicknames. This, I assume, would offer some personal touch to the game like having Ding and Loiselle in the original Rainbow team. Still, I feel like this isn't exactly explained very well. Maybe it's just me though lol."

Rainbow6,31s0du,someolddoge,0,Fri Apr 10 06:50:37 2015 UTC,"Don't think I've played enough to warrant commenting on gameplay itself but a few things I noticed:   Obviously open mic is a problem atm. Even if you make it PTT on UPlay the game overrides it. Additionally, muting voice chat sound sometimes doesn't work and you can still hear people's comm's regardless. (One more thing: allow the use of side-mouse buttons for PTT) Not sure if my client is just glitched but there's no exit game anywhere to be found (have to force-quit every session). Game doesn't seem to utilize multiple cores and end up bottlenecking on one. (optimization issue obviously in the backburner) Alt-tabbing makes the game go to windowed mode and needs to be changed back in video settings every time. Obviously I have no idea what the design philosophy behind R6 Siege is but Killcam's and, to an extent, hitmarkers seem a bit out of place. Peeking (Q, E) control feels a bit clunky at the current state. Perhaps allow the use of leaning without iron sights?   Overall I've enjoyed my session on R6S so far and see a lot of great potential given that enough variety of maps and classes are in the pipeline."

The first point is I have always seen the game as a stealth tactical game, meaning you can't rush into a room and spray and pray. The second point I would like to make is having to aim down the scope to secure kills, as on the vegas franchise the main method of shooting was sprint shotting (which I really enjoyed). The third point I would like to make is the added element of drones at the beginning of the round removes the camping element of the game. The camping element of the old games I felt was important to the gameplay as it made it possible to clutch in a sticky situation. (also bring back thermal vision :P)"

Even back in Raven Shield armor actually acted as armor and not as a health modifier. Health itself was extremely fragile.   Although this is a very valid point (and I myself want to see the return of magazine-based ammo management), I feel there's other ""more pressing matters"" for Siege at hand - mainly the movement and shooting design decisions that allow run and gun strategies to proliferate. As well as infinite revives that don't physically penalize players who go down. Basically pretty much the entire game direction at the moment."

You're not magically sending more information from clientside to serverside by doing this. It's the difference between having the damage model serverside being:  Test the hit against its respective body part hitbox, take into consideration the bullet property, and deal X number of damage (the current model)  VS  Test the hit against its respective body part hitbox, take into consideration the distance between shooter and victim, bullet property, and victim's armor and roll a hit or no hit (old model).   Rainbow Six used to do this. Mil Sims like ARMA do this. Don't tell me this somehow magically became ""difficult"" as technology advanced. Going the unrealistic route was a design choice by the devs."

Modern plates in body armor can take at least 3 7.62x51 shots at point blank. Of course those plates usually just cover most of the area containing the vital organs, the gut and upper torso around the neck and shoulders are still exposed but it'd be hard to model those hitboxes"

But the fact is and stays, Alpha tests are there to test stuff that the developers wouldn't notice that quick. It's standard things like that, which IMHO should just be in there. For the sake of testing it complete. It's a team based game, but why ignore the fact that every game has a lobby, but hey let's not put that in on Alpha for this game."
Rainbow6,31ruz2,Dekcolnu,2,Tue Apr 7 19:27:46 2015 UTC,Couldn't tell you the last alpha or beta that had forced open mics. Which is more then enough 'backup' if you ask me.

Rainbow6,31ucch,kinggibbon,1 point,Wed Apr 8 15:23:31 2015 UTC,"I actually did get in yesterday.   The brutal truth from me is that,it is fun. That is what hurts for me. It is decently fun,painfully average fun. But i know that,if they changed some things,little things,it would be SO much better.   Even changing the rival teams look (no GSG9 vs SWAT,but terrorist or paramilitary looking guys vs SWAT/GSG9) would bring a very positive change for an almost non-existent level of work.   However as they said they are going to have a ""Hardcore"" mode,so maybe depending on how that looks i would get the game. But without it being like an actual R6 game,no sir.   I can go to my cheap trusty CS:GO for the experience they are currently aiming for. Either change it up a bit or there will be no reason to buy it."
Rainbow6,31u9em,Nick-A-30,3,Wed Apr 8 04:58:22 2015 UTC,"Nope! Never preorder games!  And especially not Ubisoft games. Sorry guys, but you have the reputation for a reason."
Rainbow6,31u9em,Txontirea,4,Wed Apr 8 15:13:22 2015 UTC,"I won't be preordering this one. They have the severely change the game to make me want to even continue to play it. I just don't think it's going to happen either. Characters need to be slowed, guns need to pack more punch, heartbeat monitor needs to be nerfed hard or needs to go, leaning while not ADS, the guns need to actually recoil, the hit markers need to go, and the confirmed kill either needs to be toned down or removed entirely. A game stops being ""tactical"" when your best course of action is to just blindly fire through objects in hopes of seeing a nice flash of hitting someone or straight up seeing their death show up."
Rainbow6,31u9em,siegewolf,2,Wed Apr 8 05:35:56 2015 UTC,"No. Never played an R6 game before, and this is completely uninspired and bland. Has horrible netcode. I'll put half a mag into someone only to be one shot while their looking 90 degrees left of where I am."

Rainbow6,31u9em,deadpandave,1 point,Wed Apr 8 10:47:56 2015 UTC,"I pre-ordered it as soon as was possible after it was announced as I've been a long time fan of the Rainbow series since the original. Whilst obviously disappointed not to have made it into Alpha, I've used my pre-order code for the beta access so I'm tied into buying it now. Clever from Ubisoft! However, I am a little disappointed so far after watching some of the streams and in agreement with many of the points raised here and on the forum regarding the speed of play and lack of tactics.  However, I do realise it is Alpha, so will continue to keep an eye on progress and changes, and see how responsive Ubisoft are in making tweaks to improve overall gameplay - and I'll participate in the Beta when my time comes and form my own opinion at that time."
Rainbow6,31u9em,notimeforname,-3,Wed Apr 8 11:26:51 2015 UTC,"I personally love it. People who think it's like COD because it's a little faster in terms of gameplay need to open their mind a bit.   There is so much room for being tactical, and knowing where to go and how to go there always beats running and gunning.  The biggest issue I have right now is the character models. The 2 teams are absolutely the same, it's ridiculous to me how the devs decided not to make the character models visually different between the two teams.   A few tweaks on how the drones and barricades work, and with the VOIP and this already a great game."
Rainbow6,31u9em,siegewolf,4,Wed Apr 8 05:10:10 2015 UTC,"It's because the guns have no recoil, the players move fast, run and gun is good, and everyone is a bullet sponge. It's more than just ""it's a little faster."" Many of the aspects that make the game feel less tactical and more like a TDM are due to the game being CODified.  I haven't found a single reason to actually rescue the hostage. The nice thing about getting a hostage in CS:GO was because it provided a lot of money for doing so. Nothing here in terms of benefits."
Rainbow6,31u9em,BlueJimmyy,2,Wed Apr 8 05:32:41 2015 UTC,"First ever game I played it went down to 1 on 1 and I had no idea where the last defender was, so I picked up the hostage and walked him out and that meant we either won (which we did) or otherwise brought him out of hiding.  Also a few rounds have ended now with the hostage being killed, which helps people watch their fire when entering the hostage room or defending it once it's been breached.  It CAN be used, but just not anywhere near as often as I would like."
Rainbow6,31u9em,notimeforname,-3,Wed Apr 8 06:39:55 2015 UTC,"Ok the guns do have recoil though yes it can be increased, this is a balance issue that is easily fixed.    You need to stop using COD as an argument.    Many of the aspects that make the game feel less tactical and more like a TDM   You have to list those aspects if you want me to respond do that.   The only reason running and gunning might have some sort of success at the moment is because people are still barely discovering the game, nobody knows the routes and nobody has any tactics in mind so its a bit chaotic right now. Plus not many people are communicating.   THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL, a team of people running around randomly can beat a team that is communicating, and knows where they are going and how they are getting there.   It doesn't matter how fast someones reflexes are, if I'm moving the right way and I have my team with me they are not going to kill me.     I haven't found a single reason to actually rescue the hostage.   How about the fact that it wins you the round?   There is a lot of room for tactical play, teams can go all 5 players together, they can split into a 2 and 3, they can split in to 2-2-1, they can go in almost countless ways. You just need to have players communicating and knowing how to play the game."
Rainbow6,31u9em,siegewolf,3,Wed Apr 8 06:02:45 2015 UTC,I'm going to keep using the argument because it feels so incredibly similar to COD that it's the only thing I can think of when playing it.  As for the hostage. Nope. No reason. The maps are too small for someone to successfully get a hostage out unless there is some crazy fluke and again there is no actual reward beside winning. I win if I kill the other team too. There is just no actual advantage to worrying about the hostage. Nothing that can set you up better for the next round. Again why I bring up CS. Capping a hostage next you a large sum of cash that can really help your team in weapon load outs which gives you an upper hand. The risk/reward for saving a hostage is totally off. As in....there is no reward.
Rainbow6,31u9em,random63,3,Wed Apr 8 06:13:45 2015 UTC,I would suggest that picking up the hostage stops the countdown. this forces at least some counterplay for the defenders.
Rainbow6,31u9em,notimeforname,-3,Wed Apr 8 10:34:14 2015 UTC,"There is just no actual advantage to worrying about the hostage   If you don't think winning the round gives you an advantage we really are in a different wave length here. You don't need anymore advantage than being 1 round up on the enemy team.   Ok in cs go you get more money, so what happens when you get more money? You are more likely to win the next rounds. So the entire goal is to win rounds. That's why you have the hostage there.   Plus how about the imbalance that creates in CS:GO, you can snowball a lead like that, if you win the first round now you have a significant advantage, you are not only 1 round up but you have better weapons.  Why rescue to hostage? Well because you don't want to be chasing down the remaining couple of guys before the 3 mins are up. For someone who is talking so much about tactical play you should know by know that in certain situations it's better to grab the hostage to lure the enemy team out of hiding.   it feels so incredibly similar to COD that it's the only thing I can think of when playing it.   And you can't tell my why it feels that way. I think there is just a big circle jerk going around here over hitmarkes and the HBS so now people just refuse to give the game a chance over these 2 simple things.   To me it feels nothing like COD."
Rainbow6,31u9em,BlueJimmyy,0,Wed Apr 8 06:21:34 2015 UTC,"I was worried that they'd ruined the philosophy of the game. I've now played it and realised they haven't. This guy clearly hasn't played COD because compared to that this game is very very slow paced.  The 'sprinting' is slow, the one life makes it intense and as I said before in this thread the hostage does matter.  Sadly I think people like this had made their mind up about this game before it was even released as an alpha and refuse to even thing about changing their mind :/"
Rainbow6,31u9em,random63,2,Wed Apr 8 06:45:20 2015 UTC,Compare the alpha with the E3 footage. It's clearly much faster paced - no recoil - bulletsponges - Shorter rounds - less tactical (no hostage has been moved in any match I have seen).  Sure it's not as fast as CoD. But CoD has bigger maps and gadgets designed for that gameplay.  The E3 set a tone that many deemed perfect (slow - tactical - tense) and with the alpha they just went the direct opposite.
Rainbow6,31u9em,siegewolf,0,Wed Apr 8 11:46:57 2015 UTC,Snowballing a win is actually the point...that's why actually protecting the hostages is important. It's part of the reason why CS:GO is a successful professional level competitive game.
Rainbow6,31u9em,blkmmb,0,Wed Apr 8 12:52:30 2015 UTC,"Prelude : This is an Alpha Testing phase, a real one not to be confuse with the recent early access craze. It is only a tiny portion of an unfinished game with the purpose of testing the general gameplay. So every minor annoyance and bugs are expected to be reported, but shouldn't be more than a thought in the back of your head. Bug testing is for the Beta test, the real one.  No one should make a decision on pre-ordering the game with only being able to play the alpha and even less with only the footage of streamers(which most of them don't even try to play the game right, i saw 5 since launch and they gave me heartburn and headache :P)  That being said, I am pleasantly surprised with the gamemode so far, the matches are quite fair and it never felt unbalanced. Team who try to just run in gun blazing, usually met their demise when the defenders were communicating and using strategy.  TL;DR : This is a real Alpha and no judgement should be made on pre-ordering or not, especially if you only watched footage of the slight piece of game we have in our hands.  STL;DR : No and most probably."
Rainbow6,31rm9z,Rakunvar,3,Tue Apr 7 16:59:07 2015 UTC,Ill give this a try. The way it is configured right now is a mess with the mic. they really should put either a ptt function in or something more.

Rainbow6,31rczn,PixelRocket,1 point,Tue Apr 7 22:58:34 2015 UTC,I couldn't be any more disappointed. As a previous QA tester in out of high school; and someone whose participated in hundreds of pre-release builds over the years since then; this is by far one of the ugliest things I've ever seen out of a 'AAA' company.  Matchmaking with open mics ; no way to stop it  'Netcode' is impossible to play on  Killcam doesn't work properly  Voiceover in beginning and end of round doesn't work properly  Menus are an absolute atrocity to navigate with  After about 8 games I alt/tabd and closed out of Uplay.
Rainbow6,31rczn,lionkolla,2,Tue Apr 7 23:16:06 2015 UTC,If you're a QA tester then you should understand that Alpha can mean different things depending on the company. Most of what you listed is trivial compared to the other aspects of the game.
Rainbow6,31rczn,Lackest,0,Tue Apr 7 19:58:54 2015 UTC,Closed alpha that sent out publicly; and has no NDA is incredibly different then in house alpha stages. Any AAA company that releases anything to the public - with no NDA; does it for publicity and usually network testing; there are very few companies that allow the outside in at the true 'alpha' stage.   You're obviously never been in QA or you would understand the difference.
Rainbow6,31rczn,Benjyyyy,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:35:31 2015 UTC,"You should also understand that a majority of what is going to be publicized will be gameplay and not menus. It's far more important to have polished gameplay than polished menus. I am sure you are familiar with deadlines. They got done with what they could before the deadline. They focused on the core stuff. Having an NDA in these stages of testing are useless anyways with such a large and public test group, stuff would be leaked anyway."

I've been playing Rainbow Six since I first picked up the first console version on N64, then I found PC gaming around the same time I started playing SWAT 3 back in 99'.  It's a completely different game style than what we're used to from older games in the series.  I think it's something fresh that COULD become something fun. Let's hope they make major changes to this before it comes out in October.....if not...then I might go play The Division with friends instead.  Once they make changes I feel like it could be a SWAT 4/ Rainbow Six Vegas love child. I would hope so.  Let's not flame..."

FBI HRT would probably leave stuff like suspects barricaded in a house with a hostage to SWAT (your normal police SWAT), but if it were a high risk hostage (diplomat, president, senator, representative) I could see them taking over."
Rainbow6,31qpxk,rzepdom,2,Tue Apr 7 17:03:30 2015 UTC,"Realistically speaking, the FBI HRT has the highest tactical responsibility. Police SWAT deals with regular break ins, search and seizures, etc. There is also FBI SWAT which is higher than regular Police SWAT. Above that is a group called Enhanced SWAT which is higher than FBI SWAT. Above all, is of course the FBI HRT which are prepared for any dispatch around the clock 24/7 and with the most rigorous requirements and duties.   TLDR: the order from bottom to top is Police Dept. SWAT, FBI SWAT, Enhanced SWAT, FBI HRT.   Also, some tactical Army forces such as Delta Force are NOT permitted to be deployed on U.S. soil.

So when you get killed it looks like he is killing you through a wall but really he is just invisible to you and shoots you right in the face. It is a bug so dont worry.

Rainbow6,31sq1n,pachifanclub,2,Tue Apr 7 21:36:32 2015 UTC,"What I loved about this match (one of ~50 I got to play today) is that it wasn't super rushed that ended in a 10 second firefight like so many of the others had been. Granted part of that is players learning the map(s). I do like the revive system (as long as not dead), I hope that the destruction is a little more open (I feel there should have been a hole where the thermite was placed toward the end of the clip), and few other suggestions (posted in the description of the vid but common to most players I met today: non-existent recoil, having a push-to-talk, etc). Through and through I would say this is definitely a nice foundation for an alpha and would definitely like to see a lot of open feedback from devs and exchange with the community."
