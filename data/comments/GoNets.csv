GoNets,3e45wx,Kn0ck0uTPT,4,Tue Jul 21 20:52:54 2015 UTC,If he gets the PT! Hopefully one of our PF/C rotation players has a great year.
GoNets,3e45wx,Cookie3215,10,Tue Jul 21 21:49:05 2015 UTC,Proving all the doubters wrong. Everyone on r/nba is thinking they're lottery bound but I ready for them to be proved wrong. We have a solid group of guys and I'm pumped to see them play together this year.
GoNets,3e45wx,Joshy_G,7,Tue Jul 21 21:57:16 2015 UTC,Mainly the Celtics fans who say something in every thread about the nets no matter what the thread is about. All I care about it making sure they don't get a lottery pick.
GoNets,3e45wx,Ytiradilos,8,Tue Jul 21 22:02:47 2015 UTC,"It's kind of sneakily depressing being a Boston fan right now. Free agents literally will not give them the time of day. The most exciting part of their franchise right now is their shot at 2 lottery picks, so they're super annoying in basically any thread that mentions Brooklyn."

I remember that one thread about Thad being paid 4yr/50 and it was ""BILLY KING LMAO"" with upvotes galore.   The funniest though was when someone made a thread about subreddits hating /r/nba and the OP couldn't find anything from our subreddit and I just remember thinking wtf, we literally trash /r/nba almost every other thread.   Anyway, I'm probably biased but, I see them winning 42-45 games next year."
GoNets,3e45wx,Kn0ck0uTPT,6,Tue Jul 21 23:26:39 2015 UTC,"I remember that thread. In true /r/nba fashion, little to no research done before declaring a statement that they think might be true."

People say we're super boring or that no one could possibly enjoy watching the team play. I think that's stupid. There's a lot of fun stuff to look forward to this year.  Oh and making the playoffs and not giving the Celtics a lottery pick 😆
GoNets,3e45wx,layzbean,5,Wed Jul 22 02:47:05 2015 UTC,See if JJack is ready to fill the starting position and show us what he did in the playoffs
GoNets,3e45wx,BasedGodProdigy,4,Tue Jul 21 22:03:41 2015 UTC,I am excited for a full season of Brook and Thad together. Another year of comfortability for Bojangles and watching our new young guys develop.
GoNets,3e45wx,Loupy_e,4,Tue Jul 21 22:01:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah man, really seemed like our team was starting to jel nicely since the arrival of Thad. I think we went something like 17-15 or 18-14 or something like that. While not eye popping, its a great record to build upon and have some momentum going into this season imo.  Now that Brook is out of Lionel's doghouse and it seems like they are going to mesh well finally, I hope Brook becomes the unquestioned leader of this team, and I'm hoping for his game to elevate accordingly. We might not see 27/9/2 every game like he did the last 30 games or w/e, but I expect him to continue to play at an elite level with a newfound leadership role."
GoNets,3e45wx,FriendlyBanana,3,Tue Jul 21 23:30:20 2015 UTC,"Having young, athletic, hungry, mid to high ceiling dudes that want to play here. All of whom have something to prove and aren't totally jaded by nba 7ife  and stardom just yet. It feels like it's been a long long time since we've had a court full of guys going 100% every night. Don't want to be a downer but I think there will be some growing pains to start the season but I think the recovery will be quicker then it has been the past couple of season. Looking forward to the ups and downs man....anybody know how many days are left until preseason?"

GoNets,3dsja0,layzbean,6,Sun Jul 19 01:11:58 2015 UTC,"Ian Eagle has really great insight. He spoke about the D-Will buyout a week or two before the Nets actually did it. I disagree about the JJ off the bench part, but I think I understand why he would. Joe has played a TON of minutes in his career and coming off the bench may not be a bad idea considering the leadership and scoring the bench lacks at this point."
GoNets,3dsja0,ihavepaper,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:02:20 2015 UTC,"If we are going to be playing through Thad and Lopez down low, wouldn't it make sense to have them play with our best shooter? It feels like its starting lineup argument between Jack vs. Johnson and to me, that's a no brainer isnt it?"
GoNets,3dsja0,ihavepaper,2,Sun Jul 19 22:40:21 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I agree: Joe is an undisputed starter and probably the most consistent.  But to have a balanced team? Joe off the bench or at least having Joe play a majority of his minutes with the bench squad makes a ton of sense. Jack will have the ball in his hands a ton and as much as he is a headache at some points, he's capable of creating his own shots and also will have Thad and Brook to fall back to. With the bench, assuming Larkins is the backup, he'll have an easy time distributing and deferring to Joe if he can't get anything done."

From the bench we get rebounding from Reed and T-Rob or shooting from Bargs and rebounding from T-Rob + Joe who can score easily and has Markel for defense or Ellington for shooting and a bit of D, also Shane who can speed up the floor and maybe use picks with T-Rob and/or Bargs for his shooting."

GoNets,3dqlru,passthefancy,7,Sat Jul 18 14:31:02 2015 UTC,Its all about Boatright for me. Im on that bandwagon for now.
GoNets,3dqlru,AgentZeroGA,4,Sat Jul 18 16:29:48 2015 UTC,"I would be completely open to it and welcome it with open arms. I think this up coming season he will be used as a energetic point guard defender and running pick and rolls with lopez, using his pace to get to the bucket whilst sitting bogdanovic and johnson on the wings. I like the rumours of johnson moving into the second unit off the bench. With him on the floor he can spread it out for larkin to get to the rack. Whilst robinson crashes the offensive boards."
GoNets,3dqlru,SirWilshere,2,Sat Jul 18 15:43:40 2015 UTC,"Shane is a quick point guard who does really well in the pick and roll, something that Brook Lopez abused in the Post All Star Game with Deron, only by that I'm really excited about him. I hope however that he controls his speed so he doesn't turn the ball over so many times when he attacks the rim."
GoNets,3dqlru,Kn0ck0uTPT,2,Sat Jul 18 16:01:20 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with this. He has a very good assist to turnover ratio and seems to be a very willing passers. I'm honestly not that high on boatwright, but the starter this season should be either of those two. Not Jarret jack."
GoNets,3dqlru,MaroonMarble,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:01:41 2015 UTC,"Loved the Larkin pickup... During his draft I became hopeful that he would drop to us. I figured his amazing athleticism would be a boon to our club and was especially bitter when we lost him to Atlanta on a pick we traded to them... But we did get plums that draft, who was great for us and added much needed athleticism himself! I feel like we got someone who I felt we should have gotten 2 years ago. His style is perfect for the pick and roll we should be running with Brookie monster that worked so well at the end of last year. I think he'll be a great fit, I'm mega excited about this!"

GoNets,3dji6h,doktrj21,2,Fri Jul 17 03:19:06 2015 UTC,"I'm getting different information from different sites BUT I think we have 13 rostered players with guaranteed contracts that will count towards our cap. We have a handful of partially guaranteed contracts but I think it's safe to assume Boatright will make the cut. So that's 14 spots accounted for. That leaves one spot for one of: Earl Clark Qunicy Miller Markel Brown Cliff Alexander I think Clark is absolute garbage so right now...I think it's a race between my boy Brown and Cliff. It's going to be an interesting training camp, that's for sure. There's a good chance I messed this up so if I have it wrong someone please correct me."

GoNets,3dji6h,raffathon,2,Fri Jul 17 03:39:14 2015 UTC,"I'm counting fully guaranteed contracts for next season. By my count the 13 are (from sportrac.com & hoopshype.com): JJ/Larkin Bogs/Ellington/Karasev JJ/RHJ Thad/Robinson/McCullough Lopez/Bargnani/Reed Markel's contract, according to sportrac.com, is basically structured like Cory Jefferson's was. The team has certain deadlines to cut them or the player is owed a certain amount of money. Now what I'm not sure about is if McCulllough takes up a spot if he's ruled out for the year. Do we just retain his rights? I'm also not sure if they cut Karasev, if his salary counts towards the cap. Last number I saw, Nets were under the tax threshold by under a mil and he's owed a mil and change. Now Karasev hasn't seen the floor much but he's touted as a shooter, from what I remember. He's on a very reasonable contract and also younger then Brown. I don't want to see him go (serious, I love the kid)...but I think there's a very good chance Brown doesn't make the team....of course you bring him into training camp but...i dont know man..I hope his jump shot has improved. His roster spot might be in jeopardy."

Denver doesn't want him around for a reason: he causes a lot of trouble off the court and in the locker room, something you don't want around your young guys.   Considering we just got rid of DWill reportedly for both of these reasons, I can't see any reason to go after Ty Lawson even if he's waived."

GoNets,3d9ue6,jaywords,3,Tue Jul 14 18:37:41 2015 UTC,"I was digging around for more info on Lawson and came across a relevant quote from Chauncey Billups about whether or not Denver should trade Ty:    ""Yes. I think so. I mean, well, one, Ty, he has not demonstrated what you want from the leader of your team and a guy who they’ve handed the keys to. He’s not demonstrated the kind of leadership that you want. And you have a young kid named [Emmanuel] Mudiay coming in who I think has a chance to be a star in this league. Right now the best player on the team is Ty Lawson. As a young player in the league, you come in 19-20 years old, you oftentimes try to emulate some of the actions on the floor and off the floor of the best player because that’s one day what you want to be. So I think just from the standpoint of the welfare of Mudiay and the well-being and the growth of Mudiay, you have to get Ty Lawson and you have to move him along."" I think I'll pass. link"

GoNets,3d9ue6,bbch1,2,Tue Jul 14 22:05:52 2015 UTC,"Sure, I'd take Lawson over Jack/Larkin/Boatright, but we'd have to make some form of package. Even buying low; most teams would be able to outbid us with assets. Also, I feel that Ty would really benefit from playing for a coach like Hollins."

He's a good player in the right system and I think Coach Hollins could whip him into shape, similar to how Roy Williams did it (if I'm not mistaken, Ty did get a DUI while at UNC though).

GoNets,3d9xyj,imn8bro,5,Tue Jul 14 17:24:33 2015 UTC,"Optimistic: Larkin shows vast improvement allowing us to trade Jack for a future pick, McCullough recovers completely to form a devastating 3 man combo among the bigs. Nets back in to the playoffs and put up a good fight against the top seed before losing.   Nets realize they don't really have a chance at top FAs, instead quickly strike and sign second-tier stars to team-friendly contracts. McCullough becomes a force inside in his second year, while Brook Lopez remains healthy and solidifies his spot as top 5 back-to-the-basket big man in the NBA. Nets replace Joe Johnson with a defensive-minded outside shooter to pair with RHJ. They end up 3-5th in the East, make it to the ECF at least. Team's core is Brook, Thad, McCullough, Larkin RHJ and aforementioned SF signing. Brooklyn is pumped up to follow a young, athletic team.  Pessimistic: McCullough's leg injury erases his 1st year, and he struggles to catch up. Nets flounder without a true PG as Jack hoists mid-range-jumpers and Larkin turns it over more than he gives assists. The defense is a gaping hole as Brook Lopez blows out his leg and is never the same. The Celtics select their next HOFer with our #1 overall pick.  Johnson and Jack leave, the Nets spend all their time chasing Durant and Conley before being left at the altar. To please Prokhorov, they overspend on an aging player, and trade RHJ and draft picks for another. They finish 2016-2017 season in the basement, but the Celtics get their 1st rounder in the swap, leaving us the Celtics pick in the mid 20s. And the carousel goes round and round..."
GoNets,3d9xyj,Nebkreb,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:30:23 2015 UTC,That last bit made me shutter. Hoping the front office learned a bit from this last ordeal and decides to build from the ground up.
GoNets,3d9xyj,theinfamouspt,2,Wed Jul 15 04:53:45 2015 UTC,"Next summer, the Nets need to throw everything at Conley/Durant and hopefully fill the roster in with the large amount of good B-term players.   RHJ and Bogs should blossom/improve and let's see if Thad and Brook can gel in a full season. Then, our PG situation is pretty bad, but maybe we can pull a package for a decent PG during the season?"
GoNets,3d9xyj,theinfamouspt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:41:24 2015 UTC,With so many teams being able to offer max contracts I doubt we can reel in Durant but that would be pretty spectacular. Who do you think will step up as a team leader among the current rostered players next year?

GoNets,3d8g4q,blamedwight,-1,Tue Jul 14 11:32:31 2015 UTC,you must think SL is just tryouts. It's not.  Plenty of players that are roster locks play in SL to work on their game.

GoNets,3d8g4q,Joshy_G,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:18:36 2015 UTC,Wikipedia states that it is usually just rooks and sophomores. No rule that limits who plays. So to answer your question the nets must feel like he doesn't need to try out for the team and will have a spot regardless.

Purely for the rush of nostalgia, I wanted that to happen. I don't remember what happened from it, and it wasn't even that great of an idea for the Bucks.

He had those two knee surgeries, he and George Karl didn't really get along, he seemed to become a bit more troubled in regards to his behavior.

GoNets,3cxu6b,FriendlyBanana,3,Sat Jul 11 19:19:16 2015 UTC,If anything there may be a more unified voice in the locker room. He may have been dragging down the team with his negativity. We could really use a KG again to pump the team up.   No championship this year but we are getting re-positioned to do something next summer. Although it's going to have to come from free agency a healthy and beastin Brook Lopez may entice some free agents to hop onboard (if Brolo doesnt go down again). Depending on how JJ and Brolo play we could make the playoffs again. Its the east after all.
GoNets,3cwlxq,laboratory_koala,3,Sat Jul 11 12:02:37 2015 UTC,"Ok, hear me out. Would it be ridiculous to start RHJ? Like you said, our starting lineup will be offensively sound but we'd be pretty terrible defensively. RHJ is already showing off how active his hands are and his ability to stay in front of his man."
GoNets,3cwlxq,BasedGodProdigy,3,Sat Jul 11 17:07:17 2015 UTC,"We started looking like a real team again last year when we put markel and thad into the starting lineup. That defense and hustle completely changed our teams personality. So, as much as I like bojangles and Joe, I would hope Ellington and especially brown and RHJ get big minutes. Unfortunately Brown and RHJ both lack a reliable outside game, so while you could pair them with Ellington potentially, they can't really play next to each other until they get a more reliable jumper.   I think Jack/Wayne/Joe/Thad/Brook is our best starting lineup, but with RHJ being the 6th man (especially with Joe getting older, I'd rather have him playing fairly light minutes). Bojan and Brown both deserve minutes too, but unless Brown can make the move down to pg someone is gonna be the odd man out.   EDIT after thinking about it more, I agree with you. As soon as he's ready, RHJ should be the starter next to Wayne or Bojangles. That way Joe, who has a ball stopping ISO playstyle, can be the big bench scorer without ruining the flow of our offense (and taking looks from brook). That might be taking too much of our offense off the floor though, we'll see."
GoNets,3cwlxq,Nebkreb,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:13:58 2015 UTC,"Ideally yes we would start him. But his best position is SF, where we need to play Joe. We can't play big and move Joe to PF cause we need Thad and Brook up front. So unless RHJ can transition to SG (very very unlikely) he pretty much has to come off the bench."
GoNets,3cwlxq,FriendlyBanana,3,Mon Jul 13 01:41:29 2015 UTC,"The only thing I'm absolutely sure about is that Joe, Thad, and Lopez will be part of the starting lineup once the season starts. Bojan was a starter during the playoffs, but whether he'll be back as our primary bench scoring option or a complimentary starter will remain to be seen.  As you have said, though, this season is going to be used for development, and I think both management and Hollins know that. I wouldn't be surprised if Larkin and Karasev are logging major minutes one night and Boatright and Markel another."
GoNets,3cwlxq,abresler,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:19:38 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Joe probably isn't a part of the teams future after this season though, so I would like to see the other wings we have get plenty of run so they can take over by next season."
GoNets,3cwlxq,SirWilshere,2,Sat Jul 11 23:19:40 2015 UTC,"Intrigued, super hard to tell and much of it hinged on injuries to us and out opponents but I don't buy into the negativity I see in alot of places.  People also assume that moves like Monta Ellis to Indiana make that team better, they MAY but people lose site of system and fit which for moves like Monta to Indiana may utterly fail.  I like our ""fit"" moves, especially guys like Trob, Ellington and Larkin.  I love Bojan and expect alot from him.  Healthy Thad/BLO is as good of a front court as you have certainly in our division and maybe the east.  Nerves are about Jack.  I'd love to trade him and pieces for Ty Lawson but assuming no movement I really really hope we see Atlanta playoffs Jack that passed and made plays not regular season chuckster Jack.  Hollins MUST keep him on a tight leash playing PG finding Brook with pick and rolls, moving the ball and so on.  Next season should be the most interesting yet in BKN and we may be taken by surprise."
GoNets,3cwlxq,jaywords,2,Sat Jul 11 19:36:31 2015 UTC,Anyway we can trade for lawson or bledsoe. We don't have much to trade but could it be possible?
GoNets,3cwlxq,Nebkreb,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:37:04 2015 UTC,"Joe still has value to a contender that needs a shooter (like Memphis, though maybe Barnes is enough for them).   And we have a lot of movable young guys now. I could see Bojan and RHJ drawing interest, and guys like Larkin, Markel, and even McCullough could definitely be moved. The right team could take some combination of that to build on (in exchange for Lawson for example, like you said).   I'd rather not trade our youth, though, unless it's for a guy with a promising future who's not well into or past his prime. If the nets are going to win a championship in the foreseeable future, the window is defined by Lopez. He's given us great effort and loyalty his whole career, and he would have to be the cornerstone of whatever we put together.   Because of his injury history and age though, that window closes in about 3-5 years even in an ideal scenario. If we can make a trade for a solid contributor that will still be at or near the top of his game for all of those 3-5 years, I'm all for it.   If it's for pieces that will help for a year or two then start declining, though, then fuck that noise. We're deep enough to build up with what we have, and get our younger players to hit their stride before Lopez starts to decline.   Plus, if Lopez gets hurt again or gets traded, having a lot of young pieces keeps us flexible. We shouldn't make any moves that take away from what we could have years down the road."

GoNets,3cucft,layzbean,2,Sat Jul 11 00:36:44 2015 UTC,Sooo you mean if he can be a better basket player over all we might have a chance.  Where do I line up for playoff tickets?
GoNets,3cucft,thetook,3,Sat Jul 11 13:56:15 2015 UTC,He's fine. I don't understand all the hate. He's actually pretty good and consistent. Not only that but he a clutch player that can make the plays under pressure
GoNets,3cucft,I_am_a_weenie,6,Fri Jul 10 21:37:07 2015 UTC,"He doesn't pass, lets 24 seconds pass by to shoot a random shot, plays awful defense. Brook will not make the same numbers during our run to the play-offs last season because of Jack."
GoNets,3cucft,Kn0ck0uTPT,2,Fri Jul 10 21:47:38 2015 UTC,"I agree the assists and D can get better, but i feel as though the rest of what you said is more up to the coaches to fix. The coaches will write up more plays revolving around Brook."
GoNets,3cucft,I_am_a_weenie,4,Fri Jul 10 21:51:25 2015 UTC,"Hollins was fine playing him and Plumlee and benching Brook and Deron, we lost so many games. Who knows, he played much better in the play-offs maybe he can continue that, but I doubt it."
GoNets,3cucft,Kn0ck0uTPT,2,Fri Jul 10 21:56:40 2015 UTC,"Idk, I have hope. He will no longer be used as a scorer off the bench and should be much more involved with the starters and the sets they run. A consistent starting role and mastering a playbook which involves him setting up the core can do wonders."
GoNets,3cucft,timdunkan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:08:53 2015 UTC,"There were stretches last season where he was really running the flow of the offense and just taking the shots as they came instead of looking for them.   I think being that 6th man spark plug makes him try to create for himself to much. When he gets out of that mentality, he's solid (offensively, at least). Hopefully extended minutes as the starting pg will help him get there."
GoNets,3cucft,laboratory_koala,3,Sat Jul 11 11:23:37 2015 UTC,"I like him, he did well when D-Will was out. It's tough to run an offense when you come of the bench and your role is to score."
GoNets,3cucft,timdunkan,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:39:03 2015 UTC,"I'd just like to point out that he played A LOT better when he's starting vs. off the bench. I've said it before, but there seems to be a mentality switch with Jack where when he starts, he thinks ""Oh I have to get the offense running and set other guys up"" but when he comes off the bench it's like ""Oh shit man it's my show I gotta SCORE""."

GoNets,3cucft,BasedGodProdigy,7,Fri Jul 10 21:13:22 2015 UTC,"We were, but JJack showed he can be a serviceable starting PG. I will always remember that 35 point explosion D-Will had on the Hawks, Barclay's Center was lit  If he took a lower buyout then I hope D-Will has somewhat of a resurgence on the Mavs. I feel for the Mavs with the DeAndre Jordan drama, so hopefully this does help them out.   Anyways, it's good that he forced this, instead of half-assing a season meant for development. We can focus more on BroLo & Thad Young's chemistry for the future & developing Bojan/our young PGs.  However, it would have been a lot better for us if this happened Pre-FA. Better late than never I guess."
GoNets,3cucft,timdunkan,5,Fri Jul 10 21:22:18 2015 UTC,My small hope is that Markel takes a huge leap this year and can become a decent PG. I really don't want to watch Jack start for a year. Dude would rather pull up 8/10 times on a PnR than pass.
GoNets,3cucft,BasedGodProdigy,4,Fri Jul 10 21:31:02 2015 UTC,"He's looked uncomfortable in Summer League when they've experimented with him at the point.  I want him to develop his jumper and become a 3 & D who can also show off his athleticism.  I'm hoping Boatright makes the team and gets a few reps at the point.  He's been inconsistent in the SL so far, but flashes of really great passing and a nice shot."
GoNets,3cucft,dragnalus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:19:46 2015 UTC,"I was a little upset with how he played. I was hoping those starting minutes would make him look better. Still, he has a little time to work on his jumper and overall offensive game. I agree with the boatright sentiment, him and markel will be a small but vicious backcourt when they get minutes together"
GoNets,3cucft,BasedGodProdigy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:52:17 2015 UTC,"I like the defensive tenacity and athleticism RHJ and those two would bring. Hell, even Larkin. It's a far cry from what we've been used to these last few seasons."

Shoots the 3 pretty well, but over time has gotten much worse finishing at the rim (probably thanks to ankles). Frustrating as hell player to root for because you don't know what you're getting on a given night, and also because you know you're rooting for an asshole.

GoNets,3cv4si,FriendlyBanana,3,Sat Jul 11 15:55:44 2015 UTC,"Dude's increasingly struggled in almost all aspects of game every year he's been in Brooklyn. I wouldn't say it's because of the system though, he's regressed under four coaches, all of whom had a system that was suited towards DWill's strengths. If I had to say why he struggled, it would be mainly due to (1) injuries, (2) some of the pressures of being a franchise player, and (3) his lack of interest in playing in Brooklyn; his move back to Dallas might improve him in that regard.   My advice though is don't go in with high expectations. Sometimes it'll look like the top-tier PG from Utah is back and he's the difference maker to get you guys into the playoffs, but it's usually just flashes. Still, for what you're paying him DWill will be a solid contributor on your team.   As a side note: take it from a fan who's had to deal with it a lot - you're going to hear a lot from Celtics fans about your pick this year. Don't let it get to you though, just be confident in whatever it is that your team is doing.  Also, if the DJ thing didn't happen neither does this, so if we're both bad this year, we can always blame the clippers together :)"
GoNets,3cv4si,FaithInMe,2,Sat Jul 11 02:33:24 2015 UTC,"I forgot the celtics got a bunch of your picks too. Ainge is laughing at both of us most likely. Even so, fuck the clippers. :)"
GoNets,3cv4si,layzbean,2,Sat Jul 11 02:48:23 2015 UTC,"He has been inconsistent for the Nets especially the last couple of seasons.  Sometimes he dribbles a lot trying to get pass the defender but can't because of his bad ankles.  He went to surgery to fix his ankles last off season but his game didn't get noticeably better.  Not very clutch either, I do not want him to take the last shot.  There are usually 1 or 2 other guys I want to take the shot before him.  Occasionally he'll have one of his throwback games where he dominates but those are becoming rarer.  He's still a good player but I was disappointed that he never lived up to the billing of being the elite player that he was in Utah."
GoNets,3cv4si,laboratory_koala,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:56:37 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to say, I wouldn't be too bent out of shape about DJ...as an outsider looking in, that seemed like an awful lot of money & years to give a guy that you can only play for 3.5 quarters/game. If there's anything you can count on Deron for, it's that one big game every couple of months or so. All the other games you can expect him to be anywhere between average to down right atrocious. He still has his crossover that he'll catch guys with but thats only when his offense if on point...but thats a rare occurrence. His defense against bigger guards has gotten a lot better, IMO. He was the best guard we had to get Brook the ball in PNR situations but even that was a struggle to watch because his jumper isn't falling most times...I don't know..i can't think of anything else he did particularly well. Expect to watch him get burned by quicker guards....like all the time. He'll drive into the lane and 1 of 2 things are certain to happen, he'll either straight out miss or he'll get his shot blocked. He's also terrible at drawing fouls while driving. He def. doesn't have the lift he used to. For all the fancy dribbling he'll show he's prone to a lot of dumb turnovers. And if you're lucky, they'll be during big games and if you're really lucky, they'll be during the most critical parts of said big games. You can count on at least 2 ankle related injuries that will keep him sidelined for a couple of games. All that being said, I feel like the best I've seen him play was when we were back in Jersey. When nobody expected anything from him he would go OFF. When his shot is on it's on and the rest of his game will follow. As long as he is not asked to carry a huge load for the Mavs, I think he will be fine."

Deron had a player option that could have kept him for 2 more seasons; with him gone and with JJ's contract ending next year, all that money will be able to be spent on a free agent.  Free agents in 2016:  Joe Johnson, Kevin Durant, Dwyane Wade, Roy Hibbert, Joakim Noah, Al Horford, Luol Deng, etc. etc.  While not a winning team, a big name could like the appeal of being part of building a fairly new brand in a huge market that can pay like New York City."

Seriously, don't pay attention to me until October. I'm just bored until the NHL and NBA start back up."
GoNets,3cvkuu,Im_Gab,6,Sat Jul 11 03:29:01 2015 UTC,"The problem is that he's capable of being a good PG but he has those nights where every play seems questionable and he's just a black hole on offense. D-Will was at least willing to pass bc he was scared to shoot. Jack is the opposite of that. So sometimes it's great but sometimes it'll cost us games. In those cases, we should bring out Blake who I actually think will be solid."
GoNets,3cvkuu,BasedGodProdigy,2,Sat Jul 11 04:46:54 2015 UTC,"Jack is an ideal 3rd guard, who can supply instant offense off the bench and you can trust to run a basic offense against the other team's bench units.  With the first team, and against the first-team defense of the opponent, he will struggle. He isn't really a point guard - he is always looking to shoot. And he shoots a TON of mid-range jumpers, the least valuable/productive shot in the game today. He doesn't have the natural PG instincts to keep his teammates involved, so there will games where Lopez has only 5 shots or Joe Johnson barely touches the ball.   On the right team, Jack can be very productive. I hope King can find that team and trade him. Would much rather go in with Larkin, who struggled in NY in an offense that played to his weaknesses rather than his strengths. If we had our own first-rounder, I'd say just give it to Larkin and live through his growing pains but alas."
GoNets,3cvkuu,Nebkreb,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:03:45 2015 UTC,A point guard coming off the bench is a complete different mindset to a point guard starting. I thought he was acceptable when dwill was out and he was starting. would not be fussed if he was starting for us

GoNets,3ctxf9,Kn0ck0uTPT,8,Fri Jul 10 19:16:44 2015 UTC,You guys should've accepted the Kings offer for Deron Williams and Plumlee. I think it would've been something like Carl Landry+Derrick Williams(expiring)+Darren Collison.   Collison would've looked very good right now for the Nets.
GoNets,3ctxf9,jennys0,5,Fri Jul 10 20:23:58 2015 UTC,"True, but than we wouldn't pick up RHJ which has a lot of potential. It's a tough call, I was wishing that we would've traded for Collison but then no RHJ for us."
GoNets,3ctxf9,jennys0,5,Fri Jul 10 20:37:39 2015 UTC,"Yea I agree. RHJ is going to be good. As long as he continues to improve with his jump shot, he's going to be a good player in the NBA.   I think at the time of the proposed trade, no one really knew how good Collison was. Everyone sort of assumed he was still CP3's backup. He really broke out this year since starting for the Kings.   I like your flair.. Bogdanovic is secretly my favorite Nets player.."

All I know is how funny it's going to be to watch Dallas fans hope D-Will returns to form and get crushed over the season. New team or not, his issues are psychological just as much as they are physical. We've seen him legitimately hesitant to shoot wide open jumpers and unless he recovers fully, I just don't see him becoming the old, confident Deron ever again."
GoNets,3cue53,BasedGodProdigy,2,Fri Jul 10 21:28:42 2015 UTC,"In terms of playing better, probably not, but the moral will be better, the dude didn't want to be here."
GoNets,3cue53,Kn0ck0uTPT,2,Fri Jul 10 21:31:18 2015 UTC,"After mulling it over I like it. It'll probably make us a worse team this season, but it's a good long term move. Even with DWill we wouldn't be likely to make the playoffs, so since we have a roster full of young people eager to prove themselves and a coach that has a good history of developing players I think it's a prime time to start building a foundation for future seasons; getting rid of DWill resonates with that, giving us minutes and touches to see what people can do this year and more money next year.   On another note, I've seen a lot of people talk about how this will affect the pick that the Celtics get next year. Here's the thing guys: the pick is already gone, so we really shouldn't let it affect the decisions that we make. It was a bad decision to give it away, yes, but we'd be digging ourselves in a deeper hole if we aimed for mediocrity for several years just to make sure the Celtics get a guy at #15 who may or may not pan out vs a guy at #14 who may or may not pan out."

GoNets,3crsvu,Ytiradilos,13,Fri Jul 10 17:37:20 2015 UTC,"For people who are wondering why the Nets would do this, essentially letting their starting point guard walk away for nothing, it has a lot to do with the salary cap tax. The Nets have 12 guaranteed contracts on the books paying out $95.3 million. This does not count the partially guaranteed deals of Markel Brown, Cory Jefferson, Ryan Boatright, and Earl Clark. Any number of these players are likely to be signed to the roster. All of them total are $3.2 million extra.  So the Nets' roster sits at $98.5 million. It is absolutely no coincidence that when the Nets heard that the luxury tax cap was raising to $84.7 million, suddenly we began hearing murmurs of a Joe Johnson trade. Now, we are hearing about a Deron Williams release. Why?  Well, the simple reason is that it saves a considerable amount of cash. The Nets and Williams are likely now talking about a buyout number that will release Williams from his final 2 years for a number that costs less than he would actually be paid. Williams gets paid $43.3M over the next two years (the second year is a player option that Williams would be stupid not to take). If you can manage to use the Stretch Provision on Deron Williams now, you stretch his cap hit evenly over the course of the next 5 years. If you get him to agree to a lower buyout number (which they will, considering Williams wants out), you can pay D-Will an overall smaller amount with a much, much smaller cap hit.  What does this mean regarding the cap? Well, simply, Brooklyn's salary cap will drop from around $98.5 to, let's say if you can get D-Will to agree to a buyout of like $35M, $83.M. If the Nets spend the year under the luxury tax cap, then they avoid the absolutely brutal repeater payments that they have been saddled with for being over the cap for the last few years. This allows them to add a lot more money next season at a much, much lower price to ownership. Especially considering Joe Johnson is also expiring at the end of the season as well. It's a move that makes sense, from a roster building and financial standpoint."

GoNets,3crsvu,DarkFantasy_,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:06:22 2015 UTC,Here's a good explanation: http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sn0r43
GoNets,3crsvu,Nebkreb,3,Fri Jul 10 15:14:43 2015 UTC,"Outside of tax money, this literally makes zero sense for the Nets to do. So we're paying him a ton of money to play mediocre basketball for ANOTHER team? So we'll be even worse this year (Dwill isn't great, but he's better than Jack and Shane Larkin) so the Celtics get a great pick. I don't get it.  The Mavs have a ton of money cause the Jordan deal fell through, about 11 million according to Bontemps. Get Devin Harris back, get some future draft picks and Euro prospects. The Mavs are DESPERATE to save face after the DeAndre Jordan fiasco - Cuban looks like a fool.   If we had any other GM, I'd be more confident that we'd press on their desperation and force them to overpay AND take DWill's contract. But King will probably give up our 1st round pick in 2022 or whatever and they get Chris McCullough.  Ideally: We trade Dwill to the Mavs for Devin Harris, their next available 1st round pick and filler players for the salaries to match. Harris starts at PG, Larkin/Boatwright back him, we flip Jack to a playoff team that could use him off the bench (maybe Portland could use him to back up Lillard?) for picks. We avoid the tax, we have more cap space next year when Johnson's deal expires and suddenly our franchise isn't completely crippled and mocked around the league."

Since the 13/14 season we know that he isn't going to help us but releasing him and not getting something value back(especially from the PG spot because we don't want Jack starting) is fucking bullshit,  we have to pay his fucking contract(Example: Josh Smith and the Pistons) and if he plays better in Dallas, we're getting fucked over so much.

The first year was Deron/Johnson/Pierce/KG and that team started atrociously but near the end was playing near .750 ball from what I remember. Also, similarly, Lopez didn't start the year ANYWHERE NEAR where he finished. There was definitely a light bulb moment for Hollins and Lopez and he beasted through the 2nd half of last year. My point is, he is a mentally fragile player that can not carry a team on his back. His confidence is so damaged to the point where he will no longer even look to take a shot. I think with a stronger cast...like our 13-14'...or mavs right now...he could get a little bit of his mojo back as a role player."

The Nets were never a top 4 seed in the East during his entire Nets era. The big 4 was suppose to be a contender in the weak East, but that whole experiment failed.  Also is a injury prone Parsons/ aging Dirk considered a stronger cast than what the Nets currently have right now? I rather have Lopez over Parsons/Dirk right now."
GoNets,3crsvu,layzbean,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:56:23 2015 UTC,"Ok rockets bro. First I didn't claim nets were some elite team. I mentioned the 14-15 team to point out that, when needed, he can be a piece that can positively contribute when all he has to do is manage the basketball. That's fine if you would rather have Lopez. I think at 27 years old, we have seen what he can do and he not a guy that can be the main piece of a championship team. And rockets bro, do me a favor and look up the nets playoff seed in 2013."
GoNets,3crsvu,Rocketz1Bruh,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:23:52 2015 UTC,"Are you sure you're a Nets fan?  Lopez was the Nets best player last year, when healthy he is arguably the best bigman in the East.

Let me ask you something, are you just upset that free agents are not choosing to go to Houston? You seem to be really bothered by the fact that he choose a team other then yours."
GoNets,3crsvu,jfam21,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:57:57 2015 UTC,I think if we just give him up for nothing this is gonna be the start of the nets spiraling into oblivion.

For all of you saying trade him to get assets...read the to descriptive reasons in this thread why the nets would be wise to do this.. open up cap space and helps us in the long run with money to sign free agents being we dont have any  first round picks anymore. Just get rid of the garbage and move on.. time to start this 5-10 year rebuilding process.. maybe when I am 35 I'll be able to say im proud to be a Nets fan again.
GoNets,3crsvu,MaroonMarble,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:03:10 2015 UTC,"Deron Williams sucks the Nets should buy him out. If the team truly wants to start fresh, there is no reason to keep him here.

I do think our potential with the old roster was capped and restructuring the team with a bunch of young players opens up the possibility of performing better than expectation. It's waaay too early to seriously predict records but I'd be surprised if we crept far above 35 wins next year, and that record would have landed in the 7-12 range for this past draft. I don't think the C's are going to get a top-5 pick but it certainly won't be in the 25-30 range either."

GoNets,3cq4t5,AncientCaptain,2,Fri Jul 10 12:51:20 2015 UTC,With him and Alan Anderson coming back I think the Nets could've pulled the 8th seed in the east. Locker room presence is a big factor in the NBA nowadays. There were times this and last season when Mirza really earned a starting role. What stopped him from playing was the fact that you had to play KG as a starter. We are talking about a major energizer that just needs the presence of a pass-first PG to get hot. If he wins you guys one game it could be the diffrence between making and not making the play-offs.

Jordan is extremely limited on offense and great at defense. I think they're both pretty even in terms of what they give you.   As far as Pierce, he's right. D-will is a prima-donna, a diva, whatever you want to call him. Dude is always sulking. Remember when he first got to New Jersey, he would occasionally sit by himself on the bench during timeouts while the rest of his guys were in the huddle. He's not a team first guy, and now that his body is failing him, he has no ability or desire to lead this team to victory. I can't wait to see him gone.  Did you even watch Pierce almost single-handedly save our season last year? If it weren't for him, Shaun Livingston and Alan Anderson (both minimum salary guys) the Nets couldn't have played .750 ball after the New Years.

GoNets,3ch2vz,Pinkman5545,11,Tue Jul 7 21:22:33 2015 UTC,"He's going to take more shots than you want him to. However, he's a solid defender, catch and shoot 3 point shooter, some off the dribble moves, good locker room guy. I'd say he's going to help ya'll out more than you'd expect. Of course that depends on how your ""coach"" uses him."
GoNets,3ch2vz,belov,7,Tue Jul 7 21:52:59 2015 UTC,He's a very good shooter. He also excels in defending the wing. He was a very important player to us off the bench. He might put up some stupid shots and make some dumb mistakes but he'll make up for it..Good luck!

He would fit perfectly into our roster in my opinion. Cannot teach that sort of athletisism but can try to improve his three ball. Potential to be a handy 3andD type. Carroll-esk.

GoNets,3cba45,FriendlyBanana,6,Mon Jul 6 15:52:36 2015 UTC,"Can't speak for the rest of the sub but I hate it. We'd basically be gutting our roster and putting ourselves in the lottery with this move. Earl Clark I can live without, but the only way I'd be okay with trading Joe is if we'd have more flexibility to sign back contributors. Letting AA and Mirza walk and getting back Vardjao completely defeats that."
GoNets,3cba45,mkorman11,2,Mon Jul 6 16:15:35 2015 UTC,We wouldn't even be putting ourselves in the lottery because Boston has our pick :(
GoNets,3cba45,GoldenKnight239,3,Tue Jul 7 02:48:06 2015 UTC,"It'd be something if it gave us room to make moves, but this just saves money for ownership and obviously makes us a worse team.

GoNets,3cba45,DarkFantasy_,2,Mon Jul 6 16:27:22 2015 UTC,"The deal benefits you more than us. Billy King said he wants value off Joe and this isn't it. What doesn't make sense either is us apparently wanting to let Mirza and Alan Anderson walk, when Woj reported yesterday we're trying to keep Anderson. We also gave Mirza the qualifying offer. If we were trying to save cap, why would we re-sign those 2 players?"
GoNets,3c9k2h,millancho,7,Mon Jul 6 03:58:13 2015 UTC,Love this kid. Amazing pick up by BK
GoNets,3c9k2h,MirzaTeletovicFan,6,Mon Jul 6 04:29:31 2015 UTC,"He looks 5'10 more so than 6'0 but his shooting stroke is reaaaal smooth. Only concerns really stem from his height since he might struggle to finish in traffic.  Also, didn't watch much of college ball. Anyone know how his handles and defense are?"
GoNets,3c9k2h,BasedGodProdigy,5,Mon Jul 6 04:29:35 2015 UTC,Uconn fan here. He is a monster on ball defender disrupting the flow of offense. A true pest. Great pick up for Brooklyn
GoNets,3c9k2h,TheMissoula,2,Mon Jul 6 14:24:02 2015 UTC,Good to hear! Nate made a nice career off of just decent shooting and handling so that defense is the big plus.
GoNets,3c9k2h,BasedGodProdigy,3,Mon Jul 6 17:39:13 2015 UTC,"He's got a great handle.  That's one of his biggest assets.  He's also a great shooter - both catch and shoot and off-the-dribble - and athlete, as you can see he dunks with ease.  Really his only weakness as a player is his size.  That will limit his ability to finish around the rim and on defense, but I don't think his defensive contributions should be diminished.  He's a disruptive defender who will get a lot of on-ball steals.  Boatright is lightning quick laterally, and his defense is a big reason UConn won a championship in 2014.  I really think Boatright could be a Nate Robinson type player; someone who can be a productive player in the league despite his diminutive stature."
GoNets,3c9k2h,The_Jims,2,Mon Jul 6 06:42:04 2015 UTC,"Didn't watch him in college, but as far as I can tell from the summer league games so far he puts in the effort on defense, but his lack of height is a big disadvantage since other players finish/shoot over him and he gets screened really easily."
GoNets,3c9k2h,FriendlyBanana,2,Mon Jul 6 06:30:58 2015 UTC,"Former Uconn student here. I've had class with him on campus, definitely 5'10"" max."
GoNets,3c9k2h,WutangX90,5,Thu Jul 9 04:11:47 2015 UTC,No doubt he should make the roster.
GoNets,3c9k2h,Dennisbodmon,2,Mon Jul 6 05:25:06 2015 UTC,His game was overlooked because of that buzzer beater.... he really went off....
GoNets,3c9k2h,TPaine16,2,Mon Jul 6 14:58:17 2015 UTC,He looks great. His size will likely be a problem on defense but the kid can score. Suddenly we have a ton of depth at PG...
GoNets,3c869l,turnvknup,14,Sun Jul 5 20:23:04 2015 UTC,"I'm shooting this down. I fully admit that I'm not thinking rationally. If this means we have to take Varejao, I'm not with it."

GoNets,3c869l,Dennisbodmon,6,Sun Jul 5 22:21:43 2015 UTC,"don't like it since the value is shit, but if we got a third team involved to take anderson's contract, and get some guys like christmas, that center we were rumored to get (cavs have his rights), cedi osman or picks, I'd consider it maybe."
GoNets,3c869l,DarkFantasy_,2,Sun Jul 5 22:33:15 2015 UTC,"A third team getting involved is really interesting. But even still Varejao, value wise, seems very DWill-esque. Who in their right mind is taking on that contract with really no way to know if you'll get 70 games or 20 games out that guy. It seems like a high price to pay to get under the tax and go into a fairly important season. Shit, the more I sit on it, the more it seems like this is an intentional leak to bolster JJ's value. It just doesn't make sense any way you look at it."
GoNets,3c869l,layzbean,7,Sun Jul 5 23:17:47 2015 UTC,"Fuck that shit, let Joe play out his contract then try to negotiate something reasonable and let him retire here."

GoNets,3c869l,Putuinurplace,3,Sun Jul 5 20:44:35 2015 UTC,If we wait to do it. You can't trade draft picks for like 30 days I think. But it would have to happen fast because the Haywood contract needs to be moved before August.
GoNets,3c869l,MarinePrincePrime,5,Sun Jul 5 20:47:25 2015 UTC,The Cavs haven't signed any of their picks yet so they can still be traded since they're just draft rights.

GoNets,3c869l,FriendlyBanana,5,Sun Jul 5 21:27:51 2015 UTC,"I don't like it. Saving money doesn't matter unless we do something with it, and we're definitely getting worse by giving away one of our better and more consistent scoring options and ball bandlers on a team where we have very little of both.  Everyone agrees that $23m for Joe Johnson is bad, but at least he can stay on the floor and play when he does. Why would we give that up for $10m in Varejao, who hasn't seen any NBA action in a while?"

Worse comes to worst we rid ourselves of his contract finally. 2 years of Varejao at ridiculous money is not exactly a huge incentive to trade him."

GoNets,3c869l,Ytiradilos,6,Mon Jul 6 12:35:59 2015 UTC,"Seems like the trade would be Johnson for Haywood's expiring and Varejao. It's not too bad. Saves a lot of money. Makes the Nets worse though, I think."
GoNets,3c869l,layzbean,9,Sun Jul 5 20:41:53 2015 UTC,"Varejao is guaranteed $19M through the next two seasons with a $10M team option his third year. If we're going to bail the Cavs out of Varejao's horrible contract, we better be getting back positive assets in return."
GoNets,3c869l,Ytiradilos,9,Sun Jul 5 21:12:48 2015 UTC,"The Cavaliers are bailing the Nets out of Johnson's horrible contract. I agree that the Nets shouldn't take Varejao because of the extra year, but Johnson is the highest salary in the league for 14 points on 44% shooting. It's a pretty terrible contract in its own right."
GoNets,3c869l,layzbean,9,Sun Jul 5 22:14:39 2015 UTC,"It's not just the extra year that turns me off from him. Varejao is dead weight, IMO. At least with Joe we are looking at a player that will most likely play a full season and can expect 14 points on 44%, you know what I mean? Not to mention that he and Bogdonovic seem to be the only ones on the roster that shoot the ball with any sort of consistency and fill that need. Cavs are locked into a 33 year old, ""high energy guy"" that has missed significant time every year for the past 5 years. I'd rather keep Joe for the season and see if we can be competitive team next year and just let him expire."
GoNets,3c869l,Kn0ck0uTPT,10,Sun Jul 5 22:47:28 2015 UTC,"If Joe continues to play like he did in 2014/15 season, then we're still going to be the same team, he really didn't make a difference. It would makes us worse if we trade Deron(believe it or not) and let Jack being our starting point guard."
GoNets,3c869l,Ytiradilos,2,Sun Jul 5 20:46:23 2015 UTC,"I agree that bringing Johnson back will make us the same team as last season. The alternative is starting Markel Brown. He's very good defensively but can't score the ball. Trading Johnson's 15 points for Brown's 36% FG will be a really, really tough downgrade on offense. I would imagine that Brown will play a little better than that, but it's really, really hard to play with a shooting guard that can't score. We don't even have Anderson to move into the starting 5 anymore. We were a fringe playoff team with Johnson. With Brown shooting sub 40% for 30 minutes a night, it could get very, very ugly.  The other alternative is playing Jack and Williams next to each other. We've all experienced that nightmare before, and we all know how hugely ineffective it is. The Nets really have no room to acquire another SG if they dump Johnson because they are over the cap. Like I said, it is sure to return some assets, and save money, but I don't forsee Markel Brown filling the hole in the lineup if Johnson leaves."
GoNets,3c869l,DADDYS_DARLING,3,Sun Jul 5 22:09:31 2015 UTC,Bojan Bogdanovic can play SG.

Most people are saying we should throw in a pick, but rather I feel like they should give us something. That's probably exactly what King and Gilbert are arguing.  I wouldn't do it. JJ can do more for us than that, because we can't tank, we still need to remain somewhat competitive."
GoNets,3c869l,mcorcoran3,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:30:32 2015 UTC,"Cleveland could offer the Net's some draft capital, right?"
GoNets,3c8fhk,netsfan125,9,Sun Jul 5 21:42:00 2015 UTC,"I don't want Varejao. He's broken down. But if the Cavs offer Haywood and some young assets or picks, I'm down. Nets must convert Johnson in to some future assets this year - he has value as a good shooter, good locker room guy and expiring contract."
GoNets,3c8fhk,Nebkreb,2,Sun Jul 5 22:57:32 2015 UTC,"If there are picks involved, I say go for it. It's it straight up for Haywood and Andy, it would be nothing but a $$ saver. We'd have to resign Alan to fill that gap."
GoNets,3c8fhk,BasedGodProdigy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:02:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah that would've been fine 2 or 3 years ago. But Joe is expiring so I'm good with, at worst, just letting him leave at end of the year."

Maybe it means less luxury tax, but we're more committed long term to Varejao's really unhelpful contract.  To make this a good basketball trade, we really need some kind of asset back.   For all people complain about JJ's contract - he does some pretty good basketball things."
GoNets,3c8fhk,foreverabluth,3,Sun Jul 5 23:10:17 2015 UTC,"Trade D-Will and his major contract for 2016. Then resign JJ with a substantial pay-cut so we can dole out a max offer. He can attempt to contend by being part of a strong core which can entice a truly elite FA, likeKevinDurant, to play in fucking Brooklyn."

GoNets,3c922z,raffathon,2,Mon Jul 6 01:51:09 2015 UTC,"I think it has already begun, the Nets are known to be actively shopping JJ and D-Will. The problem is finding someone that wants to take on their contracts.  The resigning of Lopez and Thad as our core is very promising IMO too, especially Brook's injury clause...   Lopez will receive a three-year, $60 million max contract that will include protections should he again have foot issues.    Source"

GoNets,3c1r6g,layzbean,6,Sat Jul 4 01:15:45 2015 UTC,"Most likely due to his size; he's less than 6 feet tall and isn't that well built, so he will struggle on the defensive end and scoring in the paint. That being said, he has the heart of a lion and he'll give you everything he's got day in day out. Happy for a fellow Husky to get a chance, curious to see if he can grab a roster spot."
GoNets,3c1r6g,Phogify,-1,Sat Jul 4 02:54:26 2015 UTC,"He's not that good, signing him to a 2 year deal seems crazy to me."

Still, there are quite a few undersized PGs out there that are effective. Here's to hoping that I'm wrong"
GoNets,3c1sk7,solowb32,8,Fri Jul 3 23:39:59 2015 UTC,"Billy King is a mediocre GM that was forced into making moves that ended up being completely atrocious. Nets brass wanted a win-now team, and the resultant moves netted us D-Will, Wallace, Johnson, Pierce, and Garnett for basically every asset we had. It was wrong of the new ownership to force King into a position where he had to build a win now team without the proper personnel, but at the same time, some of the blame lies with King. He made franchise crippling moves.  Billy King has always drafted pretty well and found good deals on good deals, but he will always be remembered for his huge blunders. I'm not saying he doesn't deserve the brunt of that blame, but that is the reality. I think he is an okay GM that will be known for the absurdly bad deals that he was, in a way, forced into."
GoNets,3c1sk7,Ytiradilos,5,Sat Jul 4 01:39:53 2015 UTC,"If Billy King is doing things that are actually smart, I have a feeling it's going to be a pretty successful season."

GoNets,3c1sk7,netsfan96,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:42:35 2015 UTC,"Jack is overpaid, Markel is bettersuited at shooting guard, Steve Blake isn't that good anymore.  Villanueva beat out two players with guaranteed contracts last year so it isn't unreasonable to think Juwan could do it here.  I'm not saying waive Jack because he still has trade value which most of the Nets don't.  Blake on the hand I could see him being waived.  Markel needs to be on the team to inject some youth and athleticism.  The same goes for Larkin.  But if Blake is waived and Jack is traded for cap relief you wouldn't want Staten as the third point guard behind Shane and Deron?"
GoNets,3c1sk7,doktrj21,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:49:27 2015 UTC,"Shit sorry that was meant for another post about undrafted free agents.  But you're right that he shouldn't have acquired Blake with markel, deron, and jack on the roster and still signed Shane."
GoNets,3c1sk7,Dennisbodmon,3,Sat Jul 4 03:51:40 2015 UTC,"Billy Kings best trait is player talent evaluation. He's been amazing at finding good players on great deals, and then finding talent late in drafts. So what do the nets want him to do, trade every pick for old talent.  The blame can't go on him entirely, but some of it has to. I do like what he's done this offseason, but until we get out of this shadow of our mistakes, most people won't give him proper credit"
GoNets,3c1sk7,FYININJA,3,Sun Jul 5 13:52:58 2015 UTC,BK is not a bad GM but of course because of past mistakes from that boston and atlanta trade he gets a bad rap from a lot people..
GoNets,3c1sk7,Pollux182,5,Sat Jul 4 00:34:32 2015 UTC,"It's not like it's unreasonable to criticize him for two really really bad trades. Those trades were basically throwing all of our chips into winning a championship immediately, by building a team that was not a contender.   It wouldn't be looked as badly upon had Williams and Lopez been healthy, but it's not wrong to call him a bad GM for making a pretty stupid series of trades. Prokorov is partially to blame though, he wanted immediate success and King tried to appease that, instead of just taking his time. I certainly hope he redeems himself, and this off season has been really solid for us, so we'll see, but he made a big mistake without losing his job, so he'll have that reputation as a bad GM until he makes some moves that can reverse that thought process."
GoNets,3c1sk7,Dennisbodmon,2,Sat Jul 4 02:46:32 2015 UTC,"Which I'm convinced was pressure from above to ""make something happen.""  A good GM strikes when the iron is hot, not when he decides it's hot."
GoNets,3c1sk7,timdunkan,2,Sat Jul 4 00:45:13 2015 UTC,"A good GM   Yeah true I get what your saying, but I didn't say he was good I said he's not that bad of a GM which means particularly average.."
GoNets,3c1sk7,huey88,1 point,Sat Jul 4 00:51:34 2015 UTC,"Nope, a lot of people are surprised we came out decently from FA and the Draft. It doesn't make up for everything, but it's an unexpected clean & swift start.   The clause in BroLo's contract that saves us from a tragic re-injury to his sketchy 5th Metatarsal is very very clutch. I am not as pessimistic about this upcoming season as I was a month ago.   Lionel Hollins knows what he can get from each one of his starters, and a whole season with the same coach and same players hopefully stops our pre-All Star break woes."

Alexander, Boatright, Robinson (finally).   Side note: I never listen to people who say the Nets could've had Lillard in the Gerald Wallace deal. Nets had no need at PG and were in love with T-Rob which is still obvious. They now have T-Rob anyway."

Trading for Joe Johnson's contract D-Wills contract Throwing away our future with no hesitation   In his mind he thought we would come out of this with at the very least 2 championships.   He was so convinced it spread to Prokorhov. Who also was so all-in that we would be NBA champions, that he said he would get married if we did not win a championship in the 1st 5 years of his tenure (2014-2015 season was his 5th year). Sure he was joking, but that doesn't resonate well with me as a fan. With that type of confidence, I expected more from a product they were so convinced would dominate. At least get to ECF once if you're risking all of that."

I thought he was a below average defender his rookie year and seriously regressed half way through last year. Not a particularly good rebounder. That being said, he was arguably our highest energy player from the past 2 years. He can get up and down the floor in probably about 5 steps. Decent finisher. Hope he does well for you guys! I still remember seeing the vets make him do pushups on the bench whenever someone made a 3 when he was a rook. lol."
GoNets,3c350t,layzbean,2,Sat Jul 4 13:20:42 2015 UTC,"Mason is a good energy player off the bench, can give you 10 points quick and block big shots, stuff like that.

Athletic, can run, dunk, jump has a good body and frame, but you don't know exactly what he's going to be. Meyers developed range and a more consistent jump shot. Mason, so far , is still as raw as he came in the league. He may be better at filling gaps than he was before, but he needs a lot of work still. If your big men coaching group developed Meyers well, they have a good shot at developing Mason."

GoNets,3bxsup,AncientCaptain,3,Fri Jul 3 01:13:04 2015 UTC,"The offseason isn't over and not even close. But if the team were to stay like this, how unlikely it may be we are going to struggle from the perimeter. But it won't be terrible, we'll play like we did in the 2nd half of last year, when MT3 got sick.   I'd say we make it to the bottom half of the playoff standing, a little better than last year. But I really don't see Joe or Jack coming back. So it's tbd."
GoNets,3bxsup,belov,2,Fri Jul 3 01:48:47 2015 UTC,"I hope they resign Mirza and Alan, both of them were great guys to have off the bench and both of them had some great games when they were starting. Also Alan is a great teammate and great to have in a locker room.   I hope next season won't be terrible, I'm just having a hard time being optimistic. The lack of three point shooters is scary. Maybe there won't be any clutch Joe Johnson that shoots his team back into games, no Mirza to draw attention on the perimeter, no Alan Anderson to do a little bit of everything.   And also, watching three's dropping when they are playing in the Barclays Center is beautiful, even while streaming."
GoNets,3bxsup,belov,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:57:01 2015 UTC,"I dont think AA or MT3 will be back. In general, AA and Mirza have been great for us but they most likely have a price tag we can't afford.   Next season won't be terrible we're stuck in about the 7, 8, or 9th position in east, with this team.  Behind Cavs, Bulls, Heat, Bucks, Wiz, and Raptors. But I've been impressed with the trajectory the offseason is going getting RHJ, TRob, Blake, and drafting Chris Mccoulugh (I butchered that), while giving up Plumlee (who wasn't needed here)."
GoNets,3bxsup,Netsfan12345,2,Fri Jul 3 02:31:54 2015 UTC,Maybe this is the year Lopez finally expands his range out to 3. He shoots them in practice and he hits midrange shots at a good clip in games. I don't think young is effective as a shooter and if Lopez can add that threat it will only open up more space for both of them to operate.
GoNets,3bxsup,SirWilshere,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:06:17 2015 UTC,"I dont think anyone will want Dwill so he will stay. If we can trade johnson then we will be able to sign teletovic and AA. The fact that last year johnsons three point shooting wasnt prolific means that we will wont be much different then last year in that regard. I really think bogdanovic can become a much better NBA shooter this year with one year under his belt. As he said at the start of the year the ball weight is different from europe and usa. If we have dwill, boggy, tele, AA and possibly a three point shooter from a potential johnson trade we should be and average three point threat. (Three pointers are not our strength anyway).  In relation to how we will fair in relation to last year. I honestly think we will improve. D will cant get worse barring injury. (Still a good point guard when up and running). I think bogdanovic will step up and was underrated for his rookie year. Im very excited about rondae and his defensive pressure he can bring. Thad was important towards the end of last year and with this contract and faith the front office has showed in him could be what he needs to improve further. Also barring injury lopez can potentially be a 22 8 and 2 blocks. And another year under hollins and he will continue to improve defensively.  AND THEN theres my boy Trob. Thrown around the league like a rag doll. By the look of things brooklyn really want him here.... And all he wants is a home. And loyalty.  We may be in a terrible situation contract-wise.. But i feel we are making the right moves Go nets"

But that T-Wolves trade is not a bad one, we need shooters and Kevin Martin is a good one, the other two aren't what we need for our team but if we're trading either Joe or D-Will, we need to take some players that we don't need, to have more options to trade to other teams. Good suggestions, we really need to trade Joe first to have more fillers to move Deron."
GoNets,3by3gg,nets76,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:50:08 2015 UTC,"1.I do not know if Prokhorov is also owner of CSKA but he has deep connections with this club, and CSKA is one of the top 5 european clubs (Kirilenko just finished his career in this club after playing for just 4 months there - I think that this was part of the ""wink"" ""wink"" deal when Kirilenko took paycut to play for Nets) so basically every player on CSKA team is potentially backup for Nets -----  2.Sasha Kaun is Mozgov-type player, maybe even better that Mozgov, great rebounder, sets hard screens (and lets just say that Lopez is not very eager to set a screen), runs the floor, great pick and roll, not good posting up (Thaddeus Young and Lopez are operating from the post anyway), better defender then Lopez, would be great off the bench. He would make life so much eaisier for Williams, iso Joe and Bogdanovic -----  3.he played simultaneously in Euroleague and Russian league and although Russian league is not strong as Spanish league it is among top 5 leagues in Europe. He is veteran role player and I think great fit for this team -----  4.Bismack Biyombo was 7th pick and individually is better player but as a fit for the team Sasha Kaun is much better fit, he will stay in his lane and be professional and I do not know that Biyombo would do that, Biyombo still wants to prove that he is worthy to be top 10 pick and not a bust"
GoNets,3bx9zi,Sa-Tiva,2,Thu Jul 2 22:27:44 2015 UTC,"He'll need someone to set him up to score, kinda like DJ in the sense that he dunks and cleans up and get put backs but doesn't really make his own shot. His defense is ok, nothing special. Great guy that you'll probably love to watch"
GoNets,3bx9zi,BrownGuyInNewEngland,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:28:52 2015 UTC,"If Mason could shoot, he would be a very good player.  Just because of that limitation, he's not really gonna be a guy you can rely on night in, night out.  His free throws are God ugly to watch.  If he works on his shooting, the Blazers would be very lucky."
GoNets,3bx9zi,taker98sp,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:55:12 2015 UTC,Mason has pretty good defense/no offense. Very athletic. Hustles.
GoNets,3bx9zi,BIGGUYsmalljohn,5,Sun Jul 5 16:06:17 2015 UTC,"Humphries can shoot, plumlee can't. Mason is more athletic though"
GoNets,3bx9zi,millancho,2,Thu Jul 2 23:00:50 2015 UTC,"It's probably important to note that his minutes dropped significantly after Lopez came back from injury. Plum never got his momentum back. If he gets good, consistent minutes, I don't see a reason why he can't produce comparable numbers to last year's first half. Also, he's still pretty young, so the playoff jitters are understandable, but still not okay. He cannot shoot, but he should never have to in Portland."
GoNets,3brhlq,DarkFantasy_,14,Wed Jul 1 15:43:50 2015 UTC,"I'm very excited for next season.  I feel like we upgraded, even though we really didn't. Plus we now have Thad for a whole season instead of Grampa KG. Hopefully he'll continue to do good for the team with Brook."
GoNets,3brhlq,taker98sp,9,Wed Jul 1 17:01:27 2015 UTC,Thanks for KG
GoNets,3brhlq,Jarg1623,10,Wed Jul 1 17:03:09 2015 UTC,"That trade really worked out the best for both teams. KG can mentor Wiggins, KAT, Payne, and the rest of the team. While Thad really was a missing piece for the Nets, which is supported by the fact the Nets did very well after trading for him."
GoNets,3brhlq,belov,2,Wed Jul 1 18:39:05 2015 UTC,You an the Cavs are our trade buddies :)
GoNets,3brhlq,Jarg1623,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:04:06 2015 UTC,"I mean, if we can perform as well as we did toward the end of the season last year I'd say it's pretty safe to say we've upgraded. That last stretch was really good, if they can keep up that level of success for a season (which is probably not going to happen, but anything close to it would be good) then we'll finish pretty well in the East."
GoNets,3brhlq,FYININJA,9,Wed Jul 1 19:15:41 2015 UTC,"Good signing. No reason to let Thad walk - he's productive, plays great with Brook, and we have no cap space with him or without him this offseason anyway. A full season of Thad and Brook should be cool.  Also, $12M is essentially market value for the services Thad brings. Either we pay him or somebody else does."
GoNets,3brhlq,Ytiradilos,2,Wed Jul 1 16:54:48 2015 UTC,"Plus he seems to be excited to play for this franchise, same with Brook. Gotta respect loyalty."
GoNets,3brhlq,carpy22,3,Wed Jul 1 19:19:31 2015 UTC,Don't forget the chemistry that he built with Lopez.  Thad said his free agency decision would be a based off of Lopez's decision. They compliment each other well. I'm glad both returned.

GoNets,3bskzs,Ytiradilos,3,Thu Jul 2 13:38:49 2015 UTC,"I don't see Williams moving unless the Nets take back a ton of expiring salaries. In that case, you aren't in play for any free agents this season anyway. To me, Williams is unmovable. You take too much of a hit trying to send off his salary that he is nearly untradable.  Johnson on the other hand has some potential, since he is expiring, and overall more consistent than Williams. Johnson isn't remotely worth the money, but you know what you're getting out of him. IMO, both are on the roster opening night. Can't see King pulling off the financial gymnastics necessary to move $40M+ on two players."
GoNets,3bskzs,imn8bro,2,Thu Jul 2 12:52:36 2015 UTC,Let's say this happens (I hope): Who fills their shoes?
GoNets,3bskzs,timdunkan,6,Thu Jul 2 01:30:05 2015 UTC,"Well if we theoretically lose all that weight on our cap, we would be in play for anyone.  We should honestly target a major ball-handler this year since next year's PG class is real weak with only Damian Lillard (RFA) and Mike Conley (never leaving) as the 2 major targets.  So, I say we could put a strong offer for Reggie Jackson, Patrick Beverly, & Monta Ellis. I love Reggie Jackson & Pat Beverly. We would also be in play for Rondo, but I don't really want that... I'd rather tie up DWade on an insane contract lol.  Shooting Guards/Forwards: Wesley Matthews would be a great move, Marco Belinelli could also start for us and in 2016 become a key rotational player. Here is a thought.... imagine if we signed J.R Smith lmao.  Anyways, the only good SFs left are Tobias Harris (I'd buy his jersey ASAP if this happened) &  Josh Smith (I don't want this unless it is dirt fucking cheap).  I just want us to keep our cap space hella open for 2016 so we can at least pursue KD with a max offer."

GoNets,3brwsj,Nebkreb,2,Thu Jul 2 03:14:06 2015 UTC,"Sasha Kaun coming out of Russia. I used to see him crunched over a computer in the CS building my freshman year at KU. He was a steady back up for the 2008 championship team. I'm curious how his game developed since. If the Nets grab him and TRob, we'd have 3 former KU bigs on staff."
GoNets,3brwsj,bensully,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:22:42 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, from Free Agency, I would love to see one them:     Bismack Biyombo - Good rebounder and very good shot blocker, knows his position on D, but he is limited on offense, luckily he is young(22 years old) so he might improve his offense a bit. Knowing he didn't show much do deserve a much higher contract I think the Nets can get him cheap. Alexis Ajinca - Highly effective in limited minutes. Did pretty well in NO this past season, a really long player so perfect for a Center, but I think he will stay with the Pelicans, they love him.  Like I said, he was going to stay there anyway. Kosta Koufos - One of the most effective backup centers in the NBA. Money will be a problem to get him here."
GoNets,3brwsj,timdunkan,2,Wed Jul 1 17:45:34 2015 UTC,"I really like Ajinca, but he already resigned. Koufos and Biyombo sound really solid as backup centers. I just hope we don't bounce pass it to them when they cut into 3 players like I saw we did in playoffs to Plumlee.

GoNets,3bjd6t,Netsfan12345,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:00:10 2015 UTC,I'm just a bit scared because he's limited by his shooting ability. When he first got traded to the Nets he was one of the best 3 point shooters in the NBA for a stretch. That clearly isn't going to continue and it didn't down the stretch and in the playoffs. I'd love to see a guy like Jeff Green next to Lopez.
GoNets,3bjd6t,Netsfan12345,3,Tue Jun 30 02:25:19 2015 UTC,Jeff Green isn't exactly mr. consistent. I'd rather have Thad on 12M than Green on 9M
GoNets,3bjd6t,raffathon,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:42:55 2015 UTC,When Thad isn't shooting well he isn't just hurting himself he's also hurting Lopez. He was a good scrapper at times but there were times that he wasn't much better than a polished Reggie Evans. They both saw production fall off at the same time last season. If we could steal Green in a Johnson to Grizzles deal or maybe a Rudy Gay off of Sacramento and turn him into a 4 I'd be happy. Same goes for Wilson Chandler.

GoNets,3bkg7n,jaywords,2,Tue Jun 30 10:13:33 2015 UTC,IMO good move. We've got Blake now.  Now waive Jack ;)

GoNets,3bfcxr,tadsweet,12,Sun Jun 28 18:53:28 2015 UTC,"The Nets fucking killed it in the draft! I said it before, and I'll say it again: if Billy King manages to get Joe and Jack off the books, NOT overpay Thad, and resign Lopez, this off-season will be the most re-assuring since the move to Brooklyn!"
GoNets,3bfcxr,shakendfries,2,Sun Jun 28 19:04:18 2015 UTC,"Just curious, what's not overpaying Thad to you?"
GoNets,3bfcxr,BasedGodProdigy,5,Sun Jun 28 22:49:12 2015 UTC,Anything more than $12m per year seems a bit too much for my liking
GoNets,3bfcxr,shakendfries,7,Sun Jun 28 23:01:55 2015 UTC,"With the new salary cap, $11m - $12m will be a bargain, it will continue to grow, especially with a 4 years contract."
GoNets,3bfcxr,Kn0ck0uTPT,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:22:17 2015 UTC,Pretty sure he's only asking for 12 so I think we're safe
GoNets,3bfcxr,GoldenKnight239,8,Mon Jun 29 17:45:27 2015 UTC,Yes! It's crazy we were sorta hopeless just last year but our FO has done a nice job making moves to make us a younger team. I'm hoping Cliff Alexander comes out with a vengeance and becomes a board machine.
GoNets,3bfcxr,BasedGodProdigy,6,Sun Jun 28 22:50:45 2015 UTC,Pretty god damn excited
GoNets,3bfcxr,abresler,4,Sun Jun 28 20:03:58 2015 UTC,"Getting this young, athletic talent makes me excited that we'll have players to watch develop as we head into our pickless couple of years."

I was excited the last 2 years and we didn't meet our expectations so :/  FO is doing a good job. I'm concerned about our bench when the regular season starts, but we'll see. We should def be better than last season"
GoNets,3bfcxr,DarkFantasy_,2,Mon Jun 29 02:08:14 2015 UTC,"I agree! I didn't expect much going into the draft and losing Mason kind of stinks - but overall I'm impressed with what the Nets were able to put together. The more I read into RHJ the more I see that he should've been selected higher. Maybe Hollins got his Tony Allen, he just can't shoot at all. McCollough has high potential and they did very well with the undrafted guys getting high upside players. I even like Boatright despite his size. The one thing that confuses me is it seems like we have so many high energy role player Power Forwards now. I guess let them fight it out."
GoNets,3bfcxr,jaywords,0,Mon Jun 29 12:57:46 2015 UTC,We stand a good chance to miss the playoffs this year. But... okay.
GoNets,3bgdsy,msg5117,3,Mon Jun 29 00:07:38 2015 UTC,I am a fan of Blake. He's a pretty solid 3 point shooter and he's a vet that can help mentor some of our younger guys. Jack killed it in the playoffs but if we can get a backup center or a shooter for him I'm all in.

GoNets,3begke,FaithInMe,-3,Sun Jun 28 23:00:48 2015 UTC,In hindsight we should have held on to Plumlee for leverage to sign Lopez before dealing him to the Blazers.  Lopez is taking advantage of the Nets.    Edit:  You guys vote me down for wanting to sign Lopez for a lesser price yet you all upvote the guy who flat out says no and upvoted the guy below me who want to sign him at the full $60 million.  So what exactly do you guys want? No one wants to compromise? Geniuses.
GoNets,3begke,shoegarbagebiology,12,Sun Jun 28 15:02:33 2015 UTC,Whatever. He's been loyal to us since he was drafted. Even when we were trying to trade him at the deadline to the thunder or whomever. He hasn't said one thing negative in all his time here I say we pay him what he's earned.
GoNets,3begke,FaithInMe,-1,Sun Jun 28 15:44:05 2015 UTC,He hasn't said one thing negative in all his time here I say we pay him what he's earned.    Not at that price.  You really really think he's not going to get hurt again? You really think he's going to stay healthy for the majority of three seasons?
GoNets,3begke,BasedGodProdigy,3,Sun Jun 28 21:02:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I do. He's reached at least 72 GP in 5/7 seasons. We are a playoff team with him with no cap space. Without him, we're a shitty team with no cap space. He's someone that could attract a FA."
GoNets,3begke,DarkFantasy_,5,Sun Jun 28 22:47:18 2015 UTC,"I can understand you can see it like that, but Lopez is far better than Plumlee will ever be and those two could never coexist on the court at the same time."
GoNets,3begke,FaithInMe,0,Sun Jun 28 17:24:01 2015 UTC,"Read my message again, I want to sign Lopez, but if we still have Plumlee, Lopez might have signed for cheaper.  After we signed Lopez, THEN we trade away Plumlee."
GoNets,3begke,BrownGuyInNewEngland,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:59:09 2015 UTC,"That would be a good way of losing Lopez entirely with nothing to show for it. Trying to save money on Lopez doesn't make sense anyway, we're over the cap regardless so might as well pay the man"
GoNets,3begke,Netslanders,-1,Sun Jun 28 23:41:22 2015 UTC,"I do not understand why you guys like Lopez so much. This dude is an absolute offensive tempo murderer.   Edit: obviously directed towards everybody in thread defending him, I'm with OP on this."
GoNets,3begke,BIGGUYsmalljohn,0,Sun Jun 28 18:56:13 2015 UTC,"Yes. He's definitely worth a max contract IF he stays healthy, but that's been his problem all along. He has been riddled with injuries. Too much of a risk for max pay"
GoNets,3begke,justcanitasshole,-9,Sun Jun 28 21:32:33 2015 UTC,"He's going to break his ankle again 3 weeks into the season. Yes, let him go. His value will never be higher."

GoNets,3bbtr7,iamenrique123,6,Sat Jun 27 18:52:51 2015 UTC,He was one of the best defensive guards in college basketball imo. Good pickup.
GoNets,3bbtr7,BrownGuyInNewEngland,5,Sat Jun 27 23:29:20 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't a player like him at least go in the second round. We got in touch with two undrafted steals today.
GoNets,3bbtr7,JawsThemeSwimming37,3,Sat Jun 27 20:28:25 2015 UTC,I'm surprised 1 of the Harrison twins went drafted and he didn't.

Not to absolve him of all responsibility, but he's not nearly as bad as the sort of meme about his ineptitude implies."
GoNets,3b94lg,A_Polite_Noise,6,Sat Jun 27 19:11:11 2015 UTC,"Not redemption but he did a good job   also, we can afford to overpay Thad a little since the cap is going up."

GoNets,3b6hgl,Istanbulbasaur,4,Fri Jun 26 19:59:46 2015 UTC,Steve Blake will surprise you. At the very worst he's a steady hand at the 3rd point guard position. Just don't expect too much of him in a playoff type situation.
GoNets,3b6hgl,touristB,5,Fri Jun 26 15:29:08 2015 UTC,Swindled? I thought he did pretty good with the situation he already fucked up.  It'd be nice to have gotten RJ Hunter but what can you do.

GoNets,3b5j7o,A_Polite_Noise,12,Fri Jun 26 04:13:56 2015 UTC,"Hope Plumlee finds success in Portland, but this was a good trade. Needed a backup SF since it seems like Anderson is leaving, and RHJ is regarded as one of the best defenders in the draft. Can't shoot, we could probably fix it up.   Us trading Plumlee must mean we're locking down on Brook as soon as possible."

GoNets,3b5j7o,tadsweet,10,Fri Jun 26 03:46:27 2015 UTC,"RHJ plays with heart too, and is a defensive wing that we desperately need."
GoNets,3b5j7o,xSlizzy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:49:46 2015 UTC,Plumlee was a player selected around the same spot that panned our pretty well. Wouldn't think it would take more than that to get another low 20 selection
GoNets,3b5j7o,tadsweet,6,Fri Jun 26 04:00:14 2015 UTC,"You can't really compare the two just based on number of selection. So many factors. But even so, I'd rather have RHJ than Plumlee at this point in their careers. RHJ is so defensively versatile and we really need his defense at the 3, especially with AA likely leaving.   This is a good pick for us. He will thrive under Hollins (I hope)"
GoNets,3b5j7o,xSlizzy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:08:06 2015 UTC,I hope so too. All I know is Billy king has a rough history with trades. Hopefully things start turning for the better.

We lost a lot of games during that period even tho Plumlee was putting good numbers."

An athletic wing who can defend, has a high motor and can't shoot, hmmm where have we seen this before on the Nets?   When teams sag off of RHJ to double Brook Lopez, what exactly will the game plan be?    When Brook Lopez is feeling a little gimpy and needs some rest for his foot at the beginning and end of quarters, who is going to replace him?  When Brook Lopez plays 40+ minutes a night for his first 10 games and gets injured for most of the rest of the season, who exactly is going to step into that c position?  It probably would have been nice to get another automatic 3 point threat on the floor to keep teams honest. I really don't understand this trade."

Your coaching staff is better though and he may play better w/ a talented PG."

Look at all the things he bring to the court:  ☑ Energy  ☑ Athleticism  ☑ Rebounding  ☑ Elite Versatile Defender  ☑ Good Off-Ball Instincts  He already fits our needs so well. If he gets his handle and shot down at an NBA level, this dude will be BIG for us."

GoNets,3b5ksk,ThomB96,5,Sun Jun 28 06:00:09 2015 UTC,"What an amazing highlight video... This is exactly the defender we need to guard Paul George, lebron, Melo,  I fucking love this trade he can also play the four and can be a Draymond green type player when he gets the ball on the pick and roll. This was an amazing trade for the nets I really think he can develop into a star wing player. I'm definitely willing to take the risk of him over what we know what we have in plumlee"
GoNets,3b5ksk,Bigbadbuck,5,Fri Jun 26 05:21:15 2015 UTC,Seems like a Hollins type of guy!
GoNets,3b5ksk,fimmas94,4,Fri Jun 26 06:38:39 2015 UTC,Other highlight videos show that he has a good jumper hiding somewhere in him. Don't freak about it now let him develop the shot with practice and we'll go from there. I think we got the good end of this deal.
GoNets,3b5ksk,Viol33,2,Fri Jun 26 16:10:44 2015 UTC,"His form is goofy, but he has surprisingly nice touch in the midrange and he's a consistent FT shooter. If the 3pt shooting ever gets there, look the fuck out.  Edit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aA7sjVV0cQM"

I barely watched last season, and I doubt I'll watch much of them this year, because there's no hope.   Our team isn't a contender, so there's no hope of that, and we don't suck enough to land a top draft pick, and even if we did we'd probably give the pick to Boston or Atlanta or China or something.

With merchandise sales and making the playoffs every year, the priority was to start strong and I think from a business perspective, it was a success.  King decided to go younger and more athletic last night. We have decent pieces right now to contend in the east, though probably not past the first round unless we get 2008 DWill.  We would have waited until 2018-2019 to make some real moves anyway. Last night wasn't bad. Also, it seems he's trying to keep Brook."

GoNets,3are5g,DarkFantasy_,3,Mon Jun 22 22:07:25 2015 UTC,"He was regarded as a lottery pick before he got hurt, but he obviously got hurt and seems like he'll sit out for a year before playing his first game. He also has some question marks about his motor and if he's dedicated to the game that probably hurt him as well."
GoNets,3are5g,Nebkreb,2,Mon Jun 22 22:46:34 2015 UTC,"I am a Cuse alum, watched all their games. I heard him mentioned in the lottery for sure, and possibly top 10. He is a talented offensive forward, can hit a jumper, and work inside. He looks good to scouts cause he is athletic and long."
GoNets,3are5g,abrightersummerday,1 point,Wed Jun 24 00:47:46 2015 UTC,"It's pretty hard to say.   There was a point a few weeks into the 2014-2015 season where Chad Ford had him is early as #10, Aran Smith had him #7, Sports Illustrated had him #15. After that he played pretty poorly for a few weeks, and he dropped on the draft boards out of the lottery and into the high teens/low twenties. Then the injury happened.  Because of all that, and because he played like half of one season, it's impossible to know. He was going to be 1-and-done regardless, so if he had matched his early season play, 'Cuse got into and did well in March Madness, and he showed up on the big stage... he would have probably ended up in single-digit territory. If he stayed playing like he was in the weeks before the injury, probably 15-20. 90% of his draft intrigue is coming from his ""potential""-- his size, athleticism (his jumper is pretty smooth, too)-- so even mediocre play throughout the season probably could have kept him before 20th pick."
GoNets,3apxgw,ArthurMitchell,9,Mon Jun 22 15:33:24 2015 UTC,They should have given the keys to Kidd.
GoNets,3apxgw,pabstjribbon,6,Mon Jun 22 16:49:21 2015 UTC,"Some stuff off the top of my head:   Player inconsistencies: Guys like DWill and Brook are fantastic talents but are not as consistent as they should be. Lopez didn't have a turn around for this season until the Nets didn't trade him. People playing for themselves: Joe Johnson didn't get the nickname Iso Joe for no reason. He's a playmaker sure but he's not the type to always be a team player. Same goes for Jarrett Jack where, unless he's starting, he wants to play hero ball and be Kobe. Bad chemistry: This usually happens always before the trade deadline as the Nets can't get into the grove of things with changes in the roster and coaching (four different coaches in four years). It's not a good look when they start picking up the slack when playoffs are right around the corner. Front office: I do not like our front office at all. The idea of even trading for Lance Stephenson was a poor choice in my opinion. Overpaying for some players has been a real detriment for the FA. I will give them credit for getting Thad Young, however. No established leadership: DWill has been seen has the face of the Nets franchise for the past few years but doesn't act like the leader he should be. This doesn't help when guys like Jack want to try and fill that role instead of doing his job"
GoNets,3apxgw,HEELHousell,2,Mon Jun 22 15:49:34 2015 UTC,This basically says it all. Nets fans expected much more from the team over the years.
GoNets,3apxgw,Eck5straxion,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:55:02 2015 UTC,"See that is why I could understand the Pierce/Garnett deal. Joe Johnson has never been a leader, Lopez is too young and I was skeptical about D-Will. It really seemed that bringing two champions and future hall of famers over could have brought that to the team but it didn't end up happening."

GoNets,3aoh50,Swamp85,2,Mon Jun 22 05:01:41 2015 UTC,Very nice!
GoNets,3anu0a,DarkFantasy_,3,Mon Jun 22 01:12:31 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna try to answer each question you posed... so here goes! I'm basing a lot of this on where most of the mock drafts have guys generally placed, so we have an idea of who's available where. Hopefully that seems fair.    At 29, if Delon Wright is gone, I'd take a hard look at McCullough, but I'd end up picking Terry Rozier. At 41, Rakeem Christmas seems like he would be a good pickup for this team, as he could fit next to both Brook and Thad, or if they leave, as he flashed a good midrange stroke at the combine, he could fit in theory next to Plumlee.  Unless someone unexpectedly drops, I doubt we buy a pick in the second. So if we go with someone other than Rozier at 29, and he ends dropping to say... 36 or so... I could see us buying a pick there. Or if Christmas/Wood/Hanlan/Young drops past 41, I could see that as well. BUT I don't really expect it at this moment based on where things seem to be falling.  IF we trade up, the two most likely candidates are Jarrett Jack and Mason Plumlee... though I wouldn't be entirely shocked if someone bit on Joe Johnson if their top picks in their spot are gone.  Jumping off from my last response, here are the scenarios I could see happening for each:    Plumlee - I could see either the Raptors or the Mavs trading for Plum here. The Pacers have been linked to him, but Bird likely wouldn't bite on that offer. Both the Raps and the Mavs could use Plumlee (Raptors because JV hasn't developed quickly and they struggle with Amir playing the 5 when he's off the floor anyway and the Mavs because they could use some Tyson Chandler insurance). So for the Raptors, it'd be Plumlee and 29 for 20 and whoever they feel like sending back. And for the Mavs, Plumlee and 29 for 21 and ... idk... Powell? Jack - This one has been tossed about a ton and I could easily see this happening. Jarrett Jack and 29 for Martell Webster's contract and 19. Makes sense for both sides, honestly.  Joe - I could see the Cavs trying to make something happen here, but obviously this is a HUGE longshot and I won't believe it till it actually happens.   Yes. Absolutely yes, as long as the price is right. I don't want to start handing assets away to move up a few picks, but if it's a choice between getting Wright/Grant/Hollis-Jefferson and having the great consolation prize of Christian Wood and keeping Plumlee?... I'm choosing the former.  If we're talking the #1 pick? Towns all the way. You have to go BPA up there. You don't wanna pull a Cavs and take Anthony Bennett. Anything after that in the top 3? Russell for sure.  Jerian Grant or Cameron Payne without question."
GoNets,3anu0a,moirakathryn,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:40:10 2015 UTC,"As much as I would love to see us grab a Stanley Johnson, Kelly Oubre, Devin Booker, or one of those lotto picks with crazy potential, in all honesty we need people that we can put in a position to succeed. Players who are good at what we need. And although our team needs to improve in a lot of areas, Joseph Young and Chris McCullough are two players who seem to strike the balance of fulfilling roles and possessing upside.   -Joseph Young: he adds scoring from our backcourt that we desperately need, and would be a perfect fit next to the defensive minded Markel Brown. When it comes to small PGs, they are always undervalued in drafts (Isaiah Thomas was drafted #60, Nate Robinson #21, Monta Ellis #40) so you probably haven't heard much about him, but the dude is a stud! There was a reason that Young won PAC12 Player of the Year over Delon Wright- don't let his size fool you, the kid's scoring ability is uncanny. He dropped 30 on Wisconsin in the tournament  -Chris McCullough: NY dude with tremendous upside, and could shape out to be the fit we need next to Brook- he spaces the floor and grabs boards. Although we haven't seen much from him, he's a player we could watch grow into a solid contributor over the next few seasons.  I think we should move Jack and bite on the Lakers 27th pick to make sure we get both of these guys. I think there are also some mid round guys who could contribute- Justin Anderson and Kelly Oubre could sure us up on the wing, especially if we plan on moving on from Joe Johnson. I don't like the idea of putting all of our faith a top pick because that can lead to a lot of high hopes, and set us up for disappointment. But smaller moves for players who could excel in defined roles, with room for upside/improvement could go a long way to filling out our roster."
GoNets,3anu0a,shakendfries,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:45:45 2015 UTC,"I like Chris McCullough, but I feel like the nets need immediate impact with this draft because the whole draft situation. I don't think the nets can afford to wait on a guy with a serious injury such as an torn ACL. People think he would be a top guy in this draft if he was healthy, but since he's not, I don't like the possible gamble."
GoNets,3anu0a,ihavepaper,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:11:01 2015 UTC,"If we stay at 29, I'd like us to take Delon Wright, 6'6 and  soon to be 23 year old point guard from Utah who's projected to go 27 to the Lakers (via DX). Delon Wright is basically the Anti-Jack. Delon's a skilled passer whether it's out of the P&R, to cutters, or to spot up shooter. His height plays into his strength, allowing him to see above the defense. He's an improved shooter, and a very decent player in transition. He can change speeds well, gets to the line using a euro-step or pump faking. His main issue is his shooting. He's improved, but he's still not good enough to respect. In college, people sagged off him daring him to shoot. He's not a good finisher, which brings up the question, will he continue to get calls at the NBA level? Also, he's 23 and the whole ""upside"" argument comes into play.  At 41, I'd take Christian Wood, a 19 year old Power Forward who's 6'11 with a 7'3 wingspan. Wood is an interesting prospect because he can run the floor (and even handle the ball), he has potential on defense due to his length and his agility, he's a solid rebound, and he can shoot from the outside (not consistently, but he shows he can do it). Wood does lack certain things, and those things are strength and discipline. He doesn't have good strength, which hurts him in the post (offensively and defensively). He's doesn't have good awareness on defense off the ball. He's out of place at times on defense or not even in defense position at times and it hurts the overall team defense. Wood also has taken plays off or jog up slowly. Outside of defense, he some time feels like he can just pull up and take horrible shots early in the shot clock that you would want back.   We'll most likely buy a pick from the Sixers, who have a million of them. If we buy one, I'd like to get Pat Connaughton. Comes across as a team guy in interviews who will do whatever he will to win, a great athlete, defender, spot up shooter, but not much else.  If we trade up into the lottery, I think the most likely trade partner is the Indiana Pacers, who are at 11, and have been rumored to possibly be willing to trade their pick. Do I think it'll happen? Probably not. If we do trade with them, we're probably sending off Jack, Plumlee, and the 29th pick. Indian needs a backup PG since they aren't resigning CJ Watson (no one should sign him if they want to make the playoffs). Along with needing a backup PG, they may also need a center, since there's rumors that Hibbert may be leaving.   The trade:  Brooklyn Receives the 11th pick and CJ Miles  Pacers Receives the 29th pick, Jack, and Mason Plumlee  Disclaimer: like I said,  i don't think it happens, but this is probably the best chance we have. Also I want to say this trade works, but I'm not entirely sure.  If cavs and lakers are offering their picks, we shouldn't bite. Too small of a jump. If we do bite on one, it should be the cavs.  If we had a top pick in this draft, I'd want to take D'angelo Russell, Hezonja, or Winslow  Without the pick swap with ATL, I'd want to take Sam Dekker or Grant."
GoNets,3anu0a,Dennisbodmon,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:04:21 2015 UTC,I should also put up the question: Who do you feel like is a sleeper in the draft? It can be someone we can possibly get or not. Devin from TBG agreed with me and said Christian Wood is a sleeper  edit: did put that question up along with another one
GoNets,3anu0a,DADDYS_DARLING,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:28:21 2015 UTC,"According to Netsdaily, Billy King is reportedly looking to trade up by using Mason Plumlee as bait. I'm not looking at any prospects in specific, but for the most part, i do trust Billy King and his drafting instincts. What I think we need: Athletic and shooting wings.   also praying that Markel Brown is working on his jumper and defense. Dude can really be the Nets' Tony Allen with a jumper and more explosiveness/athleticism."
GoNets,3an7js,shakendfries,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:46:10 2015 UTC,"As much as I love Delon Wright, there is a reason that Joseph Young won the PAC12 player of the year award. The dude can flat out score, and given our backcourt problems, this could be an excellent addition to play with Markel in our backcourt. His game resembles that of Monta Ellis, and he can sore in a variety of ways. He cracked the top 10 in NCAA scoring! This dude could become a solid player for the Nets and fits the mold of solid undersized PGs like Isaiah Thomas"
GoNets,3an7js,moirakathryn,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:54:03 2015 UTC,Which is why I'd be happy to take him in the 2nd round. But taking him in the first is too risky. If all he amounts to is a poor man's Lou Williams... I think it's a waste of our only real first rounder for a while.
GoNets,3an7js,moirakathryn,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:55:30 2015 UTC,"He could also amount to an Isaiah Thomas/Monta Ellis type player. Small PGs always get undervalued in drafts (Monta was picked 40th, IT was taken 60th, Nate Robinson went 21st), and he's predicted to go anywhere from 20-60th, so he might end up sliding to the second round. Given the room on our roster for him to develop next to Markel, I don't think him turning into a Monta caliber PG is much of a stretch"
GoNets,3aoihy,DarkFantasy_,2,Mon Jun 22 05:16:55 2015 UTC,Andy has been to loyal to that team for them to not let him stick around for possible championship runs. He wouldn't play with the heart he has now if he was anywhere else in my opinion.

Basketball is a winter sport and the only advantages are natural soundproofing and a better visual from high apartments.  The positive of this is I do have hope for free agency next summer once Barclay's is fully finished and the practice arena is finally done. I've heard great things about the practice arena especially, which will be in Brooklyn vs driving to NJ for practice all the time. Hopefully it will be a good recruiting tool as the cap expands and money comes off the books for the Nets."
GoNets,3abizq,shakendfries,3,Thu Jun 18 19:31:02 2015 UTC,"If the Nets were able to move up to a situation that lets them take Justice Winslow, I think that's a guy that would fit in well. Otherwise, either of the UK (Lyles/Booker) guys would be a nice grab. I absolutely love the upside of RJ Hunter if options start to run low, I think he can go nuts in the NBA. With the later pick, I think you are dead on with Chris McCullough. I've watched him play a bit, a legit 6'10'' that can jump through the roof with a decent little jumper. Always active and would be a steal that late in the draft."
GoNets,3abizq,jedwar05,2,Thu Jun 18 21:59:45 2015 UTC,"This being all hypothetical, would we keep the 29th? Or would you want to Package that as well?"

GoNets,3abizq,thetrentcole,2,Fri Jun 19 12:21:41 2015 UTC,I would want us to focus on getting rid of Johnson and Williams. I think Brook is going to leave as he should. I say stay where we are and draft Robert Upshaw to take Lopez's spot. If Plumlee can get us anyone who can replace ether D-Will or JJ then I am all for it. I like Payne personally. I hope so because Billy King boned the team for the next four years. Still Love my Nets though!
GoNets,3abizq,moirakathryn,2,Fri Jun 19 08:45:22 2015 UTC,"Cameron Payne is the best option for us here (unless of course Mudiay slides way down). While I like some of the other guys, and some of them could for sure shore up some depth elsewhere on the roster, we are in dire need of a point guard prospect and Payne is the best option  projected in that range.  That being said, I also really like Grant and WCS. And I wouldn't be angry with either of those picks."

GoNets,3a8vr9,AyoTrevz,2,Thu Jun 18 07:05:43 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty drunk right now, but I'll play.  We can't make a realistic offer for 1-9 without at the very least including Bro-Lo though a sign&trade. Joe Johnson, as an expiring, would also certainly come into play.  I'd love to trade for a top 5 if we can aim for Kristaps Porzingis or D'Angelo Russell and a future 1st rounder. Our realistic teams to trade with would be teams in a win-now mentality. Which would be the Lakers, Timberwolves, Nuggets, & Hornets.   I love Bro-Lo, but the man is one injury on his metatarsal from never ever being close to what he did the 2nd half of this year. So if we can get one of the top 5 for him, I'd do it in a heartbeat. I think Porzingis is going to be legit and is realistic to trade up for, but when it comes to Billy King he would trade everything just so he can draft the next Anthony Bennet."
GoNets,3a8vr9,timdunkan,1 point,Thu Jun 18 06:58:43 2015 UTC,I would give up Brook for Russell in a heartbeat. Russell and Mason is better than the possibility of signing Lopez and a mid-round rookie (assuming Mason is traded for a pick)

Its just the entire situation with him: the Nets took the risk of signing this injured guy who was switching teams every year unable to find a good place for him. We were the first to give him a role where he could thrive and maximize what is left of his potential. He has a breakout year. We're unable to sign him again. Warriors benefit from our risk! But like I said, nothing but respect for the man. Class act, truly such a great and inspiring story about hard work and never giving up. Enjoy your ring buddy!"
GoNets,3a1n9p,jaywords,10,Tue Jun 16 15:07:04 2015 UTC,"We are a team who tried to buy a championship a couple of years ago and are stuck in limbo suffering the consequences of this. While our teams salary takes out 1st place in the NBA, unfortunately our basketball doesn't quite come close."
GoNets,3a1n9p,raffathon,3,Tue Jun 16 18:19:05 2015 UTC,Depressingly accurate
GoNets,3a1n9p,Ytiradilos,4,Tue Jun 16 18:38:04 2015 UTC,"When King and the Russians made ""the trade"" to buy themselves a championship, the identity looked like it was supposed to be a squad that had ""been there"" before. It had the ""talent"" (Williams, Lopez), it had the ""vets (Pierce, Garnett) and it had the ""pieces"" (Kirilenko, Anderson). Unfortunately, the ""talent"" was injured, the ""vets"" weren't that good, and the ""pieces"" were not complimentary, they were necessary. It wasn't a good formula for success for a number of reasons, but unfortunately even if Billy King knew how, he cannot get on the same page as Hollins and build a team in his image because he doesn't have the flexibility, and the players he does have are certainly in possession of their own talents, but they are not the slow, ""grit and grind"" types of guys that Hollins loves.  I actually think that Hollins is a good coach, but this is not the right squad for him. I also am not sure he will ever get the right squad, considering the cap situation and lack of useful draft picks. Lionel Hollins will likely be the wrong coach at the wrong time, and when the true rebuild can finally begin in 2018, he'll either be the captain of a truly sunk ship, or he'll just get himself out of here. It's a shame, because Hollins has an identity, but he really won't get the chance to build a team in that image. At that point, you'll get a ""stopgap"" type coach who is new, has a good basketball pedigree, and has absolutely no experience in the NBA. Sometimes these guys work out and you can build a team around their basketball style and acumen (Brad Stevens) and sometimes they don't work out, but it's okay because they're just filling the space in the tanking years (Jacque Vaughn) until the team is on the upswing. I know Nets fans don't want to hear this, but this team is in such dire straits that unless Nets brass hits paydirt late in the draft, or manages to convince a marquee free agent that his future is somehow in Brooklyn, you may not see a playoff team in Brooklyn until 2020 or later. You may get a first round exit or two in between then and now, but it will get bottom of the barrel at some point.  Sorry, I rambled. I love this team but they might even have less identity than they did under Kiki Vandeweghe."
GoNets,3a1n9p,raffathon,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:45:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with your comments however this part I somewhat disagree with:   I know Nets fans don't want to hear this, but this team is in such dire straits that unless Nets brass hits paydirt late in the draft, or manages to convince a marquee free agent that his future is somehow in Brooklyn, you may not see a playoff team in Brooklyn until 2020 or later. You may get a first round exit or two in between then and now, but it will get bottom of the barrel at some point.   For periods of this season we played some quality basketball, particularly after the ASG when Brook went on his stellar run. If we can build on this and play a more consistent brand of basketball I can see us finishing 4th/5th seed next year (if not higher). This might be optimistic but if we can continue to build with our core of Brook/Thad, hope Bojangles develops into a player he has shown us glimpses of this season, pray D-will gains some confidence from that 35(?)point playoff game and limit JJ's minutes a bit so he can be more productive I can see us winning more games than this season. Plumdog sorting his shit out and having a fit Threza will add to this.   I think the pieces are there and Hollins sort of figured out how to use them later in the season.  GoNets!"

GoNets,38a3ba,Broooklyn456,3,Tue Jun 2 21:37:41 2015 UTC,"Terry Rozier all the way! He was one of the most athletic players in the combine, he would add the speed we desperately need in our backcourt, he's from a good program, and he knows how to score- I can only imagine how much havoc he would wreak next to Markel Brown. And he knows how to feed the ball down low as evinced by the success of Harrell- good news for Thad and Brook. He actually reminds me of Dennis Schröder"
GoNets,387spv,netsfan96,3,Tue Jun 2 13:42:56 2015 UTC,I would really like to see Jodie Meeks on the Nets. He had a great season as an off the bench player and came into his own at times when he started. I think he is a fast paced player that could see some great playtime with us. Is he better than Jack? That I am not sure yet. Would have to compare their stats togetehr
GoNets,387spv,itsfoine,3,Tue Jun 2 14:01:58 2015 UTC,"He is a better fit than Jack is for the Nets. If we get a chance to do it, I would pull the trigger."

GoNets,387spv,checkag,2,Tue Jun 2 18:05:40 2015 UTC,Dougie McBuckets didn't quite workout for the Bulls and I think he's a gamble worth taking for the Nets.
GoNets,387spv,doitforthepeople,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:00:00 2015 UTC,"eh, it's been one season and he was stuck behind Mirotic. If the Bulls ship Gibson, I'm guessing they'll give Dougie more minutes."

GoNets,386n8i,FriendlyBanana,2,Tue Jun 2 05:56:31 2015 UTC,I like Patrick Beverly- hes a helluva defender. We could also go after this European combo guard named Mantas Kalnietis to fulfill a Pablo Prigioni/Jose Calderon esque role for the team's PG duties
GoNets,386n8i,shakendfries,2,Tue Jun 2 15:34:01 2015 UTC,"First option should be re-signing Brook and Young.  Besides that, not many moves can be made because of DWill and Joe."
GoNets,386n8i,ihavepaper,2,Tue Jun 2 06:07:27 2015 UTC,"What happens if Brook and Thad leave? What happens if we can pull off a trade for DWill or Joe? Are we going to just sit on all that cap space and hope that we hit it big in 2016? I know that it's unlikely to happen but at our current state I don't think we can afford to overlook any possibilities to make the team better.  Edit: Also, if we're planning on resigning Brook and Thad, wouldn't it help a lot more if they knew how the organization was planning to build around them? I can't imagine that ""we'll suck for this year, but don't worry we'll hit it big in 2016"" would go far in convincing two players in their prime to stay."
GoNets,386n8i,ihavepaper,1 point,Tue Jun 2 06:17:17 2015 UTC,"If Brook and Thad leave, we're pretty much done. As in lottery, if we even have a pick this upcoming year, here we come. Both players have stated they want to return and Nets say the same, but Thad has specifically said that he is watching Brook's off-season move: He will stay as long as Brook decides to stay. They built a solid chemistry in the front court and definitely compliment one another.  Joe MIGHT be more enticing than D-Will considering he still is capable of being a consistent 15ppg man that can still be deadly around the arc, but his $24 or so million will still be tough to move. May be more valuable around deadline or next summer (i think he's a free agent next year without googling it).  Yes. More than likely. 2016 is the next possible wave of big FA names. Why not? Nets don't have much picks and from the looks of it, aren't looking to build through the draft like a TWolves or Philly.  I'm pretty sure they've been notified that they would be the center pieces moving on. Season ticket holders were given a letter/message saying that the team will build around the core of Thad, Brook (Assuming both are re-signed), Bogie, Markel, and Sergey. As for ""we'll suck for a year"", I'm sure it's inevitable. Nets are focusing on younger and athletic players to revamp the roster. Don't know how, but i'm hopeful. We've been through worse."
GoNets,386n8i,netsfan96,1 point,Tue Jun 2 07:10:47 2015 UTC,I doubt we would lose both players. Most players want to stay in Brooklyn and the Nets are willing to spend to keep them here (not too worried about cap space).
GoNets,386n8i,netsfan96,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:45:02 2015 UTC,"Unless, we can unload Williams' or Johnson's contract to relieve cap space, it is unlikely that we can consider any big names."

GoNets,37u1tt,netsfan96,8,Sat May 30 11:40:19 2015 UTC,How about   Fire Billy King so a GM that actually knows what he's doing take over.
GoNets,37u1tt,Android-21,1 point,Sat May 30 15:00:04 2015 UTC,I like this option.
GoNets,37u1tt,YungMags,9,Sun May 31 23:07:42 2015 UTC,Fire Billy King and then starting looking to make deals for draft picks. This team isn't going to become a contender through trades and free agency.  We can't let Billy King do any more damage and we need to get younger.
GoNets,37u1tt,STkrusty,2,Sat May 30 13:44:44 2015 UTC,Exactly. That's why the trades seemed to be focused on getting draft picks and young talent. We need to get as many young players to develop to not be doomed for the future.
GoNets,37u1tt,Ytiradilos,3,Sat May 30 14:51:49 2015 UTC,"I'll comment on each of the trades:  1st: There is absolutely no way the 76ers would do this trade. It's hilariously bad for them. They're trading a young forward who has shown some decent upside (Covington) for a second year guard that spent the season on the bench (Wilcox) and Matt Barnes, who is essentially a league average swing forward that is 35 years old. This deal is god-awful for the 76ers. For the Nets it's a pretty decent deal, though.  2nd: Ryan Kelly really hasn't impressed. He massively downgraded in his second year. The last first pick is a little enticing, though. Could get some PG depth down there potentially. I think the Lakers get the better end of this one, though.  3rd: I don't see the Rockets flipping Jones unless the deal is really good. Jones is a very respectable stretch big in this league, and while Mason has shown that he can play a very solid backup Center, I don't think he is really close to enough to acquire him. I would take this trade in a minute, though. I like the ""tenor"" of this trade the most, though - if there were some kind of comprabale trade that gets the Nets a tweener shooting forward for Plumlee, that's probably what they should look for."
GoNets,37u1tt,timdunkan,1 point,Sat May 30 13:13:44 2015 UTC,"On point. Hinkie would most definitely want to get more than Mason and a 2nd rounder for RoCo. They already have a future in their twin towers, Plumlee would rott on their bench.  Obligatory ""fire Billy King"" as #1 option"
GoNets,37u1tt,tomchaney479,1 point,Sat May 30 17:08:21 2015 UTC,"Plus, Hinkie trading with Billy King is like taking candy from a baby.  If I were King and teams like the Spurs, Rockets, 76ers, etc. called, I'd hang up the phone immediately.  Nothing good will come from trading with those teams."
GoNets,37u1tt,jimtow28,2,Sun May 31 13:58:30 2015 UTC,"If THOSE are the best packages we could hope to get for Plumlee, we better not trade him. If we made any one of those deals I would be absolutely furious. They are all awful deals for us."
GoNets,37u1tt,shakendfries,1 point,Sun May 31 03:17:10 2015 UTC,"The first deal is cool. I'm not too keen on the second or third. I am not a fan of Ryan Kelly, and Plumlee is worth more than the 18th draft pick in this year's shallow draft. How about this: package Plumlee with Joe to Charlotte for Lance, Marvin Williams, and their draft pick. Stanley Johnson anyone?  ...at least let me dream that King would be able to pull any kind of solid deal off"
GoNets,37u1tt,ynksjts,1 point,Sat May 30 22:20:39 2015 UTC,I doubt we would be able to get all those players and a draft. Nets are more desperate to move Johnson than Charlotte is to move Stephenson.

Prove me wrong Billy!"
GoNets,37h7r5,Joshy_G,10,Wed May 27 16:45:02 2015 UTC,"Typical King. Fucks around too long to make a decision and seeks to sell low. He almost traded Brook for Kendrick Perkins and Reggie Jackson. Then Brook was the best center in the NBA for over a month to close out the year. Right after Mase strings together his poorest string of performances over a 2-3 month period, King puts him on the block. If I'm Billy King, I would be so confident that every decision I make is so worthless and incorrect, that I would hire somebody to just tell me the opposite of what I'm about to do, and see if I can win a championship that way."
GoNets,37h7r5,Ytiradilos,2,Thu May 28 00:33:57 2015 UTC,"meh, I wouldn't be too upset. Brook + Plumlee playing together hasn't worked at all this season man- they were awful together. And he's like 25 or something, so he's not gonna develop into a different player anytime soon. If we could get a younger piece that fits better with our personnel, and can move Mase to a team that needs his strengths more, I think a deal could work out for everyone"

I can understand the craze about ""first round talent"" if it's a young or skilled player, but Royce White at this point is neither. He wasn't good enough to warrant significant minutes on the Rockets or Kings, both of which when they had him had a lot of young players to work with, so I don't see how he could warrant any attention here. Plus, he's 24 at this point so it's not like he's going to be a long-term project either.  Plus, this isn't factoring in his attitude about his anxiety disorder and the attention it'd bring. I'm not convinced that he's had a change of heart and is now ready play at the highest level of basketball."

GoNets,37c70t,amberrelic,6,Tue May 26 15:36:06 2015 UTC,Honestly probably the kings. I don't think we would have gotten swept but we probably would have lost. That Kings team was great
GoNets,37c70t,tadsweet,5,Tue May 26 16:02:42 2015 UTC,"We definitely would have matched up better with the Kings. Still think we would have lost. As amazing as that team was, it wasn't as strong as that Kings team. We'd win the Point Guard match up and that might be it. Kittles was somewhat inconsistent, so I'll give Christie the nod. Van Horn and Peja are a toss up in my opinion, Peja having an offensive edge. Webber was definitely better than K-Mart (even though he was amazing for us) and Divac-MacCulloch isn't even a discussion. Don't know much about their bench 13 years later, but I loved Harris, Jefferson, and Aaron Williams so I'll give us the bench edge due to lack of knowledge and bias."

We beat them at home when they swung by on an Eastern road trip and it was that game when the pundits began saying the Nets were for real.  I thought we had a REALLY good chance at winning it all in the second NBA finals against the Spurs.  We played well against them and had the series tied 2-2 with game 5 going back home, but Kenyon Martin got sick with the flu (he was a beast in that finals) and it went down hill from there."

If you are going to tank you might as well do so at the end of next season when you can get a lottery pick.  The other elephant is the ownership situation which hopefully gets figured out first.

GoNets,35qa89,shakendfries,5,Tue May 12 17:02:11 2015 UTC,I'd rather not pay him 13 mil to not play. Are we going to make a play for a FA or something? I mean we have to wait until after next year for most money to be off the table anyways and he's done with his contract the year after that.
GoNets,35qa89,BasedGodProdigy,3,Tue May 12 17:15:45 2015 UTC,"I disagree, We lead the league in taxes and u think 13 mil is a big deal to the owner.... It makes absolutely ¢0 to keep him on the team. His numbers are worse than Sebastian Telfair. I look at the positive outcome in Detroit only as motivation to make this move. Unless they're going to try and rehash the Sacramento deal from ASW. The majority of fans detest this man and it would only show good faith in getting rid of him sooner either way"
GoNets,35qa89,matty2k,1 point,Tue May 12 21:51:34 2015 UTC,Celtics will take him for another pick.
GoNets,35qa89,Celtic-pride,4,Wed May 13 02:43:47 2015 UTC,"It'd be a horrid move to buy out Williams. The buyout option would only make sense if we were trying to clear major salary to make a play for a prominent FA in 2015. With Johnson, Jack, and probably Brook on the ledger, we're already over the cap. Besides, buying out Williams saves $13 million, but then you need to factor in the guy you sign to play his position. Probably a minimum $6-7 million for someone remotely serviceable. You'd essentially pay $20 million for a league average point guard. Why not just play Williams at that price?"
GoNets,35pvl2,moirakathryn,1 point,Tue May 12 15:12:19 2015 UTC,"To be honest, if we're gonna trade up in the draft, let's trade up for someone with the potential to be the focal point of the team since its clear DWill and Joe Johnson aren't those guys. The first person that comes to mind: Stanley Johnson. He is a young athletic and defensive minded wing, but most importantly, we could allow him to develop behind a guy like Thad- who is overall a solid player, but doesn't have the upside of Stanley Johnson. I am imagining him being given a chance to grow his game like Paul George playing alongside Danny Granger in Indiana.  The two PGs I like best are Jerian Grant and Delon Wright. Grant's quickness is something our team desperately needs, and Delon is not bad either. Hunter seems a bit redundant since we already have Boj who plays a very similar role."
GoNets,35pvl2,shakendfries,5,Tue May 12 17:00:47 2015 UTC,"Stanley Johnson will be LONG gone by the time we even have a chance to trade up. He'll be gone in the lottery, likely in the top 12. If we trade up, we likely won't be able to get higher than the early 20s. We'd have no shot at Stanley Johnson (or Jerian Grant, even though I'd LOVE to have him as well)."

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying this year's word clouds."

GoNets,34y8u2,xSlizzy,6,Tue May 5 18:24:44 2015 UTC,Are you surprised? The Russians have shown they don't want an actual GM who has a vision and isn't afraid to fight the ownership when he wants something. They want a yes man who will make the moves he's asked to and go along with everything.
GoNets,34y8u2,sryans1,1 point,Tue May 5 20:18:59 2015 UTC,"Could you explain this train of thought further?  I highly doubt Prokhorov makes personnel decisions or even names specific players he'd want (short of LeBron). I understand that there has been pressure to win now, and win soon.   But is it that hard to find a GM that wants to win and is willing to spend money? If the Nets were cheapskates then I'd understand wanting to keep a mediocre GM that doesn't complain and doesn't break the bank (like Elgin Baylor with the Clippers for those 22 years). I just assume you might be able to find a moderately competent yes-man.  If I am missing parts of the equation let me know, I just don't get why the Russians calling the shots would settle for mediocrity in the front office the way you are describing."

GoNets,34vu9u,shakendfries,6,Mon May 4 23:56:11 2015 UTC,"The Gerald Wallace trade in the middle of a high-lottery season is still one of the most boneheaded things I have ever seen. Everyone knew that the meat of the team was supposed to come from free agency that summer or the summer after or whatever it was anyway. Gerald Wallace was not going to make Deron Williams stay, only Joe Johnson or Dwight Howard were.  The pick the Nets traded, of course, was their top-6 protected 1st rounder that year which became top-3 protected and the Blazers drafted Damian Fucking Lillard. Pick anyone who went in the top 10 in that draft though and they're helping the team right now more than Gerald Wallace is. No disrespect to him, he had a great career and a good stint with the Nets but that was such an ill-advised piece of business IMO."

GoNets,34vu9u,bpascua4,4,Tue May 5 20:19:02 2015 UTC,If Billy King could just stick to finding talent late in the draft I'd be happy. He just gets the worse end of trade deals most of the time.
GoNets,34vu9u,BrownGuyInNewEngland,1 point,Tue May 5 05:00:43 2015 UTC,"I don't see how this was a disappointing season. Billy King may be a bad GM, but he certainly was under a lot of pressure from ownership to put together a championship team and fast. He did the best he could, and I know I certainly liked the move for Pierce and KG last year and expected to be a contender. Sure, we may be screwed now, but I don't know if is Billy King's fault. We may be a bad team for years to come, but who knows, we may get lucky with one of our draft picks or we may pick up some decent free agents. Anything is possible, although it does seem bleak for us."
GoNets,34vu9u,JJT247,4,Tue May 5 04:25:06 2015 UTC,"This season itself wasn't disappointing but the whole King era has been. The draft pick trades, the insane trade for Pierce and Garnett that totally didn't work out, 4 coaches in 3 years. King did little to improve the Nets.  The only argument in favor of him is no one could have guessed that Deron would collapse the way he did. But Deron and Billy King just destroyed this franchise, we are years away from the light at the end of this tunnel."
GoNets,34vu9u,DJ_Fleetwood_MacBook,2,Tue May 5 06:06:09 2015 UTC,"I believe that Billy King made a lot of these moves due to immense pressure from ownership to build a contender NOW. If I'm wrong, you certainly have a good case for firing him. Ownership wanted to gamble with our draft picks and came up empty. I'm not giving up hope in the Nets just yet though. Who knows what our team will end up looking like in a few years."
GoNets,34vu9u,JJT247,5,Tue May 5 06:35:30 2015 UTC,"What you are saying is half true. Ownership was dying for a contender. There was a ton of pressure put on King to build a team and they were willing to trade draft picks.  However, and this is a huge however, King did a truly atrocious job trying to win now. Instead of building a contender he kept getting mediocre talent and giving up a ton of draft picks without any protections.  Before we even analyze Billy King's Nets tenure let's remember how poor of a job he did in Philly surrounding Allen Iverson with talent, and then how little he got in return from Denver for Iverson. By the time the Nets hired King, he already had a track record of mediocre performance and was a common punching bag for guys like Bill Simmons who made fun of bad GMs.  One of the first things King does as GM is lose the Carmelo auction. But wait, he has an Ace up his sleeves, he traded a ton of talent for Deron. Essentially his whole Nets career is built on him betting that Deron would be an elite NBA player. Lots of people thought that too, but many had seen his fights with Jerry Sloan as red flags. King gambles the Nets' future on Williams and it was a bust. You'd be lying to yourself if you didn't think we'd be better wth 'Melo.  The Joe Johnson trade however is rational, he needed to add another piece to keep Deron in town or else his whole gamble would have failed instantly. Giving up a few picks for Joe isn't the worst thing when that means keeping the whole franchise together. Plus Joe has been decent. Not elite, but not a massive professional failure, like Deron has.  At that point you get into several smaller deals but also the massive Pierce/KG trade. Maybe this works out if Deron isn't a totally worthless basketball player who can barely hold his own in the NBA, but evidently Deron oversaw a depressing, toxic locker room. KG and Pierce started coasting and counting the minutes till they could leave. Maybe those two could have added value somewhere, but you know what? They didn't for the Nets. The only person to blame there is the GM, Billy King.  Other GMs might have made other mistakes in a win now period. But I guarantee most half-decent GMs would have been able to build far superior teams to the ones King did with those assets and an unlimited budget.  Think back to last summer, at first I thought Kidd was a fool, but thinking about King's moves, Kidd would have been a far superior GM. Say what you will about impatient ownership, King failed in his tasks fully."
GoNets,34vu9u,DJ_Fleetwood_MacBook,2,Tue May 5 06:55:14 2015 UTC,"You are probably right. King definitely did not do a good job even if you consider the ""win now"" pressure from ownership.   Also, I'm shocked that some of my above comments are being downvoted. In a sub with relatively little activity, I would think rationally contributing to a discussion would be a good thing. You are not supposed to downvote opinions that you do not agree with people, only posts that are not worth anything."

Sounds different in context compared to ""I'm a free agent"".  Mirza says he wants to be here, but will still listen to his agent regarding what should his best interest be.  Lopez says he wants to be here as well, but i'm more than sure he's been telling himself, ""Why stay here if they're gonna try to trade me again.""  Young says he will stay IF Lopez stays. He's keeping an eye on Lopez's decision.  Nets won't see good cap space until 2016 unless Joe or D-Will get moved this summer.

GoNets,34num4,youngshkuhh,7,Sat May 2 21:48:22 2015 UTC,"Our future is extremely simple. After next season (where we probably won't be too great)...we will have around $65 million to spend in free agency (only Bogs and expiring Dwill are under contract). That FA class will determine our future. Plain and simple. Dwill is the only contract that runs past next year (aside from Bogs 3 million contract). We will have a clean book and max money to spend on the free agent class (with either 65 million or if we can rid of Dwill then it's around 85 million). It all rides on next summer. Next season is the ""bridge year""...  I also assume the Nets will take the options for Plumlee/Karasev after next year so it'll probably be a bit less to spend but still plenty. These numbers also assume we don't resign Thad/Lopez/Teletovic/AA to deals past next year which is probably unrealistic."

GoNets,34num4,yaboyhamandcheese,3,Sun May 3 01:25:39 2015 UTC,"Bro, let's be real: we're kinda fucked. While we moonwalked into the playoffs- Milwaukee is gonna be better, IND is getting PG back, Miami is gonna have Wade, Bosh, nd Dragic. And while Joe nd DWill are gonna decline, Philly has Noel and Embiid and another top 5 pick, the Magic has Oladipo, and every other wack team has a lottery pick. While we stand the chance to moderately improve over the next few seasons, everyone else stands the chance to greatly improve. We need multiple ""miracles"" such as players unexpectedly drastically improving for us to stand a chance. We're heading into James Dolan 2000s Knicks model of old, overpaid players, zero young talent, and zero draft picks. We're gonna be stuck watching the draft like this for the next few seasons"
GoNets,34num4,shakendfries,2,Sun May 3 21:55:51 2015 UTC,"Simply making the playoffs shouldn't be a goal for us, especially in the east.  The fact that we were the 8th seed this year and barely made the playoffs with the talent we have is truly embarrassing.  Unfortunately DWill hasn't been the franchise guy we'd hope he be, especially with the injuries he's had.  Even when healthy, I'm still really disappointed with his lack of aggressiveness to score.  We won't be horrible but we won't be relevant, which in the east, again, is embarrassing.  Unless we make a splash in free agency next summer, as iamjon4 stated above in the thread, we're just going to be a very average team in the eastern conference for a while."
GoNets,34num4,wonlucas,2,Sun May 3 14:02:01 2015 UTC,"It's not gonna be as easy to make the playoffs as it was last year.

GoNets,34num4,DarkFantasy_,2,Sun May 3 17:42:34 2015 UTC,"Making the playoffs in the east is nothing to be excited over. We have made the playoffs consistently recently with nothing to show for it. Why should I care if we JUST crawl into the 8th seed, especially when we dont have our own first round draft choice until 2019?   I feel like the Nets should have done everything in their power to  clear the bad contracts this season. At least then we could make a push for a star in free agency, now that is highly unlikely. Our best chance for success in the short term is to keep Brook Lopez and cross our fingers dwill returns to form, doesnt look too bright to me."

GoNets,34l38p,A_Polite_Noise,3,Sat May 2 02:42:55 2015 UTC,Can't say I enjoyed the season but I did enjoy these last few weeks. We showed out for our squad and they did their best but the Hawks are still the 1st seed and they played great.
GoNets,34l38p,Evilsj,2,Sat May 2 02:51:27 2015 UTC,Bone goal=(
GoNets,34l38p,KarMat,2,Sat May 2 03:08:01 2015 UTC,"Happy we made it as far as we did after this season. Really hoping Lopez, Teletovic and Anderson stick around."
GoNets,34l38p,agentohoolahan,1 point,Sat May 2 08:10:34 2015 UTC,Things will be better next year. Right??? Right????!!!
GoNets,34l38p,DementedWatchmaker,3,Sat May 2 02:40:27 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think they can be. If game 4 Deron shows up more often (big fucking if, I know) and if Mirza comes back healthy I think we'll have a solid team next year."
GoNets,34l38p,agentohoolahan,1 point,Sat May 2 02:44:06 2015 UTC,How do you feel about bogdanovic?
GoNets,34l38p,DementedWatchmaker,2,Sat May 2 14:41:01 2015 UTC,"I like him a lot! I think he looked really good this series and if he can be more consistent defensively, he's going to be a solid piece for us as well. His offensive game seems to be developing well, so I'm excited to see if he can keep growing."
GoNets,34l38p,Bigbadbuck,1 point,Sat May 2 14:47:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks, haven't seen a lot of nets this season so i wanted some inside point of view.  He definitely got talent, reminds me of klay thompson to some extent."
