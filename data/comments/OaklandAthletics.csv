OaklandAthletics,3e56n6,Max_Xevious,6,Wed Jul 22 01:28:50 2015 UTC,Funny thing. I miss him as a player but as a person he struck me as meh. But that is from the outside looking in with limited perspective.
OaklandAthletics,3e56n6,AttemptedWit,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:52:48 2015 UTC,"maybe that was not the best way to state my feelings.   I think off the field he was a bit.. brash... but on the field he plays an amazing 3B. I do not miss him because we have a hole at 3B now, Lawrie fills that just fine for me."

OaklandAthletics,3e3vxf,harriswill,6,Tue Jul 21 19:28:28 2015 UTC,It's interesting that the 2014 A's are also an outlier on this graph. I wonder if the A's emphasis on analytics hasn't led them to a team that maximizes runs scored and minimizes runs allowed but somehow leaves them without some of the pieces needed to efficiently allocate their runs.
OaklandAthletics,3e3vxf,WordSalad11,3,Tue Jul 21 23:28:30 2015 UTC,"Like someone who can start a rally, or will consistently knock in a RISP?"
OaklandAthletics,3e3vxf,aldernon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:41:24 2015 UTC,"I think there's something to that. We often have all the misfit toys that somehow are more than the sum of their parts.  But-- there's not a mega-star to tie it all together.  Giambi, Tejada to some extent, Frank Thomas -- they were just on the next level.  I think Cespedes had ""it"" too. Maybe just a little bit of that fear factor.  The other team looks at the A's are who do they fear now?  We may roll over them sometimes (or more than sometimes) when it all clicks, but if we have to make it click, we can't."

OaklandAthletics,3e4qe9,MrSaladFork,4,Wed Jul 22 03:20:24 2015 UTC,i'm so confused because blue jays GDT says lawrie had something on his neck and our GDT says graveman does
OaklandAthletics,3e4qe9,Raidenbobalay,5,Wed Jul 22 03:19:47 2015 UTC,Reddick kills lefties. Everybody knows that.
OaklandAthletics,3e4qe9,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,3,Wed Jul 22 03:19:32 2015 UTC,Reddick hit against a lefty? Aliens.
OaklandAthletics,3e4qe9,Mister_Big,3,Wed Jul 22 03:19:07 2015 UTC,"Sooo did anyone else notice the ""substance"" on Graveman's neck? I really hope it doesn't turn into one of those games."
OaklandAthletics,3e4qe9,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,4,Wed Jul 22 03:16:13 2015 UTC,"I just rewatched it.  It was a close-up of Lawrie, not Graveman."
OaklandAthletics,3e4qe9,Mister_Big,2,Wed Jul 22 03:20:35 2015 UTC,I want to say the guy I saw was on the mound. I don't know if the Jays broadcast uses different angles.
OaklandAthletics,3e4qe9,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,2,Wed Jul 22 03:23:35 2015 UTC,I was watching the Jays broadcast but I came here to see if anyone noticed.  they showed an extreme close-up to the side of his head but I paused at the right time and could catch Lawrie's name on the back of the jersey.  I initially thought it was Graveman too.
OaklandAthletics,3e4qe9,Mister_Big,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:25:17 2015 UTC,"Wooo! Wait, is that still illegal on a position player?"

OaklandAthletics,3e4qe9,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,3,Wed Jul 22 03:35:35 2015 UTC,"Haven't seen it yet, but that seems like its only an issue if the Umpire feels like making it one. I see it every once in a while, hope Davidson doesn't feel like intervening in the game."
OaklandAthletics,3e4qe9,MichaelChicklis,2,Wed Jul 22 03:18:52 2015 UTC,Most teams only call it out when the game is going sideways. They know their guys do it too.
OaklandAthletics,3e4qe9,Ethanhekker,2,Wed Jul 22 03:21:21 2015 UTC,"Good point, it is usually an opposing coaches observation rather than the ump."

OaklandAthletics,3e4qe9,Jess52,2,Wed Jul 22 03:14:58 2015 UTC,It was definitely tar. Like blatantly.
OaklandAthletics,3e4qe9,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,2,Wed Jul 22 03:15:55 2015 UTC,Pretty sure is was. They should suspend him indefinitely and fine the A's for all the money they have ban Billy beane and shut down the A's organization. /s
OaklandAthletics,3e4qe9,Jess52,2,Wed Jul 22 03:17:17 2015 UTC,That only happens if the Jays start losing. I mean that and it's a stupid rule that needs draconian enforcement.
OaklandAthletics,3e4qe9,Raidenbobalay,2,Wed Jul 22 03:18:43 2015 UTC,Yeah as soon as the A's score they will pull graveman.

OaklandAthletics,3e4uns,slinkey1998,2,Tue Jul 21 23:39:34 2015 UTC,Damn that guy has some nasty stuff. Maybe this trade would've allowed them to move Montero to the rotation so they could trade Kaz? Not really certain how major league ready Montero truly is.
OaklandAthletics,3e4uns,MichaelChicklis,0,Wed Jul 22 00:01:41 2015 UTC,why not take the gamble ben is going to be a f/a after this year anyway so its a win win kinda sorta
OaklandAthletics,3e4uns,joeydeno,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:13:28 2015 UTC,"I'm a little confused what you mean?   Are you saying that we should keep Zobrist anyways because he is going to be a free agent and we still could make a run at it? Because we wouldn't get anything from Zobrist if he becomes a free agent.  If that isn't what you mean, my bad."
OaklandAthletics,3e4uns,MichaelChicklis,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:19:54 2015 UTC,im saying trade him to us for montero. so when zobrist hits f/a you guys still keep montero right? if you do then its a win win because you keep montero and if you guys still want him in f/a you can still sign him back.
OaklandAthletics,3e4uns,joeydeno,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:21:20 2015 UTC,"Ahahah sorry didn't know you were a Mets fan (on mobile, can't see flair)  Yeah we apparently wanted to make the trade but Wilpon didn't want to pay the extra 3million that Zobrist's contract was worth for the rest of the year. Now I guess we gotta trade him to the damn Yankees."
OaklandAthletics,3e4uns,MichaelChicklis,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:25:26 2015 UTC,i mean if you guys will take in the salary possibly montero and nimmo or fulmer could be thrown in also to sweeten the deal. would that be good for both sides or no?
OaklandAthletics,3e4uns,joeydeno,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:27:50 2015 UTC,"That's the goal, yes, for it to work out for both sides.  I have a feeling Zobrist will be had for less than Montero and Nimmo, though."

OaklandAthletics,3e34rh,frakking-anustart2,2,Tue Jul 21 22:58:28 2015 UTC,"I have no idea why Milwalkee gave up on Nashville. I mean for most of the 2000's they had stadiums that were the worst in the high minors (Joe W Davis Stadium, a pile of crap but inagurated by Canseco and Big Mac and Greer Stadium) and all I would read is ""Nashville looking for a new park"" but I guess the Brewers never wanted to help them build one.   So they left the Brewers in the lurch and picked a better team. And build what is apparently a dream stadium.  And then the Brewers moved the Stars to Biloxi for a new stadium, and were stuck with the Colorado Springs Sky Sox (shit stadium), which is so close to the Rockies its a shock aren't their affiliate. Except- Colorado City doesn't want to build a new stadium.  Tl; dr-minor league politics are bizzare and the Milwalkee Brewers suck at it. GO SOUNDS"
OaklandAthletics,3e34rh,frakking-anustart2,2,Tue Jul 21 17:32:37 2015 UTC,"The Brewers GM was ultra-pissed the Sounds paired up with the A's. they were apparently blindsided by the change.   But I guess that also feeds into your ""Brewers suck at minors politics"" theory. I went to Brewers-era Sounds games. they were pretty terrible. Even with the Sounds struggles, they are much more exciting to watch, and the amount of call ups has been a lot of fun.  That said, I'm a bias A's fan who won the Affiliation-lottery."

OaklandAthletics,3e1vjo,floatate,4,Tue Jul 21 16:46:04 2015 UTC,"Stay downtown or in Jack London Square. The Coliseum area isn't particularly safe if you don't know where you're going and there isn't much to do.  Take BART to the game.  If you want beer, go to the pizza/beer stand behind section 218. The $15 calzones are really good and (almost) worth it. The pizza is not.  I'd get ""lower box"" seats in section 106-108. In my opinion these are the best value good seats. You'll be right next to the Jays bullpen on the line, low rows are usually available. Don't buy in the first 3 rows of the second deck, there is a rail in the way."
OaklandAthletics,3e1vjo,fsites,2,Tue Jul 21 17:29:49 2015 UTC,Can I just say I've seen Toronto away games in 3 cities across America and I have never seen fans travel in larger numbers than y'all. Is it like the only time y'all come to America?
OaklandAthletics,3e1vjo,frakking-anustart2,5,Tue Jul 21 17:26:31 2015 UTC,"I take it you've never seen an away Yankees, Red Sox, Cardinals, or Cubs game?"
OaklandAthletics,3e1vjo,fsites,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:57:30 2015 UTC,"Yankees are a whole nother topic. Jeets last TX game was mostly Yanks fans. Its a cliche.  Tons of away Cardinals games, but other than the one in KC it was pretty mild. Cubs fans don't travel well either.  Idk about the Red Sox, but aren't you a Red Sox Fan?"
OaklandAthletics,3e1vjo,frakking-anustart2,3,Tue Jul 21 18:00:49 2015 UTC,"True, everyone wanted to see Jeter the last year. This just got me needlessly thinking and looking up stats lol.   Check this out... it's ranking team by attendance when they are on the road. Toronto is dead last, Giants are first.  My thought is that it's a decent indicator as how well fans travel, but is skewed for a couple reasons.  Toronto is an AL East team, meaning they play the Rays a lot who are last in attendance at 14,700/game.   Giants are top of the list since they play the Dodgers who have a huge stadium and are first in attendance. Every team but the rockies in the division is top 6.  Cubs are 3rd.   Miami is 11th, right above the Cardinals which surprised me."
OaklandAthletics,3e1vjo,fsites,2,Tue Jul 21 18:08:50 2015 UTC,"Team attendance on the road is weird- not like all those away teams sign in or anything lol  Seems a bit unbelievable.... or as you said, skewed. I'll look for one that's more accurate and see."

OaklandAthletics,3e1vjo,thedudeyousee,5,Tue Jul 21 15:35:44 2015 UTC,You can also never knock him for effort.   He is intense... has Red Bull in his veins.

OaklandAthletics,3e1vjo,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,3,Tue Jul 21 16:55:09 2015 UTC,"With Russel Martin - Canadian all-star catcher coming in i really thought he would be my favourite player on the jays this year, but JD - with his attitude, defense, intensity, bat, power, twitter handle and having in the air tonight as his walk up music its not even a contest. I still think Billy Beane is a genius and probably will win this trade long run, but timeline wise this trade just seemed to make sense for both teams."
OaklandAthletics,3e1vjo,thedudeyousee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:14:02 2015 UTC,"As much as JD would've been great to have on the team this year, our offense hasn't been our problem. So unless he could've pitched well in relief, we probably wouldn't be doing much better.  So that being said, I think that it was absolutely a win-win trade!"
OaklandAthletics,3e1vjo,pg2441,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:46:03 2015 UTC,"Maybe he worked on it in the offseason, but the one part of his game I never liked was his lack of hustle out of the batters box. There were a couple times last year he's get in 0 for eternity slumps and he'd hit a weak roller to third where the 3b would juggle and bobble the ball and he'd barely be jogging to first and get thrown out."
OaklandAthletics,3e1vjo,fsites,2,Tue Jul 21 22:40:22 2015 UTC,"Mostly alright, but his at-bats are stressful. The guy will throw the bat at anything called a ""first pitch"" or a ""strike out swinging""."

Attendance though is always tough to swallow.  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wUQVXydZn6V_focsO9ama6P3n0ok9Wx7-k7k15xbIUk/htmlview?usp=sharing&sle=true#"
OaklandAthletics,3dydxs,borntoperform,11,Mon Jul 20 15:27:27 2015 UTC,"Our attendance really isn't bad anymore. No, we're not selling out every night, but on weeknight games we still get around 15-20,000 people.  There was that video moving around here a couple weeks ago of the 2012 walkoff compilations, and even towards the end of that fantastic season, the stands were almost completely empty. It's a huge difference from how it is now."
OaklandAthletics,3dydxs,emcee_paz,2,Mon Jul 20 17:35:37 2015 UTC,"we still get around 15-20,000 people.   That's half the SF crowd. Albeit, with a worse team and worse stadium."
OaklandAthletics,3dydxs,Max_Xevious,7,Mon Jul 20 21:13:59 2015 UTC,"I'm not comparing, I'm making a point about increased ticket sales.  What were SF's average attendances after Barry Bonds, and before 2010? Probably not great. Success creates more fans.  3 straight postseason appearances with two division titles? Yeah, attendance is going up.  3 world series in 5 years? Yeah, attendance will go up."
OaklandAthletics,3dydxs,surfingyt,4,Mon Jul 20 22:09:27 2015 UTC,"It's about the same number of actual, engaged, educated fans though. Not lots of people at O.Co to get a crab samwich, ghiredelli sundae and post selfies to Instagram instead of actually watching a game."

OaklandAthletics,3dydxs,NightWriter500,8,Mon Jul 20 15:29:25 2015 UTC,Giants have sold out something like 370 games in a row.
OaklandAthletics,3dydxs,Xtorting,6,Mon Jul 20 17:06:12 2015 UTC,"""Sold out"" by loopholes and technicalities no other team uses. I bet the Red Sox team would love to have boughten the rest of their unsold tickets to keep their sold out streak going."
OaklandAthletics,3dydxs,NightWriter500,5,Mon Jul 20 17:39:20 2015 UTC,"Sold out... By the same ways every other team in every other sport uses. I mean, I'm an A's fan, but I've still been to 8 Giants games this year. It's always packed. A lot of the seats are bought up by companies and handed out that way, and sometimes those people don't show. Those seats are still ""sold out."""
OaklandAthletics,3dydxs,Xtorting,2,Mon Jul 20 19:26:08 2015 UTC,"Loopholes and technicalities no other team uses, at least the Red Sox or the A's.    Turns out, the Giants and many other sports franchises do not define a sellout as the experience of running out of tickets to sell. Rather, a sellout is when the number of tickets distributed - including complimentary passes for players, employees and sponsors; tickets for seats with obstructed views; and standing-room-only passes - exceeds the team's definition of seating capacity. For the Giants, that number is 41,500 - not 41,915 - said Russ Stanley, the team's head of ticket sales.    http://www.sfgate.com/giants/article/SF-Giants-sellout-streak-a-numbers-game-3882485.php"
OaklandAthletics,3dydxs,NightWriter500,6,Mon Jul 20 19:36:33 2015 UTC,"Loopholes and technicalities no other team uses  the Giants and many other sports franchises   Way to contradict yourself within the first two sentences of your own argument. Besides, is your point really that they consider 41,500 a sellout instead of 41,915? Because... that's weak. We're talking about a difference of 0.09% of capacity. I'm telling you, it's always packed there."
OaklandAthletics,3dydxs,Xtorting,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:47:01 2015 UTC,"Those include Football, Basketball, Hockey, College, you name it. We're talking about Baseball and the Red Sox didn't use these analytics when they stated their sold out streak ended. That .09% is the difference between a sold out game and a game with available seating to some teams."
OaklandAthletics,3dydxs,Xtorting,2,Mon Jul 20 19:55:44 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I'm saying. That same procedure is used in nearly all venues of all sports. To say ""loopholes no other team uses"" is grossly exaggerating. The Giants have sold at least 41,500 seats for over 370 games in a row- whether or not there were standing-room spaces available occasionally matters very little. Also, according to the quickest Google search, 41,500 is the listed capacity for AT&T."

OaklandAthletics,3dydxs,bherdt,2,Tue Jul 21 16:47:32 2015 UTC,Ticket price is probably a factor because it is from TicketCity.com. Stroking the egos of fans who have to pay more for their tickets is probably the sound business strategy for a company that makes it's money by reselling tickets.
OaklandAthletics,3dydxs,Raidenbobalay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:25:20 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming weighing ticket price vs. attendance was used as a shorthand for fan enthusiasm – if you're willing to spend more money on a ticket, that might mean you're more enthusiastic about the team.   Of course, all that really does is count wealthier fanbases as ""better fans"", which is super problematic on a ton of different levels."
OaklandAthletics,3dydxs,Worthyness,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:50:22 2015 UTC,"Yep. Because if you live in an area with a higher cost of living, it basically means you're a better baseball fan"
OaklandAthletics,3dydxs,surfingyt,8,Tue Jul 21 02:32:41 2015 UTC,"From the Facebook Comments   I think the attendance/capacity percentage numbers are wrong for the A's. The raw data says 39.67%/39.98% for Raw and Indexed data, which puts them dead last. Accoring to ESPN's 2014 attendance numbers, the A's ranked #13 in attendance/capacity percentage at 71.4%. I'm wondering if the football capicity of the Coliseum (63,000) was used instead of the baseball capacity (35,000).   Yeah, it's a pretty silly data set. It also looks like they counted our Metropolitan area population as the entire bay area, not just the A's territory. The Mets also got penalized because of this."

OaklandAthletics,3dydxs,untouchable765,4,Mon Jul 20 19:03:02 2015 UTC,"I think (hope) it was just bad editing. I think that picture was supposed to acknowledge the fact that the A's fans are a small but passionate group, not representative of the poll, but it never came across."
OaklandAthletics,3dydxs,Jess52,2,Mon Jul 20 19:17:51 2015 UTC,It was done intentionally sarcastically. The entire article was kind of like that. I am actually glad they didn't make mention of the A's except for the image (almost like the writer was lodging a complaint).

OaklandAthletics,3dyznu,idontusejelly,4,Tue Jul 21 07:21:27 2015 UTC,It's not price gouging if people are willing to pay it. It's called a market rate. San Francisco is filled with lots of rich people who love their team that just won the World Series three times in the last six years. Frankly the fact that tickets on the secondary market are so highly priced right now tells us that the Giants were not charging enough money for the tickets in the first place. Just because you're used to paying $20 bucks to sit at the OCo doesn't mean you're entitled to pay the same at AT&T. It sucks but it's the nature of the beast in a city like SF.

That's the whole dynamic pricing thing and the only way teams can stay relevant to actual market value. The difference is Giants premium games cost more than A's premium games. I saw tickets go up right in front of me earlier on the A's site while browsing for tonights game.  I don't want to pay it either. Price gouging would be more accurate if they were charging so much that very few people could pay it and the place was only half full with people who paid the premium price. If they are selling out at this price, then that's market rate."

OaklandAthletics,3dwqpl,Jess52,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:18:55 2015 UTC,I've never though about how Reddick and Vogt are 22/21 and they're our best hitters. Gotta have those paired numbers for maximum swag.

The yanks won today so we're probably like 3rd best in the AL now.   But still good series. I think last nights game took the life out of us

OaklandAthletics,3dqypu,JumboShrimp1234,16,Sat Jul 18 16:38:51 2015 UTC,It's really more about the people. Go sit in the bleachers and listen to the chants. Go take a picture with banjo man (donations accepted) and the other dudes in costumes.  There isn't a whole lot to see in the coliseum itself. Maybe go check out the murals on the west side club level concourse. Those are pretty cool.

There's a little hall of fame type thing on deck two on the 3b side of the club. The food is on the first deck, there's also an auction spot in one of the inlets behind the plate on the concourse if you like memorabilia. The Bart bridge as the guy said above and the tailgates in D lot on the north side of the stadium are worth it if you go early. Otherwise if you want a good seat walk into the west side club and down one of the stairwells (oft unguarded) to the padded seats in foul ball territory."

The Coliseum is probably the least aesthetically pleasing stadium in all of baseball but there's some hardcore fans there that know how to have fun! And hey, less distractions = more watching baseball!"

OaklandAthletics,3dqypu,Chris_Parker,2,Sun Jul 19 04:19:51 2015 UTC,"Diablo dogs are absolutely delicious. Not as spicy as you'd think, though, which is kind of a bummer. Hotdog, nacho cheese, fried onion flakes, bacon. I'm getting aroused just thinking of it.  Like everyone else said, though, it's more the experience of just being there. Right field bleachers, like 148/149 are going to be the most active cheerers, especially down towards the front of the section. Take in the view from any of the decks, walk around the concourse before the game.  If you go into Mt. Davis (second deck, the indoor section behind center field) there is a bar and a big beer selection tucked into a corner on the left field side of it. Pretty much directly underneath that, on the ""ground level,"" there's this little drink place that sells $9 cocktails, which I think is probably the cheapest you'll find in the park. If you go mid-game it's usually not crowded at all.  If you choose to park in the parking lot, they actually allow you to tailgate and shit, so go nuts. At the subreddit meetup, we had this 41 year-old rapper do some a capella verse and we paid tipped him with beer and a quarter. If you take BART, just wait to get in to go to the bathroom. You can get some knockoff merch and snacks on the ramp to the Coliseum, and even though it's not necessarily the most scenic industrialized area it has a nice view of the park.  Oh, and get to your seat early so you can watch the intro video they play on the new scoreboards. I've seen a lot of first-timers from out of the area say they really dug watching it."

If you're worried about someone stealing it, it's what I did and neither my ref Vogt or Sonny gnome was stolen, nor did I hear about it happening to anyone else's around me.  Now, if you forget about it when you're leaving the game then yes, it will be gone because people will actually stay after the game and check all the seats for forgotten bobble heads."
OaklandAthletics,3dqy52,TGS1985,2,Sat Jul 18 17:50:29 2015 UTC,"Can confirm the last bit, opening day (night) 2014 my friend and his aunt searched a few sections looking for any rally towels or magnet calendars left behind."
OaklandAthletics,3dqy52,Fire2box,4,Sat Jul 18 20:38:32 2015 UTC,No. Those people you see leaving after they get bobbleheads have another ticket so they can enter
OaklandAthletics,3dqy52,OAKgravedigger,3,Sat Jul 18 20:05:04 2015 UTC,"I was wondering, do bobbleheads usually go away fast? At what time should I get there to not miss out?"
OaklandAthletics,3dqy52,venturaj95,3,Sat Jul 18 19:17:13 2015 UTC,"I assume so, but it's hello kitty bobble head night and it's the twins. so likely not as fast as grey or vogt statues."
OaklandAthletics,3dqy52,Fire2box,3,Sat Jul 18 20:36:06 2015 UTC,"I showed up for the Ref Stephen Vogt bobblehead an hour and 15 minutes early and they still had like 8 large unopened boxes of the bobble heads at the Mt Davis entry gates.  Showed up about an hour before for the Sonny Solar Gnome and they had like a dozen boxes left.  Honestly if you show up no later than 1 hour before the game you should get one easily. I think because these promotions have been 15,000 strong and the A's playing so mediocre, it's not nearly as hard to get one this season."
OaklandAthletics,3dqy52,TGS1985,2,Sat Jul 18 21:48:41 2015 UTC,"What you've probably seen is people get the giveaway, and give it to someone they're with who hasn't scanned their ticket yet, that person goes and puts it in the car, then comes back and enters.    But once they get in, they have to hold onto theirs.  Inevitably, someone's going to be holding on to one.  But yeah, if theft is what you're worried about, don't be.  Keep it on you at all times, and you'll be fine."

Shut down for a month means he comes back in September. There's no point in aggressively trying to bring him back for September."
OaklandAthletics,3doghb,tdov,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:02:19 2015 UTC,Shut down means he will have no baseball activity for a month. He won't be even starting baseball activity until late August. The news means he likely will not return this season. They'll have him throwing to see where he's at. Susan thinks we won't see him in a game again this year.

OaklandAthletics,3dmc84,CantSpellAmateur,-2,Fri Jul 17 22:14:38 2015 UTC,"Run differential is truly a pointless statistic that is shiny so people like to look at it.  Is there a correlation?  Sure.  Does correlation equal causation?  No.  When baseball moves to a Nascar style points system a run differential will become important.  This is baseball, you have to score more than your opponent when you're playing them.  Not a week or two earlier/later."

OaklandAthletics,3dkpb1,GuyBelowMeDoesntLift,3,Fri Jul 17 02:46:28 2015 UTC,I don't think a tiebreaker game will be required if they manage to string together a 70 game win streak
OaklandAthletics,3dkpb1,Johnb628,4,Fri Jul 17 02:48:57 2015 UTC,So we'll suspend disbelief for a 70 73 game win streak for the A's but not a 64-10 run for the Angels?
OaklandAthletics,3dkpb1,GuyBelowMeDoesntLift,6,Fri Jul 17 02:57:37 2015 UTC,"The angels will actually go on to lose 74 in a row. Finishing the year at 48-114. However, the Rangers go 71-2, finishing with the same exact record as us. It's the A's vs Rangers playing game 163 to see who will win the division. The game goes to the 22nd inning and the A's trail by 2 heading into the bottom half. The only position player left on the bench is Jake Smolinski, who hits a walk-off 3 run HR to beat his former team, and send the A's to the divisional series where they start a 10-0 run in the postseason and win the WS. capping of an 82 game winning streak that starts tomorrow"
OaklandAthletics,3dkpb1,bderrig,2,Fri Jul 17 03:29:35 2015 UTC,"It's actually impossible for that to happen because we play the Rangers more than 2 times the rest of the year, so assuming we win them all they would have more than 2 losses the rest of the way"

Anyways it's pretty simple. You let the raiders movie to LA, raider fans deal with it since their team hasn't been able to compete in their division since they blew it in the super bowl 10+ years ago. the only thing keeping raiders alive in oakland is just their fans.   Of course only being a real A's fan for maybe 3 seasons at best a's likely have been almost or as bad as Raider's and everyone in the world knows about ""moneyball"" anyways.

The most likely trade would be him + an OF prospect, but with so, so many teams interested in Zobrist, Zobrist being a top-5 player in baseball since 2011 by WAR (look it up), positional flexibility, and we're looking at a whole big mess of who the fuck knows.  Someone will pay something that looks like way too much for Zobrist when it's all said and done. Whether that's Plawecki or Nimmo from you guys, we'll just have to wait and see."

Abad, O-Flats and Otero have gone from solid to train wreck in one offseason, and I just can't imagine that all 3 will keep up the suckitude for the second half. Plus with Venditte and Doolittle (hopefully) returning, the bullpen should look quite a bit different after the all star break."

The run differential is largely a result of winning big and losing small. We've only had a couple blowouts against us, and every one-run loss we see only adds the chagrin we feel looking at our record. Personally, I think it's a somewhat inconsistent offense that wouldn't be as much of a problem if the bullpen was consistent. When the bullpen folds, the offense can't always be there to get the lead back and good starters are sometimes left with a lack of run support in otherwise phenomenal starts."

OaklandAthletics,3d7x2t,HalfAHattrick,4,Tue Jul 14 19:26:42 2015 UTC,"Awesome post. As of now, I'd say:  -I'm a little indifferent towards the D-No/Hahn trade so far, and I think it will be another year before we can really start to judge who won, but I like Hahn's potential to be a front of the rotation guy in the future. If Alvarez turns into a reliable reliever over the next five years it could be huge for us.  -Trading Donaldson was heartbreaking and I'm a little disappointed in Lawrie this season, especially his plate discipline. That being said, Graveman reminds me of Tim Hudson with his ability to generate ground balls with his sinker. Even if Nolin doesn't pan out, which I'm not super optimistic about, Barreto looks awesome. At this point, it's hard to say trading 4 years of Donaldson under team control is worth it, and I think it will come down to how Lawrie develops in the next season and a half.  -I'm a big fan of the Samardzija trade. Ynoa has been completely quiet for the past few years in our system, and I think he's been overrated based on his hype when we signed him.  Semien's offense has been nice, and he won't necessarily be playing shortstop for the entirety of the next 5.5 years we control him depending on how soon Barreto comes up. A transition back to second base will allow him to relax more.  Bassit has flashed a lot of potential, as has Ravelo.  I love Phegley as a solid defensive backup catcher, and his offense has been a pleasant surprise.  All this for one year of Samardzija (who we weren't going to re-sign anyways) and an overrated Ynoa is fantastic in my mind.  -Joey Wendle seems like one of those random guys no one has heard of that Billy Beane finds and who turns into a stud. He may very well not pan out, but Billy sold Moss at the peak of his value, and I can't see him duplicating his 2014 numbers in the future.  -The trades for Zobrist/Clippard will all depend on how this season and the trade deadline play out.  It will hurt losing Robertson, although I've always thought he and Powell were slightly overrated. Obviously Boog is proving me wrong so far this year.  If we decide to sell both Clippard and Zobrist at the deadline, I think we could definitely get a higher return than we gave up to get them.  Especially Zobrist is in high demand, and will require at least one top-level prospect to get. Clippard is a solid bullpen arm that a lot of contenders could use, and could also fetch a decent prospect. Since they both are free agents after the year if we decide to hold onto them we had better have a great shot at making the playoffs. If we extend Zobrist a qualifying offer in the offseason and he walks then we would receive a first round pick, but I doubt that we would do so for Clippard.    Personally I'd like to see us trade Zobrist, Clippard, and for that matter Kazmir, because I think that based on the previous trades we are set up for a deep run in 2017 and beyond. Trading them would help strengthen those teams, and based on our bad luck to start the season, I don't think we have much of a shot at a playoff berth, much less a World Series anyways. I guess only time will tell on these, but I think Billy did a good job at setting us up to be very competitive in the near future without a complete teardown."
OaklandAthletics,3d7x2t,HalfAHattrick,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:54:00 2015 UTC,Moss was not at the peak of his value.  He was hurt and everyone knew it.
OaklandAthletics,3d7x2t,IAMADeinonychusAMA,4,Wed Jul 15 22:21:51 2015 UTC,"Good work on those numbers. Thanks. I'm a European, so forgive me for my baseball illiteracy. I know that some of these trades can only be judged in fairness a few years from now, and I know that this is not an opinion piece, but what is you guys' general evaluation of these - are they decent trades, when not considering the hurting of the fanbase's feelings?"
OaklandAthletics,3d7x2t,moorethanafeeling,6,Tue Jul 14 08:46:13 2015 UTC,"Derek Norris trade: Easily a win for the A's. Jesse Hahn's been absolutely fantastic in the rotation so far this year – his 3.35 ERA ranks 16th in the American League, and he's gotten progressively better every month. RJ Alvarez is a wildcard, but he's been absolutely dominating AAA this season, and I think he probably deserves a spot in the bullpen right now. The real win of this trade is the fact that it opened up playing time for Stephen Vogt and Josh Phegley, who've been the best catching tandem in the AL, and probably only second to Posey/Susac in the MLB.  Jeff Samardzija trade: This one is also a win for the A's, but not quite as cut and dry. The problem with this one was that Samardzija was acquired last year for the A's best prospect, a really young shortstop who looks pretty destined to be a superstar. Any return for Samardzija is going to be colored by the fact that it's probably a net loss. That said, they did get a good return for him. Semien's the everyday shortstop, pretty excellent offensively but has been atrocious defensively. He's been rapidly improving (this is his first year at SS in the MLB), but yeah, it hasn't been pretty. He's still incredibly valuable and a great piece for this team going forward. Josh Phegley's been the best backup catcher in baseball, so that's a huge get. Chris Bassitt is currently the A's #6 starter, and he's been rock solid filling in for injuries. It's a real luxury to have a quality backup starting pitcher. Ravelo's a wildcard and is still a year+ away, so we'll see.   Brandon Moss trade: This was a salary dump, pretty plain and simple. He was getting paid upwards of $10 million, the A's didn't think he was worth that, and they dumped him for whatever they could get. Probably a good move, but he was a huge fan favorite, so that's pretty sad. Joey Wendle is fairly promising, so that's nice.  Josh Donaldson trade: Oh man, this is the one. The fanbase is still fuming over this one. It might turn out to be a good trade, but it looks bad right now. Brett Lawrie has been fairly average – disappointing defensively but above-average offensively. He's very young, and he's got room to grow. Kendall Graveman's been excellent since he came up from the minor leagues, putting up a 1.94 ERA in the past 30 days – he's essentially been a top-5 pitcher in the MLB since May. That's really good, and really surprising. Franklin Barreto and Sean Nolin are still a ways away – Barreto because he's 19, Nolin because he's spent the year injured – but they both look really promising.   The reason this trade looks bad is because Josh Donaldson's the 2nd best player in the American league, 3rd best overall (I've got Bryce Harper and Mike Trout over him). There is no return that looks good when you're giving up that sort of player. He's almost 30, and we'll see how he looks in a couple years, but man. He's such a good player."
OaklandAthletics,3d7x2t,moorethanafeeling,5,Tue Jul 14 10:49:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the evaluation! Man, some of being new to watching baseball is the continuous astonishment of how many tangible facts there can be put on any given player.    Being from the soccer crazy Europe, everything is just so subjective - I mean, we have goals and assists, and km run in a match, but aside from that, everything is gut feeling - at least from a fan perspective.   I really look forward to see if you Americans can improve on that, MLS having quite a boost in popularity and all."
OaklandAthletics,3d7x2t,untouchable765,3,Tue Jul 14 11:30:46 2015 UTC,"One of the things I love about baseball is the amount of information available to measure and compare individual player performance. It's a team sport in theory but virtually every action can be isolated into discrete parts that can be quantified. This means when you're discussing how to improve the team, you can actually point to concrete facts and can backup assertions with actual evidence. I love American football,  basketball and soccer but it's much harder to do this because each players performance involves variables affected by other players on the field. It's harder to isolate individual performance. I feel like when I'm discussing one of the other sports, the conversation just goes in circles but with baseball, you can actually be right/wrong.   Also, re:soccer, it's definitely growing here. I've noticed a huge surge in interest over the last ten or so years. Its great."

Sure, a ball could end up in that section. But not very many, probably not even one per game (let alone three or four). And if it does, it's not going that fast anymore. I caught a foul ball in section 214 and it wasn't moving very fast by that point."

OaklandAthletics,3d5uac,DocCalculus,5,Tue Jul 14 02:05:57 2015 UTC,"Of course not. ""Ban the wave"" movements are largely fanbase driven though some stadiums jokingly adopt a no-wave policy (Rangers stadium being one of them). Its not practical or advisable for a baseball organization to actually try to ban the wave. I do think the wave is dumb and wish people wouldn't do it but if I'm being serious, I also believe people should enjoy the game any way they want."
OaklandAthletics,3d5uac,Bgro,5,Tue Jul 14 02:36:50 2015 UTC,"Gotcha. I'd actually managed to miss the fact that Rangers had formalized it (even in a tongue in cheek way), so yeah in retrospect its sort of obvious that you weren't suggesting a rule enforced by O.co staff.   This whole situation (what the lady is proposing) has me sort of conflicted. On the one hand, I don't think I want pole to pole nets. On the other hand people have pointed out how quickly (both time and speed) objects can leave the field. While a ball is something you may at least attempt to catch, a broken bat shard is something you just have to bail away from and when that comes windmilling into the seats along the third base line, its mostly just a matter of luck about whether everyone's going to be able to get away from it. And while an athletic young person may dive away from a  missile, it may be almost as dangerous for an older person to go diving across seats as to take a ball in the shoulder. Every year a couple fans are injured, sometimes critically by a bat or ball.   All this kinda reminds me of that incident a couple years ago when a first base coach was hit in the he'd with a ball and killed. The mlb quickly instituted rules about coaches (and other ancillary people on the field) wearing helmits and I think that was met by very little negative feedback by people in baseball. It's interesting that players and coaches adopt these measures more readily than fans."

Peak forces exceed 8,300 pounds – enough to stop a Mini Cooper, rolling at 10 mph, in its tracks.'  And when you find a Mini Cooper parked 1"" in front of a hard-hit ball, let me know.

OaklandAthletics,3d4nsl,ANDRADE101,4,Mon Jul 13 20:58:47 2015 UTC,I don't think Beane would be interested in Baez. He's a hacker with a terrible approach at the plate. I don't see him ever figuring it out. I'd rather target some high floor guys.
OaklandAthletics,3d4nsl,Bgro,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:37:44 2015 UTC,"He has a ton of power, though, especially for a middle infielder. We're talking about the same general manager who acquired guys like Jack Cust, Yoenis Cespedes, Brandon Moss, and Brett Lawrie, all of whom have high strikeout percentages. So long as the player can hit, and Baez certainly can, I don't think Beane really cares."
OaklandAthletics,3d4nsl,slinkey1998,4,Mon Jul 13 17:41:24 2015 UTC,"Cust and Moss are very disciplined hitters, not the same at all. Cespedes and Lawrie have better contact skills and line drive rates. Baez is a popup/flyball hitter. He reminds me more of Brandon Wood. His defense isn't even that great. I just don't see Beane targeting a guy with such high bust potential."
OaklandAthletics,3d4nsl,Bgro,2,Mon Jul 13 17:54:26 2015 UTC,"I think his approach has changed, though. It's a small sample size, but his LD% in AAA this season has skyrocketed to 27.7% and his IFB% sits at only 5%. He isn't missing as many pitches as he was before, either."
OaklandAthletics,3d4nsl,slinkey1998,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:07:56 2015 UTC,"Maybe he has changed but, as you mentioned, its a small sample size. I think he's played like 37 games this year in AAA and he's hurt currently."

OaklandAthletics,3d4nsl,ziggmiceter,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:38:09 2015 UTC,I don't think the Cubs would take all three of those players for baez
OaklandAthletics,3d4nsl,feedthekitty,0,Mon Jul 13 15:19:13 2015 UTC,"If the Athletics trade all the players you said, we will be even worse than we are now. Why would we trade Clippard, are best closer BY FAR, when we have more bull pen problems than anyone in the league? I don't mind trading Kaz and getting a great reliever. I like Zobrist but I don't know how I feel about his knee."
OaklandAthletics,3d4nsl,AnxiousPatient,5,Mon Jul 13 17:08:35 2015 UTC,"The three players I mentioned above are free agents next season and offer no value to the A's future. This team, according to FanGraphs, has a 3.6% chance of winning a wild card spot. Not only are they eight games back of a wild card spot, but they're also the worst team in the American League, making any hope of contention evermore dismal. I have no doubt that Beane and the A's want to contend now (""now"" being 2016 and beyond), and compensatory draft picks for Zobrist and Kazmir aren't going to offer any help in the immediate future. Instead, the A's can trade these players for MLB-ready guys and field a strong team next season and beyond. For the Athletics, a team that's limited by its budget, there's nothing so valuable as cheap, controllable talent."
OaklandAthletics,3d4nsl,slinkey1998,0,Mon Jul 13 17:22:56 2015 UTC,I'd add Chavez in that group too if any team might be asking for him.  Reddick will likely be next year but I could see a move this year because of him being vocal about the Front Office.  But I think those 3 are gone at or near the deadline no matter what. Kazmir could be kept because the return might not be worth it & then we could just extend a qualifying offer to ensure some compensation.
OaklandAthletics,3d4nsl,Tario70,5,Mon Jul 13 17:48:54 2015 UTC,"Reddick will likely be next year but I could see a move this year because of him being vocal about the Front Office.   I think Reddick either goes at this year's deadline or stays till FA. It's not going to be worth it to trade Reddick in an offseason OF FA market that has Jason Heyward, Denard Span, Colby Rasmus, and Justin Upton in it, among others.   He's 1.5 years away from FA. Since the change of free agency (qualifying offers vs. Type A/B FA), the value of players being traded with 1.5 years left on their contract (the trade deadline before their walk year, instead of in their walk year) has inflated massively relative to guys being traded in their walk year because a contender gets him for 2 playoff pushes vs. 1 (or, one playoff push + the ability to trade the guy in the offseason), and you can no longer offer draft compensation to a guy you trade for in his walk year.   If the A's are thinking about trading Reddick, now's the best time to do it.   I'd also say the same thing about Chavez. On the flip side though, if there's one thing to draw from how heavily the A's are underperforming their pythag, its that it won't take a lot to make this team contenders in 2016."
OaklandAthletics,3d4nsl,tdov,3,Mon Jul 13 18:02:22 2015 UTC,"I think Beane, for the sake of contending next season, keeps Reddick and Chavez. (I suppose there's a chance that Chavez is dealt, but - given the A's utter lack of young, quality outfielders - I don't think Reddick gets traded quite yet.) The problem with extending a qualifying offer to Kazmir is that the compensatory pick offers the A's no immediate value, which I think Beane cherishes more than anything else."
OaklandAthletics,3d4nsl,slinkey1998,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:56:57 2015 UTC,"True on the comp pick, but the return may be similar smaller if teams freak out about his last start. I know I read initially that Beane wanted to keep Kaz if the season had played out differently.  Reddick will probably survive this year, though I think Chavez is a complete tossup. Next year though, Reddick will undoubtedly be on the block at some point."

OaklandAthletics,3d4nsl,quickly_,3,Mon Jul 13 19:07:08 2015 UTC,"Semien most definitely can hit. He is doing so at almost exactly a league average rate. For a shortstop, that is plenty good enough.   He just needs to work on his fielding, which he's doing with wash."
OaklandAthletics,3d4nsl,manusvelox,0,Mon Jul 13 21:14:35 2015 UTC,What are you basing that off of?   He has a 95 wrc+
OaklandAthletics,3d4nsl,quickly_,3,Mon Jul 13 21:30:16 2015 UTC,Last I looked it was 96 and that's close enough to average in my book
OaklandAthletics,3d4nsl,manusvelox,2,Mon Jul 13 21:38:53 2015 UTC,Also he still has less than a full season in the majors. His bat is still developing
OaklandAthletics,3d4nsl,manusvelox,-1,Mon Jul 13 21:41:50 2015 UTC,"the problem with Semien is that he isnt a shortstop...  -6.4 UZR @ SS.  below average hitter, poor fielder. yes he is young, but that doesnt mean we shouldnt look for someone better."

OaklandAthletics,3d5fly,Dick_Knubbler666,2,Mon Jul 13 21:20:28 2015 UTC,"I've been bringing my kids the last couple seasons.  Here's a few things I've learned:  1)  Sitting on the 3rd base side will put the sun behind you.  2)  Sit at the end of the aisle so that it is easy to get up and go to the bathroom/get food.  You'll have to do that often with kids.  (Bonus tip:  If you do sit on the end of the aisle, sit on the side of the section furthest from home plate.  This way you don't have people constantly blocking your view as the walk up and down the aisle.)  3)  Visit the kids play area on the second deck behind home plate.  There's plenty to keep the kids busy if the can't sit still.  Could be perfect for the 3 year old.  There's TVs in the area so you can continue to watch the game.  4)  Since you're going with a larger group, you may want to consider having the grandparents sit in front of you instead of everyone sitting in one row.  This keeps you closer together so you can carry on conversations without having to yell across the row and, more importantly, if the kids are kicking the seats in front of you, it'll only bother people in your party versus strangers."

OaklandAthletics,3d1k1j,Way_She_Goes,9,Sun Jul 12 19:46:18 2015 UTC,"Sonny was dominant today. Great way to head into the All Star break, even if he won't be pitching in the game itself."
OaklandAthletics,3d1k1j,Worthyness,8,Sun Jul 12 19:40:37 2015 UTC,A's All Stars dominate
OaklandAthletics,3d1k1j,bherdt,5,Sun Jul 12 19:45:07 2015 UTC,Gray-test of all time.
OaklandAthletics,3d37o1,the_wolverine88,2,Mon Jul 13 04:03:43 2015 UTC,"Ill take Gray over Donaldson. Because I think Lawrie and Graveman are going to get better. And then there is Baretto of course.  But really, without knowing what we might have received for Gray, it is hard to make an objective choice..."
OaklandAthletics,3d37o1,Jonnymaxed,3,Mon Jul 13 04:56:18 2015 UTC,"I would keep Sonny, but when I check on Donaldson's numbers every so often I weep quietly to myself."
OaklandAthletics,3d37o1,hamster4sale,3,Mon Jul 13 10:57:54 2015 UTC,"I'd rather see Donaldson go, honestly.  While he was and is an MVP candidate, he is also peaking. Sonny is a young talent, who is still getting better.  Additionally, having Donaldson this year would not have made much of a difference to where we are, but having Sonny is one of the reasons we're hanging on."

OaklandAthletics,3d0j6e,JackCustComeback,3,Sun Jul 12 19:36:16 2015 UTC,This is the kind of performance I've come to expect from Sonny. I ain't even surprised.
OaklandAthletics,3d0j6e,MrSaladFork,7,Sun Jul 12 19:35:27 2015 UTC,"An audible ""I believe"" chant at an away game? Nice."

OaklandAthletics,3cxvyh,harriswill,2,Sat Jul 11 23:58:43 2015 UTC,There's a much higher chance the Butler grounds into a double play then a runner being thrown out trying to steal. Every time anyone with any kind of speed is on first with Butler up and less than two outd the runner needs to being moving asap.

Oakland Relief Pitching is 3rd-worst in the majors with -0.3 WAR ahead of only the Rangers and the Tigers.  A's relievers have the 3rd-highest ERA (behind the Rockies and Braves) and 5th-highest FIP (Rangers, Sox, Rays, Tigers) in the majors.

OaklandAthletics,3cu1i2,DieHardRaider,7,Sat Jul 11 03:02:02 2015 UTC,He got traded because we went all in for the world series.
OaklandAthletics,3cu1i2,crow38,-2,Sat Jul 11 03:40:46 2015 UTC,yes and no there was multiple reports about him after he got traded saying the front office didnt like how he carried him self on the field and didnt like he was making it to dramatic when it didnt need to be. the simple errors because he was to fancy.
OaklandAthletics,3cu1i2,TheWheats56,3,Sat Jul 11 03:43:25 2015 UTC,Link? Source?
OaklandAthletics,3cu1i2,DieHardRaider,4,Sat Jul 11 07:46:27 2015 UTC,He pulled it out of his ass. He doesn't have one
OaklandAthletics,3cu1i2,crow38,-2,Sat Jul 11 13:29:16 2015 UTC,im not going to remember the article from a year ago. this was released as soon as he got traded. it also stated if he didnt get traded when he did he would of been traded in the offseason. so it was the end of the road for him in oakland

They thought he was overrated but he never had any character issues while he was here and the A's coaches loved him. Writers were just confused why he was traded and tried to insinuate it had something to do with him refusing to play CF and then asking Reddick to play CF for him. Melvin came straight out and said it wasn't the preferred method of dealing with that situation (should have come to the coaches first) but it wasn't a big deal and had nothing to do with why he got traded. The newspapers did the same thing with Donaldson when he got traded. Tried to make it about JD's Twitter comments and the ""Billy Boy"" remark. Just people trying to stir up controversy."

OaklandAthletics,3cu4p4,Johnb628,2,Sat Jul 11 00:53:44 2015 UTC,"Hmm. Features usually take place within a smaller amount of time, at least that's the general rule. Television series are a few years. Novels are a whole nother game all together. I'd just say keep writing. For me, I just start during my first draft and just go until I'm done. Then I go back and restructure. Got a 100 pages on this western and I've done 3 other scripts as well. Nothing huge but as long as you're putting out pages, you're at least getting somewhere."

OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,nickm_,16,Thu Jul 9 20:57:49 2015 UTC,"This is the part I found impressive   Baseball Info Solutions has Semien with +1 Defensive Run Saved. In other words, a league-average shortstop, even with all the errors. That's the same rating that Asdrubal Cabrera has, who has made just two errors."
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,dedros,9,Thu Jul 9 22:20:45 2015 UTC,thank god everyone else has sucked too!  iirc there was an sbnation fanpost about this a couple months ago.
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,Barry_McKackiner,2,Thu Jul 9 21:42:26 2015 UTC,"Lawrie has taken a bit of the error spotlight too, making some critical errors. still less than half as many as Marcus and he's at the hot corner."
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,AttemptedWit,6,Fri Jul 10 00:23:33 2015 UTC,"Lawrie has been ranging too far out of position at times. I'm ok with it if he does it correctly and takes the angle towards the pitcher, but his moving laterally stepping in front of semien in the ss position isn't helping semien mentally. And it's semiens confidence that is causing the majority of the errors."
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,Barry_McKackiner,15,Fri Jul 10 01:59:20 2015 UTC,"A lot of his fuck ups have been bailed out by good pitching and timely double plays.   Regardless of direct impact via unearned runs or final outcomes of the games, the errors put extra stress on the pitching staff that is unquantifiable. That stress can impact performance, confidence and the general momentum of a game - and the season in the long run."
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,untouchable765,7,Thu Jul 9 22:25:51 2015 UTC,Thank you. People don't seem to realize how 28 errors can hurt a team even if it just turned their 5-2 loss into a 7-2 one.
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,Bgro,9,Thu Jul 9 22:34:42 2015 UTC,"At the same time, people overrate errors and ignore range. Lots of people thought Derek Jeter was a great defensive SS well into his final years because he was always so sure handed. But a closer look showed he had no range to his left whatsoever and was actually one of the worst SS defensively.   Thing is, you can't really teach mobility or lateral speed. You can teach footwork and glovework though. Semien's problems seem like the kind of thing that can be corrected."
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,AttemptedWit,4,Thu Jul 9 23:55:44 2015 UTC,I 100% agree with this.  His bad throws are him over thinking and worrying.  The glove issues are just bumps in the road.
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,untouchable765,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:44:27 2015 UTC,Semien has had pretty damn average range all season so I'm not sure who you're referring to.
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,Bgro,5,Fri Jul 10 00:13:31 2015 UTC,I wasn't referring to anyone (well I guess Jeter). My comment was about how errors are only part of the equation but people overstate their significance.
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,untouchable765,0,Fri Jul 10 00:36:13 2015 UTC,Yes I get that and if Semien were making these amazing plays I would agree with you. Instead he struggles with making some pretty routine grounders.
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,surfingyt,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:43:46 2015 UTC,This. Errors are a rally/momentum killer and affects the team in other ways besides strictly runs.
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,untouchable765,2,Thu Jul 9 22:42:02 2015 UTC,He makes a lot of errors in games we're already down in so that makes them less serious? Either way he shouldn't have 28 errors before the god damn all star break. He's also batting .258 so its not as if his offense is nullifying his ability to not throw the ball into a glove.
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,WordSalad11,11,Thu Jul 9 22:05:32 2015 UTC,He's also batting .258 so its not as if his offense is nullifying his ability to not throw the ball into a glove.   Can we stop using batting average to measure offense please? He's 7th out of 23 qualified SS in wOBA. He's 24. He's amoung the best hitting SS in the game and he's 24.
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,untouchable765,2,Thu Jul 9 22:13:23 2015 UTC,7th of 23 and 28 errors. Don't pretend like he's above average.
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,WordSalad11,6,Thu Jul 9 22:33:20 2015 UTC,"He's about average overall. And he has 4-6 years until he peaks.  Edit: Not to mention his range has been above average this year. He needs to stop making errors, but he has the potential to be an elite SS if he can improve on the errors front. He's 24. Tejada made 26 errors in his first half season with the team as a 24 year old, and then made >20 errors a year for the next 3 years."
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,surfingyt,6,Thu Jul 9 22:34:53 2015 UTC,And he has 4-6 years until he peaks.   How can you be so sure he will peak? You don't see that perhaps he is just a really bad short stop at the MLB level and this is out of his capability?
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,WordSalad11,7,Thu Jul 9 22:44:55 2015 UTC,"That's possible. We won't know until we play him for a year and give him a chance to improve though. At this point he's an overall average player on a team that isn't going anywhere, errors or no errors, so I don't see the point in complaining about his playing time."
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,AttemptedWit,6,Thu Jul 9 22:50:28 2015 UTC,"I'm sure he will peak.  This is his FIRST YEAR playing shortstop.  He is learning a new position on the fly and errors are a part of making a transition. Semien has been serviceable in his first season.  If you want to comment on his range and how he doesn't have any, you need to compare him to our previous SS Lowrie had 0 range.  Semien will be fine.  People commenting on his play based on errors alone without taking the whole situation into account is just stupid.  What you all are doing with Semien is the same thing I am doing right now, I'm looking at individual's comments in this thread and judging each of you based on what you say here and no where else.  And by that, most of you are a bunch of dumbasses."
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,dedros,2,Fri Jul 10 01:50:22 2015 UTC,"going off up/downvotes alone, it seems like most people in this sub like semein playing SS going forward. my question to the people that want to play it out is this: what would he have to do to make it so you would think he's not cut out to play SS in the bigs? is there literally nothing? if he only has 10 more errors for the rest of the season he'll still have more than anyone in either league in the last 23 years. if he has another 25..."
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,dedros,2,Fri Jul 10 19:26:03 2015 UTC,"to put it in perspective: donaldson had the most errors in the AL last year and he had 5 less than semein does currently . and i agree, his bat forgave that stat. just at what point does it not become worth it?"
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,WordSalad11,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:29:22 2015 UTC,"what would he have to do to make it so you would think he's not cut out to play SS in the bigs?   If he has this many errors at the ASB next year, he needs a new position. We can't sustain a -20 UZR/150 in the long run. In fact, if we were contending, I would want him in AAA now. But we're not contending, so why are we whining about allowing a player to develop?"
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,dedros,3,Fri Jul 10 20:06:27 2015 UTC,"right on. i like that answer.   I think some people, like myself, are ""whining"" because we don't see the 'development' in his 'development', y'know? it's more like just sustaining. and I realize that he can't develop without being on the field, and I also recognize that it's the perfect time for him to get those reps in on a season that's most likely done.  His ineptitude at the position is just easy to point at and cringe, he might have the most errors committed in 60+ years by the end of the season and I'm sure fangraphs has a way to justify him being in the lineup, my eyes tell me otherwise.    But you're absolutely right."
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,WordSalad11,2,Fri Jul 10 20:30:38 2015 UTC,"In all things, humans give undue weight to exceptional events. Errors disproportionately influence our judgement of events because they are so visible. Empirically, a throwing error that results in an extra runner on first isn't any worse than a slow guy who can't get to a grounder. It's just a matter of data vs. observation. I will always go with the data, because as a species we frankly suck at the latter. That doesn't mean I'm not yelling at my TV and face-palming when they happen, though."
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,surfingyt,0,Sat Jul 11 16:18:47 2015 UTC,But we're not contending   Not with him at SS. There is this whole wild card thing that is still attainable.
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,surfingyt,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:53:48 2015 UTC,"Thats a great question because I feel there is no error count where the fanboys would give up on him.   And if there actually is an error count for them, how can they not understand that some people have reached that error count sooner?"
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,AttemptedWit,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:39:56 2015 UTC,"Honestly, for me, nothing.  He was brought in to be a shortstop.  Management knew he may have issues defensively, but were willing to take the risk.  His offensive ability is a huge plus compared to everything else were currently have in house for shortstop.    Whether he has 10 errors or 30 in the second half, he is still the teams SS.  Considering half his errors are throwing errors, I have confidence in the kid.  His throwing errors are mental.  Every play he is stressing over making the throw. If his previous throw was high, he tries to adjust and throws it in the dirt, and vice versa.    Here is how Semien is stacking up vs the other shortstops:    MLB:  1st in Games Played (86) 4th in Putouts (126) 1st in Errors (28) 3rd in DPs Turned (56)    AL:    1st in Games Played (86) 3rd in Putouts (126) 5th in Assists (211) 1st in Errors (28) 1st in DPs Turned (56)    So while Semien is having a lot of problems with errors, he is showing potential as shortstop.  Throwing errors like his take a lot of reps to get right.  Once he gets enough good reps in, his confidence will get right and his throwing errors will drop.  As for his fielding errors, it's the same thing, he needs reps. Also, once he learns what his effective range, his errors will begin to slow up.   All that being said, with hard work both by Semien and the coaches, Semien could be a top 5 shortstop within the next 2 years.  He has 20/80 offensive potential with speed and is showing defensive promise at short in between errors.      This is why I believe in the kid.  He is a project, but if things fall into place, we could be set at a weak position for many years."
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,surfingyt,2,Fri Jul 10 20:57:35 2015 UTC,"What exactly is the ""whole situation"" some are not taking into account? He can't play MLB shortstop right now. Is there another task he is exceptionally good at? Is there a master plan that involves him we are not aware of?  I appreciate your devotion to him and I don't like giving up on a player either but if this was a pitcher, catcher or anyone else there would be no love loss on his departure.  EDIT: Departure meaning from SS. He can play, just not SS at this moment."
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,WordSalad11,5,Fri Jul 10 05:42:03 2015 UTC,"He can't play MLB shortstop right now.    Right now, he is an overall average MLB shortstop. The errors are infuriating, but the actual impact on winning and losing is not much different from any other failure to generate an out on a play.  Generally I would be upset about the departure of any player who was about average at his position at 24 years old."
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,untouchable765,3,Fri Jul 10 15:42:01 2015 UTC,A's won't have him in 4-6 years.
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,WordSalad11,4,Thu Jul 9 22:36:14 2015 UTC,"He's not a free agent until 2021, so actually yes, yes we will if we want to."
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,untouchable765,-4,Thu Jul 9 22:39:33 2015 UTC,You realize our longest tenured player is Crisp and he's only been on the A's for 5 years. Just because he isn't a free agent for 6 years does in no way mean the A's will have him in 6 years. Do you even follow this team and how they work?
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,WordSalad11,4,Thu Jul 9 22:42:04 2015 UTC,"if we want to   ...  Edit: Reddick in his 5th season with the team next year, Coco in his 6th year, we kept Suzuki for 5 1/2 years. It's not like every player gets traded immediately."
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,untouchable765,-1,Thu Jul 9 22:43:58 2015 UTC,"It's not really that simple with the A's.    Reddick in his 5th season with the team next year, Coco in his 6th year, we kept Suzuki for 5 1/2 years. It's not like every player gets traded immediately.    Just most except for the 3 you named? The point still stands that the longest tenured player has only been on the team for 5 years."
OaklandAthletics,3cpydo,WordSalad11,0,Thu Jul 9 22:45:51 2015 UTC,"It's almost as if players who the A's want to keep can be kept on the team for 5 years, which can also be expressed as a range of 4-6 years."

OaklandAthletics,3cqugb,Ethanhekker,4,Fri Jul 10 02:50:21 2015 UTC,Maybe he's a Sounds fan and he's going to miss Zito playing in Nashville.
OaklandAthletics,3cqugb,BBQTerrace,6,Fri Jul 10 02:44:43 2015 UTC,"we are truly in the darkest timeline :c  Losing Hahn, to be, should be a nail in the coffin. Yes, he can be replaced by bassist, but that's a huge cut in our rotation. at the rate this team is going, I'm more than ok with a temp fire sale and retool for next season with a chance at the wild card."
OaklandAthletics,3cqugb,Worthyness,10,Fri Jul 10 03:06:55 2015 UTC,Hahn is clearly rhythm guitar. A bassist wouldn't be a good replacement.
OaklandAthletics,3cqugb,k0an,2,Fri Jul 10 14:28:45 2015 UTC,"There was an interesting article on athleticsnation a few months ago comparing the rebuilding done by the Astros and by the A's. The Astros had spent many years at the bottom of the division, lingering around, getting players one by one but not generating much success. Meanwhile, the A's managed to stay relevant with constant flips, though having limited postseason success. Now that we find ourselves in opposite positions, it'll be interesting to see how far the Astros can go in the postseason if they make it there."

OaklandAthletics,3coecl,DontSayNoToPills,3,Thu Jul 9 20:09:31 2015 UTC,Semien needs to be moved to second base. He just doesn't have the arm to play SS. At this point in the season it is time to get what we can with our pieces. I can see Billy making some moves soon to restock our farm.
OaklandAthletics,3coecl,cali_daddy,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:55:04 2015 UTC,I mean the moves he made over the off-season essentially restocked SOME of what we lost last season. He saw that Griffin/Parker were fucked and our window was closing indefinitely so he reloaded us with some younger arms and position players.  In hindsight trading for Shark then trading him away hurts the most (losing prospects and getting shit in return).
OaklandAthletics,3coecl,DontSayNoToPills,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:57:42 2015 UTC,Yeah trading away our best SS prospect hurts the most especially when we need a true SS right now.

OaklandAthletics,3coecl,scottfarrar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:02:43 2015 UTC,I mean Semien and Bassitt are essentially just placeholders for other players who could have better WAR. I like Bassitt though.  Like I said. The thing the hurts the most is the INITIAL trade for Shark/Hammel.

OaklandAthletics,3coecl,scottfarrar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:59:37 2015 UTC,"That was more of me just lashing out in anger at Semien and wishing he never existed. Bassitt is developing well, and Phegley adds to that catchers charm we always have."

OaklandAthletics,3coecl,JackCustComeback,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:37:13 2015 UTC,"Can you find the rule? I thought the same thing but all I can find is the opposite. I believe this is the rule in question:   509.F (f) A fair ball touches a runner or an umpire on fair territory before it touches an infielder including the pitcher, or touches an umpire before it has passed an infielder other than the pitcher;  http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/ball_in_play_5.jsp  But that is saying that it is only dead IF it hits the umpire BEFORE going past an infielder."

I see 5.09(f) which is not exactly the situation, but seems to directly contradict what you posted   The ball becomes dead and runners advance one base, or return to their bases, without liability to be put out, when (f) A fair ball touches a runner or an umpire on fair territory before it touches an infielder including the pitcher, or touches an umpire before it has passed an infielder other than the pitcher;"

Besides, less errors at short might make games a little less frustrating to watch, but it doesn't seem like it would make a huge difference... It's not like his errors are the reason they're not in first place right now. I just hope he doesn't get frustrated and it ends up being detrimental to his development somehow."
OaklandAthletics,3cprc5,surfingyt,2,Thu Jul 9 21:02:46 2015 UTC,But his errors have cost us games and its definitely affecting him look at his error today. Leaving him in to finish off the season will only wreck him mentally and statistically.
OaklandAthletics,3cprc5,HumpCatter,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:10:33 2015 UTC,"I think taking him out of the lineup would be a bigger blow to his confidence, which I think is the main problem.

I don't think theyre hurting us as much as you much."
OaklandAthletics,3cprc5,surfingyt,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:29:49 2015 UTC,"The article youre talking about is this? So not directly affecting the game's outcome perhaps but it has to kill momentum and get the players going ""here we go again"" like the rest of us."
OaklandAthletics,3cprc5,WordSalad11,3,Thu Jul 9 21:58:18 2015 UTC,"His range appears to be above average, so if he can get his errors under control he has the potential to be a very, very good SS.

OaklandAthletics,3cprc5,DontSayNoToPills,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:07:35 2015 UTC,I think we have to grin and bear through Semien until the off-season. We've got a few years until Barreto is even ready for spring-training.

OaklandAthletics,3cprc5,Bgro,4,Thu Jul 9 20:18:40 2015 UTC,"I never understand why people delete their comments.  Edit: To answer your question though,  it may be cool but I don't think it would be wise to give up on Semien. Its easy to see he's not the best SS out there but what exactly are our alternatives? Sogard is not great defensively at SS either (weak arm) and he's not a good hitter. I think Semien can improve but it will take more time abd perhaps a whole off-season of working with Wash. If he can just be average defensively (which given his athleticism is not out of the question) he's one of the best SS in the league."
OaklandAthletics,3cprc5,dedros,3,Thu Jul 9 20:46:05 2015 UTC,"i'm pretty sure he's actually the worst SS. if we take out his bat, what stat ranks him even mediocre? (honestly)"
OaklandAthletics,3cprc5,Bgro,2,Thu Jul 9 21:26:57 2015 UTC,His offense is what makes him a good SS. You can't take that out.
OaklandAthletics,3cprc5,dedros,3,Thu Jul 9 21:28:45 2015 UTC,"I feel like you can take that out, because he'd be just as good of a bat if he was 3b or 2b, no?"
OaklandAthletics,3cprc5,dedros,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:31:35 2015 UTC,i actually would like to see lawrie and semien switch positions just for shits and gigs.
OaklandAthletics,3cprc5,Bgro,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:33:06 2015 UTC,No the positional adjustment is greater for SS than it is for 2B/3B. There are very few SS (or there were before Correa/Russell/Lindor) who can hit like Semien can. I also think his offense has taken a huge hit since he's been focusing so much on his defense. Id like to improve at SS and move Semien to 2B but right now he's our best bet (IMO).
OaklandAthletics,3cprc5,dedros,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:43:59 2015 UTC,"right now sure, but i think with ladendorf coming back soonish and the yields from the impending seller's mode. i think the a's can find a true SS that would allow semien to move back to 2b."
OaklandAthletics,3cprc5,Bgro,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:02:48 2015 UTC,I hope so.
OaklandAthletics,3cprc5,DontSayNoToPills,2,Thu Jul 9 22:28:45 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say cool... but it is acceptable to REALLY dislike him  His 2-run homer yesterday almost makes me more mad at him... It's like he was this guy

OaklandAthletics,3cmn20,Bgro,2,Thu Jul 9 02:54:34 2015 UTC,If anything he upped his value. As soon as he left the game went south.
OaklandAthletics,3cmn20,surfingyt,4,Thu Jul 9 03:10:55 2015 UTC,He upped his value to our team maybe but I think anyone looking to acquire pitching for a playoff run is a bit more wary of Kazmir now. It will be difficult to get good value for him now.

OaklandAthletics,3cmn20,fuckyourcatsnigga,5,Thu Jul 9 02:25:25 2015 UTC,Also easy for the other team to hit homers(give up) too...double edged sword.
OaklandAthletics,3cmn20,Chris_Parker,2,Thu Jul 9 03:14:13 2015 UTC,"Nah man, don't you know they move the walls back five feet for the away teams? That's why they built a new stadium in the first place."
OaklandAthletics,3cmn20,fsites,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:27:26 2015 UTC,"True but the Yankees front office has publicly said they draft and build a team based on the short porch in right. Not sure how many extra wins it has added up to but it does add a long term advantage. The a's can and have used pitchers that pitch to contact to gain advantage with half their games being played at o.co  I'm all for teams using their ballpark for competitive advantage, it's a fun part of the game and adds to the uniqueness of baseball."
OaklandAthletics,3clk4t,thesearereddits,11,Wed Jul 8 21:14:28 2015 UTC,My take on this article is it is simply a jab at Padres' fans.
OaklandAthletics,3clk4t,surfingyt,6,Wed Jul 8 21:15:09 2015 UTC,So its just us and /r/MinnesotaTwins  I knew it!

OaklandAthletics,3clk4t,theineffablebob,9,Thu Jul 9 01:18:45 2015 UTC,Ohhh. Coincidentally those are the only two teams I do watch because I'm an A's fan who currently lives in Minnesota lol

OaklandAthletics,3cjxpa,surfingyt,9,Wed Jul 8 15:51:16 2015 UTC,Glad someone recorded it. The original was not on YouTube and you would think the A's would put it up there.

OaklandAthletics,3cjxpa,greatestsignmaker,2,Wed Jul 8 15:27:23 2015 UTC,I reached out to the A's about this as I was curious myself & I personally love this intro video. You're totally right. They're licensed to use the music only within the Coliseum.

OaklandAthletics,3cjxpa,NightWriter500,3,Wed Jul 8 15:59:52 2015 UTC,Sounds like something from Two Steps From Hell haha
OaklandAthletics,3cjxpa,scottfarrar,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:40:15 2015 UTC,"Wow, I'd never listed to Two Steps From Hell, but I just skimmed the ""Top 30 songs"" and it really does.  Couldn't find it exactly, but found some other stuff that might work (as well as at least one song that sounds exactly like the Pirates of the Caribbean theme song).  I was originally thinking this song came from the Moneyball soundtrack, but couldn't find it there either."
OaklandAthletics,3cjxpa,TheWheats56,3,Wed Jul 8 22:44:01 2015 UTC,"My only complaint is that Hatte is the only glimpse of the 2000-2003 years.  Where's Hudson/Mulder/Zito? or Giambi? Tejada?  I know the win streak is a dominant point, but in many ways the 2001 team was even more insane in the 2nd half.  Throw in Giambi's walkoff vs. Stanton, a Zito curve, Huddy sinker, and Mulder smooth delivery... and Tejada's game 18 or 19 walkoff.  I'm getting chills right now haha"
OaklandAthletics,3cjxpa,Oakroscoe,2,Wed Jul 8 17:30:14 2015 UTC,"I think people remember the 20 game win streak more than anything else. Especially because of Moneyball (where Zito, Mulder and Hudson are barely even mentioned)."
OaklandAthletics,3cjxpa,Sfer,2,Wed Jul 8 19:40:52 2015 UTC,That walk off against Stanton was awesome.  I still remember exactly where I was listening to that on the radio.

OaklandAthletics,3ck4ge,beneficialdefect,7,Wed Jul 8 16:38:13 2015 UTC,"He seemed kinda shy to be honest. He also wasn't able to name all of the all stars from the A's the last 2 years. He was probably just really nervous though. They were showering him with compliments, and he seemed very humble about his success."
OaklandAthletics,3ck4ge,Worthyness,3,Wed Jul 8 16:46:59 2015 UTC,Given his early success I'm hopeful he'll have plenty more opportunities to open up a bit. Gotta love the humble stars out there.
OaklandAthletics,3ck4ge,Worthyness,2,Wed Jul 8 17:41:39 2015 UTC,Impoasible! We've had literally 1 representative for an entire decade.how could he not name them all?
OaklandAthletics,3ck4ge,MLBVideoConverterBot,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:12:05 2015 UTC,"Just finished watching the segment he's a pretty quiet dude But when you have someone like Eric Byrnes talking, you kinda just let the guys do the talking. Granted I'd be nervous as shit too if I got to be on a TV show and get talked about for being in consideration for Rookie of the year.   I do love knowing that he's been talking to Rickey (or rather Rickey has been talking to him). Great thing about Billy is that he's extremely coachable- he picks up on things quickly and makes adjustments and can take in new information extremely quickly (who the hell takes 1 season to learn how to switch hit?). Just hope that Rickey advice on confidence to steal sinks in a bit sooner. Dude can steal bags and should be doing it more often. The fact that he gets on base extremely consistently and he has the same speed as Billy Hamilton should mean he could have at least as many bags as Hamilton, if not more."
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,AthleticsBot,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:05:05 2015 UTC,As bad as the bullpen was tonight look at phegleys location was for the first home run... Stunner hit he target .  and the last one to Drew call was idiotic. Abad left it up but drew would have never put that swing on a fast ball.

OaklandAthletics,3cla49,LibertarianSocialism,3,Thu Jul 9 01:38:51 2015 UTC,O'Flaherty just pitched and Rodriquez was up yesterday too lol.
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,ElectricityMule,2,Thu Jul 9 01:39:47 2015 UTC,So pretty much just Rodriguez unless Abad's back is feeling better.
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,Sfer,3,Thu Jul 9 01:42:21 2015 UTC,Do we still have Leon?  edit- Abad. We have Abad.

OaklandAthletics,3cla49,Bgro,5,Thu Jul 9 01:34:29 2015 UTC,I'm enjoying this conversation with Matt Vasgersian.
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,solostman,3,Thu Jul 9 01:32:26 2015 UTC,Absolutely fantastic. I love that mlb at bat kept it going through commercials.
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:34:23 2015 UTC,I'm checking 95.7 occasionally to see if he gets on with Vince when he drops off his gift.
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,Jonnymaxed,6,Thu Jul 9 01:46:10 2015 UTC,CSN did too. I'm surprised too
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,MrSaladFork,3,Thu Jul 9 01:35:16 2015 UTC,matt vasgersian says some stupid stuff as a tv guy but he seems like an awesome guy to just watch a game with
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,Drumitar,2,Thu Jul 9 01:30:14 2015 UTC,Isn't that what people say about Hawk Harrelson?
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,Bgro,2,Thu Jul 9 01:32:22 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm loving this!
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,Worthyness,3,Thu Jul 9 01:31:47 2015 UTC,And the Yankees announcers are talking about Gardner replacing Gordon in the voting already.
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,Bgro,3,Thu Jul 9 01:28:22 2015 UTC,This season has been so much about shoddy bullpen and defense. But I swear we also seem to get a hugely disproportionate amount of plain bad breaks..
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,unbuttoned,4,Thu Jul 9 01:27:47 2015 UTC,Booze is my bullpen antidote.
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,Drumitar,5,Thu Jul 9 01:25:47 2015 UTC,"Man we used to work a lot of walks, make  the pitcher work, don't see that approach any more , the team has to chill the fuck out."
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,unbuttoned,3,Thu Jul 9 01:23:52 2015 UTC,Bring back Daric Barton!  The A's are actually 2nd in O-Swing% (The percentage of pitches a batter swings at outside the strike zone) so their plate discipline is actually pretty good this year.
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,Drumitar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:28:40 2015 UTC,nah. dude was hitting sub .200 in AAA. I'm good. We have six-eight nate for sub-.200 first baseman who can't hit homeruns.
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,RussianNarwhals,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:00:25 2015 UTC,Was a joke.

OaklandAthletics,3cla49,Drumitar,2,Thu Jul 9 01:25:16 2015 UTC,Strike Davis can do it.
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,ElectricityMule,3,Thu Jul 9 01:27:46 2015 UTC,"Sadly, I think there are A's fans who actually believe that."

OaklandAthletics,3cla49,Bgro,2,Thu Jul 9 01:16:07 2015 UTC,The Yankees announcers crack me up.
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,GaryTheJerk,6,Thu Jul 9 01:13:23 2015 UTC,Scribner headed straight to Nashville... not even stopping in the dugout
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,Bgro,3,Thu Jul 9 01:11:32 2015 UTC,"Better be , he can tAke his 86 mph ""cutter"" with him"
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,surfingyt,2,Thu Jul 9 01:13:19 2015 UTC,"He's out of options, so he's getting DFA'd.  DOES THIS MEAN ZITO CAN COME ONTO THE 40-MAN?!"
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,GaryTheJerk,2,Thu Jul 9 01:12:31 2015 UTC,Zito will only be called up as a starter.
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,2,Thu Jul 9 01:15:17 2015 UTC,"Sure, for the 25-man. But if Kaz gets traded, then he's already there, ready to be called up."
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,GaryTheJerk,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:18:06 2015 UTC,I think I'd rather give those innings to Bassitt or Nolin.
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,Drumitar,4,Thu Jul 9 01:48:48 2015 UTC,How long until Scribner is DFAed?  Any pitcher in Nashville has to be a better option at this point.
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,Bloody_Khan_Man,4,Thu Jul 9 01:09:37 2015 UTC,"I think there's little chance. He's out of options so he can't be sent down without DFAing him and, like it or not, he's still one of the best relievers we have in our bullpen. If we could afford losing him entirely, they'd take the chance but Beane's philosophy has always been patience with struggling players."
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,boomsticking,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:13:25 2015 UTC,"Ugh... I thought he still had options. That sucks.  I think he overachieved in the past but can be better than what we've seen lately... I don't see him working out his problems in the majors, though. Seems like he's just getting more and more frustrated (as we all are.)"
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,Sfer,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:20:38 2015 UTC,"I think he's been overused because the rest of the bullpen has sucked. He's pitched 45 innings so far this year, which, after tonight, should put him in the top 5 IP for relievers."
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,DieHardRaider,2,Thu Jul 9 01:23:07 2015 UTC,Davis could do better
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,Max_Xevious,2,Thu Jul 9 01:13:09 2015 UTC,My friend and I have actually been saying that since he came back from the DL! lol
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,ndevito1,5,Thu Jul 9 01:14:06 2015 UTC,I want the amphibious Venditte back.
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,Bgro,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:10:38 2015 UTC,Me too... But he's only playing long toss and won't even throw off a mound until the All-Star break. I'd be surprised if he was back before August.
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,surfingyt,3,Thu Jul 9 01:16:19 2015 UTC,Sounds about right to me
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,ndevito1,7,Thu Jul 9 01:12:25 2015 UTC,DFA Scribbles
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,7,Thu Jul 9 01:09:21 2015 UTC,"Bye, Scribner."
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,ndevito1,7,Thu Jul 9 01:07:49 2015 UTC,HAHAHHAHAHHAAHHAHH SERIOUSLY?! He's gone after tonight.
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,Drumitar,8,Thu Jul 9 01:07:47 2015 UTC,Fuck you Yankee Stadium.
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,7,Thu Jul 9 01:07:36 2015 UTC,Oh scribbner...
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,Bumbleinthejungle,5,Thu Jul 9 01:07:02 2015 UTC,"Hey guys, quick question? Is Scribner really equipped to toss this much? He's usually a 1 inning guy right? 40 pitches is a ton. Seems problematic?"
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,2,Thu Jul 9 01:06:33 2015 UTC,He normally wouldn't go three innings. He was our best reliever early in the season and Melvin has leaned on him more than a few times to go two innings. Surprised to see him out there for a third inning.
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,Sfer,8,Thu Jul 9 01:09:03 2015 UTC,Scribner himself is problematic.
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,surfingyt,2,Thu Jul 9 01:07:47 2015 UTC,"I dunno man, he's done a decently admirable job here in a pinch."
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,ADAMBOMBERS,2,Thu Jul 9 01:08:48 2015 UTC,3 earned runs in 2.1 is not exactly great.
OaklandAthletics,3cla49,Johnb628,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:12:59 2015 UTC,Sure but a lot of that was just Tex ownage.

OaklandAthletics,3cla49,JackCustComeback,8,Thu Jul 9 00:24:56 2015 UTC,it's not like it's the fucking 8th inning. melvin brought in the guy who's been pitching like shit lately in the 4th inning because he's been pitching like shit lately. i don't know what else he's supposed to do
OaklandAthletics,3ck5zm,surfingyt,7,Wed Jul 8 15:26:39 2015 UTC,That was some grade-A level sidestepping from her. I know Oakland doesn't want to/can't admit it but I think it's pretty clear that they'll only be able to keep one team at this point. I used to blame Lew Wolff for this mess but Oakland has been a shit show about it.
OaklandAthletics,3ck5zm,boomsticking,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:58:52 2015 UTC,"Right. She didn't answer any of the questions directly. It was more of a rehash of some basic premises that are already known by everyone who pays attention. I have liked her as a Major of Oakland for other reasons, but she lost a lot of points for me last night."
OaklandAthletics,3ck5zm,thesearereddits,5,Wed Jul 8 17:50:00 2015 UTC,She didn't say shit about anything except we will help with infrastructure. When Ray Ratto asked about forcing the A's to Howard Terminal because they have no leverage she just came up with a bullshit we are trying to make the owners happy. Stop with the bullshit and get something done to keep both teams
OaklandAthletics,3ck5zm,DieHardRaider,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:41:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah lotta words again but nothing concrete. She did keep emphasizing infrastructure as a method the city can use as leverage instead of money. She said they are re-zoning the area now to support a stadium (did not mention a team). I am wondering if she means getting transportation from downtown to the site.  I assume the A's don't want to leave their current site primarily because BART makes it easy. She did mention the ""creek"" on the property so maybe a complete redo of the BART station and walkway."
OaklandAthletics,3ck5zm,Fire2box,2,Wed Jul 8 16:05:29 2015 UTC,If she's not going to say anything she might as well shut up and not actually go on the show. How the hell did people vote for her?

OaklandAthletics,3cmami,harriswill,5,Thu Jul 9 01:19:47 2015 UTC,Both- he's hurt and severely damaged his trade value at the worst possible point in the season :c
OaklandAthletics,3cmami,Worthyness,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:56:51 2015 UTC,How was his value hurt? Once he left the Yankees runs came pouring in. For all we know he just had cramping.
OaklandAthletics,3cmami,surfingyt,3,Thu Jul 9 03:12:18 2015 UTC,"The trade deadline is looming. No one wants to buy a pitcher for half a season when he's now ""prone to injury""."
OaklandAthletics,3cmami,Worthyness,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:42:12 2015 UTC,But he has always been prone to injury. And he said he could have kept going so maybe he was not too bad off.
OaklandAthletics,3cmami,surfingyt,5,Thu Jul 9 04:50:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, but in the last 3 years, he hasn't had any crazy injury/freak injury/injury to the pitching arm. So you have a guy who pitches really well, no real injuries in the last couple of seasons, but suddenly he's hurt? Red flag for some people and will probably lower his trade value because it's implied that it could happen again. It's like trying to sell a car with a small scratch that you can't see unless you're really close up- it doesn't hurt the function of the car any and it drives well, but now that you know it has a scratch on it, the overall value for that car is significantly lower."
OaklandAthletics,3cmami,Worthyness,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:24:46 2015 UTC,I believe Kaz is leaving either way. Hopefully its nothing serious and a team will not be spooked by this.
OaklandAthletics,3cmami,surfingyt,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:35:30 2015 UTC,Sounds like Kaz might just think it's a byproduct of dehydration. Those summer nights in New York can be pretty muggy.

OaklandAthletics,3ch9pc,Bgro,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:09:06 2015 UTC,him and some guy named Sandbar pimentel.
OaklandAthletics,3ch9pc,Worthyness,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:41:31 2015 UTC,"Interesting that neither Burns not Venditte made the top 20 list. We've seen the impact that Billy has had so far. He's really been the best all around CF/lead off hitter we've had in a while (yes I realize the impact that Coco has had during his tenure with the A's, but I like Billy more for his arm, speed, and high contact/low K rate)."
OaklandAthletics,3ch9pc,elduderino1234,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:31:24 2015 UTC,Burns became a switch hitter recently and has become a much better hitter as a result. Most people saw him as a 4th OF before that. He's been great so far but I'd still take Coco when he was healthy over Burns. Burns is only average defensively and has zero power. If Burns learned to take better routes than I think he could be as good as Coco. Unfortunately he'll never be the 20 HR threat that Coco was.  Venditte is discussed extensively in the write up. He's 29 years old and has less than stellar stuff so im not surprised he didn't make the list.
OaklandAthletics,3ch9pc,Bgro,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:53:13 2015 UTC,There are only two negatives I can think of for Coco: arm strength and durability. The year he hit 20+ dingers was awesome but he hasn't been able to play a season without a DL stint for us. Coco in 2013 is leagues beyond Burns but I think Burns has the potential to be more consistent (or at least until the league has him figured out!).
OaklandAthletics,3ch9pc,elduderino1234,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:15:10 2015 UTC,"I'm a lot less excited about Burns than most on this sub, but I'll still take him over Coco. Coco's defense last year was statistically a disaster. He's much better off in LF."
OaklandAthletics,3ch9pc,WordSalad11,2,Thu Jul 9 22:19:21 2015 UTC,"Going forward, absolutely. But Burns has a ways to go before he's better than peak Coco."

The Jays are paying him $4,500,000 this year and we'll be paying Lawrie and Graveman a total of approximately $2,600,000.    It's just one metric, but the trade isn't looking terrible considering they're combined WAR values are comparable to Josh Donaldson's and we have two more prospects in the minors that we got from the deal.  Thoughts?"

OaklandAthletics,3ch5d9,harriswill,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:48:12 2015 UTC,"Darn, I was driving most of yesterday so hadn't had chance to check my phone. Will have to try and get the next sale"
OaklandAthletics,3ch5d9,TomK115,2,Wed Jul 8 21:24:30 2015 UTC,"Best seats for atmosphere? RF or LF bleachers. They're usually between $12-16 per tickets, it's GA, and the fans are rowdy as hell (in a good way). Also, they may be in the outfield, but the view is still great.  If you're looking for something closer, you can't go wrong with first deck, second section. Usually about $20-30, and they're great."
OaklandAthletics,3ch5d9,callie06,3,Tue Jul 7 22:51:06 2015 UTC,"I gotta disagree on the view part, It's really hard to see or impossible to see much of the outfield, even from the first row of the RF/LF bleachers. Still the most fun part of the park though!"
OaklandAthletics,3ch5d9,boomsticking,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:21:20 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I think I may do the outfield section for a second game if the first one goes well enough. I haven't been to the Coliseum in forever so something closer will probably be better"
OaklandAthletics,3ch5d9,boomsticking,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:26:43 2015 UTC,"I always recommend Plaza Club. Second deck, right near home plate. 214 is especially nice, you look right down the left field line. Tickets come with $10 extra value which you can use on food at the concession stands or merchandise. Just don't sit in the first two or three rows, the rail can block the view."
OaklandAthletics,3ch5d9,Ron_Jeremy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:31:40 2015 UTC,Plaza level seats offer good views for the price. Keep an eye out for the flash sales that are offered; they usually post them on Facebook. I've gotten a lot of $5 or $10 tickets that way. I will say that the Coliseum overall is a much better deal than most stadiums probably are. I was in the nosebleeds at Petco and standing room only at AT&T Park for the price of field infield at the Coliseum.

Though Jesse friggin deserves the shit out of it for being one of the best starting pitchers in the AL. His last couple of starts have hurt him though.  And part of me really wanted Billy Burns in there too :c His rookie line is crazy."

OaklandAthletics,3cdc8z,Ethanhekker,3,Tue Jul 7 03:36:42 2015 UTC,Of all things the Angels need... Outfielders? Huh...
OaklandAthletics,3cdc8z,EllenPaosBlackChild,6,Tue Jul 7 06:44:18 2015 UTC,Think its fairly obvious they're trying to offload Trout and his huge contract to us ;)
OaklandAthletics,3cdc8z,Sfer,4,Tue Jul 7 15:15:22 2015 UTC,Tin Foil Hat Time... With a new stadium around the corner (5+ years away) A's gotta begin to switch their business model. Thoughts?
OaklandAthletics,3cdc8z,surfingyt,9,Tue Jul 7 04:56:20 2015 UTC,"Nothing is certain on the stadium front.  Remember, Fremont was looking almost certain in 2008.  Also, no need to switch the business model.  The model is that the A's work within their budget and create lasting success by knowing when to turnover.  If the money changes, the system will still work: its just a parameter in the system."
OaklandAthletics,3cdc8z,scottfarrar,1 point,Tue Jul 7 05:11:32 2015 UTC,I guess this is where the Tin Foil sees it differently... A new stadium for the A's becomes more certain as the Raiders take their leave to LA. A new stadium seems a lot more certain now than ever was the Fremont idea.  And once you purchase a new stadium the money ball methods will have to go away.
OaklandAthletics,3cdc8z,surfingyt,9,Tue Jul 7 05:51:59 2015 UTC,"Well one, the Raiders haven't said they're leaving. Kephart's deal (although laughable) was a deal for the Raiders to stay.  That leaked deal might ignite some counter proposals to keep the A's-- but that's where we are: proposals.  But more importantly, ""moneyball"" doesn't necessarily mean ""low-budget"". It means acknowledging your constraints and fielding the best team possible, not just pursuing an unobtainable ideal team.  If the constraints change, like budget, the A's just have more options."
OaklandAthletics,3cdc8z,scottfarrar,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:28:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! Yes they have not said they are leaving but their actions speak to alternate plans. Tomorrow on CSN Bay Area Sports Talk the mayor of Oakland is coming on. This should be interesting!   ""moneyball"" doesn't necessarily mean ""low-budget"". It means acknowledging your constraints   That constraint is primarily a low budget... but my belief is the budget will change once a new stadium and subsequent revenue streams become available."
OaklandAthletics,3cdc8z,surfingyt,2,Tue Jul 7 06:42:54 2015 UTC,The Raiders' actions are expected. They are trying to pressure Oakland into getting them a stadium deal by threatening to leave. Obviously if nothing happens in Oakland they will.
OaklandAthletics,3cdc8z,Musicduude,3,Tue Jul 7 17:14:50 2015 UTC,"Clubs with far more money than Oakland use the ""Money ball"" method. Boston, The Dodgers. It actually the norm."
OaklandAthletics,3cdc8z,emcee_paz,2,Tue Jul 7 09:19:54 2015 UTC,"The Dodgers are the least ""moneyball"" team in baseball. This is a team that pays Carl Crawford $20 million a year."
OaklandAthletics,3cdc8z,GuyBelowMeDoesntLift,3,Tue Jul 7 11:02:01 2015 UTC,It's also a team that just hired Farhan Zaidi who was working at Oakland prior as well as a bunch of other people who are big on analytical methods.

I am mainly referring to the trading of players for value instead of keeping them for team consistency (and paying them)."
OaklandAthletics,3cdc8z,emcee_paz,2,Tue Jul 7 15:28:32 2015 UTC,Yeah if money was not such a constraint they would be more likely to hold on to players for longer instead of having to use their value in the place of money to acquire new talent.

Kurcz, a reliever, throws a mid-90s fastball and an above-average curveball, but struggles to locate both (14.1 BB% in 33 IP this season). He was the PTBNL in the trade that brought Theo Epstein from the Red Sox to the Cubs, and he was traded to the Braves last season for reliever Anthony Varvaro.

OaklandAthletics,3c9g6t,HumpCatter,4,Mon Jul 6 04:01:07 2015 UTC,"Favorite Player: Eric Sogard. He's the platoon second baseman/ shortstop with minimal power and bats around .250 every year but he's pretty fun to watch defensively. He's nothing too special and I think a lot of fans wouldn't mind seeing him go but I look at him like the underdog. I feel he embraces the typical A's player and for some reason I've been drawn to him since I became an A's fan around 2012.  From the last few seasons it's been pretty rough. The team shows a ton of potential and makes almost every game exciting but the wins have been hard to come by. We had a rough stretch at the beginning of the year that we haven't been able to climb out of. We're playing much better now, with some hints of early season play, but it just may be too late.   With what I said above, I like the core of guys that we have. If trades are to be made (almost certainly) it's should bring in more talent for next year and may fill some holes that have been exposed. With being a fan, you must know that this team is a little different than others. We don't have the money as some other teams do, so we live by ""selling high and buying low"". It's a fun and interesting approach but you may see your favorite player get traded quickly. Some fans like it and others hate it. I feel personally that it gives us a chance win every year and like the different approach.   I'm a relatively new fan. I grew up in Alaska and went to college down in Vegas. I found $5 dugout tickets to the then-Blue Jays AAA affiliate and fell in love with the game and the environment. I decided after a bit to find an MLB and began watching random teams. I found the A's and really liked the way they played. They are the small-market underdog with a players that have been written off. They fight until the final out and I look at them like a hard working team. I've never been to a game but refuse to miss a game, whether on TV or radio (though in med school) and the atmosphere just looks amazing. It looks like a place where true fans go to cheer on their team and not be there because it's the place to be and post to Facebook.  I'm sorry if that was a lot. I get a little excited when talking about em. I'm glad you've jumped on board. This may be a tough remainder of the season but just ride it out and you'll be glad you did."
OaklandAthletics,3c9g6t,Ron_Jeremy,4,Mon Jul 6 04:11:09 2015 UTC,"Who's your favorite player and why?   I started watching the A's as a kid. So all time it's got to be Big Mac. Always exciting to see him come to bat.  Ad an adult watching since 2000... Mulder or Tejada. Those early 200ps teams were stacked as fuck.  Current? Coco Crisp. He's a strong contact hitter with a (up until recently) distinctive stance. Plays with heart, and a decent human being.   How is this season compared to previous seasons?  What direction is the team headed? Better, worse?   Can only go up from here. We have a much better team than our record would reflect and our division rivals are stronger than the last couple years. Astros? Where the fuck did they come from?  I think we still have an outside shot at making the playoffs this year as long as our bullpen stops shitting the bed.   Why are you an A's fan?   Mark MacGwire and Jose Canseco. I was 10 years old and living on the central coast in 1988. My school was divided like the bloods and the crips between the A's and the dodgers.  I chose correctly.  forgot about baseball for a while til I finished college. I moved out to the bay area in 2000 after college and my first shitty ass apartment had no cable and got only one station clearly and that was k5 who showed the A's games. Fell back into it and been a fan since."
OaklandAthletics,3c9g6t,cb8100,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:55:39 2015 UTC,Where on the Central Coast were you guys split between the A's and the Dodgers? The Monterey area has always been Giants with very few of us die-hard A's fans.

OaklandAthletics,3c9g6t,NightWriter500,3,Mon Jul 6 15:36:22 2015 UTC,"My new favorite player? Brett Lawrie. He plays the game with loads of intensity and enthusiasm, and is an absolute treat to watch (even when he's just standing around the field).  The team this year is, like others have said, is frustrating. Best starting pitcher ERA in the American League (2nd in MLB), 6th best offense in the league, but the most errors in the MLB, and an atrocious bullpen (which was great last year).  Our record in games decided by one run is 6-21. If we had won 10 of the games we lost, we would be around the .500 mark, and be in Wild Card contention.  The team is gonna be good next year. We have all the pieces right now to be a playoff team, but not all of the cylinders are firing at the same time. If we trade some big pieces before the trade deadline, we can get back some more young pieces and be a true contender next year.  I have been a local A's fan as long as I can remember. My first gift ever was a pair of A's socks when I was a baby. Throughout the years, I've gone to games and followed stories, but really got into it in 2013. Now I'm going to 15, 20 games a year, and try to watch or listen to every game if I can."
OaklandAthletics,3c9g6t,slinkey1998,4,Mon Jul 6 03:59:41 2015 UTC,"Favorite player: Stephen Vogt. Easy. It still gives me the chills thinking that this guy sat around in the minors for years with nobody believing in him, then gets a shot with the A's, turns out to be one of the best catchers in all of baseball, and steps up to the plate with tens of thousands of people chanting ""I believe in Stephen Vogt!""  This season has been beyond unlucky. They're rated as one of the best offensive teams in baseball, but they have an awful record. After losing today, they're likely to get shopped all over to start looking ahead for next year.  Last year the A's were the obvious best team in baseball, but then they completely fell apart at the end. The 2012 A's went on one of the best streaks we've ever seen, won a ton of games in the 9th inning, and made the playoffs on the last day of the season. We lost to the Tigers in the playoffs two years in a row. Last year we lost to the Royals. I fucking hate the Royals. I hate their team and especially their fans... but most everyone is on that page.  I started with the A's as a kid and grew up with the Bash Brothers.  Go see a game in person, it's a completely different thing. Sit in the bleachers."
OaklandAthletics,3c9g6t,letsgooakland89,3,Mon Jul 6 03:45:41 2015 UTC,"Little hard for me to go see a game lol. I live out east, but I'll try to catch them when they play the Braves some time And thanks!"
OaklandAthletics,3c9g6t,hamster4sale,2,Mon Jul 6 03:52:28 2015 UTC,"Who's your favorite player and why?    I don't usually have favorites, but I used to love Eric Chavez and Ryan Sweeney.    How is this season compared to previous seasons?   Well, the A's have made the playoffs in each of the past three seasons, and this season they have the worst record in the American League. Billy Beane, notorious for dismantling and reassembling teams on a low budget, traded nine A's players last offseason, many of whom were All-Stars. Many expected this 2015 team to struggle, and struggle they have, but the A's are among the best in offense and starting pitching this season. Their poor record can be attributed mainly to an unanticpatedly bad bullpen and lack of run distribution (despite scoring the fourth-most runs this season, the amount varies greatly by game).    What direction is the team headed? Better or worse?    This team, as it stands, is likely to regress to about a .500 record, but I don't see Beane keeping it intact. There are three key players who are impending free agents - Zobrist, Kazmir, and Clippard - who offer no value to the A's next season. (Because of the team's low payroll and adversity to having players past their prime, it's unlikely that any of them are re-signed). This year's market for offensive pieces and starting pitching is relatively dismal, and there are teams that would admittedly ""overpay"" for some of the above-mentioned players. Beane can target prospects or young major leaguers who will be ready to compete by next season; the foundation for the organization is strong, but it could benefit from some young outfielders, pitchers, and another middle infielder.    Why are you an A's fan?   My dad raised me as one, and I've loved them ever since."
OaklandAthletics,3c9g6t,Worthyness,2,Mon Jul 6 04:08:47 2015 UTC,"First of all let me say, welcome to the greatest fan base in the MLB! If you ever make it out to the O.co for a game, try to go on the weekends as they tend to be the best crowds.    Who's your favorite player and why?   As a kid not knowing anything about baseball I loved all the stars. Mark McGwire and Canseco. When I actually started following the A's I liked Tejada and Eric Chavez. Currently my favorite player is Coco Crisp. I am sad that this might be his last MLB season. Crisp has been largely responsible for the A's resurgence to the postseason and general success the last few years.   How is this season compared to previous seasons?   In short, very difficult. There just has not been enough wins this year to enjoy the season. The last few years this team was winning at one of the best clips in baseball. 6-21 in games decided by a run. I can't even begin to tell you how unfortunate that is.   What direction is the team headed? Better, worse?   Honestly it's hard to say. The way the team operates you never know if they will be relevant/in contention or out of contention by the AS break. I'd like to be optimistic, but there's not much to be optimistic about at least in the immediate future. IMO with all the trade rumors swirling, I really doubt we'll see the playoffs this year or next year. Why? I see a lot of people on this thread praising our offense for being 6th ranked or whatever, but I still don't buy this offense. It's really inconsistent and as you can see from the above statistic, they often fail to push a run across or get a key hit when the game is on the line. I think we'll need a few more offensive pieces before we can rest assured about consistent production. Also, the bullpen is an absolute shit show. There is not one reliever in our bullpen that can be trusted by the manager. Aside from a few arms, it needs a complete retooling.    Why are you an A's fan?   I grew up in the East Bay Area watching the Giants and A's since I was a kid. I became an A's fan because it was closer to home and I could attend more A's games. I also liked the club's history (how cool is it that a player that grew up Oakland got his first major league opportunity with the Oakland A's and became one of the franchise's best players!) . I also like the underdog feel the A's have always had. The team colors are pretty cool too!"
OaklandAthletics,3c9g6t,hamster4sale,4,Mon Jul 6 23:57:15 2015 UTC,"Who's your favorite player and why?   As a rule I don't have a favorite player because he will get traded sooner rather than later.   How is this season compared to previous seasons?   We are last in the division, but it's insanely early in the season and we've made crazier comebacks to get into the playoffs.   What direction is the team headed? Better, worse?   We're in a constant state of trading away our best players for younger ones, but rebuilding with remarkable speed. Billy Beane does an amazing job putting together winners with underrated/young players, but in the back of my mind I'm worried we'll never win a championship this way.   Why are you an A's fan?   Because my dad, despite being a Giants fan, took me to A's games growing up. I expect it's because he's afraid of crowds, it was closer, and it was cheaper. I'm really glad he did! I really fell in love with the team in high school when they had an amazing run off success starting in 2000 on the back of great players like Mulder, Hudson, Zito, Tejada, Giambi, and Chavez."
OaklandAthletics,3c9g6t,Worthyness,5,Mon Jul 6 04:35:15 2015 UTC,You should just make Eric Sogard your favorite player. pretty darn impossible to trade away a guy who is just doing barely enough to be a starter.

OaklandAthletics,3c9g6t,GuyBelowMeDoesntLift,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:04:29 2015 UTC,"No favorite players. As an A's fan, you will never be able to form attachments because once you have, they're gone for good (or until they need 1 last hurrah to see if they can make their career). Season sucks compared to the last 3 years. Mostly because we went from favorites to win the division to last place in the league. Significantly better than 2007-2011 to watch, but probably worse record wise.  They're playing better, but not good enough. Unfortunately, the way they've been playing, I see a Billy Beane trade special coming at the deadline, the only way Billy Knows how. He'll trade away Zobrist/Kazmir/Clippard in exchange for some MLB ready prospect and some A-/B level prospects for later- retooling for now and for the future. But 2012 taught me to never count the A's out of contention.  they were 10-13 out of last place in 2012 and won the division, which is a possibility to happen again this season. And literally the only thing that could be worse is if our amazing starting pitching goes the way of the Boston Red Sox or Billy Beane has a super fire sale and sets his mind on rebuilding.  Oakland is my home town, so it's a natural fit. Plus I like the history of the club, the crazy things the Front office does, and the constant underdog status. The A's don't get much respect, but they sure as hell earn it."

As someone else said, everyone leaves the moment you fall in love with them.   How is this season compared to previous seasons?   Not so good. We've made it to the postseason the last three seasons, and I think last year's second half collapse foreshadowed what's going on in 2015. It's just not good.   What direction is the team headed? Better, worse?   We're talking about Billy Beane here, the GM so good they made a movie about him. They'll come back soon.   Why are you an A's fan?   I live in New York, and have my whole life.

Burns has been below average defensively according to UZR. A .358 OBP is not that exciting, although his base stealing ability is valuable. He's the best player out there right now no doubt.  Canha has the potential to be an average MLB OF. He's 26 years old, has an average bat so far, and slightly below average as an OF.  Burns and Canha are average-ish, but not exciting, and Fuld is pretty bad (he's okay for a 4th OF/pinch runner)."

I agree with Chavvy, he needs to develop a better curve or slider and he can be a solid 3rd or 4th starter for this rotation."
OaklandAthletics,3c7k2g,tdov,2,Sun Jul 5 21:16:52 2015 UTC,"He'll go down after today and that's what they'll work on. I believe he's been working on change up, slider and curve down there."
OaklandAthletics,3c7k2g,TAKATTAK,2,Sun Jul 5 21:24:12 2015 UTC,"Hi guys, Zobrist came up as a potential trade target for the Yankees over at our GDT earlier today, and I was wondering if you guys think it would be a possibility.  If it is, what do you think a trade would look like?  Zobrist is a FA this offseason, and I don't know what other teams would be interested in picking him up by the trade deadline."
OaklandAthletics,3c7k2g,tdov,2,Sun Jul 5 21:15:11 2015 UTC,That Aaron Judge guy looks really attractive.
OaklandAthletics,3c7k2g,TAKATTAK,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:27:31 2015 UTC,"He does to us too!  ;___;  I think he may be ready right around when Beltran's contract is finished, so I'm not sure if the FO would be willing to move him.  We had Heathcott and Williams play OF for us briefly before they went down to injuries earlier this season, and both looked quite solid.  If they weren't injured right now, I think they would have garnered more interest for this year's trade (or at least had more value)."
OaklandAthletics,3c7k2g,tdov,2,Sun Jul 5 21:39:37 2015 UTC,"With Godner and Ellsbury though, the Yankees look stacked in the OF. Also you gotta think NYY is in on one of Heyward/Upton."
OaklandAthletics,3c7k2g,LibertarianSocialism,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:33:40 2015 UTC,"My dream for this offseason would be to see Gardner-Ellsbury-Heyward/Upton in the OF and Beltran traded away to some team that needs a DH (Angels?).  That would really make the top of our order insane and address one of the problems we have (RF defense).  But the new financial direction the Yankees seem to be taking makes the first part just a dream.  Well, I guess my hesitation from dealing Judge mostly comes from the fact that Zobrist would be a half-season rental.  If adding Zobrist meant that we'd have a solid shot at advancing to the WS, or if he was on contract for 2016 as well, I'd consider it.  However, even with Zobrist, I think we have too many holes this year for the trade to be worthwhile.  I know the Mets stated they were ""willing to overpay"" for Zobrist, which...seemed strange to me.  Have there already been discussions on what kind of return the A's would expect to get for Zobrist?  I really don't know how to evaluate him, because most of his value comes from his defensive versatility."
OaklandAthletics,3c7k2g,TAKATTAK,2,Mon Jul 6 22:31:22 2015 UTC,"If adding Zobrist meant that we'd have a solid shot at advancing to the WS,   TBH, the AL East, and the AL as a whole, is weak as fuck IMO. There isn't a ""best team in the AL"".  If NYY wins the AL East, I could easily see them in the WS with Zobrist. Their real only true weakness is the middle infield. Unlike the NL, where the Nats, Cards, and Dodgers all look dominant, every AL team has some major weaknesses unless someone gets aggressive at the deadline and sells the farm to fix them weaknesses. Its a super even spread.    if he was on contract for 2016 as well, I'd consider it.   yeah, but I think considering his age, he signs an extension at a moderately reasonable price (think higher AAV, but 4 years or fewer). Definitely very extendable if the Yankees trade for him IMO.   Also my Brett GODner votes in the ASG final vote voting hopefully provide some mystic karmic powers that get Aaron Judge in Oakland. I really love him as a prospect."
OaklandAthletics,3c7k2g,LibertarianSocialism,3,Tue Jul 7 03:26:06 2015 UTC,"Zobrist is likely gone despite how much we wanted him all these years, and you're going to be in competition with a lot of other teams. I'm pretty sure Beane will be looking for someone to overpay for him though."
OaklandAthletics,3c7k2g,TAKATTAK,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:23:25 2015 UTC,"What is Oakland missing this year?  I know people were saying they should have a much better W-L record based on their RS/RA, and that their W-L record in 1-run games was ""bad luck""...I remember our announcers saying you guys needed better relievers (even though they did a pretty good job shutting us down), based on the 1-run and extra innings W-L record.  Is that an area Oakland is looking to improve, or do they have players coming up soon to fill that need?"
OaklandAthletics,3c7k2g,Johnb628,2,Sun Jul 5 21:42:03 2015 UTC,"Bullpen, defense, clutchiness."
OaklandAthletics,3c7k2g,TAKATTAK,1 point,Sun Jul 5 21:44:41 2015 UTC,"I was going to say defense and clutchiness sounds like us too, but I didn't realize you guys were in the same neighborhood as us in those categories.  We leave on average 3.62 runners in scoring position, and you guys leave 3.80 runners (24th and 28th in MLB).  We have 54 errors on the season and you guys have 79 (24th and 30th in MLB).  I was going to say we have the 3B leading all of MLB in errors in Headley (16), but forgot you guys had Semien.  If we didn't have Tex at first place, I think we'd be closer to you guys in errors because he's saved quite a few throws from Didi/Drew/Headley this year.  We had a player get charged for 2 errors on 1 play that ended up costing us 2 unearned runs today..."
OaklandAthletics,3c7k2g,Johnb628,3,Sun Jul 5 22:03:18 2015 UTC,"Definitely a possibility, what team couldn't use a Ben zobrist type of player. As far as what it would take I'm not sure, we had to give up a top prospect for him, #1 in fact. But obviously that was for a full year of Zob(and Escobar) so for a half year the price would likely be less. What are some prospects you guys were talking about?"
OaklandAthletics,3c7k2g,TAKATTAK,2,Sun Jul 5 21:21:23 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, I didn't realize that you guys had to give up a #1 for him!  The initial suggestion was Luis Severino for Ben Zobrist, which seems like an overpay to me.  Severino's a 21 year old starter, #1 prospect in our system (I think depending on where you look, he's in the top 20-50 in all of baseball), and may be ready to come up this year.  He has a mid-90s fastball, and has just wrecked the minors.  What positions would the A's be looking to fill?  OF and RP are really the only two positions we have some flexibility in."
OaklandAthletics,3c7k2g,Johnb628,2,Sun Jul 5 21:46:34 2015 UTC,"We really need some OF depth in our system, I'd say that is #1 need. Severino looks solid tho, and beane always looks for young pitching."
OaklandAthletics,3c7k2g,TAKATTAK,2,Sun Jul 5 21:53:19 2015 UTC,"OF is something we have, but with (not really surprising) injuries to our starting OFers, Beltran and Ellsbury, AND injuries to our backup OFers (Heathcott and Williams)...We're a little thin as well.  If they were healthy, I could've seen the Yankees try to shop Heathcott/Williams for necessary pieces midseason, but with their injuries and incredibly short major league stints, I'm not sure if they have enough value to get anybody worthwhile."
OaklandAthletics,3c7k2g,Worthyness,2,Sun Jul 5 22:11:21 2015 UTC,"what would you think of a severino/williams or severino/heathcott, too much? itll be interesting to see what Beane can get for him, especially seeing as there will be a lot of teams competing for him"
OaklandAthletics,3c7k2g,Bumbleinthejungle,2,Sun Jul 5 22:31:19 2015 UTC,"Personally, I wouldn't want to see the Yankees trade for Zobrist if it'll take Severino.  It's not that I think Zobrist is worth less, but that adding Zobrist to our roster won't make us a WS-caliber team.  Since Zobrist would be a rental, I'd be annoyed if we trade away our top prospect to add a player who wouldn't necessarily guarantee our chances at the WS.  Not to mention, starting depth is something we don't have, so I'd be surprised if they decide to trade away Severino.  Of course, the FO could be trying to orchestrate multiple moves to address that weakness, but with our current roster, I think the Yankees would only be willing to move OF and RP this season."
OaklandAthletics,3c7k2g,jq7925,6,Mon Jul 6 21:57:19 2015 UTC,"Given his flexibility, the whole not being shit at defense at all the positions he plays, plus the fact that he can actually hit on a consistent basis, A LOT of contenders are probably very willing to obtain him.

OaklandAthletics,3c49er,phillywill,2,Sat Jul 4 22:29:51 2015 UTC,What was that comment they made about Canha having been suspended before?  I can't find anything online about that.  Edit: I think they were talking about the M's Rule 5 pick being suspended before and then switched focus to Canha which made it sound that way.  I know about Ladendorf's suspension but still can't find any evidence Canha was before.

OaklandAthletics,3c1570,friardon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:39:58 2015 UTC,Not sure if still true. As a kid I sent a card to the A's addressed to him and he signed it. Just be sure to include a self addressed stamped envelope.  And make sure it is a card you have a double of. I would not recommend sending a hat though...
OaklandAthletics,3c1570,andrew_ski,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:47:58 2015 UTC,"I sold a cake to Rickey 6 months ago or so. Tried to not come off like a creeper, but I was so stoked."

That's been true since I was a kid and watched him with the A's. I had a chance to meet him once when he was with Seattle.   Had seats near the home dugout and he was walking back after a sac fly. I shouted out, ""Happy Birthday Rickey!"" (it was his birthday of course).  He smiled and gave me The Point. Cool guy."
OaklandAthletics,3c1570,JasonEll,2,Fri Jul 3 21:36:23 2015 UTC,"This story is somewhat doubtful since his birthday is on Christmas. I mean, I don't doubt that Rickey would point back all smiley and all even if it WASN'T his birthday, 'cause he's that cool."

OaklandAthletics,3c2j5c,Drumitar,7,Sat Jul 4 04:02:16 2015 UTC,Hey guys I'm here for the pity party.
OaklandAthletics,3c2j5c,Sfer,5,Sat Jul 4 04:02:22 2015 UTC,Seriously our  Bullpen has to be the worst in MLB history. I can't imagine having the best Starter ERA and run differential and still being in last place.
OaklandAthletics,3c2j5c,cali_daddy,5,Sat Jul 4 04:09:49 2015 UTC,"So I just took a look at the numbers, and I'm legitimately blown away.  I just looked it up, and we actually have the second best Starting Pitcher ERA in baseball (after the Cardinals).  In terms of runs scored per game, we're number 6.  But if you subtract our SP ERA from our runs scored, effectively looking at how many more runs we score than allow?  We're number 1 and it's not even close.  Better than the Cardinals, better than the Royals, and almost an entire run per game over the Astros.  This would almost be funny if it weren't happening to us.  As you might imagine, we're second worst in Relief Pitcher ERA (I'm somewhat surprised the Rockies are actually worse than we are), and you know who the two best are?  KC and St. Louis.  So really, it does all come down to our godawful relief pitching.  Obviously there's some bad luck thrown in, and we are also the worst team by far in terms of errors, but I wouldn't give up on this team just yet."
OaklandAthletics,3c2j5c,m0nkeybl1tz,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:29:46 2015 UTC,It's almost by design really. It's like the team is working flawlessly for what it was built to do. The unforeseen or left to chance factors are what's killing us.
OaklandAthletics,3c2j5c,sean_g,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:34:01 2015 UTC,I am still holding out hope that we will figure this thing out. I hope that Pat Venditte coming back might help us sure up the bullpen. He has been excellent the few innings he has pitched before the injury. I can also see the light at the end of the tunnel. I just hope it's not an oncoming train.

OaklandAthletics,3c2j5c,sean_g,2,Sat Jul 4 04:21:52 2015 UTC,"It's really like fustrating his predictable we are though. We don't strike out the side unless the bases are loaded, we don't hit until the 3rd out, and we don't rally until the 9th. We're unclutch but sorta clutchy just don't follow through. I don't know I'm sad."
OaklandAthletics,3c2j5c,Worthyness,2,Sat Jul 4 06:40:39 2015 UTC,"I feel it. If the team could just decide one way or another if they good or not, I'd be so much happier.  I hate being teased with weeks of brilliance, and then we get swept."

OaklandAthletics,3c1j7g,StraddlingTheRubicon,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:13:23 2015 UTC,"Matt Reynolds + Brandon Nimmo makes sense to me. I can't see the Mets parting with Conforto for a half-season of anyone, but that would certainly represent the kind of ""overpay""  that's been rumored. Nimmo came into the season ranked higher than Conforto, but given their respective performances this season I would have to expect that's changed. The Mets have a lot of interesting pieces to dangle (Casey Meisner is my favorite) and I think they're a great match for the A's if they decide to sell."

OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,Raidenbobalay,4,Sat Jul 4 03:31:19 2015 UTC,Man we suck on Fridays. We are 3 for 12 on Fridays.
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,Worthyness,2,Sat Jul 4 03:30:55 2015 UTC,Scribner is not an 8th inning reliever
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,Raidenbobalay,2,Sat Jul 4 03:30:08 2015 UTC,"well, not anymore at least."
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,LibertarianSocialism,3,Sat Jul 4 03:30:45 2015 UTC,I'm usually not on the Melvin is in the wrong camp but has he been watching Scribner at all? He's been horrible

OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,EpicDawg,2,Sat Jul 4 03:30:10 2015 UTC,scribner should not be in close games... where is pom ? felix tommorow....
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,Mooninite69,5,Sat Jul 4 03:28:48 2015 UTC,Bullpen is unbelievable. How can they be this bad.
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,Johnb628,3,Sat Jul 4 03:28:22 2015 UTC,Blowpen.
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,EpicDawg,7,Sat Jul 4 03:28:01 2015 UTC,Just when I get hope for this team the Bullpen always reminds why we're in last place
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,JackCustComeback,6,Sat Jul 4 03:27:37 2015 UTC,FUCK. This game started out so promisingly.

OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,JackCustComeback,2,Sat Jul 4 03:21:34 2015 UTC,Just flipped to you guys on the second monitor. Hows it been so far?
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,OSUG1,2,Sat Jul 4 03:21:13 2015 UTC,At first it was like :D and then it was like :| and then it was like :(
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,JackCustComeback,4,Sat Jul 4 03:23:28 2015 UTC,EOF has been really good since coming off the DL right or has that just been my imagination
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,Johnb628,2,Sat Jul 4 03:10:38 2015 UTC,"6.1 IP, 2 runs, 8 hits, 4 Ks, 5 BBs"
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,gassmaster,2,Sat Jul 4 03:14:35 2015 UTC,well more walks than strikeouts isn't encouraging but baby steps

OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,callie06,2,Sat Jul 4 03:09:51 2015 UTC,0-2 with a 7.35 ERA. Yeah let's put this guy in and see how it goes.
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,MrSaladFork,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:08:53 2015 UTC,Suddenly though those stats are old!
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,JackCustComeback,3,Sat Jul 4 03:10:12 2015 UTC,"Pretty well, actually"
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,Mooninite69,4,Sat Jul 4 03:09:40 2015 UTC,Chavez reads ad-copy terrrribly lol
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,callie06,8,Sat Jul 4 03:07:15 2015 UTC,"Why in the world is his name pronounced like ""jay"" or ""j""? What's the point of the ""a"" if it's initialized but the first letter on its own gives you the pronunciation?"
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,MrSaladFork,2,Sat Jul 4 03:00:26 2015 UTC,It's even stupider than having two P's in your last name. Why not Hap?
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,Mooninite69,3,Sat Jul 4 03:06:30 2015 UTC,j hap
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,TheWheats56,4,Sat Jul 4 03:11:13 2015 UTC,So I'm not the only one who's annoyed...
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,Mooninite69,2,Sat Jul 4 03:03:50 2015 UTC,"It annoyed me when I thought I was supposed to pronounce each letter individually because it's hard to say ""a"" after ""j,"" but it annoys me even more that you don't even say the ""a."" Should I just call A.J. Griffin ""A Griffin""? Or D.J. Lemay(however you spell his last name) ""D""? No, because there are two letters!  Doesn't help that we're losing. Stupid j hap"
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,Naive_Melodies,6,Sat Jul 4 03:17:09 2015 UTC,Mike Gallego windmill? More like Green Energy Baseball amirite?
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,NopeNotConor,3,Sat Jul 4 02:58:37 2015 UTC,Ah geez and Happ is STILL out there?  How have we not butchered him yet...

OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,MrSaladFork,7,Sat Jul 4 02:50:33 2015 UTC,Former A's...
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,MrSaladFork,3,Sat Jul 4 02:50:09 2015 UTC,God damnt.
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,JackCustComeback,7,Sat Jul 4 02:50:00 2015 UTC,we should acquire every former a
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,JackCustComeback,5,Sat Jul 4 02:49:49 2015 UTC,And then trade them all to Japan where they can't hurt us.
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,2,Sat Jul 4 02:52:29 2015 UTC,Butler's really not hustling tonight...
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,Ethanhekker,9,Sat Jul 4 02:41:03 2015 UTC,Still tired from that triple.

OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,spaceace510,2,Sat Jul 4 02:22:21 2015 UTC,RAISE THAT LEFTY OBP
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,Chop_Hard,3,Sat Jul 4 02:28:58 2015 UTC,I THINK A FIELDER'S CHOICE COUNTS THE SAME AS AN OUT IN OBP
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,2,Sat Jul 4 02:31:31 2015 UTC,"AH, INTERESTING. I DID NOT KNOW THAT"
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,surfingyt,4,Sat Jul 4 02:41:31 2015 UTC,Chavez ain't got no root beer float banter. I miss Ray already.
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,solostman,3,Sat Jul 4 02:19:57 2015 UTC,I hope they keep Happ out there
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,OSUG1,3,Sat Jul 4 02:18:17 2015 UTC,Actually a really interesting conversation between Glen and Chavez  Edit: about hitters attacking the pitcher as a team.
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,spaceace510,4,Sat Jul 4 02:15:01 2015 UTC,"So according to that, A's have some of the better hitters and M's have some of the worst, and we basically have the same shitty record.  Baseball is stupid."
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,surfingyt,4,Sat Jul 4 02:14:27 2015 UTC,"its basically us not being able to win a close game, while at the same time having quite a few blowouts"
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,HumpCatter,3,Sat Jul 4 02:15:47 2015 UTC,I fucking love Chavy. My childhood hero.

OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,JackCustComeback,2,Sat Jul 4 02:04:28 2015 UTC,Did his foot touch the bag?  Looked like it might of been short
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,SpanishBombs23,3,Sat Jul 4 02:06:51 2015 UTC,"It was close looking at the replay, but he was indeed out"
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,Ethanhekker,3,Sat Jul 4 02:06:14 2015 UTC,Replay was close but definitely out.

OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,Ethanhekker,2,Sat Jul 4 02:02:12 2015 UTC,This is gonna be one of those games huh?
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,surfingyt,6,Sat Jul 4 02:00:32 2015 UTC,the A's just signed 2 16-year olds
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,Tario70,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:57:39 2015 UTC,"Are they hot?  *- I meant are they hitting well lately, perverts."
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,TomK115,3,Sat Jul 4 02:00:19 2015 UTC,1 pitcher and one OF guy. So if that's what you're into then sure.
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,spaceace510,3,Sat Jul 4 02:08:49 2015 UTC,MMmmmm
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,Worthyness,4,Sat Jul 4 02:13:44 2015 UTC,What lol
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,spaceace510,6,Sat Jul 4 02:02:37 2015 UTC,Are we not doing phrasing anymore?
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,6,Sat Jul 4 02:04:29 2015 UTC,it's fine. He's probably on some list now though.
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,callie06,5,Sat Jul 4 02:04:20 2015 UTC,Downvoted for supplying news. I got ya.
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,Drewby99,4,Sat Jul 4 01:59:48 2015 UTC,I THOUGHT THIS WAS AMERICA
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,JackCustComeback,2,Sat Jul 4 02:01:52 2015 UTC,OIC it's gonna be one of those games.  Fine! Let's go Oakland!

OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,surfingyt,5,Sat Jul 4 01:55:36 2015 UTC,Chavez was probably confused when he received run support.
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,spaceace510,3,Sat Jul 4 01:55:06 2015 UTC,well at least we still have the lead...
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,3,Sat Jul 4 01:54:54 2015 UTC,and it's only the 3rd inning.
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,MrSaladFork,2,Sat Jul 4 01:56:32 2015 UTC,"well if we keep batting like last inning, hopefully we can build on it"
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,2,Sat Jul 4 01:58:29 2015 UTC,Neat.
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,MrSaladFork,2,Sat Jul 4 01:54:47 2015 UTC,Oof
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,Johnb628,2,Sat Jul 4 01:54:46 2015 UTC,Oh no
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,Worthyness,11,Sat Jul 4 01:54:13 2015 UTC,"mistake there by jesse. ideally he should have thrown a pitch that didn't get hit for a home run. instead, he threw a pitch that did."
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,LibertarianSocialism,2,Sat Jul 4 01:54:13 2015 UTC,"Hello, Coach Madden. How's things?"
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,JackCustComeback,2,Sat Jul 4 01:55:45 2015 UTC,Chavez sorry about earlier this season.
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,LibertarianSocialism,2,Sat Jul 4 01:52:11 2015 UTC,So great when we give our pitchers early run support!
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,Ethanhekker,7,Sat Jul 4 01:50:57 2015 UTC,McClendon looks like he's thinking about his lawn.
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,JackCustComeback,4,Sat Jul 4 01:49:00 2015 UTC,I need to pick up some of that Scott's Turf Builder when we get home.
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,scwoop,2,Sat Jul 4 01:50:54 2015 UTC,I could really go for some figs. I wonder if Lowe's has fig trees...
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,Worthyness,4,Sat Jul 4 01:53:14 2015 UTC,"Billy ""RBI MACHINE"" Burns"
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,MrSaladFork,2,Sat Jul 4 01:48:53 2015 UTC,Burns GOAT leadoff hitter
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,TheBabyWhale,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:48:52 2015 UTC,"Pretty easy being a great, speedy lead off hitter when you're on a team with Coco Crisp and the greatest lead off hitter in baseball history."

OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,sean_g,2,Sat Jul 4 01:11:30 2015 UTC,Well he hasn't won in 9 starts so yes
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,NightWriter500,3,Sat Jul 4 01:19:49 2015 UTC,This means he's winning against us doesn't it
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,sean_g,3,Sat Jul 4 01:21:20 2015 UTC,There goes the perfect game
OaklandAthletics,3c1hg1,NightWriter500,2,Sat Jul 4 01:10:06 2015 UTC,"If everyone else would start losing, that would be great."
OaklandAthletics,3c0hl4,timmaay531,21,Fri Jul 3 17:26:31 2015 UTC,"Maybe if he started batting higher than .120 against lefties he'd get put in. Just a thought. Performance dictates playing time, and he doesn't really deserve playing time vs. Lefties."
OaklandAthletics,3c0hl4,ziggmiceter,4,Fri Jul 3 19:03:19 2015 UTC,"Shit, even last night he struck out twice vs a left handed pitcher. And Elias is not even near the quality of de la Rosa."
OaklandAthletics,3c0hl4,Bumbleinthejungle,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:20:44 2015 UTC,"Not only that but De La Rosa is groundball pitcher whereas Reddick would matchup more favorable to a pitcher who gives up more flyballs than average.  This isn't as important as L/R splits, but I've noticed that it does go into to the A's decision making when creating a lineup."
OaklandAthletics,3c0hl4,MichaelChicklis,3,Fri Jul 3 23:17:16 2015 UTC,"my thoughts on this: i love reddick, everyone should love reddick. but publicly being mad about occasionally not starting against lefties (and i really do mean occasionally) when he's been horrible against lefties all year this year and last year is totally unnecessary. it borders on putting himself before the team to me.    another thing is bomel is defeinitely not being totally overruled on reddick against lefties. we've seen bomel pinch hit for reddick against lefties because he sucks against them. i'd bet melvin is entirely on board with every time reddick sits against a lefty."
OaklandAthletics,3c0hl4,JackCustComeback,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:15:48 2015 UTC,Well of course he's on board its his decision
OaklandAthletics,3c0hl4,Jtaltstatt,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:25:28 2015 UTC,"Reddick suggested the team’s front office, specifically general manager Billy Beane, is making the call to keep him on the bench at times against opposing left-handers.     from the article"
OaklandAthletics,3c0hl4,JackCustComeback,2,Sat Jul 4 03:27:49 2015 UTC,I hate when I'm wrong
OaklandAthletics,3c0hl4,Jtaltstatt,6,Sat Jul 4 04:37:56 2015 UTC,This is like the reverse of the dodgers drama with mattingly's platooning. Players don't seem to make noise about it but a lot of fans do. I don't know if it's wise sitting a hot bat but I trust bomel. Reddick probably feels like his bad numbers are a self fullfilling prophecy having minimal ABs vs LHP recently.
OaklandAthletics,3c0hl4,sean_g,7,Fri Jul 3 18:15:37 2015 UTC,When Donaldson started talking like this he was gone shortly thereafter...
OaklandAthletics,3c0hl4,Tario70,8,Fri Jul 3 18:16:42 2015 UTC,"If I remember correctly, at the time Reddick was also pretty vocal (on twitter) about the Donaldson trade, to the point it almost look like he was trying to force Beane to trade him also."

OaklandAthletics,3c0hl4,sean_g,5,Fri Jul 3 18:21:12 2015 UTC,"Not sure, but it would indicate a pattern & with Reddick having a great year & only 1 year left after this one..."
OaklandAthletics,3c0hl4,Tario70,2,Fri Jul 3 18:24:57 2015 UTC,Billy Beane in 2015 looks like he's mostly just the face of the organization but I think most of the trades go down to Forst. I also just refuse to believe a team as small market as the A's would be frivolous enough to make trades based on their emotions rather than analytical reasons.  We ain't the angels.

OaklandAthletics,3c0hl4,dogfacejitters,-2,Fri Jul 3 18:00:02 2015 UTC,BoMel has been way too fixated on the levty vs. righty thing for a couple seasons now to the point where it seems like he frequently will pull a hot stick and throw in a bench player purely because of it.
OaklandAthletics,3c0hl4,NightWriter500,2,Fri Jul 3 17:51:12 2015 UTC,"what do you consider ""a couple of seasons""? he's been the official manager (was interim latter half of 2011) since 2012.  he's only been with the A's ""a couple of seasons"".

OaklandAthletics,3bz393,imkindofcreative,6,Fri Jul 3 09:01:53 2015 UTC,"Lots of one run losses and arguably the best starting rotation with 4 starters in the top 15 in ERA. The A's have also pitched the most shut outs and have one of the best offenses in terms of runs scored.   So what's the deal? Well, the defense hasn't been solid, the bullpen has been very shaky, some early injuries to key players (Doo, Reddick, Zobrist), and just a lot of bad luck in April/May. I think they will turn it around and stay competitive in the second half. The AL west is shaping up to be a very weak division so we could potentially see another 2012 type of run to the playoffs."
OaklandAthletics,3bz393,elduderino1234,4,Fri Jul 3 09:46:25 2015 UTC,Ahh I see. Thanks for the explanation. That  Zobrist injury must have been killer. Did Clippard start the season as closer?

Like the 2014 A's, they had the best run differential in the majors by far but down the stretch, they couldn't buy a win if their lives depended on it.   There should be a statistic that counts run differential in the past two weeks or so, run differential that builds up during a season really doesn't mean much. That said, the 2015 A's seem to be playing well but I wouldnt get my hopes up on a playoff push."
OaklandAthletics,3bz393,Drumitar,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:43:38 2015 UTC,"Run differential over such a small sample size is probably a pretty poor measurement and may be prone to weak output. There are probably better, more localized numbers like total bases that work on a smaller scale."

I can't say I've seen any projection this year that says we shouldn't be at least .500  So I don't think it's cause we score 10-1 in some games and then lose 2-1.   Eventually those meaningless  6,7, and 8 runs from the blowout will go into the second game.   I'm not going to tell you that it was our defense or our bullpen, because our starting pitching and offense should be outweighing that to give us a .500 record. Baseball is just a bunch of bullshit luck. Same reason we go 2-3 every playoffs, just a bunch of zeros and ones not going our way."

OaklandAthletics,3bven1,yeast510,2,Thu Jul 2 21:15:02 2015 UTC,"Agh, if it's in the East Bay I'd have to carpool or something, since I don't think there are any feasible fields near Bart.  Coming from the City (but yes, an A's fan), I am carless."
OaklandAthletics,3bven1,NightWriter500,5,Thu Jul 2 21:22:31 2015 UTC,No worries! My plan was to organize carpooling for anyone who needed it
OaklandAthletics,3bven1,NopeNotConor,2,Thu Jul 2 21:35:57 2015 UTC,There are several softball fields within walking/bus distance from the Downtown Hayward Station. including Cannery Park and Bret Harte Middle School. Walking distance
OaklandAthletics,3bven1,sean_g,2,Thu Jul 2 21:30:47 2015 UTC,"Huh, thanks, half mile is a little tough while dragging about 100 lbs of equipment (if needed), but totally doable.  For the Battle of the Bay games I've scheduled, we've just looked at fields in Oakland."
OaklandAthletics,3bven1,BAYMuu,2,Thu Jul 2 21:42:51 2015 UTC,Check the San Pablo fields near N Berkeley Bart or Bushrod Park nearish ashby station.
OaklandAthletics,3bven1,Heliyum2,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:10:58 2015 UTC,San Pablo fields near N Berkeley Bart   thats close by. Id go just drink and yell things

OaklandAthletics,3bven1,MechPandaa,3,Thu Jul 2 15:40:07 2015 UTC,"Yep, I'm in. I've got about a dozen bats, bases, extra gloves, balls, etc. I manage a team in the Architects/Engineers league in the city, so we're pretty used to drinking while playing."

OaklandAthletics,3bven1,Jtaltstatt,2,Thu Jul 2 21:08:09 2015 UTC,"ah, I used to play in that league... didn't the league go wooden bats only?"
OaklandAthletics,3bven1,mister_klik,3,Thu Jul 2 22:40:15 2015 UTC,"Yep, wood bats for guys, metal for girls. Its supposed to even it out a bit. There are actually all kinds of weird rules in that league."

OaklandAthletics,3bwsg2,Worthyness,2,Thu Jul 2 20:34:58 2015 UTC,Buy only one six foot eight.  Nate will always be first baseman...  ....of my heart.
OaklandAthletics,3bwsg2,slinkey1998,3,Fri Jul 3 02:45:45 2015 UTC,He'd been struggling mightily in AAA. I doubt anyone claims him.
OaklandAthletics,3bwsg2,Maclin26,3,Thu Jul 2 20:29:01 2015 UTC,2.10 ERA this year in AAA. Not bad. Potential there.

OaklandAthletics,3bx8ag,slinkey1998,3,Thu Jul 2 22:14:23 2015 UTC,"/u/MichaelChicklis said it best, baseless speculation. Just judging from the haul it took to get Jeff Samardzija and Jason Hammel, a package that would include both Kazmir and Zobrist would probably require a near blue-chip, yet to debut, prospect that could come up in 2016. Baez is currently on a rehab assignment, Alcantara has underperformed a bit but just did make the Triple-A All Star game at 22 and is Vogelbach anything special? One of the few Cubs prospects I have heard nothing about. Heyman doesn't even say why he picked those three names, seems like he just looked a list of Cubs prospects and drew three random names.   Starting pitchers seem to be prizes at the deadline, and just about any team could use a Ben Zobrist. Only drawback is that they are both on last years of their contracts. Teams won't be able to flip them in the Winter like we did with Samardzija. Still, I imagine a combination of both Zobrist and Kazmir would bring in more than that."
OaklandAthletics,3bx8ag,ohgoditsmike,2,Fri Jul 3 03:03:02 2015 UTC,"Dan vogelbach has a very good bat, is fat, can't play defense, is a DH. Would love to have him but doesn't have that much value due to defensive deficiencies."

OaklandAthletics,3bx8ag,Drumitar,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:06:51 2015 UTC,Even if they can't flip them they can still give them qualifying offers right? So the team we traded with would get 1st round picks if they go elsewhere in free agency. Or did that rule change for midseason trades?
OaklandAthletics,3bx8ag,bsmarshalI,2,Fri Jul 3 06:37:41 2015 UTC,Cubs have no need for these contracts at this point. I won't be suprised when vogelbach and maybe Baez are traded but no way would they be traded for one year contracts unless cubs find themselves contenders for the world series this year
OaklandAthletics,3bx8ag,vcap51,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:33:55 2015 UTC,"unless cubs find themselves contenders for the world series this year   Well they have a WC spot at the moment, and upgrading with Zobrist/Kazmir over their replacements would be a huge boost. They probably won't catch the Cardinals either way, and Arrieta would probably be the WC starter. I wouldn't do it if I were the Cubs, but I wouldn't blame them if they did.   Like the other commenter in this thread said, it's not like this is a hard rumor."

OaklandAthletics,3bvam6,Raidenbobalay,5,Thu Jul 2 14:36:18 2015 UTC,I see that now. I guess the home runs we hit really irked them? or it was just a non incident.
OaklandAthletics,3bvam6,scottfarrar,10,Thu Jul 2 15:32:16 2015 UTC,"Having a hard nosed baseball team irks them, any HBP irks them, Brett Lawrie's intensity irks them, and now you guys do. Welcome!"

OaklandAthletics,3bvam6,cali_daddy,4,Thu Jul 2 19:08:20 2015 UTC,"I usually am on the side of the ""unintentionals"" but...   The pitch was a perfect bean: middle of the leg. Morales on first means he can't hit a HR Morales is slow, so he's not stealing... and probably wont even score on a double.   I agree its a one-run game, but if the Astros are feeling hot at the top of their division, and their two best players got beaned, and they feel confident they can handle any KC comeback... then sending a message might still be on the table."
OaklandAthletics,3bvam6,DocCalculus,2,Thu Jul 2 16:37:41 2015 UTC,that is definately a possibility
OaklandAthletics,3bvam6,Xtorting,2,Thu Jul 2 17:00:52 2015 UTC,"It's a possibility, but with a sidewinder/submariner like Neshek, it's really easy to let that slider run too far in on a lefty."

OaklandAthletics,3bur65,HaveADab,4,Thu Jul 2 23:05:02 2015 UTC,I just realized this is the midpoint in the season. 36-45 is 81 games. We'd have to go 54-27 (.667) in the second half to win 90 games. That's a steep hill to climb. We should start today.
OaklandAthletics,3bur65,MrSaladFork,7,Thu Jul 2 16:10:57 2015 UTC,At this point I'd be really really happy with 86 wins.
OaklandAthletics,3bur65,BBQTerrace,3,Thu Jul 2 16:28:21 2015 UTC,"If last year is any indicator, we barely snuck in the 2nd WC with 88 wins. It was 88 in the NL too. I have a feeling I'd be impressed with 86 wins but it would be infuriating."

OaklandAthletics,3bur65,surfingyt,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:15:02 2015 UTC,"Just messing around in chrome, this seemed to look a little better.   sup {    position: relative;    top: .65em;   height: 1em; }   The ""position: relative;"" moves it relative to it's ""normal"" position, which in this case is too high up and not in the box. The ""top: .65em"" moved it down that value (i just thought .65 looked decent), relative to it's normal position.   The logo kind of crowded the subscript so I put a ""height: 1em"" to basically act as padding and push the logo down, giving a little more breathing room. Anyways, here's the end result.  I only checked in chrome but hopefully it looks close in other browsers."
OaklandAthletics,3bur65,fsites,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:24:16 2015 UTC,"So, one of the clues as to what's wrong with the sprite sheet is that the Cleveland logo shows up on the calendar where the Colorado logo should. I'm not sure why NYY, Cleveland and Toronto are missing."
OaklandAthletics,3bur65,BBQTerrace,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:45:56 2015 UTC,"Hey it should be working now.   The order of teams wasnt in line with logos on sprite sheet, which caused Cleveland to display in Colorado's spot. Also, the HTML was calling for the sub url.. for example html was linking to /r/toronobluejays, but the sprite sheet only had the href ""/TOR"" for the toronto logo part of the image. The table was basically referencing a part of the image that didn't exist.   It may happen again as they play more teams that havent shown up on the schedule yet.. the marlins code looked a little funky. I can fix it tho if need be."

OaklandAthletics,3btfko,ErichV,2,Fri Jul 3 18:53:43 2015 UTC,"Here's some basic parent advice that you probably thought of already: bring snacks, water bottle, diapers if he still wears them, wipes, and a change of clothes. Day game: sunscreen and hat. Night game: jacket sweater or blanket, even in the Summer it gets really chilly for tiny people. Make sure it all fits in one bag because you might end up carrying the little guy around a lot.  Watch a few highlight clips ahead of time and talk about what's happening. That way when he sees the game in real life he'll be excited to see something he remembers. Show him some photos of or video of Stomper and the big headed Hall of Fame racers, that way when he gets bored, you can go for a walk around the Coliseum to find them. Also if he's under two, he gets in free."

OaklandAthletics,3bq4kg,PunkedFlip,9,Wed Jul 1 06:26:23 2015 UTC,"I think he puts too much emphasis on lefty vs right matchups both for his pitchers and hitters.   A lot of things aren't his fault though. The bull pen has collectively blown it so many times he's got nobody to turn to he can really count on every time. And the ones he does he can't use every day obviously. Plus all the injuries. Not to mention the offense is completely hit or miss, all or nothing. They've pretty much been alternating getting a crap ton of runs that even the bullpen can hold or they get like 1 or 2 and lose by a run.  2015 is just cursed. The A's stumbled with injuries but the bullpen completely steamrolled the season by mid may. truly astounding."
OaklandAthletics,3bq4kg,Barry_McKackiner,3,Wed Jul 1 16:11:40 2015 UTC,"I think he puts too much emphasis on lefty vs right matchups both for his pitchers and hitters.   I'm sure Melvin has some say, but if the platoons were statistically hurting more than helping, the front office would have demanded it changed. I just have a hard time disagreeing with the A's long term philosophy and honestly, platoons just simply make sense and do in a large sample size.   I also love it when Fuld starts over Reddick when a groundball pitcher is throwing. Its a new platoon that seems to have a strong correlation. Put in groundball batters when Kuechel is throwing, put in fly ball batters when Chris Young is starting."

OaklandAthletics,3bq4kg,Viking521,3,Wed Jul 1 18:42:22 2015 UTC,"Everyone has their peaks. I personally feel like Melvin has done wonders for struggling new players throughout his career. But once new faces turn old, well, it's hard to teach an old dog new tricks.   Either we should focus on a new fresh team that Melvin can mold again (Donaldson, Moss, Grey, and Vogt type players) or we need a new manager that can deal with what we have. Because something near the All Star Break needs to happen if Billy wants to contend."
OaklandAthletics,3bq4kg,Xtorting,4,Wed Jul 1 06:53:18 2015 UTC,I think Billy is just waiting for prime selling time. There's no way we can contend this year. I know the Gray trade was fake but it was so believable and personally I think Gray should be traded if we can get an embarrassment of riches in minor league talent and/or draft picks.

OaklandAthletics,3bq4kg,Bgro,3,Wed Jul 1 15:09:16 2015 UTC,"I believe in BoMel. That said, maybe someone can help me understand why he had Sogard batting lead on Friday instead of Fuld or others. Also, last night he subbed in Reddick for Lawrie when the slumping and left field playing Canha was up next? Sometimes I feel like he make some counter-intuitive moves."
OaklandAthletics,3bq4kg,thesearereddits,4,Wed Jul 1 16:07:15 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess, it's because they were facing a RHP so they subbed lefty Reddick for righty  Lawrie. Canha, although a righty,  hits well against RHP as I think all of his HR were off of RHP."

OaklandAthletics,3bq4kg,Maclin26,2,Wed Jul 1 18:57:12 2015 UTC,"Melvin is doing a fine job given the state of our players.  We sold off a lot of big pieces to make last year ""the year"". It didn't work out. Furthermore, there are plenty of players that were expected back after surgeries this year that just won't make it. This is, effectively, a rebuilding year for the club and our prospects.  I think those that give Melvin a hard time are looking for one person to blame for the team's poor performance. I think that is too easy of a way out. It is not just one person when your team is completely inconsistent at scoring runs and providing whole-field defense."

OaklandAthletics,3bqfvg,AthleticsBot,6,Wed Jul 1 09:00:10 2015 UTC,"I just want to say, at the risk of sounding like a cold hearted boo bird, that last nights crowd SUCKED.  The wave during a high pressure inning while WE were pitching was ridiculous. The amount of corporate 'outings' as at an all time high as well. I heard so many back handed complaints about baseball, the speed of baseball, why no one was getting hit, etc. Also the amount of ambient noise and drunk conversations was insane.   I guess that $2 deal really brought out the Marketing department.   Meh, rant over."

It is the fans that make the atmosphere special and whether there are 12,000 fans or 32,067 fans, the place is always rocking."

The Coliseum is where blue collar baseball fans go to watch baseball, and while it's certainly a better stadium (and team) the Giants' AT&T Park is where white collar folks go to watch stocks on their phones and eat nachos out of a helmet with a Giants game in the background. Having been to both, they're equally great experiences depending on what you're looking for out of a baseball game. But I'll take OCO all day long."

OaklandAthletics,3blljz,cb8100,15,Tue Jun 30 20:56:30 2015 UTC,"Oakland is extremely misrepresented in national media. Great town, great people, great product. Nothing can beat a good day in Oakland California. Little piece of history about the wave, because us A's fans love history.    Krazy George Henderson led a wave in October 15, 1981 at a Major League Baseball game in Oakland, California. This wave was broadcast on TV, and George has used a videotape of the event to bolster his claim as the inventor of the wave.    Also, watch Rebels of Oakland and you'll understand Oaklands love for sports. ""San Francisco was Oz, an international destination known around the world. Oakland is the worlds largest container port."" - Tom Hanks"
OaklandAthletics,3blljz,Xtorting,3,Tue Jun 30 13:51:09 2015 UTC,"If anyone's interested in Rebels of Oakland, it's on YouTube in 3 parts.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQb8eIN3jLg  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmvad2T1Lg4  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUQP6ccjt9Q  Edit: Never mind. It's four parts and the audio track to at least part one has been muted because of music copyrights."
OaklandAthletics,3blljz,DieHardRaider,3,Tue Jun 30 16:46:03 2015 UTC,"First part is muted, due to copyright claims. Issue is, there is no other alternatives available to purchase a copy. I have money to purchase a dvd, but no way to view it online or order a DVD. Only way to possibly watch the entire thing is to illegal download it. Which is exactly the root and cause of illegal downloading, no available/cheap alternatives.   All music and movie scenes should be muted too. /s"

OaklandAthletics,3blljz,Xtorting,6,Tue Jun 30 07:48:24 2015 UTC,I imagine when they've opened up the top deck it's been insane.

OaklandAthletics,3blljz,Drgntrnr,10,Tue Jun 30 06:04:49 2015 UTC,"Oh god. As a Giants fan I want to apologize for the wave, it is not a common occurrence at AT&T. I've been to about 50-60 games there over the years and I've never seen it happen.  Anyway, both stadiums are amazing places to enjoy a game, and I'm glad you got to experience them!"
OaklandAthletics,3blljz,TrappedAtReception,6,Tue Jun 30 07:41:20 2015 UTC,"AT&T is a great ballpark, the water and the layout of the stadium (inside and out) make it top notch.  More so, each Giants fan that I interacted with was nice, knowledgeable and seemingly a genuine fan.  This wasn't supposed to be a bash-SF post, I just happened to REALLY enjoy the atmosphere in Oakland (to my surprise).  And the wave is fine for minor league hockey games, but I'm glad to hear it's not a common occurrence."
OaklandAthletics,3blljz,swaggums,4,Tue Jun 30 08:08:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't take it as such, don't worry! Visiting a new stadium is a unique and eye-opening experience, with some better than others for different fans. There's nothing wrong with that. I was just appalled because I usually associate the wave with the Dodgers since they do it at Dodger Stadium almost every game haha. I think it's awesome you've been to so many stadiums, I'm trying to visit more as well. I'll be in Missouri in August, I'm hoping to check out Kauffman and Busch Stadiums!"
OaklandAthletics,3blljz,ANDRADE101,2,Tue Jun 30 08:20:57 2015 UTC,"Oh nice.  I've yet to get to either of those, but I'm in Illinois these days, so it should happen soon.  Enjoy!"
OaklandAthletics,3blljz,unbuttoned,4,Tue Jun 30 08:22:51 2015 UTC,"We don't do the wave because our Lord and Savior, Bill King, commanded it. He would rant about it on the radio broadcast, saying it was disrespectful to the players and the great game of baseball."

I like Semien but acquiring someone who is good enough to push Semien to 2B makes this team better. Teach Wendle some 3B and he can be a very good backup at 3B/2B next year. LF need is obvious. SP will be needed if we are trading Kazmir and Chavez. We have lots of #4/5 type guys but no one that can do step in for Kazmir/Chavez just yet.   And our farm system is terrible. We need an injection of young talent to have any kind of sustainable success."

OaklandAthletics,3bivjs,kuhanluke,4,Mon Jun 29 17:17:25 2015 UTC,"I would also like to keep Reddick, and pick up another slugging OF. Two hard hitting corners and burns in CF would be a potent combination.   As for Jesse, I could see them keeping him at least until the 2016 deadline because Griffin/Parker are still unknowns right now. If they come back and 1 of them enters the rotations next year, I could see them moving Chavez."

Is this team that played 2/3rds of the series without the lineup that has been on a good streak going to compete in the playoffs?

OaklandAthletics,3bg73t,SpanishBombs23,4,Sun Jun 28 23:09:03 2015 UTC,It's very odd. One week it looks like they might get to the .500 mark then suddenly the go back to poor defense and terrible clutch hitting. For every sweep we get swept right back
OaklandAthletics,3bg73t,surfingyt,3,Sun Jun 28 23:09:39 2015 UTC,"It's because last week we were putting out our ""it"" lineup; the lineup we set out, at the beginning of the year, to put on the field.  The lineups against the Royals have been awful."

Another sweep?  It's obvious this team is young and new together, but I think we need to realize this season isn't going anywhere."
OaklandAthletics,3bg73t,DontSayNoToPills,3,Sun Jun 28 23:10:28 2015 UTC,"If you mean it's over in the sense we won't make the playoffs then it's probably over.

It's awesome to see them beat the Angels and Rangers, but I really wanted then to succeed against a team like the Royals. One win would have been nice and yes I believe they could have won any of these games. That's what sucks the most. One AB ruins a game. I love the A's. They're alway scrappy and ready for the next challenge... But this series sort of sucked the wind out of me."

I'm limited to radio living in southern california so i understand.  You're right, we could have won any of these games.  I think that's a positive.  It ain't like we got blown out.  We shouldn't feel too good about it because a loss is a loss, but there are still reasons to just kick back and enjoy the games you get the opportunity to watch.    All in all, fuuuckkk this series sucked but i see no reason why we can't move on and kick ass in the next series."
OaklandAthletics,3bg73t,surfingyt,-1,Mon Jun 29 00:16:06 2015 UTC,"I mean being A's fans basically means we accept our position as a low payroll, underdog team. Any positivity is useful round these parts"

OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,Worthyness,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:07:09 2015 UTC,He's a tart?
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,boomsticking,4,Sun Jun 28 23:03:25 2015 UTC,Sweep the Tigers? Let's get swept by the Red Sox.  Sweep the Rangers? Let's get swept by the Royals.  Seems like the A's will nullify all good things that happen to them this season.
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,DontSayNoToPills,0,Sun Jun 28 23:07:26 2015 UTC,Burns swung at ball four. Semien up...  I'll be absolutely shocked if he gets on  Edit- color me shocked. I believe...
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,LibertarianSocialism,2,Sun Jun 28 23:02:40 2015 UTC,How shocked are you right now?
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,MrSaladFork,2,Sun Jun 28 23:00:45 2015 UTC,Semien doubling and Vogt striking out is pretty much the ironic twist of the knife to cap off this series :(
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,LibertarianSocialism,0,Sun Jun 28 23:03:29 2015 UTC,he'll probably hit a homerun and then we'll lose just to fuck with our 1 run game record.
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,Worthyness,2,Sun Jun 28 23:09:54 2015 UTC,"Oh Wade Davis...you can rest easy today, but we should have destroyed you yesterday..."
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,Mooninite69,6,Sun Jun 28 23:02:45 2015 UTC,I agree. Putting the ball in play would be contrary to the entire spirit of the series.
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,WordSalad11,2,Sun Jun 28 22:57:30 2015 UTC,No problem.   Go A's!!
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,accio7,3,Sun Jun 28 22:59:01 2015 UTC,Muncy and semien is a defensive dream on the left side of the infield /s
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,ajayoda,3,Sun Jun 28 22:54:15 2015 UTC,"Fosse: ""Jeez"""
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,OSUG1,0,Sun Jun 28 22:59:02 2015 UTC,Jeez these errors are killer
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,SailingBacterium,3,Sun Jun 28 22:52:51 2015 UTC,lol does he really need to have another error? It was going to be a close play either way.
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,Worthyness,4,Sun Jun 28 22:51:34 2015 UTC,Semien is actually retarded
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,DontSayNoToPills,0,Sun Jun 28 22:51:25 2015 UTC,eh?
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,DontSayNoToPills,0,Sun Jun 28 22:51:24 2015 UTC,There's only one Colon and his name is Bartolo
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,boomsticking,5,Sun Jun 28 22:51:22 2015 UTC,I wish we would demote Muncy and bring up Roberts.

OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,LibertarianSocialism,3,Sun Jun 28 22:49:05 2015 UTC,Needs to go. Now. Call up anyone else. He's terrible defensively and offensively.
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,Sfer,2,Sun Jun 28 22:46:18 2015 UTC,We have Alden Carrithers to play!
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,Worthyness,0,Sun Jun 28 22:48:32 2015 UTC,Home runs please. Seems like they can never hit em at home
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,SpanishBombs23,11,Sun Jun 28 22:44:38 2015 UTC,"Guys, this was a bad series and everything, but realize two things:  1) The Royals are a good team. Probably the best we've faced all month  and  2) We're playing the Rockies next. The Rockies. And then the Mariners. We'll be back on track soon."
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,DontSayNoToPills,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:45:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with you to an extent.  Losing multiple games in a row is something no team wants. Especially a team trying to climb back up into contention. What we have learned is A's just don't have ""it"". They aren't getting hits when they need hits, and they aren't making good defensive plays when it is key. Good teams have players that are clutch. The A's have 1 walk off, and have lost too many 1 run games to count both my hands, my friends hands, and so on.  This is what separates the A's from a team like the Royals or the Astros right now."
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,WordSalad11,2,Sun Jun 28 22:48:20 2015 UTC,Doesn't matter that KC is good. We needed to not get swept. Losing ground on Houston or the WC is really bad for us. Ruthless math of the playoffs.
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,MrSaladFork,2,Sun Jun 28 22:43:26 2015 UTC,I needed this comment. The only thing that'll make me happy after this is a 3 game sweep of the Rockies then at least 3/4 from the M's.
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,Drumitar,4,Sun Jun 28 22:43:10 2015 UTC,"i dont care what team we are playing, we have lost games we should be winning, good teams find ways to win in our case we find any and every possible way to lose !"
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,SpanishBombs23,3,Sun Jun 28 22:57:42 2015 UTC,True but it's hard not to live for the moment   :(

OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,4,Sun Jun 28 22:38:13 2015 UTC,"Shit, it was a pretty good month until this series."
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,LibertarianSocialism,6,Sun Jun 28 22:27:55 2015 UTC,"I don't really care if this is an overreaction but Semien is honestly horrible. We should trade him, not Zobrist."
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,WordSalad11,3,Sun Jun 28 22:27:51 2015 UTC,"He has played in literally every game this season except one. I don't know why you would expect a guy who has zero days off to continue to perform, but apparently the A's do."
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,8,Sun Jun 28 22:27:12 2015 UTC,"So I guess the Royals are kind of good, and we're kind of not. I like how we swept 3 teams and won a couple of series this month, then just poop the bed against the Red Sox and Royals. There's absolutely no pattern this year."
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,Johnb628,3,Sun Jun 28 22:30:09 2015 UTC,Hahah

OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,Mooninite69,7,Sun Jun 28 22:48:04 2015 UTC,"on the plus side, we still have 3 innings.   Though that's 3 innings of bullpens trying to keep a 1 run lead."

OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,Drumitar,3,Sun Jun 28 21:53:58 2015 UTC,I wish Ladendorf had stayed healthy.  I think he would have played a big role this season.
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,oneluv_hug,5,Sun Jun 28 22:36:46 2015 UTC,he was kind of Zobrist lite. I was kind of hoping to see what he would do with a few more games.
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,Drumitar,3,Sun Jun 28 22:40:47 2015 UTC,It kinda helps that he hasn't played a game since the 16th of June. And that we plucked him out of the minors because of injuries before he was even ready. He needs more reps in AAA than he does in the majors.   Though I suppose it's better than having semien/canha/sogard as the back up 3rd basemen.
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,Drumitar,13,Sun Jun 28 22:48:14 2015 UTC,"well thats the ballgame, not sure how muncy could turn a routine play into a 3 run inning !"

OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,Worthyness,7,Sun Jun 28 19:52:03 2015 UTC,Guthrie and Chavez on the mound and Billy Burns back on the roster. This will be a good one.  Good luck guys. Baseball is awesome.
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,8,Sun Jun 28 18:58:10 2015 UTC,"Guthrie has an ERA of 5.90, which sounds promising, but knowing our luck we'll make him look like Sandy Koufax out there."
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,Worthyness,8,Sun Jun 28 18:57:34 2015 UTC,"Guthrie is better than his numbers and has a knack for doing just enough to keep us in the game.  We're 8-6 in games that he starts, but we're 8-2 when he starts and the Royals score more than 1 run.  He gives up a lot of flyballs (near 40%), so you may dong today, but if he doesn't melt down don't be surprised if he does better than you'd expect.  In his 14 starts I would say that 2 of them were meltdowns (combined 6 IP, 17 ER, 25.5 ERA), but in his other 12 starts he's a much more reasonable (4.22 ERA).  Also he doesn't strikeout many, so if the BABIP fairy pays you a visit today you'll be in the money."
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,Xtorting,10,Sun Jun 28 19:22:35 2015 UTC,"The BABIP fairy has been avoiding us like he owes us money.  Also, Guthrie only needs 2 Ks for 1,000 in his career. That'll be good to see, I love me a veteran. 36 years old, 11th year in the league, 1692.2 IP. He made 32 starts last year. Pretty crazy."
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,6,Sun Jun 28 19:46:56 2015 UTC,"He has a really high ERA, we have Jesse Chavez Pitching, and the team has since reverted to pre-Sonny ray gnome sans the bullpen. We don't have a lot going for us, but since we have billy Burns back, we can test the ""Ray Fosse's light up sonny gray gnome only works with Billy Burns on the roster"""
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,Xtorting,3,Sun Jun 28 19:05:45 2015 UTC,"After watching the team without Burns, I'm thinking Burns might be Rookie of the Year material. I can never be relax with this damn team.   And of course my friend's parents are visiting and telling me what a terrible GM Beane is. Oh and Bochy is basically Jesus."
OaklandAthletics,3bf0i6,MrSaladFork,6,Sun Jun 28 18:42:34 2015 UTC,"Yea i don't understand people that criticize Billy's methods. Most of the time his trades make sense and are on point. Yes, some don't work out and that's because not everyone is infallible. But this team is a basically made from people he managed to randomly acquire as cast offs or second thoughts on trades. Not many GMs can do that, let alone get the team to the post season multiple times per decade. There are teams who have still only reached the post season once in the last two decades- in that time, Billy has gotten to the post season at least 7 times. And each time, they haven't won the whole thing. It sucks. Hopefully we find a team that can get us there eventually. I like his current plan and it technically is working. They just can't get everything on the same page, which is extremely disappointing."

Interesting timing of it all considering the A's seemed to be turning it around. Trading our Vet to our #1 division rivals sounds like selling mode to me. All we can do is wait..."
OaklandAthletics,3bcuna,Sfer,3,Sun Jun 28 00:36:10 2015 UTC,"Susan said if Kaz leaves they're in sell mode. I think it'll be clear by the All Star break. If we're still hot by then, they'll try and push forward. If not, sell off everyone and regroup for next year."

OaklandAthletics,3bcuna,scottfarrar,2,Sun Jun 28 08:07:32 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I feel like selling Kazmir could still have us compete, because we potentially have more SP.  Either Pomeranz or Bassitt could come up.  If we wanna get weird Zito could be the lefty in the pen haha.  I think it'd be a Zobrist trade that means we're done."
OaklandAthletics,3bcuna,Sfer,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:39:12 2015 UTC,"This is just was Susan said, and I feel like she'd be in the know with their intentions. I think what she was saying is that if Kaz is gone, expect them to trade all the other guys we won't have next year: Ike, clippard, and zobrist for example."
OaklandAthletics,3bcuna,Worthyness,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:47:48 2015 UTC,"Ike is in the same spot as Reddick. We'd basically have them for their final year of arbitration before Free agency, so I think we keep both of them unless a team REALLY wants them. Same with Vogt. If we go full scrap, we'd trade Kazmir and Zobrist and Clippard and maybe tag on OFlahrety onto one of their trades for some extra peanuts. Billy would get more talent from trading at the deadline than if he QO'd Zobrist/Kazmir. Plus if we trade Kazmir, the other team doesn't get to QO him and we could potentially sign him as a FA again (though he's gonna get paid this season with the numbers he put up during this contract)."
OaklandAthletics,3bcuna,slinkey1998,1 point,Sun Jun 28 18:01:50 2015 UTC,It seems odd that a team would option a player before announcing a trade.
OaklandAthletics,3bcuna,daneatdirt,3,Sun Jun 28 01:02:46 2015 UTC,Oberholtzer threw at A-Rod today and was ejected after a poor 1.1 inning outing. The presumption was his demotion was for punitive reasons.
OaklandAthletics,3bcuna,chaserjames,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:51:53 2015 UTC,I believe Obie was sent down for throwing at A-Rod. Not sure if it has anything to do with opening a spot. Could be wrong though.

OaklandAthletics,3bd9cv,TheMadBash,2,Sun Jun 28 03:09:59 2015 UTC,"Pomz can be sent to the rotation again and we can call up one of the pitchers we got for long reliever. Kaz/Pomz is a pretty fair jump, but not a terrible one.   If we trade both Kaz, clip, and Zobs, then for sure we tanking/playing spoiler until next season. I'm just wondering if Billy Beane goes full fire sale and sells off the other talents having great years right now. Namely Reddick, Vogt, Jesse Chavez, Ike Davis. All those guys will get someone to over pay for them."
OaklandAthletics,3bd9cv,Worthyness,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:12:18 2015 UTC,Davis is ok given how many other 1st base choices we have. Reddick would be bad for the same reason as Vogt- we don't have a serviceable back up that can replace their production. But Chavez would be a pretty easy sell given he's had 2 seasons of great starting pitching and billy picked up some pretty good pieces in trades this season.
OaklandAthletics,3bd9cv,Worthyness,6,Sun Jun 28 18:08:39 2015 UTC,"Would love to know if a team ever sold off its stars and still won a WS.

OaklandAthletics,3bbhn6,SmugglingGrapes,0,Sat Jun 27 23:01:19 2015 UTC,That happened the next AB and not on a 3-2 count. Running with a slow runner at the plate who Ks a lot is setting up the strike-out throw-out DP.

That has got to be the absolute worst lineup he's had and he's had lineups where Andy parrino was the starting Shortstop.  Hope Vogt is ok :/ Would absolutely suck to lose him and have him lose his all star bid. A lot of people deserve all star noms this year and he is one of the ones who deserves it the most."
OaklandAthletics,3b9yzw,Worthyness,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:07:38 2015 UTC,I do really do hope Vogt is alright. But if worst comes to worst at least we got Phegley as his back up. Dude has been a monster on and behind the plate.

And when it's the bottom of the ninth and the fans are feeling sore cause they think we're about to lose another, we'll I'll be damned if Big Pappa Vogt ain't going to lift that team up on his shoulders and hit two dingers to win the game, just to show he can.

OaklandAthletics,3b9yzw,LibertarianSocialism,-1,Sat Jun 27 05:05:46 2015 UTC,"I think for a Royal Flush they would have had to win the WS. Not even a straight flush because they were a WC team. Just a solid Queen-high flush. Nothing amazing, but pretty solid."

OaklandAthletics,3bafga,AthleticsBot,15,Sat Jun 27 09:00:10 2015 UTC,"Oakland, I can't stress enough how awesome your stadium, its staff and the overall atmosphere is! Now I've visited your park many times (Dan Haren is one my favorite ballplayers) but I took my sisters kids (3 and 7) to visit for the first time and they're always itching for baseball and they absolutely loved it. We walked the stadium and got to see the flag waving die hards, all the dudes with their faces painted up and loudest female fans I've seen anywhere (and I been all over the NL West!) The staff were beyond helpful and everyone stopped to ask where we were from and thanked us for visiting.   The biggest shocker was that these two kids ate a hotdog! THEY ATE A HOT DOG IN OAKLAND AFTER I TRIED ALL SEASON TO GET THEM TO EAT ONE IN LA. The 7 year old told me it just looks better here, so I wanted to try it. When the Royals scored the 3 year old will dance and cheer (she assumes anything blue is LA and asked all night where was Hanley, since it's her favorite player) and in SF we'd have people scream at us to calm the kid down or sit her ass down, so AT&T park isn't very fun at times, but here no hostility or any aggression. I felt safe and welcomed here with my niece and nephew and would go back.  Thank you Oakland for giving the kids a positive baseball experience!  ETA: Your intro video is gorgeous and I LOVE when teams celebrate their history and your new screens are lovely!"

My 3yr old will not sit for the game and my wife hates sports so I am hoping she can take the kids off to entertain them.

OaklandAthletics,3b8njx,GaryTheJerk,2,Fri Jun 26 21:28:25 2015 UTC,"I saw him play for the Sonoma Stompers a couple weeks ago (same league, and also vs the Pacifics). Definitely fun to watch! Would have hit a home run, but it's 435 to center field in Sonoma. Definitely fun to watch! https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/35214379/IMG_20150612_194307_212-1re.jpg"
OaklandAthletics,3b8njx,orderfoodhere,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:15:57 2015 UTC,"On Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, Jose Canseco was in the Bay Area to play independent ball with the Pittsburg Diamonds (CC Times article here. There was a home run derby before the third and final game on Thursday, so we chose to go to that one.  The home run derby started at about 5:30 and went three rounds. Along with Canseco, a couple other people that participated were the mayor of Pittsburg, Aaron Miles who used to play for the Cardinals (he's also player/manager with the Pacifics) and someone who played for the Dodgers for 10 seasons whose name I can't remember. Canseco hit 2 or 3 home runs in the first round (which ended up being just enough to qualify,) 5 in the second round (more than anyone) and 1 in the finals (he lost to the Pittsburg High baseball coach.)  Jose started signing autographs and taking pictures with fans after his first at bat (they had a table set up by the Diamonds dugout.) Autographs and pictures were free.  In the 4th inning Jose got a pitch way up and in and said something to the pitcher. Someone from the Pacifics dugout yelled at him, Jose yelled back then threw his bat down and headed for their dugout. The benches cleared but it didn't look like much happened other than a bunch of yelling (we were waiting in line for his autograph so it was kinda hard to see exacly what was happening.) I figured it was just for show, but a guy that was there for all three games said they were giving him chin music the entire series. He was pretty animated when he got back to the dugout (a lot of ""what the hell?"" type gesturing) and when he came back he didn't look happy. He was no longer taking pictures with people and was just rushing through the autographs without even looking up, a complete 180 from when he was signing a couple innings earlier.  The Diamonds won 2-0, their pitcher (I think his name was Neal) threw a shutout and Canseco went 0-3 with two strikeouts. I believe he went 0-3 in the first game of the series and 3-5 in the second.  All in all we had a good time and it was nice to finally get Canseco's autograph (I could never get his at the games when I was a kid.) It's a much nicer park than I would have expected (it's right across the street from the Mar Ray for those of you familiar with the area.) The snack bar had pizza from a local place that was pretty good and I was surprised to see that they served beer Unlike the pro games, they didn't stop serving in the 7th... In fact, they lowered the price from $7 to $5 in the 7th (I don't know if they do this all the time or what.) Anyway, the tickets for the Canseco games were $15, but I think tickets for most games are only $5, and if that's the case I'm sure we'll be back."

OaklandAthletics,3b8z0l,SmugglingGrapes,6,Sat Jun 27 04:53:40 2015 UTC,I thought they might be discussing the game but every comments seems to be  Fuck the raiders  Fuck brett lawrie  A's fans are classless
OaklandAthletics,3b8z0l,ajayoda,9,Sat Jun 27 04:44:20 2015 UTC,What thread are you reading? Because that's not what's going on in the thread at all...also what are jokes
OaklandAthletics,3b8z0l,Drgntrnr,-3,Sat Jun 27 04:54:35 2015 UTC,was in there the entire game.  that was primarily what was being said
OaklandAthletics,3b8z0l,ajayoda,2,Sat Jun 27 05:40:37 2015 UTC,Top comments but they always seem to be moving around so maybe i looked at a bad time. And brett lawrie eating BBQ at an applebees is taking it too far
OaklandAthletics,3b8z0l,Worthyness,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:11:30 2015 UTC,Dunno how they managed to get such shitty fans. Haven't seen that from other teams in a long time.
OaklandAthletics,3b8z0l,emaw63,5,Sat Jun 27 04:47:49 2015 UTC,I think they just hate Oakland especially because of the raiders.
OaklandAthletics,3b8z0l,Worthyness,2,Sat Jun 27 04:58:44 2015 UTC,It happens when your team starts winning after more than a decade of mediocrity.
OaklandAthletics,3b8z0l,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:50:53 2015 UTC,Decade of mediocrity is a really nice way to describe 3 decades of being the worst team in baseball
OaklandAthletics,3b8z0l,ajayoda,6,Sat Jun 27 05:01:30 2015 UTC,"well I did say more than a decade of mediocrity, so i was technically correct."
OaklandAthletics,3b8z0l,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,7,Sat Jun 27 05:05:43 2015 UTC,Lawrie is being mentioned over there so much he's getting All-Star votes.
OaklandAthletics,3b8z0l,EpicDawg,0,Sat Jun 27 04:47:29 2015 UTC,In their mindset they should vote lawrie to injure the nl players. Especially MadBum
OaklandAthletics,3b8z0l,Worthyness,4,Sat Jun 27 04:54:43 2015 UTC,"One of them was criticizing the stadium lights. Like bro, I don't bring up your hot mold dogs."
OaklandAthletics,3b8z0l,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,5,Sat Jun 27 04:42:15 2015 UTC,Of course our bullpen is lights out with a 4 run deficit.
OaklandAthletics,3b8z0l,LibertarianSocialism,2,Sat Jun 27 04:37:16 2015 UTC,That's a pretty good plus.

OaklandAthletics,3b8z0l,DocCalculus,5,Sat Jun 27 03:50:04 2015 UTC,They're just saving the runs for a walk off guys. it's fine.
OaklandAthletics,3b8z0l,Raidenbobalay,4,Sat Jun 27 03:46:37 2015 UTC,"Oh man, I watched that youtube compilation of all the walkoffs that got posted earlier today. It was so good; I was just sitting here with a gigantic grin. I would be very happy if that happened today."
OaklandAthletics,3b8z0l,Worthyness,4,Sat Jun 27 03:50:00 2015 UTC,So when do the specially trained attack giraffes come out and slaughter the Royals? I thought that was the whole reason we agreed to play them at home.
OaklandAthletics,3b8z0l,Raidenbobalay,5,Sat Jun 27 03:43:21 2015 UTC,"I believe it's spelled ""seagull"", but yeah, someone clearly forgot to sprinkle the pretzel crumbs in the visiting dugout."
OaklandAthletics,3b8z0l,SmugglingGrapes,5,Sat Jun 27 03:47:34 2015 UTC,Yippie. Of course we're going to shit the bed when the Royals come to town. I really don't wanna hear it from their fanbase.
OaklandAthletics,3b8z0l,Raidenbobalay,5,Sat Jun 27 03:42:34 2015 UTC,"And to be fair, the lineup we rolled out is terrible. Kinda shows off the impact Billy Burns/having a great leadoff hitter can do for your team."

OaklandAthletics,3b8z0l,Raidenbobalay,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:55:44 2015 UTC,I'm pretty zen about it.  They'll get what's coming to them.
OaklandAthletics,3b8z0l,EpicDawg,9,Sat Jun 27 04:00:40 2015 UTC,"We can always just remind them that WE were able to beat the giants in the world series, but they weren't."
OaklandAthletics,3b8z0l,Raidenbobalay,4,Sat Jun 27 03:46:46 2015 UTC,Zing
OaklandAthletics,3b8z0l,Worthyness,2,Sat Jun 27 03:49:06 2015 UTC,Look at that fashionista. I kinda want that hat.
OaklandAthletics,3b8z0l,Raidenbobalay,3,Sat Jun 27 03:40:36 2015 UTC,I think Fosse forgot to charge up his Sonny gnome for tonight.
OaklandAthletics,3b8z0l,JeSuisAmiralAckbar,6,Sat Jun 27 03:38:52 2015 UTC,CSN shows painful memories way too much for my liking.
OaklandAthletics,3b83o8,powereater,9,Fri Jun 26 18:57:33 2015 UTC,"No one on either team has forgotten what happened, but I'm sure both managers are telling them to go out and play some good, clean baseball."
OaklandAthletics,3b83o8,beerandmetal420,4,Fri Jun 26 19:00:37 2015 UTC,"that's what happened when baltimore came last year. I was there for that first game a and a lot of people had manny face cutouts with a image of a pacifier in his mouth. (PS: J.D hit a 3 run HR in the 9th to get the walk off win. ""HAS HE DONE IT!? HE HAS!!!""- Glenn)  I'm looking forward to what A's fan's will bring/do tonight. Going to a series like this when another team was being bad sports is more exciting then a regular baseball game. The collective booing is great."
OaklandAthletics,3b83o8,Fire2box,5,Fri Jun 26 19:15:48 2015 UTC,"I was at that Orioles game. For my money, that was probably the most exciting game I've been to. We stayed out there celebrating for like 20 minutes. I really wanted to go tonight; alas, I have a date."
OaklandAthletics,3b83o8,NightWriter500,2,Fri Jun 26 19:29:29 2015 UTC,I'm hoping my friend wants to go on sunday Breakfast bowl day and Chavez is the probable pitcher.
OaklandAthletics,3b83o8,Fire2box,3,Fri Jun 26 19:42:00 2015 UTC,JD was a walk off HR hitting robot
OaklandAthletics,3b83o8,DontSayNoToPills,5,Fri Jun 26 21:12:27 2015 UTC,"Any player from either side would be stupid to re-kindle this shit. It's been two months, let it go."
OaklandAthletics,3b83o8,kah-boom,3,Fri Jun 26 19:44:07 2015 UTC,Agreed. I need a break from hockey
OaklandAthletics,3b83o8,harriswill,2,Fri Jun 26 21:06:19 2015 UTC,let it go   Paging Disney gif guy
OaklandAthletics,3b83o8,mydoingthisright,8,Fri Jun 26 23:07:18 2015 UTC,Ventura's on the DL and isn't travelling with the team.  He's actually throwing a minor league rehab start in Omaha tonight.  So that's one less hothead we have to worry about.
OaklandAthletics,3b83o8,JohnnySteel,2,Fri Jun 26 20:07:35 2015 UTC,I expect this to be a calm series between the two teams.
