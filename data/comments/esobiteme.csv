esobiteme,3daab8,DirrtyBeans,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:20:46 2015 UTC,I personally think paying for someone to bite you isnt worth it. The only reason someone should charge for this is if they plan to use it on a friend soon but theyre willing to wait if you pay them.
esobiteme,3daab8,shadeofmyth,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:50:50 2015 UTC,"i have already bit all my friends and thats why i said im willing to make a deal, he doesnt have to pay me in all gold, i will accept gold and trades, if he wants to pay me then that is his choice. Its a game mechanic, like using the guild stores."

esobiteme,3d7kkw,Blackbriar41571,3,Tue Jul 14 03:23:45 2015 UTC,Anyone that charges is a scammer IMO.
esobiteme,3d7kkw,cremeegg88,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:22:12 2015 UTC,actually .. anyone who sells there bite for free is stupid .. too much work to get a bite and wayyyy too much work to even rank it to level 6 to bite people ... that labor should be paid for if you want a  bite ...
esobiteme,3d7kkw,queenromantic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:42:29 2015 UTC,Unless you paid then its all whether or not you got lucky. There is work to get to 6 but not much. I'd rather give put for free as I have with wolf otherwise I'm taking money for doing nothing basically plus all it encourages is scammers.
esobiteme,3d7kkw,cremeegg88,2,Wed Jul 15 20:45:16 2015 UTC,Hah! I knew that assholes shenanigans would catch up to her!

esobiteme,3d7kkw,queenromantic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:41:45 2015 UTC,Completely unrelated to you being a piece of shit here. You'd never use the N word in real life because you'd get the shit slapped out of your mouth if not worse. All this troll/shit talk doesn't change the fact that your fucking pathetic and that people are wising up to your bullshit. Get the fuck outta here shitstain.
esobiteme,3d7kkw,skeeber,0,Thu Jul 16 08:57:47 2015 UTC,lol im black .. why would I get the shit slapped out my mouth ?
esobiteme,3d7kkw,queenromantic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:39:37 2015 UTC,Yeah uh huh. You just say that to cover your own ass. Even if that was the truth that would mean your just reinforcing a stereotype of your ethnic group. You should be super proud of yourself for that.
esobiteme,3d7kkw,skeeber,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:53:20 2015 UTC,nigga even mean black it means ignorant ... which accordingly is what your showing .... gtfoh
esobiteme,3d7kkw,queenromantic,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:28:54 2015 UTC,I'm well aware that it means ignorant as well. I don't need some wanna be ghetto hood rat piece of shit to inform me of that. Don't like what I just said? Don't give me reason to assume that of you by how you talk. Reading the ignorant shit that you come up with gives me a fucking migraine.

esobiteme,3cvscx,SeriouslySeriousGuy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:44:58 2015 UTC,"Props to you for organizing a guild to help people out! As a former member of three different bite/scratch guilds, i can attest to the large scale of work they are to run and keep track of the order of bites. Out of the three i was a part of, only one had people active enough to actually pass the bites along, and after waiting for several weeks i decided to leave.  Just like so many i spent weeks camping the spawn points only to have the mob slaughtered by an legion of hunters right in front of me.   Once i got sick of wasting countless hours trying to acquire the vampire skill line i stumbled upon esobiteme and forked up the money i knew i would earn back the second i hit leveled up my skill to rank 6 (which only took one day!).  Esobiteme was created to take most of the risk out of purchasing a bite. Unfortunately there are a lot of scammers out there taking people money, but if you ask me those people generally are asking to have their money taken. Did you pay someone who was ""selling"" a bite in area chat? If you found it on esobiteme is it a new throwaway reddit account, or has the person been active for years? Is the person a low level in eso? Your probably going to get scammed. Ask for a screen shot, or proof that they have sold it successfully to someone else on esobiteme (a post link with confirmation).  With ESO guilds having a max population of 500 people, and only being able to pass one bite per gifted player per week, i don't see how the bite economy is going to change any time soon. Guilds will form, but with so many new players starting up and alts being created every day there will always be a large population of people who don't want to wait for spawn timers or wait for their turn in a queue.   It is easy to farm 10-20k gold at a high spawn location by looting everything and selling the drops. At the Rift i find on average two legendary items per hour and sell them in chat or guild trader for 2-10k.   I do think it is awesome that you are building a community within the game with the intention to help others at no charge, but do not believe in any way it will effect the price of bites. You are paying for the convenience of the bite, be it 5k or 20k. There will always be people with little time to farm spawns or actively wait for a queue. Bite guilds are not a new idea, and with 60,000 people playing on ps4, a 500 person guild is less than 1% of the population.  TL DR; props for being eager to help people! Keep in mind bite guilds have been around as long as the game itself. Guilds have a max population of 500 members, PS4 has a current population of about 60,000 players... the price of bites isn't going down any time soon. It's the price of convenience."
esobiteme,3cvscx,Lavlamp,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:01:52 2015 UTC,"I wish I could take credit for managing the whole guild but I'm just an officer.  Also, the prices won't go down with that attitude! ;p"
esobiteme,3cvscx,Xellos77,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:08:30 2015 UTC,Being an officer is managing lol. :P
esobiteme,3cvscx,Xellos77,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:38:35 2015 UTC,Well I kind of meant starting up the original idea... -.-
esobiteme,3cvscx,Agent-Shanth-Fenrich,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:48:21 2015 UTC,"I think the bigger point here is in regard to scammers, not sellers. People can buy and sell as they please. Players can scam and treat others like crap as they please (because, anonymity). We are a buffer between the two and don't think it'll change anything large-scale. That's unreasonable. What is reasonable is lending a hand and making someone's day after they've been scammed for the 3rd time this week for 30k.  The money may not be a big deal long term, but it still creates a consistency of toxicity regarding the community in the person's mind.  Again, we are that buffer. We may not touch anywhere near 1,000 players, or even a couple hundred. However, those we have helped are happy and so are we in having the opportunity to meet some fantastic people.  We certainly aren't a new concept but we are here now and accessible.  By the way Krazzle is a bit off.. we are about 2 weeks old and as of today about 70 bites have gone out, all free of charge or hassle. That's 70 people who are smiling and avoiding dealing with scammers :-)"
esobiteme,3cvscx,jewmonkey65,1 point,Sun Jul 12 00:36:12 2015 UTC,"Not sure how I feel about the idea that bites shouldn't be paid for?  Why not?  How are bites any different than material or any other drop that happens and people sell for?  Should players not sell rare drops from boss encounters because it's a mechanic to get those drops from the boss?  I understand and respect that people shouldn't get scammed, and people shouldn't kill spawns on purpose, but the idea of paying for something you don't want to waste time on trying to get, or the idea of selling something that isn't readily available doesn't seem crazy to me."

esobiteme,3cwq3x,Spacebearz,2,Sat Jul 11 12:57:25 2015 UTC,"There's a few out there. You just have to find one for your system, server and possibly alliance.  If you're interested, it's not difficult to start one, just a little slow going while you gather wolves. Once you have a few then it gets a lot quicker since one can bite another who bites another and so on."
esobiteme,3cwq3x,xxxJakkxxx,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:15:11 2015 UTC,Thanks for the idea. I'll get a few of my friends and create one if not we'll join a guild. How's the best way to locate a guild as such? Reddit or within the game? Or do you think just going to the shrine and and biting people randomly would work better because then you don't get people making silly rules such as this or that etc?
esobiteme,3cwq3x,Aradilyn,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:46:20 2015 UTC,I've got one on DC :) only a few members but growing I think you should make it the more guilds the less scammers .  P.s pick a catchy name mines fangs for free
esobiteme,3cwq3x,Aradilyn,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:05:11 2015 UTC,Could we do a cross where people seeking bites etc can be directed to an appropriate place.  It's just for bites nothing else.  No crowns. No cold etc. Just to pass on a great ability. If people want to donate they can but it's not important. I want share the joys of the game I've been given with other players as I think that's how it should be. Fucks the scammres.

Obviously people who are biting can easily be scammed from jerks that get bitten and run off. It's really just a risk people have to take if they wish to charge. I don't bother with charging because I don't feel like being scammed. I've found people give me gold or items even if bite them for free.

People are getting scammed left and right by having to pay thousands of gold for a bite only to have the ""Biter"" run off with the gold. And some of these other guilds are making people deposit thousands of gold in the guild bank before they offer up the bite. Everyone check out Fang Bang, you're only requirement is to give back your first bite only. However, I plan on continuing to further the cause. Let's end the scamming. Join Fang Bang today."

It will be quite some time before you get your bite ready! You may not see it for at least another 20+ levels. I'd advise grinding mobs and running dungeons until then. Questing will be too slow to see results and you'll encounter more fire damage further slowing you down. I'm on AD XB1 as well, if you need any gear crafted as you level, hmu. I have a toon that can craft all alliance race styled armor and weapons across clothing, blacksmithing and woodworking with a decent trait selection too."

Spot south/southwest of Ebonheart in a little quest area where Dreugh and covenant mobs continuously spawn. Some just use the werewolf quest area because you always stay in werewolf form.. but the enemies don't spawn as fast.  Helping to level werewolf is really unneeded and you will rank up based on kills in wolf form. Now vampire, on the other hand, that's experience based so help wouldn't be hurtful there."
