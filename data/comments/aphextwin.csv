aphextwin,3e0tja,addking,9,Tue Jul 21 02:12:59 2015 UTC,"Come To Daddy EP  Released on Warp in 1997. Two 12"" or CD singles and alternately available as a CD EP compliation.   Come To Daddy (Pappy Mix): Richard's Industrial Rock Piss-take. The joke is not lost on me, even tho I enjoy it.   Flim: A pretty melodic piece on par with RDJ's best bits.   Come To Daddy (Little Lord Faulteroy Mix): Not a remix at all, but another track, with some twisted vocals. There is just a hint of noise creeping in the track undermining the sweetness.  Bucephalus Bouncing Ball: Reminding me a bit of my first exposure to Autechre, it's effectively sound effects and beats.  But the presentation and playful experimentation are solid.   To Cure A Weakling Child (Contour Regard): Remix of the track from the RDJ album, sharing certain bits from the original but it's fairly different.   Funny Little Man: A subdued track, with mixed in samples of distorted voice mostly repeating the title phrase. Ends with a bit of disturbing cut-up dialog.    Come To Daddy (Mummy Mix):Another non-remix with a couple great voice samples ""You've got so many machines Richard"" and ""Come on, give us a snare rush..."" it's sort of similiar in nature to Buchephalus - in that it's playful but still experimental for most of the track. There's less 'song' here in a pop sense.   IZ-US:A young child implores us to ""stop making that big face"", and then RDJ drops this beauty of a track. Keyboards over a  mostly relaxed trip-hop like beat, and containing a few background notes that feel like their moving in slow motion."
aphextwin,3e0tja,EamonnMR,7,Tue Jul 21 02:13:34 2015 UTC,"Concentrated greatness. Totally worth a listen all the way through. I might be in the minority here, but I actually like Pappy Mix. The voice effects are interesting (I think he EQs it differently on each repeat), ""Come To Daddy"" is a genuinely creepy line, and the music prefigures what we'll hear on Drukqs. Then, after his most brutal drill'n'bass track, he drops his most sublime-Film. That song actually got me into Aphex Twin, it's the jingle for a local NPR show. I still think it's one of his best tracks, like another attempt at 4. The rest of the album toes the line between creepy and adorable (much like MfM) with Bucephalus Bouncing Ball sounding as new and modern as it must have in the 90s. IZ-US is the closest we get to an ambient track. Mummy Mix sounds like an unfinished Drukuqs track."
aphextwin,3e0tja,MyNameIsPraxin,5,Tue Jul 21 02:28:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly Pappy Mix is one of my fav tracks he's ever done, that screaming section is just absolutely fucking insane."
aphextwin,3e0tja,TheAmbiguity,3,Tue Jul 21 02:39:59 2015 UTC,"Right before he starts screaming on Come to Daddy, there's a few chords that are distorted and it would be the... sixth chord, the distortion on that is absolutely insane. I wish I could, instead of just clipping the peaks, fuzz absolutely everything. It's kinda magical to me."
aphextwin,3e0tja,Matafoqana,3,Tue Jul 21 15:33:00 2015 UTC,Goosebumps every. single. time!
aphextwin,3e0tja,0rangento,5,Tue Jul 21 20:19:19 2015 UTC,"Bucephalus Bouncing Ball is the standout track for me. I really like the metallic sound pallet used and the transitions sound like they fit even though one section is a contrast to another. I only wish that the last section, a cut up edit of the first, lasted longer because it really does put a smile on my face."
aphextwin,3e0tja,MyNameIsPraxin,4,Tue Jul 21 08:25:18 2015 UTC,"Considering 'Buccephalus Bouncing Ball' is the first track of his I ever heard (minus pac-man, but that doesn't count because I didn't know who he was back then) I might be a little biased by saying it's some of the best shit he's ever done. Sure it might be a little too experimental for some peoples tastes, it's still quite an accessible track up until the whole bouncing ball solo thing. Like I mentioned above, Pappy Mix is just pure energy and I love it, and 'Flim' and 'Iz-Us' are just, hnnngnnnngngg. This whole EP is just fucking brilliant, each track stands amazingly on its own, which some may consider a bad thing because there's no overarching 'theme'  tying everything together, I think is just a perfect example of how versatile and extremely talented of a musician RDJ is."

I've always loved this ep. From the craziness of pappy to the immediately jarring transition to flim. The wacky vocals in a few of the tracks and expert attention to detail in Bucephalus it's a great albeit strange set of songs to dive into. Also iz-us is one of the coolest tracks I've ever heard.

My uncle was a massive Aphex fan throughout the 90s, and when I was a young child (probably, 7-8), he would show me the Come to Daddy music video to scare the living shit out of me.

It appeared previously in the Polygon Window song My Teapot (which was mostly a musical track). The actual song would appear later as an ""exclusive"" in some magazine. Both the song and the prank later appeared as separate tracks in the soundcloud dump (Phlid 2 for the song and Shit Smothered for the prank).  Polygon Window - My Teapot is from the compilation album The Philosophy Of Sound And Machine 2. The first one was where ""Soit-P.P. - n.IASP"" and ""Q-Chastic - CAT 002"" are from.  As for the first 3 tracks on Analogue Bubblebath 3.1, they're just LP printings of some of the CD only tracks (AB3CD-09, AB3CD-13 and AB3CD-08). The wind and rain track is still a cd exclusive, and the 36 seconds of a random conversation are still a vinyl exclusive."

Phild did appear as a magazine exclusive on 'Secret Tracks 2' in 1994 - and while the soundcloud version doesn't appear any different (I have an Mp3 pre-soundcloud of it), it ALSO doesn't include any of the 'shit smothered' material.   I also don't know of any 36 seconds of random conversation on 3.1 either."
aphextwin,3dpkwo,WildBluntHickok,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:27:56 2015 UTC,"The 36 second conversation one is track 3 from the vinyl version of Analogue Bubblebath 3 (at least the 1st printing has it).  As for the rest, I should've said Artificial Intelligence 2 (that is, the last album in the series that Surfing on Sine Waves is the second album in). But my copy is an mp3 and it's possible I could've had a mislabeled version all this time. It's DEFINITELY a different version of the song Phild, but mixing ""shit smothered"" in could've just been something that the person making the mp3 did to mess with people. I got it back in 1996 when mp3s were a new and novel thing (the mp3 format was invented in 1995). Same time I got Analogue Bubblebath 5 and all the other ""not available in stores"" albums.  So I need to get a full copy of Artificial Intelligence 2 and hear the unaltered version I guess. Sorry if I misinformed.  EDIT: btw I noticed some people who have the 2 peel sessions have the shit smothered track instead of Cunt. How anyone could believe that Richard got away with playing ""shit smothered"" on the radio is beyond me."

Even when searching for people who had the full album instead of just the one track I had to hunt for a bit to find someone who had the unaltered version. If anyone else is searching the mashup version seems to be 3:52 and the correct is 3:58. Obviously a fresh rip from vinyl can't be counted on to be a certain exact time, but hopefully 3:58 is correct for the cd at least."

aphextwin,3dkno2,raster_raster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:25:33 2015 UTC,"Usually he's playing the mixing board live. So some elements may mix into the song differently, or have a different effect, or there may be a new element if you're lucky. Or sometimes there's a new intro, or the song morphs into another song 2 minutes before it's supposed to end.  In the old days he used to do standard DJing (with vinyl records). In the really old days he was one of the few club djs to use cassettes."

Girl/Boy NLS Mix: same as the version on RDJ LP  Milkman: Longest and the most well known cut from the EP - is a charming melodic track about tired mornings and milk. And of course a bit of perverse wishing. It opens with some modulated voice work.  Inkey$: Warped sounds and high tempo percussion with ringing pings.  Girl/Boy (£18 Snare Rush Mix): Almost dubbed out version with snare beats, synth chords intstead of strings.  Beetles: Richard apparently singing about the beetles around his homestead, over a bit of chord-y synth.  Girl/Boy (Redruth Mix): Chiming xylophonic bits over a modified version of the normal tracks drums. Ends with some modulated voice talking."
aphextwin,3d4tv3,addking,6,Mon Jul 13 19:23:19 2015 UTC,"Ok... so my 1st exposure to Aphex Twin was the Girl/Boy Song on MTVs Amp Compilation. Up until that point... I hated electronic music.  I thought it was all Repetitive, Obnoxious, and contained annoying pitched up vocals, and people saying ""James Brown... Is Dead"".  A friend wanted to get me into ""electronica""... and we were listening to AMP in his moms car.  Girl/Boy Song came on... about 3 seconds plays... and he skipped to the next track.  I stopped him ""Wait... go back to that last one... it sounded like it was about to get interesting.""  He went back... The Strings came in, the Drums kicked in... and as a result... I'm an electronic music convert for life. Track changed my life.  Now 80% of the music I listen to is electronic.  At one point... he was FWB with a girl we both knew.  She knew that we were both into Aphex Twin... she knew that I loved Aphex Twin more... and specifically the Girl/Boy song.  But... because he was her FWB... when she found the Girl/Boy EP on vinyl... in a Record store that was going out of business... she bought it... and gave it to him.  And I've lusted after that Disc for years.  Recently he was sucked into a relationship with a succubus that drained him emotionally... and financially... and caused him to move apartments several times.  During his last move, he offered to sell me some of his records so he could get cash... and so we wouldn't have to move all of them. I bought Girl/Boy EP off of him.  My normal policy is... if a friend is strapped for cash... or depressed... and sells... or gives something to me out of depression... or desperation... I will always sell it/give it back to them for the same as I got it for.  And I have done that with him. But this disc is not going anywhere.    It's mine."

Parallel to the CD release of your new album, you’re releasing the same songs as maxi singles at 45 rpm. If you play them at 33 rpm, then this hectic, tense material becomes very relaxing and atmospheric. Is this a coincidence?  Many of my tracks are better if you play them at 33 rpm. I have never denied that. That’s also why my pieces are so short: you can only press them onto maxi singles if they are short at 45 rpm. If they go for too long, then they don’t fit onto the vinyl—and then you can’t play them slower. That’s also the real reason why my album ended up so short. Buy it on vinyl. Instead of 33 minutes, you actually get 45, you understand? And there you have it, an album of standard length."
aphextwin,3cz99p,jdoberman,3,Sun Jul 12 11:13:38 2015 UTC,"But this record was never pressed to 45 RPM so unless we're talking the Girl/Boy EP, RDJ was trolling.  But modern technology makes it possible."

aphextwin,3cz53z,SlateFx,6,Sun Jul 12 02:40:05 2015 UTC,"Aye, I didn't think he was on soundcloud, my bad.. is he user48736353001?"
aphextwin,3cz53z,michaelt4,11,Sun Jul 12 02:52:18 2015 UTC,Yes but he recently changed his Soundcloud name to user18081971. There are over 200 tracks on there free to download.
aphextwin,3cz53z,michaelt4,6,Sun Jul 12 03:11:30 2015 UTC,"Oh fucking sweet, thanks, sorry about the noob post, I'm a bit new to Aphex Twin."
aphextwin,3cz53z,WildBluntHickok,7,Sun Jul 12 06:01:25 2015 UTC,Don't worry about it :)
aphextwin,3cvv0h,Mynameisfez,24,Sat Jul 11 05:14:00 2015 UTC,"I wish I was able to see one of his late 90's concerts where he just kinda lay there on the ground with his laptop while a bunch of female body builders and people in the Donkey Rhubarb costumes dance around the stage, that looked like a hell of an experience."
aphextwin,3cvv0h,MyNameIsPraxin,21,Sat Jul 11 06:41:58 2015 UTC,I was at one of these shows. The girls had stilts on their arms and legs and wore spandex. They walked around like weird spiders.
aphextwin,3cvv0h,afxfan,13,Sat Jul 11 06:50:20 2015 UTC,That sounds amazing.
aphextwin,3cvv0h,MyNameIsPraxin,22,Sat Jul 11 07:02:35 2015 UTC,"Seen him live 4 times, all in Melbourne.  All vastly different.   He played a festival here called ""big day out"" twice about 15 years apart. First one with the dancing bears, who I swear had a punch-on on stage.   Most recent was around 2 years ago where his 3 hour set started so laid-back with even some slow hip hop style beats. It progressed through crazy to insane, then to cap it off, Ninja and Yolandi from Die Antwoord joined him to rap live over his final 30 minutes. I was reduced to a 40 year old screaming teenager at that stage.   Edit: my memory's returning - I think one of the bears (the most violent?) was local live acid legend Dave Habberfeld aka honeysmack. That goes more than half way to explain the on-stage madness!"
aphextwin,3cvv0h,icanucan,4,Sat Jul 11 09:00:10 2015 UTC,Heliospan (Japan 1997) something like this? The BDO concerts are in late jan/feb right? This show must have been from around the same time
aphextwin,3cvv0h,montageofheck,3,Sun Jul 12 01:31:56 2015 UTC,"Great find!!   This is like a polite Japanese version of what I saw. Where bears are bowing in this video, insert haymakers and bodyslams for the Melbourne BDO gig."
aphextwin,3cvv0h,icanucan,19,Sun Jul 12 03:05:42 2015 UTC,"Never been, but if a cellphone video can repeatedly give me goosebumps then I'm gonna guess that it's damn amazing."
aphextwin,3cvv0h,arandomshot,9,Sat Jul 11 06:19:26 2015 UTC,"Soooo fucking insane, I would give anything to be there, that tune is actually so much more intense live it seems, never heard something that gets me out of my chair so fast!"
aphextwin,3cvv0h,SlateFx,7,Sat Jul 11 09:55:06 2015 UTC,i was there :)
aphextwin,3cvv0h,acidkrn0,7,Sat Jul 11 15:57:57 2015 UTC,Oh god I love vordhosbn so much
aphextwin,3cvv0h,Need_a_Ladder,3,Sun Jul 12 01:41:37 2015 UTC,"I was about to go to sleep but now i'm hyped, that show looks so good."
aphextwin,3cvv0h,woogoogoo,16,Sun Jul 12 03:06:51 2015 UTC,its like being hugged by god and brain raped by the devil all at the same time
aphextwin,3cvv0h,acidkrn0,11,Sat Jul 11 15:58:49 2015 UTC,"Been to various festivals in Europe over the last 15 years, i saw him 4 times, Manchester, London, Eindhoven and one gig in Italy.   All were different not only in location and crowd, but also Richards mood i assume. The UK gigs seemed to be harder looking back now, totally acid.  The Eindhoven show had the goriest VX show running i ever saw, while he was hiding behind giant PA looking at his MacBook.  Videos of birth(!), mixed with i think what was footage of cosmetic surgery and what not.. All topped with a rotating and morphed AFX logo.  Everyone should get to see one of his shows once! Its like going to the church,  we just sitting on the floors smoking and watching the drugged guys spaz out.  Writing this gives me goosebumps!"
aphextwin,3cvv0h,kieselgurian,3,Sat Jul 11 14:57:54 2015 UTC,"I was there for the Eindhoven one! Actually, I was pretty disappointed about the set. I'm a huge fan and had hoped he would dig deeper into his own little world. Instead, the set was surprisingly straightforward. The gory video didn't do anything for me. I understand that it was probably for shock effect, but I didn't like it and it wasn't what I came there for."
aphextwin,3cvv0h,sentient_salami,2,Sun Jul 12 00:09:10 2015 UTC,You sure remember this moment: Mookid
aphextwin,3cvv0h,kieselgurian,9,Sun Jul 12 00:21:03 2015 UTC,"I have seen Aphex Twin twice, once around 2001/2002 and the next in 2012, both in Sydney.  The earlier gig was pretty mental, he emerged out of the crowd and climbed on stage, got a tiny Viao laptop out of his bag, plugged in and just blasted 2 hours of extreme hardcore acid noise. He gave a thumbs up at the end, and walked off.  The second gig he couldn't even really be seen. He was sandwiched smack in the middle of two visual projection screens, started with a hip hop sort of vibe, then progressed into stuff that was more akin to The Tuss. The set progressed into a more hardcore vibe then closed off with the most mental blaring of white noise and static visuals almost verging on giving the crowd epilepsy and prolapsed ear drums. It was fucking awesome."
aphextwin,3cvv0h,themodernritual,4,Sat Jul 11 14:13:02 2015 UTC,"I remember watching a full hour long set on YouTube that sounded similar to this, the quality was terrible but holy shit the last 20 minutes or so were so fucking intense. I'd give my fucking firstborn child to have been at that concert haha"
aphextwin,3cvv0h,MyNameIsPraxin,6,Sat Jul 11 22:47:08 2015 UTC,well he doesn't play any real concerts lately..they are more like DJ sets. But thats good too I reckon.
aphextwin,3cvv0h,rd1994,6,Sat Jul 11 08:10:23 2015 UTC,"I went to see a Rephlex Records night in 2003. The artists billed were Bogdan Raczynski, Astrobotnia and Cylob, plus 'DJ Rephlex Records'.  This was basically the first time I'd been to a club night, and, being young and inexperienced, I got there far too early, so it was me and maybe 10 other people. Standing at the bar, I look up and notice the guy next to me looks a lot like... no, it couldn't be? Oh shit... RDJ grabs his pint and walks over to the booth and starts DJing, as I stand there with my jaw on the floor (hey, I was young and starstruck).  I was then one of the very small audience who enjoyed the first hour of what was probably a 2 or 3 hour DJ set, before the crowds arrived. I think Grant from Rephlex DJd too.   So the atmosphere that time was probably quite unusual, as it was, at least initially, a tiny crowd dancing to AFX's DJ set. I couldn't really believe it. That was quite a good night."
aphextwin,3cvv0h,OneWeirdTrick,4,Mon Jul 13 00:12:19 2015 UTC,There are tons of his live sets on youtube and you can get a good idea what they are like.
aphextwin,3cvv0h,raster_raster,4,Sat Jul 11 20:54:19 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who wishes he would do a tour Nine Inch Nails style? Like no computers or dj equipment, just musical instruments. Even if it's 4 keyboards and a drumset. Richard and 4 session musicians reinterpreting his songs for 2 hours. Or maybe Richard and his reflex buddies. Tell Squarepusher he can play bass and he'd probably show up."
aphextwin,3cvv0h,WildBluntHickok,5,Sat Jul 11 22:24:12 2015 UTC,"I would rather see a show like the ones ive heard of where he's just sitting on a couch, that would just make me laugh.  the orchestra Alarm Will Sound has done several re-interpretations of his music"

aphextwin,3cttk4,VoltNine,17,Fri Jul 10 18:48:49 2015 UTC,"If ICBYD was where he left his contemporaries, RDJ Album is where he sped into the sunny Cornish horizon, looking back and giving a cheeky grin while leaving the world in awe and disbelief. This is, as a reviewer put it, pure electronic genius. Forgive me please for saying that ICBYD was better, I've had this album on repeat for the last few days in anticipation for this post and it is leaps and pounds ahead of Rich's 1994 efforts. Full of lush strings, jolting and thought-provoking rhythms and enough sophisticated playfulness to give the most jaded person a smile.  4 - The rolling snares instantly paint a picture of what this album is going to be about. Top melody on this track, and a vocal sample that never gets old. Sitting in his tank, getting a call from his Dad, when people ask me if this album is one of the best ever made, I tell them: ""..............................yep"" :D  Cornish Acid - Within the first 5 seconds the haunting pads easily invoke more emotion that other artists top efforts. First usage of the 303 in this track, and a jolting beat to keep you more than interested.  Peek 824545201 - This is a track that I've fallen in love with quite recently, which when you realize this came out 20 fucking years ago, you fully understand the power and longevity of Rich's music. The chorus sort of bit is really what makes the track for me, he takes the 303 and makes some really wicked alien acid line, a complete and logical evolution to what his counterparts were doing, and proof that he really was steps above the rest. I just wish he would take those jarring bouncing ball styled samples out, hurts the ears when loud in the earphones. Amazing tune regardless, the pads in the chorus bit are beyond sad, really emotional.   Fingerbib - Happiest track on the album by far, really genius melody with that lush square wave sound. Really great strings as well 2/3 way through the track. (2:30 onwards)  Carn Marth - Another great track, really jolting beat on this one but the acid lines combined with the super happy synth sounds in the end half make a joyous and super interesting track.   To Cure a Weakling Child - Rich using his own voice as an instrument, this track holds the same level of sophistication as any of the others, and really strikes you as a great achievement in melody, this really feels like a classical piece. I still prefer the remix on CTD though.   Goon Gumpas - I really want to stop calling tracks beautiful over and over, but this one is super emotive, no drums, just an instrumental track that really has a strong melancholy feel. Definitely top 3 of the album.  Yellow Calx - Lesser known track, very interesting to me, especial the percussion all the way through, sounds very jarring and unconventional but still compliments the melodies well.   Girl Boy Song - This is really the centerpiece of the album, and it is frankly a masterpiece. The strings + the deep bass at the beginning is simple but extremely effective, and the insane poly-rhythms in this track really showcased RDJ's insane skill. The way the track progresses is also really well thought out, and I love those 1 or 2 moments when the drums suddenly ""fill out"" the stereo field, only happens rarely but is super detailed and easy to miss. Also love the triangle sounds or whatever that is, really compliments the melody well. SHAMELESS PLUG TIME (https://soundcloud.com/slatefx/girl-boy-1/s-xijEa) I recreated the start of this track using a chopped up Amen Break and some synths in Ableton, tell me what you think. :)  Logan Witch Rock - Really ""funny"" track, love the crazy childish sounds but the melodies are nothing to be laughed at, real clever stuff happening with melody and the menacing sub-bass. Reminds me of Serious Sam, which isn't a bad thing because that game was awesome.   Milkman - Explicit vocals mixed with some of RDJ's classic melodies and breakbeats, Ill take that on the go please! Funny track but shouldn't be underestimated. If anyone hasn't seen David Firths accompanying video they should check it out :)  Inkey$ - One of the weaker tracks but I guess as it was on the Girl Boy EP it shouldn't be held to as much of a high standard, wish there was more melodic elements in this track though, its pretty inaccessible, reminds me of Autechre.   Girl, Boy (18 Snare Rush Mix) - Much more laidback and melodic, I prefer this track to the last, it really has some great stuff going on, the ending has some intricate percussion that shouldn't be underestimated.  Beetles - He really impressed me with this one. Early on I never really thought much of this track, but when I downloaded the MIDI I really realised how clever he could write his melodies and have them on throwaway B-Side tracks (dont shoot me). A very good track, easily my favourite track on the EP. The vocals really make the track, I love the dispute between what people think he says, check the beginning letter of each sentence to find out some truth.   Girl,Boy (Redruth Mix) - Fun little closer, nice jarring beats with a catchy melody, nothing overly special about this track but a nice one to finish the album on. Love the re-sampling he does around a third of the way in, great technique that really gives his music a human feel.  TOP 3: 1. 4 2. Goon Gumpas 3. Peek 824545201  Overall, nothing much more needs to be said than 10/10. I feel so god-damn lucky that we get this complete genius with modern, flawless sound design and crisp mastering, meaning this album will always feel fresh and never dated, this truly will be amazing for as long as music exists."

aphextwin,3cttk4,SlateFx,8,Sat Jul 11 09:02:51 2015 UTC,"RDJ LP: Richard's namesake LP, brings together a bunch of elements he'd touched on before but focused in tighter arrangements and using less layered effects. The results are beautiful and taunt, clean, sparse tracks.   4: From the opening of the track, you have a two of the albums hallmarks- strings & glitched out sounding breakbeats. This track is a great example of great melodies over a solid beat.  Cornish Acid: Drums, pads and acid lines.   Peek 8245455201: Another really glitchy, sounding track, this time with some noise washes and some synths. Has a nice slowing effect outro.  Fingerbib: A quite jolly melody over a straight forward beat for the main part, and a string heavy break.  Carn Marth: Breakbeats, acid lines, and some interesting jittery effects on the sounds used here, ends in a bit of spasm.  To Cure A Weakling Child: The repeated childlike refrain sits over some clicking percussive elements and has an descending keyboard part.   Goon Gumpas: Upbeat strings float about, joined by a bit of bass and a toylike keyboard.  Yellow Calx: Some non-standard percussion sounding almost like metal straining, and some clanks and bangs is contrasted vs some chordal synth work.   Girl/Boy Song: Plucked strings and skittering beats form the base of this beauty of a track.  Logan Rock Witch: Childlike slide whistles, boinging noises and clock like clicking run against a church organ and some other synths.   ---Appending On the Girl/Boy EP---- (Girl/Boy NLS Mix - same as the version on RDJ LP)  Milkman: Longest and the most well known cut from the EP - is a charming melodic track about tired mornings and milk. And of  course a bit of perverse wishing. It opens with some modulated voice work.   Inkey$: Warped sounds and high tempo percussion with ringing pings.    Girl/Boy (£18 Snare Rush Mix): Almost dubbed out version with snare beats, synth chords intstead of strings.   Beetles: Richard apparently singing about the beetles around his homestead, over a bit of chord-y synth.  Girl/Boy (Redruth Mix): Chiming xylophonic bits over a modified version of the normal tracks drums. Ends with some modulated  voice talking."
aphextwin,3cttk4,addking,10,Fri Jul 10 22:34:17 2015 UTC,"Yellow Calx.  Mmmmmmmmmffff.  I once DJ'd a set at some friends' party where they placed a stripper pole (conveniently about 20 feet away from the DJ booth) for anybody that wanted to get sexy on it. As soon as I dropped this track, I ran to the pole and delivered the most intimate pole dance of my life (I'm a lady, btw). To me, this piece has a natural build that feels so like the buildup and release of an intense orgasm. After the song's ""release"" at the 2'30"" mark, a few lip bites, and a lot of slow and purposeful self-caressing, I ran back to the booth to finish the set.  tl;dr: Yellow Calx is my prime mastubation track."
aphextwin,3cttk4,Hjmby,6,Sat Jul 11 01:23:08 2015 UTC,"That's, um, an interesting description. I'm never going to be able to hear the noise section around 2:07 the same ever again."
aphextwin,3cttk4,MyNameIsPraxin,6,Sat Jul 11 01:45:54 2015 UTC,"I had a ton of notes written down about the album on my laptop and I'd been listening to this album on repeat for WEEKS just preparing something to say when this discussion came around, but I can't for the life of me find them and I only really remember specific parts of it. Sucks because not only was this the first Aphex Twin album I heard all the way through, it's probably the most standout 'main' album he's ever put out and deviates almost completely from his previous material.   Also its pretty sad to think we're nearly half way through these discussions already, I'm glad we stuck to the bi-weekly format though because we probably would have finished up months ago if we kept doing them daily haha"
aphextwin,3cttk4,MyNameIsPraxin,5,Fri Jul 10 23:04:16 2015 UTC,I don't think I would have been able to keep up doing them daily. 2x a week is pretty decent to get time to sit and actually listen and take notes.
aphextwin,3cttk4,addking,7,Sat Jul 11 00:05:52 2015 UTC,"First that big face-- That deep, angry / happy grin. It's terrifying and hilarious and there is no better album cover for the tracks behind it.  4 - Crazy drums, a beautiful synth melody, then... is that violin? The album starts off and blows my mind instantly. On first listen, I didn't understand what I was hearing. I remember getting lost in this song right away and thinking, ""this is future music."" Fast forward 19 years, I play it on my way to work and it still sounds so fresh and unique. Still feels ahead of it's time.  Cornish Acid - It goes dark. Bouncy and strange and mysterious. Like I'm investigating some crime in a different dimension. Drippy Acid Noir. Squint my eyes and I imagine using telepathy to help a robot solve a puzzle.  Peek 824545301 - Clicky, dial tone...The start of this track is where anyone who happened to be listening with me at the time would ask what the hell is going on, but then that badass change up happens at 0:45 and I reel them back in for a minute before it gets crazy again. This tracks does get harsh, but it fits on this album, a nice build up to ...  Fingerbib - Got to be the best song on the album. The paper tears in half at the beginning and then sheds a giant tear. It unleashes this lush waterfall of synthy piano, married with a simple beat... then other wordly/warbly bit comes in and I forget I'm listening to music and get lost in his realm. THEN the change up comes in at 1:19 and the song gets even better. Never stops exploding my headspace. I love RDJs simple melodies, but when he blends a bunch of them together, he can really make something special and this song is IT. I felt so cool listening to this song in college. I feel amazing listening to it now. This song heels me. Thank you, Richard.  Carn Marth - RDJ snaps you out of dream time and makes you stand up with this track. All senses at attention. There is no dance invented for the movement this song makes your body want to do. I LOVE how it starts breaking down at 1:17, but feels like it's building UP. It IS building up. Up and over and up and over and keeps spilling over until the machine gun ending that feels like buildings being destroyed and cars trying to escape Earthquake City. Hell fuck yeah.  To Cure a Weakling Child - So nice on this album. The beats on this track stand out big time. On 1st listen-- another one of those, ""how the fuck is he making this shit?"" moments. I still don’t know. The simple child voice glues this track together nicely and makes it friendly. I fell in love with this track all over again when I heard this acoustic cover by Adem: You need to def check it out if you haven’t heard it.  Goon Gumpas - A moment to breath after the intensity of the first 6 tracks. I love it's silly, lullaby simplicity. Fun, happy, peaceful.  Yellow Calx - Fav of all his Calx tracks! Love the drums and the quick work of this cool progression. Love how it finishes into this crispy meadow. Beautiful, haunting, warm.  Girl/Boy Song - Goddamn this album is SO good. This track. Right. here! Genius piece of work. Song title makes it hard for me not think of the 2 genders interacting when the soft pretty sounds get juxtaposed with the raw drums and back and forth like they're having a fight or falling in love. Good / Evil / Love / Hate / Etc-- All spilling and twisting to the dramatic finale.  Logan Rock Witch – Voodoo, slide whistle church music. Perfect end to the album, but I had no idea this was the finish at the time. I had the non-UK version that tagged on the last 5 tracks. But I guess those'll get covered Monday.  TLDR - Besides some random tunes, this album was basically my introduction to Aphex Twin. I don’t remember buying the CD, but I did in 1996 and it changed my life. It became a reference point on how I perceived all music going forward. I've been following this thread just to post when we got to this point."
aphextwin,3cttk4,energyface,5,Sat Jul 11 01:00:28 2015 UTC,"Wicked review man, really well described :)"
aphextwin,3cttk4,SlateFx,6,Sat Jul 11 02:48:11 2015 UTC,"This is the most important album in all of Rich's discography for me, because this is the album that made his work ""click"" for me. Before Richard D. James Album I had tried listening to various songs because I'd heard how renowned Aphex Twin was, but I never liked anything other than ""Xtal"", ""Tha"", and ""Windowlicker"". ""4"" changed that, and the rest of the album opened my mind to the depth and beauty of his work.   1) 4 - Easily the standout track of the album, and one of my favorite songs of all time. The drums are catchy, driving you forward through the song, while the synths and strings carry you along with their elegant duet. There's an emotional depth to it, a sort of somber joy.  2) Cornish Acid - Take ""4"" and add some Acid and you have this track. The drums still push you through the track, but the synths are now alien squiggles, and the strings have been replaced by a haunting synth that strikes a slight unease into you as you admire its beauty. I didn't care for this track for some time, and while I still consider it one of the weaker tracks on the album, I found a new appreciation for it after my musical tastes expanded.   3) Peek 824545201 - This cheery tune just dances along, injecting some levity after ""Cornish Acid"". There's some interesting Glitch influence here that Rich experiments with, yet it doesn't feel the slightest bit out of place with the rest of the album.   4) Fingerbib - This winsome track is often considered one of Rich's most beautiful, and for good reason. It's flighty and delicate, with another synth/string duo whisking us away.   5) Carn Marth - This odd track has another go at the Acid/Drum 'N' Bass style first visited in ""Cornish Acid"", and I think it's more successful at it. The drums are more interesting, the synths are more pleasing, and there's a better sense of progression. The synths in the beginning (if that's what they are) are rather reminiscent of a carnival, which serves as a nice setup for ""Logon Rock Witch"" to call back to later.   6) To Cure A Weakling Child - Another standout track, the synths in this track are as catchy as they are gorgeous, and the drums are complex and stimulating. There's a fantastic drum solo near the middle of the song that takes you by surprise because Rich subtly weans off the drums in anticipation of it. And that sample of the speaking is manipulated perfectly into the song. An overall great track, i don't think it gets enough attention.   7) Goon Gumpas - It's not that much shorter than the other tracks on the album, but it feels like a short interim between two ""actual"" songs. I've rapidly realised I don't know enough synonyms for ""beauty"", but there's no other way to describe this track. The plucked strings, the lush strings, the crying synthesizer, it's just an exquisitely pretty track.   8) Yellow Calx - I love everything about the intro to this song. The way it builds, the way the different noises play off each other, it's sublime. I also love how it subverts the previous tracks and brings the drums to the forefront while the slightly muted synths occupy the background for the majority of the song, until they come back in full force. My second favorite track off the album.   9) Girl/Boy Song - This is the song everyone talks about, and for good reason. Richard effortlessly weaves together sweeping strings and relentless drums that perfectly contrast each other without ever becoming cacophonous. It's a technical masterpiece, and a joy to listen to. If any track on this album competes with ""4"" for the top spot, this is it. I know I just called ""Yellow Calx"" my second favorite from the album, but this song is so good it's making me rethink that opinion. I hate ranking things anyway.  10) Logon Rock Witch - It wouldn't be a Richard D. James album without his characteristic sense of humour, so here we get a carnivalesque track with acid squiggles and a church organ mixed in for good measure. It's quite the jarring follow-up to ""Girl/Boy Song"", but once you've passed the initial confusion and gotten used to the strangeness you can really appreciate how catchy and complex a track it is. Plus it ends the album on a really cheerful note. It's tough to end an album, and I respect this song for bringing things to a close with a whimsical grin rather than the typical melancholy so many albums end on.   In America the Girl/Boy EP was tacked onto the end of the album, but I'm choosing not to include it here because I think the album works better in its original, intended form.   Closing thoughts: Looking back at this album now that I've embraced the rest of Richard's discography, I'm struck by how short the tracks on this album are. It gives the album a brisk pace and prevents it from overstaying its welcome, but it's a noticeable stylistic difference from the majority of Richard's work. I've heard this album described as Richard's response to Luke Vibert's Drum 'N' Bass For Papa, and I think that's an interesting comparison, and I can definitely see some influence. What do you guys think?"
aphextwin,3cttk4,OmegasSquared,6,Sat Jul 11 01:39:57 2015 UTC,"Haven't heard that Luke Vibert album before, but I agree with what you said about this being one of his most important releases.

aphextwin,3cttk4,MyNameIsPraxin,6,Sat Jul 11 04:56:18 2015 UTC,"I know I'm a little late so hopefully this doesn't get buried. I just have one observation on this album that I think sums up its genius. So on my first ever listen through of the album I was a kind of put off by the track Cornish acid. I had enjoyed '4' (obviously because who wouldn't) but was finding Cornish acid a bit of a chore to get through. I wanted to skip it but I didn't as I was waiting for it to pay off, but it never did. It just morphed into 'Peek 824545201' which I found equally as annoying UNTIL the melody came in. Everything clicked. It was one of the most luscious melodies id ever heard and it had been heightened by what came before it. It was like hacking through a dense jungle to come out into an oasis. I had put in so much work that the melody paid off immensely. I appreciate both songs separately now but nothing will beat that feeling of the first time I had heard. Having to have listened to the song previous in order to fully appreciate the next track, to me, is one of the most genius things I've ever encountered."

They ARE listenable though, and he might grow into a great musician over time.  How old is he anyway? Under 8? Really I guess it's impressive that he's even at this level if he is."
aphextwin,3cp0zc,WildBluntHickok,5,Fri Jul 10 03:35:07 2015 UTC,"I'm almost positive those tracks were just RDJ taking the piss and trying to make the worst tracks imaginable. I get the feeling he made up the whole having kids thing, but who really knows right?"
aphextwin,3cp0zc,MyNameIsPraxin,4,Fri Jul 10 07:35:58 2015 UTC,"I think he has at least one child. In 2008 I saw RDJ perform at Coachella.

It seemed quite obvious by her body language that they were his partner and child, watching him perform."

aphextwin,3cp0zc,jbourne0129,3,Fri Jul 10 11:42:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know he mentioned having a wife and kids in the pre-Syro release interviews he did, but that syrobonkers interview says otherwise. Then again, there were a lot of contradicting statements in that and he said he wasn't even RDJ at the end if I remember right.  BUT, then again the way he talked in that interview is very similar to the way he talks on SoundCloud, so I'm pretty sure it was him.   So he's either lying about having kids, or lying about lying about having kids. I don't even know anymore."

I venture out into squarepusher, venetian snares, and clark, and while I like them all, they dont jold my attention like RDJ.

For example, I write music, and I'm constantly struggling to communicate what I feel, constantly disappointed that my audience doesn't hear what I hear when I listen to my own music.  With RDJ, I get the feeling that what you hear and feel is EXACTLY what he intended (even though thats probably not true). ""Rhubarb"" makes me feel emotion whether I want it to or not. Like it hotwires my brain.  Pure human emotion, unfettered by intellect. Ya feel me?"

We know that the tracks on Syro aren't ""new""... they were made from like 2003 - 2010... he's just clearing out old stuff so he can start releasing new stuff [and I really look forward to NEW NEW stuff]... but it doesn't matter when the tracks were made because even a ton of his older tracks are unique in this way.  They're unique when compared to other artists... and individual tracks from each period of his career can stand out on  their own when compared to his entire body of work.  The day he started dumping unreleased material on soundclown I was at work... and I saw the news on facebook...  I immediately headed over and started listening to them... and when I got to tracks like ""26 5 [DEMO]"", and ""Make a baby"" I literally had tears in my eyes because  it was like I was back in High School hearing lost tracks from Richard D. James Album, and the Hangable Auto Bulb EPs.  I actually had to ask my manager for a snack break so I could wipe the tears from my eyes and regain my composure."

aphextwin,3cl6a1,MyNameIsPraxin,6,Thu Jul 9 01:34:26 2015 UTC,"I've really tried appreciating similar artists, but no one in electronic music comes to even a fraction of his greatness. A word I feel is appropriate to almost all musical artists at this point (especially electronic ones) is ""cheap"". What I mean by that is originality isn't respected at all. Artists don't pursue originality, just about every pop/rock/alternative song has moments that sound just like songs by previous artists. There has been little variation since the Beatles. Electronic artists are really ""cheap"" in my opinion for their whoring out of cool sounds, ""big"" sub bass, repetitiveness, channel switching, etc. Aphex Twin does have some of the most detailed sounds I've heard, but he really never whores out an AMAZING sounding synth patch, or sample, or very shapely drum sample. Oftentimes sounds he uses in his songs are played once or twice, and I feel like I need to isolate it and hear the sound at least 20 more times just because of how detailed, beautiful, and amazing it is.  His songs as a whole are often so insanely good, and I'll just wonder to myself how he makes it work. Take for example ""Bucephalus Bouncing Ball"" which is just about 80% drum sounds of what sounds like pots and pans hitting surfaces, but it works out SO well. Or Mt St. Michel's Mix with it's jungle of drums of many varieties and textures playing extremely fast to the point it just makes you think of randomness, with a solemn and lo-fi synth playing a repeating melody over it, until it melts into what sounds like a little girl humming the melody, to what I imagine dying is like. Last example: Stone in Focus, perhaps one of the most beautiful songs I can think of to me. So much comes to my mind while hearing this beautiful song and it's just three fucking chords repeating for 10 minutes with tape sounds in the background.  I seriously believe RDJ is probably the best artist of all time. I know this is a huge statement to make, and I almost feel wrong saying it with obviously so many other great artists out there, but I really feel like no other musician has came up with so much genius variety, that balances originality with actual good sounding music. I have a feeling Richard realizes how much of a beast he is, and I surely hope so."

So much comes to my mind while hearing this beautiful song and it's just three fucking chords repeating for 10 minutes with tape sounds in the background.   This is what I love about SAW 2 in general, its so simple and minimalistic yet at the same time is just as great (if not better, depending on your view) then most of his super complex tracks. I don't know if I agree with him being the 'best artist of all time', I think that might be a bit of a far stretch considering a fair amount of his early stuff isn't THAT great, but he definately brought a lot to the electronic music scene which not many others have been able to replicate well to this day."
aphextwin,3cl6a1,Staross,3,Thu Jul 9 03:26:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah the greatest artist of all time thing I will definitely admit is just my opinion. SAW 2 was actually how I got into Aphex Twin! I was listening to mainly ambient, and heard White Blur 2 and found it very interesting and from there have heard just about everything he's put out at least once. I see SAW 2 as where he really established himself as an artist, and truly separated himself from other electronic/dance artists he sounded similar to at the time."
aphextwin,3cl6a1,velokitty,2,Thu Jul 9 03:34:46 2015 UTC,"In term of quantities he's far behind classical composers like Bach and such, like he need to seriously speed up the production.   It might be true that his work is more varied, I'm not sure."

aphextwin,3cl56d,MichaelBoltOns,2,Wed Jul 8 19:31:31 2015 UTC,"When Aphex Twin won the Syro Grammy, and some people responded ""Who's Aphex Twin?"" I decided to make this playlist as an introduction to Aphex Twin.  I started the playlist with ""Flim"" [since it seems Skrillex's appreciation for the track has been a launchpad for a new generation of AFX fans].  From Flim I went to Windowlicker [because it had a music video, It is weird enough to prepare them for weirder stuff, and people may recognize it from ""Grandma's Boy"", and ""Hi-Fidelity""].  From Windlowlicker on I grouped tracks together by sound. I tried to see if I could find tracks from every release that went well togther... eg: Windowlicker goes well with XMASEVE_2010 CirclonT6A goes well with 54 cymru beats  The playlist goes back and fourth from the Old to new, New to Old.

aphextwin,3cer62,rd1994,7,Wed Jul 8 07:00:52 2015 UTC,"Tracks that never appeared on an Aphex Twin album, only various artists albums:   ""soit-pp - n.IASP"" and ""Q-Chastic - Cat-002"" off of the ""The Philosophy Of Sound And Machine"" album. He also had a 3rd song on that, but it was reprinted on SAW II (""Blue Calx""). ""Polygon Window - My Teapot"" from ""The Philosophy Of Sound And Machine 2"", the last in the series of Artificial Intelegence albums. This has been released on the soundcloud as an expanded version of the song without the ""shit on the microphone"" audio prank added in (which was also on the soundcloud as a separate track). ""Portreath Harbor"" and ""Redruth School"" by Polygon Window. 2 bonus tracks in the reissue of Surfing on Sine Waves. Also exist on their own as a rare white label. ""At the Heart of it All"" and ""The Beauty of Being Numb pts 1 and 2"" (he only does part 2) off of the Nine Inch Nails remix album Further Down The Spiral. This may be the first thing I heard of his. Either that or the On ep. ""Cunt"" and ""Phlaps"" by Caustic Window. Forget the 2 compilations they're from, but they recently finally got on an album (Caustic Window - Untitled 2xLP) which was created in 1994 but only saw the light of day in 2014. My mp3 copy of Caustic Window - Joyrex J4 always included the original version of Popcorn (the cover tune on the ep). It's by a 70s band called Hot Butter. Not technically aphex, but you can see why someone would include it. ""Crappy"" aka ""Crappy (Radio Mix)"". Unreleased song he played on a radio appearance. When asked the name he said ""just some old crappy tune of mine that I'll probably never release but just fancied hearing for about 2 minutes"". It's on the soundcloud but much shorter. On the radio version he just played the 1 minute tape 3 times to make it a full song. The soundcloud version just is the 1 minute version. ""Metapharstic"" ""We Have Arrived"" (2 versions), and ""Digeridoo (live)"", the bonus tracks from the ""Classics"" reprint album (reprints Digeridoo ep and Xylem Tube ep). ""AFX & Squarepusher - Freeman Hardy & Willis Acid"". Off some WARP or Rephlex compilation I believe. So far as I know it's the only team up of those 2, other than Aphex picking the tracklist of Squarepusher's first album from a pile of 40 songs. ""AFX - Bummy"" also off some compilation I can't remember. I know for sure both this and the last song are published though, rather than just floating around as mp3s. ""Mike and Rich - Brivert and Muons"". Now this one I know has never been officially published. The only source was an mp3 that Mike (Mu-Ziq) released on his website, then later took down. Thus there's no lossless version of this.   Semi-rare stuff that's on some editions of albums and not others:   ""R2D2"" and ""Popcorn"" by Caustic Window. The 2 songs left out of Compilation, the album that reprints all the Caustic Window eps. ""Stone In Focus"" and ""Hankie"" off of the original version of Selected Ambient Works Volume II. The UK LP has 25 tracks, the UK CD has 24 (missing Stone In Focus) and the US edition (either format) has 23 tracks (missing Stone in Focus and Hankie). I believe the paid mp3/wav/flac/whatever versions are the 24 track version. In it's original 25 track form it's a 3 disc set instead of the 2 disc set every other edition is. Analogue Bubblebath 2 Digeridoo. Some people consider this to be an alternate version of the Digeridoo ep, but the title song is the only thing they share. Both eps have Digeridoo as track one and feature 2 unique songs. The Digeridoo ep also has a 4th song, reprinted off of Analogue Bubblebath 1 (different song depending on UK or US edition) Analogue Bubblebath Vol 3. You probably have this, but the CD and LP are very different. You want the CD version specifically, at which point all you're missing is an unimportant 36 second track of talking heard through a wall. Also track 1 has a different outro on the LP version and track 6 (which is track 2 on the LP) starts with a microwave instead of a vacuum cleaner on the LP version.   Rare albums:   The Joyrex Tape. Leaked tape of unreleased songs by Aphex from 1994. 14 tracks, 1 of them is a released song (one of the Ventolins), most of the rest have since appeared on the soundcloud confirming their authenticity. When asked about track 11 on it Richard said that it was him and Cylob so he'd have to get Cylob's permission before doing anything with the song. Melodies From Mars. Unreleased album of tracks Richard was using to try and get work writing video game soundtracks. Wish that had worked, I would've loved to play a game with his music. Analogue Bubblebath 5. Unreleased but leaked. Analogue Bubblebath 6. Unreleased but leaked by Richard on soundcloud. Possibly still missing tracks (7 songs numbered 2-8). Caustic Window 2xLP (goes by other names such as ""untitled"" and ""Caustic Window - Caustic Window""). Like AB5 it was made in the mid 90s but never released. 5 copies were printed (1 for Richard and 1 each for the 4 people in the phone pranks track) and in 2014 someone sold their copy. A kickstarter was started (with Richard's permission) in which everyone who pledged would get a digital rip of the LP. It went well past it's goal, after ripping the original of the album was bought by Minecraft's creator Notch, and one of the people who received a digital copy shared it with the internet (big surprise right?). The success of this was what prompted Richard to get back into doing albums, and Syro soon followed."

Listening to 38 again (it's 38 seconds not 36) it's not through a wall, it's just bad sound quality compounded by strange effects. At any rate I'm fine with leaving it off my mp3s of the cd version as it's just an idle conversation and I can't make it out fully anyway."

You can also pop over to the WATMM forum, that's where all the ""hardcore"" fans go and they know about pretty much everything Rich has done.

There's also the Marchrom single release which had two versions of the title track and an alternate mix of Xmas_Eve. Uhhhh what else, there's the Syrobonkers tracks if you can count those, multiple random remixes he's done like 'Richards Hairpiece' and of course the soundcloud dump.

aphextwin,3cb9tg,VoltNine,8,Mon Jul 6 15:49:31 2015 UTC,"This 1996 Rephlex collab between RDJ and Mike Paradinas (µ-Ziq) is a sort of odd one-off record. It's electronic, jazzy, goofy and by turns interesting and sort of okay. Not the top release in either players catalog, but not the worst either.  This was new to me, as I never got around to picking up a copy. I gave it a couple spins... and I think it's got a handful of pretty good cuts.   Mr. Frosty: With the goofy bass line, the funky organ and tambourine shakes, Mr. Frosty starts off EKT with a sense of fun. It's a straight forward sort of stomper like most of the album.   Jelly Fish: Another fun loop opens this cut, followed by some Aphex Twin annoyance in the form of a loud squelch. Luckily it's not present for the whole track, nor is it a rhythmic element. There's a bit of a shuffle beat, and some background 'whistling' effects.   Eggy Toast: An almost spanish opening feel to the track, gets some electronic noises and keys added to it.   Reg: Another track with a sorta of shuffling beat, but featuring a stand-up bass line, a vox loop and some spaced out keys.   Vodka: Clearly an RDJ beat it sounds greatly like of a Melodies From Mars track with additional keys and effects.   Winner Takes All: Sounding almost like a game show theme or video game music, this is an upbeat little number. Has a jazzy feel mixed in with a little discordant layer chords and effects. Some horn samples too.    Giant Deflating Football: A very jazzy underlaying track with drums/horns/keys overlaid with synth noodling overtop.   Upright Kangaroo: A drum beat that almost sounds like a bouncing ball, some scratching noises, and another sorta jaunty keybaord line.   The Sound of Beady Eyes: The longest cut on the record, it opens with a pulsing keyboard riff, and a clap n' stomp beat.  Bu Bu Bu Ba: The final cut has a sample that sounds like 'wha-wha' coupled with a slow hi-hat, kick beat and a repeated vocal line that sounds like the name of the track. Also whistling, keys, and various noises."
aphextwin,3cb9tg,addking,4,Mon Jul 6 16:02:01 2015 UTC,"First discussion I've done since we were up to SAW 2, which was pretty much me saying ""yeah it's cool"" so I'll try actually putting some effort into this one. I've recently started getting into a bunch of Mike Paridinas's stuff, mostly his U-Ziq albums, and actually only heard about this album not too long ago so it's still a pretty new experience for me re-listening to it right now. You can really hear Mike's influence and ideas come through a lot on here, more so than RDJ, and it's a strange album to say the least. Anyway here's what I think about it.  Mr Frosty - Starting off with a bouncy bassline and a straight 4/4 drum beat mixed in with some bright organ chords the track kicks off the album on a pretty funky note. There's no real noticable Aphex influence in here at first, that is until the string section about 2 minutes in is introduced, adding even more to a track already bursting with sound. Around 4 minutes in we're treated to a nice MFM sounding lead synth, once again completely changing the tone of the track. It's around the 5 minute mark everything is abruptly stripped back as the track returns to organ dominated sounds from the beggining, with the string and lead section returning not long after to finish off the track. Overall it's a decent track, although I feel there's a bit too much going on at some times and it doesn't always sit very well together. On the other hand, I really enjoyed the flanger effect throughout as well as the minimalistic drum beat, which is probably the only time I'll ever say that regarding an Aphex Twin track in my entire life. I'd give it a 6/10  Jelly Fish - Being almost completely centered around a short 2 second long guitar loop, the track couples smooth synth lines with a syncopated hi-hat rhythm throughout, adding in a couple weird sounds occasionally including a short xylophone solo, something that almost sounds like a theremin, and super resonant high frequency noises (the last of which was really more annoying then it was interesting). It doesn't take long for the aforementioned loop to get pretty repetitive, although the variety of interesting sounds peppered throughout the track more then make up for it. Another complaint is the length of the track, being as repetitive as it is I feel like 6 minutes is a bit too long to maintain interest all the way through. Decent enough, but definately not a favorite. 6/10  Eggy Toast - Combining pretty ""natural"" sounding drums with some pretty bizarre synth melodies this track almost contradicts itself in an interesting way, which becomes a lot more apparent once the natural elements are taken away at the 1:40 mark. The track seems to have a better sense of progression and structure than the previous one, giving all the individual sounds their own time to flourish on their own. Being only 3 minutes long this time it doesn't needlessly drag itself out for longer than it really has to. One of the more enjoyable tracks off the album for me with no real major complaints, I give it 7/10   Reg - Keeping with the general ""what the fuck am I listening to"" theme of the album, Reg features a surf-rock style sample along with some syncopated open hi-hat rhythms, super fat 303 basslines, strange vocal samples and RDJ's familiar outerwordly sounding synthwork. Around 2:50 the track takes an interesting turn as a plucked string melody is introduced, the majority of the sounds from the start are removed, the filter on the bassline starts going crazy and a strange FM drum beat kicks in. Around 4:38 it ramps back into surf-rock mode for the remainder of the track. One of the wackier tracks on the album, the experimentation here doesn't feel 'forced' at all and has some of the most intersting and memorable moments heard so far. 8/10  Vodka - Almost instantly you can hear a lot more Aphex influence in this one, almost sounding like a direct out-take from MFM. The frenetic high frequency percussion, bizarre synth lines, hard hitting breakbeats and heavy emphasis on melody make Vodka stand out from the sample-based, genre clashing mind fuckery of the rest of the album. There isn't really much to say about this track honestly, it's so fast paced and crazy I can't even really pinpoint everything that's going on. It's classic, mental AFX, and I love it. 8/10  Winner Takes All - Super upbeat keys and an almost hip-hop esque breakbeat begin the track before we're introduced to some more strange, moody synth lines that have become the standard for this album. Some bright horn sounds come in around 2:25 before the track dissolves once again into the moody synth oriented sounds from before. From there the track more or less just repeats itself until the end. Not the most exciting track ever, although it's definately got a cool groove to it. 6.5/10  Giant Deflating Ball - Changing pace to a much slower, mellowed out track this time around with some jazzy horns laced together with sliding synth lines, Giant Deflating Ball doesn't really do too much for me even though it is a nice change of pace. Once again, it's super repetitive, although there's a couple slight variations and sounds added throughout that make it worth the listen. Possibly my least favorite on the album, I give it 5.5/10  Upright Kangaroo - Taking the super heavy industrial sounds from the Ventolin era and mixing them together with even more strange synths, an acid bassline, odd vocal snippets and off-beat jazzy piano chords this track has a lot going on straight from the get up. Sadly though that's pretty much all that goes on during its 3 and a half minute runtime and, once again, it's super repetitive. Which is a shame because I feel it would be a great track if it was extended upon a litle. 6/10  The Sound Of Beady Eyes - Now this is one is really cool, having some super funky synthesized bassline with some jazzy hi-hat rhythms laced over the top among various other odds and ends added throughout. It does almost sound like some theme song to a shitty 90's sitcom or game show or something at first, although the SAW-esque melodies and 303 solos throughout keep it unmistakingly Aphex sounding and refreshing. Not being as strange as some of the previous tracks and coming across as a bit more 'serious' this track has even more super memorable and enjoyable moments throughout. 7/10  Bu Bu Bu Ba - By far the least chaotic and most chilled out track on the album, Bu Bu Bu Ba is one of the very few tracks where you can actually hear RDJ singing (and whistling). Well, that is without a vocoder or a million layers of distortion and effects added on top. Also it's his only track (that I'm aware of) to deviate out of a 4/4 time signature, which is pretty cool. Honestly I think this track is an absolute gem, managing to play on RDJ's humourus side while still having his trademark sound and style. Sure it's a bit repetitive, and yeah it's pretty silly, but I don't exactly think him and Mike were going for anything amazing here. Honestly I think I'd go as far as to say this is my favorite track on the album and would give it 8.5/10  All in all Expert Knob Twiddlers is kind of a mixed bag for me, it has its moments but it's definately not RDJ album or Lunatic Harness level good. As a whole I give it a 6/10"

I'd never heard it before but was in Sam Goody's buying Full On Mask Hysteria by Altern-8 and Pac-Man was only like 79p so I thought I'd give it a go. I think I also bought Seseme's Treet by The Smart Es on the same day.  Soon after that I got really into metal and kind of forgot about Aphex Twin and electronic music until I saw Come To Daddy on MTV in 97. This reignited my interest in electronica and I've been a huge fan ever since.

Anyways, I decided to put his name on Youtube and listen to the first song that comes up in the search bar - something I do with pretty much every new artist, that song was Come to Daddy.

aphextwin,3ca9un,qvarcos,5,Wed Jul 8 00:46:05 2015 UTC,"I've got a sort of odd story. I've listened to Skrillex for years now and decided to take a closer look into his inspirations and idols. Found two videos and an interview containing Aphex Twin and pre Skrillex, said Rich was his biggest inspiration and Flim was the best song ever made. So I looked up Flim, and thought it was alright so I tried a suggested song by youtube: Avril 14. And that's when it all started...  alsoskrillexremixedflimforanyonewondering"

In college the next day, I was trying to find bands/artists that were like the music my friend was playing, as he never told me what he was playing that night. I heard of Aphex but never listened to him, so I thought now was as good a time as any. Loaded up SAW 85-91 on YouTube and never looked back. I couldn't get over how much I loved Xtal as soon as I heard it."

aphextwin,3ca9un,JackWilfred,3,Wed Jul 8 21:36:22 2015 UTC,"Showing up a little late for the party but, oh well. 3 years ago I was at a LAN party over a friend's house. It was in a cold, dark basement and it was in the early morning, around 1 or 2 AM. I don't exactly remember how it came up, but my one friend was talking about these creepy music videos his friend showed him, and we were all in the mood for a spook so we humored him and there he showed us the music video for ""Donkey Rhubarb"". He was talking it up, saying all of this shit which I found out later wasn't true about Aphex Twin, stuff like his brother committed suicide, and other tabloid-esque things here and there. A few months later I looked up some other music videos and I found ""Rubber Johnny"", ""Come To Daddy"", and ""Windowlicker"". At the time, I was absolutely speechless while watching the music videos, I couldn't tell if I liked it or not. I eventually found SAW 85-92 and I instantly fell in love with the album. It was more of an acquired taste for me more than anything though because at the time I was still really into EDM music and even really heavy rock music and James's music was too strange for me at the time."
aphextwin,3ca9un,nikola_mihaylov,3,Tue Jul 7 00:58:12 2015 UTC,"It was in 1997. My Family had moved to Arizona from Los Angeles for my dads work in 96... and I was trying to make new friends. My friend Mike had been trying to get me into Electronic Music... because I was always of the opinion that Techno is too repetitive ""doof doof doof"" music.  He had me Borrow MTVs AMP compilation so I could Checkout Atari Teenage Riot [because I was coming from a Punk Background]... He also wanted me to checkout Orbital, FSOL, and Chemical Bros to see if I wanted to borrow any of their CDs from him.  We were listening to the comp in him mom's car... and we hit Girl/Boy Song... in played for about 20 seconds... and he hit the next button on the CD player... and I was like ""Wait... what was that... Go back to that... It sounded like it was about to get interesting"".  When the drums kicked in.... I was totally blown away. I asked: ""Who is this""? and he looked on the back of the package... ""Aphex Twin... never heard of him... so... of all the stuff I've played you... you like THIS?""  ""Hell yeah... those drums are nothing like anything I've ever heard in Techno... How in the world does someone make drums like that???""   I was working in the High School Cafe on my lunch breaks... and I walked to the local Sam Goody music store to see if they had any of this ""Aphex Twin"" they had Come to Daddy, I care Because You do..., and the Richard D. James Album... which had Girl/Boy on it.  I had to save for 2 weeks at the Cafe to afford my copy of RDJ Album... I knew it was a gamble because I had no way to heard the other tracks before purchase.  Got it home... put it in the Stereo... plugged headphones in... and that was the 1st day of the rest of my life. I told Mike that record was mind blowing... and the same day... he had bought Come to daddy... and he was blown away too.  From there we got into Squarepusher, Autechre, Plaid, Luke Vibert, DMX Krew, Cylob, µ-ziq... then through planet-µ we got into Richard Divine, VSnares.  After High School... Mike, Me, and some other Locals in AZ started making music on our own... and had a monthly event in AZ called ""thru the wires""... that lasted about 4 years before the IDM scene kinda petered off :( [Biggest acts we had were probably Cylob, Richard Divine, Flashbulb, Daedalus, GirlTalk, & Otto Von Schirach]  I miss those days... wish ""IDM"" would make a revival. We were really dumbfounded when dubstep took off. We were like ""ok... so we discovered this... got really into it... and got over it like 2 years ago... and now some Kid with the sides of his head shaved has exploited the wobble and all the Jocks are going apeshit"". /long post"
aphextwin,3ca9un,xach_hill,2,Tue Jul 7 20:51:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sometimes I wish IDM was a lot bigger then it is currently, but then I remember how much of an absolute shit-fest Dubstep has become where it's gotten to the point people are petrified to take a single risk in their music and prefer to just do the same shit Skrillex did over and over again, and I think yeeaaaah I don't want that to happen. There are enough Aphex/Squarepusher/Autechre clones in the world already, the last thing we need is even more of them. As long as great artists continue to make great music, I'm happy, regardless of how popular they are or whether or not their music is 'in' at the moment."

Xtal was the first for me - I was trying to find something dark, eerie and interesting... I found it upon clicking it in my iTunes as I may have... er... torrented all of his stuff (I was a kid, forgive me, I've bought almost everything I can get my hands on since then!) because I kept seeing and hearing his name everywhere, don't ask me how. I thought it was an 80s electronic group back then... I know better now of course, I was hooked from the go!"

I always saw that picture of Richard on the spine and thought it was really odd throughout my childhood. It wasn't until I was around 13 that I came across his music (probably through David Firth) independently and instantly recognised the Windowlicker album cover. Bizarre how those things come together

Nothing too useful that can be gained out of this, maybe other than information if someone were to try to replicate his track, or maybe as insight into what some of the sounds used in the rest of the EP could sound like."

On the SAW2 review, he suggests some really excellent ambient albums that I hadn't heard prior.    http://rdj.thefiftytwoweeksproject.com/post/118600022021/week-nineteen-aphex-twin-selected-ambient-works    Jonsi & Alex’s Riceboy Sleeps – a truly fucking beautiful living, breathing organism of acoustic-driven ambient sounds.    1 Mile North’s Minor Shadows – my introduction to the genre, a seriously underrated mess of analog synths and dreamy guitar loops, and a constant companion through endless nights and days of gloomy weather.    The Dead Texan’s self-titled – did they ever do another? The dronier side of ambient at its best.    A Lily’s Wake:Sleep – shit, I haven’t actually listened to that in years! One of those nothing groundbreaking but does-everything-perfectly type records.    The Tumbled Sea’s melody/summer – beautiful contemporary piano-type stuff.    We All Inherit The Moon’s 月継 – another seriously underrated one, messy minimalism, as raw as ambience can get sometimes, I think.    Brian Eno’s Music For Airports – a classic for a reason, I have a lot of memories tied up in this one. I remember one year, just before Christmas, my friends and I put it on a loop all night while snow fell outside the windows and everything felt so unreal.    The Glow Part 2 by The Microphones"

aphextwin,3c3s34,ZoeBlade,3,Sat Jul 4 20:35:47 2015 UTC,IM GOING ON AN ADVENTURE
aphextwin,3c3s34,MyNameIsPraxin,3,Sat Jul 4 21:39:27 2015 UTC,"Audacity's mostly just good for recording and editing sounds, people use it to record vocals and what not, but it can't actually really 'make' music. There's a lot of DAW's (digital audio workstation's) to choose from and they all have their pro's and con's, a lot of people will tell you 'x is better and more powerful' and you'll probably hear a lot of conficting things, although honestly there's no 'best' DAW and it really just comes down to personal taste and preference. Anyway, long story short, if I were you I'd look into downloading a demo version of Fl Studio, it's generally considered to be the most 'entry-level' DAW and definitely the easiest to wrap your head around at first (I've been using it for about 4 years now)"
aphextwin,3c3s34,ZoeBlade,3,Sat Jul 4 23:28:59 2015 UTC,"Okay, and roughly how long would it take for a complete beginner like me to produce Aphex style music?"
aphextwin,3c3s34,Chemistride,4,Sun Jul 5 00:39:23 2015 UTC,"A long time man. Rdj has been at it since at least 1985 and he also just has knack for music. You can make some nice tracks after like 6 months of fucking around but rdj style production is pretty hard to top imo. Also you should make your own style tunes not just copy rdj, its a game you won't win."
aphextwin,3c3s34,kieselgurian,3,Sun Jul 5 00:48:39 2015 UTC,"No truer words have been spoken, I really want to make ambient/dance music, the stuff that you can find on majesticcasual"
aphextwin,3c3s34,SlateFx,3,Sun Jul 5 00:58:17 2015 UTC,"Richard's sounds are mainly from analogue synths and drum machines, samplers and effects. VST (software) synths won't sound the same. Analogue drum-machines are basically specialised analogue synthesizers, so the same goes for them. Software samplers are fine though (they were always digital). Some VST's and digital outboard synths can of course sound amazing, but I think it's safe to say that they're not a major part of the kind of sounds you're after.  Here's a list of suggestions for you to get started. I'm assuming you're on a small budget and know how to use a DAW:   Perhaps the most important thing is to find some good speakers (studio-monitors), to be able to properly hear what you're doing. Mixing your stuff on bad speakers can easily fool you, and potentially ruin your mix. Headphones will bust your ears with prolonged use. Get a decent soundcard with MIDI connections. You'll need MIDI to control outboard gear, and you'll need a soundcard to be able to record them (unless you record unto magnetic tape). Find a MIDI-compatible analogue synth and a couple of effect-machines/pedals (guitar pedals work just fine).  Get a small outboard mixer. It doesn't have to be big, but try to find one with a decent EQ on every channel.  Buy more cables. Paint som e MIDI dots in your software and start recording. Remember that a lot of Richard's early sound were made by really fucking around with gear and recording techniques. Consider using microphones to record the sound in your bedroom (or wherever) and don't be afraid to modify your equipment. Invent you own setups - and keep at it.  Have fun."
aphextwin,3c3s34,kieselgurian,3,Sun Jul 5 07:43:01 2015 UTC,"Im on it, although roughly how much would it cost to get all this equipment together?"
aphextwin,3c3s34,SlateFx,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:42:04 2015 UTC,"Good list. One point I have though is that it's kind of impossible to say VSTs aren't a major part of the sounds he's after. There are some damn good VSTs out there, and you can pretty much make them sound like any kind of synth you can dream of. Obviously it won't sound exactly the same as a vintage analog synth, but the good VST synths can do A LOT. I've made plenty of Aphex-style sounds on them."

aphextwin,3c2fao,addking,5,Sat Jul 4 03:21:17 2015 UTC,"Hangable Auto Bulb EP:  A 6 track EP Dropping in October of 95. A huge change of pace with drum and bass breakbeats.  Children Talking: Sampling from the BBC series of the same name - This is a twisty sort of drum and bass track, even featuring some nice chunks of RDJ melody dropped among the beats.   Hangable Auto Bulb: Starts with stuttering clicky noises and proceeds to slowly build from there, it drops into a glitchy spaced out mid-section.  Laughable Butane Bob:  Opening the B-side of the 12"", is a fast drum propelled beat and some large synth chords. There's some nice permutations of the drums and just hangs on the synth line. One of the best on this release.   Bit: It's one extremely short clip.   Custodian Discount: The slow spacey keyboard lines and the sorta fast drum and bass beats make an interesting juxtaposition. It's not too far from a lot of other dnb tracks.   Wabby Legs:  It's glitchy drums are loud in the mix, over some 'wabby' keys and has distinct and loud cymbal bell hits. A nice  change of pace at the 4 minute mark, with a bouncy melodic bit, before falling back to the drum/bell and keys.      Hangable Auto Bulb EP 2: 2 more tracks Dropping in December of 95.   Every Day: Insistance synth pulses and another 'Childen Talking' sample detailing the boredom of daily routine are floated over some clicky drums.   Arched MAid Via RDJ: Dirty keys and a rolling glitchy beat open this track, with breakbeats dropping all over this cut. Various key parts layer and beat stutters all over. It's driving an melodic both, a fantastic closer."
aphextwin,3c2fao,Stavorius,5,Sat Jul 4 03:22:33 2015 UTC,"HAB was my first physical RDJ album and strangely enough, I bought it for one buck at a dump store...   *Children Talking - Meh-shed potatoes. A bit repetitive - 7,5/10  *Hangable Auto Bulb - Drum and bass man! Whoah - 6,5/10  *Laughable Butane Bob - Favorite of the album - 8,5/10  *Bit - Seriously - 3,5/10  *Custodian Discount - Meh. After a while, it gets a bit the same 6/10  *Wabby Legs - Not so good - 5,5/10  *Every Day - Mildly okay., but not super good - 7,5/10  *Arched Maid Via RDJ - Nice one Rich - 7/10  OVERALL SCORE: 7/10"
aphextwin,3c2fao,0rangento,4,Sun Jul 5 19:46:57 2015 UTC,"Hangable Auto Bulb is one of those songs that just gets better on every listen. There just so much content there and the song flows into each section extremely well.   It's by far one of my favourites of Richard, likely in the top 5."
aphextwin,3c2fao,MichaelBoltOns,2,Sun Jul 5 17:10:01 2015 UTC,"In my opinion... HAB is where ""IDM"" got started. Forget the WARP/TVT Artificial Intelligence Comp... that was still Ambient/Experimental as far as I'm concerned.  When RDJ released the HAB EPs this is where it got REAL!!! No one had really taken Breakbeat programming to this level yet. ""Go on, Give us a Snare Rush, Rush, RushshuR""."
aphextwin,3c2fao,EamonnMR,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:18:03 2015 UTC,"It stands with SAW and Syro as one of the best overall RDJ releases. Like MFM though, he was never interviewed about it. What made him take such a leap forward in style? Was it the first time he really used a DAW as he implied when discussing RDJ album?  I love the breaks, I love the glitches, I love the melodies, and the knob twiddling. It's a great listen, even though he got better later on (with 4 being perhaps the cleanest example of the HAB style)"
aphextwin,3c19nj,SlateFx,3,Fri Jul 3 21:02:31 2015 UTC,Exciting Fact: In 2010 he said that he remade this album 3 years ago. 2007 = The Tuss! The prospect of a Tuss styled remake of this amazing album is almost too good to believe :)

Hes the only artist where this happens, and I'm sure its down to purely the fact that hes released so many amazingly intricate and detailed tracks, its insane."
aphextwin,3c0e56,SlateFx,4,Fri Jul 3 19:47:30 2015 UTC,"Some tracks are also difficult to get into, because they are really weird, or sonically aggressive (e.g. Ziggomatic). I sometimes go from ""what is this crap!?"" to ""this is the best thing ever!"" within a few months."
aphextwin,3c0e56,SlateFx,4,Fri Jul 3 20:56:47 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah for sure, its really weird to think about when you look at it objectively. The first time I heard Ziggomatic I didn't like it at all and just heard a bunch of harsh beats and weird notes, now I completely understand what's happening and it's just beyond genius in every way, from the insane rhythms to the absolute beautiful melodies, the CRAZY sound design, intricate detail and so much more. The polar opposite reactions to the music through repeated listens is really weird isn't it? But it entirely existed and I'm glad because that track is truly a bloody gift to this world, absolute masterpiece! :)"
aphextwin,3c0e56,CSCareerQuestions243,4,Fri Jul 3 21:28:34 2015 UTC,"This exactly  Listening to drukqs the first time I didn't like it too much.  Didn't know wtf was going on, the drums sounded too harsh for me, I didn't want the volume loud.  Now at easily 100+ listens it's my favorite album of all time by far - nothing competes.  Drukqs kind of ruined electronic music listening for me because now I just have higher standards of listening, sorry for the ridiculously snobbishness of that lol."
aphextwin,3c0e56,SlateFx,4,Fri Jul 3 21:33:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah bro completely agree with you, glad there are other people who regard it as their favorite album of all time, it truly is so far above anything else I've ever heard. I sometimes get sad when I see people just eat up all this mainstream bullshit, and know they wouldn't get or enjoy Drukqs if it was forced down their throats, call it elitist but this place really is the best <3"
aphextwin,3c0e56,helloworldalex,3,Fri Jul 3 22:12:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I don't even have the patience for most music anymore. Even descent electronic, I'll listen to like 4 bars, and be like 'OK, I see what they are doing.'   It's similar to when I was a freshman in college and I read like 8 Hunter S. Thompson books in a row. They were all so fun and easy to read. They were poignant and hilarious and without pretentiousness. It made reading anything else boring for years. Accept that with RDJ, its pretty permanent.   I definitely enjoy other music, but I keep coming back to rdj. I listent to him more than all the other music I listen to combined. I try to play him publicly every time I can and fuck em if they can't get into it. :)"

The 2 before them (with my family + nocares) are better songs in my opinion, although they're laidback songs and that's not always what a listener is looking for.  EDIT: also I sometimes get this with old albums of his if I've taken longer than usual between listens. Of course it helps listening to the whole album instead of just playing your favorite 3 tracks and moving on. I find with albums some tracks you like on first listen, some grow on you after awhile, and others take years for you to properly enjoy, once you've heard the other songs you like on the album a few too many times. You think you've heard an album to death, then suddenly the last 3rd of it clicks for you."

Rubber Johnny uses a remix of Afx237 v7, and Monkey Drummer uses the first 2 minutes of Mt Saint Michel + St Michaels Mount. Both would've been a lot better if they had used the whole song. Rubber Johnny features Richard in a mask pretending to be a disabled disfigured chap on coke, monkey drummer features what looks like a robot with a monkey head and multiple hands so it can play 7 drums at the same time (3 hands on each side and one in his crotch). There's actually no robot, it's 7 different shots of a human hand playing drums spliced together. The trunk of the body and the head aren't human, but I wouldn't call it a robot either as it's not capable of doing anything other than raising the head like it was on a high-hat."

aphextwin,3buwgn,motherstep,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:14:07 2015 UTC,Interestingly Shazam identifies the track as Bonus EMT beats...
aphextwin,3buwgn,Donrafaeli,6,Tue Jul 7 09:12:28 2015 UTC,"Nice, didn't expect an AFX release. Preordered.  Incidentally, I too have heard the song before. Maybe it's from a Luke Vibert set? I do remember hearing it in much longer context, but I don't know what set for the life of me."
aphextwin,3buwgn,esaruoho,2,Thu Jul 2 14:22:29 2015 UTC,I know Richard played it at melt festival in 2006. i believe there's a bootleg audio sonewhere to stream but i can't be bothered to go and find the exact time.
aphextwin,3buwgn,Donrafaeli,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:03:30 2015 UTC,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fudIi8U5Zw8 <- here's the track in full. no need to find any melt festival videos etc.  it is a remix of luke vibert's spiral staircase, that afx entered into the competition anonymously, and won the future music compo."
aphextwin,3buwgn,JackWilfred,1 point,Fri Jul 3 08:45:29 2015 UTC,"iirc this is the actual spiral staircase remix posted in richard's sc dump, and the above track was until a few days ago a mistery afx track which vibert played in one of his sets. (A watmm user then posted it on youtube with the title ""scirem"" because it sounded like it could have been the remix because some sounds are similar)  In any case it's an older afx track which is now getting released, a similar thing happened on syro."
aphextwin,3buwgn,Donrafaeli,2,Fri Jul 3 16:27:12 2015 UTC,"a similar thing happened on syro   For those unaware, minipops 67, the first track on the album, was played at a 2007 gig in Manchester. It was recorded there and made the rounds on the internet, dubbed the 'Manchester track'."
aphextwin,3buwgn,rd1994,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:59:10 2015 UTC,"also XMAS_EVET10 was called ""the metz track"" because it was played at a show in 2010 at the metz :)"

aphextwin,3buwgn,MyNameIsPraxin,2,Thu Jul 2 22:34:36 2015 UTC,"I wonder if he still puts Big Loada on sometimes. I'm sure it's in his collection, but his collection's big and the ep is more than 20 years old. Then again it is one of the more memorable releases by Squarepusher and I'm sure Richard spins his stuff regularly."
aphextwin,3buwgn,WildBluntHickok,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:22:01 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, I didn't even realize it was THAT old, wow. But I'd take a guess and say Richard is a pretty big fan, considering he ended up adopting a pretty similar style to early-ish squarepusher releases like this one"
aphextwin,3buwgn,rd1994,2,Fri Jul 3 05:56:24 2015 UTC,"Now that I think about it ""more than 20 years"" might be wrong. 1995 would be 20 years ago but I think Big Loada was 1997."

aphextwin,3bq6xb,GlitchyFlame,29,Wed Jul 1 06:54:52 2015 UTC,AFX is mainly acid music
aphextwin,3bq6xb,lythandas,10,Wed Jul 1 12:05:12 2015 UTC,"ive never been able to describe it but i do use this example; the analord series was by afx, except for 2 tracks credited to aphex twin: fenix funk 5 and xmd 5a. the difference should now be clear."
aphextwin,3bq6xb,frankdive,7,Wed Jul 1 13:06:59 2015 UTC,This  Aphex Twin is the masterpieces  (though everything by AFX also is)
aphextwin,3bq6xb,CSCareerQuestions243,9,Thu Jul 2 01:35:49 2015 UTC,"I'd say AFX is mainly acid techno whereas Aphex Twin releases what you could call IDM, Ambient, Ambient Techno and some acid and techno."
aphextwin,3bq6xb,DJ-Freaksy,18,Wed Jul 1 13:55:27 2015 UTC,"I believe the Aphex Twin moniker is with Warp, so with AFX he can do whatever he wants without Warp."
aphextwin,3bq6xb,michaelt4,4,Wed Jul 1 11:57:21 2015 UTC,which is not the case..there have been (including the newly announced one) 2 AFX releases via warp.
aphextwin,3bq6xb,rd1994,2,Thu Jul 2 12:22:05 2015 UTC,this is the only answer.
aphextwin,3bq6xb,kaydpea,10,Thu Jul 2 01:33:23 2015 UTC,raw vs polished
aphextwin,3bq6xb,DrMaloo,4,Wed Jul 1 12:05:29 2015 UTC,afx is just an alternate name. this is done so as to not conflict with contracts. that is all.
aphextwin,3bq6xb,goonstock,2,Wed Jul 1 22:14:50 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't becessarily say that. AFX certainly sounds different from his Aphex Twin releases. More acid I'd say, but I don't know much about it"

aphextwin,3bq6xb,helloworldalex,3,Fri Jul 3 09:18:32 2015 UTC,"When this question was asked a while back, the best response imo was that AFX was all analog jams and Aphex was a mixture of digital and analog."
aphextwin,3bq6xb,Chemistride,3,Wed Jul 1 18:17:53 2015 UTC,"Here's another interesting question: do you pronounce AFX as ""ay eff eks"" or ""aphex""?"

aphextwin,3bq6xb,MyNameIsPraxin,9,Thu Jul 2 09:06:57 2015 UTC,"AFX = Techno  Aphex Twin = Music  Edit: Don't down vote me, it actually says this in the video for Come to Daddy written on the walls."

aphextwin,3bq6xb,MyNameIsPraxin,2,Thu Jul 2 09:08:01 2015 UTC,"Looks like I'm still getting them lol but they are in the video for Come to Daddy.  When the midgets are fighting after the TV is dropped (around 3:39), you can clearly see graffiti in the background that says ""is techno AFX"" or something like that (mabye AFX is techno or something).  And as the song begins to taper off at the end when the big scary white afx dude is hugging all the children, 3 times, the afx logo flashes in the lower left corner, and if you freeze on that frame, you see some really blurry text, and what i can make out is that it says 'music is aphex twin'"""
aphextwin,3bq6xb,ItsDomz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:56:17 2015 UTC,"the end is just a quck flash of the intro where it says ""music by aphex twin"" but also there are some tracks by aphex twin that I would consider techno and viceversa."

aphextwin,3bkz3x,master_bungle,3,Wed Jul 1 12:23:19 2015 UTC,"This is around about where he finishes making tracks that are all one long section with various instruments joining and leaving, and starts experimenting with making music comprised of multiple sections.  While some of the Melodies From Mars tracks alternate between two sections, verse/chorus style, Pancake Lizard has one long section up until 2:44, at which point it switches to the second section, never to return.  It's a pretty lateral thought process to do that, I think.  It's also that lovely period where he combines (as far as I can tell) household objects, orchestral samples and synths in a way that few others have.  It's all quite beautiful, really.  Hmm, listening more closely, it does alternate... it's more like A B A B A C."
aphextwin,3bkz3x,WildBluntHickok,2,Tue Jun 30 11:07:17 2015 UTC,"I love hearing a lot of Aphex tracks slowed down, but I really enjoy pancake lizard sped up. If it's your favourite track by him, I would def recommend check it out. Pretty sure it's on youtube somewhere."
aphextwin,3bkz3x,notmaurypovich,8,Tue Jun 30 14:26:59 2015 UTC,"Gotta love that 4 songs/20 minutes format. I wonder if any of the soundcloud songs are going to see release in that 4/20 format?  A1 DONKEY RHUBARB: I suppose a first timer looking at track names without hearing the songs might think this is a remix of Rhubarb. Nope. A bouncy, goofy sounding (but really well written) song whose video features people in teddy bear costumes with their faces replaced by that painting of Richard's face from I Care Because You Do's cover. They're called ""The Rhubears"" and the video features them acting appropriately around children, but late at night when the bears are alone in an industrial warehouse they act violent and obscene towards each other. Musically it deserves it's place as ""the lead song off the album"". The title is in reference to a type of plant resembling rhubarb, poisonous to humans but safe to eat for donkeys. A2 VAZ DEFERENZ: A somewhat harsh sounding song resembling an alarm (although more musical). As ""hard listen"" Aphex songs go I'd say this is easier to listen to than Ventolin (Video Version). The title is a medical reference (the main bloodflow vein in the human penis). B1 ICCT HEDRAL (PHILIP GLASS ORCHESTRATION): World famous composer Philip Glass's reperformance of Icct Hedral from I Care Because You Do. Damn fine job of it he did too. The original is catchy enough, and this version benefits from both the great original songwriting and the great performances of the new musicians. It is a 8 minute version though, so it's a bit of an endurance test. It feels like 4 minutes worth of material in an 8 minute song. Don't ask me what icct hedral means. B2 PANCAKE LIZARD: A standout song (as good as the title song, if not better), this somewhat slow paced song has made it to mixes of mine a few too many times, to the point where I consider it ""overplayed"" and usually try to pick something else. If he ever does have a greatest hits album I think he should pick this song instead of Donkey Rhubarb. Of course we all know what the title is a reference to. Who hasn't enjoyed mixing lizard meat with pancake batter and frying up some pancake lizards?"

As much as people give aphex twin crap for some of his indecipherable songs, the few that are simply named like pancake lizard and windowlicker fit their songs so well.   When I listen to windowlicker, the voices sound like they're literally licking a window.   And pancake lizard evokes an image of a lizard on the road, completely flattened by a tire thus resembling a pancake  Lol obligatory afx is genius all hail our electronic messiah"

aphextwin,3bkz3x,Stavorius,3,Tue Jun 30 06:32:21 2015 UTC,"Donkey Rhubarb: This 4 Track EP followed ICBYD in August.  Donkey Rhubarb: Slighty famous for the video (which uses a shorter by roughly 2 mins edit) featuring the Rhubears. The track starts with a squelchy slightly annoying loop and what sounds like tuned kettle drums opens the track. It's joined by a faster dance beat than starts and stops a few times during the track and then a tinkly melodic line. Ends with a drum break-down into a final repeat of the melody line.   Vaz Deferenz: A bleeping static-y noise loop, drum pads, and a distorted vocal clip.   Icct Hedral (Philip Glass Orchestration): Philip Glass does an arrangement of this ICBYD track. While it's missing the thudding beat, all of the chief melodic motifs are present. It's nearly 2 minutes longer than the LP version, and features some slight experimentation along with the  additional instrumentation but mostly stays pretty close to the RDJ version.  Pancake Lizard: My favorite track on this release with a strong melodic sections and a relaxed almost dubby beat, it's also featured on the 1995 John Peel Session, where it also closes out the set. It's string pulses, slow backbeat and tambourine are overlayed occasionally with other beats."

Here's the mix I made. It's actually split up into the 4 sides for vinyl (although it assumes 30m30s isn't too long for a side): https://soundcloud.com/wildblunthickok/sets/aphex-twin-surfing-on-sine  Here's the 30 songs I voted for on that ""what soundcloud songs should be published as an album"" vote (I've been calling it ""Selected Soundcloud Works"" as it's working title). No attempt was made to fit it into a certain number of CDs or LPs, and the track order is unchanged from the upload order: https://soundcloud.com/wildblunthickok/sets/aphex-twin-selected-soundcloud  Here's a ""mix"" showcasing the 45 minutes of music he posted on May 5th, which I think makes a nice album on it's own: https://soundcloud.com/wildblunthickok/sets/aphex-twin-may-5th-mix  Here's a random 1xLP mix I made (based on a 1/3rd speed slowed down 3xLP mix I made, so groups of 10min sides (30min when slowed down) with every 1in3 sides shorter because you can't fit 3x30min on a 78min cd). The slowed down version would fit on 2CDs or 3LPs: https://soundcloud.com/wildblunthickok/sets/aphex-twin-mix-a  And here's a mix with Aphex and a few different bands that Aphex fans would probably like: https://soundcloud.com/wildblunthickok/sets/random-mix  Lastly, although I don't have a link for it, here's what I picked for my ""Aphex Twin singles"" mix a few years back. It's based on what would've been the singles on each album if Aphex was much more commercial and was releasing 3 videos/radio singles per full length album like a normal musician. What songs he picks to play live the most is an example of the kind of mindset that went into this list.

Just under 60 minute albums were the norm and almost no-one put 58 minute albums as 2 disc sets. But then electronic music makes fuller use of all the frequencies and is used to CD's richer palette by now. So maybe music like this doesn't do so well as 60 minute vinyl. Maybe I'm wrong judging it by the same standards they used for 80s metal albums.  Or maybe you're thinking of the difference between a regular release and a deluxe 24bit pressing."

It's mostly the upbeat stuff from his major releases with a few Analord tracks and Tuss stuff. I tried to order the songs so that they flowed into each other as best they could without actually mixing them. It's long overdue for a revision, plenty of tracks should be added, produk 29 always felt a little too slow, and CIRCLONT6A immediately followed by Syro u473t8+e is Syro overkill in the beginning; I only put those two together because I read on WATMM that they might be the same song with different instrumentation, or just be alternate descendants of the same early track, and I wanted to see if I could hear that by repeatedly listening to them in succession.

I'd also recommend Reich's Electronic Counterpoint.   Edit: I should probably add neither of those albums are ambient.

Global Communication, which is a duo consisting of Mark Pritchard and Tom Middleton, have the album '76:14' which is another super highly praised ambient album.  I want to suggest 'Nostromo' by SleepResearch_Facility as well, it sounds almost nothing like SAW 2 but as far as dark (or 'deep', whichever term you prefer) ambient goes, this album takes it to the absolute extreme. Also like his name suggests, its pretty good music to fall asleep to.  Celer have some pretty nice, warm drone-y stuff, and their discography is pretty huge so im not sure I could really give you one album in particular to listen to. Used to be a duo consisting of Will Long and his wife Danielle when they formed in 2005, although Danielle died from heart failure in 2009 so its been a solo project ever since (he did an album titled 'I love you so much I can't even title this' or something along those lines once she died, I think I actually kind of cried a bit when I first read it)  Also another well-known artist is Tim Hecker, again it doesn't really sound like SAW 2 at all, but his music is definitely worth a try if you haven't heard of him before. I'd recommend either 'Virgins' or 'Ravedeath' because they're arguably his two 'best' and well known albums."

Smashing Pumpkins were on tour and ICBYD was the pre-show background music. Just the album in its entirety as a sonic appetizer while people found their seats. It was a show in itself. Never mind the band, I'd pay $40 to hear the album played that loud again. And of course the anger and confusion expressed by many of the alt-rock faithful during ""Ventolin"" was priceless."

aphextwin,3b95zt,0rangento,8,Sat Jun 27 17:10:57 2015 UTC,This is one of the most marvelous things I've heard of/read. Thanks for sharing!
aphextwin,3b95zt,WayneSkylar_,16,Sun Jun 28 02:12:30 2015 UTC,"...I Care Because You Do:  Released in April of 1995, ICBYD is actually a compilation of tracks from 1990 (tracks 3 & 6), 1993 (tracks 2, 7, 12) and 1994 (tracks 1, 4, 5, 8 to 11). Many of the album titles are anagrams and the front cover is a reported self-portrait.  Acrid Avid Jam Shred: A pulsing beat opens ICBYD, slowly joined by some spacious chords, and a bass line. Around 2 mins we start getting some filtered lines and some additional percussion. In a lot of ways Acrid Avid Jam Shred reminds me of a SAW I cut updated for '94. A keyboard line from ""Untitled 10"" on Melodies from Mars* works it way in at 3 mins and then we break down to just drums for a rest of the track. That MFM keyboard line is slowed down here but reviewing this track at 45 RPM reveals the match. I suspect that much like the Joyrex Tape that my copy of MFM (bootleg) is just slightly offspeed.  The Waxen Pith: Filtered drums recalling Analogue Bubblebath's sounds are joined here by strings, bowed instrumentation, and synths. There's a static-y edge around the high-hat work.    Wax The Nip: Faster uptempo into percussion with a ringing melodic line. Strings carry the mid-section of the song, and has a breakdown and fade out ending.  Icct Hedral: Some thudding beats with effects and more synth strings- this time with more complex layering, counter melodies, and some additional noise swells. The higher climbing piece ends the track in a series of swells.   Ventolin (Video Version): The high ringing tone of Ventolin preceeded this record on set of EPs. A shorter edit of Salbutamol mix appears here.   Come On You Slags: The other oldest tune on here features some clips from porn flick ""Seka's Fantasies"" (1981), previously sampled on Caustic Window's Fantasia. The samples are placed along side a climbing and descending riff, some pulsing bleeps and relatively fast drum beats. The audio clip is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiXoIZ7pf9g&t=1m38s  Start As You Mean To Go On: Coming off as something closer to the harder Caustic Window material, it's softened a bit by some floating melodies around the 4 minute mark. Before running out of steam at end.  Wet Tip Hen Ax: Opening with a kick and some keys, a 'wet' noise pulses with the beat. Layering patterns in a similiar manner as Icct Hedral it builds up until 2 mins and then strips back to a more basic groove, until the drums drop and return then dropping everything down to a single hum.  Mookid: A more tribal drum pattern and a careening acid line, joined by piano swells.   Alberto Balsalm: Bubbly, bubbly, bubbly... Percussion, home recorded sounds, and key loops propel this song. Fairly stripped down and very pretty.   Cow Cud Is A Twin: Opening with what sounds like home recorded noises over an almost funky groove featuring loops of sounds, quoting the wikipedia page:' ""cow cud is a twin"" features Apple Computer's PlainTalk speaking and repeating the words ""Aphex Twin"" and ""...I care because you do"" in the background of the left channel. The song uses three of the program's distinctive voices: Bells, Hysterical and Bubbles, the last of which is barely audible without isolating the left channel.' Drumming appears to be the same as Plain an Gwarry from Ventolin EP.  Next Heap With: The album closer opens with ominious sounding keys and moves into strings and horns as the song brightens up melodically. No drums or percussion persent on the track."
aphextwin,3b95zt,SlateFx,17,Sat Jun 27 00:11:04 2015 UTC,"Coziest album ever made. Like most of Rich's albums it has a very distinct theme and sound palette, one with weird samples, amazing Sine wave melodies and super lush pads. The sound palette though is actually one of my favorites, I like this album more than RDJA and HAB, due to the merit of it feeling warmer, and other qualities I can't really explain well with words. The tracks are stunning, 94 was clearly his most prolific year as seen with his SC, and you can imagine tracks such as Cornish Spreeks or 1974 fitting perfectly on this album. Ill do a track by track review:  Acrid Avid Jam Shred: Absolute masterpiece. It sustains an unusual beat throughout the whole song that never gets boring, and the pads that come in at 2:50 is up there with Rich's most beautiful work. This is a tune like no other, and I end up putting it on once a week and just absolute fall in love every single time. The sine wave melody at 3:45 is just perfectly positive, and overall this tune is just such a great gift.   The Waxen Pith: One of the tracks I've listened to the least, but the melody and pads are still super emotive on this track, however it takes a much sadder turn. The sounds on this are well ahead of its time for 94 IMO.  Wax the Nip: The coziest song ever made. Much more of a head banger, however the melody in this one just makes me feel warm, I used to put this one on late at night in the car and it just felt super relaxing, really great effect.  Icct Hedral: 2spooky4me, really dark track but shows Rich's melodic and harmonic genius:  Ventolin: Really like the arpeggio in this, I seem to be in a small fraction of people who arent given a headache, obviously the Tinnitus sound is annoying, but the tune underneath is alright.  Come on you Slags: Probably the worst tune on the album, but that's not to say it's really bad. The melody is good and the vocal sample is pretty obscure and memorable. Should have been swapped out with a SC track however.  Start As You Mean To Go On: Absolute LOVE this track, the super abrasive beat meshes well with the absolute lush reverbed melody to make some real interesting product.    Wen Tip Hex Ax: Nothing too special, but its another pleasant sounding melodic piece to add to the album, really great that he can create so many that a beautiful song like this doesn't really seem to outstanding.  Mookid: One of the most relaxing and peaceful tracks ever, super alien sounding but it's really goddamn good, great to fall asleep or study to.  Alberto Balsalm: For me I was blown away first listen, the melodies were super next level, I didn't know anyone could think like that. However I didn't really get the hype of it being the best tune ever made. I was slightly turned when I listened last week and noticed those SUPER lush pads when the chorus type bit is ending around 2/3 of the way through the song (around 3:20), once I cottoned on to that for the first time I liked the track a whole lot more.  Cow Cud is a Twin: Love the beginning, when you can just imagine Rich recording that beat out of his speakers, and you can sonically peer into his life, song is pretty catchy too.  Next Heap With: My favorite orchestral track off this album, really great stuff, super emotive and sophisticated, a testemant to his insane talent when he was only 23 or so years old.   This turned out much longer than I though it would be, but it's the only way to do this AMAZING album justice. Truly this was the turning point when the world realized he was next level, and only good stuff has come since. Ill do more track by track for his big releases, sorry its not super technical, Ill try to improve!  Overall score (in RDJ terms): 9/10"

aphextwin,3b95zt,WildBluntHickok,6,Sat Jun 27 02:01:16 2015 UTC,I listened to I Care Because You Do because of Ventolin mostly and even know I still think of Icct Hedral as more of an intro to Ventolin than a separate track even if it's 8 minutes long.  Ventolin just happens to be one of my favorite Aphex Twin songs so yeah it was only fitting to listen to the album to be honest.
aphextwin,3b95zt,ZoeBlade,6,Sat Jun 27 07:28:05 2015 UTC,"The first Aphex Twin album I ever owned. It and Richard D James album will always have a special place in my heart.  Hey am I the only one who wondered if ""Start As You Mean To Go On"" was a remix of On? I've been writing it out as ""(Start As You Mean To Go) On"" for awhile now but I never actually heard confirmation."
aphextwin,3b95zt,WildBluntHickok,5,Sat Jun 27 14:13:06 2015 UTC,"It's got the same kick drum, so probably counts as a remix in Aphex-world. :)  That kick drum's used at its regular speed and also double speed (an octave up) in On.  If anything, I'd say it's more likely that On is a remix of (or at least sampled) Start As You Mean to Go On."
aphextwin,3b95zt,ZoeBlade,2,Sat Jun 27 17:09:53 2015 UTC,Well they're both 1993 songs so it could go either way.
aphextwin,3b95zt,19headaches,2,Sun Jun 28 03:27:31 2015 UTC,"It's just that the drums in Start As You Mean to Go On have timbral noodling going on, whereas the On kick doesn't (making me think it's a sample from Start As You Mean to Go On), and also On plays it back at different pitches, showing it really is a sample (otherwise playing it an octave up would be very unlikely to speed up the VCA proportionally)."

I can't say it's number 1 as I admittedly can't find myself liking the outro; The next heap with, however this album (simultaneously with HAB ep) was my introduction to Richard.   Almost 2 years ago now I was slowly becoming more tired of the Chemical Brothers and a few artists I listened to of similar nature. Out of interest I look through my dad's CD collection and found a few AFX albums. Later I'd burn them onto my ipod and attempt to listen to them on the way to school. At first I sorted of skimmed through them, thought they were a bit weird and continued to blast my head off with Dig Your Own Hole.  Acrid Avid Jam Shred was the first track by Richard that I listened to all they way through. From there I was hooked."

In fact, if something costs money and I end up not liking it, I regret the purchase, so there's nothing bu t down side for me. I buy the albums of any band I like though, knowing that if I don't, I'm encouraging them not to make new albums again any time soon."
aphextwin,3aw12g,stoatflip,9,Thu Jun 25 01:03:42 2015 UTC,"I actually kind of agree.  Not that I don't think that some of the Soundcloud tracks aren't awesome, but I'm finding it hard to rummage through all these tracks when my preconceived notion is that they are just some tunes from his computer that he didn't think were good enough to release on an album.  When there is so much material available, I find that it becomes harder to motivate yourself to listen.  Especially when the majority of the songs aren't in an album format.  Again, not saying some of the tracks posted aren't great, but I definitely get at what he is saying, and I'm happy that he might perhaps release an album full of great material properly mastered."

I'm starting to get used to certain songs as ""the opening track of the album"" or ""the album closer"" (Human Rotation has a great ""last track"" feel, and ssbA is a great opener).  Also I love the 45 minutes of material he released on May 5th. Not sure if it was an intentional ""May 5th Mix"" or just lucky accident, but it sounds great.

Sorry for being a thorn, but lots of us have properly deciphered the majority of the tracks into their respective timelines adjoining to eps and lps.

aphextwin,3asa2c,addking,7,Tue Jun 23 02:39:02 2015 UTC,"Ventolin EP released a month prior to ...I Care Because You Do, features Ventolin and what is marked as various mixes of  the track. In reality it's like the 'On remixes' in that the remixes aren't new versions of Ventolin in the traditional sense but other tracks using a similiar set-up.   01 Salbutamol with it's high piercing noise, metallic percussion, and looped keyboard melody leads of this EP. Sounds like the album version from ICBYD but is longer.   02 Praze An Beeble has some modulated percussive sounds and a break of effect laden laughing as the bridge.  03 Marazanvose  has bouncey sounding drums and acid squidges along with some cymbals set the beat, it ends with breath-y vox freakout.   04 Plain An Gwarry features a horn sample and jazzy beat as the main bits, a keyboard melody plays across the top.  Strings come in later.   05 Coppice Mix has a playful almost child-like keyboard melody.  06 Crowsmengegus has two parts an intro of sorts with metallic percussion and acid squidges and after the break a more traditional drum beat layered with keys and a flute like line. It ends with some shout-outs.   Like 'On' - this EP was accompanied by a remix EP (part 2 of 2 in the UK)  01 Wheeze mostly sounds like a heavily filtered version of the Salbutamol Mix, featuring some keyboard stabs and a  melody that don't appear in the original mix.   02 Carharrack a skittering drum beat and some whistle like noises in this one along with some keyboard hits and cymbals.   03 Probus has another more playful melody, it's got an almost floating feeling.   04 Cylob Mix - Remixed by Chris Jeffs, it's keyboards over what sounds like a dot matrix printer.   05 Deep Gong Mix - Remixed by Luke Vibert, slow dubby effects loopy wtih a hip hop beat.   06 Asthma Beats starts with a piano and drum bit that have some effects on them. It's a short closer to the EP."

Analord was named such due to the fact he has an overwhelming sense of pride in his anal sex ability.  The track Father from Drukqs is actually named after his father. I know, I couldn't believe it at first either.  On (u-ziq Mix) is named after u-ziq.  I don't really want to explain the reason behind the title Come to Daddy. I'll let you figure that one out.

aphextwin,3aglv8,tompalombo,5,Sat Jun 20 02:27:38 2015 UTC,Track 10 is one of my favourite Aphex Twin tracks.
aphextwin,3aglv8,CentreForAnts,2,Sat Jun 20 09:48:39 2015 UTC,I'd like to find out how to make the tone of melody that comes in at about the 0:43. I've heard other people use it as well and that sound really gets my attention every time.
aphextwin,3aglv8,technotomato,6,Mon Jun 22 03:19:27 2015 UTC,"This album is great.  It might not be ground breaking material, but the melodies on many of the tracks are super catchy and fun to listen to."
aphextwin,3aglv8,DICE821,6,Sat Jun 20 14:09:14 2015 UTC,Does anyone know how the album got leaked in the first place?
aphextwin,3aglv8,21we4,5,Sun Jun 21 01:22:40 2015 UTC,"I thought the Jan 1st 2000 posting of it on one of the biggest Aphex Twin fansites was the original leak, although I've since heard that at least 12 different people ""in the industry"" had it before that. Not the people he was sending it to mind you, friends of his and admins of fan sites. I've actually been counting it as a 2000 album because of that leak although now I'm wondering.  That posting getting taken down by Richard's record company's lawyers is what people pointed to as proof that it really was him."
aphextwin,3aglv8,WildBluntHickok,6,Sun Jun 21 03:09:12 2015 UTC,"He gave some copies to a couple of his friends, if I remember right, and somehow it ended up surfacing on some fan website when Rephlex contacted them to take it down"
aphextwin,3aglv8,MyNameIsPraxin,5,Sun Jun 21 03:07:36 2015 UTC,Track 11 is one of my favorite Aphex Twin tunes.
aphextwin,3aglv8,taklabas,5,Sat Jun 20 12:11:51 2015 UTC,Great little release.  Very unique.  I'm very excited that he allegedly kept going back to rework this in the 2000s and it simply got longer and longer.  I'd pick up a monster many-LP reworking of these tracks in a heartbeat.
aphextwin,3aglv8,chivesberry,8,Sat Jun 20 18:12:27 2015 UTC,"The only unreleased LP on the review list, Melodies From Mars is confirmed as RDJ work. He claims to have re-done the album in 2007, but this version is from 1995. The tracks official names are unknown - but there are early versions of Fingerbib and Logan Rock Witch from the Richard D. James Album. This 12 track release was new to me in 2014.   Track 1: Featuring an almost carnival style keys and almost a honking noise.   Fingerbib (Demo): Longer than the RDJ LP appearance, not quite as polished and a bit more meandering.    Track 3: Organlike keys, a single booming kick, and guitar riff.  Track 4: Clicky beats, and a more classic SAW-ish melody then palatte swapping back and forth to a more tonal section.  Track 5: Music for a cartoon about industrial assemble lines. Wheezing tones and heavy thudding, late in the track joined by  a jolly keyboard jaunt.    Track 6: Similiar in structure to Sloth from AB4 with a repeating annoying tone but includes bright upbeat keyboard section.  Track 7: Almost chip-tune like, upbeat and uptempo.   Logan Rock Witch (Demo): Also longer than the RDJ LP appearance, the slide-whistles, main keyboard line, and toy sounding  percussion, and church organ breakdown are all in tact and present.    Track 9: Wood blocks and some offkilter keys, but following a pretty straight forward verse/chorus pop song structure.  Track 10: A short blippy loop with clicky drums, with a chip-tune like break. The main melody is reminescent of some of his other tracks, but like Track 9, follows and almost pop song structure this time including a bridge.  Track 11: Watery keyboards and a much faster tempo set this apart from it's brethren. Includes another ringing tone almost  in the annoying range. Makes me think of a jungle version of a video game soundtrack.   Track 12: The plucked strings from Boy/Girl Song are joined by an ominous organ for the album's finale."
aphextwin,3aglv8,giantrobot503,3,Sat Jun 20 00:05:20 2015 UTC,"Track 9 is my personal favorite. A quintessential ""happy"" Aphex track in my opinion."
aphextwin,3aglv8,EamonnMR,2,Tue Jun 23 04:29:52 2015 UTC,"One of two incredibly important albums in watching the development of RDJ's style that he's never been interviewed about. There are parts that are very reminiscent of ICBYD (esp tracks with the on/ventolin/ICBYD percussion), but a style that is overall very unique (though we can hear plenty of similar ones on soundcloud-ie the melody in 70s Tune). It's one of his most focused albums (up there with SAWII, HAB and Syro, but I can't figure out what the core concept is. A friend described track 9 it as ""like a broken toy""  Really, I guess what I'm saying is MfM is a bunch of unanswered riddles. I can only hope that if/when he drops the final version (I'm holding out hope since we haven't seen any MFM references on soundcloud) someone asks the interesting questions."
aphextwin,3aglv8,joycrue,-12,Wed Jun 24 15:03:31 2015 UTC,why review an unreleased..? this is disgraceful.
aphextwin,3aglv8,joycrue,8,Sat Jun 20 10:23:19 2015 UTC,"Disgraceful? That's funny. In no way does it damage RDJ's reputation or cast any shadow on his 'works'.   Folks have reviewed demo and/or non-professional releases for as long as there have been recordings. How else does one determine what is worth releasing?   I'm not concerned about it on a personal level as I'm not a professional, and I'm not getting paid for it. I'll review the soundcloud tracks exactly the same way.   But mostly I posted it because it's on the discussion list - which I didn't make. But it's a well known unreleased recording so I don't see why it couldn't be included."
aphextwin,3aglv8,munkomanko,-10,Sat Jun 20 11:43:25 2015 UTC,"so if you were a musician and someone leaked a copy of your unreleased, how would you feel? i'd be fucking pissed.  respect the artist."
aphextwin,3aglv8,MyNameIsPraxin,7,Sat Jun 20 16:47:15 2015 UTC,"well richard has actually talked about certain tracks off melodies from mars on soundcloud, and amicably at that, so i doubt he's pissed"
aphextwin,3aglv8,joycrue,6,Sat Jun 20 22:11:34 2015 UTC,"Depends on context - attempting to determine 'how I'd feel' is a bit of folly since I'm not in that position. But since I'm a fan of demo recordings and alternate takes we might not have the same feelings on the matter.   In this particular case - 2 songs off this have already been released officially on the RDJ LP, and a handful of them used in animated videos. It's highly unlikely we'll get a release that sounds like this, when we do get what RDJ considers the final release.  I didn't leak this, upload it, profit off it, or have anything else to do with it's distribution - I simply linked to someone's youtube account with 35k plays uploaded 7 years ago for purposes of discussion only.   It's clear you have your own opinion on this review, so I'll leave it at that."
aphextwin,3aglv8,MyNameIsPraxin,3,Sat Jun 20 23:31:02 2015 UTC,"Look at all the compliments people here are giving about the album, that doesn't seem very disrespectful to me at all, in fact quite the opposite. Sure if you're a money hungry piece of shit you could look at things like this and think ""fuck I could have made millions of dollars on top of the millions I already have from all this music"" or you could appreciate the fact that people are enjoying this music you've created, regardless of whether or not you made money from it. I'm not saying that this deserved to be leaked and people should just steal and pirate all his music or whatever, because it didn't and they shouldn't, but it happened and there's nothing we can do to erase the fact it did so we may as well appreciate the music, on top of supporting the artist as intended."
aphextwin,3ag4kk,TheDankula,15,Fri Jun 19 21:33:00 2015 UTC,"SAW 2 Didn't even have names, so there's that too. I think he's purposely made a lot of his track names gibberish so they seem far less 'accessible' because he hates being mainstream and popular from the looks of things. Its funny how its kind of a staple of 'IDM' to have ridiculously abstract album titles nowadays."
aphextwin,3ag4kk,MyNameIsPraxin,4,Fri Jun 19 21:56:38 2015 UTC,SAW 2 had names. They were just pictures instead of words.
aphextwin,3ag4kk,WildBluntHickok,7,Sun Jun 21 03:06:35 2015 UTC,"Well I mean if you look at it that way then there's the 'fan-made' names based off the pictures, but technically speaking all these tracks don't have any 'official' names (minus blue calx of course), so I still consider them to be name-less. Although I actually do use the fan made names whenever I talk about the tracks lol."
aphextwin,3ag4kk,MyNameIsPraxin,6,Sun Jun 21 03:12:12 2015 UTC,"Richard does too, according to the SoundCloud comments"
aphextwin,3ag4kk,SlobKelly,6,Mon Jun 22 00:23:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and the orchestral version of Rhubarb from Syrobonkers was actually labelled 'Rhubarb'"
aphextwin,3ag4kk,michaelt4,14,Mon Jun 22 10:33:21 2015 UTC,I would guess that the Syro track names are just how he names his untitled tracks so that he can remember how he made them.
aphextwin,3ag4kk,Sexy_Grandpa,12,Fri Jun 19 23:31:30 2015 UTC,"It's been going that way with a lot of electronic music. Well, with Autechre at least."
aphextwin,3ag4kk,ArtsNCrass,10,Fri Jun 19 22:39:37 2015 UTC,"The names on Syro and soundcloud (for the most part) are part of the creative process, it's the original names from Richard's hard drive. The gibberish comes together when he is experimenting with something on different tracks and he just types so he can save it as new copy."
aphextwin,3ag4kk,Audioverstaerker,5,Sat Jun 20 02:23:07 2015 UTC,"Actually some of the names on soundcloud are friends' names for the songs, because the DAT tape they had of the tracks was the only surviving copy and Richard can't remember his original names. Lannerlush had a note mentioning that it was Luke Vibert (Wagon Christ)'s name for the track, and I'd swear he said some of the others were Mike (µ-Ziq)'s names."
aphextwin,3ag4kk,WildBluntHickok,9,Sun Jun 21 03:04:46 2015 UTC,"Obviously there are exceptions, but he wants the music to speak for itself without giving the listener any preconceptions based on the tracks title."
aphextwin,3ag4kk,Jimmy_Pineapple,6,Fri Jun 19 23:00:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think the titles have gotten more corrupted over time, but you're onto something. I've always gotten the vibe that digital corruption is where Richard draws the inspiration for a lot of song titles. That and he seems to get a kick out of simple nonsense."
aphextwin,3ag4kk,Rossegut,3,Fri Jun 19 22:07:59 2015 UTC,"SAW 2 did not have normal names because most normal albums don't have pictures as track titles.  Several of the names on RDJ are actual place names in Cornwall.  The SYRO track titles aren't complete gibberish: they're named after the gear that was used in the track, with the exception of a few (like XMAS_EVET10, which has an obvious meaning).  Now if you made this argument for Autechre instead, it would be much more valid."
aphextwin,3ae544,KennyLoginz,5,Fri Jun 19 11:28:38 2015 UTC,I remember reading this a few months ago..its amazing.
aphextwin,3ae544,rd1994,8,Fri Jun 19 11:51:08 2015 UTC,"""One of the later remixes he did for cash was a limp Lemonheads song, he didn’t bother listening to the track, just pulled some random tune from his enormous stockpile. He told the record company that he’d compressed their entire song in to the sound of a hi hat!""     That's brilliant."
aphextwin,3ae544,Machinebummer,2,Fri Jun 19 15:13:44 2015 UTC,"The funny thing is he's rereleased some of them for the soundcloud, then when fans point it out he goes ""oh damn I didn't realize I had already released this""."

aphextwin,3abnep,hexagon__sun,5,Fri Jun 19 22:40:56 2015 UTC,Would not say it's underrated. Earth Portal mix was a classic the moment Syro dropped. Sounds very much like his older stuff. Did you skip over this one?
aphextwin,3abnep,SlobKelly,3,Thu Jun 18 23:40:57 2015 UTC,"Took a while, but this became my favorite track"
aphextwin,3abnep,MrWaterblu,3,Thu Jun 18 21:52:43 2015 UTC,"I'd say there's a lot of underrated tracks on Syro. 4 bit is a great track, both CYRCLONT tracks, syro u473t8+e, papat4 (ex-Singapore track) is fantastic and it doesn't get much love it seems. And MARCHROMT30A certainly is great too. Syro grows on you, it takes a bit of time."
aphextwin,3abnep,hexagon__sun,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:37:06 2015 UTC,papat4 is the Syro headliner imo. Such a large track I feel like it gets overlooked for being too perfect- with regards to the albums palette of sounds being so pristine and sutured. I wish it was 10 minutes long.
aphextwin,3abnep,Matafoqana,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:28:57 2015 UTC,"First track I fell in love with on the album I think. One of those tracks that makes me feel so spoiled just be listening to it, thanks rich!"

Where Syro goes a bit Jungle :)  Also loved PAPAT4, which didn't seem to pop up much in Syro discussions either.  The thing about most of this album is that it's SO non-repetitive that it really does take awhile to get into it and appreciate what's going on in each song.  There are parts that get stuck in my head where I think, ""OH I love that bit -- but what song is it on?!""   Like the little bass line around 2:38 in this song."

aphextwin,39zlsg,methyo,2,Thu Jun 18 12:04:24 2015 UTC,"Analogue Bubblebath 5 (CAT 034)  Nine untitled tracks (with the exception of track 9 also included on AB4 as Cuckoo). Thanks to Rephlex for mailing out 20 of these to AFX fans who didn't get their Analord 10 copies on time and the dude who ripped it in FLAC =). New to me in 2014.  A1/01: A fairly bouncy beat, and nice strings open this whooping 9 minute number.It's later joined by a bit of a goofy synth line and other string section loops. The final minutes contain the bouncy beat and a number of effects.   A2/02: RDJ uploaded an alternate mix of this track featuring more pronounced bass hits as ""21 Hapshifter1"" - Opening with a glitchy kind of beat and a descending melody, it alternates that section with another slightly goofy kind of synth line.   A3/03: 37 seconds of what sounds like a snowy walk in the woods.   A4/04: Like a drum and bass song on the wrong speed - It's just beats, a bit of percussion, and a bouncy little line coupled with a touch of keys that sound just 'off' enough to add a touch of sinister.   A5/05: A skippy almost jazzy beat, that doesn't break until 2 mins in, accompanied by an a squidge. Tasty if minimal.    B1/06: Opening the B-side this track harkens back to AB3 in tone and features a mid-section of 'expert' knob twiddling and experimentation that continues til the end.   B2/07: Sorta flabby sounding noises and really nice but quiet synth washes, and some hollow sounding electronic drum hits.  B3/08: Like some of the AB3 tracks it's got both grain-y noisier drums, some odd reed-y sounds, and some orchestral stabs. I think it's pretty nice by the end, but there's some odd moments on along the way.   B4/Cuckoo: As on AB4."

aphextwin,39ncz5,addking,5,Fri Jun 12 23:50:18 2015 UTC,"Analogue Bubblebath 4 features 5 untitled tracks. Going by the fan given names here. The first three cuts appear to be basically club bangers for his DJ sets.   Elephant Song: What actually sounds like a fan screaming 'Woo' is apparently close enough to an elephant. =/  Otherwise it's a looped drum beat with the occasional pause and a couple noise wipes, until the final minute where some additional effects rear their head ever so briefly.  Cuckoo: Rephlex actually called the track by this name on their website at one point - it's full got some bird noises,  churning keyboards, and a fairly dancey beat. Ending with the Cuckoo noise.   Gibbon: Percusive beats, brief blurbs, and key stabs. Interesting outro riff.   Sloth: Laid back but extremely quiet track with a blip every 3 seconds - self sabotage of what sounded like an almost commercial cut?   Knievel: A few lines an interview with the daredevil himself, garbled up."

aphextwin,39rhfw,AMBULANCES,-15,Sun Jun 14 04:35:23 2015 UTC,"make your own clothing   thats literally what im fucking doing though, go ahead and try to find an aphex twin shirt just like any of them! also, just because im making shirts that are aphex twin themed doesnt fucking mean im ripping off his image. Im a huge fan of his, so im making my own shirts for him."

aphextwin,39rhfw,Windowlicker79,3,Sun Jun 14 13:34:56 2015 UTC,This is actually a trademark violation.
aphextwin,39rhfw,rd1994,3,Mon Jun 15 19:14:16 2015 UTC,Did you get a license from him to produce them? Are you paying him royalties on each t-shirt sold? If not then you are stealing money straight out of his wallet.
aphextwin,39rhfw,hexagon__sun,-4,Mon Jun 15 13:33:51 2015 UTC,"not really, im more just donating money to charity for selling t shirts with a picture of his face. thats it, theres no way im 'stealing money from his wallet' at all  its not like hes making the shirts or the design, other people are. I'll sound like a total twat for saying this but here goes: he doesnt deserve the money that will come from the shirts. I dont know how to say it in any other way.  Just because im using his face doesnt mean he deserves any of the money coming from the shirts. HBA uses his face on one of their shitts and he doesnt get money every time they sell one does he?"
aphextwin,39rhfw,addking,4,Mon Jun 15 16:54:47 2015 UTC,I don't see any aphex clothing here.

aphextwin,39rhfw,MadRichard_SadJive,5,Mon Jun 15 16:50:51 2015 UTC,What charities do you donate to?
aphextwin,39rhfw,squijy,3,Mon Jun 15 19:17:01 2015 UTC,"Eh, not my thing. I'd be more likely to just pick up a logo t-shirt. Doesn't Warp license those thru Bleep?"
aphextwin,39rhfw,squijy,6,Sun Jun 14 05:23:19 2015 UTC,88 dollars for a hoodie? I'll pass.
aphextwin,39rhfw,squijy,-11,Sun Jun 14 04:04:12 2015 UTC,"Its the website, not us. It gives you a fixed price for whatever you want to design..."
aphextwin,39rhfw,hexagon__sun,-6,Sun Jun 14 04:09:50 2015 UTC,yeah its definitely bootleg shit  but i still approve though cause its good design  gets my stamp of approval
aphextwin,39rhfw,Immobilise,-14,Sun Jun 14 01:45:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your feedback, the prices are fixed by the website team, not us. We arent allowed to change the price to something suitable.  This isnt 'bootleg', its just fan-made clothing. You dont have to buy it, we just wanted to show them."
aphextwin,39rhfw,methyo,2,Sun Jun 14 01:57:13 2015 UTC,"as someone who creates tee shirt graphics for a living, you are going about this all wrong. if you are trying to just ""show"" people your shirts then make a photoblog...tumbler...instagram... but dont put em up on some site thats going to price and sell them in a way that you cant control. It looks like you are trying to establish a brand. you should really have a personal website for that. it will help them look more professional and make them more desirable. Theres plenty of ways to set up personal online stores... big cartel...squarespace... The fact that you are using all this aphex imagery and then seeing such a high price, on what looks to be a service that you yourself cant even provide, is very offputting. If PAOM.COM wasnt a resource for you, could you still produce these garments?"
aphextwin,39rhfw,methyo,-3,Sun Jun 14 04:12:49 2015 UTC,"No, they make them for me and deliver them. I just create the design.  There isnt any other websites that provide someone to make a fully-printed shirt, all of them are just shitty ones that only allow you to put a small square image in the middle of your shirt.  Me and my friend just doing this for fun really, i only get 20% of the payment and the money i get then goes to charity and not to my wallet because i like to help others instead of keeping the money for myself."
aphextwin,39rhfw,MadRichard_SadJive,2,Sun Jun 14 16:11:04 2015 UTC,"doesnt change the fact that most people are having a bad experience. and thats your fault. if you really want to put your brand out there like this, you have to roll with the punches. I am not surprised at all by the reaction."
aphextwin,39rhfw,MrWaterblu,-7,Sun Jun 14 16:16:03 2015 UTC,"yeah i know, i was even being nice to most of the negative posts but the fact that theyre still being total cunts and downvoting me for nothing after ive responded positively is completely fucked."
aphextwin,39rhfw,MrWaterblu,2,Sun Jun 14 16:21:51 2015 UTC,"also, nowhere on that site does it say anything about donating to a charity. you might want to add that into the description of your brand. right now, the ONLY way for someone else to know that you are donating profits is if they come into this thread...you probably dont want that happening. Seems like the only thing you have done well here is create a horrible user experience around your clothing ""brand"". as for the actual designs...there is no substance, you said it yourself..."
aphextwin,39rhfw,MrWaterblu,-5,Sun Jun 14 16:51:54 2015 UTC,"no, i donate to charity myself, not paom...  EDIT: read that wrong sorry, yeah i'll put that in the desc"

Btw only multiples of 2 produce in-tune notes. Anything else and the notes aren't from the modern chromatic scale. Not that there's anything wrong with that...  Also why is the filesize so huge? Most people upload compressed audio, not files the size of wavs."

aphextwin,39363k,olbeefy,3,Tue Jun 9 14:40:30 2015 UTC,Which is exactly what i thought last night (GMT) when Richard made them downloadable.

aphextwin,39363k,Nobodyactually,2,Wed Jun 17 23:47:41 2015 UTC,user48736353001 eventually became user18081971 (RDJ's birthday).
aphextwin,39363k,Nobodyactually,2,Thu Jun 18 07:31:45 2015 UTC,But it has the same tracks?
aphextwin,39363k,SlobKelly,2,Thu Jun 18 15:25:16 2015 UTC,"On soundcloud you can change your user name without losing any of the content. So, yes, the tracks are same."
aphextwin,394aji,addking,5,Tue Jun 9 03:56:25 2015 UTC,"Released in 1994, but 'Retrieved from Warp Archives 1990.' the GAK ep is reported to be the demo sent to Warp prior to them signing RDJ. We've since gotten at least two other GAK tracks from the soundcloud dump - 21 gak police & 22 gak bass.  Possibly my least favorite RDJ release we've covered so far and compared to other tracks recorded in what's reported to be this time period, just sounds a bit lackluster to me. The B-side (tracks 3 and 4) is much stronger than the A-side.    GAK 1 6:40 - featuring a couple piano chords played over a mostly straightforward beat, it's not until around the 5 minute mark do we get some layering and a little more variation.   GAK 2 6:18 - Mid-tempo drumming and a few ponging effects with some additional keys around 4:45.   GAK 3 5:26 - More uptempo than either of the A-side tracks, and catchier if still straight-forward.  GAK 4 6:04 - A stronger beat, and a quite lively keyboard hook really help out."
aphextwin,394aji,motherstep,2,Tue Jun 9 03:57:19 2015 UTC,"I am quite fond of GAK despite the criticisms that it's rather skeletal and isn't as complex as other EPs of his released at around the same time. GAK was one of the first EPs I got hold of that was released under a different name to his usual Aphex Twin/AFX output, so I think I have a particular fondness for that. I remember the first rip of it I acquired was so poorly done it tainted it slightly, so I was delighted to find a higher quality copy a few years later. I won't do track specifics like others, but I'll just say you can really hear distinctions between Richard's varying aliases here, but without losing that ""yeah, it's definitely him"" vibe.  Just to add, a blog on Tumblr called Fifty Two Weeks Of Richard D. James has been posting reviews and first impressions from some releases, mostly chronological and they wrote about what they thought about GAK fairly recently. It's always interesting to read what people think both at first when they hear something new and something they're familiar with."

Nothing special, but pretty cool for 18-year-old Rich. If only Gak Bass was on this release. That high-pitched TB-303 sound is awesome."

See if you put it at half speed it just sounds like a slow version of the original but at 1/3rd speed it pushes it far enough to sound different.

aphextwin,38rucm,happyguyxlii,2,Sat Jun 13 12:34:48 2015 UTC,"Damn, it wasn't my username."
aphextwin,38rucm,rd1994,3,Sat Jun 13 13:04:39 2015 UTC,Yes.
aphextwin,38rucm,MyNameIsPraxin,5,Mon Jun 8 18:35:01 2015 UTC,"What's the huge appeal of throwing a track into Audacity and pitching it down or paulstretching it or whatever? I don't get it. Most of the time it just sounds like crap, I mean there are a couple that sound somewhat decent slowed down, but can't you just listen to it at the intended speed? Or is that too boring? I've heard people say it brings out subtleties but I don't really see how when it's pitched down by 1000 semitones, completely warping it out of its original sound."
aphextwin,38rucm,chivesberry,7,Sat Jun 6 11:36:16 2015 UTC,The 1000% slowdowns are a touch overboard but you can effectively double RDJ's catalog if you own it on vinyl.  Some of the different speeds sound better than the original versions.  RDJ has openly admitted to this being true.
aphextwin,38rucm,MyNameIsPraxin,4,Sat Jun 6 18:11:32 2015 UTC,"33RPM versions are okay, but yeah I mostly just meant the huge paulstretched 16 hour long versions"
aphextwin,38rucm,Chemistride,5,Sat Jun 6 23:02:25 2015 UTC,It's cool playing a 45 rpm at 33 rpm. But I definitely agree that it usually sounds stupid slowing down an MP3 file.
aphextwin,38rucm,THREAD_SHITTER,5,Sat Jun 6 19:08:52 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. The vinyl of CCAIP2 is marked '33 or 45', though (33 being representative of the cd/digital versions)."
aphextwin,38rucm,cellarmonkey,4,Sat Jun 6 20:52:13 2015 UTC,"I agree. Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should, necessarily. Just listen to it the way is."
aphextwin,38rucm,SlobKelly,5,Sat Jun 6 15:24:55 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the ""warped"" sound and it's easier for me to notice some of the subtleties. Plus I love DJ Screw."
aphextwin,38rucm,situLight,3,Sat Jun 6 20:16:33 2015 UTC,"Have you ever listened to a song, and you sort of wish it just went on forever?. Rather than just playing a piece over and over, creating a slowed + looped version is a different way to enjoy it  Stretching using Paulstretch for example - it doesn't change the pitch or warp it especially. Most songs without any real pronounced 'edges' will stretch into very good sounding ambient pieces, with only a single button press.   This sort of music is a different genre, and maybe attracts different people. But it does have strong appeal. Tracks or albums such as this stand up on their own two feet, and are likely produced in a similar way, albeit with a little more effort.   Slowing or stretching an RDJ track produces music of that genre, and very good music at that. If you love the original, but wish you could hear a longer version of it.   Because many tracks have a mathematical symmetry to it, stretching and looping over itself in factors of 2,4 or 8, creates natural harmonies and retains the musical structure of the original, but keeps it novel as it loops over itself.   These tracks I made all are like that, and I was surprised by how good they sounded, and how easy they were to make. I recommend the 'Blue Calx Ambient+++ (meaning it has the original looped over the top of it) if you are looking to try one.   That being said, I too don't really 'get' slowing tracks, aside from the novelty of it."
aphextwin,38rucm,MyNameIsPraxin,2,Sun Jun 7 04:16:11 2015 UTC,"So you're just turning a track into a super long ambient drone essentially? It still seems like a really strange concept to me, I mean you could just go listen to some ambient music instead?"
aphextwin,38rucm,situLight,4,Sun Jun 7 05:14:04 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. But without dragging it out hugely, its still recognisable and not so different to the original. Especially with the original on top, its surprisingly similar, but different."
aphextwin,38rucm,MyNameIsPraxin,3,Sun Jun 7 06:42:36 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, if it still somewhat resembles the original track while putting a fresh take on it at the same time I can understand it, I still just have a huge quarrel with the completely out of key pitch-down versions tho"
aphextwin,38rucm,happyguyxlii,3,Sun Jun 7 06:52:59 2015 UTC,"Idk, i just like the way it sounds."

aphextwin,38rbwj,SlateFx,6,Sat Jun 6 20:20:36 2015 UTC,"I always remember the 1/483 data on the first track he uploaded on the Aphex Twin soundcloud whenever anyone says that it might be ended. He's been on longer breaks before, I'm sure hes got tons more tracks to upload, not that we haven't been spoiled beyond belief these last few months. :)"
aphextwin,38rbwj,breathethisair,4,Sat Jun 6 04:15:02 2015 UTC,"Imagine if he actually does release ALL those tracks, holy shit. We wouldn't even be halfway through yet. Part of me REALLY wants this to keep going, to relive the excitement of refreshing his Soundcloud page every 2 minutes to a bunch of new music, but at the same time I think there's already so much to go through as it is and putting more up would just be completely overwhelming. I've only really listened to 100 or so of these all the way through more then once honestly, and while there are definitely some amazing tracks in here, some of them are honestly pretty eh."
aphextwin,38rbwj,Chemistride,2,Sat Jun 6 04:31:58 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more. I wonder if the end of uploads has anything to do with this article about his lost mp3 player, considering it had 236 tracks and he stopped uploading at 228. I know it was dismissed as an April Fool's joke, but was there ever any confirmation that it was indeed a joke? Quite a co-incidence that number of tracks tho."
aphextwin,38rbwj,addking,3,Sat Jun 6 12:10:01 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't he say in that 9 page interview in 2001 that he only lost the iPod and not the master tracks?"

aphextwin,38rbwj,TheJaguar77,-1,Mon Jun 8 21:31:51 2015 UTC,Yes. Watmm NEEDED to have these tracks pressed to CD (because yk people HAVE to have a physical copy of everything) and RDJ cut off the uploads at the same time. Thanks Watmm!

aphextwin,38rbwj,TheJaguar77,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:49:50 2015 UTC,Nah. I'm calling bullshit. There was a steady flow of uninterrupted tracks until this shit came up.
aphextwin,38rbwj,addking,3,Sat Jun 6 18:37:54 2015 UTC,"Some people mentioned it, Richard suggested a poll, someone (in conjunction with Richard) set up the poll. The poll is dynamic so that you can change votes and so that new tunes can be added if/when he uploads them. I mean if you want to talk about physical releases it was Richard's idea to have people make SOSW2 playlists for him, with a view to having it physically released. He even said (about the 36 track SOSW2 playlist) ""list not complete, might add from tracks already on SC or from the archives""   It might be six months, it might be a year, I don't think he's done yet.  He's still pretty active comments-wise (and very recently enabled ""Nightmail 1"" for download), and mentioned already that he was nowhere near his 'Drukqs' era tunes. That's not to say he'll definitely upload them, but I'm positive enough."
aphextwin,38rbwj,TheJaguar77,0,Sat Jun 6 18:57:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying he wont upload more at some point. But the flow has definitely stopped for the time being because someone felt that these tracks must be released on CD, as a result RDJ must have though 'ok nows a good time to stop, the fans MUST want these on CD instead of as uploads'. Follows pretty obv here. Soundcloud uploads weren't good enough for some people, so now he's going to accommodate, put breaks on SC uploads and weight the time / effort of releasing CDs."

aphextwin,38rbwj,TheJaguar77,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:59:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah got that, but he has only upped one song since the poll started. I don't think that's a coincidence. He hit the brakes to see what would happen."

My problem is when other people are messing with his flow. No one should feel a need to insert themselves into what he is doing, clearly what is happening here."
aphextwin,38rbwj,rhombuspuller,2,Sun Jun 7 01:22:32 2015 UTC,"""Clearly"" Richard is pretty capable of thinking and acting for himself, allowing people to ""insert themselves into what he is doing"" at his discretion and managing his ""flow"" in a way that he sees fit, no? Who knows if the dump has stopped? Noone here, presumably. It's as likely to be as a result of the changes to SoundCloud or his contractual/publishing obligations with Chrysalis than anything to do with WATMM (where he has been known to post from time to time) or the poll."

aphextwin,38e593,WildBluntHickok,3,Wed Jun 3 17:26:50 2015 UTC,"welp, guess that means I can't make podcasts, play those tracks at a public venue, or get that classical chamber music ensemble cover of 101 Rainbows I've always wanted.   I guess this is a step forward to the eventual SoundCloud record release and first move towards curbing free usage outside of SC.  Now does this mean that what's listed in the BMI entry is the total set of works RDJ is going to post? How easy is it to append new works to their database?"
aphextwin,38e593,breathethisair,2,Wed Jun 3 18:00:11 2015 UTC,"It's pretty easy by the looks of it, the songs are registered online and appear in the BMI Repertoire Catalog almost immediately, so it shouldn't, in theory, interfere with any potential future uploads. And I'm guessing that those are still going to happen at some point. Richard has told people in comments that he'd have to hunt out certain songs to upload and that he wasn't anywhere near his Drukqa-era tracks. The only thing he did say he wouldn't upload was stuff from the past ten years, or maybe it was seven I can't remember."
aphextwin,38e593,WildBluntHickok,2,Wed Jun 3 20:44:35 2015 UTC,"Seven would be the era that Syro covers, which is totally reasonable. Everything before the ""gap"" in releases would be fine then."
aphextwin,38e593,breathethisair,2,Wed Jun 3 22:46:16 2015 UTC,"I think syro is more 2005 era, but some of it could indeed be the past 7 years."
aphextwin,38e593,WildBluntHickok,2,Thu Jun 4 06:08:34 2015 UTC,"When Syro came out he mentioned it was various songs from the past 7 years, which is why it doesn't seem cutting edge. 2005 would be Analord era (although that's when it came out not when it was written). Also if Syro covers 2008-2014 then it makes it the ""post-Tuss"" era."
aphextwin,38e593,olbeefy,2,Thu Jun 4 18:41:20 2015 UTC,"Idk m8, there's a few recordings of Rich's live sets before 2007 where he plays these tracks. There's a couple in this 2005 set in austria and even vibert played minipops in his 07 manchester set."

aphextwin,38ga0b,Chemistride,2,Thu Jun 4 00:39:13 2015 UTC,"Might that be referring to the demo version of the Analogue Bubblebath 4 album? I always thought that was the album that people called Analogue Bubblebath 5 later but I never heard confirmation that they were the same thing. 4.5 could mean 4demo, and there's a few albums where we refer to the tracks by album name followed by track number (AB5-08 for example).  Or maybe I'm barking up the wrong tree here..."

aphextwin,38apb6,Ning50,7,Wed Jun 3 00:05:47 2015 UTC,"Flutey has so much personality, beautifully crafted. More killer tracks from 1994, it really was his best year."
aphextwin,38apb6,SlateFx,6,Wed Jun 3 01:56:06 2015 UTC,"Released only thru the perserverance of the fan base, spearheaded by the WATMM forum's official contacts and Minecraft's 'Notch'. we got a pretty decent copy of this famously unreleased 2xLP. Slated for a 1994 release, fans got their copies in 2014. Interestingly enough at the LP break there is a noticable difference in tone of the tracks - the 2nd LP features a few mellow works, that I might not have pegged as Caustic Window related.   Flutey: This excellent mellow track, one of the longest on the record, serves as opener - ending on the titular flute riff.   Stomper 101mod Detunekik: Not quite as 'noisey' as the Joyrex tracks, a harder hitting beat is overlaided with a variety of noises.   Mumbly: One of my favorites, this is almost a kitchen sink sorta track - samples, pads, beats, noise, static, delays yet featuring a strong melodic keyboard hook.   Popeye: A short speedy, noisey affair, with an enjoyably goofy feel.   Fingertrips: Almost xylophonish keys joined with dirty beats, it reminds me of tracks like Xepha in feel.   Revpok: While parts of this could almost pass for a noise collage, it has a great keyboard riff featuring some ringing tones.  Afx Tribal Kik: A short hammering, with modulated voice over ending the first LP.   Airflow: Opening the 2nd LP is another track with a strong melodic piece, but in this case it's twisted around by the harsh elements surrounding it, before they relent and it returns for the exit.  Squidge In The Fridge: Acid lines, piano and almost throwback drum machine sounds color this track. It almost sounds like a throwback to SAW 85-92 era (and might well be...) it's most like Cordaliatron among CW tracks.   Fingry: Another fairly mellow number. Relaxing even.   Jazzphase: What it says on the tin - jazzy keys and slowly phased effects, pleasant but a bit forgettable.    101 Rainbows Ambient Mix: The longest track on the release, this looped keyboard workout floats along with minimal percussion. An early version of this track featuring drum and bass '5 Scorrier [101 Rainbows]' has been released on the soundcloud account.    Phlaps: And right as you begin to wonder if the 2nd LP was mislabelled, the return of the noise... Washes of static, cut-up sounding beats and some bleeping.   Cunt: The last 'proper' track on LP - We'd gotten another version of this during the John Peel '92 session - tagged as AFX6. It's a fast paced techno workout with some knob turning time stretching effects.   Phone Pranks: Scanner, Cylob, µ-Ziq and The Irresistible Force getting Jerky-Boy'd around."
aphextwin,38apb6,addking,3,Wed Jun 3 04:00:17 2015 UTC,"Note: Cunt and Phlaps were both released on compilations back in the day, and have been in my ""Aphex Twin misc"" folder since I first started collecting mp3s (1996?).  Also from what I remember hearing last year when this finally came out, the 5 copies printed were for Richard and the 4 people in the phone pranks track."

aphextwin,38apb6,methyo,2,Wed Jun 3 03:48:05 2015 UTC,"Really like this LP, think it was slept on when it was released as well as now. Its chalk full of pretty good to great acid and techno tracks. Standouts for me are Flutey, Mumbly, Fingertrips, and Airflow. 101 Rainbows, Cunt, and Squidge in the Fridge are also nice tracks. Popeye, AFX Tribal Kik, and Phone Pranks all could have been cut and the LP would be a lot stronger imo, but maybe he needed to fill space. Jazzphase is one of the tracks that doesnt sound like it belongs on a CW album along with Squidge, Fingry and 101 Rainbows. Its a nice track but forgetable. Rest of the tracks are pretty standard CW material with Phlaps being my least favorite on the LP as it's abrasive and repetitive, not much to offer. Overall i really like this LP, i think it doesn't get enough credit on here. Also to avoid confusion we should start putting ""Discussion"" in the post titles from now on."

aphextwin,387adz,jessek,3,Tue Jun 2 14:01:42 2015 UTC,"audiophile quality used to mean things like Original Master pressings, back in the days of analog tape, in the post digital age it's gotten pretty meaningless, especially for an album that was definitely recorded and mastered on a computer."
aphextwin,387adz,alxdy0y0,0,Tue Jun 2 16:55:18 2015 UTC,"Regardless of the medium from which it stems, better vinyl and better pressings do matter to the quality of the sounds recorded onto them - so that's my main concern: Getting the highest quality pressing."
aphextwin,387adz,jessek,0,Tue Jun 2 17:14:22 2015 UTC,"who is to say though that the 'extra limited' version was recorded and mastered fully analog while the 'major' release cd/extra vinyl were 'quickly' put together via computer/digital ? seems like a big hassle, but we all know RDJ likes hassle. plus throughout the years i've always heard that the 'non-audiophile' version sounds like shit anyways..."
aphextwin,387adz,alxdy0y0,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:05:44 2015 UTC,"If you honestly think that you have no idea how the vinyl records are made. The ""master"" tape is most likely a digital recording, RDJ is on the record for using both computers and DAT recorders in his process in the early 90s, so I'm going to guess that he most likely used them for Drukgs. There's no point in going digital -> analog -> etched varnish for LPs, you don't gain any of the wider frequency response that analog master tape would have and you lose a good deal of the digital master's information in such a transfer."
aphextwin,387adz,jessek,0,Tue Jun 2 18:17:36 2015 UTC,"all in all its only a possible chance that its firstly/only a 'digital recording'. RDJ is 'on record' for saying what you said above; but it was indeed a gradual 'shift'. OBV - ICBYD was mostly all analog, RDJ - completely computer - druqks---- well ain't that the million dollar question, mate? did he record all those breakbeats at half BPM fully 'analog' then speed em up? or did he record all those tracks at 160-180 bpm and sequence digitally? you tell me cuz i guess im a cunt."
aphextwin,387adz,alxdy0y0,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:12:31 2015 UTC,"you're mistaking the process for the recording master. He may have used analog tape effects, analog instruments, or anything really but he most likely recorded to a digital master. He certainly didn't transfer a digital master to analog for a limited press run of the LP. You don't really seem to understand this terminology very well."
aphextwin,387adz,alxdy0y0,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:37:09 2015 UTC,If it is just the number I might reconsider - but the info states that WARPLP92X is from 2002 and pressed in California. So it's after the standard edition box release (2001) and from a different pressing facility. Hmmm...
aphextwin,387adz,chivesberry,1 point,Wed Jun 3 02:14:50 2015 UTC,"This 'audiophile' option varies: This version could have been pressed on virgin vinyl AND on fresh vinyl pressers (google this if you need to). typically the first ~1000 copies pressed on virgin vinyl with a fresh vinyl pressure machine (+10k audio setup) WILL sound incredible and much more FRESH.   This requires more money from artist - company - label, etc, etc. Most vinyl pressed these days is on recycled vinyl and on old pressers + most production is done on computers + vst's, etc, so most vinyl just sounds like cd's..anyways....  Now, however, if every single variation of druqks are indeed ALL CD rips onto the vinyl i'd pass on it all, rather just have the box, haha and consider it a big fuck up by warp and i'd feel kinda scammed."
aphextwin,387adz,Stavorius,3,Wed Jun 3 02:29:47 2015 UTC,Box set is just a CD rip - not worth the cash at all.  the extra special kit is pressed on heavier plates and possibly features the actual polished DAT recordings transferred  onto black plates..... worth it....maybe...but much more $$$ and harder to find

aphextwin,380pjc,cellarmonkey,12,Mon Jun 1 15:48:14 2015 UTC,"I first heard Aphex about 16 years ago and it completely redefined my idea of what music is and can be. I was raised on all types of music from an early age- my father is a classical composer and guitarist, so I grew up listening to Bach and Villa-Lobos over scrambled eggs and toast every morning. I burned through phases of folk, jazz, blues, rock, shred, heavy metal, reggae & pop artists for all of my formative years like it was nothing- that is, until I discovered electronic music.  One Day, my cousin played some Prodigy for me and something clicked. This wasn't just a different kind of music that I was used to, it felt like a different art form! (Of course, the weed didn't hurt.. :). Anyway, not long after that, I discovered the Chemical Brothers. And then the Crystal Method (this is still the 90's), and other artists in that vein. But nothing- NOTHING- compared to Aphex Twin.   The first song I heard of his was 4 off the RDJ Album. My next door neighbor in my freshman college dorm threw the disc at me one day and said 'yeah, you might like this.' I felt physically ill trying to listen to it. It was repulsive. My brain refused to accept these sequenced sounds as 'music.' Frankly, it pissed me off; it made me very mad. It was like being slapped in the face. The constructions were so brazen, jagged and presumptuous, but on a purely visceral level. But then once it all sunk in, I couldn't stop thinking about it afterwards. It burrowed to the reptilian depths of my brain. I kept putting it back in my roommates' shitty 5-disc CD changer and re-examining the sounds. Over and over. And it was Fingerbib that really sold me. I was listening to the most hauntingly beautiful piece of music I had ever heard in my life, and yet it was so simple. Not long afterwards someone gave me a copy of SAW 85-92.  Needless to say, I became an Aphex junkie. I hunted down and devoured everything I could find. The initial bitterness of a lot of his works easily countertwined perfectly with his soft and sleepy ambient pieces and transformed his madness into sonic profiles that work for almost everything."
aphextwin,380pjc,SlateFx,8,Mon Jun 1 07:51:50 2015 UTC,"I found APhex through MTV Europe's Chillout Zone in the early (or was it mid?!) 90s - they would play 'chillout' and some electronic music in the early hours, stuff like Aphex and Future Sound of London, Underworld. They played 'On' which seemed pretty cool so went into town to see if I could buy any of this Aphex Twin's music. There was a copy of SAW85-92. It seemed pretty cool, it was up there with FSOL's Lifeforms as my favourite things to listen to at the time.  Later I found Classics, SAWII, ICBYD and of course Drukqs, which I think initially I disliked (the mental/fast tracks especially), I guess brains need time to assimilate music that's a lot different to what you've heard before.  Prior to all that I'd grown up through cheesy 80s pop/rock, I still really like some 90s indie, dance/rave music, later I discovered some 80s indie/underground too, but when I listen to all that now most of it sounds dated, like I need to go find some new music to listen to - but I don't get that with Aphex.  It's a shame Rich couldn't get more of his stuff released years ago, I think lots of people would have got lots from it (some no longer with us), but I guess getting stuff released back then was really hard, or at least on a label that would get it noticed. There was and is a lot of music talent out there that just gets lost in the noise, so at least Rich made it enough to get his music out there."

Rich (in SC comments) kinda suggested the idea of a poll and to quote one of the creators:   rdj has seen it and gave positive feedback. This will probably run for some time (likely many months) as he knows it'll take time for people to properly ingest all the tracks (people can go off tracks, change their mind etc) - and I'm hoping dearly we see many more. I'll host this thing for years if I need to...   Rich most likely hasn't even finished uploading yet."

Frankly, I kind of want to filter and the high-end a touch, it's just on the edge of annoying. I think this track is amazingly pretty otherwise.  .0180871L It's sort of a bouncy repetitive tune, that so far is my least favorite on this release. This and track 3 are played one per channel (L = Left, R = Right) on the 12"", so I wonder if there's something glorious I'm missing...  .000890569 Vacuum off, time for keys and beats! Uptempo, Uplifting and completely ready for the rave.  .55278037732581 Breaks and acid squidges are the heart of this track.   (cat 00897-Aa1) Easily the most beautiful cut on the record, this is one of my favorite AFX melodies. Haunting keys over reverbed drums with just enough noise to roughen the edges.   (cat 00897-A1) While not as pretty as the last cut, the sampled laugh and speed manipulation tricks push this beat and effects laden track.   Afx 6/B 30 seconds of noise, beats and well... effects.   (CD Only #1) The ambience behind The Garden of Linmiri, this ranks highly on it's own in terms of eerie and haunted soundscapes.   (CD Only #2) A minute of noise set to perhaps resemble breathing, over what could be RDJ having a wee, or trickling sound of water.   (cat 00897-A2) Closing out the album with a jittery beat and twisted organ sounds. The flushing of the toilet at the end is available as B1 on the AB3.1 release.    The only thing missing is the now soundcloud released '10 shit smothered' which appeared on AB3.1, as track B3."
aphextwin,37rjjr,addking,3,Fri May 29 22:47:09 2015 UTC,.215061 kicks off AB3 with what sounds like an early John Carpenter OST track being played too fast.   I like this description.

Early 90's analord .1993841: a much less abrasive caustic window track. It was 8 minutes long, but it really only felt like 3 or 4, that was pretty strange lol 01808171R: Pretty cool, but ""eh"" at the same time .942937: see above .01808171L: This one has some pretty cool sounds, but I'm getting the feeling that this ep isn't going to make my brain work too much. The track definitely gets better towards the end though .000890569: Picking up now a bit, thats a noice beat and the synths are pretty chill. 3:20: noice. This is really cool track. .5578037732581: This really reminds me of Didgeridoo, only a little faster and simpler.  (CAT 00897-AA1): The really nice melodies are the only thing of note on this one for me. But they are very nice all the same. (CAT 00897-A1): More ""eh"" than pretty cool.   10: AFX 6/B: Very agressive, I like it. Thats a pretty cool bassline too. Oh right its over hahaha   (CD only Track #1): (CD only Track #2): These 2 were alright   13: (CAT 00897-A2): Pretty good.  Listening to this EP has really made me a appreciating being around in a time when every release by RDJ is mind blowingly amazing lol."

Richard played in a room called the canyon club which is basically a small bar, very intimate, I was no more than 8 feet from Richard the whole show and the members of 808 danced their assess off. Listen to the song cubik by 808, super dope track. https://youtu.be/QRlZQRRGD8o"

I know it's been reported he doesn't like much music from other people and strongly prefers his own, but going from his reputation as a joker, this could be a lie told to throw people off and to protect the music he loves. He's also been known to buy stuff off Juno a lot and has generally opened up so to hear some albums recommended by him would be nice."

Said the lack of distortion makes it scarier...and used the analogy of a crazy guy with a knife in a mall  and a trained killer. The clean, exactness, precision and execution (hoho) of the work has a more profound effect than just turning up the intensity.  Have to agree, Go Plastic is very unique."

Nobody has 60+ ace productions just lying around tbh, it takes loads of time to make tracks of that quality.

In any case, as was mentioned here, if the music is good than who cares and some of those tracks are indeed spectacular.

Ever since it's been a hunt to track down as much Aphex Twin as possible. This goes without saying but I think very highly of Firth, he's able to appropriately use these beautiful tracks alongside his animations. They fit so well with his style, it's obvious he's a massive fan.   Also, in -2 you get to hear some classic Clara Rockmore playing a theremin. I forget the track name but it's just naturally creepy. That instrument is wild."

aphextwin,378hqo,Till_Fjalls,4,Mon May 25 22:23:12 2015 UTC,"On is the track that first got me into aphex. My other favorite producer, Eric Prydz, played it in an influences mix as he said it influenced his techno early on. I heard it and was mind blown; before that I had just heard come to daddy and thought aphex twin made nothing but noise. I'll forever love this track."
aphextwin,378hqo,vulkkid,5,Mon May 25 19:19:11 2015 UTC,"Xepha and D-scape are well underrated in my opinion. Really cool dark and mysterious techno tracks that really make you wonder how he could make something like that as early as 93. Wicked stuff. Also I wrote a 1500 word essay for the Music Video of On for college, I could post that here if anyone is interested."

aphextwin,378hqo,SlateFx,6,Tue May 26 23:44:48 2015 UTC,All brilliant tracks. The tracklist is also how I'd rank them.
aphextwin,378hqo,rd1994,5,Mon May 25 20:55:38 2015 UTC,"This whole ep seems like almost the same song but from different realities, where RDJ was in a different mood when he got the idea for it.   On: I first heard this on an acid trip with the music video. I was with a friend and saw it in the related videos. Neither of us knew the song so my friend said ""I want to listen to whatever Richard D. James considers to be 'On'"". Its nowhere near one of my favorites but I still respect it as an amazing song. 73-Yips: Funny anecdote, a yip is slang for ecstacy tablet in Ireland, at least now it is lol. Pretty cool song too. D-scape: probably my favorite off this EP. So sinister and hypnotic. Xepha: Don't really have much to say about this one besides its a tune."
aphextwin,378hqo,frankdive,4,Mon May 25 23:34:18 2015 UTC,D-Scape is godly.
aphextwin,378hqo,tompalombo,4,Tue May 26 01:49:41 2015 UTC,"On - Preface:  Oh my. So working in a record store in the early 90s, I got to hear a ton of music releases. Promos flowed like water from the labels - major, minor and indie. And since we were an independent retailer we got all kinds of non-mainstream stuff in from imports to local stuff. I'd been selling copies of Aphex Twin Selected Ambient Works 85-92 often enough it piqued my curiousity, but I didn't want to spend out an albums worth of money on a release I wasn't sure I'd like - there were so many albums coming out already that I did want!  The day the ""On"" CD5 arrived I looked at it once and said 'I'll buy this.' Import singles were $8.99 so a little more costly. Another Aphex release with fantastic packaging, I didn't know what to make of the music at first. I was aware of electronic music - Detriot isn't far away after all - but I wasn't exploring it yet.   So I popped 'On' the Cd player (;P) and had an experience that I'd had only a few times before - the sensation of listening to something and feeling like it was a completely different langauge- that I didn't speak yet, but found compelling. I bought SAW 85-92 the next day, and managed to stay abreast of Aphex Twin from there out, although I still missed many an early EP and many of the AFX releases.    On -   On:  Layered patterns are the foundation of this track: a plethora of shifting synth keys being added and removed. Likewise drums and percussive elements are layered giving this track a huge amount of depth. To me this is the logical conclusion of the material from SAW and Polygon Window that share similiar traits.  73-Yips: Harsh tones, noise, constant pounding make this feel like his noisier material on the Joyrex EPs. Even now I feel like the top end could stand a touch of reduction in volume.  D-Scape: The intro also give me the feeling of something mysterious about to happen. The shifting of layers here almost feels like it's unfolding in slo-mo. The muffled voices, and the thump of a constant beat continue the suspense.   Xepha: In terms of feel this track reminds me of a continuation of D-Scape but using a different palate. The ringing tone repeating like a warning siren of incoming danger.   On Remixes -  I'm going to continue here with the On Remixes as the import versions came with the part 1 of 2 listed on it. Although I didn't get this until much later.   On (D-Scape Mix): Not a remix of On, but actually D-scape as indicated by the bracketed title. This mix seems to be focused around a xylophone like sound and tape noises. At over 10 ten minutes it's got the longest run time of anything here but until the 3 minute mark we don't really get the layering that appears on the original version.   On (Reload Mix): Actually  a remix of On By Reload. Odd. This plus tracks 1-3 all appear on the US version of On (CD5 flap digipack) which came out in Jan 94. Although every track is edited in length except this one, which appeared as track 4 in place of Xepha. I'm not a big fan of this remix overall, it's got some interesting moments but is less moving IMO than the original. I can totally understand the Tom Middleton nod tho.   On (µ-Ziq Mix): Another actual remix of On! I think this one is quite a bit better than Reload's - It's longer but in some ways hews closer to On's format, however adding lots of different effects. There's a bit around the 4 minute section that puts me in mind of something more like Prodigy, or Chemical Brothers.  Now that Mike's put up the non-eaten cassette mix of this I'm kinda bummed his version of D-Scape remixed wasn't included as well.   (28 Mix): Not a remix at all, this track is completely different - I saw on WATMM forum admin Joyrex claimed it was a SAW II track that got put on here instead. I can buy that, it's interesting and would fit right in, just makes me wonder what's track 27 then? That said - it's eerie quiet organ tones feel like the aftermath of D-scape & Xepha... Winds whipping around the landscape."
aphextwin,378hqo,addking,2,Tue May 26 02:13:50 2015 UTC,I also wonder what track 26 is..I mean we have all 25 tracks of the vinyl version then 26 /27 and On (28 Mix)
aphextwin,378hqo,rd1994,1 point,Wed May 27 12:32:48 2015 UTC,I noticed on µ-Ziq's soundcloud comments he mentioned the reason his early remixes sound the way they do: he didn't own a sampler back then and so had to re-perform the song with his own synths.
aphextwin,378hqo,WildBluntHickok,4,Thu May 28 05:51:59 2015 UTC,"On and D-Scape are the stuff, although I didn't get into the two other tracks.  Fun fact, I mistook the vocal sample in On for my dad calling my name during the first listenings."
aphextwin,378hqo,KeKeKe_L4G,2,Tue May 26 10:24:37 2015 UTC,"On is one of my favorites. 73-Yips is an abrasive banger, d-Scape is a great track too. Xepha created a nice atmosphere"
aphextwin,378hqo,methyo,2,Tue May 26 06:27:28 2015 UTC,"The beginning of RDJ's obsession with painfully high-pitched noises, especially as percussion. He finally took it to the extreme with Ventolin. It's some of his hardest stuff to listen to honestly."
aphextwin,378hqo,EamonnMR,4,Thu May 28 02:50:04 2015 UTC,"such a I almost want to say hypnotizing beat in On. combined with the lush ambience and the uplifting and thought provoking melody... yea im sold fucking love it! the clear star track from this ep for me personally  in some of the more ambient melodies that play out I have always wondered... doesn't it remind one a lot about one of the melodies from ""Bu Bu Bu Ba"" track with the kind of... anyone? no? :D"
aphextwin,377dt7,21we4,30,Mon May 25 14:12:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, and guess what? It was the year 2012, I finally got my new computer and I started playing GTAIV right away, many years after its launch since my old comp couldn't run it properly. During some of the missions, a song caught my ear, it was amazing, it was so special with a kind of ambient tune into it, and by that time, I even didn't know what ambient music was. I kept finding it during missions and I'd always stop the car and simply listen to it until it finished and THEN I'd move on with the mission... After realizing that song got stuck to me, I finally checked it out, it was Z Twig from Aphex Twin. That, was the day I, maybe shamefully because it was kinda late, I got to know him, the one and only. I got Selected Ambient Works, both of them, and then DrukQs and then whatever I could find about him. And since that day, I keep stupidly saying that I want Xtal to play on my funeral. I will never stop listening Aphex Twin. I hate tatoos and I'm even thinking on getting one someday. I love his music so much and I'm so glad to be part of this subreddit because I know you guys love him as much as I do.  Sorry for long post. Longtime lurker, I don't usually post."

I love the subtle tweaks and that harsh/bittersweet contrast. Peek 824545201 - probably similar to the Fenis Funk suggestion (which I would also have made if it weren't already), it's just one of the least talked about tracks on RDJ album, but a gem.

The overall sound design is really well thought out. It's a really great way to close out CCAIP2.  Yellow Calx - When people talk about RDJ Album they usually bring up songs like 4, To Cure a Weakling Child and Girl/Boy song. Yellow calx is relatively short, but it does it's job. Whenever I listen, I always imagine a building being built only really sped up.   Portreath Harbour - I've talked about this song before in the SOS discussion and yet still I have little words to describe this song. I can't quite pick out an exact mood from this song. It's neither dark or jolly though there are aspects of both. I think that's where the charm of the song comes from. The contrast between every instrument is truly interesting."

It's quite short, but I think it's one of the most beautiful tracks Richard has ever done, yet it's probably one of his simplest and most stripped-back.  But (Throatie) is easily his best track.

aphextwin,372wm6,Boskakkalobbes,8,Sun May 24 10:42:35 2015 UTC,"Interview 2001  Aphex Twin: Water Balloons and Double-barreled Breakbeats  There he is again, the bearded, windowlicking technobimbo. His newest release is called ‘Drukqs’ and might have never seen the daylight if it wasn’t for Aphex Twin to lose his MP3 player in an airplane. “The only reason I release music is because I earn money with it.”  Yes, he still lives in an old banking building in the south of London. A stone’s throw away from the famous Ministry of Sound club. With his friends, Richard D. James sometimes throws small water balloons at the people queuing for the club at the back of his house. Or they put on their teddybear suits and scare the hell of of them. Someday these pranks will be released on video, he promises.  But the shy Brit much rather spends his time working with all his computers (“Last year I bought 3000 cd’s, all on the internet”). If he goes out to do a gig, it’s either on a dim lit stage or at someone’s house. Although Aphex Twin gave techno a face (his ugly head was edited on children’s bodies and suntanned bodybuilders in his disturbing videoclips), Richard D. James remains a shy person in public. Still he was willing to participate in some interviews for promoting his new album ‘Drukqs’. But not more than three interviews worldwide.  “If it was me, I wouldn’t do any interviews at all”, the pale Brit sighs in the small Italian restaurant where we meet. For three hours he talks freely, about breakbeats, Madonna and lost MP3 players. During the conversation we slowly lose the image we have of him as a schizophrenic weirdo. But that still doesn’t make him an easy going person. Something they can talk about at Warp Records, his London record company. ‘Drukqs’ will probably be the last album he will release through Warp. Warp’s relationship with the enfant-terrible has cooled down since the serious illness of Richard’s friend and Warp-boss Rob Mitchell.  “He hardly interfered with the label. And for the rest I hardly know anybody at the office”  But a contract is a contract and once Aphex Twin signed a deal for six albums. Richard D. James chuckles. “I hadn’t given them any new material in the past three years. I asked them: ‘if I give you a double-album, will you let me go after the release?’. And to my surprise they said yes!”.  Lost MP3 player  The reason for Richard’s sudden free handed gesture of releasing a lot of material seem to have a egoistic side. During a flight he lost an MP3 player containing 282 never released Aphex Twin tracks. Huge panic! Although Richard still had all the tracks at his computer at home (“If I had lost the masters, I would have committed suicide”), as soon as the new material would end up in the wrong hands and appear on the internet the shit would hit the fan.  “Basically the consequence for me would be that I would be without a job for the next ten years. I mean, I wouldn’t be able to release the tracks myself. The only reason I release my music is that I make money from it”. So Richard D. James decided to release as many tracks as possible in a short amount of time. Initially ‘Drukqs’ was meant to be a four-double album but very soon it became clear that that was not realistic. Besides, listening to it would have been a harsh ordeal, even for all the die hard fans out there. According to it’s creator, ‘Drukqs’ is meant to be enjoyed in small pieces. “Just like an MP3 cd. On that you only have the tracks you really love”.  Take That piano  Instead of his own face (like on his last album ‘Richard D. James and the succesful single Windowlicker) this time a piano is on the cover. The instrument plays a large role on the new release. “I had never before altered my music with piano’s”, admits the man who became know as a modern electronica pioneer. “We used to have one at home but my mother decided to sell it because it had woodworm in it and those little creatures were a danger to the rest of the house. I bought a new one, about a year and a half ago. A midi controlled one you also see in hotels. That bloke from Take That has the same”.  The piano tracks on ‘Drukqs’ remind of Erik Satie and according to Richard that’s true. “I love the simplicity when it comes to piano music. But Satie’s simplicity can be deceiving. He never composed one note more than he needed”.  By now Richard has already deconstructed the expensive piano, just like he used to do with his synthesizers. “I try to alter the sound of the snares with screws, nails and pieces of rubber band. I can also manipulate the harmonies by using little machines”.  What hasn’t changed on the new album is Richard’s love for overdriven double-barreled breakbeats that hop, step and jump through the chaos. On the night before this interview Aphex Twin performed at the prestigious Victor & Albert-musuem where he gave the attendees a lesson in breakbeat history with a set filled with happy hardcore, jungle and drum ‘n bass. “I still love breakbeats but there are not many people who know how to use them in the right way. The best hardcore was made by people completely out of their minds on pills. Records with controlled aggression are the most effective. That’s why I love Squarepusher’s music so much. It’s the difference between a nutter with a knife in a supermarket and a cold and calculating serial killer. The last one is much more frightning”.  Madonna as a piglet  Some fans criticize ‘Drukqs’ as not being really innovative. And that while Aphex Twin has always been known as skittish and adventurous guide in unknown technoland, always good for a few big surprises. Surprisingly, Richard agrees with these critics. “A lot of the tracks on the album sound ‘old style’ I guess”. Although the style hasn’t changed that much, the detail of the production itself has, he states. After a short break he sighs and continues. “You know what? I made a lot of new tracks. Tracks like you have never heard before. But I don’t want to release them yet. Because as soon as I do, all the copycats jump onto them”. This seems to be one of Richard’s biggest frustrations. “Every time I create something that sounds fresh and new, people immediately take the concept and profit from it”. It’s a problem more hip producers seem to suffer from. Their ‘unique’ sound is copied or exploited by artists with a bigger budget and less creativity. Especially since Aphex Twin is grown into an A-brand after the success of the Windowlicker release. Richard declines almost every remix offer he receives although he is still in doubt if he will work with Bjork and Madonna. Both ladies have been working with Aphex Twin’s video producer Chris Cunningham. “I was at the start of doing something together with Madonna”, Richard confesses. “I had already written a complete track for her, a weird acid song that had Madonna growl like a piglet. When I told her about it, she did not even refuse it beforehand. But in the end, focussing on her new single was more important and that’s when the whole party was cancelled”"
aphextwin,372wm6,ThinkingThrone,2,Sun May 24 10:47:12 2015 UTC,Drukqs is without a doubt my favorite aphex album. It is absurd to me that people will say that it isn't innovative in the slightest.

aphextwin,372wm6,Jankelope,7,Sun May 24 11:26:25 2015 UTC,"Interview 1996  Aphex Twin learns his computer how to sing  Brilliance and craziness are often barely distinguishable. During his dreaded dj-sets Richard D. James prefers to use sandpaper as a slipmat and places a kitchen mixer on the needle to give more power to the records  On the recent Girl/Boy ep he surprised friend and enemy by singing about his love for the milkman and the milkman’s wife and his recent released album ‘Richard D. James’ exceeds all expectations: the record sounds surprisingly coherent and at some points even friendly. The first 100 copies of ‘Richard D James’ will be sent out with a piece of hair. “At first I wanted to sent pieces of my beard but at the very last moment I realised i had already sent my previous beard”   Richard D. James is like his music: contact disturbed and irreplaceable. The Englishman who is always carrying a laptop (so he can play Hornet whenever he want to) is know to enjoy to mislead both the press and the public and on a musical level he’s very often inimitable for us mortals. It is no coincidence he uses a extended collection of aliases: Polygon Window, AFX, Soit PP, Q-Chastic, P.L.P., GAK, Blue Calx and Caustic Window are only a few names he uses to mask his work. His most used and most successful alter-ego is Aphex Twin.  Reality and fiction seem to walk together in both his music and his statements. The smoke screen he raises by doing this allows him to have complete artistic freedom. Therefor it’s a surprise his new record is so accessible.  It’s nonetheless hard to place in a specific corner: manic drum ‘n bass, techno, massive classical music, electro, children’s songs, jazz, echo’s of Kraftwerk and the weirdest noises work together on this very strong new album. And while ‘Richard D. James’ only lasts for half an hour, it’s just as strong as his previous releases. “I’m now able to to create two or three minutes tracks while in the past I needed five or six minute tracks to express my ideas”  “In the past I tried to build tracks up. I dont believe in that anymore. Why create layer after layer and fade them in and out one by one? You might as well throw ten sounds or layers in or out at the same time” On the new record he stays away from singing like on the Girl/Boy ep. On the ep he can be heard singing like a choir boy.   Aphex Twin hates adhering to conventions. Since the time he was twelve years old and tried to create weird noises with tape recorders, he seems to be on a mission to change the set and accepted boundaries of music. He spent most of his teen years on his small room in Cornwall, taking apart old electronic equipment and use the parts to make new machines. These build and rebuild synthesizers, drum computers and other electronica formed the base of what is now the unique Aphex Twin sound.  To finance this obsession Richard entered competitions that were written out by several computer magazines. Once he won fifty pounds with writing a piece of sound software for the ZX 81 computer.  He never finished his Technical Course at the London University, his parents have now moved to Wales and Richard now lives in a student flat in Stoke Newington in North London. There where the police comes around more often than his beloved milkman. He keeps his most conventional equipment in London while all his hand-made machines are safely guarded by his mother in Wales. Out of fear of theft he never dared to move these toys to London.  Even now he still loves to lock himself for days in a room at his parent’s house. It’s there where he finds all the time to work on his ideas, only interrupted by his mother bringing tea. Mother James really appreciates the musical extravagance of her son.  “My mother is more into the hard stuff like the track ‘Didgeridoo’ from 91. She even went to a few of my shows. The first time she came down to a show she was shocked by the look in the eyes from many punters. I told her that it’s really late and they are just tired”  Richard no longer uses a screwdriver and a welding machine to construct his machines. “Now I mainly use software. The possibilities of software are endless. I’m now working on developing software with wich I can create the most wonderful and weird sounds. I still use the machines I build myself. I no longer use any of the drum computers” Richard also tells me he’s working on a really new part of music technology: he’s teaching his computer to sing…  Nowadays Richard is a busy man. Besides recording loads of new tracks (of wich “only a handfull will be released on vinyl or cd”) he also manages the Rephlex label together with Grant Claridge. Rephlex, the label that las year gained praise and was successful with the musical brain figments of drum ‘n bass innovator Squarepusher. “Squarepusher is, together with Wagon Christ (Luke Vibert) the only one that approaches music the same way I do. Recently I recorded a lot of music with both of them. Maybe there will be a release of this somewhere in the future.” Untill that time, from collaborations like this bringing out records together, the true fans can only dream…  The succes of Rephlex also brouhgt some new friends, Ricard cynically states.  “Suddenly the distributor is really nice to us. Up until last year we played our records to people who would then say that not even dogs would buy music like this. Now we sometimes sit around a table with thirty people who all say this music is fantastic.”  It’s not easy for Richard to get used to the comforts and liabilities that come with his newly gained semi-starstatus. The chaos he tries to create in his hotel rooms is made undone by the overenthousiastic housekeeping while he’s gone, he doesn’t like all the so called friendly representatives of record companies that follow him everywhere let alone the small army of journalists that want something from every day. He’d rather sit at home with his equipment or with his friends in the pub. But even there it’s getting harder for him to be anonymous. “I have more than a few ‘stalkers’ in London. Trainspotters. Some of them are really innocent and try to offer me demo tapes for the Rephlex label. I’m not so happy with the scary, child handwritten poems I received lately and people following me everywhere. Last month a manically smiling man sat opposite me in the bus and he kept staring at me constantly. I tried to keep on reading but at some point it was too much for me. I decided to get off near a record shop. An hour later, when I left this record shop, from the corner of my eye I could see the same man, staring at me from behind a wall. The same creepy look in his eyes! I looked at him and he ran away. What frightens me most about this whole situation was the sort of normal, accountant like appearance of this man. Who knows what people like this are capable of?”  The musical brilliance of Aphex Twin is connected to the freedom he seems to be losing slowly. Everybody wants something from him. Record companies, press and the people listening to his music. The attitude Richard has, an attitude that’s in the middle of cynicism and joviality seems to be developed out of self protection.  The album ‘Richard D. James’ is not named after him but after his little brother with the same name. His little brother who died at birth in 1968, three years before Richard was born. “That’s why I am the Aphex Twin. It’s like I have taken on his identity. I pretty sure he’s protecting me like a guardian angel.”  The lines between brilliance and craziness are very often hard to distinguish. Aphex Twin knows how to walk these lines like no one else."

aphextwin,372uq5,MyNameIsPraxin,1 point,Tue May 26 11:36:29 2015 UTC,"I assumed he was going off a certain amount of tracks as opposed to a certain running time, aka picking the top 10-20 tracks instead of going 'hmm I might pick exactly 2 hours and 6 seconds worth of tracks'"
aphextwin,372uq5,MyNameIsPraxin,2,Tue May 26 12:08:51 2015 UTC,"You might be right, I just think that if Throatie did somehow miraculously make it into the top 20, it might just be considered a freebie and he'd include an extra track on top of it. I definitely would rather that didn't happen but if it did, I feel it would just extend the track list an extra 7 seconds."
aphextwin,372uq5,dokidokipanic,5,Tue May 26 13:55:00 2015 UTC,"This is so well done and apparently has the approval of Rich himself. Basically, you just need to log into your soundcloud and browse through the tracks, adding 20 of them to your personal selections.   EDIT: Just a note, be careful not to try view your selection of 20 as a playlist as I did because clicking anything up there will just delete it."
aphextwin,372uq5,rd1994,4,Sun May 24 10:11:38 2015 UTC,"There'll be a lot of disappointment even if as many as 40 tracks get selected though, there's some in here that are being criminally overlooked in my opinion.

aphextwin,372uq5,addking,3,Sun May 24 10:17:41 2015 UTC,I just picked 20 tracks and at least 12 of them only had about 2-3 votes lol
aphextwin,372uq5,addking,3,Sun May 24 10:21:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, same for me. But given that the top vote (Organ) is currently at about 36, I'd guess only about 100 people have voted (I couldn't help but vote for Organ, even though I was choosing my preferred underdogs for the rest of the poll, so I imagine it's pretty popular). I hope that we will see many many people vote in this, it's difficult to estimate exactly how many, but nearly 70,000 follow his sc - around 10,000 will vote?"

aphextwin,372uq5,energyface,5,Sun May 24 15:56:42 2015 UTC,Agreed about both 2Tone and Nightmail. I don't really see the appeal of the latter at all and can't really understand the praise its getting. I can't hear any characteristic Aphex magic in it.  Another underrated one like 2Tone is Red Alert - reminds me of Autechre circa Flutter. Beautiful track with a bittersweet melody.
aphextwin,372uq5,maxd98,2,Sun May 24 17:18:58 2015 UTC,opinions differ I guess..I won't lie Nightmail is (since its release) my number one spot from the SC dump.

I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.  He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was, “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going, “Huh? Huh? Huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off.  When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw Richard trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen traditional pasties in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like, “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the pasties and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually, “To prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

EDIT: of course if your system makes any other sounds while doing this (""you've got mail!"") it ruins the recording and you have to start over.

aphextwin,36qvpx,SubsequentDownfall,5,Thu May 21 21:15:11 2015 UTC,It's too many for one CD or LP's runtime. The comment is directly about cutting a 3 hour playlist into something like an LP which has runtimes in the 45 minute range. Even if you go 2xLP we're still talking about cutting HALF of the playlist.   Don't be absurd. I want more uploads ;P
aphextwin,36qvpx,addking,1 point,Thu May 21 23:15:07 2015 UTC,"Runtime for an LP is 60 minutes not 45. If he keeps every track on there it's 3.2 hours, which won't quite fit on a 3LP set. Personally I'm hoping he keeps every song on there and just makes it a 4 disc set.  Note: when Metallica made a 65 minute album in 1988 they felt it necessary to make it a 2 disc set. They claimed that while it was possible to fit 65 minutes on an LP it would require a highly skilled (expensive) artisan to cut the grooves that close for the master, plus sound quality would take a hit."
aphextwin,36qvpx,WildBluntHickok,1 point,Sat May 23 01:37:01 2015 UTC,"If you look thru the comments he made about it, he mentioned 2xLP set.   As you note yourself you can stuff more tracks onto an LP but it takes a hit in quality. Also we're talking about a guy that prefers his albums to be pressed for 45 rpm, which again cuts the available play time per side down. Also he loves the ability for tracks to be played at the 'wrong' speed - or at least he used to. I think playing CCAI pt2 at 45 rpm is pretty cool.   Sidenote: As an old guy lemme tell you, ripping 2 LPs to a c90 cassette was a standard thing."

There are several programming tricks that were used by Squarepusher at the same time and also some of the sounds can be found at the releases he had at the same time.  I have not heard anybody else replicate these programming tricks and have the access, the style and flow and sense of ease. I would still bet on some sort of Tom /Richard collab. Cmon who can do stuff like Backyard besides the 2 above mentioned?  I would really like to know, because I would definitely put him into same ""AAA-super greatness-flawless victory""-category as Richard & Tom and asap buy all his releases, because Steinvord person really has undeniable talent and maturity."

On the flipside I love Run the Place Red - I actually didn't know about this EP when it came out, but I have the Razor X comp and all Kevin Martin/The Bug albums so the AFX mix was a happy surprise."
aphextwin,36qj5q,addking,2,Thu May 21 09:52:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah I only heard Smojphace EP a couple months ago, the remix is really underated imo"
aphextwin,36qj5q,munkomanko,3,Thu May 21 10:03:02 2015 UTC,"I'll try and explain this better for people who don't quite understand the appeal, just in case you don't feel like digging through lines and lines of the argumentative ranty crap me and the other guy left below. The closest thing I can compare it to is Death Metal,  a lot of people think that sounds horrible too, but the whole point of it isn't to sound good in a conventional sense, it's the absolutely raw energy put into the music that makes it attractive to me. A lot of noise music is pretty much just jamming with equipment with no planning whatsoever beforehand, it's incredibly easy music to make (straight up noise that is). Merzbow, who's essentially recognized as the figurehead for harsh noise, LITERALLY puts out up to 20 albums worth of material every year. His discography, which dates back to either the 70's or 80's I'm pretty sure, is so vast he probably couldn't even remember half the shit be put out himself. There are a load of pretty unknown 'Japanoise' artists who's music pretty much consists of them screaming into a microphone with insane amounts of distortion overlalpped, which again just about anybody could do if they tried. I'll TRY, emphasis on that word, to use a 'normal' Aphex Twin track as an example of what I mean by energy. The track '54 Cymru Beats' from Drukqs is pretty fast paced and harsh sounding from the get up, but around the 4:37 mark it goes absolutely insane with a bunch of loud crashing noises thrown into the mix that probably blew your eardrums apart the first time you heard it. To me it feels like the ultimate climax to a track, reaching the point where it descends into complete chaos and feels like it breaks through time and space or some shit. The 'BoxEnergy4Remix1' track is a pretty good example too, with a huge wave of noise sweeping in around the same time mark as Cynru Beats. I don't expect everybody to understand what I mean, and that's fine, noise music really is one of those 'hate it or love it' things and to understand it properly you just need to listen to it yourself and form your own opinions."
aphextwin,36qj5q,Till_Fjalls,2,Fri May 22 00:09:39 2015 UTC,"So, I just listened to this for the first time - I understand its appeal. it's as if he's too upset to make melodies, and just wants to communicate sheer frustration. I like that. on a somewhat related note, this is one of my favorites from his soundcloud, it makes me laugh every time"
aphextwin,36qj5q,Till_Fjalls,2,Thu May 21 21:54:35 2015 UTC,"I think it's certainly an interesting track, but certainly nothing I would dance around to in my bedroom, haha.  I've always been pretty interested in noise music. there's this weird thing where wherever I listen to straight ""Noise"" music, I get a weird taste in my mouth. I saw some post on /mu/ about it too, so I guess I'm not alone in whatever the fuck it is.   But I just enjoy all the cool sounds in this track, and all the textures..."
aphextwin,36qj5q,Till_Fjalls,3,Thu May 21 13:54:13 2015 UTC,"People say it's just crap with no emotion, but I'd argue it's probably the most emotional music you can find, it's pure fucking anger and stress. I mean if somebody can sit down and listen to 7 minutes of pure noise and honestly say it didn't illicit a single emotion out of them, they're probably a cyborg or something. And yeah it's not the kind of stuff you'd play on repeat and listen to non-stop for days, but I find I listen to it a lot when I want to just 'vent'."
aphextwin,36qj5q,Rorschach_on_ur_face,5,Thu May 21 14:01:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not really the type of person to get really angry at something in life. Maybe I'll get a bit pissed off, but then I'll just listen to Xtal and calm myself down again :)   I've personally never really found much appeal in what people describe as ""45 minutes of pure hate!"" or ""a track of pure emotionless industrialism!"" Because I just think: What's the fun in that? I used to listen to a lot of Metal (and still do), but could never get into War Metal. What people described as ""Pure Chaos"" or ""Chaotic Evil"" I just didn't find a point in. It didn't really illicit any emotions from me, other than producing a strange odour (to me at least).  It's difficult to explain. But I listen to noise to kind of put my problems in perspective. I've always been amazed by just listening to a sine wave on repeat, or just listening to random white noise. It still sounds beautiful to me, and somehow still extremely natural. The film ""Eraserhead"" is one of my favourites, and its soundtrack is a great example of the kind of noise I like.  I'm kind of a weird guy, in case you can't tell... :)"
aphextwin,36qj5q,grandpa_h,2,Thu May 21 14:15:15 2015 UTC,"That's not too weird haha, I think I understand what you mean. That taste thing is interesting tho, do you have synesthesia by any chance?"
aphextwin,36qj5q,rd1994,2,Thu May 21 14:22:36 2015 UTC,"Not sure, I've certainly read a lot about it. There are some albums that give off a certain ""smell"" to me, some of which have caused me to avoid listening to the album because of the odour associated with it. So probably something like that!  But yea, whenever I listen to Harsh Noise (Such as Pulse Demon by Merzbow) I get a very specific taste in my mouth. The best way I can describe it would be the texture of water running along my tongue or something. Very strange, and even stranger when put into words, lol."

This isn't me being, in your own words, chin-stroking/obnoxious or arrogant, it's me posting a track I enjoy from an artist I enjoy in the subreddit dedicated to that artist, which by the way I also happen to be a moderator of.

Folks who have truly wide ranging tastes are much rarer than one might think, even in the age the internet. If they are into like Mono, Lightning Bolt, guitar-orientated post rock I'd try more film track sounding pieces. If they are into stuff like Tortoise I'd try something with more complex rhythms. If they are into the heavier post-rock-ish metal stuff like Isis, Cult of Luna or something just play them Come to Daddy :P"

Can't remember how many times I tried before I realized you just can't force people to listen to what they don't want to listen to.

aphextwin,36kok4,Matafoqana,4,Wed May 20 10:52:41 2015 UTC,"That's just how you GET into new music - you challenge yourself. Give it a go, and TAKE YOUR TIME, to listen to it! (not speaking to YOU directly ofc ;) ). You may not like the music - but you can't truly judge before one has listened to atleast 1 album of a certain artist (which is a shame for RDJ's music, since it can be so vastly different from album to album).   The notion of just showing 1-2 tracks from an artist to a person to see if they would like him/her/them seems obscure to me - especially for Aphex Twin with the humooonguuus catalogue that he has.  For me fx I first heard a Squarepusher track a long time ago ""My Red Hot Car"", and I thought I then had a good assessment of ""the sound of squarepusher""... See how ridiculous that sounds? :D  But okay... My advice... If they claim they really like music, they should be able to just listen to the works of him - at least give it a good try. Best way to do this would IMO be to follow this: http://i.imgur.com/IOS3qYW.png - coz it's kinda true and funny :)  This got a bit ranty lol... I just wanted to say this, because of all the friends I have, almost everyone disregards a certain artist within the first like 5 sec of ONE TRACK - AARHGHH PEOPLE!!!!! If I did so like them I would NEVER have discovered all these kinds of sick musicgenres I listen to today. So what I'm saying is, I rock !! :D haha  No but seriously, good luck trying to convince them - they're already missing out ;)  /out"

I know what you mean with the whole listening to one track and thinking you know everything about the artist/band thing, that pisses me off to no end, but yeah was looking for a good album to sort of ease him into the harsher/crazier/more obscure releases (if he even enjoys it in the first place)"
aphextwin,36kok4,rd1994,2,Wed May 20 08:25:05 2015 UTC,"Haha really? That's a great track. For that reason alone I think it's one of my fav sqrpshr tracks - it's so GOOD.

It's a super scarce minimalistic ambient piece, very haunting, emotional and to me it paints a vivid picture of his life in Cornwall around 1980s. It also has enough roughness to make it that more personal and human, which gives it more emotion. This track really transcends music, and is as emotional as RDJ's best work. The only real standout on the whole album."

I would say a couple of others, If it really is me and Untitled are gems but overall Quino-Pheq is great and hugely underrated."
aphextwin,36dmf1,xo1998,6,Wed May 20 11:50:01 2015 UTC,"This album took me a while to listen to. Mostly because I didn't know this alias and after a quick flick through (maybe 3 months ago) I was thinking ehh.  After listening to the album all the way through was pleasantly surprised.   While this album consists of pretty standard Richard (for the time) with many songs sounding like stuff off of the first SAW and some of his earlier EPs (basically classics). By all means this isn't a bad thing.  Stand out tracks for me are, Untitled and Portreath Harbor.   Untitled is a really nice piece of dark ambient music with a really nice acid style loop. I really like the slight distortion of the drum machines and the overall mood of this song.   Portreath Harbor is relatively hard to describe. I can't quite highlight the mood of this song, it's kinda silly but in an odd way nostalgic and at times kinda scary too. That may not make any sense but as I said it's hard to describe. Possibly for those reasons, it's my favourite track off of this album.  Overall Surfing on Sine Waves is pretty good. Nothing too special but the songs do deliver. The only song I can't find myself liking is If It Really Is Me."
aphextwin,36dmf1,0rangento,4,Mon May 18 18:18:53 2015 UTC,"I love If It Really Is Me, the piano riff and melodies are great"
aphextwin,36dmf1,methyo,5,Mon May 18 22:52:08 2015 UTC,This album still sounds so harsh and beautiful and rock solid. My fav track is Supremacy 2. I really get hooked on the piano riff and everything just sounds so crisp.
aphextwin,36dmf1,squijy,3,Mon May 18 23:32:52 2015 UTC,"If SOS2 playlist comes back today, I think we can safely say he knows about these discussions (although I doubt it but hey who knows)"
aphextwin,36dmf1,MyNameIsPraxin,3,Mon May 18 22:27:09 2015 UTC,"I held this release in my hand about 5 times the day we got this in at the record store I worked at in the early 90's. I used to buy a lot of Wax Trax! releases and I loved the packaging on this, but I didn't actually buy it that day...   This is an album I've really come to enjoy. I like the Caustic Window releases because in a lot of ways they trigger what I like about metal and punk rock. And even tho I was a bit late to the party ('93) on SAW (85-92) it's very high on my  favorite albums list.  Polygon Window sits just below it - the combination of SAW-ish melodic pieces (Audax Powder, If It Really Is Me) and harder hitting nearly CW-ish pieces (Quoth, Supremacy II) the acid line scrawl of the untitled track 7 and even ends with a piece that feels like a foreshadowing of SAW II.   It's got a little of everything which can be a bit of mixed bag if you're only looking for one thing be it ambient works or  bangers, but that's one of the things I like about RDJ's releases. You're never quite sure until you hear it."
aphextwin,36dmf1,addking,2,Tue May 19 04:00:54 2015 UTC,"The prospect of a SOSW2 playlist is very exciting, I'd be interested to see which tracks Richie considers as Polygon Window, because of the limited number of PW releases it is difficult to pin down a theme. Generally speaking, Polygon Window tracks are more detroitish 4/4 techno without the distortion/agression of CW and the reigning in a bit of the lush pad work the Aphex Twin releases at the time had. Kinda minimal as well usually. SOSW was his first Warp release as he was still signed to R&S as Aphex Twin so maybe the alias was for contractual reasons and there is no stylistic intent for the alias. Also its worth noting that Portreath Harbour and Redruth School are on the 2001 reissue only when Richie just submitted two random old tracks on a DAT to Warp, so they weren't originally intended as Polygon Window tracks when created.  As well as Quad Rave, Glockenspiel and P.E. using the above criteria I would also hazard a guess that some of following tracks may appear on a SOSW2 playlist: SallyVingoe, moooow, Venus Squidge, Cooltempodemo1+2, Spectrum X-Rays, Renegade Sonar, Plinky Plonk, Knife Fork Freq, Theyre Here Aahha, SubCan. Hope he posts one up to see how wrong I am."
aphextwin,36dmf1,novazemblan,2,Mon May 18 18:58:17 2015 UTC,"The actual one was yesterday, and was taken down a little bit after. it was Quad Rave, Glockenspiel Teac and 34.5p.e."
aphextwin,36dmf1,addking,2,Mon May 18 19:21:59 2015 UTC,"I wonder about that, because he tacked  bob morgan, 9 wind squidge, and Jcj868e on the 1.5 SAW list, but I wonder if all 3 or at least 9 wind squidge should be on SOSW2 instead.  And were Portreath Harbour and Redruth originally part of SOSW2? Guess we'll see."

Then again these were from (94?) or so, and Richard said SAWIII is half written, so it'll be new music most likely, which means it'll probably sound like nothing we've ever heard before."
aphextwin,368hwf,vulkkid,5,Sun May 17 05:39:54 2015 UTC,"If i'm being perfectly honest, the thought of having another SAW album actually kind of scares me a bit. I feel like no matter what he does, no matter how good this album is, it couldn't possibly live up to the level of perfection the first two have. I'm sure it will sound really REALLY good, but putting the SAW label on it just doesn't feel right to me. I won't call it a money grab, but I mean whacking the ""Selected Ambient Works"" title on would definitely increase its popularity by 100%"
aphextwin,368hwf,0rangento,13,Sun May 17 05:49:38 2015 UTC,"I think people will do what they did with Syro. Over hype it, get disappointed, then really get into it a few weeks later."

aphextwin,368hwf,SF-101,6,Tue May 19 18:55:52 2015 UTC,I'm pretty damn confident SAWIII will be fucking amazing no matter what
aphextwin,368hwf,breathethisair,4,Sun May 17 10:52:10 2015 UTC,"If it's anything like Ibiza Spliff, I'll be very happy."
aphextwin,368hwf,ArtsNCrass,4,Sun May 17 05:56:52 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think he's released any LP's as Aphex Twin that sound like something that's already out there. SAW 1, SAW 2, ICBYD, Drukqs, Syro, they're all unique records with their own unique sound. I don't think we can expect any less from him this time. It'll probably be something we haven't heard the likes of before. Plus he's said he hasn't given out anything from the last 8 years, and the fact that it's only half written means it'll be fresh."
aphextwin,368hwf,bluecalx2,3,Sun May 17 10:54:34 2015 UTC,"The stuff he put out as the tuss is pretty similar to Syro, and HAB put in place the crazy drum programming of RDJ album, but yeah for the most part his releases tend to stand well on their own which is a great thing. I'm just really curious as to how far he can push into new, more experimental territory while still keeping the same 'vibe' as SAW."
aphextwin,368hwf,rd1994,3,Sun May 17 11:27:15 2015 UTC,"Wild guess of course, but it could incorporate beats/rhythm, although in a very subdued way. A sort of mix of SAW 1&2. At least that's something I would dig."
aphextwin,368hwf,munkomanko,3,Sun May 17 07:41:14 2015 UTC,"Assuming this is real and definately happening   I don't mean to be too discouraging, but Richard seems to have a lot of half-completed albums that never get finished. So I wouldn't get too excited about SAWIII being right around the corner. Having said that, between the Soundcloud tracks and his recent releases, I feel pretty confident that we'll keep hearing new stuff in the near future."
aphextwin,368hwf,rd1994,3,Sun May 17 11:37:41 2015 UTC,"I'd like someone that would be like ambient Syro..probably doesn't make much sense, but I am not really a big fan of SAW1"
