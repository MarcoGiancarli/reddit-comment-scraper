The list I have only included things that were not removed so there is a possibility it used to be there but no longer is.  Here is what I have.

I just zipped up the entire working directory in case anyone else wanted to use it. Let me explain what's going on with the files and what you need to get the use you want out of it.    internetisbeautiful.db - The raw data from the scan. Can be used to rerun redmash scan with different output methods and html changes. internetisbeautiful___.html -  The sortable clickable lists  internetisbeautiful___.txt - Output in reddit markdown for copy/paste.  arrorw-___.gif - Image Files for the html tables sort direction indicators. redmash.py - The sorting script. It uses the .db file to output sorted lists and tables. Source redmashOG.py - forgot to delete. Is just stock version of the redmash with only the timestamp changed. sortable.js - Javascript to make tables in html files sortable. style.css - CSS styling for html files subpic.png - Replaceable img to represent the sub timesearch.py - The beginning of the process. Scans a sub looking for post IDs between specific UTC Timestamps using the Reddit search function to find every post from a sub. Puts these posts into a .db file that is used to sort the sub back to the first post made there. Source   Extract the zip into a folder and open any of the html files. The sub  has a relatively small number of posts for it's size so the sortable tabs load quickly. Once they have you can click on comments column and it will sort by them and start off with all the ones that do not have any.   todo: sorting by multiple columns better html and style paginated table  Hope this helps you find the post you were looking for. Let me know if you do.

UsefulWebsites,3524e0,shiftymate,5,Wed May 6 20:34:57 2015 UTC,"From the article you included:   Update May 6th, 8:35AM ET: This story has been updated to note that Grooveshark.io appears to be a rebranding of mp3juices.se. The article's former headline, ""Grooveshark has been cloned and its music is back online,"" has also been corrected to reflect the new information.   Or how about this article: http://bgr.com/2015/05/05/grooveshark-is-back-online/   UPDATE: As several people have pointed out since this post originally ran, Grooveshark.io appears to be little more than a clone (or a skin) of an “MP3 search engine” called MP3Juices.se, which I only recommend visiting if you’re a big fan of ads (and crappy UI). The copyright pages are identical, the privacy policies are identical and, most importantly, the catalogs of available MP3s are identical. (Thanks to Ryan and David for bringing this to my attention.)   Whether or not “Shark” and his team have bigger plans for the domain in the future remains to be seen, but based on these recent revelations, it’s hard not to see this as a group of clever programmers riding the wave of a big news story.    The article off torrentfreak goes a bit more in depth: http://torrentfreak.com/resurrected-grooveshark-is-actually-an-mp3juices-clone-150506/  So really it has just taken songs from mp3juices while using the name grooveshark. Even without those articles, this new site is a far cry from the old grooveshark (no queue, no albums assembled..). The only similarity is the stolen name."

You have somebody who rips and uploads that series on your favorite torrent site.  So, on their userpage, you search ""Cool TV Series 1080p"" and get a list of their releases of ""Cool TV Series.""  Then, you click the RSS icon and get an RSS feed of their releases, usually with a url like ""torrentsite.com/user/awesome_uploader/cool+tv+series.xml""  Then you load that RSS feed into your torrent client, and whenever new episodes are released, it automatically downloads them wherever you want.

As it says in the summary section, data for your account is only available from 9/30/14 onwards, whereas your gilded comment was from 2013.   This is true even for reddit's own user page - if you keep paging down on your user page on reddit, you can see that it stops at your post from 9/30/14 and won't go any further. There might be a way to get around it by fetching all your gilded posts, but it will interfere with the rest of the stats - so I have decided not to do that. Hope that makes sense!"

Otherwise, you have to upload WordPress to your server, create a database/user, then install it manually.

UsefulWebsites,2zxqbx,flyinggoatcheese,1 point,Sun Mar 29 15:39:19 2015 UTC,"Hi, euclidsprime is my site.  A few weeks ago I was bored and wanted to try out Google App Engine. I decided to build something that would work on it's free tier, and since I was bored I wanted something to read.  I decided to find ~700 news rss feeds and build my own feed reader. To test out the performance of App Engine, I had it parse out every word on the article's page, remove common words (the, how, it, and, or, etc..), and use Princeton's wordnet to group similar words. Once the similar words were grouped, I compared the groups of words with each other to find similar articles. As more and more articles get grouped, the newest article in the group gets displayed on the page, and the group with the highest amount of stories gets pushed to the top.  I like your idea of being able to make your own version that you could share.  I also made a subreddit (/r/euclidsprime) for it. Thanks!"

With every other app, I made a ton of lists but didn't take much actual action, and I loathed the sorting and reviewing of the system so much I avoided it.  As far as actual systems go, I use a simplified version of GTD tweaked to my own style. Getting Things Done is a productivity system discussed in a book of the same name.  Ignore the book and anything you've heard about GTD and just check out these 2 sites:  http://lifehacker.com/productivity-101-a-primer-to-the-getting-things-done-1551880955 Read to the end of the Five Pillars section and skip the rest.  http://hamberg.no/gtd/ A 15 minute primer on GTD.  I use Trello for tasks, to-dos, errands, etc; Evernote for saving notes, references, info, records, receipts, etc; Google Calendar for scheduling, bill reminders, tickler file, appointments, etc.  I looked online for some example GTD layouts in Trello and found one that worked for me. There's a ton of templates available too."

I'll compare this with the downloadable converter from DVDVideoSoft's Youtube to MP3 converter (which I consider the benchmark for this process) later tonight when I get home from work and see how it compares.

Secondly, a ""top notch sound system"" is going to find flaws in a 128kbps mp3 way quicker than a bad sound system, but yes, all of my equipment is top notch as well - whether at home or in my car. This is why I notice terrible quality so easily.  Nothing does a better Youtube to mp3 conversion in my experience than DVDVideosoft's software. You can choose your bitrate from 320kbps down, or export the raw file. The options are pretty endless as far as what you can do.   Not sure why you keep referencing it as a website either when it's quite clearly installable software."

Search for unshorten with the shortened url  https://duckduckgo.com/?q=unshorten+http%3A%2F%2Fis.gd%2FxwBu0Y&ia=answer  Want a quick way to make a shortened url? use shorten instead  https://duckduckgo.com/?q=shorten+wikipedia.org&ia=shortenedlink  Then there's the shortcuts you can look up.  https://duckduckgo.com/?q=gimp+shortcuts&ia=answer  https://duckduckgo.com/?q=public+dns+servers&ia=answer  probably other useful Instant answers like weather too.

That's the price you have to pay for Google results; there's no way around it.  Still, the !g bang makes it incredibly easy to use Google if you have to use it. I've used DuckDuckGo for months, perhaps a year. Its results are mostly on a par with Google's. But on some cases (e.g. quite new stuff) Google is better. In those cases I just use the !g bang and it's done.  Thanks to !bangs there's no reason for me to use anything besides DuckDuckGo as my default search engine."

Seriously, search an artist and it will give you their greatest hits that you can play while you keep browsing the search engine. Also you can look at the lyrics as the song is playing without going to an external site.  Search a movie and you can find all about it; the history, the actors, the musical score, the budget, and all without leaving the page.  Videogames? No fucking problem. Look up your favorite series and it will show you literally every installment, every song in every game, every VA in the entire series, and the synopsis of the story.  Wanna read? No problem. This thing will find you links to torrents of the .pdf to the book, and if you click on the different tabs you can order the book from amazon without even entering the site.  And the customization. Oh, the customization. You can change every background, search bar, link, and icon to the color of your choice. Then you get the option to personalize this thing to a large degree. Font? Cool. Measurement? Alright. Infinite Scroll? Hell yeah man.   And the best thing about it is, is that it is just as CPU intensive as Google is (not a lot at all).

UsefulWebsites,2rxza5,gaardyn,2,Sun Jan 11 07:08:00 2015 UTC,"So all this app does is the exact same thing that Google Drive & Dropbox already do? Why would I need a third party app to do that?   Not precisely, it presents itself as a single app for all of those. Seems to me that it is mostly about getting all your stuff together neatly instead of scattered around. They also have some sync on demand feature.   I assumed they were an alternative to those services.   The app belongs to one of the services' company(oxygen cloud), but that seems to be a purely enterprise thing. It is an alternative on your desktop though, instead of having three or four applications installed and running in the background, you can have one with access to more services.  Is it worth the risk? I don't know, that's up to each person to exercise their judgement.  Personally I would not use it for anything other than storing music, series, small games, and ebooks, the sync thing seems like it could help save some hard drive space in that situation(ex: using it like a virtual library, and only sync to my hard drive the books/episodes/games I'm using atm). Other than that, for photos, documents, or anything more personal, I rather go with encryption and no third party applications."
UsefulWebsites,2rxza5,MaybeNotANumber,2,Sun Jan 11 08:01:23 2015 UTC,The fact that their lying about providing infinite storage is enough to convince me that the entire thing is a crock of shit.
UsefulWebsites,2rxza5,gaardyn,3,Sun Jan 11 13:41:07 2015 UTC,"Hi gaardyn,  Quick disclaimer I do work at odrive and I just want to clarify some of the questions being asked on this thread there :)  We're not lying about providing infinite storage. I think there is just a bit of misunderstanding here. odrive is not a storage provider at all, it is a client that gives you access to other existing storage so you can easily access everything from one place instead of having to run multiple apps and clients as MaybeNotANumber described. Since right now odrive is in beta, we're not limiting how many apps and services you can connect through odrive, so theoretically you can link as many Dropbox and Google Drive accounts as you wish for as much storage as you need. We're also in the process of adding more support for other popular storage services such as Copy and Amazon Cloud Drive and even Amazon S3 storage.   In additional to being able to access multiple services through one interface, the other key advantage with odrive is that we leverage Progressive Sync. Other cloud storage clients sync everything from the cloud onto your desktop automatically. We do it the opposite way - we only sync whatever you're double-clicking and browsing at the moment and not other stuff. That way the odrive client isn't trying to download however many GB or even TB of stuff you could have across multiple storage providers onto your computer all the time. You also have the option to ""unsync"" anything you don't need from your machine. Unsync will remove the local copy but the files are still stored from its original location so you can access and sync them again in the future if you need it.   Last thing I do want to address is the concern over privacy and security. Since we're not a storage company, we most definitely do not upload/download or copy any of your files or passwords from the apps you link to odrive. It doesn't benefit us to carry additional storage cost when we're not selling any storage whatsoever. Our business model will be predicated on adding more premium/professional feature that can allow you to easily manage and access all your files through the odrive interface. We're not looking to monetize on gaining direct access to your personal content at all. If you have any additional questions, feel free to reach out to us at any time. We're very active on Facebook (www.facebook.com/odrivesync) and Twitter (@odrive) and also on our own user forum www.odrive.com/forum. Since we're still in beta we definitely appreciate constructive feedback and comments from all of our users!   Hope this was helpful. You can also reach out to me if you'd like - my twitter handle is @juliamak. Thanks :)"

UsefulWebsites,2qr3v9,louiscollins,3,Tue Dec 30 01:49:21 2014 UTC,"Good point, those are two distinct types of movies:    What about good movies that got bad press but were well liked by people?   This is usually the case of blockbusters like Divergent or movies that hide behind their emotional load and use easy routes to hit a winning commercial formula, like Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close. In both cases, these movies reached that level of crowd appreciation because they were able to reach a large crowd to begin with, and so they wouldn't make good recommendations.    What about good movies that got bad press but were well liked by people?   This is where it gets interesting, because critics also give credit to things like creativity, originality, storytelling layers, film-making effort, quality of the movie in comparison with its budget, etc -- while the public (as a whole) doesn't care for those things and judges all movies on the same grounds. This is the case of movies like Mystery Road (6.4 IMDB, 91% RT), Contagion (6.7 IMDB, 84% RT), Bernie (6.8 IMDB, 90% RT). The lack of correlation between viewers and critics (more flagrant in documentaries) is quite funny and says a lot about the industry but that's another topic. Luckily however I have found unlike when critics hate a movie and viewers love it, for these cases, it's just critics loving a movie, and viewers also loving it but on a lesser extent, or express a neutral opinion.   The other good part is that when critics and viewers agree, it means that the movie is awesome! So both questions actually make a good case for a service that aggregates viewer and critic appreciation."

It told me it would take me an hour to read The Myth of Sisyphus by Albert Camus, but I can tell you that's way off. It takes me longer to read the writing of Camus than it does to read the simply written test text.   Edit: Or somehow just make the test text be the same difficulty as the book in question."
UsefulWebsites,2qpw43,toolCHAINZ,4,Tue Dec 30 23:04:03 2014 UTC,"I think it would be much more accurate if the sample text was an excerpt from the actual book. When I tried out King Lear it told me I could read it in about 3 hours, let me tell you, it did NOT take me 3 hours to read that piece of work."
UsefulWebsites,2qpw43,cocomilk,1 point,Tue Dec 30 03:23:31 2014 UTC,"Agreed. Additionally, I'm not sure how it is on desktop but on mobile , the timer button is at the bottom of the paragraph. I read the paragraph not realizing it was supposed to be timed, which I think caused it to go faster when I read it with the timer on. Maybe put the button on the top, or have the paragraph text hidden until the timer starts."
UsefulWebsites,2qpw43,dessyj1,1 point,Tue Dec 30 05:06:53 2014 UTC,Great idea on hiding the text until the timer starts. Thanks!

UsefulWebsites,2qpw43,freehorse,2,Tue Dec 30 01:26:59 2014 UTC,Yup. This just confirmed my suspicions of being a below average reader in terms of speed.

UsefulWebsites,2qpw43,freehorse,0,Mon Dec 29 19:22:49 2014 UTC,I tested this website against my actual reading speed. It doesn't seem that accurate to me. So you are alright!!
UsefulWebsites,2qpw43,Bond000,2,Mon Dec 29 19:46:47 2014 UTC,"""You read 113 words in 12 seconds and your average speed is 565 words per minutes. You will take 5 hours and 40 minutes to complete this book."" (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire)  That sounds about right. Last time I read it, it took me 6 hours and 14 minutes in one go. Either this thing is slightly off or I've gotten faster.  Edit: thanks for the post! This should be useful for my upcoming Terry Pratchett marathon.  Editx2: For Mort (by Terry Pratchett): "" You read 128 words in 12 seconds and your average speed is 640 words per minutes. You will take 2 hours and 2 minutes to complete this book."" Woah, that changed things. Mort took me about a week total of off and on reading, but I did it in around closer to 3 hours. Going to go try one more.  Editx3: For Johnathan Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach: "" You read 24 words in 3 seconds and your average speed is 480 words per minutes. You will take 0 hours and 50 minutes to complete this book."". This timer varies wildly. I happen to have a copy of this book sitting right next to me. I am going to read it, time myself, and then come back and report my findings. Thanks! Time now is 11:55am. I will start reading precisely at noon from cover to cover.  Proof: http://imgur.com/3U2nBst  it is noon now! Reading commences!  Editx4: unbelievable. 0:17:28:03... so I knocked it out in nearly 17 minutes and 30 seconds. I even bothered to read the ""about the author"" in the back of the book inside of that time.   Editx5: sorry it is 12:29pm this moment. I had to figure out how to get a screenshot of my tablet. Here is my timer (complete with baconreader notification at the top from /u/PM-ME-ABOUT-ANYTHING ) : http://imgur.com/aRNbz6a  Conclusion: this website is useful, but your mileage WILL vary wildly. Thanks!"
UsefulWebsites,2qpw43,freehorse,4,Mon Dec 29 18:46:22 2014 UTC,Do you speed read?
UsefulWebsites,2qpw43,ShriekinDreamer,2,Mon Dec 29 20:07:12 2014 UTC,"I probably do. My dad was a pro speed reader and he was the one who taught me to read.   The trick is to stop looking at a word as a group of individual letters and more like an image. You then can gather commonly used ""sight words"" and then build from there. The only problem with this approach, that I have encountered personally, is that it makes it harder to spell things orally.   Also, I like to consider myself a decent speller on paper, but certain words will always throw me for a loop. Available. Scissors. Squirrel. I have to actually think about how those are put together, among a few others.   Cheers!"
UsefulWebsites,2qpw43,freehorse,5,Mon Dec 29 20:20:05 2014 UTC,"Oh cool! I've found that unless you continue to practice, you eventually go back to old reading habits. But since you were raised with speed reading, you probably don't have that problem. On the other hand, someone who switches to speed reading later on probably won't deal with the spelling issues. How's your reading comprehension?"
UsefulWebsites,2qpw43,freehorse,1 point,Mon Dec 29 20:44:11 2014 UTC,"Yep! I'd say my reading comprehension is just above average. If I am tackling heavy, technical reading, my speed goes down so that I can get the information correctly."

For instance I went into Subway and asked for the 'old cut' the problem was the person who was behind the counter (sandwich artist) was so young that she doesn't know of or ever had the sandwich where the bread was cut from the top. Its cool but made me feel old at the same time.

I thought it would point me to the nearest place with the lowest population density or something.  How are bars avoiding humans? Does it mean friends/family/people you know? If so, why the nearest bars? That's the one place you wouldn't go if you wanted to avoid seeing someone you know.   It should give me recommendations of bars in a different city, or restaurants in the middle of nowhere.   That's a real waste of a site."

I don't see how the site can promise no ads and also give away such a valuable service without requiring a registration or a fee. The business model seems like something that would not work in the long term. So, until it proves itself over time, it seems risky to use it for anything important to a business."
UsefulWebsites,27y5sj,yself,2,Thu Jun 12 12:38:03 2014 UTC,"Thanks for your comments. We'll have a FAQ page soon.  nFiles is not perfect for all use cases. But it's good for sharing quick small files or web pages. For example, upload images or create quick web pages from your phone and share the short url to social network (e.g., reddit or twitter). It doesn't need registration, so my grandma can use it easily as long as she knows how to send email.  There could be business models that are not Ads-related. For example, users trade digital items on our platform and we charge small commission fees on it. It's too early to consider monetization at our current stage."
