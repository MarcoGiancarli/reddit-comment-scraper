It's possible, I think, that they will release new tracks aftwerwards, but you'll have to pay for them seperately or in a new season pass."
Driveclub,3e2fjs,kiews,2,Tue Jul 21 16:38:07 2015 UTC,I doubt that you have to pay for tracks. It will divide the community. Japan tracks were free after all.

As for the Wombat, when it was released, there were public lobbies with the only choice of car as the wombat. Those were some great races! You can even manage to go a little off-road and not lose to much speed like other cars. Huge advantage for the lame drivers out there!"
Driveclub,3dzu7o,alex_dlc,6,Mon Jul 20 21:34:32 2015 UTC,"Completely agree.  One of the things they can do to improve with drifting is to first fix some of the start and end points for drift and speed zones. Too many times have I missed out on speed points because I maxxed out the whole drift section and got zero points (because I didn't end my drift going into the section).  Another problem is that for most cars, you need to be driving 75+ MPH into a section just to be able to initiate an adequate drift. some of the cars are simply not powerful enough to get through most sections."

Driveclub,3dxqhz,Naraske,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:57:07 2015 UTC,You get rid of the photo HUD and press share as per any normal screenshot in any other game. I was initially confused too.

Driveclub,3dr3j3,ktfright,5,Sat Jul 18 18:25:28 2015 UTC,"You drive very similar to me, and you handle the car well! I would say to brake a bit earlier before turns, then drift... Or when drifting, feather either the throttle or feather the brake while holding the throttle., that should help for tighter corners where speed isn't too big and f a factor, especially since you have the hyper RUF car."
Driveclub,3dr3j3,ktfright,2,Sat Jul 18 18:36:46 2015 UTC,The handling for driving the fastest times i got that pretty good down because i'm #11 on the leaderboards on thus track with the RUF which i am really proud of. After playing some more i found out that you need to go under 150 kph before entering the drift otherwise you will crash into the wall except if the corner is really wide is that a good assumption?

Driveclub,3dimul,Arkane308,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:27:55 2015 UTC,"I noticed this when I first put the disc in, it doesn't seem playable without a day one patch. Cannot confirm this though as I am unsure."
Driveclub,3dg5nn,FINDTHESUN,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:32:57 2015 UTC,"Pretty neat, thanks. I haven't really taken the time to invest in a racing game since possibly GT4... Would like to ask a few ?'s if someone has the time:   What would you say is the sim to arcade ratio? (example: 60/40) How much would this all run me to buy the game and get caught up on all of the expansion packs so far?"
Driveclub,3dg5nn,MisterBSS,2,Thu Jul 16 13:57:08 2015 UTC,Everyone probably has their own definition for this game and all the other racing games they play. I would say driveclub has a 3/2 sim ratio. All the cars have their own weight to them which makes it feel kinda serious. season pass (which gets you all the expansions) costs £20.
Driveclub,3dg5nn,tipytop,2,Thu Jul 16 19:29:46 2015 UTC,I think devs worked on to achieve a perfect balance between a sim and an arcade - 50/50. And I guess they've done that nicely.
Driveclub,3dg5nn,wunder_junge,2,Thu Jul 16 21:44:15 2015 UTC,"I feel like it's a good balance between the two. Since there is no customizing the cars in a performance manner, the game relies heavily on the feel of each car. Which is extremely noticeable. I'm a long time GT fan, and was deeply saddened when I learned about there being no mods to cars. Then the launch went horribly wrong from the announcement of the game. I waited to purchase it until it was about $25-$30, and just purchased the season pass this week for $25. I try not to start a new race until I have all the stars from the previous one. It's been a blast so far."
Driveclub,3dg5nn,MisterBSS,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:17:45 2015 UTC,"All the stars... Does that somehow affect the performance of the cars or the game otherwise,  or is that more of a completionist's thing?"
Driveclub,3dg5nn,wunder_junge,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:22:29 2015 UTC,It's a completion thing. There is no way to mod the performance of a car in game to my knowledge.

Of you had to get any dlc, I would suggest the Lamborghini or rpm car pack, though I will say that the season pass is worth it for this kind of game. I almost never buy season passes, but in the case of DRIVECLUB, you get a ton of cars and challenges."
Driveclub,3dds8a,ktfright,2,Wed Jul 15 19:34:37 2015 UTC,"You can Google Driveclub DLC Wheel and that shows everything that is included, per month. Okay, it doesn't explain which cars per pack, but it does show that you get a stupidly large amount of content for a comparatively small price.  If you want to know what each car pack is though, go to Driveclub's FB page."
Driveclub,3dds8a,MeanElf,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:59:33 2015 UTC,"I really do suggest the Season Pass, for 25 I have gotten loads more out of the game and saved a lot instead of buying individually I think it's like 66% cheaper. That may not be right but its way better than the $5 you usually save."

Driveclub,3d3xgb,The_Guy_21,12,Mon Jul 13 09:19:55 2015 UTC,Isn't that the reality though? Heavy muscle cars with RWD do slide all over the place.
Driveclub,3d3xgb,Matt6453,2,Mon Jul 13 11:57:24 2015 UTC,the stats are taken from real world data. a bit fine-tuned and eased up. but still taken from actual car performance measurments. ease up on that throttle buddy and you won't slide all over the place = practise more
Driveclub,3d3xgb,FINDTHESUN,2,Mon Jul 13 13:54:55 2015 UTC,I do end up holding the throttle more often with cars I'm finding fun to drive lol
Driveclub,3d3xgb,FINDTHESUN,2,Mon Jul 13 18:36:10 2015 UTC,Driveclub is such a delight!
Driveclub,3d3xgb,MeanElf,3,Mon Jul 13 19:21:25 2015 UTC,"Consider the tracks that Evolution have made, mostly not that suitable for muscle cars, so my guess is that their power output has been tamed somewhat to stop people going full out and just getting wheel-spin - don't forget that a lot of the people playing the game will be comparative novices (witness all of the 'it's too hard' comments we've all seen.)  So I don't think it's been done as a kind of snub, certainly as the Challenger is a fun drive in DC - something that might not be the case with all those twisty bits if it had the full power available to it that you'd expect. The hyper cars are better at this, as they are shaped to cope with corners and speed. Also, don't forget that the Hennessey Venom is an American car (I know, based on a Lotus, but still designed and made in the USA.)  Anyway, shouldn't your title read bias against...considering what you are saying?"
Driveclub,3d3xgb,MeanElf,3,Mon Jul 13 17:11:36 2015 UTC,This answer actually makes sense. I suppose I wish they had balanced it out while giving it a bit more acceleration somehow. I get blown out of the water during straights. Aren't pony/muscle cars supposed to be excellent at straights?
Driveclub,3d1qka,sacriker,0,Sun Jul 12 20:31:15 2015 UTC,This has happened before where times wouldn't get recorded. I would recommend telling the Game Director via Twitter. His Username is @Rushy33.   It's a very big issue for competitive users such as myself for the leaderboards to be down. Especially when i have records on the line.

Driveclub,3d36xn,sacriker,0,Mon Jul 13 05:24:10 2015 UTC,"Yup, so wrong. And it's not your fault, it's Evolution's. That was a dumb move (putting Starter in PS+ edition and not some races from Driveclub Tour). The name it self (Starter) implies that it's something it actually isn't."
Driveclub,3d36xn,stripes3,5,Mon Jul 13 11:05:18 2015 UTC,"it's a ""starter"" because it lets you drive cars you can't normally drive, in locations you can't normally go to. It gives you a taste of the full game."
Driveclub,3d36xn,zedie,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:35:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, I know it got a few cars (a taste of DLC content also) and tracks that are not in Driveclub tour + it has weather and all that, but do you think it's a good idea to put beginners that had no contact with Driveclub in those cars and those circuits?

Driveclub,3d36xn,stripes3,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:39:31 2015 UTC,Huh? I found the starter pack especially easy. It might not be on the lowest difficulty but it's certainly not highest.
Driveclub,3d36xn,Chronospherics,2,Fri Jul 17 13:28:56 2015 UTC,"less challenging = not interesting = not good = less frustrating, maybe? = less rewarding = because it's always great to learn and see how you grow and improve"

It's just so touchy and spins out like it would rather turn you around than go around the corner.  I've noticed it's a lot easier to tap the gas coming out of a corner or feather it that go WOT. It seems like it's always on the brink of drifting.  My favorite car, since I only have the PS+ edition would have to be either the BAC Mono or the Audi R8 V10.  Mono- Handles like a dream and is made for the track. I love it and wish we could drive it on a road rather than a track.  R8- Feels great, easy to corner, easier to pass people. I honestly think it might be one of the best cars in the game, and definitely in it's class.

Driveclub,3cmfco,jock-a-mo,3,Thu Jul 9 02:27:12 2015 UTC,"Downshift heading into the corner, let engine braking slow you down.  Puts you in the powerband coming out of the apex as well."
Driveclub,3cmfco,hiefs4eva,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:41:38 2015 UTC,"I tried this. Seems to work alright, although I'm sure I need more practice.  What do you guys recommend for the red flag corners? Those are always the worst; with me either going to far, or understeering and skidding out."
Driveclub,3cmfco,hiefs4eva,2,Thu Jul 9 03:33:40 2015 UTC,"Start braking/downshifting sooner than you think you should, while you're still in the straight.  Also figuring out the lines will help keep you from taking corners too sharp so you can carry more speed into them.  A decent rule of thumb is if you jack your brakes while your wheels are turned you're probably going to slide."
Driveclub,3cmfco,hiefs4eva,2,Thu Jul 9 03:45:05 2015 UTC,"Is jacking them and sliding sometimes alright though?  I've seen for some corners, not sure about others, that you can actually carry more speed through them by not quite drifting them, but not going straight through either. It's worked for me for a few corners where everyone usually hits the outside wall, or goes REALLY slow through them."
Driveclub,3cmfco,Cman1200,1 point,Thu Jul 9 10:10:01 2015 UTC,"Aye, I'd say so.   Controlled slides can whip you around the interior portion of a turn really quickly, but it's a risk vs. rewards type of thing.   Honestly, I think it's better to start off going slow into the turns, working on your lines and clearing corners that way and ~then~ trying to fly through them.  But everyone has their own way, nothing is really ""right"" ya know?"

Driveclub,3cjdbo,sacriker,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:02:27 2015 UTC,"I recommend with the faster cars, when flying into corners, hold both the brake and gas at the same time to rev the engine a bit and change direction while slowing down.  I've found it's the best way to maintain momentum and pass people in corners without them expecting it.  It's worked for plenty of races so far, on the PS+ edition.  Also, how did you upgrade? I keep trying and the PS Store says it can't display the item."

Driveclub,3ccqk1,Ryphor,2,Mon Jul 6 22:06:18 2015 UTC,This may not be the answer you want to hear but it's all I have. Communicate! Everyone be in the event browser screen and looking at the events. The session host will say something like I'm picking Tamil Nadu team race which starts in 37 seconds. Then he selects it and all the remaining players who didn't see this proceed to also register for the event. This is the only way I have found to work around this issue in the meantime because the registration with a session can be spotty. I play with friends regularly with this method and it's not a big deal once you're all on the system.
Driveclub,3ccqk1,Sgt_ZigZag,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:01:40 2015 UTC,"Make sure you register for an event 20+ seconds out and they will get a notification for it, or they can press triangle and select it from the top of the session menu."
Driveclub,3ccqk1,ItCouldaBeenMe,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:01:06 2015 UTC,"I've had the same issue sometimes. What I found is that you should register for an event that has 20+ sec left.

Driveclub,3calaw,eduarz,2,Mon Jul 6 12:57:43 2015 UTC,"I'd say that the hardest part for me was knowing when to use and when to avoid the kerbs/dirt, or to put it another way, which apexes to try to hit and which to take a little wider for better exit speed/entry to the next corner. Every corner here seems deceptively complex, for me.   The hardest for me were the hairpin at four, which I still think I mucked up here, and turns five and six. If you turn too sharply into the corner at five, you seem to lose the speed and momentum you need to take six well. Six is the real make or break, though, because you basically hit the dust and then 'miss out' two turns to maintain speed and give you the angle on a fairly sharp right, which is technically turn nine but which I treated as seven.   I hope that makes sense. I don't really know the terminology but that's pretty much how I learned the course."

We were all on the same team, too. Anyways, we came upon a semi-long stretch in the track. Player B, in 2nd place, speeds up and nearly overtakes Player A's first-place-position, when then the jerk that Player A is side-rams him into the wall. Naturally, B fights back and the two continue to side-ram each other. At this point, I have sped up considerably and am right on their tail.   It was glorious.  The two made an opening, accidentally, and I slipped right through and was the new 1st place holder. Of course, it was a team race, but these two had been ramming everyone, so they deserved to be second and third.   However, the stretch was nearly over, and there was going to be a hard corner. So I braked hard. Unfortunately for the two nitwits behind me, they were too busy fighting over second place, and in my rear view mirror, I saw them (and 3 other cars that managed to get there quickly) crash into the railing. I held the 1st position for the rest of the match."

Beyond that you have to take a different angle into the apex and kick the rear end out then turn into the direction of the skid. Circle button is the E-break and this is the best way to kick the rear out. Also you don't have to go super fast to do a good drift, sometimes going at a medium pace is easier to control than flying so fast into the corner."

Driveclub,3c6h6g,indirect76,6,Sun Jul 5 07:59:55 2015 UTC,"I've had the game since launch, I must admit I'm baffled at the amount of people with the PS+ edition that find the game difficult from the get-go. My only guess is that the ""startline"" tour has thrown people into the deep end with no support. I think the main tour was a better system to accustom people to the handling and tracks.   Also, I find it hard to believe that you're getting no further than 12th place with no clue on why. honestly, the AI is quite lenient if you're that far back, you must be making huge mistakes or generally driving really bad if you cant get past 6th place.  Like some have probably said; look out for how you're going into corners (go slow and steady in, fast out). also, take advantage of the AI cars that have lined up for a corner; go inside of them and use the cars as a cushion (not to rough or you'll get a penalty)."
Driveclub,3c6h6g,tipytop,2,Sun Jul 5 14:48:01 2015 UTC,"Yup, the Starter tour was a bad idea. Is to hard for newcomers. Maybe a portion of Driveclub Tour was much better suited, but there you don't have variable weather if I remember correctly.  P.S. Fuck ""Dam Busters"" and to a certain extent ""Venom Hot Lap""! :) They pulled my hair out like no other race in ""Driveclub Tour""."
Driveclub,3c6h6g,stripes3,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:21:10 2015 UTC,"I know why I'm failing, and it's the reasons you list. I'll take a turn too fast and hit a wall or too slow and allow the other racers to pass me. There just seems to be zero margin for error."
Driveclub,3c6h6g,tipytop,3,Sun Jul 5 17:51:30 2015 UTC,"Here's something I recommend trying; go on single mode and do a time trial on the race track in india ( it may be called tamil something, not sure) with no weather, in the day . use a hatch or sports car. do some laps and pay attention on the cornering the ghosts are doing. the idea is to get a good feel of both the car(s) and also the tracks and how varying corners can be taken. This is best to do so when you get on a track with other cars at least your handling of your car will be decent.   When you can make your way round a track without overshooting corners or oversteering into barriers you can try a single event on the same track but as a race. and theres a few more tips for this.  First tip: The theory of drafting. If you've played arcades your whole life you might not be familiar with this concept of drafting. basically, getting behind another car thats going in your direction thats just around the same speed as you will help you speed up and catch up to them way quicker. its to do with slipstreams reducing drag for the vehicles that are in them. take full advantage of that on straights and beware of cars behind you doing the same thing.  second tip: mentioned in my previous comment take advantage of AI's over cautious behaviour at corners, cut on the inside of them and accelerate out while using them as a support to prevent you from understeering on to gravel/grass. This is my method of getting to the front.  third tip: know the track and be decent at handling. this will ensure you won't mess up when you have the lead, and if you don't mess up , trust me, you won't lose your lead (online is a whole different story though).  bonus tips: dont be too harsh on your steering, dont be too harsh on your accelerations, dont be too harsh on your braking. all these will make it harder to sustain control. counter steering should be done in good moderation because you're flinging the car very roughly. break in good timing before a bend and not during or you will go into a drift and lose control.   Edit- didint expect to have such a hefty post."
Driveclub,3c6h6g,KingYesKing,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:21:58 2015 UTC,Thanks for advice. I'll give it a shot.
Driveclub,3c6h6g,ActionFlash,7,Sun Jul 5 18:49:07 2015 UTC,"I was the same. Got the demo, got to that second race and was having a very hard time as well.   Then something I noticed... Before corners/turns there are giant colored flags. Green/Yellow/Red, individually they represent how fast/medium/slow you can go through those corners. For Green turns, go full speed, adjust via throttle only. For Yellow turns, brake smooth but not as hard, fast out. For Red turns, brake hard (late) and smooth out.   After the flags and getting used to the car. I easily came first. Also most races the game only requires you to be top 3.   PS: I ended up buying it after finishing up the demo. Great game, should have picked up sooner."
Driveclub,3c6h6g,KingYesKing,4,Sun Jul 5 23:31:54 2015 UTC,"I don't think that is quite right with the flags, I believe it is the severity of the corner, so let's say a scale of 1 to 3 on how tight the corner is. So for example...  Green = 1 (not a very tight corner) Yellow = 2 (medium tight corner) Red = 3 (very tight corner)  So your examples work for the most part, but not always. If you are approaching a green flag at nearly 300kph, you still may need to tap the brakes to stop yourself running wide."
Driveclub,3c6h6g,KingYesKing,4,Mon Jul 6 01:01:34 2015 UTC,"That's another way to put it, true. Just got the game, that was my understanding of them for most cars/tracks.   But I will keep your advice in mind."
Driveclub,3c6h6g,Stanshant,3,Mon Jul 6 01:59:12 2015 UTC,Thank you for the advice. I'll definitely take note of the flags the next time I play.
Driveclub,3c6h6g,TimeTravelingDog,3,Sun Jul 5 23:54:25 2015 UTC,You're welcome. Add me if you want to play some.   PSN: Kingpin326
Driveclub,3c6h6g,Stanshant,3,Mon Jul 6 00:01:08 2015 UTC,"Basically, you need to look at your mistakes and try to improve on them. As much as possible, try to ignore the competition and think only about the course. When I'm trying to master a new event, I virtually take it one corner at a time.   If you're hitting the barriers, you're going too fast. If you're sliding off track, you're either going too fast or not turning into the corner accurately. Be lighter on the brakes and lighter on the gas coming out of corners. If you slam on, your wheels will lock or spin and you'll lose control. This last realisation brought about the biggest improvement for me. Good luck!"
Driveclub,3c6h6g,TimeTravelingDog,2,Sun Jul 5 10:25:01 2015 UTC,It's a little hard to just ignore the racers and focus on the course when the AI will ram your car on a turn if you happen to take the turn 5 mph slower than the AI decides to take it. Also spin outs are bad in higher end cars with just the tiniest of taps.
Driveclub,3c6h6g,Stanshant,2,Sun Jul 5 15:15:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the onus is definitely on you to avoid contact but I can honestly say that after 190/225 tour stars, I've never lost out because of dodgy AI. If anything, I've cheesed a few stars by bouncing off them round the last corner, etc. Nobody is consistently finishing last because of the AI: it's because they're not very good at braking, yet."
Driveclub,3c6h6g,7395628,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:39:44 2015 UTC,Right. But you're looking at it from the perspective of someone who is good at this game. So yeah you're right they're not good at breaking but the AI compounds the issue by contact in curves for new players.
Driveclub,3c6h6g,stripes3,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:44:36 2015 UTC,"I can only concede a non-committal 'maybe' because I'm not very good at the game but I have put plenty of time into working on my braking, and I've never had any noticeable issues with the AI. I may have erased it from my memory but, honestly, I don't think it's significant compared to the fundamentals of 'gitting gud'."
Driveclub,3c6h6g,RudyRoughknight,3,Sun Jul 5 21:06:59 2015 UTC,No difficulty setting in this game and levels only relate to how much fame you earn. It does also give access to some cars though.  Yes the game is challenging and you are rewarded for smooth driving and that takes time. In the races I will try and pass as many cars as I can on the first corner and that helps.
Driveclub,3c6h6g,0x0000_0000,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:08:15 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised there is no difficulty setting. I really liked how the last two Forza games allowed you to fine tune the difficulty. I think this game will lose a large portion of it's potential audience with that design choice.  At first I was excited for the challenge, but the extreme difficulty is just frustrating after coming in 12th place 10+ times."
Driveclub,3c6h6g,twiglad,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:47:56 2015 UTC,"It's not unheard of. Think of some fighting games. They don't have difficulty settings in ""story mode"" but have one for single events. I prefer it this way, honestly. The real problem is that the Starter Tour is much more difficult than the first tour (aka Driveclub Tour) in the complete edition. There you start with the lower class cars and easier races. When I got the game, the Starter tour wasn't released yet so I played about half the Driveclub Tour and then tried the Starter when they updated the game. I was amazed how different they are and how much harder Starter Tour is, especially the ""Venom Hot Lap"" and ""Dam Busters"" (one with 8 Laps + a McLaren 12C + rain ... god dammit!). You won't find that kind of difficult races in the first 2/3 of Driveclub Tour.  I don't know how it is in the Plus Edition, but you could try to do single events (races, not time trial or drift) with 11 opponents and put them at the lowest difficulty and see how they (and you) perform. Then climb higher and higher (the difficulty settings) until you feel confident to try the tour mode."
Driveclub,3c6h6g,twiglad,2,Mon Jul 6 11:16:28 2015 UTC,"You think that's hard? Wait until you do the final Hot Lap Time Trial. But really, once you git gud, the A.I. seems to be much easier. The game may be described by non-players as an ""arcade"" racer but it will kick your ass if you touch the grass, dirt, etc. Be careful on those straights with the faster cars as the small bumps and undulations will also kick your ass."

I will say though that the sports and performance class events can be a bit brutal with regard to speed and AI.  In essence though, you start with Hot Hatch and sport, then move on up through semi-pro, to pro and then legend. All levels include at least two car classes. The main game tours do not include weather, as that came in a later update. You will be able to do those in Single Event mode."

Driveclub,3c4spw,ActionFlash,-1,Mon Jul 6 01:08:58 2015 UTC,Blinding rain on 3rd person (the farthest) is killing me. Why does it have to be droplets of rain on my TV screen? What logic is in that? It's not like an actual camera is chasing the car. If Evolution wanted to make it more immersive they could have resumed to only the edges of the screen not the middle. :(
Driveclub,3c4spw,stripes3,3,Mon Jul 6 11:45:49 2015 UTC,"Maybe to not give too much advantage to 3rd person over the other views,if you think that's blinding,try driving heavy rain in dash cam,those beautiful rain drop physics washing across your vision as you plunge into a blind corner are certainly immersive(and actually it's great fun once you've  really mastered a track layout)"

Driveclub,3c1ufb,MeanElf,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:55:26 2015 UTC,"I loved 1st person mode for my first day.  I wasn't even bad at it as I kept placing 1st or 2nd in all my races.  Then I realized rain really sucks when trying to take corners and you CANNOT see anything ahead of you since the wipers suck so bad and leave water at the edge of the windshield so you can't see anything.  Now I play in the far-out 3rd person view and love it; no more blind spots and I can see people behind me and sides.  Change it; you might feel it's cheating, but hey, gotta do what ya gotta do."
Driveclub,3c1ufb,TXL26R,0,Thu Jul 9 01:11:30 2015 UTC,"Ignore the downvotes, if people can't be bothered commenting, that sort of thing shouldn't count - Reddit is rife with that sort of thing.  As for the question. The game is meant to be fun. I have driven in that view for quite a while now, since DiRT 2 to be exact and have loved it. That said, I found it was difficult in DC after the weather patch so I switched to bonnet view if it was going to be a night race in the rain or snow. It's no biggie, as I enjoy the game immensely, so I adapted my approach.  I still race from the interior view and even got all three stars in the F50 event recently in Norway, despite rain accrual blocking my view of the upcoming corner. I don't think the wiper speed would have helped much with that car anyway.  like I say, it's meant to be fun, so treat accordingly - there is no crime in running a race from a different view once in a while, or indeed however often you want to."

Driveclub,3bz6sm,sujoy247,5,Fri Jul 3 09:52:51 2015 UTC,"All I am doing is being really extra careful around the bends, and braking a lot.   don't brake a lot, but brake at the right time.  Best places for braking is the straight just before starting to turn, if you slow down enough, you'll have enough grip to get your car around the turn without losing too much speed. Braking while turning will cause your car to understeer (slide towards the outside of the track). To know from how far ahead you need to brake, look at the flags on the side. Some Green flags, you don't need to brake at all, but just lift off the gas and take a good line through the corners (out-in-out: start from outside of the corner, turn in towards the apex, and coast towards the outside of the turn) yellow, some slight tap on the brake, and red, it really depends on how hard the turn is, look on your map.   Also try following the AI ghost. They take mostly a good line through most corners, and brake a bit early for most. Just brake a slightly bit later than they do, and you'll do fine most of the time.  As you play more, you'll figure out which corner needs to be more careful, and which you can ignore the flags completely (also depends which car you're driving. some will turn, some will just lose control at speed)  Another important factor, is feathering (gradual braking/turning/accelerating, don't mash the trigger all the way down, but partially). It's more important on some cars, and less on other high-traction cars, but smoothness is key to going fast. Sometimes you feel like you're driving very slowly, but those laps tend to be the fastest. Smooth laps are fast laps. The least tire squeal and burning rubber, the better.  These tips generally apply to all (at least authentic) racing games. Any game with a basis on real physics, will take advantage of this driving habit. I think the main reason you're struggling is because you come from arcade racing games where drifting means faster racing, but it doesn't work that way in real life (see the Drift myths episode of Mythbusters. Even a professional drifter couldn't beat Adam's ""grip"" lap while drifting perfectly) If you drive well on Gran Turismo, or Forza, or other PC Racing Sims, you should have no trouble with DriveClub. It's a lot more forgiving to mistakes (a LOT more grippier) and I have trouble playing Project CARS at first because I got used to DC's physics..."
Driveclub,3bz6sm,zedie,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:09:30 2015 UTC,Had no idea about the flags around corners. Thanks so much!

Driveclub,3bz6sm,BiancoBlu,6,Fri Jul 3 10:11:43 2015 UTC,"Break before the turn, Not in the turn."
Driveclub,3bz6sm,Lamarios,1 point,Fri Jul 3 10:49:09 2015 UTC,"This changed my life. This whole time, I was braking as I entered the corner.  ...I'm not a smart girl."
Driveclub,3bz6sm,blairmichod,2,Sat Jul 4 23:09:39 2015 UTC,"Also, try and incorporate the square button during the braking of a corner. Your cars grip can be better at lower gears, also in turn will reduce your speed."
Driveclub,3bz6sm,Pauls2theWall,2,Sun Jul 5 05:45:35 2015 UTC,I've been playing automatic this whole time. Is manual worth the extra complexity?
Driveclub,3bz6sm,blairmichod,2,Sun Jul 5 06:37:28 2015 UTC,"It takes a while to get used to, but the best part is, every car is an auto-manual. You can tap square going into the turns, and not have to worry a out upshifting out of them, the game will do it for you. Full manual is a lot of fun though, mostly when you downshift to save yourself, meanwhile pinging the RPMs off the rev limiter while side ways. Makes for some exciting racing."
Driveclub,3bz6sm,Pauls2theWall,2,Sun Jul 5 15:46:01 2015 UTC,"Oh, can you engine brake as a panic maneuver?"
Driveclub,3bz6sm,blairmichod,3,Sun Jul 5 17:17:46 2015 UTC,"Yes but momentum will still carry you if you're too late. That's why you should always try and glance at the mini-map, gauge the corner, apply appropriate braking as late as possible, downshift while braking and turn in at the right time to hit the apex, coast through, then apply acceleration when you have a line out."
Driveclub,3bz6sm,Pauls2theWall,2,Sun Jul 5 18:31:55 2015 UTC,"Instead of tilting the stick from side to side when turning I keep it pinned straight forward at all times, then when I want to turn I shift it left or right, always keeping it pinned. Of course you'll come across a particularly hard corner and have to pin the stick all the way left or right but you get used to going straight back forward. Makes for very precise handling. Now bring on the downvotes."
Driveclub,3bz6sm,OneToNothing1-0,2,Fri Jul 3 10:23:01 2015 UTC,"Just an idea:   Go to any single player circuit TIME TRIAL. With each vehicle class do at least 20 laps on a chosen circuit. Hot Hatch, Sport, Performance, Super, Hyper - 100 laps in total.  Do your best, pay attention, watch the ghosts, improve.   You'll be a different man!"
Driveclub,3bz6sm,FINDTHESUN,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:23:55 2015 UTC,"The best thing I ever learned about racing was from the GT3 a me manual. It had a basic driving guide meant to help give new players tips in how to drive. Something along the lines of... Your tires only have 100%. You can't accelerate, brake, and turn at the same time and expect them all to work. Brake before the turn, hit the apex, accelerate once you have a straight line that isn't off the track."
Driveclub,3bz6sm,Pauls2theWall,0,Sun Jul 5 05:49:53 2015 UTC,The wheel is the best way to go in this scenario. I know a lot of you prefer the controller but once you get good with the wheel there is no going back.  I'm waiting for my Logitech G29 to arrive but I've been using a Thrustmaster T80 the entire time of playing this game and can get in the top 50 on any track with any car. It's all about practice and learning about driving lines and the tracks to know where to hit the brake and the gas.
Driveclub,3bz6sm,GingerApe1,3,Fri Jul 3 12:21:35 2015 UTC,"I think there are many many more useful and less costly tips for a beginner than 'buy a wheel', though. I appreciate your point but don't think it's the most appropriate here."

Driveclub,3bz6sm,GingerApe1,-1,Sat Jul 4 00:12:02 2015 UTC,"Driveclub is arcade-y as fuck. It just pretends to have realistic handling. To abuse this, you just have to get familiar with real life physics. I played a lot of Gran Turismo where the handling is very punishing, so coming into a game like Driveclub was pretty easy. Watch some videos on how to be race driver. Getting the basics down such as the Out-In-Out technique should help you immensely."

Sorry I can't really be specific, but before the drifting got patched I did the Pagani/Zonda drift event on Maplewood a stupid amount of times before getting all three stars.  Alternatively, don't worry about just doing the same event over and over to get it, there are so many community challenge drift events that you'd be forgiven for thinking that this is a very different game than the one you thought it was.  Cheat drifting is the way some people build up a massive amount of XP."

Driveclub,3bxqx8,coopahhhh,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:55:22 2015 UTC,If you're that far ahead with races then stick to it. A drift event might take say 45 seconds to complete but there are races that take 1:00 That and there are more race events in the tour and DLCs to help along the way

Driveclub,3bxqx8,blairmichod,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:04:48 2015 UTC,It's not cheating per se since the game allows it. It's so frustrating though to see the ghost just spin out.  Someone here suggested that hitting a wall or spinning out should reset the score for the section and I agree!

Driveclub,3bw1bo,MeanElf,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:18:47 2015 UTC,"One thing that is interesting is, if you have completed the event and won all three stars, the game will let you choose from a wider range of cars if you wish to do the event again.

Never drift, driveclub isn't like Need for Speed, you want to maintain maximum traction, and you want to hit those apexs just like you would in Gran Turismo or Forza. Treat it more like a sim and less like NFS. The game is difficult but its rewarding."

I don't mind the drift rating as some cars with higher ratings are hard to control, like the Hennessy venom. Practice a course, and practice entry speed and angles, as those are important for more points. If you're going too fast, tap brake (L2) to slow down a bit without interrupting your drift. also try driving in manual, that may help too."

I learned from others too when I started. I didn't seek instructions, just WATCHED and PRACTISED. Don't worry too much, remember, it's all fun and games! :)"
Driveclub,3bsex7,FINDTHESUN,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:53:49 2015 UTC,"For something like this, however, I'd appreciate if you said what you were doing as you drive, like ""I'm tapping the handbrake here while counter steering and applying half throttle. This turn really should be taken in third gear,"" etc.   As a complete scrub, I can see what other cars are doing and still really have no idea how they're doing it."
Driveclub,3bsex7,ktfright,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:07:46 2015 UTC,"I always liked your videos,so I'm gonna subscribe. Hopefully one day we could have a drift collab on our respective youtube channels, or something of that nature haha. any tips for a music video director turned youtuber?"
Driveclub,3bsex7,Onionsteak,-1,Thu Jul 2 04:44:41 2015 UTC,Your videos are great as usual but..   It would be helpful if you just posted the particular video you wanted op to see otherwise that just look like attention whoring.
Driveclub,3bsex7,FINDTHESUN,2,Thu Jul 2 13:29:59 2015 UTC,"Hey buddy, thanks for a kind word. Almost all of the videos have some kind of drifting, so I thought whatever he'd watch would be helpful. Take it easy, my friend! :)"
Driveclub,3bsex7,Mutilated_Pencil,2,Thu Jul 2 15:53:53 2015 UTC,"keep keep keep practicing really, at one point you just get used to it. Mostly to drift its best to shift down so you go high in revs and use the handbreak. Make sure during drift your revs should be maxxed out."
Driveclub,3bsex7,FINDTHESUN,0,Thu Jul 2 07:18:14 2015 UTC,exactly this. AT ONE POINT - as soon as there's enough experience - everything just clicks.
Driveclub,3bsex7,Onionsteak,2,Thu Jul 2 15:56:37 2015 UTC,"Try entering the turn with a bit more speed than usual, and tap whatever you map handbrake to, counter steer as neccessary and trust that the drift will scrub enough excess speed to get you though the turn.  Drifting isn't done very well in DC compared to say, Gran Turismo where I don't even have to use handbrake, I wish I could scandi-flick in DC more effectively."
Driveclub,3bsex7,Sgt_ZigZag,0,Thu Jul 2 13:28:49 2015 UTC,Just buy the game and play online. Single player campaign is very hard but online is a blast so you're doing yourself misjustice by writing off the whole game just because of the single player difficulty.
Driveclub,3bsex7,YachiyoTodoroki,3,Wed Jul 1 20:44:53 2015 UTC,"I am playing the multiplayer and having a blast!  But for now, the Plus edition is more than enough content for me and it's taking me awhile to learn how to attack all the India tracks with the free cars."
Driveclub,3bsex7,YachiyoTodoroki,3,Wed Jul 1 20:57:12 2015 UTC,"Hey, wanna play together in one club? I don't have anyone in mine so I can join yours if you're in the same situation. :)"
Driveclub,3bsex7,Sgt_ZigZag,2,Wed Jul 1 21:03:46 2015 UTC,I'm playing multi but getting last place every round anyway. It gets hard especially when I'm getting really fast and I have to drift on some sharp turns. People seem to have no problem but I either have to slow down a lot or bounce from the railings. People are passing me either way.
Driveclub,3bsex7,Sgt_ZigZag,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:56:52 2015 UTC,You never have to drift. In fact I firmly believe that you should almost never drift. You don't ever see F1 cars drift.
Driveclub,3btapy,YachiyoTodoroki,2,Wed Jul 1 23:40:49 2015 UTC,I'm having trouble getting the win 5 challenges one to pop. I've won about 10 and it still hasn't gone. Do think some of them are very buggy.
Driveclub,3btapy,furynads,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:19:16 2015 UTC,"I got my ""drive 1000 miles with the same club"" trophy today, so I don't think so."
Driveclub,3btapy,RoughlyForeignChiz,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:09:32 2015 UTC,"I will be glad if you'll check your statistics and tell me the value you've got in there - if that's the same distance aswell. Because I've already found posts about such bug, but they're like a year old."
Driveclub,3btapy,MeanElf,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:44:01 2015 UTC,"The values would be different, as you aren't driving for your club in every event. Like RoughlyForeignChiz says, you need to rack up that amount actually driving challenges (possibly online too) for your club.  It might have been bugged earlier, but all of those trophy issues got resolved quite a while ago."
Driveclub,3burgq,Professor_Terning,5,Thu Jul 2 09:04:48 2015 UTC,"""Choppy"" sounds like an exaggeration for one being lower frame-rate than what you're use to lol. I never had to get ""use to"" it because it(30fps) was perfectly fine for me. And btw, isn't the term choppy used for something that drops frame rate a lot, it's commonly known that Driveclub has a rock solid frame rate."
Driveclub,3burgq,tipytop,-2,Thu Jul 2 11:42:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, ""choppy"" probably isn't the correct word, because it's constant. To exaggerate, it feels like I'm watching a (really fast) slide show.  The funny thing is that I wouldn't mind at all if the graphics were less gorgeous, if I could just get that smooth racing experience, but I guess since the game has been out so long and other people don't find it a problem at all, there's not much chance of them changing it? Then we're back to me having to find a way to getting used to it. :)  (Perhaps someone is selling an Oculus Rift with an attached webcam that shows whatever you see IRL as really choppy? Then after a while I could take it off, play DriveClub and be like: ""This game is so smooth!"") :)"
Driveclub,3burgq,Stanshant,3,Thu Jul 2 12:21:08 2015 UTC,"It's probably the 30FPS versus 60FPS. I find that the latter does my head in sometimes, seems a little manic almost. It's not just with driving games, whenever I've played the 60FPS Dark Souls 2 remake, I get a slightly odd visual sensation which the 30FPS PS3 version never caused. Funnily enough, I don't get it with TLOU or Tomb Raider. There must be several variables at play."
Driveclub,3burgq,FINDTHESUN,2,Thu Jul 2 09:42:51 2015 UTC,"The only tip would be to stop playing PCars, ha"
Driveclub,3burgq,FINDTHESUN,1 point,Thu Jul 2 09:37:46 2015 UTC,"I love Project CARS, but I would almost consider it, because the cars and tracks in this game are just amazing! Do you think it might help?"
Driveclub,3burgq,DivineKaze,2,Thu Jul 2 09:40:23 2015 UTC,"Stanshant says it's the fps. Your eyes got used to 60 fps, that;s why 30 fps appears choppy now. Take some time off PCars and see how it affects your perception."
Driveclub,3btogy,BringiStrikes,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:41:43 2015 UTC,"Bear in mind that wherever you buy the game from, you'll need to buy the DLC from that region too, so you'd need to make an American account.

Driveclub,3br84b,GingerApe1,2,Wed Jul 1 16:48:52 2015 UTC,Good for you Arsenal! I remember talking to you when this game first came out! I just got back into DC this week. So you know I wasn't playing under my own PS4 or PS account which is why I wasn't on that often. Decided to finally buy a PS4 and a 4k tv to compliment it. Hit me up if you want to race sometime. my old tag was Pyopi69. It's now TruBornLegacy

Driveclub,3br84b,GingerApe1,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:48:01 2015 UTC,Thanks! It's nice but it's unfortunate that PS4 doesn't support it. But the upscaling is kinda nice. ; ) lol

Driveclub,3br84b,sacriker,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:49:36 2015 UTC,It's okay but it's not as good as full 4k. Project cars on PC is incredible in 4k

Driveclub,3btfse,phz10,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:24:59 2015 UTC,yea basically when you get the ps edition it just downloads the full game but obviously its locked until you buy it. so you dont have to download anything later if you upgrade

Btw. First race, I won this, and unlocked the car, some yellow mini or something. AND! - THIS CRAP SAYS - ""you can't use this car, you need to upgrade to full version of the game"".

I would personally make it a bit longer and add some color grading, but other than that, it was solid given what you were working with.  I try to make my videos more cinematic, but its a struggle finding out the content people truly want to see in a driving game. I honestly think you should keep at it, cause I loved it man!"
Driveclub,3bstfp,ReptarRising818,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:26:38 2015 UTC,Any challenges players send you or challenges that you send players. If you really want the trophy you can just send it to a friend who fails the challenge on purpose or make another PSN account and do that yourself.   As far as the online events I just played in a few hyper races a few minutes ago.
Driveclub,3bstfp,DivineKaze,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:20:24 2015 UTC,ahh i see thanks for that  as for the online thing im only seeing two types that are hyper which is some la ferrari exclusive races and the ps plus edition hyper races but nothing else. so idk

Driveclub,3bofqo,ktfright,2,Tue Jun 30 23:13:37 2015 UTC,"Not sure how you play, but you gotta use manual transmission and an upfront view, I prefer the bumper view. I find myself braking a lot earlier in this game compared to others. Braking is very important in this game. Exiting turns you need to ease to throttle on or even pause mid trigger pull to avoid spinning out. Don't smash cars to slow down and don't try to make first place on the first lap, unless it's easy of course. Basically just forget other games and have an open mind. I love how this game handles, I used to hate it. Hope this helps, the Ferrari tour is one of my favourites. Also sometimes you just haven't unlocked the best car for the track although all cars in the class should be able to win."
Driveclub,3bofqo,pocket_mulch,2,Tue Jun 30 22:32:49 2015 UTC,"Don't know what to say other than just practice. There's some events in the main tour which kicked my butt and I didn't know why. One in particular was called ""punching above your weight"" which in the end tought me to take corners very precisely with the right speed. Also a tip, go on the inside of corners if you're following a line of cars and shove them out the way with a decent speed (not too fast or you'll get a penalty), this is my typical procedure for getting from the back to the front. The rest is just about driving well enough not to crash/mess up."
Driveclub,3bofqo,tipytop,2,Tue Jun 30 23:26:56 2015 UTC,"Do some time trial events , and keep driving around the same track, increasing your lap times more and more. Try manual transmission if you are not using it already.   Generally when going into turns you want to come from the outside, turn in, and drive back toward to outside, while easing back on the gas.   Also it may help to know that when trying to slow down for a turn, you don't have to slam on the breaks, you can ease into the breaks. But that depends.  Hope this helps."

As Snuggie says,chasing TT ghosts is also a great way to improve. Oh and lastly,turn off the minimap,it's distracting and with it gone you'll make yourself learn the track quicker. Good luck!"

Driveclub,3bofqo,devilspawn6x,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:05:37 2015 UTC,"Some how the handling of this game is really pro late brake and turn in. Plus I have a feeling that the AIs are programmed to chase u as close as possible when you are in first place, no matter how fast u go, so once u get to 1st place just go with an aggressive defence style."

Driveclub,3bnt4r,Sgt_ZigZag,2,Tue Jun 30 18:53:14 2015 UTC,I think that's a terrible idea personally. The full game would give you more tracks and lots of great cars. The season pass will only give you more cars. You still won't be able to play anything but India online.
Driveclub,3bnt4r,Sgt_ZigZag,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:27:24 2015 UTC,So the season pass won't unlock any tracks with the ps+ edition?
Driveclub,3bnt4r,Eighty-Es,2,Wed Jul 1 20:19:03 2015 UTC,Nope. The tracks have always been free but by using the ps+ version you're locked to India only. You really should buy the full game first before you buy the season pass.

On Rookie and simi-pro I can win races with any of the cars, even the unlock cars.    Maybe if rolling in a Lambo or Mclaren is your thing I can see how it would matter... but this game seems to really be about the driver and less about the car.   This could be both good and bad.

Driveclub,3binr9,MeanElf,3,Mon Jun 29 15:35:19 2015 UTC,"Feather your acceleration through corners is always a good one to help you keep your speed up throughout and it helps the old slow-in-fast-out approach.

Driveclub,3binr9,alex_dlc,2,Tue Jun 30 01:01:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah I bought the base game after enjoying the PS+ version too, (I'll get season pass later) I usually play Gran turismo but it's annoying to have to hook up the ps3 each time I just want to drive around a bit, DC is my ps4's first racing title, it's not realistic, but it plays well enough for me.   I'm glad that it's still realistic enough that same basic laws still apply in here as it did in Gran turismo, learning the track, finding out the braking points will help with time trials, this game absolutely reward accuracy and precision.   When driving into corners don't brake late and skid out of the corner exit, you lose acceleration due to tires not gripping, you want to maximize the amount of time you can accelerate to achieve higher top speeds. Go slow in and fast out. Use those flags to determine where to brake, the flag colors also indicate the severity of the bends too, so be sure to turn on the flags.. I had crowds turned off not realizing it turns flags off too."
Driveclub,3binr9,ktfright,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:08:31 2015 UTC,"I noticed that the color of the flags indicate the severity of the turn depending on speed, but did not realize they tell you when to turn.    Knowing when to break, when to turn, how hard to do both of these, and when and how hard to accellerate seems to be the name of the game.  Once I get that down the rest should be easy."
Driveclub,3binr9,FINDTHESUN,3,Mon Jun 29 18:12:34 2015 UTC,"No they don't tell you when to turn, you need to make a mental note where the braking and turning points are and the flags simply make for good visual marker for that."
Driveclub,3bjy7y,AndreOfAstoria,2,Mon Jun 29 20:56:07 2015 UTC,"I tend to feather the gas or lower my speed and hitting the handbrake in the corner, but it may just be the angle that you're coming from. I also like to use my actual brake in unison with the gas to try and contain my drift better."
Driveclub,3bjy7y,ktfright,4,Tue Jun 30 05:20:54 2015 UTC,If your car is skidding you're doing it wrong. Do you ever see an F1 car skid or drift around a turn? Slow down before you start turning and don't let your car skid at all. Drive like you'd drive in real life.
Driveclub,3bjy7y,Sgt_ZigZag,4,Mon Jun 29 22:16:28 2015 UTC,"Not the you're wrong, but it looks like OP might be actually referring to drifting after carefully reading his post. He worded it so strangely"

Driveclub,3bjy7y,FINDTHESUN,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:09:53 2015 UTC,"You're on the right track -- I find that entry speed is very important for drifts. When you hit Circle to handbrake into the drift, if you feel like you have too much speed, hit L2 along with Circle to brake at the same time. These brakes aren't your everyday car's; they slow you down much quicker, and that can help a lot with getting the right angle on a drift so you emerge from it right where you want to be."
Driveclub,3bjy7y,SenseiSNES,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:54:51 2015 UTC,"Enter with generous speed. Some turns require you to enter the turn wide or tight. Regardless, turn into the turn hard and at the same time press and hold circle till your back end slides out. Now from here, you give the car gas to keep that end out, and the wheels spinning. If the car is starting to regain its tail end traction, then give it more gas, combine the gas with the handbreak if you need to kick the tail hard. If the tail is sliding out TOO far, then release the gas and use the L2 break to bring the car back to a controllable angle and then hit the gas, its a balancing act."
Driveclub,3bjy7y,Acesofbelkan,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:01:04 2015 UTC,"Drifting? If it's a 90 degree turn, hold the handbrake until your car is almost the full 90 degrees sideways then let go. Keep your gas on full throttle and hit the normal brake sparingly to stay straight. Steer into the skid at first then away from it. Straighten the wheels as you exit. Once you've slowed down enough you'll gain traction and start going again. Practice makes perfect, just keep trying. Good luck.  Regular turns? Enter at high speed and hit the brakes to slow down entering the turn. Let go of the brake as you start to steer into the apex. Start slow on the gas or tap it until you pass the mid point of the turn then full throttle coming out."
Driveclub,3bjy7y,wheatle,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:59:08 2015 UTC,"Its a mix of speed, handbrake and regular brakes, as well as steering to keep your drift going in the right direction. Speed can cause you to spin out or crash into the wall, but the brakes are really strong and can slow you down very fast."
Driveclub,3bjy7y,awokenthehive,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:34:57 2015 UTC,"Sometimes you can hold the brakes and gas at the same time to slow for the corner and get the turn, but usually you hit the handbrake long enough to fishtail then you let go and start kind of taping the gas to keep it in the drift"

But if you want the extra tracks, cars and events, you will need a season pass.    So basically, $25 for the full game and $25 for season pass.  I just updated my PS+ version and loving the game!"
Driveclub,3bgn6p,Akira619,2,Mon Jun 29 08:41:55 2015 UTC,"The regular edition is the full game so yes you absolutely get more than the plus edition .  the season pass is just all the added cars, tour events and new venues.

Driveclub,3bfdy5,devilspawn6x,2,Sun Jun 28 20:28:30 2015 UTC,How do you tell a deliberate bump from an accidental one?
Driveclub,3bfdy5,Spokker,4,Sun Jun 28 21:18:03 2015 UTC,"When they go out of their way to make contact with you to prevent you from passing, usually on a long straight."
Driveclub,3bfdy5,Spokker,2,Sun Jun 28 21:29:02 2015 UTC,"I would think that was a valid tactic, to look behind your car and see who is coming up and try to block them. Of course the risk is that you aren't watching the road and may crash yourself.  Risk/reward."
Driveclub,3bfdy5,chicken_and_ham,5,Sun Jun 28 21:45:11 2015 UTC,It is nearly all of the time detrimental to both parties to smash together like so. Way better thinking of you see someone is going to pass you on a straight to get in the slipstream and plan a move that would break the possibility of being slipstreamed back.
Driveclub,3bfdy5,Spokker,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:54:50 2015 UTC,Interesting. I'll have to see what happens when multiplayer is finally unlocked for me.

Driveclub,3bfdy5,NachoManSandyRavage,3,Mon Jun 29 10:20:36 2015 UTC,There's a diffrenece between a block and a bump. A block youll just put your car in the way to prevent a pass and take up as much room as you can. Maybe even a slight side press would be considered fair play to most people. But the assholes will wait until youre mostly past them then drive through your rear end to spin you out
Driveclub,3bfdy5,TheSabrykovsky,2,Sun Jun 28 23:18:34 2015 UTC,"you need to understand its a domino effect, someone bump then everybody does by revenge lol"
Driveclub,3bfdy5,luckydiavel,2,Mon Jun 29 05:46:34 2015 UTC,It's my biggest problem with playing online i wish they would introduce damage to cars to try stop the ramming nothing worse than having a good race then dick bag decides to take you out on the last corner
Driveclub,3bfdy5,Halbridious,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:31:24 2015 UTC,Really?  Are you kidding?  I've played with a friend in PS+ lobbies and every time someone rams me last corner  I need private lobbies so some fucktard can't just ram me penalty free every time.
Driveclub,3bfdy5,Halbridious,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:50:16 2015 UTC,I find when new players hit me its because they are just bad drivers that aren't braking enough or not driving the correct line. I'm generally fine with that. The best remedy for those guys is to just try and pull away from them.
Driveclub,3bfdy5,Jasd1234,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:50:22 2015 UTC,"There's a difference between the players that generally crash all over (my friend hits a wall every other turn) and the players who think your car is their bumper for the last turn of every race.    It's pretty hard to pull away when they draft you into that last corner.  If you're lucky you can brake a little early and throw them off, but that sacrifices a lot of speed.  Quite frankly, I wish the game actually punished players who hit you (the ""collision"" penalty is usually faster to recover from then being launched into the fence and spinning out)"
Driveclub,3bfdy5,Halbridious,2,Mon Jun 29 02:46:31 2015 UTC,"I drive cautious as fuck at the start and just wait for a gap to appear to put your foot down, you can keep up with everyone thrashing each other in the corners just taking your time and when it inevitably goes tits up just squeeze through.  I think I've yet to be in an online race where the top 3 aren't 5+ seconds in front of the rest of the pack and it's usually the 3 that don't contest for the first corner straight off the bat"
Driveclub,3bfdy5,Fallout_Duck,2,Mon Jun 29 10:25:41 2015 UTC,"I try and just race the cleanest I can, and normally that gets you ahead if you didn't get caught up in the scrum, but there's almost always the guy that manages to draft you into that last corner, when you just have to hope they're not an asshole.  I also am getting very tired of people using some kind of lag glitch, dunno how they do it, but they just get ghosted through the pack and suddenly they're 100 yards ahead of everyone.  That's happening almost every race at this point."

Driveclub,3bgcfv,Cryptic-Panther,8,Sun Jun 28 23:55:15 2015 UTC,The weather effects are some of the best going in any game via both consoles and pc.  Im guessing they are hoping to show off the engine.  I'm not a fan of racing in the rain exclusively either but know that in the base game its not a frequent thing.
Driveclub,3bgcfv,Rorbotron,4,Mon Jun 29 00:29:56 2015 UTC,Yeah in the base game it isn't. But in the new tours they do use way too much rain. I like a challenge which the rain provides but I too am tired of rainy events
Driveclub,3bgcfv,Sincitysir1,2,Mon Jun 29 03:12:41 2015 UTC,Yea they get tiresome for sure.  I personally run a lot of time trials and challenges.  I don't think I have even half the tour events completed but I've had the game for a good long while.  I need to run through them but without the competitive angle I sometimes cant muster the desire.
Driveclub,3bgcfv,Rorbotron,-2,Mon Jun 29 03:39:15 2015 UTC,"The rain effects in project cars is also amazing. And I can appreciate how awesome this game looks, but the constant rain is just Bullshit."

Driveclub,3bg0f8,Vince853,7,Sun Jun 28 22:08:30 2015 UTC,"You have the possibility of fifteen cars in total, all of which will enable you to get the platinum. Of course the rest are there behind a lock and key because that's what you get when you pay for a game, the full deal.  This is just a taster, so you can try it out. At least you can earn a platinum if you are able."
Driveclub,3bg0f8,MeanElf,4,Sun Jun 28 22:23:28 2015 UTC,Evolution also didn't need to release a more in depth demo at all.  They want you to spend the money for the full game.  It's worth the expense as is the season pass.  I still say the season pass is the best season pass I've ever purchased.
Driveclub,3bg0f8,Rorbotron,3,Mon Jun 29 00:31:47 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I respect when people have a different opinion, but less so when they just launch at something without knowing what they are talking about."
Driveclub,3bg0f8,MeanElf,0,Mon Jun 29 00:44:37 2015 UTC,Would have been nice if it has been you know most of the tracks and all but a hand full of the cars like they said...
Driveclub,3bg0f8,devedander,2,Mon Jun 29 05:08:01 2015 UTC,"It's just a big demo, they want people to buy the actual game after all."
Driveclub,3bg0f8,Rorbotron,0,Mon Jun 29 05:51:19 2015 UTC,"That's what it turned into, but when it was first announced it was supposed to be pretty much a full game minus a little fluff.   Basically it was marketed as proof that as part of PS+ You would get full AAA quality games, not just rehash indies etc.   The full retail version was supposed to be slightly more than the PS+ version.   The PS+ version wasn't supposed to be a demo."
Driveclub,3bg0f8,devedander,2,Mon Jun 29 07:49:13 2015 UTC,I totally disagree and am almost certain you are completely wrong.  The PS+ version was going to have multi/couple venues and a handful of cars.  Evolution would stand to make very little money if it were going to be nearly a full game and just a little fluff.  PS+ was also dishing out full quality AAA titles on the PS3.  The + version was always going to be a extended demo. EDIT: just did some reddit digging.  Same game minus tracks and cars which is exactly what it is right now.
Driveclub,3bg0f8,Rorbotron,0,Mon Jun 29 07:55:42 2015 UTC,"And so you would be the one who is wrong.  Look I've been through this dozens of times with the same type of people... those who didn't follow the whole thing closely from the get go.   I was eyeballs deep in PS4 and XBONE hype a year before the launch all the way up until finally deciding on the PS4 at launch over the XBONE and a huge part of it was Sony's promise of how PS+ would be a better value than Live.   And I think PS+ is a better value than live, but they definitely didn't follow through on how it would be in many ways.   DC being the biggest example... you can make all the arguments you want about how much money they wouldn't make giving away most of the game but that was exactly the point Sony harped on - PSPlus would be a huge value because you would get AAA quality titles form first party dev houses (note the first party part - this was because it was largely sold as the idea that while third party companies wouldn't give away big titles on Plus for exactly the profit reason, Sony was basically saying because we get your money with plus it will let us do this!)  DC was supposed to be their day one proof of concept.   Release with the PS4 and the PSPlus version would represent an unprecedented value and show you what you should expect regularly as a PSPlus member.   Basically PS Plus was sold as a sort of seasons pass - think if this was a music venue it would have been along the lines of ""you can come into all the big name concerts we host, but you will have to be 10 rows back and you won't get to hear the last song of the night at each one like regular paid ticket holders will"".  This was because obviously they had to get the PS crowd to accept paying for online MP when it was free on PS3 and was a big reason people chose PS over Xbox.  So basically they hyped it up, got us to buy PS4s and lock ourselves into PS+ subscription service and then pulled heavily back on what they actually gave.   BTW Here is why you are wrong:  http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=79403849&postcount=1714  "" remember its the full game minus a few cars/tracks.""  Does the PSPlus versions trike you as the full game minus a ""few"" cars and tracks?  They never did specify exactly what would be left out but I don't think anyone can reasonably argue that 15 cars and 1 location is ""minus a few cars and tracks"" do you?"
Driveclub,3bg0f8,devedander,0,Mon Jun 29 17:39:12 2015 UTC,"Where in any of that post, which I've already read during my process of digging yesterday does it imply that it would be anything more than a track and 15 cars? Plus multiplayer?  It very clearly states that AFTER you upgrade you can get all the trophies and all the content.  PS plus was also dishing out top tier plus content before the release of the ps4.  I'm sorry dude, buts its you that is once again incorrect.  Edit: you also incorrectly assume that I didn't follow it closely from the very beginning.  I had never had an interest in the xbone but I had a strong interest in driveclub.  I loved the project Gotham games and was very excited for DC.  The plus edition was delayed and the launch was a mess.  I waited a little until I read about how evolution was working diligently to improve the experience.  I bought the game for 40, almost immediately bought the season pass and haven't looked back."
Driveclub,3bg0f8,Rorbotron,2,Mon Jun 29 18:14:37 2015 UTC,"I literally quoted it:  "" remember its the full game minus a few cars/tracks.""  How many cars are in the full game? 55?  How many cars in PSPlus? 15?  How many tracks are in the full game? 50?  How many tracks are in PSPlus?  11?  So explain to me how missing 70-80% of the cars and tracks is ""minus a few""?  Even if it was HALF the cars and tracks of the full game it would be pretty disingenuous to say ""minus a few"".  As for including multiplayer - they said the full game, not the full game minus multiplayer or minus certain game modes etc... which is exactly why it shouldn't be viewed as ever being acceptable as a demo... it clearly wasn't promised as such.  EDIT well if you have actually followed it from the beginning how could this be the first time someone has pointed out to you the whole ""minus a few cars and tracks"" thing?  How could you think that the idea that they would make more money selling it and using PS+ as a demo was ever an issue considering how it was proposed from day one?  And while you may have followed DC did you follow Sony and the PS4 hype train?  That's where the story really comes together... it's like saying I am a huge Raiders fan and pay close attention to the team, but if you don't watch the news about the NFL in general you may not see how the whole story.  DC as a product on it's own has a story but as a pawn in the game of the console wars it has a whole other story."
Driveclub,3bg0f8,devedander,0,Mon Jun 29 18:23:10 2015 UTC,"Unless I'm completely blind there is nothing in that neogaf link that suggests track number or cars.  Secondly the xbone shot its own foot off with all the drm and online all the time.  They were then forced to backtrack but by the time the backtracking started those on the fence had already chosen a side.  The full game of driveclub is very inexpensive right now from several outlets.  If you enjoy the game buy it, but sitting here trying to play it up as some sort of pawn in a console war that isn't even a war anymore is comical."

Always plan at the very least 3 corners ahead, i personally try to plan as many as 5. Also remember the tire has a certain amount of grip, find a car you like and play around with it.

Just a touch of sim added to it...meaning the cars have weight and if you're not careful you can crash and ruin your chances in wining the race.    Fun fantastic game, really. Especially if you have the DLC cars like the lambo and such."
Driveclub,3bcils,fahedtariq,2,Sat Jun 27 22:36:54 2015 UTC,They will. All we can do is just to wait.
Driveclub,3bcils,Qudideluxe,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:10:07 2015 UTC,"Shouldn't be too long now, they said that after the PS+ version is out, they'd follow. So, assuming everything is stable, it won't be long."
Driveclub,3bbjpz,BRIANN046,5,Sat Jun 27 17:23:30 2015 UTC,Get the season pass. You get a ton of content. Probably one of the best value season passes.
Driveclub,3bbjpz,Lollerscooter,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:04:51 2015 UTC,"I would also like to know this. I was going to wait a few weeks until I bought the season pass, but if this one is going away after they release the last part of the pass on the 30th, then I guess I'm going to have to buy it now and eat nothing but rice and beans for the next few weeks. lol"
Driveclub,3bbjpz,VaderPrime1,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:49:18 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure this season pass isn't going away even if they release a new one. That ""November till July"" mention it's there just as a disclaimer so they let you know that if anything comes after the end of July 2015, it won't be covered by this season pass, but by another one, or individual purchase, or expansion etc..."
Driveclub,3bbjpz,stripes3,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:54:47 2015 UTC,"Basically, it finishes in July. No news yet about a second season pass but the Evolution team has been condensed to focus on DriveClub as 'a service', which tells me they're going to keep supporting it in some way. Besides, it'd be absurd to dump it weeks after releasing this PS+ edition. The Season Pass is well worth it, some great cars and events. I bought it within a couple of days of getting the full game, and I'd never been a fan of racers at all."
Driveclub,3bbjpz,Stanshant,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:49:49 2015 UTC,"The Season Pass Content releases near the end of every month. So in this instance 30th June. The July content will release around the 20-30th July. However i'd still recommend it as you'd even have a better experience than what you have right now.   There is also no second Season Pass. As that has not been confirmed. If you buy the Season Pass, i think you save upwards of at least 60-70% on the total amount you would spend if you bought them all individually.   So Season Pass is a MUST buy"
Driveclub,3bbjpz,ArsenalKid1990,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:09:23 2015 UTC,"Hey guys thx for the replies !! I already decided to buy the season pass. But should i buy it now or wait on info about the second season pass to avoid the risk paying twice for something i could have got in 1 time? For example: if there comes a second season pass and i buy it, does it unlock also the tours from season 1 or not?"
Driveclub,3bbjpz,ArsenalKid1990,2,Sat Jun 27 18:21:16 2015 UTC,"Buy it now, there might not even be a second one, but if there is we would all have to pay for it again anyway :)"
Driveclub,3bbjpz,Qudideluxe,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:25:19 2015 UTC,I highly doubt that there is a second season Pass. Most of the Developer arent working anymore on this Project. I guess they are working on a new game already.
Driveclub,3bbjpz,MeanElf,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:05:37 2015 UTC,"Even if there is a second season pass, it won't include the first one as well. Season passes, like their name suggest will give you content from one the start to finish of that season.  If a second one gets produced, that'll give you access to the content from that period."
Driveclub,3bbjpz,Jamie0911,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:55:41 2015 UTC,"On a slight tangent, why do people think there might be a second season pass if nothing's been confirmed?"
Driveclub,3bbjpz,ArsenalKid1990,3,Sat Jun 27 18:24:41 2015 UTC,Because Evo Studios have confirmed that they'll be making more development towards the game. They want to build more on what they have.

Driveclub,3bbjpz,KniteMonkey,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:52:03 2015 UTC,They haven't announced a second set of DLC so this set enda next month. No point waiting as you will get it all. If they make a second season it will be a separate $25 pass.

Driveclub,3bbvu2,MrSnowball_,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:09:45 2015 UTC,"Hit a barrier. Void drift score. Spin out during drift. Void drift score.  Just adding those two things would improve the legitimacy of the leaderboards in drift modes.   Too many ghosts where I've seen people drift straight into walls and get a higher score than cleanly holding a drift through a corner. Not to mention ones where people essentially spin out and are rewarded with a higher score than if they had held the drift. If you spin out or cease forward momentum during a drift zone, it should be voided back to zero. I can't recall how many times I've seen ghosts spin out, drive backwards a bit (not enough to trigger a respawn) and start another drift in the same zone to pad their score.  Its ridiculous. The only way to get to the top of some of these leaderboards is to essentially game the system, which just takes the fun out of the whole thing. Like I said, just adding those two qualifiers to the rule system would mean the leaderboards would be topped by people who can actually drift, not spin out and hit walls."
Driveclub,3bbvu2,JBSpeed,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:15:04 2015 UTC,"If you played the game before they fixed drifitng, crashing into walls was sometimes the only way to get a high enough score to win."
Driveclub,3bbvu2,KniteMonkey,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:35:59 2015 UTC,"It seems it's still the most effective way to get the best score, I'm just not doing any drifting on this game anymore"
Driveclub,3bbvu2,KniteMonkey,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:40:53 2015 UTC,They really fixed it from what it was but the handling model doesn't really make drifting easy in the game.
Driveclub,3bbvu2,Onionsteak,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:11:27 2015 UTC,"It should be more like Gran Turismo, more points for drifting the racing line, more points for higher angle and speed, point reset for leaving track and/or hitting barrier."

When you go to the store and search ""Driveclub"" is there two names that pop up and they both say ""Driveclub?"" If so, one of them is where you buy the game, just try both until you find it. That's what happened to me."

Driveclub,3b8s4h,SnuggieX,17,Fri Jun 26 22:05:15 2015 UTC,"The reason why people are saying it sucks is because they still think the quality of the game is the same as what it was at DRIVECLUB's somewhat shaky start.

It has a good variety in cars and tracks.   Now what I don't like, is how I can handle the cars. For me personally the controls are too sensitive and there is no option too adjust them. Makes the game pretty difficult to drive for me. I'm not a hardcore racer, but I do enjoy running a few races every now and then. I was pretty decent at games like forza. But I have a lot more trouble controlling driveclub."

Driveclub,3b9ruq,mrolive1,3,Sat Jun 27 03:43:03 2015 UTC,"Very common complaint about the game is the AI.  Personally, I found the AI super easy to deal with.   It is incredibly predictable. There is very little doubt what will happen during a race. On corners they brake early and take it right along the ""perfect"" racing line. All of them. There is no deviation, short of one being pushed off the track by another car following the line.  Getting into first is quite easy. Anticipate the AI's movements. You see a corner coming up? They're going to take it perfectly, so line up on the inside. Use them as a rubbing board if you have to. Take (minor) shortcuts through the corners. You can get away with some pretty massive hits on them.   Or use the outside line. You won't need to brake quite as hard, so  you can carry a bit more speed through the turn. Accelerate along with them, push them out of the way - they will move on a straight if you make them.  Getting 1st on the Tour races isn't that difficult. Time trials/drifts are different stories, but races aren't hard if you can learn to game the AI.   As for weather...Yeah it's pretty bad. Can't see shit when it's night snow/rain, AI don't give a fuck.   tl;dr - don't let the AI push you around. They don't react to you being there passive. Shove into them, they adjust.  Case in Point - ~1:56 in your video, taking that turn before the finish line - it's hard to see, but it's there - the red BMW on your left swerves left to not smash into you. AI does see you.   Push them out of the way."
Driveclub,3b9ruq,Moonhowler22,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:49:50 2015 UTC,"I think this kind of backs up the point that the AI is kind of lame... if you have to push them around to pass it's no good.   Racing should be about avoiding contact and not going off track.    When the AI bunches up in a line as they do, even when you manage to carry speed into a corner better than them and pass, you run into the problem of it being impossible to get back into the pack without nudging someone, and if you don't get back into the pack they slowly edge you off course.   The AI does need to be a bit less perfect and more dynamic.   We all agree on the weather issue it seems."
Driveclub,3b9ruq,devedander,2,Mon Jun 29 05:17:54 2015 UTC,"Not sure which game is doing AI better,but in most motorsport i watch,a lot of the time it's a line of cars all following the main driving line,rather than everyone taking seperate paths allowing  a sneaky chancer like myself to slot in.One things for sure,both AI's are better than some of the online drivers:) As for the weather,when i first raced against the AI i had the same issue,they seemed superhuman.Turns out i just needed to get better.It's such a great feeling in cockpit view of a La Ferrari,windscreen wipers going turning into a bend you know is there but can't quite see and coming out the other side 1 car closer to first place."
Driveclub,3b9ruq,bloodsugar6,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:57:07 2015 UTC,"While in motorsports generally everyone does follow a line and try for the best racing line, they also are not perfect and will vary in speed and reaction time.  You will notice IRL gaps open, people miss braking points, respond to attempts to overtake etc which gives you dynamic opportunities to pass.   In this game the AI kind of makes a rolling wall that you can't usually get around without playing dirty.   And IRL racing contact is very much frowned upon so the need to make contact to pass in most circumstances is pretty wrong."
Driveclub,3b9ruq,devedander,2,Mon Jun 29 05:22:55 2015 UTC,"If you watch a replay from their perspective,all of them, then you'll see that they do make mistakes, some spin out, others crash after taking a corner too fast. Atlantershavsvegn is a good example of a place to see this, after the tunnel heading up onto the land.  It's also called a driving line for a reason, being the optimum line for the drivers to take - so that's what most of them will do. You can see others deviating from it though.  I have no problem wit the AI as they make it all a lot more tense."

Driveclub,3b8x8a,Crysik,2,Fri Jun 26 22:49:11 2015 UTC,"First the dumbest question, is the Upgrade edition on the PSN Store the same as the disc version? (ie. I can buy the season pass for the Upgrade version)   I would assume so? If the PS Plus Upgrade is the full game then the Season Pass should be available for that. But if you're still in doubt, you can always tweet to Rushy33 on twitter, he's the game director and answers pretty much any question he can get his hands on   Does the season pass include all the content released so far?   Yes it does, i think however you will have to download all of the expansion packs that have been released over time, that's the only downside.   Will the new Nissan GTR dlc be included in the current season pass?   The Nissan GT-R will be released along with the new tour packs on June 30th! Date may differ depending on where you are located.   What happens with dlc that is released after July when the current season pass isn't valid anymore? (Will another pass be released or will all future dlc be sold separately?)   Paul, the game director. Has told us that there will be ongoing development towards the game, but every question relating to car or track or even Driveclub related tweets results in a ""We will have to see in the future, we would like to continue development on DRIVECLUB""  Well similar to that anyways, not exactly."

Driveclub,3b60sw,Lenininy,16,Fri Jun 26 06:46:15 2015 UTC,"My top tip is to feather the brakes and the gas. Once I started using the triggers as pedals and not just on/off switches it made a massive difference and I started eating into the tour stars. If you slam on the gas coming out of a corner, you'll spin. If you put full brakes on, you'll lock and slide into the barrier. Get your speed of entry right, turn into the corner and accelerate smoothly out into the straight. Likewise, don't brake into the corner, you'll lock and slide. Brake, then turn, then accelerate. Obviously, you can turn and tap the brakes/gas through a corner to adjust for max speed and racing line but I'm talking tap tap tapping. Treat the trigger like a lovely piece of fish, not a lump of sour dough.   Aside from that, it comes down to learning the nuances of the courses. Generally, I find I can take most green corners at max acceleration. Most yellows only require some lift and coast. Reds need accurate braking and be careful not to spin upon exit. Weather conditions add a little extra spice but these fundamentals have got me to three stars on the first 90% of tour events. Now I need to get to grips with the hyper cars."

Driveclub,3b7236,chomskynoam,1 point,Fri Jun 26 14:21:42 2015 UTC,If you have PS+ you have access to the PS+ version of Driveclub.  It's the single player game with no multi.  Check your downloads menu or try to download again.  It's been taking anywhere from an hour to 10 hours for some people.

Driveclub,3b7236,MeanElf,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:41:23 2015 UTC,"I think that's the rationale. There's plenty to do and learn in SP before people jump into MP anyway. I know that certain people will always got straight for MP but with cars to unlock and tracks to learn...as well as the same tracks under a variety of conditions, it's all good.  The AI are tough but rewarding. I suggest saving a few replays from SP and watching them from different angles to appreciate how you are doing on the track."

Driveclub,3b4nu4,Kozwella,3,Thu Jun 25 22:58:54 2015 UTC,I have no idea how pCars plays online. DC however doesn't currently have an online leaderboard situation or a statistic for races won vs lost. It does have a regular in-game leaderboard though.
Driveclub,3b4nu4,MeanElf,2,Thu Jun 25 23:20:17 2015 UTC,Project Cars has a much more serious group of racers in my experience. I prefer singleplayer races compared to online races because you can stack the grid to up to 40 opponents I believe!
Driveclub,3b4nu4,Imperium14,3,Fri Jun 26 02:31:54 2015 UTC,"Well, due to being more of a sim, I'd assumed that it would have a fanbase akin to Gran Turismo in what it wants."
Driveclub,3b4nu4,MeanElf,3,Fri Jun 26 15:44:35 2015 UTC,"Driveclub is definitely more arcade. It satisfies the car enthusiasts love for going fast since Driveclub offers faster speeds and better handling. You pick your car and go. Project Cars is very very different. It is more closely linked with Gran Turismo than Driveclub. It has real damage and if you drive too hard you will blow your engine. If you rear end an opponent you will be damaged and it will affect your car. Project Cars is definitely a driving simulator and it is so rewarding when you can tune your car right, avoid opponents, and cross the line in first place."

Evolution screwed up with the PS plus edition. But has done a tremendous job with the game and the season pass is probably the most I've gotten from a season pass ever.  They really redeemed themselves with the gamers that actually bought the retail version of the game."

Driveclub,3awqdu,FINDTHESUN,2,Wed Jun 24 17:51:00 2015 UTC,It's gonna be ok.. They'll try Driveclub and realize how cool it is!
Driveclub,3awqdu,SamManning17,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:53:00 2015 UTC,I'm actually here because I'm excited for it. I rented it from Redbox but never purchased it. It wasn't bad at all from what I remember.
Driveclub,3awqdu,CornflakeJustice,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:15:38 2015 UTC,"I mean, right this second I'm insanely frustrated by it. Part of that is me, I'm having a hard time figuring out the feel of the game, part of it is the stuff that is in the game. There's like two cars I can drive (I don't really like either) and it seems the only way to get any other cars is to continue driving in these non-fun cars. Plus in order to get even the free stuff they're offering you have to buy the game.  Game is beyond gorgeous but there are definitely some things I'm not particularly impressed with. I'm hoping I can pick up a car I actually like shortly but there is a LOT of stuff cut from this game for the demo.  EDIT:  I should have mentioned. I was extraordinarily excited about this game, I mean huge excitement. I'm a huge fan of racing games despite being bad at them and it'd been a long while since I had one that looked fun. News about the game's PS+ edition has been really frustrating to watch as it went from just being the game to the ""full game demo"" and then all of the delays.  Give me a few hours with it and I'm sure some of my opinions will have changed. Plus as I understand it you aren't even going to see the PS+edition players on the multiplayer because the switch to put us in it hasn't been flipped."

PC's AI just rams you every chance they get...dive-bombing you into oblivion and you c an never fully recover. It infuriates me to no end...and makes me fire up DC instead. Fine by me. :)"
Driveclub,3aqzkl,R0CK3733R,3,Tue Jun 23 02:15:25 2015 UTC,"You just need to practice man, stop holding R2 the whole race and brake early. I've almost got all 855 stars."
Driveclub,3aqzkl,quinnmct,3,Tue Jun 23 01:30:10 2015 UTC,"I have all 855 stars, this guys advice is on point. Break early saves a lot of time. Better to break too early and hug a turn tightly, than blow past the breaking window, and end up taking the whole turn from the outside and seeing the DC AI make you look dumb by overtaking you from the inside of the turn.   Also, you can block the AI from overtaking you. This dirty tactic saved many races for me at the final stretch."

Driveclub,3aqzkl,MeanElf,2,Tue Jun 23 01:35:31 2015 UTC,This is the approach alright. They are tough to keep each race feeling competitive but they will ease off during the last lap or section if it's a P2P race.  Another advantage to completing a race is you can then view the replay. You'd be surprised at how often AI cars that appear to ram you purposefully had in fact no choice as they were cut up.

Driveclub,3ajkhq,GralFarrell,3,Sat Jun 20 20:43:19 2015 UTC,if the tours get too stressful just do a few regular time trials to get a feel of the track and understand racing lines and stuff. also drive club is not a sim like Forza it's sort of like grid

I would love for the devs to make a mode for open or private lobbies, where the tracks are completely open and there aren't restrictions to going the wrong way. It would just need to apply to circuit tracks, and games like forza and asseto corsa have them already. Let it be the only mode where you earn limited fame points or something too."
Driveclub,3ajkhq,mrwynd,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:13:12 2015 UTC,"Closest thing would be to play a circuit race in Time Trial mode. It has unlimited number of laps, just race a car and get use to it."
Driveclub,3ajkhq,NachoManSandyRavage,2,Mon Jun 22 20:16:52 2015 UTC,Throttle Control! Learn to accelerate without spinning the tire when exiting a corner. Also learn how you can brake before the corner. What you want to do is maximize the amount of grip you car has availible to turn and use all of it. If youre braking while turning then you dont have as much to do both task at the same time. Same goes for accelerating. Dont be afraid to stay in hot hatches and performance cars for awhile as those cars are very good at teaching you basic technique while leaving you enough wiggle room for mistakes while youre learning while also making it obvious when you do mess up.
Driveclub,3ajkhq,NachoManSandyRavage,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:39:26 2015 UTC,"Thank you or the advice, I am absolutely loving the BMW's so far, It is the range I have enjoyed the game most with. I am still fairly new to it, but the visuals the sun effects everything is beautiful. I have a slight problem with grip on rainy surfaces."
Driveclub,3ajkhq,MeanElf,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:24:42 2015 UTC,Thats where throttle control comes in and knowing when to put the hammer down. The BMW is probably one of the best cars in class in my opinion during the rain but you have to have good throttle control to avoid it spinning and also be able to modify your braking points enough to slow down enough for the corners/ Best way to practice is doing a time trail in the rain on a circuit course with alot of tight turns and elevation changes like India or Chilie. Eventually youll start to get a feel for it
Driveclub,3ajkhq,R0CK3733R,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:53:44 2015 UTC,"Are you not enjoying the game then?  I feel I should point out first that DC isn't really a simulator. Granted the handling model is far more complex than many give it credit for, but still, it's a combination of arcade style with sim elements.  The AI are dynamic and can be very aggressive. They generally let you keep up with them though, especially at lower levels. If you get rough with them, expect rougher treatment in return, so aiming for a clean race improves your chances of finishing higher. You also get used to the likely behaviour, so in combination with learning the track is TT you will know where and when it's safe to pass them.  Feather the throttle on corners and you can generally brake later than you might expect."
Driveclub,3ajkhq,NachoManSandyRavage,2,Sun Jun 21 00:29:35 2015 UTC,"I have it downloading, it is not that I am not enjoying it the thing is that I just have not played many racing games and I tought maybe there were some must knows about it."
Driveclub,3ajkhq,R0CK3733R,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:59:49 2015 UTC,The first thing you should do is switch the controls to use the DS4's gyroscope for steering. The stick is way too sensitive but motion is great! I wish all racing titles would allow me to do this...
Driveclub,3ajkhq,devilspawn6x,3,Sun Jun 21 04:22:31 2015 UTC,"Actually this is bad advice. The motion controls are not accurate at all. Either get a wheel or a stick extension like Kontrol Freaks. That will take some of the edge of the steering but if you play alot of shooters, you probably have enough stick control to play. Best thing i can tell you is find your limit and work at it. Dont jump straight into super and hypercars without getting a good feel for hot hatches. Once you start getting a feel for the game, find vehicle types that suit your driving style. You like kick the back end out and rely on power to get you through a turn, then a car with alot of acceleration and a good balance between drift and handling is for you. Like gripping and flying through mid corner and are willing to sacrifice stability on the exit, a mid engine rear wheel drive car would be best. Also learn throttle control. The gas is not an on and off switch, you can finesse it to accelerate without spinning the wheels, learn to control the throttle when exiting corners and everything else will start to fall out of place. Throttle control is easily the hardest thing to learn for most people due to there being little traction control."

Conversely to you, I have mostly walked or cycled in the countryside when I lived there - that was how I got about, so for me I always saw those things and when I got DC at launch, it was just superb to see that level of detail reflected in a game.  It truly is amazing to have that amount of lighting reality and weather effects going on about you that the early bugs didn't bother me in the slightest. On GTPlanet we have a thread dedicated to the scenery and details that can be found in the game and that includes lighting and weather effects.

And living not too far from the Canadian Rockies myself, it kinda gave me the chills of how realistic it is... the artists in the game really nailed the nuances of real life. (and don't even get me started on the sun-shower effect. Wow. Just stunning.)"

But here is my truly honest opinion for you :  When I bought the game at launch, I was so frustrated that I paid so much money for the game and I didnt touch it for 4 months  Now I play it twice a week and went to level 55 in a month, so addicting and the gameplay is so much better. Get the season pass with it its a must trust me.   So yes DriveClub is one of the best racing game right now and I didnt even talk how sexy the game is, cant even describe it :)"
Driveclub,3a7uwh,TheSabrykovsky,4,Thu Jun 18 02:17:39 2015 UTC,Is there a way to get it digital. That's the deal breaker for me.
Driveclub,3a7uwh,CrazyRUSSIAN242,2,Thu Jun 18 03:40:57 2015 UTC,"$24.99 if you're a plus member, I think."
Driveclub,3a7uwh,CrazyRUSSIAN242,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:06:27 2015 UTC,I honestly don't think that the price on it will drop because it already is such a great deal. And I would say get it as soon as possible if you're playing the driveclub tour so that you could get the hang of all the dlc cars.
Driveclub,3a7uwh,MeanElf,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:15:19 2015 UTC,"True, current price drop in the US. That's a steal alright and like TheSabrykovsky suggestes, the season pass extends the game massively for the same price again. That is only available as a digital download btw."
Driveclub,3a7uwh,andysom25,1 point,Thu Jun 18 16:21:23 2015 UTC,Yes.
Driveclub,3a7uwh,BiancoBlu,2,Fri Jun 19 03:36:40 2015 UTC,"Got it two days ago during sales on the PS store. Game plus season pass costs less than most new games out there. Coming from games like GT6 and rfactor I think DC's handling is one of the most balanced between an arcade feel and sim. Plus there are constant updates of new cars, which gt 6 doesn't offer. Overall I say it's def worth buying the whole package if it's on sales"
Driveclub,3a7uwh,MeanElf,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:58:07 2015 UTC,"True, but the season pass only goes until next month, with no confirmation of a second season pass yet. however, with ten months of backlog content to play, the OP will have more than enough to keep going until the second season pass kicks in."

Driveclub,3a7uwh,PixelSmack,2,Thu Jun 18 18:47:20 2015 UTC,"Driveclub + the season pass is one of the best games on the PS4 right now. It's improved immeasurably since launch and is a game I keep coming back to a couple of times every week. The fact it's an arcade racer means it's very pick up and play and you can just do a couple of TTs or a quick race or whatever.  Honestly ignore any old review about this game if you're sat on the fence, the DLC and other improvements have made this game really really good."
Driveclub,3a7uwh,ShinFuYux,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:42:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's a great arcade/sim racer. You'll find yourself intrigued by its unique visual and handling.  Yes, buy it digital. It's cheap on psn atm."
Driveclub,3a7uwh,Wesley32,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:47:41 2015 UTC,it's good. Has some of the best after-launch support i've ever seen.   solid arcade-sim style racing. Worth every penny of the price now days. Plus the season pass has a lot of content.

They should have gone full Japanese with maybe an LFA and a GT 86 to stay in recent cars as the game doesn't really have many old cars.

Driveclub,3a5xj1,Tooty119,3,Wed Jun 17 14:45:34 2015 UTC,The difficulty is mostly not very hard. Most events are easily beatable with the exception of a handful which require a bit more skill. But there's none of them that are too hard.
Driveclub,3a5xj1,alex_dlc,2,Wed Jun 17 16:33:22 2015 UTC,Just keep going as you are for now. I hit a bit of a snag around the same time and tried and tried. I've now got every star on the DLCs and 7 off the main tour so it is possible to get better and better

Actually the reason why I'm asking this question is because the season pass is on sale right now in my country... I'm afraid if I buy it now I might still give up on the game cause of the difficulty and it would be a waste...
Driveclub,3a5xj1,coopahhhh,2,Thu Jun 18 16:01:22 2015 UTC,"I have but only a few and never really got stuck into many of them. If its on sale and at a price you don't mind wasting if you don't like it, I'd say go for it. There's some really fun events and some that frustrated me to no end. For what the pass itself is worth its a bargain compared to individually paying for each pack"
Driveclub,3a5xj1,ShinFuYux,2,Thu Jun 18 17:06:35 2015 UTC,They range from mid to hard.   Sometimes you just gotta play dirty to beat the races.

I know those aren't the best cars in the game (although the LaFerrari can compete with some of them IMO), but they're my absolute favourites and I love every single event driving them."

I use PS4Share (until I can afford proper game capture). But I'll tell you my current workflow.  I usually either drive with no HUD in a race (can switch it off with right d-pad) or save the replay by recording it and turning it off there. After that, I save it to a USB and throw it on my Mac to edit and color grade with final cut pro x. I'm still building my brand, but have a short intro maybe, and kind of have an idea of what kind of video you want to make. I hope that I helped in some way!  There is a setting in the main options menu that let's you turn off names of racers and other things too.  Editor: I got mixed up, I don't use the shareplay app, I just go to the capture galley and export to USB so there will be no title intro other than the ones I create for fcp."

Driveclub,39d3h0,TweetPoster,1 point,Wed Jun 10 23:23:08 2015 UTC,Bought the game on psn store two weeks ago ( the ps+ edition' it was called). So what is this all about?
Driveclub,39d3h0,Maximee9,1 point,Sat Jun 13 09:55:16 2015 UTC,"the version you paid for is a slightly discounted version of the full game, only available to ps+ members.  the version thats going to get released is a very stripped down version of the game. but for free. and then from there people could upgrade to the version you paid for if they so choose"
Driveclub,39d3h0,pr0adam,0,Wed Jun 17 16:24:18 2015 UTC,......YeahOk

Driveclub,398rkm,TheSabrykovsky,2,Wed Jun 10 01:59:35 2015 UTC,"just like real life, i have no idea how to drive manual"
Driveclub,398rkm,grandpa_h,8,Wed Jun 10 04:31:43 2015 UTC,Its really not. Technology has come to the point where an automatic can shift better than anyone. Just feels that its not.
Driveclub,398rkm,nbstrong,2,Wed Jun 10 04:45:37 2015 UTC,"Somewhat true.  Automatics have faster gear selection, but are not as smart with gear selection (at all)."
Driveclub,398rkm,hiefs4eva,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:06:21 2015 UTC,"In real life, autos in premium cars are on most occasions faster. In video games, or at least Driveclub, a manual can be faster, simply because the game completely disregards the lag created by human reactions when it comes to pressing and depressing a clutch. So in practice the manual option in Driveclub is no different than a flappy paddle gearbox, meaning that a person that knows a track really well can time his downshifts, so that he achieves higher rpms in the lower gear. The F50 for example, if you notice has virtually no lag between shifts, despite the fact that in real life the shifting would be slower because of the time it takes to press the clutch, put the shifter in a gear and depress the clutch. Obviously you can do that proper fast in real life, but as someone else has stated, double clutch boxes are faster."
Driveclub,398rkm,moustickz,0,Wed Jun 10 12:49:39 2015 UTC,"Trust me ive seen GT3 racers clutching, its faster than you think. yes of course if someone have a F50 manual in real life, I dont think he will shift faster than driveclub one. But in pro races they shift very fast since their clutch system is very performant. I would say it takes 0.2 sec to shift up"
Driveclub,398rkm,CrazyRUSSIAN242,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:06:09 2015 UTC,Gt3 cars have sequential transmissions which are essentially automatic.
Driveclub,398rkm,Acesofbelkan,0,Fri Jun 19 00:34:45 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you're saying, but if you're saying that an automatic would be faster than a manual its not.  All things being equal between 2 cars including the driver, with the exception that one car is automatic and one is manual, the experienced manual driver will be faster than the automatic. Reason being in the added weight a transmission adds, as well as engine power being lost because of the torque converter. Then comes the extra issue of ""more parts means more stuff that can break"". Also, a manual would be better off the line since a driver can start off the line with RPMs where the engine delivers its peak power. Where as a automatic, you start off basically at whatever RPMs the car idles at.  In the context of the game though, I'd say a manual would give you better control of the car allowing you to match the gear to whatever turn your taking or breaking by dropping a gear or two in order to drop speed quickly."
Driveclub,398rkm,audiwark,3,Wed Jun 10 05:44:49 2015 UTC,Except in the case of dual clutch autos with launch control. Faster than a professional in the same car manual.
Driveclub,398rkm,Acesofbelkan,1 point,Wed Jun 10 05:55:18 2015 UTC,"Dual clutches are mechanically manual gearboxes with a CPU controlling the depression of the clutch and moving the gears. I wouldn't label dual clutches as strictly an automatic transmission. Its more of a hybrid.  Also, you can't make up for an automatics weakness by adding in another feature. That takes away from ""all things being equal"". Launch control being what I'm reffering to."
Driveclub,398rkm,audiwark,3,Wed Jun 10 06:55:46 2015 UTC,"Semantics. A dual clutch automatic gear box shifts for the driver, so for all intents and purposes it can be called an auto (even if it isn't a traditional setup). The person you replied to said technology has advanced to the point an auto can shift better than a person, which is true when you consider dual clutch autos. If you think including launch control (which comes from factory on some cars) is unfair to the manual to keep things ""equal"" then the manual would have to start from idle as well.   Here is a video showing two identical cars, being launched at the same RPM, one manual, and the other with with dual clutch auto both with professional drivers. Guess which is faster?"
Driveclub,398rkm,grandpa_h,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:06:53 2015 UTC,This is a really interesting debate and I really appreciate the info!  Wish there was a drag strip in DriveClub to test this stuff out!
Driveclub,398rkm,Lollerscooter,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:04:03 2015 UTC,"They use launch control. They even say so just after the first race. But yeah, dsg type boxes are fast. Is it faster on a full lap, trading of shift speed against full rev control in corners? I don't know, I've seen tests go both ways.  Driveclub, like most racing games, do not diffentiate between auto and manual. You will find a mix of auto and manual racers in the top of the leaderboards."
Driveclub,398rkm,InsaneBirch,0,Sat Jun 13 19:29:59 2015 UTC,"You mean probably paddle shifting (semi-automatic), because there is no way an automatic car (cant control shifting at all) would beat any same car that is manual or paddle shift. Why? because by changing gears when you actually want, make you have more control with your car and many other advantages (Rain, start, throttle control etc...). In a straight line maybe the automatic will win, but not in a real race.  sorry for my new english"
Driveclub,398rkm,InsaneBirch,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:59:29 2015 UTC,It's preference but manual is not quicker than automatic on Driveclub. I race automatic and can beat manual drivers to top spots on the leaderboards.  Glad you've found your way.
Driveclub,395l9k,FINDTHESUN,2,Tue Jun 9 12:30:32 2015 UTC,"I kind of stopped playing for a few months now. Sad to see that ramming is still an issue. My guess is that if the devs really saw that as an issue, they would have fixed it by now."
Driveclub,395l9k,DR1V3R177,2,Thu Jun 11 00:18:00 2015 UTC,I think what might work better than punishing rammers would e to introduce a mode that rewards ramming. Something like a survival/derby mode where everyone has car health or something. I think this would be more fun for everyone involved.
Driveclub,395l9k,Stanshant,3,Tue Jun 9 16:10:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think people ram because they're being deprived of destruction derby mode, though. It's more straightforward isn't it? You stand a better chance of coming out of a corner ahead if you just ram into the drivers turning in front of you. I think collision penalties could be doubled in length, frankly. It would get the message across if the advantage were immediately nullified."
Driveclub,395l9k,DR1V3R177,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:09:33 2015 UTC,"Hard to say though, I've always taken rammers as people that just want smack fancy cars together."
Driveclub,395l9k,devilspawn6x,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:28:32 2015 UTC,"hm, it seems we all see them differently. my assumption is they ram due to lack of experience - hard to control the car, know where to brake, choose good lines etc"
Driveclub,395l9k,DR1V3R177,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:25:38 2015 UTC,I see them as pieces of shit. Exluding the ones you mentiined which is easy to notice. But if I give you room to pass and you go reno 911 on me then fucka youuu. But I agree the penalty time should be increased to the point that said rammer loses a position.
Driveclub,395l9k,Comaburr,0,Tue Jun 9 22:11:32 2015 UTC,"I would argue that on PCars which is realistic, Driveclub though? Driveclub is easier than 90% of racing games though."
Driveclub,390ppl,FINDTHESUN,5,Mon Jun 8 11:58:18 2015 UTC,The reason you get corner penalty is because all your wheels are out only two can be out even in real racing real life you cannot have all for wheel out of a solid line
Driveclub,390ppl,verse187,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:35:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks, yea that's right. I've noticed that Evo adjusts some penalties on certain tracks where you can simply go onto the grass now, but couldn't before. So I thought I'd suggest switching this one up a bit too, because it's the last one to be fixed! :)"
Driveclub,390ppl,ArsenalKid1990,3,Mon Jun 8 23:20:59 2015 UTC,Ah the good ol' Corner of Death as i call it. Go too far in:   Corner Penalty   Go just a little bit wide   You hit the barrier just after the wall and spin.   There's no way of escaping unless you brake for a solid second or two even!

Driveclub,38ylgo,Hiimbeeb,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:42:22 2015 UTC,Ive heard the season pass is one of the best.

Driveclub,38syu7,ryannevill,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:24:58 2015 UTC,"I don't think it actually downloads the full 10gb+ update. I think it just cycles through it, checking against what's already been updated. It still might take some time to do the check though.

On the leaderboards though, you can look through your records for each car you have established a record for.  Ghosts are available, yours and the lead time for that track in the car you have chosen and under the conditions you have set weather wise - not sure about time of day.  You get a rolling selection of other players' ghosts, one at a time if you run multiple circuits; once you beat a ghost, it gets replaced with another that is just within your grasp. Your own ghost will also be visible."
Driveclub,38s2y0,MeanElf,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:15:18 2015 UTC,Thanks. I am currently playing around with Project Cars and it is a big let down in this regard. Might have to take a look at Drive club too.

If you are still unsure, I believe that the heavily delayed PS+ free version might be out within a month or so, which would give you an idea if you liked it enough to get the full game.  Otherwise, it's quite cheap presently."

The fact that you were third place in that race, was more due to the fact that you started further back in the pack and the two players ahead of you likely had a cleaner run. Did you watch the replay from their perspective too? That usually helps."

Driveclub,387vq7,maralieus,6,Tue Jun 2 15:18:54 2015 UTC,Learn to use the gas intermittently.  Or sparingly.  Don't need to go full on out if every corner. Roll on the gas coming out of the corner then hit it hard when your traction catches and you are straightened out.  That's all I got. Also choose cars with low drift stats.  Try out the Bentley's they are nice.
Driveclub,387vq7,b4rks,3,Tue Jun 2 16:42:35 2015 UTC,Had the same experience chap. It only gets worse.  Some of the time-trials took me a crap tonne of attempts to get.  It's a good sense of achievement once you smash it though.
Driveclub,387vq7,Cyraxus73,2,Tue Jun 2 14:09:08 2015 UTC,"Ugh, yea I just gave up on it last night. It just didn't seem worth my time as it just seems 'broken'. I traded for the game on /r/gameswap, so I'm not really out any $$$.  Bloodborne has a much better sense of achievement since it doesn't feel like you're trying to beat faulty game mechanics ;)"
Driveclub,387vq7,Comaburr,3,Tue Jun 2 14:13:26 2015 UTC,"You have to learn how to drive fast before you can race. Driveclub is a simcade, meaning it's got elements of an arcade driving experience, but it also has a pretty realistic level of grip and drifting is NOT faster. Driveclub is built around physics that are meant to take some learning. Practice makes perfect. Look around this subreddit for tips and tricks on how to drive fast, and attempt to apply them to driving.  Part of the problem with Driveclub is that many people come in expecting a casual racer. This isn't a casual racer. This isn't the hardest racing games get, that award goes to the real PC sims like IRacing and Rfactor2, but Driveclub is a racing game for people who love cars and love to drive them, and have (some) experience with realistic racing games. If you don't like the handling and can't take the time to get used to it, this game is not for you."
Driveclub,387vq7,devilspawn6x,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:57:27 2015 UTC,"I just figured that it would at least compare to Gran Turismo if it was going to try to be realistic.....but the cars just seems as if they weigh 50% of what they should (in terms of physics)  Also, what seems to be the preferred camera angle for people ?  Is there a general consensus, or just player preference ?"
Driveclub,387vq7,Potchi79,2,Tue Jun 2 18:07:47 2015 UTC,"I like the farthest out camera because it allows me the best angle to see what's happening ahead of me and what's happening around me.  Watch any skilled player's replay and you'll see that you just have to learn to keep control of the car going into corners.  Hot Hatch racing lets you keep the throttle down almost the whole time, but once you get into the more powerful cars, you have to be mindful of how fast you're going into corners, when you're braking, how hard you're braking, and how fast you're hammering down on the throttle again coming out of the turn. It takes some getting use to, but it's certainly not a grind.  You just need to break the habit you're in because the driving style that leads to losing control is not the style you need to use in order to get through this game."
Driveclub,387vq7,Cyraxus73,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:30:45 2015 UTC,"As far as being mindful of speed when going into corners..... You just reminded me that GT had that flashing warning light of basically what gear you should be in, so you knew how much you had to slow down/brakr.  Maybe that's contributing to my problems.... I need some more hand holding :(   I'll give it another shot with a clear head tonight. Thx"
Driveclub,387vq7,MeanElf,1 point,Tue Jun 2 18:41:43 2015 UTC,No hand holding in driveclub. I say you should jump into multiplayer. Get beat up until you get the hang of it. I only play multiplayer simply bc playing tour is boring ti me. I need live players so that I have a challenge.
Driveclub,387vq7,LegendaryLuke,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:10:25 2015 UTC,I had to unlearn a lot of breaking techniques I had from GT.
Driveclub,387vq7,LegendaryLuke,2,Thu Jun 11 19:37:31 2015 UTC,"I'm really surprised you say that. One of my largest complaints about Gran Turismo is the light, floaty handling and the unrealistically quick changes of direction. Driveclub has heavier steering with more understeer and a general lack of grip in comparison. Where in GT you could play the game with the buttons, Driveclub requires you to feather the throttle and be mindful of your racing lines and such. Where driveclub's handling goes a bit funny is what happens once you do indeed start to slide, as it then doesn't quite feel right."
Driveclub,387vq7,FokJulleNaaiers,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:39:31 2015 UTC,"As you have already got rid of the game, then there isn't much point me going into a full tip list. After the Amateur trophy level, it does get briefly harder for the Sports and performance class cars. Grip and stability on the higher classes get better again though and the AI tone down their aggressive behaviour.  The AI do slow down near the end of most races (at least up to pro-am level) which allows you to catch them, but really, 'one small mistake' is not what must have been happening as you'd need to totally wipeout and get spun around for them to leave you behind like that - not trying to be condescending there, just going by my own various experiences with DC.  It was also never going to be as realistic as GT - something that was advertised in advance of the release several times, so maybe your expectations weren't in line with what the game was aiming to deliver, and that might have had an effect on how you approached it. In essence, it's a fun game."
Driveclub,387vq7,Stanshant,3,Fri Jun 5 08:23:33 2015 UTC,"It is a difficult learning curve for sure,  but eventually you will get the hang of it, the Tour mode is the most difficult to work your way through,  but once you have understood the way it's meant to be played, which ok is (trial and error at times like most games) you will enjoy it more, and I'm speaking from experience http://imgur.com/a/JopCu"

Driveclub,387vq7,Potchi79,2,Tue Jun 2 20:57:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks man,  few tips you can try is in races try a few cars,  if the track has more straight roads than corners  choose a car with the highest top speed,  if there are a lot of corners pick a car with good handling and if possible quick acceleration so you can exit the corners quick gain the speed you lost from braking. On time trails watch the ghost cars, almost imitate there actions you will see somewhere on the track the fastest ghost car will make a slight mistake allowing you to be in front and beat the time, hope this helps you a little."
Driveclub,387vq7,Significant__Otter,2,Tue Jun 2 21:42:04 2015 UTC,"The AI does drive flawlessly (regardless of weather conditions) and most of the time-trials are damn near impossible. Welcome to driveclub! That said, I still enjoy getting behind the wheel of these cars on the open road."

I'm not a top tier racer by any means, but the dualshock 4 has so many assists and such direct control that it is quantifiably easier to do well with. That being said, the wheel is SO MUCH more fun. It requires a whole hell of a lot more effort to learn and do well with (kind of like driving a real car) and the times you earn feel more satisfying. That's how I feel at least, your mileage may vary. :)"

It's a nice novelty but wouldn't recommend it for serious races.    I've been debating getting a wheel but I'm not really a hardcore racing gamer and not sure if it'd be worth it for me.
Driveclub,384d3o,TechWookiee,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:14:15 2015 UTC,You don't need a wheel to be the top 1 in Driveclub. Most of the top folks on leaderboards use DS4

I actually bought a wheel for project cars last month and tried it with driveclub. It was shit. Went back to the DS4 straight away. Wheels are for sims only.
Driveclub,384d3o,ktfright,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:53:47 2015 UTC,DS4. I can't afford a wheel.
Driveclub,384d3o,cicohipe,0,Wed Jun 3 09:19:50 2015 UTC,"In a simulator you would definitely want to be using a wheel, but for a game like Drive Club it really is designed to be used with the DS4 and works very well with it, I've set several world records with it."
Driveclub,383fij,Shinka_Nibutani,3,Mon Jun 1 16:02:38 2015 UTC,"Let the discussion begin! I like the new layout for challenges, but I have 2 major complaints about it: first, you cannot see at a quick glance which place you achieved after completing a challenge. What is even worse: when I do time trials (I hope that's what they are called in English), I always checked via the options button which place I am in right now (to see if I was already fast enough for my standards ;) ), doesn't work either. And the other thing: you can't see anymore (at least in the overview) how many people participated. That might seem uninteresting to some, but I always strive to be at least in the best 50%."

Driveclub,37ia9l,ZZ9ZA,6,Thu May 28 00:33:37 2015 UTC,"but that's not the problem. The problem is that's it's good in the corners but slow in a straight line. Read? The biggest issue with the car is that, much like the slow-speed handling cars, it has absolutely no acceleration, but it doesn't have the cornering either to make up for it. It sits in an awkward state where it is simply unbalanced to the rest of the cars in the game."
Driveclub,37ia9l,ZZ9ZA,2,Thu May 28 01:54:16 2015 UTC,"Quarter Mile Times...  Lamborghini Diablo 13.3  Ariel Atom 500 <10.8 (Can't find a time for the 500....the 360hp does it 10.8)  McLaren MP4-12c 10.8  Caterham SP300 - Couldn't find a time, but the 2.7 sec 0-60 is inline with the Ariel and Mclaren, so 1/4 is likely no more than 11.5, at worst.  So....sounds like the Diablo SHOULD be behind by about 3 seconds"
Driveclub,37ia9l,Lollerscooter,2,Thu May 28 02:25:12 2015 UTC,"No you're getting it all wrong. OP is right. The cars handles nice, but is slow on the straights - in the real world it is the other way around.   It is cool that you found quarter mile times, but they are hardly relevant. Maybe if there was info on 100kmh-200kmh, that would make more sense. Quarter mile times are too skewed by launch control and other electronic aids that have no bearing on a road race."
Driveclub,37ia9l,sgtsolo,2,Thu May 28 04:13:39 2015 UTC,"I just wish, for the GAME'S sake, that they balanced out the car a bit. They could have chosen the Diablo GT or VT 6.0, or multiple of the other late-life renditions that had slightly more power. It's a good car, but it should be just a little bit faster, really."
Driveclub,37ia9l,bbbigadrad,1 point,Thu May 28 14:57:04 2015 UTC,Just because the car accelerates slow doesn't mean you can't win with it.  The Twin'Run easily beats every car in it's class.  You just have to drive the car to its strengths.  Figure out what the Diablo's strengths are and exploit them!  It'll make the victories that much better :)  That's part of the fun!

First things first though: the old-fashioned way to translate the 24hr clock might help you.  00:00 to 12:00 Midnight to midday is exactly what you are used to (8am is 08:00; 9.30 is 09:30 and so on) After midday, just add twelve to the pm time - so 1pm becomes 13:00; 8pm becomes 20:00.  The whole ante-meridian post-meridian thing was the norm for a very long time, the 24hr clock came about presumably with the military and any other organisations who operate for every hour of the day. It got adopted by airlines and train companies etc., who crossed boundaries and time zones as a way of simplifying things.  I'm guessing you'll probably disagree that it simplifies things, but once you get the hang of it, the 24hr clock is by far the better option - there is no room for misinterpretation."

Driveclub,37cxxz,sater2812,1 point,Thu May 28 06:01:34 2015 UTC,What if I am doing game-sharing stuff with my friend (he activates my account as primary on his PS4 while I set his account as primary on my PS4)? Will I have any problems using the season pass if that's the case?

Driveclub,37ekz6,imgurtranscriber,1 point,Wed May 27 01:36:44 2015 UTC,lol. yeah there were none Lamborghini events today in Multiplayer.  But I had some good fun with RUF and M5 instead! :)
Driveclub,37ekz6,FINDTHESUN,1 point,Wed May 27 22:27:03 2015 UTC,I know that the events are randomly generated but I don't feel like it would hurt them to self promote their own DLC on the day it was released. I played for about a half hour today and saw not a single event where I could use a new Lambo.

This is an extremely close finish, clean race, and features some respectful driving.    Races like this are hard to come by in DRIVECLUB, so I had to feature it!  This shows the potential the game has if everyone drives their best.  Give SSkibo420 some recognition, this was awesome.  Needless to say, I had a blast racing, staying calm, and pushing myself to the limit.  I was holding my breath the entire final straight as the finish comes down to the wire!  Hope you enjoy!

Driveclub,377ou8,toonKev,7,Mon May 25 15:41:47 2015 UTC,"Worth it and yes.  Unless you can see yourself going to project cars, however project cars is a completely different driving game.  I'd get the dlc 200% if you are enjoying drive club at all.  Evolution is still releasing stuff and if they ever release the plus edition the community is going to get a big bump."

Driveclub,377ou8,Rorbotron,4,Mon May 25 18:09:26 2015 UTC,It's probably the best season pass I've ever purchased.  They've been pumping out the content and keeping the game fresh.
Driveclub,377ou8,petedee,1 point,Mon May 25 19:17:39 2015 UTC,So much so that I haven't really had time to play them all...  I can see it being the only driving game that I buy until GT7 comes out
Driveclub,377ou8,Rorbotron,1 point,Mon May 25 23:36:13 2015 UTC,I'm 100% in the same boat.  I haven't played a good number of them as I stick to time trials a lot and community challenges.  I'm 100% going to pick up project cars.  Its everything GT should have been minus the massive car list.  I've only played it at a friends place.  If you don't have it I'd buy that before waiting for gt7.
Driveclub,377ou8,petedee,1 point,Tue May 26 00:12:28 2015 UTC,"Project Cars sounds great and if there was a lack of stuff to play I would be picking it up.   ""Unfortunately"" I've got the Witcher 3, Wolfenstein and a huge backlog of PS+ games to get through and I never really like ploughing through driving games since they can get awfully repetitive.  Suffice to say, DriveClub with the season pass has enough content to keep me going for probably another year or so :)"
Driveclub,377ou8,MeanElf,3,Tue May 26 06:13:38 2015 UTC,"Very worth it. You played the first two and there are another two tours per month since then, plus all of the cars...and even some more liveries."

I didn't look at the accolades list by mistake until I was nearly done.

Driveclub,36vf5b,KniteMonkey,1 point,Mon May 25 00:48:53 2015 UTC,"When you sent them to your other profile, did you complete the challenge with that other profile?

Sure, there hasn't been one single Japanese car in there but they've pretty much said they will be by refusing to deny or confirm that they'll come to the game.  With all of the manufacturers in the world and such a list from classics up to modern cars, no one single game could ever hope to have them all. Don't forget that they have managed to put more new and interesting cars into the game than even Gran Turismo has (I'm excluding the Vision GT cars as those don't really exist.) So where is the lack of diversity there?  I'm suspecting you are wanting Japanese and American cars though? Still ten more cars to go for this season pass."

Driveclub,36ityy,byondred3mption,2,Tue May 19 18:30:13 2015 UTC,"People, no matter how you achieve 60 fps in a video. If the source material, in this case the game, does not feature 60 fps, the video in the end won't either.  Also: that guy is annoying as hell.  Also also: I'd like to say again that I hate the fact, that the G27 isn't supported."
Driveclub,36ityy,MeisterEder,1 point,Wed May 20 17:31:22 2015 UTC,"Are you saying I am annoying? I understand what you are saying about the source content being 30 FPS and all but when I do my editing and what not, I render everything to 60 FPS whether the source footage is 30 FPS or not."
Driveclub,36ityy,MeisterEder,6,Thu May 21 16:22:05 2015 UTC,"Still the actual content of your video is not 60 fps, thus the title is misleading, you might even say wrong. On top: because you rendered everything in 60, the video does have a higher bitrate than it should have. Experiencing the content, whether you are in 60 in the corner or in 30, would be the same with a 30 source. But the bitrate would be lower with 30, so it loads faster.  The annoying part: yes, I find you very annoying this video, but I find nearly all commented gameplay videos to be annoying. Still, without wanting to insult you, this annoyed the hell out of me and I relatively quickly turned it off. There wasn't any substance in your comments, I think that's my main quarrel."
Driveclub,36ityy,MeisterEder,1 point,Thu May 21 16:35:25 2015 UTC,"Well I am sorry I annoyed but to put it simply, no need to be rude towards other people. You dont like my content or commented gaming content then dont watch it."
Driveclub,36ityy,AlteredEG0,1 point,Thu May 21 17:57:15 2015 UTC,"Again, don't want to insult you. This is pure critizism of your video, not you as a person, who I don't know personally.  People always say ""then don't watch it!"", but that's a bit tricky here on Reddit, as you might imagine. You post a video with an interesting title in a sub I'm subscribed to, so I begin to watch it. Then, if I don't like it, I turn it off and go away. If it annoyed me, I might leave a comment. The content I'm presented with is already filtered after my preferences, so there's no way around it.  Cheers"

Driveclub,36g8st,ALSAY3D,2,Tue May 19 04:20:57 2015 UTC,"How did you redeem the season pass if its not matching your store region? Anyways, you can create a second primary account on your ps4 with the same region as your disc, then download everything from that store. That's how I got it to work when I had your problem."
Driveclub,36g8st,MeanElf,1 point,Tue May 19 05:03:08 2015 UTC,This generally works according to previous solutions I've read.
Driveclub,36g8st,ALSAY3D,1 point,Tue May 19 07:09:27 2015 UTC,"My main account is a US account so I can download and install the season pass, however the problem here is that my disc - a EU version one - doesn't seem to recognize the season pass that I purchased.  Regarding your solution, there are a few questions that I would like to ask. As I am currently setting my friend's account as the primary account (we are sharing digital games with each other), is it possible for me to create another EU account and make it primary? What about the season pass that I purchased using my US account, can I transfer those to my EU account?"
Driveclub,36g8st,ALSAY3D,1 point,Tue May 19 07:28:05 2015 UTC,"I got 3 primary accounts on my ps4, so yes you can create another one. Unfortunately, you either have to get a new season pass on your EU account or get a used US disc (ebay?)"
Driveclub,36g8st,Troll_berry_pie,1 point,Tue May 19 09:26:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think that's the only solution for now, I guess I will have to find a new US disc after returning my EU disc. Thanks a lot for your help mate :)"

I have also contacted Sony Support and they also said that they could help me to refund (for the season pass purchase) as long as I provided them with the CUSA Number of my game disc and other pieces of information. I will try to contact them again as long as I got home.  I guess it's my lucky day xD"
Driveclub,36g8st,arshaqV,2,Tue May 19 07:33:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, you have something like 30 days to return items bought via the Internet according to EU law. This is due to not being able to physically inspect the item."

Driveclub,36f31c,Novast,4,Mon May 18 22:02:38 2015 UTC,"No, driving lines are almost like cheating, like if the game was holding your hand. They tell you what to do and in my opinion, take the all the fun away from driving. I always turn them off in any driving game that has them.   You dont need to memorise the tracks, just glance at the minimap to see what the next turn is like and try to adapt while driving. The colored flags are really clearly visible, and they can really help. This game might still be fun for casual players, but I think it was designed for people that are more serious about driving games."
Driveclub,36f31c,alex_dlc,2,Mon May 18 23:51:15 2015 UTC,"No, there is currently no way to turn on any more driving assists. Use the colored flags when the turns have them. If they don't have them you can use the mini map. In fact you should always be using the mini map to know your next 2 turns up ahead."
Driveclub,36f31c,Sgt_ZigZag,3,Mon May 18 23:06:57 2015 UTC,Almost essential in blizzard conditions too.  I think I spend probably 50% of the race looking at the map.
Driveclub,36f31c,cicohipe,0,Tue May 19 04:12:25 2015 UTC,Thats too much. That 50 could be used for the track.
Driveclub,36f31c,devilspawn6x,2,Tue May 19 17:43:20 2015 UTC,"It was a bit of an exaggeration, but seriously in some of the worst sections in those conditions you may as well be looking at the map, because you can't see the track."
Driveclub,36f31c,cicohipe,0,Tue May 19 21:15:50 2015 UTC,In that situation I just watch the white lines on the road. They catch the headlights pretty good.
Driveclub,36f31c,devilspawn6x,2,Tue May 19 21:19:24 2015 UTC,"Slower and easier corners that's fine.  If you're going flat approaching a tight turn though, by the time you see that turn in the road it's already too late."
Driveclub,36f31c,cicohipe,-1,Tue May 19 21:24:11 2015 UTC,Nah. Really not that hard
Driveclub,36f31c,devilspawn6x,1 point,Tue May 19 22:18:57 2015 UTC,"There's no ""best racing line"" for Drive club. I grew accustomed to that too. But you really don't need it. The colored flags at turns helps a lot. As well as the mini-map."
Driveclub,36f31c,Acesofbelkan,1 point,Tue May 19 02:29:32 2015 UTC,How do the colored flags work?
Driveclub,36f31c,Acesofbelkan,2,Tue May 19 02:41:05 2015 UTC,Red = very tight turn. Yellow = hard to medium turn Green = smooth turn
Driveclub,36f31c,cicohipe,2,Tue May 19 02:49:51 2015 UTC,"This isn't always accurate though, as if the course is in reverse they don't change the flags.  Basically you can only trust the flags if you're doing a standard layout."
Driveclub,36f31c,Acesofbelkan,1 point,Tue May 19 04:19:32 2015 UTC,"This is true, I ended up in the grass a couple times because of this. Using the flags in conjunction with the mini-map is best. But anyone will naturally learn courses by just playing and having fun, OP."
Driveclub,36f31c,sunsetoverdriver,1 point,Tue May 19 04:36:58 2015 UTC,I'm ashamed to say I never realised about the coloured flags until I saw this post! Thanks for the heads up. I'm already seeing the benefit of using them as a guide
Driveclub,36f31c,cicohipe,1 point,Thu May 21 05:43:39 2015 UTC,"Even Mario Kart has a ""best racing line"", there's always going to be a quickest way through the corner.  You want to carry maximum speed while making the corner as short as possible, if there's a long straight coming up you want to consider sacrificing both of the above for greater acceleration out of the corner that will give you better gains along the straight.  Pretty universal stuff and it applies to any and all racing games."
Driveclub,36f31c,Acesofbelkan,1 point,Tue May 19 04:17:43 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand what I meant by ""theres no ""best racing line"" in driveclub"". I quoted it because OP didn't know the proper name of it. OP called it "" green tracking arrows""."

Driveclub,36f31c,devilspawn6x,1 point,Tue May 19 04:48:26 2015 UTC,watch for those white squares that line the turns. Its like a timer or countdown telling you how hard / fast you need to slow down for said turn.
Driveclub,36f31c,NachoManSandyRavage,1 point,Tue May 19 17:40:33 2015 UTC,"Every track has a best line. Sorry but youre gonna have to put in work to get good. YOu dont need to put in alot of time. Watch the colored flags and try to use scenery ques to judge your breaking distance. If you keep hitting stuff and going off track, slow down and learn the track. Fast=smooth and controlled. The way I learned quickest was at first, never fully getting on the brakes. THe most i ever used was 3/4s of brakes to learn how the cars reacted under braking and also to learn how to modulate my braking to trail brake. If you can learn to tail brake properly, you can pull yourself out of alot of mistakes."

Driveclub,36cqj8,Sgt_ZigZag,3,Mon May 18 23:04:21 2015 UTC,"I browse /r/outside so that counts right? But just generally: brake earlier than you think you should, and you can go faster out of the corners. Obviously drifting is slower, so try not to get sideways if you're going for a hot lap. If you're having trouble with a specific tour event, YouTube it. There's most likely a guide video that will say ""when you pass this tree, start braking and turn in and clip the curb"" etc. Also: I just updated my game and it shot me straight to 55!"

Driveclub,361gbq,downtothegwound,2,Sat May 16 03:56:40 2015 UTC,"I like it just for some mindless, fast, pretty fun racing. $29.99 for the lot isn't a bad deal.  The game is kinda set out like Burnout Paradise, where you enter events at traffic lights, map markers or challenge other drivers. So it's kinda open world I guess..Events include your normal races, point a to b races, hot pursuit, interceptor (just you and the cops and you have to escape in a certain time limit), time trials etc.  And you can take out other drivers like Burnout (crashes don't look as cool or mangle the cars though).  Whether you play as cops or a racer you can equip your car with emp's, shockwaves, extra turbo to use against others (and AI uses them against you to).   It's not super fantastic, but still a fun arcade racer. I like it anyway."

Driveclub,35ykk9,jracingpr,5,Thu May 14 18:57:45 2015 UTC,"It's kind of funny... what blew me away when I first booted up Driveclub back last November and got settled into the controls was something you wouldn't expect.  As a veteran of car racing games of all kinds, from Burnout to IRacing, Driveclub was shaping up to be another real classic of a game. It had amazing visuals, fast cars from around the globe, custom paintjobs (enough for me, so long as I can paint my cars red, white, and black :P), and a huge multiplayer contingent. Sure enough, when I booted up the game I wasn't disappointed. Everything was perfect and by mid-november they had worked out most of the online kinks.  What REALLY took me off my feet, however, was the track design. Wow. The use of narrow, realistic roads was my first giveaway that this game meant business, and it continued through my playing experience. Evolution expertly uses track design to enhance the feeling of their already fantastic handling model. Imagine if Skjolden didn't have those two arched bridges in the first half of the lap? Going over each one is a real struggle in the more high powered vehicles and it makes for a reality check in hypercars, especially if it's wet. Another example is on The Kyle. After the first long straight section the race cannonballs into a sharp left, a crest, then a right sweeper. This means that you have to put extra care into your line into the first part and the suspension extension going over the crest means you have no turning to correct your line. From the downhill blasts of India to the uneven and banked roads of Canada, every single nuance of every track feels like it was meant to be there, specifically placed by the devs to make the game more fun.  I love it!"
Driveclub,35ykk9,Cyraxus73,3,Fri May 15 11:07:41 2015 UTC,"Wow, you are like a Driveclub philosopher.  I never really paid much attention to the track design.  I will now.  Thanks for that write up!"

Driveclub,35ykk9,cicohipe,3,Thu May 14 17:17:37 2015 UTC,"The BAC Mono is such a good car, so well rounded and progressive when the tail does step out.  It almost always makes for close exciting races when it's a field of these and the Caterhams."
Driveclub,35ykk9,Sgt_ZigZag,1 point,Fri May 15 00:10:35 2015 UTC,I like how you think.  Those are two of my favorites as well.  I'm really into the Ferraris and Lamborghinis but haven't had enough time with them to pic a favorite.  Do you have a preferred weather or time of day?
Driveclub,35ykk9,MeanElf,2,Thu May 14 19:32:14 2015 UTC,458 Italia is my favorite Ferrari. Note that I have only the base game and have not unlocked the 599 yet.   I prefer dry conditions in the day time for the obvious reason. Easier to drive. I do enjoy playing dynamic weather races however just because I think they really show case the excellent weather effects in the game. I absolutely hate night driving due to low visibility and night driving with precipitation is simply a recipe for disaster.

Driveclub,35ykk9,FunnyMixer91,1 point,Fri May 15 00:12:56 2015 UTC,La Ferrari handles like a dream and is one of my favorites too.On the straights it gets eaten by the One:1 but once things get tight and twisty it's back in the game.It really depends on the track and ofc the skill of the drivers but it's always nice to beat the One:1 in a slower car.I have a video of me chasing down 2 battling ONE:1's on westeross here(i'm in a Hennessey)https://youtu.be/6iYzO9Wrc_M

Driveclub,35zrer,AutoDan,5,Thu May 14 21:49:15 2015 UTC,"First off, the opponents seem to be giving you the most trouble, is there any way you can drive with the rear view mirror enabled? If you can, do it, you'll find it much easier to see other cars trying to overtake you and you can at least block them.  Second, your driving is much better than I was expecting, but yeah, it's a little sloppy due to that mindset of ""go as fast and brake as late as possible"", that actually works in a lot of modern racing games, but Driveclub plays more like classic arcade drift racing games, and those games required a lot more care in how you drive.  Especially on the track in your clip, you've got to watch your speed on some of those turns, especially the first, I used to constantly go into the dirt there, and you never want to risk that. Better slow down and risk one car overtake you, than speed off into the dirt and lose the race. And as I said before, you can make sure that car doesn't overtake you by blocking them.  Third, like any racer, experiment with different cars out to find the best one for each race, top speed seems to be an issue for you in that race, since you can never quite catch up to the cars in front. If you're ever struggling, start off by figuring out what went wrong and finding the best car you have to complement it. For example, if there's lots of turns, try a car with more handling, if you have to break a lot and you can never get the momentum back, go for something with better acceleration, etc.  I used to suck at this game worse than you did, and it's just because this game is far more complicated than it looks or sounds. People assume it's just a generic racer meant as a glorified PS4 tech demo, there's actually much more to it, and once you find out, you can start to actually play it properly and improve.  Hope this helps."
Driveclub,35zrer,IamAnthonological,3,Fri May 15 00:23:30 2015 UTC,"Third, like any racer, experiment with different cars out to find the best one for each race, top speed seems to be an issue for you in that race, since you can never quite catch up to the cars in front.   Good advice on all fronts, but the choice of car for that race really looked like his main issue for me too.  Even in that last straight away the car couldn't gain any ground on the bottom of the pack."
Driveclub,35zrer,TechWookiee,1 point,Fri May 15 22:27:10 2015 UTC,"Wow thanks for taking the time with such a long response! Just on your first point about the rear view mirror, would you suggest using the in car view then? Or is it possible to have the rear view mirror viewable with the camera angle I use?  Again thanks for the response! I'll put it all in to action when I'm done with work and let you know how it goes later today."
Driveclub,35zrer,MeanElf,1 point,Fri May 15 07:25:16 2015 UTC,"You can add a rear-view mirror to any view (except in-car I think) through the settings  As IamAnthonological says, you have a good style, just need to watch the dog-chasing-the-ball focus on the first corner; take it slower and you'll come out better, regaining any places lost by the corner after.  I've also noticed that the game seems to favour overtaking on the inside more, as opposed to overtaking on the outside which Gran Turismo does. This isn't always the case though, as some almighty snarl-ups can happen around some corners, with the AI attempting just that. The corners where you are best taking the pack on the outside, you'll learn from observation.  Lastly, if you have the time, there is no 'penalty' for running the same race a few times to see how the AI respond, by that I mean there isn't an overall statistic that says you have entered so many races but only won this many.  Absolute lastly, have fun."
Driveclub,35zrer,earneck,1 point,Fri May 15 09:54:43 2015 UTC,Thanks for the answer about the mirrors and thanks for the tips. I'll return with updates soon!
Driveclub,35zrer,t-oliveira,2,Fri May 15 15:38:13 2015 UTC,"I was expecting much worse than what I saw. I agree with what the other commenters have said.   1 piece of advice I would add is to moderate your throttle and braking more. When coming out of some corners I would notice you hit the throttle too hard and then have to correct with braking or risk hitting another car or the grass. Over the course of a lap those corrections will cost a lot of time. Ease onto the gas as patiently as you can and once you know you're in the clear nail it. With practice you'll understand the limits of the cars and the track.   Another thing I noticed is your overtaking maneuvers. During the first lap you didn't make up much ground due to the cars ahead being right where you were accelerating to. Taking the conventional racing line can sometimes hinder you. Try looking for opportunities to take a wide entry into a corner, turning more sharply, and hitting a late apex to get a better exit, which would help with your straight line speed like another commenter posted.   Hope this helps. Happy to answer questions."
Driveclub,35zrer,Mutilated_Pencil,2,Fri May 15 16:16:46 2015 UTC,"The tips that I use and have worked for me personally are:  • Use a very smooth steering, hard steering will usually make you crash at high speeds or lose control, only steer when absolutely needed and do it slowly and smoothly. If you need to make a corner to the right but you steer to the left while exiting the corner, you are doing it wrong.  • Racing apex, basically means that when you corner you need to stay as much as possible inside the corner, driveclub is a game that you usually drive a less powered car so you need to beat your opponents in the corners (http://www.drivingfast.net/images/techniques/racing-line/racing-line-late-apex.png)  • Try not to crash into your opponents as much as possible, unless it means getting them out of your way, but it is tricky and involves a certain risk (penalties and crashing your car).  • Go full throttle every time you can, however, 30% of the time you can't go full throttle because you are either in a corner or exiting one, only go full throttle when you can. (see the apex, this is especially true in hypercars)  • Drifting is overrated in this game (in the non-drifting modes ofc), it makes you lose alot of speed. Try not to drift too much and especially lose direction if you do.  • Watch out for the little arrows on the corners of the screen refering of the cars trying to overtake you if you feel like you are in a weak car  And like anthological said, brake late and and full throttle when you can, this is pretty much a cross between gran turismo racing and an arcade game so these basic tips help alot I think."

Forza sounds so incredibly generic, a little bit as I have Grand Turismo in memory which sounds horrid. Though I'm always a little bit disappointed, that Evolution studios couldn't make them sound more real, albeit their tremendous efforts in recording them, I think it's the best sounding racing game to-date.  Also I'd like to mention, that I find Assetto Corsa to be better sounding than pCars, but still not as good as Driveclub.  Either way, there's still quite a big leap between Driveclub's attempt and realism in sound.  Edit: q.e.d."

Driveclub,35whyv,MeanElf,1 point,Thu May 14 04:03:08 2015 UTC,"Didn't know there was a ""free"" version. No, I paid for the game and three car packs"
Driveclub,35whyv,OneToNothing1-0,0,Thu May 14 04:08:52 2015 UTC,"It hasn't been confirmed, but probably it's to stop whingers complaining about a 'pay-to-win' model being used that doesn't allow use of DLC cars in that often. Some have been allowed in the past, usually on TTs or the one car selection races.  Also, there are some classes like performance which make more than five cars available in the selection."
Driveclub,35whyv,MeanElf,2,Thu May 14 08:21:43 2015 UTC,I'm just glad we get to use the cars we paid for. Whoever dictates the cars allowed in multiplayer each week should be shot.

Driveclub,35tuog,ArsenalKid1990,2,Mon May 18 03:37:03 2015 UTC,"They really have done a remarkable job with the game. They made their promise, and stuck to it. Even if it was a few months along the line. It was all worth it in the end but yet people still want one or two cars in the game as if it'd make a massive difference. Granted it'd make for some more competition but certainly won't change the fact that it'd be completely different lol.  I recently read that someone wanted F1 cars in the game. But then put my point across that it'd be unacceptable because their focus is mainly on Road Cars, (Whilst 3 being track cars as well.  But that has competition and is from different manufacturers.) There'd simply be no competition for an F1 car in the game if it were to be added. That and adding the Aerodynamic, Physics and Handling Models as well as licenses. It'd take too much of the £££'s or  $$$'s  Anyway i'm straying off course.  The Season Pass was worth it the whole way through. I bought it after the first Paid DLCs were released. I've loved every single one, it's a game where you can say.   It was bad. But now it's brilliant. and going on to buy the season pass really proves that point."
Driveclub,35tuog,Cardy_X,2,Wed May 13 15:12:16 2015 UTC,"I can not tell you how disappointed I was when it came out. I had expectations that it would be like Forza 3/4/5. So while I understand that much of my disappoint was caused by me, there were still a few issues with the game.  I feel bad because I talked my friend into getting the game and he played it literally one day and put it down.   I kept seeing updates for the game though and figured why not give it another chance while I wait for House of Wolves (Destiny) to come out. I have a feeling I will be playing this a lot more."

Driveclub,35phzd,Stanshant,2,Tue May 12 19:48:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think the DLC is going to peter out in the remaining couple of months. Otherwise, why produce the season pass wheel with incorrect info? Also doubt they'll release any significant DLC beyond July. The game now has a sizeable amount of content and reduced staff in support. If the free version comes out - and I know it's been recently reannounced - they don't need to offer anything more than the individual packs or a retrospective season pass. That said, I'd obviously love another set of tracks and ongoing new cars, and would happily pay for another season pass worth."

Don't treat the steering wheel like a switch either and just slam it left and right all the time. Just make small adjustments to steering and your speed. If your tires are screeching blip the brakes and get a hold of yourself because you're not going as fast as you can be. Finally, look at your mini map frequently and respect the flags."

Driveclub,35bn50,NoMethingAround,2,Fri May 8 19:33:16 2015 UTC,"Thats one thing that bugs me about DC - when trying to get a photo with lightning or an exhaust backfire in it and you are trying to set it up/time it right in the replay you aren't guaranteed the same thing happening each time.   What I mean is you can be watching a replay, see something you like (as above lightning/backfire), rewind to go to photomode and the next time it doesn't occur or show up. Rewind again still nothing, rewind further, nothing, rewind again and its a different lightning strike, rewind and change camera - nothing, rewind and its the same as before but you missed it by 1/4 of a second. Repeat about 10 times and eventually you might get the photo you originally wanted! :P  Took me a few tries to get this lightning strike and probably about 50 rewinds of the replay to get the backfire one! imgur"

Slow motion would have been a good option, but I think it'd be such a massive headache with all of the other factors going on at the same time that they probably decided they couldn't do it right."

Driveclub,35af9g,BloodySpades,12,Fri May 8 13:38:14 2015 UTC,"First you'll need some basics in Physics.  In more specific terms, you need to know how friction works  Basically you can push a car further/faster by NOT sliding, while approaching the ""peak"", but not getting over it, where you start sliding, and lose traction.  In other words, avoid sliding if at all possible. If you slide, you lose control, and speed. This is really the bare basics of driving and racing.  There's a saying, something like ""to go faster, you need to go slower"" Slower not in the sense of straight line speed, but slower in the sense of input. Don't just jam on the brakes, or the gas, whenever you need to stop/go, and don't just turn the wheel to the maximum lock when you need to turn. The smoother each movement is, the faster your car will go. Smoothness is key.  Now, the major difference between ""normal"" brake and handbrake, is that handbrakes will lock your wheels, hence, causing you to slide, which is bad. Normal braking will gradually slow you down (if you do it properly) and you will reach the peak of that friction.  Now, once you slowed down, you need to know what your car does when it turns. This simple graph somewhat illustrates it in some way. Total friction of your tires are limited, so it cannot both turn (pull sideways) AND brake (pull backwards) at their maximum at the same time. You need to balance them to put the most out of your tire friction limit, without pushing it too much that it starts sliding.  This is also the main reason why a lot of the racing lines look like this. You brake in a straight line, to use the maximum grip of you tires to slow down, then use the most of that grip to turn right after it's slowed down enough, and as you turn in, you gradually loosen up on the turn, and put that into gas, so the grip can push the car to accelerate. You're basically rotating the total force on the tire, as you go through a turn.  That is the bare basics of what a car tire goes through during a turn. There is a LOT more involved of course, depending on the drive train (front wheel drive, rear wheel drive, all wheel drive) the characteristics of the car will be different, the power output, the road surface, the slopes/angle, the weight shift of the car to each tire, and of course, the speed you're going at, will all vary the behaviour of the car as you make the turn, but you learn that the more you drive.  Basically, FWD tend to slide straight and not turn as well (understeer) and RWD the tail of the car tend to slide out more often (oversteer).   DriveClub is really a very simplified model of this driving physics, but the principle is the same.  Brake straight, before going to a turn, let go of the brake, turn in, and as you come out of the turn and straight out, gradually accelerate.  The other big part of racing, is of course, track knowledge. You need to know the best lines to take, when and how hard to brake on each corner, and prepare yourself for the following turn.   There really is a lot going on, and the best way to learn is just to practice a lot. Over and over and over."
Driveclub,35af9g,zedie,1 point,Fri May 8 14:00:27 2015 UTC,Yep. But the last part is all he needs to do. Overtime all that willmanifest in his mind on some way even if he doesnt know. But I learned a bit so thnx. Also id say he should watch some f1 or gt racing. For dc id say gt is prob better though. Just to have a real world visual.
Driveclub,35af9g,devilspawn6x,3,Sat May 9 13:21:26 2015 UTC,"Racing is somewhat counter-intuitive, in that the object is to get from A to B quickly, yet the way to do this is by slowing down a lot. The sharper the turn, the more brake you need to apply to corner it sucessfully. What people refer to as drifting is finding that apex of the right balance of speed and brake to corner without losing momentum. Drafting is when you ride in the slipstream of a car or cars in front or behind, increasing each other's aerodynamic efficiency, which is almost like saying you get a free natural nitro boost. You gotta keep that in mind when cornering."
Driveclub,35af9g,EvenMoreGooder,1 point,Fri May 8 13:46:55 2015 UTC,"The game is nothing like driving a car in real life, just for the record.

It just takes practice like most any other game, racers in particular. Just keep playing and you'll get the hang of it in no time."
Driveclub,358qff,sgtsolo,3,Fri May 8 01:18:24 2015 UTC,"Fair racing, my only gripe would be your defence towards the finish line, but I'm the kind of guy to let a someone attempt the pass at the line.  Arsenal's a quick racer so can't wait to see what he's like over on Project CARS."
Driveclub,358qff,InsaneBirch,1 point,Fri May 8 11:19:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, completely agree.  Are we all getting Project CARS for PS4?"
Driveclub,358qff,InsaneBirch,1 point,Sat May 9 14:37:02 2015 UTC,I believe most of us have. moonhowler said he's getting for PC.

My wheel comes tomorrow so hopefully won't be so twitchy! Definitely a different experience from Driveclub.  If you're on tonight, hit me up and we'll have a few races - See if we can get a few more too."
Driveclub,358qff,ArsenalKid1990,2,Sun May 10 08:41:26 2015 UTC,"Here's a shortened video of the final 2 laps after /u/ArsenalKid1990 suffered the dreaded ""Itch during a race"" and lost his 7 second lead, giving me a chance to Fight for 1st!  This was one of the best races online I've had.  He's a much better racer than I am so I had to try my best to keep up!  Pay attention to the 3rd lap where I practice my passing move for the final lap on the last corner.  Be sure to watch till the end to see if it worked or not!  Thanks for watching! - SgtSolo"
Driveclub,358qff,mrolive1,2,Fri May 8 01:18:42 2015 UTC,So did you block him before the finish? He'd draft the heck of you if you didn't! :-)
Driveclub,358lsj,PickerLeech,2,Fri May 8 00:38:10 2015 UTC,"That's the beauty of Driveclub. It incorporates almost everything you'd want from a game like this to enjoy it in a relaxed manner and find it quite challenging too. A perfect balance. As your skill grows, it gets even cooler!  The mirror thing you talked about is a mirage effect, which was part of one of the updates as well as rainbows and stuff.   Detail game going strong in this one! Welcome to Driveclub, buddy!   Also, Ferrari Barchetta??"
Driveclub,358lsj,FINDTHESUN,1 point,Fri May 8 10:55:47 2015 UTC,"A mirage - yeah I thought it might have been a heat haze kind of thing. Pretty cool.   I guess it wasn't a Barchetta then. It was a modern Ferrari, I would think a current one. I don't know what they're called. Would be great if they include some of the vintage Ferraris."
Driveclub,358lsj,FINDTHESUN,1 point,Fri May 8 11:01:28 2015 UTC,"There's a heat haze too, and both look stunning!  You probably meant F12 Berlinetta then, very fast supercar! But wait until you unlock LaFerrari! :-)"

Driveclub,358lsj,devilspawn6x,1 point,Fri May 8 11:30:42 2015 UTC,I've been trying to unlock LaFerrari and asked this in another thread. I've been driving the Scuderia an also the 434 (I believe) in time trials while drifting. I found this the easiest way to drive the cars the most while getting a ton of fame for drifting. I noticed that sometimes I'll do 20 or more laps and get no miles credited for my Ferrari owner points. Does this not count for time trials?
Driveclub,357xls,lolcop01,2,Thu May 7 21:16:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's a lot of active players and you have to play regularly to keep up.  My global rank right now is 2808 and three months ago I was in the top 300."
Driveclub,357xls,mrwynd,2,Fri May 8 13:28:34 2015 UTC,"I use my Friend's List to judge how many have the game, not ideal, I know but one of them played a couple of races and then never came back - he's currently at about one million and twenty thousandth position.  The upper section though is pretty competitive as MrWynd suggests. I think there has been a sudden upsurge in players during the past few months, as I was in the two hundreds and am now around 1800 (51 million XP) and I play pretty much daily, though only for a few hours. I am under no illusion about reaching the top levels where some players have over a billion XP.  Another friend went sailing past me on the leaderboard because he plays a fair amount of online, which can reward you well nowadays, especially with the double XP races that pop up (currently Ferrari vs Lamborghini)"
Driveclub,35511y,tenthousandlakes,3,Thu May 7 03:59:09 2015 UTC,"LFA would be cool. Some other cool ideas: Bugatti Veyron, SLR mclaren, Ford GT, Lamborghini Countash, Honda NSX,  Nissan deltawing and Lotus T125   Porsche Carrera, 911 GT2, 918 - though unlikely."
Driveclub,35511y,calonto,3,Thu May 7 05:18:26 2015 UTC,The LFA could be great if they manage to reproduce the sound properly.   I'm not such a fan of the GTR but I guess it would be a good addition to the car list. I'd like a standard zonda though it looks and sounds so good.

Driveclub,34z68u,DrSpud,4,Wed May 6 03:30:59 2015 UTC,"What if it was the other way around and got a nerf? The 458 Speciale has a faster time around the Ferrari test track, and the F12 has more power, why not nerf it a bit and throw it in the Super class?"
Driveclub,34z68u,Greeney494,2,Tue May 5 23:53:32 2015 UTC,This is a great idea!
Driveclub,34z68u,TheLastOfGus,2,Wed May 6 13:33:31 2015 UTC,The Enzo's advantage for me is in handling and more importantly braking. It loses out on top end speed but when you can corner faster and break later you can eek out a lead. Harder to do but then it's a fun car to use as it can be more of a challenge!
Driveclub,34z68u,brampower,2,Wed May 6 09:44:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, you are so right. It is way too slow and just not a feasible choice in online races which is such a shame because it is my favorite car of all time and I was looking forward to driving it. Unfortunately I never pick it because you won't win a race with it."
Driveclub,34z68u,devilspawn6x,1 point,Tue May 5 20:59:39 2015 UTC,I actually  think its good the way it is. Sweating after winning a race in the enzo is the shizzz

Venom was tough, but I never felt cheated and I eventually managed to milk 3 stars out of it.   I've thought about returning to ""Punching"" now that I've become a better driver, but then I remember that the Bentley handles like a brick with a flat tire and I say fuck it."

Driveclub,34y2bv,GingerApe1,1 point,Tue May 5 23:36:07 2015 UTC,"Be very careful on the throttle through corners. You gotta feather it and be very aware of your braking and turn in points. Then once you get out of the apex dont try to hammer it but gradually lay into the throttle.  It will take a bit but once you can get the line you will fly in that car. That one specific track will teach you a lot about that car in general. Just pay attention to what the car is doing and the angle through the corner. I like to refer to Niki Lauda in this situation because he drove with his ass! He felt what was going on. Unfortunately this isn't quite the simulator or the real deal but practice makes perfect.  Also try not to power slide and let the back end come out as you will lose tons of time. It is very easy to do but as I said, be very aware of your throttle input and you will blow that time away.  Edit: I beat the time with a Thrustmaster T80"

Driveclub,34w9ny,helderico,6,Tue May 5 02:33:38 2015 UTC,"I for one bought Driveclub because i was tired of waiting for Project Cars. I'm most likely going to buy it (waiting for a few reviews to pop up).  But with Driveclub having amazing DLCs, i think ill be back every now and then to check the new cars and tours. But wont be actively playing, pursuing lap records, playing online and etc...  :("
Driveclub,34w9ny,billythemule,3,Tue May 5 02:33:55 2015 UTC,"I'll probably play both. Driveclub is super relaxing to me and I enjoy collecting stars and working towards accolades. And let's not forget the graphics! It may only be 30 fps but dang, it's like the Crysis of racing games. I've had it for a few months and I'm still impressed by the way it looks.  There is one big flaw about Driveclub though. The PS4 doesn't support a lot of wheels. It's WAY too expensive for me to import a wheel that I want. I ended up getting the Logitech g27 for the PC."
Driveclub,34w9ny,Mutilated_Pencil,2,Tue May 5 06:56:49 2015 UTC,"nothing much really, i think project cars is WAY to overhyped/expensive to remotely get me interested in it.

Driveclub,34w9ny,HerpDerpenberg,3,Sun May 10 17:29:52 2015 UTC,"Because I'm posting against the grain in the DC sub. I like drive club, but it's an arcade racer through and through.  The tracks just look pretty. You'd never sew a track that has a bottle neck into a tunnel like they do in DC."

From your comment and FINDTHESUN's it seems people already think Evolution have withheld the PS+ version on purpose.  Me, I think that would be an absolutely disastrous business decision. Considering the folks there have done so much since launch to correct the situation, I seriously doubt that they had planned any of what you are both suggesting."
Driveclub,34w9ny,NachoManSandyRavage,1 point,Wed May 6 13:33:43 2015 UTC,Ill still play both. Project Cars was built for PC and is the main reason why i built a PC. I will still use my PS4 for Driveclub though
Driveclub,34w9ny,InsaneBirch,1 point,Tue May 5 03:59:54 2015 UTC,"I've literally this minute ordered my T300RS, along with a digital preorder from the PS Store (UK).   I'll still be jumping onto Driveclub, but I'll spend most of my time on Project CARS.  Don't get me wrong, Driveclub is an amazing game, but I feel I've burnt myself out of the games content, and private lobbies are a big deal to me.  Also I love he idea of having a big race with your friends AND a bunch of AI cars.  I'm definitely looking forward to it, but I'm totally new to this 'sim' business. It's gonna be EPIC."
Driveclub,34w9ny,Moonhowler22,1 point,Tue May 5 14:11:56 2015 UTC,"I'll probably do the same.  But it'll be on PC for me. I wonder if they could ever merge lobbies between systems since it doesn't really matter the way a shooter does with mice vs gamepad.   Driveclub is fun, but once CARS comes out I might end up dropping from the championship. I enjoy them, but even now I find it....stressful, I guess. Worrying about getting in on time, my position, etc.  T300RS huh? I might look into that wheel. I'm going to need one for CARS."
Driveclub,34w9ny,InsaneBirch,1 point,Tue May 5 15:38:46 2015 UTC,"Boo! Could always do with the competition on PS4. I've got a decent PC but prefer to play the PS4.  If you can afford a T300RS, you can afford a G27 which is arguably better (no PS4 support). Have a look at reviews ok both wheels before making a choice, as they're not cheap! I splashed out £260 on Amazon."

Or am I missing the point?"
Driveclub,34wkgm,MeanElf,1 point,Tue May 5 08:05:38 2015 UTC,No you're right there. What do you mean by the region account?
Driveclub,34wkgm,MeanElf,1 point,Wed May 6 09:02:28 2015 UTC,"Playstation games are region free, so you can buy a Japanese or EU game that perhaps is not available where you are based. Trouble is, the DLC is region specific. Region in this case is the part of the world where your PS Store is. If you have bought the game from a retailer based elsewhere in the world, the 'local' DLC probably won't work with your copy of the game."

I probably should turn it all back off again now.

Driveclub,34qoiz,thavius_tanklin,8,Sun May 3 19:03:29 2015 UTC,Don't race the track. Be the track. Breath the corners. Taste the speed. No can fail.
Driveclub,34qoiz,MeanElf,1 point,Sun May 3 19:26:40 2015 UTC,"I like it - this is good advice though. Trouble is, in a race environment with dynamic AI it is different each time, and I appreciate that learning the likely patterns can be frustrating. In the end though, there are certain lines and places, just like in the real world, where you will likely meet problems.  So, as also mentioned, learn the tracks, know where the problem spots are and wing-it...so, like thavius says ""...Don't race the track. Be the track. Breath the corners. Taste the speed. No can fail"" In other words, have faith and trust in the force.  You'll be fine."
Driveclub,34q6ec,1001chris,6,Sun May 3 16:05:51 2015 UTC,I use the dashboard cam that is inside the car. It's quieter than the outside cam and I can see more than if I used the full cockpit cam.
Driveclub,34q6ec,Arkane308,2,Sun May 3 16:47:14 2015 UTC,"If it's just noise, you can choose which sound type you have.  Can choose to have outside sounds while inside, etc."
Driveclub,34q6ec,JamJamYOLO,5,Tue May 5 09:22:04 2015 UTC,"I switched to cockpit cam a while back, it's hard to go back to chase cam now... it feels like I'm controlling a toy. I also use the bonnet cam occasionally to experience the external car sounds, I know I can get them inside the cockpit but prefer to keep things as realistic as possible."
Driveclub,34q6ec,purrrfect,3,Sun May 3 22:30:59 2015 UTC,"Cockpit for most singleplayer for full immersion, bonet for multiplayer for best times."
Driveclub,34q6ec,MeisterEder,2,Sun May 3 21:05:49 2015 UTC,I like to vary my camera views. * Time Trial = farthest chase cam * Races = Cockpit / farthest chase cam I find the cockpit cam immersive and gives a disadvantage which I sometimes use online (because I'm quicker than most racers I encounter online).  I'm quicker with chase cam and I can see the extent of my car so know how much I can push each corner to set the fastest times.
Driveclub,34q6ec,InsaneBirch,2,Sun May 3 16:30:07 2015 UTC,"Driver's view for racing, well, most of the rest of the time really - but if it's filthy weather, especially at night, I'll use the bonnet cam."
Driveclub,34q6ec,MeanElf,2,Sun May 3 16:53:27 2015 UTC,"Closest chase cam. Cockpit cams are nice, but its incredibly odd feeling when you're using the ds4."
Driveclub,34q6ec,Sgt_ZigZag,4,Sun May 3 17:59:33 2015 UTC,"3rd person view, usually the closest. I enjoy playing with the 1st person view where the camera is positioned on top of the hood but it's not appropriate for any serious play. Quite simply you need to see your entire car to know how you close you can get it to the edge of the track, your opponents etc. You can't get a good feel for that in any 1st person views."
Driveclub,34q6ec,MeisterEder,2,Sun May 3 16:48:29 2015 UTC,"You can't get a good feel for that in any 1st person views.   Yes you can, just like you can get a good for it when really driving your car. Aside, you can judge the distance to a car in front of you very precicely when using the bonet cam, 3rd person not so much."

Driveclub,34q6ec,TXL26R,1 point,Sun May 3 20:08:19 2015 UTC,"Mostly the inside hood view, because that's what I find comes closest to what you percieve as a driver in a real car when you just look straight out the windshield. When it rains I go to the outside hood view because I'm getting easily distracted by the wipers and for drifting challenges I use the far away 3rd person so I can see were the rear of the car is going."

I can see the car front, hear the engine the best, (I drive automatically and often shift from hearing)  and I'm up close to the action the best. Bumper is tool low, cockpit has so much eye candy but sometimes the instruments are hard to read or distracting.   Never do third person anymore unless I'm trying to get a good look at the car."
Driveclub,34q6ec,billythemule,1 point,Wed May 6 12:34:45 2015 UTC,"I use the 3rd person view, farthest away. I can judge distances easier for breaking and see whether there is someone beside me. If I have a really hard time keeping control of the back end of the car, I switch to either the dash cam or the bonnet cam. I notice subtle movements better using those cams. The cockpit cam can be decent depending on the car but I mostly just use it for the immersion factor (the cars in this game are sick!)."
Driveclub,34q6ec,JamJamYOLO,0,Sun May 3 19:55:02 2015 UTC,Cockpit because it gives me an adrenaline rush.  Sounds ridiculous but being able to see the hands on the wheel helps me control the car.  Also it makes me feel like a badass going ham in a Ferrari or lamborghini.
Driveclub,34pywq,mrwynd,3,Sun May 3 14:52:26 2015 UTC,"This car, is probably up there in the category of   worst handling vehicle in the game.  As well as top prize for the car with No Brakes.  It wouldn't surprise me if you had to stop halfway up on Oliver's Landing just to get  the bloody thing to stop and go through the first corner alive. I actually have to use the handbrake to turn that thing to get it past most corners. Something which i should not have to do. Unless i'm drifting.  BUT WAIT  There's an upside to it all  At least the car doesn't stick its back-end out whenever you brake (SLS Electric) or let off the gas cough Renault DeZir cough"

Driveclub,34dxp8,HarryNohara,2,Thu Apr 30 17:42:37 2015 UTC,And in the rain. Tough. Super tough.
Driveclub,34dxp8,SecretlyCarl,2,Fri May 1 01:29:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, Elements Tour Pack. This time in storming weather at pitch-black nighttime. My tips: set your screen to maximum brightness to actually see something. Goal time 1:20:000.  I've completed it today, started last night, managed 1.20.084 relatively quickly, but then never to get close again. Today I had to get it, at least in 5 laps I was gonna make it, I failed in the last corner. My final lap i managed a 1:19.372. Probably took me about 200-300 tries, most of them ending after the first corner though.  My tactic is gaining time on the first part by being extremely fast, and cross my fingers I do not make a mistake on the last part.  Breaking points, 1st corner, after the fence on the right side, there is a white and red barrier, break a little after that, deep into the corner. The second corner can be taken without lifting by cutting the corner a bit.   The 3rd corner, you wanna break into the corner again, and get the car straight as fast as possible. 4th corner, better to brake to early then to late, I brake just after the overhead thingy. After the straight, there is no absolute braking point. I brake just after the last corner arrow on the right side in the grass. My tactic here is keep the inside, tap on the throttle a little.   The following corners are crucial, again brake just after the last corner arrow, tap the throttle and break, and cut a little of the corner. The safest way (not the fastest) is again staying on the inside. Cut the corner to the left, and break at the arrow to the right. Then its full throttle while cutting trough the chicane.   The last corner is tricky. It can be taken full throttle, but I do not advise it. Lift a little, dont steer in to fast and not to late. The apex is very difficult to find.   This was indeed a difficult one. I had the most problems in the beginning with vision. The 3rd person camera in Driveclub, I just hate it. I want the camera to be fixed, as with all other camera options."

Driveclub,34dqkc,FINDTHESUN,3,Thu Apr 30 09:31:51 2015 UTC,"I have yet to start using manual transmission. It's sad that ive been playing racing games for a while, but i still don't feel like doing manual...Im just too clumsy at it."
Driveclub,34dqkc,helderico,3,Thu Apr 30 13:55:51 2015 UTC,If anything just start learning to downshift going into corners. It has completely changed my game in the best way. The way the car handles through the corner is completely differently and you can also jam on the downshifts to control speed. Try it out!
Driveclub,34dqkc,Pauls2theWall,1 point,Thu Apr 30 17:52:59 2015 UTC,"Cheers, fella. Once I hit the next plateau, I'm going manual!"
Driveclub,34dqkc,Pauls2theWall,2,Thu Apr 30 18:39:30 2015 UTC,The good thing is the game is essentially auto/manual so you can practice better.
Driveclub,34dqkc,NachoManSandyRavage,2,Thu Apr 30 20:14:34 2015 UTC,"By sheer coincidence, I watched one of your vids today. Serious skills. I'm some way off going manual but I'm working up to it! :)"
Driveclub,34dqkc,helderico,3,Thu Apr 30 18:40:50 2015 UTC,"Another tip that many people don't know about which works really well in front wheel drive and all wheel drive cars is left foot braking. In a high speed corner, you only left off the gas a little bit while gradually letting in you brakes and turning. This keeps  your weight from shifting completely forward and you can take high-speed corners way faster than you normally would be able too without losing control. It takes a little practice to get the balance right but once you do, it's amazing how much faster you can take some corners."
Driveclub,34dqkc,Comaburr,3,Thu Apr 30 12:14:00 2015 UTC,"Yea this is quite useful. The best way to brake in my opinion is to slam it and then immediately release it A LITTLE.  This helps you find the point where your break locks, especially if you are playing some simulator with ABS off.  For throttle control, like when i'm accelerating a beasty Koenigsegg One after a hairpin, i like to fast tap the throttle trigger. Really fast tapping (like if it was a guitar hero song with loads of notes :P), and progressively harder, until i feel like i have control of it.  I know this is not the best way to do throttle control, but i just dont have the same precision with the throttle trigger as i have with the brake trigger (go figure)..."
Driveclub,34dqkc,Kreatiive,3,Thu Apr 30 12:34:00 2015 UTC,"This is the way I do it, as well.  I feel like the margin for error with slowly pressing the trigger like you would driving in reality is too small. Tapping the throttle until it's safe to hold it down completely is what I like to do... although, I feel like I am probably doing myself a disservice by not doing it the way OP is talking about; I could probably shave more time off my laps if I did.  I got all the stars, though, so I'm not too bummed. =P"
Driveclub,34e9ik,helderico,2,Thu Apr 30 13:05:16 2015 UTC,"It would be a great feature but I'm guessing the engines aren't as textured and might not be on all cars. They can't really add something to every car in the game post-release. Believe me, this is an amazing idea, its just, the game doesn't have an adequate amount of resources for it.  That's just a guess though so suggesting it on their Facebook and Twitter page might get their attention. They seem to be very open to community suggestions there as a lot of suggested features and cars come from there."

Driveclub,34dbl2,bleuberry73,3,Thu Apr 30 05:56:14 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I'm fairly certain that this is exactly how the game used to work, back around launch date when they had all the server issues. They must have removed the feature because it may have alleviated some of the stress on their server (they would only need to load one ghost as opposed to a new one every lap). I used to love that feature and I really wish they'd give you the option to turn it back on again.  EDIT: found a video proving that your wish used to be the default behavior: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgMNjzob8js first lap around shows the slowest ghost (because you haven't set a time yet) and after that it loads the ghost of the player right above you on the leaderboards."

Driveclub,34dbl2,MeanElf,1 point,Sun May 3 10:57:24 2015 UTC,"Are you sure? I'm doing laps around many different tracks, as well as completing point-to-point races and restarting them. All I ever get for a ghost is the #1 car and my best ghost.   The game used to work like you are describing, but I believe they removed this feature.  I would be very interested if you could prove that this functionality is still possible."

Driveclub,34et24,helderico,2,Thu Apr 30 20:54:08 2015 UTC,I don't see why there should be a level cap. Just let it go up and up like a score.
Driveclub,34et24,i_like_reddit_,1 point,Thu Apr 30 16:50:20 2015 UTC,"Like Helderico says, the points continue to go up for each race. look on your profile and you'll see how much XP you have out of the level 50 total - in my case that's way, way more than the 14 million or so.  You can also focus on clearing accolades, which you can keep a track of from your profile page."
Driveclub,34et24,MeanElf,1 point,Fri May 1 06:16:36 2015 UTC,"I've been level 50 about a month after the game came out. So December-ish time. It gets boring as you don't hear the sound play when you hit a new level.  But i've gotten used to it now. While Evo Studios have confirmed there will be a higher level cap, i just race around on Multiplayer. And complete the new tours whenever they come out. As that's the only thing i look forward to at the end of the months."

Driveclub,34cvem,Austi2games,1 point,Thu Apr 30 03:14:30 2015 UTC,That car is crazy fast. Gave it a try earlier and seriously.. To avoid crashing had to break like a couple of km before the turn.

Driveclub,349lq5,NikolajMyBrother,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:06:04 2015 UTC,"That is the way you always have to do it.

As I already downloaded it/bought it, there's no button for me to press. It shows as bought in the store and that's it. No idea what's different in your case..."
Driveclub,349lq5,NikolajMyBrother,2,Wed Apr 29 16:15:52 2015 UTC,"I downloaded all the DLC directly from the store at midnight before I booted up the game this morning. Ingame the shopping cart icon was still showing on the Turbocharged tour, so it sent me back to the PS Store, where all I had to do was press 'Chose a version"" which gave me 2 free choices. I just chose the first one. Nothing actually downloaded, it just gave me a confirmation. I hit the back button and returned to the game, where the events were now unlocked.."

Driveclub,348boq,hasanjaroudi,1 point,Wed Apr 29 02:52:25 2015 UTC,Wait so does the season pass just give you a discount on DLC?
Driveclub,348boq,RSLW70,5,Wed Apr 29 04:02:06 2015 UTC,"I think what he's trying to say is it's cheaper than buying the dlc separately. Once you have the season pass, the dlc packs do become free."

Driveclub,348boq,hasanjaroudi,1 point,Wed Apr 29 04:22:29 2015 UTC,"70% - so if you buy the season pass you save that much off the total amount you would have paid. It's a bona fide bargain.  The game is very worth it - plenty to do and a very visual, visceral experience."

Driveclub,348boq,b4rks,2,Wed Apr 29 09:03:59 2015 UTC,I would say yes. But I would also say to check out Project Cars... or wait until some comparisons pop up this week and see which one sounds more your style.

Driveclub,348boq,petedee,2,Wed Apr 29 11:26:26 2015 UTC,"It always depends on what your after, if you want something that has:    ""Semi -Arcade""  handling which is somewhat similar to the old MSR / PGR games Pretty graphics *A European focus on cars (there are a few muscle cars but they're very limited at the moment) An ""Old school"" career mode (none of this open world stuff, just races, time trials and drifting) Lots of content (especially with the season pass)   Then its a really good choice.  Its a real shame they haven't got the PS+ version out there, I'm sure a lot of people would love the game if they got a chance to play it."
Driveclub,348boq,JamJamYOLO,3,Wed Apr 29 12:15:44 2015 UTC,"I was craving a racing game as well since NFS.  I wanted to play the driveclub ps+ edition to try it out.  Well, as you know it hasn't happened yet, although an announcement is due soon.  I picked it up used for 27$.  Worth. Every. Penny.  The mechanics are somewhere between gran turismo and nfs.  You can e brake turns, if you are good.****  the mechanics are good, the graphics are GORGEOUS.  I recommend using Spotify during it for music.  I haven't enjoyed a racing game this much in many years, and I have barely scratched the surface of the content.  Every car I've driven so far has been responsive and fun to drive.  I do wish it was a LITTLE more arcadey,  but that is purely preference.  I recommend it and wish I would have gotten it much earlier (although not at release).

Driveclub,3481u0,TechWookiee,3,Wed Apr 29 02:01:47 2015 UTC,"I was the same way when I first got the game. You'll get it eventually.    It really is about controlling your speed into and out of corners, and being light and smooth on the brakes and throttle. I forced myself to learn this by doing some rookie races with about 5-8 AI racers. Don't worry about coming in 1st or even moving up the pack. Just try to keep in line and speed with them. Once you get used to that, do some time trials and see if you can maintain good speed and line without the AI showing you. You'll start to get the feel for it soon enough."

Driveclub,3481u0,sgtsolo,4,Mon May 4 13:42:22 2015 UTC,"Biggest tip that I've used is to not mash down the accelerator through corners.  Try to get in the mindset of only applying the throttle when the car is going straight.  This means through corners you might completely lift off of the gas and only rely on the brakes. Two ways to try to maintain speed through corners are feathering the gas, in other words, quickly press and depress the gas in a steady rhythem.  Another way is to upshift a gear or two, just to maintain speed but eliminate wheel spin. (It's harder to spin out when your up a few gears and don't have the torque). Once you get used to the handling (Every car is slightly different) you can start to practice holding steady throttle through corners in the appropriate gear, until you're on the verge of sliding out.  Practice Practice Practice!  Keep asking the right questions, see you on the track!  **Edit Added Examples: Feathering a bit, but mostly lifting off the throttle through corners.  - https://youtu.be/_hz0VoZU7g0?t=144 Feathering slightly more -  https://youtu.be/u_1VTLQPbFA?t=138 https://youtu.be/-hmwMO7LY0Q?t=86 Staying in 3rd gear to avoid losing traction - https://youtu.be/uojBLj3cucE?t=121"

( I meant the time trial, though the endurance is OK too.)  And I fucked up on the last lap of the endurance. Cost me a solid 5 seconds. I could potentially take 7 or 8 seconds off of that if I had nearly perfect laps the whole time, so it would not surprise me, and I'm somewhat expecting, to see laps right near 11:40-42 for this race.  Good luck, everyone.  OK, so for some reason the challenge did not register my time. I had this issue last week with the time trial, but luckily was able to beat my time and it was registered then. In the meantime, here is a screenshot of my time to prove I did it and got a time. I will attempt it again later in the week, so it might register then, but if I don't get a chance to, here you go."

Driveclub,3429sw,InsaneBirch,1 point,Tue Apr 28 12:55:06 2015 UTC,Should be able to invest some time on Weds/Thurs for this - hope the competition is fierce!
Driveclub,3429sw,Thatcrazylemur,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:27:15 2015 UTC,I'll have a gander tomorrow. Let the games begin.
Driveclub,3429sw,Thatcrazylemur,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:58:13 2015 UTC,Feel free to remove me. I'm too rusty for it.
Driveclub,3429sw,PepeSylvia11,1 point,Tue Apr 28 01:44:00 2015 UTC,I need full confirmation from you. That you want to leave. If you don't mind :)
Driveclub,3429sw,Arkane308,2,Wed Apr 29 14:19:54 2015 UTC,"I know that you've said you'll ignore posts about entry, but is there any chance at all I could fill this spot if they aren't participating?  I used to take part in these championships, but I've been hooked on GTAV for a while. Previously I was starting to reel in /u/InsaneBirch, albeit slowly, but I expect I'd be a bit rusty now. I'd love to race with you guys again, and I came back and started keeping up with the sub again literally a day after you closed enrolment/made this post.   I get it if not, but I really want to be involved again."
Driveclub,3429sw,h2g2_researcher,2,Sat May 30 13:10:20 2015 UTC,Get yourself on Project CARS :) I'm racing over there these days.
Driveclub,3429sw,h2g2_researcher,2,Sat May 30 16:15:59 2015 UTC,"I'll be getting it as soon as I can man, and I'll be sure to hit you up."
Driveclub,3429sw,InsaneBirch,1 point,Sat May 30 18:10:19 2015 UTC,I'm afraid not as of recently I had to step down as the host. As I waited for replacements one came in. But he too dropped out evidently cancelling the Championship.
Driveclub,3429sw,Hungry_Grump,1 point,Mon Jun 1 08:46:17 2015 UTC,"So is this just not happening then? That'd be a shame. I could volunteer to host if I knew what I would actually need to do, but I don't have permanent access to my PS4 right now so I wouldn't always be available."
Driveclub,3429sw,Hungry_Grump,1 point,Tue Jun 2 17:27:38 2015 UTC,Also adding to the Endurance issue. Did the race to completion and no time or attempt updated.
Driveclub,3429sw,InsaneBirch,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:13:13 2015 UTC,Hopefully I can do better than my qualifying run. I couldn't get a handle on the power into turn 1 with that rwd car. I was a second back going into the second corner every time...rwd high horsepower cars are my worst class to drive.
Driveclub,3429sw,Hungry_Grump,1 point,Tue Apr 28 07:23:59 2015 UTC,Is there typically a limit to the number of attempts we're permitted?
Driveclub,3429sw,InsaneBirch,2,Tue Apr 28 11:08:24 2015 UTC,Only if the Event is labelled Restricted in the Title. There will be rules within that when it is made. But for now. Events like these have no limits with attempts. Take as many as you need.
Driveclub,3429sw,Hungry_Grump,1 point,Tue Apr 28 11:22:49 2015 UTC,Thanks. :-)
Driveclub,3429sw,InsaneBirch,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:59:02 2015 UTC,"Competition is good so far! Took a while to grab top spot on TT but there's a little bit more time I can make (.100 at best), so keep it up guys.  Edit (04/05/15): Well... My time got demolished by a good 5-tenths, so had to do something to challenge back, currently at 1:06.893 (as opposed to the 1:07.4xx I had at the time of this comment)."
Driveclub,3429sw,DrSpud,1 point,Tue Apr 28 22:36:26 2015 UTC,"A couple of things: Why is InsaneBirch in my league? Any why, despite being .054 seconds behind him, did it not save my time? I tried restarting, and every lap I set adds another ghost in the road, until I can't possibly achieve a better score."
Driveclub,3429sw,InsaneBirch,1 point,Wed Apr 29 08:58:39 2015 UTC,InsaneBirch is in League 2 as a result of his points in the last Season. He was in the relegation zone and was relegated at the end of last season because of this.   If you're having any trouble with the times. Try and snap a screenshot and send it to my ID or Send it here. That way i can see the time and log it down.
Driveclub,3429sw,Hungry_Grump,1 point,Wed Apr 29 09:22:56 2015 UTC,"Okay. Makes sense. Then it seems I've tried a bit too hard trying to beat someone who isn't actually in my league. The upside is I did beat InsaneBirch. Time is 1:07.425. The leaderboards haven't updated, but I took a screenshot, and then took a photo. I'll try and get it up."
Driveclub,3429sw,InsaneBirch,1 point,Wed Apr 29 09:37:00 2015 UTC,Good job mate. Was that on a restart lap or faster start?
Driveclub,3429sw,Hungry_Grump,1 point,Wed Apr 29 10:01:57 2015 UTC,"Follow through. It's not often someone pushes me this hard! I have to say though, that I always seem to be at my limit when setting a time against yours. There could be room for improvement, but it would have to absolutely perfect."
Driveclub,3429sw,InsaneBirch,1 point,Wed Apr 29 10:23:15 2015 UTC,"I set my time from a restart so there's probably 2-tenths in it there? My lowest first sector has been x.839 (again this is a restarted lap) - I think I got x.9xx in the lap on leaderboard. I could make a few hundredths on the last two corners but that's about it for my limit.  I'll have another bash on Sunday.  Keep it up though, hopefully there's a bunch fighting for overall first ;)"
Driveclub,3429sw,chicken_and_ham,1 point,Wed Apr 29 10:40:39 2015 UTC,"I always find it that /u/InsaneBirch pushes me a lot. When it comes down to Time Trial challenges that don't involve the other fast racers such as DJW_GT and kie25. I'd like to say i'm at the same skill level, but i think i'm just a bit under :)"
Driveclub,3429sw,InsaneBirch,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:25:50 2015 UTC,"I like to think that we're all about the same. Some track and car combinations will just suit us more, allowing us to perform better than the other, but on a marginal scale."
Driveclub,3429sw,MeisterEder,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:35:26 2015 UTC,I'd like to think we are all the same too. But comparing my performances in both Multiplayer and Challenges alone. The differences can be seen.   I'm sure others would feel this way too. But it's all about the improvements.
Driveclub,3429sw,InsaneBirch,1 point,Wed Apr 29 14:45:37 2015 UTC,"I'm in League 2. I think There was one challenge sent out to everyone for ease. When the event finishes, Arsenal will see split into the leagues and give points accordingly."
Driveclub,3429sw,chicken_and_ham,1 point,Wed Apr 29 09:24:26 2015 UTC,"If I set a lap time in a time trial and hit restart, the game usually doesn't save my time. It may restart and show that time while I race as a ghost, but then I select ""finish"", and the time is not saved on the leaderboard.  Today something even worse happened: I set a time, paused the game, resumed, did a few more laps, then finished. My top time was not saved, instead it saved a worse time I set after resuming."
Driveclub,3429sw,chicken_and_ham,1 point,Sun May 3 06:35:17 2015 UTC,Vid deleted. See my other post for updated time and video.

Driveclub,3429sw,InsaneBirch,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:29:06 2015 UTC,How are you getting on with Endurance?
Driveclub,3429sw,cbast15,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:36:58 2015 UTC,"I haven't attempted it yet. Solo race challenges aren't great for me, since a little bit of luck is required to get ahead of the AI unless you're in pole position."
Driveclub,3429sw,DrSpud,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:11:42 2015 UTC,My Endurance run (video)   11:48.551
Driveclub,3429sw,InsaneBirch,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:38:17 2015 UTC,"So now I feel good about my 11:55, was a bit in the dark work no comparison."
Driveclub,3429sw,InsaneBirch,1 point,Sat May 2 01:32:02 2015 UTC,"That's the worrying part, I don't know if I need to beat me time. I can easily take 10-20 secs off."
Driveclub,3429sw,Moonhowler22,1 point,Sat May 2 06:53:13 2015 UTC,"10-20 secs   Judging from your times and number of tries you needed to do it, you drive like a mad man. :)  Do you use the DS4 or a wheel?"
Driveclub,3429sw,InsaneBirch,1 point,Sun May 3 21:13:19 2015 UTC,I use DS4 :). Thinking about investing in T300 RS but that'll be for Project CARS.
Driveclub,3429sw,Thatcrazylemur,1 point,Sun May 3 21:25:19 2015 UTC,I'm thinking of investing for pcars too. I'm put off manual trans worth the way is always mapped on a controller. Flappy paddles would entice me I think.

Driveclub,3429sw,InsaneBirch,1 point,Mon May 4 00:05:45 2015 UTC,Lol i'm not giving this anymore tries. I can't really be bothered lol.
Driveclub,3429sw,Sveenja,1 point,Mon May 4 05:02:13 2015 UTC,"I figure I've got a point to prove! I'm League 1 material and I can reclaim my crown, but that'll have to wait until next Season :("

I was thrilled to get a 1:07.8, until I dropped .5 seconds. I don't know how I ever thought I could challenge you.   Other than that Ferrari time trial last season :P  I think that was the most fun I've had with these events."
Driveclub,3429sw,Sveenja,1 point,Tue May 5 04:32:01 2015 UTC,"You'll be surprised how quick you can go if you have someone else to push you to the limit. It also helps to spend a few hours on the track, trying to perfect every corner."
Driveclub,3429sw,InsaneBirch,1 point,Tue May 5 22:29:59 2015 UTC,"I can respect this, the majority of my energy in the earlier seasons went towards beating you because you were in the top spot regularly. I think the closest I got was within ~5 seconds... And I'll be back. ;)"
Driveclub,3429sw,MeisterEder,0,Tue Jun 2 17:30:51 2015 UTC,"Vader_NOOOOO  Why, whyyyyyy the worst car EVER had been chosen to endurance? I want to hear horsepower and smell that gasoline. I won't drive this shitty car :)"
Driveclub,33ye0j,niveK-,2,Sun Apr 26 20:36:35 2015 UTC,"Are you using a car that you haven't unlocked yet? It'll let you drive, but you don't get fame points or stats when driving an unlocked car.    Do you only have 3 miles total for the accolade, or the 10 laps only netted you 3 miles for the race?"
Driveclub,33ye0j,TechWookiee,0,Mon Apr 27 04:47:37 2015 UTC,I'm using my own car and it only got me three miles
Driveclub,33ye0j,Hungry_Grump,1 point,Mon Apr 27 07:35:46 2015 UTC,Perhaps it is a bug. Doing normal time trial games gets some me good mileage for whatever car/manufacturer I'm using.
Driveclub,33vub6,vectrox,3,Sun Apr 26 02:59:28 2015 UTC,"Since this is almost certainly not going to happen with Driveclub, I implore you to play Dirt 3.  The ""complete edition"" is 30% off on Humble this weekend, and it's probably the best Group B experience you'll get.  Graphics are actually pretty great, even though it's almost 5 years old.  I've been playing it all weekend.  Assists off, manual trans, helmet cam, and it's REALLY hitting the spot for some off road racing.  They should really do a remaster for PS4/X1.  Here's hoping Codies is working on Dirt 4 for current consoles."
Driveclub,33vub6,withoutapaddle,1 point,Sun Apr 26 05:32:24 2015 UTC,"If you like D3 then you should give WRC3 a go for its Group B - far more visceral and longer, narrower stages. Okay, Milestone is a small studio compared to Codemasters, but they did superbly with WRC3 and 4 (no Group B in 4 btw.)  On topic though, Driveclub was originally planned as an off-road rally style game. I hope that the next game they do will be a return to that idea. I love DC but I love rally driving more."
Driveclub,33vub6,MeanElf,1 point,Sun Apr 26 11:28:31 2015 UTC,"Are you sure?  Reviews were quite poor for both of those games.  Also, I can't even find WRC 3 for sale on any of the major distribution platforms (GoG, GMG, Steam, etc).  Where can it be purchased digitally?"
Driveclub,33vub6,withoutapaddle,1 point,Sun Apr 26 18:09:52 2015 UTC,"The reviewers have never been kind to Milestone - that didn't stop plenty of people from enjoying the games. This is one of the reasons why I don't really pay much attention to reviewers and their words.  I'm not sure about the PC side of sales, the platform copies were EU release only though, until a year or so later; even then the distribution was sporadic. Most folks ordered physical copies from the EU. Gamers Gate seem to have it though - but like I say, I'm not a PC gamer so have no idea if regional locks would be a problem."
Driveclub,33vub6,MeanElf,1 point,Mon Apr 27 07:35:38 2015 UTC,"I'll look into it, thanks.  It's weird because most places seem to have every one except 3.  If I get enough of my Group B fix from Dirt3, would you recommend WRC 4 instead of WRC 3?"
Driveclub,33vub6,withoutapaddle,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:29:07 2015 UTC,"No worries - WRC 4 unfortunately didn't have any Group B cars at all, which was a real shame as it was an improvement on WRC 3. If you are happy with D3 though, don't worry too much about searching for WRC 3. I really only suggested it if the game was there, because it would be cheap (bad review fallout.)  WRC 1 and 2 were not as appealing, for most people. I'm glad I played them, but they're not everyone's cuppa."
Driveclub,33vub6,MeanElf,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:41:38 2015 UTC,"I have never played a Milestone game, but have been paying attention to their development of Sebastien Loeb Rally EVO for the current gen consoles. Early screen shots look promising. I'm hoping they announce a release date soon. Right now it is scheduled for late 2015."
Driveclub,33vub6,joking_aura,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:28:06 2015 UTC,Thank you for this. Sadly I'm on PS4 only so guess I'm waiting;).

Driveclub,33ul5e,gshock88,3,Sat Apr 25 19:48:49 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately the AI drivers are definitely bad at avoiding the player. They pretty much always ram you to stay on their racing line.  However, once I got used to Driveclub's physics I never found them too difficult. They aren't on the hardest difficulty in the tours, and they set times that are fairly slow compared to leaderboard top times.  You might try experimenting with how far you can push cars in Driveclub; it took me a bit of time to get used to it. You can take corners much faster than in a sim as long as you have a good outside-inside-outside line. You could also try going into single race time attack with the car and track you're having trouble with, and see how the ghosts drive."
Driveclub,33ul5e,DrSpud,4,Sat Apr 25 20:32:15 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately the AI drivers are definitely bad at avoiding the player. They pretty much always ram you to stay on their racing line.   That is not my experience. Every now and then they touch my car a bit but not by far enough to actually make me crash. The crashing into me only occurs when I made a bad mistake and just drive onto the road again without looking out for other cars. There was a quite nice piece on this dualshockers did a while back.   They aren't on the hardest difficulty in the tours, and they set times that are fairly slow compared to leaderboard top times.   And they have been made easier in a recent update so their speed gain in your sliptstream is lower than before.   You could also try going into single race time attack with the car and track you're having trouble with, and see how the ghosts drive.   This would be my advice as well. When you're not able to (quite easily) win against any AI then you need to brush up your fundamental DriveClub skills and that is perfectly done by trying to drive like the ghosts."
Driveclub,33ul5e,MeisterEder,4,Sat Apr 25 22:26:40 2015 UTC,I don't have a link to hand but there are some videos out there on YouTube that show the AI are good at avoiding the player. Be it mid race when overtaking or if you lose control/crash or even to the extreme of parking on the track on a circuit as a stationary obstacle.

Driveclub,33ul5e,too_much_minecraft,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:18:06 2015 UTC,"Don't forget that at all levels up to but not including Legend difficulty, they will adapt their pace during the last lap or section to allow you to catch up.  As for the ramming, I found that they pretty much only ram in retaliation. If you run a clean race, don't knock them (which is a masterful art in itself) then they will do their best to avoid you, even conceding ground when taking a corner correctly. There are naturally exceptions to this, but those are rare and watching the replay will often clear up any ambiguity."
Driveclub,33s6oy,tehghettosmurf,2,Sat Apr 25 02:45:36 2015 UTC,Nice one! I really need to start driving with that view instead of the 3rd person behind the car camera angle!

One of the things that drew me to DriveClub initially was their commitment to an immersive and detailed cockpit view."
Driveclub,33s6oy,Hiimbeeb,1 point,Sun Apr 26 02:35:09 2015 UTC,"I love the cockpit view more than anything, but I always feel like I'm gimping myself when using it. I play so much better with the camera behind the car but I feel way more immersed when I'm in the cockpit cam."

Driveclub,33oi32,titanmp9,9,Fri Apr 24 05:04:22 2015 UTC,"If you go on your profile and check statistics, you'll see a number of progress bars, essentially marking off hours/distance you've put into different aspects of the game. If you click on manufacturers, you'll find your progress level for each. It'll take you a while to complete level 5 of Ferrari but in doing so, you will level up quite rapidly and unlock a number of other cars en route. I think that Ferrari is also the most lucrative manufacturer for level up 'accolade bonuses', which will also help a bit more.   As a general tip for levelling up, learn to drift and just hammer single events one after another, India's Tamil Nadu 2 is very suitable due to its long sweeping corners and short laps. You'll rack up lots of overtaking, drifting and drafting bonus points. That said, I got the game about a month ago and after grinding a number of levels, I realised that the best way to play the game is to just play the game! Work through the tour, get gud, and take the rewards as they come. There are loads of fantastic cars from the start so there's no real need to grind. While the LaFerrari is some way off, you've got some beautiful Ferraris to drive until you get there.   Long post but this game came as a total surprise to me. I've started to proselytise!"
Driveclub,33oi32,Stanshant,3,Fri Apr 24 06:19:19 2015 UTC,You need to be level 5 in the Ferrari owners club and I believe it unlocks.
Driveclub,33oi32,Rorbotron,2,Fri Apr 24 05:23:22 2015 UTC,The Manufacturer Accolades are acquired by mileage driven in any said manufacturer car.  Therefore you'll need to clock in the miles in any Ferrari until you reach max (Lv 5) to unlock LaFerrari.
Driveclub,33oi32,InsaneBirch,1 point,Fri Apr 24 07:06:14 2015 UTC,"as others have said, drive a lot of ferraris so you get the accolade of the manufacturer. once you have that the laferrari becomes available. it's based on km/miles driven."
Driveclub,33oi32,Mutilated_Pencil,1 point,Fri Apr 24 09:23:13 2015 UTC,"Just for clarity, you need to complete level 5 - that'll get you the Ferrari Owner's club accolade."

And I'm eager to try the F40 which is coming on Wednesday! :)"
Driveclub,33me1l,CrazyEoin,1 point,Fri Apr 24 09:55:08 2015 UTC,Came here to ask the same question. I thought it had rift support for a second then remembered its on ps4 so it doesn't. Maybe Morpheus support in the future if we are very lucky and Sony keep investing in it.
Driveclub,33me1l,Hungry_Grump,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:47:50 2015 UTC,"There is an option where you can look into the corner. Personally, it doesn't sit well with me, but I guess it works for some people."
Driveclub,33me1l,withoutapaddle,1 point,Thu Apr 23 23:46:34 2015 UTC,"Yep.  That was the first option I turned off.  Doing it yourself is one thing, but having it happen when the game wants it to happen was super disorienting and caused a complete disconnect between me and the car."

Driveclub,33hbe6,devilspawn6x,2,Wed Apr 22 15:14:05 2015 UTC,"I've said it before, but I would love for them to add a Formula DriveClub car in its own category.  Just something with all stats maxed (except maybe drift).  It would be an absolute blast for people like me that like to get into a groove in time trial mode and really push the racing lines.  The thought brings back memories of Burnout 3 and the insane time attacks they had for the F1 cars back then."
Driveclub,33hbe6,Transcendental_e,1 point,Thu Apr 23 01:59:42 2015 UTC,"It would be cool, but with the way DriveClub handles things like collisions i don't think it's a feasible option for this game."
Driveclub,33hbe6,brampower,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:01:54 2015 UTC,"Only for the race tracks, and even then for only some of the race tracks. Most of the tracks are wayyyy too bumpy for an F1 car to manage without damage."
Driveclub,33hbe6,KinRagamine,1 point,Thu Apr 23 03:25:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think that would work well. Driveclub is not enough of a simulator, and personally i think F1 games should be well in the sim category.  Besides, most of the tracks are not well suited for F1 cars, for they are narrow and sometimes bumpy.  But a whole new F1 simulator with visuals as good as Driveclub? That would be a sight to behold..."
Driveclub,33hbe6,helderico,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:37:35 2015 UTC,"Let's wait and see what F1 2015 brings to the table, but imho F1 2013 at least is much more of an arcade experience than Driveclub is. But yeah I agree with your points."

Driveclub,33gtil,UnitedWeGame,3,Wed Apr 22 12:23:13 2015 UTC,Good review. They truly have set a standard when it comes to feedback imo. They turned a pile of shit into a feild of lush grass. It tripped me out seeing them listen and add their own to what the community asked for and is still asking for. Imagine if we saw that with dice or activision etc. Seems they listen then say good idea but we are just gonns do this instead.
Driveclub,33gtil,devilspawn6x,5,Wed Apr 22 15:12:10 2015 UTC,"What I don't fucking get and this is written so damn often: Why is it bad to be neither full-on arcade or full-on simulation? Why is this nearly perfect synergy of those two worlds, that is Driveclub, not perceived as such, but rather a game that does not know what it wants to be?"
Driveclub,33gtil,MeisterEder,2,Wed Apr 22 23:18:38 2015 UTC,"agreed. reviewers don't seem to grasp that the game is loose intentionally in the turns because for many drivers it's more fun to be able to lose your back end on a sharp turn without losing too much speed. that's what makes driveclub fun though, is that you can salvage speed on a less than stellar line by breaking late and not losing too much speed.  i love sim racing but the reality of speed loss from slipping or just drifting is pretty dramatic in a normal car that isn't setup for drifting."
Driveclub,33gtil,BallPtPenTheif,1 point,Sat Apr 25 00:55:13 2015 UTC,"I think for multiplayer it is frustrating for both the arcade and sim parties. Recklessness pisses off the sim guys but when they beak away they win every time. Its frustrating for both parties. Single player, however, is a different story"
Driveclub,33gtil,bigbadbru,1 point,Thu Apr 23 08:22:01 2015 UTC,"It's just because of genre norms. There was a time where reviewers said the exact same words ""doesn't know what it wants to be"" for a little game called Warcraft."

Driveclub,33g55n,DivineKaze,2,Wed Apr 22 06:27:25 2015 UTC,i think you're playing during some kind of server maintenance. I had the same issue before and then a few hours later everything worked smoothly.
Driveclub,33g55n,Mutilated_Pencil,2,Wed Apr 22 06:38:56 2015 UTC,"Yep, I was getting this as well.  I was playing a lot over the last week or two, and seeing this at least half the time.  Something is wrong with the servers, I'd wager.  I have had no troubles for months and months before this."
Driveclub,33g55n,withoutapaddle,1 point,Wed Apr 22 06:41:59 2015 UTC,I had this happen to me yesterday and the day before. It still hasn't fixed itself. I think the servers are just getting slammed with more people playing because of the update or something.

Driveclub,33h4lv,MeanElf,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:13:10 2015 UTC,"Actually, I have a suspicion that everyone has to download the dlc, because the download is almost instantaneous for me everytime. I believe that you just unlock it when the site acknowledges you have the pass."
Driveclub,33h4lv,MeanElf,2,Sun Apr 26 13:12:20 2015 UTC,"You say future DLC - yes, but only until July inclusive. That's still one hell of a lot of content though."
Driveclub,33h4lv,devilzblood,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:25:16 2015 UTC,Yeah I forgot to clarify that! Will there be any dlc after that though?
Driveclub,33h4lv,MeanElf,2,Wed Apr 22 15:29:20 2015 UTC,"They did say that a second season pass was definitely where they were aiming, though no actual confirmation as of yet."
Driveclub,33h4lv,chicken_and_ham,1 point,Wed Apr 22 15:53:19 2015 UTC,Is it still feasible even after the a few paid DLC's were made free?
Driveclub,33h4lv,jayrockslife,1 point,Wed Apr 22 17:50:53 2015 UTC,"That depends on what you call reasonable. If you are okay with five cars per month (with the exception of two months at four cars) along with two livery packs, two tour event packs of eleven races each - then get the DLC.  Only the first month's DLC was offered free, by way of apology for the online problems encountered during the first week or so. Season pass holders will get another two packs in July, though I'm not sure if those will include cars as well.  The Startline pack which came with the latest patch is (as far as I can see) comprised of selected races from the existing packs and has presumably been made free as a teaser for anyone who hasn't bought the season pass yet."
Driveclub,33h4lv,chicken_and_ham,1 point,Thu Apr 23 00:45:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you don't get stars for startline either."
Driveclub,33gxnm,Witeside,2,Wed Apr 22 13:04:51 2015 UTC,"Hi, all cars are unlocked via levelling and a few of them are unlocked with club levels only. So basically you don't even need to play singleplayer and you can play only multiplayer and unlock them all. I think that the speed of levelling is almost same in multiplayer as it is in singleplayer.  And there is no way to play singleplayer online. I don't know where it was stated, but there is nothing like that.   I hope I helped a bit and sorry for my English :)."
Driveclub,33gxnm,JirkaBruss,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:02:14 2015 UTC,"awesome, thanks so much"
Driveclub,33gxnm,MeanElf,2,Wed Apr 22 14:19:26 2015 UTC,"If MP is your only thing, be aware that DC as great a game as it is, doesn't have private lobbies yet. I mention this as the game has been plagued with the usual 'crash kiddies' who do nothing to endear you to online racing.  The game is also nowhere near 60 (presumably dollars) anymore."
Driveclub,33gxnm,FINDTHESUN,2,Wed Apr 22 15:32:15 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that no one has assumed yet, that all these crash kiddies are due to the game being a bit challenging and not an easy arcade as some other racers are. it takes time to develop the skill required for clean racing :)"
Driveclub,33gxnm,Imperium14,2,Wed Apr 22 17:24:14 2015 UTC,"Also, I don't think a lot of the crash kiddies WANT to learn how to drive clean!"
Driveclub,33gxnm,MeanElf,3,Wed Apr 22 23:21:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. True, some people online are probably struggling initially - but it doesn't take much thought to realise that perhaps learning the tracks and the cars beforehand might make those folks less prone to messing up others' race by missing their brake point or not reading the track correctly."
Driveclub,33gxnm,FINDTHESUN,3,Thu Apr 23 00:37:02 2015 UTC,"That's the most common problem - folks just don't want to brake no matter what, too used to arcades :)"

Driveclub,33cmc1,withoutapaddle,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:17:19 2015 UTC,I think Level 5 was like 160 miles or something like that.   How I did it was pick the last track on the list in Japan and just drove the enzo around while listening to spotify. If you don't have the enzo I guess you can pick the other fastest ferrari. The 458 Speciale?

Driveclub,33cmc1,peat76,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:45:35 2015 UTC,I didn't have to download it from the store. It was just in my game when it updated this morning. I did have the Ferrari accolade completely leveled up. Not sure if you just need to reach level 5 or complete level 5 though.

Driveclub,33f29u,BloodySpades,2,Wed Apr 22 00:18:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly i prefer playing online. You can play offline but you miss out on quite some stuff.  Stuff you can't access when offline: - clubs (a really really good feature that adds way more stuff to the game) - face offs, basicly compete against objectives other players of your skill level have completed (taking turns in a perfect way, drifting for x meters, average speed) sorta like the NFS most wanted challenges of speeding/running lights etc. - dlc: at some point you're going to download some dlc, if not the free one (couple of cars and tour events)  Don't get me wrong you'd still be able to play it but without a network connection it would feel more empty."
Driveclub,33f29u,Mutilated_Pencil,1 point,Wed Apr 22 06:44:20 2015 UTC,"Well, I did beat Burnout Paradise and that's the only racing game I've beaten, and I did it offline."
Driveclub,33f29u,joking_aura,2,Thu Apr 23 21:44:51 2015 UTC,You will need to be connected to race online and send and receive challenges. You need to connect to be a part of a club. If playing offline it will not give you acres to the cars that are unlocked through participating in a club since it connects to your club each time you play. You can play all of the tour events and dlc tours offline though. I played through the entire tour before really getting into the challenges. The challenges can be addicting especially the time trial events. When you do single events for time trials the game will give you the ghost of the person that is ahead of you in the leader board. I have had a blast going round and round a circuit beating progressively faster ghosts. I don't think you need a lot of bandwidth to participate in the club and challenges. Your Ping is more crucial. Mine is usually around 30ms when I check.
Driveclub,33f29u,joking_aura,1 point,Wed Apr 22 12:43:52 2015 UTC,This all requires PS+ right? I'll try and see if I enjoy the base game enough I'll get PS+. I need it for Bloodborne's chalices anyway.

Driveclub,33c92i,Mutilated_Pencil,3,Tue Apr 21 10:50:25 2015 UTC,Wind would be challenging because you would often have to adapt your steering. It would also be interesting because you would be hard to know where it's coming from.
