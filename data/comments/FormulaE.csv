For Race10 we were on the West side of the park (section 6 I think). Pretty good location but we were just waiting for cars to come by with not much else to pay attention to.  For Race 11, we lucked out with a TV screen. We were on the back straight section (23 maybe?) and across the track was a friends-and-family area and I think the screen was for them. But we had a great view of it.   Overall I wish the stands were a bit higher so we could look down a little more. Not sure how they would do it, but maybe some actual seats in the future  for non-VIPs? The radio broadcast throughout the weekend was great."

FormulaE,3di9wo,sibuzaru_k,2,Thu Jul 16 22:06:36 2015 UTC,"That's not a bad idea at all. The only issue that the battery forms part of the chassis, so it would take a fair amount of work to pull the battery out and replace it. Multi-motors deffo needed, plus torque vectoring. It just makes sense."

FormulaE,3dhn9d,WriterRory,6,Thu Jul 16 10:14:25 2015 UTC,Well that's a little misleading. So they'll be driving around at 200kw with a boost of 50kw on occasion. Then we'll see some knight-rider style shenanigans when they hit the turbo boost up to 380kw and all madness ensues. Imagine a blocking move right when someone hits the boost
FormulaE,3dhn9d,KillerJazzWhale,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:29:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, very misleading. But 200 kW still more than 150 kW.  But 200 kW for 31 kg is the very impressive bit. But kind of useless if the min wight limit remains. I would have hoped for more open regs sooner."
FormulaE,3dhn9d,mateussrule1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:04:17 2015 UTC,Yeah but open regs this soon could make the costs prohibitive too early on. The series needs to grow its fanbase before it can justify the expenses that come with open regs

FormulaE,3d2n98,LargeIgneousProvince,4,Mon Jul 13 01:03:53 2015 UTC,"The sound itself is a combination of the application of power as well as the motor itself. If you've ever had a desk fan in which the blade has been jammed, you can hear a faint, high pitched scream of the electric motor and copper coil still attempting to cause rotation of the central 'axle' or rotator not unlike the FE cars, though at the 'low' levels of power in a desk fan, they sound more like a buzz. The principle in a FE car is roughly the same, an electric motor powers the rear axle through the transmission (which is necessary only due to the small size of the motor but it also aides with acceleration as well as making the driver feel more comfortable in their surroundings). There may be some skeumorphic elements added in future but I hope not. These things sound like they're from the future and I personally love it.  As for unique sounds, I can anticipate that as the application of power and the manner in which the motor distributes it changes between power trains (and eventually batteries and energy harvesting etc.) then the sound will change slightly. Of course we are all used to hearing roaring ICEs so the  differences will be harder for us to pick up on but they will be there."

Maybe I need to watch it again because we've had so many great races since then, but I remember loving it. I was really looking forward to it at the time because after Beijing and Putrajaya it seemed like the closest thing to a proper track in terms of layout. The venue itself looked amazing, with the beach and everything, and then JEV got pole on the first try! It was fantastic. The race was the good kind of exciting in my opinion, not like Buenos Aires which just felt unfair to everyone since the suspension failures weren't their fault, that was spectacular but for all the wrong reasons. I think Buenos Aires is my least favourite race of the season just because of that. What's your favourite?"

Also considering they said 80 cities were interested, I'm slightly suprised there seems to be so little change. But its good to see a consistent schedule rather than a completely different one every year"
FormulaE,3co0nk,bouncebackability,2,Thu Jul 9 13:07:36 2015 UTC,"It'd be best to stick to known circuits for the second season with maybe a couple new ones.  We may end up with scenarios where the track is too small or there needs repairs again, so if they stick to tracks that have sorted these issues from last time, it's less hassle over the weekend.  Also wasn't the Berlin ePrix and the Monaco Grand Prix on the same weekend? I think it might work because of the whole FE is on a Saturday, while the F1 race is on Sunday.  But like you said, if it was the same country, then that's a waste and it takes away potential customers away from each other (or most likely, away from Formula E)."
FormulaE,3co0nk,BosleyTree,3,Thu Jul 9 14:22:45 2015 UTC,"yeah there is no problem with two races on the same weekend, but to hold two on the same day in the same country doesnt sound like a good idea."

FormulaE,3c3ugw,tutsmabarreh,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:15:14 2015 UTC,Look at how long it takes between him lifting off the throttle and then hitting the brake on the black and white TV screen above the sim room window.
FormulaE,3c3ugw,sibuzaru_k,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:03:47 2015 UTC,Can't watch the video now but didn't the regen on EV much more strong than traditional engine brake?
FormulaE,3c3ugw,qwya,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:21:38 2015 UTC,"Interesting... I'd have expected regen to imply that it's best for energy to lose speed by braking, not lifting."

FormulaE,3c13tr,JoeyBACON,1 point,Sat Jul 4 12:07:47 2015 UTC,it would be stupid to have a European round inbetween 2 North American rounds.
FormulaE,3c13tr,silentalarm_,0,Sat Jul 4 12:11:32 2015 UTC,Well the Canadian Grand Prix is smack dab between Monaco and Austria* in F1.
FormulaE,3c13tr,JoeyBACON,2,Sun Jul 5 23:50:17 2015 UTC,"Between Monaco and Austria, you mean. Regardless, it'd go against the concept of trying to minimize travel miles and in doing so, environmental impact."

FormulaE,3bw5gl,kickinsticks,9,Thu Jul 2 17:19:16 2015 UTC,"Pick a name already, NEXTEV TCR!"
FormulaE,3bw5gl,Kookanoodles,10,Thu Jul 2 21:07:38 2015 UTC,"Good to see the same 10 teams are staying on, it'll help the series to grow if there is consistency among the teams."
FormulaE,3bw5gl,andrew2209,3,Thu Jul 2 17:45:49 2015 UTC,I remember when the first season was getting sorted out there was talk of Tesla eventually entering a team. I guess this will not happen for a while if ever.
FormulaE,3bw5gl,apot1,4,Thu Jul 2 17:53:02 2015 UTC,"I don't know how much truth was ever in those rumours, but I think Tesla could enter when there's more freedom in car design. Also, I don't think they want too many more teams at the moment, as over 20 cars on a street circuit that's 2km-3.4km could be too crowded."
FormulaE,3bw5gl,andrew2209,2,Thu Jul 2 17:57:36 2015 UTC,"Tesla will wait until the 3rd generation car is in production (if they get involved at all), which I think won't be until 2017"
FormulaE,3bw5gl,Already__Taken,2,Thu Jul 2 18:11:47 2015 UTC,"Tesla will wait until they can use their drive motors and their batteries otherwise there's no point.  That's even if they join, there's not much need for them to really. They've done their high performance sports car bit to get started. Now they want to be seen as a car for everyone everyday."
FormulaE,3bw5gl,luv2belis,2,Fri Jul 3 09:25:21 2015 UTC,"When I went for a test drive for the model s, I asked the salesman why they weren't in formula e. He said the main reason was that Tesla want to stay away from the idea that electric cars have no range and run out of juice quickly, which is why swapping cars midway through the race was a deal breaker."
FormulaE,3bw5gl,Kookanoodles,3,Fri Jul 3 09:11:14 2015 UTC,Important thing: Aguri have lost their title sponsor.
FormulaE,3bw5gl,BosleyTree,2,Thu Jul 2 22:26:40 2015 UTC,So the rumours of the Amlin split are true then.
FormulaE,3bw5gl,Latorata,3,Thu Jul 2 23:29:19 2015 UTC,"By the rate they were giving away merch around the time the rumours were spreading, I knew it was imminent.   While it's bad for them - I'm not complaining I got a free (now-outdated, but still free) Aguri hat.  Maybe we'll now get something that looks a lot like the old Super Aguri F1 liveries? I think that'd look great.  (Artists rendition of a Super Aguri FE Car)"
FormulaE,3bw5gl,BosleyTree,2,Fri Jul 3 00:22:30 2015 UTC,That actually looks awesome.   Would be a shame to lose the blue Amlin colour on track but I'm sure DAMS/Renault (whatever they go with) will be able to make up for it.
FormulaE,3bw5gl,andrew2209,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:28:26 2015 UTC,"An all white Formula E car would look nice. With the possible exception of Dragon/Venturi, I think all the teams have a livery that stands out from the others."
FormulaE,3bvuh8,code777,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:54:51 2015 UTC,"Heidfeld would've been furious if Sarrazin won.  After all his bad luck and almost winning a race, it's his teammate who wins the first race for Venturi."
FormulaE,3bv31h,kickinsticks,8,Thu Jul 2 11:47:57 2015 UTC,"Beijing: At the time it was exciting because it was new but boring compared to what was to follow.  Putrajaya: Showed what the series was capable. A much better track with some great racing.  Punta del Este: Has since been forgotten by everyone but at the time people were raving about it. One of my favourites of the season.  Buenos Aires: Half the grids' cars fell apart on that one curb, a ton of leader changes but the suspension problem put a sour note on the whole day.  Miami: I actually think this was a rubbish track. Thank god for Scott Speed keeping things interesting.  Long Beach: I've completely forgotten everything about it.  Monaco: It's Monaco, what did you expect.  Berlin: The worst race of the season for me. Everything was grey and my man di Grassi gets a DSQ.  Moscow: Better than some have said I think, there was a lot going on during this race. Unfortunately the broadcaster wasn't watching half the time.  London: Despite all the odds this track provided some great racing and is one of the season highlights."
FormulaE,3bv31h,Confused_Shelf,3,Thu Jul 2 14:16:22 2015 UTC,"London Pt 2. Mainly because I was there :P  Also Putrajaya, because while China showed the potential the series had, the second race cemented to me that I'm watching this series for the forseeable future."
FormulaE,3bv31h,JamesMayOwnsMySoul,2,Thu Jul 2 12:03:46 2015 UTC,"Same here for London Round 11.  We did both races, and Round 10 was just a massive disappointment, we had rubbish view of the track, poor organisation and a very dull race (probably the worst of the season). Round 11 was just amazing in contrast, and the culmination of the championship battle with Sam Bird's aggressive overtaking and Senna's defending from Buemi was just brilliant racing.  There has been plenty of great racing this year at other tracks, but R11 definitely sticks out for me."
FormulaE,3bv31h,dogmop,2,Thu Jul 2 13:35:44 2015 UTC,"I haven't watched all races unfortunately, but if there's a race better than London pt 2 My mind would be blown."

She happened to be around when I started up the second London race and by the end she was hooked.
FormulaE,3bv31h,timix,2,Fri Jul 3 09:46:10 2015 UTC,"London Part 2 was pretty thrilling, both at the front of the field and with the championship leaders mid-pack. The two American races were pretty good, but I'd say my favorite was Punta del Este."
FormulaE,3bv31h,drogyn1701,2,Thu Jul 2 16:50:53 2015 UTC,"I need to go back and re-watch some of the races, but I know that I really enjoyed the first three races as well as London.  The only track that I didn't like was Monaco, and thankfully we won't see it next season (going to be a historic race)."
FormulaE,3bv31h,WilliamHowardTwat,2,Thu Jul 2 17:13:56 2015 UTC,"Buenos Aires, although there were a few suspensions problems, the track provided good overtaking opportunities, there were several leader changes, and one of the smaller teams got a victory."
FormulaE,3bv31h,andrew2209,2,Thu Jul 2 17:39:55 2015 UTC,"Punta del Este for me. Great location, surprising quali, exciting race, it had it all."

FormulaE,3bv31h,Kozeyekan_,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:21:33 2015 UTC,"It's hard to choose a best race for the season, for me. London II is the obvious candidate since it sticks in the mind so freshly, and was an absolute nail-biter. Beijing was great, had the build up and the climax. Putrajaya and, Punta del Este and Buenos Aires were the three races that really got me hooked, though. I enjoyed Miami thanks to Speed, but then the championship dulled for a while until Moscow. Never thought I'd say it, but happy Monaco's gone.  In terms of worst race, I really loved the setting of the Berlin track - by chance, I'd stayed close to Tempelhof when I was in Berlin recently and actually walked right past the airfield and airport complex. It's a very cool place.  Unfortunately I don't think the race showed off its potential - the exits from the corners made it difficult to set up other drivers into the next ones, so overtaking was pretty rare. It was also a very grey day and it looked like a concrete jungle on TV, despite there being fields and runways behind it."

But you could create a heavy braking zone before the Eau Rouge by making a artificial chicane.
FormulaE,3bunbl,bTrixy,2,Thu Jul 2 14:54:53 2015 UTC,He did it at low speed to avoid crashing. It'd be insane to do it at racing speeds and then there'd probably be a chicane installed which ruins it for everyone

FormulaE,3bunbl,BosleyTree,1 point,Fri Jul 3 14:10:31 2015 UTC,"No,this is terrible idea.Shortener version of GP circuit hurt hard FE in general.It's better to have Brussels street circuit than Spa,Budapest Street Circuit is better than Hungaroring...

""Oh haha that FE car is a while minute slower than F1, this series is a joke!"" It could end up badly.   But yeah I think more real circuits would be a welcome change for many"
FormulaE,3boaij,CurvyVolvo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:23:21 2015 UTC,"FE shouldn't be pretending to be on the same level as F1, It's more on the level of F3 and there's nothing wrong with that, no one is throwing stones at F3 because they aren't Formula 1 cars but I strongly feel that racing on identikit street circuits is something holding the series back. Let's be honest some parts of this series are already a joke. No tire changes, fan boost, have to change cars halfway through, can't race on full tracks."
FormulaE,3boaij,waxed__owl,3,Wed Jul 1 11:26:18 2015 UTC,"A lot of the idea of FE is to be a 'greener' motorsport. I think Fan Boost is a joke, but tyres that last is good, not racing on 'full' tracks is a good idea because these cars are slow as hell at the moment, but both the speed and the fact they have to change cars will become history once the series is a few years old.  The idea is to advance the technology, and that will come in time. They'll shift to single cars, they'll get faster, and the good thing about these temporary tracks is that they can change the shape and size, so we should see longer tracks as the cars get better."

FormulaE,3boaij,bouncebackability,6,Tue Jun 30 21:34:48 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  I guess I'd rather them stick to Street circuits, but if they can't fill the calender, then I guess this is an OK compromise.  I wonder why they would bypass the chicane on the front straight?"
FormulaE,3boaij,WilliamHowardTwat,5,Tue Jun 30 20:56:32 2015 UTC,I think it would be an interesting mix. the shortcut across the circuit to the back straight would be like a street circuit. Would be weird to then see it join the normal circuit. I like it.
FormulaE,3boaij,Joonaa,2,Tue Jun 30 21:09:08 2015 UTC,"I would prefer just street circuits too, and I doubt they will have much trouble filling up the calendar, seeing how successful it has been so far. There are a lot of cities out there!"

You can ask Alonso how that feels. If anyone was overstepping the limits, it was surely Buemi, although that was understandable in the circumstances."
FormulaE,3bng7g,whatthefat,4,Tue Jun 30 17:17:39 2015 UTC,"At the time I thought some of his defensive moves were quite late, nothing too bad but borderline. I haven't rewatched the race though so that's just from one viewing and there was a lot going on, a second viewing might change my mind.  EDIT: Having watched the last few laps again, it wasn't as bad as I'd remembered, I think the bumpy track and lots of bends made me think Senna was moving around more than he was. It was a great battle though."
FormulaE,3bng7g,Skelenal,4,Tue Jun 30 18:40:39 2015 UTC,"I thought Buemi was being ridiculous for being mad at Senna. You lost the championship, yes, but the guy in front of you is not that whole reason! It's your job to get in front of him as much as it is his to keep you behind. As well, Buemi made a couple of moves that I thought sketchy that could have wrecked Senna"

Perception is a crazy thing, right?"
FormulaE,3bng7g,drogyn1701,0,Wed Jul 1 15:34:41 2015 UTC,"It was fair defense, I didn't see him moving over to block Buemi.  If Buemi is pissed at anyone, that person should be himself, it's entirely his fault for spinning, that's what costed him the championship, not Senna."

There are teams in Formula E and everyone works together to get the best out of the team and drivers. In this situation, to get the best out of Piquet, he needed to get by quickly to help him win the championship.  Do you honestly think Turvey (or any other driver in the same situation), would block Piquet like he was a rival and cost him the championship and cost the team of having a drivers championship under their belt?"

FormulaE,3bizkm,duckliver,7,Mon Jun 29 20:08:54 2015 UTC,"To be fair, WEB-VET relationship was hitting the rock bottom by then and Webber was somewhat butthurt due RB choosing Vettel as their shot to the WDC too early in the calendar and a a point that both were at so few points apart that one good race to Webber could get him above Vettel.  Turvey never really got a shot at the FE WDC, so comparing him to 2012 Webber is pretty null for any points you might want to make."

FormulaE,3bhxl0,Confused_Shelf,4,Mon Jun 29 11:31:02 2015 UTC,"No it was not a given. Renault does not manufacture the cars. The powertrain used this year was made by McLaren and also powers the McLaren P1 supercar. The only work with the Spark-Renault SRT-01E that is provided by Renault is systems integration.   Renault will be making their own powertrain though for next season, and that is what the article is announcing."
FormulaE,3bhxl0,LyskTrevise,3,Mon Jun 29 11:40:26 2015 UTC,Ah okay. I thought they were much more heavily involved in the manufacturing of this year's cars. By system integrations do you mean the computers/electronics?

Non-spec will push some great innovation and hopefully make it more exciting, but there should be a broad counter-weighting force that helps the balance. I have no idea how that would work though."

FormulaE,3bhrr3,F1Picko,2,Tue Jun 30 17:23:29 2015 UTC,Great work!
FormulaE,3bi23y,ForTheVince,7,Mon Jun 29 11:55:55 2015 UTC,Hope Andretti sticks with Vergne. He was immediately on pace but he needs to work on his energy saving skills. I'd like to see Simona back in the 2nd Andretti seat.
FormulaE,3bi23y,chengg,5,Mon Jun 29 17:55:30 2015 UTC,"Simona and Vernge will be a very strong lineup. And if they don't change the second seat at all, they may contend for a Constructors Championship."
FormulaE,3bi23y,GD7901,2,Mon Jun 29 21:05:25 2015 UTC,"JEV will be the test/reserve driver for F1, yes, but I think he is trying to make it in Formula E now that that's all but gone.  As for Simona, I think she will try and make both. There was schedule conflicts between the two series from Monaco on, however I think that the Formula E schedule will be changed to take advantage of F1 offseason/off weeks better next season. Which will also work with INDYCAR offseason."

FormulaE,3bi23y,CurvyVolvo,7,Tue Jun 30 19:29:00 2015 UTC,Trulli needs his own team to keep driving - what team or series would want him after this season's performance?!
FormulaE,3bi23y,The_Rodigan_Scorcher,5,Mon Jun 29 23:03:48 2015 UTC,"Actually, this story on Autosport said he wasn't sure he would continue driving next year."
FormulaE,3bi23y,bouncebackability,2,Mon Jun 29 11:59:13 2015 UTC,Probably the money he has behind him.  Probably the only reason why he got so many chances in F1.
FormulaE,3bi23y,carlordau,4,Mon Jun 29 12:15:16 2015 UTC,There's rumours that van der Garde is looking at the 2nd NEXTEV TCR seat. I could see e.dams keeping the same drivee pairing.
FormulaE,3bi23y,andrew2209,3,Mon Jun 29 14:41:30 2015 UTC,"If TCR take him, I hope Turvey gets a seat somewhere else. Virgin? I could see Sir Richard being happy with a double British line up with him and Bird."
FormulaE,3bi23y,JamesMayOwnsMySoul,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:53:07 2015 UTC,"Possibility, but Citroën are rumoured to want a French driver for Virgin, as part of the linkup"

FormulaE,3bi23y,JamesMayOwnsMySoul,2,Tue Jun 30 14:02:11 2015 UTC,Does anyone know how much these guys are paid by the teams?
FormulaE,3bi23y,kickinsticks,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:13:53 2015 UTC,e.dams will likely stick with Prost and Buemi. Virgin will keep Sam Bird but may need a second driver if Alguersuari's health issues are serious. Liuzzi will likely be back. Aguri want Felix da Costa but he wants DTM. Duran will probably stick around. Heidfeld and Sarrazin said they were happy to stay with the team a couple of races ago but wonder if they might have a look around the paddock. Something isn't working at Mahindra so wouldn't be surprised to see some changes there.
FormulaE,3bi23y,WriterRory,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:25:32 2015 UTC,Virgin will keep Sam Bird but may need a second driver if Alguersuari's health issues are serious.   Virgin may choose a French driver to partner Bird (being DS' works team and all).

FormulaE,3bhuey,WriterRory,3,Mon Jun 29 10:07:41 2015 UTC,"VDG and PIQ could make for a pretty strong lineup! However, he'd best be careful, Piquet Jr. has developed a tendency of making his teammates look like amateurs in Formula E."
FormulaE,3bhuey,Lord_Iggy,5,Mon Jun 29 11:04:51 2015 UTC,Hard to overlook Turvey though. He was supreme this weekend in a difficult car on a difficult track.
FormulaE,3bhuey,Lord_Iggy,5,Mon Jun 29 11:06:23 2015 UTC,"In all honesty, Turvey looked like the strongest of Piquet's teammates. I may have been unfair to him by lumping him in with Tung, Pic and Garcia."
FormulaE,3bhuey,LyskTrevise,3,Mon Jun 29 11:13:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Turvey was mega! And he was a great team player in the end too, I think he earned a lot of respect with Piquet especially who after the race said Turvey was one of the fastest team mates he has had."

FormulaE,3bgxvt,JamesMayOwnsMySoul,16,Wed Jul 1 13:55:02 2015 UTC,"well, Montagny managed to end his career in a pretty discraceful way. But in the driving side, the teammates of Piquet were all weak except for Turvey, and the girls also were slow except for Simona."
FormulaE,3bgxvt,ajalvareze,36,Mon Jun 29 04:18:11 2015 UTC,Trulli
FormulaE,3bgxvt,Osakaboy,9,Mon Jun 29 05:38:37 2015 UTC,Trulli really was bloody awful. Did you see how few points his team had compared to the next worst team?
FormulaE,3bgxvt,keirdre,2,Mon Jun 29 09:06:24 2015 UTC,"Whereas Mahindra and Amlin had races where they got it hooked up and got a decent finish, and Venturi had awful luck, Trulli seemed to struggle all season, only getting a few good qualifying performances and then struggled in the race."
FormulaE,3bgxvt,andrew2209,7,Mon Jun 29 09:09:36 2015 UTC,"Next season, can we just hang a blue flag on a long pole out the front of Trullis car right from the time the lights go out?  Bloody ridiculous all season long - ruined a lot of good battles :("
FormulaE,3bgxvt,tjsr,6,Mon Jun 29 09:46:56 2015 UTC,"Maybe worst relative to expectations, but not the worst driver overall."
FormulaE,3bgxvt,whatthefat,4,Mon Jun 29 17:35:50 2015 UTC,He was Trulli bad.
FormulaE,3bgxvt,Zotak,3,Mon Jun 29 17:15:34 2015 UTC,I can tell Jarno-t kidding.
FormulaE,3bgxvt,Nine10Eleven,4,Tue Jun 30 04:34:13 2015 UTC,"I disagree, yes it wasn't great but the entire Trulli team had problems much larger than just driver problems. The cars may be even but they still need to be fully serviced and run by trained crews, nobody in the field would be able to win a race driving for the Trulli team. Even ignoring the obvious team struggles, Trulli wasn't even the weakest in the team. Cough Cerutti Cough Fontana."
FormulaE,3bgxvt,ERR40,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:02:19 2015 UTC,Sorry I don't buy it. He got pole in Germany remember?

FormulaE,3bgxvt,Underscore_Blues,11,Tue Jun 30 00:08:27 2015 UTC,"Trulli should have done much better, and his constant cutting of the chicane to protect his position was terrible."
FormulaE,3bgxvt,chambee,16,Mon Jun 29 05:06:02 2015 UTC,Katherine Legge was surprisingly bad.
FormulaE,3bgxvt,chengg,6,Mon Jun 29 04:31:31 2015 UTC,"Yamamoto was pretty shit, along with Leimer and Fontana.  You could argue that they were just rookies, but de Silvestro and Turvey did pretty well."
FormulaE,3bgxvt,BosleyTree,10,Mon Jun 29 03:17:27 2015 UTC,"True, but overall de Silverstro and Turvey are considered better drivers than the other three (except for maybe Leimer).  If we go by worst driver of the season, I'd have to say Trulli. Dead last in the championship of those who took part in every race, and much like his late F1 career, he seemed to go backwards in every race."
FormulaE,3bgxvt,Dromologos,5,Mon Jun 29 03:42:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Trulli for me as well. He did qualify well but his race performances were atrocious and the Berlin e-prix probably the best example of his terrible season."
FormulaE,3bgxvt,blackbasset,7,Mon Jun 29 03:53:41 2015 UTC,We had them in the same car.
FormulaE,3bgxvt,LyskTrevise,5,Mon Jun 29 04:13:13 2015 UTC,"All of the Formula E cars were the same cars this season. Identical except down to driver setup, which is a major part of being a good driver anyways."
FormulaE,3bgxvt,GD7901,8,Mon Jun 29 07:30:19 2015 UTC,Marco Andretti didn't do very well in the one race he did in Buenos Aires. He just got lucky that so many front-runners crashed out and he finished 12th.
FormulaE,3bgxvt,captainlag,2,Mon Jun 29 08:19:27 2015 UTC,"Marco is only good at one thing, ovals. Something that is not in Formula E."
FormulaE,3bgxvt,JamesMayOwnsMySoul,7,Mon Jun 29 04:14:23 2015 UTC,"not THE worst, but felt Senna really underperformed for the entire season."
FormulaE,3bgxvt,atw86,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:08:41 2015 UTC,"I've said this before, and I get heat, but I don't think Senna is that great. Paul Di Resta level driver imo."
FormulaE,3bgxvt,italicBus,3,Mon Jun 29 09:21:09 2015 UTC,Michela Cerruti didn't seem to be great
FormulaE,3bgxvt,Confused_Shelf,-4,Wed Jul 1 13:57:06 2015 UTC,Just like in F1 probably Chandhok. Completely outclassed by Senna the whole year.
FormulaE,3bgxvt,keirdre,11,Mon Jun 29 14:11:35 2015 UTC,Completely outclassed?  Chandhok finished ahead of Senna in more races and overall moved up the field whereas the stats show Senna moved backwards down the field over the season (fractionally). Chandhok also got the best qualifying spot (although on average Senna was ahead).
FormulaE,3bh3i8,JoeyBACON,5,Mon Jun 29 04:11:39 2015 UTC,"Prost is also the only driver to actually be affected by the dropped points rule too.  Since he scored in every single round of the championship, and only the best 10 results are counted, his race to 10th on Sunday is essentially moot.  So instead of having scored 89, he has a score of 88. It makes no difference anyway, but it's pretty interesting nonetheless."
FormulaE,3bh3i8,BosleyTree,6,Mon Jun 29 07:47:48 2015 UTC,I had no idea there was even a dropped points rule in place
FormulaE,3bh3i8,bouncebackability,3,Mon Jun 29 10:53:53 2015 UTC,"Ditto. Given the general reliability of these cars, it seems odd that it would be considered necessary!"
FormulaE,3bh3i8,Lord_Iggy,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:59:25 2015 UTC,"I've always thought it was a stupid rule tbh. He only loses one point this time, but his father lost a championship that way."
FormulaE,3bh3i8,JamesMayOwnsMySoul,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:22:10 2015 UTC,"Well, the reasoning behind the rule is not entirely unreasonable. It encourages more aggressive driving, as getting a small number of DNFS or non scoring finishes won't negatively impact you. At the same time, it penalizes drivers who always go for the safe points."
FormulaE,3bh3i8,Lord_Iggy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:44:22 2015 UTC,"Which is exactly my point. If you crash out of a race, you lose the points. It encourages you to be a safer driver, and the teams to build more reliable cars. We all like wheel to wheel racing, but when it penalises a consistent driver, that's wrong."
FormulaE,3bh3i8,JamesMayOwnsMySoul,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:12:35 2015 UTC,"Well sure, if your goal is to reward safe and consistent fast driving, it is silly to have dropped results. It all depends on what behaviour the rule makers want to encourage."
FormulaE,3bh3i8,Lord_Iggy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:50:43 2015 UTC,"It's not really rewarding safe and consistent driving, it's just not penalizing those who do."
FormulaE,3bh3i8,JamesMayOwnsMySoul,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:53:07 2015 UTC,"It is a bit of a semantic problem. Rewarding one group or punishing the other group has the same general effect, whichever way you look at it."
FormulaE,3bh3i8,Lord_Iggy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:56:07 2015 UTC,"But it makes no sense to reward those who crash or are unreliable, both negative things, and/or punish the consistent, something that is usually a positive."
FormulaE,3bh3i8,JamesMayOwnsMySoul,2,Tue Jun 30 20:29:28 2015 UTC,Did not realise that! Shame he didn't score a few more per race as he could have been a title contender. But I guess he helped secure the team the title.

FormulaE,3bern1,RomeroGoon,2,Sun Jun 28 15:53:42 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about this. I wonder whether there's a way to physically hamstring a car if they hit 0%?  Just like if you go over a data cap on a broadband connection and you get throttled to narrowband speeds, how about capping the speed of a car at 30mph, and a big fuckoff amber or yellow flashing beacon on the rear to warn others that a) the driver can't manage his power for shit, and b) there'll be a huge speed differential on approach?  That, or immediately black flag them so they're not even considered in the classification?"
FormulaE,3bern1,NomranaEst,6,Sun Jun 28 20:34:50 2015 UTC,"Immediately hamstringing the car would be a bad idea, in my opinion, even with that light you mention. If Bird had been behind Sarrazin when that sort of system kicked in, no amount of warning would prevent a collision.  I believe that they have enough power to complete another lap at speed, even if they hit the indicated 0%, so they can return to the pits safely. A penalty applied is safer than a car suddenly slowing down on track."
FormulaE,3bern1,The_Rodigan_Scorcher,18,Sun Jun 28 22:46:33 2015 UTC,Congrats Piquet Jr! One of my faves from the start. As a Toyota fan I'm kinda sad for Buemi.

FormulaE,3bern1,Nimr0D14,13,Sun Jun 28 16:00:00 2015 UTC,You're right. They have USABLE energy to avoid a car running out of power which would be a)  dangerous and b) embarrassing for the championship.
FormulaE,3bern1,yesat,10,Sun Jun 28 16:03:52 2015 UTC,"I suspect it's like the fuel regs in F1. You can use a certain amount and no more, but the cars actually have more than that amount for other reason."

FormulaE,3bern1,bouncebackability,2,Sun Jun 28 16:10:00 2015 UTC,"Think of it as a fuel use limit. Imagine that you can fit slightly more than 100 kg of fuel in an F1 fuel tank, but the regs state that you can't use that much. If you go over that limit, even though your car doesn't stop, you've broken the rules, and need to be punished accordingly (in F1's case, by exclusion).

Lots of action, lots of speed. Obviously Bird monstering Sarrazin was great to watch and really got the local crowd going.

FormulaE,3bern1,Underscore_Blues,9,Sun Jun 28 15:56:57 2015 UTC,"Nah, disagree. People thought Glock let Hamilton through in 08 straight after the race and it turned out to be bollocks."
FormulaE,3bern1,cooperjones2,5,Sun Jun 28 16:04:35 2015 UTC,Not really. Duran tried to turn in when he spotted Piquet. I guess Duran was lifting and coasting and got caught out.
FormulaE,3bern1,DHChemist,3,Sun Jun 28 16:04:29 2015 UTC,Right now in an interview with Fox LATAM Durán said that he took the corner really bad and that Piquet won the position cleanly. If he tried a move surely they would have crashed.    Edit: Spelling.
FormulaE,3bern1,Coaster5307,3,Sun Jun 28 16:09:10 2015 UTC,"To be fair though he's never going to come out and say he let him through. Alex Brundle and Jolyon Palmer afterwards have both said it looked too easy. Still, would have been irrelevant if Buemi hadn't spun, so I don't think you can really scapegoat anyone."
FormulaE,3bern1,himmatsj,0,Sun Jun 28 16:32:08 2015 UTC,Gotta agree with you. Piquet made that move look real easy. Not much of defence from Duran.

FormulaE,3bezgj,Wacotacoflaco,12,Sun Jun 28 16:56:04 2015 UTC,"I don't udnerstand this. There is an exact same rule in F1. Once you use a limited amount of ""energy"" to power the car, you get a penalty (100 kg in F1 and some amount in FE )."
FormulaE,3bezgj,RomanCessna,10,Sun Jun 28 20:01:06 2015 UTC,To make it worse the penalty for exceeding your fuel allowance in F1 is straight-up exclusion. Not a time penalty. You're fucking out.
FormulaE,3bezgj,NomranaEst,5,Sun Jun 28 20:14:19 2015 UTC,"Part of it is probably how badly it's be explained. Equating it to the 100kg of fuel F1 cars can carry, plus 1 litre they are required to provide to the scrutineers, is the way to do it, as you say.  It just isn't explained like that in the broadcasts I've watched though, so that may be where the confusion and outrage is coming from."
FormulaE,3bezgj,NomranaEst,12,Sun Jun 28 20:07:10 2015 UTC,A professional motorsport journalist should not be confused about basic fuel consumption rules that damn near every motorsport has in place.
FormulaE,3bezgj,TweetPoster,5,Sun Jun 28 20:10:09 2015 UTC,Very true. Not disagreeing with you there.
FormulaE,3bezgj,keirdre,3,Sun Jun 28 20:11:55 2015 UTC,@adamcooperF1:   2015-06-28 15:55:48 UTC  So @Steph_Sarrazin wins in Battersea but gets demoted to 15th for using all his energy. And people complain about F1 penalties...     [Mistake?] [Suggestion] [FAQ] [Code] [Issues]
FormulaE,3bezgj,andrew2209,14,Sun Jun 28 16:56:56 2015 UTC,"The silliest thing is this comes on the heels of about 3,563 posts he made trying to sort out the grid penalties at the last F1 race, half of which had to be corrected because they'd been figured wrong.  Yes, people complain about F1 penalties. Why? Because they're fucking stupid. You run out of fuel, you get penalized. Pretty fucking straightforward, mate."
FormulaE,3bezgj,JimmerUK,9,Sun Jun 28 17:01:40 2015 UTC,Agreed. I totally understand why the rule is in place. If he'd have suddenly slowed and Bird had plowed into the back of him it would have been embarrassing for the technology. He should have managed his energy better.
FormulaE,3bezgj,Badoit1778,5,Sun Jun 28 17:11:50 2015 UTC,"Not just embarassing, downright dangerous. The speed difference could've seen Bird's car propelled into the air.   Also, I think the batteries may become damaged if they do fully discharge."
FormulaE,3bezgj,Streelydan,5,Sun Jun 28 18:04:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think the percentage is total battery power that exists, only what's available by the rules. There's enough left after '0%' to get them another lap, they're not totally draining the battery."
FormulaE,3bezgj,Badoit1778,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:01:05 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Also I don't think battery power is measurable like fuel is in kg's. But they can measure whats been used so at 0 its 0 of what they are allowed to use.  Sure they could cut the power to the car when that happens, but the current penalty system of drive though / time works better from a safety and pr view. Sure cutting the power and having a car stuck on track or a rash would be great for a laugh."

FormulaE,3beucs,captainlag,3,Sun Jun 28 16:47:04 2015 UTC,"Yup. Of course, we had the energy readings on the screen, which made the energy radio messages completely redundant (when the energy graphics weren't malfunctioning that is...). Boggles my mind why they did them."
FormulaE,3beucs,mechanicalgod,2,Sun Jun 28 16:50:54 2015 UTC,I think they were trying to fill the void left by the lack of engine noise. Replace engine noise with people noise?

FormulaE,3beucs,bTrixy,3,Sun Jun 28 21:19:36 2015 UTC,If you see drivers use it for the fastest lap points... Then yes it's very unfair because it enables laptimes the other will never reach. In the end I don't think fanboost is actually necessary.

FormulaE,3beucs,Alborak,5,Mon Jun 29 09:30:38 2015 UTC,I think they need to tweak the minimum pit time rules. There were way too many penalties this year from people trying to time it just right.  I think something like a minimum time from 1 car coming to a complete stop before the other one can start moving might be better.
FormulaE,3beucs,andrew2209,2,Sun Jun 28 17:34:01 2015 UTC,"Minimum pit time in the garage would be a good idea, but by the end of the season most of the teams were getting it timed very well."

FormulaE,3beucs,mechanicalgod,9,Mon Jun 29 21:20:46 2015 UTC,SPOILERS AHEAD  I think the qualifying format needs to be changed as it can be very unfair at the moment. Piquet almost lost the championship because of it starting to rain during his group. Everyone that went before him (Buemi included) had an unfair advantage that he simply couldn't do anything about.  I also agree with you OP. The tracks definitely need to be changed as well.
FormulaE,3beucs,captainlag,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:42:33 2015 UTC,how would you change it?  all cars on track going for quali laps wouldnt work.
FormulaE,3beucs,mechanicalgod,6,Sun Jun 28 16:59:56 2015 UTC,"Well, if you couldn't get all the cars out there for an F1 style quali, do the groups as usual, but then do further groups where, for example, the bottom 3 from each group go into their own group to decide the back of the grid, front 3 from each into a group to decide the front, etc etc. Would take longer, but could be fairer I think?"
FormulaE,3beucs,MBKF1,16,Sun Jun 28 17:08:23 2015 UTC,"What about the way GP2 do Qualifying at Monaco? So split the field into 2 groups of 10, and then the group that has the fastest time goes in the odd numbered grid positions, and the other group in the even. Then if the conditions do dramatically change then they don't lose as much time."
FormulaE,3beucs,mechanicalgod,3,Sun Jun 28 18:10:07 2015 UTC,"Damn, that's a good idea. I never watch the GP2 quali so didn't know about that."
FormulaE,3beucs,BosleyTree,2,Sun Jun 28 18:12:37 2015 UTC,They also do it when series like Formula Three go to smaller tracks where it would be barbaric to have 30 cars on qualifying laps.
FormulaE,3beucs,bouncebackability,2,Mon Jun 29 02:50:21 2015 UTC,that actually makes some sort of sense.
FormulaE,3beucs,djfil007,2,Sun Jun 28 19:33:18 2015 UTC,interesting format... but it might just work for a series like this.
FormulaE,3beucs,LyskTrevise,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:31:45 2015 UTC,"I agree that it needs to be changed, and I would rather see an F1 style qualifying. Groups still, but only the top 2 from each group advances to a further two groups of 5 each, then the top 2 from each of those to a final shoot out. Idk, I just dont like the qualifying atm."

FormulaE,3beucs,tjsr,4,Sun Jun 28 21:51:16 2015 UTC,"The courses need more overtaking opportunities - even if it's just that some of the straights need to be 4-6 meters wider.  A lot of the tracks were really restrictive, and allowed drivers to just park their car in the middle of a straight to prevent passing. Teams could be a bit more consistent and decide whether they're going to keep swapping out drivers, or back a driver for the championship.  There's a very drivers who did 12 races. I haven't seen a single qualifying session all season, and in fact I barely know how qualifying is done for this series.  Part of that is because of the next point There's no coverage in Australia.  I've watched every race on YouTube.  I hope in 2016 they decide to make them available officially, even if they give us a paid channel that we know we'll be able to get qualifying, races etc. Sure, part of their philosophy behind the series is it being green and intended to be inner-city races, but would it hurt them to have one or two races on road circuits (or some better venues?)."

Maybe with two packs per car, and two pitstops. That way while the first pitstop swaps in a pack that was already charged, the second pitstop requires the first pack to be fast charged - pushing that technology so those driving EVs on the road can benefit."

If they go for the multiple motor config. and direct drive (without transmission) the battery pack could be better located for more airflow and weight distribution."
FormulaE,3beucs,andrew2209,2,Tue Jun 30 13:25:04 2015 UTC,"Gearboxes are there for efficiency, it'll be more interesting when awd comes about as the gearboxes have to dissapear. I wonder if we'll see CVT in the near future? I suspect not as direct transmission may well cause it to be skipped.  Batteries too will become modular, hot swapping batteries will very desirable tech for the sport to have.  But it is just an open wheeled sports car still, I'm not sure how different it could be."
FormulaE,3beucs,LyskTrevise,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:50:25 2015 UTC,"I like hearing about a lot of the technical details, for example the amount of energy recovered and used per lap, I don't think they even show the average speed or max speed achieved during a race do they?  I would have liked to see the amount of energy released from the battery increased for season 2. The max race power is being increased to 170kW, but still only 28kwH of energy, the battery can hold 35kwH as far as I know. I don't think we need aero developments for quite some time yet, aero dynamics is pretty well understood* and isn't where FE should be focusing development in my opinion, it will just make the cars harder to follow and hurt the racing.  Hopefully the sport will be really successful and the pace of development can happen quicker than is currently planned, I'd like to see AWD for season 3.  *I know it's sometimes referred to as a dark art but still..."

The typeface is too small, and the team insignia is practically invisible. Indycar's graphics are far superior IMO. It's so hard to get into Formula E when you can't read what's going on. The telemetry graphic was also far too busy; the late season ""battle"" telemetry package was far superior.   I'll echo what others have said about circuit design. I get that the organizers want road courses, but Battersea was basically a parade route. The circuits need to be wider with fewer single-file choke points.   Finally, I'll stick up for FanBoost. Is it gimmicky?  Yeah but the same argument can be made for DRS, or PTP.  I thought it was an interesting innovation and I hope they continue it.   That said, bring on some constructor warfare.

FormulaE,3beedo,williamthebloody1880,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:36:49 2015 UTC,haha just seems odd that a global championship wouldn't be shown on youtube in america. they came here after all

FormulaE,3beedo,Thalass,4,Sun Jun 28 15:30:48 2015 UTC,Buemi obviously decided the title race just wasn't exciting enough...
FormulaE,3beedo,NomranaEst,3,Sun Jun 28 15:32:56 2015 UTC,"Having watched this race with only the on-board footage from Formula E and the scoreboard... I never realised how vital commentators were. Is it possible to buy a proper season pass to all the races from FE, like you can with MotoGP? If so I'm doing that for next season."
FormulaE,3beedo,Thalass,3,Sun Jun 28 15:57:28 2015 UTC,"Depends where you are. It's usually streamed on YouTube and the Formula E website, or shown on TV. No need to pay for it."
FormulaE,3beedo,NomranaEst,3,Sun Jun 28 15:59:10 2015 UTC,Yeah the livestream on youtube isn't available in Canada. :/

FormulaE,3beedo,williamthebloody1880,3,Sun Jun 28 15:51:16 2015 UTC,2 cars hit 0% battery which means something apparently.

FormulaE,3beedo,blackbasset,3,Sun Jun 28 15:51:58 2015 UTC,"So, what does 0% energy really mean?"
FormulaE,3beedo,Thalass,4,Sun Jun 28 15:52:09 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, there is some backup energy left after 0% so the cars don't stop in the middle of the track"
FormulaE,3beedo,captainlag,3,Sun Jun 28 15:53:47 2015 UTC,"I think they have allocated a certain amount of energy (in kWh, I suppose) to each car. The battery might be capable of delivering 100kWh, but the race only allows 80kWh to be used for the race."
FormulaE,3beedo,jonray,2,Sun Jun 28 15:55:29 2015 UTC,"same as F1, you can use 100kg of fuel, from lights out to finish, but of course they have more fuel/energy to get them back to the pits etc."
FormulaE,3beedo,RoelTM,3,Sun Jun 28 16:01:51 2015 UTC,Does the grid move up though? Does Buemi win by this?
FormulaE,3beedo,jonray,3,Sun Jun 28 15:53:52 2015 UTC,"No, both Buemi and Piquet gain 2 points"
FormulaE,3beedo,tarrach,2,Sun Jun 28 15:54:57 2015 UTC,OK thanks! Got a bit confusing there.
FormulaE,3beedo,RoelTM,2,Sun Jun 28 15:55:33 2015 UTC,But what if Duval also gets a DT?
FormulaE,3beedo,tarrach,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:55:49 2015 UTC,"Then they both gain 2 points again. Gap to 3rd place is 3 points, so that would be enough for Buemi to win"
FormulaE,3beedo,NomranaEst,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:57:34 2015 UTC,Ok
FormulaE,3beedo,blackbasset,5,Sun Jun 28 15:59:26 2015 UTC,That last lap. I think I forgot how to breath there.

FormulaE,3beedo,blackbasset,2,Sun Jun 28 14:41:43 2015 UTC,Explosive starts by Di Grassi and Piquet. Vergne's looking like he's wanting points too.
FormulaE,3beedo,Sinister-D-,2,Sun Jun 28 15:05:53 2015 UTC,Only now I noticed how colorful those cars are. I really like that
FormulaE,3beedo,blackbasset,5,Sun Jun 28 15:06:25 2015 UTC,"Indeed those cars are very flashy, some a bit cheesy, but most are very cool liveries!"
FormulaE,3beedo,blackbasset,2,Sun Jun 28 15:09:47 2015 UTC,"In every case, better than the 50 shades of grey that F1 currently is..."
FormulaE,3beedo,Osakaboy,2,Sun Jun 28 15:11:29 2015 UTC,I still think a little bit of rain might spice things up
FormulaE,3beedo,Thalass,2,Sun Jun 28 15:08:10 2015 UTC,Trulli. You are too old/slow. Time to quit I think.
FormulaE,3beedo,Thalass,2,Sun Jun 28 15:25:07 2015 UTC,What happened to Sarrazin?
FormulaE,3beedo,Nickp1991,2,Sun Jun 28 15:26:14 2015 UTC,Oh wait. Car swap time. I'm watching the on-board no-commentary feed and the scoreboard. lol

FormulaE,3beedo,blackbasset,2,Sun Jun 28 15:29:25 2015 UTC,Haha it's a narrow track but there have been some great overtakes this race
FormulaE,3beedo,captainlag,3,Sun Jun 28 15:32:09 2015 UTC,"Also, yesterdays race"
FormulaE,3beedo,AhoyTelephone,2,Sun Jun 28 15:34:25 2015 UTC,"turvey, slow down like 10 seconds :P"
FormulaE,3beedo,blackbasset,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:31:14 2015 UTC,surely turvey will let him through if it means piquet wins the championship
FormulaE,3beedo,NomranaEst,2,Sun Jun 28 15:34:09 2015 UTC,NOOO SAFETY CAR
FormulaE,3beedo,binks21,2,Sun Jun 28 15:34:35 2015 UTC,Qualcomm Safety Car deployed. Why do they take so fucking long about it...
FormulaE,3beedo,captainlag,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:34:40 2015 UTC,yes. I was wondering this too. seemed like it got deployed a fair amount of time after that crash.
FormulaE,3beedo,keirdre,2,Sun Jun 28 15:40:41 2015 UTC,"again, wayyyyy too slow with the SC...."
FormulaE,3beedo,prowler760,2,Sun Jun 28 15:34:44 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, this is nicely poised. Piquet can still do this with FL and Turvey help."
FormulaE,3beedo,ThemDangVidyaGames,2,Sun Jun 28 15:37:03 2015 UTC,When the Safety Car comes in it will be flat-out racing to the finish line and some intense last laps.
FormulaE,3beedo,blackbasset,2,Sun Jun 28 15:37:16 2015 UTC,This is gonna get interesting.
FormulaE,3beedo,HAV0C33,2,Sun Jun 28 15:37:31 2015 UTC,WTF? PANORAMA SHOTS IN THAT PHASE? IS THE DIRECTOR DRUNK?!
FormulaE,3beedo,dj88masterchief,2,Sun Jun 28 15:38:38 2015 UTC,Nice bird
FormulaE,3beedo,Nickp1991,2,Sun Jun 28 15:40:11 2015 UTC,"How fast are they going on the front stretch? It's seems crazy to hold a race in a park, but pretty cool too."
FormulaE,3beedo,Zackman558,2,Sun Jun 28 15:40:27 2015 UTC,"Great move from Bird, Turvey's having a good race"

FormulaE,3beedo,Zackman558,2,Sun Jun 28 15:47:14 2015 UTC,It will be a last lap move from Bird.
FormulaE,3beedo,NomranaEst,2,Sun Jun 28 15:48:35 2015 UTC,Senna helping Brazil out!
FormulaE,3beedo,Thalass,2,Sun Jun 28 15:49:24 2015 UTC,"Sarrazin given 49 second time penalty for exceeding energy usage. Bird now declared winner, both Dragon cars 2nd and 3rd."

FormulaE,3beedo,Skelenal,2,Sun Jun 28 15:55:52 2015 UTC,"Jesus. I've had a lot of alcohol today but I know an epic season-finisher when I see one.   Let's hope this gets stuck on ITV next season, I'd take this kind of racing over Formula 1 any day."
FormulaE,3beedo,LyskTrevise,2,Sun Jun 28 18:49:00 2015 UTC,"Did Sarrazin get the penalty for getting down to 0%?   Because if he did surely Duval will get a penalty too, would that mean Buemi's won?  EDIT: It wouldn't be enough for Buemi to win, but if that is what Sarrazin got the penalty for then they've not penalised Duval for the exact same offense."
FormulaE,3beedo,Skelenal,2,Sun Jun 28 15:55:23 2015 UTC,Duval crossed the line with 2% remaining.
FormulaE,3beedo,monoWench,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:12:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I rewatched and saw that, I was sure  I saw him with 0% on the last lap but obviously I was wrong, I don't think I've had any problems with the small graphics until now. Not that it would have made a difference to the championship anyway, I was wrong about that as well."
FormulaE,3beedo,AhoyTelephone,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:11:50 2015 UTC,An interesting grid for the championship decider. Anything could yet happen
FormulaE,3beedo,Skelenal,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:53:34 2015 UTC,"having not really followed FE this season, can someone run through the basic permutations for the championship?"
FormulaE,3beedo,HAV0C33,2,Sun Jun 28 14:16:11 2015 UTC,"Piquet's on 138 with Buemi on 133 and di Grassi on 125. Buemi's starting 6th, with di Grassi 11th and Piquet 16th.   Buemi's the favourite now but it will be interesting to watch the other two try and advance through the field because it's a pretty tight track."
FormulaE,3beedo,prowler760,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:34:54 2015 UTC,Did the stream start?
FormulaE,3beedo,keirdre,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:23:48 2015 UTC,"With only 13 points separating the top 3, I would dislike if this race becomes a anti-climax during the first lap."
FormulaE,3beedo,referculture,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:28:39 2015 UTC,-1 then a first lap accident. Those moves won't keep working forever!

FormulaE,3beedo,keirdre,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:00:40 2015 UTC,I still think di Grassi can pull it off!
FormulaE,3beedo,giskkard,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:03:50 2015 UTC,Maybe! Perhaps more likely than Piquet now.
FormulaE,3beedo,NomranaEst,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:53:36 2015 UTC,"I missed the Qually,  Why is Piquet starting so low in the grid?"
FormulaE,3beedo,blackbasset,2,Sun Jun 28 14:59:51 2015 UTC,Rain came down hard when the last two groups were out. Became a session of who can get 11th.
FormulaE,3beedo,keirdre,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:54:47 2015 UTC,"So. I'm rooting for Buemi, after that great work he did yesterday."
FormulaE,3beedo,blackbasset,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:56:56 2015 UTC,Looking good so far. Just got FL too.
FormulaE,3beedo,blackbasset,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:59:04 2015 UTC,Now its getting exciting
FormulaE,3beedo,binks21,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:22:18 2015 UTC,Who would be Champion right now? They need to show that points table more often
FormulaE,3beedo,blackbasset,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:28:32 2015 UTC,Piquet? he just gained a position
FormulaE,3beedo,DaleyT,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:32:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, and it was a possibly championship deciding pass"

FormulaE,3beedo,Sinister-D-,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:45:12 2015 UTC,Gutted. I had £20 on Sarrazin to win at 33/1. Skybet didn't update their odds after qualifying..

FormulaE,3beedo,robotmlg,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:13:58 2015 UTC,"I was not talking about the cause of the accident itself, should have made that clearer... the problem was, that the track was nearly blocked with the cars of Yamamoto und Trulli going slow."
FormulaE,3beedo,giskkard,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:15:55 2015 UTC,Why would Turvey set fastest lap when Piquet needs it?
FormulaE,3beedo,Diactylmorphinefiend,5,Sun Jun 28 15:16:47 2015 UTC,Just to take the points from Buemi
FormulaE,3beedo,Sinister-D-,4,Sun Jun 28 15:40:47 2015 UTC,To steal it from Buemi.
FormulaE,3beedo,Diactylmorphinefiend,-2,Sun Jun 28 15:41:47 2015 UTC,Race fan here but not formula e. Whats different from gas engine racing?
FormulaE,3beedo,tarrach,2,Sun Jun 28 15:42:27 2015 UTC,The batteries....
FormulaE,3beedo,NomranaEst,-2,Sun Jun 28 15:04:54 2015 UTC,no shit. What I meant was do they have to conserve the battery? Do they run slower as time goes on like my RC car? Do they fail like gas engines do occasionally?
FormulaE,3beedo,yesat,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:10:08 2015 UTC,"They don't slow as the battery empties, or rather they go into slow mode once the battery is empty enough, so they swap cars before that happens.  The engines can of course fail, but not as spectacularly as combustion engines"

FormulaE,3ber6x,27629,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:36:10 2015 UTC,They did say 1:19 in the first race somewhere. So i guess it was the same in the second race and the commentators just made a mistake.

In the Team Championship, it would move Audi Sport ABT into 2nd place, at Dragon Racing's expense, as Berlin was a fantastic finish for Dragon, while Audi Sport ABT got no points from that race.

FormulaE,3bbe2j,RWPROfficial,12,Sat Jun 27 16:33:28 2015 UTC,Branson talks some amount of shite.
FormulaE,3bbe2j,gufcfan,25,Sat Jun 27 19:19:16 2015 UTC,"With all respect: but thats a dumb thought. And there are more reasons than 1:  1) Although he is completly right that electrical vehicals are the future, but for the opportunity viewer motorracing should be loud. Lots of F1 viewers hate the idea that these cars aren't as loud as they want or expect it to be. The oppurtunity viewer can't make the difference between most racing series, and don't understand the idea behind F.E  2) FIA never ever would let Formula E become bigger than their goose with golden eggs F1. History tells us FIA never lets a competiting race-series of their own organisation become bigger than F1:  World Sportscar Championship (WEC  predecessor till '92) was the second biggest series next to F1 andwas rapidly becoming popular. So FIA let it collapse by forcing to much rules. When their ACO's sportscar serie became very popular, FIA merged with it. But that last bit is food for another topic ;)  3) do not forget the power of oil companies!   It would take a change of thought and more open-mindness for this to become the pinnacle of motorsports or at least to become bigger than F1. And that is not going to happen within 5 years.  Don't get me wrong, I like the city-centre circuit ideas, I love the close racing. And although it took me 2 or 3 races, I actually like the sound! Only thing thats a bit odd (to say fake) is the fanboost, but thats just a way to get social media involded. I can't wait till real constructors get involded and this serie to get or make a real revolution in the electric car business."
FormulaE,3bbe2j,Sinister-D-,2,Sat Jun 27 18:20:15 2015 UTC,"1) Motor racing also used to be deadly, and that was a big attraction for casual viewers at the time too. I don't doubt that fans enjoy loud engines when they're there, but I've yet to hear convincing argument that noise is a non-negotiable cornerstone of mainstream motor racing.  2) Electric racing is too unique to prevent it from growing simply through politics. If corporations really want to put more money into FE than F1 then the FIA would be foolish to try and squash it - the marketing value is very clearly not interchangeable.  3) Oil companies themselves don't spend nearly as much in F1 as car manufacturers. Now the oil companies might be working very hard to keep the auto industry burning oil, but if consumer electric cars take off in a big way then oil money will count for very little.  5 years is certainly an outlandish prediction, no doubt intentionally made for shock value, but to predict the future of FE you have to be right about the future of technology and the future of economics - which really makes it foolish to rule anything out."
FormulaE,3bbe2j,WKHR,3,Sat Jun 27 21:29:51 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt that fans enjoy loud engines when they're there, but I've yet to hear convincing argument that noise is a non-negotiable cornerstone of mainstream motor racing.   I've always held the personal opinion that wanting loud engines is simply an evolution thing. People want the cars to be like riding a lion, growling louder the harder you whip it. It's just a primal instinct that invokes a strong feeling of dominance within us. The further we move away from those primal interests, the less loud noise becomes relevant. For the record, I love loud engines as much as anyone but I hold respect for the FE cars because they sound like spaceships and nobody can doubt that this technology is pretty sci-fi esque in it's approach.   5 years is certainly an outlandish prediction, no doubt intentionally made for shock value, but to predict the future of FE you have to be right about the future of technology and the future of economics - which really makes it foolish to rule anything out.   To be fair the Richard Branson, he is involved in business AND he's involved in a rapidly growing, developing and innovating industry with Virgin Media, not to mention the hundreds of side projects Virgin group sponsors and runs itself. If anybody in the current Formula E umbrella is going to make predictions about what it will be like in the future, he's better than any of us mere mortals.  It's also true what you say about shock value. I really believe the statement ""there's no such thing as bad publicity"" and whilst it might be a generalised statement that has it's flaws, unless you ruin the planet or kill large swathes of organisms, bad publicity really isn't that much of a problem. People will call it a bold statement but those same people will be eager to hang around and see if his prediction comes true. 5 years is a short time scale and I honestly think he's being a little ambitious with it but with F1's decline recently, I can't imagine it being much more than 10-20 before they are almost on par. Especially if FE keeps embracing fans while F1 abandons them."
FormulaE,3bbe2j,mastican42,9,Mon Jun 29 13:07:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe by 2040/2050, but then FE will be F1"
FormulaE,3bbe2j,kickinsticks,6,Sat Jun 27 19:17:41 2015 UTC,"Exactly, they'll merge eventually. F1 cars are already hybrids. FE is more to spur electric development, not be a flagship series."
FormulaE,3bbe2j,wtfamireadingdotjpg,6,Sun Jun 28 05:17:36 2015 UTC,"Unless there's a major advance in battery tech that allows uber fast charging and/or multiple times of power density there's no way that could happen as soon as 2020.  But at least I want to see soon a better chassi, direct drive and  more speed. Today's car seem much more like an adaptation on ICE chassi than one that was built around the advantages/necessities that an electric motor offer."
FormulaE,3bbe2j,sibuzaru_k,2,Sat Jun 27 19:15:18 2015 UTC,I still reckon a Tesla battery swap style pit stop would be the best option till batteries can last race distance.
FormulaE,3bbe2j,Lagahan,2,Sun Jun 28 00:40:37 2015 UTC,"It was considered, but ultimately ruled unsafe I think, due to the weight of the battery packs."
FormulaE,3bbe2j,andrew2209,2,Sun Jun 28 09:31:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the battery is currently so big that you'd need a fork lift to swap them.  Also, FIA regs mean that, at the moment, they have to be sealed into place."
FormulaE,3bbe2j,williamthebloody1880,2,Sun Jun 28 13:46:53 2015 UTC,"Or development of some sort of on contact, fast charging points. Though the development for that will probably be after some sort of fast swapping mechanism.  It's also worth not ruling out the speed with which race distance with one battery can be achieved. As efficiency, charge deployment and motor size varies as well as cooling ability, a single car for the whole race could be achievable sooner than we think. Quite equally it could be ages.  I think once we reach that one charge for a whole race idea, the economics of battery saving will become very interesting. Fuel has a weight (mass) payoff between rate of combustion and mass of fuel loaded and consequent speed of the vehicle. Electric charge in a battery has next to no variable mass over the course of time so that may end up causing batteries to be smaller. This is where I can anticipate rapid charging or battery swaps, until technology improves again on top of that."

FormulaE,3bbe2j,djfil007,5,Sat Jun 27 18:58:48 2015 UTC,Electric motors are ultra efficient. A Formula E motor is around 90% efficient.
FormulaE,3bbe2j,iso700c,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:32:45 2015 UTC,Fe will be bigger than F1 when its faster than F1. Currently the lap time of an F1 car is 1:50 around Spa and the Fe car is.. eh.. ok it ran out of juice before the end so..   maybe 2030?

FormulaE,3bbe2j,crabmoon,3,Sat Jun 27 17:38:56 2015 UTC,"It won't be by 2020 that's for sure. Main thing is, F1 will eventually be all electric if the manufacturers continue to dictate the way the engines go as we'll all be in electric cars at some point. A long way off yet though. So FE won't be more popular that F1, instead F1 will be FE but with (by then) better tech."
FormulaE,3bbe2j,Nimr0D14,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:08:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's very true, there's no reason why f1 would fade away, just merge the two  together"
FormulaE,3bbe2j,crabmoon,1 point,Sun Jun 28 11:27:25 2015 UTC,"You could look at it the other way and say that F1 will collapse on itself before 2020 and therefor Formule E will be bigger. Even Tho I do think the first season was very good, a few more of those good seasons are needed to actually create a solid fanbase to even let Formule E become more then a Gimmick. So in general if FE still exists and has manufacturer backing by 2020 it would be a victory on itself."

A lot of these circuits would be fine if only the circuits could be made 12-14m wide in some places."

FormulaE,3bbw1p,italicBus,3,Sat Jun 27 19:11:14 2015 UTC,"I can only speak from my experience today and I can't guarantee that wherever you plan to view the racing from will be the same as where I watched it from (Stand 22, on Turn 13).   I would definitely advise getting there pretty early (I got there fairly early, 9:30ish) as it gives you a chance to get your bearings. It's not a massive area but I found it helpful to find where my stand was, where the nearest toilets were, etc. From where I was sat, there was no big screen so I had no visual on the race apart from when they went through Turn 13, but they gave out free audio earpieces at the entrance on which they provide radio coverage throughout the day, including the commentary you'd get on TV/online with Jack Nicholls and Dario Franchitti. You're probably aware already but I believe that unless you bought one of the expensive tickets, there is no seating. The stands are raised so you can sort of sit down if you want to, though, but you won't see much of the track. I think there are other viewing areas from around the track but there's no banking or anything like that and you can't get particularly close to the edge of the track so again, you probably won't be able to see a great deal. Food offerings and facilities are more or less as you would expect from an event like this - there are various food vans around the track and there are a ton of portaloos. As for track crossings, I didn't have any particular problems (as far as I could tell we could go over whenever we wanted), but I only really saw the areas of the track near where I was stood so I don't know if it's the same all over - we crossed over a bridge to go inside/outside of the track, I don't know if other parts you have to walk across the track itself. Finally, the signposting around the track is not great. There's a map in the programme which you can buy at the entry gate (£8 each if I remember correctly) which is sort of useful but it is easy to lose track of where you are, fortunately there's a ton of marshals around and they're all incredibly helpful and can point you in the right direction. Also none of the stands were numbered today (I kind of imagine they'll do something about that tomorrow) so chances are you'll need to ask a marshal which stand is which.   There's not much else aside from that but if you have any other questions feel free to ask :)"
FormulaE,3bbw1p,Alexcadrill,3,Sat Jun 27 20:03:39 2015 UTC,"All here is accurate. Can only cross via bridges unless in wheelchair.  Signposting was shoddy for us British, we usually are better at event organising.  If you want an official program, they are £10 and are found at THE ENTRANCES!! Not inside! Look for pink tent / pink dressed lady."
FormulaE,3bbw1p,aaranprasher,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:55:11 2015 UTC,"Huh, that's weird, I got mine for £8. But yeah, I should've been clearer, on the outside of the entrance, although I think they'll let you go back out and back in again."
FormulaE,3bbw1p,Alexcadrill,2,Sat Jun 27 20:58:27 2015 UTC,Right. Must vary between gates XD all these volunteers were as clueless as me haha. We are all FE virigins
FormulaE,3bbw1p,aaranprasher,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:00:42 2015 UTC,"This post is great, really detailed. Thought I'd just add my experience with the bridges, since I was at grandstand 21 on the inside of the track. I left the grandstand just before the end of the cool down lap and the queue for the bridge to leave was a catastrophe, since they were still letting people in for some daft reason. I was lucky enough to be on the closest grandstand to the bridge, so don't leave it too late or I could easily see it taking over half an hour to leave the track."
FormulaE,3bbw1p,twotonwhale,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:58:34 2015 UTC,Lots of us were crossing in to see the podium. I was in stand 22 crossing the bridge into the circuit and was shocked there were so many people crossing to the outside of the track. I can only assume people did not know the podium was in the evillage
FormulaE,3bbw1p,hpoom,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:02:19 2015 UTC,"It's a long walk from the grandstands, let alone the bridge. Takes at least 10 mins at best, so it's unlikely you would get there in time. One of the reasons I didn't try to go."
FormulaE,3bbw1p,twotonwhale,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:30:39 2015 UTC,"I missed the 1st place  trophy, but made it in time for 2nd and 3rd. Was almost 15min walk from stand 22"

FormulaE,3bbw1p,hpoom,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:03:25 2015 UTC,but they gave out free audio earpieces at the entrance on which they provide radio coverage throughout the day   I did wonder what they were when I saw people wearing them during qualifying
FormulaE,3bbw1p,williamthebloody1880,3,Sun Jun 28 14:53:29 2015 UTC,"I was unreserved standing zone b today. In general it was quite badly organised - hopefully these will be better tomorrow. When I arrived zone b didn't exist - it had been completely gated off and none of the staff knew it existed. There were massive queues for food at lunch - I waited ages at a pie van, only to find they had run out of pies! Also, none of the cash machines or card payment machines seemed to work (ironically for an event sponsored by visa). I was down by turns 8&9 - there's a big bump that the cars were kicking up sparks over. The radio earpieces are free.  Anything you want to know, just ask!"
FormulaE,3bbw1p,CoastOfYemen,2,Sat Jun 27 20:28:42 2015 UTC,"It was alright. I think they really need to up the content though. If I go to Donington I get a race every 15 to 20 mins and while I realise because to their location and the fact it's a new series it is something that they need to work on.   Food was OK but the queues were huge. I had a beef rib roll and it was £10. I also bought 2 ice creams and 2 bottles of coke and that was £12 so a little pricey but not overall too bad for a captive audience in London. They need to sort the organisation out as leaving was a nightmare.   Getting there was a bit crap, closed car parks and tube lines not running from where we came in, but once you hit the tube they had instructions up and they were OK to follow.   Track crossing is fine they had bridges. I was worried about it too but we just crossed and it looked like people were crossing whenever they liked."
FormulaE,3bbw1p,BigHowski,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:02:21 2015 UTC,"The most important thing is to get one of the free radio earpieces from the eVillage.    If I was going to do it again I would consider watching the qualifying from somewhere near the track (it was good to see/hear the cars live), and then watch the actual race on the big screen in the eVillage - I saw one of the stands had a screen but if you don't have one then I feel like you miss out on a lot.    The eVillage is good, there's plenty to wander around and look at.    The marshals didn't have a clue what was going on.    I watched the qualifying, left the park and then came back later for the race.  I wouldn't worry about getting there really early."
FormulaE,3bbw1p,funkmasterflex,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:35:46 2015 UTC,"I went today, and had a great time.   We had grandstand tickets (Raised platform with no seating) just before the chicane for T14. We spent maybe two laps there because if you walk further down you'll reach the chicane itself. It's a great overtaking spot and there's a huge gap in the fence so you can see everything perfectly. Here's one of a million photos I took today. (I can upload an album if you're interested). I met / high fived all the drivers by chance really. The drivers do come out for a press conference / autograph signing but the queues can be mental. I happened to walk up to the platform where they were about half an hour before they were due to arrive. If you head to the right hand side of the platform right to the back (near an xbox one), it's the entrance for them all to walk on to the platform. If you're not so fussed about getting an autograph, this is a great quick way to meet them all.    Also, we had no issued crossing any of the track and we didn't get to the venue until about 11:00 and still found a great place to watch qualifying.   Let me know if you have any more questions!"
FormulaE,3bbw1p,eb28,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:38:08 2015 UTC,Thanks for the tip about the drivers! I didn't get to talk to or high five them because they were rushed away so quickly but it was brilliant to see them all so close!
FormulaE,3bbw1p,RobDeeJay,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:53:08 2015 UTC,No worries! Glad you got to see them - much easier than queueing for ages. I took a video of all the drivers walking past / high fiving haha!
FormulaE,3bbw1p,eb28,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:17:41 2015 UTC,"I was a little disappointed that they didn't have a screen at the platform I'd bought a ticket for, so I actually watched most of the race at the eVillage, and dashed over the track every now and then."
FormulaE,3bbw1p,rubzo,1 point,Sun Jun 28 03:02:50 2015 UTC,"I was on stand 18, there was a screen there (great for practice) , there wasnt one everywhere though, which is a shame as it helped follow it.

FormulaE,3bb8fh,NomranaEst,3,Sat Jun 27 15:58:38 2015 UTC,"Mixed reaction to this race. Some parts of the track really flattered the cars, some just showed off how bad a track can be. They're going to have to level off the track to make it a viable choice for the future, as well as widen it a bit.  Racing overall was, again, mixed. Predicted that some moves had to be suicidal to work, and they were.  Still, the Driver's Championship is still to play for. Something to look forward to tomorrow."
FormulaE,3bb8fh,jonray,3,Sat Jun 27 15:58:55 2015 UTC,Not too many changes but I felt the tension. Its going to be tight. Does anyone here watch qualifying? Is it usually exciting? I'm certain tommorows qualifying will be intense.

FormulaE,3bb8fh,LyskTrevise,2,Sat Jun 27 16:12:31 2015 UTC,"Hi Jonray,  I thought qualifying was okay, but not nearly as exciting as the F1 format. I hope that in the future when the cars can handle it they move to more of a 1-lap qualifying shoot out like formula one has these days. That said, it was decent entertainment if you want to kill some time.   I watched all of the sessions on youtube in 720p HD, and you can find them pretty easily by typing into the search bar (the ""today"" bit specifies to filter by uploads from today only):  ""Formula E [Race location] [Session], hd, long, today ""  So for the London Race it would be:  ""Formula E London Race, hd, long, today""  I have watched almost the entire season using this due to Fox Sports 1 being possibly the worst TV experience I have ever had.

FormulaE,3bameq,DrCake_2580,2,Sat Jun 27 14:44:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I think that's only showing the On Board cameras."
FormulaE,3bameq,vgoldee,2,Sat Jun 27 14:54:19 2015 UTC,"Has anyone gotten this to work today?  Ive had good luck in the past with the official stream, but it's not working for me so far today.  (in the U.S.)  (edit):  The stream is now working, but I can only get the 4 on boards.  The 'main' stream doesn't show up.  Curios if others are seeing the same thing."
FormulaE,3bameq,loki1725,2,Sat Jun 27 14:56:48 2015 UTC,Yeah I think that's all that's available for US viewers since Fox owns rights to show the race here.  I don't have cable so I guess I'll just torrent it later.

FormulaE,3bataf,jelacy,3,Sat Jun 27 15:17:39 2015 UTC,Because RBR is all about non-sense and short-sighted decision !
FormulaE,3bataf,Leonhart01,13,Sat Jun 27 18:35:30 2015 UTC,"did JEV get the memo that the track is too narrow to overtake, or does he simply not give a fuck?"
FormulaE,3bataf,williamthebloody1880,4,Sat Jun 27 15:20:15 2015 UTC,"JEV has been the highlight of this season. He's bonkers, and can overtake anywhere it seems."
FormulaE,3bataf,keirdre,7,Sat Jun 27 15:36:52 2015 UTC,I'm torn.  Part of me wants him to race the whole of next season.  Part of me hopes he gets another F1 seat

FormulaE,3bataf,HandsomeBadger,5,Sat Jun 27 15:07:04 2015 UTC,"Far too narrow indeed, it's going to be really hard to make moves."
FormulaE,3bataf,Smytr,5,Sat Jun 27 15:10:59 2015 UTC,"Well,  we've actually seen quite a few moves, much to my surprise!"

FormulaE,3bataf,McAndze,2,Sat Jun 27 15:34:26 2015 UTC,"They have a 5 year contract for this race, so it'll be back there (which I don't mind, it's a very picturesque track) but that doesn't necessarily mean the layout will be the same"
FormulaE,3bataf,williamthebloody1880,3,Sat Jun 27 15:43:16 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind having a race there, but the track needs some serious modifications. There are good parts though as well!"
FormulaE,3bataf,McAndze,2,Sat Jun 27 15:45:14 2015 UTC,"It's like a lot of stuff in FE this season, a learning curve.  As was proven when they adjusted the first corner after practice.  (Having watched the footage, i'm not surprised.  The cars aren't built to literally fly.)  It's probably too late to do anything before tomorrow but there will be changes next year, i'd imagine."
FormulaE,3bataf,williamthebloody1880,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:56:21 2015 UTC,Just needs to be a little wider in some spots to make overtaking more lucrative and some parts need to be smoothed over a bit - it looks extremely bumpy.

FormulaE,3bataf,williamthebloody1880,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:54:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, hopefully once the cars get better batteries, we may see less chicanes at this track to aid with overtaking. Same with all the other tracks as well. Maybe we'll get longer tracks as well which would be interesting!"
FormulaE,3bataf,McPhilen,2,Sat Jun 27 21:17:51 2015 UTC,"JEV spices things up a little bit, but the track is absolutely horrible. They need to stop making tracks with so much chicanes"
FormulaE,3bataf,Saviix,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:44:30 2015 UTC,"IIRC, the reason for all the chicanes is for energy management.  As things improve to that end on the cars, there won't be the need for them"
FormulaE,3bataf,williamthebloody1880,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:04:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah looking forward to that, but i guess it should be possible to make tracks with less chicanes but with more u turns? We're it is easier to get onto the inside line and overtake there."
FormulaE,3bataf,Saviix,2,Sat Jun 27 16:06:09 2015 UTC,"One of the issues with street circuits.  If you put u turns in that course, it'd limit it to one lane for racing, completely eliminating the chances for overtaking."

FormulaE,3bataf,McAndze,2,Sat Jun 27 15:44:30 2015 UTC,"I think the old one clashed with Trulli a bit too much, like Dragon and Venturi clash a little too much now. Or maybe it was Trulli who clashed with Andretti, who knows.  I heard that the new one was because of Simone's sponsorship, so if she races for the team next season it may be the same."

FormulaE,3bataf,blackbasset,3,Sat Jun 27 14:54:12 2015 UTC,did I hear right that they are starting behind the safety car? If so then why?
FormulaE,3bataf,SkiStig,8,Sat Jun 27 14:53:34 2015 UTC,"The first corner has been narrowed significantly, due to some very nasty bumps on the apex. They put up a temporary barrier, but now that part of the track is pretty much one car wide.  Obviously, at the start, it isn't an ideal thing."
FormulaE,3bataf,NomranaEst,3,Sat Jun 27 14:57:35 2015 UTC,"Ahh okay, that makes sense, thanks for the explanation :)"

FormulaE,3bataf,keirdre,3,Sat Jun 27 15:38:12 2015 UTC,To have three title contenders going in to the final race is probably just one of the things the organizers wished for during this inaugural season. It will be a showdown tomorrow.

FormulaE,3ba87q,silentalarm_,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:46:14 2015 UTC,The Monaco bump is on a straight. The London bump is on the racing line and anything up to a second could be lost by having to go slower and further wide (also effecting exit into Turn 2).
FormulaE,3ba87q,kickinsticks,1 point,Sat Jun 27 07:57:27 2015 UTC,"It's the exact same scenario as Monaco, they avoid the bump so they don't wreak the car, not because it's quicker, from wikipedia ""The cars snake down Avenue des Beaux Arts, the next short straight, avoiding an enormous bump on the left of the track, a reminder of the unique nature of the circuit.""

FormulaE,3b5qc5,timix,2,Fri Jun 26 09:01:42 2015 UTC,Here's why the spoiler rule is a good thing:  Reddit is an aggregate website and the frontpage I see is relevant to my interests but beyond that there is no filtering. I have the intelligence to avoid specific subreddits when I know I'm not going to be able to watch the races live but reddit is set to open on my browser by default and sometimes I just plain forget that there'll be content from subreddits I'd rather avoid for the day on the frontpage.
FormulaE,3b5qc5,timix,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:14:22 2015 UTC,What changes will you make to the spoiler rules? I left /r/formula1 after getting heckled and actually abused for questioning the lack of rules and trying to improve things for those who don't get to watch the races live.
FormulaE,3b5qc5,ApocApollo,3,Fri Jun 26 09:14:29 2015 UTC,"Really depends on how the community feels about them. The spoiler rule was brought in to begin with because of how new the series was and the lack of coverage on national television.  I mean, if it turns out that we as a whole want to keep the spoiler rule next time of asking, then we'll keep it.  If I'm honest, after the first few rounds of questioning it, I think a lot of people accept it as the norm now.  But this may change in season 2, so it'll be down to everyone here to decide that. Maybe nothing will change, maybe everything will, who knows.  I find it easier to just ask people here what they want, it's quite nice."

Its caused him at least 1 DNF (from the lead?) and many more positions besides. Lucas also complained heavily about the car overheating after the last race too. I hope that they get that ironed out at least so that drivers can push as long as they have the energy to do so. The last thing this series needs is more nursing of the cars by the drivers. I feel like we got robbed of a fight for the lead and possibly the championship because of overheating last race.
FormulaE,3b3asf,sibuzaru_k,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:27:52 2015 UTC,"Possibly, though racing drivers like to blame their cars and it was pretty unlikely di Grassi was going to get past Piquet on that circuit on that day.

FormulaE,3b29oj,Korbars,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:55:50 2015 UTC,"They have to figure out, how to make these tracks more interesting while the cars have such a low range.   These chicanes are probably only there to make the cars go a little bit longer, more energy recovery and less flat out parts. But in terms of racing, it is pretty boring, as we seen last round. Every time someone tried to overtake at the chicane the other one had to cut it avoid an incident.   And again far too narrow, its hard to even fit two cars side by side, how should the overtake each other.   I like the Idea of this ""bring racing to the people"" concept, but most of these city circuits are just boring and lack identity."

FormulaE,3b3dfr,kickinsticks,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:34:22 2015 UTC,"Well, the current electric motor being used now is the same motor found powering the McLaren P1, and while it isn't the most powerful motor, per kilogram of mass the motor produces more watts than any other motor on the planet. We know that in formula one, a few kilograms can be equivalent to a few tenths per lap, so weight is a major consideration.  However, more concerning I think for Formula E right now is efficiency. The teams will have a good idea of the current motor's efficiency, and they will be out to improve on the efficiency over anything else. As mentioned in the article, they are limited by energy, so increasing efficiency by even 1% could mean the difference between first and tenth. Eliminating ""Lift and Coast"", and remaining ""on the limit"" for the full length of the race is what teams  will be pushing for in my opinion. I am assuming also that they will be limited by their maximum power usage during the race still, so it shouldn't be too much of a difference."
FormulaE,3b3dfr,LyskTrevise,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:19:14 2015 UTC,"I mean that's slightly different right? In F1, millions and millions are spent in the off season on R&D which they've missed, and not to mention Marussia were backmarkers to begin with last year."

I can't see Seb or the others catching them on that outside chance. eDams should have been the quickest all year but the two of them just haven't put in consistent results because of mistakes and things, and it's too late. Piquet Jr and di Grassi is going to be a good fight though. I think Piquet has the edge with his energy antics.  I disagree with your Nico > Seb. Prost really hasn't delivered this season.

FormulaE,3b036w,ALMSgeek,2,Thu Jun 25 06:04:53 2015 UTC,I'm honestly more interested in Formula E than I am in Formula 1 or IndyCar.  I think that this will be the place we see real innovation as F1 has all but squashed it in their series with regulations.
FormulaE,3b036w,carsismeZ06,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:09:49 2015 UTC,"Minus everything that made it interesting?? I like FE, but lets he honest, for the next couple of years the teams might as well be driving electric wheelchairs and ylu'll get the same results in the standings. Its only the drivers skill that differentiates teams.   And while thats not a bad thing, with all motorsports the team usually differentiates itself with some technical changes to the car... which are currently not allowed since the aport is homogenized  For the first year it makes perfect sense. But i think they are moving way WAY to slowly in the coming years to loosen restrictions. ESPECIALLY on the battery side!!!!"
FormulaE,3b036w,Khrevv,5,Thu Jun 25 03:56:25 2015 UTC,"Dunno about you, but the wheel-to-wheel racing has been as good in Formula E as any other racing series. And it's only a spec series for this first season, after this, teams will start developing their own parts."
FormulaE,3b036w,Salamander17,2,Thu Jun 25 06:42:18 2015 UTC,"From a technical point of view, couldn't agree more. From a cost and racing point of view, they desperately want to avoid turning into F1 - where budgets usually win the day. Looks like they're heading more towards WEC-type regs, so probably slower growth and waiting to entice a few more big OEMs."
FormulaE,3aym6a,verstibull,7,Wed Jun 24 15:31:11 2015 UTC,Aguri just has no luck with sponsors... really shitty by Amlin if the article is true.
FormulaE,3aym6a,bduddy,0,Wed Jun 24 15:54:42 2015 UTC,Business is business and it sounds like Amlin sees more potential in another team.
FormulaE,3aym6a,carsismeZ06,3,Thu Jun 25 04:47:44 2015 UTC,This is kind of awkward. Hope they can settle in peace.
FormulaE,3aym6a,MotoJ,3,Wed Jun 24 16:43:33 2015 UTC,I don't understand..  I don't suppose someone could explain to me in layman's terms what's going on here?
FormulaE,3aym6a,Latorata,5,Wed Jun 24 20:47:49 2015 UTC,"It reads as if Amlin are looking to sponsor a ""better"" team. At this point, better likely just means someone who wants less money for more exposure, rather than more successful (seeing as the article heavily implies that the team they are looking to sponsor hasn't won a race yet) but we don't know because of the injunction, which legally prevents details from being made public knowledge.  Amlin pulling out of a contract has led the team (Aguri) to sue from damages and breach of contract compensation which is where things are going haywire for the moment. Amlin want out but Aguri want payment, so we hit an impasse.  EDIT For the record, the teams without a win so far this season are; Andretti, Venturi, Mahindra and Trulli."

Firstly, Michelin are not offering the same tyres for F1, they are wet tyres for f. sake! The rim size is a one out of many tyre variables.  And no, the larger rims are way more heavy and have more inertial momentum. Larger rimed wheels are heavier and require more energy to rotate, accelerate, decelerate."

FormulaE,3ap5ev,NomranaEst,15,Mon Jun 22 10:50:28 2015 UTC,"I think this place is running fairly well, similar to other popular motorsport subreddits, such as r/wec. Practise, Qualifying, Race and Post-Race threads go up on time, there is very little spam that goes through here and discussions are (from what I see) polite and respectful.  My main gripe with this subreddit though is the lack of discussion. The race threads draw in a lot of traffic, as those types of threads usually do, but other threads that spring up don't draw much attention. This might be down to the relative ""newness"" of the sport, as it hasn't built an identity or community around it just yet. I think this should sort itself out though, in time.  I'm looking forward to the future of this series with relish though. I'm glad that I'm able to experience its early years."
FormulaE,3ap5ev,BAKspin_91,10,Mon Jun 22 13:51:21 2015 UTC,"The discussion will come with time. As you said this sub and this sport are still new, people are still deciding if they like it or not. As for this sub I'm actually impressed with the number of articles that go up per week (which also speaks well for the amount of articles being written about the sport). The other nice thing about this series has been the lack of reports of promoters in financial trouble after one race. The News about NOLA is sad enough and the state of most formula 1 venues is just pitiful. My hope is that the yearly allowance of upgrades and the great racing keeps this sport well attended for years to come."
FormulaE,3ap5ev,AnilP228,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:09:29 2015 UTC,A lot of people in this subreddit simply post links to their own sites/blogs (even I'm guilty of that) and don't do much posting here outside of trying to get clicks.

FormulaE,3ap5ev,AnilP228,4,Wed Jun 24 21:38:45 2015 UTC,"I let a lot of that slide though because it brings content to the sub while its still a bit fresh. Once it picks up a bit, blatantly posting your own stuff will probably be removed."

FormulaE,3ap5ev,AnilP228,4,Mon Jun 22 17:41:15 2015 UTC,"This may or may not be a good idea but since lack of discussion seems a common comment, what about having some weekly discussion threads or something. We could brainstorm ideas (pit stops, tech development, favorite driver, whatever) and then sticky one topic per week or every couple days or something like that.

FormulaE,3am9q7,Fortherns,3,Sun Jun 21 21:05:29 2015 UTC,"It's a necessary evil, I think. Some teams have rehearsed the pitstops enough that they are sitting around for a while, like di Grassi was there, so it does seem very pointless.  However, I'd rather we had a minimum time to ensure that the driver is belted in securely, as we have now, than a mistake is made due to time pressure and a driver is seriously injured."
FormulaE,3am9q7,NomranaEst,3,Sun Jun 21 22:33:52 2015 UTC,So maybe drop it to 45 secs for the next season?
FormulaE,3am9q7,Fortherns,3,Sun Jun 21 22:39:44 2015 UTC,"I think each track has a different minimum pit stop time, to accommodate the differing pit lane lengths, so a blanket time may not be the right solution. I can certainly see them reducing the time at some event next season though."
FormulaE,3am9q7,NomranaEst,3,Sun Jun 21 22:46:38 2015 UTC,"I mean they are there for a reason. In F1, drivers pick their own speeds when under Yellow Flag conditions, and look what happened in Suzuka 2014. Same here, if drivers were going out ASAP, in those crucial moments of the final race of the season, maybe they don't do up their belt correctly.  They'd need to completely redesign the pit lane to accomodate maybe a lollipop system to scrap min pit stop time. It is possible to scrap it, but not under the current system."

FormulaE,3a57y3,zen_tm,8,Wed Jun 17 09:18:56 2015 UTC,"Expensive? Depends on your benchmark. General admission gets you: FP1, FP2, quali, drivers' parade, race, podium celebrations, schools series sessions in between, and eVillage (electric stunt bikers, simulators, DHL normally have an interactive thing, Renault normally has a funky Scalextric thingy, drivers do an autographing session). FP1 starts at 0815, the podium stuff is normally done by 1815. So around 12 hours of entertainment (in Berlin they then had a DJ til 8pm so you could stick around and ""rave""). That's not a bad ticket price for most days' out."
FormulaE,3a57y3,WriterRory,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:16:33 2015 UTC,"My benchmark,  as stated, are the competing motorsports events - which at that price point or lower offer a whole days racing with many different classes, as well as ancillary entertainment. One 45 minute race and some practice sessions doesn't cut the mustard in my eyes."
FormulaE,3a57y3,WriterRory,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:51:37 2015 UTC,Fair point. £20 for a day's entertainment in Blighty isn't bad. Certainly not compared to a day at the F1. But it'll be on ITV and streamed online so no one actually has to pay anything to see it!
FormulaE,3a57y3,WriterRory,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:30:16 2015 UTC,"It's not at all in the same league as F1, more like Formula Renault, which you can see for £8."
FormulaE,3a57y3,WriterRory,3,Thu Jun 18 10:38:10 2015 UTC,You can't see either of those in central London though. So more like a ticket to a football game or West End show. Both of which will cost a lot more and give you a shorter show.
FormulaE,3a57y3,WriterRory,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:40:26 2015 UTC,"And I guess that's the point - they're not pricing relative to motorsports events [i would argue that Formula E has nowhere near the pulling power of either a football match or west end show]. That said, I recall when the Red Bull Air Race was in Central London and was free when it arrived first, that's similar."
FormulaE,3a57y3,theTTshark,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:48:00 2015 UTC,"Very true. I'm disappointed that it's not free, in all honesty, like some of the other events have been. But I guess they see themselves closer to F1 in terms of an international competition if not audience draw, and £20 is not bad for a day out in most people's books."
FormulaE,3a57y3,danman48,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:52:58 2015 UTC,"I guess there's two camps - casual interest and motorsports fan [me].  The ticket price stopped me from attending and I have no problem paying for what I perceive as good value events, for example on that weekend I will be travelling to the FoS which is £65. I have just come from Le Mans which was a 5-60ish euro GA entry.  I would have attended if it was cheaper ""for a punt"" so to speak, as the attraction of the sport is low at the moment. (Historical / novelty value).   Build up a fan base, and improve the show I say, before pricing out of the market. If people turn up and are disappointed by meagre offerings they won't go back."
FormulaE,3a57y3,Willum,1 point,Thu Jun 18 11:01:33 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more. Was really hoping for free entry. Saying that, if they've invested a few million in park improvements (As they've said) I guess they need to recoup their money somewhere."

FormulaE,3a57y3,Willum,0,Wed Jun 17 11:36:23 2015 UTC,Not for what you get. Remember it is competing against other Motorsport events which provide much more on the programme for less money. It was free admission in the USA.

FormulaE,3a57y3,Enker-Draco,3,Wed Jun 17 16:33:33 2015 UTC,"I think that's just standard UK prices. I made it to Berlin, and was €45 (£32ish) for the Gold grandstand at the start/finish line. No idea how much an equivalent ticket would be for London, I'm guessing a lot more. I'm guessing it's quite a bit more.  I enjoyed the day, but it's true that there isn't much going on in between sessions. They have the usual concessions, autograph sessions (the Berlin one was a disaster!), electric bike stunt shows etc. Hopefully as the championship grows they can add some kind of support races to the bill."

You need to go. I flew to Berlin the Monday after, bummed about the city as a tourist for a week before taking in the race.

FormulaE,39u2r3,JoeyBACON,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:53:55 2015 UTC,"Why do they need to be replaced? Are they racing elsewhere?  After some research, I really don't think they are being replaced. Yes, both of them took place in the opening round of Brazilian Stock Cars but that was only for that round (I mention this because a future round is on the same weekend as FE London). However, Da Costa is in DTM which has an event on the same weekend.  I'm really confused. Where have you read they are being replaced?"
FormulaE,39u2r3,silentalarm_,2,Sun Jun 14 19:59:34 2015 UTC,"Liuzzi and da Costa both have ""prior commitments."" It's been known for a while now that da Costa wouldn't be racing in London.  From the official Formula E Website:  De Silvestro will not be the only driver change for the season finale, as Amlin Aguri needs to hire a replacement for Antonio Felix da Costa who is on DTM duty that weekend, while there will also be a change at Trulli as Vitantonio Liuzzi also has clashing commitments."

Maybe another Ex-FE driver (we have 8 others minus Cerutti and Legge)."

FormulaE,39sq9i,WriterRory,1 point,Sun Jun 14 11:54:19 2015 UTC,This crash seems eerily similar to the Grosjean-Verstappen wreck in Monaco.
FormulaE,39pqzi,EricS53,5,Sat Jun 13 15:43:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for putting this together, but I think there are some mistakes. For example, you seem to have awarded Duran 8th at Argentina, but he was disqualified. Same goes for Montagny's disqualification from Malaysia.  I have to say that points systems that run linearly or close to linearly are silly, however, and I'm incredibly glad they're not used often in single-seaters. An example is the current NASCAR system, which gives 47 for 1st, 42 for 2nd, 41 for 3rd, 40 for 4th, 39 for 5th, 38 for 6th, etc.  The problem with such systems is that they give an absurdly large bonus for consistency. To give an example, see the points tallies in the following example:    Driver R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 R6 R7 R8 R9 R10 Total    Driver A 1st 1st 1st 1st 1st 1st 1st 1st 1st 18th (DNF) 183   Driver B 2nd 2nd 2nd 2nd 2nd 2nd 2nd 2nd 2nd 2nd 190    Driver A loses the championship due to a single DNF, despite winning 9 of 10 races!  It's a noble goal to extend points to lower positions, but a linear scoring system is not worth the obvious problems it introduces. Better is to use a system that scales nonlinearly (e.g., exponential or power law). There is one example of such a system here."
FormulaE,39pqzi,whatthefat,2,Sat Jun 13 18:54:09 2015 UTC,The bonus for coming first needs to be higher is what I think you've proved.
FormulaE,39pqzi,robjapan,3,Sat Jun 13 21:33:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the problem with such a scoring system doesn't just apply to first place. Any high-running driver will be very heavily punished for a single DNF."
FormulaE,39pqzi,whatthefat,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:44:27 2015 UTC,But that assumes that other drivers won't have DNFs though right?  I agree with you though because you can imagine someone just driving safely to avoid a DNF instead of pushing like hell to gain a position.
FormulaE,39pqzi,robjapan,2,Sat Jun 13 22:13:55 2015 UTC,"Well, in such a scoring system it will come down to who has the fewest DNFs. If you have two and others have one, they will outscore you, even if you beat them in all the other races. Since DNFs are often down to luck (especially mechanical DNFs), I think that makes for a very poor system."
FormulaE,39pqzi,whatthefat,2,Sat Jun 13 22:52:24 2015 UTC,"yeh I agree, as I said I think that pushing to the limit and taking risks should be rewarded as opposed to taking it easy and making 100% sure that you finish the race."
FormulaE,39pqzi,robjapan,2,Sun Jun 14 00:26:21 2015 UTC,"The thing with NASCAR is that it holds 36 points paying races, so you need to have consistency in order to even contend for a championship. (Although with the pants on head retarded new chase system, that's thrown out the window.)"
FormulaE,39pqzi,GD7901,1 point,Sat Jun 13 21:50:09 2015 UTC,"Well, the chase system is obviously a whole other level of stupidity, but a points system that puts consistency ahead of everything else is deeply flawed in my opinion.   For example, a driver who finishes 3rd in all the 36 races will outscore a driver who finishes 2nd in 35 races and breaks down at the start of 1 race. I think that's a patently ridiculous system."
FormulaE,39pqzi,whatthefat,2,Sat Jun 13 21:59:22 2015 UTC,"I think a point system without a big bonus to win in racing is like basketball without a shot clock. It discourages aggression and people take it easy. I like the F1 system but I think the old 10-6-4-3-2-1 was the best.  I think NASCAR has even wised up to it, because in that pants on head retarded new system, winners move on to the next round regardless of point total."
FormulaE,39pqzi,emersonlakeandlagoon,2,Sat Jun 13 22:50:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Looking at F1, the 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1 system was awful for that reason. Raikkonen got within 3 points of winning the 2003 championship despite having only 1 win to Schumacher's 6 wins. And that's still a much better system than the current NASCAR points system, where 2nd place scores between 88-94% of the points for 1st place (depending on bonuses for laps led).  Rather than introducing the new chase format they should simply have created a sensible scoring system that scales appropriately."
FormulaE,39pqzi,whatthefat,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:59:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for pointing out Duran and Montagny, I usually just do it right after the race so sometime I miss disqualifications or positions dropped.  The NASCAR system is where I got the idea from. Personally I like it, and I think consistency should be rewarded just as much. I used to do Bonus points for winners when I did it more manually, but since I do this with F1, Indy Car, and NASCAR (it's top 20 for all of them, F1 and FE are obviously the two that make it for everyone) I stray from bonus points. The system isn't prefect, but I enjoy doing this for fun. Thanks for the input though!"
FormulaE,39pqzi,atjays,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:30:59 2015 UTC,"Well a season like nascar with 30+ races it makes sense that consistency is rewarded. Also their points table may be that way but their championship ""chase"" can totally undermind the entire thing"

I think towards the end of a season when it's clear who is going to be competing for the title, people are naturally going to focus more on those at the top.

FormulaE,392fcl,Badoit1778,5,Mon Jun 8 19:36:31 2015 UTC,"Trulli getting away with 2 chicane cuts? I'm pretty sure you could see him do it 3 times and if i'm not mistaken, the commentator said something about a 4th time. Not to mention that he wasn't in the view every lap."
FormulaE,392fcl,sc_140,2,Tue Jun 9 02:38:41 2015 UTC,"I'm really excited, I watched every race live and imo the races are more interesting to watch than F1 races, cause it's not as predictable as F1. Imo the championship is very exciting I mean there 3 drivers who have more or less the same chances to take the title with just 2 races to go. Can't remember when in F1 was a similar situation. Formula E has to improve in a lot ways, but nevertheless I'm a fan since day one and I hope we see a action packed title shown down."
FormulaE,392fcl,JacenDie,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:44:01 2015 UTC,"2007 for example. But F1 has about twice as many races, so it would rather compare to 3 guys having a shot with 4 races to go."

FormulaE,38wcbg,adulion,3,Sun Jun 7 19:27:45 2015 UTC,"ITV show is pretty poor which is strange cos they do a good job for the btcc. But you have an hour of studio time before the race even starts which is  just full of rubbish. Why do we wanna see whatever her name is dolled up in an evening dress at random times in the day, it should be done all trackside.   Next, the commentators are pretty dull and never seem to have a clue what is going on.  But the main point I wanna are is that I just don't find formulae that interesting. It's too slow for a start, they barely reach 100mph. Also would be better if they raced on real tracks rather than cobbled together street tracks that aren't recognisable. But this would show up the lack of speed even more so. Monaco was alright as it is a proper street circuit, or at least part of it.   It always seems to be on the same weekend as f1 which I think is stupid. I thought it was gonna be in the f1 off season when it started, but no just ridiculous gaps between races means it's dragged on for the best part of a year.   Also, that goddamn shitty electro music needs to go. Formula ej, jesus who thought that was gonna be a good idea.   Having said all that I still watch it cos I am a motorsport fan, but my solution is to record it, then I skip the first hour of the itv broadcast, watch the first couple laps real time, then watch in fast forward til the pit stops, then again to a few laps from the end, switching back to real time if there is any good on track action. It's great, don't have to listen to the shitty music or commentators, and it makes the cars faster. Only downside is its a bit jerky, but at least it's all done and dusted in under 30mins."

A lot of the midpack racing was missed, or not shown live, plus that final lap was horrifically bad.

FormulaE,38sml6,variaati0,8,Sat Jun 6 14:09:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah the camera director has had a victory lap complex for the whole season. They show the clearly safe leader basically doing an unopposed victory lap, when the rest of the pack is doing desperate last ditch overtaking attemps, which is what people really want to see."
FormulaE,38sml6,McAndze,9,Sat Jun 6 17:49:16 2015 UTC,"Not the most exciting, but not a bad race, I was entertained. Cool track, hope to see something done about the chicane cutting for next year, and hopefully somehow promote a bit more overtaking."
FormulaE,38sml6,variaati0,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:01:01 2015 UTC,"They really should put a small tire wall or something similar in the chicane. Not enough to be really dangerous when you have to go wide in a crash/emergency situation, but enough to ruin your your front wing for anyone thinking of cutting the chicane needlesly.   Now it was to easy to go just ""well I got contacted little bit on the chicane, so it is okay for me to cut it"". I know they leave it empty for safety, but surely they could use tire or come up with some other safe way to discourage cutting it."

FormulaE,38sml6,Kookanoodles,5,Sun Jun 7 13:38:38 2015 UTC,"My thoughts:   What a race from Piquet and NEXTEV! Push hard at first, pit early, then manage the battery to stay in front. Masterful. Circuit: gorgeous, almost unreal backdrop, but too few overtaking opportunities. However I loved the bit that went up the hill towards the chicane, it had great camera angles too. Weird for a seasoned driver like Jarno Trulli to behave like that. Perhaps he thought he was entitled to keep the position since Da Costa's moves left him no room entering the chicane. Maybe Vergne thought the same and that's why he didn't take advantage of Buemi slowing down to give him back the position. Dario!!!"
FormulaE,38sml6,Skelenal,3,Sun Jun 7 20:42:26 2015 UTC,"Another great race from Piquet, he's been the best driver of the last few races. Not the most action packed race we've seen but it was still interesting."

FormulaE,38sml6,hopeimanon,3,Sat Jun 6 13:53:32 2015 UTC,Ok Trulli better get a serious penalty after cutting the chicane at least 3 times.

That Chicane was a bit of an issue, but a very long straight wouldn't had been any better (battery drain, and driving locked at ""top speed"" in these cars isn't exactly exciting).

FormulaE,38sml6,Duff5OOO,2,Sun Jun 7 09:51:56 2015 UTC,I would like to see them use technology to prevent the chicane cutting. Something like if you hit a certain part area of the chicane you are automatically down 50KW for the next 10 sec.

FormulaE,38sml6,ShlawsonSays,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:52:10 2015 UTC,I might be in conspiracy theory mode here but I can't help but wonder if Verne intentionally didn't re-pass Buemi after the chicane to make him get a penalty so Verne would get the place back after the race.  I cannot see any other reason that Verne didn't out-accelerate him out of that corner considering that Buemi lifted after he cut it.
FormulaE,38sml6,silentalarm_,6,Mon Jun 8 05:37:48 2015 UTC,Maybe he felt he had caused the contact before the chicane and didn't feel he deserved the place.
FormulaE,38sml6,ShlawsonSays,3,Mon Jun 8 19:43:44 2015 UTC,"True, that's a good point. Would like to hear an interview with them both"
FormulaE,38sml6,Skelenal,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:01:01 2015 UTC,That's what I think happened as well. That will probably save Buemi from getting penalised though because we can see that he tried to give the place back and Vergne wouldn't take it. He ended up costing himself 4th place as well so it backfired spectacularly.
FormulaE,38sml6,Lord_Iggy,3,Sat Jun 6 14:08:15 2015 UTC,"Do you guys suppose it was that? That would have been an interesting  gambit. Given that it was the last lap, it wouldn't make very much sense, that was one of the last good overtaking opportunities for Buemi."
FormulaE,38sml6,Skelenal,1 point,Sat Jun 6 14:16:06 2015 UTC,"If that is what he did I don't think it was a good idea, like you say there wasn't really anywhere else for Buemi to overtake. It would have been a split second decision but I can't think of any other reason for him to back off the way he did."
FormulaE,38sml6,Lord_Iggy,2,Sat Jun 6 14:05:48 2015 UTC,"Heidfeld speculated that Vergne was in critical power saving.

FormulaE,38se51,Skelenal,2,Sat Jun 6 13:55:23 2015 UTC,I really wanna know how heidfeld got through too.... I wonder if Vergne was worried about running out of energy or something.  He finisehd with 1%

FormulaE,38se51,BaltimoreBirdGuy,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:26:33 2015 UTC,I actually thought we'd see much more overtaking especially with how wide the track is in the first parts.

Vergne got caught on a dirty bit of the track as Buemi slowed to let him past, but Vergne didn't get past. Heidfeld capitalized on the situation by charging up behind Buemi, which slipped him ahead of the unseated Vergne."

FormulaE,38j7fi,Quantax-Dynamics,1 point,Sun Jun 7 09:40:11 2015 UTC,"Nick Heidfeld did pretty well at BMW Sauber.  Jarno Trulli won at Monaco in 2004.  People like Speed and Wilson weren't bad drivers, they just weren't very good in F1.  People like Liuzzi, Chandhok and Pic were just stuck at backmarkers the whole time.   So pretty much none of them actually accomplished anything in F1.  Maybe we can let Prost Sr. have a go in the cars."
FormulaE,38j7fi,JoeyBACON,1 point,Sun Jun 7 12:11:53 2015 UTC,"I always felt Heidfeld was more or less the 'regular points scorer' to Webber (2005) and then Kubica. Trulli won on a track that doesn't favour overtaking, and he's known for holding up drivers and making it difficult to pass.   Speed, Liuzzi, Chandhok, Pic, B.Senna, Algersuari, Buemi and especially Piquet Jr did all drive for backmarkers, but none of them ever set the world on fire when they were there. All of them were pretty average drivers. We've seen what great drivers can do in rubbish machinery, and I don't think any of them did that except maybe Buemi.   I'd be totally up for an 'old veterans' series though with A. Prost, Piquet Sr, (Sarrazin probably counts already), maybe Kristensen."

FormulaE,38610l,kickinsticks,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:36:43 2015 UTC,You'd think this is the kind of question they would answer every broadcast!
FormulaE,38610l,Joonaa,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:36:10 2015 UTC,"I think at least during Berlin race they did some basic commentary on it based on some on air calculating. However it would be good, if they would do some more of it. Have some basic numbers ready from training observations etc. Maybe some regen numbers etc. Of course all the depend on the exact setup each team is running.   You can pretty easily calculate the over all battery depletion rate from first pit stop lap. 100%/(First stint length in laps). Pretty much every one runs their first battery near dry before pitting. Crude measure would be to just calculate 200%/(race length in laps), but I'm pretty sure people don't drive their cars fully dry on the second section. They usually seem to leave little bit in reverse for the last lap battles and newer use it totally dry. We know the official battery pack size spec so you could estimate the energy rates from the percentages.  Of course getting exact numbers on how much recovery happens, would need constant monitoring from the telemetry. I'm sure the teams know it, but they probably wont tell. Amount of available regen is actually a pretty important trade secret for the race team. It would vary greatly depending on coasting vs regen oriented setup. Formula E is all about energy efficiency and recovery so teams probably want to keep their exact numbers secret to hide their pit strategy.  What was actually odd, was that the commentators said the teams don't get live telemetry from the cars and need to radio around numbers with the drivers. Rather odd arrangement for such a high tech racing series.  Maybe they have on-board recorders and they can read it after coming back to pit. Clearly the TV crew and FIA get live telemetry, so the car is capable of it. So it must be a race rule thing."

FormulaE,37p51x,F1nut72,2,Fri May 29 08:16:16 2015 UTC,I don't get hosting a race in Montreal.   Circuit Gilles Villeneuve is too long and fast. They wouldn't be able to get much more than 5 laps in a charge.   Most of the streets of Montreal in suitable locations for racing are old and in terrible condition.

FormulaE,37mo82,faizimam,1 point,Thu May 28 23:34:12 2015 UTC,Blue Bonnets maybe? Destroy it and build a track there. Cause I can't see many streets that would be able to accomodate a race.
FormulaE,37mo82,yipyipmthrfckr,1 point,Thu May 28 23:42:06 2015 UTC,"But the point of Formula E is not to build a track. With a few obvious exceptions, the point is to come in to the city, take over for 2 days, race, then dissapear leaving no trace.  My first thought would be Old Montreal, by taking over the waterfront and using the old piers.  Another would be Using Jarry park and the surrounding streets. Lots of room for Temp events there.

FormulaE,37mhf7,kickinsticks,3,Thu May 28 18:32:16 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda hoping we have a season or two where teams have to decide whether or not they pit or not. So do they pit and have two faster stints, or do they attempt to eke out their car over the race distance and go without pitting. In my head, that would make for some interesting strategies.   That aside, I would favour improved car performance over an endurance race. Keep improving the battery life, add a few more laps and have the races a similar length in overall time."
FormulaE,37mhf7,lucasmurph,4,Sat May 30 15:33:04 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer if races didn't become longer than a hour, but longer tracks and reducing it to 1 car will happen in the future with technology updates and manufacturer variety."

FormulaE,372rpv,JacenDie,1 point,Sun May 24 09:14:54 2015 UTC,"""Quick Nick"" in electrical rush Formula E sneeks trough Berlin  from Holger Preiss, Berlin  After 16 years finally a car race is back in Berlin. This time there aren't roaring V8's instead of them the youngest FIA Series is sneaking trough the capital: Formula E. But can it hook the Petrolheads ?  On Saturday Berlin got electrified. The Formula E, the racing series of the ecolocigal, battery powered racecars, made a stop in the german capital for the 8 round. On the former Airport Tempelhof ""on of the best racetracks of the series"", according to Nick Heidfeld, was built. The task was to run the 2,5 km long racetrack with 17 turns within 1 hour. 2 long straights had enough space for overtaking.  The race in the german Metropol was supposed to be the homerace for the former F1 Driver, who was called ""Quick Nick"" in these days. The man from Mönchengladbach believed he will win but the win was taken by the brasilian Team Abt driver Lucas di Grassi. ""Quick Nick"" finished as ""Electro Nick"" only down in sixth position. Despite the Venturi Driver managed to qualify in P4.  No Luck for Electro Nick  Nick Heidfeld, Jean-Eric Vergne and F1-legend Jarno Trulli were probably the reason why 21.000 people came to Airfield Tempelhof. But beside the big names it was also the curiosity if a silent Series like Formule E could give Berlin something back what they lost from the AVUS-Racetrack in the 1999. Unfortunately the series could manage to be exciting in the last round in Monaco. There were wheel-to-wheel action, overtaking and even a proper crash, happily no one was hurt.  Formula E to slow ?  A lot of the people were disappointed by the speed. "" I thought they were faster"", said a disappointed spectator after the race. Wrong Perception ? Maybe, because the e-racer goes 250 km/h fast. Because of the whispering electro engines the petrolheads didn't get hooked. I don't want to sound like Bernie Ecclestone, but something is missing indeed. It might just be the suggested speed generated by the coughin sound of up- and downshifting. F1 cars are only in top speed comparison faster. Manifestly 100 km/h faster.  You could also say that F1 is boring at the moment, because of the mercedes domination, but Ferrari is hunting them und if Audi decides to support Red Bull with engiges, the Bulls could learn to walk again. Also Honda is about to make McLaren competitive again. And if they really come back to V8s Ecclestone has won and ecologic touch would be maculation.  Couldn't Formula E run into the same fate ? At the moment they are racing with the same cars and the drivers skill is suspected the only thing which differs between winner and loser. In the next season it is allowed to use cars from other constructers. This could lead possibly lead to a dominating team. But one thing is a fact: At the moment fans get hooked by faster cars and importantly by the sound of engines and furthermorer PS are easier to handle for a fan than kWH.  Maybe it's just a mather of time till the battery are stronger and last longer, there is no need for car changing or till the cars could run hills up and down. Maybe this could make Formula E as exciting as other racing series'. Anyway I learned today that women like the whispering of the E-Racers more than the roaring of a V8."
FormulaE,370ego,silentalarm_,17,Sat May 23 18:21:43 2015 UTC,I just finished watching the race. That's pretty ridiculous. May explain why he was so much faster than all the other drivers.
FormulaE,370ego,nyaanyaanyaa,28,Sat May 23 18:32:11 2015 UTC,"Read up on it. Some pretty blatant cheating, I'd say:  The changes were listed by the stewards as follows:  1) The front wheel fairing both left and right hand side have been modified with internal metal reinforcing rods.  2) Six of the eight holes in the front wing have been sealed. The remaining two holes having helicoil inserts and chamfers made.  3) Front flap and gurney LH 220 has a filler layer added and chamfer made.  Apparently the team says they were repairs and that they did not have any intention of gaining a competitive advantage. Don't think I believe that tbh."

FormulaE,36z2wh,AnilP228,5,Sat May 23 10:45:14 2015 UTC,"What a lap from Trulli! D'Ambrosio and Heidfeld too..  Race should be great, although I'm disappointed for Sam Bird and Piquet."
FormulaE,36z2wh,blackbasset,3,Sat May 23 11:25:30 2015 UTC,"Trulli and Heidfeld in the front, yeah! Finally! Let's hope Nick's bad luck doesn't take him out, and Jarno with him..."
FormulaE,36z2wh,Skelenal,2,Sat May 23 11:48:12 2015 UTC,"Wow, looks like the Trulli team have found some pace."
FormulaE,36z2wh,Skelenal,1 point,Sat May 23 10:07:44 2015 UTC,Well that'll be a penalty for Alguersuari.
FormulaE,36z2wh,andrew2209,1 point,Sat May 23 10:24:42 2015 UTC,"ITV, do you need an ad break after every single qualifying group?"
FormulaE,36z2wh,Skelenal,1 point,Sat May 23 10:29:12 2015 UTC,"No penalty for Alguersuari? I'm surprised by that, it looked like he completely ruined Sarrazin's lap."
FormulaE,36z2wh,VincentVendetta,1 point,Sat May 23 10:46:41 2015 UTC,HIT THE RANDOM BUTTON!
FormulaE,36z2wh,blackbasset,1 point,Sat May 23 10:56:33 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who thinks the Berlin track is too wide with too much runoff area? Monaco was too tight, but that's too much imho"
FormulaE,36z2wh,Floodman11,4,Sat May 23 10:19:05 2015 UTC,"Too much run off, yes, but the width is going to make the race great fun to watch"
FormulaE,36z2wh,blackbasset,2,Sat May 23 10:23:20 2015 UTC,I hope so :)
FormulaE,36z2wh,duckliver,2,Sat May 23 10:28:10 2015 UTC,Run-off areas give the drivers the opportunity to push harder and take more risk though. Nobody wants to try an overtake in Monaco because the slightest lock-up or mistake will see you crashing into the walls.
FormulaE,36z2wh,Floodman11,1 point,Sat May 23 11:04:29 2015 UTC,"This is true, but is that such a bad thing? There's a reason that St. Devote and the Wall of Champions have that legendary status: They're dangerous corners, and they catch a lot of drivers out. I'd rather there be penalties for running off track instead of allowing these top level drivers acres of run off to keep eating in to in search of more lap time"
FormulaE,36z2wh,Skelenal,3,Sat May 23 11:10:21 2015 UTC,"It could be too wide, I hadn't really looked at the track before qualifying started but I was surprised when I saw how wide it is. Maybe they wanted to make the most of the room they had since they're confined to streets for the rest of the season.  If it makes for good racing though I'll be fine with it."
FormulaE,36z2wh,blackbasset,1 point,Sat May 23 10:27:15 2015 UTC,"Maybe they wanted to make the most of the room they had since they're confined to streets for the rest of the season.   I think you're right, I'm looking forward to how that turns out"
FormulaE,36z2wh,iso700c,1 point,Sat May 23 10:28:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the width makes the cars look super slow."
FormulaE,36z0gg,WriterRory,1 point,Sat May 23 09:04:22 2015 UTC,It definitely looks like they're having a few issues with the tyres. I was up close at a corner during the second practice and there were pieces of rubber flying everywhere.
FormulaE,36yohq,Floodman11,2,Sat May 23 06:02:07 2015 UTC,"The track looks awesome. Also, tyre deg is going to be a thing"
FormulaE,36yohq,Badoit1778,1 point,Sat May 23 08:24:58 2015 UTC,"woa, is there an e prix today?"
FormulaE,36yohq,keirdre,2,Sat May 23 10:38:34 2015 UTC,"Haha, that's what I thought! Got so distracted by F1, GP2, Indy 500 and WRC. Bonus!"
FormulaE,36yohq,Badoit1778,1 point,Sat May 23 10:50:44 2015 UTC,"pretty amazing, I leave formulaE for a few days and watch it on youtube in my own time. Still after month long gaps between races this one has caught me by surprise being so soon after the last one."
FormulaE,36v44k,Kookanoodles,14,Fri May 22 11:01:03 2015 UTC,"This looks to be one of the more interesting tracks of the season. It looks to be more open than others, more in line with a permanent circuit than a pure street track, so how the drivers approach the sections with varying lines will be interesting.  Certainly will be watching this."
FormulaE,36v44k,NomranaEst,4,Fri May 22 11:21:09 2015 UTC,That was my first thought too. I know I'll be watching. What a weekend for open wheel racing!
FormulaE,36v44k,redfixx,5,Fri May 22 13:44:33 2015 UTC,"This must be the best circuit of FE so far. Sure the pilots will love it, seems fun to drive on it!"
FormulaE,36v44k,Clapaludio,1 point,Fri May 22 13:28:38 2015 UTC,Very good preview. Track looks interesting.
FormulaE,36v44k,gufcfan,1 point,Fri May 22 18:41:45 2015 UTC,Looks a lot like Valencia or Sochi. I'm impressed by this circuit.
FormulaE,36vynj,code777,3,Fri May 22 15:40:42 2015 UTC,For the first 4 races this guy looked like a real force in the championship with the most atrocious luck. Now he's just faded entirely into the background.
FormulaE,36vq91,AnilP228,1 point,Fri May 22 14:31:58 2015 UTC,This was always going to be an issue. As much as I want to see more and more components of the car to be non-spec the financial commitment of the smaller teams was going to be touch and go. The more established teams can get sponsors and resources but teams like Dragon and Trulli were going to be in the danger zone.
FormulaE,36vq91,LegendsoftheHT,-1,Fri May 22 17:15:17 2015 UTC,Can we not start the stupid Pay-Wall tag in this sub
FormulaE,36vlep,leesacks,1 point,Fri May 22 13:52:35 2015 UTC,Vergne confirmed try-hard /s
FormulaE,36v4up,dogmop,1 point,Fri May 22 11:08:19 2015 UTC,TV broadcasters in Canada are RDS (French language sports network) and Fox Sports Racing.  However the latter is having lots of carriage issues with very few service providers broadcasting the channel.  Also both suck due to number of commercials per race... Really breaks up the action of an already short event.  Unsure of sports bars that would show it as race will be around 10 am local time.  I'm personally usually streaming the ITV4 feed.
FormulaE,36v4up,djfil007,2,Fri May 22 15:46:54 2015 UTC,"I might try and see about streaming it at the place I'm staying, though might be a bit tight on time to get from there to Circuit Gilles-Villeneuve so will probably just end up recording and avoiding all FE news until I'm home. Thanks anyway!"

FormulaE,36r4ru,WriterRory,1 point,Thu May 21 13:38:52 2015 UTC,Is this surprising?
FormulaE,36r4ru,Frankk142,1 point,Thu May 21 14:25:10 2015 UTC,not really surprising i guess :D
FormulaE,36r4ru,siriuslywinchester,1 point,Thu May 21 15:33:12 2015 UTC,Haha probably not. Although the team likely could have picked anyone they wanted to for season two...
FormulaE,36qlel,WriterRory,1 point,Thu May 21 09:56:30 2015 UTC,interesting read and a great review of the season so far.  looking forward to the race this weekend.  hoping that sam can get a good qualifying lap in as that seems to be his biggest problem.
FormulaE,36qlel,siriuslywinchester,2,Thu May 21 10:45:47 2015 UTC,Deffo. Maybe he's saving his best for the two British races.....!
FormulaE,36qlel,siriuslywinchester,1 point,Thu May 21 11:43:36 2015 UTC,hope so!  i'm going to be waving my flag for him there! :D
FormulaE,36lpw6,WriterRory,1 point,Wed May 20 08:57:43 2015 UTC,"I used to race against them, it was great fun. No big deal beating Jaguar and Bentley though, their cars were shocking. The school teams were all way more competitive!"
