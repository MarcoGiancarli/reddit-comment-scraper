Raw materials like metals need to come from somewhere and it's hard to see a simple solution, so it hasn't been talked about much. Especially because people can only buy an end product containing a mix of materials, some of which might come from mines in Africa owned by warlords, some of which might be rare earth metals from Chinese mines with poor working conditions, and might be assembled in a factory in S.E. China with decent working conditions for a company that pays close attention only to the last stage of manufacture ... a computer chip is going to have a much more complicated pedigree of materials than a diamond, which is a single thing that came out of the ground in one piece and is refined and sold by the company that owns the mine."

This revolution was for getting rid of Western influence in Africa to build a safer, more developed, and generally less shitty Africa. After that revolution the country doesn't allow Western corporations inside its borders without a hefty cost attached. Then a report comes out that says this new country has some of the worst human rights abuses in the world. People are up in arms. Calls for intervening and dismantling the government from the media are rampant. The US government goes in, assassinates the president (or Prime Minister or dictator, whatever it's to be), institutes a new and authoritarian regime on the side of the US, and then pats itself on the back for eliminating an evil, socialissssssssssst country.  This tiny little African country, we'll call it some made up name like Eritrea, will be forgotten in time. It won't make the news again. It will continue to be a shitty place to live.

He was working with HSBC to launder his money for the Sinaloa Cartel. Since a few people are asking, I suspect all the major banks launder money to some degree. HSBC just got caught in a ""record breaking"" lawsuit for 2012, fining them $1.9B. Sort of seems like a lot of money, until you realize how much money they made laundering money. It looks like they laundered about $9B alone from Mexico, and I can only imagine what the processing fee % is to launder money. They laundered dozens and probably hundreds of billions of dollars, so the civil suit is nothing. Most of the money was just garden-variety illicit, you have your typical mexican cartel money, russian mob money, etc.  A quote: ""The bank also violated U.S. economic sanctions against Iran, Libya, Sudan, Burma and Cuba, according to a criminal information filed in the case."" Typically i don't support sanctions because it just restricts the population from accessing outside information and products. In this case though, I don't think that HSBC was making an effort to support small businesses to get loans in Burma unless they were for land mines.   The banks throw their hands up and say, ""oops! our compliance department is such a mess! This was terrible protocol. We might have unknowingly laundered money for terrorists! wooooops. srrrry.""
