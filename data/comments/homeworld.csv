Homeworld is like TibSun, with modern graphics, played out in the Halo universe.  Most of the mechanics should be fairly similar to what you're used to, pushing Shift to bring up the vertical movement will probably be the weirdest thing. And if you get disoriented just hit <SPACE> to jump out to the sensors manager and re-orient."
homeworld,3e4q3e,Sastrei,3,Wed Jul 22 00:02:44 2015 UTC,"Remastered (even with it's issues) holds up REALLY well against modern RTS games. In fact, it kind of shows how little the genre has advanced over the last 15 years.  Unlike /u/Sastrei, I don't think it's because of the 3D gameplay. 3D in Homeworld is less of a central feature, and more of a gimmick... a really, really well implemented gimmick."

They were probably testing it before the last patch and some of the code is probably in the game right now, and I think one of the mission scripts accidentally enables it for some people.  If I'm right it's probably going to be fixed in the next patch whether or not they're aware of it. You could always report it on the official forums though. The link is in the sidebar."

homeworld,3dn2bj,YourProgrammerFriend,10,Fri Jul 17 16:36:23 2015 UTC,"The general problem is that they put HW1 in the HW2 engine.  The two were actually quite different, so it had unintended consequences in both viable tactics (HW1 formations don't work like they did, for one) and multiplayer balance.  It's still a lot of fun though."
homeworld,3dn2bj,BobbleBobble,4,Fri Jul 17 17:07:41 2015 UTC,"Gotcha.  I barely remember the original, so these aren't really issues I care about."
homeworld,3dn2bj,Nolic0321,4,Fri Jul 17 17:25:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah a lot of people complain about the HW1 formations ""not working"" and it really has to do with the engine that was used (HW2).  HW2 started using dice rolls to determine if a shot hit whereas in HW1 the projectiles were objects in the world and if they hit something they caused damage.  Funny thing is they kept the HW1 formation in the Remastered so a lot of people complained about it ""not working"".  I've discussed it in one of my let's play episode ;)  Still a great game tho!  I've played through HW and HW2 and still love the franchise!!!  Plus it's great to see all the HD goodness!"
homeworld,3dn2bj,chuiu,5,Fri Jul 17 18:06:13 2015 UTC,People were complaining about formations not working because they weren't.  You would put your corvettes into wall and as soon as they went into combat the wall would disappear and they would be circle strafing the enemy in no noticeable organized fashion using half their guns.  The formations turned into a 'out of combat only' thing and your squads would never actually use them in battle where you needed them most.
homeworld,3dn2bj,Gopherlad,7,Sat Jul 18 04:20:27 2015 UTC,I don't know how people keep missing this. Do people not watch their ships in combat? Does no one remember microing their wings to strafe the rear of enemy ships back in HW1? We lost a lot of control fidelity when everything was ported to the HW2 engine.
homeworld,3dn2bj,Zoloir,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:13:42 2015 UTC,"^ Yeah, this seems to be one of those things that really splits the crowd of casual fans who enjoy the story and visuals VS the players who actually played the multiplayer and kept it alive.  I guess that was the feeling i always had about HW1 that never stuck when i tried out HW2, that there was just a layer of control you had over your ships in HW1 that made the difference between a novice and a skilled player huge when actually in battle, whereas in HW2 the only thing differentiating a novice and a skilled player is macromanagement of your economy and literal ship placement, i.e. did i get the right number of ships into battle at the right time? kk done. (and even sometimes when you DO get the edge, that edge is lost due to no fault but the RNG)."
homeworld,3dn2bj,Nolic0321,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:06:27 2015 UTC,"But with a RNG machine in place the formations have no advantage/disadvantage.  In fact it would be more favorable if they all flew around because they'd have more ""face time"" towards their target and have a better chance of hitting their target.  I was a fan of the strategy behind the game and, yes, admit I would have liked the old hit system but they lost all that and i'm ok with what is there now."
homeworld,3dn2bj,chuiu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:56:22 2015 UTC,"Advantages of formations:  Less predictable pathing for corvettes.  They fly around the target like fighters instead of HW2 corvettes.  This makes it harder for frigates and destroyers to track and shoot at them.  Right now they just fly in a circle around the target, making them easier to hit.  Front facing guns hit more often.  When you are constantly side strafing then you're not able to shoot ALL of your guns all the time.  Flying around in formations makes it so that the guns in HW1 which were designed to shoot primarily from the front get more face time with the enemy.  Sure in RM they are 'facing' the enemy more often, but it doesn't mean they are able to shoot more often.  Stuff like corvette walls may be able to work again.  Corvette walls were a good strategy because support craft could follow behind them and repair them as they attacked.  In RM they can't do that both because the repair AI is broken and because the corvettes will disperse and fly spread out around the target so its harder to keep a ship on them for repairs."
homeworld,3dn2bj,Nolic0321,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:09:08 2015 UTC,"I guess I didn't play multiplayer as much so the in-depth strategy behind formations is lost on me.  I did understand it, and took advantage of it, in the single player so that's probably why it doesn't phase me as much.  I don't totally understand how those things you mentioned are...advantageous over what is in RM.  ""This makes it harder for frigates and destroyers to track and shoot at them."" - I think even if they were flying like fighters RNG hit chancing is no different whether they stick to formation or not.  Maybe the fact that they are in a tight circle around said unit...yeah the swivel guns have time on them as a target.  I don't understand your front facing guns comment as much...unless you mean they're strafing while moving forward...but if all the units disperse they aren't dependant on waiting for the squad to turn towards the target.  They'll have their own strafing formations and with a RNG the more ""face time"" you have the more hits you get (at least that's my thought process)  Now the repair tactic is a valid one for keeping formations.  Never really knew of this tactic ;)  Hope this makes sense.  I'm not trying to be a punk or anything I just don't see how some people hate the RM and think it's a waste of money because of the the formations.. shrugs idk maybe i'm just easy to please"
homeworld,3dn2bj,Smugasaurus,2,Mon Jul 20 20:57:57 2015 UTC,"Remastered is a good game/product in my opinion. It looks great, sounds great, the story is still fantastic and to a newcomer or someone who hardly remembers, it plays pretty nicely and uniquely as well. Also, once you finish HW:RM, HW2:RM seems better in terms of gameplay.  To HW veterans, the reason HW2:RM plays better is of course clear, it's in its native engine, while HW1 was ported over. The formation issues and to some extent the dice roll versus physical projectile debate are what most people will say is wrong with RM at the moment. There is a big patch on the way though, but it's taking a long time. Hopefully that means it will be a really good patch."

homeworld,3dn2bj,Smugasaurus,2,Sat Jul 18 04:22:51 2015 UTC,"Well, my indication is that they have said it is coming and I have seen no denial of that.   We have had regular patches since release, the last one was on June 9th and it actually added new content, the Raider Retreat mission. The optimist in me says that the next patch is taking a while longer because it is bigger.  Also, I am making wild guesses here, but it seems to me that the team working on Remastered right now is probably on the small side, and that could be another reason why it is taking a while.  Edit: I also just checked the Gearbox Forums and the developers that have made comments about patches in the past are still talking about what they're working on.

The last mission is supposed to be an insane survival battle that brings you to practically despair, but in RM the timing is so totally off and the magic is gone. Not sure what the heck they did but that was one of my most anticipated moments for the game, and it was just disappointing."
homeworld,3dn2bj,Ares54,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:22:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if they've changed this, but i know that at some point the campaign was dynamically scaled so that the enemy changes based on your fleet strength. It is possible that you had just the correct fleet size to make it as easy as possible. I'm not 100% on this, but i heard that people who farmed ion cannons on the sphere level ended up getting asswhooped by a gigantic fleet that scaled hilariously large."
homeworld,3dn2bj,Riekopo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:11:23 2015 UTC,"It's also partially a distance scaling issue. Fleets come out of hyperspace at the same time, and at the same distance relative to each other, but where in HW that was 100km away, in HW:R it's 33km away. The result is that everything happens faster, but it's also easier to get your own ships into position.  Between that and the dynamic scaling it throws the whole feel of the mission off; everything ends up being close enough to get there, and you end up with exactly the fleet you need to have to fight off the enemy. End result is a mission that feels too easy and ends too quickly."
homeworld,3dn2bj,Weentastic,2,Wed Jul 22 04:41:19 2015 UTC,Mechanically it's just not the same game. It's Homeworld 2 with a Homeworld 1 skin.
homeworld,3dn2bj,Kiita-Ninetails,2,Sat Jul 18 00:00:05 2015 UTC,"Its a lot more than the formations everyone keeps bitching about.  They just skinned HW1 ships in the HW2 engine, and nothing FEELS right.  The fleet scaling is as cancerous as it is in HW2, the DPS escalation means Cap ships rule and strike craft suck just as they did in HW2, resourcers and resourcing is shoehorned into the HW2 model, so that's very cumbersome, and frankly, they didn't even fix all the dialogue so you hear assault frigates call themselves flak frigates.  Additionally, formations don't really work, and the loss of ship management wasn't replaced by the increased ease of handling of squadrons.    I'm not happy with the game.  I still had my old discs, so it's not like getting it on steam was particularly helpful."
homeworld,3dn2bj,SeriousSpy,2,Sat Jul 18 05:00:56 2015 UTC,"I would clarify that the main issue is that for a lot of people they preferred how HW1 did things, so they find the fact that everything is done like HW2 a major issue.  Personally I think HW2 did literally everything better than the first one, from ship design to storyline. So I have no complaints about the first one being improved to the standard of the second one.  Though even with that said, they could use a few tweaks to damage/HP/Ai and stuff here and there."

homeworld,3dn2bj,Kiita-Ninetails,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:35:50 2015 UTC,"So, as a campaign player, you would not be affected by the engine issues. Campaigns allow you to not worry about how a battle gets done as much, but only that it does in fact get done. So you can focus on macromanagement and plot without having to worry about micro mechanics. And that's great, the HW1 and 2 campaigns are pretty well set now.  For multiplayer, micromanagement is huge. HW1 micro versus HW2 micro is extremely different, and it's not fun to play HW1 multiplayer with HW2 micro rules. It's as simple as that. No fun? No players."
homeworld,3dn2bj,Zoloir,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:15:04 2015 UTC,I disagree as someone that has a couple hundred multiplayer game played. (Mostly ones where I know everyone on mumble) even vanilla is fine. Though I did opt to make a mod that groups HW1 fighters into wings simply because it bothered me visually that they were not.
homeworld,3dn2bj,Kiita-Ninetails,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:33:19 2015 UTC,"Well then, preferences are preferences. It would seem you are the minority unless multiplayer is suddenly full of people."
homeworld,3dn2bj,Zoloir,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:05:34 2015 UTC,"Well there is issues, just what you described is not that issue. The issues are twofold.  First: People are either nonstalgic for the way HW1 worked, or actually prefer it so do not take to well to the lack of formations and stuff.  Second: The balance is a bit out of whack between HW1 and HW2 races due to various engine issues like non non strike craft grouped fighters always lose to an equivalent amount of fighters that are in a proper wing. And that the capital ships are a tad wonky.  But the micro and stuff is really not a problem at all. Its just engine, balance, and nonstalgia issues."
homeworld,3dn2bj,captaincupcake234,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:00:06 2015 UTC,"If that's your opinion, then I can only assume that you never cared to micro your ships in the classic homeworld, so you would not be able to judge the difference anyways.   The formations is only a small fraction of the overall changes. For instance, the only advantage to a HW2 wing is that you can recall with one ship and have it replenish to 5.  HW1 wings are really completely pointless unless the ballistics are fixed. In fact I wager a swarm is more effective than a wing with an RNG because at least maybe there will be more turret rotation time, if that is even a thing, and it might be harder to target specific types of ships.  As for cap ships, well, they just don't behave well, and the whole torpedoes nonsense just makes it a proximity matchup rather than a tactical positioning battle."

Hopefully the bugs have been fixed, but the experience was bad enough that I've never loaded the game back up."
homeworld,3dn2bj,Gopherlad,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:54:45 2015 UTC,"I ran into all kinds of bugs when I played HW1 remastered last week. The game would forget formations, or drop some ships out of formations at random. Moving a group would occasionally cause one or two ships to fly off straight up, away from the rest of their group. With paths turned on, I could see that the paths went straight up off map. I had to keep reassigning groups or re-issuing move orders to prevent problems.  The Supernova mission where you are supposed to hide in dust clouds to avoid radiation destroying your ships? The dust clouds are not visible. I disabled antialiasing (the supposed ""fix""), and I still couldn't see them. This has been listed as a known issue for several patches.  The worst bug for me, though, came in the final mission, where I could not finish off the final enemy, because my ships refused to move past a certain point on the map. I had to sit there helplessly and watch my AI allies finish the game for me. Really pissed me off. At that point I didn't even bother reloading to try again.  Because of all those problems, I'm not even going to try playing Homeworld 2. I'm very disappointed. The game looks gorgeous, but it still has many, many bugs even after a half dozen post-release patches."
homeworld,3dn2bj,badken,2,Sat Jul 18 06:04:37 2015 UTC,"HW2 was actually remastered really well, since all that needed to be done was essentially a graphics update (and all the support code behind it). If you liked HW2's campaign, you'll be very satisfied with its remaster."

homeworld,3dk8iv,EwanWhoseArmy,4,Thu Jul 16 23:04:49 2015 UTC,"The scaling is to counter snowballing since, unlike in most RTS, your troops aren't reset between missions, which means strong players can accumulate a bigger and bigger advantage while weak players will run out of air and may have to go 1-2 missions back and try to finish with more ships remaining.  That makes balancing really difficult. HW1 didn't have any settings at all IIRC and was just balanced along a median, HWC had a slider and HW2 (which HWR builds on) tried to scale the difficulty with your fleet strength. Problem is it only scales the enemy fleet and not objectives like those you've listed, which really hurts HW1R because HW1 had not been originally designed with that feature in mind."
homeworld,3dk8iv,MarikBentusi,3,Fri Jul 17 08:53:58 2015 UTC,I then got bored with a trainer   well there you go... fleet scaling is dynamic difficulty and it makes sure that players are eventually forced to lose large portions of their fleet no matter how well they're playing. it just so happens to also prevent excessive cheating.

homeworld,3dk8iv,NotYourITGuyDotOrg,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:06:05 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what happened to me during my playthrough of HW1R. I  had a large fleeting going into the ""Sea of Lost Souls"" and somehow managed to disable the ghost ship, which netted me another 30+ frigates. Well once I got to the supernova research station, I lost almost all of my frigates to radiation.   Also case in point, if you screw with the dynamic difficulty too much by being exceptionally good at not losing ships, eventually you will run into a mission that is impossible to complete because of what the AI gets to start with. I know of at least one missions in HW2 that if you went into it with too much, Makaan pretty much gets a dozen battle cruisers and ROFL-stomps you into space dust."

homeworld,3dk8iv,grogleberry,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:09:13 2015 UTC,"You just need to be clever how you pick your engagements.  Eg. the Ghost Ship. You take any anti-fighter strike craft attack from one side, feint in and out repeatedly, until you pull the ships out of position.  Then just stroll in with your bombers and attack completely unhindered.  I probably lost 6 or 7 light corvettes against the Ghost Ship fleet and maybe a couple of scouts.."
homeworld,3dk8iv,kioni,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:40:02 2015 UTC,"Except the first time I wasn't cheating, I was just being clever and managed to salvage most of the Kadeshi frigates from the Garden (A load of salvage corvettes escorted with a load of multi-guns makes them untouchable to swarmers)   Also is it Cheating to use the ghostship to let me bust the destroyer limit (i.e deliberately send a pair of destroyers into the field, build 2 more and then get the others back?)"
homeworld,3dk8iv,Apollo821,2,Fri Jul 17 06:36:28 2015 UTC,"would you rather cruise through most of the game with your commandeered frigates? it's up to you if you want to play it like a survivalist or as a minmax power fantasy, but they chose fleet retainment and dynamic difficulty for the series and I think it fits thematically. the more you put in, the more the game challenges you, and you're choosing the hardest difficulty. it has its pros and cons but the point of it is clear I think. sea of lost souls shouldn't be impossible, you can always lure away the ships as far as they'll go and then flood the ghost ship with as many bombers as possible. retire some frigates if you're poor."
homeworld,3dk8iv,YourProgrammerFriend,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:25:32 2015 UTC,I figured out that if I get a load of recons to fly in and out of the trigger zone on waypoints (they can bug out before a missile can reach them) the fleet gets pulled away.

homeworld,3dk8iv,grogleberry,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:26:35 2015 UTC,"the scaling occurs at the start of a level, so if you want to game it then starting each mission with the fewest amount of ships will give you an easier time."

homeworld,3czjge,Lord_An00bis,2,Sun Jul 12 05:11:05 2015 UTC,They have a set flight range so they'll retarget to something that was part of the initial attack orders. They'll explode if they don't reach a target in range.
homeworld,3czjge,tilsitforthenommage,2,Sun Jul 12 18:47:30 2015 UTC,"So they will only target enemies that were included in the bandbox attack command that launched them? If it is flight range, as opposed to radial distance from the firing point, does this mean that having your torpedo/missile ships closer to the battle will allow them to more efficiently make use of the retargeting feature?"
homeworld,3czjge,tilsitforthenommage,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:22:31 2015 UTC,That's my understanding
homeworld,3czjge,HorrificAnalInjuries,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:35:03 2015 UTC,"This is correct.  Missiles have a set flight range and will attack targets they are originally set upon first, then any others that are within range.  That said, some self-propelled munitions will actually die off once the original target dies. Included: any Vaygr light missile; launched from either frigate missile funnels or from the Missile Corvette, and the Torpedo Frigate's splinter torpedo AFTER it has splintered.  If the original target dies before the splinter torpedo has a chance to split, it will retarget like the anti-capital version."
homeworld,3ciwxj,Fluffythedaedra,1 point,Wed Jul 8 07:05:49 2015 UTC,"I think you're trying to capture past the unit cap. Unlike HW1, HW2 doesn't allow you to capture past the unit cap for any given ship type, so if you have already maxed out the number of frigates you can have, your marine frigates won't be able to capture any more frigates. All they'll do in that situation is attempt to attach long enough to temporarily disable the target ship. The same goes for any of the other ship types, i.e. destroyers and battlecruisers."
homeworld,3ciwxj,achensherd,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:42:41 2015 UTC,OP's problem is that they just won't try to capture.  At all.  OP should send a short clip (fraps should still have a free version that'll capture up to 30 seconds of film) to Gearbox with as much information as possible.

I have just completed a plaything of HW1. I switched back to the original game rather than the re-mastered though for nostalgia reasons.   Non spoiler hint for Higara: You are strictly limited in the number of support frigates you can build so build lots of repair corvettes as well to get more healing.

homeworld,3cgbzn,ralfp,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:12:51 2015 UTC,"I found that HW2 motto was ""who dares wins"". This meant Vaygr will swarm relentlessly and ultimately will overrun you, so you have to push for key targets (carriers, shipyards, battlecruisers) nonstop while having support units cover your hitting force for long enough for them to take down that target before onslaught brings you down.  When I've played HW2 same way I've played first, I was brutally crushed in third mission too, but when I've started playing super aggressively, I've had trouble only on Thaddis Sabbah mission which for a change expects you to just survive wave after wave as they are getting more ridiculous (7 vaygr battlecruisers with 4 destroyers, anyone?), and then just jump out."

homeworld,3c1700,HorrificAnalInjuries,2,Sat Jul 4 03:32:13 2015 UTC,"His ""review"" of the remake was a little shitty.  He mentions how important a non-scaling enemy was to the original, then comments that the only fault he finds with the remake is that it doesn't have sphere formation.    NONE of the formations feel right in the remake, and it suffers from the same exponential damage escalation that the second game does.  I also don't think that the voice acting in game was nearly as good in the remake as it was in the original.  I have a hard time believing that gearbox has as much respect for the series as the fans do when they basically reskinned HW2 to make HW1:R."

homeworld,3bdraa,quraid,16,Sun Jun 28 06:49:55 2015 UTC,"Ok, after researching this issue for nearly a week, i end up solving it just an hour of posting a reddit thread. Funny how life works...  So here is the root cause: The game needs some new OpenGl libs. Intel has added support for the required OpenGL libraries in the jan2015+ driver updates. However, if you have a laptop or pc manufactured by any 3rd party (Lenovo, dell etc), your drivers probably haven't been updated for a long time.   Using the Intels driver update utility does nothing. If you use the lenovo or dell updates, they will also never show any update. I realized that my system had pretty old Intel drivers after opening sys info and checking the actual driver version. So I went to Intel's site and just downloaded the latest display drivers. Trying to manually install drivers from Intel site, giver error message.  However, I was able to force te install after a bit of googling.  To solve the issues, visit this link and follow the steps to override the existing OEM drivers. http://steamcommunity.com/app/233250/discussions/2/558749190911446231/  For me, this fixed the game and now i can actually see the menu."

homeworld,3bdt3g,soulassassino,2,Sun Jun 28 08:45:34 2015 UTC,It happens in HW1 too. If you capture more than one it often bugs out and gives you no credits or ships for doing so and getting all 3 extra frigates can take multiple loads.  It also often bugged out if you salvaged all the cryotrays often getting stuck after saying 600'000 people secured.
homeworld,3bdt3g,ViralHatred,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:03:07 2015 UTC,wasn't that the number of people in cryo though?
homeworld,3bdt3g,Muronelkaz,2,Tue Jul 7 19:39:43 2015 UTC,One is meant to be destroyed. You're only supposed to be able to save five of them. Which is why one of them starts off at half-health and is being attacked by a frigate constantly regardless of if you grab it with a salvette.  If you grab it with a salvage corvette one/two frigates will keep pummelling that cryotray and the others will blast at your corvette unless they're engaged with other craft.

homeworld,3bctmh,Dodiestee,2,Sun Jun 28 00:23:59 2015 UTC,"Two things:  1) HW:R has fleet-based difficulty scaling; this means that if you have a meager fleet, the AI will send a moderately sized force at you. If you have a large fleet, the enemy will send startlingly massive waves of enemies at you. You're better served keeping your fleet at moderate size and decent mix of ships until you're confident enough in your tactics/ability to control your fleet effectively enough to handle several groups of ships the size of your entire fleet at max capacity. It isn't impossible, but in the last few missions it is quite challenging, even for a veteran of the originals.  2) You don't have to gather resources at the end of the mission. As you jump out, you will get the message ""Resources Collected"" across your screen. This is also the point in the game where resources start to become plentiful,even to the point of being able to lose most of your fleet over the course of the mission, and leaving the area with a population limit fleet. Gathering in the middle of the mission is obviously still a good idea, but it will soon become a moot point as you near the end of the game.     It sounds to me like you're having a rip-roaring good time, and I look forward to hearing your final thoughts on the game/s when you do finally reach the end of your journey. If you ever feel like testing your skills online, I'd be happy to be your sparring partner. I haven't played online since HW2 was still relatively new, and have only done single player since remastered released."
homeworld,3bctmh,HunterFett117,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:13:32 2015 UTC,"For the first point. I was having some difficulty with one of the later missions and did something I haven't had to do in a long time...I consulted a FAQ for some general guidance. It was here I discovered this game mechanic, which I appreciate for the reasons at the end of this part of my perspective. No matter how well I think Im doing, I am still vastly outgunned and remain just a fleeing race skirting around an Empire's armada.  For the second point. This was something I noticed early on but mostly I tend to stick around and mine the resources so that I may replenish my numbers, I'd hate to jump into the next fleet with barely a battle group and 16k resources. I realise however that the two points you raised coincide, and that even with the meagre elements I sometimes have left, the game isnt going to brutalise me for it. I guess it's just my contribution to the story in playing, desperately trying to use what reaources I can scavenge in an attempt to adequately protect what I have left. I'd say its adding to the plot. I'll remember these particular game mechanics for my inevitable second playthrough when I can take some experience with me.  I definitely am enjoyong every moment, even the tedious parts are fine, getting me to the next part of the story. I wont touch the multiplayer until I have completed HW2 I imagine, but then I'd certainly enjoy some regular games. My Steam name is Dodiestee, so feel free to add me."
homeworld,3bctmh,boredatworkbasically,2,Mon Jun 29 07:34:16 2015 UTC,"here's something you could try. The AI likes to chase things. If you have a target, like a juicy alien vessel that is controlling nearby frigates and such hint hint, one of the best things to do is to use a scout to draw the defenses away from the alien vessel. While they are chasing your scout send in every strikecraft you have and have them attack your target. You will lose some strikecraft but you will more then make up for it in sexy new ships once they are liberated. (you might have missed out on that. Any of the vessels controlled by the ghost ship become yours once you do enough damage to it). This tactic of getting frigates and destroyers to chase much much smaller and faster craft will be very very very useful to you in a few missions when you run up against what appears to be insurmountable odds."
homeworld,3bctmh,Liambp,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:07:50 2015 UTC,"Im currently on the Bridge of Sighs and have taken to using this strategy, mostly because I'm wanting as large a fleet as possible for the next missions. I get a sense they are going to be quite the challenge! Any other good generic advice for the later levels without going into particular details will be appreciated."
homeworld,3bctmh,captaincupcake234,2,Mon Jun 29 07:10:13 2015 UTC,"Some advice for later missions:   Bridge of Sighs: Take your time and use salvaging to stock up for final two missions. Cloak generators allow you to sneak up on ships with salvage corvettes but beware pockets of strike craft as they will shoot off your salvagers. Save often because it is easy to slip up here and lose a lot of ships. It is worth recycling some ion frigates to build more useful stuff (support frigates and destroyers). Cheap trick (works on original Homeworld don't know if it works on remastered) Send a probe through the middle and out the other side and you can get the ball of frigates to follow it away from the centre. With a couple of attempts you can get the centre almost entirely exposed.   Chapel Perilous: Massive firepower required here in a race against time. You can pick up a few nice goodies with salvaging as well though. Tailor your final build for the last mission. Maximise your healing (support frigates and repair corvettes), Then maximise your damage (destroyers if possible, try to have a few missile destroyers around for strike craft). Consider recycling anything you don't need but keep at least one resource gatherrer.   Higara: I don't think it is too much of a spoiler to say that the enemy will throw everything they have got against your mother-ship. You need maximum healing to keep it alive until you can reduce the opposing forces.Manually controlling your destroyers and frigate groups to focus fire works well here. Mine layers are quite useful. There are quite a lot resources scattered around the map so start gathering and replace any losses."
homeworld,3bctmh,Liambp,2,Mon Jun 29 09:14:01 2015 UTC,"Awesome description!  My first HW game was Cataclysm since I couldn't find the original HW many years ago.  Anyway. I currently beat HW:R and here is my tip for using salvage corvettes. I usually send in a contingent of heavy corvettes in front of my salvage corvettes so they take the brunt of a large capital ship I'm about to steal (say a cruiser). So while the capital ship is busy trying to pick off my heavy corvettes, the salvage corvettes steal the ship. I captured 5 cruisers, 6 destroyers and numerous ion cannon frigates (Bridge of Sighs) this way across the game.   If any heavy cruisers survived, I have them escort the salvage corvettes back."
homeworld,3bctmh,Liambp,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:07:42 2015 UTC,I am very much enjoying your Homeworld walkthrough so please keep up the posts. I first played Homeworld 15 years ago and it has remained one of my all time favourite games ever since. I have played the game and its sequels several times  so is impossible for me to give an unbiased opinion and I suspect the same is true for many other veterans. That is why it is so refreshing to hear a new comers views. The game can be brutally hard and perhaps this is a flaw but it can give great satisfaction when you finally overcome those tricky missions. Some old timers delight in boasting how easy the game is for then but that comes from knowing the strategies that work. I have just finished a re-play of Homeworld classic myself. I still enjoy it greatly but I had forgotten just how much patience the game requires. To much I suspect for a large part of the modern gaming audience. I myself got frustrated when I had to wait half an hour or more for a large fleet to move into position or for a resourcer to stock up. I longed to tab out and do something else while I waited but sadly the 1999 game refuses to run in a background mode.
homeworld,3bctmh,HunterFett117,1 point,Sun Jun 28 07:04:32 2015 UTC,"The patience aspect is one of the most frustrating aspects for me so far. The huge maps and slow ships, while immersing, can be such a drain on my attention span. I find myself only really tackling 1 mission at a time right now, especially since the difficulty is increasing with every mission. I'll probably expand on this in part 3, but the thing I tend to forget is that this is an older game where longevity was a desirable trait in video games."

I think way back in the day when HW came out and I was young I went about capturing everything I could but honestly it just made the game feel too easy. I don't even build salvage corvettes except for the few times when you need them. I also instantly retire the ships you get from the ghost ship mission. In the original HW it was a little bit harder to pull off but in remastered you have so many resources that you could cap out your fleet multiple times by the end of the game.
homeworld,3b8nfu,boredatworkbasically,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:36:33 2015 UTC,Yeah it really isn't THAT hard :P
homeworld,3b8nfu,WaylanderTS,3,Sat Jun 27 01:13:03 2015 UTC,This just gave me an idea: I'm going to do the opposite. Try to play through the majority of the game ONLY using captured ships.

homeworld,3b8nfu,Evvekk,1 point,Fri Jun 26 23:58:07 2015 UTC,I would think not capturing would be the easier method with the current fleet scaling.  You would have massive amounts of resources to work with for rebuilding lost ships and wouldn't care about losing anything you may have captured.

I would probably also try multigun corvettes or maybe mine layers before just restarting an earlier game but honestly I don't remember anything but enjoying the fireworks of punching through a stupid sphere of ion frigates with my at that point huge grand theft spaceship armada.
homeworld,3b190h,Arctovigil,3,Thu Jun 25 10:09:45 2015 UTC,"It's a bit finnicky, but I like to approach the sphere slowwwwwly, inch forward enough and you should be able to get 1 frigate after you. Lead him away from the sphere, capture, repeat as necessary."
homeworld,3b190h,montymintypie,3,Thu Jun 25 07:55:12 2015 UTC,"Make a small squad of scouts. Send them towards the sphere. A detachment of enemy ion frigates will leave the sphere to attack the scouts. Draw them back to a staging area in front of you mothership, where your 14 salvagettes are waiting. When the scouts get there, put them in passive and send the salvettes in 2 at a time to grab the incoming ion frigates, if you get the staging area the right distance you can easily cycle them back and forth. If too many ion frigates approach, have the scout group attack the nearest ion frigate. They are very evasive and will last ages while you harvest the frigates. The enemy AI should keep attacking the scouts."
homeworld,3b190h,Tritone_666,2,Thu Jun 25 13:36:53 2015 UTC,"Send 2-4 corvettes to capture closest ion frigate, they will grab it and tow it to the mother ship. Some other frigates will get in pursuit, let them gain distance from sphere and send more corvettes from midpoint to capture them. Make sure only your corvettes  are between sphere and mothership. Corvettes will be mostly fine against ion frigates. If there are not enough Salvage corvettes, attach only one to some frigates, they will be disabled and most probably unable to harm anything. Once some corvettes will be free after capturing first frigate, send them to grab these held ships.  Only problem here is a vast fleet of fighters AI have. I had some assault frigates, used gravity well generator to wipe these fighters without any trouble.  Once you trigger destroyers from the center of the sphere to go after you, use salvage corvettes to hold down them starting from last ones. Once 1-2 corvettes will hold down last destroyer let rest destroyers gain some distance and attach 1-2 corvettes to last again. That way last destroyer will be unable to harm corvettes holding next destroyer. That way you can capture up-to 11 destroyers (10 are held down by corvettes, while 1 is captured using 4 corvettes). Use fighters to destroy cloack generators protecting destroyers."
homeworld,3b190h,thewataru,2,Thu Jun 25 11:47:42 2015 UTC,"As others have said, distracting the frigates with other ships works wonders. Destroyers with support friagtes healing will work. Remember there are a ton of frigates, you can kill a few each time instead of trying to capture all of them. Also keep an eye out, at some point a carrier and several resource collectors should come out of the circle. Easy pickings."

In the remastered, you can only make 14 salvage converts which can make things a bit trickier. Also, don't bother stealing the ion cannon frigates (at least not more than the max you can possibly make) they aren't that great ether. What you should do though is steal every capital ship you can. Destroyers, missile destroyers, and heavy cruisers. If you steal and have too many total ships, the enemy scales to impossible numbers in the 2 final missions.

homeworld,3aoqfv,Cleverbird,4,Mon Jun 22 06:58:38 2015 UTC,"they fixed them in the last patch. you need to select your support frigates and bandbox the repair command on the units you want them to repair. then, don't give them any other commands otherwise you'll break the repair order. they'll follow the ships and repair any damage.  as for effectiveness, they're weaker than they were in hw1 since their healing rate is unchanged but damage and health numbers have gone up considerably in remastered. I find them okay in the early game but after that their usefulness drops off a bit."
homeworld,3aoqfv,kioni,2,Mon Jun 22 09:34:21 2015 UTC,"So if I bandbox the repair thingy across my ships, will they start following those ships around, even if they're undamaged? And what about priority, is the game smart enough for them to prioritize ships that are on lower health?"
homeworld,3aoqfv,kioni,3,Mon Jun 22 09:35:11 2015 UTC,"yes to the first question. I'm not sure about the second question, they seem to but it could be incidental. plus you might not always want them to try to save the lowest health ship, because more often than not they won't be able to, especially if you aren't actively moving the damaged ship out of the fight.  the support frigate isn't nearly as powerful as the support ships in sins, where they're almost essential due to their usefulness. I usually only build them right after I unlock their research and right before I research better ships to use my production and resources on. they're really good when they can outheal the enemy, but as the game progresses they feel more obsolete."
homeworld,3aoqfv,kioni,1 point,Mon Jun 22 10:10:03 2015 UTC,"I'll have to give that a try... Sins has taught me that you always want a few repair vessels in your backline, but with the way reactive fleets work in the HW campaigns, I feel that losing anything below frigate class isnt all that bad."

homeworld,3aoqfv,Xercodo,2,Mon Jun 22 11:50:18 2015 UTC,"odd since sins doesn't have a campaign.  if you're asking for an advice answer, I don't have one. you should play how you want to play.  if you're asking for a mechanical/power-gamer answer, investing in more firepower is always going to be faster, repairing isn't necessary to win. if you really want to save ships from destruction you can pull them out of combat and they'll be repaired by the next mission. if you couldn't manage to pull them out in time then you probably couldn't have managed to save them with repair either. other details vary with the different versions but lead to the same result of it not being too useful."
homeworld,3aoqfv,kioni,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:53:41 2015 UTC,odd since sins doesn't have a campaign.   Oh I thought you were referring to the MP of HW... I've only touched upon the AI in Sins.

A cruiser and two frigates is not going to get you through the next three missions (especially if you've somehow mismanaged your fleet enough to this point that that's all you have left.) You need to go back several missions and make conserving your forces a top priority.
homeworld,3ap0h6,Jujubean5,4,Mon Jun 22 15:47:58 2015 UTC,"Remember I am playing the original Homeworld not the remastered version. The original Homeworld doesn't automatically collect all salvage at the end of each mission you have to wait for a resourcer to do it. I have played and finished the game several times already so I am doing a ""lean"" play through deliberately not waiting for all resources to be collected and also deliberately not abusing salvage corvettes. It makes for an interesting game and is very doable. I have to laugh when I read all those walkthroughs saying you need 20 Destroyers and 50  Salvage Corvettes for for every level. You don't. You can get buy with a much smaller number of well managed ships. I will need to build up a good fleet for the last two levels but Bridge of sighs is next which is basically free frigates so I can get as much as needed from there."

homeworld,3ans06,kioni,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:19:05 2015 UTC,"As of right now though, under every other circumstance my squads are being fully heal.  So it must be a bug of some kind related to the transition between those missions.  If they are looking into doing things that way, it's internally, they haven't patched it into the game yet.  Dunno if I like that that change either.  If they plan to do away with squadron heal.... How would one replenish a squad?  Doesn't seem very useful to just heal the health bar of whatever few stragglers actually survive. You are still operating with a weakling squad (sometimes one left) that will probably get blown to bits in no time.  If the damage they took spread across the whole squad I guess it would kind of make sense... Otherwise if you want to keep a full squad you would have to dock them after only 1 or 2 get partially damaged and the rest are probably still full health."

There have been promises of balance itteration, but it keeps getting moved back due to a desire to get certain balance-disruptive feature patches done first.   I would say that multiplayer is definitely playable, and there are mods that retune it heavily if you find the existing balance unsatisfying."
homeworld,3a2v4j,EatThePath,3,Tue Jun 16 20:27:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the answer! Seems like I had a wrong image of the game because I saw some people so mad about the game, their view is nearly apocalyptic compared to what you're telling me."
homeworld,3a2v4j,pheylan-cavanaugh,5,Tue Jun 16 21:39:00 2015 UTC,"They are an extremely vocal, dedicated minority. Because the game didn't port HW1 perfectly, they are incredibly upset, and this creates the image that HWR is somehow horrible/broken/bugged, when that is simply not true.  It's just not HW1."
homeworld,3a2v4j,AlixX979,2,Tue Jun 16 22:22:51 2015 UTC,"The game is very playable as it is, but if you play multiplayer a couple of times with the balance they have now it gets stale fast.

I am not raging about HW1 or what ever but in general, I have not even touched the singleplayer stuff i play RTS games for multiplayer."

While some people will tell you the game is worthless trash because of the HW1 port issues, that's not because it won't run or because it's impossible to get games."

homeworld,3a1e0r,bakhesh,9,Tue Jun 16 13:50:13 2015 UTC,"There are a ton of differences unfortunately.   The balancing of almost all the ships is entirely off making it a race to get the largest ship.   Can't band select with salvagers.  Formations don't work.   Ship's Don't seem to know what to do when facing strike craft,  they often turn away and out of the firing arc for some of their weapons.  Every other mission there is an issue with triggers that screw the whole thing up.   Reactive fleet scaling makes it near impossible to play some missions.   Sensors manager visuals are screwy.  Research costs resources instead of just taking time.     There is more but most of it is a disappointing result of moving it to the homeworld 2 engine."
homeworld,3a1e0r,RDBRULZ,3,Tue Jun 16 15:59:12 2015 UTC,"Near impossible? My first time at Higara was literally impossible. My fleet was so big that their reactivly huge fleet would stroll up to my mothership and blow it up before my bigger ships could get in to defend. This was before they patched salvage corvettes to be able to heal the mothership, so it was also impossible to heal it. The solution? Go back to the Bridge of Sighs save, retire half the fleet, come back in, and win without trying.   Homeworld 1, at least the single player campaign, was very, very broken. More than minor annoyances. That being said, Classic worked flawlessly."

I find the multiplayer to work just fine for what I do with it, I found that Homeworld 1 remastered was far better than HW1 classic. (Mostly because I hated formations when they were a thing, I wish they just used squadrons of fighters too.)   For me this game was not incomplete at all, and was in fact almost exactly what I wanted. So why should I complain its incomplete based on someone else's defenition of complete?  I got EXACTLY what I wanted out of this, which was HW1 in the HW2 engine with all that entails and multiplayer that actually works with my friends."

homeworld,3a06uh,kioni,0,Tue Jun 16 20:43:33 2015 UTC,"Cool, but by my definition the game is still not broken at all, I got everything I asked for with my money so why should I say gearbox delivered a broken product when from my perspective its quite good.(Also I play normal MP as well and have not had any real issues with it.)  The problem is aside from obvious, terrible bugs like the game simply not working at all 'broken' is pretty subjective. Formations, for example. They are not 'broken' they were just not included yet everyone still went ""OH MY GOD BROKEN GAME 0/10"" (That was a Dramitization of real events)"
homeworld,3a06uh,Kiita-Ninetails,2,Tue Jun 16 20:50:55 2015 UTC,"That's nice but I don't represent that opinion either. I said incomplete, and even gearbox devs agree if you look at their posts. Many ships in the game are over/underperforming, and understanding those problems demolishes the idea that you're playing a fair match. The people whining about formations will never be pleased and are complicating everything by misrepresenting the actual problems and creating a convenient strawman for people to bash down."
homeworld,3a06uh,kioni,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:54:34 2015 UTC,"Hmm, you do have a point in that regard. But I get so frustrated sometimes with the people bashing every little bit because its not perfect.

Jon Anderson wrote the song specifically for the game when he heard about the story concept. As I understand, Gearbox could not acquire the rights. However, the internet always provides and you can enjoy these original credits when you finally beat the game.   Also, formations working was the greatest thing. Going back and working with the (honestly really terrible) original UI is almost worth it just to put your fleet in aggressive sphere formation and watch them surround an enemy from all sides and obliterate them with a 360 degree volley.

It's heartwarming to read about the story rising above those complaints and still sucking people as well, and in the same ways, as it pulled me in. Your experience there is very similar to my memories of my experiences with the game fifteen years ago. The setup, presentation, voice-acting, and everything for that moment comes together perfectly to drive home the emotion, and once that hook is in the game drags you along for everything else."
homeworld,39wczr,EatThePath,3,Mon Jun 15 19:07:05 2015 UTC,"I think half the appeal for me is that the games central idea of saving a now depleted race after an alien attack and seeking out sanctuary while being stalked across the galaxy is found in Battlestar, my now favourite TV show. So to play a game that follows that idea while at the same time masterfully hitting me with an authentically superb story, voice acting and game play mechanics. It's everything I've been looking for in a game recently, and after the extensive research I did on the games current build, I'm so glad I decided to buy.

homeworld,39xk6g,Doctor_Mod,2,Mon Jun 15 16:50:30 2015 UTC,"Advice/Tips  1) Salvagers are your friend. Grand Theft Spaceship is how most of us got through HW Classic and how I played HW Remastered on my first playthrough.  2) Keep an eye on enemy fleets for higher tech ships than you have researched. Then proceed with tip 1.   3) Play about until you learn what makes the enemy AI tick, can make certain missions, particularly your next one, easier with some creative thinking.   4) Don't build any more Interceptors from now on, because:  Cryptic Warnings:  1) Mission 5, higher tech. Lots of higher tech.   2) Playing Asteroids is best done with both Assault and Ion Frigates.   3) If you can't join 'em, beat 'em. Please note over-exposure to quad ion beams can be bad for you health! See also: Not the bees!  4) If there's something strange, and it don't look good, who you gonna call? Ghostbusters! They carry Plasma bombs.   5) Supernovas and Heavy Cruisers are VERY bad for your health.   6) DON'T. FEED. THE DOG."
homeworld,39xk6g,Plumbership,2,Mon Jun 15 18:19:46 2015 UTC,"Resources are automatically collected at the end if every mission, so don't worry about that too much.  HW1 salvage corvettes are definitely your best friend. You should be able to capture ships you can't even build yet in some missions.  When you do end up building larger capital ships en masse, you can get them more quickly to the front by having them hyperspace jump to a location as soon as you can control them; hyperspace modules actually create a small bubble around the super-capital class ship that has them so that any frigate class ship or larger may use hyperspace.   A mixed fleet will ALWAYS be useful. Fighters beat other fighters, bombers can take out anything frigate sized and up, corvettes can take out other corvettes, some of them frigates, and so on. It may seem a little wasteful at first to keep yourself stocked on fighters when they die so easily. The reality is, they're taking fire bigger, more expensive ships would otherwise end up taking, and they provide extra DPS.   Formations are useful still, though still broken compared to the original. There may be moments where you would rather have your fighters lead the way, or perhaps you'd rather have your frigates lead the charge, or maybe you just generally want as many guns to arrive at once as you can... These can all be accomplished by choosing formations. Also, I believe ships in formation do receive a slight damage boost, but it isn't nearly the stunning coordinated fire it used to be. Useful, but you will also want to disband formations from time to time to make sure the your entire fleet joins the fray rather than just the ships up front while others try to hold a formation.  When it comes to HW2, salvage is significantly less effective. This is unfortunate, but compensated for by you producing squadrons of strike craft rather than singles. This is why HW2 races do have a decided advantage in multiplayer, but all races are viable.  Also in HW2, when it comes to enemy battle cruisers, destroying their engines will help you not get obliterated by that devastating main cannon they have. Keep your own capital ships moving, staying away from the front of the enemy BC. They can and will still hit you with missile salvos from that damn missile battery which you can no longer target (grumble grumble) but the damage output is significantly lower if they're not also chewing you up with the main guns.  Having a carrier or two with your attack fleet is never really a BAD idea. The carrier does allow strike craft to repair, and carriers do have minimal point defense guns, so they don't just provide huge targets.  Platforms are great for securing a position against an enemy force, but make sure you set them to aggressive tactics, otherwise they wait to get shot at before shooting.  Finally, when it comes time for the last mission, my cryptic advice is to be scary aggressive. Like, breakneck aggressive. Like, ""FIRE EVERYTHING"" style. Even at this, the last mission can be quite challenging, but the sense of satisfaction upon completion is fantastic.  Once you've completed the campaign, take a good, long look at classic HW2 mods, then some of the ones we already have out for remastered. Remember that gearbox is working with modders to make sure this game stays active at least as long as HW2 classic did, and it still isn't entirely dead.  Welcome to The Homeworld community, and please enjoy your stay."

I know that doesn't happen for everyone, some people can launch it no problem, but there are definitely still major issues with this game."

If you go in with a maxed out fleet the Vaygr will have more battlecruisers than you have frigates and the trinity cannon shells will be flying thick enough to walk across.  It's a test of your ability to manage aggro, fleet replenishment, and multiple large simultaneous engagements. I love it. I have gone in and edited my fleet beyond the unit cap just to make it bigger and crazier.  I want more like that."

A king of the hill, you got to take and hold an area like a hyperspace gate to allow or prevent reinforcements.  Resource rush, you have a lot of resources and you have to meet a quota to fund the war. Baddies doing the same.

One of the things I loved about Cataclysm was the background lore of the new Hiigarans being resource strapped and in a very precarious position immediately post-landfall.  I'd like to play a mini-campaign where I am the commander of say a Kiith Paktu Carrier battlegroup. You can only build strike craft and frigates, and find yourself up against the Raiders & Taidani ala Catalcysm, who usually have heavier firepower. Maybe you get one or two Destroyers/Cruisers over the campaign as reinforcements from your Kiith leaders, but that's it.

The fleet will hyperspace in the path of the retreating Attack Carriers and must destroy them to prevent them reaching the defences of the planetoid, which cannot be defeated. Once the enemy fleet is prevented from reaching the planetoid, Fleet Intelligence announces a return to the original objective of finding the Taiidan Empire fleet that destroyed Kharak.

homeworld,390veg,EatThePath,2,Mon Jun 8 13:22:40 2015 UTC,I hope they re-add it to classic. Considering they have the sourcecode for HWC they have no excuse not to.
homeworld,390veg,ViralHatred,3,Mon Jun 8 16:48:36 2015 UTC,Besides all the extra work depending on the format difference between HW1 and HW2 engines.
homeworld,390veg,halofreak7777,2,Mon Jun 8 19:22:54 2015 UTC,Which various interviews indicated was non-trivial.
homeworld,390veg,werewolf_nr,1 point,Mon Jun 8 20:40:40 2015 UTC,I figured that much personally. People think games are simple when they are not. Oh it would be so easy for the devs to do X why haven't they? Because X isn't easy...  Source: I;m a Programmer.
homeworld,390veg,halofreak7777,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:55:46 2015 UTC,"Hence why I said 'I hope they re-add it to classic' not 'I hope they re-add it to remastered.'  If someone can turn HW1 into a flight sim with that sourcecode I'm pretty sure Gearbox can easily add Raider Retreat.  Also Raider Retreat was a simple mission so it wouldn't be hard to put it into HW2's engine either, also HW1 maps can be easily converted to HW2 see: http://www.homeworldaccess.net/downloads.php?cat_id=8&download_id=99"
homeworld,390veg,ViralHatred,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:20:59 2015 UTC,"Just because something can be done doesn't mean it is easy. Which is the mistake everyone makes that my post up above points out.

homeworld,390veg,halofreak7777,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:54:44 2015 UTC,"Porting HW maps to HW2 = Easy, this is confirmed and they occasionally require minor tweaking in missionman to update them (Some objects in HW1 don't exist in HW2.)  As for raider retreat, it ends mission 5 and the game ends because it can't load a 'next mission' the reason being that the demo didn't have one. It wouldn't be hard for Gearbox to simply edit the missions to point to the next one in sequence.  Either way it matters not now since it's for HW1R only and not for HWC."
homeworld,390veg,ViralHatred,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:58:21 2015 UTC,"Maybe this is a sign of a big update coming. If they manage to land it soon and then have Homeworld be part of the Summer Sale for a day or so, they could make a killing potentially."
homeworld,38ypwi,EwokSithLord,6,Sun Jun 7 23:46:04 2015 UTC,"That's kinda how HW2 works. In later missions, frigates and strike craft (and even destroyers) will get wiped out fairly easily by the enormous numbers of enemy ships, so you'll be replacing things a lot. And with auto-harvesting at the end of the missions, there really isn't any 'strategy' for harvesting, lets you use the workers for repairs instead."

homeworld,38ypwi,Meakis,2,Mon Jun 8 01:00:36 2015 UTC,"Mate, first of you have a lot of resources, not infinite.  Second yes that is normal, you will need to replace A LOT later in the campaign. A lot of fighters and cruisers will be replaced. maybe a few destroyers or battlecruisers also."

homeworld,38rca9,EatThePath,1 point,Sat Jun 6 05:24:05 2015 UTC,Has the community informed Gearbox that they would prefer actual ballistics over an RNG system? Formations are pretty meaningless without ballistics and battles are more interesting to watch when the projectiles are simulated.  Where would one go to voice their opinion on the matter to the devs?
homeworld,38rca9,EatThePath,2,Sat Jun 6 05:39:24 2015 UTC,"Their official forums are the place they're most likely to see it, but I can definitely tell you that it's been brought to their attention multiple times. And while I definitely agree that I'd prefer a game with ballistics, I don't for a second expect Gearbox to rip out the current accuracy engine and replace it.  I don't think formations are meaningless without ballistics, either. Maybe less meaningful, sure, but concentration of fire and geometry of engagement does still matter even without ballistics."

homeworld,38rca9,EatThePath,2,Sat Jun 6 09:57:02 2015 UTC,"HW1C vs HW1R feels different for many reasons. The way ships move is different, the damage and health values are different, the ranges are different, the relative speeds are even different in places. Bringing all those factors into line and exhaustively tuning the accuracy values can bring the game a lot closer to feeling like HW1 without needing to rip out the accuracy system entirely, and there's some community balance mods that take that approach."
homeworld,38rca9,MarikBentusi,2,Sat Jun 6 20:17:08 2015 UTC,"I meant to say ""as one of the reasons"", but it must've gotten lost when I edited the sentence one times too many while writing the comment."
homeworld,38rca9,Riekopo,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:43:15 2015 UTC,I think there is locational damage in the remastered versions. I don't think they've said anything about ballistics and I don't think they will. The remaster is based on Homeworld 2's engine. They can only do so much.

homeworld,38lcmm,EwokSithLord,3,Thu Jun 4 23:29:48 2015 UTC,Always been confused why taiidan craft even have wings.
homeworld,38lcmm,critically_damped,3,Fri Jun 5 04:01:17 2015 UTC,They are also most likely capable of atomspheric flight.
homeworld,38lcmm,ViralHatred,2,Fri Jun 5 05:47:59 2015 UTC,"This is shown in the cutscenes in cataclysm, as well implied in one of the HW1 cutscenes with the landed Taiidan Light Corvette. The Taiidan fighters are capable of inner atmosphere flight.  Also in HW1C Kushan probes do not deploy their antennae until they are given a move command, they do not deploy when launched.  See beginning of this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itnXy-jKwYY"
homeworld,38lcmm,critically_damped,2,Fri Jun 5 11:20:17 2015 UTC,"What I'm saying is that as soon as you give a move order, they deploy their antenna in classic, while in remastered they do not deploy until they arrive."
homeworld,38lcmm,ViralHatred,0,Fri Jun 5 15:58:26 2015 UTC,"It's still idiotic to give them wings.  If you want to fly atmospheric, you dock, then put some wings on in the giant factory ship where you live and park.  Putting the wings on from the start is stupid because it would add weight that doesn't need to be there."

homeworld,38lcmm,kioni,2,Sat Jun 6 00:32:14 2015 UTC,"No, you were technically correct.  And I should have started by acknowledging that."
homeworld,38lcmm,ChekhovsRPG,1 point,Sat Jun 6 00:58:34 2015 UTC,the wings are clearly useful since their conventional engines have top speeds of a few hundred km/hr. there must be friction from flying through the aether.
homeworld,38lcmm,critically_damped,2,Fri Jun 5 05:33:29 2015 UTC,"Wings generate lift, they do not improve drag factor. Instead the wings would even generate additional drag against the ""aether"" when sufficiently high speeds. best shape for any spacecraft would be a needle cone I guess."

homeworld,38lcmm,critically_damped,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:02:42 2015 UTC,"Well, obviously stripes too.  Everybody knows that.  But spoilers are just upside-down wings, and spoilers make cars go faster.  And since there isn't any real ""upside down"" in space, we can conclude that all wings make ships go faster in space.

Bow thrusters make docking easier, since they allow the captain to turn the vessel to port or starboard side, without using the main propulsion mechanism which requires some forward motion for turning;  indeed, the effectiveness of a thruster is curtailed by any forward motion due to the Coandă effect. A stern thruster is of the same principle, fitted at the stern. Large ships might have multiple bow thrusters and stern thrusters.

homeworld,38lcmm,ChekhovsRPG,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:04:25 2015 UTC,"That's not a definition of ""thruster"":  That's a definition of a type of thruster that is not a main thruster.    A thruster is a thing that creates thrust.  As your example shows, there isn't even any requirement that it's even a different kind of engine (the thrusters in your first links are still propellers).  Since there is only one ""exhaust"" trail emanating from each strike craft, it probably stands to reason that they control their orientation with some internal mechanism (like a set of reaction wheels).  Also, I'd like to point out how silly this is that my snide comment turned into an actual discussion.  Next, we'll be talking about how there actually IS sound in space...."

It's the lack of turrets and flexibility that let the Vaygr warship down.  Two of the monsters can vaporize even a max health HC or BC with a stream of six red bolts and sixteen heavy fusion missiles.  To further sweeten the deal: you can only stop the missiles from firing with a gaggle of bombers.

Tech up to some bombers and minelayer corvettes along with multigun corvettes and defenders, and watch them squirm.  Most people forget about the minelayer corvette, as one mine can eliminate 1/4 of the health from a destroyer.

After all, the new art assets are mostly very good indeed (the worst offender being the new UI, which is absolutely atrocious, but I guess there's no real reason to hope for a fix in that department).  I guess I'm salty because it's such a mix between a great product and a horrible one. Such a waste having all that talent making great content, then ruin it all with rubbish programmers and UI designers. It boggles the mind, really."
homeworld,37gq9w,bananafreesince93,1 point,Thu May 28 15:39:56 2015 UTC,The UI is much better than the old one imo. It takes up a lot less space and you can have it open while commanding your units. That was one of the things I think that HW2 did better than the first game.

homeworld,37gq9w,ratamaq,2,Wed May 27 16:40:42 2015 UTC,"I've read about official ideas for workarounds for the formation problem, but they'd come with downsides like still not being able to Sphere-formation-guard a target, or being unable to fly ships of different types in a formation. Truly emulating how HW1 handled formations would require big changes to the engine, and I'm guessing most of the initially available resources were spent on prettying up the graphics, and a major chunk of the resources put aside for post-launch support are probably reserved for Multiplayer since that's since in beta and seems like a really complicated task even with all the concessions HW1 gameplay had to make to fit into HW2's mold (equalized armor, RNG combat, fuel, etc).  Haven't heard anything about the voices, I'm guessing some of the old archives aren't accessible anymore for decompression, which is also why HW:R's not multilang. That or, again, missing resources to update all sounds.  I keep bringing up that point because as HWR was ramping up to release, the preview builds were varying substantially in terms of core features, which to me suggests they had to push it out the door and were held on a pretty tight leash because Gearbox initially didn't know what to do with the IP, they don't have a big RTS history, as a genre it's not a safe bet, and the multiplayer also wasn't so big you could bank on esports bux or something.  I've also read on the Gearbox forums that there's still a crapload of outdated LUAs in the HWR engine that limit how much modern code you can work with, so that's probably creating another roadblock for programmers trying to improve the AI. It's also for example why HWR doesn't properly support multicore and some mods are working within pretty confined boundaries.  That's why I wouldn't expect much from the updates. Maybe a ""hey we tried"" solution for formations that will have bigger significance as a gesture than as an actual gameplay improvement, and probably some number-tweaking for Multiplayer so the Beta tag can come off before the community has completely dispersed, but that's about all I'd be expecting.  Might just be me being sour tho. I can see why they'd funnel so much into graphics for a remake, but ""graphics > everything"" games have a special place in video game hell for me."

homeworld,371zgf,zearan,1 point,Tue May 26 14:53:35 2015 UTC,Fixed level + Fleet Size.  Taking the HWC approach of 'build loads of stuff before jumping' generally results in having a bad time in HW2. Try retiring non-essential ships such as frigates and interceptors (Gunships are always worth keeping imo.)  Once you get the Prog Dreddie you can generally safely retire most of your fleet without worrying about the next mission.

homeworld,36o4se,Wendon,19,Wed May 20 20:21:55 2015 UTC,"So it started many thousands of years before the games, when the Bentusi found the first hyperdrive core. The three cores are more powerful than the regular hyperspace engines most people use, and are called Far Jumpers because they can cross the galaxy very quickly. The Bentusi used their tech to establish trade routes and kept the peace between the various peoples of the galaxy. Various peoples grew to resent this, and eventually a series of wars erupted more or less at once. The Bentusi only had 1 fleet, and couldn't be everywhere at once. When the dust settled, several empires had been formed. Among these were the Hiigarans, and the Taiidan, who ended up neighbors, and in dispute over various border systems.  Then the Hiigarans found the 2nd core. Realizing it's potential, they built up a new fleet, sailed past the Taiidan border defenses to the capital, glassed it, then moved in to take the disputed territories. Expecting the galactic council (formed in the aftermath of the wars) to take its usual long-assed time to make a decision, they were surprised when the council immediately demanded they withdraw from the conquered systems and surrender the core. The Hiigarans decided they would only give the core up to the Bentusi. This was just a feint, however, and they attacked when the Bentusi arrived. The Bentusi won, but rather than surrender, the Hiigaran flag ship was flown into the planet's moon, destroying it, and presumably the core. Meanwhile, the Taiidan border defense fleet (commanded by Admiral Reisstu) seeing the Hiigaran fleet wiped out, invaded and either conquered or destroyed every planet along the way. When they reached Hiigara, the galaxy finally woke up and begged him to stop the slaughter. The Hiigarans were instead exiled, and secretly smuggled the core and guidestone away with them (the destruction of the flagship was a contingency planned in advance, they knew where to look for the core).  Three thousand years go by, the Taiidan take over large parts of the galaxy, and the first couple games happen. Throughout all this, portions of the galaxy remain outside the influence of the council, and the Bentusi, and everyone else. These areas are known as the Vagyr Reaches. Vagyr warlords, using sub-light ships, invade and conquer whatever systems they come across, in millenia-long orgies of violence and destruction. The rest of the galaxy prefers they stay where they are. Unfortunately, a Vagyr Warlord named Makaan finds the third core, and uses it to unite the Vagyr factions, and invades everyone else. The Bentusi are dying out, the Taiidan republic has degenerated into chaos and been largely absorbed by the Vagyr, and the Hiigarans are the only empire left that can stand against them.  So what are the three Cores? Long, LONG, time ago, there was a species known as the Progenitors. Know one knows where they came from or where they went. The Karos ship graveyard is the broken up remnants of one (yes, ONE) of their ships, which contained three powerful hyperdrive cores, and various other odds and ends. The ship broke apart at some point, forming the graveyard we see today. The cores were separated and hidden, who don't know by whom, or why, only that a prophecy arose shortly after stating: He who unites the Three will unlease Sajuuk. You may recognize Sajuuk as the god worshiped on Kharak (and many other planets)  The Dreadnaught is the Gatekeeper of Sajuuk. Makaan believes he is the Chosen One, and is invading Hiigara to get their core. When he's done there, he'll go after Bensusi for the First Core. Then, he'll unleash Sajuuk, whatever that means.  Spoilers:    Sajuuk is a Progenitor starship currently residing near the center of the galaxy. Due to the large numbers of black holes, gravity is far too strong for regular hyperdrives, even single Far Jumper cores can't handle it. The Progenitors built a gateway to take people there, but it can only be activated by a Dreadnought. Once the three cores are installed into Sajuuk, the ship can be used to activate a Progenitor hyperspace gate network, allowing much faster travel throughout the galaxy, ushering in a new golden age."

homeworld,36o4se,boredatworkbasically,8,Wed May 20 21:59:50 2015 UTC,It is kinda weird because hw1 was a fairly plausible space opera and hw2 is prophecy this and ancient mystical bullshit that and retcons enormous parts of the lore and frankly has a really really bad story.
homeworld,36o4se,Diffusion9,10,Wed May 20 21:54:27 2015 UTC,"But its not a prophecy, or ancient mystical bullshit; its an actual physical ship hidden somewhere which had a tangible outcome. Its right there in the game.  All the prophecy and ancient mystical shit is saying is ""If somebody gets the three cores, they can reactivate this weapon that was lost, if they can find it, oh and by the way if the Hiigarans ever get back into space and figure out where they're actually from, they're probably going to want to come fuck shit up and take it back."" -- which is exactly what happened.  The galactic war, fall of Hiigara and Exile is thousands and thousands of years in the past as I understand it. Its like the Bible being a general guidebook for how ancient peoples handled their concept of morality and existence, except it got all turned into a religion.  Pretty much exactly the way Hiigarans twisted their exodus to Kharak into a religion about Sajuuk punishing them for their sins. ""Don't leave the planet or we'll be punished by Sajuuk!"" -- aka ""We'll get punished by the people who exiled us here if we leave."" Which is exactly what happened.  I'd argue pretty strongly that both games dealt with ""prophecy this and ancient mystical bullshit that."" -- some of my specifics might be a little off. Been ages since I've been exposed to the lore."

homeworld,36o4se,boredatworkbasically,2,Thu May 21 16:05:30 2015 UTC,also originally there was nothing special about the khar toba since there were many Arks that began the long trip to kharak and most of the ships did not make it.

Little story: I played a 2v2 with someone who had 10k starting resources and all research unlocked, and when I tried to get them to change it they argued something like how boring and slow the start of the game is, needing to research things and mine enough resources to do anything. I was also a hw1 race and they told me that I shouldn't play the hw1 races because they're weak. They were practically demanding I change to a hw2 race, but then the lobby filled and we started.  The game starts, and the first ship I build is a heavy cruiser. I hyperspace it across the map and we won in under 5 minutes.

Though they have said they are looking into how to get formations behaving in a manner more in line with HW1, it is just that takes a decent amount of work since you have to worry about HW2 ship behaviors in relation to HW1 formations and if they would or could cause unforeseen problems."
homeworld,36i8zv,halofreak7777,6,Wed May 20 04:11:04 2015 UTC,"They were never broken to begin with.   They don't work as they are expected or currently work in HW1C, so yes they are broken.   It is just that HW2's STRIKE GROUPS behave in a different manner than HW1's formations did   Which is why formations are broken!   in HW2s engine formations never actually existed.   Actually they do. They are just limited in size to individual squads, which is basis for the solution being worked on."
homeworld,36i8zv,Rogue100,-1,Wed May 20 17:15:18 2015 UTC,"They don't work as they are expected or currently work in HW1C, so yes they are broken.   This is not HW1C. If I expect a cow to give me chocolate milk, but just get milk what was broken the cow or my expectation of the system before me?   Which is why formations are broken!   Homeworld 2 strike groups have never behaved in that manner nor where they intended too. The system isn't broken.   Actually they do. They are just limited in size to individual squads, which is basis for the solution being worked on.   The adaptability of squad based formations that had 3 stances where they hold position relative to each other is not the entirety of the HW1C formation system and obviously can't replicate the behavior so many fans EXPECT. Sure they are taking this and trying to expand it and adapt it to perform the way people are expecting, but formations were never supported in the way they were in HW1C so it was never BROKEN because it was never DESIGNED to function that way. Language is full of semantics and it matters otherwise the idea gets lost in translation."
homeworld,36i8zv,halofreak7777,4,Wed May 20 21:37:14 2015 UTC,"This is not HW1C.   Neither is it HW2. It is HW1R. It was marketed as a graphics update of HW1, not a HW1 skin for HW2. Expecting it to play like HW1C is perfectly reasonable. Since it doesn't meet that expectation, it is for all practical purposes broken.   Homeworld 2 strike groups have never behaved in that manner nor where they intended too. The system isn't broken.   Yes, I understand the technical reason behind why they behave the way they do. It doesn't really matter though. Whether the code governing the behavior is actually broken, or simply written with different behavior in mind, the end result is HW1 ships not behaving the way they ought to."

Maybe they thought HW2's system was better and that is how it 'ought to' work. But we are all just silly in preferring HW1 (Which I don't I think strike groups are an improvement to formations in every way personally)  Ought To though, is an extremely silly phrase because it brings the question of who exactly is the arbitrator of how something 'should' be."

Gunships lose badly to big ships, and a well stocked fleet of big ships doesn't lose to anything smaller.  The difficulty scales with your own fleet size, so the old ""capture everything"" technique doesn't work at all, particularly since you're so limited in salvage corvy numbers and have to micro them so much."

homeworld,36kjw8,critically_damped,1 point,Wed May 20 15:41:23 2015 UTC,"I also just realized that I completely ignored you were talking about HW2...  everything still holds except for the salvage corvette stuff, because salvaging in HW2 is even more worthless.      Marine frigates are weak, and are treated as a primary target by the AI  Salvaged ships still count against your unit caps and Higgy capitals are so vastly superior to Viggy ones... battlecruisers especially, since disabling the engines of a Viggy BC renders it completely helpless.  You don't even need to worry about capturing for resources, because you will never really suffer for RUs.  (Edit)  I forgot you can't even build from captured vig carriers, shipyards, and BCs.  Even more worthless.   Mission 3, like a lot of the missions, is stupidly scripted.  If I remember, you have to repair your shipyard, and if you do it too fast before you've built your fleet up, you get slaughtered.  As a rule in HW2, if they give you a mission objective that doesn't have a very clear countdown associated with it, then you are pretty free to ignore it until you feel you're ready.  What I said before about using your fighters (scouts are fastest and have radar ,and intys aren't any stronger than scouts, really) as bait still holds, though, and if you scout properly, you can see the incoming groups and delay them as needed until you're finished particulating the ones which came before it."

homeworld,36f9tk,Solusar,2,Tue May 19 14:14:49 2015 UTC,"Simplicity is a virtue to gameplay in many ways. Make ships too mult-role and it becomes hard to make clear distinctions between them, and too many projectile types makes battles a hard to read mess.

I don't have multigun corvettes because of this and have had the bug happen on another play through for both carriers and defenders.   Unfortunately I think the only way to fix it is to go back and replay the mission you were supposed to get the research in or live without it.     Fyi,  if you want to easily complete the mission with the dog without using gravwell generators you can send a force of strike craft around the majority of the guns to the top,  right or bottom.   Right is my preference.   You only need to destroy a small number of guns and you can back your fleet off so the dog won't come for them."

I used three gravwell generators to take down the Junkyard Dawg (alternating them on and off to maintain a constant coverage) but if you don't have them, an alternate strategy is to destroy one of its hyperspace gates with bombers. I've read that this seems to confuse it and cause it to leave your ships alone afterwards.  You could also use fighters and fly well above the junkyard's ""plane"" and drop down over the hidden recon base to dock with it, thus avoiding the Junkyard Dawg and most of the defense turrets entirely."

It can only do that whole activated, though, and blows itself apart once it's out of energy (again, that's always been how it worked). There's a lie reason for the explosion, but I don't recall it off the top of my head.  If I remember right, they should shut down hyperspace jumps even in ""passive"" mode.  Ways to work around them: they're kind of a late-game ship, so realistically strike craft swarms should be less powerful than the were in the early game. That said, consider jumping in a couple of ion frigates to nearby to blow the gravwell; keep your fighters out of the area of effect and treat grav generators as priority targets during fleet battles, or (probably best plan) use carrier support to keep your strike craft protected until the generator is down, then send your little guys on seek and destroy missions.

homeworld,35k33u,Iam_TheHegemon,2,Mon May 11 04:35:46 2015 UTC,"Then it's probably a balance issue. In classic, I remember them being rushable only at the expense of everything else. They had a long research time in and of themselves, and the prerequisites were nasty as well.  It wound up being the kind of thing where if your opponent left you alone long enough to rush them, you deserved them.   If they're being rushed, then their research time needs to be extended and cost probably needs to be raised (not the research cost, which is dumb and should go away for hw1 stuff).   And if people are rushung them, ask yourself: what are they giving up? How can you take advantage of things? If it were me, I'd raid their research ship. Wreck that, and they lose all progress and investment on any current research."
homeworld,35k33u,ratamaq,2,Mon May 11 11:16:00 2015 UTC,"Close, but a little different situation now.  First off, the requirement was the same. Cap drive > gravwell. However, RU was more scarce in HW1 so the well itself was a big investment.   Second, wells didn't have the range they do now.   Third, jump cost for a well (or anything really) was much higher in HW1. In HWR you can not only afford to keep a constant queue of wells going, you can also jump them for relatively no cost compared to HW1  And last, wells in HW1 push fighters out of the well so you only lost assess to your fighter swarm for a small period of time and in a smaller AOE. Vettes stayed locked in HW1, but in HWR fighters are locked the same way.   I forget the research time for a gravwell, but the rest of the numbers with a single research ship are  Research ship- 1:10 Cap research- 1:25 Well research- ? Well build- 1:00  So 3 minutes 35 seconds plus the research time of gravwell. Even if it was 2 full minutes that is still putting a well on the field before a sizable strike craft group can do any real damage.   Edit: typo"
homeworld,35k33u,ViralHatred,2,Mon May 11 20:44:01 2015 UTC,"HW1 Wells didn't push fighters out, fighters moved themselves out. Because of the tickrate of the Gravwell it meant fighters could slowly wiggle their way out/move out and from time to time could fire also."

I hope they can avoid this."
homeworld,34x8uu,rakgitarmen,2,Tue May 5 16:31:33 2015 UTC,"I'm more of an action rather than words kinda guy but we have many ideas to forge the play environment into terrain but the nature of the combat will lend itself to making tactical decisions about when and how to commit your forces.  As the demo evolves you'll see what I mean, in particular the 'Short Range Jump' ability will allow you to instantly withdraw your forces from battle, cycling the Flotillas acting on the front lines pulling them back to recharge shields (and abilities) with the relief effort going in - rinse and repeat as appropriate.  Other examples of diverse tactical choice would include:   Missile's will come in different types for different jobs Ships can be rigged with different type of weapons (Energy, Kinetic, Precise and Artillery[AOE]) Ships can be rigged with hull modules kinda like Eve Online  Abilities will be by default auto-activated, but you can control them (think about activating those Battlecruiser spinal mount weapons when an enemy Capital Ships shields are down) The field of play will be an entire planetary system, the demo represents an 'instance' of combat - with a very very small tactical bound at that   With all this in mind you can play the game in two ways, lots of cheap ships as cannon fodder OR spend your points developing hulls with loadouts suitable for certain tasks and crush your enemy cleverly (or even just remove their ability to fight.)  The enemy AI is acting dumb at the moment, soon you'll see a change of tactics in the demo - when the flotilla leader gets destroyed the ships will route towards the edge of the tactical bound. When reinforcement Flotilla arrive the wings will join up with the reinforcement body and co-ordinate their assaults.  The wings/flotilla system allows me to do some very clever things with the AI and the planned Officer/Crew RPG features. It'll all make more sense once 'Astrometrics' has been sorted, abstract representations of fleets or portion of a fleet in a beautiful fully-realised planetarium - you'll collect incidental missions here, hunt out enemy fortifications and progress the main questline set by TCN HQ.  This is all subject to resources, if the preorders/early access do well, I'll get it done in one shot - if not, it'll take slightly longer and I might have to release a few episodic Shallow Space titles before we get to the stated standard.  Pledge on the website to make it happen: http://shallow.space/preorder-shallow-space-insurgency-now/  New version of the alpha demo inbound, just polishing now..."
homeworld,34x8uu,mawhrin--skel,3,Wed May 6 14:05:59 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the answer. I've already watched a lot of the videos on the development channel going back to the prototype stages and it already looks amazing. The level of depth you just described is also unparalleled. An RTS with EVE type ship fitting and different damage types? That's adds some crazy depth to the game already. I hope you can get all the support you need.  If I may make a suggestion about dispersing deathballs a bit, would you consider locational armor on important capital ships? So a ship may have very strong front and side armor (just like a WW2 battleship) but a weak top/bottom armor. This might force the opponents to use the 3D aspect of the battlefield more and could result in interesting maneuvers."
homeworld,34x8uu,rakgitarmen,3,Wed May 6 14:17:57 2015 UTC,"I've looked into this, directional armor and shields and my response is this:   Combat in Shallow Space is a very fluid affair, the idea is to pre-stage the ship orders interfering with the flow of combat only when necessary.   This reason for this is two fold:   1) people like to sit back and watch their nicely configured fleet slog it out. 2) combat in three dimensions inevitably overloads the players (some people just can't hack it, no sense of direction etc.)    What you suggest would add an additional layer of complexity, it will add an excuse for the player to want to manage every minutia of ship direction and try to influence the enemy battlefront as a result, but the fluid nature of the combat would prevent that (enemy ships flying above or below the player body, inconsistent AI positioning and tactics) and it would have the affect of the player feeling as if they aren't good enough to play the game: Very bad.  What you describe is more suited to a turn based game or something where you have a single wing of ships to pilot more directly (like Starfleet Command) so while I am very very open to suggestions, I cannot implement that unfortunately."
homeworld,34x8uu,mawhrin--skel,2,Wed May 6 14:30:35 2015 UTC,"Also I forgot to say, thanks for the support!

I'm glad the game has retained its depth and most of these complaints are from noobs.  I can get over the loss of formations and realtime bullets, as long as the game is still competitive. From what you described it sounds like the perfect RTS."
homeworld,34u0o8,-weedTRON-,6,Mon May 4 17:45:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, many games' subreddits are filled with blind-rage posts. This game really does have some interesting depth. Example: 1v1's on very small maps can produce rush builds like double fighter facility, but other 1v1 maps are huge and are much harder to scout and nearly impossible to rush on. Starcraft 2 had this same problem where one of the starting ladder maps was ""Steppes of War"", which was a tiny straight-line no-flanks map to the opponents base. After many seasons, only now do we truly realize how shitty that map was. In homeworld, playing on only tiny maps would have you believe that teching up and using gravity well or hyperspace would be totally useless, but playing on the larger maps easily changes this.  Perhaps the only thing in this game that is currently underpowered is HW1 fighters, but to fix it they could easily lower the cost of them or fix formations for them to be more effective. Even with slightly weaker fighters, HW1 races have other really strong ships and abilities. Too many people are trying out a specific build, losing with it, and then just hopping to the forums. It reminds me all too much of Blizzard's hardly moderated. balance whine, trolling forums of Starcraft and World of Warcraft. Try things out people!"

homeworld,34u0o8,chimas_rts,3,Tue May 5 05:21:05 2015 UTC,"The core of Intelligence is when you're able to give up on things that are not working, meanwhile others are succeeding probably with other options. That's what I've learned with RTS games. The game is often made to be solved. You might not win because someone else is better or faster, but you won't be a strategic decision maker if you keep loosing to yourself.    In my opinion the OP is right when he focus the critics on the fact that ppl urge to blame balance and unit stats. Suddenly, everybody becomes a ""Pro"". I tend not to join balancement discussions, because I'm a casual player, but sometimes is difficult to argue when you don't want to reveal game tricks that the player MUST learn/develop by him/herself.    As I said in another game forum, we need an expression that synthetize this condition, so the critique realizes that there is something he/she's not catching."
homeworld,34u0o8,RaZorwireSC2,5,Mon May 4 23:59:08 2015 UTC,"For example, I recently read a dead serious post about how one of the best strategies that needs to be nerfed is just rushing to build a battlecruiser and ""whoever gets a BC out first wins."" This is so ridiculously wrong. If you try to rush a battlecruiser out, you will be overwhelmed by fighters and frigates and immediately lose the game. Even if you did get one out, it would not win you the game.   That depends entirely on whether you are playing 1v1 or team games. I've played a lot of 3v3s with different constellations of races, and I don't think I've played more than one game where the team that got BCs out first ended up losing."
homeworld,34u0o8,-weedTRON-,-4,Mon May 4 20:37:52 2015 UTC,"...facepalm...  Rushing BC is stuipidly obvious and is one of the shittiest strategies in 1v1 OR TEAM GAMES..  Stupidly obvious signs that an opponent is BC rushing:   One opponent quickly gets a capital facility, research modules, and no offensive units. Probability of incoming BC ~25%, keep a note of it. They are up to something. It could just be a fast carrier or destroyer. The opponent then gets a hyperspace module. Hmm... zero to few units and early hyperspace... I wonder... Probability of incoming BC ~50%. That opponent then builds a fucking giant shipyard, basically screaming, ""I'm rushing BC's, but you still have a good ~5 minutes before it tries to hyperspace to into you"". A capital facility on the shipyard takes 75 seconds to build. A Hig BC takes 140 seconds for the BC chassis research and then another 280 seconds to build the damn thing. Note that a gravity well generator takes just 60 seconds to finish. Probability of incoming BC ~90%.   You are a total moron if you get BC rushed and lose to it. It doesn't matter if it is a team game or 1v1. It is a bad strategy. Even if they do get one out, it hardly wins them the game. Simply make a gravity well generator. They will hyperspace in thinking they are so fucking clever. Now their BC is stuck in a shitty position with no reinforcements since they thought it would make it. The things are so damn slow you'd have another 5 minutes to react if they tried to just tell it to attack your mothership. After you or your team kills that one lone battlecruiser, you can easily 3v2 an opponent and kill him by the time another battlecruiser shows up out of that retard on their team.  Please learn what you are talking about before spouting nonsense."
homeworld,34u0o8,RaZorwireSC2,2,Mon May 4 21:23:48 2015 UTC,"it seems like in a team game, BCs still might be a sure-fire if your teammates can mass a small fleet to screen the BC. Is there such thing as a pocket player? Because I feel like in a 3v3 then someone should always rush BCs."
homeworld,34u0o8,Gifted_SiRe,0,Mon May 4 22:21:36 2015 UTC,"Assuming that they build a BC and then jump straight into the fray with zero backup, then no, it's not a very good strategy.   Assuming that their BC is backed up by their allies' respective fleets, then no, you are fucked. The BC can kill 3-4 destroyers or 20+ frigates on its own. It dominates the entire battlefield, and without a massive fleet advantage, you won't even be able to kill it before another one comes out if it is supported by allies.   You are a total moron if you get BC rushed and lose to it.   If ""build a BC and jump it straight in without backup"" is the extent of your game knowledge regarding that ship, you are in no position to give any advice on strategy whatsoever.  Also, you're acting like a piece of shit, but maybe that's unrelated."

homeworld,34u0o8,climbandmaintain,1 point,Tue May 5 08:21:50 2015 UTC,"Or you know, you rush a BC and have it back up your allies fleets who are almost certainly smaller than each of your opponents since they had no help from you stopping the harassing and were fighting 3V2 the whole game until then. And then your BC just gets its guns and engines shot off by bombers after killing two frigates and then you have a really expensive brick.  That seems to be the most usual result of BC rushing I see. (But of course this is usually with me playing against pubs with a 3 person team all in mumble together. So it is a tad unfair.)"

For instance, tricking you into thinking someone is a noob. Probes are so cheap and quick to build you can easily manipulate someone using one or two of them. While scouts can be better (and sometimes are depending on what you need for micro) probes can achieve psychological things scouts can't - and can also be a cheap way to build a sensor net on larger maps."

homeworld,34qvxy,algo,3,Sun May 3 19:46:44 2015 UTC,"First of all, I dock my fighters and corvettes to my carriers but they auto launch which I don't want. Bug or behaviour?   You can turn off auto launch in the ""Launch""-tab, next to the build and research tabs. You can set Launch settings individually for each carrier/mothership you have. If you have set them to stay docked and the launch anyway, it's a bug.   Next my carriers hyperspace out in front of my mothership but arrive at the side, the right one blocks the launch bay and none of the fighters can launch.   I assume you mean when you end a mission and hyperspace to the next one, right? Have you tried moving the blocking carrier and then launching the ships manually (Launch tab, again).   Then when the shooting starts my repair frigates, mostly captured, don't repair the mothership. They just bounce around.   Have you specifically told them to repair it or are they just idling near the Mothership? In case of the former, there could be another ship or object interfering with their pathing, so try moving a few nearby ships around and then try issuing the repair order again. If that doesn't work, it's a bug. The ship pathing is known to have some issues."
homeworld,34qvxy,RaZorwireSC2,1 point,Sun May 3 21:59:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks, my mothership is dead within a minute of the stage starting so I'll keep grinding away at it until I find something that works."
homeworld,34qvxy,achensherd,2,Mon May 4 19:51:31 2015 UTC,"Last mission? That one took me a lot of tries due to the number of heavy-hitters that show up within seconds of hyperspacing in. What worked for me:   Max out all combat ships at the end of Mission 15. In my case, since I was already over the cap on capital and super capital ships due to salvaging, I maxed out on Attack Bombers and Multigun Corvettes. Dock all strike craft evenly between the Mothership and carriers so they can launch and be available more quickly when they (inevitably) auto-launch at the beginning of Mission 16. Upon hyperspacing into Mission 16, immediately start dividing up the fleet to deal with the specific threats that arrive. There are probably/definitely better compositions, but I just divided and positioned my fleet by type: frigates against the frigates that arrive from the lower left of the Mothership, Multigun Corvettes against the fighters from above, Attack Bombers against the Heavy Cruiser(s) and Destroyers from the front, Destroyers and Heavy Cruisers against the same, and then everything against whatever's left at that point.   Edit: Additional notes:   The Sensors Array is critical for this mission. If you for some reason don't already have one, build one. You really can't afford any surprises in this mission since every one of the fleets that come for you can kill the Mothership within seconds once they're in range. Don't let them get within range. You will get attacked by (as far as I remember) two other fleets like the one that comes at you from the front in the beginning of the mission. Like with that fleet, hit the Heavy Cruiser(s) first with Attack Bombers, preferably long before they and your fleet make contact. Your frigate crews will love you."

homeworld,34kfml,RadioHitandRun,1 point,Fri May 1 22:46:59 2015 UTC,Homeworld isn't particularly 'hardcore' as RTS games go. It takes some adapting to the perspective with the Z axis but otherwise it's not too different to something traditional like Starcraft or Age of Empires.
homeworld,34kfml,ENKC,1 point,Sat May 2 01:54:55 2015 UTC,If your willing to play the classic homeworld 2 there's a mod that allows you to build ships from the star wars universe as well. It's called Star Wars Warlords.
homeworld,34kfml,Rapid107,1 point,Sat May 2 11:22:30 2015 UTC,"I've played both a fair amount, here's the differences:  -HW has truly three-dimensional combat, you can move your ships above or below the enemy.  Some ships are weaker from different directions.  -HW has tactical hyperspace jumps.  For a cost in resources, you can jump to a specified location on the map.  Hyperspace inhibitors/gravity wells exist to prevent jumping through an area or too close to an area. (Similar to the Interdictor in EAW)  -Resourcing operations are actual resource collectors that mine asteroids instead of capturing ""mining stations.""  Having more collectors means faster resourcing, but having too many can cause delays as they all try to dock to deposit the resources.  -Research and construction is similar, except in HW you can have multiple construction ships and the new units come directly out of the hangar (or hyperspace in nearby).  No ""Levels"" for your mothership like for the space station.  -Homeworld is very oriented towards the rock-paper-scissors approach;  you want to see what the enemy is using and use units specifically tailored to fighting those units.  From what I remember of EAW, it was easy to just spam capitals and defend them with the free fighters.  My memory on this may be rusty though.  If you want to play Star Wars in the HW engine, the Warlords mod is very good (AFAIK it only works in HW2 classic as of yet, not remastered.  Still amazing quality).  Let me know if you have any other questions!"
homeworld,34kfml,DaBlueCaboose,-1,Sat May 2 20:30:46 2015 UTC,A big part of EoW was being able to damage subsystems and cripple ships. That mechanic doesn't really exist in this game. It's more of the standard deplete-the-health-bar game.
homeworld,34kfml,thezekefreak,2,Sat May 2 11:45:30 2015 UTC,"Umm... have you played Homeworld?  There is literally an upgrade for giving your bombers strong anti-subsystem firepower.  Send 10 bombers with that upgrade to an enemy mothership/shipyard/carrier and they will easily strip it completely down in one minute if undefended.  Even if it is defended, they will be able to kill 2-3 subsystems before they all die.  A popular strategy is to send them in, kill the gravity well generator (hyperspace prevention) and then hyperspace in a battlecruiser and wipe it out in seconds.  Or you could just send the 10 bombers to destroy their capital ship facility and advanced research module to set them back into the stone age."

Changes to the way formations work possibly effecting both HW1 and HW2  Gravwell nerd/buff. Reduced well lock range but increased inhibitor range and armor.   Reduced cost of research ship and increased armor  Removed research requirement for HW1 resource controller  Allow resource controller to build from carrier  Decreased build time on resource collector  Some method to get HW1 carriers out faster, suggested combining cap drive and chassis into one research  Allowing support frigates to dock jump fighters and vettes (10/4)   Statement to make HW1 frigates a little tougher, no details as to how  Looking into a few balance issues between the HW2 BCs (range and engine damage transfer)  Support frigate to get a heal beam instead of latch (negative damage weapon)  Fixing damage bugs with Vayger vettes  Improvement to Hig gunships  Edit: forgot 1  Who knows how much of the above will make it into the patch, but the devs have been pretty active gathering feedback, they hope to have some demo videos of formations up next week."

homeworld,33l5qu,Plumbership,6,Thu Apr 23 12:30:25 2015 UTC,"Scaling on this mission is such a pain in the arse as this screenshot will tell you.  The key focal point with this mission, is that 'only one generator needs to remain alive'.  As soon as you warp in, try to consolidate your carriers near your mothership.  Infiltrators will try to take these carriers, so a small strike detachment should be sufficient to defend.  Your battle group should advance towards the middle generator.  Focus fire enemy capital ships down starting with the cruisers and working downwards.  Strike craft can be used to distract and harass, but the capitals are the ones that'll break them down.  Frigates are difficult for me to classify in HW2.  They're way too vulnerable, so I try to hide these behind the capital ships to provide the coverage that they lack.  Once you saved the middle generator, the attack groups from the top and bottom generator will either stay stationary, or move towards your fleet.  It should be an easy mop up.  The tricky part is the final battlecruiser mob at the rear.  I used ion platforms to bolster my capital ship damage, and lined them up along a 'path'.  I was then able to 'bait' the cruisers to chase a ship.  They ignored my battle group and I was able to cut them down without any capital ship losses.  Your luck may vary, but that's the rough strategy I used for this mission without resorting to retiring.  (I came with a maximized fleet)"
homeworld,33l5qu,Speefy,2,Thu Apr 23 14:30:40 2015 UTC,I found in the remastered version I was using WAY more platforms then previously. They are almost needed every mission.   For this mission I had frigates up front... I sacrificed a great deal of them but I was able to save my capital class's and lost only 1 destroyer the whole mission.   I also had maxed out bombers and interceptors with corvettes maxed out on multi-gun only.  You would be surprised how much those two things helped!

Further, it's unlikely that the AI's other thousand ships (including fighters, frigates, and destroyers) are just going to sit and watch you do that.

homeworld,33l5qu,halofreak7777,2,Thu Apr 23 23:46:16 2015 UTC,"Easier method is to tackle the incoming BCs with bombers and maybe a few sacrificial frigates that attack from the side - this makes the BCs angle away from your main force of capital ships. This is when you want the bombers to destroy the engines. They won't be able to realign - their main rail guns are neutralised. Now use the bombers to take out the missile launchers and follow up with the capital ships.  Once the initial assault is weathered, take the entire fleet and head towards the far side or lower generator - take a wide looping route to avoid the enemy BCs situated near the left generator. Use probes to see where everything is. So long as you don't actually come into range of the BCs, they won't actively seek you out. You need only destroy the fleets attacking the generators one as a time.   Once the fleets have been eliminated, navigate around the back of the gate towards the cluster of BCs and you should see a shipyard/mothership. Navigate as to put this enemy ship between your fleet and the BCs. Then rush in and kill the mothership before the BCs can respond and do too much damage. The cutscene will kick in and you're done."

Never did the enemy have a force and send it at me in a such a manner that my fleet didn't obliterate them with minimal losses. On Balcora my 3 BCs and Dreadnaught with Destroyer escort hit there like 4-5 BCs next to their shipyard and carriers. I sent my frigates/corvettes to handle one of their frigate groups (bottom) attacking the gate. My fighters supported the main battle group. After each of my two groups wipe out their opponents they regrouped to finish off the last frigates, which managed to kill their generator, but you only need 1... They may have had more BCs than me, but I focused fired 2 BCs to 1 and BC + Dread to 1. I also had harvesters on all my BCs/Dreadnaught/Destroyers."

Personally I found Diamond Shoals easier in HW:R than in the original HW, and that was with my captured Taidan destroyers bugging out and getting stuck outside the map boundaries.   What I did was move all my strike fighters and corvettes out of the way, form my frigates up into groups of the same type, then put my support frigates on the mothership. I think I did that mission with 4 Assault Frigates, 4 Support Frigates, 6 Ion Array Frigates and 4 Ion Frigates.

homeworld,33cckz,chv90,11,Tue Apr 21 11:14:59 2015 UTC,"There was more micro involved in HW1 when small ships had limited fuel and ships in general had weaker armor at certain places (making positioning in 3D space more important, and worked better with the old AI for small craft that didn't disperse into an angry swarm of bees that take ages to kill anything), but generally Homeworld wasn't carried by indepth strategy or competitive gameplay, but by the atmosphere of the campaign.  Which in turn imo kinda took a hit by certain mechanical changes. I didn't care for fuel management for instance, but having spaceships rely on something so down-to-earth for a space opera made especially the beginning levels feel much more like a civilization making their first big steps on a big journey.  It does get a bit more complex later on as you gain more ships with active abilities like cloaking fields or double-edged blades like the grav well generator, and there's some levels that change the rules and prompt you to tailor new tactics to them, but like with many strategy game campaigns you can beat most missions by building a lot of whatever new unit the start of the mission unlocks, building a big deathball and throwing it at the problem. An salvage like a maniac if you're into that.  Competitively I've heard HW is mostly about build order and rock/paper/scissors, but I've never been interested in that part of it, so take it with a grain of salt.  The dynamic difficulty is a HW2+ invention because unlike in something like SC2, your fleet is saved inbetween levels, which leads to snowballing a static AI fleet can't respond to. Does definitely have a lot of big downsides tho, doesn't look like there's been a lot of finetuning done to the results the dynamic difficulty can yield in HW1R for example, and you can cheese the system HARD by recycling your units before the next mission.  Gearbox has talked a bit about a possible solution to the formation problems, but it sounds like the kind of bandaid fix people will mostly appreciate as a token of good will, not a ""hell yeah that's exactly what we wanted"" kinda fix. Seems like to restore HW1 engine they'd have to modify the engine more than their budget can allow for."

homeworld,33cckz,kioni,5,Wed Apr 22 09:18:54 2015 UTC,"You may have a better time with the classic version. I've found the early levels in remastered to be a bit dull due to the difference in the way strike craft behave.   Mission 3 is completely different in remastered. In the original, there were 5 or 6 of those assault frigates, not 2. I'd have all of the assault frigates captured in short order in the original and would still wind up losing at least 1 cryotray and a few salvage corvettes if I wasn't careful. In remastered, the mission was over as soon as it started (basically, as soon as my salvage corvettes got over there)."
homeworld,33cckz,menschmaschine5,9,Tue Apr 21 16:02:06 2015 UTC,"First, the bad news - I'd be willing to bet GBX never fixes formations in HW1 remastered, and yes that was a solid chunk of the dynamic combat in the game.  Second I can definitely understand being bored of the first 3 levels if you're an RTS vet. The campaign is gonna give you two things: A story, and a new ""trick"" each level to put you on your heels. Some of these tricks are useful in multiplayer. Most aren't. I'd do a skirmish or two and then jump online if you want to get to the meat of combat. Micro's lost a lot of flair but you'll still find yourself having to manage your cap ships pretty regularly, and it's a deep enough experience online that I think you'll be satisfied."
homeworld,33cckz,ryanman,3,Tue Apr 21 14:27:15 2015 UTC,"If you wanna have the exact idea of gameplay, I suggest you to play both classic versions - HW1C and HW2C. Nothing was lost there."

Dynamic AI is easier and more fun than going against humans.  On the flip side, co-op with humans or playing LAN-style with a group of friends is fun as hell."

homeworld,33cckz,hoyfkd,2,Wed Apr 29 20:06:16 2015 UTC,"Micro will be more important later on in HW1:R when you have the game's equivalent of death balls/walls smacking into each other. Due to the difficulty scaling, you will be facing massive fleets towards the end if you capture a lot of units along the way, and if you simply attack everything with everything, you'll lose a lot of units unnecessarily. It's still not on the level of micro needed in HW1:C, but it's more than early on in the game.  As for the difficulty scaling, it isn't really obvious until you start amassing units and/or breaking unit caps. For example, I didn't build any combat units whatsoever until the end of Mission 6 (in preparation for Mission 7 onward), so I never faced anything I couldn't almost instantly pacify with my Salvage Corvettes. It wasn't until Mission 8 before the scaling really started showing its teeth due to the fact that I had some 30+ frigates by then (9+ more than the cap) and my corvettes maxed out. What used to be waves of 3 enemy frigates coming at you at a time and easily countered by Salvage Corvettes in HW1:C became 10, and 10 of those particular frigates coming at you at a time is... scary."
homeworld,33cckz,achensherd,2,Tue Apr 21 20:47:42 2015 UTC,"The micro, for instance, seems very low. Now, I've heard that formations are broken in Remastered version. Is this why combat is so simplistic? Will it get better or should I just switch to playing the Classic HW1 (included in the Remastered collection)?   Yes, the lacking formations (and tactics settings, which played a bigger role in Classic) is a pretty big part of what gave the original version depth and variation. Homeworld never required Starcraft levels of micro, but it had more options for controlling your fleet than the Remaster does.  With that said, the Remaster will become more complex on later levels where you have more different ship types to control. The Homeworld 2 Remastered campaign should also retain the depth of the original. The Remaster uses a modified version of the HW2 engine, and some of the mechanics from HW1 didn't translate well which is why the HW1 campaign has some missing features. HW2 doesn't have the same problem.  I recommend you to at least try the Classic version and see for yourself what the difference is. The graphics are obviously dated, and the user interface and controls are a lot less smooth than in the Remaster, but being able to play around with formations and tactics makes fleet management feel a lot better in my opinion.   When I played it, I thought it was supposed to be that easy. But now I found out that the game employs ""dynamic difficulty"" that adjusts to your unit numbers. Is my experience with the levels so far this dynamic taking place, or am I experiencing a bug?   Most likely not a bug. I only fought three frigates, as I recall, and managed to save all of the trays. The balancing of the difficulty scaling seems a bit wonky, and people on this subreddit have reported that entering a mission with different fleet sizes can cause the enemy fleet to spawn with a wildy varying amount of ships, sometimes to the point of making certain missions either absurdly difficult or very easy. Homeworld 2 had the same problem in some missions.   Lastly, is there an ETA on the release of the patch that will fix the broken formations in the HW1 Remastered version?   We recieved an update a few weeks ago with a developer's thoughts on how the formations could potentially be implemented, but AFAIK we havn't heard anything specific, aside from that they are still working on further updates.  And welcome to the community. :)"

They have said they're aware of the displeasure and are looking into it. I don't think it will ever be fixed. It was just a terrible idea to port HW1 into the HW2 engine.
homeworld,333cd2,Riekopo,2,Sun Apr 19 06:59:22 2015 UTC,"Well assuming that the devs were on a strictly limited budget (suggested by the project's nature, how much of the game was bugged on launch or completely in beta like MP, and how drastically preview builds varied in function even as the game was ramping up to release), what viable alternatives did they have?  Not to say it doesn't suck, because it does and it's a major turnoff for me as well, but it doesn't seem to me that they had much of a choice. Could have probably spent more resources on a feature-complete port, but since the allure of a remaster for most people is its shininess, it's no surprise a lot of it went into graphics."
homeworld,333cd2,MarikBentusi,1 point,Sun Apr 19 08:08:48 2015 UTC,"They could have remastered the HW1 assets only (""HW1 HD"") and should have left the engine alone..."

homeworld,333cd2,MarikBentusi,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:05:44 2015 UTC,"No, they should have updated the assets and should have left the engine alone (besides minor opengl rendering updates).  Also, cata shows that even serious engine updates were possible (what is not required here)."
homeworld,333cd2,gondur,3,Mon Apr 20 16:22:02 2015 UTC,"What good is updating assets gonna do if your engine can't handle them? The engine is the infrastructure that decides how much your game can handle, whether that's max texture size/poly count, how advanced the shaders are, how capable the AI is, etc.  Cata built on the HW1 engine, HW2's engine is also an extreme mod of the HW1 engine, and HWR in turn uses an extreme mod of the HW2 engine. For the purposes of cooking up a build with shininess as a priority, it only made sense to take HW2's engine as a basis. That also gives modders the most options, allows for cross-game multiplayer, and lets them ship both updates in the same engine instead of working on advancing both HW1's engine and HW2's engine to fit modern shininess standards. That would have been a ridiculous resource sink."
homeworld,333cd2,MarikBentusi,1 point,Mon Apr 20 17:00:50 2015 UTC,"The limits of the engine were not evaluated. Texture and poly updates were most likely possible without changes. Also, not forget that the assets were crippled only due to the limits of the CD media and not because of engine limits, so HD audio and movies would be no problem.   While such an approach would not lead to a game with modern graphic standards (but something inbetween the current remaster and the old classic) it would have the superior game mechanics & balance of HW1. For my taste, the best of both worlds."
homeworld,333cd2,gondur,3,Mon Apr 20 17:07:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about compressed audio and cutscene files due to CD size limitations at all, I'm talking about the normal limits of any engine. You can't just load 1024x1024 textures into any old engine, it wouldn't know how to access and read/write memory, especially under 64-bit systems, at an appropriate speed. It couldn't take advantage of modern drivers, rendering APIs and graphics card architecture to render a huge amount of decals and particle effects at once, or appropriately distribute calculations onto multiple cores and hyperthreads.  There's a LOT that has changed since 1999 and an old game engine wouldn't know how to take advantage of a modern software and hardware suite. That's why new engines are being produced all the time and old ones hacked into and updated to meet modern standards."
homeworld,333cd2,MarikBentusi,1 point,Tue Apr 21 15:55:00 2015 UTC,"So, you have evaluated the limits of the engine?  Guess not as it seems that texture size seems to be pretty unlimited by the engine: https://github.com/timdetering/HomeworldSDL/blob/96907efb425a7395823bf062edad0dee0b31f4d5/documentation/File%20Formats/LiF%20Specification.txt  Also, 64bit support was already added https://github.com/timdetering/HomeworldSDL/blob/96907efb425a7395823bf062edad0dee0b31f4d5/Linux/README.X86_64  And by using standard OpenGL it utilizes automatically ""improved"" drivers & improved hardware.  About multi-core utilization, even modern games and engines struggle to properly use multi-core. So having a well optimized single core engine (runs even on android) might be good enough."
homeworld,333cd2,gondur,1 point,Tue Apr 21 16:25:21 2015 UTC,"HomeworldSDL is a source code mod from what I can tell, just like the HW2 engine built on HW1's, and HWR's built on HW2's.  Using modern OpenGL just means it's compatible with modern hardware, which is why it doesn't flat-out crash when trying to render something. It doesn't mean it uses modern hard- and software to the extent needed to keep up with modern graphics.  ~40% of Steam users run dual cores, if you want to produce a blinged out Remaster with Workshop support on top, I don't see how skipping multicore support is a good idea, modders would cry even if you didn't have a problem running the current assets on one core. Tho ultimately I guess it would come down to just how much old LUA you'd have to yank out of Homeworld."
homeworld,333cd2,MarikBentusi,2,Tue Apr 21 17:00:13 2015 UTC,"They could have gone that route. Either the quality of the HW1 remaster would have been far short of what was achieved with the remaster of the HW2 engine, or it would have extended the development time significantly.

homeworld,333cd2,Rogue100,1 point,Mon Apr 20 16:24:01 2015 UTC,"They stated that, but this makes it not fact. Also, I argue mostly asset updates were required without even touching the engine at all."

So you'd research and build the basic ""Capital Chip Chassis"", then you could build the weapons turrets on it to suit your needs. The available weapons would depend on your research, e.g. if you research ion cannons you can build ion cannons on your capital ships, guided missiles you can build missile launchers, etc.  So instead of separate ion/gun/missile destroyers for example, you just use the one customizable chassis. You could put all three weapons on board or specialize the ship in one type."

homeworld,32iov9,Sastrei,1 point,Sat Apr 18 16:15:39 2015 UTC,"Are you setting them into passive mode and issuing a ""stop"" command before attempting to break your fleet off from the engagement?"
homeworld,32iov9,kioni,1 point,Wed Apr 15 02:50:58 2015 UTC,"Well, that would make them stop firing, right? I want them to attack move, and a lot of the time the attack move gets broken (which will usually orient the ship towards the attackers, when maybe you're trying to kite away). It happens with regular move orders as well -- whenever an enemy is nearby.  It makes capital ship micro really frustrating though. You want to move an injured destroyer back? It will forget your order every 5 seconds. If you want your ships to keep firing and moving then spam move commands, I guess."
homeworld,32iov9,Sastrei,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:26:11 2015 UTC,"The idea of the attack move is to orient your ships towards the attackers though, and remain engaged as long as they're in range.

homeworld,32iov9,kioni,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:16:58 2015 UTC,"Well, move or attack move away to the edge of the map, they'll always re-engage after about 5 seconds if enemy ships are in the vicinity. It's relatively easy to recreate. I'll look into passive though."

homeworld,32gyc3,_supert_,2,Mon Apr 13 18:58:56 2015 UTC,It's not that twitchy to control. You'll need to use Shift and CTRL once in a while. Shift lets you adjust the Z axis so the ships go up or down.  You can use just the mouse for everything really. It's not APM intensive as say Starcraft 2.

homeworld,32e4ib,Mannschaft,6,Mon Apr 13 01:14:56 2015 UTC,"I have been working on this for about the last year to year and a half. After ripping all the files from the original game and some mods as well as ""kitbashing"" some of my own ships I had the hard choice of resizing and editing everything to function for a tabletop game called Full Thrust. This meant that some ships such as Hiigaran frigates were repurposed as destroyers and cruisers so that an entire fleet could be made. I also took other liberties such as making the Sajuuk a capital ship for the Vaygr since there weren't mods that added appropriate capitals. I have almost the entire Hiigaran fleet printed but Shapeways is so expensive that it has been slow.  https://www.shapeways.com/shops/omnijackal"
homeworld,32e4ib,epicjam,3,Mon Apr 13 01:15:06 2015 UTC,All ways wanted to play full thrust but the rules are a bit daunting xD at some point I need to convince some buddy's to come try it with me.
homeworld,32e4ib,af_mmolina,1 point,Mon Apr 13 06:48:09 2015 UTC,There are FT Lite rules you can get to ease into the game before trying the full rules. It's very easy once you get a couple games in. Unless you're bad at plotting like I am then you'll find that terrain is your bane.
homeworld,32e4ib,SadisticBuddha,2,Mon Apr 13 07:43:43 2015 UTC,do you have the STLs so we can print ourselves? That website is crazy expensive for something of that scale.
homeworld,32e4ib,SadisticBuddha,2,Mon Apr 13 03:12:00 2015 UTC,Ive been looking into doing this so folks could print them for themselves. The only real issue is quite a few people have taken exception to some of the liberties I've taken or not taken. You'll notice that I did not add modules to the ships (really beefs up the carriers and makes them more expensive) and I've removed many antennas and other details I know shapeways can't print in FUD. With the release of XFUD in a few days everything changes since I'll be able to get more detail from the prints.   All I can say is eventually. Right now I'm working hard on the book that allows you to use these models in Full Thrust.
homeworld,32e4ib,SadisticBuddha,2,Mon Apr 13 04:24:32 2015 UTC,"I play a Wargame called firestorm armada.  I'm heavily into it based on my love of fleet games like homeworld.   Needless to say, you've made my day.   Can I get some measurements of stuff? Preferably in inches.  If it's the right scale I'll place my order next pay day."
homeworld,32e4ib,SadisticBuddha,1 point,Mon Apr 13 04:41:14 2015 UTC,"Firestorm Armada draws a lot of its mechanics from full thrust which is over 20 years old (things like exploding 6s). The Hiigaran titan is 8"" long. Dreadnught is almost 5.5"". Battlecruiser is almost 4"". Cruiser is almost 2.5"". A bomber is just 3/8"" long. I scaled these to be larger like FSA but they might not be quite as large.  Camera is charging. I'll have more pics up soon."
homeworld,32e4ib,BuhDan,1 point,Mon Apr 13 04:56:03 2015 UTC,"That all sounds good, firestorm is measured by flight pegs so that seems passable.   Now to figure what fleet to use them as."
homeworld,32e4ib,epicjam,1 point,Mon Apr 13 05:03:03 2015 UTC,thats why I chose full thrust instead of FSA. FT has built in rules allowing you to design your own ships and then you make your own ship status display to keep track of equipment and damage. The rules are free and there is currently a custom work called the continuum project that adds things to allow you to create ships from anything. We have had Hiigaran vs BFG Eldar vs Battestar Galactica vs Imperal Star Wars before. I will also include a picture of the beta SSD for the battlecruiser.
homeworld,32e4ib,TheRealBramtyr,1 point,Mon Apr 13 05:13:58 2015 UTC,"While that sounds great, one of my best friends and main opponents in Firestorm will break anything like that wide open.

homeworld,32e4ib,Oskiee,1 point,Mon Apr 13 05:34:46 2015 UTC,"All good. I personally don't play against anyone that breaks games like that but it can certainly be abused. Funny thing is we imported FSA into FT :p. At any rate, a few more bad pics are up."

Even after I'm done with my fleet you've made them cheep enough I'll probably pick some up for terrain purposes. Debris and the like, much like Homeworld actual."
homeworld,32dczj,Augsburger_and_fries,8,Sun Apr 12 21:15:59 2015 UTC,Hw2 is fine.
homeworld,32dczj,spotH3D,3,Sun Apr 12 21:47:33 2015 UTC,"Well the engine itself (which is HW2 and thus HW2:R) has for one the Hyperspace overshooting bug, which I'd call major (I stopped playing matches with my friends because of this). It's present in campaign (although it's less an issue there), skirmish and MP.  In short, it's basically that if you hyperspace, instead of travelling up to the destination point (this travel can be seen with hyperspace sensors, those purple blinking balls going forward, representing the ship in hyperspace), it just quickly keeps on going in a straight line until the time it should have take to reach the exit, then it comes out at the destination. So what the problem is, if in the straight path in the direction of your hyperspace travel (draw a line from ship location to where you want to hyperspace to and make that line infinite long), and there's a hyperspace inhibitor on that way, it thinks you travelled into it (since the bubble keeps going past the exit point, the exit isn't triggered by the ship reaching the exit point, but rather by after a set time, and in the meanwhile the ship might have travelled across the whole map in hyperspace).  So an example, in Crimson Bond, you have a nice BC right at your (starting) home base, and you want to send it to the middle asteroid patch (in center of map). Now instead of neatly exiting hyperspace there, it thinks you travelled across the map, right into the main base of the enemy (starting) point, who probably have hyperspace inhibitors, causing your BC to exit lonesome right next to the enemy, which is mostly a bad thing (it's unplanned and it's defenseless against all his bombers and such who'll make quick work of your BC, never mind that smaller than BC sized ships also take lots of damage after bumping into the inhibitor).  The only way to prevent this is to jump from an angle, so that the jump direction doesn't intersect something with an inhibitor.  In my opinion, hyperspace is very iconic to HW, and I often play slow paced matches with friends (who do not want or are not able to rush or play competetively, so we all nicely build up to BC's and such), and this ruins the late gameplay (going from very likely winning situation to absolutely lost in a minute situation, by losing all your BC's and DD's against bombers and corvettes)."
homeworld,32dczj,METROID4,3,Sun Apr 12 23:01:52 2015 UTC,The game elements aren't nerfed they just don't exist in the Homeworld 2 engine. They lost the soul of Homeworld 1 when they ported it into Homeworld 2. I wasn't aware there was something wrong with the tactics in Homeworld 1 remastered.
homeworld,32dczj,Riekopo,3,Mon Apr 13 08:22:09 2015 UTC,"as an extension of the the formations not working correctly for the game, the tactics (Aggressive, Neutral, Passive) don't function at all like the Homeworld I've been playing for 16 years. It's something I very much hope they find a way to fix."
homeworld,32dczj,Riekopo,1 point,Mon Apr 13 09:50:49 2015 UTC,What is wrong with the tactics?
homeworld,32dczj,Ironcl4d,3,Mon Apr 13 19:21:36 2015 UTC,"In the original, units will adjust combat behavior based on tactics. If set to Evasive, they'll break formations in combat and do everything they can to dodge fire, prioritizing their own survival. In Aggressive they stay locked in formation and try to put out as much firepower as possible. Neutral is a balance between the two.  In Remastered all it does is change how units react to fire, ie. actively engage enemies and support friendlies (aggressive), return fire only (defensive) don't fire (passive)"
homeworld,32dczj,achensherd,2,Thu Apr 16 00:44:34 2015 UTC,"Don't get me started on how ineffective the Salvage Corvette has become   Wait, what? The salvage corvette is awesome in HW1:R! They're pretty overpowered given how quickly they can latch onto their victims now, and the fact that they don't use fuel anymore takes away a good amount of babysitting they used to require. There are other issues that make using them more difficult in later missions, such as how you're limited to a dozen of them (I don't remember them being individually capped in Classic... I might be wrong), how carriers can't process captured ships anymore, and how the scaling makes opposing fleet sizes so massive that salvaging can be more expensive than it's worth (e.g. losing 10 ships to capture 5), but up until at least halfway into the campaign they're so overpowered I felt bad using them (okay, not really). I didn't even start building combat corvettes until Mission 6 because the dozen-plus Turanic corvettes I captured up until then were more than enough, and I never built a single frigate in the entire campaign.  As for HW2:R, I encountered no game-breaking issues in my playthrough. There might've been a few minor glitches here and there, but at no point did a mission break or a scripted event not trigger like they often and easily did in HW1:R."
homeworld,32dczj,achensherd,2,Sun Apr 12 22:06:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm just having issues with them then. I can't seem to select groups of enemy unit for capture en masse. It keeps making me individually select my capturing targets. It's super frustrating, and it's costing me units especially in The Sea of Lost Souls.  Thanks a bunch for your input."
homeworld,32dczj,achensherd,2,Mon Apr 13 03:25:20 2015 UTC,"Dude. Sea of Lost Souls. You don't even with the Salvettes. The way I did it a few days ago:   Build tons of Scouts (~30). Build tons of Attack Bombers (40). Move the Attack Bombers to the top of the map, directly above the Ghost Ship and out of range of the defenders. Move the Scouts towards the bottom of the Ghost Ship, close enough to see the defenders but not enough to aggro them. Have the Scouts aggro and then play chicken with the defenders around the bottom of the Ghost Ship while the Attack Bombers attack it from the top. (Note: Do NOT have the Scouts attack or go through the defenders. They will die. Fast.) End mission with ~20 new frigates and a Missile Destroyer.    I lost only 3 Scouts (Sajuuk bless their courageous souls) this way. It took a couple of tries to get right (timing, positioning, etc.), but when I did, hell yes!"
homeworld,32dczj,Wendon,2,Mon Apr 13 05:20:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tactical advisement. Yeah, it seemed like my HW:Classic strategy wasn't going to be effective, if only becasue of the enemy scaling. Makes me wonder what will happen when I get to the Bridge of Sighs."
homeworld,32dczj,clam-down,1 point,Mon Apr 13 05:46:18 2015 UTC,"I was planning to cap them all when I started my playthrough, but once I actually got to the mission, I was like nah, so I maxed out on Attack Bombers and killed the sphere with them while the rest of my fleet dealt with everything else.  It was probably for the better (for my skill level). The opposing fleets in the last couple of missions were scary enough without scaling for 100-150 additional frigates. It took me quite a few tries just to figure out how to keep the fleet that hyperspaces in in front of you in the last mission from one-shotting my Mothership."
homeworld,32dczj,Wendon,1 point,Mon Apr 13 06:51:29 2015 UTC,"THe problem is when you select units to salvage the enemy fleet AI automatically defaults to ONLY attack your salvagers. you want to pause, have your specific groups go next to what you want to salvage, pause again, select them individually where you want to capture, and then unpause."
homeworld,32dczj,Riekopo,1 point,Mon Apr 13 10:58:36 2015 UTC,"Ugh. that's super convoluted. Remember being able to distract units (with scouts or maybe an assault frigate), then having a squadron of Salvage Corvettes swoop in and take four or more enemy units are at once?All you had to do a was hold the shift key and drag a box around the ships you wanted."
homeworld,32dczj,parkus45,1 point,Mon Apr 13 11:13:08 2015 UTC,Im pretty sure they were capped in classic. I think it was 14 though I always remember being annoyed at only being able to cap 7 of the ion frigates at once.

homeworld,3269dn,cjrutherford,4,Fri Apr 10 22:52:25 2015 UTC,"Step 1.  Retire all strike craft that are not attack bombers.   Step 2.  Build as  many attack bombers as possible (if you can max them out,  do it)   Step 3.  Throw them all in a wall formation and order them up and above and then behind the location if the ghost ship.   Step 4.  Once in and behind,  order them towards the ghost ship. When they come in range order them to attack only the ghost ship.   Note : take them out if formation and make sure they are set to neutral or evasive or whatever the lowest aggression tactic is.   This will ensure they will only focus on the ghost ship instead of returning fire.   Step 5.  The ship should be disabled in less than a minute,  usually around 30 seconds.   Expect to lose around 20-30 attack bombers.   Step 6.  Send in salvage corvette unmolested.   As an added note,  if you have a surplus of extra resources you can continually send your capital ships in to get captured.   Then build new ones and then when the ship is disabled you get them all back.   I finished this mission with 28 destroyers."

homeworld,3269dn,RDBRULZ,1 point,Sat Apr 11 03:27:55 2015 UTC,"Odd,  I did a run with a huge fleet going in and still managed to defeat it without issues and that was with around 40-50 assault frigates.   Approaching from the top and rear is a big part of it because it puts the ship between you and the frigates for a vital 10 seconds.    Edit: forgot to add in.   This also worked after the ghost ship had control of between 20-30 destroyers along with assault frigates."

I was trying to get vision on the ship, but as soon as I could see the fleet they moved towards me. The end result is that the guard fleet ended up quite a ways away from the ghost ship. I sent like 10-20 scouts on speed boost to distract the fleet while my bombers hit the ghost ship. Didn't lose more than a few ships in all. Was glorious."

The gameplay is a lot faster than homeworld which is ok for me but I'd like them to slow it down a bit - homeworld had that sci-fi realism that was just so cool.

How customizable will the ships be?  Is it going to be like GalCiv 2/3? Will there be carriers and fleets of fighter to dock and dispatch like in HW?

You can add abilities and buff stats.   Yes. There will be carriers. Some carriers will carry more ships than others.   We have a fantastic writer and connections to some great artists.

I am not an expert but my current fleet has 4 gunships (2 elites, 2 normal) and 8 pulsar gunships (interceptors are good anti fighter and most things are corvette/frigate right now for me anyways). Bombers are extremely adept at taking out cap ships but alone without support they will get torn apart due to their poor anti fighter capabilities.

So far I have to say that HW:R2 plays better in that everything more or less works as they should and did in the original, whereas HW:R1 is still noticeably and sometimes show-stoppingly buggy -- I've had to restart missions more than a few times now due to events not triggering properly, the enemy behaving oddly, etc.  Gunships are incredibly important in HW:R2, and will be a mainstay of your fleet from the moment they're available to the very last mission due to how strikecraft-heavy the Vaygr are. Interceptors have their uses, but not so much for making things dead quickly."

I'd heard the fighters had pathing issues but I never noticed anything that bad until this happened. I really hope Gearbox can fix this, it's kinda ridiculous."

homeworld,31scqa,Riekopo,4,Tue Apr 7 20:03:08 2015 UTC,"The excuse was the lost source code, which is completely true, I listened to a podcast describing what had possibly happened coming from the perspective of two devs in the company at the time. It got lost from the devs at one point during company buy-outs or company closings. (I forgot which, please do not quote me on this.)  BUT, the two devs said that the biggest challenge would not be the source code, but the engine, They said once remastered was released that it would be relatively easy to recreate Cataclysm from scratch.  Edit: The postcast was popular during the Remastered release week, I can go back to find it later, I'm at work right now."
homeworld,31scqa,realdor,2,Tue Apr 7 23:25:05 2015 UTC,"That may be so, but to be able to distribute a Classic version, the source code is required. Remastered could conceivably with some effort be rebuilt into the Remastered engine without much complication."
homeworld,31scqa,pheylan-cavanaugh,3,Wed Apr 8 22:26:10 2015 UTC,I'm guessing they'd need the sourcecode to be able to recompile it and redistribute it for modern systems.

I'm currently living aboard a massive Mothership run by a human whose nervous system has been integrated into its CPU core.  We are the last survivors of our people, and we about to hyperspace toward a nebula where we will be able to rest, refuel, and rebuild our fleet, following a messy encounter with some asteroids.  Is this a good idea?  Do you guys have any other suggestions for possible routes we should take?  Also, what goes better against the backdrop of the galactic core: hardwood or tile?"
homeworld,312qp2,chordial,7,Wed Apr 1 17:36:54 2015 UTC,"Hmm, Nebulae tend to glow a lot. I'd invest in some heavy duty curtains. See if your local production facility has some.

homeworld,314a2b,Freelance_JIDF_Shill,4,Wed Apr 1 22:10:30 2015 UTC,"Just a note, these are my opinions and my understanding of the game so no warranty comes standard. However, this did get me through both the hw1 and hw2 campaigns pretty easily.  This will contain a brief overview of most units (that I remember). This is only for campaigns so vaygr and taiidan units are omitted. This is also slightly dated since I haven't played in a few weeks.  Fighters    Scouts: Cheep, move quick, have large sensor area, don't attack well at all. Use for scouting (duh) and distraction.     Interceptors: Anti-fighter. These are moderately expensive as fighters go, but are good at killing other fighters (scouts, bombers, etc.). Not good at anything else. Fast and easy to kill.  Bombers: Kill rigates and caps really quickly (if you have a few squads). Also good against subsystems in Hw2 but sometimes It's actually faster to kill the ship instead of a subsytem. Slow.  (1)Defender: The only really viable fighter in Hw1 till you get drone frigates, protecs againt other strike craft well, heavily armored, and slow.  Corvettes    (1)Repair corvette: Low armor, med speed, low damage. Repairs shit corvette size and up. Max these out for ez mode.  (1)Light corvette: only usefull untill you get heavy corvettes, don't really bother with them  (1)Heavy corvette: kills fighters and other corvettes, better against fighters and does it's job ok.  (1)Salvage corvette: steals everything and anything. These are the best things in the world in hw1.  (2)Gunship Corvette (or whatever it's called): Anti-fighter. Dies really easy but is good at killing fighters and ok at killing corvettes.  (2)Pulsar corvette: Anti-corvette. really good at killing corvettes and ok at damaging frigates. Sucks against fighters.  (2)Mine Layer: Lays mines. If you can get a cap ship into a mine field, it'll die (thoes things HURT). Only usefull in MP.  Frigates    (1)Support Frigate: Can dock corvettes and fighters to repair and repair caps ships with a beam.   (1)Assault frigate: Jack of all trades frigate. Pretty good against everything really, but has rather low armor. The most common sound I heard in Hw1 was ""Assault frigate lost"".  (2)Flack Frigate: Anti-fighter frigate in hw2. Shreds fighters like nothing else. Can't kill anything else.  Ion Frigate: Anti-cap ion beam Frigate. Kills caps/frigates easily but will die really quickly to strike craft because the ion cannon is it's only gun. Make lots  (2)Marine Frigate: The shitter, slower, less effective cousin of the salvage corvette. Don't bother with them until later in hw2 when you can cap battle cruisers (can't cap production ships in hw2).  (2)Torpedo Frigate: Anti-corvette and anti frigate (with research upgrades). Kills corvettes quickly and frigates semi-quickly but that's it. Only tickles caps.  (2)Defense Field Frigate: bubble shield around your craft. Stops things from hitting things inside the bubble (they can still fly in). Short duration. Not really usefull in hw2 except for a few key missions w/special upgrades. Don't build.  (1)Drone Frigate: Spawns a bunch of gun drones that TARE SHIT UP. Once you get this research make like 4 and you'll never have to worry about strike craft ever again. Probably my favorite overall ship from both games.  (1)Grav Well Frigate: Deploys a grav well that immobilizes all strike-craft in an area. Has no guns but a lot of health. Effect has long duration but the ship takes damage while field is active. Really fun in multiplier if you can use them right.  Capital Ships    Destroyer: Anti cap, anti frigate. In hw1 these things are monstrous and should be captured/built when possible as they not only tare apart capships but also are (for some reason) good against corvette. In HW2 they're ok, but not great. Will need support to survive against anything but cap ships.  Battle cruiser/heavy cruiser: Anti cap, anti frigate. REALLY, REALLY good. Capture/build as many as you can. These will tare apart everything and anything in their way. Once again, they require much more support in Hw2.  Carrier: Good for carring strike craft safety, mobile RU drop off, and remote build points. Not much too this.  (2)Shipyard:  Only in hw2. Basically a second mother ship, it has 2 more subsystem mounts then your MS and is the only production ship capable of building battle cruisers. Get one ASAP. It's also SUUUUPER slow, the slowest unit in the game. So keep track of it.  Support    Resource collector: mines RU and collects debris pieces. In hw1 they are much bigger, more armored, and more expensive then the hw2 version. In hw2 they can be used to repair your ships (After research).  Resource Controller: A drop-off point for collectors so they don't have to fly all the way to a mothership/carrier.  (1)Research Station: lets you research. In the original game building more then one would let you research faster/concurrently. In this game building more has no effect other then wasting resources.  Utility     Probe: One-shot sensor ship. Super fast and has massive sensor bubble.  Proximity Sensor: One-shot sensor ship. Slower and less effective then the normal probe, however it can also see cloaked ships (or ones hidden in a dust cloud).  (2)Sensor Jammer: One-shot sensor ship. Blocks ships sensors. Not quite sure how well this works since I've never used it.  Platforms (hw2 only)    Gun Platform: Anti strike-craft platform. One-shot movement, super fast, high armor, high damage.  Ion Platform: Anti-frigate/cap platform. One-shot movement, super fast, high armor, high damage.    It's rather late here so please let me know if I missed anything/need to clarify something. I'll edit this post tomorrow if thats the case.  Anything prefixed with (1) is hw1 specific and (2) is hw2 specific."

Do I have to keep my fleet in formation with the drone ships on the ""outside"" so that the drones can do their job or do the drones just blow up on enemy strike crafts and all I have to do is press D. It's unrelated, but how do you reinforce a control group? The only way I know how is to select the old ships+ the new ships and then assign the group again. But that's very difficult to do in battle, so I'm asking if there is a different way."

That doesn't imply all ships within a category of ships are good against another though and units in game have a description of what they are good against (and weak versus!).  The Hiigaran frigates have a range of tasks they can work in, such as anti strike craft with the flak, corvettes with the torpedo frigares, and capitals with the ion frigates in sufficient numbers along with the sneaky marine frigates for unescorted destroyers, carriers, battlecruisers, and even shipyards. (Note that the hiigarans also have the most options for frigate play in the game)  For the state of the game right now formations don't matter much except for keeping things pretty till the fight starts.   Docking for HW2 races replenishes lost units in a squad for strikecraft (those speed upgrades can help a hurt squad make it back to base). Choosing when to dock is a matter of the battle, no point in docking if that squad is going to get chased down and torn apart from behind without support to be swapping forces in and out at will.  There are a few ways you can use control groups. I organize mine by ships. All interceptors in one, bombers in another, torpedo frigates, marine frigates, destroyers, etc.  But as the goes on and my fleet grows I get more macro and start grouping more in. Lets say, destroyers and ion frigates on 5 for anti-capital, pulsars and torpedoes in 3 for anti corvette, etc. This lets me bandbox an opponents units of a type to focus, then I micro the strikecraft battle until I win there and work my way up.

This is where fleet composition comes in. Having what counters them, but not what they counter.  Docking for HW1 will still heal the individual units, but isn't as advantageous to do during battles. Also all of the homeworld remastered is in the HW2 engine so there are some quirks. Right now corvettes aren't that great against fighters for HW1 races. The multiguns do okay, but they should do great...  For campaign having salvage corvettes and stealing capital ships is a great way to grow your fleet. I play maxed out on them, always.  The organization is really a preference thing. I use bandbox'ing and like to be able to focus my counters down on the enemy fleet (ai or person). Take a mixed fleet and bandboxing they will cycle threw  their counters first, but perhaps in a bit more mixed fashion than you want such as focusing on 1-3 squads and 1 destroyer instead of a bit to each of the 3.

homeworld,30zv4u,Demosthenes01101,5,Wed Apr 1 17:35:02 2015 UTC,"Howdy everyone! As was sorta mentioned in previous posts (from @scole, @Burleson) - we've been working on changes for balance, but also back-end code changes to facilitate larger edits to ship and simulation behavior.  Well, I have some bad news, and some good news, I think. I'm going to cover what we were attempting to do, the results/issues - and then what we're thinking will work going forward.  Early Thinking First - when looking at what the HW2 engine did with HW1 units that was most difficult to script-update, we found that the code-level distinction between 'Squadrons' and 'Strike-groups' was at the core of most issues. In the HW2 engine Squadrons can be forced to act (mostly) as a single object in terms of movement/pathing/engagement. A Squadron can be a single ship (most units, especially HW1), or a group (the more attack-oriented HW2 units). When placing Squadrons into Strike-groups the game would drive them as a unified whole only up until an engagement was reached - at which point they break off. This is normal for HW2 - but quite unlike HW1.  After much digging we settled on the approach of overlaying Strike-groups with a 'virtual' Squadron - since they coordinate as a group and can be configured to stick together. But... this really didn't go well. The code and systems it defines are just much, much too layered to effectively do this (I banged my head against this wall for nearly 2 weeks). I can go into plenty of details about why - though people without access to the code won't get much benefit from any additional information.  So, I think 2 weeks of effort with little to show can be termed 'the bad news'.  Present Thinking This week we've been talking more about how to accomplish some of our goals (a more HW1-like experience for HW1 races, less problematic cross-race balancing, more effective AI use of races) - and one approach has been chosen for more investigation. And we think it's 'the good news'.  Squadrons in HW2 work pretty well. They act generally like HW1 'Formations' when of the same units and physical layout (not exactly, no, but close). The trouble is that HW1 units are single-build, and HW2 units are group-build - and neither has the flexibility to modify their Squadron 'affinity'. So what if, instead of hacking at Strike-groups, we made Squadrons more flexible? Here's the plan:  Remove Squadron heal (when you take 1 Ship into a docking and out comes X fully-healed units) - if X units go into a dock, X fully-healed units come out, no more, no less. Allow Ships to leave a Squadron. When selecting a Squadron and choose the 'leave formation' icon, the ships become single units. HW1 units gain HW2-like multi-ship builds by default: The same class of ship in HW2 that builds in multiples will build in HW1 as multiples. Since they can leave Squadrons, you can easily revert to the 'old' single-ship approach. Forming a Strike-group becomes content aware: -- A Strike-group will instead form a Squadron when possible. -- 'Possible' means ships of the same type, and a Formation that Squadron supports. -- If you form a Strike-group from many types of units, you get the HW2 Strike-group behavior (loosely coordinated single ships) -- If you form a Strike-group from Squadron-eligible units, you get a Squadron; with all of the 'coordinated' behavior that implies - more like HW1 acted. -- This allows for 'mega Squadrons' of things like Bombers, Interceptors, etc. 50+ units, all moving and working together, adjusting formation, etc. A Strike-group formed of Squadrons (including multi-ship types) would break them into single ships and use them more like HW1 layouts - aka a bunch of 'delta' multi-ship Squadrons with some other units placed into a wall Strike-group will form a wall - not a wall with deltas dangling off it. When that Strike-group is broken, you'd have to re-form your multi-ship Squadrons again. -- During development we may add an 'auto break' command that takes a mixed-use Strike-group and breaks it into a number of single-ship and multi-ship Squadrons as best is possible for you. Your Turn! We very much want to hear what people think of these ideas - issues, benefits, related ideas, etc. Talk to us... smile"
homeworld,30zv4u,Demosthenes01101,2,Wed Apr 1 17:52:26 2015 UTC,Thanks!  I think someone needs to tell them that a lot of what they are referencing is very difficult to understand if your head hasn't been in the code for a couple of months!   But essentially it seems to boil down to an option to use HW1 style or HW2 style in BOTH HW1R and HW2R.

homeworld,30zv4u,MarikBentusi,8,Sun Apr 5 20:46:11 2015 UTC,"Gonna be the negative one here, but if I understood everything correctly, that just sounds like a bandaid solution to me:   without squad heal but with squad building in HW1, it's gonna be pretty tedious to restore your formations. Say you always want to keep 14 interceptors around, divided into 2 deltas with 7 units each. If you lose 2 units but can only build a pack of 5, you've got to build that pack of five, break it up into individual units, reassign your groups, and then recycle the leftover 3 fighters. By that point you might as well just implement HW2 squads for HW1 races (which can't be the point of this exercise) While bigger homogeneous groups sound nice, obviously it stops working once you're trying stuff like Defender wings moving with Destroyers or an Ion frigate wall with a Defense frigate in the center or fun stuff like that. doesn't fix sphere formation not interacting correctly with guard order (which you'd expect to project a sphere around the guard target, but actually just creates a sphere of bodyguards that dangles around the VIP)   Seeing how HWR's engine is a mod of the HW2 engine which is a mod of the HW1 engine, is there really no viable way of hacking more than just bigger textures into it? Or is the assigned Gearbox team just out of resources for this project to provide more than bugfixes and bandaids?"
homeworld,30zv4u,BiznessCasual,5,Wed Apr 1 09:34:29 2015 UTC,"The HW2 engine is not a mod of the HW1 engine from my understanding; it was a completely new engine that was built from the ground up. The implications of the differences in the engines was covered in the first ""bad news"" section of the post.

The modding community's already done quite a great job at bringing back certain HW1 gameplay features or emulating them to the best of their ability, but having access to the source code expands on those possibilities drastically of course.  Idk to me this seems to trade one problem for another without fixing most issues, I don't think it's a change worth its resources."

If they break off formation during combat, won't they become just another kind of useless? (the side ends of the delta wing taking ages to get into combat)  Also the thing that scares me a bit. Will squadrons eat strikegroup slots if we have to make a strikegroup to make a squadron? I mean having only 10 squadrons is already limitation by itself (especially with salvage corvettes). If I decide I like 3 fighter wings, will they each take a strikegroup slot from me?"

(I never played HW1 classic, that's what all this thing with formations is about right?)   It's not that they act like a single entity, but that they stay in formation (if you want them to) relative to each other, which gives them much more versatility.  This video does a pretty good job of explaining the difference between how formations work in HW:C and HW:R:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx0uxR2kZy8"
homeworld,30zv4u,Elr3d,3,Wed Apr 1 14:14:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's what I had in mind, thanks for the video!  So in the forum thread OP linked I didn't understand that this new approach squadrons will accomplish that. He basically says they'll give HW:R strikecraft squadron versatility to allow you to produce them in bulk (potentially allowing you to change the amount produced at a time) and associate them so they can work as HW2 strikecraft works. HW2 strikecraft wings keep the same target (unlike what we can see in this video) but (sometimes?) spread after the initial attack, so I don't think this will achieve the cohesive attack pattern we see in your video. But it will be a lot better than now, to be sure!"
homeworld,30zv4u,Elr3d,2,Wed Apr 1 14:21:47 2015 UTC,"No I think you misunderstand. First understand the difference between a formation and a strike group. In HW2, strike groups were groups of formations. Formations themselves were not definable, but automatically applied to a set of fighters. There is no HW2 equivalent to formations. They first attempted to use strike groups to replace formations, but it did not work because a group of ships in a strike group broke apart upon attack.   The new proposal is to take the strike group functionality and apply it to single unit types to build what was auto formations so that a single group of unit types in a strike group would become and act like a single HW2 squadron only now able to break apart or add more units to a squadron. If you take a group of different fighter types and put them into a formation/strike group, they will form up by type and form into a strike group of formation types. For example, if you had 10 interceptors and 5 bombers and put them into a claw formation, you would end up with 2 claws acting together in a strike group.   How they build (by ones or multiples) is still being worked out. But the biggest change would be the loss of HW2 fighter replenishment by docking."
homeworld,30zv4u,RaZorwireSC2,1 point,Wed Apr 1 15:40:19 2015 UTC,"Yes that's what I understood, sorry if I wasn't very clear about it. When I say ""squadron"" I mean ""fighter wing"" (as in ""a unit of interceptors""), IIRC strike groups in HW2 are created by selecting multiple units and then assigning a tactic to them (when you move a strikegroup you have only one ""dot"" to tell you where it ends up, while when you move multiple ships you have a ""dot"" per ship or unit)  But basically what this means from my understanding is that the end result won't be the formations in HW1, but rather HW1 fighters using the HW2 formation behaviour, with a way of customizing how many fighters/corvette there is in a given formation.  What I mean is that in HW2, fighters don't keep formation when fighting, and with the system they want to implement well they won't either, so we won't get the exact same result that we have in the video above, but rather the HW2 fighters behaviour, that is everyone spreads when engaging fights (or something to the same effect, I remember Vaygr corvettes usually stayed in pairs for instance) but focus the same target. Which would be better than what we have now, I have absolutely no problem with that.  Or is there no difference between a HW1 5-fighter formation behavior and a HW2 fighter wing behavior? As i said I have no knowledge of how HW1 works, but I played HW2 a lot.  Also good point on repairing lost units. With such a system the feature isn't necessary, although it may be a pain to micro to replenish fighter squadrons."
homeworld,30zv4u,ckoerner,1 point,Wed Apr 1 16:01:11 2015 UTC,"In HW1, when you put a group of units in s formation, the acted similar to the way fighter squadrons worked in HW2. So a group of five HW1 interceptors in delta formation would look and act similar to a single HW2 interceptor wing. There is a video earlier in this thread demonstrating."
homeworld,30zv4u,CaptainKirkAndCo,1 point,Wed Apr 1 17:05:59 2015 UTC,"HW2 strikecraft wings keep the same target (unlike what we can see in this video) but (sometimes?) spread after the initial attack, so I don't think this will achieve the cohesive attack pattern we see in your video   That was kind of my impression as well. Hard to know how it will look until we can see it in action, I guess."
homeworld,30zv4u,sk_2013,3,Wed Apr 1 15:34:01 2015 UTC,I watched that video with ardent attention to understand the differences. I freaking lost it when Yakety Sax came on.
homeworld,30zv4u,TheLightningL0rd,2,Wed Apr 1 17:37:04 2015 UTC,Pretty rational solution to the problem I think. Can't wait to see it in action!

homeworld,30zv4u,Rogue100,2,Wed Apr 1 19:19:13 2015 UTC,"Fantastic news. I was wondering when we'd see an update on this. So we're possibly going to have a reworking of both HW1 and HW2 formations/squadrons/strike groups to blend the best of all attributes and level the playing field with the different races. I'm pretty excited about this.  Of course this could add more time needed to test and prolong the multiplayer beta and may affect the singleplayer missions in peculiar ways, but I do believe it's a step in the right direction. Hopefully it'll turn out well."
homeworld,30zv4u,5larm,2,Wed Apr 1 20:29:42 2015 UTC,Still delighted how in depth they're getting into this with the community.  It maybe suggests a small tightly knit team but they seem to really care.  I hope there's some really interesting lessons learned from this process they can put into use for any prospective sequels.  Successfully gelling the HW and HW2 systems together could create a whole new way to control ships better than either game with more and more fine tuning available.
homeworld,30zv4u,HorrificAnalInjuries,2,Wed Apr 1 21:05:14 2015 UTC,"This is interesting. Will need to wait and see how it actually works in practice, but this solution may have legs. A couple of things I'm unsure of though.  First, I don't see why this solution necessitates making HW1 races build in groups rather than single ships. If ships can go into/out of squdrons, why can't HW1 races just continue to build ships individually. They would still then be able to put them into a squadron.  Second, for any units that do initially build in squads, I wonder if, after adding them to a larger squadron, will they return to their original squad when that larger squadron is broken up?  Last, unless the answer is simply that the code is too complex to do it easily (which may well be the case), I'm not seeing why squadrons can only contain ships of the same class. Why can't the speed from whatever the slowest ship in a squadron is be applied to every ship in the squadron, while that squadron exists?"

I'm particularly interested in what they are gonna do about grav well generators.  I don't think its fair that HW1 races get to just disable all strike craft immediately and HW2 races don't.    All this and they could have just released HW2 remastered for 30 bucks and put in the fucking work to make an actual remaster of HW1 later.  HW1 is going to go so far off the rails that it might as well be a F2P mobile reboot by the end of all this."

homeworld,30zllv,hyroohimolil,15,Tue Mar 31 23:43:25 2015 UTC,"I have noticed there is very little English posting about the Fairy Empire Mod, also known as Yaodu Mod, for HW2 Classic. This is inexcusable!! It adds three new races, a library of amazingly well designed and intricate ships for both old and new factions, and a fully-featured single player game mode that opens up the Homeworld galaxy to you for trade, exploration and conquest in the time after the Hyperspace Gate network opens. To try and fix that, I'll be giving a short tutorial on how to get started and some insights that I've derived from playing the v1.05 Yaodu English Translation!"
homeworld,30zllv,FortunePaw,8,Tue Mar 31 23:46:56 2015 UTC,"The first step is install: the mod can be found on their moddb page at http://www.moddb.com/mods/yaodumod where they also have a nice video of basic Trading Mode gameplay. Download the files and follow the instructions: place the mod docs into the HW2 data directory, located in your steam folder if you are playing Remastered. The mod will not appear in the mod launch window: to launch Yaodu, go to your Steam games library, right click on Homeworld Remastered, click Properties, then Set Launch Options, and paste in the following console command:  -mod yaodumod.big,yaodumodpatch.big,yaodumoden.big Then, start the game through steam, select Homeworld 2 Classic, and you're started! once you get past the splash screen you'll be met with a rousing orchestral score and a lot of untranslated chinese menu options. Fear not! I'll help you navigate this hurdle next."
homeworld,30zllv,Draakje,8,Tue Mar 31 23:53:16 2015 UTC,"Before you start playing, to make sure everything works properly, create a new profile with the 5th button down from the top. This will take you to an english language menu right out of HW2 classic, so it will be easy to navigate and accomplish. Once that is done, you can mess around with the new factions in Skirmish mode (third button from the top) or jump right into trading mode! Hit the second button from the top to go to the trading mode start screen, and click the large panel on the right under the words ""please select..."" to begin! You will be dropped with a handful of dollars and a small trading ship into the bustling tradeport at Balcora gate. There will be a lot of things around you and not much guidance: the mod takes the sink-or-swim approach to learning to play, but I feel like that really adds to the ""stranger in a strange land"" feeling of the gameplay! I'll do what I can to make your jump into the world an easy one."
homeworld,30zllv,Gasparatan,7,Wed Apr 1 00:04:03 2015 UTC,"A new button is placed next to build/launch/research on the right hand panel: this untranslated purple button brings up your inventory, showing you what is in your cargo hold. You will start out with a small amount of ammunition, Maintenance supplies (which are consumed while repairing), Hydrogen fuel (Consumed by strike craft in flight), Antimatter fuel (Consumed by hyperspacing, despite how it may appear ingame a hyperspace jump will never cost RUs) and Basic Supplies (consumed by your fleet at a set, steady rate. Don't run out, or you will lose RUs over time, be unable to hyperspace, and your fleet will travel at half velocity!) A good early-game move is to visit the trading stations around you and stock up on these staple supplies: a few hundred Basic Supplies, fifty Antimatter Fuel, and a hundred Maintenance Supplies will last you a good long time. To access these trading stations, use the sensor manager to see Objective pings lighting up the structures and ships that you can trade with. Move close to them via conventional drives or hyperspace jump and left-click on the trading station to bring up the trade menu."
homeworld,30zllv,FRR-Wriath,8,Wed Apr 1 00:09:23 2015 UTC,"In the trade menu, there are two different screens: Ships, and Inventory Items. Toggle between these screens with the large orange cycle button in the center. To sell items from your inventory, select them from the left side panel by clicking on them. The left-side entry field will indicate how many you can sell, while the text field above it has some (poorly translated but still sometimes helpful) information about the item. The large button next to the entry field will commit and sell that item in that amount to the station. Be aware, it's possible to sell an item for 0 dollars to a station that does not value that item! To buy, select an item on  the right-hand item pane. The item entry field will indicate the maximum amount that you can either afford or fit in your cargo hold, whichever number is smaller. Enter your amount there and hit the large button next to the entry field to buy. The small orange button in the corner of the trading window closes the menu and brings you back to real time. An important trading mechanic is loading speed: loading large amounts of goods takes time, but the speed is increased the closer your fleet is to the trading station and the more loading ships you have available. Strike craft, small hangar-based industrial ships, and other launchables can be launched to increase transfer rate, just don't forget to dock them before you take the stargate to the next zone."
homeworld,30zllv,DonNguyenKnives,7,Wed Apr 1 00:17:52 2015 UTC,"Now that you've gathered some basic supplies, it's time to jump to the next zone: navigate to the Imperial Colony jumpgate and click on it to activate it. All ships within a set radius will automatically enter a hyperspace jump and go through the gate. If any ships are outside that radius, move them closer to trigger the jump and complete the map transfer. There are about a dozen different systems connected by these gates, some of which are hidden and have to be scouted out in the zones where they are found! Press T to bring up an (untranslated) galactic map. It isn't very helpful at first, but as you explore you'll have a better feel for where the locations are. That's pretty much it! You'll find events, missions, attacking fleets, desperate escapes, amazing profits, crushing defeats, and tales of triumph all your own in this amazing Homeworld sandbox adventure! If you have any more questions or troubles getting started in the Fairy Empire mod, just let me know and I'll do what I can to help!"
homeworld,30zllv,Kiita-Ninetails,7,Wed Apr 1 00:26:06 2015 UTC,"One last thing before I go: I either have not figured out the mechanic to increase Population or it was not implemented in 1.05. 50 Population is the starting amount, which is enough for a very modest trading fleet or enough combat ships to do some of the earlier combat missions, but it closes off most of the game to you. To manually increase it, open up the Profiles folder in the HW2 directory and find the profile on which you are playing: the documents can be edited in a text editor to increase your population limit. 50 is a good place to start, 500 is a good midgame level, and 1000 will give you enough of a fleet to take on any challenge (provided you can afford the ships to fill it) but feel free to set it to a very large number when you first begin if you don't fancy having a unit limit ceiling!"

Corvettes work properly and fit into their old roles, capital ships now have roughly equal range and fairly comparable dps/hp values, minelayers now have a basic attack command, and the game sounds like it should. Koopak's and Mechwarrior's BulletMod has been fully incorporated and expanded upon, bringing simulated projectiles to every single kinetic weapon in the game in both single player and multi-player. The singleplayer has been adjusted with more competent Kadeshi and Turanics along with even more aggravating Progenitors. Homeworld 2 races have been completely reworked and now play more similarly to the Homeworld 1 races with comparable firepower across all ship classes.  The latest update heavily modifies the fighter balance and makes the armor values for all ships roughly equivalent to those of HW1 along with fixing a vanilla bug that prevented the Kadeshi and Turanic motherships from rotating to fire.

These included as many as ten rapid fire point defense guns for dealing with corvettes and fighters, and two large ion cannons for dealing with frigates and capital ships. In the rear of the ship was the entrance to the hangar bay, allowing fighters to be safely launched even while the Lord is bringing its heavy weapons to bear. While these ships would be excellent on the offensive, most Turanic fleets use them as last resort weapons due to the cost of constructing one of these essential ships.

homeworld,30jmlr,ErroneousBosch,3,Sat Mar 28 01:28:49 2015 UTC,"Sketchfab is not necessarily a resource for people to download 3d content. It's a platform for 3d content producers to share their work. Sharing in the sense of showing off and presenting.  It's primarily just a 3d web viewer to overcome the limitations of presenting 3d models as 2d images.  Yes, there's an option to enable downloads, but most people don't use it, as in this case of Gearbox. I don't know the details of how they prevent that content is leaked(as in 3d and 2d source files), but I presume they have some safety measures in place, so getting the source files that would allow you to print sketchfab models is not trivial."

homeworld,30lic0,AlexisFR,2,Sat Mar 28 13:30:10 2015 UTC,"Where is your screen shot?  Also, for the last mission, Sajuuk can hyperspace, but he doesn't have much health. Jump him above or below a planet killer and let him go to town on the nearby shipyard or carrier, then kill the planet killer, then jump to the next one.  As for the ADWs coming in, either position intercepters or fly gun platforms to about half map right in their path on the left and the right. Put them on aggressive but keep an eye on them if you use interceptors, they'll stray.  The rest of your fleet goes right up the gut to deal with the BCs and. Ideally you can position so you can hit top or bottom armor. They freak out and instantly attack marine frigates and resource collectors set to repair, use that to keep your big guns in the fight a little longer. Set your carriers, and shipyard to continuously pump out destroyers, frigates (I like torpedo frigates personally), corvettes/bombers and resource collectors (keep trying to get them on repair of your cap ships). Your carriers should be close so their reinforcements are quick to the fight. And use waypoints. Keep an eye out for ADWs sneaking through your main battle.  Good luck!"
homeworld,30lic0,generallyincorrect,3,Sat Mar 28 16:35:27 2015 UTC,"neat trick for getting Sajuuk to very quickly deal with the BCs: since they are in a line, and Sajuuk's beam 1) hits multiple targets  and 2) has a 20km range, you can jump Sajuuk next to one poor bastard at one end and order him to fire upon the poor bastard at the other end.  result: all of them take damage, especially the one clostest because of point defenses.  Those nanite cannons (the red lasers) deal 6k damage each and every hit, and that damage adds up."
homeworld,30lic0,HorrificAnalInjuries,1 point,Sun Mar 29 14:35:46 2015 UTC,"Sweet!  I'll have to try that.  I usually have Sajuuk kill the BCs from the front where it's slow to train, and while waiting for that to be over, catch missiles with platforms."

homeworld,30lic0,HorrificAnalInjuries,2,Tue Mar 31 00:36:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not OP, but in my mission 13 I was up against 7 battlecruisers + supporting shps, while ~80 heavy missile frigates pounded on the power supplies (my fleet was maxed except for a couple of carriers, plus 100k RU). The scaling on that mission is ridiculous.  EDIT: http://i.imgur.com/mmIDMma.jpg"
homeworld,30lic0,Qesa,2,Sun Mar 29 13:25:53 2015 UTC,"Yep, same here, though I did come out of this one less scathed (with all power supplies saved, to boot) than Mission 14, where you have to deal with that death-ball of battlecruisers and destroyers parked next to Makaan.  I'm pretty sure I'll do better in future replays, but by the end of my last one a few days ago, I was struggling with RUs due to the number of times I had to essentially rebuild my fleet."
homeworld,30lic0,achensherd,2,Sun Mar 29 23:23:49 2015 UTC,"I actually made a serious profit on that mission. I sacrificed the top and bottom power supplies (given that the frigates destroyed them before anything bigger than a corvette could reach them...). Took on the cruiser wall by rallying all my frigates at it, while my own BCs took them out one at a time. Mission ended when I killed the shipyard and the frigates attacking the left power supply, despite the fact that there were still about 60 heavy missile frigates alive and gunning for my mothership. Lost 30-odd frigates in the process, but not a single destroyer or cruiser. Ended the mission with a full fleet and 180k in the bank.  14 for me was a cakewalk, I think my total losses were like 3 frigates."

HW1 had a better story, imo, which is another reason its reviews were so stellar.

That the first game's engine is fine can be seen in the communities porting work on the source code (and also on HWC which is based on it)"
homeworld,30jxb8,gondur,2,Tue Mar 31 20:50:49 2015 UTC,"HW1 was completely groundbreaking.  Nothing like it had ever been done, so it's regarded so highly in large part because of this.  From a gameplay standpoint, there were many improvements made in HW2.  I personally preferred the UI layout in HW2, and the campaign action pacing in HW2 was much better in my mind.  HW1 is my favorite though, because I liked the story better and because I have a soft, fuzzy spot for it in my heart because it was the first.  The big knock on RM right now is strike craft behavior and how formations are now mostly cosmetic.  Personally, I don't really care about that.A lot of these folks that take issue to this also don't like the chance-hit system used in combat over HW1 ballistic combat.  They argue that ballistic combat is more real and it takes away from the experience.  If you think about it, maintaining formations during engagements would be a HUGE no-no.  Targeting systems would easily be able to map out flight paths for entire wings and wipe them out.  If you can, watch footage of an actual dogfight. There are no formations; it turns to chaos once the bullets start flying.  HW2 strike craft behavior is more realistic, but this gets completely ignored because it doesn't fit the HW1 faithful's narrative."
homeworld,30jxb8,BiznessCasual,2,Sat Mar 28 16:44:39 2015 UTC,"And also because it significantly reduces the effectiveness of strike craft, due to less focused fire on a single target that formations provided in homeworld 1.  Not everything can be blamed on people wanting something unrealistic."

My real problem is that they did absolutely no work to try and make the HW1 ships work in HW2 mechanics, and the HW2 MP maps are absolutely boring.  They are all small, flat little arenas designed around 15 minute battles.  At any rate, the least they could have done was to make sure it made sense to put HW1 ships into HW2."
homeworld,30jxb8,Weentastic,1 point,Sat Mar 28 14:16:27 2015 UTC,HW1 mechanics were broken due to the physics engine. As are almost all other RTSes that used a physics engine. Artifacts in those engines are hard to deal with and exploits abound. They really didn't have much choice.

The QQ of the remaster came from hw1 mechanics that don't work well within hw2 engine. Besides, hw1 was released first so apparently nostalgia is strong with it.  This is why you shouldn't judge something by people's words but your own impression. Why do you regard so-called 'veterans' constant whining true if you didn't play either games?

homeworld,30jxb8,GreenTyr,4,Sat Mar 28 21:02:53 2015 UTC,"Personally, I like the gameplay in HW1 better.  HW1 has much more micro-potential since formations work and tactics matter and capital ships have more armor in the front, etc, ships are less expendable since you have more options for repairing and maintaining them rather than replaceing them, and the ship type balance means that having a more balanced fleet is more viable as opposed to the ""frigates are cannon fodder""-theme HW2 is going for. I even like the fuel mechanic, though I seem to be the only one who does.  HW2 does a lot of cool stuff as well. I appreciate the higher pace (not so much for the campaign, but for the multiplayer), I like the modules and subsystems, and many of the ship designs are really cool. Ultimately though, the main point for me is that there just seems like there is much less to actually do in a fight.   You tell your ships what to attack and when to pull back, and it doesn't go much further than that. Formations are irrelevant, tactics are usually not necessary to bother with, capital ships don't need to be moved to hit the weaker parts of other ships, and so on. HW1 has more depth, in that regard. HW2 has more options in construction and research, which I like, but actually controlling your fleet in battle feels much more shallow, unfortunately."
homeworld,30jxb8,RaZorwireSC2,2,Sun Mar 29 00:18:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's the story for me. The campaign/story in HW was far better, with amazing innovative gameplay.

homeworld,30hi93,Iam_TheHegemon,3,Fri Mar 27 12:50:08 2015 UTC,hw1 they would spit quick missiles. hw:r they trickle out slower missiles that have trouble connecting. then there's the missile volley ability which is utterly useless since it is single target and barely scratches cap ships.
homeworld,30hi93,kioni,1 point,Fri Mar 27 16:58:06 2015 UTC,"Okay, so the ROF really has been nerfed?? Glad I'm not imagining things....  Any idea if there's plans to improve either the volley or the speed in updates? To my mind both sold be fixed to restore the MD to usefulness...."
homeworld,30hi93,Foreverclear82,2,Fri Mar 27 17:08:06 2015 UTC,"the RoF hasn't changed much, but in HW1 there used to be a bank of missile reserves that would build up when the Missile Destroyer wasn't firing. Then when it did get in combat it would fire reserve of missiles all as quickly as possible in a sort of alpha strike until the reserve was expended, then it would go back to about the trickle you see now."
homeworld,30hi93,Zoloir,1 point,Fri Mar 27 18:17:21 2015 UTC,"It feels like RoF got nerfed- but the alpha strike was it's special, and part of what made it so deadly against fighters. It could flush the pods against a entire group of attack bombers, wiping out a large number in the first salvo. Then when the RoF dropped because it was limited by how quickly it could manufacture the things, welllllll...didn't matter, since the attacking wing was already shredded.  I feel like the range got disproportionately cut as well, come to think of it."
homeworld,30hi93,Zoloir,1 point,Fri Mar 27 18:23:35 2015 UTC,"The alpha strike was a near-instant volley of missiles in reserve, what the other guy is talking about was where you'd have ~4 at a time firing until all reserves are spent, at which point it did a mixture of ~1-2 at a time firing off at the recharge rate. which is slower than 4 per shot."
homeworld,30hi93,kioni,1 point,Mon Mar 30 01:07:56 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm. I thought it reloaded fast enough to keep volleying four at a time- though even two every few seconds let it eat fighter wings alive. But my memory could be faulty, too"

homeworld,30hi93,kioni,1 point,Mon Mar 30 04:03:03 2015 UTC,"I guess the missile volley could have been a quick fix to replace that functionality but it didn't work. then it became low priority and the game was released with an ability full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. if you try to box select targets for the volley it just launches them all at the first target acquisition due to how missiles overkill. it would be better if they removed the ability and increased the rof if they don't want to restore that reserve functionality."

homeworld,30e37b,Verteros,11,Thu Mar 26 17:07:29 2015 UTC,"This by no means a comprehensive guide - just a few things of the top of me head!  Hiigarans  Pros   Much more functional carriers. (Can build all production modules, but are more expensive.) Slightly quicker access to hyperspace (you only need a research module to build a HS module) More Versatile frigate lineup (Torpedo frigate is a good counter to the deadly laser corvettes, and can be decent and hurting capital ships is large numbers ION CANNONS! :D (who doesn't like lasers?) The Hiigaran battlecruiser isn't as easily 'nerfed' by strike craft. Whilst it's ion cannons can be disabled, it can still use it's kinetic cannons.   Cons    Upgrade researches are for individual classes, not blanket upgrades like the Vagyr have. Whilst this is good early game (cheaper to upgrade your front-liners) it does mean you can't upgrade ships such as the Marine frigate (but the Vagyrs frigate speed/armor upgrade will transfer onto the infiltrator) Less diverse strike craft lineup. You can't really get anything that  compares to the Laser Corvette (anti capital) or Lance fighters (anti corvette), Hiigaran strike craft are just generally alot less versatile The Advanced Research module. This cheeky sucker takes 2000 something RU's to build, and you can't research tier 2 upgrades or fancy ships (such as the ion frigate and battlecruiser).   Vagyr  Pros    Filthy cheap carriers. Faster and cheaper to build than the hiigaran versions, they make great resource drop offs. They do have several downsides (i'll talk about in cons) Versatile strike craft. You everything from the legendary capital slaying laser corvettes to mobile strike craft. You even have the option to build lance fighters, which will even screw over the supposedly anti-fighter Hiigaran gunships. You can also get a mobile fire control tower, which is surprisingly effective (especially when paired with laser corvettes!) No advanced research module. You only need the module (fighter/corvette/capital ect) to research upgrades/ships of that class. HS Gates. Pretty handy for getting those laser corvettes where they need to be quickly. Blanket upgrades. Allows you to upgrade every ship of that class, but can be very expensive early game. Trinity Cannon - The insanely strong weapon of mass destruction sported by the Vagyrs battlecruiser. Can one shot frigates, and works as a sniper, as it's able to out-range Hiigaran battlecruisers. It can only be fired from the front of the ship though. The Vagyr destroyer (with it's heavy missile battery) it's vastly superior to the Hiigaran one. One Vagyr destroyer could easily emerge the victor vs 2 Hiigarans.   Cons   Carriers are cheap, but you get what you pay for! Inferior Armour (bombers could kill it fairly quickly!) and can only support one production module. Battlecruisers can be easily neutered. By disabling the missile battery and attacking from your rear or sides, your enemy can effectively render your cruiser defenseless (aside from the point defense weapons) Heavy missile frigates (the equivalent to the ion frigate) are not great. Their missiles are slow, but they are damaging. Use in numbers only.   Hope this is useful to you!"
homeworld,30e37b,Latiasracer,5,Thu Mar 26 19:11:39 2015 UTC,"That's really useful, thank you. I don't suppose you could cover the other two factions? You did so well with those two I'd appreciate it."
homeworld,30e37b,Latiasracer,5,Thu Mar 26 19:31:21 2015 UTC,"Sure!   There is alot less to consider with the classic races as they are pretty similar to each other.  Kushan   Pros   Drone frigates : These badboys will mess up strike craft. They are also capable of replenishing their drones, something they didn't do in the classics. Kushan destroyers are capable of rotating their ion cannons by about 90 degree's, gives them an edge against faster targets.   Cons   Cloaked fighters are crap, not really useful in the remasters. Whilst cool, the capital ships 'undocking' animation renders them combat ineffective for a short while whilst they are undocking. This can pose an issue if you are in a tight spot!   Taiidan  Pros   Defense fighters. These badboys are even more effective than they used to be, rendering torpedo & heavy missile frigates useless and severely reducing the damage destroyers / Vagyr battlecruiser can dish out. Capital Ships just pop out of the bottom, meaning they are ready for action just that little bit quicker. All of your ships look hella awesome!   Cons   Defense field frigates are nothing like they where in the classics, and are essentially useless. They now behave the same as the Hiigaran version, and are out of power after about 15 seconds.   Below is a list of pro/cons of the HW1 race over the HW2 ones. I have also edited my above post with some info i forgot!  Pros of classic races   Frigates an up have instant hyperspace ability. No modules or anything, They can jump whenever and wherever. Hyperspacing 2 assault frigates to likely resourcing areas is a popular early game tactic from what i've seen. Research is much quicker and cheaper. You can get to tech alot faster than the HW2 races. Remember to build aux hubs to increase your research speed though. Your production ships can build 2 ships at once. This means you can have your mothership pumping out strike craft, whilst at the same time slowly chugging along building a destroyer. Defenders. Whilst they are not for intercepting, when defending they are awesome. In numbers of around 30-40 can easily quell any strike craft the HW2 races can chuck at you. No shootable modules (apart from engines). This means your carriers are able to build anything anytime, and your heavy cruisers can't have their weapons damaged. Gravity Generators. Nothing quite like laying waste to your foes immobilized strike craft! Their hyperspace blocking effect is passive, much like the build-able modules on the HW2 ships.   Cons   No shipyards. Whilst this does mean you don't need a specific ship to build heavy cruisers, this does mean you are limited to your mothership. If it goes, no more capital ships for you! Fighters don't have squads. This is a big problem, and if you are facing a HW2 race i would not recommend bothering with fighters. The only strike craft that stand a chance are corvettes, and you should churn out heavy/multiguns at the earliest possible convenience! Your research ship cannot hyperspace. This leaves you in a pickle if you are forced to relocate your fleet, as you will have to leave  your defenseless research ship behind.  No upgrades. You can't increase the armour/speed of your ships which can leave you outmatched late game.   this is about all i can think of now! I'll add more if i remember more!"
homeworld,30e37b,Eventime,5,Thu Mar 26 20:03:59 2015 UTC,"There's one large advantage both the Kushan/Taiidan have right out of the gate. Instantly available hyperspace for Frigates and up, no research required.  I also did not know the hyperspace generators inhibitor field was passive. Knowledge!"

homeworld,30e37b,TheRealBramtyr,4,Thu Mar 26 20:25:00 2015 UTC,Drone frigates in classic HW1 most certainly replenished their drone swarm. Took a while (about 1 per 15 seconds if i recall correctly)
homeworld,30e37b,Latiasracer,2,Thu Mar 26 20:58:17 2015 UTC,"Ahh, i never used them as a kid as i thought they where useless. Lol.  Good to know!"
homeworld,30e37b,TheRealBramtyr,2,Thu Mar 26 22:08:23 2015 UTC,"I'd use them to escort carriers or controllers; they could at least force the first wave of strikecraft to attack defensively, and give time for backup to arrive."
homeworld,30e37b,HorrificAnalInjuries,1 point,Thu Mar 26 22:34:22 2015 UTC,"As I've pointed out in my earlier post, a drone frigate effectively carries around the firepower of 12 scouts when it has its full compliment, and NPCs love to pop drones before anything else.  This gives Drone frigates the double punch against NPCs  of being able to slaughter fighter swarms and keeping yours intact for longer as the NPCs focus on killing the drones.  Just remember to bring them in before you send the frigate through hyperspace, as the drones will slowly drift to the frigate's new position leaving it defenseless in the meantime."
homeworld,30e37b,marwynn,3,Fri Mar 27 03:17:10 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to add that not having any visible modules is a pretty big, if subtle, pro of the classic races. Unless they're rushing Frigates you can't really tell the composition of their force. I've tried to raid a few times and could encounter swarms of defenders from one Carrier or see even more swarms of bombers come out instead.  As the strike craft are produced individually they are faster with replenishment, especially when close to a production vessel.   The true ""con"" is that the Research Ship is easily targeted and destroyed. You only need to kill off the one with a healthbar and they all explode."
homeworld,30e37b,HorrificAnalInjuries,2,Thu Mar 26 20:42:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks kindly, mate. This gave me a good idea of who I would like to play in the future."
homeworld,30e37b,kioni,7,Thu Mar 26 20:19:43 2015 UTC,"the Kushan and Taiidan both are virtually equal except in the following respects:  Kushan get Cloaked Fighters and Drone Frigates.  The former is a fighter with the same mobility as an interceptor and same armor/firepower as a scout, but can cloak.  The latter is a vessel that spews out a sphere of guns that each is half as powerful as a scout, but there are 24 of them.  The frigate basically volley fires down anything and everything that isn't another frigate.  In classic, the frigate can keep its drones out forever, but in any remastered version it has to pull them in every so often.  The Taiidan get Defense Fighters and Field Defense Frigates.  The former is an engine with a magic bullet-shooting laserbeam that'll nullify anything that is a cannon bullet and isn't a Heavy Gun slug, which means even the Hiigaran battlecruiser could be rendered useless by a handful of these little bastards.  The Field Defense Frigates do the same thing, but in the form of an AoE field of doom that covers allies too.  In the remastered version, it is likely that the FDF needs to charge up and use rather than in classic where its a passive that needs either salvage corvettes, bombers, minelayers, or anything with an ion cannon to deal with.  Beyond those ships, the difference is the exact gun layouts on their respective ships, the firing arcs of each of those weapons, and their resource controllers.  The Taiidan one has two drop off points, while the Kushan only has a single drop off point.  Both can service 6 fighters and 2 corvettes in a single go."

Elson, whose illustrations often placed detailed, brightly liveried spacecraft against vividly coloured backgrounds, influenced an entire generation of science fiction illustrators and concept artists.  The look of the PC game Homeworld was heavily influenced by Elson's illustrations of the '70s and '80s, according to artists who worked on the title (he is listed in the Special Thanks section of the game's manual and has a character, Captain Elson, named after him). Elson was originally slated to create the game's box art, but at the last moment was pre-empted by the publisher's decision to use a 3D rendered scene.  Born in Ealing, west London, he died of a heart attack in Skegness while working on mural paintings for Butlins. Most of his original work is now owned by his sister.

The disappointment was months before- not in Launch Day.  It's a great game on it's own, don't get me wrong. But the experience is definitely not HW1-ish. NEEDS MOAR SWIRLING."
homeworld,30cggx,LuckyHRE,2,Fri Mar 27 12:04:02 2015 UTC,"I've also noticed Support Frigates have the same flat repair speed as corvettes/collectors.  This kinda makes them worthless, as they are slower, more expensive and often take longer to latch on."
homeworld,30cggx,Latiasracer,1 point,Thu Mar 26 13:03:44 2015 UTC,They're performing the roles of resourcers in the original HW2. Guess how they carried out their duties? The problem is the bigger models and lower speeds of their HW1 counterparts.
homeworld,30cggx,thatTigercat,2,Thu Mar 26 06:32:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah I've noticed this. Everything is SO. SLOW.  I almost lost my mothership on Galactic Core. One strike group (with a heavy cruiser!) was so far below my mothership he was outside sensor range. Meanwhile my cap ship group was 25km away chasing a carrier. Once my probe found the HC, the HC found my mothership, and all I had to defend myself were salvettes. Which the defenders and multigun vettes shredded pretty fast.  I sent my only fighter wing (attack bombers) to distract the defs and vetts long enough to build enough salvettes to capture the HC. But my mothership was at 1/4 health by the end of it.  All because it took ten goddamn minutes for my own HCs to return"
homeworld,30cggx,thatTigercat,1 point,Thu Mar 26 06:46:32 2015 UTC,"Well I was more referring specifically to the HW1 support frigs/corvettes and resource collectors. They get in their own way trying to latch on, because those models were originally designed with ranged functionality in mind"
homeworld,30cggx,StillRadioactive,2,Thu Mar 26 07:06:17 2015 UTC,Support frigates have a really hard time repairing Ion Array Frigates in particular.  They collide with the collector arrays and push the repair target all over the place until they finally hit the right angle and start repairing.
homeworld,30cggx,Why485,0,Thu Mar 26 07:27:36 2015 UTC,"What's there to discuss? The original ships were designed to use their magic resource and repair beams and now that they're stuck with the hard dock system from HW2, they don't work like they were supposed to."

What really pisses me off is instead of focusing at least a few people on Tribes, they left it to rot in a ditch.  Then made skins and decals in Smite to continue milking it from any fans left.  Before they stopped development, they increased the grind to unlock weapons unless you paid them, and made gameplay changes like putting hard caps on speed.  Speed.  The biggest thing that separated Tribes from other FPSs."

I'm looking forward to how the Bridge of Sighs plays out!"
homeworld,306e1g,j00lian,2,Tue Mar 24 21:15:21 2015 UTC,"I think I ran into the same glitch, it has to do with victory triggers. When I first did it, I first killed the station, then capped the carrier, then took out the defenders. But the game was poorly coded and doesn't recognize this as a victory. You have to achieve the conditions in a certain order. You can actually cap every frigate, destroyer, the HC, and the carrier. But, you have to wait until the captures are completed back at the mothership before you kill the station, or the game glitches and you don't win, because it doesn't count the first two victory conditions as completed, and the game cares (but doesn't inform you of this) that you complete them in a specific order.  The destruction of Nova Station needs to be the very last victory condition you meet.  You can either actually destroy the carrier and defenders, or capture them. However, 'capture' doesn't mean ""has salvage corvettes around it"", it means ""has been processed by the mother ship"". Basically if you want to capture them, and win the level, hold off killing the station until your targets cross the map and enter the mothership. Which will take a very long time. I went and got coffee!"

homeworld,300lmr,Gifted_SiRe,1 point,Tue Mar 24 13:09:00 2015 UTC,I think he means the original HW. The 'remastered' version is not it.

homeworld,300lmr,Game_Fleet,1 point,Wed Mar 25 00:26:42 2015 UTC,Such a high score and everyone I know is saying its buggy as hell.  I'm just patiently waiting for devs/mods to fix.

homeworld,2zzpui,Carroway_J,5,Mon Mar 23 08:01:47 2015 UTC,When I was like 14 I wrote a 12 page science fiction story and used homeworld screens as  the illustrations. The graveyard shots especially.
homeworld,2zzpui,Stealthy_Lehninger,3,Mon Mar 23 12:19:19 2015 UTC,It was always great in HW1 Classic how it would use screenshots you'd taken as the loading screens in MP/skirmish.
homeworld,2zzpui,johnnycuttooth,1 point,Mon Mar 23 08:15:14 2015 UTC,How do you disable the geometric pips (like diamonds for frigates) when taking screenies?
homeworld,2zzpui,miborovsky,2,Mon Mar 23 14:19:44 2015 UTC,"You press tab. It'll cycle through different modes, one of which removes all the pips. Then you use backspace to remove all hud elements."

homeworld,300bau,ApertureLabia,2,Mon Mar 23 13:16:30 2015 UTC,The best way to deal with that infuriating radiation is to push your fleet through immediately and eliminate the enemy. Then you can use two of those defensive bubbles at a time for each relic. Damn I didn't like that mission :P

homeworld,300h0l,aksoileau,3,Mon Mar 23 14:11:40 2015 UTC,"I wish there were some numbers on Defense field frigates, what they affect, how much it reduces damage and what you can do if you use one. I play MP. Occasionally, when i feel very safe, I would build them and try to make a BC survive more damage. They get ignored and rightfully so: sometimes i can see a shot just stop on the edge of the field, but the things that truly matter in combat, like ion beams and the trinity cannon just don't care. They are neither stopped nor mitigated. I fail to see a purpose behind the field frigates then, as there are much better options to deal with things that it can actually stop."
homeworld,300h0l,DeTeryd,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:33:30 2015 UTC,Too bad they can't defend against radiation any better. :(  RIP to the thousands of frigate and salvage crews.

homeworld,2zyqfb,Capnflintlock,3,Mon Mar 23 01:20:04 2015 UTC,"In HW1 Classic, yes.  Assigning repair corvettes or support frigates to repair a group will make them automatically repair any damage that any member of that group takes.  In HW1 Remastered, no.  The support frigates are stupid."
homeworld,2zyqfb,StillRadioactive,3,Mon Mar 23 01:28:13 2015 UTC,The support frigates are stupid.   Hopefully that gets fixed.  I would also like the support frigates to stop leading the charge into battle when assigned a formation.
homeworld,2zyqfb,ApertureLabia,3,Mon Mar 23 12:52:05 2015 UTC,This is the worst. My repair corvettes and frigates are always charging in full speed in any formation.

homeworld,2zxx0j,StillRadioactive,2,Sun Mar 22 21:15:43 2015 UTC,"how did you manage to salvage corvettes?  edit: weird, just tested it. apparently you can do it very easily in hw1r. in hw1c it's virtually impossible because the salvage corvette is so slow.  I even managed to salvage a fighter. there's definitely something bugged with salvage corvette movement. they seem to suddenly triple their speed when they approach from a certain angle.  edit2: holy crap I just tried to capture another fighter and my salvage corvette warped around the screen like a maniac. this is broke."
homeworld,2zxx0j,kioni,4,Sun Mar 22 21:33:03 2015 UTC,"It's mostly because the Turanic Raider pilots are... oh, what's the term I'm looking for?  Oh yeah, dumber than a wet sack of hammers."
homeworld,2zxx0j,FRR-Wriath,3,Sun Mar 22 22:00:40 2015 UTC,"Whoah whoah whoah, we prefer REALLY DRUNK."
homeworld,2zxx0j,dad4x,3,Sun Mar 22 22:39:20 2015 UTC,"You can capture fighters and corvettes in classic doing kamikaze salvage.   That is where you kamikaze the salvette at the target, and re-target to salvage just before impact.   You get a 3x speed boost with the kamikaze.  This is most easily done by ALT-clicking the target to make it the focus, so the mouse stays on the target.   Then K to close fast, and click to salvage at the right time.   Practice makes perfect.  It's possible to get 10+ missile corvettes in M2, which are grossly overpowered against strike craft because of range.   A ""Z"" volley from a group will wipe out swarms at very long range until you have many missile destroyers, and even then, handy backup, especially in Galactic Core.  HW1RM makes it easy to catch them, but they are about as worthless as the RM missile destroyer."
homeworld,2zxx0j,LuckyHRE,1 point,Mon Mar 23 00:32:23 2015 UTC,Why is the RM Missile Destroyer worthless?
homeworld,2zxx0j,Iam_TheHegemon,1 point,Fri Mar 27 12:11:47 2015 UTC,"Missiles are slower and don't maneuver like they once did. Also, I think the range got nerfed"
homeworld,2zxx0j,dad4x,1 point,Fri Mar 27 12:53:07 2015 UTC,"Why is the RM Missile Destroyer worthless?   In classic, a missile destroyer is the Queen against all strike craft, fighter and corvette.   In RM, they don't kill fighters for beans, and are marginal against corvettes.   You need to use something else to kill strike craft, which really changes tactics and fleet composition."
homeworld,2zxx0j,TheLightningL0rd,1 point,Mon Mar 30 17:54:30 2015 UTC,yeah i cap'd one of the missile corvettes from the second mission and thought it was pretty hilarious. definitely weird and possibly in need of addressing. i wish they would fix the slightly gimped AI in some missions of the remastered HW1 and tone down the scaling of enemies a bit as well.
homeworld,2zxx0j,pheylan-cavanaugh,1 point,Sun Mar 22 22:40:30 2015 UTC,"Wat did you do. I salvaged literally every single Corvette that was sent my way, and only had 5 assault frigates."
homeworld,2zxx0j,Kar98,2,Sun Mar 22 22:59:56 2015 UTC,"I farmed the carrier for corvettes, since it always replaces them immediately when they're captured.  I had 10 missile corvettes and 13 standards."
homeworld,2zxx0j,Zeebaars,1 point,Sun Mar 22 23:14:35 2015 UTC,Doesnt it get tedious trying to salvage all the ships? Ill salvage some but trying to get all seems overkill
homeworld,2zxx0j,climbandmaintain,1 point,Mon Mar 23 06:07:02 2015 UTC,"Did you have trouble saving at least 1 tray or were your trying to rescue all of them? I did the same, farmed the carrier for corvettes and went up against ten or so frigates. I didn't feel I was at risk of failing the mission, but I lost three trays."
homeworld,2zxx0j,wobbleside,1 point,Mon Mar 23 12:08:24 2015 UTC,"I had salvage corvettes en route to each tray at the very start of the cutscene, but I STILL only barely got one."
homeworld,2zw3x5,kioni,2,Sun Mar 22 09:49:41 2015 UTC,Agreed. There's a lot of unused space in the southwest section of the multiplayer setup screen. I'm sure it could be rearranged somehow to include map descriptions.
homeworld,2zw3x5,chordial,2,Sun Mar 22 12:31:43 2015 UTC,this should be stickied!
homeworld,2zw3x5,hellraiz0r,1 point,Mon Mar 23 13:30:34 2015 UTC,"Nice, this is good to have.  I wish there was a better preview in the game lobby though, with resource locations shown on the map."
homeworld,2zw3x5,RaZorwireSC2,3,Sun Mar 22 10:32:32 2015 UTC,There would be room in the preview picture for a side view for the more vertical maps as well.
homeworld,2zw3x5,chloroform_vacation,1 point,Sun Mar 22 11:01:01 2015 UTC,Nice! The only thing that's missing now is the info on how much resources does the map hold by default. On some maps you can mine out those few patches very fast...
homeworld,2zw3x5,chloroform_vacation,1 point,Sun Mar 22 15:04:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah I thought of that, but I think there are too many variables in each map that it would fall more under map strategy (low/medium/high wouldn't cut it). Like, ""your starting location mines out quickly so you want to move towards the center, where there is a lot of available resources.""  If people want to add some map tips here or elsewhere I'm sure others would appreciate it."
homeworld,2zx1sn,jasdlkf,2,Sun Mar 22 17:00:49 2015 UTC,I was having this problem in the asteroid mission in classic. I'd hit a specific asteroid and the game would ctd. I got around it by just moving by guys around and reloading a shitton.   No idea why that'd be happening at the final mission. I'll get there eventually.
homeworld,2zx1sn,KharakIsBurning,2,Sun Mar 22 19:58:32 2015 UTC,It's happening on a lot of missions in classic sadly.

homeworld,2zwbso,hellraiz0r,3,Sun Mar 22 12:16:21 2015 UTC,I like to request a game replay function (similiar to the one of supreme commander) where players are able to watch the battles they fought from any perspective. Sup.com forged alliance forever also comes with a Replay Vault were all local and community replays are gathered. What do you think? or is it even possible to watch replays now?
homeworld,2zwbso,kioni,1 point,Sun Mar 22 12:18:38 2015 UTC,"So, people don't understand that replays are a fairly large technical undertaking. It's not something you can just add to a game, it's a feature that is very intimately connected to the game's engine.  HW2 supposedly has some vestigial references to replay functionality, which would suggest that they started developing the game with that aspiration, but abandoned it for whatever reason. How salvageable that functionality is, only the developers would know.  Will replay functionality be patched into HW:R? Highly unlikely. They're already struggling a little to bug fix and push the multiplayer out of beta. Even a spectator mode, which is very easy to add, is a distant low priority goal. Adding such a large feature like replays is completely out of reach right now, and I twitch a little when people so casually suggest that it should be added. They'll be lucky to finish what they've already somewhat promised before the money dries up."
homeworld,2zwbso,Magitex,1 point,Sun Mar 22 13:53:50 2015 UTC,Too sad that such a feature wasn't forseen
homeworld,2zu4mv,HellsAttack,11,Sat Mar 21 20:10:46 2015 UTC,"I have been replaying cataclysm and literally just went through that mission earlier today.  It really hits you hard, the desperation of the Somtaaw forces, knowing that if they don't get help from the Bentusi they are as good as dead anyway.  Hearing your ships crews screaming as their hulls collapse. Then the speech to cap it all off.  I like the Bentusi response line to the Somtaaw saying they will ram their mothership down the throat of the first harbor ship to approach it "" That will not be necessary, we see our own madness reflected in your own""  Look at how terrifying it must be for the Bentusi as well, they are immortal and they are part of their ships.  They stay alive encased in a tomb of beast tissue as they are forced to watch their bodies(ships) cause mass murder."
homeworld,2zu4mv,RDBRULZ,3,Sat Mar 21 21:47:56 2015 UTC,"Say, what operating system are you on, and how did you get it to work? I can't get past Mission 2, it crashes right after the cutscene. Being unable to play Cataclysm is honestly disappointing for me, it's considered by many the best game of the series and I feel left out."
homeworld,2zu4mv,RDBRULZ,3,Sat Mar 21 23:09:58 2015 UTC,Windows 7 64 bit  There is a guide on how to get it running but I believe it comes down to patching it to the latest and running in compatibility mode.  There are also some launch commands you can give it to smooth things out like the flickering menus.  Guide on how to get it working:  http://www.thegameengine.org/homeworld-cataclysm/homeworld-cataclysm-on-windows-7/  Startup commands:  http://www.thegameengine.org/homeworld-cataclysm/homeworld-cataclysm-custom-options/  Getting it working on widescreen resolutions if that is what you use:  http://www.rpgcodex.net/forums/index.php?threads/get-original-homeworld-running-on-a-widescreen-resolution.36682/  That should help.  One thing to note with the widescreen resolutions is that giving move orders in three dimensions are a little bugged.  It is still usable but a little odd.
homeworld,2zu4mv,kal_zakath,1 point,Sun Mar 22 00:22:11 2015 UTC,"Well, it runs, it just crashes after the mission 2 intro cutscene. The compatibility option for NT is not available on Windows 8 and above, too."

If it is cracked,  did you download the correct version to replace the 1.01 patched exe?   Here are my steps for getting it working :    Mount cd or put in game disc.  Install and put in cd key (I actually still remember my original one)   Download the 1.01 patch,  this may not install on a modern system,  you may need to edit the startup parameters to allow it to extract and then manually copy the patched files over to the game directory.   Download a cd cracked exe and replace the one in the game folder or put in original game disc.  Try to run it now and see if it works,  if not run in compatibility mode.   Edit the resolution in the registry and change startup parameters to suit your needs.   Enjoy!"

Cataclysm was a GREAT game with a GREAT story! It's too bad people don't give it the time of day because it was made by Naughty Dog and dared to focus on a small Kiith.  Long live Kiith Somtaaw!

homeworld,2zu4mv,nix413,1 point,Wed Mar 25 04:00:20 2015 UTC,This was one of the most memorable missions in the HW series. The voice actors absolutely nailed it.
homeworld,2zu4mv,achensherd,6,Mon Mar 23 04:08:23 2015 UTC,"I'm glad someone in the media finally brought it up. The completely nonchalant way most RTS's just insist on you sending hoards of troops to die by making that the most effective strategy has really turned me off to RTS's in general. That's what I loved about HW1. On the final mission, I still had 3 of the 5 scouts I'd started the game with. They were brothers, friends. I knew them. I could have ordered them to kamikaze into the final boss, but that would have been asking for the death of my friends.  That's why I HATED HW2 when it first came out. The mission with the dog was the last straw. I was again sending hoards to die, over and over, treating life as meaningless. HW had lost one of the things about it that I'd really loved and that broke me from it."
homeworld,2zu4mv,nix413,3,Sun Mar 22 09:52:53 2015 UTC,"I don't know, man. Continuously flooding the map with GPU-overheating quantities of Zerglings (all covered under the Zergling Reconstitution/warranty-replacement plan) in SC2:HotS until the objective is completed is a perfectly viable strategy, and I don't feel bad about it. :P  Yeah, I was pretty attached to my ships in HW1 and HWC. In HW1, it was because of the story making the crew of the Mothership and its fleet the last of the Kushan/Hiigaran race, and I wanted to make damn sure that every ship and the life or lives within mattered. I also had stories for how I ""acquired"" much of my fleet, especially towards the end, so by the end nearly every surviving ship had a history of sorts. In HWC, it was because of the story making the crew of the Kuun-Lan (both sections) and its fleet members of a relatively small kiith, so every ship was literally family. Additionally, the supply limit meant that the fleet could only be so big, so after x number of missions with for the most part the same, small number of ships, it was very easy to become attached to nearly every last one.  In HW2, it's... different. All the lives still matter, but there's something very logistical or cold about everything. Something about the way losses are treated in the story (not with much regard), how fragile many of the ships are, and how everything is happening in the midst of an interstellar war between established empires somehow makes losses feel like they don't matter quite as much."
homeworld,2zu4mv,aksoileau,2,Sun Mar 22 20:10:07 2015 UTC,"And that's what my thinking was: The Hiigarans have established themselves now, so a few lives lost don't matter. But should we be ok with that? Should we be ok throwing the lives of our men away? Maybe I'm just not a very good commander who can look at the bigger picture."

This sector of space plays a pivotal role in both the Homeworld War and also the Vaygr War. Besides the Hiigarans most other races keep clear of this sector, both because of its automated guardians known as the Keepers, and also Pirate fleets which linger in the area, preying on unknowing vessels which venture into the area.

But it could have used more testing before release it definitely has a beta feel to it sometimes. Although with a couple updates I think it'll be just fine so I happily forgive them for it.  Although I really wish they hadn't tried to balance HW1 with HW2 I think it's a cool idea for multilayer, but hurt the game over all since single player is such a big part of the series."

homeworld,2zsido,Delsana,1 point,Sun Mar 22 16:40:12 2015 UTC,"I never found any bugs in HW1 aor HW 2 on release actually. But when you ADD bugs when all you're doing is changing assets, you know you need to test better."

I had some 60,000 posts on Relicnews/Relic forums helping people find fixes for bugs and curated the MTL for HW, HW2 and the DoW and CoH series.  The build bug was never fixed in HW1.  There were some 50 bugs reported by Relic (and a similar but slightly different list found by Sierra QA) for the 1.1 patch document.  HW1 Remastered was not changing assets obviously as they rebuilt HW1 in the HW2R engine, but HW2 Remastered should be about the same as HW2 1.1 patch bug wise.  Some things DID get fixed in HW2 Remastered that were a cause of a lot of reports in HW2... such as the ""Background banding"" that was frequently reported."

I just went back and tried to play a game the other day and I was horrid across the board with that game. But my HW2 is decent.  With fighter battle micro it is really about watching the enemies fighters and which of yours can sweep in behind for the easy kills. Along with docking out (and covering) injured groups. If the enemy isn't also microing you can just dock the ones being attacked and have the rest swoop in behind as they give chase. (Dare I say making it a piece of cake?) Fighter speed upgrades are important for docking out and saving squads too!   PROTIP: If you see scouts hanging out with enemy fighters don't clump up and beware the EMP!"

homeworld,2zmsku,LuckyHRE,8,Thu Mar 19 22:02:47 2015 UTC,Burleson forgot to include a section. Moar fixes:   Fixed getting stuck trying to skip NISs during fade to black Turned off auto update for lobby screen. (Need to click refresh to get an updated list). Dust clouds updated with new improved graphics in HW1 Mission 10. Should be easier to understand safe areas. Kushan mothership badge fixed. Kushan mothership bridge glows are properly glowing.

homeworld,2zmsku,forthelose,6,Fri Mar 20 12:33:20 2015 UTC,woop! I asked for the UI scaling in a request to them and they did it :D

homeworld,2zmsku,METROID4,17,Fri Mar 20 15:17:34 2015 UTC,"The slider for the UI scale is a nice addition, however, the ship selection box (bottom-left frame) is still way too small. If you scale up the UI to where the ship icon sizes in the selection have proper size, everything gets way too big.  It would be nice to be able to resize the selection frame (and that frame only, not the formations/tactics icons) like you now can with the Build/Research/Launch frame.  Also, the new update .big files seem unable to be opened by existing tools at the moment (although I haven't checked them all).  Edit:  I've just read that this patch was already locked down, but the individual HUD element resizing will be part of the next update! Burleson said it in the forums."

homeworld,2zmsku,METROID4,1 point,Fri Mar 20 02:08:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah they mentioned that this patch would break quite some UI mods.  The Re-Interfaced mod was indeed awesome, I referred on my mods to that mod because it was simply all combined, extended and better overall.  Although GBX's patch is a nice step towards a better UI, I'm really curious about what other improvements they've made for the UI which couldn't yet be included.  Also, I'm really interested in the mod they'll release which will balance MP and stuff, without potentially breaking games for all players (it's a mod after all, you can simply subscribe/unsubscribe from it). In that I think they could experiment with some other features/improvements, like for the UI, as well."
homeworld,2zmsku,Formulka,1 point,Fri Mar 20 15:13:34 2015 UTC,"I would still like the cleaner UI from HW2 without the unnecessary lines and weirdness that just clutters it.

It's a big part of the problem with too small icons of the ships, if it was cleaner it wouldn't be an issue but with all the mess around it's hard to see the outline and identify them. Even the research and build menus would benefit from it."

homeworld,2znbf6,chordial,12,Fri Mar 20 00:28:18 2015 UTC,"Why not separate some of the game elements in the multiplayer and the singleplayer? Like in StarCraft 2 they have to constantly balance the units for the multiplayer scene but keep them the same in singleplayer, sometimes wildly overpowered if considered in the multiplayer scheme of things but just fine in the singleplayer campaign as the players tends to face far greater numbers of enemies and challenges unheard of in the multiplayer for example. They could in the same way keep the original HW1 experience intact while altering the units and their behaviour just in the combined multiplayer and making the two games more balanced just there (and in skirmish)."
homeworld,2znbf6,Formulka,3,Fri Mar 20 01:24:32 2015 UTC,"I asked a dev directly and the main issue is technical: while the stats are already separated between SP and MP, the inner mechanics of ships (how they move, organize, whatever) are not, so in the long run it's gonna be more buggy.  http://forums.gearboxsoftware.com/t/future-mp-beta-patches/137564/23?u=luckyhre"
homeworld,2znbf6,LuckyHRE,3,Fri Mar 20 09:49:22 2015 UTC,"I was going to point this out. Sounds like the gameplay balance they're focusing on will probably be centered around, eg, ship formations (which everyone will want in SP anyway) so they're going to need to update for both."
homeworld,2znbf6,kspacey,2,Sat Mar 21 17:26:05 2015 UTC,Ship formations alone would be the biggest improvement.
homeworld,2znbf6,pheylan-cavanaugh,2,Sat Mar 21 23:59:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not sure.  Maybe it didn't matter when the classic versions were released because there was only one campaign per product.  Now we have two campaigns whose balances intersect in MP,  which itself must remain balanced.  I do not envy the devs who will be tackling this."
homeworld,2znbf6,RaZorwireSC2,3,Fri Mar 20 01:38:29 2015 UTC,"Based on what the Devs have been saying tonight, the issue isn't that the numbers would impact SIngleplayer. Those apparently are already split out and separate. What the issue is if they change behavior (formations, unit AI, that sort of thing) those are shared between SP and MP. Personally I don't see the big deal, but it does mean they need to be more careful and understand the consequences of those changes on the SP experience as well."
homeworld,2znbf6,METROID4,1 point,Fri Mar 20 07:20:52 2015 UTC,"Why not separate some of the game elements in the multiplayer and the singleplayer?   Honestly, I'd actually prefer if the MP updates affected the campaign as well. I love the response from Gearbox so far, and I understand that they are concerned with unintended side-effects, but the balance in the HW1 campaign is also pretty lop-sided at the moment.   In general though, I'm really happy they are looking into the possibility of making HW1 formations a thing. That alone would help out balance by making HW1 fighters more viable."
homeworld,2znbf6,LuckyHRE,1 point,Fri Mar 20 10:55:36 2015 UTC,"Well duplicating all ships for SP would not be possible/feasible (that would be another few GB's of files), but what could be possible is to duplicate all the script (text based) files.  So every single ship would have a default version (like now) and a _SP version (this is for my example, you could also turn it around and use default for SP and have _MP files for Skirmish/MP, or you could do both and an _SP variant would be for campaign, and an _MP variant would be for Skirmish/MP, in this example I use default for MP and _SP for campaign), so you'd have  Hgn_AssaultCorvette with its Hgn_AssaultCorvette.ship etc., and a  Hgn_AssaultCorvette_SP with its Hgn_AssaultCorvette_SP.ship etc., except that they share the same Hgn_AssaultCorvette.hod (where possible, you can load the .hod file of another ship not necessarily specified in the same folder by using LoadSharedModel instead of LoadModel, referencing to the ship you want to load, so Hgn_AssaultCorvette_SP would load the model of Hgn_AssaultCorvette).  In the .ship files are most of the references to manoeuvres, attack styles, stats etc., which could thus be separated. Things like how they attack are referred to as script files, so the Hgn_AssaultCorvette (Hiigaran Gunship) has the default attack style of FlyRound_Corvette_vs_Frigate (and some extra exceptions specified for against some other ships), which is a script, in \scripts\attack\flyround_corvette_vs_frigate.lua  Now you could duplicate that as well, so if you use another kind of attack in SP, you'd just reference a flyround_corvette_vs_frigate_SP.lua (and create that as well), which is based on the already existing one (copy-paste) but some changes.  It might sound a lot of work to change ALL ships, but if the SP (campaign content) is just working fine, you can duplicate them like that and use from then on all the _SP stuff for campaign (so the race in campaign would be either the same races but using the _SP builds, but that would be more difficult as the separation of the two builds would be in the same build and research.lua, maybe better would be to have a Hiigaran_SP race etc., you can't choose a race in campaign anyway so you wouldn't notice it), if you need to make slight changes to SP later on, you'd just change one of these _SP files, and further development of the Skirmish and MP (Skirmish and MP is basically the same) would be continued on the other set of files.  In my opinion, this would allow for a clear separation if necessary, doesn't need to be applied everywhere (like if the Vgr_Destroyer is unchanged, then both campaign and Skirmish/MP would use the same file), and wouldn't increase game size by a lot (e.g. all Attack scripts combined are ~100-200 KB)."
homeworld,2znbf6,ckoerner,6,Fri Mar 20 14:42:28 2015 UTC,"Summary:   At this point, most large bugs should be squashed. Next patch will focus on balance.

homeworld,2zky9i,Yornn,3,Thu Mar 19 15:29:01 2015 UTC,Yeah.. I just drew the frigates off to the edge of the map and capped the HC and a few Destroyers.  I didn't want to go for the ion frigates since I had over 100 frigates already... thanks to the Ghost Ship autobalance.
homeworld,2zky9i,wobbleside,3,Thu Mar 19 17:31:03 2015 UTC,On remaster unless it's been patched all you have to do is introduce a target to the ship you want to capture. The AI main mission is to then destroy that target. Move the target out of range and the cap ship will pursue without worrying about new targets as long the new targets don't fire guns at the cap ship. Good thing salvage vetts don't have guns.

homeworld,2zlfym,Technojerk36,2,Thu Mar 19 16:09:41 2015 UTC,"There are several things.  First of all the mod needs to be in .big format, as loose files (-overbigfile) disables Steam as there is no actual file check which will lead to games outright breaking.  Second, the mod panel in the launcher, which reads any mods you subbed to on the workshop, currently does not parse the command line arguments. It also launches the games in their respective offline modes. You can get around this however, as any command lines you add directly to the game's shortcut in Steam (right click -> properties -> launch options) are passed to the launcher.  Using that method, simply adding -mpbeta and the mod launcher will force the game to load the mod you want into a Steam-enabled multiplayer mode.  Alternatively you can just create a shortcut of the regular .exe and use a combination of old command lines (-mod bigfilename.big, etc) with the addition of -mpbeta."

The bombers actually work against capital ships as they can disable subsystems (and the elite ones are a-beast-must-keep-restart-a-mission-when-lost), the pulsar gunships shred through frigates and corvettes and even frigates are useful especially in some of the missions in the campaign.

HW1R heavy cruisers are a few times more powerful than their classic version in order to compete with the HW2 battlecruiser counterpart in multiplayer.  No because, well, bigger is still better in HW1 classic as well. I just played through HW1R and then HW1classic and while classic felt a little better mechanically, in both I stopped building strikecraft in the later half of the campaign because they died too fast and were a big RU sink.  Anyway, like many other RTS games, the HW campaigns are very strategically light. That's why everyone flocks to the multiplayer to actually indulge in the strategic systems."

There are speedruns of people beating the game using almost nothing but Scouts. Strike Craft can remain useful throughout the entire game if you know how to control them and frigates can be the backbone of your fleet since they are nowhere near as weak vs super-capital ships as in the Remaster. There was a bug in the original version of HW1 where your super-capital ships sometimes wouldn't launch from the Mothership after construction, so I know of at least one player who got through the entire game with a fleet that consisted of almost only frigates."
homeworld,2zkalx,RaZorwireSC2,3,Thu Mar 19 12:21:21 2015 UTC,"The scout thing was a bug that got fixed in patch 1.05, almost exactly 15 years ago.  I know you can use strikecraft intelligently and I'm not surprised that the game could be beaten with frigates (I think I only built one destroyer in my run anyway, salvaged the rest). It's just that there's not much point unless you want to handicap yourself. You have to be very attentive for little gains compared to smashing through with capital ships. Despite what is possible, the bigger is better motto is apparent in all the variations of Homeworld. HW2/HW1:R took that motto a bit further of course, but if one's only experience with the games were forum comments one would believe that HW1 had a perfect strategic wheel that got completely butchered."

The guy kills the Taiidan Flag Ships with only Scouts.    that HW1 had a perfect strategic wheel that got completely butchered.   It wasn't by any means perfect, but it WAS butchered.  My point isn't that using Strike Craft is necessarily the best strategy, but that by controlling them correctly with the right formations and tactics, you CAN get a ton of use out of them. In the Remaster the ships are what they are, and since formations and tactics aren't working properly there is very little you can do to make them more efficient. Combined with the overall stats buff to heavier ships, it's not even a strategic wheel anymore as much as a ladder.  It's evident in Multiplayer as well, where Defenders seem the only useful fighter the HW1 races have (they are on the other hand really fucking good) since Scouts and Interceptors break formation and go into a flight pattern where they only manage to fire occasionally. They take forever to kill anything."

While the devs (and the company) are absolutely awesome (I bought the game because I like supporting good dev orgs), they're missing an SDK dev.  Along with the team developing the game itself, there should have been someone in sync with them developing an open framework for modding and providing samples.  That person should have also had access to someone who could write the documentation.  Um...  I guess I'm coming from the perspective of a project that had a $10mm budget.  We could hire two full time people to work just on the SDK.    With that in mind (I'm guessing they barely had the budget to pay for the art), what the devs here are doing is commendable.  And I'm glad the community supports them (and they support the community).  That's a pretty awesome synergy for a small studio.  [edit]  It's the same company that owns Borderlands - that explains a lot of the community involvement and the dedication to just continually improving on a released game.    They also kind of have the Duke Nukem license.  But there's some legal shenanigans going on there.

The team also probably didn't want to have to manage upgrading and supporting two separate engines. That may sound great to fans but it's a nightmare for programmers that would cost a lot of time and money in the future.   In the end the Remaster was still done on a sensible budget. The team may absolutely love Homeworld but they don't want to be taking a massive hit on their margins to achieve it. They decided to best get the game out to a playable state to just port Homeworld to Homeworld 2 and work on getting each mission running and a ""good enough"" gameplay balance for the release.

homeworld,2zh63m,PanopticonMatt,7,Wed Mar 18 15:38:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah they're useless.  I only build one when required in singleplayer.  Not only are they slower than salvage corvettes, but they take up a frigate slot which means a lot of lost firepower in a fleet of frigates because you're going to need to build more than one if you want to successfully capture anything."
homeworld,2zh63m,chuiu,3,Wed Mar 18 18:03:00 2015 UTC,I hadn't considered that - thanks for the heads-up. (((Gives the command to Retire...)))

homeworld,2zh63m,Spartan_094,3,Wed Mar 18 15:45:04 2015 UTC,They were the only reason i managed to survive the mission where you protect the shipyard. I was able to use them to incapacitate each infiltrator frigate
homeworld,2zh63m,achensherd,8,Wed Mar 18 16:03:09 2015 UTC,"I don't have a comprehensive grasp of how all of the triggers on that mission work, but after half a dozen playthroughs I've noticed that letting the Vaygr take over the shipyard and then taking it back is waaaaaaaay easier than perpetually defending it and having to kill seemingly endless waves of infiltrator frigates and having to disable/destroy the three carriers. If you let them take the shipyard and then take it back, the Vaygr basically give up -- they stop sending reinforcements, and the carriers cease to matter (they're still there when the Bentus jumps in). This saves me a LOT of fighters, bombers, and corvettes."
homeworld,2zh63m,dad4x,4,Wed Mar 18 18:57:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I noticed that too, but I felt bad for all the workers on the shipyard, so I kept defending it anyway.   Never tried the 'capture the infiltrators' approach, which might also work well, and be self-funding."
homeworld,2zh63m,mercurial_minnow,1 point,Wed Mar 18 19:42:08 2015 UTC,I did capture the infiltrators and its works reasonably well. I also tried to nab other random frigates with mixed results. You can also send the capture frigates to hit the carriers and disable them. Since you don't have a lot of firepower that early it meant I didn't have to deal with three carriers constantly popping out support.
homeworld,2zh63m,aksoileau,2,Thu Mar 19 07:48:47 2015 UTC,"After forgetting how hard that mission was defending the capture, I realized you need to leave all your pulsars defending the shipyard and then rush one of the carriers with your interceptors and bombers. Once one goes down it makes it so much easier."
homeworld,2zh63m,Delsana,1 point,Wed Mar 18 20:04:20 2015 UTC,But you're basically annilihating the entirety of the crew then..
homeworld,2zh63m,achensherd,1 point,Sun Mar 22 03:21:11 2015 UTC,"I've tried. I'm sure a better player can kill all the Vaygr before they can take the shipyard, but for me with the triggers as they are now, it's the crew of the shipyard and a cakewalk or basically all of my strike craft and frigates and losing the shipyard anyway."
homeworld,2zh63m,Delsana,1 point,Sun Mar 22 04:59:27 2015 UTC,"What exactly is your problem? It seems the same as the original HW2. Plus, doesn't it build you a destroyer?"
homeworld,2zh63m,achensherd,1 point,Sun Mar 22 05:01:20 2015 UTC,"It builds a carrier. I was able to pull it off in the original back in the day (younger reflexes, maybe), but even then not without significant losses. What usually happens is I lose most or all of my ships if I try to fight off the Infiltrators and disable/destroy the carriers, and even when I succeed the losses are so high that it's not ""worth it""."
homeworld,2zh63m,Delsana,1 point,Sun Mar 22 05:21:22 2015 UTC,Let me.see... You have gunships and pulsars.. I think that and flak frigates and torpedo frigates were the main answer.  The carrier just needs to repair those. I don't think I ever really had trouble with that one.. maybe you can make a video and show me what's happening for you?
homeworld,2zh63m,achensherd,1 point,Sun Mar 22 05:40:16 2015 UTC,"I think my main problem is lack of speed and control, especially once combat begins and things get crazy. I'll make a video when I go back to replay that mission."

homeworld,2zh63m,Rogue100,1 point,Wed Mar 18 19:43:15 2015 UTC,"I don't bother with them, except for the one or two times when the mission specifically requires it. You get enough resources in the campaign to get to and stay at the unit cap without needing to capture. They may be useful early on if you can score a destroyer a mission or two earlier than you can build it, but otherwise, not worth the spots they fill up in your unit cap."
homeworld,2zh63m,sumelar,1 point,Wed Mar 18 18:29:31 2015 UTC,"I never used them. You might need them on mission 3 to take back the shipyard if you're not killing the enemy frigates fast enough, but never again after that."
homeworld,2zh63m,zyxophoj,1 point,Wed Mar 18 19:35:22 2015 UTC,"I rarely bother with them.  I know some of the things we did with salvage corvettes in HW1 were complete bullshit, but I think they nerfed capturing a little bit too hard.  The problems in HW2 are that you can't overflow the unit cap with captured ships, and also that captured ships don't benefit from your own upgrades.  (Also, big ships leave resources when they die so just blowing them up is more convenient than capture-and-retire.)  Oh, and you can't capture Makaan's dreadnought. :(  There are some exceptions, like the first Vagyr destroyer - yeah, I'll grab that when it appears.  Also, there's one Vaygr BC which has a hyperspace module installed - grabbing that opens up some interesting possibilities."
homeworld,2zh63m,Kiita-Ninetails,1 point,Wed Mar 18 20:32:28 2015 UTC,"Actually, I managed to capture it once. But you can only have one Dreadnought per fleet. So if yours is still alive you cant take his."

homeworld,2zh63m,sockmess,1 point,Fri Mar 20 08:02:57 2015 UTC,"Given how in HW2 the enemy AI seems more aware of the vee real danger of takeover, combined with the aforementioned hard limit cap, I ask: are Marine Frigates worth the trouble in the HW2 single player campaign?

It is just about using them at the right time. Say they went fighter/dessie rush. You've seen the heavy fighters and gone corvettes to hold him off and pushed frigates for flak. They pop a destroyer out thinking haha got your flak, and then bam, warp in 2 marine frigates over that dessie and its gg.

I had also set my support frigates to repair all my capital ships, and the destroyer the Dog had grabbed was damaged, so they chased it down and tried to repair it. Which requires docking. Due to docking mechanics, the Dog and my frigates fought over docking rights for long enough that I finally thought of the gravwell generator and the rest of my fleet was able to chew through the Dog's armor.

We already know the Bentusi have knowledge of the Progenitors from them fixing the dreadnought's cannon which is uncannily similar to the ions used by Bentusi Exchanges.  I mean spin it another way- Imagine if they remastered Cataclysm and instead of shooting the portal emitters it was a progenitor gate?

Background says they demilitarized their ships after the Hiigarans were exiled.  For the Progenitor part, we know they left artifacts and ships. Maybe the Bentusi did not find the first Core by accident and they planned it, so the Bentusi could act as their agents once they'd be gone.  They have to most extensive knowledge of all known factions of the Homeworld Universe, but it's not explicit about how they achievde it (except being the first Hyperspace capable race and travelling a lot).

As far as why one would even want to, well, you know how it goes...  Me: ""I wonder if...""  (saves game, starts shooting)  Bentusi: ""WTF bro?""  Me: ""Tee-hee.""  Bentusi: ""Well, if you insist.""

homeworld,2z8iip,Hongxiquan,4,Mon Mar 16 14:46:31 2015 UTC,"Against the AI I think the best strategy is to shield your smaller ships with your bigger ones.  Destroyers and heavy cruisers cost more but since they have many more hit points they can more efficiently be repaired by support frigates than an entire frigate line.  If you're going with a heavy salvaging strategy I would get 2-3 gravity well generators to stop and corvette or strike craft class ships, send salvage corvettes in after cruisers, destroyers, or frigates (in that order) and use capital ships to mob up any frigates left and assault frigates to mob up disabled strike craft.  Ideally you would to destroy strike craft and corvettes without engaging anything else so you can make multiple passes with salvage corvettes."
homeworld,2z8iip,tetracycloide,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:53:08 2015 UTC,"Follow up question on that note. How do you protect your ships from being utterly decimated by the enemy capital ships while you wait for salvage vettes to get into place? I'm on mission 14 or 15 and I've  started trying to salvage, but I lose half my ships while I wait for vettes to come collect the one heavy cruiser."
homeworld,2z8iip,Achilles-SG,1 point,Tue Mar 17 02:28:57 2015 UTC,It depends on the level but generally the strategy is to keep everything out of range of their heavy cruiser while you try to pull smaller ships away from it and then send in salvage corvettes alone all at once.
homeworld,2z8iip,tetracycloide,1 point,Tue Mar 17 02:32:19 2015 UTC,do you typically send in a lot more vettes than necessary so you still have enough by the time you get there? Or do you send in small ships as a distraction?
homeworld,2z8iip,Achilles-SG,2,Tue Mar 17 02:43:51 2015 UTC,Against frigates in reasonable numbers I'll try to distract with larger ships set to passive.  Against destroyers and cruisers I usually just send in all the salvage corvettes at once and see what sticks.  Sometimes it takes more than one try.  I've also tried using scouts as distractions with some success.  One thing that's important to keep in mind when salvaging is the AI will treat a salvage ship differently if it is on move command vs. on an intercept course.  So it's almost always better to move near something and then latch rather than issue the latch command as soon as the target ship is in view.

The base texture is definitely drawing (see the bow markings) and the overlays for the player color are just color swatches, not textures.

homeworld,2z6vjy,BiznessCasual,6,Mon Mar 16 21:31:43 2015 UTC,"Defenders are most certainly not broken; they're absolute anti-fighter beasts.  That said, 12 isn't enough to take massive swarms of fighters/corvettes.  You need to have a good number of them to be effective, but once you get that number, you're pretty much immune to strike craft.  Try the mission with 25 defenders; I'll think that will change your opinion of them."
homeworld,2z6vjy,BiznessCasual,2,Mon Mar 16 04:33:35 2015 UTC,"My experience with Defenders in Multiplayer is that they are absurdly good, bordering on unbalanced; but that is taking into account their cost/production time in a situation where you recieve a constant stream of income.

homeworld,2z6vjy,RaZorwireSC2,3,Mon Mar 16 09:48:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've GG'd against a Defender ""rush"" on smaller maps.   By the time I'm creating a Vaygr fighter force and just rolling out a new carrier for Frigates or Corvettes, I see the wall of Defenders pouring out of a carrier. Even harassing early on does nothing unless I'm willing to sacrifice a lot of fighters."
homeworld,2z6vjy,marwynn,3,Mon Mar 16 13:33:01 2015 UTC,"You're doing something wrong, then.  By the time the first defender comes out, you should have like 3-4 assault craft squads and a a squad or two of missile corvs.  Don't tech so much against HW1 races. They have a long period where they can't build anything at all except scouts while you can build lots of fighters (or bombers)."
homeworld,2z6vjy,innociv,2,Mon Mar 16 14:32:06 2015 UTC,"By the time the first defender comes out, you should have like 3-4 assault craft squads and a a squad or two of missile corvs.   Still difficult, in my experience. I played Hiigaran vs Kushan yesterday, and after getting my resourcing going, I started building almost nothing but Interceptors. All the Kushan had to do was to keep all his constructed stuff docked until he could launch 10-15 Defenders at once. They chewed through my Interceptor squads really quickly, and his resource collectors were so tanky that I didn't have time to do serious damage to his mining before all my stuff started dying.  And this was AFTER he'd lost 20+ Interceptors to a failed rush that did virtually no damage.  Gunships are decent vs Defenders, but by the time I had those on the way he already had enough of them to push my Carrier away from a forward resource patch, and after that, I was more or less dead.  I mean, the game is young and none of us are very experienced yet (least of all me), but as far as I can tell from what I've played so far, it seems really difficult to counter Defenders with just fighters."
homeworld,2z6vjy,RaZorwireSC2,3,Mon Mar 16 15:00:17 2015 UTC,"as far as I can tell from what I've played so far, it seems really difficult to counter Defenders with just fighters.   Well, defenders are a hard counter to fighters, and one of the hardest fighter counters in the game once they are brought in en masse.  They fall off in effectiveness in mid and late-game though, as they're not good against frigs and caps.  They're also slow as balls, so you should be able to see them coming with proper scouting and get out counters in time."
homeworld,2z6vjy,BiznessCasual,2,Mon Mar 16 18:07:00 2015 UTC,"Well, defenders are a hard counter to fighters, and one of the hardest fighter counters in the game once they are brought in en masse.   Yeah, my comment about them being hard to counter was a response to the post above that said not to tech too much against them.   I guess it's true that they aren't very good against frigates and super-capital ships, but even those are really slow at killing defenders. Flak frigates seem to be doing pretty poorly since they are designed to kill large groups of enemies rather than individual ships and torpedo frigates just fire so damn slow. I guess if you start pumping out proper counters early you might have enough of them though. I've had the most luck with Gunships so far, but I don't have experience beyond a handful of games so it might be too early to tell."
homeworld,2z6vjy,RaZorwireSC2,2,Mon Mar 16 18:26:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I think the best way to counter them as a HW2 race is to just ""avoid"" them. I main Kushan, and I use them in purely a defensive capacity when expanding my resource gathering operation. At that point in the game, if an opposing player tries to fighter harass, my defenders will rip them apart, assuming I have enough of them to be effective. Instead of attacking that, work on trying to secure mid resources if the map has it, or get your own resource operation expanded and tech up to bigger stuff. If a player were to ""rush"" you with defenders, I'd move your collectors to safety and counter - attack with your fighter squadrons, since odds are the player using defenders has gone ""all - in"" with defenders in order to get that critical mass to destroy all of your strike craft. Just try to survive that phase of the game while building the foundation for mid/late - game; at that point, defenders become pretty irrelevant because they can't damage caps.   TL, DR: in order to counter defenders with fighters, put your fighters where the defenders are not."
homeworld,2z6vjy,BiznessCasual,2,Mon Mar 16 19:30:17 2015 UTC,"Thanks, but I have a question; what's stopping the HW1 player from just slowly pushing out to resource patches in the middle of the map with a carrier and most of his defenders? I've seen that happen on a couple of occasions, and if you fall back and allow him to take the center, you are pretty much just conceding the economic advantage right away on some maps.  And I get the idea of counter-attacking elsewhere, but I'm not sure what to aim for. Everything the HW1 races have in resource collection is so tanky that it takes a lot of time to kill. If they push the front with Defenders and you attack their first resource operation, it seems difficult to kill anything important before they get enough defenders out to stop you.  But yeah, I appreciate the advice. I'm a really inexperienced player playing a really new game so I shouldn't jump to conclusions too fast."
homeworld,2z6vjy,RaZorwireSC2,2,Mon Mar 16 20:18:09 2015 UTC,"If they go for a middle resource push, let them have it until you have a decent fleet of caps and bombers. Scout the enemy mothership; if it's also well - guarded by a sizeable wall of defenders, that tells you they've sunk a LOT of resources into them at the expense of other tech/fleet. In this case, expand to other resource pockets very aggressively so you can macro up a nice fleet and take out their carrier. The key here is to hit them during the window where they haven't transitioned into a more traditional fleet composition. You don't need a massive fleet, just enough to do damage. Send in caps first; draw fire from the defenders, then send in bomber squads to focus the carrier. The defenders will switch to attacking bombers, leaving your caps to have free shots at the carrier. Really a handful of frigs and a destroyer will work nicely. It works even better if you have some flak frigates. Mop up then take middle for map control. This strategy depends on how quickly you can take out the carrier vs how quickly the opponent can switch from early resource expansion to mid - game fleet macro.  In the event their mothership isn't defended by a wall of defenders: you've been given one hell of a gift. Send bomber and interceptor squads to the mothership and take out the research ship. Focus the primary hub if they have more than one linked (it's the one with the health bar above it), and it should pop pretty quick. The research ship doesn't have that much armor, and if you blow up the primary hub, the rest will be destroyed along with it. This is a massive setback if you can pull this off; each research ship is 700 RUs and you've completely crippled their tech research. Take out a harvester or two if you want, but I'd just pull back and have your fighters meet your frigates at mid to womp on the carrier."

He knew it was coming from before the map even loaded.  He put his research vessel on top of his mothership and sandwiched his carrier on top of it to try and protect it.  It did ALMOST work, but nope.  No defense against it.  HW2 vs HW1 is autowin if the HW2 player is not terrible.  Defenders come out roughly the same time that the first torp frigate corvette comes out.  They counter something that's already come out and done their business, and come out to lose to something else.  It's like this with all of HW1 tech.  Good players will not passively tech."
homeworld,2z6vjy,innociv,1 point,Tue Mar 17 04:25:57 2015 UTC,"Did you get any resource collectors at all with that build or did you just rush fighters with your starting number? I've been playing around with a rush build (but vs HW2 races, primarily), and I've had a hard time deciding how much resourcing you can sacrifice in order to do early damage."
homeworld,2z6vjy,RaZorwireSC2,1 point,Tue Mar 17 09:33:02 2015 UTC,"Yep. Usually get like 12-14.  Build 2 at the start, from ms and carrier while moving carrier to patch.  When collectors are finishing, you make the 2 fighter production facilities, while just making collector from carrier.  Don't do fighter and collectors at the same time or they'll stall at 1k starting RU  I've only played 3 games of HW against humans and just beat one of the best HW1 players doing it to prove it to him. He knew it was coming, he knew what I'd do, and still couldn't stop it.  I don't get why these builds are so hard for people to figure out... It's so obvious.  Double fighter is a fairly standard opening as Hiigaran, anyway."
homeworld,2z6vjy,innociv,1 point,Tue Mar 17 09:45:01 2015 UTC,"It's quite possible. I never really played HW2, and the Vaygr is still pretty new to me.  But this was in low resource games. If I don't pump out collectors early on and take over a patch I'd be overwhelmed.   Corvettes would require a research module, research, and a facility. That's not quick to do, and I don't tech up much.   What would you do in those games? How's your start?"
homeworld,2z6vjy,marwynn,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:43:42 2015 UTC,"Eh?  In singleplayer I guess, maybe?  In multiplayer, by the time your first Defender comes out Hiigaran can have out 6-8 whole intercepter squads easily.  They definitely seem stronger compared to how they were in HW1, but most of the other units are all far weaker.  Drone frigates are the real OP.  A single drone frigate is equal to 40 Defenders."
homeworld,2z6vjy,innociv,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:30:03 2015 UTC,They are super strong in terms of armor/firepower for a fighter but I specifically remember that they were also extremely maneuverable. They used to dodge in a cross pattern that made them very difficult to hit. They don't do that anymore. It made them unique and I'm disappointed that they don't.

homeworld,2z5e28,Patience_dans_lazur,12,Sun Mar 15 19:05:08 2015 UTC,They kinda got powercrept over by corvette buffs and the HW2-style handling of strikecraft combat hasn't been favorable for them either.
homeworld,2z5e28,MarikBentusi,4,Sun Mar 15 19:38:40 2015 UTC,"In my recollection fighters were always pretty weak, and the heavy corvette was the way to go. I've particularly vivid memories of an entire wing of attack bombers getting minced on their attack run in Mission 5. Then again, the attack bombers WERE in formation - and when the other strikecraft are too, it massively increases their punching power. Once Gearbox fixes formations, they should be once again capable of delivering at least some kind of real damage."
homeworld,2z5e28,Calmsford,2,Sun Mar 15 19:13:49 2015 UTC,"Well even scouts had like 110 HP or something, while they took like 4 bursts to kill another or something.  HW2 fighters have 30 hp and kill others in 1 shot.  Heavy corvs I think have 1700 hp, 1/10th of a frigate, while in HW2 they have 400, 640 with upgrades."
homeworld,2z5e28,innociv,2,Mon Mar 16 14:34:04 2015 UTC,"Funnily enough, I thought strike craft squads were a huge improvement in HW2. Being able to put strike craft into these massive, rigid formations always seemed incredibly unnatural. I'd love to see them implemented in HW1R."
homeworld,2z5e28,Silent_Hastati,3,Sun Mar 15 19:40:04 2015 UTC,If you just want HWR2 fighter wings in HWR1 SP I've seen a few mods that accomplish that in the workshop.
homeworld,2z5e28,eqdw,1 point,Mon Mar 16 07:15:50 2015 UTC,No!!!! Massive rigid formations were always awesome.   The best thing was a strike wing of 25 Acolytes (Cataclysm) in claw formation. With upgraded energy weapons and missiles. Swoop them down on a destroyer or something and fire all the missiles at once. It looked fuckin awesome
homeworld,2z5e28,DuncanMonroe,1 point,Tue Mar 17 20:59:08 2015 UTC,"Light corvettes were the best unit in the game, for cost, in HW1. Those and support frigates were the backbone of an army."
homeworld,2z5e28,Cazadore,4,Sat Mar 21 11:47:16 2015 UTC,"in classic hw1, if you create a strikegroup and formation, fighters stay in that formation, and can actualy deal some damage.  in remastered, strikecrafts break formations as soon as combat starts, everything you planned gets thrown out the window... because your pilots think ""well that flak frigate is a much better target for my fighter plane than that bomber delivering his last payload to one of our crucial destroyers"" , and not to forget, your fighters stay in combat as long until they die, in classic they had the fuel mechanic limiting their flight time. then they returned for fuel and repair back to a supply ship/carrier/corvette  esp. nerving, corvettes who cant hit a barn, because hw2 corvettes have real turrets, while hw1 corvettes dont ... their weapons cant rotate 360°  thats how it seems to me ... at last  edit: i remember to dread the gardens of kadesh ... when i first arrived there in classic hw1... those swarmers teared me a new hole ... today i got through that mission in a cakewalk, cause these swarmers are also extremyl nerfed by the botched fighter mechanic, they swarm EVERYWHERE AND ANYTHING at the same time, AND NEVER RETURN FOR REPAIR TO THEIR FUEL SHIPS, meaning my assault-frigs and defenders can churn through them in no time."
homeworld,2z5e28,ShenBear,1 point,Sun Mar 15 22:45:13 2015 UTC,"But to be perfectly honest, unless on mission 5 in HW1 Classic SP (Asteroid mission, if my numbers are off) you never need to refuel. Maybe in the Garden/Cathedral missions, but honestly I simply corvette the swarmers and capture the fuel pods.   Also, HW1 vettes DO have turrets (at least in classic. Kushan Lights and Heavies have full rotation beneath the chassis)"
homeworld,2z5e28,HellsAttack,5,Wed Mar 18 10:29:50 2015 UTC,I consider it a bug and a major flaw in the remastered version.

Believe me, I love the heavy and multigun corvettes, but fighters are trash in HM1R. They had some purpose in Classic."
homeworld,2z5e28,teh_wamburger,2,Mon Mar 16 00:10:51 2015 UTC,Sooo... any news from Gearbox on this? Are they actually going to do anything about fighters or is this as good as it's going to get?
homeworld,2z5e28,LuckyHRE,2,Wed Mar 18 19:34:00 2015 UTC,"Third patch is going to be MP related. Next big patch is going to be GAMEPLAY related, so expect some stuff there.  In the meanwhile, mods. Try the Remastered Balanced mod. Song of Kushan is also pretty popular but I haven't tried it. They tweak corvettes and fighters a bit so that they're useful."
homeworld,2z5e28,xbrownbear,2,Fri Mar 20 14:07:42 2015 UTC,"Fighters are useless but all Bombers, properly controlled are a pretty useful glass cannon if you're looking for an alternative for your RU and units. Just micro them well so they come from a direction where there's few enemies and just target them between each enemy frigate - capital so you maximize the time they are shooting.   They are decent against all enemies if they are flanking as well. If enemy strikecraft are focusing your other ships you can send your hornet squadron to pick actually a surprisingly large amount of them off."
homeworld,2z5e28,SonicOverlordUK,2,Mon Mar 16 11:27:27 2015 UTC,I resort to Multi-gun and Heavy corvettes and only use fighters if I pinched them from the Tuskan raiders. Scouts are alright but only if you want them to rush around where you think the enemy is
homeworld,2z5e28,ShenBear,2,Mon Mar 16 18:20:37 2015 UTC,"Next time you play through, ignore the multis and go with the heavies (in classic. Don't know about Remaster). You're unlikely to be outnumbered 6:1, and heavy turrets have the penetration to take on corvettes as well as strike craft (and are still incredibly accurate)"
homeworld,2z5e28,Swiftarm,1 point,Wed Mar 18 10:33:06 2015 UTC,So much of this. I went into this game a noob and have been crushing with these two. Add in a destroyer or two and you can take anything(ish).

homeworld,2z5e28,kuroji,1 point,Tue Mar 17 17:20:10 2015 UTC,"The HW2 balance system is an issue in itself. But another issue that comes along with it... from what I have seen, your fighters do not care about friendly fire when approaching a target. Send a decently sized squadron against a larger target, or even just in a nasty dogfight, and they'll damage friendlies. I'm sure it cuts both ways, but it's rather unfortunate."
homeworld,2z5e28,ShenBear,1 point,Mon Mar 16 06:58:28 2015 UTC,"This happens on HW1 classic too. Lost most of a wing of 30 bombers when killing asteroids in the SP mission. They fire at the enemy, but don't check to see if the bomb will hit someone else (or rather, they fly into the shot too)"

homeworld,2z5e28,ShenBear,1 point,Mon Mar 16 14:33:01 2015 UTC,"I played through HW1 classic (original disk) a couple months back. Interceptors and scouts on evasive and formationless until you get heavy corvettes. After that, that's all you need strikecraft wise. HCs get the job done, and have the accuracy and penetration to take on all strikecraft, whereas multiguns are only really effective against swarmers.   Exceptions would be the graveyard and the ghost ship levels."
homeworld,2z5e28,marwynn,1 point,Wed Mar 18 10:27:16 2015 UTC,Light and Multigun Corvettes were the things to use back in the day.
homeworld,2z593r,OACyberiad,3,Sun Mar 15 18:25:34 2015 UTC,"As soon as the Dreadnought restores its engines, order it to move behind the Mothership to buy yourself some time. Do the same when the Shipyard arrives, and have a handful of Platforms placed around (they maybe aren't so useful attacking, but it's another target your enemy has to take down).  Use groups efficiently, based on their role or class. Personally, I play both HW1 and HW2 this way:   Group 1 : Interceptors (Anti-figther) Group 2 : Bombers (Anti-capital) Group 3 : Gunships (Anti-fighter) Group 4 : Pulsar Gunships (Anti-corvette) Group 5, 6 and 7 : Flak, Torpedo and Ion Frigates respectively Group 8 : Capital ships (Destroyers, BC, Dreadnought) Group 9 : Movers Group 10 : Marine frigates (Don't underestimate them! With a bit of luck you can capture or disable a Destroyer or BC quite easily)   This way I launch the Sensors Manager, use the tactical overview (Press Tab) and if I see a mass of figthers, I send group 1, 3 or 5, the most nearer. If I see corvettes, group 4 and 6. Capital ships, 2, 6, 7, and 8. In this particular mission you'll have hostiles from all directions, so it will require a bit of micromanaging and trial and error. Groups are also useful with knowing which ships you have to rebuild. If I select group 1 and I see 4 interceptors, then damn, I need to build 3 right away.  If you also have to build another ships, USE YOUR CARRIERS, remember to build in parallel. If you don't have 3 already, it's a good time to do so. When you are done, pause the game, zoom out all the way, select all your ships, and rebuild the groups with the new ships you built.  Try to capture a Vaygr BC if you can! Sometimes a group of two destroyers with some frigates will appear. To buy me some time, I usually order my capitals to concentrate fire on the frigates, and then I sneak from below my marine frigates to capture/disable the destroyers.  When the carriers arrive, attack them all at once. Send your bombers to one, your capitals to another, and your frigates to the last one, while your corvettes and interceptors repel the ships they launch. I insist, you will lose A LOT of ships, so remember to ALWAYS BE REBUILDING YOUR FLEET. It's the key.  In that final attack, I had my marine frigates strategically placed (with a bit of trial and error) so while the destroyers are being pounded by my bombers, I sneaked them to capture/disable the BC. Try to use some strategy involving the marine frigates if you are having problem with that last attack.  Save often! And have fun, if you're raging, quit for a while and come back later! :D  PD: I forgot, as soon as the gates arrive, send groups to destroy them. The longer they stay, the harder the mission becomes."
homeworld,2z593r,LuckyHRE,3,Sun Mar 15 19:04:01 2015 UTC,"This one is kinda tough, but the key to all the missions in this game is to use the right counters. Each chip is very good at destroying certain other ships, and bad against everything else.  Save your destroyers for enemy frigates and destroyers, but try to soften the dessies up with bombers.  On that note, don't build any interceptors. All your fighter capacity should be going to bombers. Corvettes (about a halfway split between pulsar and regular gunships) along with torpedo frigates (again, about half split with ion frigates) can handle enemy strike craft.   Keep your destroyers repaired between capital ship fights. Your workers are primarily repair ships in this game, since the game autoharvests at the end of each level.   The first half or so of the level is mainly defensive. Keep all your ships close together and fight off one wave at a time. Once the dreadnaught is repaired and can move again, you can start pushing out to destroy the enemy carriers.  For the battlecruiser, from here and for the rest of the game, it's all about the bombers. Destroy the missile launcher subsystem, then the engines. Once it can't move, just keep your ships away from the front of it, and it's basically defenseless. Bombers are the best way to kill battlecruisers, hands down."
homeworld,2z593r,sumelar,2,Sun Mar 15 22:06:27 2015 UTC,this is how it ends every time even with advise :(  http://i.imgur.com/lhu7ILl.jpg
homeworld,2z593r,m0rningb0ner,2,Sun Mar 15 23:39:50 2015 UTC,"This is a tough mission in a tough game. Here's what I did:  14 Bombers, 10 movers  6 Gunships, 6 Pulsars  6 Flaks, 6 Torpedoes, 8 Ions  As many destroyers as possible (you said you had 3?)  Scatter some probes around the map so you have vision. You need to be able to see what coming.  Keep your destroyers, frigates, and corvettes as a ""death-ball"" in the center of the map by your mothership and shipyard. They should be able to take out enemy strike craft. Use your destroyers to kill approaching frigates. Strike craft will target your frigates; try not to lose too many. Keep your resource collectors repairing. Also, don't send your frigates against heavy missile frigates.  Use your bombers and and movers to kill enemy carriers. Target the ones that don't have much fighter escorts. Sometimes, you'll have to send your bombers around from the top/bottom so they don't draw aggro from the units coming from the carrier to your mothership. Bomber time is precious! Keep them focused on high-priority targets and send them back to repair when said target has been destroyed. If there are no carriers or hyperspace gates, target small frigate groups. Kill assault frigates first before heavy missile frigates.  The last bit of the mission is the toughest. You'll be up against a battlecruiser and 5(?) destroyers. Use your bombers to take out the BC's engines and missile battery. I usually won't hit destroyers with bombers (too much health) but taking out their engines can buy some time. You'll have to commit all your frigates/destroyers. Use capital ship phalanx formation so the destroyers will soak damage. The dreadnaught is quite powerful even without the main cannon. The mothership and shipyard make good meat shields. You can also try to capture the BC as other posters suggest.  Now, here's the part you probably won't like: If you haven't been doing too well in the previous missions, this one might be borderline impossible. You might have to reload an earlier mission and try to come in with a stronger fleet and more resources. Good luck =D"
homeworld,2z593r,colluphid42,1 point,Mon Mar 16 03:10:34 2015 UTC,"It looks like you're being swamped by strike craft and corvettes. You probably need better small-ship coverage. Your capital ships are terrible at that, and it's a waste of their firepower to vaporize one bomber at a time. Try to shift some of your production toward gunships, interceptors, and flak frigates. Put all those in a group, and point them at the strike craft. Keep your pulsar gunships and maybe some torpedo frigates going after the corvettes. Capital and ion frigates can handle enemy capital ships."

Destroy hyperspace gates as soon as they appear, you can remember their location and send your strike crafts there before. You can use movers to destroy them, they are pretty useless for anything but this ;). Don't fight the strike crafts with yours, use flaks. Retreat your frigates and destroyers if you see heavy missile frigates coming. Destroy them with bombers and pulsar corvettes.  Disable the battlecruiser's engines and missile battery with bombers, capture it (will be helpful in the next mission). Destroy Vaygr carriers one by one with your strike crafts, don't move heavier ships away from the map center."

By itself, it barely fires anything to close targets (like bombers attacking it), but if I micromanage it and manually pick bombers, it eats them alive (like the performance of 10 flak frigates or so it seems, sometimes I can barely keep up clicking targets to shoot at). At some point in the missions, I finished the enemy off entirely with the Dreadnaught, since it could kill every sort of ship easily."

Thus, FedEx Express does not mean Federal Express Express.  This is similar to AT&T, which no longer means American Telegraph & Telephone Corp, later AT&T Corp.

homeworld,2z1x4z,heathenl,2,Sun Mar 15 04:57:37 2015 UTC,"I've heard people say that a lot ""just change a little at a time until it's balanced"", but then it'd take a year with how underpowered HW1 ships and the race as a whole are.  It needed complete working to start with, which then small changes can be made from.  Besides good HW2 players having near 100% win rates against good HW1 players, the numbers for the ship/weapon values give a pretty objective outlook on things.  Plus, I tested lots.  It's very clear that the HW1 ship stats are 50% random, and 50% just there to roughly balance the single player.  No attempt to balance them in multiplayer versus HW2 races was made."

The game needs design changes as well to be better balanced and more fair and fun. I'm not sure GBX is ""brave"" enough for that.  I'd rather see HWRM multiplayer be HW2.5."
homeworld,2z0tr1,molecularbioguy,15,Sat Mar 14 14:50:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, even if the gameplay issues in HW1R never get satisfactorily resolved, it's still got the classic games now finally available through a convenient digital platform, and of course there's nothing wrong with HW2R. If, as you say, you've never fully experienced HW2, the you really ought to give it a try."
homeworld,2z0tr1,Rogue100,7,Sat Mar 14 15:45:35 2015 UTC,"If you mainly care about HW2R and the classic editions, yes. If you're interested in HW1R, it gets trickier since we don't if Gearbox is gonna keep working on it beyond deploying bugfixes. Similar case for the multiplayer that definitely still feels like a beta. Official mod tools aren't out yet either. Doesn't really feel like a full release all around, more like a rush job with really pretty graphics.  I wouldn't buy it with the expectation of Gearbox fixing all those issues. The HWR team probably didn't get a whole lot of resources allocated or the release would have been much more rounded and complete and preview builds wouldn't have differed so wildly in functionality as they got closer and closer to release. Who knows what priorities the HWR team has beyond critical bug fixes and pushing multiplayer out of the door, who knows how much the modding community will end up being able to fix."
homeworld,2z0tr1,MarikBentusi,5,Sat Mar 14 16:05:19 2015 UTC,"To be fair, they pushed two major patches the fist week of release.

The patches that have come out already fixed several of the bigger issues, and I'm having a blast playing HW1 with minimal issues."
homeworld,2z0tr1,Kampher7,11,Sat Mar 14 20:53:24 2015 UTC,It's still a hell of a lot of game for 30 quid.  I'd go for it if I were you.
homeworld,2z0tr1,grogleberry,9,Sat Mar 14 15:31:44 2015 UTC,"There are issues but Gearbox is working pretty hard on fixes. The original games are included in the collection anyway so you can play those in case the issues give you too much trouble. There are some changes to gameplay that are obviously intended (for instance, paid research), but broken formations aren't a ""feature"", Gearbox actually said they are looking into fixing it. I have successfully beaten Homeworld Remastered, so the game is in no way unplayable/unbeatable, but it feels somewhat unbalanced in places. For instance, Diamond Shoals is ridiculously hard because your ships just ignore asteroids and bump into them like idiots, yet The Gardens of Kadesh is very easy for some reason, even though it's probably supposed to be hard (I never got that far in the original so I wouldn't really know)."

A day just to read through HW2s code and another to get it implemented.  In a week, I could make something from scratch where movement and attack pathing works roughly the same as HW1 if I just didn't have more important things to do. It's not that complicated.  I don't think most people expect it to be exactly like HW1. HW1 had a number of issues/exploits with how its worked.  They just don't want it to be terrible like it is in HW2.

Even if you were right, compiling the software afterwards into the complete executable and issuing a patch through steam doesn't seem to be well document so my hand waving feeling is that issuing the patch must cost something, and has its own set of risks: better to batch together items into a slightly bigger patch, in the absence of continuous integration."

The game is pretty, but more in a 2007 way than a 2015 way.  HW1 doesn't work right, and it doesn't feel like a remaster or an update as far as mechanics or tactics go.  That being said, HW2 remastered works fine, but I don't really feel like there was much of a graphical update. So if all you really want is the original games available on steam, I say go for it.  But It really feels like there is a huge deficit of effort left to bring HW1:R into any kind of a polished state, either by restoring original mechanics or actually putting in the work to really integrate the new mechanics into the old ships."

I mean, hell, if the Somtaaw have super acolytes from the Bentusi, why did the Vagyr even stand a chance in HW2?  That's what makes HW1 so damn special. It's not about saving the galaxy from a threat. It's about exiles reclaiming their birthright, victims of a genocide set off by violating a 3000 year old treaty they never knew existed.

homeworld,2yxdh7,sumelar,1 point,Fri Mar 13 23:24:39 2015 UTC,Easiest way to get that Heavy Cruiser is to slowly creep up.  The two destroyers will aggro but the Cruiser isn't visible yet.  Turn them into slag.  A little further up is the Cruiser all by itself.  Distract it with some scouts and send in the salvage corvette cavalry.  The only problem is that it takes forever to tow that sucker back to mothership.  Its a large map.

homeworld,2yxtxr,exilekiller,3,Fri Mar 13 19:05:06 2015 UTC,"should I be exploring the whole map before hyperspacing to the next area?   That shouldn't be necessary, all the remaining resources should automatically collect once you warp to the next level. However, there's currently a bug that prevents that from happening in the first few missions, I think mission 5 and up are fine. So if you want all the resources from missions 1-4, you'll currently have to do it the boring way and let the collectors finish their work before jumping on.   Should I be going after those guys with salvage corvettes?   Use salvage corvettes as much as you can, yes. Those things are insanely good, since enemy ""health"" doesn't matter, and you actually get the ship."
homeworld,2yxtxr,marwynn,3,Fri Mar 13 19:11:17 2015 UTC,"The Ion Array Frigates are worth salvaging if nothing else than to add to the diversity of your fleet. Also the easiest way to deal with them. Just send the salvettes in with some cover, not directly towards the Ion Array Frigate's weapon. The salvettes are tough but they're not that tough."
homeworld,2yxtxr,sumelar,3,Fri Mar 13 19:38:55 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. It's possible to get all of them if you build enough corvettes in the previous missions (which is tougher since they made research cost RU's, but it's possible) Make sure you set your own ships to passive tactics and move them away, otherwise they'll keep attacking the salvage target and destroy it. Don't get more than 3 collectors. RU's in the early game will be fairly low. My theory is they didn't rebalance the mission resource values when they ported the game. In the original, research was free. 3 Collectors + 1 Controller is all you need. Tell the controller to Guard the collectors, and it will stay in range. Also, the game auto-harvests all available resources when you hyperspace out, so you don't need to hang around grabbing everything. Not really. There aren't any secrets in these games from what I remember, not like other games have. The maps are also fairly small.   Salvage everything you can. You should always be maxxed out at 14 salvage corvettes. Make use of the 3D environment. Ships have firing arcs. Most have the bulk of their firepower in the front, ion frigates especially. Attack from above, below, behind, wherever to get around their guns. Support frigates can heal your other ships. Might seem obvious, but back in the day I didn't know this. Thought they were just for refueling and repairing strike craft. But they can repair capital ships too. You can retire ships you don't need anymore to get some of the RU's back, and free up space for newer, more advanced ships. This is especially important in the early game as you get new technologies. I won't give too much away, but you won't be needing interceptors or heavy corvettes much longer."

homeworld,2ywjzt,METROID4,1 point,Fri Mar 13 13:13:54 2015 UTC,"That's a heck of a weird issue, this is a valid Russian letter. I have no idea how to unpack big files, and much less on how to pack them back. Is there a way to make the launcher recognise an unpacked, edited file as a mod, maybe?"
homeworld,2ywjzt,METROID4,2,Fri Mar 13 13:38:33 2015 UTC,"So a quick way to do that:  You'll need BigDecrypter, so you need to extract that bigDecrypter_1.2a.zip, drop the .big file onto the batch file called dropBigHere.bat, after it has processed, a new .big file appears with the same name as the original/input but with _decrypted in the name.  Which .big file you need depends, you can often get the right one based on name (they're all in \Homeworld\HomeworldRM\Data). Homeworld2.big contains most information, also the Russian localisation, HW2Ships.big contains all the ships of the HW2 races, Music.big contains all the music and so on.  After that, you've got a (for example) Homeworld2_decrypted.big. That's a big file in the same format as the classic HW2 big files and can thus be opened with classic tools. There are several ones, I use Spookysoft - HW2ICArchive 1.6.0.0 (GDrive download, if it pops up error messages with missing files, download this and insert the file which is said to be missing in the error message, to the folder where HW2ICArchive.exe is located (so it's next to it). Do this until no more error messages pop up/no files are missing. After it opened, click on the second icon (Hiigaran symbol, for HW2 big files), then open the decryped .big file (in our case Homeworld2_decrypted.big), and hit Save all, which is the last icon in the row (multiple save/floppy drive icons, not the single one).  It's completed when the progress bar is full and the status bar just says the name of the .big file. Now you have a new ""data"" folder where the (decrypted) .big file was opened from. In that, there are all kinds of scripts which you can open with any text processing program, but I recommend some ""smarter"" ones, like the free Notepad++ or Sublime Text.  In Homeworld2.big's extracted data\locale\russian are all the locale elements, throughout all the files (so the ui.ucs is for UI elements, the ships.ucs is for text which you see when you select/mouse over a ship etc.). You can CTRL F search for a locale code to quickly find them.  Now if you modify a file, put it back into the HWRM data folder, where you got the original encrypted .big file from (so in \Homeworld\HomeworldRM\Data), in the same folder structure as found in the extracted .big file, except you don't need a ""data"" folder.  So let's say you want to edit a ship's name, you take the ships.ucs file found in Homeworld2.big\data\locale\russian\, put it into the folder (you need to create these folders, since they don't exist yet) \Homeworld\HomeworldRM\Data\locale\russian.  Now to make the game use these changes, add a Launch Parameter to the game (e.g. in Steam, rightclick HW:RC, properties, Set Launch Options and add text there), which is:  -overridebigfile   After that, launch the game and it should use your changed files/mods.  If there are problems/crashes, you can add the following launch parameter:  -luaTrace   which can be added next to the previous one, so it looks like this:  -overridebigfile -luaTrace   That luatrace command forces the game to describe all kinds of events in the log file (HwRM.log found in \Homeworld\HomeworldRM\Bin\Release), including error messages, which are often quite descriptive and tell you what the problem exactly is (sometimes, though, it doesn't tell much/anything, in that case it's often a major error and you need to check it yourself, like a missing file).  I hope this helps, if you have questions about it, I'd like to answer them!  Edit: Used some word order weird."
homeworld,2ywjzt,METROID4,1 point,Fri Mar 13 15:19:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks a bunch. I have attempted to look at the localisation files extracted from RussianHW1Campaign.big, but I can't see anything wrong with them, they look just fine. I am very confused. By the way, there's an official tool to extract .big files (not decrypt them) included with Homeworld Remastered Collection, apparently, ""archive.exe""."
homeworld,2ywjzt,METROID4,1 point,Fri Mar 13 15:21:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, they just included one of these classic tools (that archive.exe was the same which is included in Relic Developer's Network toolset released for original HW2 back then). However, I liked to have an UI where you can browse in the archive without extracting it, extract only a part (like one folder), so I got used to that, that's why I don't use archive.exe."
homeworld,2ywjzt,KBSMilk,1 point,Fri Mar 13 15:29:02 2015 UTC,I don't get why they had to encrypt the files if they wanted the game to have modding support in the first place.
homeworld,2ywjzt,KBSMilk,1 point,Fri Mar 13 16:44:23 2015 UTC,"I first thought it's because of the preload, so that we couldn't access the files before the game was launched, but some of the patch files which came later are also encrypted.  It could be that they didn't want us to edit game files yet (and might have underestimated how quickly someone came up with a decryptor), so that when they release their tools, it's easier to mod (since some things changed, and in this way possibly not everyone can jump into modding with old tools).  But yeah, I don't see much of usefulness of this."
homeworld,2ywjzt,MagnusRune,1 point,Fri Mar 13 17:33:14 2015 UTC,"So what I've noticed is:  The Russian locale files are ending in .ucs instead of .dat (for English), doesn't seem to make a difference.  The English localisations include a filerange x y and rangestart x y (e.g. filerange 60401 60813 rangestart 60401 60813) line, and end with rangeend. Adding this doesn't make changes.  However, only mission 2 is not working (from 3 on, and I suppose the rest) do include Russian subtitles. I could not yet find any difference betwee the mission 2 file and the rest."
homeworld,2ywjzt,KBSMilk,1 point,Fri Mar 13 15:50:50 2015 UTC,"Yes actually, I've done it to make some small mods for myself.

homeworld,2yw0ra,METROID4,2,Sat Mar 14 02:03:22 2015 UTC,"Oh those are the dump files and their corresponding error logs, unfortunately those don't tell much.

homeworld,2yw0ra,METROID4,2,Sat Mar 14 03:46:50 2015 UTC,"Okay, so unfortunately this is one of these cases where the game crashes before it could input anything useful in the .log file, so it still doesn't tell much.  My log file looks exactly the same (except OS and GPU) when I launch HW1RM and play Skirmish as Taiidan on Terah.  One of the cases where it crashes to desktop without telling anything is in model/shader errors (e.g. when a ship is missing its HOD file).  So, I can't exactly tell you what'll solve it, but some things which might do it are:  Run HW:RM as administrator (although Win7 has less problems with this than 8, it could still cause issues with UAC enabled)  Try some other configurations in Skirmish, have a look if it still crashes (so less/more players, other maps, not you but an AI [friend/enemy] Taiidan player etc.)  Check if it crashes with Carrier only enabled in gamerules  Otherwise, I'm not sure how capable the Cache integrity check is (I always doubted its functionality, I think it often only helps to a certain extent), so you could try to completely reinstall HW:RM (Delete Local Content and then install again). If you choose to reinstall, you might want to backup your profile, found in \Homeworld\HomeworldRM\Bin\Profiles\ (it's usually just a folder called Profile1), so copy that folder to a safe place (e.g. in your Documents) and paste it back again after HW:RM is reinstalled."

homeworld,2yqn8d,Master-Thief,2,Thu Mar 12 08:09:34 2015 UTC,"I love the idea of it, but the idea of a planet close to the galactic center (or far away from it) hosting a habitable planet seems to have been jossed by astrophysics.:   if you are interested in regions of the galaxy where life as we know it can exist, there are good regions and there are bad regions. Specifically, the ""Goldilocks zone"" where life can develop is a torus shaped region centered on the galactic core. The inner edge is 7 kiloparsecs (23,000 light years) from the core, and the outer edge is 9 kiloparsecs (29,000 light years) from the core. Earth's sun Sol orbits right in the middle, at 8.33 ± 0.35 kiloparsecs (about 27,000 light years).  Inside 7 kiloparsecs, the incidence of supernovae is so large that the radiation would fry any planets developing life. Outside of 9 kiloparsecs, there are not enough heavy elements to form any planets. So the galactic habitable zone is the only place where life as we know it can develop.   Oh well."
homeworld,2yqn8d,xlynx,3,Thu Mar 12 18:31:13 2015 UTC,"Key word being ""develop"" as opposed to ""survive"". In the HW lore, Hiigarans did not evolve on Hiigara but thought to have descended from the Progenitor race who came from another galaxy.  The distinction is important because intense gamma ray bursts must be billions of years apart for intelligent life to evolve, but could be as frequent as tens of thousands of years apart for a planet to support civilisation and terraforming.  There's also possibilities like planets with robust atmospheres to better regenerate or shield. Doesn't seem plausible for close supernova but could increase the range significantly over Earth's."
homeworld,2yqn8d,xlynx,2,Sun Mar 15 03:57:44 2015 UTC,"Also, the HW galaxy (M51) is roughly half the diameter of the Milky Way (60,000 LY vs 100-120,000 LY), so it's conceivable the M51 core is smaller and/or less dense and the habitable zone stretches much closer to the core."

So most enemies simply melt. Factor in salvaging and the wonky auto-harvesting and HW1 is far easier than we remember it being.  Also, you're probably a better gamer after 16 years..."
homeworld,2yss69,marwynn,3,Thu Mar 12 15:18:32 2015 UTC,"Up until Mission 10, I had convinced myself that i had just played some many times that i was just really good and knew everything to be able to win easily.

Now i just think the balancing is way off.   I still won the final mission with all the assault frigates I've been saving.   I don't think I'm spoliering anything in a 15 year old game, but in the final mission the Taidann mothership is guarded by three heavy cruisers, each with two support frigates and a carrier nearby.   The taiidani rebel captain appears and gloriously charged straight into the heavy cruisers with his destroyer and got slaughtered.  My destroyers and cruisers were tagging along behind, but were lagging because they were in formation.   But at the same time I sent my 15+ assault frigates way over to the right, and had them dash in and start pounding the taidanii mothership. The heavy cruisers were too slow to react and the mothership died before they could kill my frigates."
homeworld,2yss69,BigBennP,1 point,Fri Mar 13 15:57:40 2015 UTC,"Yes. It's mostly HW2 HPs though the DPS is 3-5x less per cost for corvettes and fighters, for some reason.  HC, frig, and destroyer DPS roughly matches HW2 units."
homeworld,2yss69,innociv,3,Thu Mar 12 17:15:29 2015 UTC,"It's definitely much easier, but at the same time there are a couple very unforgiving moments. I cruised through it far more smoothly than any of my many past playthroughs, but I also lost the Mothership twice, the first time I'd lost it at all in at least a decade.   First time was in Diamond Shoals thanks to my attack bombers bulleting into the first asteroid they were told to attack, leaving me largely defenseless, the second was to a pair of destroyers in the final mission. Either their damage output has been so wildly increased or the Mothership's health decreased (or both) that they took it from full health in just a few shots, even in spite of the support frigates. I attribute that to the lack of multibeam frigates I normally have to smash fleets with, as very few of them ever spawned in the Kadesh levels."
homeworld,2yss69,StranaMechty,1 point,Thu Mar 12 16:03:46 2015 UTC,"I have a big fleet of capital ships and I can't beat diamond shoals.  After three tries I said ""fuck it"" and went back to skirmishes.  That mission was way easier in the original"

homeworld,2yss69,Oskiee,2,Fri Mar 13 01:20:02 2015 UTC,Heavy corvettes and defenders seem the best option. They don't fly straight into it like strike craft with fixed weaponry and have a bit more maneuverability than capitals.
homeworld,2yss69,StranaMechty,5,Thu Mar 12 20:15:15 2015 UTC,"I was shocked with how easy the Kadeshi missions were-and from there on out, it stayed easy.  Am I a ""better"" gamer?

homeworld,2yss69,beingsad,3,Thu Mar 12 21:15:13 2015 UTC,I thought to myself that I was a better gamer as well when I basically eased through the game. I went back to classic and proved myself wrong. The dynamics have definitely changed.
homeworld,2yss69,Hunterkiller2011,4,Thu Mar 12 21:23:40 2015 UTC,I might go and try running through specifically the Kadeshi missions in Classic with a similar sized fleet-I'm interested in how those missions specifically compare.

Saying that, not sure if I'll be doing it to show its not the same. I greatly appreciate what they've done with the game, and with that I excepted some changes.   However, even with the changes they did to the game/system/engine/etc, the lack of a challenge (at those levels and on) was slightly disheartening."
homeworld,2yss69,beingsad,2,Thu Mar 12 21:42:13 2015 UTC,"especially the Gardens of Kadesh and Cathedral of Kadesh, those were always very memorable moments in the game."
homeworld,2yss69,Hunterkiller2011,1 point,Thu Mar 12 21:56:04 2015 UTC,I did a similar topic some days ago  and went straight back to classic after I finsihed HW2 and did the kadesh missions. I beat the levels there as well but it was still the challenge I had in memory even thou in classic specific mechanics and formations actually work and make some fleet actions easier! Multibeamers are actually wrecking everything and shoot also frigates unlike in the remastered version. There you only have to worry about the fuel pots if at all. They also destroy your mothership in seconds if you dont anticipate them somehow for example with salvage corvs. (http://www.reddit.com/r/homeworld/comments/2y9mjs/hw1_way_too_easy/)
homeworld,2yss69,possiblemaybe,2,Fri Mar 13 04:16:33 2015 UTC,"Auto-harvesting made a HUGE difference.  That said, I think it's a good change, the gameplay value of sitting there harvesting remaining resources for 45 minutes after you've beaten the level is...well, minimal.   Some other things are easier, some are harder. I got a nasty surprise on the last level when the HC force that comes from the front basically kills the mothership in one volley unless you've got repair units on the Mothership and burn down the heavy cruiser as soon as you see it. Likewise, Strike Craft like Interceptors end up being largely useless and die far too fast, on the plus side it meant that destroying the Taiidan strike craft was very easy."
homeworld,2yss69,Molonious,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:34:04 2015 UTC,"Kill the ones below, then kill the ones from the front; they never reach the MS when I play.   Salvage the two destroyers and the HC; the missile destroyers and frigates are harmless.   Just remember to send something after the top carrier and it's strike craft.  Yes, the game is much easier, in my opinion.   I've replayed the originals every couple of years, and they remain harder, even with the mass-salvage possibilities.    Shoals is always nerve wracking to avoid losses, as is the second Kadeshi, but both are easier now -- but the reward for winning is less to.   On occasion I've had 20+ fuel pods at 700 RU each caught and queued for recycling.   This isn't going to happen in the remaster."
homeworld,2yss69,dad4x,2,Thu Mar 12 20:44:08 2015 UTC,"Yea... i just finished the campign not 10 minutes ago, and it was really easy... the bugs and the balancing were the only things that made it kinda sorta hard."
homeworld,2yss69,Oskiee,1 point,Fri Mar 13 01:21:17 2015 UTC,"After completing it I tried to set the difficulty harder but alas it isn't there.  But currently I am playing it again and it is somewhat harder..  Say the mission when you return to Kharak and have to save the 6 cryopods.  The first time around there were 2 assault frigates to destroy/capture.  The 2nd time around there were 3 and I lost one of the pods.  I do not know if this was tweaking by Gearbox,  but it was a little harder.  Supernova was still fairly easy.  Although that battlegroup near the end did take out a bunch of my ships before I took them down."

Assault Frigates also received massive buffs to firing, aiming and so on.

homeworld,2yrox3,DainBramage77,4,Thu Mar 12 06:14:55 2015 UTC,"I just had this same issue in Classic.  Did all three objectives appear?  They should be:   Destroy carrier Destroy all defense forces Destroy research station   I did a lot of Googling (and cursing) before I found my answer.  The problem is that in the mission scripting, the original devs assumed you would take the main path through the middle of the map.  Disappointing, since it's one of the coolest levels ever, but you should conform to the devs' intent if you want to clear the level.  Load up a mission 9 save to restart level 10 from scratch, go through the middle vein, destroy all defense forces BEFORE destroying the research station, and don't salvage any of the ships guarding the station.  It was only by doing all of this that I was able to complete the mission."
homeworld,2yrox3,chordial,2,Thu Mar 12 07:54:51 2015 UTC,"I had no problem with this mission when I salvaged everything frigate‑class and up. I got everything that was away from the research station before anything that was next to it, though."
homeworld,2yrox3,anglertaio,2,Thu Mar 12 16:15:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the classic strategy -- load carriers with salvettes and drop them on the two outlier posts, salvage them in place, and load up the salvettes before moving on.  Not sure it's worth the trouble in RM; I gave up salvaging frigates after getting destroyers.    Might go back on snatching frigates for RU if the Junkyard trick works.  I really want to get my 50+ salvettes back."
homeworld,2yrox3,dad4x,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:55:11 2015 UTC,This is good advice. After salvaging a couple of hundred frigates the game starts having trouble with pathing. I got a couple of crashes before splitting them up into smaller groups (and retiring a few dozen).

There were apparently 100k pre-orders, so hopefully that represents at least $1m of income on it's own but I've no idea what proportion that will make up of total sales.  You'd also hope there's going to be a steady trickle of people getting the game over the next while, and some little bonus sales whenever the game appears in it's first Steam sale.  Shipbreakers is in a funny spot, because on one hand they might want to have it test the waters for interest in the RTS genre before deciding if more games are viable for them. On the other, it won't be Homeworld as we know it, so I'm not sure how accurate a predictor it'll be.  If it's not viable for Gearbox, but Shipbreakers is relatively successful, I'd love to see Blackbird get the chance to make licensed Homeworld games."

homeworld,2yq5gp,bookofgreg,5,Wed Mar 11 22:03:37 2015 UTC,"From a financial standpoint I'm not so sure.  Prior to release Gearbox said they went way over budget on HWR because it was essentially a labour of love - it can't have been cheap re-doing all those textures and re-recording voice work. If that's true they might not make their money back right now.  However, 100k pre-orders is pretty good, so perhaps if HWR sold well it could lead to a demand for further games in the series, which might lead to a profit in the long run. But as far as I know we don't have any official sales statistics yet.  I'm not a game developer, so how much it costs to do stuff is completely unknown to me. All I know is that making games is very expensive, and that typically people are very bad at estimating how much things cost (or how long it takes to do things, for that matter). Which leads me to believe HWR probably cost more to develop than we think, and will ultimately be a loss for them.  I'm not too worried - Borderlands is the money maker for Gearbox, so they can probably afford to lose money on Homeworld."

Still I guess many of us who like the re release dont understand what there is to complain about that you expect to be fixed. That we got a rerelease on any platform is amazing. That the rerelease combined both games is something you could complain about but they also updated almost all of the art assets of both games added in new lighting and new effect and a bunch of other stuff. We could have just been given the games made to run on modern systems like other rereleases ohh wait we got that as well... shit.   I have already run through both campaigns with only two bugs since release and my experience is unusual so i guess that biases me a bit. Only thing that isnt finished is the multiplayer but it was released in beta and Im guessing theyre going to fix it.

The scaling made for an interesting challenge, like facing Makaan and his 16 battlecruisers. And I agree with the wings, though more because of an ease of handling point. Never really bothered with strike craft in HW1R; replacing them was too tedious."
homeworld,2yog7j,KBSMilk,6,Wed Mar 11 14:25:20 2015 UTC,"I was probably not as good as I am now at strategy games so that might be a reason for it but I was never able to finish the campaigns on either game. So now I get to experience it for the first time in the glorious new HD.   That being said I think that HW and HW2 originals had different pro's and cons. HW was just amazing for its time. HW2 brought it to a more modern light which I liked but I lost some of the things I loved. For example I remember thinking the same as yo do about Strike Craft as I do/did about frigates. I think the most common thing that Fleet Command said was ""Frigate Lost"".   I really like the fact that they have squadrons. Also... I dont remember hearing ""Interceptor Complete"" the first time I played it. It got rather annoying when I had to replenish 20 of them.  Personally, I dont care much for formations as far as strike craft. It doesnt make sense to send in a giant claw of ships at someone that cannot move very quickly. Their effectiveness is because of their speed, and that takes a lot of it away. But that would be if we had a better ballistic model that took things like ship speed, distance, and direction into account... One can dream  I do however want the evasive/aggressive/neutral tactics back. But only if they really do affect how easy they are to target/how much damage they do."

Prior to the HW2 patch, the original (1.0) version had no real cap on enemy fleet size, leading to freaking huge numbers of battlecruisers flying around. The patch (from back in 2003 or whatever) fixed that, which I assume carries over to the HW2R."

homeworld,2yog7j,devourerkwi,3,Wed Mar 11 15:46:50 2015 UTC,Yes just the original 1.0 game wasn't scaling correctly.   As I recall the game bases the enemy force off your number of carriers.

homeworld,2yog7j,Kiita-Ninetails,1 point,Thu Mar 12 15:45:20 2015 UTC,"Ehhhh, in HW1, the Taidan are collectively labeled as the bad guys - there's no real main antagonist. The emperor may command them, but even after he's killed, the Taidan continue to be dicks. And there's plenty of other folks around - it really felt like a journey.  On the other hand, HW2's big bad is constantly featured and after his death, the whole Vagyr fleet just disappears back into shitville. Also, the fleet's mission feels more like a short sojourn into your backyard rather than the migration of an entire species."
homeworld,2yog7j,SomeDuderr,7,Fri Mar 13 09:20:45 2015 UTC,"I think most of HW1's charm was due to the time period. The game itself was nothing like what we were used to playing in 1999. And the cutscenes then were either FMV or CGI, so the black and white scenes and the narration and lack of humanoid characters was all so very novel.  I read the manual after I blitzed through the campaign. So maybe it added to it.   But the storyline, the combination of the tribal and the technological, the unforgiving campaign, it made an impression on me. Plus the art style was not at all what I expected.   Homeworld 2, and even Homeworld Cataclysm, are very good games. Cataclysm went for a more conventional science fiction storyline and HW2 tried to grow from HW1 with some retcons that many feel weren't necessary.  Gameplay-wise, HW2 did a few things really well. But I do miss them formations."

They, however, secretly took their Core with them as they traveled to Kharak. This core was the core used as the heart of the Mothership.    This is in turn contradicted by both the HW1 manual and a cutscene in the game, where the core you are carrying is stated to be a replica of the one in Khar-Toba, making the revelation in Homeworld 2 a retcon."
homeworld,2yog7j,RaZorwireSC2,1 point,Thu Mar 12 09:27:33 2015 UTC,"It is possible both are accurate actually, it is possible the Kharakians could not get the actual core to integrate and/or fucntion with their mothership, and had to make a toned down copy.... I suppose."

homeworld,2yog7j,Kiita-Ninetails,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:26:41 2015 UTC,"As far as I'm aware, in one way the retcon actually strengthens the foundation of the HW1 plot. The Kushan basically only needed about 15 jumps to get from the outer edges of the galaxy to the galactic core, which could be construed as one of the reasons they were so successful against the Taiidan empire, being able to jump much longer stretches than the Taiidan fleets."
homeworld,2yog7j,Smugasaurus,2,Thu Mar 12 10:20:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah but in the very same game, it was stated that the Kushans were exiled using the crappiest ships using imperfect technology that would often spontaneously catch fire all by themselves... It seems kinda odd that there would be rare and powerful technology present in those clunkers meant to send war prisoners on a one way trip, especially when there a dozen kar-toba class ships.  I always had the impression that the reason why the taidan empire couldn't deal with the kushans wasn't due to anything special with their jump drives (they were supposed to be far behind on technology) but rather that the latter made a lot of efforts to stay hidden, take dangerous routes where the taidans didn't want to go, as well as terminating every hostile party that could potentially alert of their presence to the imperial fleets who were already dealing with their own civil war."
homeworld,2yog7j,fruitsdemers,2,Thu Mar 12 20:34:39 2015 UTC,"I think it can be both, but what you say is definitely true yes.  Longer jumps than normal combined with a weird and dangerous route (Kadesh, etc.) Also, remember that throughout the missions in HW1 there is a conscious effort to strike at certain targets and weak points (damaged fleet that attacked Kharak, Supernova Station).   I think the conceit is that the 'core' was smuggled aboard the actual Khar-Toba. How did the Kadeshi get hyperdrive when their original ship didn't have it, then? One stray trading vessel or patrol would be enough to reverse-engineer rudimentary hyperdrives. They never left the Garden anyway.   I agree it's all a bit weird, but there are many ways to fix the diacrepancies in one's head and I don't think any of them are really glaring."

We kinda thought Hiigara was actually their homeworld. Turns out, it's where they settled after Sajuuk scattered his fleet or whatever.  You'd think the Exiles would've taken some samples and realized that they aren't really home after all."
homeworld,2yog7j,marwynn,6,Wed Mar 11 17:43:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think very many people here actually hate HW2. It's just really difficult to live up to the legacy of HW1.  HW2 is a more refined game. The camera works better. Resource collectors are faster. Ships don't take forever to dock. There's automatic resource collection. Campaign missions are more chaotic, with constant attacks coming from multiple directions. It's almost as if the developers decided that they wanted to make a new game with all the nuances fixed. Unfortunately, the Kushan already reached their home world. You just can't come up with another equally epic story. I think that's why the HW2 story feels shoehorned. The developers made a game and then came up with a story to go with it whereas in HW1, the story and game probably came more hand-in-hand."

homeworld,2yog7j,Why485,3,Wed Mar 11 23:39:19 2015 UTC,I am an old-timer that played HW1 when it first came out and I somewhat agree. HW2 is a more mature game and I like the ship variety better. HW1 still has a certain nostalgic charm about it though. They are both great in their own way although I was a little disappointed in the HW1 remaster.
homeworld,2yog7j,quantumpion,2,Wed Mar 11 14:26:27 2015 UTC,"The consistency of the unit styling in Homeworld is still the best out there.

homeworld,2yog7j,Why485,3,Wed Mar 11 23:37:08 2015 UTC,"I only play games with good gameplay, but enjoy games mostly because of the degree of immersion. Graphics, sound and music play a huge role in that.  While HW2 was definitely less impressive in all of those areas (higher specs does not equate to a better looking game) - HW2's gameplay was always better.  As soon as you became good at capturing anything in HW1, that was the strategy. Showing up in the final mission with 200 ion cannon frigates to support your 20 destroyers - none of which you'd have to build yourself - the goal was simply to make your army bigger. Ultimately it was not a very challenging game. HW2 was balanced, scaled and had more diversity in the threats you'd face. Smaller ships stayed relevant for much further into the campaign, making battles more tactical too.  But yeah, HW1 was always the better overall experience and probably the one that made most of us fall in love with the series."

HW1's story is great, but for some reason, it just isn't the same. Maybe because I'm older and less amazed from the first time i played it, and maybe because the difficulty was much harder for my younger-self and thus I felt more rewarded, and therefore more involved.   HW2 is harder for me, especially the later missions where They throw more realistic fleet sizes at you. The final battle of HW1 remastered was a lot easier then i remember. I just sent everything i had forward and salvaged the guys going after my mother ship and the battle was over in a few minutes. The second to last battle in HW2 was pretty damn hard when you're up against 4 Battle cruisers and a dreadnaught...."
homeworld,2yog7j,RadioHitandRun,5,Wed Mar 11 15:00:32 2015 UTC,"HW2's story isn't terrible, but it's more gimmicky than HW1's. The stuff about ""prophecies"" and ""end times"" and ""chosen ones"" with Deus Ex Machina contraptions (Sajuuk, the Doomsday platforms, etc) is much more formulaic and predictable than HW1's ""find your way back home in a big universe"", especially after the shock of the destruction of Kharak. It also hasn't helped that a lot of the stuff wasn't really explained or anything, it just appears with no seeming relevance to the rest of the story.   It also hasn't helped that the whole ""scifi prophecy/chosen one"" thing has been done to absolute death in recent years, and often not done particularly well, making the story seem much less novel now than it did in 2003.   Another thing was that HW2 was much more centered around personalities than HW1 was. In HW1, S'jet wasn't this ""mother of the people"" character, the Taiidan Emperor wasn't a foe directly engaging and speaking with you like Makaan was (though Makaan's character was done raelly well), and the like. HW2 kinda half-heartedly tried to make it the story of Karen S'jet but without really getting into her, while still trying to maintain focus on the Hiigaran's as a whole, and kinda flubbed it a bit.   EDIT: HW2 also lacked the ""urgency"" of HW1. In HW1, your survival of not just your ""nation"" or ""culture"", but of the species itself was at stake, and there was nowhere to go back to. In HW2, there was not the same threat. Had the Hiigarans lost, they had an out, Makaan offered surrender terms they could take up, and the Hiigaran's had small outposts spread around such that the species itself was not at risk. The only real threat to this coming at the very end in the last mission (which, once you know what's going on and have some interceptor groups set up, is actually very easy)."

homeworld,2yog7j,SomeDuderr,4,Fri Mar 13 09:34:58 2015 UTC,"HW2's story felt a bit rushed - the doomsday weapons, the prophecy stuff going on, the galactic hyperspace gate network mentioned  briefly in the last cutscene... These were elements that had plenty of merit but were kinda just thrown in there without sufficiently exploring them or setting them up.  It has the same brilliant DNA but it feels like they didn't get the room to fully realise their vision (apparently they had a lot of problems in the development process and even scrapped a lot of their work at one point).  The gameplay difference isn't a question of making it worse for the most part (although I miss the green healing beams and a few other little touches that were iconic) - the issue with the remaster is that it's a mish-mash and that the original campaign was designed with the original mechanics in mind. I don't think the HW2 elements introduced are necessarily bad - I just think they weren't flawlessly implemented.  I think the balance and tempo of HW2 is unquestionably worse but that's 1 - a complication introduced with asymmetrical races and 2 - an apparent desire to make the game feel faster paced, which I'm not a fan of. But someone else might feel differently.  If there's a sequel I'd like to see them meet somewhere in the middle - custom formations, a wider array of strike craft options, less firepower that rewards strategy over rock/paper/scissors tactics to the same extent from the first game, and modular ships, further refinement of the UI and controls, the huge scope with playable super-ships, OP battlecruisers, Shipyards and so forth, from the 2nd game."

homeworld,2yog7j,helion83,2,Wed Mar 11 14:22:30 2015 UTC,"The HW1 story is good right up until about mission 3 or 4. Then it becomes rather generic until the last couple of missions. Yes they vary the gameplay, but the story just isn't very interesting.   I really just wish they'd shortened the game somehow and made it generally more forgiving in earlier missions and save the difficulty for later missions. In this day and age I think it is unacceptable to design a game where it's realistically possible to fail the third mission and have to start all over again. Just seems like bad QA work.   The story in Homeworld 2 is much more interesting to me, but I hate that they had to retcon one of the best things about the HW1 story to do it. The fact that hyperspace drives aren't special and that the Kushan's ingenuity let them reverse-engineer it was a big point in HW1 to me. It kind of sets up that they're a deserving people and not merely a chosen people. The fact that Karen S'jet more or less sacrifices herself to become Fleet Command show they're willing to make great sacrifices to achieve their goal of going home. Those types of things make you care about the 'people' in the game and make you invested in actually playing it.   The magic Hyperspace Cores also seemed to be at odds with the gameplay. Everybody is constantly hyperspacing all over the place, so how does that make any sense? Also, why would the Progenitors' greatest ship, a ship of legend, just happen to be about the same size/complexity as the Hiigaran Mothership? I could see it if it was maybe a forgotten relic of the Hiigarans themselves, but it's supposed to be a different race? What about those absolutely unbelievably huge ships in the background of the Karos Graveyard/Progenitor Foundry in HW2? Who built those? Wouldn't their battles make absolutely any beef between the Hiigarans and Vaygr seem trivial by comparison? Why not tell us their story? Hell, why have Sajuuk at all? They could have just cut out the middleman (the ship) and made another Macguffin that would have been the key to the Hyperspace Gate network. Or maybe they could make some kind of an allegory with the Ark of the Covenant. I dunno, I just didn't like the direction they took the story, and the fact that it felt like there were so many holes and/or missed opportunities.   Sorry I just think HW1 gets too much praise when really it's a U-shaped game with major high points at the beginning and end and a pretty mediocre story inbetween.  Homeworld 2 is better executed but made such a major retcon and went with such trite and overused tropes that it really left a bad taste in my mouth."

Yes they vary the gameplay, but the story just isn't very interesting.    Completely disagree, I thought the Kadesh missions (7 and 8) were among the highlights of the game. A menacing enemy unlike anything you've seen before, that turns out to be connected to your own people, which is a fact you learn AFTER you've fought them. One of the more memorable parts of the game for me, for sure.   While some of the other missions in the game were less story-heavy, I liked the feeling of exploring something completely unknown, and finding all this weird stuff in the galaxy. The first encounter with the Bentusi, finding the Ghost Ship, etc. Homeworld 2 touched on that a bit with your contact with the Progenitors, but I don't think it managed to convey the same feeling."
homeworld,2yog7j,RaZorwireSC2,2,Thu Mar 12 19:49:49 2015 UTC,"No. Formations & tactics are objectively better.  Hw2 is basically small groups in delta and that's it.  It lacks the many combinations of formations and tactics.  Balance is pants, with how broken Destroyers and BCs are. It's just a race to tech to them for the most part.  HW2 did have some improvements, though.  Subsystems were a GREAT addition.  And the way they gave bombers more of a roll was great.  I'm glad they gave HW1 ships engine subsystems. Actually wish there were a bit more than just that. It's a really great strategic system.  But uh, yeah. The design and balance outside of subsystems and the asymmetrical races is just worse.  And even though HW1 races were apparently so similar on paper, they were actually considerably different simply due to how the ships were laid out, and their turrets were, because of the realistic ballistics and such.  But yeah, if you put subsystems into HW1, and made the races more asymmetrical, I don't see any way that HW2 is better."

I'm going to go out on a limb and say this is exactly why you feel the way you do for two reasons.   Homeworld 1 Remastered plays very differently from the original, and not in a positive way. I'm sure you've read it everywhere by now, but HW1R does a very poor job of representing the original game in any way other than visuals. It's not just the formations, it's a lot of small changes that when put together dramatically affect the gameplay and feel of the entire experience. Due to various engine limitations, it has many very serious problems that didn't exist in the original. Meanwhile, Homeworld 2 plays a lot better than HW1R simply because Homeworld 2 was already a great game, and the only thing that changed was the graphics. The video game industry is in a very different place now than it was when Homeworld was released. There was simply nothing like it. Even though you could argue there's still nothing like it (I know I would), we now live in a world where Homeworld existed and influenced the industry, and some of the things it did are no longer as unique."

I'm not too crazy about Homeworld 2 Ship designs. They feel more generic.  But back on point; Homeworld 1's story was really amazing. If 2's story was an 8/10, 1's is a 10/10."

I never liked squads, C&C3 had unit squads and I way prefer individual units in C&C, same in homeworld. I also do not like the more ""hard counter"" balance HW2 seems to favor as much.  You can arrange fighters into small squads in HW1 and basically replicate how they are in HW2 anyway with delta formation, it even auto-selects all the ships in formation when you click one as if they are a squad.  But there's something extremely graceful about 2 massive formations attacking each other in HW1, seeing a massive claw shape attack a giant sphere with a space backdrop is really surreal and fills me with awe and wonder. Add on top of that the Z-drag repair that works properly and lets me not have to micro to effectively repair, and tactics, and homeworld 1 is more my preference.  To me, it's like Homeworld 1 is more like Total Annihilation and Homeworld 2 is like StarCraft. (which makes sense given Starcraft is RNG and TA has ballistics and physics - terrain effects projectiles)   I like both, but I prefer TA for some of the more dynamic encounters it ends up providing and how even slightly better positioning can shift a battle in your favor, which is akin to how proper use of formations and tactics could effect the outcome of battles in HW1.  That being said, I don't give a shit in HW1R about them putting in actual ballistics since it's already out, faking it within the RNG system would make me happy."

Within a few minutes the game has me caring about this totally alien race of people in a way no other game ever has. It's fine work. The art is dynamic, beautiful, and unique. The voice work is absolutely sublime. The original intro and first few missions still give me shivers. And if you read the backstory in the manual that Lanius linked, there really is a lot of awesome content here for a great story...  I don't personally believe a story like this needs good characters to work. Because the goal of good storytelling is to make you care about the difficulties, complexities, disagreements, resolutions, and outcomes of people. By creating a race that is so competent, hardy, self-sacrificing, rugged and determined... you can't help but cheer for them.   But at the end of the day, I feel the story is kind of U-shaped, with a phenomenal beginning and a very good end, but with very mediocre content in between. That's not to say there aren't good parts in there, but they're pretty widely interspersed... the rest just feels like filler, and the gameplay tends to be either way too easy or way too hard at all times."

homeworld,2ym8vd,BiznessCasual,12,Tue Mar 10 23:29:44 2015 UTC,"A community manager said before they're trying to ""evaluate the feasibility of making and implementing changes in future updates"", which likely means they have been granted pretty limited post-launch resources and are trying to figure out what they'd have to scrap (like MP balancing via number-tweaking) to make HW1 formations happening and whether it's worth it.  Between the initial announcements and the full release the features of the preview builds varied pretty wildly at times, so it's likely the game was at least to some degree rushed until the finish line and is working with pretty limited resources. Would make sense, Homeworld as a franchise has never been a big money maker, RTS isn't anymore either unless you've got the Blizzard brand, so from a publisher's perspective it would make sense not to risk too much for HWR.  But that's just my speculation, I don't actually know."

homeworld,2yp6uz,chuiu,2,Wed Mar 11 17:41:51 2015 UTC,At the moment the hope is that GB will just make the formations and strike craft behavior of the HW1 races behave like in the original way. That way the game stays in a interesting diversity and will hopefully bring balance to multiplayer. GB stated in several posts that they are aware of this and are looking into it. We have to wait and see.
homeworld,2yp6uz,possiblemaybe,3,Wed Mar 11 18:05:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm aware of that. But its not as simple as it sounds.  To do this they have to code in the differences into the HW2 engine and bug test it. That could take a considerable amount of effort and bug testing that they might not be willing to make.  We all hope they are. But in the event they won't do it then I feel like my solution would be the best result."
homeworld,2yp6uz,Achilleswar,0,Wed Mar 11 18:08:14 2015 UTC,"Hey if they can put HW1 into HW2 engine then I dont see this huge issue of coding in formations. If they say it wont ever be done then maybe this is the next step, but most likely they have a fine balance between making the game perfect and making money. I personally had no problem with the RM as is. This is probably the BEST remastered game in history. Nothing wrong with discussing it and what have you but really we should all be appreciative they did this at all."
homeworld,2yp6uz,Why485,3,Wed Mar 11 21:56:45 2015 UTC,"Except, they didn't ""put HW1 into HW2 engine."" What they did was essentially a glorified mod. About the only code that was actually ported was the .nis files for the cutscenes."

Please stop suggesting this, people.  They don't have to be the exact same as HW1 either, but just putting them in squads with HW2 behavior is unacceptable."
homeworld,2yp6uz,Why485,1 point,Wed Mar 11 19:17:59 2015 UTC,"Homeworld 2 style squadrons make a lot of sense considering the limitations and mechanics of the Homeworld 2 engine. I've argued in the past with you that unless Gearbox can actually fix this, and I have serious doubts they can considering the way the engine works, that adapting the HW2 squadron is the best solution.  Putting them in squadrons would create gameplay that even more closely resembles Homeworld 1 than spammy clusterfuck we have now. That ships built individually in HW1 wasn't really that important to the experience. What was important was the formations themselves, how the ships flew, and how they controlled.   Unfortunately, Homeworld 2's code makes individual ships impractical because it was designed from the ground up with the squadron system in mind. That squadron system replaced the HW1 individual build and manual formations and is a much closer approximation than the broken formations and individual units."
homeworld,2yp6uz,innociv,1 point,Thu Mar 12 00:04:34 2015 UTC,"There are no limitations and mechanics of the HW2 engines for GBX.  Only to modders.  So no, that's not an excuse. They need to fix it. That's not how programming works."
homeworld,2yp6uz,Why485,1 point,Thu Mar 12 16:49:19 2015 UTC,"As a programmer, I'll tell you that there are reasonable limits to what can be modified in a finished product. Yes, with enough time and money you can do anything, but Gearbox does not have unlimited time and money. Sometimes because of the way things are written, it becomes practically impossible to make certain changes without re-writing large swaths of the codebase because of how fundamental it was.  Making an engine level change can be as easy as swapping out bookshelves in a house, or as difficult as trying to change the foundation of a skyscraper without damaging everything above ground.  Is that necessarily the case for formations and squadrons? I honestly don't know. Only the guys who wrote it and Gearbox are privy to that information. What I'm saying is that it is very possible that making HW2 handle formations like HW1 did cannot be done with a reasonable amount of time or effort."
homeworld,2yp6uz,innociv,1 point,Thu Mar 12 17:02:33 2015 UTC,"As a programmer, I can tell you that this isn't a finished product and they hardly spent anything outside of graphics.  HW1 is just modded in like any other HW2 mod adds races.  It will take a few weeks, sure, since it needs to be programmed in such a way that it's replicated in multiplayer, but that's not long in the grand scheme of things."
homeworld,2yp6uz,TheGreatFez,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:37:46 2015 UTC,"Why would this not be acceptable? I want to get your input on this:  I think strike craft would be more useful in smaller squadrons that have focused fire instead of massive formations that are slower to make sweeping transitions. They are probably more effective against other strike craft as well since they can have 5/3 ships firing on each target.   I think this has aesthetic appeal, as well as tried and true actual military tactics of fighting in squadrons instead of giant formations.   HOWEVER: I do understand the annoyance of not getting the game we all loved with just updated graphics. It sucks but I think they will try and do some updates that will help this... I pray they get it right.  When you used formations back in the day, how many strike craft did you have in them? I painstakingly made them into smaller groups of 10-20 so they could be more maneuverable as a unit."
homeworld,2yp6uz,innociv,2,Wed Mar 11 22:23:26 2015 UTC,"Erm.. are you remotely aware of how HW1 squadrons worked?  You actually could control them, instead of AI.  They flew more like they were in space, instead of planes.  When you set to evasive strike craft would pair up, strafe around to avoid fire, and when one was attacked the other would do a cobra to attack what is attacking it.  I do think the sphere inflating/deflating was very exploity and shouldn't be reintroduced  but besides that the HW1 formations were just better in every way.  The Hw2 things is little more than an inferior delta, that's missing all the other formations and different tactics.  Switching formations in combat actually did things.  You could start with a claw, then after they sweep through their target and pass them, you could switch to sphere as they're turning to shoot from behind on slower turning targets.  This is how you beat defenders with scouts, for example.  It was just so much more tactical and strategic."
homeworld,2yp6uz,yeroc3103,1 point,Wed Mar 11 22:52:51 2015 UTC,"GB could have just done this to begin with. Instead they made modifications to HW2 to support formations. I think GB is going to fix it. If they weren't, then they could have already taken the easier way out by doing your solution."
homeworld,2yp6uz,Rogue100,1 point,Wed Mar 11 18:11:32 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried them, so I don't know how well they work, but there are mods for this in the steam workshop.  Squads for HW1R  Squads for HW1R (Taiidan version)  I personally hope for Gearbox to fix the formations and tactics though, rather than going this route. No need to further HW2ify HW1."
homeworld,2yp6uz,ViralHatred,1 point,Wed Mar 11 23:45:28 2015 UTC,They could instead just segregate Kushan/Taiidan from Hiigaran/Vaygr and that would allow them to balance much better and implement different features between them.  If they really insisted on keeping them together perhaps make it so squadrons have different formations (rather than trying to coordinate single units) converting the HW1 fighters into squadrons and then just give different formations different hit chances for different ships.  Like claw formation would be more likely to hit a target consistently but take damage from X things more and less from Z things.
homeworld,2yp6uz,ratamaq,-1,Sat Mar 14 18:39:44 2015 UTC,"Or how about we make HW2 fighters build individually? No? Why not? This is HW remastered, not HW2 remastered right?  I don't want my fighters built as squads. That's a HW2 thing. If I wanted that I would play the HW2 races. I will not compromise this or stop complaining about it until the people who have the source code, took my money for Honeworld (!=2) Remastered (!=remade) tell me it's not possible. I certainly won't be jumping on a bandwagon that gives them an easy way out.   As far as collectors go, first I believe you're  wrong about your conclusion that HW1 has the advantage. Feel free to read through a few controlled test I ran as a source to show the opposite here:  http://forums.relicnews.com/showthread.php?277541-Harvesting-test  However, for the sake of MP balance I would entertain the idea of giving all the same collector / refineries from HW2. And that is because I can't imagine a way that different resourcing types could ever be balanced. I also can't think of any other RTS that doesn't have all armies use an identical resourcing mechanic.   Sorry if I come off a little hostile in this response. But I think this attitude is toxic to a solution to the problem which ripped the soul out of Homeworld."
homeworld,2yp6uz,ratamaq,1 point,Wed Mar 11 18:21:05 2015 UTC,"You know I wouldn't be against making HW2 ships work that way either, as long as they officially fix formations and put in custom formation.   As far as collectors go, first I believe your wrong about your conclusion that HW1 has the advantage. Feel free to read through a few controlled test I ran as a source to show the opposite here:   I'm just going off personal experience here.  Whenever I face a computer AI playing as a HW1 race and I'm playing a HW2 race, they always get the resource objective before me.  Despite the fact I constantly build collectors at the start and start an away mining operation at another resource cluster."
homeworld,2yp6uz,eroticpastry,0,Wed Mar 11 18:29:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is why I did the test that I did. Resources collected != available resources. Read through those test. You have to account for additional RU spent on collectors, controllers, research for controllers. Time required for migration to other patches.   The point didn't as much show that one was better than the other, but that they are better at different times, which is why I don't think it will be possible to truly balance.   I was, however, impressed with how balanced they were. I expected it to be way different in favor of HW2. So in my opinion, either Gearbox got really lucky, or spent a lot of time calculating speed, harvest time, drop off animation etc."
homeworld,2yp6uz,Why485,1 point,Wed Mar 11 19:37:40 2015 UTC,I think they spent time balancing them if your tests are accurate.  The fact that HW2 resource collectors are more than twice as fast must account for a lot of that.

They have a number of patents on a really, really advanced camera system designed by a team of MIT PhD's or something.  How one would go about doing something like this in Homeworld? First Gearbox would need to make some sort of API for controlling a client. That or you could make some sort of bot to mimic manual human control.

I remember mission 4 being insanely difficult in the original version. You were up against many HMFs and the destroyer with only torpedo frigates. I assume they patched out the destroyer and HW2:R follows the 1.1 patch.

My ideal vision would be to see the fleet and mother ship being whittled down by an overwhelming enemy fleet in mission 1, this would force the mother ship to evacuate with damaged subsystems and whatever fleet you could salvage from the initial encounter.

homeworld,2yhmzu,StonedogTBSV,18,Mon Mar 9 22:01:50 2015 UTC,"I see your essay and raise you a novel!  Lot of doom-saying.  I'm nowhere near as down on HW:RM as it seems like a lot of folks are, particularly the HW1 faithful, of which I consider myself a member of, since HW1 has been the measuring stick by which all others were brought up against and subsequently fell short.  I'm not gonna tell people to ""shut up and be happy"" because I can't enforce that, nor would I want to.  I will, however, make a case for RM not being a pretty rape of the original:   Formations are cosmetic. They do nothing useful.   I agree.  This is probably the biggest problem at the moment.  The main problem with this criticism that I have is a lot of people are moaning and saying that it's the fault of the HW2 engine and that it can never be fixed; I have to disagree.  Point 1: The HW1 race defender.  Watch how it behaves while attacking.  The group doesn't fly all over God's nowhere armed only with its' hopes and dreams like the other HW1 race fighters do.  In fact, it doesn't fly around at all; it wobbles around in place while attacking, almost exactly like the classic defender did if set to evasive.  I think this proves that different strike craft can be set to behave differently regardless of what some people may say to the contrary.   Point 2: Kushan drone frigate.  The drones deploy in a perfect sphere around the frigate proper (sphere formation) and start ripping apart anything that comes in range.  If drones can do it, I would think it would stand that other ships can be set to do the same thing.  As a side note, classic drone frigates were absolute butt cheeks in the original; I'm a huge fan of them in RM.  You never heard people crying for the DF to get some love back in the day, do you?   The ships have all been rebalanced to be more like HW2 ships, except universally weaker.   Another problem, and one that  I would assume will be easily fixed in subsequent patches.  That's what the MP BETA is for.  No game in the history of games has ever been balanced at launch; expecting RM MP to be balanced out of the gate is very unrealistic.  Balance testing during development tends to take the back burner to making the actual game, and way more data can be collected in a much shorter window with a beta than could be done in-house.   In the first game, frigates and destroyers were quite solid. They could take a bit of punishment. It wasn't possible to one shot a frigate with a heavy cruiser. Destroyers were serious ships.   All of these ships are still very useful.  If your destroyers/HCs/BCs don't have frigate, vette, and fighter support, you will eventually get out-played.  Sure, assfrigs aren't the fat meat shields that they used to be, but they're also better offensively than they were in classic against vettes and other frigs.  I will agree that I think that HC/BC damage needs to be toned down a bit, along with destroyers to a lesser extent.  I do like the sped of gameplay of capital ship battle though, and it also forces players to be more careful with their ships.   heavy cruisers were something of a luxury in the first game that most games didn't include.   So, you're complaining about a ship that was, for the most part, completely frivolous in classic being made into a viable end-game unit that can and should be used as a valuable staple of every capital ship fleet?  I'm perfectly ok with HCs and BCs being utilized as they currently are, though, as I said before, they shouldn't be able to one-shot frigates.  Scale down their damage, but don't nerf them into oblivion so nobody ever uses them unless they're already beating their opponents so bad that they can't resist kicking them while their down.   In multiplayer, taking a HW1 race against HW2 enemies is a brave decision.   Maybe it is; tell that to the HW2 race-only teams I put face-first into the trash as Kushan this past weekend.  While I agree that there are a number of balance issues with HW1 races vs HW2 races (particularly regarding strike craft), playing as a HW1 race hardly makes the game unwinnable. The Kushan and Taiidan have their own unique gameplay advantages of the Hiigaran and Vaygr, some of which I will highlight later.  A lot of the balance criticism in this respect is being discussed in ""head-to-head"" terms, i.e., ion frigate vs. ion frigate, which, excepting this example, is not the correct way to view these sorts of balance issues.  I would ideally like to see the game's meta to be based off of asymmetric balancing.  Let's instead evaluate each faction's ships in how well they fill their roles and counters vs the other factions, i.e., anti-fighter units vs fighters; anti-capital vs capital.  Even this doesn't need to be perfectly analogous; one race can be more effective against strike craft but have a somewhat harder time dealing with frigates than another race, and so on.  As long as each race has viable counters to stuff, I'm happy.  In this regard, I'll argue that while the HW1 races have drawn the short stick in the strike craft area, they have better counters to strike craft, particularly the Kushan because of their drone frigates.  Defenders, multi-gun corvettes, missile destroyers, and drone frigates all rip through strike craft like warm butter.   The mechanics of the way you build in HW 1 mean you're going to struggle to keep up.   I'm gonna have to disagree with you here.  Those two build queues per construction ship are huge, especially during mid-game, while the HW2 races are trying to build up the infrastructure to pump out all those destroyers and BCs we're all so afraid of.  While my enemies are busy bringing in other carriers and shipyards, I'm busy pumping out bombers, frigates, destroyers, and my own swinging-dick HCs.  These ships that I'm building aren't being built just because they look pretty; I'm sending fleets at players who are upgrading their future production capacity at the expense of their present fleet capability.  Moreover, those multiple build queues are constantly being utilized, so if they do manage to get the upper hand on the fleet I'm hitting them with, I can hit them again immediately before they've had a chance to recover.  I also use my early production advantage to gain map control, which both provides me with the precious shekels to constantly build shit and deprives  the enemy of that very same thing.  One of the games I played this weekend was against 2 Vaygr and 1 Hiigaran (both of my allies were Hiigaran, I was Kushan).  I looked at the end game summary and saw that I had built the most ships by far (though I do think this was boosted by drone frigates since I think each drone counts as a ship built) as well as destroyed the second most enemy ships; 1st place went to one of my allies by a slim margin.  The Hiigaran enemy had 5 manufacturing-capable ships during the course of the game; one of the Vaygr had 7, and the other Vaygr had 11.  You know how many I had? 2.  I didn't even build another fucking carrier.  I didn't need it.  I was out-producing and out-killing everybody else, and once I gained my advantage, I wasn't gonna let it go.  Sure, maybe the HW2 races can get to a point where they can out-produce the shit out of HW1 races, at least with regards to capital ships, but I think the best way to deal with that is to use your early-game advantage to prevent them from even getting to that point.  Another HW1 race advantage that you completely missed was a big one: early game hyperspace capability.  No hyperspace research; no building hyperspace modules; just immediate hyperspacing for everything larger than a corvette, provided you have the resources.  Play around with this a little bit and you'll see what I'm talking about.  Does HW:RM have issues?  Oh yeah.  Some of them are even pretty big and need to be dealt with quickly.  But you know what?  It's not as broken as everybody seems to think, and it's still an incredible game that has the beating heart of the classics within it's chest.  This game has the potential to provide an asymmetricly balanced gaming experience that has never been done before.  I'm not moping and looking at what was; I'm giddy with anticipation and looking at will hopefully come to be."

They have to describe it that way as they decided to go the easy way and to remaster only one engine.  So, their word can't be taken seriously here. On the other side, the community was well able to port HW1 to many platforms (e.g. linux, Android, pandora, x64) which speaks again the theory that the code  is ""a mess"". Also, take a look yourself.  PS: also HW cataclysm is a proof that the HW1 engine was a useable base for interesting extensions"

Infact, mechanical wise she is more advanced then the HW2 engine. Also, she is better integrated in the game itself therefore leading to less overhead and is not limited by the pigeon hole of a ""modding api""/engine API.)"

homeworld,2yigg3,dos4g,5,Tue Mar 10 01:52:50 2015 UTC,"Meta isn't developed. And you shouldn't bother developing it right now, it's still a beta. All value's (HP, speed, DMG, etc...) are still subject to change, just try to have fun playing it. Instead, focus on perfecting your build order, positioning and especially execution of your game plan."
homeworld,2yigg3,Hubbleshubbles,1 point,Tue Mar 10 08:29:43 2015 UTC,"I thought perfecting build orders, positioning and game plans were all a part of 'developing the meta'. Personally I think there are better/safer builds than a direct rush to Destroyers.   Double Fighter Rush, Frigate Hyperspace Rushes, and Platform rushes all seem capable of beating  a standard Destroyer Rush, and seem to have better game against 'random' boom builds.  Any econ/boom build variant is probably going to result in a kill via Destroyers, since they so badly trump frigates, can rapidly kill a carrier/mothership, and come out significantly faster than Battlecruisers."
homeworld,2yigg3,Gifted_SiRe,1 point,Wed Mar 11 19:35:25 2015 UTC,"Things aren't drastically changed from HW2, outside of some bugs that make some weapons do double damage.  Destroyers are simply 5.66% the HP and 3x the DPS of frigates for only 2.5x the cost. they're effected by that same bug bug, I believe, making the cannons do double damage to at least frigates so it's even more. It's plain stupid not to go them. Their only counter is marine frigs and BCs.  Though rushing straight to them, I don't know.  You can lose before you get them if you don't go double fighter or torp frigates first."
homeworld,2yigg3,innociv,6,Thu Mar 12 19:42:51 2015 UTC,"Probably a HWR thing. They're economical, ruin Frigates, and are fairly difficult to stop... if you're not Vaygr. By the time a rushed destroyer comes out a Vaygr should have Laser Corvettes, and a destroyer with light fighter escorts at most is going to die against LasCors.   Frigates don't have their HW1 strength levels, and I didn't play much of HW2 so I can't comment on their resilience there."
homeworld,2yigg3,marwynn,2,Tue Mar 10 01:55:57 2015 UTC,"It was basically the same situation in classic HW2, the destroyers ate the frigates for breakfast (especially if you compare the costs of them once you've got to producing Destroyers, which don't really need that much research)."
homeworld,2yigg3,METROID4,4,Tue Mar 10 18:15:22 2015 UTC,"Marine frigates are extremely good against destroyers. Fighters cannot kill them fast enough to prevent the capture of pretty much anything. The controller of the destroyer will either have to scuttle it or let you capture it, either is a win for you. If you see someone rush destroyers, get some marine frigates."
homeworld,2yigg3,Nyke,3,Tue Mar 10 11:37:37 2015 UTC,Marine frigates often get lost in the mess of large engagements too.
homeworld,2yigg3,ChipAyten,2,Tue Mar 10 14:59:42 2015 UTC,"To be fair, I played a 3v3 and the other team (2 Vaygr/1 Higgy) rushed destroyers, and when they tried to use them to secure the resources in the middle of the map, I crushed their panties with a nicely mixed fleet of bombers, drone (I was Kushan)/ion/assfrigs, and my own destroyer that came late to the party. It was the death knell for the other team since I secured those resources, defeated the majority of two of the player's fleets, and started pumping out HCs like cray.  They're tough, but they can be brought down in that mid-game phase, so long as there aren't a lot of them."
homeworld,2yigg3,BiznessCasual,2,Tue Mar 10 03:21:01 2015 UTC,"Lots of 1v1 games end before the first Destroyer. Many 1v1 games end up seeing Battlecruisers too. This game has a lot of diversity in Tech-level focus. I'm gonna be writing up a guide to the Cloaked Frigate Hyperspace rush soon if you want an example.   To answer your question though, Destroyers are a great cost/value ratio that are pretty accessible and very capable of countering carrier-, corvette-, or frigate-based pressure."
homeworld,2yigg3,Gifted_SiRe,1 point,Tue Mar 10 05:18:14 2015 UTC,Why write a guide in the beta? If they are sitting back for larger scale data before pushing the balance updates would it not be more worth while to hold off until patch 1 and patch 2 or until the game exits the beta state?
homeworld,2yigg3,jus7addwater,2,Tue Mar 10 06:58:31 2015 UTC,What I dont like about HWR is that there is no viable fighter and vette only strategy like there was in the originals. To win you have to have at least a few capital ships

homeworld,2yggqq,SpaceNinjaBear,9,Mon Mar 9 20:02:30 2015 UTC,"I figured they just captured and interrogated/killed the enemy crew. As for where the new crews come from, I assume they're from the cryotrays. They wake up a certain number of people, slap a uniform on them and say, ""Congratulations! You're the new captain of this, uh, heavy cruiser we just captured... Don't scratch the new paint on the way out.""  ""But this is an alien ship! And I'm just an accountant! How do I--""  ""We got the former captain to tell us how to put it in drive and found some instructions in the glove box. Hope you're a speed reader, captain."""
homeworld,2yggqq,RDBRULZ,3,Mon Mar 9 22:08:58 2015 UTC,"The crews are clearly still active as they are being salvaged so I doubt that they are being gassed or anything by the salvage corvettes. I always assumed that either the majority of the ships systems were taken over during the capturing and airlocks were opened or that the mothership has some way of wiping out the whole crew as it gets drawn into the bay.  Maybe a burst of radiation or something.  As for where the crews come from, there are a lot of people in those cryopods.  This is brought up in HW Catacylsm, when the Somtaaw need pilots for the kamikaze mimics they unthaw survivors from the original kharak disaster, let them know their families and most of their race are dead and set them to it."

homeworld,2yggqq,forthelose,2,Mon Mar 9 21:30:20 2015 UTC,It's not quite that bad... the Mimic crews are drawn from those that found out they are the last survivors of their families and have developed suicidal tendencies as a result. So only .5 kilonazis instead of like .8.

No buffs or ingame unlocks that would change the gameplay, of course.  I hate games that do that.  I want to compete, not die constantly until I unlock X skill tree or Y weapon.  Right now multiplayer feels like it's just a LAN party over the internet.  No sense of progression or reason to go against other players.  Never thought I'd say this, but it would be interesting to have League-style progression, where the more matches you win the higher you'd climb in the ranks until you're on eSport level competition.

I also would love to see a pre-built fleet game type with no production capable ships.  I do think it would have to be setup so you lose once all your capital ships are donions like funions, otherwise you'd have some people being total dicks by sending scouts to every corner of the map to avoid losing.

homeworld,2ygayp,MeepZero,2,Mon Mar 9 19:26:29 2015 UTC,"One of the best things they could do would be to implement a method to automatically download and install a necessary mod in order to play, rather than just saying the game is incompatible. This would be something like the ability to download custom maps from the heyday of SC and WC3. It would also be useful for growing the popularity of various multiplayer mods.  Additionally, I very much like the levelling up and leaderboard ideas, a la Starcraft. Additionally, if they could find a reasonable way to determine the quality of your gameplay based on various factors in a more quantitative way, that would be awesome. Spending Quotient (SQ) from Starcraft would be a good metric (it is roughly a logarithmic ratio of income rate to average unspent resources, or a measure of how quickly you spend and scale up your income).  Another interesting statistic could be proportion of enemy ships destroyed as a ratio of proportion of your ships destroyed. Say you built 50 ships and lost 40, but your enemy build 100 and lost 90. Your enemy lost 90% of their ships, but you only lost 80%. Therefore you were 90/80 = 112.5% as efficient (12.5% more efficient than your opponent). Capturing this metric would require they change the way games end (surrendering currently causes all your ships to scuttle).   Basically more metrics by which to determine player skill/efficiency at various aspects of gameplay, rather than just a pure leaderboard or even SC/LoL style 'League' system would be cool. I miss the days of only being vaguely aware of a player's 'skill' and trying to describe how two players could be very very good but have entirely different playstyles dominated by different influential ideas.   Ironically systems like what League and Starcraft use only seem to further obfuscate the elements of playskill that are important, rather than illuminating them for players."

Win rates are obviously going to be derived from a number of other factors (Game Knowledge, Micro, Scouting/Reading Skill, Army Positioning, Weakness Detection, APM, Build Order Knowledge, Build Execution, Harassment/Econ focus, etc.)   I just wish there were more tools/metrics to drill down in each of those areas so you could know 'objectively' if you are improving in each of those areas."

The discoveries do unite the people, but there is still a bit of conflict before that happens. The Hyperspace Module is reverse-engineered, but not all of the technology of the core of the module is understood.

I actually like this explanation. It seems to be the best compromise between the information given in HW1 and HW2."

homeworld,2yg6e6,Demosthenes01101,4,Mon Mar 9 15:27:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah I noticed this as well.  HW1:R Heavy Cruisers absolutely, utterly annihilate healthy destroyers in two (almost one) volleys of ion fire. Destroyers seem to do the same to frigates. This usually makes battle repairs pretty futile, as by the time you could react to something being damaged, it would already be in the red after one volley.  Maybe nostalgia is getting the best of me, but I don't remember it being the case that capital ship HP was so weak (except when something was being hit by a multibeam frigate).  This also seems to have the effect of making overwhelming numbers that much more important, as every battle with a supercapital, you can expect to lose decent numbers of ships to sheer attrition. The only way to lose less is to overload massive amounts of damage on target to prevent the enemy from getting more than one cycle of damage out. Repairs won't cut it, bombers and strike craft do the job too slowly, you just need more laser beams.  I just don't remember everything being so unbelievably fragile. Capital ship battles seem to resolve themselves so quickly."
homeworld,2yg6e6,AzurewynD,6,Mon Mar 9 19:24:47 2015 UTC,"As some other people have mentioned in this sub, HW1:R uses HW2's balance on frigates:destroyers:battlecruisers where the firepower and armor of each class of ship rises exponentially. IMHO, it's a stupid system that was precisely part of the reason HW2 was so disappointing in the first place. Here's hoping that HW1:R is changed back (at least the campaign) or that modders can step in and fix it, like this guy is doing."
homeworld,2yg6e6,Narwhal_Jesus,3,Mon Mar 9 23:18:26 2015 UTC,"It really is a poor system because it means that bigger is better, with the exception of the bombers and avoidance fighters. They really need to take a look at the HW1 ship stats and try to glean some useful information, even if it's only for the HW1 ships.  The balance of the Tech tree model for Homeworld 1 races falls apart altogether when a Heavy Cruiser can annihilate 8+ frigates on its own."
homeworld,2yg6e6,Foreverclear82,1 point,Tue Mar 10 07:10:42 2015 UTC,"It seems weird. Basically by the time I had Destroyers in HW1:R, I stopped worrying about acquiring frigates as they were fragile. Same thing happened once I got a few Heavy Cruisers, as they would melt destroyers in no time.   This somewhat confuses me, because it seems like even if you had like 2x the resource cost of an HC worth of Ion Frigates attacking an HC, the HC would still win."
homeworld,2yg6e6,Valvador,3,Mon Mar 9 21:38:26 2015 UTC,"You're completely correct. It took a heavy cruiser a few volleys before it was able to kill a frigate. Not 'Omg, I has two ion turrets, therefore I can kill 2 ion cannon frigates every time I fire.'"
homeworld,2yg6e6,StonedogTBSV,3,Mon Mar 9 22:12:34 2015 UTC,"In the last mission I took on 40! frigates with two Heavy Cruisers and wiped all of them out easily. Once you research Cruisers every mission becomes:  1) Sent Heavy Cruisers to the objective. 2) Win.  There's no time to utilize tactics any more. Remember how ships are less heavily armored on the top and bottom? In HW1:R capital ships pop so fast every fight is just a slug fest and there's no use trying to co-ordinate your forces to go after the enemy's weak spots.  There are no interesting counters for the overpowered Cruiser. Catching one un-escorted should be bomber fodder, but it's not. They make the game more boring."
homeworld,2yg6e6,Velocirapacious,2,Mon Mar 9 23:19:10 2015 UTC,Anyone else get a big surprise in the final HW1:R  mission with the Taiidan Heavy Cruiser & group that comes from the front being able to kill the mothership in basically a single volley?  That really illustrated the HC issue to me.
homeworld,2yg6e6,Molonious,1 point,Thu Mar 12 06:06:35 2015 UTC,"I would argue that the MP isn't 'balanced' at all, so buffing up HW ships against their opponents could only be an improvement, and it would make the campaign considerably less tedious."
homeworld,2yg6e6,sk_2013,4,Mon Mar 9 15:32:23 2015 UTC,"Well, I think I'm actually talking about a nerf. The Heavy Cruiser does WAY too much damage in the campaign, for one. It's the only one I noticed.  The rest of the imba for HW1 in MP is probably because of the ships not playing nice with the HW2 engine. That's a harder fix."
homeworld,2yg6e6,RDBRULZ,1 point,Mon Mar 9 15:33:44 2015 UTC,"Many of the damage values, movement speeds and armor ratings are basically copied and pasted out of HW2 into HW1 and that is why everything seems off.  Battlecruisers in HW2 were very powerful compared to their HW1 counterparts.  I believe someone else on here has been working on a balance mod for at least the campaign. Hopefully someone builds an all encompassing mod to balance all the races in multiplayer as well so we can get some decent big multiplayer battles instead of these quick half hour slaughters."
homeworld,2yg6e6,RDBRULZ,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:02:04 2015 UTC,"Right, it seems like they've gone with the D3 theory of balance: make everything a glass cannon.  Well, not sure about that! The problem is when there is too much damage for healing to compensate, it removes strategic choice.  On the other if you make one unit do that much damage, but have it come with drawbacks, it becomes a strategic choice, and it offers the other player more depth in terms of countering that unit, etc.  BCs/HCs one shotting frigates is just lame to me."
homeworld,2yg6e6,RDBRULZ,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:11:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, one of the big balance changes between the two were that HW1 Battlecruisers were extremely ineffective against fighters and corvettes.  HW2 battlecruisers not only have close in beam weapons for fighters and corvettes but also have docking bays for supporting their own and upgrade modules for expanding functionality."
homeworld,2yg6e6,Velocirapacious,3,Mon Mar 9 20:14:50 2015 UTC,"Right, it violates the cardinal rule of RTS, no all-purpose units that aren't a 75% handicap from the specialist unit. Though, the 2 limit puts a hamper on that, I guess.  I also don't remember assault frigates being 'good' against strike craft in the classic, did I miss that?

homeworld,2yh4eh,Wendon,4,Mon Mar 9 19:46:49 2015 UTC,"I was in a similar position to yours, played hw2 (+mods) but never touched the original. One big thing is using salvage corvettes. Whenever you see the enemy using big capital ships, make it your priority to grab them. Or any other ships really but yeah, they help alot.  I also found I was using support corvettes and frigates for healing far more than I used the resource collectors in hw2. They help a lot and I've transferred that thought process into my hw2 gameplay.  It is based on the hw2 engine so you'll find yourself at home even if it might feel weird just having single units for strike craft and corvettes :P   Take it slow and easy, enjoy it."
homeworld,2yh4eh,Quietly-Confident,3,Mon Mar 9 19:53:45 2015 UTC,"About the salvage corvettes: You can probably tell from browsing this sub that salvage corvettes make the game very easy. You can capture pretty much every enemy ship and end up with a huge fleet that will steam roll through everything. It's your choice on how far you want to take it. The game is challenging, but beatable without capturing. Personally, I just captured when I saw a good opportunity but blew up most enemy ships I encountered (because killing stuff is fun).  Also, I feel that HW1 is less forgiving than HW2, which is already pretty unforgiving compared to most games. Don't be too surprised if you get stuck and have to backtrack a bit. But if you're a veteran of HW2, you should be just fine =)"

I barely used salvage corvettes in my playthrough, really just using them to neutralize the HCs (fairly late in the campaign). The HW1 campaign was still a cakewalk, all around, compare to the classic version, for various reasons.  Kadesh was just a miserable disappointment."
homeworld,2yh4eh,Demosthenes01101,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:14:28 2015 UTC,"HW2 the damage scaled a lot heavier as you went up in ship classes. Once you got to battlecruisers everything just melted.

homeworld,2yh4eh,sumelar,1 point,Mon Mar 9 21:57:57 2015 UTC,"Note on salvage corvettes: I am not saying it's wrong to use them in mass, but it is a different game from using them sparingly and relying mostly on keeping your units alive."

homeworld,2yh4eh,Demosthenes01101,2,Mon Mar 9 20:13:03 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that strike craft use fuel, and will need to dock to fill up the tank fairly frequently. It's usually helpful to divide them into several control groups, so that you can dock a few of them at a time while the rest keep on fighting. Support frigates are as useful as refueling stations as they are for repairing capital ships.  Formations matter more in classic, especially for strike craft. Sphere is super-useful for protecting a friendly ship, Claw is really good for bombing runs, X is all-round in a dogfight, etc. Tactics also actually change the balance between firepower and manueverability (aggressive means more damage but slower, and evasive means the opposite), so learning to switch between them is really helpful.  Good luck and have fun. :)"
homeworld,2yh4eh,RaZorwireSC2,2,Mon Mar 9 20:46:22 2015 UTC,"The single best thing you can do to maximise your enjoyment of HW1 is to play the classic version and leave the pitifully poorly implemented pretend version of it you got in Remastered alone.   HW remastered is HW2 with pretty graphics and more ships. It is a very good remaster of HW2, but so much of what made HW 1 great isn't there.  Formations are useless, fuel is missing, tactics settings are pointless.   Play the original that they helpfully bundled with your game."
homeworld,2yh4eh,StonedogTBSV,1 point,Mon Mar 9 21:27:38 2015 UTC,"Tactics settings still work. If you set everything to aggressive all the time, you'll never salvage anything because it will get destroyed before you get the chance. And formations are only broken for strike craft.  Also good riddance to fuel. Cataclysm was completely right to get rid of it."

You're right in that Homeworld does it as well, but nowhere near to the extent of, say, Call of Duty to use the other extreme.  Taking this mission as an example, it presents it as an environmental problem to be solved, and leaves the solution up to you. You might use carriers, use the OP's solution, or something else entirely.   That's what I miss, the game presenting a problem that can be solved within its mechanics without then spelling out 'you should use some carriers, here have an objective heads up to load 5 harvesters into a carrier, and a repeated voice over telling you to do it.' It leaves the player some agency in whether and even how to approach the problem, even if its illusionary for the most part."

Just shoot the rocks one at a time, group attack the smaller pieces after the rocks break up so you don't have to manually attack each one. Any healing vessels on the mothership for those that get through.  Ion frigates are the key I found. Very powerful as a group."

homeworld,2ya7yi,Wilwheatonfan87,1 point,Sun Mar 8 00:41:16 2015 UTC,I actually can confirm there are a few bugs. It was sort of around the introduction to sensors when trying to leave in that it wouldn't register your actions.  very same thing a few lessons later on where again it wouldn't register your action of holding alt-left click-pan to place focus on a group of enemies or when selecting a group.

homeworld,2ybi6i,el_f3n1x187,9,Sun Mar 8 07:20:37 2015 UTC,"The last mission has some severe issues in my experience. That's just one of them.  The pacing/scripting for one, is completely off.   There's far too much time in between waves during the first part of the mission, and the waves spawn way too far away from the Mothership. The tension I remember from the original HW1 was completely absent.   By the time they close in, their frigates end up leaving the heavy cruisers far behind and their forces limbo-line one by one into your capital wall. Then 10 minutes pass before another wave does the same thing.   I actually had to go out get the final wave of ships that attacks you because waiting for them to slowboat to the Mothership would've taken way too long from where they spawn. Then Elson's crew shows up to the sound of Fleet Intelligence saying ""We're being overwhelmed!"" with absolutely no enemies on grid.  And this is with a pretty modest fleet (compared to what I see some people having in these screenshots), not salvaging any of the ion cannon sphere and getting a substantial chunk of my frigates decimated by the Rockship in the previous mission. Something on the order of 12-15 frigates, max destroyers and 3 heavy cruisers going in.  Then you spend close to 20 minutes ordering your fleet across a map that's quite frankly, way too fucking big and filled with absolutely nothing except the enemy mothership on the far side.  Then once you get there, you end up having exactly what you experienced: the asteroid field screws up the pathing on your units, so if you give attack orders to target the Heavy Cruisers on the other side, your ships will actually face away from their targets in confusion and get chewed up.  Best thing to do really is to send them above or below the plane, then have them fly over or under before attacking. It's pretty obnoxious.  I streamed the final mission for a friend and it was pretty anticlimactic compared to the mission I remember that actually had a footnote in the strategy guide for how to reduce framerate chugging due to to the fact that it sent so many units at you in such a short period of time."

I don't mean to speak for everybody on this forum, but the impression I've always gotten is that while HW2 is enjoyable, it had a plot that felt shoehorned in at times, and it lost the majesty of the original story.  Call it the curse of the sequel, but it was a retread.  A great retread, but a retread nonetheless.  HW1 has the story, more memorable/iconic units, more sophisticated combat...it's a sublime experience.  My guess is that veterans are playing through the HW1 campaign first, not because one comes before two, but because it was the game that first broke ground, set the precedent, and make an enormous emotional impact on the gaming collective."
homeworld,2ybae6,chordial,3,Sun Mar 8 06:00:22 2015 UTC,"more sophisticated combat   Yes, very true, a significant more advanced engine than the HW2 engine. A pity that GBX shoehorned HW1 into the inferior HW2 engine instead of graphical updating the HW1 engine. :/"
homeworld,2ybae6,gondur,2,Sun Mar 8 20:42:44 2015 UTC,"I think it would have been best if they put the game logic of HW1 into a shared library, and game logic of HW2 into a different shared library. Then took what was left of HW2 and made it ambidextrous and able to use both. Most likely with a standard API for the game logic."
homeworld,2ybae6,discoloda,2,Mon Mar 9 16:45:10 2015 UTC,What about Cataclysm? I am playing through the (original) HW1 again and was wondering whether I should give Cataclysm and HW2 a chance. I do not really want to ruin the good feeling I have of HW1 with a shoddy story.
homeworld,2ybae6,WhatABiscuit,4,Sun Mar 8 11:40:27 2015 UTC,"You will not ruin anything, you have the wrong impression.  If you like Homeworld you should definitely play both HW2 and Cataclysm. They are both really really good games, its just a shame that Cataclysm didn't get the remastered version."
homeworld,2ybae6,mordemckee,1 point,Sun Mar 8 12:10:39 2015 UTC,From what I've heard the Cataclysm source was lost so they'd pretty much have to recreate it from scratch.
homeworld,2ybae6,Arydus,5,Wed Apr 8 23:27:45 2015 UTC,"Cataclysm is actually my favorite. I cannot recommend it highly enough. It had an awesome fleet, a killer story which was risky to tell in an RTS game but works perfectly, and it has the best multilayer maps.  Multiplayer in Cataclysm included wormholes of different sizes so you could shuttle you larger ships around the map, which gave the maps a sense of topography and layout, instead of just empty space. It was also very creative at using resource placement to create maps that felt unique from one another and offered different experiences.  Cannot recommend Cataclysm enough."
homeworld,2ybae6,chordial,3,Sun Mar 8 14:35:34 2015 UTC,"IMO, Cataclysm's story was still top-notch sci-fi. Design-wise I think the campaign was also better -- a lot of the missions were more ""active"" and faster paced than HW1's. It's a very different atmosphere but if you enjoy a slightly more brisk pace it's well worth the playthrough."
homeworld,2ybae6,Gopherlad,2,Sun Mar 8 22:55:03 2015 UTC,"Just completed Homeworld 1&2 Remastered, while 1 is amazing when it comes to story line, I still feel 2 has the most amazing battles. I felt that back in 2003 when it first came out, and I still feel that with the remastered editions as well. Still, as you said, HW1 brings back all the feels. :)"
homeworld,2ybae6,DJ3XO,2,Mon Mar 9 09:51:47 2015 UTC,I'd only played Hw2 before this came out. After playing Hw1 I definitely think 1 is more interesting and impactful than 2. Though I still prefer the ship designs in 2.
homeworld,2ybae6,WolfintheShadows,6,Mon Mar 9 13:40:21 2015 UTC,"I played both games and for me Homeworld 2 was the better game. I think the reason the first is so revered is simply because it is a hallmark in strategy gaming. The second improves upon it in many ways, but it is impossible to have the impact of the first game since the first game exists.  Think Starcraft and Starcraft 2. While SC2 was extremely successful and has had a vibrant life in the competitive scene, it will never match up to the original in terms of cultural impact simply because it wasn't the first."
homeworld,2ybae6,Nyke,3,Sun Mar 8 10:06:02 2015 UTC,I like a ton of the gameplay elements in hw2. But how do you top your civilization returning home after millennia?
homeworld,2ybae6,ryanman,2,Sun Mar 8 23:07:17 2015 UTC,Yeah agreed although HW1 is much of a cinematic experience overall gameplay in HW2 is better.
homeworld,2ybae6,red_ones_go_faster,4,Sun Mar 8 23:05:38 2015 UTC,"I never played either back in the heyday, for what it's worth, and not sure how much of this is due to changes in the remastered versions. But I'm currently about halfway through HW2 and finding it a lot more enjoyable. Probably about 90% because of the lack of salvage corvettes - I don't know if it's the same in the original version, but my big powerful fleet seemed to mostly just be there to soak up some hits and mop up a few leftovers while the salvage corvettes stole the enemy fleet without a fight, and that really spoiled the game for me.  HW2 actually feels like a game of space battles instead. Having the smaller ships in wings seems to make them much more useful - so that variety is nice too. And the missions so far feel a lot more intense, constantly fending off waves of enemies and having to work out when and how to break up the fleet to strike out for objectives. And no godawful asteroid mission (yet)! The story can't compete with the first one, but otherwise HW2 seems much more fun as a game."
homeworld,2ybae6,Ditchdragon,1 point,Sun Mar 8 12:17:46 2015 UTC,"Played HW1 back in the day.  Just bought remastered, played through HW1, and now starting HW2.  I'm only a few missions in and I find the pacing to be a barrier.  HW2 is well done, I appreciate the effort the DEV team went into making it.  The (storymode) battles just don't flow.  The battles are over punctuated with mission event updates and cinema scenes like an AP English student who just discovered the semicolon.   I know what the dev team was trying to do.  Keep things fresh, keep players on their toes.  But it's time and time again.  ""Enemy carrier has just jumped out of hyper-space"", ""Receiving a distress signal from the Waffle House"", ""Randy in accounting's pen just ran out of ink so he as to go get a new one"".    Maybe seamless and silent game play is for multi-player mode.  Perhaps Storymode should parallel the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune as seen in real life.  But I have to go outside and do that everyday."
homeworld,2ybae6,actuallyserious650,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:17:58 2015 UTC,"HW1 was revolutionary and had the best story.  HW2 imho actually refined the gameplay and added some real depth (like subsystem targeting, and unit upgrade research).  But it ultimately wasn't different enough from HW1 and their story had the classic sequel problem of having to come up with a bigger more important story than the first.  Today, with the two games side by side for a new audience, HW2 is actually the better game."
homeworld,2ybae6,Gopherlad,4,Sun Mar 8 13:43:18 2015 UTC,"Today, with the two games side by side for a new audience, HW2 is actually the better game.   Mmm I still disagree. As far as usability and intuitiveness goes, HW2 is vastly superior but mechanically they traded a lot of depth for breadth. We lost a few degrees of control when they put fighters into squads and implemented RNG-based damage and dogfighting AI. Also I'm still not sure if the ""Enemy ships are weaker from the sides and rear"" thing still applies in HW2 anymore. Everything dies so fast that it's hard to gauge, and good luck making your strike craft aim at specific parts of enemy armor to test it.   I wouldn't say either HW2 or 1 is better, just that they had different design goals in mind."
homeworld,2ybae6,Japface,4,Sun Mar 8 23:00:05 2015 UTC,homeworld 1 was in a league of its own. homeworld 2 was just an okay game. the story and pacing especially suffered due to its rushed development after it was restarted.

Then there's the fact that, at the end of the day, (my opinion) Homeworld 1 was just far better than 2, with the only big problem being the visuals. That's not to say that HW:R is perfect, there's new issues from the not-perfect remastering (formations not working the same way, etc)."

homeworld,2yaxen,DoktorvonWer,5,Sun Mar 8 04:10:13 2015 UTC,I don't think there's actually any meaningful difference in distances except what the engine calls them... It's all a totally arbitrary in-game scale in the first place.
homeworld,2yaxen,thxbmp2,2,Sun Mar 8 04:34:09 2015 UTC,"If the ships were all relative sizes then that'd definitely be true. But the ships are all the same size they were before, they're mostly the same speeds (as far as I can tell, probably some differences) but the distances are a third of what they were. That does mean travel times are shorter - I don't mind that so much except that it makes the game feel a lot smaller - but it also means there's less maneuver room, mistakes (sending a ship one place when a fleet is coming from somewhere else, for example) aren't punished as hard, and some missions are changed significantly - Bridge of Sighs and Chapel Perilous being two of the big ones."
homeworld,2yaxen,WhatABiscuit,9,Sun Mar 8 05:15:19 2015 UTC,"IIRC, modders of old who had tried porting HW1 ships over to HW2 directly realized that the models were ginormous in the newer engine – thrice the size of their HW2 counterparts – which is to say, the lengths and distances in HW1 had actually been in ""HW2 feet"" rather than ""HW2 meters"". Therefore, all the ships and maps in HW:R will have been scaled down by a factor of 3 to match HW2:R's scaling. I'm not too sure about whether the movement speeds have been similarly adjusted though, since I haven't managed to play the remasters yet. If your hunch is indeed correct, perhaps you could file a ticket with GBX support?"

homeworld,2ya252,struds,3,Sat Mar 7 22:28:58 2015 UTC,"Sometimes you aren't introduced to the ships at all, and just go ""Oh wait, I can build that now? What's that do?"""
homeworld,2ya252,Demosthenes01101,5,Mon Mar 9 15:37:52 2015 UTC,"It's not much more complicated than what you've already described, it sounds like you've read up on the strengths/weaknesses of the respective ships and they're available in the build menu tool-tips in-game just in case you didn't notice.  At the risk of oversimplifying you can think of the ship categories as ""good vs. light"", ""good vs. heavy"", and ""utility"" rather than the size of the ship. For example, Assault and Drone Frigates being strong vs. fighters and corvettes, Ion Frigates being strong vs other frigates and Capital ships etc. despite being the same ""size"" of ship.  So what I tend to do which may help you is add the ships into control groups based on their strength. So perhaps some Interceptors, Multi-gun Corvettes, and Assault frigates in one group for dealing with strike craft. Another group with Ion Frigates and Destroyers for dealing with Frigates and Capital ships, another group with just bombers to compliment the Ion's and Destroyers which I can select separately to withdraw if needed.  Then I'll have a few utility groups, one with some Support Frigates and maybe grav-well generators, and another two groups of Salvage Corvettes. Make use of the Salvage Corvette's when you can, they're really good for stealing enemy ships.  As an aside, you've probably read that the formations are wonky at the moment. I found that my Support Frigates would just fly off in front of everyone else. It's easiest to set them to Guard one of your Capital Ships then they'll stick at the back.  Additionally, make sure you make heavy use of the pause button. It makes battles a lot easier to manage when things get hectic!"
homeworld,2ya252,goatmayne,3,Sat Mar 7 22:50:17 2015 UTC,"what I tend to do which may help you is add the ships into control groups based on their strength   Oh my god, that's so simple but so brilliant.  This is going to improve my game, I know it."
homeworld,2ya252,chordial,3,Sun Mar 8 01:48:29 2015 UTC,"For Homeworld 1 it's more like:  Cruisers > Destroyers > Frigates > Corvettes > Fighters > Bombers > Cruisers  That's the basic gist of how different ship classes interact in Homeworld, but each ship class also has its variants that make them better/worse against other classes. Some are best at doing what you expect, like multi-gun corvettes against interceptors, but others can also ""punch up"" somewhat like Ion Frigates versus Destroyers or Heavy Corvettes versus Assault Frigates.  A good example of a ship that subverts the standard formula is the Missile Destroyer. You assume they'd crumple under bomber wings like any big dumb ship, but anything less than enough bombers to destroy a small moon in one pass will get decimated because a Missile Destroyer is designed to be an anti-strike craft vessel. Scouts on the other hand can keep it tied up for a while, since they're fast enough to evade ze missiles.  So the whole ""rock-paper-scissors thing"" isn't quite so rigid and this is probably what's making confusing for you. It's not so much ""rock-paper-scissors-shotgun-nuke"" as you put it, more ""one of your rocks has a sharp pointy bit that can pierce thin paper"" or ""one of your pairs of scissors has thick metal handles sturdy enough to crack a pebble with."" Now all the bombers in the universe still won't destroy a wing of scouts and no amount of ion frigates will stop a bomber armada, but you've got a bit more leeway than you might think.  A lot of it comes down to judging your ships' weapons, armour and speed against the enemy ships' weapons, armour and speed, and choosing accordingly. A wing of scouts will last for ages against a heavy cruiser because they're nimble enough to avoid it's slow-arse mass drivers, but don't expect them to do much more than scratch its paintwork. Bombers would be best since although they're slower than scouts, they're still fast enough to avoid the cruiser's guns and pack a decent punch. A single Destroyer will last about as long as an ice cube in a supernova.  The only other thing I can suggest is to just play through the campaign and try to get a feel for how it all fits together. Maybe even try a couple of skirmishes against the CPU on easy, or mess around in multiplayer with a friend experimenting with different ship compositions (bombers vs assault frigates, interceptors vs heavy cruisers). Experience really is the best teacher when it comes to Homeworld.  I am in no way a expert like a lot of people here, but I hope this helps make it a little less overwhelming for you."
homeworld,2ya252,bitscreed,1 point,Sun Mar 8 00:25:43 2015 UTC,"True! But you could also unload all the missiles at once with one missile destroyer, while having the other(s) for back up. By doing this, hard targets could be severely damaged, and you'd still have x2 missiles per second or so on the original volleyer, whilst maintaining soft defense with your back up.  There were so many strategies back in the day, that things became quite complex depending on the situation. Like just building 200 scouts and suiciding them into whatever struck your fancy.  As for bombers, in the old days (if they were in delta formation with aggressive tactics,) a destroyer (at maximum range,) could actually take out quite a few of them so long as they were being micromanaged  to go backwards and down. They'd still have a MAJOR issue with the bombers at close range, but having the flexibility of such tactics was a godsend for the RTS genre."
homeworld,2ya252,Teachtaire,3,Sun Mar 8 14:16:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, some vessels could really punch above their weight or minimise their disadvantages if you micro'd them enough or were smart with formations.  Pity that last one has gone completely out the airlock in HW1:R :("

Strike craft are split into fighters and bombers for an obvious example. The same goes for the corvettes and frigates. Some will be good for ant-fighter duties, others are suited for fighting against their own class, some are anti-capital ship (ion cannon frigates are good at killing battlecruisers). But then you've got flak frigates which excel at killing strike craft.   It comes down to what you think is worth building at the time and what you have available.  It really isn't more complicated than that, you generally get a feel for what to build and when. Play through the story, it gives you a chance to experiment with ship setups against various ships."

They also resurrected a 15 year old engine to run well on modern machines, redid all the textures for the ships, wrote an entirely new networking system for multiplayer, and been addressing many issues posted on the forum. They are also putting tons of work in for the modding community (working closely with many top modders) and will support the new mod tool roll outs. There have been some bumps, but what modern game (or piece of software) doesn't have problems? So far Gearbox has only strengthened my faith in them doing Homeworld justice. =D"

I kept waiting to see spinning beams that I thought the ones firing off into space were my own ICFrigages. When I did finally send my salvage corvettes after them, they were lazily stopped about 200ft from the mothership on all sides. They had done very minor damage to the Mothership."

Hell, I could see all three of their motherships in the second mission from the minute I started the level, and I ended up just sending my fleets to each one and destroying the first two within five minutes.  Edit: I actually think a huge part of the difficulty discrepancies lie in the distance changes. Having everything cut down to a third of what it was makes your mistakes in positioning a lot easier to correct, makes everything a lot easier to hit, all besides making travel times a lot shorter. If you send half your fleet somewhere you weren't supposed to and the enemy shows up at the mothership it's not difficult to bring everything back before you take too much damage."

Play HW1C, because it's better"")  So, solution could be ultimately only a integration of larger chunks of HW1 engine code/functionality into the remastered engine, or using for HW1 remastered the HW1 engine again."

But the missions after that I lost almost everything and going into the final mission the only ships I had left were all captured Taidan ships (three or four destroyers, 2 heavy cruisers, and my carriers). I remember when I did replays of classic over the years I had a pretty big fleet going into the final mission.  HW2 was still a cake walk though."

Addressing movement, specifically how movement relates to combat, is one of our upcoming tasks. So, we'll see.   Right now we need to build a playable game first. We plan on implementing modding and even Steam Workshop, but first we need to get a playable game into everyone's hands.   If we get runaway funding and can bring on more Devs, we'll look into accelerating our modding plans."
homeworld,2y95qb,KGSupreme,1 point,Thu Mar 12 19:39:09 2015 UTC,"Addressing movement   There’s a control method that I came up with when I was young and first playing Homeworld, and I’ve always wanted to see it used in a game… bear with me :)  You want to move somewhere (or, for any other reason, select a particular point in space, e.g. targeting an AoE weapon). You move the camera as needed (pan, zoom) to see where you want to go, and you click on that point on your screen. This defines a line in 3d space (to be rendered as part of the interface), passing through that point and the camera’s position. You then rotate the camera slightly, so that line is now visible, and click once more where you want to go, along that line.  Advantages compared to a scheme like Homeworld’s: far less awkward/unintuitive; less slow; not tied to one arbitrary reference plane, which would be bad with 6DoF."
homeworld,2y95qb,mawhrin--skel,1 point,Fri Mar 13 02:23:51 2015 UTC,"We've gone through several iterations of the ship controls so far, and I'm sure there will be more iterations to follow.   Obviously, issuing 3D commands through a 2D interface is a challenge.   While your idea interests me, and we may pursue it, the requiring of the camera angle change to issue a command concerns me. Imagine trying to issue a bunch of different commands to a bunch of different units in a fast pace battle. All of that camera movement would be a bit much and would make it difficult to keep track of the battle.   Right now we have a nice blend of automation and options. Players can issue horizontal moves, or they can customize those horizontal moves by using the scroll wheel to adjust the verticality. And since these ships have their own degree of automation, ships will normally move in to pursue the enemy without the need of the vertical scroll, allowing for faster simpler commands.   Like I said, this will probably go through more iterations, both small and large, but it's been working pretty well for us so far."
homeworld,2y95qb,mawhrin--skel,1 point,Fri Mar 13 03:00:30 2015 UTC,"Alright. I’d just suggest—keep an eye out in playtesting for how much people move the camera around anyway because they aren’t sure they lined up their target correctly.  Good luck, it looks real pretty."

They released a sample (two ships) for the community to tinker with before the full on mod tool that allows people to create almost anything?   Is this better than what people were working with in the original hw2 mods?
homeworld,2y6vth,Quietly-Confident,5,Sat Mar 7 00:07:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's the first mod tool they've released and they are going to continue to update it an add features and stuff. They also are starting to upload sample ship files to the Steam Workshop so that the community to play with them.   Everyone on the modding forums has been trying to figure out how to reverse engineer the ships so they can start adding their own, but Gearbox has been very adamant that it won't work properly. They said to hold off until they released the tools, and now with the example ships we have something to tinker with to get started.  Some of the community created tools for HW2 were pretty sophisticated, and Gearbox isn't quite there yet, but they are working on it."

homeworld,2y7bep,mthead911,10,Sat Mar 7 02:29:16 2015 UTC,"You do have time to prepare at Sarum. In fact, it's one of the slowest-paced missions in the game, if you use the proper strategy, with a rather lengthy gap between your arrival and anything aside from the initial battle happening. The trick is, you see, that very little happens once you defeat the initial attack on the shipyard until you repair it. Thus, if you ignore repairing it and allow it to repair itself, which takes quite a long time, you have plenty of time to build up your fleet, collect resources, and prepare for the Vaygr to return. Pulsar corvettes to deal with the frigates and corvettes, bombers to knock out the carriers, and gunships/interceptors to take out the fighters are what you want.  Oh, and the Pride can move itself from Mission 3 onwards, unlike the classic bananaship. Remember that. Comes in handy more than once."

It was so hard that they patched it to make it easier and it was still a pain in the ass.  In remastered I'm pretty sure you're playing the patched version or something close to it.  LIke someone else said, the key is controlling the pacing yourself.  Figure out the triggers that make the mission advance, and don't do them until you're ready.   A strategy I used on Sarum before was actually to only mostly kill the ships attacking the shipyard. Leave one fighter squadron attacking it, and they'll damage its health just slightly slower than it regenerates. That gives you a full 10 minutes to gather resources and build up a full capacity fleet of corvettes, and even have a couple frigates built by the time the vaygr carriers arrive.  With a full compliment of corvettes and some frigates, it's easy enough. It's kind of exploit-y but it works."

homeworld,2y7bep,Smugasaurus,1 point,Sat Mar 7 16:45:27 2015 UTC,I remember playing the original HW2 when I was younger and found mission 4 (the one after Sarum) to be impossible. They have many heavy missile frigates and a destroyer(!) while you only had strike craft torpedo frigates. I had to cheat and gave myself 100000RUs by editing the save file to win. The early missions were indeed some of the more difficult ones.
homeworld,2y7bep,GATTACABear,1 point,Sat Mar 7 19:29:44 2015 UTC,"I also found mission 4 in the original HW2 downright impossible when I was younger. I only got past it by patching my copy to the (then) latest version, which made it a whole lot easier."
homeworld,2y7bep,BigBennP,1 point,Sun Mar 8 00:41:55 2015 UTC,"The tricks were to always capture the battleship on the left, and not to kill the last hyperspace inhibitor until you'd done everything else.  March the MS up the middle, collecting and building the whole way, and sending forward groups of pulsars and bombers to nibble away the resourcing, build and fleet before you get there with your battleship.   You end up with a battleship and pulsars against HM corvettes, and that, as they say, was a cakewalk.    Patience with the nibbling, though.   The torpedo frigates were mostly useless, in my opinion.  HW2RM was easy here, as there was no fleet to nibble at the station, just the shipyard and the carrier.   Easy to take out with bombers and pulsars."
homeworld,2y7bep,awful_at_internet,0,Wed Mar 11 22:02:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as a newcomer to the franchise it is frustrating that the only way to win sometimes is to fail your first run and prepare for attacks by memorization. That isn't strategy, that is bad game design."
homeworld,2y7bep,GATTACABear,8,Sat Mar 7 04:42:05 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Just because you didn't succeed does not mean it is bad game design. I don't remember having too much trouble with that mission if I am honest, but let's look at it.   Consider that part of your strategy in Homeworld is your fleet composition across missions and its preparedness for certain situations, so that's strategy too.   Also, all kinds of games have moments where one has to or should backtrack and it is not always because of bad game design, but because the player has made a wrong decision or a mistake that has come back to bite them."
homeworld,2y7bep,StillRadioactive,0,Sat Mar 7 07:54:27 2015 UTC,"It isn't about fleet composition, I wish people would stop droning on about that. The gigantic field of battle, combined with slow ships, puts you in situations where you literally cannot overcome obstacles without having units in the vicinity  already.   I get they want to use the area, but giving time limits with heavy ships on opposite corners with time limits is just stupid. Anything bigger than a corvette takes minutes to move across the field, fully upgraded. If the game wants to spread us thin at the CHANCE of an event happening, it shouldn't limit your strike craft count. I can't defend the north side with interceptors, bombers, and   Unit capacity/less timed events/more manageable enemy wings at such events/faster craft/less junk at opposite end of the map....something should give to avoid this cheese, honestly anything will do."
homeworld,2y7bep,GATTACABear,3,Sat Mar 7 19:41:41 2015 UTC,"If the game wants to spread us thin at the CHANCE of an event happening   You don't think that's something that ever might happen to an actual military force?   One thing to remember is that Homeworld, and even Homeworld 2 are games from a different era of video game design.  Homeworld was 1999 and Homeworld 2 was 2003, but really they hearken back almost to the mid 90's in their design.  From a time when designers were far less afraid to pull punches.   The late 90's were a time of transition to the more modern trends in design where a game on ""normal"" is supposed to be beatable by most people, from an earlier time where many designers programmed their games to be beaten only by expert level players.   Although its a much older game, I'll give you a good example.  Star Control II, released in 1992.  I consider it one of the best games of all time.    It had virtually no tutorial, and 5 minutes into the game, you had a fight with an enemy ship that, if you didn't know how to beat it, would slaughter you, or leave you so weakened you couldn't recover.   Moreover, the game was huge, and there was no internal tracking system. The manual suggested you take notes.  I remember getting on the early internet, maybe 1995-6 with an AOL dialup connection, and finding a text based walkthrough for Star COntrol II."
homeworld,2y7bep,StillRadioactive,7,Sun Mar 8 00:30:29 2015 UTC,Is Dark Souls also a badly designed game? Because that takes the fail-learn-repeat formula to a whole new level.
homeworld,2y7bep,GATTACABear,-1,Sat Mar 7 08:15:55 2015 UTC,"Actually yeah. Never liked it. I like hard games, I just don't like games that make you fail first to get it. That isn't rewarding to me. Give me a challenge, sure, but I want to be the reason I fail, not a situation you had to precog to overcome, that's just stupid and a waste of time."
homeworld,2y7bep,StillRadioactive,2,Sat Mar 7 19:43:46 2015 UTC,"Learning to build and manage balanced fleets will definitely save your ass.  It's not the most RU-efficient way to go through the game, but being prepared for everything works."
homeworld,2y7bep,BitchinTechnology,-2,Sat Mar 7 14:52:57 2015 UTC,"Not really. When you need to suddenly be across the map to destroy a probe, or defend something against 15 frigates/cruisers whatever, your fleet composition means shitall. When ships take forever to move, the only thing you can do is be there before the event happens. That is bad design. The fleet can't all be strike craft."
homeworld,2y7bep,mephisto2012,3,Sat Mar 7 19:32:58 2015 UTC,So... don't move the whole fleet?
homeworld,2y7bep,BitchinTechnology,0,Sat Mar 7 21:17:08 2015 UTC,"I assign my ships to three strike groups with different compositions based on starting position. A faster/lighter group to meet far contacts. A medium group that keeps a reasonable distance from the shipyard/mothership. And Heavy, with a stronger tilt towards the heavy hitters.  Previous compositions were flat divisions evenly ratio-ed, but Homeworld didn't like that at all.  Truth is you all know the game makes you lose, so I'm not really going to argue that anymore. I'm positing that that isn't a great experience. I play things iron man because I like the challenge. Especially with a game where you have to protect a fleet. I don't like going back and save-scumming.   But yeah, that's my thoughts. Sorry if you all don't like them. I'm sure you can get over it."

Move the mothership right up to the shipyard, harvest the rocks right there (I had so many resources from the last mission - might have been a bug - that I just forgot about the other rocks.)  Use marine frigates to capture the attacking frigates (use the captured infiltrator frigates to capture more ships!), but don't try to capture the carriers - it doesn't work.  Finally, remember that you have to kill EVERY enemy at the end. Yes, this includes random enemy harvesters and scouts hiding in dust clouds that you can't see.  From here on out, it gets a LOT easier."
homeworld,2y7bep,mephisto2012,2,Sat Mar 7 19:54:30 2015 UTC,I actually found capturing the carriers to be very useful. I left an infiltrator frigate next to each one and kept capturing so they were paralyzed. Gave me plenty of time to pick them off without dealing with swarms of strike craft.

Ships target them individually, they have individual hit points and do their damage individually. They are effectively five individual Interceptors in a permanent V formation.  Thats why they absolutely annihilate HW1 Interceptors. The Interceptor wings behave like five individual Interceptors in a formation, just like formations worked in HW1, and HW1 Interceptors lose to them because of their ability to focus fire where the HW1 Interceptors split up and start targeting individually. Thats the core of the issue."

I re-loaded my previous save, captured the ships and then destroyed the inhibitors but it didn't trigger the end of the mission.  I actually had to exit and restart the game before it would trigger.

Did you, by any chance, salvage all the Turanic Raider ships or, were the resources bugged so that you were able to collect 10's of thousands of RU's?  I'd heard of players coming up against as many as a dozen but 18 seems like you'd need a practically a full compliment of strike craft."
homeworld,2y7344,grogleberry,1 point,Sat Mar 7 01:29:46 2015 UTC,"The first thing that popped into my head was:  Why didn't you use the F12 screenshot function?  The second thing is along hte lines of the other people here  How many ships, how many RU's do you have? The bug letting you get a hold of 10,000,000,000,000,000 RU's every map (exaggerating, but yeah, far more than you should be getting) would be messing with the games scaling."

Mine ran late (even though I could have driven 3 hours to gearbox and picked it up directly) by two days and I didn't even get a 'sorry'. Plus they botched my shipping label and I had to have ups intercept it at the hub, drive half an hour across town and pick it up there. AND it didn't charge my gift card balance like it was set up to, instead charging my 'spending' money account (not expecting this it was practically empty) and causing an overdraft.  Of course by this point I already bought it again so I could play it on my only day off of the month. Love the game but fuck amazon so much."

homeworld,2y4ntx,Swiftarm,30,Fri Mar 6 12:13:15 2015 UTC,"In the current state they trade just barely superior to Flak frigates. In HW1 and Cataclysm they were veritable bastions of armor even when faced with tougher foe, and 6 could take on a Heavy Cruiser.  They've been normalized to HW2 health and firepower and, thus, are now made out of capital-class space-paper that's been soaked in the tears of their fellow, ailing Kharakian kiithid."
homeworld,2y4ntx,Gopherlad,5,Fri Mar 6 12:22:21 2015 UTC,"Woah, they are defs nowhere near that powerful anymore. Glad it's not just me!"
homeworld,2y4ntx,Xostriyad,2,Fri Mar 6 12:54:07 2015 UTC,"Back when I played HW2 multiplayer a lot (i was a heavy vayger player) I'd include a couple assault frigates, if I built them at all, early on in the game.  Three at most really just to throw something at swarms while I get my strike craft and torp frigates up and running. Usually just skipped them."
homeworld,2y4ntx,Foreverclear82,3,Fri Mar 6 20:02:21 2015 UTC,"Frigates in HW2 are a lot weaker than they were in HW1 and it looks like the HW1 frigates adopted the traits of the HW2 frigates in the remaster. If they took the listed stats from HW1 and extrapolated them into the HW2 engine, you could tear a hole through just about anything with enough HW1 frigates. They used to be a backbone, now...not so much."
homeworld,2y4ntx,Latiasracer,3,Fri Mar 6 18:42:03 2015 UTC,"Assault frigates suffer in the remaster because they use flak frigate AI. They are not even that good against strike craft anymore :(  They think they have a 360 degree firing arc and rotating turrets, so make no effort to point towards their target (However their guns can't fire 360, so they are just a bit happless)"
homeworld,2y4ntx,the_ZJ,2,Fri Mar 6 15:59:49 2015 UTC,"Which was just the same in the original game as far as I was able to see it - during the painful HW1C tutorial which I totally only did for the achievement. After watching them trying to hit scouts for half an hour and fighting with the antiquated UI, I'm not sure why so many people seem to think Homeworld 1 is the superiour game. I for one prefer Homeworld 2 in almost every single aspect - even though the storytelling might've been a tad wonky at times."
homeworld,2y4ntx,Latiasracer,1 point,Fri Mar 6 17:52:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying HW is superior, but the assault frigates where substantially more effective against corvettes and larger fighters than they are now."

I wish they did a little bit more testing and comparing to the original before they released it. I feel like they put a lot of time into hw2 but just ported over hw1 into the new engine without playing around with it.
homeworld,2y4ntx,Giggily,1 point,Wed Mar 11 04:53:27 2015 UTC,"They think they have a 360 degree firing arc and rotating turrets, so make no effort to point towards their target (However their guns can't fire 360, so they are just a bit happless)    This depends on the target. For missiles, subsystems, and strikecraft the Assault Frigate is told simply to fly towards its enemy, stop, and start shooting without trying to track its target. For larger targets, like other frigates and capital ships, they do track their targets.  The issue you're probably seeing is more the fact that they have something like a 13.5% chance to hit strikecraft with every shot of their assault gun. That works out to be about 60% overall accuracy for every volley with their assault guns. Combine that with the fact that their turret coverage isn't as good as HW2 Flak Frigates and you start to run into a problem."
homeworld,2y4ntx,chuiu,2,Fri Mar 6 21:02:14 2015 UTC,"I assume you mean HW1 assault frigates?  The only reason I can see anyone wanting to get these is as an anti-corvette measure.  And even then they're not terribly great at that because groups of corvettes are just as effective against them.  The HW1 assault frigates are horrible, they always were.  They don't do enough damage and they're high cost for what you're getting (compared to Ion Frigate)."
homeworld,2y4ntx,Hunterkiller2011,2,Fri Mar 6 17:40:19 2015 UTC,I'd much rather spend RU's on Ion frigates with actually range and damage
homeworld,2y4ntx,SentienceIssues,2,Fri Mar 6 19:16:43 2015 UTC,I first noticed this during Supernova Station when 25+ frigates were destroyed within two minutes of meeting the destroyers and cruiser. I went into Classic and put two ICF against a destroyer and the fight lasted almost 5 minutes with the destroyer coming out with significant damage.  Every time I am playing I build a lot of frigates but as soon as I see a destroyer I have to retreat or else they all get demolished unless there is a destroyer with them or it's being occupied by fighters. It is very annoying.
homeworld,2y4ntx,ShasOFish,1 point,Wed Mar 11 04:50:21 2015 UTC,"Attack frigates are still pretty good against fighters and corvettes, but they aren't so hot against larger vessels IMO."

I remember they were decent against corvettes and were effective in hitting harvesters, but it seems like the new assfrigs can't take that much damage anymore and are also pretty good against fighters in some cases. It'll be interesting to see what future patches do regarding balance."
homeworld,2y4ntx,FRR-Wriath,1 point,Fri Mar 6 16:01:19 2015 UTC,"It's weird trying to participate in these topics. When someone says ""Assault Frigate,"" I don't know if they mean HW, HWR or the HW2/Remaster version. There are three different kinds.   HW1 Assault Frigate I had no use for because I was all about strike craft and super capital class ships. I hardly bothered with frigates unless they were commandeered with salvage corvettes. I built Assault Frigates in abundance in HWR, however, because strike craft are nerfed/broken due to the fact that the game uses the RNG system from HW2 instead of ballistics from OG HW. That means that Assault Frigates (and above) can track to kill strike craft with guns.  I never bothered with Assault Frigates in HW2. Straight up Flak, Ions, and Pulsar Corvettes. Bombers for subsystems."

homeworld,2y4ntx,the_ZJ,1 point,Sat Mar 7 12:05:25 2015 UTC,"I really hope they balance things more like HW1 eventually. I never liked Homeworld 2's ship balance, makes me sad they went that route."
homeworld,2y4ntx,the_ZJ,1 point,Mon Mar 9 03:13:20 2015 UTC,"Going back to this because I'm getting f-ed up in the campaigns for both games.   Rather than trying to build a few of everything, is it not a good idea to focus on a few ships and develop your play-style around them?   For example, I dig destroyers and corvettes, especially heavy corvettes in HW1. Could I build an effective force of Destroyers and corvettes with a whole mess of interceptors and some repair corvettes thrown in?"
homeworld,2y4ntx,the_ZJ,1 point,Thu Mar 12 09:44:47 2015 UTC,"Frigates in general are fairly vulnerable ships offering high utility, speed and damage as a trade-off. In my experience, they almost always need support from either fighters or larger capital ships - but when that's the case, they become a force to be reckoned with. I'm not sure about the HW1R balancing tho, that seems pretty fubar at the moment - but concerning the HW2R balancing, frigates can be game-changing when well used and supported.  For instance, Hiigaran Torpedo Frigates can deal a lot of damage to carriers and many other ships while being relatively fast, thus allowing them to kite other enemy ships, especially with a tech advantage on your side. However, they can be incredibly vulnerable to bombers, which is why you always need to support them to protect against their counters - which kind of goes for every ship in the game, but to varying degrees. While those torpedo frigates can deal a surprising amount of damage at a nice range, they're not very well armoured and will die in most direct engagements. Therefore, using their strengths and playing around their weaknesses is key."
homeworld,2y4ntx,AbsoluteZero00k,1 point,Fri Mar 6 12:24:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks bro! So, TL;DR, kinda glass-cannony and need a lot of micro to keep them moving, but great if used well?"
homeworld,2y4ntx,the_ZJ,1 point,Fri Mar 6 12:58:59 2015 UTC,"Indeed, though it gets better late game since bigger ships can soak a lot of damage for them. What I like to do in my 2v2s is use gunship corvettes and then head for torpedo frigates, those are still T2 and can be used vs other corvettes and to pressure ressource operations as well. Not sure if thats a good strategy or anything, I'm way too inexperienced to tell, but it's been working fine so far."

Big issues I've run into thus far are 1. not being able to force target mines with my missile destroyer - although I'm not sure if this issue was preexisting before the patch, and 2. entering the next mission post-patch with over a million RUs.  On the plus side, having the original weapon audio back is fantastic. It's so great hearing that iconic mass driver sound again, and little details like this are a sign that Gearbox is actually listening to what the community wants. Good on them.

homeworld,2y2j2e,The_Shithawk,1 point,Fri Mar 6 04:30:00 2015 UTC,Ya I was pretty upset about it. It makes strike craft SO much more vulnerable and nearly useless.

Mission 2: Over 50,000 RU available. Many of the smaller rocks were 3000+ RU, while the larger ones were ""standard"" 700 RU. Mission 3: Couple of thousand RU near the scaffold wreckage. Mission 4: Over 500,000 RU (?!). A lot of the individual rocks have over 50,000 RU each.    On mission 4 I mined for a while until I got bored, but the auto-mining on jump out gave me almost 600,000 RU. Crazy.

homeworld,2y2j2e,Gifted_SiRe,7,Fri Mar 6 18:56:06 2015 UTC,"Wow. I wasn't expecting nearly this much to be addressed so quickly. Well done, Gearbox."
homeworld,2y2j2e,Giggily,4,Thu Mar 5 22:09:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I honestly thought the first patch would be all stability and maybe a hint of MP balance.  I'm glad a few of the complaints about ""unfaithful"" details have already been addressed, like the weapon sounds.  Good on Gearbox for catering to the longtime fans with some of their dev time on this patch."

When they buff strikecraft, for example, will they be better in the campaign, or are MP and campaign units treated as separate entities that can have different properties?"

homeworld,2y2j2e,baja_01,4,Thu Mar 5 23:09:41 2015 UTC,"I finished HW1 campaign last week and I am having difficulty running HW2 campaign. The game freezes my pc, the blue screen appears with a DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION error. Any chance that this patch fixes it? I have 670gtx, i7 3770k and 8gb ram. Currently, everything is set to max.  Update: Seems like enabling V-sync fixed my issue."
homeworld,2y2j2e,METROID4,8,Thu Mar 5 22:45:03 2015 UTC,"That BSOD is more often caused by drivers/hardware than games itselves, so from the name I'd doubt HW would fix that issue. You'd need some more information about that (like where/which file caused the violation, how long after system was boot up etc., a good tool for this if BlueScreenView).  Rarely, it can also be a problem for overclocking your CPU, but often it's some bad drivers/old versions, or things like some ""smart"" keyboard (expensive gaming macro capable)/headset (7.1 USB) with wrong drivers/unsupported drivers for Win 8 / put in USB 3.0 port (I've often noticed that some devices don't really work well in 3.0, mostly the ones I listed, other-than-generic keyboards and USB headsets)."
homeworld,2y2j2e,Batolemaeus,2,Thu Mar 5 22:16:56 2015 UTC,One thing I've found is to make sure your ram timings and frequency are properly set in your bios.  Letting my MB auto set my ram was causing random crash errors to come and go.  Once I set them to the ram specs all the crashing went away.

homeworld,2y2j2e,caltheon,2,Fri Mar 6 08:53:45 2015 UTC,So how does this effect mods? Do they have to be adjusted for this patch in order to run properly? I was actually just working on a little something earlier today and after this patch it won't run anymore :(
homeworld,2y2j2e,Sandalphon22,4,Fri Mar 6 18:17:26 2015 UTC,"The update is several new .big files, instead of replacing the old ones. The files which have been updated (which already existed and are now changed/overwritten) are still usable, but you should reload the changed version into your mod and make your mod changes again (because e.g. somewhere else in the file this patch might have changed a value, if you don't reload the new file from the patch, you enforce the old version which doesn't have that change somewhere else). Some affected files are:  English Locale:   ui.dat hw1ships.dat hw1buildresearch.dat engine.dat   Tutorial files of HW2 (M01, 02 and 03)  Leveldata files of DeathmatchHW1 (all maps of HW1), although most if not all files are unchanged from the originals in Homeworld2.big (I thought the asteroid resource amounts would be fixed here)  Russian Locale files:   engine.ucs ui.ucs   4 missile files:   kus_missile kus_missilevolley tai_missile tai_missilevolley   Some more asteroid resources (again, some files I've tested are exactly the same)  Taidan and Kushan got some buffs in their Research tree, the Build Speed upgrades (i.e. the upgrade that makes their MS/Carrier build faster) are slightly more effective, affected are the research.lua of both races  Some UI elements:   UI\pings\pings.lua UI\newui\ <= several files here including gameroom.lua, playerlaggingscreen.lua and 4 folders   Lots of weapon changes (probably the sounds for each weapon? most are Taidan and Kushan so buffs are possible too)  Some further upgrades in the HW1Campaign.big. HW1Ships.big, HW2Campaign.big and HW2Ships.big.  Decrypt, Extract and check which files are changed in the .big files in the \Homeworld\HomeworldRM\DataUpdates folder (where the patch just got downloaded to)."
homeworld,2y2j2e,wasdie639,2,Fri Mar 6 00:20:45 2015 UTC,"Probably depends on which lua files you are working with.  If your replaced ones were changed in the patch, you're going to need to migrate your changes to the new files."

They start out with a weird hubris, make a strange definition of ""unbound"" (which sounds pretty damn bound to me), and then turn tail and flee the moment things start going south.   In HW1 they really came across as an ancient and knowledgeable race that was sympathetic to the exiles, selling them tech on the cheap, giving information, etc... almost all without breaking any Taiidan laws, up until you rescue them and they give you the forbidden info about your past. IMO, it really came off as if they were setting the exiles up to reclaim Hiigara with minimal outside help, so that their claim would be legit. No one would be able to come in and say that the Bentusi totally did all the work for them, etc.  It's interesting to me, because the Bentusi could easily be a major galactic military power, but they are very careful not to be seen that way."

Or more reasonably just accept two definitions for the word in the context of Homeworld.

Bringing up the writers over and over again has its own problems: who defines the canon of the Homeworld universe? Why would the definition of Unbound change between games? I would like to agree more in line to the thinking of the sentient-ship merger, but there are problems with even how the Bentusi defined it in Cata. Is Karan truly unbound? She is removed from the Mothership at least twice in history, while we see no record of the Bentusi being removed from their ships. So what is the only thing left in common at this point? Both are spacefaring races.  I think if Cata had been done by the original studio, and not just two of the writers, I'd be a lot more willing to accept your stance, but it wasn't, and I'm not convinced you're correct, despite your bluster."

In doing so they changed the history of Homeworld 1 by making the whole long jump core McGuffin. In the original Homeworld 1's manual it describes them building a new hyperspace module for the mothership, not refurbishing the one from the Khar-Toba.  Sorry, Cataclysm is canon.

However Cataclysm used the same setting, so it doesn't really matter in this context. The people who wrote the actual plot and dialogue wrote for both Homeword and Cataclysm, using the same setting which David helped to create.  This is really a pedantic and utterly meaningless argument you seem to be making. Cataclysm wasn't a sequel, it was an ""episode"" set in the same world as Homeworld 1. Homeworld 2 was where they changed not only the story but large parts of the setting without so much as consulting the original creative minds.

Don't worry about HW2, the lore is better without it.   Who cares, its not canon to the series going forward which was made clear with homeworld 2.

Frankly arguing this is like arguing did Han shoot first. Personally I go by what the ORIGINAL WRITERS wrote, and which games had the better storylines. HW2 was the one with inconsistencies with the whole long jump core McGuffin.  Either way Homeworld's lore is not consistent, even if you completely ignore Cataclysm.

homeworld,2y33rs,halofreak7777,5,Fri Mar 6 17:14:46 2015 UTC,"Harvesting has definitely been changed dramatically with this patch. So many extra resources have been added, that mining anything after mission 4 is irrelevant. For example, I started a new game last night and found the following:   Mission 1: standard 1250 RU available. Mission 2: Over 50,000 RU available. Many of the smaller rocks were 3000+ RU, while the larger ones were ""standard"" 700 RU. Mission 3: Couple of thousand RU near the scaffold wreckage. Mission 4: Over 500,000 RU (?!). A lot of the individual rocks have over 50,000 RU each.    On mission 4 I mined for a while until I got bored, but the auto-mining on jump out gave me almost 600,000 RU. Crazy. Obviously I can't spend this much, so there really isn't any point in mining anything for the rest of the game."

I think I went into the final mission with 100k+... And I think therein lies my least favorite thing about Homeworld: The unit cap. Since we have dynamic difficulty, it'd be cool if we could have an option to do a campaign with no unit cap. Just amass as many units as we want, and the CPU has an equally-proportioned fleet. I would LOVE to bring like 24 battlecruisers to bear against the enemy on the final level."

I know there's mods like that around, for example the complex mod - maybe not that much for the vanilla game. But, like, a battleship would be pretty cool tbh.  Adding in completely new factions based on the pre-existing single player components would be, if not unfeasable, then incredibly hard to achieve for the developers, considering they're a small team mainly aimed at remastering pre-existing content. For this, they would have to create completely new content, and, maybe even more importantly, create completely new game design components. The new factions need to be at least as fleshed out in terms of complexity and gameplay as the pre-existing ones, and that would be no small feat if theyre not just supposed to be re-skins."
homeworld,2y4d0c,the_ZJ,2,Fri Mar 6 10:38:54 2015 UTC,"But, like, a battleship would be pretty cool tbh.   That'd be fun, double if they added a new module to the shipyard, ""super capital ship"".

I've never managed to take out more than one or two before my fighters decide they've had enough of life.  Ion cannon frigates seem effective. Move them out of the way of the asteroid field (either to one side or above / below), and have them target the major asteroids.

homeworld,2y47fr,Achilleswar,5,Fri Mar 6 07:23:55 2015 UTC,"Alrighty. Ill give you a brief run down on how this mission should play out.   First mechanics to watch out for and to note.   a. You have no obligation to help the Fleet. You can watch them burn and ace the mission perfectly.   b. The missiles are treated like normal enemies. That is to say, your fighters may decide to attack them, and may not. IF you really want to chance it and automate as much as you can, set everything to Aggressive stance, and just make sure they don't go out of position.   c. When you use Sajuuk, make sure not to plant it directly on top of a target, the main gun doesn't target correctly in that circumstance.  d. Sajuuk Can use Hyperspace in this mission.  e. As long as you don't send Sajuuk by itself to the middle, its effectively impossible to sink/loose in this mission. SO DONT TRY TO WASTE FLEET ASSETS PROTECTING IT. Its fine. On its own.  STRAT: That being said, You want to send 2-5 squads of interceptors on the far left, 2-5 interceptors on the far right, and you want to deploy them as soon as you can to the Asteroid Field.  If you want, you can swap interceptors with gunships, or scouts. Bring the rest of your fleet up into the middle on top of the asteroid field, or if you are feeling confident, you can bull rush and defend the fleet IN THE MIDDLE. (What I typically end up doing for the LOlz, I don't recommend doing this.)  Keep Sajuuk with your fleet during this time frame.   Once the cut scene happens with the Planet killers, Hyperspace Sajuuk By itself NEARBY, NOT ON TOP BUT NEARBY one of the planet killers. Have it target the planet killer. IT will take 2-6 Main cannon shots, but it will down it.    This is the tricky part. While the planet killers are in play, they fire the missiles towards the asteroid field. When they start firing the missiles, have your squadrons on each side of the map target and fire at each one of the missiles on their side only. If you do this right, each time they fire salvos of missiles your fighters should move up some, and eventually wind up in Far middle left, and Far middle right, and possibly even far upper left, and far upper right. Don't let your fighters get anywhere close to the planet killers, you don't want them dogfighting. After they are done taking down missiles, move them back to the asteroid field, and wait for next salvo to occur. Rinse/repeat.  Keep doing this, and move Sajuuk to next platform when ever it downs one.   Use your middle battle group to intercept the missiles that go down the middle. Make sure you move your battlegroup up a little so it has a few seconds to intercept.   During the missile phase, you should try manual targeting of all missiles instead of auto targeting. You can set your ships to aggressive to help out some, but don't trust em.   Follow this guide, and its a easy mission.    Let me know if this helped.  EDIT: Before I forget, this mission really does need to be played from overhead strat view, not the pretty view."

I got tons of money and full population before the killers arrive so I'm all over protecting the defense fleet. They fight so valiantly.

They both have shields, but the Enterprise's weapons are way more accurate than turbolasers in Star Wars. That said, Star Destroyers do have a lot of them. I feel like the main question would be if the Enterpise is nimble enough to evade most of the laser fire. So maybe no for the Galaxy class and yes for the Sovereign class?  The ship's without shields would have no chance in my opinion. Just facing each other the Pillar of Autumn would probably wreck the Galactica. The Galactica is .3km bigger, but the PoA is 1.17km long and has a huge rail gun running must of the length of the ship that fires 3 rapid shots of tungsten flechette rounds. They were supposedly capable of passing straigh through an unshielded Covenant ship. If the Galactica survived long enough to get into fist fight range it would probably win though. The Autumn's secondary weapon, the missile pods, wouldn't be able to break through Galactica's flak shield.  I have way too much time on my hands."

homeworld,2y1amd,Thirteenera,5,Thu Mar 5 16:39:48 2015 UTC,"I usually divide my fleet the following way:  Group 1: Every military ships I have. When moving everything, I put them in Capital Phalanx formation. Keeps the fragile fighters and corvettes at the back until my bigger ships have engaged the enemy. As soon as they're in range, fighters and corvettes break formation and attack the enemy, but usually by then my battlecruisers are acting as sponges for damage. This keeps most of my fleet alive. Group 1 is made of Group 2, Group 3 and Group 4 all together.  Group 2: All my military fighters and corvettes. I don't assign a formation. If I give a command to group 2, I want them to use their top speed to attack whatever target I want. If in a formation, they'll move at corvette speed. I use group 2 on it's own to rush to protect resourcers, or to attack outlying enemies that are too far from my main group.  Group 3: All my military frigates. I put them in Wall formation, to keep them in a nice wall until they reach the enemy. Useful to have them as a separate group, as they move a bit faster than bigger ships. I use manual targetting to target specific units (marine frigate/salavage corvettes, capital ships engines, etc.) Wall formation also put the Defense Frigate (HW2) right with the rest, unlike Frigate line, which weirdly leave the Defense Frigates some distance back.  Group 4: Capital ships only. They're at the center of everything, and will fuck up anything that comes their way. They usually stay in the Capital Phalanx formation, but will occasionnaly let them loose if the enemy is all over the place. Aggressive tactics work wonders, and they usually automatically target other capitals ships while still engaging fighters and corvettes.   Formations will vary. But everything in Capital Phalanx works nicely if facing the enemy on a single front. Just target their biggest ship, and the rest takes care of itself. Your Capital wil first attack, then the Frigates. Once these are engaged, the corvettes and fighters will then break formation and rush to the fray. Pretty cool to watch too."
homeworld,2y1amd,lambda2808,4,Thu Mar 5 17:11:15 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I usually divide my Capitals into two groups: Anti Frigate and below, and also Anti Capital and Above.  Basically group 3 is heavy cruisers, Destroyers, Ion Cannons, while group 4 is Missile Destroyer, Drone Frigate, Assault Frigate. Group 0 is usually relevant carriers that are supporting from behind."

homeworld,2y1amd,dancingliondl,3,Thu Mar 5 16:48:22 2015 UTC,"It seems like formations work like this: They are maintained during a move order and ignored during the attack order.  Maybe you can micro if you really want to by starting in a formation, getting close and then attacking. After the initial volley, give a new move order to reform and then start again."
homeworld,2y1amd,Valvador,1 point,Thu Mar 5 19:12:57 2015 UTC,Formations in Remastered work exactly the same as Strike Groups in HW2. The units will move together but will break into dogfighting behavior when battle is joined.
homeworld,2y1amd,Gopherlad,1 point,Thu Mar 5 23:05:10 2015 UTC,"Since formations are broken at the moment anyway, if I have a big force I will put everything in wall formation just before getting in range of the battle just to make sure that every ship joins the battle at roughly the same time."
homeworld,2y1al4,whisit,3,Thu Mar 5 16:39:35 2015 UTC,"1) They don't matter, except maybe to control the spread of your fleet. Once your units engage the enemy, formations go out the window.  EDIT: As /u/Achilleswar mentioned, formations can be hepful to determine the order of engagement. Some formations put capital ships in front (Capital Phalanx), Frigates in front (Frigate Line) or Fighters in front (Fighter Screen). Usually, you want your biggest ship in the front, as the gap between ship classes is huge. If your fighters engage first, they'll get shredded by the bigger ships, but if your capital ships engage first, they'll soak up the damage while the rest of the fleet stays a bit safer.  2) No, they seem to have a limited range when automatically collecting resources, maybe to prevent them rushing toward enemy lines? Use the period key to check if any harvester is idle.  3) The Caps Lock key select everything. You can then pause the game and inspect your fleet.  EDIT: Hold ""A"" when drag-selecting to select only military ships. Useful when your fleet is all over the place.  4) AI isn't too good. I usually have them guard a battlecruiser or another big ship, and hen the battle start I press ""Y"" and drag-select my fleet. This gets the repair corvettes helping the entire fleet. Avoid giving them attack commands, it confuses them."

homeworld,2y1al4,clam-down,3,Fri Mar 6 03:36:32 2015 UTC,"Formations for fighters arent very useful because they break formation as soon as they start attacking and fly all over. For capital and frigates though, i use the ""capital phalanx"". If you have a bunch of your large ships selected put them in that formation and when the enemy attacks, your strongest ships will be out front then you send in the fighters/corvettes after capital and frigates are engaged."
homeworld,2y1al4,Achilleswar,2,Thu Mar 5 17:13:45 2015 UTC,"Ok.  I guess the other use is to keep the different ships together, so you don't end up in a situation where the intercepters get there first and get clobbered.  Thanks!"
homeworld,2y1al4,m0rningb0ner,1 point,Thu Mar 5 19:16:30 2015 UTC,"Agree that ""capital phalanx"" is the way to go (for the campaign, at least). Capital ships have the best health/cost ratio so you're better off letting them soak up the damage. Losing destroyers or heavy cruisers isn't so bad since they leave debris that allow you to re-coup some of the cost whereas if you lose a frigate, that's 900RU down the drain. I started off using ""frigate line"" and found myself spending all my RU's on replacing lost frigates."
homeworld,2y1al4,sumelar,3,Thu Mar 5 22:29:17 2015 UTC,"Wall is best for capital ships and certain corvettes to allow all the ships and turrets an open field of fire. Claw is best for fighters to allow them to concentrate fire. Neither really matters in the remastered edition as ships don't stay in formation very well once combat starts. They do, but the remastered version seems to have introduced bugs. You need to keep ordering them to harvest, and usually move them closer to available resources so the ships can see them. Also, all resources are autoharvested at the end of the level, so don't worry too much about harvesting during the mission. Control groups are the best way, no empire tree here. Band select all the ships you want to be healed. With the latch on feature of homeworld 2, the HW1 repair ships are a bit buggy, but they will eventually work. Also, use support frigates (preferably salvaged ones) and save your corvette space for salvage and multi-gun corvettes."
