NorthKoreaNews,3dhnmk,Stefan_Zhirkov,-1,Sat Jul 18 16:11:41 2015 UTC,"How can you even make such a statement, what is it based on? I think the world wants to demonize North Korea in every aspect of its existence, akin to ""everything hitler has done was probably bad"". It's really just a normal country with a vicious regime.     They already proved that it's self sustaining despite everyone thinking it can't possibly be self sustaining. It doesn't run up a debt, it has more export than import, etc. If you can find a modern country that doesn't rely on import/export, it's most likely not a modern country. Another example, despite the horrors of its punishment system, it doesn't even come close to the percentage of its people in that system than the US for example, even though when you're punished, all your relatives come with you.  Countries like that don't raise 50 story buildings without some serious modern education and expertise. They're far from the inefficient country you want to make it out as. It's just that you never hear about those things because people only want to focus on the propaganda ""omg how is this country still existing"" bandwagon, which is on its own quite an interesting political aspect of NK, because as we can see, once a country starts to isolate itself, both sides of the border starts to fill in the blanks with their own ignorance. The country is changing right now, it's becoming more open to economical changes. It's like the soviet union, but 25 years behind. We'll most likely see NK change to a more decent country within our lifetime and then we'll all be scratching our heads thinking, ""wait, I thought this country was beyond help, but all it needed were these few changes to make it look alright?"" Good for them."
NorthKoreaNews,3dhnmk,Dicethrower,2,Sat Jul 18 19:56:59 2015 UTC,"Man, I needed to read your comment. I spent some time in the DPRK a while ago and the responses I've gotten since I came back are full of the kind of ignorance and bias you're getting here. It's incredibly frustrating to hear people boil a nation of millions of hard-working, beautiful people down into a place where literally nothing good can ever happen."
NorthKoreaNews,3dhnmk,glitterlok,-1,Tue Jul 21 04:44:08 2015 UTC,"It is one of the most inefficient countries in the world. It is, however, still a country. Countries need a certain level of organisation to exist. Efficiency is not about having the most; it is about doing the most with what one has.  Not relying on import/export? Check your facts. North Korea exports thousands of tonnes of coal to China every year, along with some machine parts and agricultural produce. In exchange, it imports a massive range of products, from food to medical equipment. Never mind the rice that Russia sent them, the shipments from South Korea, and the aid they beg for with nuclear threats. Pretty much ALL their equipment is Soviet/Russian or Chinese, some left over from the 1970s. Why did the famine happen in the 1990s? Because the USSR stopped supporting their crappy, unsustainable economy. These days, China and sometimes Russia prop them up like a buttress. Understandable, from their geopolitical position, but without their help, North Korea would have to make changes or collapse.  North Korea has about 3 billion dollars debt. Nothing compared to the USA, but to say they have none is bollocks.  As for punishment, North Korea has at best an equal proportion of the population in prison to the USA, with around 200,000 people in kwan-li-so out of about 24 million population. These numbers are partly because so many of them have died or been killed already.  Developed countries do not have their hotels burn down because their fire service lacks the equipment to fight a fire on the 30th floor.  The USSR, for all its problems, was far from the mess we have in the DPRK. They really did make their own stuff, and it sometimes worked. Pretty much no one was starving by the 1960s. Russia also got worse after the USSR fell, before Putin put it back on its feet. The USSR was not beyond help in the 1980s. It did not deserve Yeltsin; few countries do.  The problem with this sub having so few users is that sometimes the only person commenting is an apologist fool."

Like I said ""if hitler did it, it must be bad."" Only idiots can't relevate. Nowhere did I say I was justifying anything.     Developed countries do not have their hotels burn down because their fire service lacks the equipment to fight a fire on the 30th floor.     No country in the world has the ability to fight enormous fires on extreme high levels. Maybe you should look into skyscrapers burned to the ground, by 'normal' fire, in history before you make a comment like that. You'll find that there are plenty of burned down skyscrapers in developed countries."
NorthKoreaNews,3dhnmk,Dicethrower,0,Sat Jul 18 22:36:37 2015 UTC,"Relevate? What do you mean? That is an obscure synonym for ""raise"" or ""lift up"", something which often has more to do with strength than brains. Lifting with machines needs some brains, sure, but it depends what you want to lift.  That skyscraper burned down this year, not years ago in history. Of course the USA had the Great Fire of San Francisco and other disasters, but the great fire happened over 100 years ago. For example, when a tower block in New York caught fire last year, it was dealt with much better than the Koryo Hotel fire, especially given that the block was densely occupied: http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/06/nyregion/fire-at-manhattan-high-rise-injures-two.html?_r=1  You claimed that North Korea is self sufficient when it imported most of its machinery and much of its supplies from China and Russia/USSR. That is the foolish part, because it is factually wrong. It is not foolish to say that North Korea have done some things right at some times.  Of course poorly managed states can get some things right. Hitler built freeways. North Korea has an education system which provides basic skills to most of its people. But pretty much ALL states get some things right, or they could not be states. Poorly managed states just get less right."

NorthKoreaNews,3czhwc,basilarchia,2,Mon Jul 13 03:51:22 2015 UTC,"The soldiers in South Korea know that DPRK soldiers are highly unlikely to be interested in defecting, especially in any significant groups.  Incidents like the infamous Axe Murder Incident, the lesser known Blue House Raid, and many other DMZ incursions over the past 50 years have made it pretty clear that any significant incursion of the DMZ by the DPRK is to be taken as a serious threat and not just a bunch of curious soldiers who would like to see what grocery stores in South Korea look like. They certainly aren't ""potential refugees"".  North Korean civilians are kept far away from the DMZ, and the soldiers that patrol the DMZ are well trained, well fed, and considered some of the most reliable in the DPRK army.  The DMZ is militarized by the south because the DPRK continues to threaten the south, not out of some bizarre desire to aid in DPRK propaganda."

Obama won't have time to do that I guess. At least he managed to do it with Cuba."
NorthKoreaNews,3czhwc,basilarchia,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:16:28 2015 UTC,"The ""oh look how dangerous they are"" defence is not a justification to enforce a DMZ.   The DMZ is enforced because it is the border between two countries that are still technically at war. An armistice was signed in 1953 to stop hostilities until a peace treaty was worked out, and that still has not happened.  In fact North Korea has threatened to withdraw from the armistice no fewer than 6 times. It's precisely because of this behavior by North Korea that the DMZ still exists.   The fact remains that things were starting to normalize and the US went on a blitz to try to keep it from happening.   What on earth are you talking about?  When and how were things starting to normalize?  How did the US try to prevent it? You need to provide facts to back up these extremely far fetched claims.   It would be easy for the SK and the US to apply pressure to bring down the DMZ. Obama won't have time to do that I guess. At least he managed to do it with Cuba.   Either you are completely delusional or you are simply are clueless about the realities of the conflict between North and South Korea.  The Korean situation is completely different from the Cuba one, and there's virtually nothing that Obama can do about it (and neither could any of the presidents during the past 50 years).    North Korea wants to unify with South Korea by completely taking over South Korea and incorporating it into the dictatorship of the North. South Korea, as a sovereign country doesn't want that. Despite being the 48th country in population size North Korea has the 4th largest active duty military, and the largest combined active/reserve military on the planet. The only thing that prevents them from marching their army into South Korea and taking it over is because countries like the US and Japan have made it abundantly clear to North Korea that it would result in a massive retaliation.  North Korea is also very paranoid, and any sort of diplomatic pressure put on the country by the US or any other allies of South Korea would be seen by them as a provocation, and would likely re-ignite the war. That is why no American president is able to peacefully solve the Korean problem."

NorthKoreaNews,3czhwc,Kichigai,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:33:19 2015 UTC,"Attempted invasion, depending on the intent."
NorthKoreaNews,3czhwc,Popcom,4,Sun Jul 12 20:16:13 2015 UTC,I don't think 10 people could count as an invasion regardless of intent.
NorthKoreaNews,3cxft9,Wing_attack_Plan_R,8,Sat Jul 11 17:14:59 2015 UTC,"Have the people of North Korea suddenly woken up, or has this been happening for years and we just hear more about it these days?  I know there have been anti-regime slogans and posters in rural areas over the past 10 years or so and there was a British-style football riot in Pyongyang where ordinary people trashed the stadium, but what else?"
NorthKoreaNews,3cxft9,Eddie_Hitler,6,Sat Jul 11 17:38:07 2015 UTC,i'm sure that their may be other acts of defiance that occur in North Korea that go unreported. the two most recent ones that i can recall was an attempted bombing of a statue of Kim Jong-suk (Kim Il-Sung's first wife) in the city of Hoeryong. The most recent act of defiance occurred a couple of weeks ago when market vendors rioted with authorities in Musan county. news reports that their were deaths and injuries as a result of the fighting ...  http://www.asiapress.org/rimjingang/english/report/2014-05-16/  http://freekorea.us/2015/07/01/daily-nk-massive-brawl-in-musan-market-after-traders-resist-confiscations/  if anyone else knows of acts of defiance please share them
NorthKoreaNews,3cxft9,EdwardRec,5,Sat Jul 11 18:42:15 2015 UTC,I hope their regime will fall soon. At least in the next 10 years. I hope.
NorthKoreaNews,3cxft9,Eddie_Hitler,3,Sat Jul 11 21:21:15 2015 UTC,"I think there's a modest chance.  It sounds like the population are waking up, there's definitely an uptick in information getting in and out of the country, and this could potentially spread into the lower echelons of the military, who are underfed and don't exactly live like kings either.  Kim Jong Un was parachuted into his position without any real consultation or experience and it seems a lot of the top brass don't really think too much of him.  Even on these shaky foundations, he still sees fit to carry out brutal Stalin-esque purges on these people using quite frankly insane methods that wouldn't look out of place in an early Bond movie.  I can't believe there hasn't been a coup attempt of some kind, I bet there have been plenty that were foiled and we just don't know about it.  It's said that Kim Il Sung and his inner circle were physically shaking with fear and worry watching Ceaucescu's demise unfolding on TV back in 1989, because it was clear the same could happen to them."

Being in the military is relatively lucrative because you can collect bribes.  Anyway, I'm not sure a lack of knowledge of the fact that North Korea has poorer material conditions than its neighbors is really the issue here."
NorthKoreaNews,3cxft9,particle_giant,1 point,Sun Jul 12 13:13:53 2015 UTC,"Even on these shaky foundations, he still sees fit to carry out brutal Stalin-esque purges   It's exactly because he lacks support that he organises the purges. If he can't win loyalty through his leadership or his blood, then he'll rule by fear. By purging most of his inner circle, he has demonstrated that nobody is above reproach."
NorthKoreaNews,3cto4i,Wing_attack_Plan_R,2,Fri Jul 10 18:09:05 2015 UTC,"Reddit, what's the truth?"
NorthKoreaNews,3cto4i,agrippaz,2,Sat Jul 11 03:39:55 2015 UTC,We have no idea.
NorthKoreaNews,3cto4i,Stefan_Zhirkov,2,Sat Jul 11 09:46:30 2015 UTC,"Wasn't this pretty much debunked (or at least, considered 'questionable') the day it was reported?  A South Korean newspaper reports someone defected from NK with important data headed for Finland, yet no one in Finland was aware/reporting it."
NorthKoreaNews,3ct5zq,LadyWhortleberry,8,Fri Jul 10 15:55:02 2015 UTC,"Personally I think the fact they titled the piece ""whore cunt's babbling mouth"" is a bit more extreme."
NorthKoreaNews,3ct5zq,RICHUNCLEPENNYBAGS,5,Sat Jul 11 04:09:30 2015 UTC,"They repeatedly accused her of prostitution, as well."
NorthKoreaNews,3ct5zq,Stefan_Zhirkov,3,Sat Jul 11 09:36:40 2015 UTC,"Wow, that has to be the most childish thing I've ever seen. I thought NK media was supposed to be good at having a way with words but for them to resort to straight-up sexist and racist name-calling just shows how utterly garbage their publications are."
NorthKoreaNews,3ctnj4,Destione,7,Fri Jul 10 18:04:57 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but what a piece of shit. His argument is literally that military action will not ""automatically trigger a nuclear holocaust or the annihilation of Seoul"". That's easy to say from your desk in Washington with no skin in the game!   Sure, it ""might"" not escalate, SK ""might"" be fine, but who gets to take that risk when Seoul is one hour away from the border? And to what benefit?"
NorthKoreaNews,3ctnj4,Nero_Tulip,2,Fri Jul 10 23:31:00 2015 UTC,"While I agree that the whole piece isn't necessarily sound, I don't think that's his point. I think the main message is that we shouldn't allow action regarding North Korea to be paralysed by nuclear threats. Indeed we need to be careful, but given the regime's desire to survive, every border skirmish or shots fired between ships at sea shouldn't be tiptoed around with the threat of nuclear war.  We obviously need to be careful when such a regime has nuclear weapons but if they begin to think they can do what they want because of that, it almost becomes more dangerous in some regards."
NorthKoreaNews,3ctnj4,snappypear,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:36:13 2015 UTC,"It's very doubtful that they can send a nuke to Seoul. They can mortar it, but if they did Pyongyang and every base we know about would be obliterated within ten minutes."
NorthKoreaNews,3ctnj4,JFeth,4,Sat Jul 11 01:16:45 2015 UTC,if they did Pyongyang and every base we know about would be obliterated within ten minutes.   Cold comfort to the countless dead.
NorthKoreaNews,3ctnj4,RICHUNCLEPENNYBAGS,0,Sat Jul 11 04:05:11 2015 UTC,That's how war works. Only fools attack first because it gives a reason for the others to hit back harder.
NorthKoreaNews,3ctnj4,JFeth,3,Sat Jul 11 05:50:25 2015 UTC,"Again, I wouldn't find ""that's how war works"" much of a consolation if US officials took actions that led to Seoul being nuked."
NorthKoreaNews,3ctnj4,RICHUNCLEPENNYBAGS,2,Sat Jul 11 13:57:57 2015 UTC,"So, what, we're not gung-ho enough about war with them?  I'd like to see US policymakers more ""paralyzed"" in this way in more places, then."
NorthKoreaNews,3cs67t,jaywalker1982,2,Fri Jul 10 09:53:01 2015 UTC,"This is how he may be overthrown, but I am not predicting anything here. Most likely he will still be here next year.  I would disagree with defection over obedience being the result of slipping regime control. It may also be borne from terror of punishment prompting the defector to risk all and flee."

NorthKoreaNews,3cpjwq,Wing_attack_Plan_R,2,Thu Jul 9 19:16:29 2015 UTC,"Why wouldn't they?  If they have powerful biological weapons of mass destruction... it's legitimate military threat that the rest of the world should take seriously.  Such weapons could potentially be as deadly as several nuclear warheads -- and the payload may be easier to deliver.  So if they did actually publish these pictures and the threat can be confirmed (publicly or privately) by government scientists... then it's basically a way for the North Korean government to simultaneously say ""Don't fuck with us,"" and ""Now, what kind of deal did we have again?""      NK was already capable of leveling Seoul with it's conventional rockets.  If they have a powerful biological weapon... the threat is amplified greatly.  Or... do you think they wouldn't develop biological weapons of mass destruction?"
NorthKoreaNews,3cpjwq,NihiloZero,2,Fri Jul 10 03:51:09 2015 UTC,"They have not ratified the convention, either, unlike the USSR, who developed them anyway."
NorthKoreaNews,3cpjwq,Stefan_Zhirkov,2,Fri Jul 10 07:04:56 2015 UTC,"Ratified conventions don't mean a thing here. Just look at the Chinese policy on North Korean refugees. China signed the Refugee Convention, but they still send them back to North Korea, violating the agreement."
NorthKoreaNews,3cpjwq,jaywalker1982,2,Fri Jul 10 09:55:57 2015 UTC,Indeed. I already gave the Soviet example of breaking the BWC.
NorthKoreaNews,3cpjwq,Stefan_Zhirkov,2,Fri Jul 10 14:26:41 2015 UTC,"At this point it seems counter-productive to even have talks with North Korea about anything. One eventual outcome could be NK dragging out a long negotiation and then walk away from the table with no deal or progress made, or a second possibility being NK agree and make a deal for aid but in reality never even come remotely close to abiding by the agreement."
NorthKoreaNews,3cpjwq,jaywalker1982,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:24:05 2015 UTC,"Just make sure that the aid only comes if they reasonably follow the conditions, allowing it to be cut off at any time."
NorthKoreaNews,3cpjwq,Stefan_Zhirkov,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:39:50 2015 UTC,I cant remember the name of it but I watched a documentary showing how hard it was to get NK to let aid come into parts of the country. Many locations hit hardest during the Arduous March were never given aid (places in the North-East like Hoeryong) and NK demanded complete control of the aid and little to no oversight. The same aid that ended up in the jangmadang being sold. There were also shops selling medicine donated by the World Health Organization.
NorthKoreaNews,3cpjwq,jaywalker1982,2,Sat Jul 11 01:46:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly at that point, wouldn't the Chinese do something about it? It would destabilize the region and possibly pull China into an unnecessary war to keep the stupid buffer state. Thoughts?"
NorthKoreaNews,3cpjwq,inthebrilliantblue,3,Fri Jul 10 04:03:50 2015 UTC,"The problem with very powerful weapons (even if the nation wielding them can be defeated) is the damage that will be done if the possessor is put at risk in some way.    So, what can China be expected to do?  If North Korea is destabilized... the leadership may choose to lash out before the problem gets completely out of hand.  All you need is to have the military personnel sufficiently brainwashed and materially satisfied.  And such things are possible despite how unthinkable they may seem to you or I."

NorthKoreaNews,3cgi3d,darthgarlic,0,Wed Jul 8 18:21:17 2015 UTC,Actually it couldn't. Michigan was converted to a non-nuclear cruise missile bus nearly a decade ago.
NorthKoreaNews,3cgi3d,Cyrius,0,Thu Jul 9 04:15:33 2015 UTC,The payload is different than the delivery method.  Even underway I didn't know what we carried in each tube and you don't either.
NorthKoreaNews,3cgi3d,darthgarlic,0,Thu Jul 9 18:09:27 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter what payload you put on it, a Tomahawk doesn't have the range to hit North Korea from Washington state. Not that there are any nuclear-equipped Tomahawks, they've all been retired."
NorthKoreaNews,3cgi3d,Cyrius,-1,Thu Jul 9 18:34:30 2015 UTC,"You know full well by my comment that I was referring to the payload not the range in my last comment and that I replied to your nuclear comment.
