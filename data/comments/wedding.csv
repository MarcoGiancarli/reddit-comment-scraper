wedding,3e2qag,WeDigGiantRobots,31,Tue Jul 21 14:37:22 2015 UTC,"I think it is a good idea! If you want, you can check out their registry to find colors to match/coordinate. If they have a bedspread picked out, for example, that is purple and grey it gives you something to coordinate to. Or a kitchen towel set that is yellow. Bath towels that are blue. You get the idea."
wedding,3e2qag,pleatedmeat,5,Tue Jul 21 15:00:41 2015 UTC,"Well, if there's a registry, they certainly haven't let me know, but I'll definitely give that a shot - thanks for the advice...!"

I like the thought of matching it to their registry somehow. Or maybe paint the bride and groom dancing together as a ""first dance"" painting. If you do that, maybe you can ask the bride to send you a shot of her in her dress and ask what kind of suit he will be wearing. I would love something like that."
wedding,3e2qag,AlbiesDad,3,Tue Jul 21 15:17:42 2015 UTC,I think the first dance idea is amazing. I would have loved that.
wedding,3e2qag,blkmagick,14,Tue Jul 21 16:49:16 2015 UTC,I think its a great idea. Some friends of mine have a huge painting hung in there dining room which was a wedding present from the girl who painted it.  Who wants a blender or a set of towels! Id rather a one off painting that nobody else has!   Plus when you become famous it might be worth millions!!!!!

You're obviously talented and it would be something personal that they could have forever. If I were you, I'd try to make it a painting of them as that might be more appreciated and wedding specific. Also, unless you're bringing this to a shower, I'd give them a card at the wedding and bring the painting to their house afterwards. I'm sure the couple is very happy to have such a thoughtful friend.  Edit: OMG I've always missed my cake day... but it's today!!"

wedding,3e2qag,Love_Trust_Hope,3,Tue Jul 21 15:43:16 2015 UTC,"I love the paintings. That said, there are a lot of things I love that just would not have a place in my apartment because they don't match whats already there. Taste is very personal.   On the other hand, if it were a smaller picture, it would be much easier to find a place for it as opposed to something the size of my couch. Something that large (and nice) would be a statement piece that I would think the room would have to be decorated around. But something small I would be less concerned about whether or not it matches everything."
wedding,3e2qag,schlahdeedah,3,Tue Jul 21 19:32:25 2015 UTC,"Are your friends they type of people who would like that kind of thing? If they have expressed interest and appreciation for your artwork in ways that indicate they might like it in their home (and not just a general appreciation of talent, which you definitely have) then go for it! Or find ways to subtly ask if that would be the kind of thing they'd like.   I'm an artist myself, and I have been given artwork before as gifts, which is on one hand very thoughtful but I am also incredibly picky about the theming of my rooms, and the prints are currently sitting, carefully wrapped and preserved, in the closet until I can figure out something to do with them. They would totally be in my wheelhouse if I could use them as a background on my desktop or something, but my home decor style is very different.   And, as is said numerous times on wedding forums like these, don't think that getting things on the registry is boring. They're on there for a reason, and in reality the registry items might get used/ is more needed at the moment than a personalized gift. I got my SIL towels and sheets for her wedding, which she said were the most appreciated items they had gotten because they moved cross-country the day after the wedding and I had it shipped directly to their new address, the rest of their stuff didn't get in till a week later so they were at least able to put something on the air mattress and take showers."

Take your appraisal you got from the jeweler into your local agents office and they will add it to your policy. It's really cheap I think my premium went up 60 bucks a year for a 7k ring, definitely worth it"

wedding,3e2prg,macbrooke,4,Tue Jul 21 14:53:26 2015 UTC,"Also added mine to my renters policy! Added $40 to my yearly premium for a ~$5K ring. Keep in mind that adding to your policy typically covers everything (if you lose the ring or a diamond falls out). If you purchase insurance through the jeweler, there is typically a stipulation that you need to get the prongs inspected every 6 months to keep your full coverage. I don't have that stipulation on my renters policy."

If the bride wants consistency in the bridal party's shoes, maybe suggest that she pick a color and general style (like nude, open toed heels) and have the bridesmaids get what works for them in that range."

wedding,3e30uf,nymeria88,5,Tue Jul 21 16:14:25 2015 UTC,Just ask her. Say something about the dress and ask what type of shoes she is looking at to go with it. Then you will know if she is thinking everyone gets the same or you get your own.

I have actually been able to wear those shoes multiple times, as opposed to the wedding where the bride chose our shoes. They were actually nice shoes from Nine West, but not a style or color I would choose to wear and they have since gone to Goodwill."
wedding,3e30uf,TheFutureMrs77,4,Tue Jul 21 16:17:28 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the bride. For my bff's wedding, she picked out the shoes we had to wear. For my cousin's wedding, we were allowed any type of shoe as long as it was dye-able, and all the shoes were dyed the same color. For my wedding, I'm telling my girls to wear any kind of nude shoe they want (my hope being that they already have a pair of nude shoes)."

Nothing worse than having all your maids sidelined on the dancefloor because they're blistering.  Well, there ARE worse things, but it would still be sad."
wedding,3e30uf,nicogor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:30:38 2015 UTC,"Every wedding I've been in, I've been given a guideline.  One bride said our shoes had to be from payless's wedding line and gave us the color  but we could pick the style.  Another the bride basically told us to get shoes that match the dress.  I already had a pair that I shared with the bride to ok...she did and then the others decided to follow my suit (they didn't have to.) The others we were told a color and to get whatever.  I chose the color for my bridesmaids (beige) but am allowing them to pick whatever style they want.  I'd just suggest you ask the bride on her opinion.  If she has none start looking and then if you find something you like, share it with her.  If she has an opinion you don't foresee working for you or everybody, let her know but also let her know you're willing to buy the shoes regardless."

With the planning, do you have any family or friends in the area where youre getting married?  Heres what ive been doing: I pick a thing, lets say venue. I go to weddingwire.com and I look up ""hotel wedding venues in XX, Florida"" Fiance and I agreed we wanted a hotel venue for a bunch of reasons, so talk to your fiance about what you need. (We needed ceremony and reception in one place and a hotel is ideal because many of our guests are traveling, so no additional transportation costs to the venue!)  Pick a bunch and request information. You can do it straight from weddingwire. Put in pertinent info like how many guests, if its formal, things you specifically want, etc.   One by one they will email you pricing and whats included. Some you will know off the bat that its not what you want or too expensive or whatever. Narrow it down to 3ish. Call the venue and speak with the person there. See if you like the person and think theyd work well with you. Do they understand what youre looking for? Have they worked with out of town brides, etc.  Yay you have 3 possible venues!! At this point, you should have maybe put in an hour or 2of work, browsing online, requesting pricing.  An hour more comparing pricing and packages, and showing that info and pics to.Fiance to see if he has any opinions.   Its at this point that your local family will be useful! I asked my mom to.go.look at the 3 venues in person, ask a bunch of questions, and take pictures. She did, and sent me the pics and her opinions.   This took probably around 5-6 hours total of my moms time to see all 3. She LOVED being involved, and her seeing them helped. I picked one and we did the contract via email. I love the coordinator at my venue, she is always happy to talk and answer questions, and shes worked with tobs of brides out of.town.   Rinse and repeat for all vendors. Ive sent my mom to 3 previously narrowed down venues and 2 florists. (DJ and photographer I picked without her help)  Also, if you have friends in NJ, ask for referrals. Ive had my bff go ask all the married people she worked with who their DJ was. Referrals are awesome.   Ive honestly found planning from far away to.be less stressful. Its all.done in email, so I can go over info in my own time and disseminate the info given. I make a decision, sign a contract, and move on.   Fiance and I are scheduled to fly down to florida ONE TIME between engagement and wedding. We are doing ONE long weekend in sept, and meeting all vendors in person, the catering tasting, and cake tasting. And thats it.   Wedding vendors know what they're doing. Read their reviews, look at pics, and talk to them to.get a feeling of personality. Its easier than you think. Just take it one step at a time.   Unless you mean a ""true"" destination wedding, like out of the country. Then I recommend booking a location (like a resort) that have all-inclusive wedding packages for an all in one no stress deal.  Hope this is at all helpful."

We are trying to find a good spot, so far looking heavily into Turks and Caicos.  But you sound like you got this down! I've been using tripadvisor so far but will definitely try this weddingwire  Thanks for the in depth response, i appreciate it. hope your wedding rocks!"
wedding,3e0v3c,jyssrocks,2,Tue Jul 21 03:51:55 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  As a side note, if youre doing it in the Caribbean, people do weddings out there all the time. Hotels and resorts there will have all inclusive wedding packages and will know everything you need. Dojt do tripadvisor, just call the nice hotels and resorts in the area you choose (after checking out their wedding package pricing on their websites and narrowing it down to a couple you like) and speak to their coordinator. Go with the one you feel you like best in personality and ""gets"" you and what you want.   Those all in 1packages are hella convenient.  Also, be super understanding that a lot of guests wont be able to come bc of the cost to them (flights, hotels, etc) and dont expect gifts from those who do."

So far they've been extremely friendly, helpful, and quick to respond. They have connections with several resorts, which can help get some additional perks. Oh, and their services are free - or, rather, likely included in the cost of what they tell you the package costs. Good luck!"
wedding,3e0v3c,SalutLeMonde,2,Tue Jul 21 14:10:34 2015 UTC,"We're doing a destination wedding as well and let me tell you...the best thing you can do for yourselves and your sanity is to look into a hassle free travel agent! We're looking into Cancun right now and our agent is amazing. Her name is Amy Lewis and she's over at Beach Bum Vacations. I was looking into the popular one everyone recommends: Destinationweddings.com, but they charged some kind of $50 deposit just to look for you....which I didn't love. So beachbum I went!      She's insanely thorough and can absolutely be reached whenever. I'm not even kidding...I've even gotten emails from her at 1am one night when I couldn't sleep and I had a thought about a venue and popped it over to her that late...and sure enough, I got a response from her SO FAST.     I think the real advantage is the fact that these agents have already developed relationships with so many resorts so they're able to offer you quite a lot of kickbacks and better contract terms. And if you have any special requests (Ie: Catholic Church onsite) They are able to really weed through the hundreds of resorts for you and only show you the ones that have that. So you're usually talking to someone who has had first hand experience at that hotel as well as someone who knows about all the little specials/deals. Like for us, there were some great ""Bridal Trial Run"" deals that she informed us of, and group booking specials and how to really get the most bang for your buck. I'd look into it if I were you, I really hated the whole process before I found her and if I would do anything different...it would be to have gone to them first before doing so much research solo, which really just resulted in my wanting to rampage everywhere. LOL"
wedding,3e0v3c,Beanpod79,2,Tue Jul 21 04:36:18 2015 UTC,We're getting married at a Sandals resort in the Bahamas. Less than a month to go. Let me know if you have specific questions. Happy to help :)
wedding,3e0v3c,skuttle64,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:55:24 2015 UTC,I'm not the OP but we are considering a beaches wedding and sandals honeymoon!  How was your experience?  I think I'm most curious about the photographer and how pictures turned out. Which resort was yours at?
wedding,3e0v3c,Beanpod79,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:17:10 2015 UTC,"Not married yet (just under a month to go), but planning for everything was a breeze. As far as photography goes, they have portfolios of the photographers they use on the site. They also offer different style packages as well as format packages. You can't guarantee which photographer will be available on your day, but for me, they all looked relatively good so we just kind of have to cross our fingers and hope for the best. I'm not looking for phenomenal pictures, we just want a few nice, mostly candid shots so we're cool with winging it. We're getting married at Sandals Emerald Bay."

wedding,3e0m3q,bridesservant,9,Tue Jul 21 01:12:42 2015 UTC,"I can't say what is right for you, especially as its just one month out.  I do think she's been rather thoughtless and inconsiderate based on the info you have here.  I would definitely back out of the cake issue at this point.   Just explain as you did here that she hadn't responded to your earlier queries so you assumed she went with another option and have now booked other projects that will not allow you to have enough time to dedicate to making the cake."
wedding,3e0m3q,MissCarlotta,5,Tue Jul 21 15:38:58 2015 UTC,"I have been in a VERY similar situation as you although I wasn't a month out before I backed out. Honestly, being so close to the wedding...and speaking from the perspective of someone who's been in both shoes...as everyone has said...this is a tough decision. But IMO, I would say that first...do not do the cake. It would be awful for your business to back out on existing orders...and that WILL be something that bites you in the butt later.  If you want, spin it that you want to make her the best cake possible and that's just not going to happen with all the other commitments you have.  As for still being a bridesmaid....being a month out...I think dropping out would be shitty on your part. Yes...she's been pretty shitty herself...but yea. IDK. Honestly, it really comes down to....is she worth it for you?   Say you drop out. There's a good chance she'll probably drop you in general...from the wedding and her friendship altogether...so the question becomes: Is that ok with you?"

wedding,3e0m3q,Moreliana,0,Tue Jul 21 21:15:51 2015 UTC,"If you can't do the cake tell her that asap. The way you explained it here is perfect. It isn't confrontational, it's just facts. I expect she put it off too long and now that she's down to crunch time she's trying to fill in the blanks and is doing a poor job of it.   Stag and doe issue is a little bizarre... what are the other bridal party members contributing? Why does it seem to be just you that's on the hook for all of these costs? For stuff like that, the cost is typically split. I would either reach out to the other bridal party members and say bridesmaid 1 you're in charge of x, bridesmaid 2 you're in charge of y, and so on OR just say ""I understand that you want this event to be amazing but I'm already spending 300 and I don't feel comfortable/able spending more.""   As for the not caring about your boyfriend thing... it is shitty of her but I would cut her a bit of slack. We all get a little nutso when we plan weddings. It's so hard not to get wrapped up in yourself/your wedding when you're excited about it and the most important people in your life are also excited in it. That doesn't make it right but wedding brain is a real thing! I swear it is!   In conclusion. She doesn't aound like a great friend overall but she does sound very wrapped up in all things wedding and I expect she isn't thinking clearly about the things she's saying and doing. My MOH is typically the nicest and most caring person in the world but she was a straight up bitch throughout the month prior to and during the wedding weekend. My suggestion would be to stand your ground in terms of how much you're willing to spend on their party, gently but firmly explain that making her cake isn't doable now, and try not to take anything personally at this time. If she continues to be a rude and suck person after the wedding you can at least say you tried."

We all knew each other from high school, and he watch our friendship, then relationship grow.   He was already ordained from doing his sister's wedding a few years ago. For our state, it was very easy to get ordained.   We asked him to prepare most of the ceremony, based on the guidelines we gave him. One of the being that it is a minimum of 5 minutes, a max of 10.   I don't have anything extra. If in your state the person has to pay for the license, I would offer to pay for the fee."

Don't know about you, but when I go to a wedding all i can think about is those two having sex in their wedding attire. Our friend doing the ceremony must have had the same problem.

wedding,3dxfy3,gbunny,6,Mon Jul 20 09:44:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly yeah, it does look like it needs a bit of work. It all depends on how kept up you'd like to look as opposed to the kind of rustic look it now has. Cleaning up will be another chore on top of planning the actual wedding, plus it'll cost money. It may be just as expensive as finding another location in better condition, and if you if another it's that much less to stress about. It's all about what you're willing to pay, financially and emotionally."
wedding,3dxfy3,pyre42,2,Mon Jul 20 12:05:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for your reply, you are absolutely right - it is a matter of getting a concrete vision, and assessing its feasibility against what we will be working with (the owner said they are doing some minor works, so we will visit again at the end of this year). I am quite big on the outer areas, which are currently quite bare. Flowers and bushes and what not - at least in the areas that we should utilise for the reception. I don't know how much gardening they are planning to do, but it should be a lot to fit my eden garden ideas!!!"
wedding,3dxfy3,pyre42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:45:15 2015 UTC,"Just remember it's not your place either, paying to have the grass fixed or things like that may benefit you for the day but it's improving the owner's property, he should be paying for essentials like that. Like I said, it's about either rehabilitating that place or adding to someplace that already has a lot of the basics done. Landscaping is costly and unpredictable. My fiancé has been trying to practice her make up for the day and learn about how it will reflect in the pictures, it's discouraging and expensive, all that she's accomplished so far is feeling worse about herself. We've decided that no matter the cost it's worth it to pay a makeup artist and lift some that burden off her. Sometimes trying to save a buck can cost you more than you think. Good luck!"

Its exciting because you think its a gift but them bam its money and everyone deep down wants money...Also if you are strapped for cash 100$ or even 50$ is more than acceptable don't break the bank for the wedding.

We ideally want to have 25 people, but all of her necessary propound bring the guest list to 48. So this wave thing is our solution. If 25 of our most important guests can come, then we'll send out the next 8 invites or so (and so on). Our rationale being that if everyone declined the invite we wouldn't want to be stuck with my FMIL's random siblings. If rather have those siblings be 6 out of 48 people than 20 people...do you see what I'm saying? It's hard to explain. But imagine if everyone declined the destination wedding invite except for our parents and my FMIL's siblings - that would make us feel so uncomfortable bc we barely know them! So if only our parents wind up coming then we won't even send the invite out to the people at the end of the list. See? Ugh I'm bad at explaining this"

wedding,3dvq2x,erin_mouse88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:50:49 2015 UTC,"When we cut back out wedding, we cut it down to just parents, grand parents, god parents, and siblings. It stinks that we won't have any friends there, but it was easier than picking a few. And we're just having a bbq for everyone else later so it'll be chill. Otherwise we were in the same boat."

wedding,3dw7ha,lobstersadist,3,Mon Jul 20 01:20:29 2015 UTC,"I went the ""iPod"" route for music. For the first dance announcement, entrances for the wedding party, announcements of the toasts etc, I just enlisted a close family friend to do all that. If you have someone whom you wanted to include in the wedding but didn't have room for in the ceremony, I would ask them to do it."
wedding,3dw7ha,Idontknowflycasual,2,Mon Jul 20 01:59:05 2015 UTC,"My friends did a DJ-less reception.  They bought their own speakers and used an ipod with pre-selected music.  Then we (the bridal party) each DJ'ed a part of the wedding.  For instance, one of us announced the first dance, another the cake cutting, etc.  It worked out pretty ok BUT there were a few hiccups.  The couple pre-set the list into sections.  We each knew what our ""cue"" song was and then we could go up, stop the playlist, do our bit, and then start the next section.  A few guests decided they didn't like the songs playing and went up and started sorting through the ipod.  I caught on pretty quick and went up and had to tell them no and why.  Not a huge deal and you could always keep the ipod locked.  The other issue was with the speakers.  When we set up the reception area we didn't think to test the speakers out.  They were not pointed towards the guest so you couldn't hear ANYONE (we had microphones).  I know you said you aren't allowed speakers but no matter what you decide remember to test everything.  It was too late for us to attempt to fix it when we figured out no one could hear anything.    edit: my then fiance did the announcing of the bridal party."
wedding,3dw7ha,nicogor,2,Mon Jul 20 02:15:35 2015 UTC,"Just from a perspective as a performer, I've done a solo gig playing acoustic and singing for a very small group at a work party in a park and I needed a PA system to be heard. One speaker that was made to be outdoors, with a battery pack. Particularly with any sort of wind around, sound travels very badly outdoors so amplification - even low volume - is pretty important in an outdoor open space. Hope that helps at all!"
wedding,3dw7ha,vitalmorgans,2,Mon Jul 20 02:42:07 2015 UTC,One idea is to pause the music and have one of your groomsmen/bridesmaids introduce the couple or do a small speech before the dance?  Also consider hiring maybe a harpist for the ceremony? A little pricier but they are so gorgeous!

wedding,3dw8bp,viley,2,Mon Jul 20 01:28:02 2015 UTC,"My only possible criticism is that much of the beginning involves you. It's not that it's inappropriate, but it seems a bit off-topic for a toast to the wedding couple.   If you do decide to cut something, look there."
wedding,3dw8bp,SilverSealingWax,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:17:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for your feedback! I was actually worried about that too. My sister and I shared a long history together, so of course most of my memories were of the two of us, but I feel like a wedding speech should focus more on the bride, so I'll definitely take note on that. Thanks!"

Some people might not get it, but you're saying it for your sister, not for anyone else, really.  It's really sweet you two are so close :)  It didn't take me very long to read, so I'm sure when you're speaking in front of people it will sound even shorter, which is good.  I love it!"

I've always been told not to go outside your personality and try to force jokes. I'm not a naturally funny person like some, but I didn't want the speech to looking like I was trying to hard to be cutesy or funny. I appreciate your feedback :)"
wedding,3dtxpj,Eng1N3rd,16,Sun Jul 19 12:55:23 2015 UTC,"When he or she  makes you more ""you"" and not less ""you"". When you have dated enough to learn what you want and what you don't. And, when you are ready.  Dump the checklist, imho."
wedding,3dtxpj,cdavisnyc,7,Sun Jul 19 18:02:15 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with the ""when you've dated enough"" point. I knew with my man from date #2 that if I kept dating him, we would end up married. I was kind of enjoying dating at the time, and was dating a few guys (he 100% knew we weren't exclusive), but a few weeks later I just totally fell for him and stopped seeing other people. And then a couple weeks later I asked if he wanted to be exclusive with me.  About a year later, I still KNOW he's the one. And he knows I am too. It's everything from our values to our goals to our shared interests. I was with my last SO for about 3 years, and (like another point you made) I never really noticed but he made me less ME. And I've been super cognizant of being ME through this relationship because of that. He can be him and I can be me and we're both in this cozy nest of him being him and me being me and us also being us together and it's just so lovely."

wedding,3dtxpj,cdavisnyc,2,Sun Jul 19 20:00:57 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. A checklist makes you look to put people into a box, and then disqualify them if they don't fit. It's a good way to miss out on truly unique and special people..."
wedding,3dtxpj,JZ4250,16,Sun Jul 19 19:23:40 2015 UTC,"My mom knew before I did. I'd told her about maybe 7 previous guys in college and each one she said ""let's not tell your father about this one.""  A guy I'd only been flirting with for a day or two met me on campus for coffee in January. I told him my boots had holes in them and my feet were cold  and soaked but that I was too cheap and lazy to get new ones. We chat about other things, he says he has errands to run before his next class... can he met me in a few hours?  He comes back 2 hours later having bought me a pair of boots.  I told my mom when I got home that day. When she hung up she turned to my dad and told him ""JZ met a man, today. I think this might be the one.""  I think for me it was a couple of months later when he woke me up to tell me about a dream he had (for the umpteenth time in a row) and I said ""I like you, I really do but if you wake me up again before I need to get up for anything other than an emergency I might cry or strangle you.""  Instead of taking offense or saying ""I shouldn't have to change"" he started letting me sleep in until I needed to get up, and would wake me up with breakfast ready. It was the first time I envisioned ""forever"" with a guy. 4.5 years later and he still does it."

He had been the only person who ever loved me unconditionally, supported me, encouraged me.  He never judged me.  If I had a problem, dad could solve it.  If something broke, dad could fix it.  If I was sad, dad could cheer me up.  Skip ahead to June 2013.  I went on a date with this guy.  He was really nice, cute, funny.  We became exclusive and started spending every last second of the day together.  We were obsessed with each other.  I moved in with him in August 2013.  In September 2013 I had to have surgery for a heart defect.  It started at 7am, and I didn't leave the hospital until 8pm.  Even though I had only know this guy for 3 months, he insisted on being there for the whole thing.  He only left my side when I was taken into operation.  He sat in that waiting room all day with my parents and as soon as he was allowed back into my room, he never budged from my side.  I was terrified of having massive heart surgery.  I was sure I was going to die.  And the only person in the world I wanted by my side was him.  Not my dad.  Him.    That's when I knew."

Over that weekend, something just clicked. We just worked. From that point forward, I just knew.

I was driving because he had broken his ribs in a snowboarding accident and I  had already had a red bull to wake me up. We were on a country road and passed a paddock filled with baby cows, and  I went all gooey and said 'Aww look at all the babies! ' in a little kids voice. He turned to me,  smiled,  tucked a strand of hair behind my ear and said 'you can tell someone's  has a redbull  this morning'!

wedding,3dtf3u,MidWestJoke,4,Sun Jul 19 07:34:13 2015 UTC,"Hello! My fiancée and I met ballroom dancing! We have competed and taught, so hopefully I can help.  We put on a lot of social dances using modern music. It would often frustrate traditional ballroom dancers who were used to dancing to perfectly timed songs, but the newer music using popular artists was really great. This can be difficult, since a song like Crazy in Love doesn't have the beats audible in every measure. Hopefully you both can hear and count the music.  Crazy in Love has four beats per measure with an up and down beat alternating. While it may not fit perfectly into the ballroom world, I would say you could work with any of these dances: Rumba, Bolero, or Nightclub 2 Step.  There are lots of great songs out there and great dances, too! I hope this helps and feel free to ask questions."

wedding,3ds0w8,lukeswalton,22,Sat Jul 18 22:14:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is generally considered tacky (but this really depends on where you're from, too). Mainly because you're hosting a party, so you should FULLY host it... you wouldn't make you guests pay for food, right? Plus, I know in my state cash bars are illegal for non business related events. Again, totally a regional thing.   Do you want/need alcohol? Could you offer just soft drinks or a fun lemonade or something to help cut costs? I think guests are more offended by having to pay than you not offering any alcohol period."
wedding,3ds0w8,ReverseWalrus,8,Sun Jul 19 00:09:59 2015 UTC,"First of all, welcome! <3   If the venue had a bar established in it, it would be more understanding if you had a cash bar (because the venue charges for drinks already). Because you're providing the drinks yourself I feel that a cash bar would not be well received.  I know you said the plan is only to have beer and wine, so try to limit it to 2 options of each type. This way you can buy in bulk to save money, instead of buying smaller amounts of various types of alcohol."
wedding,3ds0w8,maznyk,6,Sun Jul 19 14:24:30 2015 UTC,"I think cash bars are a-ok if you are hiring a bar tender (and you let your guests know.  I was just at a wedding where no one was told it was a cash bar and the atm wasn't working at the venue.)  BUT if you aren't hiring anyone and proving yourself, I would absolutely think that's tacky to ask your guests to pay."
wedding,3ds0w8,nicogor,2,Mon Jul 20 01:29:08 2015 UTC,"If you are hiring a bartender then I personally wouldn't be opposed to a cash bar, but if it's self serve or someone from the wedding doing the serving  I would find that strange.  BUT saying that I'm from the UK where a Cash Bar is normal for weddings and parties....  Is it not cheaper to provide your own than it would cost for an open bar at a location that already has a bar? If there was a bar included, would you still consider a cash bar or would you do open bar?  As for buying beer and wine, find wines and beers you can buy by the case (usually 2 whites, 2 reds and 4 types of beer) and buy in bulk. You will find some companies will refund for any cases of wine (12 bottles) or beer (24 bottles) that are left. That way you can over anticipate without being stuck with a butt load at the end."
wedding,3ds0w8,erin_mouse88,2,Sun Jul 19 13:46:33 2015 UTC,"We absolutely do not want an open bar. If the venue had a bar and bartender I would have them charge whatever their normal rates are. Every wedding I've been to, this has been the norm. But they don't have one, so we have to provide the alcohol. I like the freedom this gives us to choose what kinds of beers we have (we are both craft beer fans) but I don't understand why I should be forced into having an open bar simply because of where the alcohol came from. It's not like we're pocketing our friends money. The cash made at the bar is going to be less than we paid for the bartender and alcohol."
wedding,3ds0w8,erin_mouse88,2,Sun Jul 19 14:58:39 2015 UTC,"Who will be serving the alcohol? I'd recommend hiring someone (bartenders I know would probably do it for around $10 per hour) so it seems less DIY?  I think $2 for beer and anywhere up to $5 for wine is acceptable - still a lot cheaper than most places!  And having craft beers would be a really nice touch. Standard bars are nice but they don't have the same soul, all have the same rubbish beer!"
wedding,3ds0w8,erin_mouse88,2,Sun Jul 19 18:23:25 2015 UTC,"We hired an outside bartender! It's not self serve, nor will one of my friends or family be serving. It'll be really professional, and I'd say if not for the choices in beer we will have, I don't think anyone would even know we were supplying it."
wedding,3ds0w8,erin_mouse88,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:33:49 2015 UTC,"In that case, I'd definitely not find it poor etiquette or rude to charge.

I've been to 4 weddings in the past 3 years and all had cash bars, but free soda and tea. Its such a controversial topic. I think it should be up to the bride and groom; if they can afford it, then by all means! I'm a full time college student and part time worker. I can't afford to give alcohol to 100 people!"

I don't think it's a bad thing to have a cash bar. I paid for your food, this dance, and this beautiful venue. If you want to get drunk too, you can pay for it. Why does that make me a bad person? It's so silly to me."

Are there even places that just have drinks sitting out?? I see that other comments say that it would be okay to charge if they had a bartender and they aren't getting downvoted. I guess I wouldn't have thought of not having anyone serving the drinks lol, that's what I get for assuming."
wedding,3ds0w8,ElderflowerGin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:49:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure where you are living, but in Colorado (US) it seems to be expected that weddings will have an open bar or at least drink vouchers.  We also provided our own alcohol and I was definitely worried people would go nuts, but fortunately they didn't. There are a couple of liquor stores in the area who buy back unopened liquor, and so we went with one of them, provided 4 types of wine and 2 types of beer and did not charge our guests.  While this will be an unpopular opinion, I personally would encourage you not to charge your guests. You are throwing the wedding reception to celebrate with the people you love, and the people who love you. Most of these people are bringing gifts for you anyway, so I'd say bite the bullet and buy them their drinks. They'll have a better time and depending on what else you have (dancing, patio games etc..) people may not drink as much as you think anyway.  In regards for how much to buy, check out:  http://www.thealcoholcalculator.com http://apracticalwedding.com/2013/01/calculate-alcohol-for-wedding/   The first seems to have more relevance to you as you said you have more beer drinkers."

These have a huge variety of activities (more on the outdoorsy side) that may help inform your honeymoon planning.   I also recommend Momondo for flights! It compares all the options on your travel dates for the cheapest option without the weird expenses of an expedia or travelocity type site.  You won't need a visa or anything to visit, so booking 4-6 months in advance is plenty (I prefer to do things way in advance, so this might even be on the long end).

We stayed on daydream island in the whitsundays where my fiance proposed to me it was absolutely beatiful and the great barrier reef is one of my favourite places!

They had a harder time getting up/down the stairs, and there were less places to sit downstairs. So I would just be mindful of that! That said, I had a wonderful time and it didn't bother me in the slightest."

Our venue does have an elevator for anyone who can't do the stairs, but the one person we're inviting who can't do stairs is likely not coming, so it doesn't really matter.   As long as you don't foresee a physical issue for any guests I think it will be fine."

Having dinner upstairs then moving down for cake etc will ensure that there is a party going on. Also, I am making sure to have lots of chairs on the side so people can sit if they want :)"

Alcohol has to be on the ground floor as well (no beer kegs allowed upstairs) so I guess that's where I'm having cocktail hour as well...I'm a little worried about grandparents and the stairs, but their is a chairlift that we can have made available for the night.

wedding,3drgd6,Miss_Squidgey,8,Sat Jul 18 19:11:47 2015 UTC,"I've heard of a lot of people picking a length, color, and type of fabric from David's Bridal and then allowing all the girls to pick whatever they like best.  So, say your dress is chiffon, your color is blue, and your party is pretty formal. Tell the girls you want them in a long dress, with chiffon fabric, in the color Malibu. They can easily do a search with these criteria. You could also add things like, straps required (or not allowed), or whatever.  The hardest part with picking dresses for people in such a wide age range is that their shapes are BOUND to be totally different. What flatters a 12 year old probably won't look great on your older friends."
wedding,3drgd6,TheDukesMistress,2,Sat Jul 18 19:19:34 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem.  I have 7 bridesmaids (I know, its a lot), and they're all completely different body types.  I'm talking size 0 up to size 18, ages 18 to 30, and all living in different places.  Since our wedding colors are black white and gold, I just told them black and long and am letting them choose their own dress.  I told them I prefer a silkier fabric to a chiffon fabric and am letting them all do their own thing.    I'm also going to gift them all gold earrings, gold clutches and gold shoes.  Their hair will all be up in the same type of style.  So, even though their dresses will all be different, they'll all still look pretty uniform."

wedding,3drm8p,erin_mouse88,4,Sat Jul 18 20:01:50 2015 UTC,"American getting married to a Brit in the UK checking in - I definitely get the confusion!  I can't help you with everything, but...  • Unity sand ceremonies or candle ceremonies, I understand the symbolism but to most of us Brits it's a bit cheesy.   That's definitely a newer trend, and one I find cheesy, too. It's not traditional.  • When do you sign the marriage licence? We do this as part of the ceremony.  It depends on the couple. My brother and sister in law signed the paperwork right before the ceremony and mailed it in, if that helps? It's usually not done during the ceremony in my experience.  • Why do so many Americans seem to be offended by a cash bar? I understand if the majority pay a lot for flights and accommodation such as for a destination wedding (we will probably do an open bar for this reason) but if the majority of guests live nearby then it's not like it's a financial burden. It would save us over $2000!  This is regional, I've learned on this board. But I'm from the east coast (NY) and I always found it a bit tacky - you're hosting a party and, just like any other party, would you ask your guests to pay for drinks? The reception is in many ways you hosting a meal to thank people for coming... Would you invite someone to your house and cook them dinner and expect them to pay for part of it? Again, regional differences apply.  • Why are your ceremonies held so late receptions so short? Almost everywhere I've looked does 1 hour cocktail and 3 or 4 hour reception, I'm used to minimum of 2/3 hour wedding breakfast and 5/6 hour evening reception!  In my experience, American receptions tend not to be dinner followed by dancing. It's usually cocktail hour, then a starter, then some dancing, then the main, then dinner, etc. Dinner and dancing are combined. You also wouldn't have people coming just for the dancing, as tiered guests lists are often considered rude or tacky (again, regional differences!). So there is no need to have the evening reception feel like its own party; it's part of the full experience. It was definitely a point of contention for me and my FH - he was thinking a 2 or 3pm start and I thought 6pm! We compromised and will start at 4:30 (ending at midnight).   • Also I've heard about things like ""dollar dash"" or "" dollar dance"" in the Mid-west USA where my FH family lives....just huh?!?!?!  Yeah, regional differences. I had never ever heard of this in NY and can't imagine it being done.   • Again, bridal shower? What is this?   Sigh. Yeah, I won't get one of these, living in the UK. Traditionally it's a chance for the bride to have a mini celebration and also get advice from older married women. Now it's just another excuse for a party, this time focused on the bride instead of the couple.  • And finally wedding gifts/registries? In the UK people usually get a small engagement gift (brought to the party) and a larger wedding gift (brought to the wedding) no mailing of gifts before or after etc. What can we expect from different cultures in this area?   I have always been taught to send a gift off the registry as a wedding gift. You don't need to bring anything to the wedding itself though at a lot of Jewish weddings people will also bring a card with some money. I had never seen a boxed gift at a wedding until I attended a wedding in the UK last year! If you're having a registry expect the Americans to order something to be mailed to you from there either before or within about a month after the wedding."
wedding,3drm8p,snickerdoodleglee,3,Sun Jul 19 10:11:20 2015 UTC,"Your response is great and covers pretty much everything but one addition on bridal showers - they are gift giving events. They are meant to ""shower"" the guest of honor with gifts. Because Of this, it's against etiquette to throw your own shower."
wedding,3drm8p,jerseycowboy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:15:44 2015 UTC,"Thanks!   I haven't decided if I will have a bridal shower yet. I only have 1 female friend in the US currently haha so if she threw it it would just be the 2 of us! I may speak to my Sister (MoH) about having one here in the UK before I move to the US in February. It may be a nice get together before I leave, and also a chance for those who can't make it to the wedding (grandmothers, aunts, some friends) to feel more involved.... but I worry the concept may confuse them.  We are having an Engagement Party in 6 weeks, but that will be 8 months before the wedding, a Bridal Shower 2 months before might be nice before I leave the UK.  Also do people usually give gifts at the Engagement Party, Bridal Shower AND Wedding? 3 gift giving events in 8 months seems like a lot....?"
wedding,3drm8p,snickerdoodleglee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:09:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your response!  I have definitely noticed the regional differences in the US, so thanks for your input from the NE.  Glad you and the FH worked out a compromise, 4pm is late for a UK wedding, so it may confuse a few people, but not as much as a 6pm ceremony would! Plus in all honesty Im always exhausted by the end of weddings in the UK, 12-16 hours of paying attention and socializing is a lot!  We're compromising with a ceremony at around 3pm, followed by 2 hour cocktail reception, and 4-5 hour dinner/dancing combined as the DJ has to be finished by 10 we have to be out of the venue by 11.  Just another note from the UK, most people aren't offended by being invited to just the evening reception with dancing and buffet, these extra invites are common for extended family, old friends and even colleagues if you're friendly but not overly close. It's just the way it's done....!? Usually anywhere between 10-50% more guests at the evening reception. It's only really offensive if someone feels really close to you (and you may not feel the same way) and they were expecting an invite to the full day. If your relationship is mutually distant however, it's no big deal.  As for the cash bar thing, at any kind of function (birthday, christening, anniversary) at a banquet hall/hotel/restaurant in the UK it is usually a cash bar, I have NEVER been to a party with an open bar or even beer/wine included. Weddings are the only time when there is usually the champagne toast included and possibly wine with the wedding breakfast. Same with hosting dinners etc, although the host has some beer/wine/liqor to offer, guests tend to bring something to the meal themselves if it is a larger gathering as you can't cater for all tastes. I always take a bottle of wine or some ciders etc if going to a friends for dinner (sometimes a bottle of gin!) As I wouldn't expect them to cater for my drinks preferences (especially since I can drink a fair bit). When someone is offering there home for entertaining, preparing, cooking and clearing up, I find it rude to expect them to also provide alcohol for everyone. The effort to bring your own is nothing compared to the effort the host is putting in.  As for the certificate, we're trying to work out when we should sign it but it probably won't be during the ceremony (I always find it disrupts the flow and can be boring for guests to witness). And I'm glad to know the Sand/Candle thing is more of a modern trend!  I don't know if I will do a bridal shower as I don't have many female friends in the US who would attend, and my female family and friends in the UK would probably be confused by it more than me.  Are there any little fun or quirky traditions where you are from?"
wedding,3drm8p,laur371,3,Sun Jul 19 13:03:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know the cash bar and tiered receptions are perfectly acceptable here but I can't bring myself to do it! My parents are hosting and insisting on open bar, can't see any guests complaining about that, though!  The only thing I can see that's good about the tiered reception is getting to invite more people to party with, like my work colleagues, for example. But a) our dinner won't even end until about 8:30 and inviting people to come that late seems weird to me when the music will end at about 11:30, and b) I can't shake the feeling that inviting someone to the evening portion is just telling them ""I don't want you to watch me get married, or have to deal with talking to you during the intimate/quiet part of the day, but please come and bring me a gift in exchange for me putting music on!"" I know it won't be taken that way to any evening guests (because they would all be from the UK), but I can't get past it!"
wedding,3drm8p,laur371,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:58:42 2015 UTC,"Haha no I can guarantee no-one from the UK will mind an open bar, but be careful (of course I have no idea what your british guests are like) but they can drink A LOT, and many tend to go overboard at weddings, even with a cash bar! I have friends who are known to have a new drink every 15 minutes, that's a lot in 6 hours.... but if your parents insist and are picking up the bill - why not! =P  I'm lucky our wedding will be small so even if a few people do drink a lot, it won't be as many as if we had $100+ guests! We're doing the open bar as most people are flying so far and staying for 4 days, it's the least we can do!   If your dinner is finishing at 8:30 then yes I wouldn't invite anyone extra for a couple of hours as its not sufficient. Normally is 4 hours or more and kind of classed as a separate event with buffet, Cake cutting and first dances etc so the guests still feel like they are getting something in return for their presence (and present). All guests also get favors at this point and can sign the guest book etc. If there will just be dancing and nothing else and only a couple of hours, I'd definitely not invite any extra guests."

The very first thing I'd tell the brides (other than congrats!) is that your wedding dress size will be bigger than any of your clothes so don't get discouraged. I know it's odd, really they should do it the other way around if they are going to mess with sizes. So say you normally wear a size 6 dress from you'd most likely be a 10-12 in a wedding dress depending on they silhouette. Also they will measure you most likely in 3 places & depending on the type of dress they will pick the part that is the most fitted & base your dress size on that, so if you're really busty but have a small waist/hip with a flowy skirt  they'd go with your bust size so that's also a factor. So sounds like you're falling right were you should be for your pant size in a wedding dress :)  Also in Canada the average wedding dress size is 8-14"

wedding,3dpilr,london_fogg,2,Sat Jul 18 05:02:18 2015 UTC,"Getting married today (July 19th) and I haven't gotten even a wink of sleep all night. My mom and her family don't support and aren't coming, and instead planned a trip to my hometown which I no longer live in and miss terribly. My dad couldn't make it since he is out of state with a new wife and baby of his own along with several other kids from his wife's prior marriage. Therefore, not even one family member on my side is showing up. My friend did fly up from my hometown to come to the wedding. However, she was an old ex-friend from middle school who decided to invite herself and just show up one day. She is really getting on my nerves trying to make everything about her and its making me upset. To put things in perspective, she is so clingy that a few days ago she climbed in to bed with my fiance and I in the middle of the night even after we had a guest room set up for her. A few very important people in my life have died this year, one being just last week, and it's all just super overwhelming. Today is the day, and all I can say is, at least I am getting married to the man of my dreams. These are only trials, and I know love will prevail. Wish me luck and God bless! Ah so good to share a rant..."

As for the people that aren't there, if they are so unsupportive isn't it better that they aren't there? The ones that are no longer with you, you know there love and support will comfort you in spirit. And the friend who did show up, well honestly if you don't care about her or ever seeing her again, I would tell her to leave - I'd rather not have the drama or hassle if it's not someone important!  But for now, breathe, smile and enjoy getting ready!  Congratulations!"

If your relationship was important to her, she would have prioritized it better. Send her an invite, maybe include a special note.

wedding,3do9fe,befores,2,Fri Jul 17 22:02:26 2015 UTC,"Don't know why you're getting downvoted exactly...  But, most brides who have a destination wedding don't go through all the trouble of hauling everyone to a location far from home for a wedding when they're either already married or not actually getting married at that ceremony... I mean that's kind of the whole point of a wedding!  Most destination weddings are just close family and are usually smaller and more intimate.  Eloping and then having a wedding at a later time is a different story.  I had a friend who eloped with her now husband to Vegas and then had a huge wedding with their family and friends the following year.  They did it because they were both in the Air Force and one of them was being deployed.    I had another friend who was contemplating getting married at a courthouse and having a big wedding in a year or so because she was a few months away from graduating nursing school, commissioning in the military, and moving overseas.  The thought of planning a wedding in four-five months was incredibly stressful.  She did it, but she fortunately had a ton of help and stuck to a smaller, more intimate ceremony and reception.    Sometimes people have a simple ceremony or courthouse wedding and a big reception later because of reasons above.  But I think it's very unusual for people to do so with a destination wedding.    There's ways to easily go about the legal paperwork to have a destination wedding and legally be married, if that's what you were wondering.   Hope that answers your questions :)"
wedding,3do9fe,yttlebarr,0,Sat Jul 18 03:32:46 2015 UTC,Thanks for answering my question! I was just wondering because I have seen on some other forums that destination brides had symbolic weddings for whatever reasons.

Our reasons are mostly due to money and time. It will cost extra for the paper work and for a lawyer to be present at your ceremony (depending on which country you are marrying in). For us, it would have been $300 for the paper work and $1000 for the lawyer. It also could be up to a month before we would receive the paperwork we would need from the lawyer. We are going to do a civil ceremony with just us a month or 2 before the wedding and it will only cost $40. No one has objected to this and both our families think it's a smart way to save money."

To expand on it, if you know anyone with a WiiU and Super Smash Bros., the game can support up to 8 players with the right equipment.   One game I think might be good if you are going with tabletop stuff is Mr Card Game (http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Card-Game/dp/B00GWSKCVG) It takes a bit of setting up, but the game itself is quite entertaining, but a bit pricey.  Fluxx is also a pretty good game, and not too expensive! And there are different editions. Also Apples to Apples!"
wedding,3dopum,chenosmith,2,Sat Jul 18 06:03:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/chenosmith on the Smash Bros. for Wii U. For eight players, you simply need eight controllers (tablet counts as one, and the rest can be regular Wii controllers, or Gamecube controllers if you have the adapter). But Mario Kart should work, too.  I wouldn't put too much faith in any board game... Teens are capricious."

I think I'm going to come up with some kind of outdoor games that would be entertaining for most ages.  My mom works at a clinic and she said there are a few medical assistants that would be willing to work different details, so we are going to pay someone to oversee the kids.

Lol It's really just one kid who I'm worried about.  The other two teens are older and are totally fine.  The younger teen's parents tend to get tipsy and not pay close attention to him, and I've seen him shove around other kids with no issues.  Usually parents at least teach their kids not to hit girls.  He has no problem shoving around the girl his age I know who is half his size."

When I looked into things, a bride hair + makeup (including trials) were around $300/$350. Some places quote $200/$250, but then charged $175/$200 for a hair + makeup trial on top of that! Some salons also offer tanning/waxing/manicures - and while the overall price may be higher, overall you may get a better deal. Also - if you use a professional salon for your own hair cutting normally, they may offer a discount if you ask about special occasion services.  good luck!"

If it's not super important to you and your family, maybe go to the courthouse and then have everyone meet up at a restaurant afterwards for a small reception. Have a photographer on hand during the day to take pictures of you, your husband, and your child before the courthouse. Then snap a pic or two of you signing the paper. Then take some nice family photos of everyone together before dinner or at the restaurant."

If they say yes, then, send an invite and make sure you get that RSVP! If you are not close to them, and do not wish to be, then perhaps just letting them know you are having a small celebration (not an invite, just a notice) would be courteous.  Tough situation for sure - but congratulations nontheless!"
wedding,3dj04d,HHH_624,2,Thu Jul 16 17:45:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a good idea. I think I may go the route of Facebook messages since that's how all of us usually communicate."
wedding,3dj04d,SouthgateJenny,5,Thu Jul 16 17:57:38 2015 UTC,"This is the hard thing about a wedding: family politics are complicated and tricky, and for me personally, I'd rather waste the postage and not have to hear about it for years to come.   Send the invites, assume that they are not coming, especially if you only get deafening silence. I would only assume someone's silence could be a ""maybe,"" or an ""I actually forgot about your wedding"" if you see them relatively often. It sounds like you barely even know these people."
wedding,3dj04d,GingerCookie,2,Thu Jul 16 18:51:33 2015 UTC,"In your case I think it would be a waste of time, based on how they reacted the first time. If they had bothered to RSVP, but couldn't make it, then I'd send them an invite.  If you have any adult cousins who maybe moved out or were living under their parents' roof before, you could try inviting them since last time wasn't really their choice.  However, in general, I would invite someone I know couldn't make it, if I wished them there. I live far away from friends/family but love to be invited to their events and know they are thinking of me. And sometimes I can surprise them by attending!"
wedding,3dj04d,Deltagirl730478,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:30:03 2015 UTC,"We only got back four RSVP's. So I know the pain! But we did the same and invited distant relatives that we knew wasn't going to come, but they mailed cards/money and gifts. So that's cool."
wedding,3dj04d,schlahdeedah,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:47:16 2015 UTC,We know of several people who aren't coming to our wedding and we are still sending them an invite because... well I don't actually know why but my mom and FMIL told me I had to so I am. Lol  It doesn't sound like these people have a leg to stand on in terms of being offended if they didn't receive an invite so you don't have to. But if you don't mind paying the money to send them a courtesy invite Id just do it to avoid drama. Weddings always create drama! Le sigh.

wedding,3dj04d,lovemybrit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:05:08 2015 UTC,"I've been asking myself the same question for a couple of weeks. What my FH and I have decided is that we will send them an invite regardless if we know they cannot attend, because we still want them to know that we would love to see them there :3"
wedding,3di6m9,HHH_624,3,Thu Jul 16 13:53:35 2015 UTC,"These are probably not quite the right  color... but modcloth?  Also: Amazon  You may have tried both options already, but it's all I got. Good luck!"
wedding,3di6m9,flippityfloppity,2,Thu Jul 16 14:04:26 2015 UTC,Thank you! I had not heard of Modcloth but LOVE the shoes you tacked in here - Ill look into this more!
wedding,3di6m9,lindseywitt,2,Thu Jul 16 16:53:22 2015 UTC,"There's Overstock.com, and amazon of course, but I'm sure you knew that. I'd also try modcloth. A bit pricier, but lots of cute shoes."

wedding,3didzo,moquias,10,Thu Jul 16 14:54:19 2015 UTC,"Your guests won't be standing for 20 minutes, most will arrive early and in heels or dress shoes so you're asking them to stand for closer to an hour. I make this comment every time a post like this pops up, I have a knee injury, my friends don't really know about it, the only people who I talk to about it are my fiancé and my doctor. If I was forced to stand for even just the ceremony I'd be in an immense amount of pain. Or I'd end up leaving the ceremony early to sit in the car or on a bench somewhere or basically any seat I could find to avoid having my knee lock up for the next day or so.   Plenty of people will say making your guests stand for half an hour to an hour is fine, but you don't know which of your guests have similar requirements and you can't really poll them or anything like that. Even ones without an injury or other reason why they need to sit won't want to stand in heels or uncomfortable shoes (which a good number will be wearing) for an extended period of time."
wedding,3didzo,ilysespieces,2,Thu Jul 16 16:42:53 2015 UTC,"this. I don't have a comparable injury, but i do stand on my feet all day at my current job, and if I'm using some of my precious off-hours to celebrate with you, the last thing i want to use them for is more standing.  So yes, definitely tacky, especially because you don't know what kind of disabilities/chronic injuries your guests bring with them.  OP, have you considered hay bales? Might be less expensive than wood benches."
wedding,3didzo,phoenixacacia,18,Thu Jul 16 17:41:29 2015 UTC,"I think that yes, it is too much to ask people to stand.  People aren't going to show up the moment your ceremony starts.  People may start to show up 30 minutes early, maybe even more.  Now they're going to be standing for an hour.  Every butt needs a chair."
wedding,3didzo,jerseycowboy,0,Thu Jul 16 15:54:35 2015 UTC,"Well the ceremony area is literally 12 feet from where the reception will be which has a lot of seating, but I think I'd rather just have seating for the ceremony so it'll be one less thing I'll worry about while I'm up there."
wedding,3didzo,I_will_slap_you,6,Fri Jul 17 15:42:33 2015 UTC,"Having people stand is not unheard of, but it would absolutely not be my first choice as a guest. Especially out in the hot sun in the grass with pointy heels. Are you having a cocktail hour, when a couple of designated volunteers could move the chairs? Or maybe post in a Toronto subreddit to find benches?"
wedding,3didzo,noble_land_mermaid,4,Thu Jul 16 15:47:33 2015 UTC,"I know it's not everybody's cup of tea, but we're seriously considering renting one set of chairs and moving them to the reception area after the ceremony. We're having the ceremony essentially on the front lawn of the reception building so it'd be easy to do and we've got lots of family as well as the bridal party and ushers who have said they don't mind moving them."
wedding,3didzo,iamfizzly,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:34:41 2015 UTC,"This was our go-to plan for our ceremony. I had the same issues as OP. We didn't end up needing to do it, because we switched to a venue that supplied chairs, so we only needed extra chairs for the reception (not the reason we switched, ha!)  But our idea beforehand was to get the men, bridal party and a few others who were more than happy to help move the ceremony chairs to reception area as soon as ceremony was over.  Really would be super quick if you get enough willing hands on board and not that big of a deal, nor unheard of, especially if the bride and groom go snap a few photos right after the ceremony? Best of luck"
wedding,3didzo,Deltagirl730478,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:12:39 2015 UTC,We're doing this. Well me and my fiancee will be off taking pictures but my future brothers in laws will be setting up the tables and moving chairs.
wedding,3didzo,GingerCookie,3,Thu Jul 16 19:50:35 2015 UTC,"I prefer seats for everyone. On one hand, I'm short so if everyone stands there is a good chance that I won't be able to see. This is especially true if kids are attending.  Secondly, my dad has a bad leg. So he'd want a seat, but he'd want to be near family and wouldn't sit if everyone couldn't sit, or risk not sitting together."
wedding,3didzo,seelydiaplay,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:34:43 2015 UTC,"Also a valid point. I'd rather have seating options for everyone; sure it's short ceremony, but the marriage part should be a big deal and not necessarily something I should try and pinch pennies around. Thanks for commenting!"
wedding,3didzo,IncredibleBulk2,2,Fri Jul 17 15:36:09 2015 UTC,"I've been to a farm wedding where we stood and I didn't mind-- they had a handful of chairs for elderly guests like you're saying, and it felt kind of lovely and intimate imo. Of course depending on how traditional your guests are, some might be peeved."
wedding,3didzo,grandslamwich,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:15:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, that is a good point. Honestly, if it's one less thing for me to be worrying about while i'm up there marrying my best friend, I'll shill out the extra cash for seating, y'know?"
wedding,3didzo,heyitserica,2,Fri Jul 17 15:41:34 2015 UTC,Maybe hay bales and blankets for the elderly and standing for everyone else?  I've stood through weddings before and really didn't mind to allow the limited seating to go to close family.
wedding,3didzo,heyitserica,2,Thu Jul 16 18:11:44 2015 UTC,"I could understand standing for a 10 minute ceremony. 20-30 would be too much for me, not to mention it's rare for everything to actually start on time, and as others have said, your guests will arrive early. I think it would be vastly better to have chairs lined up and then move them to the reception area."
wedding,3didzo,erin_mouse88,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:02:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's my concern, that people will be early, and then would obviously want a place to sit. They could sit at the tables (the reception is literally 15 feet away from where the ceremony will be), but doing that before the ceremony feels too soon."

wedding,3dgzyw,Poor_Butterfly,2,Thu Jul 16 05:02:14 2015 UTC,"What are you thoughts on having both parents walking the bride down the isle? Not at all as a slight to my dad but just in this day and age it's not really about me being ""given"" away and I thought it would be a nice moment for all of us. Thoughts?   Edit: this was actually my own question, but maybe could help for the questions about whom to escort mothers/ grandmothers."
wedding,3dgzyw,HHH_624,4,Thu Jul 16 17:15:04 2015 UTC,"My parents are both walking me down the aisle - that was a non-neogtiable for me! Ive seen it done and I think its lovely and while still traditional, very personal. My mom loved and appreciated the idea to include her."
wedding,3dgzyw,acoustic_lollipop,3,Thu Jul 16 17:42:28 2015 UTC,"Having both parents walk the bride (and the groom!) down the aisle is actually the tradition in Jewish weddings, and I'm seeing it more and more in non-Jewish weddings, too. I've always liked it because it replaces ""dad giving the bride away"" with more of a ""bride and groom are both escorted down the aisle by people they love."" Also I like that the groom gets to walk down the aisle, too, because then it's not all about the bride."
wedding,3dgzyw,Poor_Butterfly,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:27:24 2015 UTC,Ah this is perfect! Thank you for letting me know that. FH doesn't practice but by heritage is Jewish. This will be a nice nod to that part of his family/heritage.
wedding,3dgzyw,Jenny_not_Jennay,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:49:05 2015 UTC,"Are there any ""rules"" or traditional options for escorting the mothers and grandmothers down the aisle? My dad's going to walk me down, so my mom will be solo. My fiance's father passed away several years ago, and his mother will not have a date. His grandmother is also a widow. Should all 3 women simply walk down unescorted, or should someone else walk them down? We don't have ushers, and both my brother and my fiance's brother are groomsmen, so they'll be walking in with the other groomsmen.   Not sure if this is truly an ""etiquette"" question, but I'd appreciate any suggestions, especially if there's a traditional option."
wedding,3dgzyw,HHH_624,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:15:36 2015 UTC,"That's relatively difficult - most of the time you do see brothers or groomsmen escorting them.  one option would be to have your groomsmen escort them and then either a) come back to escort the bridesmaids, or after escorting them stay lined up next to the groom and your bridesmaids can walk down the aisle solo.  Another option is to request family members (uncles, cousins) - someone to escort the mothers and grandmothers. There is an order in which they come out (if youre doing a big formal wedding), so google that and make sure you dont offend your mom by putting her in the wrong order, etc."
wedding,3dgzyw,Jenny_not_Jennay,3,Thu Jul 16 17:41:37 2015 UTC,"Thanks. My venue's day-of coordinator is awesome, so she's going to handle the order of things.
