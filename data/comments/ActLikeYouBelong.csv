If you're not in their system, no chance in hell they'll let you in. Security is top-notch, too, so don't bother trying to jump a fence.   I know that they have guided tours around the area for local residents a few days prior to the event where they let them see the secret mainstage design (no photos though!) and kindly ask for forgiveness for the awfull noise levels. I suspect that the residents get a written invite in the mail, so one could try to copy it and try to break away from the group and hide-out till the event starts. BUT that would be very impractical and once the event is running, you would very soon be screwed by your missing nfc-gate-opening key."

I have no other option, so I go through that door praying I dont end up outside. I end up in a staircase... I go up 1 level and I am now at the 100 Level , with a door leading to the concourse right in front of me!! Only one problem... theres a volunteer checking accrediation. Damn. I keep going up another flight of stairs, level 200 , same thing, door but guarded. Level 300, same thing. I look up and the stairs keep going... so I go check it out and next thing I know im in a Captains' Lounge, with a bunch of guys in white suits walking around and a hottie <span>waitress </span>walking around with a tray of champagne or something. I stick out like a sore thumb with my blue volunteer jacket, so i go back down to the 300 level.... and then BOOYAH! The volunteer at the door is afew steps inside the concourse and talking with someone instead of guarding her door... also at the same time I see 2 volunteers walking towards the door so naturally i walk right behind them, nod at the volunteer guarding the door who nods at us and keeps talking!  WOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOO finally in the concourse!!! I find someone who works there and I ask them the best way to get the 100 LEvel from here, he points to a staircase and I take it down to the 100. My sister had told me that section 111 is reserved for media and that there were 4 seats that were always free during the games she ushered. She told me it would be my best shot if i ever got it. I walk up to section 111 and the usher asks me wehre my ticket is.  FouTight: << uhmm i dont have it, my sister has it>> Usher, looking at me in disbeleif : << Your sister has your ticket?>> FouTight, noticing and pointing to the 4 free seats right in front of me: << Yea, but my seat is right there! >> Usher, looking like he doesnt beleive me: << You dont have your ticket but that seat is yours?>>  At this point, he aint budging and it obvious he doesnt believe me. I bail , turn out and look for a softer usher to hustle.  I go to the next section 110, and this time decide im not talking to the ushers, im just walking in like I belong there. Plan works, I walk right in, turn right and go up the stairs beside the entrance. I squat down in the stairs, and watch the game a bit. I know I wont be able to stay there long, so I scan for empty seats. Obviously there are none, but I notice that between section 110 and 111 is a platform for all the TV cameras. I walk in front of a few people and sit my ass down on the corner of that platform, right beside the stand for a camera. The cameraman doesnt tell me to move, so I dont. Here I am:  And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how I snuck in to the Gold medal hockey game and how I was able to watch it from the 100 level!!!!  And boy, what a game it was!!!! Here is what the place looked like after the golden goal! You can hear me screaming 'woooooooooooo' and also 'ship it' at one point haha (( video has been lost :'( I now take much better care of my precious media files / memories))  My sister was not able to get in at all, and J-M was able to get in but got kicked out after the first period.

You can't tell a theater full of Hollywood power players to put their phones away, and if you try, it doesn't work. I have selfies from inside the theater.  Finally, there's no ""will call"". It's ALL will-call. There are tables set up with lists and everyone's tickets in little envelopes with parking validations.  Seats in the theater are also reserved, so even if they did sneak into the theater (which they didn't, because the wrist band only grants access to the red carpet - you need a ticket to get in the theater), they wouldn't have a ticket with a seat assignment and barcode - if the entry people didn't get them, the ushers would have caught them at that point (or, even worse, they'd be kicked out of their seats by people who have them legitimately)."

This was taken years before I discovered the sub. Two years ago I acted like I belonged in Gramercy Park (A locked, private park in the midst of a wealthy part of manhattan.) The cheapest apartment I can find (on zillow.com) that faces the park is 1.5million for a one bed one bath apartment.  The average price is 10 million though.   Wikipedia link containing proof (the statue)  From Wikipedia:   As a private park, Gramercy Park is held in common by the owners of the 39 surrounding structures, as it has been since December 31, 1831.[43] Two keys are allocated to each of the original lots surrounding the park, and the owners may buy keys for a fee, which was originally $10 per key, but as of 2008 was $350, with a $1,000 fee for lost keys,[6][43][44] which rises to $2,000 for a second instance.[30] The Medeco locks are changed annually,[31] and any property that does not pay the annual assessment of $7,500 per lot has its key privileges revoked;[30] additionally, the keys are very hard to duplicate.[43] As of 2012, there were 383 keys in circulation, each individually numbered and coded.   Side note: The cheapest apartment I can find (on zillow.com) that faces the park is 1.5million for a one bed one bath apartment.  The average price is 10+ million though.   What do you guys think?"

ActLikeYouBelong,3b8lfq,rlnation,7,Fri Jun 26 21:39:20 2015 UTC,"It was a nice day so the park was fairly active. I walked around the park a few times (it's the size of a small block) and watched to see if anyone was leaving. Lots of people walk/run around the park so it wasn't out of the ordinary. Only took a few minutes until I spotted a family heading to the exit. There are 3 or 4 entrances so I had a lot of places to enter from. I was luckily able to time my approach so that the family was opening the gate just as I was walking up.   I briefly fumbled with my keys as they opened the door and went through. I smiled at them and thanked them and entered as they exited. As I entered I heard one of the people say quietly to their family ""Is he aloud in?"". I didn't hear a response but they went about their way and made no comment to me.   The park was quite nice. I was so excited at my success I called my mom to tell her about it. I took the picture for proof for my girlfriend (she told me I'd get caught and never see the light of day again if I tried to get in. This was more motivating than disuading) After spending 15 minutes inside I realized an ever so slight flaw in my plan. I realized the gate is locked from both sides. I had managed to sneak into a park I couldn't get out of.  So, I played ""the wait for someone to come or go"" game again and found my exit 5 minutes later as a family left the park. As I followed them out, they held the gate for me and I was gone."

I first tried to get into the main terrace by going up a bunch of working escalators. Got into a lot of restricted rooms I couldn't believe was not closed, this includes box suites and all sorts of equipment rooms. I did however not ge onto the terrace (wanted to go to the top of it for some pictures) so i went down.  I was there with a friend who has no interest in football nor appreciates big arenas like I do so he wanted to leave at this point which I didn't. After seeing that the entrance to a garage was opened I persuaded him to follow me in thought we could get to the field. We got down to a level below the field which had a lot of trash containers, cars and even a huge ESPN trailer parked in there. There was a line on the floor and a sign right next to it that read ""Authorized people only beyond this point"" or soemthing like that. I figured we couldn't be more than 100 feet away from the field at that moment so i really wanted to keep going. There were some secuity cameras pointed at us and even sort of a guard tower, but since it was unmanned I felt like fuck it, we'll be in and out before any guards might come. Being a foreigner i got some tricks up my sleeve. I have a broad fake accent i bring out along with some confusion anytime i get in trouble in America which always gets me out of situations.  And just like I thought, the field was about 100 feet away around some corners and yet a few more restriction signs. There seemed to be some sort of High School track parctise on the field with about 30 people and no guards. So we pretty much walked in there and acted like we belonged, had some pictures around the arena and then left. Nobody questioned why we were there.  Two days later i got down on a construction ridden field at Kyle Field in College Station doing the same thing.  It's quite amazing how far confidence and acting like you belong gets you"

Having a single event be the location is problematic depending on how many people participate. One person getting past security is doable, but the likelihood of multiple people making it past is dubious, which automatically gives the advantage to those who arrive earlier.   Not to mention the fact that people who subscribe to /r/actlikeyoubelong are probably located all over the country, which further decreases the amount of people who can participate.   I have an alternative and would love feedback on the approach. Instead of a one month period, open it up to 2-3 months. In that time period, actlikeyoubelonger's go about their lives until an event happens near them.   This gives them the opportunity to act like they belong. Then they need to post photographic proof of the event they attended and how they were able to get past security.   Granted, this approach has downfalls. Mainly that it would be easy to lie and say that you snuck past when in reality you had valid credentials. But in my scenario, the community would vote and decide which user put forth the best ""actlikeyoubelong"" effort as far as the event's prestige, ability to get past security, etc."

Nobody wants to read/see a biography about the guy's life, but I feel like the movie became a cliche.  Granted, it's been a couple years since I watched or read the book. I enjoyed both at the time.

Its a great place and you can pick up a very nice Charles Tyrwhitt or Versace suit for about half the going rate.  I presume there's similar things in America, Europe, and elsewhere. Just google Designer outlet ""X Place"". If it's winter ask about their summer range, they will be cheaper because they're out of season, if its summer vice versa.  As for sites, I can;t say i have any experience buying suits from online as its generally not advisable due t the complexity of making sure it fits  If you know your size, which can be obtained by going into a shop and getting measured then just declining to buy anything, I wouldn't be to worried getting a used suit, as long as its in very good condition and fairly recent it might be a good way to save money."
